"Wild Things", production draft, revised by Kem Nunn by Stephen Peters rewrite by Kem Nunn January 21, 1997 1202 West Washington Blvd
Culver City,  90232 : -- --  - --  wet naked woman and man wrapped around each other in ecstasy -- legs, arms, hair, mouths
--   -- then Moonlight reflects on a vehicle's shiny surface
into flesh
-- a man slams of the hood, rebounds away
--   -- then -- caught in - of green neon -- off, on, off, on -- like a strobe's instant-images -- of gasping, tough sex
--   -- then of black-and-white tile -- two women in soaked, clinging clothes -- fight -- hands squeeze a throat
--   -- then -- a sickening hollow  -- an arc of blood, two teeth fall on dark stone
--   -- then -- Blood sprays across the glass of a picture frame -- obscures the photo inside
--   -- then -- a distant emerald island 40-foot sloop  -- shapes on deck -- we are about to  -- --   -- then -- underwater -- rip something into a bloody cloud
: - place of money and privilege
White coral buildings surround an open yard
Tile roofs rise among banyan trees and banana palms, shimmering before a blue blaze of sky
Beyond the yard is the school's playing field and beyond that the waters of Biscayne Bay, dappled in sunlight where the sloops of the school's sailing class bob at their moorings
For a moment all is quiet
Then, faintly, the  of many , rising and falling,
The   to the open windows of a building somewhat larger than the others
The  grow louder
- hundred high school kids sit before a raised, hardwood stage
The students are not unlike the campus, radiant, well-tended -- a veritable sea of adolescent sexuality -- bronze boys who seem to have just come from the boats or tennis courts -- girls in tight shorts riding high up shapely thighs, as
strolls out onto the stage
The man is thirtyish, drop-dead handsome
Dressed not that differently from the kids, in an Izod polo shirt, khakis and boat shoes
His entrance has an effect upon the audience, particularly upon the girls
and , 16, pretty blondes, whisper then giggle
, a dark-eyed beauty, 17 but going on 25, watches Sam's walk, then turns to the girl at her side
, 17, a fully-developed knockout
When we graduate the only thing 'm going to miss is
(with a nod to the stage) Know what  mean
Kelly's eyes are locked on Sam
Nicole has to nudge her
(') Kelly
(still staring) Oh yeah
Sam is at the podium
He looks out across the audience
There are a couple of flirtatious whistles, laughter
Sam smiles, silencing them with a wave of his hand
We've come to the halfway point in my senior seminars
Cheers, applause
Sam waits for the kids to settle
(') Come on
Beats study hall, doesn't it
(
) No
Boos as we
, 18, grumge look, long hair
He sits with a clique of white trashy types, or at least what passes for such at Blue Bay School
Jimmy appears a bit more genuine, as does
SUZlE , a boyish brunette, seated nearby, but with just enough space between her and everyone else to mark her as a loner
She studies Sam Lombardo with a dark, sullen stare
Thank you, Jimmy
Hey, man, at least in study hail  could meditate
(
) He means masturbate
This remark is greeted by a chorus of laughter as we
, one of the golden boys, seated with Kelly and Nicole
Something Kirk with which 'm sure you have hands-on experience
Loud laughter
Sam quiets them again, then turns to the blackboard, where he begins to write, in big letters -- --
The kids start to cheer
Sam writes another word -- -----
The cheering fades into silence
(') We've all heard the words, date rape, sexual harassment
We've talked about some of these things in this room
(beat) Our speakers today head up the Blue Bay Police Sex Crimes Unit -- Detectives Ray Duquette and Gloria Perez
(beat) They're here to give you what we hope will be a fresh perspective on these subjects, and to answer any questions you night have
Sam turns to the wings, his hand out to welcome the visitors
, mid-thirties, with the lanky build of a light heavyweight, walks out onto the stage
He's dressed in a dark suit, dark hair combed straight back above steel-rimmed glasses
walks at his side
She's a good six inches shorter than Ray, with a sweet face
Attractive but no stunner
About five kids applaud
Ray takes the podium
Thank you for having us
We'll each talk for ten or fifteen minutes, then open it up to your questions
Suzie Toller suddenly gets to her feet
As she passes behind Jimmy, we  her , beneath her breath
'm not going to listen to this jack-off
She marches down the aisle and bangs out the rear door
Ray pauses, a dark look on his face, then goes on
Let's begin with a question
What is a sex crime
moment
Not getting any
This draws a few laughs from the kids, a couple of thin smiles from Sam and Gloria
And none at all from Ray Duquette
- The kids change classes
Sam, Ray and Gloria  the grass
The kids swarm past
pair of girls flash by
Have a nice weekend, Mr
Lombardo
Hey, Carole, you too
And be good
(beneath a pouty look) hate to be good
The three adults  an old wooden building
- This is one of the original buildings
We have the offices here now
The walls are paneled in wood, decorated with framed photographs
Gloria stops before one of the photos
An old black-and-white, with that sepia caste harkening back to another age
handsome young man of perhaps 14 stands at the helm of a boat under sail
His hair is swept back, his eyes fixed upon an unseen horizon
There is something in this boy's pose, in the line of his jaw, in the clarity of his gaze, as if what he has fixed upon is the future itself
Anybody in particular
When no one answers, she turns to find Sam at her side
He stares at the picture, then looks at Gloria
Sam Lombardo
The first
Class of 'Forty-Two (beat) My father
Gloria does a slow double-take, looking from Sam to the photo and back again
(0
) Can't seem to get rid of the Lombardos around here
Sam and the detectives turn as a professorial-looking guy in a baggy brown suit ( ) arrives on the scene
Art
Say hello to Detectives Perez and Duquette
(to the cops) Art Maddox
fellow guidance counselor
Art and the detectives shake hands
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life
have the feeling, they got it down already
They're a step ahead of us, Artie
Gloria seems to find this amusing
Ray stands at her side, looks at Sam
Sam feels it, makes eye contact with Ray -- a beat -- at which point, Ray puts a hand on Gloria's back
've got that two o'clock in town
(nodding) Back to the land of grownups
The detectives shake hands once more with San and Art
(to Gloria) If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda
'll see you get a proper tour
(smiling) 'd like that
Ray opens a door for her
The detectives pass through it
Art claps Sam on the shoulder, then walks off down the hallway
Sam remains near the doors, watching as
Ray and Gloria walk past half a dozen expensive cars -- Range Rovers, Beamers and Mercedes, to a plain, white Ford Taurus, which they get into and drive away
- Cheerleaders perform a sensual dance on the porch of a wooden pagoda
rugby team runs drills on the grass, as out on the bay, six tiny racing sloops tack toward the docks
As the sloops enter the narrow channel between the slips one student from each boat jumps onto the dock where he or she sets about tying off the boat
Sam is on one of the boats
Jimmy Leach is at the rudder
(loud enough to be heard by his class) Okay, you guys
Good work
Now coil those dock lines and 'll see you all on Monday
He watches his class clamber up the docks
His eye falls upon the pagoda, the dancing cheerleaders -- Kelly Van Ryan in work-out tights -- bare arms reaching for the sky
-  &  - hosing down boats, stowing sails
They look up as
glides past
The docks rock in its wake
All right
could party on that
Sam just laughs at him
That's about all it's good for
(beat) That's the one to have
He points to a beautiful triple-masted schooner headed out of the bay, under sail
The Windward Passage
crewed on that one summer
(beat) Long time ago
He pulls his eyes from the boat, sets about coiling a line
You know,  want to thank you for getting me into this class
No way was my old man going to spring for the fees
Hey, you're working for it
(beneath a laugh) Least you're supposed to be
He tosses Jimmy the coiled line
Jimmy's caught off-guard, but catches it at the last second, then shares the laugh with Sam
(
) Can  play too
Or is it just for boys
Sam and Jimmy turn to find Kelly Van Ryan at the far end of the dock
She's fresh from cheerleader practice, in a white blouse knotted at the bottom to  a flat, tanned stomach; open at the top to  the swelling of her breasts
She favors Sam with a coy smile
So who's washing your car this weekend, Mr
Lombardo
(off Sam's blank look) The senior car wash, remember
(beat) Tamara's making a schedule
She said you bought a coupon but you're not on anybody's list
Sam smiles, remembering
Well, you know
Figured 'd buy a Washing ticket, support the effort
That old Jeep of mine's kind of a waste of time, don't you think
Sam places the coiled hose on top of a locker then starts up the dock, Jimmy at his side
Kelly falls in with then
Not at all
How about if Nicole and do it
We're working as a team
Sam just looks at her
She looks back -- big, pleading eyes
Okay, try me on Sunday
'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday
You guys can wash the mud off
Deal
(beat) You know,  just looked out front
My ride wasn't there
You suppose you could give me one
Sam doesn't answer right away
He looks toward the school
(') You wouldn't want me to walk, would you
mean like, something bad might happen
Sam hesitates, momentarily at a loss, then turns to Jimmy, who seems to regard Kelly with something akin to physical pain
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride
(still looking at Kelly) What
ride
You want one
Yeah
But  got my bike
- Sam's Jeep rolls out of the drive, Jimmy's bike in back, meaning that Jimmy and Kelly are squeezed into the passenger seat, which is fine with Jimmy
Kelly's thigh is pressed against his
His arm pushes against her breast
Kelly is not so happy
As they near the school's entrance, they come upon a beat-to-shit bug -- stalled at a stop sign
John Deere tractor mower sits nearby
groundsman -- a tall black guy with a shaved head, waits at the wheel of the bug as
Suzie Toller -- in black platform shoes, a -shirt and cutoff jeans, leans over the engine, fiddling with the car's linkage
Sam pulls up next to the bug and stops
We got room for one more, Suzie
You need a ride
Kelly rolls her eyes as Suzie turns to look at them
Jesus
Where'd she get those shoes
Whores-4-Less
Suzie's eyes go cold
She signals the groundsman, who turns the key
The   to life
Suzie flashes a smile, then sticks out her tongue -- which has been pierced by a silver stud
(') That's cute
Suzie gives her the finger
Sam makes eye contact with Suzie, offers a sad smile, while putting the Jeep in gear
(') (to Suzie) hope you swallow it
Jimmy turns, waving to Suzie as the Jeep pulls away
- Magnificent old mansions occupy five-acre bay-front parcels amid lush, tropical settings
Sam's Jeep stops before a pair of gates with the words " " woven into their wrought-iron design
Beyond the gates a long drive leads toward a huge stone house
Kelly jumps out, punches in a code
The gates swing open
Don't forget the car wash
won't
, Kelly's mom, big, sexy, aggressive, a young 42 in a string bikini, comes out from the side of the house
When she sees the Jeep, she starts down the drive
Kelly waves to Sam, then walks up the drive
When she sees her mother coming toward her, her face hardens
Is that Sam Lombardo
(sarcastic) Hi, Mon
Sam
Hi
Sam has already hung a
Sandra comes through the gate and up to the Jeep
Jimmy is checking her out
All eyes
(') (to Sam; as if Jimmy wasn't even there) What
You're going to drive off without even saying hi
Hi, Sandy
Why don't you come in, have a drink
Can't
Got a passenger
Sandra looks down her nose at Jimmy
He can wait
Sam glances past her, to Kelly, who stands languidly at the front of the house, watching
can't, Sandy
've got to run
'll bet
(then, softening) Look, Sam
Why don't you come by this weekend
We'll take the boat out
(cutting her off) Sorry, Sandy
've got plans
What
Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy
Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of
You ought to try it some time
Sandra gives him a hard stare, then marches off toward the house
still at the door, a cold smile on her face
: -- - Neat little stucco houses -- some not so neat -- simmer in tropical heat
-3 Roadster stops at the head of the cul-de-sac
Nicole is driving
Kelly sits beside her
This is it
Kelly looks at a pad of paper, nods
Four-thirty-seven
They pass a couple of teenagers playing basketball in a driveway, a guy mowing his yard
Nice
What do you want, he's a teacher for Christ's sake
(beat) It's here
Pull over
Nicole does, before one of the not-so-neat houses
Sam's muddy Jeep Wrangler is parked in the drive
Behind that is a red Mercedes convertible
'  -  - Sam and , 28, a lean, beautiful country-clubber roll on the bed
Barbara is dressed for tennis
Sam wears a baggy pair of khaki shorts
Barbara struggles to escape
Sam grabs a leg, kisses the back of her knee
He pushes up the little white skirt, kissing her between her thighs
(getting just a little breathless) Sam, come on
'm gonna be late for my game
Sam keeps at it
She's starting to weaken
(') Not that 'm going to be much good after last night
Eat a power bar
Barbara starts to giggle
He's just about got her when
The
Sam lets go
Barbara sighs
- Sam goes to the front door, opens it, to find
Kelly and Nicole, holding plastic pails full of rags
The girls are dressed in Blue Bay High -shirts, cropped to  flat tummies, shorts and running shoes
Hi, Mr
Lombardo
Sam looks over the girls -- a small, exasperated smile
Look, he forgot
knew it
No  didn't
Check out the Jeep
It's nice and dirty for you
(beat) But you might want to wait a minute
The Mercedes is leaving
You mean that isn't yours too
The girls giggle
Sam smiles
Where's the hose
We can set up
In back of the garage
As they walk away, he is joined by Barbara
She watches the girls with an appraising eye
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid
Kelly
She's going to wash your Jeep
Senior class fund-raising gig
told 'em they could hose down the Jeep
(off Barbara's look) Hey, come on
It's for a good cause
Barbara laughs at him
Sam the philanthropist
(a beat) Tomorrow, right
Sam nods
Another kiss
'  - As Barbara goes to her car she sees the girls coming from behind the garage
She looks at Sam, standing in his doorway, watching the girls
When he sees Barbara looking at him, he shrugs, then waves
- '  - Kelly and Nicole, looking very much like the finalists in a wet -shirt derby, ring the bell
Sam answers
He looks them over
couple of houses down he can see the guy with the mower, dumping grass into a can, watching the girls, then turning to walk back to his house
So, where you off to now
Aren't  you forgetting something
(off Sam's look) Your coupon
We gotta have it
Jeez, that thing
Can't you
(smiling) Rules are rules, Mr
Lombardo
Nicole laughs
All right
'll have to look for it
(as he starts to go) Mr
Lombardo
(as he stops) We're running kind of late
How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons
You could give me a ride when you find the ticket
Sam looks at her, as does Nicole
Give me a minute
He hurries from the room
Kelly turns to Nicole, giving her the eye, pointing toward the drive
(mouthing the words) Are you sure
Kelly nods, a mischievous smile on her face
'  - Sam is rummaging through drawers
He stops when he hears the of a
He goes to the window in time to see Nicole's headed down his street
'   - Sam  the room to find Kelly just inside the doorway, where the water from her wet clothing has formed little pools on the linoleum
Sam looks at the water
He looks at Kelly
She moves a step closer, allowing the door to  shut behind her
' long, slow, Antonioni  -- time passes -- the cul-de-sac -- the sparkling lawns -- the kids with the basketball -- a jogger passing by
: '  - The front door
The door opens
Kelly comes out, fast, slamming the door behind her
She walks down the drive
There are tears on her face
As she hits the street, she begins to run
The man with the mower is now seated on his parch, drinking beer
He watches as the girl runs by
The teenagers are still playing hoops
They stop as Kelly jogs past, sobbing
They watch as she hits the end of the cul-de-sac and  around a corner
- Sam, perched in the pilot's seat of a beat-to-shit old air boat, rips through the Florida swamp land
He glides across channels of water, then turns into the tall grass which whips at the hull of his boat
Bits and pieces of debris fly through the air
Sam smiles, swinging the boat through a series of wide, sliding turns
Suddenly he spots something
He throttles down gliding into a shallow pool where
, aware it has been found out, whips about, stirring up mud, then scuttling Sly old fucker
How you got so big, wasn't it
Sam sits for a moment in the silence
He pulls a pair of binoculars from beneath his seat and looks through them
All we  is a shabby collection of whitewashed buildings shimmering in the last long light of afternoon
Sam watches for some time
At last he lowers the binoculars, revs up his engine and leaves
' as it moves away, as  from water level where
The old gator has risen once more -- just the eyes -- a cold primordial intelligence, gazing out, unblinking across the murky waters of the swamp
'  - Sam's Wrangler pulls in next to Barbara's Mercedes
The Jeep is muddy once more
So is Sam
He gets out
'  - Sam
The house is dark
Barbara
Nothing
Me  the living room and starts down the hallway, where a faint light issues from beneath the bedroom door
- Sam opens the door
He hears the  of
He walks across the room and into the bathroom
- Clouded mirrors, a shower stall full of
steam
Behind the glass door we  an indistinct shape, moving about in the hot water
Sam opens the shower door
The steam clears to  Barbara's gorgeous athletic body
It's hot in here, just the way you like it
She grabs his shirt, pulling him into the shower's flow
They kiss
She pulls his shirt open, loosens his pants
His clothes fall away
Sam pushes her up against the tile wall, hard
She holds to his shoulders, nails sinking into his flesh, wrapping her legs around his hips as
The water, dark with swamp mud, spirals down the drain
- Kelly Van Ryan sits on the dock, looking back toward the huge stone house, where
burns in one of the upstairs windows
Kelly has a shotgun laid across her knees
Slowly, she raises the gun, pointing at the yellow window
She holds it there for some time, then, softly, to herself
Bang
-    - Sunlight streams through open windows, mingling with loud sighs of pleasure
Sandra Van Ryan on top of  , a big, buffed-out Cuban
They're making love on the bed
She throws her head back -- an explosion of hair -- gasps -- an orgasm is near, as
cordless   on the night table
They try to ignore it
No dice
Sandra groans, finally pulling away
Goddamnit
(she answers) Hello
(
) Hello, this is the attendance office at Blue Bay School
Your son or daughter is absent today, Monday
Jesus
Christ
She hangs up hard
Sits on the edge of the bed
What
Sandra waves him off
She pulls on a -shirt, then grabs up the phone once more, punching in a number
'  -    - Desk, files, a terrarium full of swamp lizards, above which a photo of the Windward Passage decorates the wall
There's a Waterford bowl on the desk -- etched with "Sam Lombardo -- Blue Bay Educator of the Year
" Sam is working on the computer
The
He answers
Counseling
- / Sandra seated on the bed, one long leg tucked beneath her
Sam, Sandy Van Ryan
Frankie's eyes go cold when he hears the word "Sam
" In his office, Sam pushes himself away from the computer, stiffening noticeably
Sandy
What's up
Listen, Kelly skipped school
Have you talked to her
No
Shit
Here we go again
Didn't you see her this morning
To tell you the truth,  haven't seen her since Friday
--    outside Sandra's window
She jumps
,  -- more
She jumps up to look outside
'  - stands at the edge of the bay, launching skeet then blasting them high above the water
(') Never mind
found her
(a long beat) Listen, Sam
It was good seeing you the other day
(beat) haven't found anyone else can handle the Jonathan like you can
She glances at Frankie -- who has heard enough
He gives her a long hard look, then rolls from the bed to walk from the room
Sam remains silent, watching the lizards with their blank, unblinking eyes
(') Look
know you're seeing Barbara Baxter
So what
So maybe 'm a one-woman man
Sandra laughs
Right
(beat) You really think you're gonna get one of these Blue Bay women to marry you
Sandra pauses to laugh once more
(') Grab a clue, Sam
You're a hired hand around here
Enjoy it while it lasts
Goodbye, Sandra
Sam puts down the phone, looks at it -- a long moment as -- the barest hint of a smile plays upon his face
Sandra slams down her phone
She looks to the bay, to the sleek racing sloop floating beyond the private dock
The nerve of some people
- The   away
Kelly pauses to reload
She catches sight of
Sandra, approaching from the main house
You seem to find guns therapeutic
Maybe  oughta try it
Kelly lets the gun's barrel drift over Sandra, then turns to walk away
She moves toward the guest house
used-brick cottage tucked among the gnarled branches and roots of a huge banyan tree
Sandra follows
(') Let me guess, some boy didn't call and screwed up the weekend
So you're taking the day off
Kelly looks toward the main house, in time to see
Frankie walk from the bedroom and dive into the pool
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that
Whichever one  want
Kelly turns away, starts for the guest house once more
- to  room -- the gun case, the animal trophies, the photos -- One of a stately old gentleman in an elaborate wicker chair, a cane at his side, a bowler on his knee
Others of Kelly and a handsome middle-aged man in safari gear, posing with their rifles above slain wildebeests and bison
Sandra and Kelly
Kelly puts down the shotgun, turns, tears in her eyes
Okay, what's the matter
You notice my new jumper
Kelly does a three-sixty, like a model on a runway
(') My friends buy me clothes, so  don't look like trash
would hardly say you look like trash
No thanks to you
She sits on the bed
Sandra moves to stand over her, angry now
Come off of it
(a beat) You run with all these little trust fund brats
They think money grows on trees
It doesn't
Believe me
And a lot of your little friends are gonna learn that one the hard way
(beat) 'm trying to spare you that
Kelly goes to one shoulder on the bed, sobbing now
Her mother continues to stand over her, suddenly more perplexed than angry
(') Kelly
What is it
miss Dad
Jesus
(a long beat) Well,  do too, sometimes
No you don't
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly
He could have gone out and gotten a job
Christ, he could've found another rich woman
He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married
She pauses as Kelly cries all the harder
(') don't know why he did it
really don't
Her voice trails away, as meanwhile Kelly has drawn herself up into a fetal position on the bed
The sobbing has stopped but her shoulders continue to shake
Sandra sits on the edge of the bed, reaches over to rub Kelly's back
(') Can  get you anything
Kelly shakes her head, no
Her mother looks at her, clearly at a loss
At last she stands
She is headed out of the room when Kelly says something, but the words are indistinct, as her fists are pressed against her mouth
What, honey
can't hear you
There is a long beat as Kelly collects herself
She stares at the wall, her eyes filled with tears, but when she speaks she enunciates each word
said
was raped
Sandra looks as if she has been struck
What
was raped
(a long beat) By Sam Lombardo
Sandra moves over to the bed, sits once more
He
Sam Lombardo
Yes
God, Mom
Kelly begins to cry
Sandra pulls her upright, cradling her in her arms, eyes on fire
- An old Spanish-style building sits before a neat square of grass
(
) My daughter does not get raped in Blue Bay
-   - Sandra slams a fist on the conference table
Kelly is seated between her mother and her mother's attorney, Baxter sports an Italian suit and a lethal Alexander Haig look
Seated across from these three are Ray, Gloria and  , the local
Silence follows Sandra's outburst
Baxter reaches to squeeze Sandra's shoulder
Kelly puts her face in her hands
(in a quiet voice) You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo
That's right
Ray and Gloria exchange looks
Gloria in particular looks slightly stunned
The guidance counselor at Blue Bay
(sarcastically) The guidance counselor at Blue Bay
We understand your feelings, Ms
Van Ryan
But please, we'd like some time with Kelly
We'd like to take her statement alone
Baxter nods, yes
Sandra looks at Kelly
Are you okay for this
Kelly nods
(') The man must be insane to think he can do this to me
Tom Baxter takes her by the arm as Ray  the room to open the door
Bryce Hunter walks out with then
Gloria takes a seat closer to Kelly
When she speaks, she is very calm and quiet
How are you, Kelly
Would you like to take a break for a minute
(shaking her head) just want to get it over with
My mom's making me do this
just want to forget it
know you do
She waits as Ray sets up a camera on a tripod
(') We'd like to videotape the statement if that's all right with you
Kelly shrugs
(') know this is not pleasant, Kelly
But these are serious charges and we need to know everything that happened between you and Mr
Lombardo
(beat) Are you ready
Kelly nods
- ' He started rubbing my shoulders
Said must be sore after washing cars
let him   mean he's a nice guy
(beat) don't know
It was so fast closed my eyes
remember his hands moved to my breasts
mean just for a second it was nice
forgot whore was
mean he's so gorgeous
to
- Ray, Gloria and Bryce Hunter stand at one end of the long conference table, watching the playback of Kelly's tape
The next thing
his hand was in my shorts
you know, from behind
His fingers
his fingers
(
) Take your time
They were in me
Both places
you know
(
) understand
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something
(beat) tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor
(
) Was there penetration
Did he put himself inside you
Yes
said stop
screamed
mean that's how it sounded in my head
He hurt me
(
) (as Kelly breaks into tears) That's okay, Kelly
You're doing fine
(beat) But  have to ask you something here
When you say it hurt
Was this the first time a man was inside you
No
've done it a couple of times, mean with guys  dated
But this hurt
like, he was built
you know
(
) He was large
Kelly nods, starts to break down again, then holds it off
(
, ') Did you try to fight him
he had my wrists pinned behind me
remember my hands were cold
' (
) Then what
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen
"  Then he just stopped
(
) You mean he withdrew
Not at first
He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything
He said we had this secret
And that now he'd be able to help me
because we were close
Something like that
don't know
It's hard to remember, exactly
(
) Try, Kelly
know one thing he said
It was when
when he took himself out and was standing up
(beat) He said, "Don't worry,  didn't come
" can't forget that
He said, "No little girl can ever make me come
" The tape is paused --  on Kelly's face
,  & "No little girl can ever make me come
" Jesus
Too bad
We might have some physical evidence
Ray and Gloria stare at the screen
don't know
It feels wrong
Ray and Hunter look at her
Why
think she's acting
think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her
(beat) think maybe she's upset that he didn't
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for
The line  get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay
That doesn't make him a child rapist
(beat) There's something else
This girl's had some problems
Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars
Ran away
Where's this coming from
worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years
We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks
Maybe a year ago
The family kept it out of the papers
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide
You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior
All 'm saying is,  think we should go slow here
Hunter puts his hands together, thinking
He looks from Ray to Gloria, than back to Ray
want a full-scale investigation
You know what that will mean for Lombardo
don't care
You heard that girl's statement
think he's dirty
Get me a case
Gloria and Ray watch as Hunter gets up and leaves the room
Well you were a big help
You know what's going to happen if we go full-bore on this
Ray looks at the screen
It's our job, Gloria
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass
You know that as well as  do
(beat) We're gonna trash this guy's life and keep asking myself if it's really necessary
Ray thinks this over
He continues to study the screen
- ' (0
) Yeah, well, maybe you're wrong about him
Maybe he's got it coming
- -- - Ray takes notes, talks with neighbors, kids, lawn mower man
-  - Gloria talks with students -- Jimmy, Nicole, others
'  - Sam sits at his desk, toying with a pencil
He watches students pass -- no smiles, no waves, an occasional dark look
Through the press of students Sam sees Art at the door of his office
The two men look at one another
At which point
Gloria, followed by Ray, steps
The detectives shake hands with Art
As Art turns to close the door, Sam falls within his line of vision
Art looks away
The door swings shut
- The sky has begun to color
Art Maddox stands on the grass at the end of the channel separating the slips, watching as
lone sailboat tacks toward the school
-  & Sam drops his sail, leaving himself just enough momentum to cruise expertly into the little channel then into the slip
Art watches as Jimmy jumps from the boat, ties it off
That's good, Jimbo
'll see you on Monday
Jimmy hesitates, he wants to say something
Sam waves him off
Jimmy gives Art a hard look and heads for the grass
(') (to Art, nodding after Jimmy) What's left of my sailing class
Art studies the dock between his feet
(') Talk to me Artie
Kelly Van Ryan
is accusing me of rape
Jimmy told me
Apparently 'm the last to know
Sam
(a long beat) Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long
She's pushing for suspension
This is insane
Art shakes his head
All  can tell you Sam, is hang in there
They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay
That's great
'll just tell my creditors 'm not a rapist
No problem
Shit
(beat) can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it
The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay
They built the school
Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle
(beat) You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam
You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one
- Typical of its kind -- a Blockbuster Video, a 7-Eleven, half a dozen small businesses, one of which, sandwiched between a donut shop and the Mongolian Beef Bowl, bears the sign:  "  -- " - Sam sits in a cramped waiting room, leafing through a magazine
An attractive young  sits a few feet away, behind her desk
Her
She picks it up, then turns to Sam, favoring him with a flirtatious smile
Mr
Bowden will see you now
- Ken Bowden, a slightly oily-looking young man in a nice suit and a large, padded neck brace, rises to shake Sam's hand
Sam, hey, it's been a while
(beat) Looked for you at the ten year reunion
You missed out
Three days at the Disneyworld Hotel
Partied ourselves silly
Sam nods
(') Couple of your old flames were there
You remember Jill, with the knockers
Ken holds his hands out in front of his chest
(') Blew up like the Goodyear blimp
Sam forces a smile
(') But check this
(interrupting) Ken
'm in some trouble
need an attorney and you're the only one  know
So  figured 'd start here
Ken stops, puts on a serious face
Well, 'm glad you did
And 'm sorry
(folding his hands before him) Why don't you tell me about it
Sam looks at him
He starts to speak, then checks himself
What did you do to your neck
Ken puts a hand to his throat, as if aware of the brace for the first time
Oh this
chiropractor did a number on me
He takes the brace off, tossing it on his desk
(') don't really have to wear the thing all the time
(beat) guy from the insurance was here
Ken smiles
Sam looks slightly ill
(') Go ahead, Sam
Shoot
Let's see what we've got here
- Trendy nouveau
valet parks Sam's Jeep
- Sam walks across a tiled entry
He looks tired, but smiles at the maitre d'
Georgie, hey
'm meeting Barbara
She here yet
looks stiff, maybe a little nervous
Sam picks up on it
He scans the room
Dimly-lit, crowded, but we   Barbara, stunning in a delicate white sun dress, tanned arms resting upon a table
Sam starts toward her
George reaches out to touch his arm
Mr
Lombardo
Sam ignores him, threading his way among the people at a lavish bar, then stopping short as he sees who Barbara is with -- her father, Tom Baxter
Tom Baxter sees Sam, gets to his feet
This is not appropriate Lombardo
Sam steps to one side, makes eye contact with Barbara
Barbara has tears in her eyes
She looks at Sam, then shakes her head, looking away
Barbara
You're finished in Blue Bay, Lombardo
You've been scratching at the door long enough
(as Sam faces him) ever see you around my daughter, you're going to be finished, period
The two men square off, but already we can  Georgie, trailed by a pair of beefy characters in blue blazers making their way across the room
Sam sees them too
He takes a final look at Barbara
When she refuses to meet his eye, he pushes past Baxter, through the crowd and out of the restaurant
- Red neon identifies it as Jim's Recovery Room
handful of trucks sit in a dirt parking lot, Sam's Jeep among them
- The air is thick with smoke
Locals shoot pool
The walls are decorated with dusty fishing nets and inflated blowfish
An aging  -- good-looking -- once, runs a rag around a pitcher, looks down the bar, smiles, finding
Sam, alone, awaiting service
Sam, honey
Haven't seen you in a while
How's life treatin' you
(off Sam's look) That bad, huh
Well, you came to the right place
- Sam walks outside
He stands in the red glow of neon light, looking toward the road
On the opposite side of which
sits a sorry little collection of whitewashed stucco bungalows, identified by a green neon sign as the Glades Motel
Beyond the motel are the Everglades, a great expanse of darkness
Sam stares at the motel
At last he gets in his Jeep
As he the lot, a second pair of headlights flashes on
- deserted two-lane road cuts through the swamp
Trees bearded with moss appear as ghostly shapes in the lights of Sam's Jeep
/
'  -  - San drives -- a tired face
Soft  on the
Something  in the road, caught for a moment in the headlights
Sam swerves, whirls his head around, sees
sliding of the shoulder and into the murky water
Sam lets out some air, relaxing a bit, then catches sight of something else -- Headlights finding reflection in his rearview mirror, coming fast
Sam watches as the lights get closer
He looks back to the road -- an approaching curve
Sam is into the curve when the lights catch him
black Range Rover moves out to pass, then turns suddenly into Sam's lane, cutting him off
It happens quickly
Sam swerves to avoid hitting the larger car, but the road affords little margin for error
The  slides across a narrow shoulder, then plummets down a steep embankment,  through cattails, rolling over to on its tires in a swampy gulch
Sam slumps back from the steering wheel
Somewhere over his head he can see headlights shining into the trees
He hears a   , the  of someone scrambling down the embankment
Sam tries to get out of his seat harness
Someone is approaching, splashing through the muck
Suddenly a hand reaches through the broken driver's window, helping him
' Are you all right
The hands get him loose
Sam stumbles from the car
Yeah, 'm okay
He looks up to find -- Frankie Condo, looming over him
That's too bad
He grabs Sam, pulling him
What we are left with is the  of     -- then Sam, hitting the hood of his Jeep, slumping down into the muck
Frankie is breathing hard
We  him  back up the embankment
We  a  , the   driving away, leaving only darkness, and the   of the swamp
- Dazzling light
Sam's smashed-up Jeep is parked before Ken Bowden's office, next door to the Mongolian Beef Bowl
- Sam and Ken eye one another over a green plastic table -- Ken with his neck brace, Sam with a bruised face
figured, you know, it would be darker in here
He moves a hand to his face
Good thinking
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan
Forget it
Lady has some deep pockets
That's all 'm saying
know how deep her pockets are, Ken thought  might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan
Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank
He pauses to look at Ken Bowden
(') Can't you take that stupid thing off
Not in here
Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes
San sighs, slumps back in his plastic seat
(') You're not in bad shape, really
know you think you are, but you're not
Let me tell you why
(beat) Sandra Van Ryan
What's that supposed to mean
For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you
It doesn't add up
Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared
(beat) And 'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless
Ken reaches into his briefcase
He pulls out some papers, tosses them on the table
Sam picks one up, starts to read
Nellie Gail Ranch
Sound nice
It's a fucking drug rehab farm
It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp
(beat) Meanwhile, you get educator of the year mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury
(beat) Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet
Reason
They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty
Now tell me 'm right
There's nothing for them to get
Good
So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep
We're going to insist they take a statement
We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back
(beat) They're walking a fine line here
Defamation of character, malicious prosecution
just want my life back
Fair enough
Let's go make a statement
- Everyone's looking a little tired, with the possible exception of Ray
At this moment he sits back in his chair, staring at Sam
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house
(with growing impatience) Story's the same, Detective
Ken pats him on the arm
When Sam speaks again, it is in a calmer voice, calm but tired
(') had to go look for this coupon
The one you bought at school
(nodding) Like  said,  hadn't really expected to use it
(beat) Anyway, 'm going through a drawer hear a car
look out the window see Nicole driving away
leave my room, and there's Kelly
In cutoffs, a wet -shirt
Yes
And she wanted to talk
Yes
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about
could, but it's confidential
Look, the point is, we didn't talk
told her this was not an appropriate time or place
And she began to cry
And you put an arm around her
Yes
Mainly to turn her toward the door
told her we would talk on Monday, in the office
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car
Again
think we covered this
told her  was going to call a cab
But she ran away
That's right
Did you call anyone
Did you call her house to see if she got home
Did you call the Masons
No
Weren't you a little worried about her
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house
There's phones there cruised the place, but  didn't see her
figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found
don't know
Maybe  should have called
But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself
figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office
There is a moment of silence in the room
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her
Isn't that against the rules
It is and  don't
Ordinarily
(beat) But,  mean
there's this kid standing in front of you crying
With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet -shirt with no bra
He is cut short as Sam shoves his chair back from the table
Fuck you
This is bullshit
'm outta here
Sit down, Lombardo
Sam and Ray stare at one another
Ken puts a hand on his client's arm
All right, all right
Enough
Ken stands up
He walks to the two-way mirror set in one wall, rapping on the glass with his knuckles
(') We came down here to make a statement
We've made it
(beat) If you're going to charge my client, do it now
- stares at Ken's face, about a foot away
Ken of course can't see him
Hunter gives him the finger
- stares into the mirror, waiting
didn't think so
(to Sam) Let's go
Ken opens the door
Sam turns back to Ray and Gloria
've spent the last ten years of my life working with kids
love what  do, and  think 'm good at it
(beat) These kids trust me, and there is no way
No way in hell  would ever betray that trust
As Ken and Sam leave, Ray and Gloria are joined by Bryce Hunter
Nice speech
Either of you buying
Ray shrugs
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her
That's bullshit
What about witnesses
We've got three
Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops
And what do they say
Same as him
They saw her come
They saw her go
They saw him follow
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her
mean how long does it take to put on a shirt
At which point, a   in the doorway
Phone, Bryce
It's Sandra Van Ryan
Christ Almighty
That woman's calling me six times a day
He starts away, then stops
(') think you're onto something, Ray
Stay with it
Hunter bangs out of the room
Gloria slumps in a chair, tired, disgusted
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there
Same with the kids
They saw her running down the street, but that's it
(beat) With no physical evidence, what do we have
Her word against his
You're telling me you believe the guy
All 'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid
Ray is paged by his
He pulls it off his belt, looks at the number
'd better return this
Ray leaves
Gloria pulls a cigarette from her purse and lights up, rests her head back in the chair, blowing smoke at the ceiling
- Gloria is grinding out the butt as Ray walks back in
There is something in the way he carries himself, some sense of urgency
(off Gloria's look) Seen any good gator wrestling lately
/
'  -  - Ray and Gloria drive through the Everglades, past marshlands punctuated by thick stands of melaluca trees
They say it was old man Van Ryan planted the melalucas to dry up the swamp
Ray nods
(') You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark
You know what you get
More bark
And more bark
There's no core
Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water
And now they can't get rid of them
They've tried poisons
Nothing works
They don't die
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his
don't imagine he gives a shit now
Gloria just looks at him
Ray stares into the dusty light of an approaching sunset
At last he slows, turning off the highway and onto a narrow dirt road
sign pokes out from the tall grass -- "' ' " The Taurus bounces along the washboard road
You're sure we're not lost
They are driving now at the edge of a canal
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay
The skinny brunette
This is where she lives
She wants to talk
(beat) Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all
busted her once for possession
she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine
Ray gives her a look
Gloria shrugs
(') That's what they called it when  was in Juvenile
It's a pretty dismal place
It's a shithole
But she was dirty, what was  gonna do
They pass a sagging chain-link fence, entering a quarter-mile run of shabby trailers and cheap shacks
The squalor of the buildings is seat in contrast to the beauty of the Glades where the waters have gone to the color of polished brass beneath an immense, darkening sky
Ray parks before a ramshackle building covered in vines and peeling paint
sign reads:  "  $1
"  The jawbones of numerous gators hang beneath the eaves
As they get out of the car, something catches Gloria's eye -- along the bank of the canal
where a tall man () with long white hair and tattooed arms kneels inside a pen, slapping a huge gator on its snout
The reptile lifts its upper body, hissing, opening its jaws
Walter takes a stick from his hip pocket, passing it through the gator's mouth
The jaws snap shut, incredibly fast, with a hollow snapping sound
Gloria jumps instinctively, then watches, aghast, as Walter slaps the creature once more
This time moving round to the front of the gator, sticking halt his arm inside its mouth
(0
5
) He's just showin' off for you now
Gloria starts, then turns to find a woman () has walked up beside her
The woman is in her sixties
She's dressed in polyester
Her hair is piled on top of her head -- too dark to be anything but a dye job
cigarette bobs from her lips
Before Gloria can respond, Ray steps up behind than
Evening Ruby
(beat) see you still got Walter
was sort of hoping something had eaten him by now
(a long beat) Can  help you with something
Ray and the old lady look at each other
Suzie called
You know where we can find her
Ruby looks toward the store
You know the way
She watches as the detectives  the road, then calls to them as they start up the steps
(') You won't shoot her will you
don't believe she's armed
Gloria turns, surprised
Ray gives the woman a long, cold stare, then opens the door for Gloria
- It's dark inside
The main light source is a tiny, beat-up black-and-white
Two elderly women in colored bouffant hairdos sit on a ratty old couch watching reruns of "Family Feud
"  They look up as Ray and Gloria  then  through a door in the back
'  - Black walls
Cheap bookshelves, filled to overflowing
wire strung with dismembered doll parts runs the length of the room
Suzie is propped on a ratty futon, an open book on her stomach, her thin, white arms crossed behind her head
Jesus
It took you long enough
What if somebody was trying to strangle me
Or fuck me in the ass, even
(beat) mean, you guys are Sex Crimes
Ray manages a thin smile
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez
did
At Blue Balls
Seems to me you left early, before we could meet
But hi, Suzie
Gloria puts out a hand
Suzie looks at it, puts out a hand of her own
As the women shake, Gloria looks at the book on Suzie's stomach, turning her head as if to read the title
It's Celine
He's okay
He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are
So Suzie, you called us, remember
Suzie takes a cigarette from a pack at her side, lights up, blows smoke at the ceiling
Did they arrest Mr
Lombardo
Ray and Gloria exchange looks
No
Will they
It doesn't look like it
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls
Ray shrugs
That bothers you
(a long beat) Yeah, maybe, a little
Why is that
Suzie lets out her breath
She rests her head against the wall
(') You can talk to us, Suzie
That's why we're here
- Suzie, Gloria and Hunter sit at the conference table
Ray operates the video cam
Okay, Suzie
We want you to tell us about the day Mr
Lombardo gave you and Jimmy a ride
Suzie stares at the three cops around her, then at the camera
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news
We need to tape the interview, Suzie
No one will see it but us
(beat) Now when was this, that Mr
Lombardo gave you the ride
Suzie stares at the camera
She's lost the cockiness she had on her own turf
She looks small, white and frail in the sterile room, surrounded by the detectives
About a year ago
He dropped Jimmy off first
Yeah
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there
No
So you were alone
Yes
Did he come in with you
guess
You guess
Did he or didn't he
Yeah
okay
he did And then what
he touched you
Did you maybe flirt a little
wanna go home now
Gloria glares at Hunter, shakes her head
Suzie, look,  know you feel bad know it's harder to talk here than in your room, but we need to get it on tape
(beat) Just tell us what you told us before
Tell us the truth
Suzie huddles in her skinny arms, studying the detectives
didn't say a thing to him
He just put his arm around me
Told me  was pretty
could be really pretty, he said
Another moment -- she looks at Ray, then at Hunter
What did you do then
(a long beat) Shit, what difference does it make
Nobody's gonna believe me anyway
Suzie
Did this man rape you
Okay
He did
He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me
Now, can go home
She stands up
At that point were you able to fight him off
No
He stopped by himself
Okay
That's all
Let me go
Gloria gets to her feet as well; she tries to put an arm around Suzie
The girl jumps back as if she has been shocked
(') Don't touch me
Gloria's hands fall to her sides
Suzie heads for the door
The detectives exchange looks
At which point, Suzie stops, turns to face the room
(') He did say something
What was that
He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come
" of a jail  shut on Sam Lombardo
He turns to
menacing

Now they're gonna get screwed
Your Honor
Please
Any more interruptions Mr

Then she found out that Mr

Ruby and Walter arrive now too
Suzie runs to them and they lead her through the crowd, Walter pushing people aside with his long, tattooed arms

Ray pushes a hand through his hair, then turns to find Sam looking at him

Kelly seems to give this a moment's thought, then, smiling
Ecstatic
- Sam cruises slowly across the water in his junked-out air boat
He kills the engine, allowing the craft to glide to a stop
He's close to where he found the big gator -- the same shabby collection of whitewashed buildings we now  as the Glades Motel, shimmers in the distance
Sam leans back, enjoying the silence
He reaches into a cooler, takes out a beer, opens it, takes a drink, then pulls something else from the cooler -- -- a bundle of white butcher's paper
Sam opens the paper, takes out raw meat -- something disgusting to look at -- big red turkey necks, maybe, which he tosses into the water
as the meat drifts down -- then, a sudden boiling, as -- quick as the strike of a snake -- the huge gator , jaws wide, to snap up the morsel before slipping beneath the surface once mare
: - Ken's Secretary opens the inner office door for Baxter
Ken rises from a desk to greet him
Tom Baxter
Good to see you again
Let's cut the crap
What does your client want
Besides an apology
Unless you're planning on leaving Blue Bay, there's gonna be other cases, other days
You might want to keep that in mind
Okay Tom
My client wants your client to saddle up
so we can ride her ass all the way to the bank
- hot morning in June
Shadows angle across the campus
Students line up at the old wooden pagoda, picking up caps and gowns
few turn, surprised to see
cross the parking lot,  a building
'  - working at his desk
Sam's terrarium is behind him, his "Educator of the Year" Waterford bowl, a storage box of files
Art looks up at a  on the
Sam walks into the room
It is a slightly awkward moment
Lizards don't seem to miss me
The two men smile, breaking the tension
(') How you doing, Artie
You know
Sam waves him off
Take care of my lizards, Art
Art stands up
The two men shake hands
Sam comes out, then stops suddenly
Kelly waits for him
Kirk and Nicole are with her
long moment
Kelly
Drop dead
You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off
She's trying to break my trust
How do you like that
can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you
Look, Kelly
'm sorry
know what you've been through
should've seen something like this coning
Art  in the door behind Sam
Kelly cones closer
Why don't you start fucking her again
You can spend it together
Kirk tries to take Kelly's arm
She jerks away, swings at Sam
He ducks, dropping the Waterford , which  upon the floor
Kirk bear-hugs Kelly
She throws a notebook at Sam
(') hate you
She starts crying
Kirk and Nicole drag her away as a crowd gathers
Sam, shaken, kneels over the broken crystal
Art bends to help him pick up the pieces
You see
couldn't stay, even if wanted to
- Sam's Jeep is parked next to the -bird and Jaguar
'  - Baxter, Ken, Sandra, Frankie stand watching, as Sam signs papers
At last Sam looks up, faces Sandra -- not a happy moment
Sandra gives him a long, hard stare, then walks from the room
Frankie prepares to follow her, then stops, looks at Sam
'll be seeing you
Sam just looks at him
The big man leaves
Baxter closes his briefcase
So long, Tom
Come by sometime
We'll have lunch at the Beef Bowl
Baxter stops, gives him a cold look, then a surprising smile
don't think you're gonna be eating at the Beef Bowl anymore, kid
He
Ken goes apeshit -- whoops, dances around the desk, drops into his chair, holds up the documents
Sam watches, smiling, finally
Thanks Ken, you did okay
Both men stand, they shake hands
Ken claps him on the arm
(no clowning now) Look,  know there's a part of you wishes none of this had happened
But it did
Now take the money and get out of here
Find a happy place
: - Moonlit fog -- the vast swamp
- It's late
neon palm tree flashes across an empty lot as
Sam's Jeep pulls in out of the night, parks before its bungalow
Sam gets out, lifts his storage box of files from the rear
- The neon's green light slashes across the dark walls through old Venetian blinds
Sam , puts the file box on the floor
Arches a sore back
He reaches for a bedside lamp, stops, listens, decides it's nothing, reaches again for the lamp, stops again, listening
-- the high-pitched  of a
Then more -- a flurry of Sam frowns, sees
cloud of mosquitoes circling him
He checks the front windows -- closed
He goes around the bed
The slightly ajar bathroom door with full-length mirror comes up on his right
Ahead is a rear window -- wide open
Sam stops fast
Thinks
Lets out a breath
Damn maid
He steps to the window
He looks down -- Muddy footprints
Sam freezes
He whirls around -- sudden green   in the big mirror -- like a nightmare image -- lit by the neon flash, then
Sam jumps back
Ahhhh
The neon green face flashes again in the mirror --
Now the bathroom door slowly opens all the way
Sam backs up, hits the wall
Kelly Van Ryan steps out of the bathroom, a long object held at her side, wrapped in a towel
Jesus Christ, what are you doing
So you got my mom's money
Sam tries to breathe, manages a nod
(') How much
Kelly prods him with the concealed object
(') How much
About six and a half million dollars
Kelly raises the abject covered by the towel, aims it at Sam
Your turn to pay
moment -- then she yanks the towel away to  -- --  a two-foot-long novelty penis with giant balls
Her hand grips the acrylic scrotum like the butt of a gun
(') King Dong
That's you, Sam
She screams with joy, vaults into his arms, wraps those perfect thighs around him
The dildo goes flying
They fall on the bed
(') It worked
We screwed the bitch
She's all over him now -- tongue kisses
') It worked just like you said it would
He kisses her, finally gets her to sit, straddling him
God, you scared the shit out of me
You must be crazy coming here
Of course 'm crazy
Ask my mom
She kisses him again, more passionately now
He gets into it, tears her blouse open, putting his tongue to her breasts
moves on the wall, looming above them
Sam sees it, his eyes widen
He tries to sit up, as
-- an
Sam jumps, knocks Kelly to his side
champagne cork hits the ceiling
Suzie Toller stands over the bed with a foaming champagne bottle
How much is about six and a half million divided by three
Jesus
Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change
Kelly screams in joy again
(') Now calm down
Both of you
The girls put on mock serious expressions
(') From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental
thought that was understood
Hey, come on
We've got to have at least one victory party
Kelly grabs the champagne, takes a long gulp, pours some on her breasts as she straddles Sam once more, inviting him to lick them clean
Kelly, for christ's sake
She has begun to move like a lap dancer, inviting him to take her breasts in his mouth, putting a hand to his crotch
(') The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves
(her hand in his crotch) Do it to ourselves
(weakening) We have to stick with the plan
Stick
Sam gives up, lays back as Kelly undoes his pants, then moves to get him inside her
Suzie watches
She takes another drink, then tosses the bottle, pulling off her top,  her small, white breasts, a couple of tattoos, a pierced nipple
She slips behind Kelly, fondling Kelly's breasts as Sam arches beneath them both -- all of them totally into it now, losing themselves in the sex
: ' ,     - The room is dark and empty, with the exception of a single desk lamp, by which halo we find
Ray Duquette, in an aloha shirt, waiting as his computer's printer finishes a job, as suddenly
a new light rushes into the room
Ray turns to find Gloria standing in the doorway
He stops as his printer finishes the job
He pulls out the paper, looks at it, smiles
Gloria walks to his desk
You saw the news today
Lombardo's settlement
Ray nods
(') Yeah, well,  told you they were gonna make us look stupid
Ray gives her a long look
Gloria waits a moment, shrugs
Hey, don't back away from it, you were right
We did look stupid
(beat) What you were wrong about, is who made us look that way
Gloria just looks at him, puzzled
(') Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial
Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right
(Gloria nods) So why not tell us about the affair mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial
thought of that
Then  said, come on, you're Lombardo
Your reputation is getting trashed
You want to stop the bleeding
You don't want to sit in jail for three months
Unless
Unless what
Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday
It is quiet in the office, save for the soft  of Ray's (') They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start
Why
You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life
(beat) He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing
(interrupting) The job looks okay to us
But look at it from his point of view
The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege
But for him
it's just a reminder of what should have been his
Gloria gives this a moment's thought
(') Your old man graduates from Blue Bay School, you're not supposed to wind up there
Board of Directors maybe, but not in the lousy guidance office
Now
Point number two
(he taps at the printout on his desk) 've run a financial on Lombardo
Guy was eyeball-deep in debt before this all happened -- trying to keep up with pricey trim like Barbara Baxter
He passes the printout to Gloria
She looks at it, thinking
So what about the girls
Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother
Surely her father
(interrupting) Her father didn't leave her squat
The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck
Gloria looks over Lombardo's financial once more, tosses it on the desk, then studies Ray -- long beat
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it
flat don't like the guy, Glory
He's dirty
And 'll tell you something else
You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money
(beat) He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal
(beat) It was after the war
Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him
The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it
Eliminate the competition
You got it
The rich got richer
While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp
Gloria looks at him a long moment
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway
(a long beat; then beneath a smile) net a guy in a bar
,   - Sam walks down the steps, gets into his Jeep, and drives away
Across the street -- the white Taurus -- Ray and Gloria watch
- Sam comes out, rounds a corner and is gone
Ray Duquette steps  , turns into the brokerage
The door swings shut behind him
,    - Girls in tank suits finish laps, towel off
As the girls begin to walk toward the lockers, they encounter
Ray Duquette, threading his way among the girls, his eye on
Kelly, alone on the deck, still dripping -- a Botticelli vision
(
) Nice stroke
Kelly, startled, turns to find Ray walking toward her across the deck
She snatches a towel from one of the racing platforms and begins to dry herself, wrapping the towel around her
Is there some reason why you're here
Curiosity,  guess
About what
How to improve your breast stroke
Ray gives her a cold smile
Actually,  was curious about how you see things working out, for you, Sam and Suzie
This appears to give her pause, a moment of hesitation
Excuse me
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together
Kelly looks around the pool area
number of girls are watching from a corner of the deck, but no one is close enough to hear
(') The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out
You're out of your mind
've been a cop for a while, Kelly
(beat) It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three
And then there's the love angle
mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money
Kelly starts to walk away
Ray cuts her off
(') Am  right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie
That's murder, Kelly
Police -- God -- get a life
She moves around him and walks calmly away
(loud enough to make himself heard) You're good
But you don't think that little ditz Suzie's gonna hold together, do you
Kelly continues to walk, her face giving nothing away, as Ray's over the pool
-   - Only a few cars left -- one of them Suzie's old  bug, at the side of which Kelly and Suzie engage in heated conversation
- paces around Kelly
You don't know Duquette
'm the one he busted
He's a fucker, man
He'll fuck us both over
Kelly tries to take her by the arm
Suzie jerks away
(') 'm not going back to that prison
That's what it was
a fucking hell hole
Kelly looks around the lot
She takes Suzie by the arm once more, this time more firmly, pulling Suzie to her
Will you calm down
Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me
You're gonna have to be ready for him
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me
You've got family and they've got clout
With we it's different
with me
(circling her with her arm) Yeah, 've got family and they've got clout and now you have me
Right
And Sam
Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere
He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it
Stay strong and he can't do shit
(a long beat) Man,  wanna smoke a joint
to  -- in the distance -- the white Ford Taurus at the side of the road leading to the school
The car is pulled just far enough off the road to be mostly hidden among pampas grass and oleander, but angled in such a way as to afford a view of the two girls now hugging in the lot
' '   - Suzie wanders along the canal, smoking a joint
At her back a few faint lights flicker here and there in the windows of trailers
She walks down to the little dock, sits on a rail, takes another hit
(0
) 'Evening, Suzie
How was school today
Suzie freezes, holds back her exhale, looking around
shadow stirs in one of the skiffs tied to the dock
man stands, walks up the couple of wooden stairs
The light from a trailer across the road glances off steel-rimmed glasses as Ray Duquette steps onto the dock
Suzie gags on the smoke in her lungs, coughs
She squeezes the lit roach into her palm, then tosses it into the canal
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie
You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser
You got something against cigarettes
Ray just laughs at her
Yeah, they're bad for your health
(beat) 'm tryin' to look out for you
That's cop bullshit
Well, you're half right
Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me
About what
Every triangle 've ever seen never lasts
Somebody's got to go
Is this supposed to mean something to me
What triangle
You, Kelly, Sam
don't have to listen to this
And you can't shove me around
have friends now
She catches herself, falters
Ray laughs once more
Is that what you think
You have friends
Is that what they told you
don't mean who you're thinking have other friends
Suzie, Suzie
This is me, Ray, you're talking to
We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit
He takes a sheet of paper from his coat
(') Here, Suzie
want you :o look this over
Know what it is
(as Suzie takes it) Sam deposited his check, transferred the funds to an offshore bank, a numbered account
Not even the cops can find out whose names are on it
Think one of them's yours
Suzie looks over the paper
(') He also put a down on some island property, and a lease-to-buy on a forty-foot sailboat
You're into sailing, aren't you, Suzie
Suzie thrusts the paper back at Ray
Get away from me
Don't you see what this means
You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money
You, the pill-head with the rap sheet
Shut up
Ray smiles at her
He moves up close
You know,  don't think  ever told you was sorry about your little friend
What was his name
Suzie tries to back away
She bumps against the rail
Ray reaches out, takes her hand in both of his
(') Come on, Suzie, help me out here
You know his name
Suzie looks scared, in a way she hasn't before
When she speaks her voice is scarcely above a whisper
Davy
(nodding, a scary smile) That's right
That was his name
The smile fades, as if he's thinking about something, still holding her hand, rubbing it with his fingers
(') Sometimes  wonder if you're really as dumb as you pretend to be
He looks into Suzie's eyes, slowly opening her hand to  the burn mark on her palm
(') But you know what
'd be keeping a clear mind right now if  were you
(beat) 'd hate to see you come to a bad end
Like Davy did
He holds her hand a moment longer, then drops it
He goes back down he steps to the little skiff
An outboard   in the night
'  - Suzie cones in fast, grabs the phone, punches out a number

) (answering machine) This is Sam
'm not in right now
/
'  - parked behind some cottonwoods in a small launch area where the highway crosses both the canal and the road to the fish camp
The skiff has been shoved into the bed
Ray sits at the wheel
He removes his glasses, wipes his face with a handkerchief, then starts at the uneven 50UNDS of a tired , looks up to see
Suzie's  bouncing along the dirt road, turning onto the highway
'  - watching, then starting his truck and pulling out onto the highway, following the tiny red lights of Suzie's bug
-   - Suzie's  idles
She leans out the window, talks to the intercom, the gate opens
The
The gate closes
Ray's pickup drives past
He drives to a big lot where one of the mansions has been torn down
He drives up onto the dirt, keeps going, right down to the water's edge where he pulls his little skiff out of the back once more
He walks back to the truck, pulls off his sport coat, hangs a Hi-8 video camera over his shoulder and wades out into the calm waters of the bay, pushing the skiff, then climbing in
,     - Suzie follows Kelly past the pool, which is all lit~up, and on toward the jacuzzi
The whole deck is tiled in black-and-white
Kelly's in a bikini -- the killer body
Suzie, the contrast -- pale, skinny, boyish, in a -shirt and cutoff jeans
They argue -- we
- Ray has arrived near the docks
He has killed his engine, maneuvering here with a single oar
He ties the skiff off behind the Jonathan, then climbs to the dock, moving around the guest house and coming close to the pool
He takes a position behind the cabanas, readies his camera
- Kelly and Suzie continue their argument in front of the jacuzzi
can't believe you called Sam
What's the matter with you
'm scared, that's what
'm scared there's no one to trust
You can trust me
cordless   on the patio chair
Kelly and Suzie are startled by it
Kelly answers
'  - The bedside lamp is on
Sam is on the phone
Kelly
Is Suzie there
(
) Yes
Shit
was afraid of that
She left this garbled message on my machine
(beat) Can you calm her down
(
0
) Why can't you come
No
Christ
Listen, Kelly, 'm counting on you
You calm her down
mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes
(
) You know what it takes
Then do it
need you on this Kelly
Do it tonight
We'll figure something out
Okay
- Kelly glances across the steamy water at Suzie
Yeah, right
Can you at least talk to her, on the phone
'  - Sam lies on his bed, waits for Suzie's voice on the line
(
) Sam
Put Kelly on too
- The girls stand cheek-to-cheek, the phone between them
'm here
'  - Okay
want you to hear this too
We've got to be cool
All of us
People think 'm rich, for Christ's sake
'm doing what rich guys do
(beat) 'm spending my money
It's more suspicious if  sit around doing nothing
Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds
- Ray tapes the scene
The girls still hold the phone
But
(
0
) Shut up
Don't fall apart
The only people who can blow this is us
Remember
Right
Suzie says nothing
Kelly nudges her
Yeah, right
(
0
) Good
Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us
The line goes dead
Kelly hangs up
Suzie stares into the jacuzzi
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you
Oh, for Christ's sake
You are
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp
Suzie's face goes hard
That's what  am to you, isn't it
Swamp trash
It's what  am to everybody, just like my mom
Kelly tries to put an arm around her
Suzie slaps her -- a mistake -- Kelly's bigger, faster
She slaps the side of Suzie's head, then grabs her legs, dumping her on the tile deck
focusing the camera
Suzie tries to kick Kelly
Something changes in Kelly, a scary, calm rage
Stupid bitch
She very methodically grabs Suzie's hair, dragging her into the jacuzzi, holding her under the hot water
Suzie thrashes, breaks free, gags, arches out of the water, the wet -shirt clinging to her small breasts
Kelly is on her again, slaps her, puts her hands to Suzie's throat -- violently sexual in her wet bikini
Kelly slams Suzie back onto the black-and-white tile, gets on top of her, knees between Suzie's legs, her hands on her throat
Suzie's skinny shape writhes underneath Kelly on the gleaming tile
She gasps for air
Kelly finally lets go, but remains on her knees between Suzie's legs, breathing hard
moment
Kelly touches Suzie's face
Why do you make me hurt you
It's like you want it or something
Suzie sobs, takes Kelly's hand
(') God, you are scared, aren't you
Suzie runs her lips over Kelly's fingers, then pushes her -shirt up, pushing Kelly's hand onto her breast
(') And this is going to make you feel better, make you trust me
Suzie nods, tearing her -shirt, getting both of Kelly's hands onto her breasts, then pushing at Kelly's wrists, getting her to pull at her nipples, hard
Kelly obliges
Suzie cries out in pain
Kelly's hands move down to pull off Suzie's bottoms
still at it with the video, his face impassive, watching
As Kelly pulls Suzie back into the jacuzzi, as the girls' hands slide round the curves of each other's hips, pulling themselves to each other, as the layers of steam rise to envelope them
: Kelly and Suzie making love in the jacuzzi
to  -- - Gloria, Ray, Hunter watch the tape
Hunter's seen enough
He slams the stop/tape
Are you crazy, Ray
You heard Kelly say "Sam
"  That was Lombardo on the phone
And you saw the girls
Ray
The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible
(beat) What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick
don't believe 'm hearing this month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse
(beat) They were acting
They were all acting, from the beginning
And we bought it, hook, line and sinker
And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life
(turning now on Gloria) What
You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter
(beat) Cone on
She bought the same story we did
Ray stops as Hunter brings the palm of his hand down on the table a loud
Listen, both of you
You're not on a case
There is no fucking case
(beat) 've had it up to here with Sandra Van Ryan
Ray, you keep mucking around like this and you are going to have her suing us for invasion of privacy
Get out of these people's lives
(beat) Am  getting through on this
Ray walks to the door, jerks it open -- - Sam, angry, sits in the corridor with a uniformed officer
Hunter sees Sam, rolls his eyes
Oh, Ray
no
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish
Question him
You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath
And those girls are going to wind up dead
Sam lunges at Ray
The officer and Hunter restrain him
Gloria looks on, taken aback by Ray's accusations, Sam's response
Mr
Lombardo, please
'm sorry about this
Give this idiot something to do
Let him look into the Kennedy assassination
Ray flares, grabs Sam, shoves him against the wall, before they can be separated once again
(') (to Hunter) Next time this guy drags me down here, 'll sue you
You're goddamn lucky didn't sue you the first time
Sam storms from the room, followed by Hunter
Ray stares after them, finally he turns, looks at Gloria, collecting himself
Guess  kind of lost it there
You could say that
Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it
Gloria studies Ray, clearly concerned
We all have
mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened
(off Gloria's silence) did that once
don't want to do it again
- Sam  a building, a large package of wrapped goods beneath his arm
He looks toward the parking lot where -- Barbara Baxter stands beside the red Mercedes
She tips a valet then starts toward the mall
She sees San
Their eyes meet moment of hesitation, as neither is quite sure what to say
You look pretty
Thanks
Sam smiles
She points to the stuff beneath his arm
(') Quite a shopping spree
She's kidding, then seems to consider how Sam might take it
(') didn't mean
Sam laughs it off
Hey, 've got it,  may as well spend it, right
've always wanted to live where  could dive for my dinner
And where might that be
was thinking, Antigua, maybe
love Antigua
(beat) Maybe 'll come visit you
'd like that
moment, she touches his face
Sam raises a hand to cover hers, as

- seated at the wheel, parks, stares toward the mall entrance
- ' Sam and Barbara stand in the orange light, hand-in-hand
Barbara leans forward, kisses Sam on the lips
lost in thought, when she is startled by a sudden  of She turns to find
Suzie's ,  and  smoke, parks next to her
Suzie opens the door of the Rover, jumps in
She's wearing a black ball cap, armed with a huge straw bag
As she settles in the seat, she lets out a long breath
Kelly makes a face, fans the air
Jesus
What are you drinking
Suzie laughs, pulls a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 from the bag
(') (looking at the bottle) Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain
What brain
Suzie takes a big drink
Kelly shakes her head, looks back toward the entrance
- ' empty
Sam and Barbara are gone
Kelly continues to stare
What are you looking at
(starting the car) Nothing
- The Atlantic rolls before a long stretch of empty sand as the last red light drains from the sky
The Range Rover comes down onto the sand, parks
/
- Kelly turns off the engine
Suzie tokes on a joint, swills the 20/20
She gazes upon the sea, eyes at half-mast
thought we were goin' to a movie
think we just need to get wasted
Suzie shrugs, gets out
Kelly gets out with her
Suzie staggers
Kelly circles her with an arm, looks nervously around, begins leading her down the beach
wanna live at the beach someday
Shit
She stops walking
Suzie takes a few more steps then turns to look at her
(') left the keys
'll get 'em
Suzie plops down on the sand, drinks from the bottle
She watches Kelly fading into the darkness, mumbles something beneath her breath, then lies on her back
'  - The  of
She rolls to one side, looking down the beach Murky blackness
She tries to focus, sits up
Kelly
She stands -- wobbly -- peers down the beach
shape  in the blackness, moving toward her
(') Kelly
The shape gets closer and closer, until
Sam Lombardo steps up to loom over Suzie
She takes a step back
Sam puts a hand on her shoulder
He carries something in his other hand -- hard to see on the dark beach
Suzie, it's okay
It's me
Suzie steadies herself
face  behind Sam -- Kelly
(') was worried about you, Suzie decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up
Are you mad at me
No, no
Look,  probably should have told you a little more, about the part intended to play
(beat) We'll go through it all again tonight
Sam takes the bottle from Suzie, looks at it
(') This is a celebration Suzie, not a suicide pact
He lifts the object in his other hand -- a champagne battle
(') We'll chill out first, have a drink, watch the stars
Suzie nods
(') Kelly, there's a beach blanket in the Jeep
Could you get it for us
Kelly nods, starts back, looks once over her shoulder as
Sam leads Suzie toward a huge rock formation
(') Let me tell you about this boat  picked out for us
They move
Kelly continues to walk, back along the sand toward the cars
- sickening hollow  -- an arc of blood and two teeth fall silently on dark stone
Kelly begins to run, stumbling through the sand to Sam's Jeep, where she pulls a big roll of clear plastic from behind the seats
She stuffs it under her arm, then runs back along the beach
As she runs, she can hear them -- more ,  -- it seems like forever Sam  before her on the sand
The champagne bottle swings loosely at the end of one arm
it looks shiny now, dripping with Suzie's blood
Kelly goes to him
She looks at the bottle, then throws herself against him -- a hard kiss
'm sorry, Kelly
'm sorry it had to happen like this
She was losing it
(breathless) There was no way
That cop would've gotten her to tell him
everything
She was weak and dumb
She kisses him again, her hands moving over his body
Sam takes a step back, looks into Kelly's face -- the parted lips, sultry eyes -- as if seeing her for the first time -- a long beat -- at which point he turns, heaving the champagne bottle as far as he can into the black waves
- Rear hatch open -- overhead light on
Sam and Kelly drag Suzie's body -- wrapped in the plastic -- to the rear hatch
As they heft her inside, the light catches -- ' mask of blood
Kelly turns away in disgust
She goes to the passenger side door, gets in
Sam gets in behind the wheel
For a moment the two of them just sit there, in the darkness, with the  of the , and their own
Sam looks at Kelly
She is focused on the dark Atlantic
Are you okay
Kelly turns to him -- an anxious face
(a long beat) My mom would kill me if she knew  took the Rover
- Kelly waits by the Rover, swatting mosquitoes
-- a shape approaches in the dark -- Sam in waders, muddy, tired, carrying a shovel
- Almost empty of cars
The Range Rover cruises past Suzie's , circles, comes back
Sam jumps out, pulls on latex gloves, gets into the  and backs it out
() - Almost dawn
long parking lot fronts the terminal
Suzie's arrives, parks, Sam gets out
He goes to the waiting Range Rover, gets in and drives away
-    - flows beneath the gate, down the drive, toward the street
touches the water
to  the hand as that of Ray Duquette
- Ray kneels, fingers wriggling in the water, then straightens, looking toward the house where
On the other side of the gate, Kelly, in a tube-top and tight shorts, washes mud from the Range Rover
She looks up, sees
Ray, drying his hand on a handkerchief, walking up the drive, arriving at the wrought-iron gates
Been four-wheelin'
Kelly freezes -- not so cool this time
Get off my property
'm not on your property
He grabs the wrought-iron gate -- rattles it -- harder and harder
Kelly backs away, frightened
' '   - Gloria and Ray stand in front of the ramshackle wooden building, talking to Ruby
Walter sits nearby, sharpening a knife
You say she didn't come back last night
She's been sayin' she was going to go to But  don't know
mean all her clothes are still here
An' she's missin' her graduation
(a long beat) She should graduate
She's a smart girl
Ray nods
He makes a note in his pad
May have been she just partied too much
But we'll look into it
We find something, you'll be the first to know
Ray turns and walks to the car
Gloria follows
- Ray sits for a moment behind the wheel
It's starting, Gloria
This is how it begins
Ray
We don't know anything yet
She could be anywhere
Ray silences her with a look
'm gonna take you back to the office
Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me
You have someplace to be
Ray starts the car, doesn't answer
(') If you want company
Just check out the car
Gloria nods
She looks toward the camp store where the old lady can still be  standing on the porch, beneath the jawbones
- Caps and gowns -- kids and parents on the lawn -- taking photos
Kelly poses with Sandra
Tom Baxter aims the camera
Smile
Kelly and Sandra force miserable smiles
(') That's one for the scrapbook
Baxter moves away, greets Nicole and her parents
Kelly puts some room between her and Sandra
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me
'm here to congratulate my friends and their children
'm leaving again tonight
Don't bother
'm taking a trip
Where, the mall
friend of mine bought a boat
Sandra shakes her head, walks off
Kelly turns away, freezes, as she catches sight of -- Ray talking with Jimmy
- Ray and Jimmy walk along the sand, moving in the direction of the big rocks
Jimmy wears sagger shorts, a surfer -shirt
Ray wears a suit
He carries the coat over his shoulder
It's those rocks, up there
You and Suzie used to come out here together
Yeah, sometimes
Lots of the kids hang out here
(beat) You really think something bad happened to Suzie
(ignoring the question) Lombardo ever come out here
Jimmy looks at him, surprised, sees that Ray is serious
Still, the idea generates a laugh
(') say something funny
No
But  mean
just the idea that Mr
Lombardo would
Way  hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys
Yeah, but
He breaks off as Ray kneels over a big flat rock
Ray brushes away some sand, drapes the sport coat over his arm, taking tweezers and latex gloves from the pockets
Jimmy moves closer, curious, seeing what Ray sees
as tweezers pick up two teeth from a crevice in the stone
Ray straightens, holding the teeth in the palm of his hand
Jimmy stares at the teeth
Ray takes a couple of bills from his pocket, hands them to Jimmy
'm going to be staying here, Jimmy
You can catch a bus up there at the lot, okay
Jimmy looks a little sick, but he takes the money
He starts toward the lot
Ray watches for a moment
Then calls out to him
People aren't always what they appear to be, kid
Remember it
Jimmy looks at him, trying to make sense of what Ray is saying, clearly disturbed by the implications
But he asks no more questions
He turns, trudging alone back through the sand
: - go into a plastic bag
Black-and-whites, county cars -- police tape across the site
Ray, Gloria and Hunter watch as  , a forensic expert bags the teeth
He passes the bag to Ray, then bends to the rocks where he begins to take a blood sample
Lonbardo and Kelly killed her here
Hunter and Gloria exchange a look
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth
Where's the body
The swamp, most likely
Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there
But he's made a mistake
He holds up the evidence bag containing the teeth
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away
And  found the car at the Miami bus terminal
You don't think Sam could've put it there
Dust it for prints
My guess is, if anybody murdered Suzie it was probably that little sociopath Kelly Van Ryan
Ray shakes his head; he turns to Dave, still working
How soon can we get something
We can get blood type right away
Dental records will take longer
You want , that can take weeks
Ray nods, looks out to sea
(') Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance
We don't know that, Ray
Ray turns to her -- an intense look
Kelly's next, Gloria
(ice cold) Get off this Ray, now
(beat) If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide
(turning to Dave) You get an , you call me
Dave nods
Hunter stalks off toward his car
Ray turns to Gloria
Will you do me one favor
Ray, you heard him
What if 'm right, Gloria
What if 'm right and Hunter's wrong
(beat) What do you do if you see a bad thing coming
Gloria looks toward the highway, trying to decide
(') Stick with me on this Gloria
need you
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's
You'll give this up
If 'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise
- Sam's Jeep -- a " " sign in the window -- sits in the lot
Across the road -- Gloria sits in the white Taurus
,   - Ray sits in his truck, picks up his cellular, punches in a number
(
) (speaker) Merritt, Forensics
The teeth doin' any talkin'
(
0
) Ray
Stop calling
told you the dental records will take time
What about the blood
(
0
) (a beat) Could be hers
Types match
Could be a lot of other people's too
(cutting him off) Second you get something on those teeth, want it Ray hangs up without waiting for a reply
He turns to the Van Ryan house, an orange light slanting across its facade
- Gloria waits in her car
She looks toward the motel
Sam's Jeep is parked before one of the bungalows
There is a light on in the room
We can  inside
Gloria sighs, picks up a pair of binoculars and trains them on the room
- ' Suitcases and boxes are stacked everywhere
Sam, bare-chested, in khaki slacks, moves about the room
watching Sam, as
The  has begun to
Sam looks at it until it stops, then picks it up and dials a number
Kelly answers
(
) Hello
Hello
(
) God, 've been calling you
- / Kelly is in the guest house, pacing in front of the gun case
'm really serious
That cop, he keeps watching me
Duquette
Forget him
can't help it
He gives me the creeps
mean why was Suzie so scared of him
She's not that way
think he did something
Yeah, he got her busted for possession
don't know
think it was something else
Suzie says the bust was bullshit
And you believe her
(a long beat -- a sigh) don't know
(beat) want to see you
Kelly
Relax
Take one of your mom's valium or something
In another week you get on the plane
It's over
We're rich
But what if they find out
God, they'd put you in the gas chamber
Sam is about to respond, then looks out the window, sees
, the white Taurus
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead
Stay in the guest house
Skip the graduation parties
You'll never see Duquette
Okay
love you
(beat) Okay
love you too
-  - sees the light go out in Sam's room, lowers her binoculars, sits for a moment, then begins to write something on a pad
She's still at it when something  at a
She looks up, startled, to find
Sam in the street, still shirtless, his arms and shoulders back-lit by the neon light of the Glades Motel
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows
(a long beat) Suzie Toller is missing
Sam lets out his breath, shakes his head
How long
She didn't cone home last night
We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket
Maybe she used another name
Ray thinks she was murdered
Sam shakes his head once more
don't know what to say
You could tell me where you were last night
Sam stares at her
Goddannit
don't have to
He stops himself, calms down
Come here
want you to see something
Gloria hesitates, looks up at Sam, then puts down the phone and opens her door
- Sam and Gloria walk among the boxes and suitcases
Looks like goodbye
Sam nods
He goes to one of his cardboard filing boxes, pulls out a file, hands it to Gloria
As she takes it, he goes to the closet, takes a shirt from a hanger
Kelly's file
Read it
You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify
Suzie
Sam shrugs
You're telling me Ray thinks Suzie was killed
don't have to ask you who he thinks did it, do
(beat) All 'm saying is, read that, you'll have a new perspective on things
Gloria sits on the bed, the file in her hand
She watches as Sam pulls on the shirt
Why didn't you tell us about this before the trial
Sam holds her eyes
Then --  still had ethical standards to protect
They meant a lot to me
Now, don't care
And no amount of money can buy that back
Sam is interrupted by the  of a
He looks outside
- ' taxi waits in the glow of the green neon
Sam looks down on Gloria, seated on his bed, her skirt short enough to  shapely legs
For a moment the two hold one another's eyes
(') My ride
If you're not planning on arresting me, that is
'  -  - The
Ray picks it up
Ray
What's happening
- / She's still in Sam's room, the file spread across the bed
'm tired, Ray
'm going home
Where's Lombardo
He's leaving the country
And  don't give a shit
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's
It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it
'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray
If Suzie is dead,  think Hunter may be on the right track
Ray clicks off his phone
(') Ray
(nothing but dial tone) Shit
Ray
,   - Ray gets out of his car, presses the intercom
(
) (intercom) Who is it
(into intercom) Detective Duquette, Ms
Van Ryan
Let me in
Now

Where is she
Where she lives
In the guest house
Now will you tell me what this is about
'm placing your daughter under arrest
You can't
(turning, cutting her off) Suzie Toller is dead
You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice
Stay out of my way
- cap and gown lay strewn on the sofa
Kelly wears jeans and a bra
She looks up to see Ray moving across the tile
Her eyes go wide, then move to the gun case
- Sandra stands near the jacuzzi, not exactly sure what to do, watching as

It swings open
He steps inside

The guest house door opens
Ray stumbles out, his shoulder bloody, a

man in white shorts reclines in a beach chair, beneath a gaily-colored umbrella, sipping a drink
- Kelly went crazy, started screaming grabbed her, put her on the floor
-   - Sam, in white shorts, looking good, watches a beautiful island girl in a thong bikini frolic in the surf
She seems to sense Sam watching, turns toward the beach
Her eyes meet Sam's
She breaks into a beautiful smile
- (
) She bit you
Bit, scratched
But  had her pinned
She calmed down
was going to cuff her
She said she thought she was going to be sick
She asked to use the bathroom
- Sam and the island girl sit at an outdoor table
The girl wears a short, terry cloth robe, Sam the white shorts and a flowered shirt
They sip drinks
Their eyes meet
Their fingers touch
- told her  was coming with her
She nodded, like she understood
We stood up together
(
) You didn't cuff her
She looked shaky, but lucid
thought, would just go with her, stand at the door

split second
Then, bingo
Just like that
She puts a knee into my groin
(beat) There was this coffee table between us and the wall
She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case
Thing had a glass door
could hear it breaking
(beat) didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough
Before  could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun

She got off a shot

returned fire
Two rounds,  think
In the chest

) Suzie Toller's
And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass
( ) - Brilliant sun on turquoise water
few boats anchored in a lagoon
quiet place
Heading out -- a forty-foot sloop, Sam at the helm
- Gloria, Baxter, a tearful Sandra, sit in seats, watch as -- Ray stands before a panel,  ,   in uniform, Hunter
Ray wears a suit, his hair neatly trimmed
His arm is no longer in a sling, but one of his hands is still bandaged
Detective Duquette; our investigation concludes that this was a good shooting
But that's irrelevant
You were not assigned to this case -- whatever you imagined this case to be
And now two young women are dead
You are terminated with forfeiture of pension and benefits
Ray looks at the floor
Hunter coughs
His hands rest on a file -- we  the video cassette inside -- labeled "/  --
" Suzie Toller's teeth and blood were found near the area known as Stoner Rocks
Suzie's blood was found in the Van Ryan Range Rover
This, in conjunction with evidence obtained by Detectives Duquette and Perez has led this office to the conclusion that Susan Marie Toller was murdered by Kelly Lanier Van Ryan
Sandra chokes back a sob
She gets to her feet, to be led from the room by Tom Baxter
Gloria Perez watches, a sad look in her eye, then turns to look at Ray
His back is to her -- the broad shoulders, expensive suit
His hands are clasped behind his back
: - '  - Gloria stands among a considerable number of mourners
She is just back from Sandra and Tom Baxter, who, in turn, are just back from the open grave
As Gloria watches, Sandra looks off to the side, where something catches her eye
Gloria sees her start, then follows her gaze
- ' On a rise some fifty yards from the Van Ryan plot, two people stand near an old oak -- Ruby and Walter
When Gloria looks back at Sandra, it seems to her as if the woman has slumped against Tom Baxter, who now stares at the two people on the rise as if, by doing so with sufficient intensity, he might make them disappear
Gloria turns to the grave site, her eye lingers on the open grave, then moves to the huge marker which dominates the Van Ryan family plot and, in fact, the entire scene
The angel Gabriel, trumpet in hand, carved in relief upon a huge obelisk of black marble
Beneath the angel is a carved scroll and upon it the words: "      ," and below that:  " " : - Sam Lombardo walks along a moonlit lagoon, headed toward a lone bungalow
The bungalow is simple, picturesque -- whitewashed walls, a thatched roof
patio opens onto the beach
- As Sam steps in off the sand, he sees something and stops short
Wet spots lead toward the bungalow
Sam listens
Everything is quiet
- Sam  in a room lit only by the blue light of a large aquarium
He listens once more, hears it --
He moves down a short hallway, observes the light which spills from beneath a bedroom door
He pushes it open, goes inside
- He  the room
The bathroom door is ajar, the room leaking steam
- Sam steps inside, looks at the shower stall -- an indistinct shape moves there in the steam
San watches, then jerks open the shower door
The steam clears --  a tall, athletic body, and now the face -- Ray Duquette, grinning at Sam out of the swirling steam
Buy you a drink
San takes a step back
Jesus
wasn't expecting you 'til tomorrow
Ray turns off the water, steps out of the stall, wrapping himself in a towel
There's a fresh, raised scar across one shoulder and Ray winces a little as he tucks the towel about his waist
He looks at himself in the mirror, touching the scar
Nice girlfriend you had there
Sam just looks at him
Yeah, well, you fixed that
(beat) What the hell happened, anyway
The bitch shot me, is what happened
Sam shakes his head, walks back into the bedroom
Ray follows
(') Hey, what did you want me to do, die
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something
You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake
Now Ray just looks at Sam, his eyes narrowing
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle
(off Sam's silence) Jesus, man
It couldn't have worked out better
They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie
can't talk 'em out of it
(beat) We should be celebrating
This thing worked out just like you said, only better
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed
(beat) What 'm telling you is,  don't like surprises
Ray walks to a dresser where a bottle of champagne sits in a bucket of ice
He opens the bottle, fills two glasses
He hands one of the glasses to Sam
Every cloud has a silver lining, partner
Here's to no loose ends
He raises his glass in a toast
Sam looks at it, then raises his glass as well
Ray smiles
Sam doesn't
Here's to no more surprises
Ray shrugs
The two men's eyes meet
They touch glasses and drink
() - Sam and Ray work on the deck of Sam's sloop, stowing gear, loading supplies
The boat's mast shines in the sunlight before a brilliant sky
Palms sway
The men work in silence
' '   - Gloria drives up in the white Taurus
She parks before the ramshackle old building and the gator pen
Walter is in the pen
Ruby stands just outside of it
She looks toward the road as Gloria gets out, then back to the pen
Gloria comes down the bank to stand beside Ruby
She's just in time to see the huge old reptile raise itself, hissing, on its front legs, jaws sprung wide
The women watch as Walter sticks his arm into the gator's mouth
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit
They see out the sides
(beat) That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway
Then  guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye
(loud enough for Walter to hear) He don't use it for no good deeds anyway
Walter looks at the ladies, picks up the stick and sweeps it between the gaping jaws, which snap in its wake
(') You come all the way out here to watch Walter
was wondering if  could ask you a few questions
About Suzie
Actually,  was wondering if  might ask you about Ray Duquette
(a long beat) He used to come around here
He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades
Ruby nods toward the motel, a bitter smile on her face
(') Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear
She still work there
No
Not after that night
(a long beat) don't know what happened
Maybe he caught her with some john
All  know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy
Indian kid named Davy
Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car
Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night
(beat) It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away
That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette
Was there ever any kind of investigation
Ruby cuts her off with a short laugh
Duquette always claimed the kid was dusted, came after him with a knife
But it was Jack's Fish Camp
This could be the moon for all most people care
(a long beat) Wasn't supposed to be like that though
This place was supposed to be something once
There were going to be roads and houses
There was going to be a town
They were going to call it Salt Creek
- From the surface of the sea -- the emerald island in the distance
The bow of the sloop comes
On board -- Sam stands in the cockpit, at the helm
Ray lounges on the deck
The boat sails easily before the wind
Ray
you see that winch by your head
Take a couple of turns on it for me, she's luffing
Ray cranes his neck to look at the winch
You mean this thing
Yes, we call it a winch
(pointing at pieces of the rigging) And these are shrouds, and these are stays
thought this was supposed to be a vacation
Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat
Come on, man
'll make a sailor out of you yet
Yeah, or get me drowned
Ray kneels
He begins to tighten the winch
Sam watches him for a moment, then reaches around behind his back to unhook the short line which holds the boom
The mainsail catches wind, swinging the boom in a wide arc, directly at Ray
Ray looks up, sees it coming just in time to catch it on his arm
The blow is enough to send him sprawling through the lifelines, where he just manages to grab one of the nylon cords
Sam ducks as the boon continues to swing erratically above the deck, watching as Ray hauls himself on board
The boat no longer driven by the wind, bobs up and down on a small ground swell
The two men face each other
Jesus, man
You okay
That how you planned it
You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean
Come off it, man
It was an accident
Ray nods, then reaches down, pulls off the winch handle and starts with it toward Sam
Sam looks around
He jerks open a storage compartment diver's weight belt tumbles out
Sam grabs it, swings it over his head in circles, letting the weight pick up momentum, preparing to throw
Ray crouches, still brandishing the winch handle
The boom sweeps the deck
Sam throws the belt
Ray grabs a shroud, dances out of the way, then steadies himself, a mean grin spreading across his face
There's no tine for Sam to look for anything else
Ray moves quickly across the deck -- a menacing sight -- tall, well-muscled, the handle gleaming in his hand
Sam pulls himself out of the cockpit
Ray jumps in
But that's as far as he gets
--  spear pierces Ray's thigh
He screams, goes down, the handle skittering across the deck
Ray follows it with his eyes, reaching out, then freezing as he sees something else
He draws in his hand as if bitten
You
You're
He scuttles backward, pulling himself onto the deck, clutching at his leg which squirts blood as if an artery has been severed
But his eyes never leave the hatchway leading belowdecks
(') You're dead
for godsake
The boat heels over
The spear in Ray's thigh bangs against the edge of the cockpit
He grimaces in pain as
Suzie Toller steps up from belowdecks
She's wearing a bikini and showing a nice tan
She's carrying Sam's new spear gun, a fresh spear at the ready
Rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated
(to Sam) Nice move
Good thing  was here to save your incompetent ass
Sam secures the boom
Ray stares at Suzie, his face twisted with some combination of pain, rage and fear
You
should've killed you myself
should never have left it up to him
Shoulda, coulda, woulda
(to Sam) Get him in the water
San starts for Ray
Sam, for Christ's sake
Sam's feet slide in the bloody smear
He stops
Ray clings to a safety line
can't
--  second spear penetrates Ray's shoulder
He loses his grip
The boat heels over, dumping Ray into the water
Suzie puts down her spear gun
She goes to a storage locker, takes out a bait bucket
She steps up on the deck
Ray is floating not far from the boat, the water going red around him
He calls out
Sam, for godsake
Hey, Ray
Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's
She raises the bucket, heaves bloody chum into the water
(') like these joint survivorship accounts
Something unfortunate happens to one of the signatories, the others don't have to worry
Are you worrying, Ray
She heaves more chum -- a big red slurp across Ray's face
Ray gasps, goes under, thrashing around in the red slick
(') Men, use 'em abuse 'em lose 'em
- from underwater, in a frenzy, rip a human body into a bloody cloud
- Suzie cones up from below with a champagne bottle and glasses, already filled
Feeling better
Sam gazes out to sea
That was about as grim as it gets
The guy was history when he killed Kelly
You knew that
But then you knew what he was like all along
Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on
But then it is better this way, don't you think
No loose ends
Sam just looks at her
(') What
That was the same thing Ray said
Suzie smiles -- showing the big gap where her two front teeth used to be
Poor Ray
(a beat) Come on Sam, we did it
We put the screws to the Van Ryans
We won
She hands a glass to Sam, takes the other
He puts it to his lips, suddenly hesitates, thinks, sniffs the glass
moment
Suzie shakes her head
(') Talk about paranoid
Now are you gonna teach me to sail this big old boat or not
Sam downs his drink
Okay
Grab that winch there
Suzie gives him a pouty look
(') What's wrong
Fuck the winch
wanna drive
Sam sighs
Okay
Come here and take the helm
'll get the winch
Suzie gives him her best, gap-toothed smile, then comes forward to take the gleaming chrome wheel, as Sam scrambles up on deck, kneeling where Ray had kneeled before him to set the jib
Suzie watches -- a long beat, then, slowly reaches behind her, unhooking the line which holds the boom
sweeping the deck -- coming right at us, blotting out the sky
' - '  - Gloria sits on Suzie's bed, books spread out around her
Ruby stands beside her
You asked if Suzie knew about the Salt Creek land deal
Girl read every book she could find on it, the Van Ryans too
Ruby takes a photo album from among the books, opens it, tosses a photograph on the bed
It is one we have seen before
stately old gentleman in a three-piece suit
White hair, a white handlebar mustache
derby on his knee, a walking stick at his side
He stares out at the world from a high-backed wicker chair, flanked by potted palms and two small terriers
Across the bottom of the picture is the name -- " "  And beside that, in another hand -- "Dear old Dad
" Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here
He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes
One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp
(indicating the photo) That came with her
And the child
She had it, before she drank herself to death
Wasn't exactly a love child
Suzie
(beat) Then you're not her grandmother
Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child
(beat) He was a good boy, till the army took him
Gloria looks once more at the old photograph
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters
And the other girl, Kelly
Suzie's niece
Gloria stands, a little weary
Ruby walks her from the room
Thank you for talking to me, Ruby
am sorry about Suzie, she
They have gotten to the main room and Gloria stops short, noticing for the first time that the beat-up old black-and-white has been replaced by a high-tech, giant-screen television
You okay
'm fine
Nice
The old lady nods, walks her outside
' '   - The dusty road, the little dock, the gator pen
There's an old saying from the Everglades -- virtue may be missed but sin can't hide
(a long beat) Folks pay in the end
Gloria nods
She is distracted by a movement in the gator pen
For a moment there is nothing more than a few ripples across the surface of the pond which lies inside the pen, then, slowly, the '  -- cold, reptilian, unblinking, rising up to gaze across the oily waters
: for about ten seconds, enough to fool the audience, then
-
' , or   ' , in reverse chronological order
- Kelly is frantically trying to unlock the gun case as Ray comes through the French doors
She can't get it done
He's there in an instant
She screams, backs away, then watches as Ray stops, wraps a hanky around his hand and breaks the glass
He takes out a small caliber handgun, checks the clip, aims the gun at his own shoulder and fires
--   -- then - Jeep and a truck parked in the mud
Sam and Ray meet under heavy, moss-draped cypress
Sam hands Ray a plastic bag -- the teeth
You know the place 'm talking about -- the big rocks
--   -- then - & behind the big rocks
He's got vise-grip pliers jammed in her mouth
Suzie moans, for real
He loosens his grip
You've got the pressure too tight
You'll crush the fucking evidence
Sam takes a breath, prepares to try again
Suzie pops a couple of pills with gulps of wine
Sam goes to it once more
--   -- then '  - Kelly and Sam on the floor, naked
He's on her from the rear
It's getting wild
He suddenly stops, rolls to the floor
We gotta stop
'm gonna come
Kelly laughs, straddles him
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades
That's not your line
Say you love me
(a beat) love you
Now give me the line
(a whiny voice) No little girl can ever make me come
--   -- then - Suzie's  is parked across the street, in the shadows of tall trees
She and Sam sit inside, watching as
Ray Duquette  a bungalow, a sport coat over his arm
He heads for Jim's Recovery Room
In another moment, a young hooker in a leather miniskirt walks out of the same bungalow
Seems to like some of the same places you do
Funny you never met
Yeah, real funny
You're wrong about this,  could get busted on the spot
Trust me, the guy's dirty
He'll like it
Especially the part about offing me
(beat) Now get out of here
Go make yourself a new friend
'   - Ray is at the bar
Sam sits down next to him
moment of silence, the twang of a country   -- then
Buy you a drink
--   -- then '  - Suzie Toller framed in the doorway
She walks in
You like bein' a caddy for rich kids' problems
Sam just looks at her
(') 've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it
(beat) What if  told you  had a way we could get a big piece of it back
We
Well, 'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already
She takes an envelope from her notebook, tosses it in front of Sam
Pictures slide onto his desk -- Sam and Kelly -- in various poses of coked-out debauchery at the Glades Motel
(white-faced) How
Walter
He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years
saw these,  knew he'd finally struck gold
(beat) can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass
What do you think, Mr
Lombardo
(a long beat) think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them
--   -- then '   - Sam lounges in a booth
He looks hot, bored
He stirs a drink
Kelly walks in out of the light
She is looking a little strung out, a big straw bag slung over one shoulder, but oh, so sexy in skimpy cutoffs and cowboy boots -- long legs flashing as she nears Sam's booth
Sam looks up, as
'm running away
(a beat) You think that's wise
(sitting next to him) Um-huh
And guess what else
(reaching into her bag) have toys
She takes out a snail bag of white powder, taps out a line on the table top
Sam looks at it
He looks at Kelly
He's had a few drinks
(a long beat) Well,  guess one taste wouldn't hurt
The seal comes up
It's over
They head for the lobby -- but -- ' '   - Gloria stands beneath the jawbones, looking toward the channel as the shadows lengthen across the dirt road
Walter hangs a " " sign on a small, shabby sloop
Gloria  the road
Selling your boat
Walter shoots her a look
This was Suzie's boat
Guess she won't be needin' it
wouldn't have guessed Suzie was a sailor
Walter finishes with the sign
Old lady had her tested once
They said her  was way up there, round two hundred or some such shit
(beat) That girl could do just about anything, she put her mind to it
Gloria has nothing to say
She stares at the little sloop bobbing in the muddy water of the swamp
-   -   - head bobs among the groundswells
- sucking wind through a smashed face, struggling to stay afloat, as
in the distance, the sloop races toward a far horizon
- Suzie, at the helm, looking good, face to the wind
