",  & " Screenplay by Roger Hedden Based on a play by Roger Hedden : - three levels of escalators transporting a smattering of Southwestern shoppers -- some in cowboy hats
of shoppers being conveyed up and down
: - beautiful vista -- cacti and sage dot the landscape as it rises to mountains in the distance
revealing an island of modern culture -- malls and more malls, parking lots, and fast food franchises
: , brown Pinto pulls out of a parking lot and into rush hour traffic
- is driving
She looks younger, but she's twenty- eight
She has a strong face and flashing intelligent eyes
She's wearing a   from Friendly's
She's deep in thought
Beth pulls up to stoplight and stops
:  gentle toot of car horn
Beth looks up, startled
' , a pleasant looking twenty-four year old, is in a pick- up truck next to her
He smiles and points up toward the traffic light
She looks up toward the traffic light
They're red except for one with a lit green arrow
She pantomimes that she's in the wrong lane and wants to go straight
Sid pantomimes that he'll let her cut in front of him
: Horns honk impatiently
Beth pulls away in front of the pick-up truck
The continues
Sid looks back at the honking car, cheerfully waves to it
: '  - tiny well-kept Spanish style home in lower middle class residential section
'   - It's neat and smartly furnished -- discount Swedish modern, framed deco posters, some nice plants
The only problem is it seems a little more like a well-designed waiting room than a home
There's an empty ice bucket, several empty liquor bottles, and a swinging metal ball thingabobby on a chrome and glass coffee table in front of leather sofa
are curled up together on the sofa, drinks in hand
They're both in their late twenties
Carol's dressed in the casually stylish clothes worn by women who work in shopping mall boutiques
Nick's clothes are frumpled, a knit tie loose around his neck
They've achieved a state of contemplative drunkenness
Carol sips her drink
Nick sips his drink
Carol sips her drink
Nick brings his glass to his lips, hesitates
(flatly) We're moving
What
(enunciating) We're going to move
(after a beat) When
Two days
In two days
Yeah
Carol shakes her head in weary disbelief
(covering her hurt) Thanks for the news
She knocks back her drink
Nick broods
haven't known for long
just decided
(ruminating) What do  need that makes me make these decisions
Carol stares at him
He knocks back his drink
You got me
She pours herself another drink
What does Beth say
Beth
: '  - She stops at an intersection
(
) Whatever makes me happy
That's what she says
Headlights flash from behind her
She turns and looks
' Sid's smiling from his truck right behind her
He flashes his lights again
' Beth looks up in the rearview mirror, amused
Sid turns off, disappearing into the night
Surprised to find herself vaguely disappointed, she drives on
: '  - It's small, prefab, and tidy
It has a counter with shutters that open onto the living room
Nick is kneeling, going through bottles in a cabinet
(w/ drunken desperation) know this place
Nick stands, with an almost empty bottle of Johnny Walker Red
know what happens here
He pours himself a drink
Carol shuts the cabinet
know what's going to happen
Nick opens a cabinet under the sink and tosses the empty bottle in the trash
He begins to pace
Carol shuts the cabinet and follows him with her gaze
As Nick speaks, he gestures grandly with his drink, liquor splashing unnoticed over the sides
(bursting with frustration) The same job, same scenery, same people
've been in this town for years
Years
(flatly) Three years
(in despair) Oh, Carol
know
He stops and slugs back his drink
Forever -- it seems forever
: '  - Beth pulls up to a stoplight, her face blank with thought
She's suddenly lit by the flash of headlights going on and off
She looks up and smiles
- Sid's pick-up truck is facing her across the intersection
It slowly pulls up beside her and stops
He smiles and gives a little wave of his hand
Without knowing why, she smiles and waves back
(sweetly but firmly) Good-bye
She drives away
Sid stares after her
: '   - Carol lifts the end metal ball on the thingabobby and releases it, starting the chain reaction
She stares at it clacking back and forth as she speaks
How long a drive is it
Nick paces
Fourteen hours
That's not bad
In a car
It's a fuckin' nightmare
Carol stops the metal ball
She releases two balls, starting a new chain reaction
(griping) And there's no radio in Utah
It's all religious programs
Get saved
Nick slumps on the sofa beside her
(flatly) No thanks
Hey
Think about this
You take a detour and go through Vegas -- you and Beth stop, see a show, have a nice romantic dinner -- play the slots, get the free drinks
(interrupting) Too much money
The show
The meal
The slots
Then the hotel -- that's another hundred down the toilet
As Carol speaks she pokes at Nick
He fends off her blows
By the end of her speech she is on top of him mock-strangling him
(jabbing Nick) No, you skip the hotel
It's night, the highway's empty -- you can make good time
You start speeding
You get stopped in Utah by the cops -- you flunk the breathalizer, they haul you in
The judge is Mormon -- you get fifteen years, you go to prison, but at least your life has taken a direction
Nick and Carol collapse into laughter
The front door opens
(calling in) 'm here
Beth steps in
Carol quickly lets go of Nick's neck and gets off him
Embarrassed, they both smile self-consciously
There's an awkward instant followed by too much cheerfulness
(chipper) Hi
Hi, honey
Hi
stands in the doorway, awkwardly conscious of having interrupted something
(w/ forced cheer) Hi
: - Nick and Beth are standing in the lawn, lit by the glow of the porch lamp
Both sides of the street are lined with nearly identical tiny faux Spanish houses
'night
Carol waves
'night
, , (calling out) Pizza Hut, tomorrow
Okay
(to Beth) 've got the short shift -- you want me to come over, help pack
Great
'm really sorry we didn't tell you sooner
He just decided
smiles to herself, a trace of sadness in her eyes
understand
She shuts the door
She starts to walk across the lawn
She stops and stares at Nick, who's staring out into the night, oblivious to her
'm tired
'm going to bed
He turns and looks at her
What's your problem
haven't got a problem
Okay
He walks up to her and past her -- when she doesn't fall into step, he stops
You agreed to try Billings
know
(in Nick's words) Billings, Montana
City of the future
Yeah and  read that a while ago -- so the future's probably already there
She smiles and shakes her head
(defensively) It's not like you're leaving anything behind
good job or something
Just some friends
He puts his arms around her waist from behind, and nestles her against his body
You'll make new friends
know
(after a beat) 'm not eight years old
know 'll make new friends
Then what is it
She pulls away from him and starts walking to the house next door
He falls into step with her
(uncomfortably) , umm
It embarrasses me
When you talk about something with Carol that happened before me
She's my best friend
It embarrasses me that you used to live with her
That was years ago
Three years
That's right
know
And we're moving
She won't be your best friend anymore
They arrive at their front door
Beth takes out her keys
Nick stops her hand and kisses her
She kisses him back
Living with someone isn't such a big deal
She nods and looks to the lock
Anyway
live with you now
Beth looks to Nick
He stares out at the night
: -: - The coffee-maker clock hits nine o'clock
The coffee maker clicks on with a rattle
Steam starts to spew out
The coffee-maker makes horrible gurgling sounds
- The kitchen is small and a little grimy, its furnishings fatigued
Nick stares at the coffee-maker in disbelief
He's dressed in a dress shirt, untied necktie, and slacks
He's carrying a sportscoat with a Sears' employee name-tag attached
(calling out) Beth
Beth
Beth walks into the kitchen, wearing a robe and carrying the paper
Nick points accusingly at the coffee maker as water pours down from around its top
It's
it's raining
It does that
She drops the paper on the kitchen table and gets a mug off the counter
Since we got it
No
(pouring herself a cup) Lately
(throwing his jacket on a chair) Shit
(agitated) What's wrong with it
Water comes out
Shit
(unplugging the coffee maker) hate this shit
It never kept the coffee hot
And now this
He angrily wraps the cord around the coffee-maker
(blowing on her coffee) It still works
(adamant) No
It doesn't
Water comes out
Okay
She sips her coffee
She flips open a box of Dunkin' Donuts
could've gotten a new one
On my discount
Now it's too late
Do you want a donut
(exasperated) No
want an appliance that works
Beth shrugs and takes a donut out of the box
She leans against the counter, eating the donut
Nick walks past Beth and jams the coffee maker into the trash
This coffee maker was junk
Nick pushes a button on the blender
It makes a horrible He unplugs it
This blender's junk
Our t
v
is junk
He jams the blender into the trash
don't know why we're even bothering to pack
(through a mouthful of donut) You got me
The t
v
gets no channels
And it's fifteen inch
(shaking his head) can't believe we don't have a big t
v
We don't watch much
But at our age
They stare at each other
Nick picks the almost full pint bottle of scotch off the counter and puts it in his jacket pocket
Beth takes another donut
Why don't you take one
'm not hungry
(offhandedly) Not a donut
t
v
Take a t
v
It's your last day
Like a bonus
Yeah
: '  - Beth is holding a donut and her coffee mug
Nick tosses his jacket into the front seat of his old sedan
might do it
say do it
(after a beat) Sears can afford to give you a bonus
Maybe they are
What do you mean
Maybe when  get my check today, there'll be a bonus in it
(evenly) Nick
They fired you
Yeah
(flatly) There's no bonus
Yeah
That's true
(shaking his head) And  sold a lot of teevees for them
Beth sips her coffee, waiting for Nick to decide
(calmly) You should take a t
v
Nick looks at his watch
should go
(sarcastically) Don't wanna be late on my last day
He kisses Beth, surprising her
He presses against her
He takes the donut from her hand and takes a bite
Beth kisses Nick, his mouth still full of donut
Mmmmm
He kisses her fully, then breaks the kiss
gotta go
: - About hundred cars dot the vast parking lot
Nick swings into a parking spot and gets out of the car
He tosses his jacket on the roof and crouches, tieing his necktie using the car's outside mirror
' You livin' in your car or what
'  - , a big redheaded guy in his late thirties, wearing a jacket and tie, is grinning at the crouched Nick
Nick's reflection grins back
Just waiting for the last second to put on the noose
(tightening the tie) So Chip -- what's new
Nick straightens up and grabs his jacket
They start walking toward the mall
Nothing much
(broaching the subject) heard you're leaving
Yeah
'm outta here
They approach the employees entrance
They can you
That's what they think
Yeah
was gonna quit anyway -- this way get unemployment
Good deal
Nick opens the door
Yeah
recession insurance
(Chip enters) This way 'm not stuck waiting around for the lay-offs to start
Nick follows Chip in
(a hint of panic) Lay-offs
The door shuts behind him
: - - The front page of the Phoenix Sun-Times -- the headline reads "Misery Index Soars"
Beth's hand comes   and crumples the page
- Beth stuffs the paper in a glass and wraps the glass in another piece
She's sitting on the floor, surrounded by dishes, newspaper, and cardboard liquor boxes
She adds the wrapped glass to a box
She hears the  of a   , looks up, then returns to her packing
She reaches behind herself into the trash, pulls out the blender, and begins to wrap it
At the  of the   opening, followed by a curious , she stands and hurries through the swinging door to the living room
- The living room is sparsely furnished -- a sofa, a coffee table, a bookcase cluttered with a handful of paperbooks, a couple of boardgames, a dying cactus, etc
crappy old fifteen inch t
v
on a t
v
tray
this for a moment before
paint-splattered cloth is unfurled
It gently floats down, revealing a  and his shopping cart overloaded with supplies
He's dressed in paint- splattered clothes
paint-splattered Red Sox cap is pulled low over his eyes, obscuring his face
Beth stares in disbelief
Without seeing her, the painter backs up, his attention focused on spreading the dropcloth
Who are you
(not looking up) The painter
(agitated) What are you doing
Painting
The painter looks up from the drop-cloth, ready to deal with this obstacle
He freezes
His face lights up
It's Sid
(extremely pleased) Well, good morning
(recognizing him) You
(extending a hand) Sid
Nice to see you again
Beth stares in agitated disbelief
With his untaken extended hand, he pulls a long strip of masking tape from a roll around his wrist, masking one side of the door frame from top to bottom
Why are you here
Realty office likes a fresh coat between tenants
(pointedly) We're still here
He stands on his tiptoes and puts a strip of masking tape on the top edge of the doorframe
've done this house before
(admiringly) did a nice job
He masks the remaining side of the door frame
Can't you come back tomorrow
Tomorrow's Sunday
Yeah
The new people move in on Sunday
(conversationally) Where are you moving to
(wearily) Billings, Montana
Sid moves to a window
(incredulous) Why
It can't be worse than Enfield, Arizona
Sid pulls a strip of tape off the roll
(smiling) 've lived in Enfield my whole life
He holds out the end of the masking tape
Could you hold this
Beth takes it
He walks backwards, easing a long strip of tape off the roll
use this to mask
Have you ever used masking tape to mask
He tears the tape off the roll and sticks it to the top of the baseboard in one corner
No
haven't
Crouched, he waddles across the room toward Beth, applying the masking tape to the baseboard
He gets to Beth, stands up, takes the tape off her fingers, and presses it into place
house like this, it's real easy
Hardly needs a paint job
You can skip it
won't tell
It needs a fresh coat
He hands her the end of the tape again and begins another baseboard
a little color
(naturally curious) What color is it gonna be
Off-white
He goes along the floor pressing the masking tape to the baseboard
It's already off-white
No
It's white
It's just dirty
Beth looks at the walls
He's right
Now if it was my house,  would choose a color
Beth kneels down, holding the tape, as he arrives at her end of the wall
would not choose off-white
Beth holds out the tape
They are kneeling next to each other
What would you choose
The color of your eyes
(pause, without looking) Hazel
Beth stares at Sid
Sid looks to Beth
Smiling, he takes the tape from her fingers
: - An oasis in the center of a packed mall parking lot
Carol hurries toward the front entrance in a snappy skirt and blazer combo, a Bullock's name tag attached to her lapel
- Nick is sitting at a booth, a beer in front of him, lost in thought
Carol arrives, drops a gift-wrapped box on the table, and scoots into the booth
Sorry 'm late, the new girl's a moron
(looking to the present) What's that
Going away present
Nick takes it
Thanks
He quickly unwraps it
(happily) map
thought you might need it
(unfolding it) do
had a map --  lost it
He spreads the map out over the table
(organized) Let's highlight your route
of the Western half of the
fills the
Carol's hand, holding a bright red felt-tip pen,
(
) Here's Enfield
She circles it
Nick's finger
(
) Here's Billings
Carol circles Billings
Nick's finger starts to trace the route
Carol's pen follows, marking the route
Halfway to Billings, Nick's finger abruptly stops
Carol stops the pen at the same point
(
) Look at this -- right there -- that's the town  was born in
He looks to her for a reaction
(emphatically) Where  grew up
Where my parent's live
Isn't that a coincidence
Visit them
(shaking his head) Oh
no
You're going to be driving by
No
(shaking his head) They're not near the interstate
(sort of chagrined) haven't even called them in years
You might as well visit
(adamantly) No
(shrugging) wouldn't know them
Nick starts to fold the map -- very unsuccessfully
Shit
Let me
Nick hands her the map
She deftly folds it in one motion and hands it back to him
Thanks
He leans over the table and kisses her
She stands
'm starved
: '   - Two of the walls gleam with fresh paint
Sid is painting with long-handled roller
Beth, enters, hesitates, and then -- consciously ignoring him -- walks by with a packed box and adds it to the stack by the front door
'm lucky  don't have to kill them
(not a line she was expecting) What
If they were dark, 'd have to put a layer of kill down first
Beth starts back to the kitchen
Sid and
So the dark paint wouldn't shine through the off-white
- The dishes are mostly packed
Oh
She picks up two empty liquor boxes
Kill's an oil based paint
Beth carries the boxes out of the kitchen -- Sid and - Beth walks right on through followed by the talking Sid and It covers the old paint so that you'd never know it was there, but it gives off fumes when it's drying
Beth goes into the small hallway, Sid and
- Beth walks toward the bedroom, Sid right behind her
Noxious fumes
They would find us on the floor unconscious
They enter the bedroom,
There's a queen-sized bed, a bureau, a mirror, and a closet
Beth takes the boxes to the closet
They
Sid sits on the bed, checking it's firmness
The "they" that find people
(interjecting) Nick
unconscious
(flatly) Nick
(after a beat) The man  live with
(smiling) guess he'd be the "they"
He'd find us
And he'd be surprised
Sid gets off the bed and with a grin, gingerly pats out the wrinkles he's made in the bed spread
: - Nick and Carol are walking away from the Pizza Hut, across a huge parking lot, toward a large mall
Cars circle past them, searching for close spots
(doggedly) It was the drive that killed us
San Antonio to Seattle is just too many hours in a car
If we'd have flown, we would've made it
(shaking her head) No
Things were all right in bed
But the rest of the time they were
awful
(hurt) Really
(flatly) Nick
We couldn't stand each other
We stopped in Enfield and just stayed
(after a beat) Why didn't you go on to Seattle
It was your car
Carol stops
On her face, the answer to his question is clear -- she was stuck on Nick then and she's still stuck on him now
But she'd never let him know that
(dryly) Big trees scare me
She starts walking
Nick hurries up beside her
They walk side by side for a few paces before the shotdown Nick comes up with a new ploy to win favor
(casually) 'm thinking about stealing a t
v
: '   - Beth's taking extra sheets and towels from the linen closet and packing them in liquor boxes
Sid enters from the living room
(cheerfully) 'm done in there
won't paint the ceiling 'til you've moved the furniture out
don't think we're going to take much of the furniture
No
It's ugly
kind of like the sofa
It's a sofa bed
You're not going to take it
(flatly) It weighs two thousand pounds
Can  have it
It's yours
Excellent
- The furniture is kind of ugly, but the walls look great
The whole room seems brighter, almost magically more cheerful
Sid runs into the room and flops onto the sofa
He settles in and sighs contentedly
The front door  open
Sid leaps up
Carol races into the room
(excited) Nick's gonna steal a t
v
She sees Sid and freezes
Who are you
The painter
Beth hurries into the living room
(excitedly) He's really gonna do it
He says yes
Carol glances pointedly at Sid then returns her attention to Beth
(conspiratorilly) We've got to talk
(piping in) About the crime
(sharply) There's no crime
Nick's gonna steal a t
v
That's just an expression
've never heard that expression
(witheringly) It's making the rounds
College students use it
(to Beth) Where's he stealing it from
Sears
(incredulous) You want him to know
He knows
He doesn't care
(to Sid) Do you care
(enthusiastically) 'm interested
Crime's interesting
read the papers
It's not a crime
It's justice
Poetic justice
How
They fired him
(deducing) He's got motive
(exasperated) Who is this guy
The painter
(helpfully) Sid
He holds out a hand to shake
Carol stares at his outstretched hand
(point blank) No
Carol takes Beth by the arm and leads her away from Sid
She stares back over her shoulder at Sid
Taking the hint, he begins to stir a can of paint, assuming an air of indifference
Carol turns her attention back to Beth
(purposefully) He needs you at the store
(tinged w/ apprehension) He needs me
: - Nick is standing next to , a precocious eight year old boy who's staring at a soap opera on a big screen t
v
As Nick and Rory talk, the soap  and  passionately embrace
You lookin' or buyin'
Lookin'
hate television
Yeah
What do you like
Movies
(shaking his head) No
do
(laying it out) You see
you go to a movie, you're there
Rory listens attentively
You watch t
v
, you're thirteen places at once
As many channels as you get, that's as many places as you are
You get cable
You're forty places at once
You get a satellite dish
You're all over the world
Exactly
In the , on the big screen t
v
, the soap actress breaks the embrace and points a gun at the actor
You're everywhere
The soap actress shoots the actor
He stares at her in overacting disbelief and slumps to the floor
It's called freedom
: '   - Carol watches as Sid whistles cheerfully, ripping the long strips of masking tape off the trim
(w/ attitude) This is what you do
also mow lawns
Which is your career
Painting
'm an inside person
(confidentially) Mowing grass is seasonal
(dryly) That is true
Sid wads the tape into a big ball
(disarmingly) You've got a nice tan
(not disarmed) work on it
Sid shoots the tape ball into his shopping cart of supplies
Do you want to get stoned
Carol thinks for a moment
It's been a long time and she's not crazy about him being there
(after a beat) Yeah
Sid takes a joint out of his shirt pocket
This kind of painting -- for people won't know -- it's boring
(lighting the joint) It's not very good
It's homegrown
He takes a drag
Yeah
But it'll get you fucked up
He hands the joint to Carol
takes a drag on the joint like an old pro
(
) It'll take you someplace
Carol chokes back wheezes and then explodes in a coughing fit
: - Nick and  , a uniformed military man in his late forties, are standing in front of a wall of silent color televisions
On the t

s a nearly identical pairs of smile their way through the news
Have you thought about American
No
own an American set
'm very satisfied
want Japanese
'll tell you
Nick put his arm around the man's shoulder and guides him toward a display case
the thing is, a hundred and fifty dollars gets you very little in the way of Japanese technology
Oh
They stop at the case
Nick points
It would get you that t
v
- tiny two inch Casio television playing "Gilligan's Island"
Nick looks to see the Jenkin's reaction
Jenkins stares dumbfounded at the tiny t
v
He looks to Nick
It's for my parents
Your parents
Yes
They live with me
Beth enters the
Nick doesn't see her
and they want Japanese
Nick stifles a strange urge to giggle
Beth tries to subtly get Nick's attention
Is there a problem
(controlling the giggles) No
, uh, just never think of adults as having parents
(flatly) They do
(agreeably) know
Beth fake coughs to get his attention
Nick sees her
'm an adult,  have parents
Nick turns to Beth with a burst of salesman cheer
Oh, Miss, 've got your receipt
Beth approaches them, still not sure what Nick's up to
(acting cheerful) Oh
great
Nick holds out the receipt
This is all you need
Beth takes the receipt
(puzzled, but playing along) Thanks
(personably) Now you just take this receipt out, give it to the guys at the loading dock and they'll give you your brand new beautiful television set
(thrown) get the t
v
(cheerfully) Out back
They'll help load it in your car and everything
(flatly) get the t
v
Out back
Nick turns his full attention to the man
Think about American
They're mostly Japanese parts anyway
Beth stares at Nick, amazed that he's managed to come up with a plan that has her taking the television
Excuse me,  just
(interrupting, pleasantly) Miss
'm helping this customer here, perhaps you might
(firmly, a salesman's put-off) You might want to see someone else
(pointedly) You can't help me
(after a beat, then w/ finality) Not really
: - Beth rides down on the escalator, the receipt clenched in her hand, surrounded by other shoppers, as a tinny Muzak version of the "Theme from The Mary Tyler Moore Show" drones on in the background
Conflicting emotions cloud her face
: - - (
) How'd you do it
(
) Nick sold a demo, wrote it up like a new set, and gave me the receipt
As Sid's jacknife   and zips through the packing tape,     to reveal
- The sun is low, giving the room a golden glow
Sid and Beth are sitting on the sofa, the t
v
box on the floor in front of them
Sid opens the television box
Slowly, he pulls out the sheets of bubbled packing plastic
He pops several of the bubbles
(savoring the bubble plastic) Excellent
Maybe  should just leave it packed
'mon
You stole it
You gotta see it
Hold the box
Beth holds the box
Sid starts to lift out the television
(urgently) Wait
Beth looks to him, anxiously
thought  heard the police
Beth listens, nervously
Sid grins
Ha ha ha
(an amused realization) You're stoned
(innocently) Me
You're being silly and you've got bunny eyes
Embarrassed, Sid pulls Visine from a pocket and drips it in his eyes as he speaks
'm a little stoned
not that stoned
No
No
(after a beat) Carol's really stoned
You got Carol stoned
Very stoned
didn't think she liked you
She doesn't
But she likes getting stoned
(smiling) She does
There's nothing like drugs to create a quick and shallow friendship
Beth laughs
(rubbing his hands) Let's look at the loot
Sid pulls the t
v
up and out of the box
He sits back on the sofa, the t
v
in his lap
The t
v
is spectacular -- huge, metallic, and ultra-modern
(very impressed) Jesus
you didn't fool around
(w/ mixed emotions) This is the nicest thing 've ever owned
Beth stares at the television
Sid stares at Beth
She meets his eyes, then looks quickly back to the television
: /
- '   - Nick is driving
His face is beaded with sweat as he drags heavily on a cigarette
He pushes the buttons on his radio, getting
' And in Canton, Ohio today, a man opened fire in a mall, killing nine and wounding seventeen others
Initial reports indicate the young man was a disgruntled employee
Nick turns the radio off
He pulls the scotch bottle from his jacket and takes a slug
He jerks his necktie loose and slips it over his head
He tosses it into the back seat
' swerves into a vast mall parking lot
- Through the flow of traffic,   Nick standing at a payphone on the outside wall of a Red Lobster Restaurant
Nick speaks urgently into the phone, punctuating his conversation with edgy body language
Abruptly, he hangs up
: '  - Carol hangs up a wallphone
She leans against the refridgerator, her expression a controlled blank
She turns her head and looks out her kitchen window
' Through Nick and Beth's living room window,   Sid struggling under the weight of the t

viewers
(happily) Yeah
(w/ happy disbelief) Fuckin' Nick
Sid and Beth stare at the television, completely engrossed
Carol stares at them for a long moment

Startled, Sid and Beth jump back
They look at each other and laugh
(cheerfully) Come see
Beth turns the   as Carol comes and looks at the t

You can come over and watch
Carol looks to Beth, a quizzical expression on her face

(w/ a tinge of sadness) Oh
Right
(to Carol) Sorry
Forget it
Beth turns off the t

There's a moment of awkward silence as they all stare at the blank screen
(breaking the silence, pointedly) How's the painting going
(shaking his head) Too many distractions
'll be at it all night
You have bad work habits
Not when 'm actually working
(standing) better get set up in the kitchen
He goes to his shopping cart of supplies
Carol and Beth stare at the television
The television stares back at them, gleamingly modern
It makes teevee seem very futuristic
(at the kitchen door) That's 'cause you're stoned
'm hardly stoned
She looks to Beth
Beth is grinning
(mitigating) It was homegrown
(teasing) Want some Visine
(flatly) No
(
) (calling out) It gets the red out
The Visine comes flying
Carol fumbles, then catches it
(dryly) Thank you
Carol tilts back her head and manuevers the Visine
Shit
Missed the eye, got the face
Need help
Yeah
Beth goes to her and takes the Visine
Okay
(holding Carol's arm) Tilt your head back
Beth
Stop fidgeting
She puts a drop in one eye
Carol flinches
Got it
Next eye
Wait a second
Carol blinks and wipes a Visine tear off her cheek
(nodding to the kitchen, in a conspiratorial whisper) He really wants to get in your pants
(smiling) My pants are taken
She tilts Carol's head back
Why don't you go for him
He likes you
Beth puts a drop in Carol's eye
Carol flinches and rubs her eye
wish Nick would get back and help with the packing
She sighs, cheerfully exasperated
He's probably getting drunk with the stockboys
(after a beat) That's what he's probably doing
Carol braces herself
Beth
(pause, then w/ difficulty) Listen
They stare into each other's eyes
After a long moment Carol averts her eyes and looks down
(simply) He's gone
Yeah
(badly shaken) Where'd he call from
He said the highway
Beth takes a deep breath, controlling her emotions
have to do something
'll help
've got to be out of here Sunday
That's tomorrow
You can come to my place
(stunned) He's gone
Beth sinks onto the arm of the sofa to support herself
(gently) He's an asshole
-: The truth makes its way deeply into her
(a half whisper) Fuckin' Nick
: - The lightly traveled highway cuts a straight line through the desert
Nick's sedan pulls off into a service station with a giant teepee beside it
The wind is roaring, kicking up swirls of grey dust in the flourescent light of the service station
boy is filling Nick's tank
Nick leans against the car staring at the giant teepee
Nobody lives in that, right
Gift shop
But it closed at seven
(cheerfully shrugging) got no one to shop for
gust of wind sends dust into Nick's eye
Shit
(rubbing his eye) Fuckin' wind
Yeah
(sincerely) What does it mean
High pressure field coming in -- should bring some nice weather
No
The wind itself, you know what mean, you're an Indian
(correcting him) 'm a Navajo
Yeah, so you're in tune with this stuff
(checking the pump) It's thirteen bucks
(his train of thought broken) Oh
right
Nick pulls a bill out of his wallet and holds it out
Here's a twenty
The Navajo Teen takes the bill and takes a wad of bills from his pocket
Nick stares out at the moonlit desert and the mountains rising in the distance
So what does the wind mean
Like as an omen or something, you know -- (making his voice mystical) -- a change is coming to the people
-- the spirit of freedom is walking the land
(flatly) That kind of meaning
(handing him money) Fourteen, fifteen and five makes twenty
He opens Nick's car door for him
The wind is
It's the wind like 'm a Navajo
That's it
The Navajo teen nods
Shit
He gets in the car, his mood darkening, and pulls his door shut with a slam
(out the window) It would be better if meant something
The Navajo teen shrugs
Nick starts the engine
: - dimly lit room filled with raucous customers and lots of neon beer signs
Waitresses in red dresses tote pitchers of brew to the thirsty throng
At the far end a band plays a foot-stompin' good time tune about a trucker on his way to see his woman
through the crowd and discovers Carol and Beth sitting at a small table, an almost finished pitcher of beer between them
They speak loudly to be heard over the din
He said he needs to be alone again
Learn about himself
Make a fresh start in a new town
Beth shakes her head then takes a sip of her beer -- it tastes bitter in her mouth and she puts her glass down in disgust
(after a beat) He's sorry
Beth stares at her beer
Carol puts a hand comfortingly on Beth's arm
He said he would have called you, but your phone's disconnected
'Cause you're moving
(after a beat) He's always been an asshole
(after a beat) You'll be all right
Yeah
(gently) 'm here
know that
big-haired  approaches the table
You ready for another
Carol looks to Beth
Oh
uh, no
We're fine
Is Nick coming in
Carol throws the waitress a look that could kill
Beth takes a deep breath
: /
'  -  - Nick stares at the road ahead
He takes rapid drags on a cigarette
The  is barely audible over the  of the through the open windows
' (covered by static) "And he arose and came to his father, but when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and
" Nick turns the radio off
He fumbles the cigarette into the ashtray
He takes a pint of scotch from the front seat, uncaps it, takes a slug, takes another slug, recaps it, and drops it back on the seat
He stares at the road
He looks down to the front seat and finds the map
He splits his attention between the road and unfolding the map
The wind catches the map
The map billows up, covering his face
Losing control of the car, Nick slaps it down
car  blares
Nick jerks the car back into his lane, bats the map down again, and pulls off to the side of the road
He stops the car and slams the shift into park
He opens his door a crack, turning on the dome light
He smooths out the map on the dashboard
Billings and Enfield are marked with Carol's big red circles
- - Nick's finger traces from Enfield toward Billings along the route Carol highlighted with the red felt-tip
Halfway to Billings, the red line stops
Nick's finger stops
He stares at the map
: '   - Beth comes in the front door
The sound of Sid whistling comes softly from the kitchen
Beth stares at the t
v
for a moment then strides purposefully toward the kitchen
'  - Sid is standing on the counter masking the top sill of the kitchen window
There's half a donut hanging from his mouth
Beth comes through the swinging door
(forcefully) You've lived here your whole life
The half-donut falls from the startled Sid's mouth
(after a beat) Yeah
(increduously) You've never gone anywhere
He picks up the half-donut
Travelling has no allure for me
None
Sid climbs down and sits on the counter, dropping the half- donut back into the donut box
Maybe through time
(smiling) That's not offered
So  stay here
Why
(the simple truth) It's my home
belong here
'm serious
So was Sid -- but he realizes Beth doesn't believe it can be as simple as that
My father says if you stay in one place long enough your luck knows where to find you
(wryly) Maybe that's my problem
(carefully) Maybe it is
Sid holds out the box of donuts to her
Thanks
She takes a donut and fiddles with it
You think your father knows the truth
He's a bartender
(smiling) He's lived here his whole life
Has his luck found him
Not yet
(after a beat) But it's probably very close
Beth smiles weakly
Abruptly, she drops her donut back in the box
(cautiously) Are you all right
(apologetically) Must be the paint fumes
She opens up the back door and steps out
Sid stares at the empty doorway
- Beth stands in the moonlight, staring out at the stars
(contemplatively dubious) You find what you want here
Sid steps out behind her
It seems that way
Yeah
(simply) found you
Oh
No
She walks out into the backyard
Sid follows her
(earnestly) We never met before last night
The moonlight through the orange trees casts a magical air about the backyard
Beth stops by a swingset
but we know each other
Beth stiffens
No
She walks away from him
He watches her intently
Leave it behind
She looks to him
Leave what behind
Unhappiness
(amused) That was a bad answer
(seriously) No
It was true
Beth stares at Sid
It's not
Come hold me
(after a beat) Come hold me, and you'll be happy
(dryly) 'll find happiness
Right
In your arms
Yes
In you
Yes
But  won't
have to find happiness in myself
No
That's wrong
(going toward her) People tell you that, but it's wrong
She turns away from him
He stands behind her, close
've lived with people who have that happiness from within
That happiness -- it's just them being pleased with themselves
It's not enough
It's a lonely thing
She turns and faces him
The moonlight casts a pale glow over them
She stares in his eyes for a long moment
She steps back from him
You're showing how young you are
No
'm not
'm showing you a way
You know that
And you know me
(after a beat) And  know you
She walks away from him, back to the swingset
don't know you
Sid follows and takes her arms, turning her to face him
You know
(after a beat, defensively) know you want to fuck me
He pulls her very close
He lets go of her arms so she is standing against him, unrestrained
Is that what you know
Beth stares at his face for a long time
know
She kisses him, suddenly, long and slow
(whispering) know you
They kiss, pulling each other tight
They lose their balance and stagger against the swingset, kissing passionately
Beth pulls back
(w/ fierce intensity) know you
That's right
: -    - canopy of stars hangs over it
'  - Nick is parked, staring at the house
The roadmap is on the seat beside him
He takes a drink from a half empty pint of scotch
He screws the cap on and drops the bottle on the map
He steps out of the car, unsteadily
'   - Nick walks toward the door
He stops, stares at the door and starts back for his car
He stops, shakes his head, and walks quickly to the front door
Nick stands, staring at the door
He knocks
He waits impatiently, then pounds on the door
On his third pound the lights in the house suddenly go on
' The door abruptly opens
, an eighty year old man, stands in the doorway
wears pajamas, slippers, and a long robe
He is over six and a half feet tall
Nick, startled, steps back
Mr
August stares at him
Nick composes himself
Excuse me
Mr
August stares at him
Excuse me
'm
'm looking for my parents
Mr
August calmly puts his hands over his ears, and slowly shakes his head
My mother, my father
they
, a fifteen year old girl steps out from behind Mr
August
She seems very small next to Mr
August
He puts a hand on her shoulder
She stares at Nick
(uncomfortably) Hello
Hello
(exhaling in relief) Oh
good
(to the point) This is my house
, uhh
mean this is the house  grew up in
Nick looks past them into the house
(nodding to Mr
August) This is his house now
Nice to meet you
He holds out a hand to Mr
August, who slowly shakes it
He's deaf
(loudly) Nice to meet you
He's stone deaf
Oh
(uncomfortably) Yelling doesn't help
No
Nick breaks the handshake
Mr
August smiles at him
Nick looks to Elizabeth
My name is Nick, Nick Brennan
He waits for her to introduce herself
She doesn't
Did you know the Brennans
No
They lived here
They used to live here
used to live here with them
Elizabeth stares at him
Nick tries his salesman charm
What's your name
Elizabeth
No
Yes
know an Elizabeth
(quietly) call her Beth
: '  - Bathed in moonlight, Sid and Beth make tender passionate love
Sid has never wanted someone so much and Beth has never felt so wanted
Beth clings to Sid as if she were afraid of being swept away
and then she is
: '   - chandelier casts a gently sparkling golden glow
The   down to reveal
Mr
August, Elizabeth and Nick, sitting at a large antique dining room table
Nick is eating a sandwich, an untouched glass of milk in front of him
Mr
August and Elizabeth watch him, expectantly
Nick notices this
(swallowing) This is a good sandwich
Thank you
(abruptly nodding toward Mr
August) When did he move here
Would he know where the people before him went
No
He wouldn't remember
You're sure
Yes
He doesn't remember anymore
Oh
(taking a deep breath) He can't help me
No
Nick looks around the familiar room, struck by the absurdity of the situation
(with wry awareness) 've lost my parents
Nick smiles weakly at Elizabeth
(matter-or-factly) Did you lose them both at the same time
Is that like a joke
No
Then yes
lost them both at the same time
lost mine one at a time
(after a beat) Last year
Nick realizes she's talking about death
'm sorry
That's tragic
should
(interrupting) Six months apart
Body failures
Separate body failures
'm really sorry
(standing) should go
Mr
August slowly stands as Elizabeth follows Nick toward the foyer
First my father's heart kept starting and stopping
(nodding) Attacks
Nick edges toward the door followed by Elizabeth and Mr
August
My mother and  were with him in the hospital and he'd grab at us, he'd grab my arms and hold on
That's very sad
(after a beat, backing toward the door) 've really gotta be going
, uh
thank you again for the sandwich
Delicious
Right before my mother died, she said -- "Elizabeth
You're adopted
" Nick stops in his tracks, his hand on the doorknob
Have you found your real parents
No
Two are enough to lose
Nick stares at her -- the sad truth of her statement sinking in
'm not alone
have my Grandfather
Nick looks down
He is alone
He has no one
(opening the door) Listen
He looks into her eyes
Elizabeth suddenly grabs his arm
He stares at her, not knowing what to do
She holds his arm tightly for a moment, then lets go
'm sorry
She steps back from Nick, against her grandfather
(in explanation) He's stone deaf
Nick stares at Elizabeth
have to go
And he hurries out the door into the night
: '  - Beth is sitting up in bed, Sid leaning back against her, her arms wrapped around him
(after a beat) 'd like to stay right here
have to be out tomorrow
In this moment
Enjoying this moment
They both lie perfectly still
flicker of sadness crosses Beth's face
(hushed) The moment's gone
(shaking his head) It can go on as long as we want
Beth leans him back, cradling him in her arms
She stares at him, a quizzical expression on her face
(skeptically) Have you ever been in a relationship
No
(after a beat) was married
but it wasn't really a relationship
(incredulous) You weren't married
Two years
Right out of high school
Beth ponders this for a moment
Do  remind you of her
No
(relieved) Thank God
Sid runs his hands over her body
You have beautiful skin
her skin was polka-dotted
Freckled
When we were kids we called her "Spot"
(laughing) What happened
She disappeared
Beth looks to Sid
He's staring off
(after a beat) Was she ever found
flicker of loss crosses his face
No
Not by me
(looking to Beth) didn't go look
Beth stares at him, uncertainly
He leans up and gently traces circles on Beth's skin
She wanted to meet someone new asked her "why
" -- she said, "Because he won't know me from before
Just now
Just what  am now
" Beth looks to him, puzzled
knew her
on playgrounds
in Sunday School
all those grades -- knew her as she changed
But she was still the same person
All the times  knew her, she was still her
(after a beat) She can't get away from that
He holds Beth tightly
You stay in one place, and all those things that are you
are there
She didn't understand that if you leave, they're still there, in you -- but they stop being clear
You stop knowing who you are, and what you want
You've stayed here and you know who you are
He moves away from Beth
see the lawns  mow, houses 've painted, faces  know
my parents
And 'm constantly reminded of who am
And you know what you want
want you
Oh
want to be inside you
Good
(after a beat) Come here and put it inside me
No
want to be able to put myself inside of you
Doing this is as close as you get
Beth pulls Sid close, bringing him into her
Come here
love you
She holds him tightly
Come inside me
Sid arches away from her
Beth
Yes
What do you want
(uncertainly) want
want
Beth pulls Sid back to her
(w/ quiet urgency) Come inside me
They hold each other tightly

'  - Nick looks like hell -- his eyes red, his hair a mess
The nearly empty scotch bottle is on the dashboard
The car windows are open, the roar of the wind competing with the blasting radio
Nick suddenly jerks the wheel over
- The sedan screeches off the highway into the abandoned rest area
It stops facing a battered phone booth -- the engine turns off but the headlines stay shining on the phone booth
Nick turns off the radio
It is suddenly very quiet -- only the occasional lonely     passing on the highway
He takes a deep breath
- Nick is standing in the phone booth, harshly lit by his headlights
(into the phone) Could you give me the number for information in Arizona
Thank you
Nick dials with drunken concentration
(into the phone) Enfield
Carol, Carol, umm
(mortified) Carol
Carol Something
Shit
He hangs up
He hits himself in the head in angry disbelief
He hurriedly dials zero and listens for a moment, desperately summoning up all his salesman charm
(into the phone) Hello Janet, thank you for being my operator
hope you can help me, need to call my home
Nick listens impatiently
Well, 'll tell you my number, but there's a problem
My phone's been disconnected, not because of bills, mean we paid all our bills
We were hardly ever even late
We were very good customers, but we're moving, so we had the phone disconnected
But now  need to call
the woman live with
She's still there and 've got to let her know where  am
Nick listens, shaking his head emphatically
don't know any of the neighbors know one, but  can't remember her last name
(he listens, frustrated) No
No
No
You see you have to be able to help me, this is not a prank, it's my home phone, this is an emergency
(he listens, then urgently) Yes it can, it can be done
Someone there can hook the phone back up
It's not like a phone guy came to our house to disconnect the phone, nobody came to our house, someone just flipped a switch somewhere, somewhere there where you work, or plugged something into a computer and our phone stopped working
(he listens) They turned it off, they can turn it back on
(he listens, starting to panic) know it's the week-end
know
Call them at home
They'll have a computer at their house, they'll have a phone thing to hook it up to the real computer
That's how these people live
They'll be glad to do it
Nick listens
Suddenly all his energy drains away
(crestfallen) No
No
can't have the police go to the house
That won't work, there are circumstances
(desperately) It's you
you've got to help me
Please
've gotta call home
can't wait
It could be too late
Janet
You've gotta help me
Please
You can reconnect me
Please
Don't hang up
Don't hang up
He hurls the receiver at the phone
You fucker
You heartless
Nick doubles over, retching, clutching the side of the booth
"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again
If you need help
" : : '  - Sid is sprawled out over the bed, sleeping, Beth nestled against him
She stirs and cuddles closer
Suddenly she realizes it's not Nick
She pulls away, orientating herself
She quickly scoots out of bed and hurriedly pulls on a pair of jeans
The alarm clock
Beth looks about for the alarm
She tensely scatters some boxes
She dumps one, finds the alarm and shuts it off
She stares at the clock and drops it into a box
(
) (cheerfully) Morning
Beth cringes slightly and turns to face Sid
(attempting a smile) Hi
(grinning) Hi
didn't want to wake you
(cheerfully) 'm awake
'm a morning person
'm not
Then why don't you come back to bed
've got to pack
(sitting up) Where do we start
(firmly) No
(softening) You paint
She looks around the room littered with boxes and piles of clothes
'll manage
(cheerfully) Whatever you say
Sid gets out of bed, wrapping the sheet around himself
Beth stares at the room
She suddenly trembles
She steadies herself on the bed table
Oh God
(concerned) What
Beth avoids his eyes, glancing around the room
(an outpouring) 'd be so much happier if  could blame this on Nick, but it always happens to me
'm always left with nothing
(taking a deep breath) It doesn't matter if  leave the guy or if the guy leaves me -- 'm left with nothing
never do anything for myself
never acquire anything
mean Nick didn't take from me
He stole a t
v
and left it for me
He didn't take my things, he didn't take our things
he didn't even take his clothes
And 'll still leave this house with nothing
He took three years from you
No
(meeting his eyes) He didn't take 'em
mean, when he cared about me, he cared about me
And he was really good in bed
She glances away from Sid toward the bed
(after a beat) didn't expect more
She turns away from Sid and the bed
Sid moves toward her
(carefully) Beth
Beth summons up all the composure she can manage

She goes out the bedroom door
Sid stares after her

Without raising his head from the steering wheel, Nick starts the car

) Long on conversation

Yeah

Beth sips her coffee, gazing out the kitchen window
' The backyard
In the light of day it's lost its magical quality

've got some

huge beautifully feathered ceremonial headdress
That would make her laugh

Dotson) And 'll be by tomorrow with my truck and the big things

You gave me a lot more
No
(holding him tightly) It was all even in this department
(softly) Feel me
(whispering) know
You're hard again
Holding her tightly, Sid runs his fingers down her spine
want you all the time
(torn) Shit
She kisses him
They kiss, long and hard
Abruptly, she breaks the embrace and moves away from him
(ironically self-aware) just fleeced a widow
(protesting) No
It was all junk
She shivers
Shit
've got to get some aspirin
(shaking her head) didn't drink enough to be hung over
She walks away from Sid, out of the bedroom
'  - Beth gulps down aspirin
She stares at herself in the mirror, wearily searching
Sid appears in the doorway, his reflection small next to the reflection of her face
You just feel bad for her like feel bad for her
'cause her husband died
(doubting this) Yeah
That's about the saddest thing there is
losing someone you love
Beth is struck by a certainty that she's never lost anyone she's loved because she's never really loved anyone
It's never happened to me
Sid hesitates, then speaks his heart
If you died,  couldn't stand life
She steps forward and kisses him
She steps back
(businesslike) 've got to go now
She walks out of the bathroom
Sid and    as she hurries though the living room toward the bedroom
The new people'll be here
She disappears down the hall to the bedroom
(following) Go to my house
(
) No
Beth picks up her suitcases
Sid steps into the doorway
While you find a place
No
gotta get out
She heads to the bedroom door
can talk to the realtors,  know they've got a place in Agawam
Beth stops
(shaking her head) No
Agawam
no
don't know where 'm going
Somewhere else
She walks past him into the hallway
Sid and You can call me when you get there
'll give you my number
She stops and puts down the suitcases
(gently) Sid
'm going away
You're making me way too important
You met me yesterday
He goes to her
And today  love you
She steps back, shaking her head
Jesus
one day
That doesn't matter
You know that
It can take a second
Beth loses control, upset with herself for having mixed emotions, upset with her life, and upset he's making this more difficult
No
That's
that's a fuckin' animal thing, 've done that
Not with me
meet men, go home with them and just stay
No decision involved -- it's just what  do
And then  don't have to live my life,  just lead theirs
can't keep doing that
(adamant) We're not that way
What way are we
We're passionate
We're comfortable
It's been passionate, it's been comfortable
But it hasn't been
important
(after a beat) Like you're making it
(urgently) It is important
You know that
No
It was a night
It wasn't real
It was fun, it was some great fucking
But it's just something that happened
It's not real
It didn't "just happen"
You know we're it
'm the one for you
The "one"
've had lots of "ones"
look like a baby but 'm twenty- fuckin'-- eight years old
You're just the latest
No
'm the last
You've found me
And it can go on forever
No
(her heart breaking for him) Oh, Sid
Forever
(shaking her head) You have to understand -- it's just talk
It's not
(defiantly disbelieving) It is
'mon, these things you say
c'mon
What
If  died you couldn't stand life
That's
that's
That's true
No
Beth can't bear the risk of opening her soul to believe him -- and she can't bear to hear the outpouring of his soul without believing him
So she ends it
(after a beat, harshly) You won't know when  die
You won't be there
She picks up her suitcases and heads for the door
(following her, certain) You'd want me there
If  wasn't there it wouldn't matter who was
You'd be alone
No
He grabs her arms and spins her to face him
(imploring) Beth
Beth
you love me
(defiantly) No
How do you feel
Think
You love me
She stares at him, breathing deeply, gathering herself
He lets go of her arms and steps back
(her words carefully chosen) care about you
You have to be with me
No
(pause) care about you
But 'm an adult
can say no
They stare at each other
(w/ controlled anger) That's what makes you an adult
(unwavering) Yes
(pause) can say no
(pause) No,  won't do that
No,  won't have that
No,  can't
(needing to hear her say it) You can say no to me
Yes
He looks away from her
She stares at his back
'm going
She steps toward the door
Beth
She stops
(after a beat) Have someplace to go
(simply) don't
She opens the door
Why don't
(interrupting) Don't tell me what to do
She goes out the door
Sid goes to the door
- Beth makes her way to her car
Sid stands in the doorway, watching
What are you gonna do
She turns and faces him
don't know
Beth tosses her suitcases in the backseat
She gets into the car and starts the engine
Sid stands, willing her to stop the car
Beth pulls out to the end of the driveway
' She looks up at the rearview mirror
' Sid is framed in the doorway of her old home, waiting, trusting that she can't leave, that they are destined
Her eyes well with tears
Her face sets with resolve
The car pulls out and disappears down the road
Sid stands in the doorway for a long moment
He steps back into the house and shuts the door
: '  - Nick is driving, the cheap headdress still perched on his head
Crumpled empty coffee cups are scattered about the front seat
He reaches up and turns the rearview mirror
Nick's face stares back at him
It's not a pretty sight
Nick reaches into the back seat, fishes and comes up with his necktie
He slips the still-knotted necktie over his headdress and tightens it around his neck
Nick looks back to the road and suddenly swerves off an exit ramp
The   on the Exit Sign -- "Enfield
"
: - Sid silently goes through the motions of pulling the masking tape from around the window sills of the freshly painted room, his face a stony mask
: '  - Nick's car screeches to a stop in front of the house
He leaps out of the car and runs toward the front door
- The front door flings open
Nick charges into the room
(calling out) Beth
(bellowing) Beth
Sid steps through the swinging door into the living room
Nick freezes
(coldly) She's not here
(desperately) Where is she
She's gone
Shit
(a moment of manners) Excuse me
(exploding) Shiiiiit
(confrontationally) Who are you
(coldly) The painter
You're Nick
(startled) Yeah
The Indian chief
(puzzled) What
Then Nick, remembering the headdress, rips it off his head and furiously tears it apart -- scattering a flurry of plastic feathers
He hurls what's left of it across the room
Shit
(accusingly) You're too late
She's gone
(angrily) got that
Where'd she go
She didn't say
Shit
(bitterly) She didn't know
Nick runs out the front door
'   - Nick runs out into his lawn
(running; under his breath) Be at Carol's
be at Carol's
The   he races up to Carol's front door and leans on the doorbell -- a loud tight buzzing
He pounds on the door, then stops, gasping for breath
No one's home
He turns, leaning against the door for support, staring out at tract house neighborhood
(spent) 'm too late
Suddenly he bolts for his car
Nick yanks his car door open and disappears into it
In a second he emerges with the bottle of scotch
It's empty
He eyes it for a moment then hurls it as far as he can down the street -- it shatters explosively
He races to his front door and stops dead in his tracks at the open doorway
' Sid has covered the floor and remaining furniture with drop cloths and is applying even strokes to the ceiling with a long handled roller
Nick steps in and stares at Sid and his own nearly empty drop-cloth covered home
(at the top of his lungs) This really bothers me
Sid stares at him
(after a moment, with mock politeness) Will you do me a favor
(spitting out the word) What
Act normal
Nick advances on Sid
(adamantly) Listen
don't want to be normal don't have to be,  don't
This is my house
You're in my house
And 'm tired of going to my house and finding strangers
They're face to face in a stand-off
It's not your house
You're gone
'm painting -- He puts the long handled roller right in Nick's face
-- for the new people -- whose house it's going to be
(pause) You're gone
They're not here yet
'm here
(calmly) guess that makes this my house
Nick ponders this logic, Sid's size, and the roller in his face
(politely) May  look around
(w/ a stony politeness) Sure
Make yourself at home
Nick wanders around the nearly empty room, then, after a beat
he pulls a dropcloth off an object in the corner, revealing the television
(dismayed) Nooo
she left the television
Yeah
Too bad
(pointedly) She didn't seem to want it
That's foolish
That t
v
is a remarkable thing
They both stare at the television
The sweep of  turning into the driveway cross their faces
They both race to the door
- Carol gets out of her car
Nick hurries toward her
(flatly) You came back
(a little chagrined) Yeah
Is Beth here
No
Do you know where she went
No
Shit
You're too late
(from the doorway) She's gone
(to Carol, exasperated) Who is this guy
(walking past him toward the house) Beth's new boyfriend
(exploding) What
(stopping) You heard me
(to Sid) Is this true
Not really
He turns and walks back into the house
(to Carol) Not really
He races after Sid
- Sid is painting the ceiling
Nick bursts through the door
(to Sid) Not really
What
(w/ "say it ain't so" attitude) Did you fuck her
don't tell
Jesus
The next day
(bitterly disillusioned) That's the world, huh
They don't even wait a day anymore
(stepping in the doorway) You left her
(defensively) didn't fuck anyone
(witheringly) You didn't find anyone
(hurt) No
didn't leave her for another person,  left her for another place
(pause) Which  think is a little more excusable
don't
Well it's none of your fuckin' business
(threateningly) think it is
Cause you fucked her
No
That gives you no business in my life
If you hadn't gone, 'd be done by now
'd be home
Be glad you have a home, asshole
Let it drop, Nick
(outraged) Why
He was nice to Beth when you treated her like shit
Nick stares at her -- knowing what she says is true
(protesting weakly) came back
(busting him) Nick
This is me
You didn't come back for Beth's sake -- something just didn't work out like you had planned
(defensively) You see -- you don't know everything about me --  didn't really have any real plans
He was sweet to her
They were sweet with each other
Nick stares at her
Beth looked young with him
They had a real connection
(after a beat, dryly) And  brought them together
He exhales loudly and holds his head in his hands
It seems 'm blessed
in what do
do wrong, and it turns out right
that 've done right
So it really doesn't matter what  do
Nick takes a deep breath
Hey
Sid ignores him
(after a beat) said "hey
" Sid looks at him
(flamboyantly sarcastic) hope you're very happy together
She's gone
(glancing to Carol, pointedly) She is, isn't she
(to Sid) If you two were such the happy couple why the fuck did she leave, Romeo
After three years with you, she wanted to be alone
was already gone
This is not about me and Beth, there is no me and Beth
This is about you
Why didn't you go with her
It wasn't offered
(advancing on him) People aren't going to offer you anything
You have to take what you want
You can't take another person
They have to give themselves to you
(in his face) That's very wise, but not very true
(relentlessly) sell televisions
People don't know what they want
You have to show them
couldn't show her
Go after her
Leave him alone
No
He's not alone, he's with us
She's alone
She's out there alone
(after a beat, quietly) Just hoping she's closer to what she wants
(sardonically) And what is that
(exploding) don't know
Nick throws his arms in the air and storms up to Carol's face
How would  know
What do  know
Carol doesn't flinch
He steps back
(w/ a sweeping gesture) know that what  want isn't there
(pointing to his chest) It isn't here
(gesturing wildly) It isn't inside
It isn't outside
(spent) It doesn't exist
He turns on Sid
(forcefully) But you want her, and you aren't doing shit about it
There isn't anything he can do
He can go after her
(to Sid) Go after her
can't
She
(torn) My life is here
What kind of man won't fuck up his life for the women he loves
Go find her
He stares at Sid
He wouldn't know where to look
(groping) She'd she'd she'd
(triumphant) She'd head for her parents
What
She'd head for her parents
Believe me
(pause, then flatly) They're in Florida
That's east
Nick stares at Sid, waiting
(businesslike) You start driving east on route forty
Keep going east and around eleven start checking every roadside motel
The budget ones
You do that all night, you'll find her
How do you know she's on the highway
When you don't know where you're going, you drive on the highway
Sid looks to Carol, then around the drop cloth covered room
(cheerfully) 'll finish painting
(to Carol) Do  have a chance
Nick and Sid both look to Carol
(after a beat, shaking her head) You've got a chance
(determined) Then 'm gone
Sid races out the door
Nick tosses a self-satisfied smile at Carol and walks past her to the door
Sid's truck engine roars to life
' Sid peels out, driving up onto the lawn past Nick and Carol's cars, out onto the street and out of sight
Carol steps into the doorway beside Nick
So
(dryly) Start painting
Nick looks back into the room
(after a beat) Fuck the ceiling
(walking in) Who looks up that often
Carol follows him into the room
Nick slumps on the sofa, staring at the blank t
v
' (happily) This is it
and a , both slightly portly Mexican-Americans in their late forties, wearing their Sunday best, step over the threshold and kiss
The man is carrying the woman cradled in his arms
(politely) Hello
(surprised, breaking the kiss) Oh
Hello
The four stare at each other in awkward silence, the woman still cradled in the man's arms
'm sorry
We thought it was going to be empty
(flatly) It is
(cheerfully) We're here to move in
The man puts her down on her feet
Are you the couple moving out
No
No
Nick and Carol look to each other, at a loss
Nick looks back to the couple
(improvising) We're your new neighbors
From next door
Carol throws him a look
Well
(putting on a good face) It's nice to meet you
He holds out his hand to shake
After an instant of awkward hesitation they all shake hands with too much enthusiasm
(cheerfully, while shaking hands) It is
and it's so nice of you to greet us
Thank you
They finish the handshakes -- there's an awkward pause
Actually, we're here for the t
v
He waits, half expecting this statement to be challenged
It isn't
(confidently) The people who left here -- our old neighbors -- left us that t
v
They all look at the t
v
Oh
It's very nice
Yes
It is
There's an awkward pause
(going to the t
v
) Well, dear
we should carry it home
Nick and Carol lift the t
v
Do you need help
We can manage
They move toward the front door, Carol going backwards
Thanks anyway
Nick looks to make eye contact with Carol
He can't
She's looking back over her shoulder for obstacles
He smiles and glances toward the couple
Nick and Carol go out the door, lugging the t
v
(calling out) Nice meeting you
The man and woman look at each other
They look around the room
They're not done painting
They'll finish
She stares out the front door
(whimsically) wonder where our furniture is
She looks back to him
He's staring at the ceiling
: - They're lugging the t
v
across to Carol's -- Carol backing up and Nick going forward
They arrive at the front door
Nick takes most of the weight of the t
v
, while Carol fumbles with her key into her front door lock with her free hand
You're not going to be their new neighbor
It was just something to say
Carol gets the door open
Good
Carol backs into the house, leading the way
'  - They lug the t
v
toward the living room
You look terrible
Yeah
Well,  had a big day
(after a beat) went to my parent's house
Like you said to
And there was this ancient man, this giant man in the doorway
They step into the living room
- Carol leads them to a corner
And  thought, "It's my father
My how he's aged
" You were drunk
They gingerly put the t
v
down
Not at the house
At the house  was stone sober
Nick slumps down onto the sofa
Carol watches him, puzzled
He was very tall
He was too tall to be my father
He was wearing a long overcoat, and  thought, "it's a trick, he's on my mother's shoulders"
He smiles at the memory
And then out from behind him came this beautiful young girl
Beth
Beth
(lost in reverie) And they sang to me
They sang "London Bridge is Falling Down"
(singing softly) "Falling down, falling down
"
Nick looks to Carol
She stares at him
(seriously) It was very touching
'm sure
(defensively) It was
Carol sits beside him
Nick
Yeah
What you've been doing
you can't do anymore
Nick looks to Carol, puzzled
You just can't do it
(after a beat, agreeably) Okay
(very skeptically) Okay
Yeah
understand
No
don't think so
(defensively) understand
(determined) It's not like you can't do it
(interjecting) 'll stop
(urgently) It's that  don't want you to do it
've stopped
She stares at Nick
He avoids her stare
She takes his face in her hand and makes him look at her
(staring in his eyes) Nick
(emphatic) don't want you to do it
Nick stares in her eyes
(calmly, after a beat) Okay
She lets go of his face
Shit
(after a beat, wryly) hate talking to you
: '  - Through the windshield we see Sid driving slowly, looking out at motel parking lots
Their neon signs reflect in the windshield
Gas stations, fast food joints and motels
Sid and his truck pull away from the strip and up onto the on ramp
- Sid and his truck pull onto the highway
As Sid's taillights disappear down the barren highway
