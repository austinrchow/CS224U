Rosario
Nice to meet you
This's my brother
And my father
Burt and Joseph take one look at her and respond with subdued "hellos
" She is not exactly, well, - And she isn't white
She picks up on this, tries to act as though she doesn't care
Burt turns to Bobby: We gotta talk to you
Alone
This gives him pause, but Rosario gives him a slight nod of her head, assuring him it's okay
So: - Jack and Michael are walking through the seemingly empty main hall of the church
Looking for anyone who may be hanging out, ducking in and around
They spot a , making out in one of the pews

The couple sheepishly exits the room, pulling on their clothes
As they do, they pass: Bobby, Burt, and Joseph coming up the stairs
Joseph pulls up the rear, standing behind his father
Bobby sees Jack and Michael, now seated several rows back
, then: (') Hello, Bobby

Burt brushes lint off his son's shoulder: () 11
: Your hair's long

[To] tell me my hair's too long
Joseph speaks up, diverting Bobby's attention: Bobby,  asked Pop to bring you here
Whatsamatter
Joseph eyes his father with trepidation, then begins: Well
'm gonna be heading up a new narcotics team, starting this week
Russian unit, outta  2 in Brighton
(lights a cigarette) That's a good hook for you
Yeah, they need me over there
There's only eleven guys in the whole department that even know the language right now, so
Bobby looks behind him
He's
Interrogation- style, his brother at the fore, Bobby nonetheless remains calm, almost cheery
To Jack, in the back: You ever talk

listen first
Bobby, we need you to do us a favor

Oh, he needs a favor
(to Burt, needling) () () 12

` good lookin' boy
Not amused, they withdraw the photo from in front of Bobby
He's dealing , cocaine, angel dust
Operates out of that club you manage
The El Caribe
Bobby's sense of humor disappears now

No, we know that
We checked up and down the rest of management, too--his uncle, the owner-- The old man
What, you been watching us
Everybody come up clean
It's just Nezhinski we're lookin' at
(back to Burt) What the fuck is this
() 13
: (3) We need to track how he's bringin' in the product and
we were just hopin' you'd keep your eyes and ears open a little
You kidding me
Inform for you
That's what you wanted me here for
No, we would never ask you to do that
Just observe, that's all
It's a closed community and you're our only way in right now-- Yeah well, find another way
got a lot invested in that club and can't let it get fucked up
Nothing's gonna get fucked up, Bobby
All it takes is one thing, you know that
One guy to flip, we crack the whole thing
Michael Solo pipes up from the back: Bobby, it's important
These ain't dumb guys we're talking about
We don't stop `em up front, coupla years from now, it'll be chaos out there
() We'd be wishing the Italians'd come back
Bobby is still focused on his brother, then to his father: [You] Fuckin' broadsided me
Everything's about the goddamned job with you
Burt remains stoic
(Though silent so far, he should be a presence in the scene--others look to him for reaction, approval, etc
) Joseph sharpens: Whole city's falling apart, Bobby-- don't you got any sense of responsibility at all
() 14
: (4) 'mon
Get off your fuckin' high horse and bust somebody else's balls
(finally, to Joseph) All right, go downstairs
Lemme talk to him
Burt gestures to Mike and Jack, and they exit
Joe doesn't respond at first
Then, begrudgingly, to Bobby: Thanks for coming
You're welcome
Just be careful out there next coupla weeks
' that supposed to mean
Joseph
Joseph lingers, leaves
Father and son
Then, staring straight ahead as he takes a drag of his cigarette: Congratulations
You got me up here

' Good
Then now you know
Bobby starts to leave
Burt grabs his arm: Hold on a second--lemme ask you a question

Yeah, keep laughing--your mother, rest in peace,  think she was too easy on you

Bobby turns his back on Burt, getting up to walk downstairs
Burt remains emotional, reaching out to his son when Bobby is not looking, lowering it to no avail
The music is off now
Bobby comes down, Burt follows
Joseph is getting something whispered in his ear by another cop
squat man with a bad toupee starts to speak: Deputy Commissioner
Everyone

Rosario is leaning up against a post, drinking, watching the party
She stares down a  who With a sense of humor, she winks at him: You take a picture, it'll last longer
Bobby approaches Rosario, grabs her hand: 'mon, let's get outta here, [we'll] go party with Jumbo
He tugs her away
She stops him
With assurance: We could stay if you want, baby
They don't like me,  don't care-- you're better than them anyway-- (waves her off) We're goin'
'mon
() 16
: She hurriedly puts down her drink
Joe stands near Spiro, but his attention is on his brother: 'm Deputy Commissioner Spiro -- Bobby, Rosario move to the exit
: (') You know, we look around in these troubled times, and in moments like this we need leaders, men and women who can bring order back to our great communities
We're here this holiday season to give thanks for one of these men, our Russian brother, Joseph Grusinsky
Joseph smiles, waves
Filled with hubris
(') Joseph, many of us've known your father, Deputy Chief Burt Grusinsky, for many years, and know he wants to say a little something
Chief
for Burt, who waves, steps up: Thank you
You know,  used to tell my kids, "work first, play later," and my son Joseph really took it to heart
He's been a real fighter over the years
He overcome his mother's passing, and the dyslexia--eventually wound up graduating John Jay as salutatorian and distinguished himself many times
(turns to Joseph) Anyway, you've shown yourself to be very brave and selfless, and 'm just, 'm very proud here tonight

Rosario bounces down on the bed
Reaching under the bed sneakily, she pulls out a small box
She hides it
Then: talked to my mother yesterday
She said she'd be okay by herself, so  could move in if  want
That's cool
(without self-pity) Your family ain't gonna be too happy, though

All my guys,  tell `em, the mind and the body, they're connected

He grabs her: (') You hear what  said

But  need the money right now, Bobby
And 'm not gonna rely on you for -- Bobby purses his lips, frustrated
Then: Just hold off then, for a little while

Bobby knocks on the doorframe to announce his entrance
When Buzhayev spots him, the child hides behind Marat's leg
Marat lets out a laugh at this; to the child: No no--it's okay
Say hello
The boy waves perfunctorily
(') Now--we go this week to the field, okay
To ride the horses
Go to Mama
Marat addresses the boy clutching his leg (- a Russian "go"), kisses him, and the child runs off
Bobby steps closer to Marat: Mr
Buzhayev

Anyway, 'm sorry
It's not your fault
Marat darkens considerably
More interior tone, almost as much for himself as for Bobby: (') You can't always control everyone in your family

Marat brings his hand to his head, looks pained

: You don't mind my saying,  think that's probably the right thing to do

Awkward punches are thrown

Silence, then: don't know, Joe--forgive me, but uh, your brother
Ever since your mother got sick-- () Do me a favor, don't get involved

The cops turn to each other
Burt tries to prep himself, but it's impossible; we  the cracks in his sangfroid: It's Joseph
He's at St

Burt does his best to stay stoic
You want us to contact your other son--

Lou sits next to Bobby, partnering with him in the game and whispering into his ear from time to time
Rosario sits next to Bobby and watches the game intently
The poker pot seems exceptionally large is the main one competing with Bobby
Bobby's a mess, maybe worse than we've yet seen him
But he is , his eyes
He and Louis look at their cards

She sees a small bruise he's got on his forehead, kisses it
Baby, you got a little bruise here-- That ain't nothing

She kisses his bruise again
Louis pokes her
Smiling and pointing to his crotch: got a bruise too, you know--right here
Rosario lets out a loud laugh
Louis whispers pearls of wisdom to Bobby: (') So Bob,  think we fold

Bobby ignores him
Instead, aloud, to the Latino man: We'll see you and bump you two 's

Rosario has a slightly serious look on her face as she calls out to Bobby: Bobby--it's for you
Who is it
She shakes her head as if to say, " don't know
" Slightly peeved that he needs to attend to the call, he leaves the table
As he does so, Louis, to some girl, proudly: was the one told him to keep goin'
Then Louis grabs the pot for himself as Bobby picks up the phone, several feet away from the ruckus
He covers his free ear with his hand to hear better: Hello
( ) Bobby, it's Michael Solo-- got some bad news
() Your brother's been shot
He's at St
John's--they're workin' on him now
just thought you should know

The poker table in the background is a riot, a contrast to the sober message Bobby's getting
He turns his back to the crowd; sotto: Is--is he gonna be all right
Listen, your father's coming-- gotta go
But he's at St
John's
Bobby waits a beat, frozen, then does the same
Rosario knows something is wrong, approaches him
Bobby
My brother was shot

Rosario sees how remote he is, what a blow it is
She pulls him to her: You gotta go see him--be there for him and your father

Bobby moves to Louis: (') Louis, lock up and take her home

Everything cool
Hurt, Rosario spins around and enters Bobby's room, closing the door behind her
Yeah, no-- just remembered  gotta do something, that's all-- Pats Louis' arm as if to reassure him
Then the Latino Man tries to grab some of the pot
: Hey--
What the fuck
Louis moves over to the , holding them back (odd--they weren't going anywhere to begin with): Take it easy,

But quickly he darkens, and starts to walk right past him
Sotto: Pop
Burt keeps walking
Bobby follows: (') Pop, he all right
Bobby touches his father's arm, and Burt spins around: What do you want
You stayed out of it--you got what you wanted
Why don't you go somewhere and pick a fight--you're good at that
Bobby is speechless for a moment
Burt pulls his arm away and walks on

Is that it
Listen,  ain't judging you-- called you `cause  thought you had a right to know
But we're gonna be going hard after Nezhinski--and maybe some other people you're close to
Like that girl you know-- That's bullshit--she's clean

He looks through the glass to  Burt, still speaking to the Mayor
Bobby storms out of the room to: 47

Charges past the Guard
(') Hey
The Guards stop him, and a messy struggle ensues
All of a sudden, Joseph's wife  emerges from the ward
She looks devastated
The struggle stops
All fall silent, out of respect
Bobby steps back
Sandra turns to look at Bobby
To the Guards: It's okay
Bobby walks toward the entrance

Your father just left for the precinct
Bobby nods subtly, mouths a "

He walks to the doors
Pauses
: Joseph's bed is in the back of the large space
His face is blocked by hospital curtains
Bobby steps forward
Slowly, he walks to his brother's bed
He peels away the Looks at '
Joseph's visage is completely  on the left side, covered with bandages that are soaked with blood
The emotion surges within him; he's
It is a surprisingly painful moment
We can  he didn't expect this level of destruction
His mouth drops open slightly
Joseph's eyes open just a bit but don't look at Bobby
Bobby slowly lifts his fingers, touches Joe's arm gently
His fingers move down to his brother's hand
Joseph is unresponsive but conscious
All of a sudden: Sir
Joseph's hand closes around Bobby's fingers
The connection is huge
Bobby's eyes well up, and he rubs them, almost ashamed of the emotion
It is a shocking of  from him
He leans over haltingly, kisses his brother's forehead: (') Sir, 'm sorry--
visiting hours are over
He waits a beat
The Nurse gently pulls his shoulder
He backs away, his eyes reddened
The camera   a on  as we  : - loud, active hallway of a housing project
Graffiti on the walls, trash on the floor, but
Bobby emerges from the elevator, emotionally distraught
He , in one far corner of the hall, two young Latino teens smoking
He goes to one of the apartment doors,

: Behind her, is
(The woman who answers the door is clearly Rosario's mother
) '  - Rosario's mother discreetly backs away from the door
He and Rosario stare at each other for a moment
Bobby gropes for words
His emotions bubble up inside of him; then, barely audible, his voice cracking: Feels like it was my fault
He sinks down, holding her tight, his head at her stomach
She gently strokes his hair, kissing the top of his head
She shakes her head to reassure him, whispering "no
no
"
In this moment, he needs her
In this moment, he is like a twelve year-old boy
: -   - Across from the El Caribe
It's like a scene out of Balm in Gilead here--raucous clubgoers are eating burgers and drinking coffee after their nights on the town
Bobby and Rosario and Louis sit at one of the tables
Bobby kisses Rosario on her forehead as she reaches into her purse
She looks through a small ziplock bag with a vial of cocaine
Louis, meanwhile, is unaware of Bobby's state of mind, and is busy putting on a show--as usual: Where'd you run off to, like a Jew
You got outta there, it became like a real zoo
The spics-- (looks to Rosario) `Scuse me--the
s, they're goin' nuts for the money--picka picka picka picka--and the girls, they're screamin', and 'm keepin' everybody in line
'm fuckin' bustin' heads, like Bruce Lee--'m fuckin' bustin' heads-- He gets up and starts kicking and chopping in the air in the clumsiest manner possible
Accidentally kicks the waitress, who's bringing the check
(') Oh, `scuse me, sorry about that
Bobby picks up the check, hands Louis some cash
() 50
: Hercules, do me a favor--before you kill a waitress, go pay the check
Arright
But 'll tell you Bobkes, nobody else could ever do for you what  did
Louis smiles, walks off
Scoops up the tip from a nearby table
Don't tell Louis nothing about what happened
Far as he knows, my family moved away, [a] long time ago
ain't ever gonna say nothing just thought
maybe he could cheer you up a little
Bobby kisses her atop her head
: enter the establishment
They create a ruckus
Spotting Bobby and Rosario, Vadim ambles toward them: Hey, look who's here
Hey Vadim
(as Vadim approaches) We were just gettin' something to eat
(nods; to Bobby:) You make it through that bust okay
Bobby gives a simple nod as well
Inside, Bobby is extremely uneasy, though outwardly he is quietly confident: didn't have nothing on me
Glad to hear it
Without making eye contact, Bobby shrugs; then: Your uncle's got some problems now, though
() 51
: (2) () He does what he gotta do,  do what gotta do
He don't own me
(to Rosario) Baby--why don't you go keep Jumbo company, make sure he leaves a tip
`Kay
Rosario leaves the table
Two  walk by: Hi, Bobby
Bobby nods to them
Vadim watches them walk away
Then: You know-- (moves closer; :) still got my shit coming in
Some of us think you could help get it out there
It's a little dangerous right now, don't you think
We got a lot of muscle behind us
Lotta muscle
The brazenness of the comment shocks Bobby
He looks up, begins to focus
Incredulous
Softly, as the camera a   on : Muscle--
That's right
cop got hit today
They ain't never gonna sit still for that
Another member of the gang speaks up: Pavel: () 52
: (3) Police are a fuckin' joke, dude-- the Mickey Mouse ain't gonna do nothing
Pavel , and Bobby looks at him with real resentment
Vadim pushes Pavel aside, motions for him to sit down elsewhere
Vadim pulls up a chair
Sits down
Intimate: Bobby, those cops--they, they ain't no problem
Vadim turns over his hand
graces the palm of his right hand: (') You see this
got this on the inside, at Tchita
You earn these
() So don't worry--we'll get `em all
Cut off the head, the body'll fall, right
You keep on doin' it `til they get the message
(even quieter) We got all their names
On a list
Vadim leans back in his chair
Bobby's eyes widen
Vadim makes a "" sound
Bobby tries to hide his shock
Vadim grabs Bobby's arm, squeezes it
') Just think about it
You change your mind, you call Pavel
(nods; then) 'll see you around
And the men move to another table
Bobby looks at Rosario and Louis, who're standing by the register
They turn back to Bobby and , totally unaware of the conversation that's just taken place
as we  : It's a huge municipal structure
Bobby bolts inside

Almost like a fraternity house

Pushes his way through the crowd toward the main desk

Urgently: need to find Deputy Chief Grusinsky
Oh, uh, he's on the second floor, think
In the muster room

He  his father, talking to a  of
Burt sees him, keeps talking
Bobby touches his arm
Pop,  gotta talk to you

It's important-- got information
Bobby pulls his father aside, looks around to be sure the two of them are out of earshot of others
Forcefully: (') It's about you
Burt is surprised
His attention sharpens: (') It's bad
Burt realizes the severity
Then we : () 54
: (
) Jesus Christ, you gotta be kidding me
- large room, lit by fluorescents
Mostly empty of furniture in the center, with vending machines against the wall and a sole   in a corner
huge   is on the wall, conspicuous, a hint perhaps of the violence to come
It is Bobby and Burt, Jack and Michael
Bobby's been telling his story
He and Burt are seated--Jack looks out the small window in the door, then turns the  for privacy; and a nervous Michael is pacing: Nezhinski got a hit list
On us
Bobby looks at his father, then nods
Mouths an almost : Yeah
Michael purses his lips, then spins around to Burt
We gotta go bust `em, Burt--right now
He betrays no hint of concern: No
They'll be back on the street in a day
We gotta try and catch `em with their hands full--find out where they got the real weight
Then we can move
That could take us forever
Doesn't matter
It's our only play
Uncustomarily, Jack speaks: say we go hit `em all
Wipe `em out, suicide-by-cop-- What're you talkin' about
'mon, don't be a first-class schmuck
() 55
: But we don't got the time to infiltrate `em-- Burt lets his temper flare; briefly, we  a more mature version of Bobby: Then we make the time
(to Mike, Bobby) Look,  want you all to understand something--we don't ever play in the dirt here, okay
Not ever, no matter what
() You piss in your pants, you only stay warm for so long
What about callin' in the Feds
They got a lot more juice than we -- Bunch of college boys from Kansas
We protect our own here
Bobby sees an opening: Pop, Nezhinski's been talkin' about a shipment he's got comin'
Maybe that's how you get to him
How you know about that, Bobby
(somewhat sheepish) They been wanting me to buy in for a while
Michael turns to the others
Brightening: Well, maybe that's it, then
If we can get him-- (re: Bobby) To set something up, maybe one of our uncles could move in-- () 56
: (2) (pointing to Bobby; with some ridicule) It'd have to be him-- Forget it, both of you
What do you mean, set something up
-- You'd go set up a buy with `em, just like they've been asking you to
We follow you to the spot, bust `em a week later
That way, your name's clean, nobody knows you're involved-- That's too dangerous for him
We don't know how solid his cover is out there
(to Bobby) That girlfriend of yours, she knows about you, right
So can we just get back to the discussion please
beat
Bobby is dead serious: Pop
What
You could trust her
Good
'm glad
But it's not happening
So forget it
But
but you could get killed-- Don't worry about me, just worry about yourself, arright
Anything happens with your brother 'll call you
Goodbye
() 57
: (3) beat
Bobby is still there, fixated
(') Goodbye
Finally, Bobby exits
We  : '  -  - Bobby enters his room, which is dark
Rosario is here, asleep
Her back to Bobby
Upon hearing him enter, she turns and looks at him (and ) in
Bobby sits on the edge of the bed, touches her back
She senses something wrong and speaks, voice ravaged by sleep: Everything okay
() They said on the television your brother was doing better
Bobby nods
(') Me and my mother, we said a prayer for him
Something seems to dawn on Bobby: Your mother's real important to you, ain't she
You'd do anything for her
Yeah,  guess
She looks at Bobby, who appears deep in thought: (') You thinking about your brother
About your family
() There was nothing you could do
Bobby leans over, kisses her: Go back to sleep
He lies down next to her, still fully clothed
Stares up at the ceiling
She whispers to him: () 58
: Bobby
It's all gonna work out
You'll see
- Burt and Jack and Michael
Burt is talking to the others in front of the hospital, but we are in  , and we can't  them
Burt shakes their hands, then walks inside
Mike and Jack walk in the opposite direction
stands inside an abandoned parking kiosk
(He's been watching from afar
) Jack and Mike approach their parked car
He tries to obscure himself partially inside the kiosk
They see him
You been up to see my brother
Yeah
Your father's still with him- -we were just gonna go back to the Try and figure out a tac plan on Nezhinski
How's that been goin'
We don't got much yet, but we'll do our best
() You all right
Bobby hesitates, then reveals himself completely: Well
been thinking
if you could keep it confidential
() 'd make the connection for you
'---- They trust me--we could go in large, use my money for the buy, they won't suspect anything-- () 59
: It's too dangerous--you heard your father
() He don't gotta know anything about it
Does he
If anything went wrong, he'd never forgive us
know
() It's just-- realized
(strains to utter) my father dies `cause of all this,  couldn't live my life knowing  coulda done something
(looks at both men) know the same is true for you know it is
,
(') So please--can we do this
Jack, Michael turn to each other
Then:
a  : "" small office equipped with telephones, headsets, and fold out chairs
Lockers line the walls
Bobby's on the phone, waiting for someone to answer
: Jack and Michael are here too, with  ,
Finally: ( ) Hello
Hey
It's Bobby Green
() decided-- wanna buy in
( ) How much we talkin' `bout here, dude
Bobby looks to the cops
They start mouthing something, but he ignores them: () 60
: Fifty k, to start
Mike and Jack's hairs stand on end upon hearing this
Oh, [the] man's gonna be good with that
How `bout tomorrow night
Sounds good
Arright
We'll meet at El Caribe, `round midnight
(with a sly laugh) That way, you could dance a little, say hi to your girlfriend
Okay
'll see you tomorrow
Bobby hangs up
(') Most expensive phone call  ever made
We'll get it back for you
Jack reaches into a nearby  for something, then approaches Bobby and hands him a small
(') Now listen: from now on, you'll get all your information through this, at an undisclosed location
Your contact with us is over after you leave here
Bobby takes the
Michael touches his shoulder: (') Just be smart about things
Okay
You get burnt and we gotta put you in protection, it's still better than winding up dead
An informant dies, they talk about you for a day
week later, ain't no one remembers your name
() Moral of the story is, don't die
You understand
() 61
: (2) as he sobers
Nods
Then: You need to promise me something, though
You won't investigate my girlfriend--she's, she don't know any better
She won't be a target
Just make sure she don't open her mouth
'll take care of it
Michael grabs Bobby's shoulder, a gesture of affection
You know we known you your whole life, kid
Good luck
'  - Bobby enters the bedroom
Presses his answering machine button, and a message begins to play
It is Rosario
' Hi, Bobby
It's me
Just wanted to see how you were doing-- guess you're at the hospital now hope your family's doing good
Okay,  love you
Jumbo says hello too
As her voice plays on the machine: he moves to the dresser, where he opens the top drawer
: --his
He begins to take the money out of the drawer and count it when: we  a
He quickly looks over,
He stares at the paged number
- #1 stands by a bench, almost floating in the fog
He is stocky, dressed in a down vest
Bobby enters the frame, trepidatious; he and the man eye each other for a moment, then Bobby holds out the beeper
The man takes it
#1 takes out      and its accessories
Among them, a
He Complex electronic innards
() 62
: #1 Your wire's in here--we're gonna follow the signal
Find the stash house and make the deal, you leave the rest to us
You gonna leave me all alone out there
#1 (shrugs; then) ain't gonna lie to you
There's always a risk
Man #1 hands Bobby the
He  it
It works
#1 (') Your cover's blown, call for help-- don't try and be a hero
Just get outta the way--place could turn into a butcher shop
Talk about pussy--that'll be our signal to come in early
You come up with that one all by yourself
#1 (ignores the joke) Just do the deal and get out
Bear in mind, your life is in that lighter
Anything goes wrong, the department'll get word to your father
The Man unceremoniously turns to leave
Then, suddenly: #1 (') And oh--
told me to tell you-- your brother's coming along real good
They reset his jaw and sometimes he's awake
Bobby acknowledges that with a single nod of his head
The man departs
Bobby grasps the lighter tight, looks at the man as he virtually disappears back into the fog
- It is an older Catholic church, a beautiful interior line of young Latino women hold candles, singing as they walk toward the altars
Rosario is here
() 63
: She lights a candle at the altar, then walking back to the pew, she   and approaches
Bobby looks around, seeming harried and paranoid
Bobby--what're you doing here
Bobby looks at her, his eyes filled with emotion
-- need to talk to you
'm coming home in a little bit
He doesn't respond at all
(') Bobby
He appears almost in tears
Finally, sotto: --'m gonna inform
For the police
() 'm gonna help `em set up Nezhinski
Rosario is shocked
Almost inaudible: What
As she steps back, he moves forward: had to do it, Rosario
These motherfuckers--they were gonna come after my father
Rosario tries to recover
Can barely speak
Sotto: But Nezhinski finds out, he'd kill -- He ain't ever gonna find out
He ain't ever gonna know
But what if something goes wrong
What's gonna happen to you
() 64
: (2) don't know
'd, 'd probably have to go into protection
Oh my God
Rosario breaks down, tears flowing
Her hand to her mouth: But that's never gonna happen
How could you not even talk to me about it
Bobby spins around to see if anyone's listening
He pulls her into a dark corner of the church: Rosario, listen-- had to do it
Bobby pulls her to him, holds her tight
In her ear: (') had to do it
Rosario is emotional
Then: (') Everything's gonna be all right
Don't worry, it'll be all right
Still fervid, she is silent
up
- Bobby enters the place, determined
He has   tucked under his arm
Many  say hearty  to him
People are dancing, having a glorious time
, to see Bobby
He  him, effusive, heartfelt: Bobkes
My brother
been calling you all week
Where you been
We missed you
Yeah
Sorry, buddy-- got some legal shit to deal with, from the raid
But  ain't forgot about you--'ll be back soon
() 65
: Yeah well, without you around hadda lower myself here by hangin' out with Freddie
Bobby gently pats his old friend's shoulder
Interrupting this, Freddie steps in: Bobby, hey
Mr
Buzhayev'd love to see you, 'm sure--want me to tell him you're here
No, it's okay--'ll talk to him later
He then walks by the
He and  see each other
He turns,  Pavel, in back
Pavel waves to Bobby, and Bobby starts walking to him
Bobby approaches a table, reserved for Pavel and the rest of the gang
Bobby joins them, with his bag
Where's Vadim
Oh, he don't come in here no more-- () Well,  got fifty grand in here
And it don't move `less  deal with the man himself
() So [if] you're interested,  wanna see your stash, right now
No bullshit
Pavel thinks a moment, eyes his cohorts
Back to Bobby: Be on the boardwalk in a hour
Bobby turns to leave
Pavel calls after him: (') And dude--this don't shake out
() 66
: Pavel quickly draws his hand across his Adam's apple
Bobby exits, passing by  as he does
She gives him a fearful look
- The famous Brighton Beach boardwalk
Bobby stands in the cold, waiting, holding his bag of money
Alone
Takes out the , the
He fires it--it works
Looks at his watch
In rummaging through his pockets for a smoke, he finds a little slip of paper with a phone number on it
He  a nearby
Bobby holds the paper in his hand, dials the number
voice answers: '  ( ) Hello
'  - on the phone, in bed
Nearby, Sandra is folding his blanket around him
Hello
- Bobby says nothing
( ) Hello
Bobby  Pavel's
Bobby hangs up the phone
Takes a deep breath
We : '  (
) Dude
Hey, dude
Bobby approaches the car
Pavel is in the back seat, calling to him with the window open
Get in
Bobby approaches the automobile
Pavel is in the back seat, calling to him with the window open
Another American sedan behind them
Bobby enters Pavel's
Bobby takes the front passenger seat
Pavel is behind him
Someone we '  is driving
() 67
: Bobby is somewhat edgy, with Pavel behind him
The car pulls away from the curb
Then: Pavel throws a small towel over Bobby's head
'
Bobby is startled by the action, blinded
Trying to stay calm
Put your hands out, where  could see `em
You know me
Shut your fuckin' mouth and do it
Bobby obliges
The driver, looking anxiously in his rear view mirror, makes a  , and the car
Pavel then   , searching for a wire, anything incriminating
To the driver: (') Turn at the light
The  makes
In Russian, subtitled: (') Go left
Again
The Livery Car makes another brutal  , tires screeching just slightly
Pavel again: ' Let's go
No one's on us
The camera   a
The Livery Car pulls up to the curb
We are on: a strange residential street with tenements and graffiti everywhere
Dark, deserted
Many silhouetted figures stand in doorways up and down the block
They are all armed, with shotguns and machine guns slung over their shoulders a few yards away
The men get out of the car
They pull Bobby out: 68
They walk up the stairs,  Bobby up over the steps
He stumbles
They pick him up, lead him to a door
-  - Someone pulls the hood off him
Bobby looks around
The room is
The driver puts Bobby's bag of money down on the floor
wearing a comes and puts one on Bobby's face as well
Bobby surveys the place
Where the hell is he
With that mask on his face, we  his , loud and present, through the sequence
It could be night or day, we wouldn't know
The windows are blocked with duct tape to obscure all light
There is hanging from seemingly everywhere
Parts of rooms are cordoned off with the material through the space like apparitions
- takes Bobby's bag of money, leaves the room
Stands Pavel, masked as well, armed now with a Kalashnikov rifle
Without a word, he motions with a move of his head to Bobby
" ," he seems to be saying
Bobby enters the room, right behind Pavel
He : a dresser with a clock on it and a small mirror
Tables set up in the middle of the room with brown jars on them
There is a television on in the corner, a Russian ethnic musical program silently unfolding
There are other people in the room: a - ; and two dark-haired -
It's an assembly line for the preparation of narcotics
The   takes out the
Starts counting them methodically
Pavel motions to the Brown- Haired Man, puts up two fingers
On cue, the Brown-Haired Man rubs his hands together, then takes two large  from his desk
Beneath the desk, Bobby spots what looks like an   of packages of , stacked against the wall
This is clearly
The Brown-Haired Man pours powdery contents from a jar out onto his desk blotter
He sits down, takes off his jacket, : ,
() 69
: The designs combine several images--skulls, snakes, and the element that marked Vadim's own tattoo
He takes a   --it had been sitting atop the desk--and pierces a
White powder seeps from the package
Bobby watches from behind the mask as the man pushes and pulls what looks like pure cocaine in powder form
He uses two   to move the drug
Bobby eyes that The Brown-Haired Man dips a measuring spoon in another powder to add to the mix
He is cutting the drug
He continues to manipulate the substance, and his hands move with a kind of grace that one expects from a seasoned chef on a cooking show
on some lines of
Pavel takes a toot
He  it to Bobby as a taste
Bobby accepts
He pulls down his mask momentarily,  a ,
We : ' You needed to come here tonight
Bobby looks over to see:    , :
Everyone is wearing a surgical mask--except, of course, for him
Bobby eyes him with eyes that seem to become more  by the second
What's the matter, ain't Pavel good enough for you
That's all the money  got
And ain't gonna leave it alone
The Slavic Youth finishes counting Bobby's cash: It's all there
Fifty grand
Vadim points to the : Where'd you get this
From my savings
From El Caribe and Rasputin
() 70
: (2) (nods; then:) That buys you three keys in here
() With the crack on the street, it's worth two hundred k
Maybe more
Vadim walks over to a stack of green packages: (') All the shit  get here is at least eighty-six percent pure
And we got a lot more comin' in--a more
In a way nobody could ever trace
Vadim steps away from the narcotics and towards Bobby: (') The whole city'll be sucking our glass soon--you'll see
We push the Guineas out, the Domos'll work for us
Sounds good
Vadim looks at that money again, takes a step forward
Bobby's forehead has beads of sweat
Vadim walks up close
Looks Bobby in the eye for a
You're breathing heavy
took a little taste
Vadim puts his hand on Bobby's chest, checking his heartbeat
You know,  seen fighters--they breathe like that, means they get nervous
() You nervous
Bobby shakes his head
He is wired, out of it, but he pulls himself together
His jaw clenches
With fire, an edge of defiance: 'm clean
() () () 71
: (3) (') You wanna search me again, you go `head
just wanna make this deal and go home
Vadim violently pulls out Bobby's pockets
Out falls: a ,  , ,   ,
He sifts through the items, lighting the lighter
It fires
Bobby gets slightly edgy
Notices that the others congregate around the objects from his pocket--all except for Pavel, who holds an -47 trained on Bobby
Bobby inches ever closer to the rusted   that the Brown-Haired Man had used to open a package of cocaine
Vadim puts down the lighter
And it occurs to him: You got both matches and a lighter
Bobby realizes instantly that Vadim is right
Bobby shrugs, feigning innocence
He braces himself and decides to give the signal: 'm gonna get pussy from this
() What you say
Bobby looks around
There's
He tries again: [When] this deal goes down, 'm, 'm gonna get a lotta pussy
Still

Bobby scans the joint

He slips the   into his hand

Setting himself, Bobby looks around the room--where's that backup

It  toward the : This time, it
It is The camera

Pavel bleeds profusely all over Bobby's chest, and this is a fight to the death
() 73
: Bobby wrenches the   out of Pavel's collarbone and desperately--and repeatedly--stabs Pavel in the base of the neck
Pavel's screams mix with gunfire to make a hell
:    blows the top of Pavel's head clean off, spattering Bobby's face with brain particulate
Bobby is forced to get out from under

Panicked, he cocks his gun, searches for an escape route

Dodging the bullets
An  Police Officer does not recognize Bobby as an ally, and he trains his assault rifle on Bobby
Bobby screams, his hands raised: 'm with you

This is , with all the ammo being dispensed, and Bobby knows it; so he dodges the Officer; the Officer begins to unload his weapon, getting  to

Hands on your head
His hands are in the air
Don't shoot
Officers pour in, among them
Cops forcefully push Vadim to the ground
Start to cuff him
Burt pulls Jack : Where's my goddamned kid
Jack is speechless--he doesn't know
(We  that Burt's question--revealing Bobby's identity-- on ' ) Vadim mutters, aloud but sotto, in Russian: () He is a dead man

Bobby looks at his father, his face nicked by many small cuts from the glass
Sheepish, he cannot say a word and averts his father's gaze
Jesus
He's gonna be okay, Chief
(to others) Clear out
Burt eases when he hears this
They move Bobby toward the ambulance
Burt turns to Michael
Sotto: You guys go on a bust like this and you don't tell me about it
You think 'm born yesterday
guess we do
You're a real comedian
He's gonna need to be in protection now
Bobby sits up on the stretcher as a  treats his leg
Burt approaches, watches for a moment
The Medic leaves the post for a moment, and the two are
Burt stares at his son, who finally speaks: 'll be all right, Pop
(shakes head; then:) Well,  guess  don't have a say in anything anymore
Anyway
You did it
You did it and it took real balls
() But now you're burnt--and we gotta get you someplace safe, keep you under wraps for awhile
need you to get my girlfriend, Pop
need her to come with me
() 76
: Burt is getting emotional, aware of how close his son came to death
Trying not to show it--and failing
'll get them to take care of that
Just go get yourself fixed up-- that's the most important thing
With that, the Medic returns, and with a heavy heart, Burt closes the ambulance door
Bobby is alone with the Medic for a moment in the back of the vehicle; he watches through the window as his father walks to his car

He uses his hands to cup Bobby's: Bobby, hi
Spiro Giavannis, Deputy Commissioner
Glad to see you made it out here today
Yeah
They let me come--long as brought these guys with me
Bobby points to the   next to him
How's the leg treating you

Rosario leans in to Bobby: Bobby, 'm gonna go outside for a minute, have a smoke-- Just hold on, `til he gets here

Gee, that's great
Well listen, you need any help, you give us a call
`Cause we can be part of your family too
He gives Bobby his
Bobby takes it, mutters a "thank you
" Spiro pats him on the shoulder, leaves
Bobby turns to Rosario, knowing she's somewhat out of place here
Children run by, having fun
Bobby eyes them, then he leans closer
Sotto, tender: lotta kids here, lotta family
It's nice, ain't it
She nods
Whispered: (') You know how happy  am you're with me
Yes
He leans over, kisses her
, who'd been looking out the window, turns back toward the house
With a huge smile on her face: Here they are
Bobby brightens, begins to stand with only a little difficulty as he anticipates Joseph's entrance
As this happens, Rosario slips out from under his grasp: `Be right back
And she walks off
Bobby watches as she enters: 79
Rosario closes the door on Bobby, turns on the running water
Then begins to rummage through her purse
Finds a small vial of cocaine inside
Takes it out, opens it, but The drug spills into the water, washing it down the drain
Frantically, she tries to finger whatever residue is left on the porcelain
:  and Sandra, his wife
Joe holds two bags--one filled with cards and memorabilia, the other with clothes
What seems like a   are here when he walks in
Everyone
moves right behind him, all smiles
Joseph is thrilled--but somehow not the same
His face doesn't look bad, but one eye is a different color from the other, and he's had reconstructive surgery on his jaw
There is, of course, a scar, and he's lost a lot of weight
Behind him, Burt waves everyone closer
Jack and Mike and other faces we can recognize from around the precinct stand back, all smiles
-
An elderly comes forward, giddy: Wow, fella
You look great
(pointing to his own ) Your eye--does it hurt
Only when  look at you
Then Joseph
He : , next to the   who haven't left his side
The two brothers make eye contact
The crowd quiets a bit
Bobby smiles at the sight of his brother
Joseph gets emotional, too: (') Hey, Bobby
Without a word, Bobby nods, moves to his brother
As Burt looks on, pleased, Bobby takes his hand and grips the back of Joseph's neck
Joseph pulls his brother to him by his neck
real embrace
Joseph pats Bobby's back
'm real glad you're home
The two separate, both smiling gently
Breaking the moment: () 80
: Everyone, let's, let's move inside-- there's plenty to eat
Soft laughter
Small talk begins
The group dissipates, moves to eat, etc
Burt moves to Joseph: Joseph--we got some things we need to discuss, when you get the chance
We could do it now if you want, Pop
In the den
Burt nods, reluctantly
All our men walk to the den-- except for Bobby, who hears: , down the hall
She approaches him
Bobby, 'm gonna go back to the motel
What're you talking about
They got a lot of food over there--why don't you go eat something
(shakes her head) --'m gonna go back

Bobby senses she's not completely right
Looks into her eyes, then, more an accusation than a question: () You fucked up
muttered "no" from Rosario, hardly a committed denial
Before he can say anything, from the , Burt peeks his head out: Bobby--you should hear this too, for the trial
Burt motions for Bobby to enter the den
Back to Rosario: We gotta straighten this out later
Bobby then moves to the den

Bobby enters the room
As he does, we : Nezhinski's cache was huge, about 40 keys--yayo, some angel dust too
We're gonna try and turn him, get him to tell us how they're bringing it in
But don't worry--we'll make sure he does plenty of time
He ain't gonna be reliable, Pop
Bobby closes the door behind him softly
Joseph sees Bobby, is surprised he's here
Well, you marry an ape, you don't complain about the stench of bananas
Where is he
He's at Rikers
Tucked in, nice and comfy
We're taking him to the next week, for a meeting
wanna go with you on that
See his fuckin' face

Thanks

: Clean
We tailed him for weeks
Goes out with his grandkids, takes `em horseriding at Floyd Bennett Field
Checks on his fur business from time to time--we even looked at some of the coats and tore `em apart
Turned out to be fake sable, if you could believe it
It's comin' up quick, we don't know anything
We're gonna lose it
Joe--this is still new territory for all of us

Michael points to Bobby, who up until now had been focused on--and concerned by--his brother's behavior

And my family takes the hit--my family
An awkward silence
Everyone's pained
Bobby stiffens: Could you guys go outside for a minute
wanna talk to my brother
Michael hesitates, then nods
Everyone wheels around and exits the room
Jack follows Mike out the door
Bobby turns to his brother: (') You're trying to do everything-- it's gonna kill you

[The] streets'll get flooded, the whole City's gonna be on fire-- We could handle it

But you don't gotta do everything yourself
That's what 'm trying to tell you
Bobby eyes Joseph, who looks deeply troubled
Bobby sits
(') Joe, what's wrong
Come on, you can tell me
() deal this big, something's gonna come up
You'll see--someone'll fold
Joseph ponders for a beat, then comes out with it: It's not that
It's just
You give up what you wanted to do to be here, Bobby
And part of me feels a little responsible
Nah, you didn't do nothing
It's meant to be
You can't fuckin' control it
(slight laugh) You know,  remember when Pop was mad at you, he always used to say you didn't believe in our family
And Mom, she'd protect you
She'd give you those little caramels
Anyway,  knew he was wrong too, but  didn't say nothing
Just then: the Uniformed Officer  and -: Bobby, Rosario Diaz just called again
Tell her 'm on my way back now

She asked us not to, Bobby
She's-- Bobby--we can't do that legally
Bobby tries to charge past them
The Guards all restrain him delicately ("'mon, calm down"), but Bobby is in no mood and instead starts a melee
He is a tour de force of energy, and it takes no less than everyone here to subdue him
The  is more a   than anything else, and it is messy, tough: '--'-- Bobby's forehead is cut; the struggle is
The Guards rouse up enough strength to   into the for
Bobby paces, in a rage

Bobby stares at the door
You gonna keep me here
Still in a fury, he takes a lamp and Then he  the lamp toward a mirror on the wall,
Exhausted, he stops
Moves to: Where he sits on the edge of the bed, touches his neck

He throws it to the ground; and then, perhaps motivated by the realization of his situation, a flood of feeling comes over him
Tears begin to fall down his face, and he succumbs
It is as though all of the emotions in our story find their outlet here, in this moment
Bobby lets all the remaining feeling drain from him until he has nothing left
After this outburst, he is exhausted
He calms, breathing heavily

We  the  of a  : - noisy Queens place, its blue collar patrons watching boxing on the television and cheering

Marat holds up his hands to quiet the clapping: (') We also have an old friend who's come back to us-- want him to stand--Bobby
Ladies and gentlemen, Bobby Green, who used to be our manager here

Marat waves to him, Bobby nods, sits
The  swings back to Marat who finishes up his introduction ("Enjoy the show

") and exits to still more applause , Marat's son-in-law, approaches Bobby
In his : My father-in-law would love it if you come upstairs later, to say hello
Okay, Eli
Tell him 'll come up
Eli nods, exits

Then, sensing Bobby's mood: Bob, you all right
(hesitates; then) Rosario--Rosario's gone down to Florida for a little while
Florida
() Well, she probably just needed a little time for herself
She'll be back
Yeah
(more interior) You know,  was just thinking `bout when  first met her here
Working back there
Ah, don't worry, Bob

Louis turns to watch the show for a beat, takes a huge swig of his
Then turns  ; close to Bobby: (') mean, between you and me, that place they had you in was drivin' her crazy

Then, finally: () 117
: (3) Louis--
(Lou turns to him) How'd you know where  was staying
Huh
How'd you know where  was staying
() It was, it was in the papers
Bobby gets up with astonishing speed and moves right next to Louis
He grabs his arm tightly and, in his ear: It wasn't in no papers, Louis
Don't make me embarrass you
Let's go outside, right now
The camera   a   on  as he
Still grabbing Louis's arm, Bobby wrenches him loose
Louis stumbles and falls to the asphalt
Bobby steps Something is different about him now
He is colder than ice, his eyes black saucers of rage
Where's Nezhinski
don't know-- Don't play games with me, Louis
But  don't kn-- just said, () Rosario tol' you where we were staying, didn't she
She trusted you
Louis begins to crack
Tears come to his eyes

You don't mean nothing to me now-- that part of my life is dead
(beat; for himself) Today it ended for good
Bobby  swear-- don't know nothing
You know my father is dead because of you
Louis begins to sob quietly, shivering
He brings his hand to his mouth
Bobby takes a threatening step forward: (') You know 'm on the Force now
And could do anything to you
Louis' eyes widen
He holds out his hands defensively
No, wait
Bob, please
(beat; weakening) Don't do this to me
(even softer) Don't do this to me Bob, please
You tell me what you know right now or  swear to Christ  will make you disappear
Louis is crying loudly, like a ten year-old
He falls to his knees
Shivering in fear, he moves to Bobby's feet: Bobby,
told `em where you were--but, but it ain't what you think
was makin' a buy and these guys in hoods, they held a gun to my head--so  tried to give `em the wrong information
Bobby clenches his fist
Louis grabs onto him again: () 119
: (2) (') No, wait, listen
It's true
Rosario tol' me you moved every couple days, she said you was gonna move-- thought you'd be gone by then
It's the truth, Bobby would never try and hurt you
Never, swear to God
Bobby stares at him for a moment, then his teeth grit
He tries to calm himself but cannot
With a ferocity, he unleashes a brutal punch across Louis' face with the brunt of his fist
Louis collapses

Now when we get there, it'll be up to you what we do
But  hope you think about droppin' the hammer on `em
Joseph contemplates this briefly, then Jack pulls him : () 122
