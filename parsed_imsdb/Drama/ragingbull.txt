: -   -  (1964) , wearing a tux, is shadow-boxing
We are unsure of where he is -- he moves in and out of the shadows
At 42, he's overweight and out of shape, but the balls of his feet still pop up and down like they were on canvas and his tiny fists still jerk forward with short bursts of light
He is rehearsing a nightclub monologue
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
It's a thrill to be standing here talking to you wonderful people
In fact, it's a thrill to be standing
haven't seen so many people since my last fight at Madison Square Garden
After that fight, a reporter asked me, 'Jake, where do you go from here
'  said, 'To a hospital
'  fought one hundred and six professional fights and still none of them bums figured out how to fight me -- they kept hitting me in the head
And that's why 'm here tonight
(starts to sing) 'When the fighter's not engaged in his employment, his employment, although he was Champ and quite the rage, he must go somewhere else to seek employment, seek employment
But a fighter's life is not a bowl of cherries, still 'd rather have an egg than a fist upon my face
That's Entertainment
' -  (1941) Bam
, a fast, black middleweight, jabs , 19 years old, in the face
staggers forward
No matter how hard  is hit, no matter how often, he always staggers forward -- like a bull
The bell sounds
Battered,  slumps on the stool in his corner
It's September, 1941
Europe and Asia are already at war
Young , freshly recruited, dot the hostile audience -- each screaming at the  in the ring
Suddenly, words are exchanged, a  screams, and a and a  stand and start swinging

You didn't have to come to Cleveland to get beat by a "moulan yan," Jake
He's got you, Jake
You're outpointed
You're coming up for the tenth
You gotta knock him out
The bell sounds for the tenth

slides away, jabbing, punching, piling up points
In 's corner,  stands and yells at : grand apiece
We got a grand apiece on this, Jake
fucking grand
suddenly corners  and unleashes a desperate, wild alley-fighting attack
One ferocious punch after another
The  go wild; everyone's up for the kill
staggers, then falls to the canvas
The  counts: One, two, three, four
The  call out new odds; ten to one for , the underdog
, excited, sees that time is running out and steps in front of the bell
He swings his arms, pretending not to realize he literally holds back the 's arm for a few seconds
This gives  more time for a knockout -- but not enough
is pushed back and the bell rings at the count of nine, ending the match
Boos and cheers
The  scramble back to the  to get their money
dances around the ring, kissing his gloves and thrusting them toward the
rushes out and hugs him
The  steps into the ring with the mike: Ladies and Gentlemen, the winner, under the rules of the Cleveland Boxing Commission, after ten rounds, by a decision -- Jimmy Reeves
The  holds up ' arm as his corner tries to lift him off the canvas -- still out cold bring in a stretcher
is stunned
He still prances around, now trying to figure out what happened
He raises his arms in victory, and the  go crazy, cheering, ripping chairs out, fighting with the , throwing bottles and junk into the ring
go into the ring
(to Jake) Don't get out of the ring
You won the fight -- let him go out first

Only then do  and  escort  out of the ring

In the street, two young , 13 or 14 years old, exchange words and start to fight
Their  cheer them on and  turn the corner
Salvy, would  steer you wrong
Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right
Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there, (he points; the ) take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes
The money's with your brother
What do you want from my life, Salvy
He's my brother
He ain't doin' the right thing
He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'
Can't you make him understand that
goes over and starts to break up the fight
(to cop) Hey, leave the kids alone
Get lost
(joking, he knows the Cop) Hey kids, " cop is a rat
" Remember that, " rat

Here's your steak
You can't wait for it to be done

She slams the steak onto his plate, and reaches back to the stove
(') Here's your carrots
You're in such a hurry
You can't wait
No,  can't wait
You know when wait
When it's important to wait
It's not important to wait for no steak
It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring
It ain't important to wait for no steak won that fight
So,  stayed in the ring, and that way  made sure everybody knew it
shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch
He starts to eat the steak
He takes a drink of wine
(') Wait
'll wait
But let me tell you, if this steak was the middleweight championship, 'd show you how 'd wait
'd eat it raw
'd drink the blood
'd eat it before it came out of the cow -- that's how 'd wait
'  / - and  approach the building
can't convince him
He's got such a thick head, 'd like to crack it open myself
Believe me, my own brother
It's very hard
You don't have to convince me --  know we should be with Tommy
You talk to him
He don't listen to nobody
Look, 'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels
Jake is makin' it hard on himself
Tommy wants him with us

And even if  put on enough weight to be a heavyweight, 'd be too slow to fight
No matter how big  get, 'll never be big enough to fight Louis

All right, Jake, you're being talked about as the top middleweight contender
Do you think another victory over Sugar Ray will get you a shot at the title
Why not
There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid
don't see why  shouldn't have a shot at the title right now
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York

He respects her as he would a shrine; he slowly removes her sheer nightie
His round hands caress her smooth skin

She is shocked and surprised

This Robinson,  gotta beat him again

No more deals like this Janiro bullshit
didn't tell you to do it in the first place
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155
What did do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat
(angry) Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me
Now  don't know if can make it down to 155
'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if  don't make 155,  forfeit $15,000
You're supposed to know what you're doin'
You're supposed to be a manager
You want the title shot
Say what you're gonna say
You want the title shot or not

Don't be a smart ass

Knockout this fuckin' kid
'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title
Listen to me: 'm telling you
You been killin' yourself for three years
There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you
This Janiro's up-and-coming
He don't know
Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out
What are you worried about
Your weight
Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be
They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot
And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else
Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it
All right
Joey's right
Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking

(turns to Joey, referring to Salvy) Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here
Did you see the way she was lookin' at him
Nah, she would never

She told me no, but  don't believe her
(uncomfortable) 'mon, Jake
You know she's crazy about you

You think he's good looking 'cause  know you think he's good-looking

All rightg  don't have to hear any more

understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding
'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did
But, Joey, you don't raise your hands
You don't do that kind of thing
This time we forget about it but no more after this
You understand

Look Joey,  wanna tell you something
Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere
And 'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment
How can he embarrass you
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and 'm lookin' very bad can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood
Why's he make it so hard on himself
He comes to me, can make it easier for him
Tommy, Jake respects you
He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that
But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it
'm his kid brother
got no say with Jake on this
He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own
Make it on his own
Does he know the kind of money involved
mean the real money
He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own
We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world
nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody
Is he really crazy
Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him
don't care how great he is or how colorful
He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to
He ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us
'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head
- Another day

is sitting alone near the deep end
walks over to him
Whatcha doin'
remember the first time  met Vickie
know there's somethin' up
know she's doin' somethin', but  can't catch her
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to
What do you mean
Try talkin' to her
She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter
When 'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her
Tell me the truth
Jack, if there was anything funny, would tell you
want you to keep an eye on her when 'm not here
Understand
Sure, 'll keep an eye on her

You were a big favorite in this fight
Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog
don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner
'm just a fighter
Now the fight's off the books altogether
Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight
Some people are saying you're going into the tank
Believe what you want

That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle

Except fall down like a normal person
Yeah, except fall down
That's right
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest

Marcel Cerdan, a really great champ, after  beat him

he quotes lago's speech in Othello
(') "'Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy
It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock the meat it feeds on
That cuckold lives in bliss who, certain of his fate, loves not his woronger; But , what damned minutes tells he o'er who dotes, yet doubts -- suspects, yet fondly loves

Is leaning cheek to cheek
Is meeting noses
Kissing with inside lip
Stopping the career of laughter with a sign
--  note infallible of breaking honesty -- horsing foot on foot
Skulking in corners
Wishing clocks more swift
Hours, minutes
Noon, midnight
and all eyes blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only, that would unseen be wicked
Is this nothing
Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing; The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing; My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings, if this be nothing
" -- That's from something called "The Winter's Tale" -- Shakespeare
You all remember Shakespeare
He wrote all them famous plays one after the other, then he went into a big slump and he ain't done anything good in years
That speech is about jealousy -- jealousy's a bad thing
Jealousy bothers a lot of guys
take me
almost killed my brother
love him
he's my family
mean, there's nothin' he wouldn't do for me
And that's the way we been goin' thru life -- doin' nothin' for each other
Anytime he got in trouble when we was kids,  got him out of it
You know, he used to steal little things when we was growin' up
But he was particular
only stole things that begin with an 'a' -- a watch, a car, a suit, a ring
But  was wrong shoulda never hit my brother
Afterwards,  was sorry
Now every time  need somethin'  gotta go shoppin' for it

Robinsin didn't use a machine gun but it was still a massacre

In fact, by the end of the fifth round  really had him worried --- he thought he killed me
You know,  could keep tellin' you this brilliant material all night -- but you'd only laugh

It's not just that he's a little drunk -- no, his voice is defiant, sadly defiant
He is singing at the  rather than to them
(') "When the fighter's not engaged in his employment, his employment, although he was Champ and quite the rage, he must go somewhere else to seek employment, seek employment
So what does he do
He goes upon the stage and meets his true adversaries, all you members of the human race
But a fighter's life is not a bowl of cherries, still 'd rather have an egg than a fist upon my face

The curbside window is halfway up
She calls to him: Jake
, chagrined, steps over to the car

Slept at the club

You're too drunk all the time
There's too many girls can't

made up my mind
tries to reach in the window, but  hits the power switch, closing it and catching his hand
She now has to yell to him: (') You got three days to get your stuff out of the house
After that, the cops will be there
have the kids with me
never want to see you again
turns her face and drives away
grabs at the Cadillac, but it is bigger and stronger than him
is left alone in the parking lot
The car is gone

Ever since  left, it's also been his apartment
The place is a mess
sends his laundry out when he runs out of clean clothes
Dirty socks, shorts and shirts are scattered randomly
Empty whiskey bottles on the desk, empty beer cans in the wastebasket

Huh

'   - , wearing a suit, walks up to the door and pushes the bell
opens the door and looks at him over the chain
Vickie, open up
need to come in
Are you drunk
No
Open the door
tries to touch her face through the doorway crack, but she steps back
(') Please, Vick
won't bother you
'm out on bail
You can send the kids next door
just gotta pick one thing up, then 'll get outa here
thinks a moment, then opens the door and lets  in
The kids are sleeping
promise  just gotta pick up one thing
All right, just don't make any noise
'   - walks directly past  into the living room watches from a safe distance
removes his jewel-studded championship belt from the glass bookcase and carries it into the kitchen
In the kitchen, he takes a hammer and screwdriver out of a drawer, places the belt on the counter top, and starts digging the jewels out of it
appears in the doorway
What are you doing
need ten thousand dollars
My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped
But they don't have a case against you
(digging at the belt) Are you kiddin'
Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court
Did you see the papers
"LaMotta on Vice Rap
" Everybody likes a shot at the Champ
Jake, be careful
What're you doing to the belt
Don't make no difference no more
Can't you get the money from your friends
What friends
, frustrated by his task, turns the belt over and hammers at it
The jewels scatter across the counter top and floor
collects the jewels and puts them in his pockets
- stands at the counter of a small jewelry store
The examines the stones
Didn't you also wish to sell the Championship Belt, Mr
LaMotta
That's it
Those are the jewels that were in the belt
But where's the belt
You want the jewels or the belt
Both
These stones are worth about fifteen hudred dollars, but the belt of a champion is a very rare item
The belt with the stones untouched would have been worth near five thousand dollars
seems to despair of the whole thing: the belt, the attempt to raise 10 g's, the vice case, his life
- places a call from a booth outside the jewelry store
(on phone) can't raise the ten thousand
Fuck 'em
Let 'em put me on trial
- Same as Scene 1
, 42 years old, continues to rehearse
He is seated across from a mirror
So there  am in the can
and not the one that says "gentlemen" on the door
'm talkin' about jail
Down south
mean, jail up north is gotta be like summer camp compared to jail down in cracker country
And if you're a guy like me, you ain't got a chance in a place like that
Especially if you're Italian
you come from the Bronx
and you're an ex-champ
As soon as they saw me
soon as they heard me know 'm in trouble
To me, they got an accent, and to them,  got an accent
You gotta get the picture -- 'm big,  got small hands,  walk like 'm still in the ring
the balls of my feet pop up and down, you know
and whenever get the chance,  read a lot
So naturally, takin' all this into co sideration, they figure it adds up to one thing -- 'm queer
Now didn't mind too much when they called me "Queer" or "Mr
Tough Guy" or "Yankee Punk"
But one day these screws got to me
was workin' on the work gang, pickin' up some trees that were knocked down by a storm or somethin' and puttin' 'em on this truck
All of a sudden
one of the trees slipped and fell on me and pinned me to the ground
'm lyin' there with a tree across my chest
This screw walks over, takin' his time, he looks down at me and says, "Well, Champ Pimp
you lyin' down on the job again
"
They got a great sense of humor when they're standin' there with a gun in their arms and you got a tree on your chest
So  look up at him and say, "Oh, this tree
it fell on me
" And he says, "Oh, 'm sorry
If 'd have known,  would've yelled 'timber'" said, "Hey, look
it hurts think maybe  broke somethin'
" He says, "Well, whaddaya know
Champ PImp's got himself a boo-boo
" Then got as stupid as him
said, "If 'm Champ Pimp
how 'bout givin' me the money you made last night
"
Then another screw comes over and says, "This Yankee creep givin' you trouble
" -- What kind of trouble
What am  gonna do -- hit 'em with the tree
Now anybody else in their right mind would've said, "No sir, wouldn't think of giving any of you gentlemen trouble
just want to serve my time and get the hell out of here as soon as  can
" That's anybody else
When  said it
it was a little different
"You stupid cracker
take your hands off me or 'll get up and kick your brains out -- but first you gotta bend over so  can find 'em
" Next thing  know 'm in the hole
Solitary confinement
All my life  had guys in my corner yellin' "Go get 'em, jake
kill 'em
You're the greatest
" Now there's nobody rootin' for me
But it wasn't so bad
learned things there
learned how to scratch a calendar on the wall
never knew how to do that before
Now  know
Monday is one scratch
Tuesday is two scratches
Wednesday is three scratches
And so on
Except for Sundays
Sundays is no scratches

They take  to the "Hole" -- solitary confinement

Both  push  into the cell and slam the door

The rough cement walls are covered with obscure graffiti

The room is mostly darkness
Sounds are more tangible here than sights

collapses to the concrete floor
His hands are smashed
He cries, then sobs

Please
'm not like that

Then silence
We begin to hear:  doing a monologue
(') And so, as Shakespeare said, 've been down so low there's nowhere else to go
-  (1958) The Metropole is a club on 7th Avenue off Times Square
, 36 years old and wearing a hip Fifties suit, continues his monologue
Except here, gentlemen, with you bums
call you "gentlemen"
but you know what you really are
You know, this place used to be pretty exclusive
now they got bouncers outside to throw the drunks in
My first night here  said to the boss, "Where's the toilet
" -- He said, "You're in it
" By the way, this engagement is just a stepping stone for me
If  do good here, 'm ready to get out of the business
The  starts to shout: "Get the fuck off the stage
" (') , ,  know what you're waitin' for -- and from the looks of you, you been waitin' for it for a long time
had my own joint in Miami Beach once
it was too high-class for you guys
we had a 50-cent minimum charge just to keep out the riff-raff
The  continues to shout, as before, also shouting: "Bring out the girls
" (') Hey, sorry
Here's your girls
(grabs his crotch) Yeah, she's here
just like it's advertised out front
She's come back
girl who's seen the Lower Depths
who's been as far as have in that direction
She's on her way back up now
give you an idea how low she was
Let's give her a warm welcome
make her glad she's back, boys
-- Miss Emma 48's
gets off the stage as   48's goes into her dance
He goes over to the bar and gets a drink in -shirts - a disreputable looking lot - are at the bar
- The Club is closing
and , the stripper, come out and walk by a delicatessen on their way to a parking lot
sees his brother  enter the delicatessen
Look, sweetie, be a good girl
Here's some money
Take a cab
Go home by yourself
Just wanna walk around a little, sort of unwind
Will  see you later
Yeah
dunno
'll call you
goes to the parking lot entrance as  gets into a cab
: - It's about twenty minutes later
of  waiting by the parking lot
He looks at the delicatessen
finally comes out carrying a paper bag
Not noticing , he walks right past him to his car which is parked near the rear of the outdoor lot
Hey, Joey -- walks towards  with his hand outstretched
looks at
Silence
turns his back and starts to get into his car
runs over to  and grabs his shoulder
(') No, Joey, no
Look, wait a minute, please -- looks at  like he's shit, throws 's hand off his shoulder, and starts to get into his car again
(') Aw, Joey -- stops  from getting into his car
He puts his hand on 's shoulder again
(') You're right
You're perfectly right
You got every right in the world to hate my guts
pulls away from 's hand, and tries to put the paper bag into the front seat of the car
(') No, please
know  was a cocksucker
You're right
shoulda never raised my hands to you
half pushes  away, and begins to get into his car again
pulls  by the arm
(') No, Joey, listen to me -- pulls too hard, causing  to drop the paper bag to his feet
The containers of coffee and tea in the bag break open and splatter 's pants legs
stares down at his pants, then up at
Suddenly, he belts  with a left and a right to the jaw
is taken by surprise, and backs off to get his own hands up
keeps pouring it on
drops his hands and takes it
(') Go ahead
(gets punched) Hit me again
(gets punched) deserve it
(gets punched) Pay me back
(gets punched) More
(gets punched) stops in mid-punch and stares at
He can't figure it out
nods and tries to smile, but starts to cry instead
(') More
Go ahead, Joey
deserve it
pauses, then finally throws a very weak punch to 's shoulder
He leaves his hand there -- then, uncurls his fist -- and finally puts his hand around 's neck as tears start to fill his eyes
hugs  close to him, crying
They hug each other, both crying
They don't say anything
-  (1964) The theater lights are flashing
This may not be Broadway, but it's a long way from the Metropole
The entrance to the Barbizon looks out on the corner of 6th Avenue and Central Park South
stand-up billboard in front of the theater advertises "An Evening with Jake LaMotta
" The billboard also lists the authors whose works will be performed: Paddy Chayevsky, Rod Serling, Shakespeare, Bud Schulberg, Tennessee Williams
- Same as Scenes One and Eighty-One
is alone preparing to go onstage
He rehearses
You know, 'm not a philosopher or anything like that but  been around a little and the way  look at it is -- We're, all of us, lookin' for the same thing: a shot at the title
No matter what you wanta be
you wanta shot at bein' the best
Well,  had mine and it'll always be in the record books
it don't make no difference what happens to me from here on in --  got my shot and that's a fact
Some guys weren't that lucky
like the one Marlon Brando played in "On the Waterfront" -- an up and comer who's now a down and outer
You remember
there was this scene in the back of the car with his brother Charlie, a small-time racket guy, and it went somethin' like this -- "It wasn't him, Charlie
It was you
You 'member that night in the Garden you came down my dressing room and said
'Kid, this ain't your night
We're going for the price on Wilson
' You 'member that
'This ain't your night
' My night -- coulda taken Wilson apart
So what happens
He gets the title shot outdoors on the ballpark, and what do  get
one-way ticket to Palookaville
never was no good after that night
It was like a peak you reach
Then it went downhill
It was you, Charlie
You was my brother, Charlie
You shoulda looked out for me a little bit
You shoulda taken care of me just a little bit so  wouldn't have to take them dives for the short end money
You don't understand
coulda had class coulda been a contender
coulda been somebody -- instead of a bum, which is what  am
Let's face it
It was you, Charlie

) Hey Jake, how you doing
The shadow exits
How long do  have
The shadow pops in again
(
) About five minutes The shadow exits
pauses, then starts to shadow-box in his dressing room
His breath comes in quick gasps
His feet pop up and down like they were on canvas
His tiny fists jerk forward with short bursts of light
Still alive
Still a contender
42-year-old man fighting for his shot
The   into a   of his fists as they hit the empty air -- in and out of the frame
This quote appears: (Music in) "Verily, verily  say unto thee, Except a man be born again, He can not enter into the kingdom of heaven
