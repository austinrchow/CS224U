) Did you know there are more people with genius 's living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States
(
) That can't be true
(
) it is true
(
) What would account for that
(
0
) Well first of all, a lot of people live in China
But here's my question: - is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of any physically intimidating attributes masks a very complicated and dangerous anger
He has trouble making eye contact- and sometimes it's hard to tell if he's talking to you or to himself
, also 19, is Mark's date
She has a girl-next-door face that makes her easy to fall for
At this point in the conversation she already knows that she'd rather not be there and her politeness is about to be tested
The scene is stark and simple
How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600 on their 's
didn't know they take 's in China
wasn't talking about China anymore, was talking about here
You got 1600
You can sing in an a Capella group
2
Does that mean that you actually got nothing wrong
Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar Or you get into a final club
Or you get into a final club, exactly
like guys who row crew
() Well  can't do that
And yes, it means got nothing wrong on the test
Have you ever tried
'm trying now
To row crew
To get into a final club
To row crew
No
Are you, like--whatever--crazy
Sometimes, Mark-seriously- say two things at once and 'm not sure which one we're talking about
But you've seen guys who row crew, right
No
Okay, well
they're bigger than me
They're world class athletes
And a second ago you said you like guys who row crew so  assumed you'd met one
guess  meant  liked the idea of it
The way a girl likes cowboys
3
The Phoenix is good
This is a new topic
It's the same topic
We're still talking about the finals clubs
Would you rather talk about something else
It's just that since the beginning of the conversation about finals clubs think  may have had a birthday
We can change the subject
(can't get over it) There are more people in China with genius 's than the entire population of-- It's about exclusivity
' what is
The final clubs
And that's how you distinguish yourself
The Phoenix is the most diverse
The Fly Club, Roosevelt punched the Porc
Which one
The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best of the best
actually meant which Roosevelt
Theodore
4
Okay, well, which is the easiest one to get into
takes a cigarette from a pack, lights it, takes a drag and blows the smoke out before he says
Hm
What
why would you ask me that
was just asking
They're all hard to get into
My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting on oil futures last summer and he won't get in
Money or the ability to make it doesn't impress anybody around here
Everybody can do that
He made $300,000 in a summer
He likes meteorology
You said it was oil futures
If you can predict the weather you can predict the price of heating oil
You asked me that because you think the final club that's easiest to get into is the one where 'll have the best chance, () 've lost my place again
You asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that's where have the best chance
The one that's easiest to get into would be the one where anybody had the best chance
just think you asked--the placement of where you asked the question-- was honestly just asking
Okay
was asking just to ask
Mark, 'm not speaking in code
Erica-- You're obsessed with the finals clubs
You have finals clubs  and you need to see someone about this who'll prescribe some sort of medication
You don't care if side effects may include blindness, okay, just do it
Final clubs
Not finals clubs and there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated
Yes there is
Well you do--that was cryptic--so you do speak in code
didn't mean to be cryptic
'm saving  need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs
Why
Because they're exclusive
() And fun and they lead to a better life
You think Teddy Roosevelt got elected president because he was a member of the Phoenix Club
He was a member of the Porcellian and yes do
6
Maybe he sang in an a Capella group
want to be straight forward and tell you that  think you should be a lot more supportive
If  get in 'll be taking you to the parties and you'll be meeting people that you wouldn't normally get to meet
() You would do that for me
You're my girlfriend
okay, well  want to be straight forward and tell you that 'm not anymore
() What do you mean
'm not your girlfriend anymore, Is this a joke
No, 'm sorry, it's not
You're breaking up with me
You're going to introduce me to people wouldn't normally get to meet
What the fuck is that supposed to mean
Take it easy
What was it supposed to mean
It was--Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink is that you used to sleep with the door guy
() want to really try not to lose it now
() 7
(') The door guy's name is Bobby
haven't slept with the door guy, the door guy's a friend of mine
He's a perfectly good class of people and what part of Long Island are you from--England
'm from Westchester
'm going back to my dorm
Wait, wait, thisi reel
Yes
apologize, okay
Siddown
'm going back to my dorm,  have to study
--- Yeah
'm sorry and  mean it
appreciate that but-- Come on
--- have to study
You don't have to study
Let's just talk
can't
Why
Because it's exhausting
Going out with you is like dating a stairmaster
All  meant is that you go to
and so you're not likely to-- wasn't making a comment on your parents-- was saying you go to
have to go study
You don't have to study
How do you know  don't have to study
Because you go to
stares at him
(') () Do you want to get some food
'm sorry you're not sufficiently impressed with my education
And 'm sorry  don't have a rowboat
think we should just be friends
don't need friends
was being polite,  had no intention being friends with you
You're really leaving
takes 's hand and looks at him tenderly
() Listen, You're going to be successful and rich
But you're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a tech geek
And  want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true
It'll be because you're an asshole

And with that stinger,  walks off and we stay on  as the pulsing intro to Paul Young's "Love of the Common People" ---- (') (calling over her shoulder) And you're never getting into a final club
Along with the , we slowly push in on
fuse has just been lit
: Fall
Semester, 2008 : - As  busts out of the bar, past Bobby the door guy and into the population of Harvard Square
: - As  continues on, he passes a group of people heading in the opposite direction for a party
As 's steady and determined stride continues, he'll
pass by all kinds of (seemingly) happy, well-adjusted, socially adept people
The vocals from the Paul Young song come in-- '  ' ' : / - As the   and  busts into the lobby of his dorm
He doesn't look at anyone as he heads up the stairs and : '   - bedroom that's part of a three-bedroom suite
The as  walks in, flicks his lap-top on without looking at it and walks out of frame as we stay on the laptop
' ' ' ' Then a moment or two later, a glass with ice gets set down next to the lap-top
Then a carton of orange juice followed by a bottle of vodka
's fingers dance easily on the keyboard---like a Juilliard pianist warming up
In the exact time it takes him to pour the vodka and orange juice over ice, the website he's just called up gets loaded onto the screen

So what if it's not even 10PM and it's a Tuesday night
The Kirkland Facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous f acebook-pics
Billy Olson's sitting here and had the idea of putting some of these girls' faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on who's hotter
: - We'll be cutting back here a lot in this sequence, with the Paul Young song tying them together, as we show---mostly --- preparations under way for the hottest party on campus tonight
We start on a good looking  fixing his tie in the bathroom mirror
He walks out of the bathroom and into the main area where he's immediately tossed a bottle of champagne by a similarly dressed
We see that there are a couple of dozen other guys around
Our guy takes the champagne bottle and sticks it on the bar, which is being stocked by two sexy  uniformed
Our guy walks past

Our guy trots down a set of mahogany and red-carpet stairs, opens a heavy door and looks out to the sidewalk

'm not gonna do the farm animals but  like the idea of comparing two people together
It gives the whole thing a very Turing feel since people's ratings of the pictures will be more implicit than, say, choosing a number to represent each person's hotness like they do on hotornot
com
The first thing we're going to need is a lot of pictures
Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook so 'm going to have to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in

People came to Facemash in a stampede, right
Yeah
It wasn't because  put up pictures of hot girls
You can go anywhere on the internet and see pictures of hot girls
Yeah
It was because  put up pictures of girls that people knew
So if people Want to go on the internet and check out their friends, why can't  build a website that offers that
An online community of friends
Pictures, profiles, whatever you can click into, visit, browse around
All from the privacy of your dorm room

Like our own Final club except not only can we get into this one, we're the president

There was no reason to hack, people were going to put their own pictures up
What they were interested in, what they were looking for, what classes they were taking
and people had the ability to invite their friends to join
Or put a different way, not invite their friends to join
In a world where social structure is very important, that was sexy

Yes sir, At any time in the three weeks prior to Mark telling you his idea, did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss, Divya Narendra or HarvardConnection
Yes
He said they'd asked him to work on their site but that he'd looked at what they had and decided it wasn't worth his time
Uhh, he said even his most pathetic friends knew more about getting people interested in a website than these guys
"These guys" meaning my clients
43
Yes
He resented--Mark resented that they- --that your clients, probably thought he would jump at the chance to rehabilitate his image after the Facemash thing but Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything
With Facemash he'd beaten the Harvard computers, he'd beaten the Ad Board and he made the girls mad
Facemash did what he wanted it to do
kind of nods a little to himself

Yes
Let
me tell you why 'm asking
'm wondering why, if you needed a thousand dollars to start up your project, you didn't ask my clients for it
They'd demonstrated to you an interest in this kind of thing so-- From that you're deducing that  didn't go to them because  didn't want them to know what  was working on

"Okay

Right after we launched the site
Jesus Christ
liked th shorter one
They're saying--the Winklevoss twins are saying you stole their idea
find that to be mildly annoying
They find it to be property theft
Why-- -- --why didn't you show this to me
It was addressed to me
They're saying we stole theFacebook from Divya Narendra and the Winka know what it says
() Did we
What
Please don't screw around with me now
'm not
Look at me
What are you, my mother
72
The letter says we could face legal action
No, it says  could face legal action
It's from a lawyer, Mark
They must feel they have some grounds for-- The lawyer is their father's house counsel,  checked it out, they're not, --- Do they have grounds
Yes, the grounds are theFacebook is cool
and popular and sexy and HarvardConnection is lame
didn't use any of their code,  didn't use anything
guy who builds a really nice chair doesn
't owe money to everyone who,,, ever built a chair
Th ey came to me with an idea,  had a better one
Why didn't you show me the letter
didn't think
it was a big deal
If there's' something wrong--if there's ever anything wrong--you can tell me
'm the guy who can help
() - Is there anything you need to tell me
No, What are we doing about this
went to a 3- at Student Legal services and he told me to write them back
What did you say
: 73
() "When we met in January,  expressed my doubts about the site--where it stood with graphics, how much programming was left that  had not anticipated-- : '   - () "---the lack of hardware we had to deal with, the lack of promotion that was needed to successfully launch the website-- : - () "--etc
" This was the first time you raised any of those concerns, right
'd raised concerns before
/ Bullshit
/Not to us
() Fellas
(back to ) 'm talking about at the meeting in January to which this letter is referring
Yeah
Let me re-phrase this
You sent my clients 32 e-mails
In the first 31, you didn't raise any concerns
() Is that a question
74- In the 32nd e-mail you raised concerns about the site's functionality
Were you leading them on for six weeks
No
Why hadn't you raised any of these-- () It's snowing
'm sorry
It just started snowing
Mr
Zuckerberg, do  have your full attention
No
() Do you think  deserve it
What
Do you think  deserve your full attention
had to swear an oath before we began the deposition phase and  don't want to get arrested for perjury so  have a legal obligation to say no
Okay
"No" you don't think  deserve your attention
think if your clients want to stand on my shoulders and call themselves tall they have a right to give it a try
But there's no requirement that  enjoy being here listening to people lie
You have part of my attention--the minimum amount needed
() 75
(') The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook where my employees and  are doing things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients, are intellectually or creatively capable of doing

On the internet
That's why  came over

It didn't stop you from writing it
As if every thought that tumbles through your head is so clever it would be a crime for it not to be published
The internet's not written in pencil, Mark, it's written in ink and you published that Erica Albright was a bitch
() Right before you made some ignorant crack about my family's name, published my bra size and then rated women-based on their hotness
Why don't you say it to me now, why don't say it to my face
don't want to
(   ') Erica, is there a problem
No, there's no problem
() You're not a real person, Mark
You write your bullshit from a dark room because you're a failure at human contact liked you and  was nice to you

We had an idea for a website called HarvardConnection--we've since changed the name to ConnectU--and Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea and-- What do you want me to do about it
points to a row of Harvard Student Handbooks on the bookshelf behind
Well sir, in The Harvard Student Handbook, which is distributed to each freshman--under the heading "Standards of Conduct in the Harvard Community" and the sub-heading, "Honesty"-- Oh dear God
--it says, "The College expects that all students will be honest and forthcoming in their dealings with members of this community
All students are required to respect private and public ownership
Instances of theft, misappropriation or unauthorized use of or damage to property -- Excuse me, Anne
Yes sir
, Punch me in the face

( '  ) Sir, it's against University rules to steal
from another student, plain and simple
You've spoken to your ,
Yes sir, and the

Mr
Zuckerberg hasn't responded to any of our e-mails or phone calls for
the last' two weeks
He doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland and the closest we've come to talking face to face is when  saw him on
the quad and chased him through Harvard Square
You chased him
() saw him and  know he saw me and started after him and he disappeared You know he could have you arrested for harassment and attempted assault
() This isn't happening
don't see this as a University issue
Of course it's a University issue
There's a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both
You entered into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other
() 'm sorry President Summers, what you just said makes no sense to me at all
94, 'm devastated by that
What my brother means is that if Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer it would be a university issue, right

This isn't a petty larceny

Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told to do in your freshmen address

Well
would try letting your- imaginations run away with you on a new project
You would
Everyone at Harvard is inventing something or starting a new business in their dorm room- Harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than getting one so can  suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project

You don't have to be an intellectual property expert to understand-the, difference between right and wrong

But here's the beauty
You know  didn't understand what you just said, right
do know that
What's the beauty
Every 10th line of code written, they have to drink a shot
And hacking's supposed to be stealth, so anytime the server detects an intrusion, the candidate responsible has to drink a shot
also have a program running that has a pop-up window appear simultaneously on all five computers--the last candidate to hit the window has to drink a shot
Plus every three minutes they all have to drink a shot

The three   take us into - It's a hundred-year old theater that's been converted into a 21st Century hot spot for Silicon Valley's rock stars

And after a moment of placid quiet-- --- Two razor thin skulls explode out from under the bridge for the final, agonizing hundred-meter stretch of the ancient and prestigious Henley Royal Regatta
The two boats are neck and neck coming out of the bridge
The port-side boat is being crewed by the two Dutch members of the Ilollandia Roeiclub
The starboard boat is being crewed by a pair of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the "" of Harvard
We  the  come up from the  in the viewing section
The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at Ascot -- the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats, the men i n blazers and brightly colored floral ties
But the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd
Just their own breathing as they pull against the longest natural
straight stretch of water in the world--a mile and a half torture test against the best competition they've ever faced
And they're neck and neck
and  can't shake the Dutch
The  is going crazy in their own English way as none of them can remember ever seeing two boats this close this late
Mixed in with the British crowd is a small contingent waving the flag of Holland and a slightly larger contingent of Americans
124
We'll notice a stoic man in a  viewing section and latex we'll be introduced to him as Cameron and Tyler's father, Next to him is their mother, who can barely watch
Back on the boats it's just the breathing as the skulls slice through the water like jet-powered knives
50 meters now and there's still no daylight between them
We see a small trickle of blood from 's left hand begin to stream down his arm
25 meters and the Dutch and American fans are going crazy-- even the British aristocracy can't help but get caught ups the closest race in the history of the competition
The 'ATH_PT'i12 is silently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed-- the  has her hands over her mouth in praying position
The blood that's covering 's left arm is being diluted by the sweat that's pouring down from his triceps as they dig, and pull, and pull, and pull, and--- --the finish gun is fired into the air, the oars come out of the water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over

jumping up and down
The Americans bring their giant flag down and fold it up

Friendster has proven that fact
And 's now dropped the flaming cardboard box into the wastebasket where the fire grows larger
She casually kicks the basket over with her foot

The users are interconnected, that's the whole fucking point
College kids are online because their friends are online and if one -- (finally seeing the fire) Holy shit
--goes, all the dominos go
Do you get that
'm not going back to Caribbean Night at the Jewish fraternity

That was the act'of a child, not a businessman
And it certainly wasn't the act of a friend, You know how embarrassed was when  tried to cash a check
And was with a girl, Wardo
It happened in front of a girl
'm not going back to that life, () Yeah
Okay, maybe you were angry, maybe you were frustrated

Four documents, These two are common stock purchase agreements allowing you to buy stock in the newly re-incorporated Facebook instead of the old stock which is now worthless, The third is the exchange agreement, that's for exchanging your old shares for new shares and this is the voter holding agreement
How many shares of stock will  own
1,328,334
Jesus Christ
That's a 34
4% ownership share
Why the rise from the original 30%
Because you may need to dilute it to award shares to new investors
like dealing with business majors
#2 You should know that Mark's already taken his percentage from 60 down to 51
Mark doesn't care about money and he needs to be protected
Dustin Moskowitz owns 6
81%, Sean Parker 6-

And Peter Theil 7%

What else did the e-mail say
It said that we had to have a business meeting
That Mark and Sean had played some kind of revenge stunt on Michael Moritz and Sequoia capital
and that it had impressed Moritz so much that he was making an investment offer that was hard to turn down

All this while  is talking, The next transformative development picture sharing application
place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life
It is the true
digitalization of real life
You don't just go to a party anymore, you go to a party with your digital camera and your friends relive the party on Facebook
And tagging
The idea that you could tag anyone you wanted in those pictures so that people could find themselves
Then a digital log of every change in a person's life, broadcast to all their friends instantaneously
154, Would this be easier without the bra
It's worth finding out
The girls start happily slipping off their bras-- 've spent hours-- Why has the music stopped
've spent hours watching what people do when they log on
Seriously, why has the music stopped
has a point
The music stopped in the addle of 's speech and the sound outside from the party just doesn't sound like a party anymore
flow they always checked their friends' status updates, checked to see which of their friends had changed their profiles, changed their photos and mostly
We lived on farms, then we lived in cities and now we're gonna live on the internet

Something's going on downstairs, stops talking-he senses it too now

() We're sorry, was the music too loud
We've got kind of a celebration going
Ladies,  need you to put your shirts on

One of the policemen casually takes 's hand and sees that his palm looks like he just used it to erase a blackboard
The cop uses his finger to taste what it is
(') Yeah, that isn't mine
Okay, could you all stay where you are
And the handcuffs start to come out and we've got a room of terrified children
, Wait, can we just talk for a second
We start to move in on
