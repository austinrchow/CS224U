(
) Yeah,  worked in a barbershop
But never considered myself a barber
We track back from a barber's pole
(
) stumbled into it--well, married into it more precisely
We track back from a shopkeeper's bell triggered by an opening door
The pull back and tilt down show the top of the head of a customer entering in slow motion
(
) wasn't my establishment
Like the fella says,  only work here
We track along a shelf backed by a mirror and holding pomade, aftershave, hair tonic, a whisk brush
(
) The dump was 200 feet square, with five chairs, or stations as we call 'em, even though there were only two of us working
We track in on a big man in a barber's smock scissoring across a lock of hair that he pulls taut between two fingers of one hand
In slow motion, he laughs and chats
(
) Frank Raffo, my brother-in-law, was the principal barber
And man, could he talk
Another man in a barber's smock is running electric clippers across a child's head
cigarette between his lips
(
) Now maybe if you're eleven or twelve years old, Frank's got an interesting point of view, but sometimes it got on my nerves
Not that 'd complain, mind you
Like said, he was the principal barber
Frank's father August--they called him Guzzi--had worked the heads up in Santa Rosa for thirty-five years until his ticker stopped in the middle of a Junior Flat Top
He left the shop to Frankie free and clear
And that seemed to satisfy all of Frank's ambitions: cutting the hair and chewing the fat
Me,  don't talk much
He plucks the cigarette from his mouth and taps its ash into a tray
(
) just cut the hair
The barbershop is empty of customers
Late sun slants in through the front window
The two barbers--the narrator and his brother-in-law--sit in two of the barber chairs, idly reading magazines
Says here that the Russians exploded n -bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it
Uh-huh
How d'ya like them apples
Beat
Ed
Huh
Russians exploded an -bomb
Yeah
(shaking his head) Jesus
(
) Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves
For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie
We cut to examples of the haircuts as they are ticked off: (
) the Flat Top, the Ivy, the Crew, the Vanguard, the Junior Contour and, occasionally, the Executive Contour
Adults get variations on the same, along with the Duck Butt, the Timberline
Ed trims the fringe around a balding head
(
) and something we call the Alpine Rope Toss
He snips one long lonely strand of hair and carefully drapes it across a bald pate
(
) lived in a little bungalow on Napa Street
The place was , guess; it had an electric ice box, gas hearth, and a garbage grinder build into the sink
You might say had it made
We float slowly toward a white bungalow on a quiet street as a black coupe pulls into the driveway
(
) Oh yeah
There was one other thing
We track in through a bedroom door to discover a woman putting on a girdle
(
) Doris kept the books at Nirdlinger's, a small department store on Main Street
Unlike me, Doris liked the work, accounting; she liked knowing where everything stood
And she got a ten per cent employee discount on whatever she wanted--nylon stockings
Close on her legs as she rolls up a stocking and clips it to the garter
(
) make-up, and perfume
Close on an atomiser misting her bosom with Jungle Gardenia by Tuvache
(
) She wore a lot of perfume
Doris in a flouncy dress is setting coasters on a coffee table
(
) Doris's boss, Big Dave Brewster, was married to Ann Nirdlinger, the department store heiress
Tonight they were coming over for dinner--as Doris said, we were 'entertaining'
Ed sits on the living-room davenport in an uncomfortable suit, smoking
(
) Me,  don't like entertaining
The doorbell rings
Ed opens it to reveal a large man in a suit and his demure, bird-like wife
How ya doin', Ed
Take your coat, Ann
The two couples are in the middle of the meal
Japs had us pinned down in Buna for something like six weeks
Well, gotta tell ya,  thought *we* had it tough, but, Jesus, we had supply
*They* were eating grubs, nuts, thistles
When we finally up and bust off the beach we found Arnie Bragg, kid missing on recon; the Japs had *eaten* the sonofabitch, if you'll pardon the, uh
And this was a scrawny, pimply kid too, nothin' to write home about
mean,  never would've, ya know, so what do  say, honey
When  don't like dinner, what do  say
Ann smiles wanly
say, Jesus, honey, Arnie Bragg-- *again*
He roars with laughter
Ed gives an acknowledging smile
Arnie Bragg--*again*
He dries his eyes with the corner of a napkin
Were you in the service, Ed
No, Dave,  wasn't
Ed was 4F on account of his fallen arches
Mm, that's tough
Ed is standing alone on the porch, watching the sun go down
Crickets chirp
From inside the house we hear laughter and clattering dishes
(
) Yeah
guess Doris liked all that he-man stuff
Sometimes  had the feeling that she and Big Dave were a lot closer than they let on
He turns and looks through the screen door into the house
Across the dim living room we can see a sliver of the brightly lit kitchen
Big Dave, wearing a frilly apron, stands at the counter drying dishes
His broad back heaves with laughter while Doris, just hidden by the wall, chats away, handing dishes across
(
) The signs were all there plain enough--not that  was gonna prance about it, mind you
It's a free country
Footsteps approach the front porch
With the squeak of the screen door, Big Dave emerges
Holding down the porch area
Ed gives a half-grin of wry acknowledgement
Big Dave relaxes, forearms against the porch railing, gazing out at the front lawn
That's quite a wife you got there
Mm
She's a rare one
How's business, Dave
Couldn't be better
These're boom times in retailing
We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson
This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments
Matter of fact, 'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller
How're things at the, uh, the barbershop
All right,  guess
Fine
Fine
Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day
He chuckles
Say, where do you get those things anyway
Specialty store down in Sacramento
Uh-huh
There is a silence
At length, gazing out at the lawn, Big Dave clears his throat
(
) Doris and  went to church once a week
We are tilting down a long stained-glass window depicting the resurrection of Christ
(
) Usually Tuesday night
Faintly, we hear an amplified voice: seven
Ed sits at a long table, staring at the window, a lit cigarette in his mouth
Bee
Four
(
) Doris wasn't big on divine worship
Doris is concentrating on the six cards spread in front of her
(
) and  doubt if she believed in life everlasting; she'd most likely tell you that our reward is on this earth and bingo is probably the extent of it
Still focused on her cards, Doris mutters to Ed: Watch your card, honey
sixteen
Ed continues to gaze off at the window, smoke pluming from his cigarette
(
) wasn't crazy about the game, but, don't know, it made her happy, and found the setting peaceful
Gee
nine
Doris sucks in her breath
Jesus, bingo--
Sun slants in through the big window at the end of the day
Ed sweeps hair trimmings, looking intently down at the floor, a cigarette dangling from his lip
Frank sits on one of the vinyl waiting chairs, talking at Ed's back
so you tie your own flies, Ed mean, if you're really serious
You tie your own flies, you do a-- know it's matickless,  know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what 'm saying
Uh-huh
The point is there's a certain art to the process
The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think
Uh-huh
Sportsmanship
That's my point
June fly, Ed
Mosquito
Which of these
Well, what fish do you seek
Yeah
Sure, go to the store
Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn , Ed
We see a black-suited figure approaching through the windows at the far end of the shop
He is almost blown out by the late-day sunlight hitting the window
My point is, this is a man who knows nothing no matter how much you tell him, so sell him the goddamn , Ed
The bell over the front door tinkles, and the swarthy middle- aged man walks in
He is well dressed--perhaps a little too snazzily for this small town--and has a sporty pencil mustache
, boys, which of you gets the privilege
We're just closing, friend
Oh, happy days
wish  was doing well enough to turn away business
More power to ya, brother
The public be damned
Hey, what's your problem, friend
This is a business establishment with posted hours-- Ed cuts in with a jerk of the head
'll take care of him, go ahead, Frank
Have a seat, mister
Frank looks sourly at the stranger
You sure, Eddie
Yeah, yeah--go home
As Frank leaves: In your ear, mister
The stranger chuckles
Oh, those fiery Mediterraneans
Say
Not so fast there, brother-- Ed has switched on the clippers, but the stranger waves him back; he lifts off a toupee
Pretty good, huh
Fools even the experts
100 percent human hair, handcrafted by Jacques of San Francisco, and 'd hate to have to tell you what  paid for it
Uh-huh
Yes, it's a nice rug
'm paying for it down on the installment plan
Ed starts to trim the stranger's fringe
lot of folks live with the pate exposed
They say the dames think it's sexy
But for my money it's just not good grooming--and grooming, my friend, is probably the most important thing in business--after personality, of course
He twists around to offer his hand
Creighton Tolliver, pleased to know ya
Ed Crane
What brings you to Santa Rosa
goose, friend
was chasing a wild goose
Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital
Uh-- Well, it's the wildest goose there is
Risk money
Very speculative
Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see
thought  had a prospect here
Well,  make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own
Thank you, mother
Pop goes another bubble
It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and can't seem to interest a soul
That right
It's called dry cleaning
You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes
It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh
And here's the capper: no shrinkage
Huh
That's right
Dry cleaning--remember the name
It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away
All  need is $10,000 to open my first store, then  use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain
Well, me and a partner
Cleanliness, friend
There's money in it
There's a future
There's room to grow
Say, that's looking pretty good
Let's see it with the hairpiece on
It is evening
Ed leans against the bathroom doorjamb contemplatively off, hands thrust into his pockets, a cigarette between his lips pluming smoke
(
) Dry cleaning
The reverse show Doris soaking in the tub, reading a magazine
(
) Was  crazy to be thinking about it
Was he a huckster, or opportunity, the real McCoy
Ed takes the cigarette from his mouth, exhales
(
) My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts
But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob
What if  could get the money
Honey
Mm
She lifts one leg and rests the heel on the rim of the tub
Shave my legs, will ya
Ed saunters over, perches on the tub and puts the cigarette back in his mouth to free his hands
He picks up a bar of soap and starts soaping the leg
He sets down the soap and picks up a safety razor
The razor takes long slow strokes along the lather, dark bits of hair flecking the white foam
(
) It was clean
No water
Chemicals
He shakes the razor in the tub
Shavings float away across the soap-slicked water
(absently, as she reads) Gimme a drag
Ed pulls the cigarette from his mouth between two fingers, uses the two fingers to flip it over, and holds it for Doris as she sucks
He brings the cigarette, now marked with lipstick, back to his own mouth
She murmurs: Love ya, honey
We hear a voice, muffled through the door, breaking into laughter
hand enters to knock
Yeah, come in
The door swings open to show Creighton in his shirtsleeves sitting on the bed, talking on the phone
tray of room- service dishes sits near him
He is bald; his hairpiece sits on the pillow next to him
(into the phone) yeah
'll see you tomorrow
He hangs up, looks quizzically at Ed
Oh,  thought you were the porter
Can  help you
Ed stands awkwardly by the door
'm, uh, Ed
The stranger's look does not show recognition
Ed Crane
Remember
Today
Sorry, friend, , uh, you got me at a disadvantage
'm, uh, 'm--the barber
Jesus
The barber
'll be a sonofagun
Why didn't you say so
'Course--the barber
Ed nods, his smile faint and forced
didn't recognize you without the smock
Did --damn--did  leave something at the shop
No
might be interested in that, uh, business proposition-- Creighton, surprised, quickly picks up his hairpiece and arranges it on his head
You got the dough
can get it, yeah
Come in, come in, siddown over there
Coffee
No
--tell me-- Sure
What's involved, aside from putting up the money
What're you looking for the partner to do
Do
Hell, nothing
Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but 'm looking for a silent partner
've done the research, 've contacted the vendors, the deal is set
'm just looking for venture capital, friend
Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like-- want the dough;  don't take attendance
And how do we share-- Fifty-fifty, straight down the line
You and me
Finance and expertise
So--you've got the dough then, do ya
'll have it in a week
Well, 'll be damned
The barber
And  thought this trip was a bust
Well
He reaches for a bottle of bonded whiskey on the night stand and hands Ed a glass
it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens
Here's to ya, uh
Ed
They both knock back the whiskey
Creighton leans back and gives Ed a heavy-lidded stare, a faint smile on his lips, his hairpiece slightly askew
Ed stares back
After a beat, without taking his eyes of Ed, Creighton reaches up and loosens his tie
An almost imperceptible wink
Ed stares
Was that a pass
(hoarsely) Maybe
You're out of line, mister
Creighton throws up his hands apologetically
No problem
Way out of line
Right
Strictly business
Yeah
It says: $10,000
hand pulls the note out of a typewriter carriage
(
) sent it to Dave the next morning
And  waited
We are looking down at the top of an eight-year-old's crew cut as clippers buzz its perimeter
Frank reads a magazine
The youngster reads a comic as Ed works his head
Frank
Huh
This hair
Yeah
You ever wonder about it
Whuddya mean
don't know
How it keeps on coming
It just keeps growing
Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal
No,  mean it's growing, it's part of us
And we cut it off
And throw it away
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid
Ed shuts off the clippers and give the apron a flap
, bud, you're through
The kid hops down, still reading his comic, and ambles out the door
Ed gives Frank a considering stare
'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt
What the-- 'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt
What the hell are you talking about
Ed turns back to the counter to hang up his clippers
don't know
Skip it
' It is twilight
Ed lifts the latch on the front gate and, cigarette in his mouth, heads up the walk
Music filters out from the house
' Ed walks though the living room, hands in his pockets
The music emanates from a radio in the bedroom
Ed
track forward reveals Doris sitting at a vanity, doing her hair
Her dress is half zipped at the back
Gimme a zip
Ed walks over behind her
Where you going
Me
Us
The party at Nirdlinger's-- told you last week, for the Christmas Push
Yeah, right
We are close on the zipper as Ed's hand takes the tab, pauses, the lowers it slightly
Her back blooms through the dark fabric of the dress
He slides the zipper up, and Doris reaches for a perfume atomizer
Come on, get ready
It's important
Nah, go ahead
'm not big on parties
Oh, don't be a grump
It is festooned with streamers
Ed leans against a wall, one hand dug into a pocket, the other bringing a cigarette to his lips
Band music plays and Nirdlinger's employees whirl on the dance floor
Bobby-soxed teenagers Lindy-hop and pass palms over their knees
thin young man in a sports coat stands next to Ed, watching, his Adam's apple bobbing
Wild, man
He goes out onto the dance floor
Ed, left by himself, gazes across the floor
His view, broken by dancers' crosses, shows Big Dave worriedly talking to Doris
Doris reacts angrily
Big Dave morosely absorbs the angry words from Doris
He glances up toward Ed and notices his gaze with consternation
He gives Doris a jerk of the head, and she too looks over
You in ladies' wear
The young man with the Adam's apple is back, looking out at the floor, snapping his fingers
Huh
Haven't  seen you up in ladies' wear
don't work here
My wife does
Uh-huh
Some beat, huh
Yeah
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora
Uh-huh
hand is laid on Ed's shoulder
It is Big Dave; he leans in to murmur: Ed
Can  talk to you
' Music from the party drifts in only faintly
The office is built into a corner of the sales floor
It is dominated by a large desk
large window on the far side affords a partial view of the floor
Siddown
Siddown
Ed sits in a leather chair in front of the desk
Dave fumbles nervously on top of the desk for a cigar
He trims the end of the cigar with a short double-bladed knife with a steel grip
Souveniered it off a Jap in New Guinea
He hands one cigar to Ed, takes one for himself, then drags up a chair to face Ed's
guess you're wondering what Doris was so hot about
The office is dark, the only illumination coming from the window onto the bright sales floor behind Big Dave
Ed leans forward for Dave to light his cigar
These're Havanas
Romeo and Juliets
Private stock
Dave, having lit Ed's cigar, draws nervously on his own
Ed,
What is it, Dave
Dave breaks down, weeping
He buries his face in his hands, the burning cigar in his right hand perilously close to his hair
Ed, 've been weak
His shoulders heave
've, uh
've, uh
thanks
Ed has taken Dave's cigar so that he won't burn himself
've, uh
Oh, Jesus
've been carrying on with a married woman
Uh, no one you know
And now the, uh-- what is it they say
--the--the--the chickens are coming home to roost
Ed awkwardly holds the two burning cigars
Uh-huh
Hell, , 'm not proud of it
But, uh, that's not the worst of it got a note
blackmail note
You know, come across or everybody knows
Uh-huh
Well, you know what that would do to me
guess it would be pretty awkward
Awkward
Ann'd throw me out on my keister
Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store
serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed
Uh-huh
only work here
And the lady's husband would know
Oh, Jesus
How much to they want, Dave
$10,000
don't know what to do, Ed
don't know what  *can* do
Even though  know who the sonofabitch is
You know
who *who* is
The sonofabitch
The blackmailer
It's, uh, it's no one you know
It's a businessman from Sacramento goddamn pansy, Ed
He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme;  heard him out and then told him to go to hell
And the very next day, the very next day, Ed,  get blackmailed for the same amount
Would he
it sounds pretty obvious
Well,  guess he don't care that it's obvious
Mm
How, uh
how did he know that-- He's staying at the hotel 've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question
Must've seen us
Big Dave blows his nose, reaches to take his cigar from Ed
Thanks
He exhales with a long sigh
Oh, Jesus
Why don't you just pay him, Dave
That's my capitalization on the Annex
*My* operation, Ed
Christ almighty
That's what  was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann
Mm
Embezzling, Ed
From my own goddamn wife
He give a tearful chuckle
Doris, she was pretty hot about that
God bless her
She doesn't know 'm telling you this--she's mad enough already
But Jesus, Ed, you're the only one  can talk to
'm, 'm sorry
better get back to the party
He rises and clears his throat as he rubs the tears from his face
look all right
He has left the office to wander through an adjacent room lit only by spill from the party
It is the music department; pianos and spinets are arranged across the floor
(
) In a way  felt bad for Big Dave knew the ten grand was going to pinch him where it hurt
Ed sits on a piano stool next to a standing ashtray
He takes out a cigarette, lights it off his cigar, stubs out the cigar
(
) But Doris was two-timing me and guess, somewhere, that pinched a little too
His attention is caught by a distant knock of wood
Someone is raising the key-guard on a piano across the room
The person can only be seen only obscurely, from three- quarters behind, through the sales floor's jumble of haphazardly arranged instruments
The person begins to play
Ed listens
The piece is slow, sweet, almost a lullaby
The player, unaware that there is an audience, plays on, and Ed listens, eyes narrowed against the smoke curling past his face
The piece ends
That was pretty
The player turns, surprised
It is a young woman
Did you make that up
Oh, no
That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven
Ed nods recognition of the name
That was quite something
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas
That was something
'm Ed Crane
know who you are, Mr Crane
His look shows surprise
My father used to take me with him when he got his hair cut
Walter Abundas
Ed's head tilts back in acknowledgment
'm Rachel Abundas
Everyone calls me Birdy
Sorry,  just didn't remember
Oh, that's all right
You can't be expected to remember every skinny girl who comes in with her dad
Ed give a wry smile
You don't like the music out there
It's ,  guess
No,  don't really
'm not big on music, ordinarily
woman calls sharply from offscreen: Ed
He looks
Silhouetted in the doorway to the party room is Doris, coat over her arm, purse in hand
' Doris and Ed are driving home
Doris draws heavily on a cigarette, looking flintily out at the road
What a knucklehead
Who
Dave
How's that
Ahh
She waves angrily
Money problems
He's thinking about canceling the Annex
So
*That means  don't run Nirdlinger's
* Mm
They ride in silence for a beat
Doris shakes her head
What a knucklehead
As the car roars past and into the distance
It is day
We are looking from inside a parked car toward a hotel entrance
Big Dave emerges from the hotel, gets into a Packard and drives off
(
) Big Dave did it, though
Ed, sitting in his car, is watching
(
) sent a note telling him where to drop the money
Ed emerges from a stairwell and goes to a standing ashtray by the elevator
(
) and he did
He came across
Ed reaches into the trash hole in the ashtray column and pulls out a Nirdlinger's bag
He goes back to the stairwell
Ed emerges from the stairwell, goes to a door and knocks
The door swings open
Yeah, good, how are ya, come in
Ed follows him into the room
You bring a check
Cash
Cash
He gives Ed a look
Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft
But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh
Sure
got the paperwork here
Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, supply professional services, you supply the capital
'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh
Yeah
Pretty straightforward, but  don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer-- It's
Yeah, screw 'em, huh
Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point
He perspires as he counts the money
Just a second here, 'll give you a receipt on the, uh
Whoa, Nellie
Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, , uh,  think 'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know,  didn't think you were much interested in, uh-- That'll be fine
Yeah, good
Lemme just, uh
He wipes his brow, finishes counting
Yeah, that's it
As per our discussion
Uh-huh
Creighton hands Ed an executed agreement and a receipt
Well, there it is
Writ large in legal escriture, next step is-- Look, uh
Creighton
He gives Creighton a level stare, smoke pluming from the cigarette planted in his mouth
You're not gonna screw me on this
*Screw* you--Jesus
Take it to a lawyer
No,  insist
This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here
must say, 've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and 've never-- All right
And 've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back
You know who am
You-- Creighton mops his brow again
So, uh
Tolliver's is  then
Ed drives with the usual cigarette in his mouth
Doris sits next to him
Rural scenery slips by in the background
(
) The next day was Saturday
We were going to a reception for Doris' cousin Gina, who'd just married a wop vintner out near Modesto
Doris didn't much feel like going, and  didn't either, but, like she said, we had a Commitment
Doris gazes stonily out at the road
At length: hate wops
Ed gives her a brief glance
Doris glares at him
What's so damn strange about that
didn't say a word
She looks back out at the road
*You* didn't have to grow up with 'em
This brings nothing from Ed
Doris shakes her head
Family
Boy
Wops in Sunday clothing greet each other around tables piled with food
small child runs up to his mother, yanks on her dress and screams: He's ridin' Garibaldi
Uncle Frankie's ridin' Garibaldi
Surrounded by cheering children, with a jug of wine slung over his shoulder, Frank is riding an enormous pig
He slaps at the pig's ass with a large straw hat
(
) That was when she started drinking
Doris is standing by one of the tables, drinking red wine from a water glass
Ed stands nearby
large woman hugs Doris
How you doin', Doris, you been
How're you, Constanza
Oh, you know,  got my healt'
And how you been, uh
Ed
Ed
How's a business
(to Doris) He's a barber, right
It's a good trade
So how come you got no kids
group of kids pulls Frank, laughing, by the hand toward a picnic table set out with pies in a row
Uncle Frankie's gotta join
Wait for Frankie
No, come on, kids-- just ate lunch
No, no--Uncle Frankie's gotta join
An old man stands by with a stopwatch
Ready
He clicks the timer
Go
Frank and the line of children plunge their faces into the line of blueberry pies
The other picnickers cheer them on
Ed and Doris approach the innocent-looking young couple accepting congratulations
Doris, holding her empty glass, is not a happy drunk: 'Gratulations, Gina
It's so goddamn wonderful
Congratulations, Gina
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it
Honey
It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, 'm sure
Ed tries to lead her away
Honey
Doris calls back over her shoulder: Congratulations on your goddamn cherries
As Ed and Doris recede we hear her petulant: Leggo my goddamn elbow
In a long shot we see Frank at the crest of a hill, staggering slowly, painfully, toward a tree
In his right hand he clutches a trophy
When he reaches the tree he swings his free hand up against it, leans forward, and vomits
Late afternoon, driving home
Ed drives
Doris sits in the front passenger seat, snoring lightly
Frank sits in the back seat hugging his trophy to his chest, eyes closed, murmuring: never wanna see another blueberry pie
Silence
never even wanna hear those words
Doris moans
More silence
Don't says those words, Ed
It is twilight
Ed's coupe is parked in the driveway
He is just rounding the back of the car to open the passenger-side door
He pulls Doris from the car, half asleep, half drunk
The door swings open and Ed stumbles in supporting Doris, who has one arm draped around his neck
He helps her into the bedroom and eases her onto the bed
He sits on the edge of the bed and looks down at her
Shadows from branches just outside wave across her face
She is breathing through her open mouth; her face is moist with perspiration
(
) 'd met Doris blind on a double-date with a loudmouthed buddy of mine who was seeing a friend of hers from work
We went to a movie; Doris had a flask; we killed it
She could put it away
At the end of the night she said she liked it  didn't talk much
couple weeks later she suggested-- harsh jangle from the telephone
Doris moans but does not wake; Ed rises and does to the living room and picks up the phone
Yeah
Ed, it's Big Dave
gotta talk to you
What--now
Please, Ed
But it's
Please, Ed
Ed sighs
Your place
'm at Nirdlinger's
Let yourself in
He hangs up
He nudges Doris
Honey
She murmurs
Honey
She rolls away and burrows into a pillow
Ed opens her purse and pokes through it
' We are looking over Ed's shoulder as he hesitantly swings open a door
It reveals Big Dave's office, quiet and rather dark
down-facing banker's lamp on the desk illuminates Big Dave's hands on the desktop
Dave
Come on in
Ed enters, sits
An awkward silence
What's the problem, Big Dave
Another silence
'm ruined
His hands writhe on the desktop
It ruined me
This money
No annex
'm all shot to hell
So you paid the guy
Big Dave stares without speaking
After a long beat: What kind of man *are* you
Huh
What kind of man *are* you
Big Dave-- 'd understand if you'd walked in here
Socked me in the nose
Whatever
deserved it
, uh
'm not proud of what  did
But *you*
No one talks
Big Dave sighs
Yeah,  paid up
As you well know
And then  went and found the pansy
He looks at Ed
Got nothin' to say, huh
Yeah, well, you already know the story didn't,  hadda beat it out of the pansy
*Your* money
No response
What kind of man *are* you
Big Dave rises
Well
He crosses around the desk and adds, sadly: 'm all shot to hell
Ed starts to rise, but Big Dave is already looming over him
Big Dave bear-hugs him and then spins him into a wall
Ed hits the wall and bounces off, back into Big Dave
Big Dave wallops him in the stomach
Ed doubles over
What kind of man *are* you
Big Dave hurls him against the desk, then slams his face against the desktop
Ed's hands scrabble at the top of the desk as Big Dave grabs him by the neck and lifts
He slams him face-first into the window between the office and the dark sales floor
Ed twists around, the back of his head now pressed against the glass
Big Dave's hands lock around his throat
Big Dave sweats and strains
crack shoots up the pane of glass
Ed's hand sweeps up and plunges something into Big Dave's neck
Big Dave grunts and turns away, gurgling
His hands go up to his throat
Ed watches
He is holding Big Dave's cigar trimmer
Big Dave takes a couple of deliberate steps backward, his head twisted away
He falls back, tripped up by a chair, which spins him face- down onto the floor
Big Dave crawls away face-down across the floor, on his knees but with his hands still at his throat
His face and knees awkwardly support his weight as if he were pushing something across the floor with his nose
He reaches a corner but still pushes forward, wedging himself in, legs still scraping away as if to push himself through the wall
Blood is pooling out from under him
Big Dave's legs are still working
His gurgling continues
Ed watches
Big Dave's legs start to move furiously
They convulse
His whole body shakes as he goes into shock
Ed watches
Big Dave stops shaking
He remains wedged awkwardly into the corner, face-down
He is still
The room is very quiet
Ed looks down at his hands
He walks across the room, pushes the door open and walks across the darkened sales floor
Ed walks to his car
He does not look about, is not particularly furtive
He gets into the car
He starts the ignition
He pulls up, sits motionless for a beat
Gradually, something draws his attention; he cocks his head and looks up through the windshield
branch creaks and sways in the breeze
Ed gets into bed next to Doris
He stares at the ceiling
Wind rustles outside
The shadow of a branch on the ceiling nods in time with the wind
He looks at Doris
Her face is still lightly sheened with sweat but her mouth is closed now, her breathing more peaceful
The leafy shadows play over her face
(
) It was only a couple of weeks after we met that Doris suggested getting married
said, Don't you wanna get to know me more
She said, Why, does it get better
She looked at me like  was a dope, which 've never really minded from her
And she had a point,  guess
We knew each other as well then as now
He is gazing at her
(
) Anyway, well enough
Sound and image face
The next day
Ed cuts hair, a cigarette between his lips
Holy-moly, do  got a headache
Frank is giving a haircut as well
How you today, Ed
You don't got a headache
Nah
Damn,  got a headache to beat the band
Ed sits in his chair, hands folded in his lap, head tilted back, eyes closed
We hold on Ed as we hear a clipper buzzing and Frank talking to someone in his chair
Ya can't pump it
Did ya pump it
That'll just flood it
Ya gotta pump it
Ya can't just hold it down
*That'll* flood it
You crazy
You pumped it
Well, ya can't hold it down
There is the jingle of the door bell
Ed opens his eyes
Two men in fedoras are entering
Ed starts to rise
1 Ed Crane
Right
1 Come on outside
Sure
The two men are staring at the sidewalk, smoking, hesitant to speak
One of them finally comes up with an icebreaker: 2 So you're a barber, huh
That's right
1 'm Officer Persky
This is Krebs
Ed nods toward their car: We goin'
Huh
No
Beat
Cigarette
Ed holds up one hand with its smoking cigarette
Right
Uh
Pete's got some news for you
His partner gives Persky a dirty look
Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh
well damnit, your wife's been pinched
They sent us to tell ya
Huh
They sent us to tell ya
We pulled the detail
My *wife*
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh
Homicide
Well, embezzlement
And homicide guy named David Brewster
He's, uh
He's the decedent
don't understand
He's the dead guy
Ed stares at him
Yeah, it's a tough break
Visiting ends at five
Too late today
You can see her tomorrow
Sorry, pal
They sent us to tell ya
He shakes his head
Crap detail
It is evening
Ed is pulling up to a house on a tree-lined street similar to his own
He gets out of his car and goes up the walk, and a man sitting on the porch swing holds up a hand of greeting
'Lo, Ed
Hello, Walter
He steps up on the porch
The man is holding a tumbler of whiskey and ice that clinks as the swing moves
His skin glistens with drinker's sweat, and he has the slightly expansive manner of someone who's put at least a couple away
Have a seat
Ed glances around but the swing is the only seat
He sits next to Walter
Thanks
Thanks for seeing me, at home
Oh, hell
Drink
No thanks
Sure you don't need one
'm fine
Boy
Jesus
Yeah
What do , uh
Well, of course, , uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff
do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh
'd be absolutely worthless, something like this
Absolutely worthless
He belches
'Scuse me, just finished dinner
Um
Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender
He a good man
Bert's , sure, he's a good man won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er
And  hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento
Capital offense
Taking it seriously
Hmm
So-- Taking it seriously
So, who should -- The front door opens and someone speaks through the screen: You want any coffee, Dad
Ed looks around at the voice
Oh, hello, Mr Crane
She steps out: it is Birdy Abundas
Ed rises, and they awkwardly shake hands
Hello, Rachel
'm so sorry
was sorry to hear
Yeah
Thanks
Coffee, Ed
'm fine
Thanks
No thanks, honey
Nice to see you, Mr Crane
They watch her go back in
Damnit
She's a good kid
Ed nods
beat
So, uh, who should -- Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco
Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway
Conservative
Jury might like that
Might like that here
He takes a sip of his drink
Probity
Uh-huh
Is he the best then, for, uh
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider
Out of Sacramento
'Course,  don't know how you're fixed for money
Uh-huh
He's the, uh
Yeah, the best
He sniffs
Yeah, Riedenschneider
Wish could tell you more
Hell,  wish could handle it myself
But 'd be absolutely worthless for this kind of thing
He takes a musing sip
Criminal matter
Freddy Riedenschneider
He thinks
No question about it
It is a long table with chairs stretching down both sides, one side for prisoners, the other for visitors
The room is empty except for a guard and an elderly woman who sits across from a younger woman at the far end of the table
The younger woman, in a prison smock, is wailing
The elderly woman is holding her hand
Ed sits across from an empty chair, clutching a flower-printed toiletries kit
There are echoing voices suggesting large spaces outside the room
He sits and waits
Approaching footsteps
The door opens
large prison matron steps aside to let Doris enter
Doris looks lost in a prison-issue jumper that is too big for her
Her hair is uncurled and bedraggled
Not only is she not made-up, she has a couple of bruises and a cut on her lip
As Ed stands, she gives a hollow look around
Honey
brought your make-up
She looks at him
Honey
How are you
She shrugs
don't know what's going on
-- What happened to you
She shakes her head
don't know what happened to Big Dave
know some of it
Irregularities in my books, they said
Can  explain it
You don't have to-- helped him cook the books, Ed did do that
You don't have to tell them anything
We're getting you a lawyer
Doris doesn't seem to be listening
She sighs: know all about that
But  don't know how much to tell them
Don't tell 'em anything
We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider
Doris finally looks at him
Should
should  tell you why
You don't have to tell me anything
Her gaze drifts away again
She notices the sobbing woman
Jesus Christ
Doris looks around and laughs
My books used to be perfect
Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store
Honey
knew we'd pay for it
Ed sits in a waiting-customer chair, wearing his smock
Frank paces in front of him
He smacks a fist into his palm
This is what family is for, Ed
This is when ya come together
Yeah
Close ranks
Goddamnit
Those sons of bitches
Frank, uh, you know 'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider-- don't care what it costs
This is when ya come together
That's very generous
The hell with it, Eddie
Ed and Frank sit waiting on a bench in the high-vaulted lobby
Frank looks uncomfortable in an ill-fitting suit
As they wait, he looks nervously about
In a hushed voice: They're just people like you and me, Ed
Remember that
Uh-huh
Just people
They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money
This is why the big lobby, Ed
But they put their pants on one leg at a time
Just like you and me
Uh-huh
They too use the toilet, Ed
In spite of appearances
And their money will be secured by the barbershop
rock
*rock*, the barbershop
mean, how long has *this* place been here
door opens
conservatively dressed man of late middle age emerges
Mr Raffo
Frank hops to his feet
Yes, sir
Could you come with me please
Sure
Can Ed come too
The man looks dubiously at Ed
Mr
Crane
Ed Crane
You also have an interest in the securing property
He's a barber
Ah
Second chair
Not an owner
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law
Ah-hah
It would be best if he waited here
He goes to the glass-paned doorway to his office, Frank trailing dejectedly behind
They enter, the door closes, and we hear their muffled voices from inside, the sense of the words lost
Ed sits and watches the two men perform their pantomime of business: Frank nervously reads documents with one hand cupped to his forehead for concentration; the banker passes successive documents across his desk with a word of explanation for each as Frank signs
Ed takes out a cigarette and lights it, watching impassively
(
) The barbershop
Doris and Frank's father had worked thirty years to own it free and clear
Now it got signed over to the bank, and the bank signed some money over to Frank, and Frank signed the money over
It is midday
We are tracking along the sidewalk toward a long cream-colored Packard parked at the curb
couple of kids have stopped to peer into the car's windows; the car is no doubt the fanciest in town
(
) to Freddy Riedenschneider, who got into town two days later
Ed, coming up the sidewalk, looks up at the storefront: a restaurant with a large window with a plush red drape that obscures the interior
Gilt lettering on the window spells out "DaVinci's"
(
) and told me to meet him at DaVinci's for lunch
Inside the restaurant
We are tracking toward a table whose lone occupant sits with his back to us holding open a menu as he orders from a facing waitress: not fried, poached
Three of 'em for two minutes
strip steak medium rare, flapjacks, potatoes, tomato juice, and plenty of hot coffee
He flips the menu over
Do you have prairie oysters
No, sir
Then bring me a fruit cocktail while wait
He looks up at Ed
You're Ed Crane
Yeah-- Barber, right
'm Freddy Riedenschneider
Hungry
They tell me the chow's  here
made some inquiries
No thanks, -- The waitress sets a fruit cocktail in front of Riedenschneider
Look,  don't wanna waste your time so 'll eat while we talk
Ya mind
*You* don't mind
So while 'm in town 'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite
Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's  though,  poked around
'm having 'em hold it for me on account of 'll be back and forth
In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way
We'll talk about appeals if, as and when
For right now, has she confessed
No
Of course not
She didn't do it
Good
That helps
Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess
Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good
--one less thing to think about
Now
Interview
'm seeing her tomorrow
You should be there
Three o'clock
One more thing: you keep your mouth shut
get the lay of the land, tell *you* what to say
No talking out of school
What's out of school
Everything's out of school
do the talking; you keep your trap shut
'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything
Understood
Good
Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if 'm out leave a message
You sure you don't want anything
No
He points a finger at Ed
You're , pal
You're , she's Everything's gonna be hunky-dory
The waitress puts down a plate of steak and eggs
And the flapjacks, honey
We are looking at pedestrians on the sidewalk through the windshield of a moving car
(
) All going about their business
It seemed like  knew a secret--a bigger one even then what had really happened to Big Dave, something none of them knew
On Ed, driving
(
) Like  had made it to the outside, somehow, and they were all still struggling, way down below
Arms folded behind his head, staring at the ceiling
On the ceiling is the moving shadow of a tree limb
distant, muffled knock
Ed turns his head
Ed opens it as he finishes cinching a bathrobe
The woman waiting on the front porch is dressed in black: a black dress and a black veiled hat that is too big for her bird-like frame
Wind rustles in the trees behind her
She stares at Ed
Ann
For the first time, we hear her speak, in a low, tremulous voice: Hello, Ed
Ann
Will you come in
She shakes her head
No, No, it's very late
Ed nods
After an uncomfortable beat, through which she continues to stare: 'm so sorry about your loss
Yes
Thank you
Of course, you know, Doris had nothing to do with it
Nothing at all
She lays a black-gloved hand on his arm
Oh,  know
Don't worry, Ed
came to tell you
Yes, Ann
And you should tell Doris
She falls silent
The trees behind her rustle
She gives a wary look back
Then, confidingly, to Ed: You know how Big Dave loved camping
And the out-of-doors
Ed is puzzled: Yes
We went camping last summer
In Eugene, Oregon
*Outside* of Eugene, Ed
She gives him a searching look, hoping, it seems, that he will find this significant
Yes
At night, there were lights--we both saw them
We never told anyone, outside of our official report
Ann-- spacecraft
saw the creatures
They led Big Dave onto the craft
He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report
Of course he told *me*
No one else
Ann-- The government knows
cannot repeat it to you
But this thing goes deep, Ed
This was not your wife
goes deep, and involves the government
There is a great deal of fear
You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat
They try to limit it, and-- Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed
After this happened, things changed
Big Dave
he never touched me again
Ed says nothing
She touches his arm
Tell Doris not to worry
know it wasn't her
Perhaps this will bring it out, finally
Perhaps now it will all come out
She turns and heads down the walk
Her high-heeled footsteps echo on the walk, then the sidewalk, then are lost in the rustle of leaves
Ed watches her go: a small black figure, growing smaller
It is an unadorned room with a simple wooden table and chairs
One high window lets in a shaft of sunlight
Ed and Doris sit at the table; Freddy Riedenschneider stands to one side staring up at the high window, hands dug into his pockets
All three are motionless for a long beat
Finally: It stinks
But it's true
don't care it's true, it's not true; it stinks
You say he was being blackmailed; by who
You don't know
For having an affair; with who
You don't know
Did anyone else know about it
Probably not; you don't know
knew about it
Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money
Terrific
Your husband backs you up
That's terrific
He starts pacing
You've gotta give me something to work with
Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician
He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize
Look
Look at what the other side is gonna run at us
They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive
They got a murder scene *you* had access to
That's Opportunity
They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon-- It was Big Dave's
--don't interrupt me--that's Means
They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone
** was with her
Riedenschneider gives him a hard look
Like  say, it stinks
Another long pause
killed him
Riedenschneider eyes him
Wheels start turning
, we forget the blackmail
*You* killed him
How come
He and Doris
were having an affair
Doris eyes him
His manner does not reveal anything
, how did you know
just knew
husband knows
Riedenschneider rolls his eyes
Will anyone else say they knew
don't know
don't think so
How did you get into the store
took Doris's keys
Will anyone say they saw you there
On your way there
In there
On your was back
don't think so
Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all
Ed returns Riedenschneider's stare
Riedenschneider resumes pacing
Come on, people
You can't help each other like that
Let's be realistic now
Let's look at our options
Well, frankly,  don't *see* any options
nod of the head indicates Doris: cannot present Story
Another nod indicates Ed: cannot present Story
could plead you for a nutcase but you look too composed
could offer a guilty plea and in return they don't give you the juice, but  don't think you want to spend the rest of your life in Chino and  know you didn't hire Freddy Riedenschneider to hold your hand at a sentencing hearing
Hell, you could've gotten Lloyd Garroway for that
No, we're not giving up yet; you hired Freddy Riedenschneider, it means you're *not* throwing in the towel
litigate,  don't capitulate
All right, no options, we gotta think
All right, we go back to the blackmail thing
It titillates, it's open ended
His pacing becomes more animated
And it makes *him* the bad guy-- ya dig around, ya never know, something unsavory from his past, he approaches you to help with the money, it's too late, his past comes back to haunt him, who's to say
He is heading for the door
Yeah
Forget the jealous husband thing, that's silly; we're going with the blackmail
'll be in touch
The door slams
The camera drifts in toward the reception desk
Ed talks to the clerk behind the desk, but the scene plays silently; we hear only Ed's narration
(
) Of course, there was *one* person who could confirm Doris's story, or plenty of it: the dry-cleaning pansy
The desk clerk is shaking his head
(
) But he'd left the hotel, skipped out on his bill
It is a rooming-house hallway
stern middle-aged woman is on the hall telephone
This too plays silently under the narration
(
) He'd also disappeared from the residence he gave me
' We are drifting in toward Ed, who nods at the telephone and then cradles it
He stares down at the business card he holds
(
) owing two month's rent
How could have been so stupid
Handing over $10,000
For a piece of paper
And the man gone
like a ghost
In a different living room
He sits on a sofa, hands clasped behind his head, listening
For the first time, as the voice- over continues, we hear atmosphere from the scene: piano music
(
) disappeared into thin air, vaporized, like the Nips at Nagasaki
Gone now
All gone
The money gone
Big Dave gone
Doris going
How could have been so stupid
The continuing pull-back reveals Walter Abundas on a nearby chair, also listening as Birdy plays
Walter holds a drink in one hand; he is nodding; his eyelids droop
As the piano piece reaches its mournful conclusion his chin alights on his chest, his eyelids tremble closed, and he starts lightly to snore
The distinctive buzz of electric hairclippers bangs in at the cut
Ed and Frank stand behind their respective chairs, administering haircuts
The customer in Ed's chair is in white shirtsleeves that do not hide rolls of fat
He has a hot towel over his face that does not slow his speech, although it does muffle it to some extent: She makes this stuff, she calls it gatto, it's got egg in there, it's got sugar, it's got--it's cake, basically, except she calls it gatto
Like if you don't call it cake maybe you won't put on any weight, like need to eat gatto, you know what 'm saying
This stuff, if 've had a square meal, 've had my steak and potatoes,  can just have another cup of coffee afterward,  won't ask for the desert if it's not there
His voice turns into a drone under the narration
(
) Sooner or later everyone needs a haircut
Got the recipe from a magazine, woman's magazine
(
) We were working for the bank now
We kept cutting the hair, trying to stay afloat, make the payments, tread water, day by day, day by day
Inside a courtroom we boom down toward the defendant's table, the fat customer's drone turning into the drone of the bailiff reading an indictment
Doris stands next to Freddy Riedenschneider
(
) Most people think someone's accused of a crime, they haul 'em in and bring 'em to trial, but it's not like that, it's not that fast
The wheels of justice turn slow
did willfully and with malice aforethought take the life of one David Allen Brewster, a human being
(
) They have an arraignment, and then the indictment, and they entertain motions to dismiss, and postpone, and change the venue, and alter this and that and the other
They empanel a jury, which brings more motions, and they set a trial date and then change the date, and then often as not they'll change it again
What say you to these charges
Our boom down has ended close on Doris
We hear Freddy Riedenschneider, off: We plead not guilty, your honor
Booming down toward the fat man
(
) And through all of it we cut the hair
say, Honey, if you're gonna make a cobbler, make a little bit of cobbler, don't put a whole pan in front of me and tell me it's not gonna be any good when it's cold
We are panning photographic portraits of opera singers in character, wearing the wardrobe of different eras, armies, dukedoms, and boudoirs, and displaying the heights and depths of various emotions, their mouths stretched wide in song
We pan off the pictures to discover that we are in a hotel room, floating in toward a bed on which Freddy Riedenschneider, a mask over his eyes, slumbers
(
) Meanwhile, Freddy Riedenschneider slept at the Metropole
Tracking in toward Freddy Riedenschneider, who sits twirling spaghetti with a fork against a spoon
(
) and shoveled it in at DaVinci's
From inside a car
Pedestrians bustle along a sidewalk
Among them scurries a weedy little man who has one hand clamped to the crown of his hat to keep it in place in a stiff wind
(
) He'd brought in a private investigator from Sacramento
Moving the opposite way
different day, but again a crowd moves along the sidewalk, and among them the little man scuttles in the opposite direction, hand still raised to his hat, his forearm and the tilt of his head largely obscuring his face
(
) to nose around into Big Dave's past
In the Abundas living room again, again listening to Birdy at the piano, but now the two of them are alone
(
) found myself more and more going over to the Abundas's
It was a routine we fell into, most every evening
even went when Walter was away on his research trips
He was a genealogist, had traced back his side of the family seven generations, his late wife's, eight
It seemed like a screwy hobby
But then maybe all hobbies are
Maybe Walter found something there, in the old county courthouses, hospital file rooms, city archives, property rolls, registries, something maybe like what  found listening to Birdy play
Some kind of escape
Some kind of peace
The piano music ends in a sustain which begins to fade, but then is snapped by a sharp clang
We are pushing into the high-windowed prison meeting room
None of its three occupants is moving
The tableau consists of Doris staring down at the table; the private investigator sitting on a straightbacked chair tipped back against a wall, his arms folded across his chest, his fedora pushed back on his head, a toothpick clamped between his teeth; and Freddy Riedenschneider, standing, hands clasped behind his back, gazing with a distant smile up into the shaft of light that slants through the high window
warder shuts the door behind Ed
Doris and the private investigator turn to note his entrance; Riedenschneider does not
Ed pulls out a chair across from Doris, clasps his hands on top of hers
'Lo, honey
She looks at his hands on top of hers
long beat
Still gazing up into the shaft of light, Freddy Riedenschneider announces: They got this guy, in Germany
Fritz something-or-other
Or is it
Maybe it's Werner
Anyway, he's got this theory, you wanna test something, you know, scientifically--how the planets  go round the sun, what sunspots are made of, why the water comes out of the tap--well, you gotta look at it
But sometimes, you look at it, your looking *changes* it
Ya can't know the reality of what happened, or what *would've* happened if you hadden a stuck in your goddamn schnozz
So there *is* no 'what happened
' Not in any sense that we can grasp with our puny minds
Because our minds
out minds get in the way
Looking at something changes it
They call it the 'Uncertainty Principle
' Sure, it sounds screwy, but even Einstein says the guy's on to something
His gaze up at the window breaks
He strolls around the room, still smiling
Science
Perception
Reality
Doubt
He stops to examine a bur on his fingernail
Reasonable doubt
'm sayin', sometimes, the more you look, the less you really know
It's a fact proved fact
In a way, it's the only fact there is
This heinie even wrote it out in numbers
He looks up at the private detective
Burns
With a slight weight shift, Burns tips his chair so that its front legs slap down onto the floor
He fishes a small notebook from an inside pocket
His boredom is profound; his only concession to performance is to move the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the other where, perhaps, it will less inhibit speech
Subject: David Allen Brewster

Go to his service record
Burns looks at him sourly
He flips a couple of pages
Inducted March 15, 1942, assigned to fifth fleet  Navy, petty officer first class, serves in clerical capacity in  naval shipyards in San Diego, one fistfight broken up by MPs, no court martial, honorable discharge May 8, 1945

Riedenschneider nods, smiling
Thank you, Burns, get lost
Burns pockets his notebook, adjusts his hat, jams his hands into his pockets, and ambles out of the room
The slam of the door leaves quiet
At length: So
Riedenschneider's fixed smile now fades
So
*So
* This could be your dolly's ticket out of the deathhouse, so
Ed and Doris look at each other
don't get it
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right
Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth
Yeah
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego
You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury
Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it
Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says
They called, they demanded money
He is looking at Doris
Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service don't know,  wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*
Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; 'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam
Fat-assed sonofabitch
So
who
who actually-- Who
*Who
*  don't know who
But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who
But we can't *know* what really happened
Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is
And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife
Because it's easier *not* to look
Because the more you look, the less you know
But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know
We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know
Reasonable doubt
Science
The atom
*You* explain it to me
Go ahead
Try
He chuckles as he heads for the door
Yeah, Freddy Riedenschneider sees daylight
We got a real shot at this, folks
Let's not get cocky
The door shuts behind him
Doris stares down at the table, as at the head of the scene
silent beat; a smile starts to tug at the corners of her mouth
Honey
The smile twitches, and then stays
Doris starts to laugh
Ed frowns
Honey
Her laughter builds, almost to hysteria
Finally it subsides and, still staring at the tabletop and smiling, she shakes her head: What a dope
Ed sits listening as Birdy plays
She talks, after a moment, her eyes on the sheet music: He was deaf when he wrote this
Who
Beethoven
He created it, and yet he never actually heard it
suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow
Over her continued playing: (
) So maybe Riedenschneider could get Doris off
Maybe it would all work out
And  thought-- hoped--that maybe there was a way out for me as well
The cardboard sign on an easel says " ,   / /   29, 1949, 8:00
(
) The girl had talent, anyone could see that
And *she* wasn't some fly- by-nighter, she was just a good clean kid
young man holding a saxophone is just leaving the makeshift stage to a smattering of applause
Birdy walks out to the baby grand that has been set out center stage
(
) If she was going to have a career she'd need a responsible adult looking out for her
We track up the rows of folding chairs that have been set out on the gym floor for the audience of students and parents, many of whom fan themselves with programs
We come to rest on Ed
(
) some kind of
manager
She'd have contracts to look at, be going on tours, playing on the radio maybe
could help her sort through all of that, without charging her an arm and a leg, just enough to get by
Birdy begins to play for the quietly attentive audience
Ed is among the crowd streaming from the gym into the warm summer night
He looks around the parking lot
(
) could afford to charge less than the usual manager, not having to put up a big front like a lot of these phonies
And  could be with her, enough to keep myself feeling trace of a frown as he spots her leaning against a car, laughing, passing a cigarette back and forth with another student--a boy
(
) Why couldn't that work
Why not
Birdy's easy smile remains as Ed approaches, but the boy's drops; he puts on a face more suitable for meeting adults
Hi, Mr Crane
Hello, Birdy
thought that was very good
Oh, in there
messed up a little bit in the scherzo
guess, if nobody noticed, it's
Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine
Tony, Mr Crane
Hello, Tony
Hello, sir
Silence
The teens wait for the adult to direct the conversation; Ed has nothing to say
At length, he clears his throat
Well, congratulations
guess 'll be getting home
Nice to meet you, sir
It is morning
We are tracking past an unmade bed toward the bathroom, where we hear water running
(
) Anyway, that's what  was thinking about in the days leading up to the trial
It seemed like once that was over, 'd be ready for a new start
Freddy Riedenschneider was very optimistic
He was busy preparing
We have rounded the open bathroom door to find Riedenschneider hunched over the sink, toothbrush in hand, spitting out water
He rises, looks at himself in the mirror, sprinkles some tonic in his hair
(
) And finally it came
the first day of the trial
Riedenschneider runs his fingers through his hair
(
) What Riedenschneider called the Big Show
He straightens his tie, gives his neck a twist
We are close on the back of Riedenschneider's gleaming hair
He is sitting at the defense table
There is a murmur of a crowd that has yet to be called to order
Where's the judge
How come there's no judge
Ed and Frank sit next to each other in the first gallery row directly behind Riedenschneider
Where's the judge, Ed
Ed shrugs
Frank looks at Riedenschneider's back
How come the judge doesn't come out
The judge comes in last
He'll come in when Doris gets here
So where's Doris
thought we started at ten
Hey, Riedenschneider, where's Doris
Riedenschneider is curt: She's late
Late
How can she be late
Riedenschneider doesn't answer; Frank turns to Ed
She's in prison, Ed
None of *us* are in prison, and yet we're not late
We're on time, Ed
How can Doris be late
What, they don't have wake-up calls
The murmur of the crowd subsides as a door behind the judge's bench opens and the judge hurriedly enters
The gallery rises but the judge quickly waves them back down and, rather than seating himself, leans forward over his desk to give a peremptory beckoning wave to Riedenschneider and the prosecutor
Counselors
Riedenschneider, puzzled, approaches the bench, as does his counterpart from the other table
The judge, still leaning forward, speaks to them in a low voice that is not audible from the gallery
The crowd has started murmuring again, also in hushed tones
Frank leans in toward Ed
What's going on, Ed
thought there would be arguments
The bailiff, and so forth
Ed, also puzzled, is watching Riedenschneider, who suddenly stiffens
As the judge continues to talk, Riedenschneider looks back over his shoulder at Ed
Ed, what is this
Is this procedure
The two lawyers nod at the judge and walk back to their respective tables
The judge now summons a uniformed man standing to one side
Bailiff
As the judge and the bailiff confer, Riedenschneider looks down at his desk and, for something to do, straightens various papers
don't understand
We had a real shot at it
We could have won this thing
The Bailiff Announces: In the matter of the State of California versus Doris Crane, Case Number 87249 assigned to this Superior Court
As the bailiff drones, Riedenschneider shakes his head
It doesn't make any sense
Late afternoon sun slants in
The shop, not open for business, is very still
Ed, in his courtroom suit, sits in one of the vinyl chairs that line the wall, hunched forward, forearms on his knees
Frank, also still in his suit, is up in one of the barber chairs, one hand cupped to his forehead, weeping
(
) She'd hanged herself
'd brought her a dress to wear to court and she'd used the belt
didn't understand it either
At first thought maybe it had something to do with me, that she'd figured out somehow how  fit into it and couldn't stand it, couldn't stand knowing
Night
Ed is in bed, staring at the ceiling
(
) That wasn't it,  would find out later
For now, everything just seemed ruined
Riedenschneider is at the cashier's desk, checking out
Behind him a bellman's cart is piled high with his bags
(
) Freddy Riedenschneider went back to Sacramento still shaking his head, saying it was the biggest disappointment of his professional career
' Day
Frank's kitchen
Frank sits at his kitchen table, staring, in a bathrobe thrown over his pyjamas, unshaven
(
) Frankie fell to pieces
suspect he was drinking; anyway, he stopped coming to work
Ed, in his smock, works on a customer
(
) That left me to keep the place going, or the bank would've taken it
As he uses the electric clippers, a cigarette plumes between his lips
He squints against the smoke drifting past his eyes
(
) ** was the principal barber now
hired a new man for the second chair
Ed's former chair is indeed being manned by a newcomer, a gangly young man who animatedly chats up his customer
(
) 'd hired the guy who did the least gabbing when he came in for an interview
But  guess the new man had only kept quiet because he was nervous; once he had the job, he talked from the minute  opened the shop in the morning
It is evening
Ed is locking the barbershop as, next to him on the sidewalk, the new man continues to chat, gesticulating to illustrate his store
(
) until  locked up at night
For all  know, he talked to himself on the way home
Ed walks along the sidewalk
(
) When ** walked home, it seemed like everyone avoided looking at me
Indeed, none of the passers-by establish eye contact; their averted eyes make the crowd a faceless throng
(
) as if 'd caught some disease
This thing with Doris, nobody wanted to talk about it; it was like  was a ghost walking down the street
As Ed lets himself in
(
) And when  got home now, the place felt empty
He sits on the couch and, after a beat, takes a cigarette pack from his pocket and taps out a smoke
(
) sat in the house, but there was nobody there
was a ghost;  didn't see anyone; no one saw me
Ed is in his smock again, operating the clippers
(
) was the barber
The drone of the clippers has continued over the black voice fades up: 1 So two blocks later  look at the change she gave me and, golly, 'm two bits short
2 Two bits short
1 So  walk back over to Linton's, find this gal--big argument; she doesn't even recall the transaction
2 No recollection
1 Doesn't recall the transaction, no recollection, so  said, Look, dear
We are looking at a magazine story
Its headline, over an illustration of a cresting wave, is:
Underneath are black-and-white photographs of heavy equipment and racks of clothing on motorized tracks
Subheadlines read: - Dry Cleaning Sweeps The Nation - The Thoroughly Modern Way To Clean
Ed sits in one of the vinyl chairs, staring at Life magazine
The offscreen conversation drones on as the new man works on a customer
go ahead, look at the menu, if you're in before six o'clock it's the, whatchamacallit, the-- Early Bird Special
What
Yeah, the Early Riser
Ed flips the pages of the magazine, and stops on a photograph of a dark desert landscape with one bright light hovering in the sky
The caption underneath: ,
Crane
Ed looks up
man in a black suit and fedora has directed the question at the new man, who looks up from his gabbling, momentarily slackjawed
'm Crane
My name is Diedrickson
County medical examiner
Yeah
Just came for an informal chat
Diedrickson looks around uncomfortably
Why don't  buy you a drink
Ed rises from his chair and, as he unbuttons his smock, addresses the new man, who still gapes
Dwight, you  here for a few minutes
Whuh--uh, yeah, sure Ed, take your time
It is late afternoon, dusty and empty
Ed and Diedrickson sit on adjacent stools, Diedrickson cocking his hat lower to its man-sitting-at-a-bar position
As the bartender approaches: Rye
Just coffee
You sure you don't want something stiffer
Ed shrugs and shakes his head
Coffee it is
He leaves
Diedrickson interlaces his fingers on the bartop and stares at them
After a beat: County
does an autopsy on anyone who dies in custody
don't know if you knew that
It's routine
Ed doesn't answer
Diedrickson, after some more staring at his hands, plows on: Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play
However
don't believe 'm *prohibited* from telling you this
guess 'm not obliged to tell you, either
don't exactly know
But if ** were the man, 'd want to be told
Told what
, uh
thanks
The bartender has set down the drinks
Diedrickson waits for him to leave
He takes a hit from his glass
Finally: 'm sorry to add to your burden, Crane, but 'd want to know it it was me
Your wife was pregnant
First trimester
pause
Well, there it is
Another pause
'm sorry
He mutters to himself: Hell,  hope 've done the right thing
My wife and  had not
performed the sex act in many years
Diedrickson stiffens
(murmuring) Jesus
(aloud) Well, that's not really my business
He is hastily digging for money
'm sorry
Well, there it is
He leaves a couple of bills on the bar and mumbles as he leaves: Good luck, Crane
His retreating footsteps echo down the bar
It is a dingy hallway lit by bare bulbs
Ed stands in the middle background, knocking on a door
(
) Doris and  had never really talked much
don't think that's a bad thing, necessarily
But it was funny: now  wanted to talk--now, with everyone gone
was alone, with secrets  didn't want and no one to tell them to anyway
The door opens and Ed is admitted by the unseen tenant
We hear a low murmuring as we slowly pan the apartment
It is overfurnished with heavy, ornate chairs, sideboards, chests too big for the space and all going too seed
Surface areas are covered with yellowing lacework or exotic brocades; the one lamp has a veil thrown over it to further scrim down its feeble light
Our pan brings us onto Ed seated at a small card table across from a small elderly woman in a shawl who is the source of the murmuring
Her eyes are squeezed shut in concentration as she mumbles
(
) visited a woman who was supposed to have powers in communicating with those who had passed across, as she called it
She said that people who passed across were picky about who they'd communicate with, not like most people you run into on this side
The woman opens her eyes and looks at Ed
Giff me your hant
Ed places his hand in the center of the table
(
) so you needed a guide who they didn't mind talking to, someone with a gift for talking to souls
Ed looks at the woman's spotted and vein-lined hand as it rests upon his
Her mumbling resumes
(
) Well, first she told me that my wife was in a peaceful place, that our souls were still connected by some spiritual bond, that she had never stopped loving me even though she'd done some things she wasn't proud of
Ed looks up at the old woman
(
) She was reading me like a book
She is stealing a glance at Ed to check his reaction
(
) And then she started talking about 'Dolores' this and 'Dolores' that and was there anything  wanted to tell 'Dolores,' and  knew 'd just be telling it to the old bat
And even if somehow Doris could hear, it wouldn't be on account of this so- called medium
Ed is leaving
(
) She was a phony
Just another gabber
Ed emerges from the building
(
) was turning into Ann Nirdlinger, Big Dave's wife
had to turn my back on the old lady, on the veils, on the ghosts, on the dead, before they all sucked me in
Ed disappears into the night
It is night
We are looking through the screen door
Walter Abundas sits in yellow lamplight by a small table on the side of the staircase, over which papers are strewn
He is murmuring into the telephone as he examines the papers, glasses halfway down his nose, a drink in one hand
Ed's hand enters to rap on the door
Walter looks up, sets the phone down and comes to the door
Ed, how're you holding up
'm , Walter, thanks
Walter opens the door to him
'm so damn sorry about your loss
Terrible thing
Just damn terrible
Yeah
Birdy's in the parlor--'m on long distance here
Sure, Walter
Thanks
Birdy also has papers spread across a table in front of her: homework
She looks up at Ed's entrance
Hello, Mr Crane
Hello, Birdy
We haven't seen you since
'm terribly sorry
Ed sits across from her
Yeah
We've certainly missed you
Birdy, 've been doing a lot of thinking
There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me
Life has dealt me some bum cards
He is loading a cigarette into his mouth
or maybe  just haven't played 'em right,  don't know
But you're-- Pop doesn't like people smoking in here
Ed stares
This takes a moment to register
Oh
Sorry
Birdy lowers her voice: Sometimes  have a cigarette in here when he's away
Never when he's in the house
He can smell it a mile off
Ed is pocketing the cigarette
Sure
Sure, it's his house
That's what he keeps telling me
Ed smiles thinly
Anyway, uh
my point is you're young
kid really, your whole life ahead of you
But it's not too soon to start thinking
to start making opportunities for yourself
Before it all washes away
Well, sure,  guess
Pop says so too
work pretty hard at school
That's swell
However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far
There's this guy in San Francisco, 've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best
Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works
His name is Jacques Carcanogues
'm not sure 'm pronouncing it right
Anyway, he's a Frenchman
Boy
You've got talent, anyone could see that
And he's the best
If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing
You're a cinch to be accepted,  could cover the cost of the lessons, like  said, it's pretty modest-- Oh, Mr Crane-- have to do it
can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain
You're young, you don't understand
Geez, Mr Crane,  don't know
hadn't really thought about a career or stuff
know you haven't
Look, just go meet him as a favor to me
talked to this guy
Hope  pronounced his name right
He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when  told him how talented you are
He agreed to see you this Saturday
He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough
His words
Geez, Mr Crane
Just see him, as a favor to me
It is a small square room with straightbacked chairs set against the walls
At the far end of the room a door leads to a studio from which piano music dully emanates; it is a fast and difficult piece of music
Ed sits waiting
He is the only adult; two or three youngsters of different ages sit apparently waiting for their lessons
Ed looks at one of the waiting boys in a white shirt and bow tie
He is perhaps eleven
His hair is greased back in a Junior Contour
Another boy, in a cardigan sweater, sports a Butch
The piano piece is ending
There is the murmur of voices
Dull footsteps
The studio door swings open
small man in a rumpled black suit smudged with cigarette ash is bowing Birdy out the door
He has a goatee and a knotted foulard
His eyes flit over the waiting room and settle on Ed
You are ze fahzer
No
Uh
family friend
am Carcanogues
He smiles at Birdy
You wait, my dear
Sure, Mr
jerk of Carcanogues' head bids Ed rise
Ed enters, uncomfortable
He looks around, taking in the high-ceilinged space, which is dominated by a grand piano
Carcanogues has followed him and now runs water from a tap
speak to you on ze phone, non
You have a special interest in music
Uh-huh
Ah yes, a music lover
Well,  don't pretend to be an expert
Ah
He uncaps a small bottle of pills, shakes two into his palm, tosses them back and washes them down
Ah-hah
He twists a cigarette into a long holder, sticks it in his mouth and lights it
Mm
Well
How'd she do
This elicits a Gallic frown of consideration
Ze girl
She seems like a very nice girl
She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl
Ztinks
Very nice girl
However, ztinks
don't understand
Is not so hard to understand
Her playing, very polite
Did she make mistakes
Another gallic moue: Mistake, no, it says -flat, she plays -flat
Ping-ping
Hit the right note, always
Very proper
don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid-- thought you taught the, uh, the-- Ah, but that is just what  cannot teach
cannot teach her to have a soul
Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers
*Done* with the fingers, yes
But the music, she is inside
Inside, monsieur
two-handed gesture, indicating his heart
The music start here
He waggles his fingers: come out through here; then, maybe
His wave takes in the heavens: she can go up there
Well, look,  don't claim to be an expert-- Then you listen to me, for  am expert
That girl, she give me a headache
She cannot play
Nice girl
Very clever hands
Nice girl
Someday, think, maybe, she make a very good typist
We are driving through the rural countryside of northern California
It is a two-lane road with little traffic
Sun strobes the car through the passing trees
Ed drives, glaring
Birdy, next to him, seems unperturbed, ever cheerful
stank, didn't
He didn't say that
But more or less
Look, 'm no expert, but-- It doesn't matter, Mr Crane
'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown
More qualified
Goddamn phony
But it doesn't matter
Really, 'm not interested in playing music professionally
Ed looks at her
'm not certain 'll have a career at all, and if  do, 'll probably be a veterinarian
Uh-huh
do appreciate the interest you've taken, though
Ah
it's nothing
'm only sorry that  didn't play better for you
know it would've made you happy
You know what you are
Huh
You're an enthusiast
Huh
Yeah
Maybe
He loads a cigarette into his mouth
guess 've been all wet
But  do appreciate it, Mr Crane
She reaches over to touch his thigh
wanted to make you happy
Birdy-- It's
She is leaning over his lap
want to do it, Mr Crane
Ed is shocked: Birdy
He reaches awkwardly, wanting to push her away but not wanting to be violent
No, please
Please, Mr Crane, it's , please-- The blare of an oncoming horn
Ed looks up, one hand struggling with Birdy, the other on the wheel
The oncoming car
Ed swerves, tires screech into a skid, Birdy screams
: the car hits a roadside tree
(
) Time slows down right before an accident, and  had time to think about things
thought about what an undertaker had told me once--that your hair keeps growing, for a while anyway, after you die
hubcap is skipping in slow motion along the road and then off the road, down an embankment
(
) and then it stops
thought, what keeps it growing
Is it like a plant in soil
What goes out of the soil
The soul
And when does the hair realize that it's gone
We are high, looking down at Ed, who is motionless, head resting on the steering wheel of the stopped car
We boom down toward his, slowly rotating as we move in
As we move we lose focus; Ed becomes more and more blurry
The blurry shape is now slowly spinning away from us, a bright revolving disc spinning up into the darkness until it disappears, leaving only black
Ed sits on the front porch of his bungalow, smoking a cigarette in the late afternoon light
dog barks next door; a distant screen door slams; children are playing somewhere up the street
Ed looks down at his watch
It is 5:30
Something attracts his attention: at the foot of his driveway stands a man in a cream-colored suit and hat
He is a small figure, perfectly still, staring at the gravel driveway
After a beat he lifts up a small clipboard, squints at the house, and jots something down
He finishes writing, screws the lid back onto his pen, and is sticking it into a breast pocket when he realizes he is being watched
His manner instantly warms
Hello
Hello
The man starts up the walk
notice you still have peastone in your driveway
Yeah
Well, of course, you don't have to rejuvenate that once every couple of years, don't you, when the peastone thins out
Ed shrugs
Where does it go, huh
Like the odd sock
But you *know* where it goes--you probably pick pieces of it off your lawn all the time, churn it up with your lawn mower, sweep it off the walk here--pain in the neck
Ed shrugs again
Doesn't bother me
Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam
People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth
car pulls into the drive
but we have the technology now to bring it to the homeowner, the individual consumer, at a very reasonable price
Doris emerges from the car
Mind if  show you the specifications
--Evening, ma'am
Doris gives him a hard look
What're *you* selling
The man gives a practiced laugh
Well, ma'am,  was just telling your husband here about tar Macadam, for your home driveway here--these are the specs
Doris takes the brochure he has pulled from a small case
It's the modern way to-- Doris tears the brochure in half and hands it back
Get lost
The man gazes at her
His smile fades fast and he and Doris stare at each other, two hard cases
He turns stiffly and stalks off
Once his gaze has broken, Doris turns as well
She stalks up the stairs to the porch and bangs through the screen front door of the house, letting it slam behind her
Quiet, early evening
Ed sits, smoking
At length he rises and goes in to the house
It is dim, no lights on yet
We hear banging and clomping from the kitchen
Doris emerges with a clinking sound, chasing ice cubes around a drink with a swizzle stick
Her face is still hard-set
With a groan of its old upholstery springs she sits onto the couch
Ed sits as well
He draws on his cigarette, drags an ashtray closer on the coffee table
She sips
He puffs
Doris-- Nah, don't say anything
'm alright
The sit
The light is failing
The clink of ice cubes
In the black we hear machine noise of indistinct origin
As the noise becomes more defined we also hear shouting, faint, distant: Are you there
Are you awake
blurry white disc is fading up
As it focuses it resolves into the reflector worn by a white-robed doctor, leaning in close
He leans away, murmuring: He's coming around
Can you talk, sir
These men have to talk
Ed is lying in a hospital bed
His face is bandaged and one side is grotesquely swollen
The machine noise is life support
Sir
Are you awake
He's awake
Two police officers, Persky and Krebs, lean in
Are you awake
Is he awake
Crane
We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious
His eyes are open
Uh
you're under arrest
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you
Does he understand that
We're supposed to tell him
Are you conscious
You'll go to the prison hospital
Under arrest for murder
Ed's speech is thickened by injuries and anesthesia: Birdy
didn't mean to-- What'd he say
Birdy
Birdy
The girl
No, the girl's
Broken clavicle
The doctor leans in
That's the collarbone, Crane
Broken
She's  though
So he understands
He's under arrest for murder
Big Dave
Huh
What'd he say
Does he understand
He said
Is that what he said
Krebs raises his voice: You're under arrest for the murder of Creighton Tolliver
Do you understand
The voices are fading away: Does he understand
Light glimmers in water
We are drifting down, down, down
We bring in languidly waving arms--the arms of a child, waving to keep himself submerged
It is a ten-year-old boy staring, wide-eyed, at something in front of him
Bubbles intermittently stream from his open mouth
(
) The pansy
kid diving at a waterhole outside of town had found his car
The reverse shows the car, also submerged, with Creighton Tolliver inside, also wide-eyed, his hairpiece attached at only one corner, the rest of it waving free
(
) They'd winched it out
We are tracking laterally across a line of faces: seated men
The men rise
(
) and found he'd been beaten, just like Big Dave said--beaten to death
We arc around a judge entering the chamber through the small door behind his raised bench
(
) Inside the briefcase were the partnership papers 'd signed
The judge seats himself and we resume out lateral track on the jury, now reseating itself
(
) showing that 'd given him ten grand
For the district attorney
In response to a prompt from the judge the district attorney rises to read the charge
His voice plays distantly, muted, the words not discernible under the continuing voice-over
(
) that made it fall into place: 'd gotten Doris to steal the money, the pansy had gotten wise somehow, and 'd had to kill him to cover my tracks
was in a spot
called in Freddy Riedenschneider
Riedenschneider rises into frame at the defense table
As he listens to the charge: (
) and signed the house over to him
He said he didn't ordinarily work that cheap, but he figured he owed me something since the last one hadn't played out
The drone of the
has ended and Riedenschneider's echoing voice drops into the hole: Not guilty, your honor
(
) tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me
He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave
Riedenschneider claps Ed reassuringly on the shoulder as he sits next to him
Ed still wears a cast on one arm and one leg
(
) He told me not to worry, though, said he'd think of something, Freddy Riedenschneider wouldn't let me down
We are tracking in on Ed, lying on the bunk in his cell
(
) They put me on twenty-four-hour deathwatch
reverse track shows a guard on a tilted-back straightbacked chair, outside the cell door, staring at Ed
(
) so that  couldn't Cheat Justice like they said my wife had done
The district attorney is rising again, this time to address the jury
(
) But in front of the jury they had it that Doris was a saint; the whole plan had been mine,  was a Svengali who'd forced Doris to join my criminal enterprise
The district attorney is pointing at Ed
cynically used his own wife as a cat's paw in a scheme of diabolical cunning
(
) On and on it went, how 'd used Doris and then let her take the fall
That stuff smarted because some of it was close to being true
The district attorney seats himself
The jury's eyes turn to Freddy Riedenschneider, who studies the tabletop in front of him, either digesting the
's opening statement, or seeking inspiration for his own
(
) And then it was Freddy Riedenschneider's turn
Riedenschneider rises, paces, begins to talk
(
) gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes
He talked about how 'd lost my place in the universe
a puny player on the great world's stage
(
) how  was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the
made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris
who among us is in a position to say
(
) He told them to look at me--look at me close
That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that  wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that  was the barber, for Christ's sake
We pan the jury, solemnly listening to Riedenschneider
(
) was just like them, an ordinary man, guilty of living in a world that had no place for me, guilty of wanting to be a dry cleaner, sure, but not of murder
Riedenschneider is striding energetically into the foreground to point a finger directly at Ed's face
(
) He said  *was* Modern Man, and if they voted to convict me, well, they'd be practically cinching the noose around their own necks
He told them to look not at the facts but at the meaning of the facts, and then he said the facts *had* no meaning
It was a pretty good speech, and even had me going
tap on the shoulder turns Ed around
(
) until Frankie interrupted it
Frank socks Ed, sending him clattering to the floor
bailiff immediately restrains him, but Frank looms over Ed, bellowing through tears: What kind of man *are* you
What kind of man *are* you
Riedenschneider interposes his body between Frank's and Ed's, loudly protesting: Move for a mistrial, your honor
Move for a mistrial
This outrageous display cannot help but prejudice
Ed moves to get up, but Riedenschneider, with a sidelong glance and furtive gesture, motions for him to stay on the floor
and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women
(
) Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry
There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway
Ed is now standing next to a distinguished older gentleman who enters the plea in the new trial: Your honor, we plead guilty, with extenuating circumstances
(
) who threw me on the mercy of the court
It was my only chance, he said
guess that meant  never had a chance
The judge starts droning the sentence: a menace to society
a predator on his own wife, his business associates, on an innocent young girl
social contract
line crossed
the offender forfeits the right to his own life
hereby order that you be taken to a place of confinement
We are tracking down the hall
(
) He wasn't buying any of that Modern Man stuff, or the uncertainty stuff, or any of the mercy stuff either
No, he was going by the book, and the book said  got the chair
Ed is in the cell at the end of the hall, lying on his bunk, hands clasped behind his head
(
) so here  am
At first  didn't know how  got here
knew step by step of course, which is what 've told you, step by step; but  couldn't see any pattern
Ed sits at the little table next to his bunk, writing
(
) Now that 'm near the end, 'm glad that this men's magazine paid me to tell my story
Writing it has helped me sort it all out
They're paying five cents a word, so you'll pardon me if sometimes 've told you more than you wanted to know
Recent issues of the magazine, Gent, and its sister publication Nugget lie on the little desk
Their lurid covers depict feature stories like      and , (
) But now, all the disconnected things seems to hook up
Ed sets aside the pen, lies down on his bunk, and closes his eyes
(
) That's the funny thing about going away, knowing the date you're gonna die--and the men's magazine wanted me to tell how that felt
We hear a pulsing treble hum
Ed opens his eyes
The door to his cell is open
He rises and goes through the door
Ed, alone, walks down the hallway
The pulsing treble hum is louder
(
) Well, it's like pulling away from the maze
While you're in the maze you go through willy-nilly, turning where you think you have to turn, banging into dead ends, one thing after another
Ed emerges into the empty prison yard ringed by high stone walls
hard spotlight shines down from above
Ed squints into it
(
) But get some distance on it, and all those twists and turns, why, they're the shape of your life
It's hard to explain
The spotlight is from a hovering flying saucer
We see its revolving underside and, as it irregularly cants, a bit of its top bubble
After spinning briefly, it tips and flies away, carrying the tremolo hum with it
(
) But seeing it whole gives you some peace
Ed turns and re-enters the prison
' Ed is lying on his bunk, eyes closed, hands clasped behind his head
hand enters to shake him awake
Three men loom over him: two guards and another man wearing a surplice and holding a bible
(
) The men's magazine also asked about remorse
Yeah,  guess 'm sorry about the pain  caused other people
He is walking the last mile
(
) but  don't regret anything
Not a thing
used to
used to regret being the barber
door at the end opens: An electric chair
Straps open, and waiting: (
) dont know where 'm being taken
Ed is placed in the chair
(
) don't know what waits for me, beyond the earth and sky
But 'm not afraid to go
man stoops at his feet
He has a bucket of water and a straight razor
He waggles the razor in the water and starts shaving a patch of Ed's calf
(
) Maybe the things  don't understand will be clearer there, like when a fog blows away
Ed watches as the razor makes the trip from his leg to the bucket of water, which begins to spot with small floating hairs
(
) Maybe Doris will be there
They are strapping him in, connecting the electrodes
(
) And maybe there  can tell her
The men withdraw
(
) all those things
thin man in a dark suit and fedora stands by the switch
As he reaches for the switch, Ed looks up into the light
(
) they don't have words for here
