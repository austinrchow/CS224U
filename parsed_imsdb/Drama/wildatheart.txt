href <b>// --> </b> a love story written by David Lynch based on the book by Barry Gifford And now the story of Sailor and Lula
1
- rides a screaming massive Japanese motorcycle - wound out to maximum
up the street
: 2 The sign reads   -
: 3
- With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed bump
The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab
In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by
The motorcycle bounces off a black 66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like the end of the world
The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later
Like a broken ragdoll shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass for a block
He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of blood forms out his nose
The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing howl for one entire city block
: 4
-   - Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each others flesh
An  , both with walkers, inch painfully along nearby
Oh my God
Why they doin that
Who the hell knows
What you have in your mouth
The old woman begins to turn away, covering her mouth with her hand
Spit it out
Pull your teeth out
doctor said
What you tryin to do
The Old Man grabs the Old Woman by the neck and squeezes
Out comes a tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies
: 5 thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest -  sporting hideous grins, bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks
One kid busies himself shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the nest
Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk
All the kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other
: 6
- The telephone rings
, a rich Southern woman around fifty, carries her Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth drink across the livingroom and answers the phone
Hello
Who is this
: 7
- stands by as  , twenty-three years old - lost somewhere between the cool long-gone generation and a used-car salesman - speaks on a prisoner phone in a green cement cubicle with one bench
(into phone) Sailor Ripley
Can  talk to Lula
: 6A
- Theres no way in hell you can speak to her and
: 7A
- (feeling a smile coming on) What
: 6B
- Yes you heard me
Dont ever call back here again
Marietta hangs up the phone as   , Mariettas twenty-year old daughter, comes quickly down the stairs
Mama
You know who it was and you know you arent, and  mean gonna see him
End of story
(quietly) Like hell
Marietta, her hand still on the telephone, grips the receiver so hard her knuckles turn white
: 8
-    - Lula enters her room and cranks up her stereo
Speed metal music jumps up to around one hundred twenty decibels
: 9
- The guard escorts Sailor away from the telephone and back to his cell
The iron bars of the door slide across Sailors face and close with a bang
: 10
- beat-up, red 64 Ford Falcon station wagon filled with insane on speed and  race out of control down the street past the club - leaning out the car in every direction
They scream out to the desolate-looking passerby
The camera cranes up to the neon club sign and gets lost among the hot pink neon, the frantic moths and the intense electric buzz
: 11
- Lula and her friend,  , sit at a table drinking rum Coca-Colas while watching and listening to a white blues band called The group segues smoothly from Elmore Jamess Dust my Broom into Robert Johnsons Me and the Devil and Beany lets out a snort
can dig this music
But not that singer
Why
Hes right in the groove
Hes so ugly
Guys with beards and beer guts aint quite my type
(giggles) Seeins how youre about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, dont know how you can criticize
Yeah, well, if he says that all that flab turns into dick at midnight, hes a liar
Lula and Beany laugh and swallow some of their drinks
So, Sailors gettin out soon, and youre gonna see him
Lula nods and crushes an ice cube with her back teeth and chews it
Meetin him at the gate
That phone call this afternoon was the signal
My deranged mamas hid the keys to my car
But of course,  know exactly where they are
didnt hate me so much, Id feel better wishin you luck
Cant all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo probly wouldnta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadnt kicked his ass out
So youre gonna be needin the blue-bird pretty soon
Real soon
Ill be makin the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany
The Bleach Boys kick into some kind of Professor Longhair swamp mambo
: 12
- Plumes of smoke from fires rise in the distance
: 13
- An empty livingroom
The smoke from the city fire appears during the course of the  to be in the livingroom - then it disappears
An empty hallway
An empty stairway
13A
-   - Feet (Lulas) was across carpet
closet door opens
hand (Lulas) reaches into the pocket of a coat in her mothers closet
The hand comes out clutching car keys
13B
-  - Lula races down the stairs and through a door into the garage
: 14
- The electronic garage door opens and Lula drives her 80 Black Camaro out and away
The garage door closes automatically
: 15
- Lula drives fast up a neighborhood street
She turns a corner and disappears
: 16
- Lula throws her car keys under the front seat and goes around to Beanys 67 dark blue Thunderbird convertible - fishes around under the -Birds front seat for the keys - finds them - jumps in and takes off
: 17
- Marietta leaves her Cadillac Seville in her driveway and enters the house
We can hear her calling out for Lula in the distance
The calling changes - it becomes angry
The garage door opens and Marietta comes storming out
She leaps in her Caddy and peels out
: 18
- Marietta enters the bar on the run
She calls out to the
Wheres Johnnie
Hes not in his office
Havent seen im yet today, Marietta
(slightly hysterical) Well  gotta find him - right this minute
: 19
- Sailor is waiting out front as Lula pulls up in her -Bird - throwing out a cloud of dust
Theyre both smiling
Hey baby
Peanut
They kiss tenderly and then Sailor walks around the car to get in while Lula opens up a suitcase and gets out his snakeskin jacket
Hey, my snakeskin jacket
Thanks, baby
Did  ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom
Bout fifty thousand times
got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what
hear Powermads at The Hurricane
(smiling) Stab it and steer
Lula tromps it and throws out an even larger cloud of dust
: 20
- Sailor and Lula lay on the bed in the Cape Fear Hotel listening to the fan creak
Did you ever think somethin like about the wicked witch of the east comin flyin in
Did you ever think somethin and then later think youve said it out loud to someone
really did miss your mind while was out at Pee Dee, honey
The rest of you, too, of course
But the way your head works is Gods own private mystery
What was it you was thinkin
Well,  was thinkin about smokin actually
My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools
stole em from her beginnin in about sixth grade
When  got old enough to buy my own,  bought those
Now Ive just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed
Theyre longer
guess  started smokin when  was about six
My mama was already dead from lung cancer
What brandd she smoke
Camels, same as me
Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness
Gee, Sailor
Im sorry, honey never would have guessed it
Its okay
hardly used to see them anyway
didnt have much parental guiding
The public defender kept sayin that at my parole hearin
He was a good ol boy, stood by me
Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time
Id stand by you, Sailor
through anything
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after planted Bob Ray Lemon
man cant ask for more than that
Lula pulls Sailor over to her and kisses him soft on the mouth
You move me, Sailor, you really do
You mark me the deepest
Sailor pulls down the sheet, exposing Lulas breasts
Youre perfect for me, too
You remind me of my daddy, you know
Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies
He had a long nose, too, like theirs
Did  ever tell you how he died
In a fire, as  recall
Started he couldnt remember things
Got real violent
Mama kept tellin me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin the old paint off our house without usin a mask
But dont know
Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces
: 21
-  - tears a door off the kitchen cabinets and strews the cabinet contents all across the counter and floor
He puts his fist through the kitchen window
He leaps on the counter and bats the kitchen ceiling light - smashing it
He kicks over the refrigerator
: 22
- Lulas eyes look off, remembering
Finally in the middle of the one night, with me and mama asleep upstairs
he poured kerosene over himself and lit a match
: 23
-  - Clyde Fortune, completely engulfed in fire, races across and back the livingroom until he collapses in a fifties modern armchair
The drapes behind him burst in flames
(voice-over) Near burned down the house
We got out just in time
The whole livingroom goes up in flames
: 24
- the red hot ash of Lulas cigarette as she inhales deeply
As she exhales a cloud of smoke she turns to Sailor
It was a year before  met you
Sailor takes the cigarette out of Lulas hand and puts it into the ashtray by her bed
He pulls her to him and kisses her throat
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck
It was like on a statue it was so white
Sailor drifts his thumb over Lulas left nipple then cups her breast in his hand
They kiss
: 25
- Marietta pours   another shot of scotch
knew this would happen
Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee,  knew thered be trouble
Hes just got some kind of influence over her  cant decipher
Theres somethin wild in Lula  dont know where it comes from
You gotta find em, Johnnie
He served his time for what he did
Another thing
If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there aint much can be done about it
Dont talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut
know what volition means, and thats why  want Sailor Ripley off the planet
Hes pure slime and its leakin all over my baby
Maybe you could push him into makin some kinda move and then kill him dead
Youd only be defendin yourself, and with his record, nobodyd fuss
Johnnie pours himself another tumblerful of Walker Black Label
Ill locate Lula, Marietta, and if shes with the Ripley boy, Ill give him a talkin to and try to convince her to come back with me
Thats about all  can do
He takes a long swallow from the tumbler
Marietta begins to cry
She blubbers for a few seconds, and then stops as abruptly as shed started
Her grey eyes glaze over
Ill hire a hit man if you dont want to help me stop this thing
Ill call Marcello Santos
Now, Marietta,  am goin to help you
And dont be gettin carried away
You dont want to be bringin Santos and his people into it
Youre just jealous of Santos cause hes sweet on me
Darlin, you aint seein Santos again, are ya
Oh, Johnnie Farragut
Dont you trust your very own Marietta
Sorry, sweetheart
Bein in love with you like  am brings out that ugly jealous side
Well stop worryin about me and start worryin about how youre gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer
Sailor aint a murderer
You got to get off that kick
And fars  can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin Lula
Even there he was protectin her
You oughta be thankin him for that
That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin after the both of em
Why am  tellin you this, you was around that night
You ought to know just exactly what happened
Sailor just got a little too forceful is all
You remember that night
of Marietta eyes as she thinks back
: 26
-  - We see Marietta standing in a carpeted hallway above the ballroom
Dance band music can be heard in the distance
Sailor appears coming up the hallway - slightly drunk - he carefully sets his drink on the carpet outside the
Mariettas  of Sailor entering the
of Mariettas glazed eyes and smiling face
Mariettas  of walking toward
: 27
- Maybe  was there, but  didnt see anythin
All  knows that trash killed a man with his bare hands
Hands which are now probly all over my baby
Marietta, settle down now darlin
want whats best for her, too - Like  said, Ill do what  can to bring her home
: 28
- Lula is standing in the bathroom of their room at the Hotel fooling with her hair in front of the mirror
Sailor can see her through the doorway from where he lays on the bed
Sailor, you are somethin else, honey
When  was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon Id be startin to think about sex, and should talk to her before  did anything about it
But honey,  thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen
Thats true
Uncle Pooch wasnt really an uncle
He was a business partner of my daddys
And my mama never knew nothin about me and him - thats for damn sure
His real name was somethin kind of European, like Pucinski
But everyone just called him Pooch
He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away
always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon,  was surprised moren a little
Howd it happen, peanut
He just pull out the old toad and let it croak
Lula brushes away her bangs and frowns
She takes a cigarette from the pack on the sink and lights it, then lets it dangle from her lips while she teases her hair
Youre terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know
cant hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth
Lula takes a long, slow drag on her More and sets it down on the edge of the sink
said you can be too crude sometimes
dont think  care for it
Sorry, sugar
Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed
Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin her hair dyed
And  was alone in the house
: 29
-  - We see what she talks about
(voice-over) Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know
Where was makin a jelly and banana sandwich
remember  had my hair in curlers cause  was goin that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters
Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter
: 30
- Didnt he say somethin
Lula shakes her head
She picks up her cigarette, takes a puff and throws it into the toilet
of cigarette in toilet
Not really
Least not so  recall now
Lula flushes the toilet and watches the More come apart as it swirls down the hole
of cigarette coming apart as it swirls
So howd he finally nail you
Right there in the kitchen
No, he picked me up
: 31
- /  - We see what she talks about
(voice-over) He was short but powerful
With hairy arms
Anyway, he carried me into the maids dayroom which nobody used
We did it there on an old bed
: 32
- We did it
Whattaya mean
Didnt he force you
Well, sure
But he was super-gentle, you know
mean, he raped me and all, but  guess theres all different kinds of rapes
didnt exactly want him to do it but suppose once it started, it didnt seem all that terrible
It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there stayed in bed till  heard him drive off
Then  just went back into the kitchen and finished makin my sandwich
And you never told nobody about it
Just you
Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after
And he never did anything else to me always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry
(pause) : 33
- One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a 54 Ford Pick-Up and a 64 Chevy Station Wagon
No survivors
Balls of flame and grinding metal
: 34
- Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin in Myrtle Beach
They still got way too much traffic there for my taste
And another thing, baby
That government of ours should be keepin us separated from outer space
Here she goes again
Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin
Seems to me the government could do somethin about it
One of these mornings the sunll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an -Ray
Lula strikes a match and lights another cigarette
(laughs) That aint never will happen, honey
Least not in our lifetime
Somewhere in the hotel a woman laughs
It is a kind of wild, crazy laugh, and for the few seconds it lasts, Lulas face goes pale
You okay, honey
That womans laugh creeps me out
heard somethin like that
somewhere before
Soundd like the wicked witch
Just sounded like an old gal havin a good time to me
You ready to dance
Im always ready to dance
But need me a kiss first, honey
Just one
Lula and Sailor kiss
In the middle of the kiss, the womans creepy/crazy laugh is heard again in the distance and Lulas eyes snap open with a kind of fear
: 35
-  -  / Marietta is escorting   and two stiff drinks to a table in her backyard
knew youd want it again
Thats not why  called
Oh yeah - sure
okay
Santos
It isnt
Have it your way
But you want it
Lulas gone off with Sailor
What do you want me to do about it
want you to take care of Sailor, so he wont ever be able to bother my baby again
Take care of him
Yes
What does take care of him mean
Do you want me to give him food or some clothing
Whats with you
You know what take care of him means
dont call Santos except for one big reason
Big is the key word, and Im telling you  want it bad
want you to get rid of Sailor
Get rid of him
Yes
Get rid of him
How would  do that
Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin this stupid game
Just tell me what you want
dont need to explain anymoren have
You know damn well
You need to explain it
All right
want you
to
kill
Sailor
As simple as that
Simple
Kill him
How
Thats your business
dont care how
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt
For Gods sakes, Santos
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb
Santos
Explain it
told you
Shoot him
Shoot him
Like with a gun
Yes
Where
In the leg
No
Where
In the head
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun
Now Im beginning to get it
You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun
Yes
But where in the head
Not the chin,  hope
No
In the brains
What little Im sure he has
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun
Yes
Through the forehead
Yes
Wrong
Its much better to blow a hole in the back of the head
right toward the bridge of the nose Lots and lots of irreparable damage
See
knew you had it all under control
Why didnt you send Johnnie Farragut
Maybe  did
Try New Orleans first
Lula cant ever stop talkin bout that town
On one condition
He pauses and smiles strangely
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut
(whisper) Santos
No
Please, Santos
Youre not tellin me that youre sweet on him
No
But
One day hes gonna find out what were up to with Mr
Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble
They stare at each other for a moment
Im gonna take your silence as a yes
Santos
cant
Shhhh
Its all right
Also, either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed
You fucker, dont you ever touch Lula -  You fucker, Ill kill you
(laughing) Put your shoulders back
What
Put your shoulders back,  said
Marietta puts her shoulders back and Santos comes and stands in front of her
You got nice tits
Someones gonna see us
(smiling as he starts to feel her breasts) Thats just another part of the price to pay
Santos
You kill that Sailor, otherwise hes gonna turn my baby against me
Santos lifts one hand up to Mariettas chin and raises her face up towards his
Look at me
Theres no turning back on this
Im gonna kill Sailor
Thats for sure
: 36
-     - We see the sign which has all the letters tipped way over to the right - as if in a hurricane
Two leaning palm trees border the sign
One hundred decibels of speed metal
We see the name Powermad on the bass drum
The  segues into Slaughter House and its a hot one
Sailor grabs Lula and they start dancing like two jacked-up spastics in an electrical storm
a few  actually stop dancing to watch Sailor and Lula
They thought theyd seen everything
of Lula and Sailor - theyre in love and dancing hot
An moves close to Lula and rubs up against her as he dances by
Sailor turns to the lead guitar player and signals him to stop the music immediately
Suddenly everything is deathly quiet
Sailor gives the man a fully extended Reno point
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl
Or are you gonna save youself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her
Dont fuck with me, man
You look like a clown in that stupid jacket
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me its a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom
Asshole
(as he moves toward the Idiot Punk) Come here
Sailor, honey
The Idiot Punk tries to hit Sailor, but Sailor slaps him so hard his knees almost bend backwards
The Idiot Punk goes down - fighting back tears and holding his cheek
(helping him up) Im sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but  want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl
(to Lula) Im sorry
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all
Thats good
Now go get yourself a beer
(turning to the band) You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had
Yall know this one
Sailor starts to sing an Elvis Presley song, Love Me
As the band joins in with a perfect back-up - Sailor sings to Lula
The Speed Metal crowd is mesmerized
: 37
- of pink - the whole screen is filled with pink nylon
Panning down, we see Lulas breasts, which stand up and say hello
Lula puts on her favorite pink shortie nightgown
Why didnt ya sing Love Me Tender
You told me that was your favorite love song
Sailor turns around from his sprawled on the bed position watching The Dating Game show
Cause Im only gonna sing that song to my wife
Lula makes a face
She lies down on the bed next to Sailor
What you want to watch this trash for
Aint one of those people have a real thought in their brain
That so
(keeping his gaze on the ) You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately
What you have to get personal about so quick
All  mean is you could possibly read a book
Sailor grunts
Whats that honey
We didnt have no  up at Pee Dee, baby, you know
Lula slides her head up and kisses Sailor on the cheek
Im sorry, sweetie
forget some moments where all you been the last two years
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all
Dont need to make moren it was
(referring to Dating Game show) This couples goin on a date to Hawaii
The girl chose him over the other two guys
Dont the reject guys get anythin
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken
That dont seem fair
Hell, why should the Datin Game be different from real life
At least them boys is gonna get somethin to eat
- Sailor and Lula are in bed
Lula lays in Sailors arms
Sailor
Yeah
Wouldnt it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives
(laughing) You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut
Aint we been doin a pretty fair job this far
Oh, you know exactly what  mean, honey
Itd make the future so simple and nice
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know
Gettin out
And what youll do and what youll think about when youre on the outside again
just think about things as they come up
never been much of a planner
It aint altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes
Lula,  done a few things in my life aint too proud of, but Ill tell ya from now on  aint gonna do nothin for no good reason
All know for sure is theres moren a few bad ideas runnin around loose out there
of match girding along the strike pad and bursting into flame
Lula lights her cigarette
You know theres somethin  aint never told you about, Sailor, and this heres a story with the lesson that theres a right time and a wrong time for things to happen
When  was almost sixteen  got pregnant
Sailor looks her in the eyes
Musta been a lesson tellin ya it was the wrong time
What did you do, your mama find out
(nods) She got me an abortion
: 38
-  - of dying fetus with one hundred twenty decibels Lulas scream over
The fetus twitches in its little pod of blood
of pulsing vein in Lulas neck -     - -
of Lulas forehead covered in sweat running down to her eyes - open wide and
of fetus into medical trash can
of bloodied abortion instruments
The  leans across the abortion table
(voice-over) from some old doctor with the hairiest nostrils and ears  ever seen
of doctors nose and ears
(voice-over) Afterwards
Momma says
We see Marietta standing next to the doctor
(voice-over) hope you appreciate my spendin six hundred dollars, not countin what it cost us to get here and back
This mans the best damn abortionist in the South
: 39
- You tell the boy who knocked you up
It was my cousin, Dell, done it
His folks used to visit with us summers
What happened to him
Oh, nothin
never let on to mama about Dell bein the one
just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was
didnt tell Dell, neither
He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and  didnt see the point
Somethin terrible happened to him, though
Six months ago
Whats that, peanut
Dell disappeared
Dell was learnin a hard lesson
What  learned from observin Dell is  think people who are frightened want to disappear
Hed startin behavin weird
Like comin up to people every fifteen minutes and askin how they were doin
: 40
-  - , wearing a soiled double-knit suit stops a  in the street, and smiling about the fact that earlier that morning hes placed a cockroach on his anus, he speaks to the woman
Howre ya doin
: 41
- And just seemin real spacey and actin funny
Actin funny how
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dells mama
She found cockroaches in Dells underwear
: 42 of Aunt Rootie - unfolds a pair of dirty jockey shorts and several cockroaches fall out
: 43
- One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin one big cockroach on his anus
Hell, peanut
One time - real late - like about two thirty a
m
She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin sandwiches in the kitchen
: 44
-  - In the dark kitchen,   finds Dell making sandwiches - slicing them on the diagonal
Whatre ya doin
Makin my lunch
(voice-over) Dell told her he was makin his lunch and goin to work
Hes a welder
And she made him go back to bed
We see Aunt Rootie cross the kitchen - take the knife away from Dell and lead him out of the kitchen
: 45
- Then hed carry on about the weather
Talk about how rainfalls controlled by aliens livin on earth
Also how men wearin black leather gloves
: 46
-   - Dell, crying uncontrollably, is in the center of the room squatting like an indian in his jockey shorts
He has a long ruler stretched out in front of him which hes using to press down on the top of a lone black glove on the floor
(voice-over) are followin him around
Probly the rain boys from Outer Space
: 47
- It aint so funny now, though
December before Christmas
Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him
He was missin for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit
48A
- Dell walking to house
: 48
- Dell enters the front door in a Santa Claus suit so filthy you can hardly see the red through the black
He walks right past Aunt Rootie and goes back into the kitchen
There he immediately does a spread- eagle on the floor and violently scratches his left ankle
(voice-over) The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars
Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would give him peace of mind
Nobodys seen him since
: 49
- Sound like ol Dells moren just a little confused, peanut
Too bad he couldnt visit that ol Wizard of Oz and get some good advice
Too bad we all cant, baby
One thing about Dell
Whats that
When he was about seventeen, he startin losin his hair
So
Hes twenty-four now
year older than you
And must be bout bald
Theres worse things that can happen to a man, honey
Yeah,  suppose
But you know somethin baby, hair does make a difference
Lula turns to study Sailor
sure am glad they didnt give you no prison haircut
(sexual whisper) Gives me somethin to grab hold of while were makin love
They kiss passionately
: 50
- Sailor gets up from the bed and begins putting on his clothes
Lula is painting her toenails red
Lets go dancin, peanut
Im ready
We gotta be careful, honey, my mamas gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and hes one clever detective
You know how clever
He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington
My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar
Youre twenty years old - arent you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin us apart
Puttin a detective on us
Ill tell ya Lula
Well
Its moren me killin Bob Ray Lemon
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much
Yeah, maybe
Sailors eyes seem to be thinking back
: 51
-    - We see an empty carpeted hallway and can hear a ballroom dance band playing in the distance
Sailor obviously slightly drunk, comes down the hall
He carefully, almost losing his balance, places his drink outside the   and enters
Marietta standing down at the other end of the hall - also drunk - smiles and stares at the   door through her glazed eyes
Sailor enters the
: 52
-
- Sailor steps up to a urinal and starts doing his business
Marietta suddenly appears - drunk and laughing
She grabs him and pulls him into a stall - closing and locking the door behind them
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lulas mama
No
Well, she wants to fuck you
She starts trying to French kiss Sailor when an   comes in to urinate and Sailor and Marietta freeze - in a kiss
Sailor is going crazy in one way (wishing this wasnt happening
)  Marietta is going crazy in another
The man finishes and as he leaves
(covering his eyes from seeing them) Lousy fuckin homosexuals
(instantly pulling away from Marietta) What are you, sick
Im with Lula
No
just wanted to kiss you good-bye
You know too much bout little Lulas mom
Whattya mean

- of Lulas dancing feet in black spiked-heel sandals exposing blurred blood red toenails
Lula and Sailor are at it again - dancing as if plugged in to the main power plant
: 55
-     - Drenched in sweat, Sailor and Lula sit at a corner table chug-a-lugging Rolling Rock during the bands break
Lula notices a girl in the corner eye-balling Sailor
She splits her attention between the girl and Sailor
Thats an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy
Yeah,  had my first taste on that trip to Juarez
At that age you still got a lot of energy
You still got plenty energy for me, baby
Lula has had enough of the girl staring at Sailor
Take a picture, bitch
Itll last longer
Oh yeah
Ill slap those eyes right outta your head
The girl gets up in a huff and leaves
Sorry, baby
Whens the first time you done it with a girl who wasnt hookin
Maybe two, three months after Juarez

girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me
: 56
-  - We see what he talks about

: 57
-     - Whatd you say to her
Told her my name
Then she said somethin like, Its so noisy down here
Why dont we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves
She turned around and led the way

: 59
-     - Oh, baby

(laughing) Thats just what she said

found her lyin on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines
She was a wild chick
She was wearin bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin lacy black stripes down the sides
You know, them kind that doesnt go all the way down your leg
You mean like pedal pushers

: 60
- We see what he talks about
(voice-over) She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it
: 61
-     - Youre excitin me, honey

Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, wont suck you
Dont ask me to suck you
Poor baby
She dont know what she missed
What color hair she have
Sorta brown, blonde,  guess
But dig this, sweetie
Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me

What do you mean by necessary
Shes probly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p

She knew  was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but  dont figure she counted on us takin off together like this

You guess
My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County
Whatll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think

We got through two states already
Lula lights up a cigarette
That dont smell like a More
It aint
Its part of the lessons of life

They sure do stink
Yeah,  guess, but - and heres the lesson part - they aint supposed to be so bad for you
You aint gonna begin worryin about whats bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar

Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer
Dont exaggerate
Okay, manslaughterer whos broke his parole and got in mind nothin but immoral purposes fars youre concerned
Thank the Lord
Well, you aint let me down yet, Sailor

Sailor laughs and shoots the -Bird up to seventy

69   - Johnnie Farragut drives down a Southern highway on his mission
: 66
- Life is a bitch and then you marry one
What kinda trash talk is that

On that pickup
Thats disgustin
Those kinda sentiments shouldnt be allowed out in public

- They pass the Biloxi City Limit sign
How about that one
The Host of the Old South Hotel
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but well try her
: 67
- The room is large but cheap
Lula strips off the dishwater grey bedspread and tosses it over by the bureau
Sailor looks out the broken window
--- hotel bedspreads
They dont hardly never get washed, and dont like the idea of lyin on other peoples dirt
Come look at this
(going to the window) Whats that, honey
(thinking about death) There aint no water in the swimmin pool
Just a dead tree fell in, probly from bein struck by lightnin
(thinking about granddad) Its huge
This musta been a grand old place at one time
Lets get fed, sweetheart
The lights fadin fast

- Marcello Santos is making a phone call
Hello there, Mr
Reindeer
Marcello Santos speaking
: 69
- An old man,
, wearing a tuxedo is sitting on the toilet - his pants down - talking on the bathroom phone
He laughs a long deep smokers laugh
(laughing) Mr
Marcello Santos
Hey there
That was great shit you sent in last month
: 68A

: 71
- Sailor and Lula are walking along the beach
Lula takes off her shoes
(sing-song spells) -i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i
You can almost hear that jazz blowin up from the big
Lula
learned somethin interestin today on a science show  heard on the radio
How leeches is comin back into style
Say what
Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes
She takes out a cigarette the length and width of a Dixon Ticonderoga No
2 pencil and lights it
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh
Yeah, its a real problem for me, Sailor, you know
When  went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi
saw em by the register and the girl throw em in
Im not big on resistin
So what about a leech
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin leeches again, just in old times
You know, when even barbers used em
(shuddering) got one on me at Lake Lanier
Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off
Felt awful
He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it
Sailor laughs
Yeah, well listen to this
Radio said back in the 1920s a -talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin, theyd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks
Then put leeches on it
: 71A
of  with forearm sewed to nose
: 72
- Sailor
You expect me to believe a mand be goin around with a arm sewed to his nose
(nodding) How they used to do it
Course they got more sophisticated ways now
Radio said the Chinese,  think it is, figured a better idea is by insertin a balloon in the forehead and lettin it hand down on the nose
Lula shrieks
Sailor Ripley
You stop
Youre makin this shit up and  aint gonna sit for it
Honest, Lula
probly aint precisely got all the facts straight, but its about what they said
Honey, were goin to bed now and its time to change the subject
Shes so cute Sailor just has to kiss her
: 73
-   - Sailor and Lula pass a sign that reads   - 26
Sailor pulls off the road into a Gulf gas station mini-mart and stops the car next to a self-serve pump
sign on the top of it says Were about dry bones, sweetheart
We dont wanna have to push this bird into New Orleans
We sure dont, honey
(shouting to Sailor as he goes into the store) Get me a Mounds

- - tall    about seventy years old, wearing a torn green Tulane tee-shirt and a dirty orange Saints baseball cap, is filing items on the counter by the cash register
In the pile are four ready-made, plastic-wrapped sandwiches, two tuna salad and two cotto salami; six Twinkies; a package of Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies; four Slice colas; two Barqs root beers; and a large package of fried pork rinds, extra salted
(to Sailor and another guy also waiting to pay for gas) Sorry, gentlemen
Im most finished on my shoppin here
This be it
Yall take American Express
Yessir
Then lemme throw in a couple more things
Sailor and the man in line behind him watch as the black man gathers up several more packages of Twinkies along with a few cupcakes and half a dozen cans of Pretty Kitty cat food, three liver and three chicken dinner portions, and tosses them on his pile
(to Sailor, smiling - showing no visible upper teeth) Pussycats gotta eat, too
He hands an American Express card to the clerk, , who runs it through the verifier
The card checks out okay and the old guy prepares a charge slip, has the man sign it, and bags the purchases
(to Erv) Id just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if its same to you
(shoving the plastic bag he filled towards the black man) We dont have no paper bags
telephone begins to ring and everyone looks around
The Black Man reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out a portable phone and punches send
(into phone) Hello
Yeah, mama, Im on my way
(to Sailor and other guy as he picks up his bag and heads out) Thanks for waitin, gentlemen
Everyone is silent as they watch the old Black Man hobble out
(to Erv) All  wants ten bucks regular
Oh yeah, and a Mounds bar
Erv takes one off the candy and gum rack next to the register and lays it on the counter
Sailor gives him a twenty dollar bill
aint got my American Express card with me, so  gotta use cash
Hope thats okay
Sailor smiles, but the clerk keeps a poker face and just gives him his change
The guy in line behind Sailor shakes his head and grins
75
/ - Sailor goes back to the car
That took long enough
You forget my Mounds
Sailor tosses her the candy bar
really do think the country done changed just a little while  was away, peanut
Lula sinks her small white teeth into the chocolate-covered coconut
(as she chews) You got to keep an eye on it
Thats sure
Sailor starts pumping gas
: 76
- of mail slot
Two silver dollars comes through it and one falls head up and the other tails on the rug below
: 77
- Mr
Reindeer is just finishing dialing a number on the telephone
coupla silver dollars came my way today
Im sending one of them to you with a paper on the beneficiary As usual, you are completely free to fulfill the obligation in any manner you so desire
He hangs up the phone and starts dialing another number
: 78
-   - At a table near the window, Johnnie takes a man-sized pull off his Dixie beer in between bites of an oyster sandwich
large, chocolate-colored man in his early thirties,    , and a smaller white man,   approach with their trays of food
Do you mind if we share this table
The others, they are occupied
Johnnie looks around - sees that there are quite a few empty tables - he looks the men over quickly
(cautiously) Alright
By all means
Make yourselves at home
(as he sits down) Muchas gracias
My name is Reginald San Pedro Sula
But please do call me Reggie
This is my friend, who we call Drop Shadow
He is always with me
Johnnie wipes off his right hand on his napkin and shakes
Johnnie Farragut
Pleased to meet ya
Reggie and Drop Shadow begin eating ferociously, finishing half of their meal before saying anything more
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut
Johnnie, please
Nope
Charlotte, North Carolina
Here on business
Reggie smiles broadly, revealing numerous tall, gold teeth
Mr
San Pedro Sula is from Honduras
Do you know Honduras, Johnny
Only that its supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year
Yes, thats so
But there is not much to destroy
No big buildings like in New Orleans
Whattaya do there
(laughs) Oh, many things
Mr
San Pedro Sulas got an appliance shop
But  am also with the government
Johnnie takes a bite of his oyster sandwich
In what capacity
In many capacities
Mr
San Pedro Sula is with the Secret Service
Reggie reaches into his back pocket and takes out his wallet
He hands a card to Johnnie
(reading aloud) General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez
Telefono 666
He is my sponsor
The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras
Mr
San Pedro Sula is one of his operatives
Johnnie hands the card back to Reggie and Reggie gives him a small piece of paper, folded once
Johnnie unfolds it
The printing is in Spanish
That is my permiso
Mr
San Pedro Sulas permit to kill
Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country
(laughs) Of course
Johnnie refolds the piece of paper and hands it over to Reggie
Mr
San Pedro Sulas authorized to carry a
45
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters
have it here, in my briefcase
Reggie holds up his stainless steel briefcase and then replaces it on the floor beneath his chair
Why are you in New Orleans
If you dont mind my askin
Certainly not
We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the
He wants to take Mr
San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen
Johnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave
(extending his hand) Its been a real pleasure
wish you both buena suerte wherever you go
Reggie and Drop Shadow stand up
They shake Johnnies hand
The same to you
If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us
The Hondurans are great friends of the American people
But have a joke for you before  go
If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first
couldnt say, which one
Reggie turns to Drop Shadow and lets him have the punch line
(grinning) Who cares
: 79
-   - Sailor and Lula are just finishing making love in their room
As Lula climaxes, her left hand opens and spreads wide
The lay quietly for a moment
love it when your eyes get wild, honey
They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of em
Oh, Sailor youre so aware of what goes on with me
mean, you pay attention
And  swear, you got the sweetest cock
Sometimes its like its talkin to me when youre inside
Like its got a voice all its own
You get right on me
You really are dangerously cute, honey
gotta admit it
Lula lights a cigarette
Lets head out into the crazy world of New Orleans
gotta get somethin to eat
: 80
-   - Sailor and Lula sit at the counter drinking double-sized cups of community coffee
on the stool next to Sailor lights up a rum- soaked crook
My names George Kovich
Bet youve heard of me
Dont know that  have
Should know about you for anythin in particular
Was in all the papers three years ago
Im seventy-six, was only seventy- three then
Had a business in Buffalo, New York, called Rats With Wings
Killed pigeons for anyone who wanted em killed
Why were you killin pigeons, Mr
Kovich
Were you in the extermination business
No, maam
was a housepainter, in the union forty-one years
Im retired now, livin with my sister, Ida
Ida moved down here twenty-five years ago, married an oil man named Smoltz, Ed Smoltz
Hes dead now, so its just me and Ida
sold my house and moved down after the city of Buffalo put me out of business
Hell,  was doin them a service, and they charged me with endangerin the public
Whats wrong with pigeons, Mr
Kovich
Theyre useless pests
Ive shot hundreds of em
: 81
-      - George is shooting pigeons as fast as he can
(voice-over) My neighbors hired me to get rid of the pigeons that gathered on their roofs and porches
: 82
-   - Neighbors asked me how come the spotted bastards didnt light on my house or my brother Earls anymore, and  told em the truth
shot em
Earls gone now
: 83
- Earl pitches forward out of his easy chair and hits the carpet hard - screaming in pain
(voice-over) Heart attack six months ago - had that cholesterol thick as shit
His widow, Mildred, she still lives in the house next to mine
: 84
-   - Shes stone deaf but the racket the pigeons made drove Earl crazy
He could hear em even with the  on
He owned a bar thirty years, The Boilermaker, on Wyoming Street
Earls roof was a favorite spot for pigeons
They lit there day and night
wanted to toss a grenade up there
If your neighbors didnt mind, howd you get put out of business
Woman drivin down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle
She called the police and they came over and arrested me
Thought  was a sniper
Boys at the  loved that one
Cops didnt understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property
used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger
was gonna put out poison, but  was afraid somebodys cat would eat it
Hell,  had six cats myself
So  used the
22 because it didnt make much noise and the ammo was cheap
What happened on the charges
Guilty on a reduced charge
Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist
Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place
You seen it
Plain filth
Kovich stands up and puts some money on the counter
Its a serious situation
Not like the Turks and the Armenians, maybe, or the Arabs and the Jews, but want people to remember me and what Ive done and pick up where  left off
Somebody had to make a move
It was nice meetin you folks
George Kovich nods and leaves
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula
Its just another case, Sailor
Whats that, peanut
One person thinks hes doin somethin good and everbody else gets upset about it
Sailor looks up at Lula
Aint it the way
: 85
-   - Its very quiet in the hotel room and the clock says four a
m
Lula and Sailor are lying in bed arm in arm
Sailor is fast asleep - snoring
Lula is wide awake
Sailor
Sailor, honey
Sailor snaps awake with a snort
Huh
Ever imagine what itd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast
Sometimes  think it would be the biggest thrill
My God, (looks around) it better be, darlin, cause itd be the last
What time is it
Shhhhh
Its four oclock
That womans laugh the other day had somethin to do with this feelin
Like bein ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe
Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one
Lulas left hand opens and spreads wide
Lula, sometimes  gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts
Anythin interestin in the world come out of somebodys weird thoughts, Sailor
You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like were seein these days
You got me, peanut
(smiles - turns to him) You certain
aint never met anyone come close to you, sugar
Recall the time we was sittin one night behind the Confederate soldier
Leanin against it
And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, You feel it beatin in there, Lula
Get used to it, cause it belongs to you now
Dyou recall that
do
was hopin you would
know that night by heart
Sometimes, honey
think its the best night of my life
: 86 Tight Two-Shot Lula and Sailor with their arms around each other - cheek to cheek - talking softly
strange presence begins to build and a piece of sad nostalgic music plays
: 87
-   - (lost in the memory) really do think its the best night of my life
We didnt do nothin special  can remember
Just talked, is all
Talkins good
Long as you got the other
Im a big believer in talkin, case you aint noticed
Too bad they dont give an award for talkin
Youd win first prize
Especially with those tits
You think so, baby
Does my talkin bother you, honey
No,  like gettin up around four a
m
and talkin bout wild animals Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream
kinda wish  didnt remember it
Up at Pee Dee,  couldnt remember any of my dreams
What was this one
It wasnt no fun, Lula
The wind was blowin super-hard and  wasnt dressed warm
Only instead of freezin,  was sweatin strong
: 87
of eyes
Black sweat is rolling down the forehead and over the eyes
(voice-over) The water was rollin off me
And was dirty, too, like  hadnt had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost
: 88
-   - Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay

You let me in only you werent real pleased to see me
You kept askin, Whyd you come to see me now
Why now

But it wasnt all like you were so unhappy  was there, just you were upset
My bein there was upsettin to you
You had some kids there, little kids, and  guess youd got married and your husband was comin home any minute
: 87A
of eyes
Black sweat is rolling down the forehead and over the eyes
(voice-over) tell you, Lula
was shakin wet
All this black sweat was pourin off me, and  knew  was scarin you, so  took off
: 89
-   - Lula puts her arms around him
Sometimes dreams just dont mean nothin
Stuff comes into your mind and you dont have no control over, you know
Anyways, dreams aint no odder than real life
Sometimes not by half
Well,  aint upset about it, darlin
Just give me an odd feelin there a minute, is all
Lula lifts her head and kisses Sailor under his left ear
She rolls over on top of Sailor
Take a bite of Lula
: 90

: : 91
-   - Lula waits just by the lobby door of the hotel
In the back of the lobby in the shadows is an ancient, old   who stares at her
Sailor pulls the -Bird up in front of the hotel and Lula hurries out to him and tosses their suitcase in the backseat
Lets get outta here
suddenly got a funny feelin about this place
Feelin all that voodoo
(winks at her) Gotta hex from a voodoo
(smiles) Who do

They laugh and take off around the corner and up past the Cafe Du Monde
Oh my God
Its Johnnie
Duck down
Get goin
(looking around frantically) Where
Never mind where
Get outta here

Sailor pulls the car up fast and hangs a right turn
: 92
- Johnnie smiles as he watches Sailor and Lula turn the corner
(to himself) Aint love wonderful
Whats that

Johnnie raises his cup of coffee to Sailor and Lula - who have long since disappeared
Good luck to you kids
: 93
-   - Sailor and Lula drive
You think he saw us
Who knows, baby
He was sittin there havin a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde
Do you think he saw us
Lula, darlin
Makes no difference anyway
Were outta here
We watch the car disappear up the street
Slowly the camera pans and Reggie and Drop Shadow come walking happily along the sidewalk - whistling
: 94 Lula and Sailor are motoring along
Sweetheart, keep your panties up
Were in Jimmy Swaggart country
Sailor and Lula both laugh
Up ahead, Sailor spots a hitchhiker
He slows to pick him up
Sure you wanna do this
Might be a way they could track us
Hes just a regular guyt needs help, honey
Look at him
The  is a man about thirty with a pack on his back, and he is carrying a large, covered cardboard box
He is filthy, with an uneven smile that exposes his jagged yellow teeth
Lula opens the door for him, and after he loads his stuff, Sailor takes off down the highway
Thanks a lot
been standin out there off and on for two hours, ha-ha
Since noon about, ha-ha
Cops catch ya hitchin on a Interstate around here they throw ya on a county road crew for a week, less you can pay the ticket, ha-ha
Which  aint got, ha-ha
My names Sailor, and this heres Lula
Whats yours
Marvin DeLoach
But everbody calls me Roach, ha-ha
Roach DeLoach, ha-ha
You always make that strange little funny laugh when you talk
Aint laughin, ha-ha
What you got in the box
My dogs, ha-ha
Roach slides the top off and tilts the box slightly toward the front
Inside are six small husky pups that are not more than two weeks old
Im headed to Alaska, ha-ha
These dogs is gonna be my sled team, ha-ha
(to Sailor) This guys crazy
Where you from, Roach
If you mean where  was born, it was Belzoni, Missippi, ha-ha
But been brought up in Baton Rouge
Why you goin to Alaska
And whered you get them puppies
They look sick
Roach stares down into the box at the baby huskies and strokes each of them twice with a religiously unwashed hand
The dogs whimper and lick his dirty fingers
saw this movie on , ha-ha
The Call of the Wild
aint never seen snow, ha-ha
got these dogs at the pound
Nobody wanted em, ha-ha
Everbody here got theirself pit bulls or some kinda hounds
Im gonna feed these boys good so theyll be big and powerful and they can pull me real fast through the snow, ha-ha
Roach pulls a piece of raw cows liver out of one of his pockets of his field jacket and begins ripping little bits off it and feeding them to the dogs
(screeches as she sees this) Sailor
Stop
Stop the car now
Sailor pulls off the road onto the shoulder of the highway and stops
Lula opens her door and jumps out
Im sorry, but  cant take this
Roach, or whatever your name is, you come out of there with them dogs this instant
Roach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box of tiny canines after him
Once he and his belongings are deposited on the roadside, Lula hops back in the car and slams the door
Im truly sorry
Im truly sorry, Roach
But aint gonna make it to Alaska
Least not any part of the way with us
Youd best find a party to take care of those dogs proper, before they all die
And, if you dont mind my sayin so
You could most certainly use some serious lookin after yourself, startin with a bath
Lula takes a pair of sunglasses off the dashboard and puts them on
Drive
Sailor takes off
You dont feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey
know youre thinkin that  got moren some of my mama in me
Well, couldnt help it
Sailor,  really couldnt
Im sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin hunk of awful-smellin meat out of his pocket
near barfed
And them poor diseased puppies
(laughs) Just part of life on the road, peanut
Do me a favor, Sailor
Dont pick up no more hitchers, okay
: 95
-  -   - / 95A
-   - Johnnie is seated in a telephone booth at the back of the bar
No, Marietta,  havent found em
This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindus lifetime to unfix
You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin dope up her arms
We see Reggie and Drop Shadow enter the bar
Reggies unsmiling eyes drift across the room until they see Johnnie in the booth
He stares coldly and waits
Drop Shadow adjusts his socks
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin around in your brain than Carter got pills
Try to take it easy
Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days
Im stayin right here by the phone until you find Lula, then Im comin to get her
You call soons you got somethin, even if its three in the a
m
will, Marietta
Goodbye now
Johnnie hangs up the phone and exits the booth
As he crosses the bar
(shouting) Hola
Senor Farragut
We meet again
Johnnie goes over to Reggie and Drop Shadow and shakes hands
thought you two were in Austin, Texas
Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts
We were
Now Mr
San Pedro Sula and are on our way back to Utila, in the morning
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us
Why not
How was the fishin
think they are too serious, these American fishermen
In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method
Reggie orders martinis for the three of them
So, its back to the islands
Yes
Mr
San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now
These people are friends of mine, so must return and find out what happened
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place
(laughs) It has its moments of uncertainty
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut
Call me Johnnie
has always been a good town to sit around in
can tell you are an intelligent man, Johnnie
One difference between your country and mine is that in the islands, it does not pay to reveal ones intelligence
Others may use what they perceive against us
Reggie raises his glass to Johnnies
Hasta siempre
Hasta siempre
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland
Hows that
Two Scotsmen were fighting over a penny
Johnnie finishes off his martini
gotta admit, you guys are (sliding off the stool) two in four dozen
The real joke is we never went fishing, but were still fishing
Johnnie squints his eyes thinking about this one
Reggie and Drop Shadow smile and stand to leave
: 96
-    - Lula and Sailor cruise the dark streets
wouldnt mind a little night life
How about you
Hard to tell whats shakin in a place like this, honey
You dont want to be walkin in the wrong door
Maybe theres a place we could hear some music
feel like dancin
We could ask someone
97
- Sailor spots a Red Devil gas station that still has its lights on and pulls the car over
Someone up here might know somethin
Two skinny, pimply-faced guys,  and , wearing dirty coveralls walk over to them
Gas
Got enough, thanks
Were lookin for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin - get somethin to eat, too
Anything like that around here
Cornbreads
They got western
No food, though, cept bar nibbles
Lula slides over in the front seat and leans across to Sailor
How about speed metal
The kids look worried and take a step back
Any kinda rocknroll, honey
Theres a boogie joint just about a mile straight out Lafitte here
But thats a black place mostly
Mostly black though in that boogie place
Whats the name of it
Club Zanzibar
You say its straight ahead a mile
About
Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway
State Road 86
Thanks
Sailor and Lula drive off
Buck and Billy go back inside the Red Devil station
Guess who is over the corner cleaning nuts and bolts with a toothbrush and gasoline
Its
: 98
- The Club Zanzibar sits in the darkness on the left hand side of the road
string of multi-colored lights is hung over the front
Sailor parks the Thunderbird across from the club and cuts the engine
You ready for this
Well find out in a hurry
: 99
- When they walk in, the  is playing a slow blues and are swaying on the dance floor
There are a dozen tables and a long bar in the room which is done up in a strange dark azquatic motif
Eight of the tables are occupied and     stand at the bar
Everyone in the place is black except for one   who is sitting alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking Pearl straight from the bottle
The atmosphere is not friendly, but Lula takes Sailor by the arm
Come on
They step up to the bar and order two Lone Star beers
The , a tall, heavyset man slowly forms his hand into the bird
He holds his hand that way while he speaks
This is a friendly place, son
You folks just relax and have a nice time
(bound and determined not to be intimidated) You got yourself a deal
(to Sailor) Thats a real jacket
By that, mean a real stupid jacket
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it represents a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom
Fuckin honky cracker mumbo jumbo
The bartender moves on down the bar
Lula and Sailor take a small table near the door
Ill be damned if Im leavin
That band is too good
Uh huh
You notice that woman when we come in
The white woman sittin by herself
Yeah
Well, she aint talked to nobody and aint nobody spoke to her that could tell
What you make of that
Honey, we bein strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we dont want to make nothin of nothin
You think shes pretty
Sailor looks at the woman
She lights a new cigarette off a butt, then squashes the butt in the ashtray
She is thirty years old, maybe more
Shoulder-length, bleached blonde hair, black at the roots
Clear skin, green eyes
Long, straight nose with a small bump on it
She is wearing a low-cut lavender dress that would have emphasized her breasts had she not been so flat-chested
Slender
tend to like em with a little more meat on the bones
Face aint bad, though
Lula gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle
Whats wrong, sweetheart
Somethin botherin you
Mama

Shes probly worried to death by now
Moren likely

That were okay
aint so sure its a great idea, but thats up to you
Just dont tell her where we are
(to Bartender) Pardon me
Yall got a phone here can use
Cant you read
(sees the sign - then to Sailor) Back in a bit
She kisses him on the nose and walks back through a dark little door to the payphone
: 100
-   - / 101
-  - Marietta answers the telephone on the second ring

Will you accept
Of course
Lula

Lula

Call me again soon
Ill be waitin by the phone
Dont be crazy, mama
Take care of yourself
Lula hangs up
Marietta hangs up and begins pacing the livingroom floor
: 102
- Sailor and the bleached blonde in the lavender dress are together on the dance floor
Lula sees them, goes over to the bar, picks up a beer bottle and throws it at Sailor
The bottle bounces hard off his back and clangs to the floor, bouncing but not breaking
Sailor turns around fast and looks at Lula
Everybody else in the place is still
103
- Lula runs out
Sailor follows
Sailor finds her sitting on the ground, leaning against the passenger side of the Thunderbird
Lulas eyes are red and wet but she isnt crying
Sailor kneels down next to her
was just wastin time, peanut, till you come back
Its me whos wastin time, Sailor, bein with you
Honey, Im sorry
It wasnt nothin
Come on and get up and well take off
Leave me be for a minute
Mama gets all insane and then  see you practicin your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp
How you figure Im gonna feel
Told you not to call your mama
Sailor stands and leans against the hood of the car until Lula gets up and climbs inside
He wraps his snakeskin jacket around her and starts the car
Lula kisses Sailor on the cheek, puts her head down sideways on his lap and goes to sleep
Sailor drives
: 104
-   - Marietta paces, but then goes back to the phone
She dials a number and gets an answering machine
Santos
If you get this message, call me right away
Its Marietta
dont know, Santos
Maybe this is all not
Call me
She hangs up
She dials another number
It answers
Johnnie
At last
thought you was never gonna come back to your room
: 105
-   -
106
-   - got some news, Marietta
Lula and Sailor been here
They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me
She knew you were in
, so they left the city
Did she tell you where she was callin from
No, but my guess is theyre headed west, so probly Texas
Their money must be runnin low
dont think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift
Howd she sound
Was she doin okay
Could she be doin okay, Johnnie
Shes tryin to prove somethin to me, thats all
Lula aint doin no moren showin off, defyin me

No, you wait right there for me
Ill be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven
Meet me at the airport
Ill meet you, Marietta, if thats what you want, but Im against it
Seven tomorrow evenin
Se can eat at Galatoires
Fix it
Marietta hangs up
: 107
-  - Sailor and Lula are in a Shell station just outside of Houston
Sailor is filling the Thunderbird with regular
An   sits near the pumps listening to the radio playing a sad big band tune
Lula starts to slowly snap her fingers to the beat and the old man gives her a beautiful smile
(smiling and snapping her fingers) How much we got left, honey
Under a hundred
You want to stick around here, Sailor
See if we can get some work
Not in Houston
Wed be better off in some place more out of the way
You want me to drive for a stretch
Give you a chance to rest
Thatd be good, Lula
Sailor kisses her and climbs into the back seat and lays down
Lula slides behind the wheel and lights up a More
She winks goodbye to the old man and wheels the car out towards the big beyond
: 108
- The reception gets bad on the big band tune and Lula starts turning the dial
Up comes a nationwide call-in talk show and she leaves it there
, the radio host talks to his callers
(with a gruff Brooklyn accent) Come in, Montgomery, Alabama
#1 (elderly sounding woman) Artie
That you, Artie
Yes, maam
Whats on your almost- perfect mind this evening
#1 How ya feelin, Artie
heard you wasnt doin too well recent
Im fine, thank you
had a cardiac infarction but Im on a new diet and exercising regularly
Ive never felt better
#1 Well, thats so good to hear, Artie
You know some of us depend on you down this way
Youre so entertainin and you get so many interestin guests
Thank you
Its listeners such as yourself who made me want to get up out of that hospital bed and back into the studio as fast as  could
(attacking the dial) Jesus
How could anyone listen to this crap
Lula takes a puff of her More and tosses it out the window and starts turning the radio dial - finds a news station
( ) live in exchange for sexual favors
Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February
The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn
These are really just children, he said, but theyve been exposed to a lot already
(lights another cigarette) Ill bet
In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said
: 108A crocodile suddenly breaks the surface of the water with a rotted human corpse clutched in its mighty jaws
(voice-over) The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles
: 109
-     - Damn
The Indian official who supplied this information did so only on condition of anonymity
The Uttar Pradesh state authorities last October released five hundred turtles
: 108B giant turtle breaks the surface of the water clutching a rotted human corpse in its mighty jaws
(voice-over) in the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation
: 110
-     - Sailor jumps awake in fright as Lula yanks the car off the road and brings it to a screeching halt in the middle of the desert
Whats that, peanut
cant take no more of this radio
(switches it off) aint never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin music right this minute
Sailor starts spinning the dial
(still crazed) The worlds gettin worse,  think, Sailor
And it dont sound like theres much we can do about it, neither
This aint news, sweetheart hate to tell ya
Suddenly Sailor finds a station -   - and he and Lula look at each other in disbelief
Sailor turns it up full blast and he and Lula dance hard until they disappear in the dust
: 111
-  -   - Marietta and Johnnie are standing at the registration desk - talking to the
Heres your key
Mr
Farraguts already taken care of everything
hope youll be comfortable, Mrs
Fortune
Youre in room 351 right down the hall from Mr
Farragut
The   steps in from a room behind the registration desk
have a phone call for you, Mrs
Fortune
at the phone by the fireplace
Please wait for it to ring
Marietta looks at Johnnie
She goes to the phone and picks it up when it rings
Yes
: 112
-   - Marcello Santos sits on the edge of his bed holding the telephone
got your message
But you went right to Johnnie, didnt you
cant trust you, bitch - not for one minute
Naughty girl
Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what
Theres no turning back
Im in a killing mood
No
My very best to Johnnie
Bless his soul
He hangs up the phone
: 113
-  -   - Johnnie enters as Marietta hangs up the phone - covering her fear
Who was that
Who knows your here
Ill be damned if that wasnt a wrong number
: 114
-   - Upstairs in a private dining room, Mr
Reindeer is dining with in formal evening attire
Behind him, a   and a are hard at work
Mr
Reindeer smiles and leans over very close to a beautiful  sitting to his left
Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet, eating her curds and whey
Along came a spider and sat down beside her, and extended his hand out to play
With this, he reaches under the table between her legs
She turns red and Mr
Reindeer laughs and lights a cigarette
Oh dear
Another Miss Dull Cunt
Reggie and Drop Shadow enter through a door on the other side of the room
Reggie catches Mr
Reindeers eye and smiles
Reggie reaches in his pocket and takes out a silver dollar - flips it in the air - catches it - and puts it back in his pocket
Mr
Reindeer smiles and waves him over to the table
He whispers something in Reggies ear - then gives him an envelope
When  gave you the silver dollar forgot to give you the contents of this envelope
They are to be returned
Show it just before the deed
Reggie pockets the envelope - joins Drop Shadow - and as they are leaving the dining room, they join a woman, , who looks half- Oriental, half-Cajun
She wears a strange, short, yellowish-bleached blonde wig
: 115
- They go downstairs together
At the bottom of the stairs, Reggie and Drop Shadow catch sight of Johnnie who is sitting in the back of the restaurant having dinner with Marietta
When Johnnie sees the two of them he waves, but at the same time gets a chill up his spine
What is it, Johnnie
Just some guys  met here keep seein em
(looks back at Marietta) Now tell me
Marietta continues to stare at Reggie, Drop Shadow, and Juana before turning back to Johnnie
She also feels the fear
Johnnie,  cant tell you, honey
Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight
Weve got to find them kids
Somethin was upsettin you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and  figured you wanted to tell me sos  could help

Honey,  have to ask you this

Youre lucky cause happen to love night drivin
Lets head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail
Did  tell ya its great to see ya again
This bout the fifth time
: 116
-    -   - Johnnie and Marietta climb together to the second floor and Johnnie takes Marietta to her room
(as she enters her room) Ill pack my things and meet you downstairs
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight
(pinching his cheek) You wont of missed much
See ya downstairs
: 116A
-   - Johnnie smiles and heads up to his room
He opens the door and steps inside
Johnnie is knocked in the head with a heavy metal pipe and he goes down hard
large dark figure grabs on to him and pulls him to an open window and lowers him into the back of a pick-up
The dark figure follows out the window
: 117
-  -   - Marietta is sitting in the lobby trying to hold herself together - half- sobbing
The  approaches and sits next to her
Im afraid his car is gone, Mrs
Fortune
dont understand this
dont understand this one bit
He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby
Somethin bad has happened -  jus know it
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer
Thats the last thing we need
buncha cops runnin around
The front desk clerk steps from behind his desk and hurries into the lobby
Im sorry
But  have overlooked this
Im truly sorry, maam
He hands Marietta a note inside an envelope which she opens and reads immediately
We see the note
Gone fishing with a friend - maybe buffalo hunting
Johnnie
Oh God
What does that mean
Im sure  wouldnt know, maam
and buffalo hunting too
hmmmmm
And jus when my babys out on some Texas road with a killer
The front door of the hotel opens and in walks Santos
He seems to know exactly where Marietta is and steps to the door of the sitting room off the lobby
He stands in the doorway and smiles at Marietta
(horrified whisper) Santos
Wheres --Johnnie
Shhhhhh
(to the manager and desk clerk) Thank you, gentlemen
Ill look after her now
The Manager and Desk Clerk bow to Marietta and Santos and go back through the lobby
Santos walks over to Marietta
Marietta stands
Santos

Hey

Youre my girl now
Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy
Come on, lets get outta here
Where we goin
Got word the kids are moving through Texas

Come on, lemme see a smile
Please Santos
Wheres Johnnie
: 118
-   - Light comes from one small dirty window
: 119
-   - Johnnie is tied to a small wooden straight-backed chair
His mouth is gagged and taped shut
His hair is caked with dry blood and one fresh tickle curls down his forehead to his eyes which are just now beginning to open and focus
Juana is finishing tying his left ankle to the chair leg
Johnnie moans and Juana brings her big, smiling face up in front of his
Johnnie, you take a good look at me, baby, cause you gonna hafta watch close to know when we do it to ya
Yall count when  touch the bottle - (she slaps Johnnie hard across the face) There  slap that mutha fucka face - pay attention fucka - otherwise we hafta work it all night
Too much fun for us - you see what mean
Now watch me how  touch a bottle and you count how many times
Juana steps two paces across the hut where two dirty old soda bottles sit - one in one corner perched on a dried tree trunk - the other in the opposite corner perched on an old fence post
Juana touches the left bottle (#1) once, and crosses and touches the right bottle (#2) once and comes back and touches Johnnies face
You see, Johnnie
toucha number one bottle once,  toucha number two bottle once, and  touch your face
This is a game we love to play get hot already

Reggie and Drop Shadow step out of the darkness behind Johnnie and come around to face him
Hey, Johnnie
Reggie - you remember Reggie, dont ya

Reggie and Juana kiss hot in front of Johnnie
Juana puts her face down in front of Johnnies again

Reggie reaches his hand around in front of Johnnie - showing him a
45 Automatic
Thats a Marine issue
It goes off somethin terrible - you wanna see
Drop Shadow pulls the hammer back which makes a loud click
You hear click
Johnnie jumps as Drop Shadow blows a big hole in the far wall in front of Johnnie
(laughs) Hell, its even worse than remember
Wait a minute
Reggie comes out in front of Johnnie - Juana grabs him
They kiss hot again
Okay, gimmee nother kiss, Reggie bfore  fuck ya right now

- Reggie reaches his hand around Johnnies face - tears off tape and gag - then opens his hand and shows Johnnie a cufflink with a particular design in turquoise, orange, and silver
forgot to show you this
The gentlemen that gave this to me said youd recognize it
Said he wanted itd be bout the last thing you ever saw in this life
(recognizing cufflink) Oh God

As her finger touches Johnnies face there is a loud
Johnnie moans and closes his eyes

Johnnie starts to scream and violently try to move out of his chair
Nine
(she moves out of the way) ,
We see a hole in the front of the barrel -
The opposite wall and bottles get covered with blood
Juana and Reggie race into each others arms and kiss right above Johnnies dead, bloodied head
: 120
-      - Lula and Sailor are driving through the dark desert
Sure is a big deal round here
Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin, Alamo Alamo
They aint forgettin about it in a hurry
Thats the thing bout memory
Some things you wish you could forget
Whats troublin you, sugar
You know, Lula,  never told you what all  was doin before  met you

The good side is  knew your daddy, and  thought Clyde was a good ol guy
You knew my daddy

The bad side of it is  did some drivin for a man named Marcello Santos
Oh shit

dont know what it is they all think  saw that night, but was just sittin out in the car till the whole place went up in flames
God, Sailor
Thats the night my daddy died

But while the place was burnin
Before Santos came out -  pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin
Afterwards
When  met you,  always liked to think  mighta saved your life

We all got a secret side, baby
Hope you dont think  been lyin to you bout other things, sugar
Howd you know my daddy

Lula, you there

You upset with me
No, Sailor darlin
Just shockin sometimes when things arent the way you thought they were
been carryin a secret too
: 121
- / / - The livingroom is on fire
The livingroom is on fire and we move upstairs - Lula races through the smoke-filled hallway to her mothers bedroom
The livingroom is on fire and Lula throws open the door to her mothers bedroom just in time to see Marcello Santos leaving through a window
Her mother laughs a wild, crazy laugh - exactly the same laugh Lula heard on the porch of the Cape Fear Hotel
(voice-over) That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin
saw mama up in her room with Santos
: 122
-      - They was laughin arm in arm like animals
didnt want to say it
but had a feelin Santos was up to somethin with your mama
(quietly) My mama
(after a pause - she smiles) So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined
They have, sugar
take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together
Its a comfortin idea
Well, were really out in the middle of it now, aint we
Theres worse places, honey
If you say so
Trust me on it
(turns to him) do trust you, Sailor
Like aint never trusted nobody before
(after a moment) Well be alright, peanut, long as weve got room to move
(looking into the highway) Whats that
dont know
Looks like clothes
Sailor starts to slow down
The highway is suddenly littered with clothes strewn everywhere and two open suitcases smashed near the side of the road
Sailor slows down to a crawl
He and Lula turn to each other - theyve just seen
One close to the side of the highway - and other just off in the desert brush
Off behind is an overturned car
Oh God, Sailor
One bad car accident
Coming out of the darkness is a  , her clothes half torn off - blood draining out of several deep wounds
Sailor, what are we gonna do
dont know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on  broke parole
They get out of the car and the girl comes toward them screaming
(completely gone in shock) Ive got about five hundred dollars in my wallet and  cant find it
My mothers going to kill me
Its got all my cards in it
It was in my pocket
Now my pockets gone
The girl starts walking back toward the car
Lets get ahold a her quick
You think shes gonna make it
Dont know, but shes gonna bleed all over our car, Ill tell ya that
(to Girl) Hey
Hello
Girl
You gotta come with us, honey
Sailor reaches out cautiously and takes hold of the girls arm
Shit,  got this damn sticky stuff in my hair
She keeps digging her fingers into a bloody wound in her head
Gotta find my wallet
(to Sailor) Dont you say one word of this to my mother
God, shes gonna kill me
The girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up
Sailor and Lula each take an arm and try to help her
Sailor and Lula help the girl stand, but her eyes start rolling back and a bunch of fresh blood comes gushing up out of her mouth
cant take this, Sailor
Shes dyin right in front of our eyes
Im afraid she is, baby
Sailor kneels down next to the girl and runs his hand gently across her forehead
(wide-eyed now) Get my lipstick
(whisper) Its in my purse
The girl dies
Sailor and Lula hold real still for a moment
Lula starts to cry
She died right in front of me
Whyd she have to go and do that, Sailor
Lets get outta here, honey
Before getting up, Sailor lets his hand come off the girls forehead down over her eyes - closing them
He puts his hand on her cheek then gets up
He puts his arm around Lula and they go back to her car
Sailor helps Lula in on her side and closes the door for her
He goes around, gets in and looks over at Lula, who breaks down crying harder
Sailor starts the car and takes off
: : 123
-   - The Thunderbird drives past a large stucco fish on a rock stand which has a sign on it that says  ,
Sailor cruises the -Bird along the main street of Big Tuna, eye-balling the place
Well, it aint exactly Emerald City
Not quite as bad as the weather though
It must be a hundred and ten and it aint even noon yet
123A
- Sailor pulls the car up in front of the Iguana Motel
Thisll do
: 124
- The room is simple: double bed, dresser, mirror, chair, sink, toilet, bathtub (no shower), electric fan, window overlooking the street
Not bad for eleven dollars a day
No radio or
She strips off the spread, tosses it in a corner and sits down on the bed
And no
Fan works
Now what
Lets get a sandwich and find out about some work
Sailor
Yeah
This aint exactly my most thrillin notion of startin a new life
They stare at each other
Lula suddenly feels sick to her stomach and slumps down on the edge of the bed
Im gonna stay here in this room, Sailor
dont feel so good
This heat makes me tired
Okay, honey, Ill see you later

- tall, skinny man, , in his early thirties with wild, uncombed hair the color of pomegranate, walks out of the garage
You Red
(with a smile) Well,  aint Blackie
Sailor holds out his right hand to shake
Names Sailor Ripley
Katy over at the drugstore thought you might have some work  could do
Red extends his oil-blackened right hand and shakes
Things aint real hot right now
Rex, there though, (nodding toward a half-naked man burrowed under an 83 Buick) is about to relocate in about a week to San Angelo
might could use a man when he does
You good with engines
aint no Enzo Ferrari, but they used to call me Wrench when  was a kid
Well see how she goes then when Rex takes off
Check back
Two men,  and , both about forty, walk up to Red
One of them wears a grey baseball cap with a Confederate flag on it and the other has an  straw Stetson
Hows it look
Reckon the heads cracked, like thought
Shit, thats what  was afraid of
Ill get you foreigners a beer
(to Sailor) Im Buddy, and this heres Sparky
Sailor introduces himself to Sparky and Buddy and Rex
They all shake hands or nod and move out of the sun to drink their beers
My girl and  are lookin for a place to settle

So are we

Fix-It at the Iguana
His truck broke down here a couple of months ago
Escaped con
Man got some serious prison tattoos
Everbody got a past
Just some got more future in em than others
That aint no lie
Sailor finishes his beer, stands it on the ground and steps on it, crushing it flat
Been nice meetin yall
Preciate the beer
Ill be seein yall soon
Very soon
One thing about bein in Big Tuna: you dont have much choice about who you see and who you dont
: 126
- The temperature on the tower reads One Hundred Twelve
: 127
- In front of the door there is a large, damp spot on the rug where about a hundred and fifty flies are buzzing and landing
Sailor sees this when he opens the door
He steps across the large spot and finds Lula just waking up on the bed
That you, Sail, honey
The only one
Lula opens her eyes and looks at him
You find any work
Maybe
Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week
Met a few hard luck boys whos stayin here
Whats that smell

Tried to make it to the bathroom
Turned out it was the wrong door anyways

You sick

Darlin
Yeah

Sailor goes over and sits on the bed
dont know that this is the right place for us
Sailor strokes Lulas head
It aint gonna be forever, peanut
Lula closes her eyes
know, Sailor
Nothin is
: 128
- The darkening evening sky is filled with flying monkeys
: 129
-  - Sailor, Lula, Sparky, and Buddy are sitting in the courtyard of the motel sharing Sparkys fifth of Ezra Brooks
An electric bug killer is working overtime
Buddy is reading from a newspaper
(reading from paper) Robert Brenton, twenty-five, was killed when his car went off the road on State Highway 118, according to the Department of Public Safety
Brenton and two passengers, William Reese and Susan Day, were thrown from the automobile, reports said
Sailor looks at Lula
Susan Day
The assistant manager,  , speaks from the shadows behind the group
Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck
That stupid shit
That fuckin Bob was so fuckin dumb
He deserved to die
That asshole
They all look over at Tommy
Hey, Tommy

Them are makin a pornographic movie
Texas style
Why
You wanna join in
How do you get sixteen Haitians into a Dixie Cup
How
Tell em it floats
Sparkys big on Florida jokes
You need a active sense of humor to survive in the Big Tuna
walks in and comes over
Hey, everybody
Sailor, Lula, this heres the man himself
Bobby, this is Sailor and Lula, the most recent strandees, economic variety
Bobby nods to Lula and offers a hand to Sailor
Bobby Peru, just like the country
Sparky and Buddy laugh
Accordin to Red and Rex, Bobbys the most excitin item to hit Big Tuna since the 86 cyclone sheared the roof off the high school
Only in town two months and there aint a young thing around dont know how that cobra tattoo works, right, Bob
Bobby laughs
He has a lopsided grin that exposes only three brownish front teeth and he has flat black eyes that seem to reflect no light
You from Texas, Mr
Peru
Bobby pulls up a chair and pours himself a shotglass full of whiskey
Im from all over
(noticing a  tattoo on Bobbys right hand) You was in the Marines, huh
Bobby looks down at his hand, flexs it
Four years
Bobby was at Cao Ben
Whats Cao Ben
(to Lula) How old are you
Twenty
Lotta women and kids and old people died at Cao Ben
March, 1968
We torched a village and the government made a big deal out of it
Bobby sips the whiskey and closes his eyes for several seconds before reopening them and looking at Buddy
His eyes open slowly and they practically burn a hole in Buddy
(to Buddy) You was on a ship, pardner
Hard to make contact with the people when youre off floatin in the Gulf of Tonkin
(changing the subject) Hey Bobby, have yourself another glass a Jack
Sparky refills Bobbys shotglass
Bobby tosses it back in one gulp
Dont mind if  fuckin do
Speakin a Jack
One-eyed Jacks yearnin to go a peepin in a seafood store
Good meetin you
Adios, boys
He walks out and after hes gone
Somethin in that man scares me
No shit
(pouring himself another shot) Bobbys got a way
Cant shake that institution odor
Lula puts a hand on Sailors leg
Darlin,  still aint feelin so well
Im goin to bed
Ill come along
They say goodnight to Sparky and Buddy and head for their room
: 130
-     - Man, that barf smell dont fade fast
Lula goes right to the bed and flops down on it
Anything  can do for you
No,  dont think so, Sail just need to lie down
Lula listens to Sailor brush his teeth, urinate into the toilet and flush it
Sailor comes out of the bathroom and climbs into bed
Sailor
You know what
know you aint particularly pleased bein here
Not that
Look at what  wrote down cause  cant say it
Lula hands Sailor a note which reads Im pregnant
Sailor looks into her eyes
Its okay by me, peanut
Well, nothin personal, but  aint sure its okay by me
Sailor crumples the note and puts it in the ashtray
Really, Sailor, it aint nothin against you
love you
Love you, too
know
Just Im sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin, and this dont help soothe me
know this aint easy, Lula, but aint gonna let things get no worse,  promise
of Lula setting fire to the pregnant note in the ashtray
: 131
-     - of flies on vomit stain
There is a knock on the door which wakes Lula from her nap
She opens the door
Bobby Peru stands outside
Hey, pretty woman
Sailor here
No, hes out changin the oil in the car
Man,  gotta take a piss bad
Can use your head there
Well
Yeah - okay

Just piss in the toilet
Yall take a listen - here a deep sound comin down from Bobby Peru
Bobby enters the bathroom and starts to urinate
: 132
- Sailor pulls the -Bird up front and hurries up to the screen door
Flies are buzzing all around
comes forward out of the darkness inside
(recognizing him) Oh

Hopin you could tell me if theres a contract out on me

You heard right
You really are one dumb asshole
Life is unpredictable
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy
(Sailor doesnt answer - Perdita smiles) Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin the shit himself
(Sailor doesnt answer) Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to

Yeah
But  did
And  told you all about it
Is there a contract
We made a deal once that wed tip each other off if we ever heard

Sailor goes back to his car and takes off
: 133
-     - Bobby is pacing around the room
Hey

Huh

Bobby Peru doesnt come up for air

Bunny jump fast - you jump back slow
Mean somethin, dont it
Means somethin to me
Means you want Bobby Peru
You want Bobby Peru to fuck you hard baby - open you up like a Christmas present
Suddenly Bobby jumps back, shakes his head and straightens his hair
Hey

and apologize
Hell

Sure sign of modern times
Next thing ya know, his old handll start crawlin around where it oughtnt to go
Ill be real honest with ya
Id like to fuck you and tear you open like a paycheck envelope
Will you be honest with me - would you like me to do it
Just a simple yes or no
He steps a little closer to her
Just feel me breathin on you
And youll know  mean business when it comes to fuckin
With all the strength she can muster, Lula slaps Bobby across the face
Bobby grabs on to her hard
Bobby Peru grab you now
Hold you tight
Feel everythin in you now
Stay quiet
Say fuck me and then Ill leave
(struggling) No way
Say it ,
Say fuck me soft - then Ill leave
Say fuck me
Whisper it

Say it
Say it -  Say it -  Say it
Bobby moves in very close to her - Lulas trembling
Bobby puts his hand on her neck and moves it up and down behind her ear
Say it
Then Ill leave
Whisper it
Whisper it
Whisper it
Whisper fuck me
His hand moves down over her breasts - down across her stomach - and down
Lulas left hand opens and spreads wide
Whisper it
Whisper fuck me
Whisper
Whisper
Whisper
Whisper
(whispers) Fuck me
Someday honey,  will
But have to be goin now

Bobby leaves smiling and slams the door
Lula stands trembling clicking her heels together
(whispers) Sailor
: 134
- Sailor is just about finished changing the oil in the Thunderbird when Bobby Peru pulls up in the maroon Eldo
Need a hand
Thanks, Bobby, bout done
Sailor throws some stuff in the trunk and closes the lid
How bout a beer
Thatd be fine, Bobby
Lets go by Rosaritas
You been there yet
No, havent heard of it
Thought maybe Sparky and Buddyd taken ya
Come on, Ill drive
134A
-   - They get into the Cadillac and Bobby takes off down Big Tunas main drag

The sisters been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while shes gone
Wheres that pretty little lady of yours today
Restin in our room
She aint been feelin well
Sorry to hear it

: 135
- Bobby parks the Eldo in among half a dozen pick-up trucks
Used to be this was a Mobil
Man converted it into a private club and named it after his wife
She left him and he shot himself
The wife owns it now
: 136
- They enter a long, dark room where a  , most of them wearing cowboy hats, sit on stools at a bar drinking beer out of frosted mugs
No hard liquor here
Just beer
They claim two stools
Couple Stars, Jimmy
The  brings over two bottle and two mugs - then walks back to the other end of the bar
Thought you said this was a private club
How come Im allowed in without bein a member
You black

You an indian
No
Then youre a member
Three or four millionaires in here right now
(looking around) They look like a bunch of good ol boys to me

Oil, gas, cattle, farmin
Aint nobody shows off around here
Iguana Countys one of the richest in Texas
Wouldnta guessed it, thats sure
Ready for another
Why not
: Bobby returns from the jukebox and sits down next to Sailor
-7, three times
Pee Wee Kings Waltz of Regret, my favorite tune
Pee Wees steel guitar ripples through the cigarette haze and buzzes around Sailors head
His reflection wobbles in the long mirror behind the bar
been studyin a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it
Whats that
Feed store keeps up to five  in their safe
Need me a good boy for back-up
Even split
You interested
Sailor stares at Bobby and works hard to focus his eyes
No
dont think so, man
Be easy, Sailor
Theres two employees
take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the othern covered
You aint plannin on raisin a famly in Big Tuna, are ya
(on the alert) Whattaya mean family
(smiling) Well

(a tinge of jealousy/fear) Lula tell you shes pregnant
Bobby grins, showing those three brown teeth
Couple grand or mored give you two a leg up
Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans got it figured good, Sailor
When did you talk to Lula
Talked to her this afternoon
While you was out
She really say she was pregnant
(smiles - puts a hand on Sailors shoulder) Just took a guess is all
You in or out on this deal

Dont think about it too long
(nods toward Sailors mug) You had enough
(finishing his beer) Have now
Come on outside,  got somethin to show ya
136A
-  / Bobby looks around in the purple twilight before he opens the trunk of the Eldorado
He peels back a brown army blanket
Thats a double-barreled, sawed-off, Ithaca shotgun with a carved pistol grip stock wrapped with adhesive tape
Next to its a cold Smith and Wesson 32 handgun with a six inch barrel
Thesell do er
Loosen up that five grand
Two and a half for you and the little lady
Bobby closes the trunk
Sailor stands - hesitating to commit
How much money you have between the two aya right now
Forty bucks
This is easy money, pardner
No ones gonna get hurt in this thing
And  dont think you can afford not to take it
Ill be bringin the Eldo round the front of the motel at ten tomorrow mornin
If you aint a pussy - youll be there
Sailor stares at him and his fist clenches
dont particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby
Hey
never said you was a pussy
Always figured you had the big ol round balls for this kinda thing
Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good
Yeah
yeah
guess so
That kinda moneyd get us a long way down that yellow brick road
Bobby cocks his head and squints at him questioningly
But  man
This better go smooth
Like takin candy from a fuckin baby
: 137
-     - Sailor bends over the bed and kisses Lulas hair above her left ear
You been drinkin, huh
Few beers is all
Feelin any better
Lula rolls onto her back
Cant tell yet
Whered you go
That smells still fillin this room good
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier
(looks right into her eyes) And Bobby too,  hear
(cant look at him) Yeah
He was lookin for you
You talk to im some
Some
Sparky said Reds promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend
Oughta make em happy
So whered you say you was
(cant look at her) Went with Bobby
Sailor sits on the bed and starts undressing
Sail
Uh huh
Lets leave here
Were goin to, Lula, real soon
mean tomorrow
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart
Thatd get us to El Paso
Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna
Sailor gets into bed
You shouldnt be smokin if youre pregnant
Aint smart
Lula sticks a More between her lips and lights it
She takes a deep drag, blows out the smoke, and stares at Sailor
Who says Im smart
You up to somethin with Bobby Peru, Sailor
What could  be up to, Lula
Hes a stone fuckin criminal, honey, and you aint
killed Bob Ray Lemon, didnt
That was a accident
bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too
That was in Vietnam
Hes the kind liked it
Lula,  got to get some sleep
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben
What
Was a massacre
Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped em in a trench
Bobby Peru probly killed the most
Lula, he mighta did,  dont know
But it dont matter now
Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it aint their fault
Lula puffs hard on her cigarette
sure enjoy smokin, Sailor hate that its bad for you
Sailor turns on his side, away from Lula, and pulls a pillow over his head
That mans a black angel, Sailor
You hook up with him, youll regret it
If you live to
Thanks, darlin,  know you got my best interest in mind, and preciate it sincerely
love you, but  gotta sleep now
Lula lights a second More off the first one and stubs out the butt on the dresser top
This whole worlds wild at heart and weird on top
Lula turns over, away from Sailor
(softly) wish you really, truly loved me
wish youd sing me Love Me Tender wish  was somewhere over that rainbow
Shit
Shit, shit, shit
of Sailors eyes - he remembers
: 138
-  - Sailor and Lula are walking down the carpeted stairs when Sailor is called by   , who is coming down towards them fast
Marietta stands at the top - watching
Hey Sailor
Wait a minute got somethin for ya
As Bob Ray passes Lula on the stairs - he puts his hand between her legs
Sailor starts to see red
Bob Ray smiles and steps down to Sailor
He leans in and whispers in Sailors ear
Shit, man
Marietta says you been tryin to fuck her in the toilets for the past ten minutes
You crazy fuckin bad boy tryin to fuck your girls mama
How do you think that cute little cunt Lula would feel about that
Hey, take a look at this
(shows Sailor one thousand dollars in cash) Marietta just gave me this to kill you right now, and afterward she said Lula was mine to fuck all the way into next Sunday
Bob Ray pulls a knife, but Sailors fist is already halfway through Bob Rays brain
From there, Sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone
Amidst blood-curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of , Sailor starts taking Bob Ray apart limb by limb and doesnt stop until Bob Ray lays completely destroyed and completely dead at the foot of the stairs
The crowd of formally dressed onlookers stand aghast
Sailor stares up at Marietta
Both their eyes burning with hate
: 139
-     - Sailor is dripping with sweat
His teeth are clenched tight and his fists violently grip the sheets, as if any minute he could tear the bed apart
: 140
- Bobby lets the screen door bang shut behind him as he comes in and roams around the livingroom
Nice of you to drop by
Told ya  would
You still riled
(laughs) You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass
Bobby keeps circling
Aint never had no girl pull a blade on me
Wish Id fuckin cut you up good
You heard from Reggie
Juana called
Theyre stayin another week
Bobby stops walking and stares at the photograph on the wall
Stayin a few extra days in the big , huh
This you
Perdita turns her head and looks, then turns back
Yes
We see the photo now
In it are Perdita along with her sister, Juana, and her husband, Reggie, whom we recognize as the killers of Johnnie
Dont look like you
Bobby turns around and leans down and puts his face next to Perditas from behind
The cobras waitin to strike, chica
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon
Asked me if there was a contract out on im
(laughs out loud) No shit
You know him
Used to
Whatd you say
No, of course
Bobby takes out a silver dollar and flips it into the air
It lands tails up in his hand
He pockets it
Thats right
Could have a bad accident, though
before
durin
or after a hold-up
Whats gonna happen when he sees me drivin the car tomorrow
Maybe hell get a little nervous, but who gives a shit
Bobby lowers his hands into the front of Perditas blouse and cups her breasts
She burns the back of his left wrist with her cigarette
Bobby jumps back, then grabs Perditas hair and pulls her over the couch onto the floor
Neither of them speak
She tries to stand, but Bobby keeps his right foot on her chest while he blows the back of his wounded wrist
Perdita shoves his leg to one side and rolls away
She stand up and spits at him
(grinning) knew we could be friends again
: 141
- Lula lays very still on the bed
Her head is close to the small turquoise radio on the bedside table
She is listening to a piece of sad, nostalgic music and as we move in closer to her and the radio - the volume increases
Lula remembers some moments in her life with Sailor: (Music continues over) When he kissed her outside the jail gate
When he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail
When they sat behind the Confederate Soldier
When they danced to Slaughter House
Suddenly, Lula sees an image in her mind that she does not recognize
She sees an abstract image of reflected light with two eyes looking through it at her
The image puzzles her
(The Music continues over) : 142
- The big Eldorado pulls up in front of the Iguana Motel where Sailor has been waiting in the hot sun
Bobby opens the door
Jump in back
Sailor crawls in the back seat and sees Perdita just as she floors it and they take off in a cloud of dust
142A
-   - Whats she doin here
Shes my girl
Shes drivin
That bother you
Why should it
Thats right
Take one of these
What is it
Panty hose
Work bettern stockins
Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head
You get the pistol
(hands him the
32) Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it
Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, theyll know we aint foolin with em
Comin up on it now, Bobby
: 143
- Bobby slips the panty hose over his head and adjusts it
His face looks crooked and distorted
(frightening whisper) Come on
Get that mask on
Sailor rips open the package and pulls a nylon leg over his head, stretching the calf part to fit
Perdita pulls up in front of the store
The street is deserted
Keep it revved, Chiquita
We wont be long
Just goin in to get our five grand
: 144
-   - Bobby and Sailor enter the feed store
Bobby raises his sawed-off shotgun and points it at the    behind the counter
Into the back room, both of you, Bobby and the two men head down the hall into the back room
(calling back to Sailor) If anyone comes in, herd em back here quick
: 145
- Suddenly, an Iguana County   cruises up in a patrol car and parks it on angle in front of the idling Eldo
The Deputy gets out of his car and walks over to the drivers side of the Eldorado
Waitin for somebody, Miss
Mi esposo
Hes in the feed store picking up some supplies
Youd best be careful of that cigarette, Maam
Its about to burn down between your fingers
Perdita stubs out her Marlboro in the ashtray
Gracias, officer
: 146
-   - The two old guys have their hands in the air and are moving back behind the counter
Bobby is just finishing tying off a bag of money
Sailor is by the front door holding his pistol on the two old guys
When Bobby finishes tying the money bag - he lifts the shotgun and blows a hole through the chest of one of the old men
Sailor goes into shock
,
: 147
- Reacting to the shot, Perdita jams the gear shift into reverse and peels out, knocking the deputy down
: 148
-   - Sailor turns his pistol on Bobby now
Bobby spins his shotgun around and points it at Sailor
Youre next, fucker
The second old man is reaching under the counter
Sailor fires his
32 at Bobby
There are no live bullets in his pistol
It just makes a dry click
Bobby smiles and is just about to kill Sailor when out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of the second old man bringing out a big shotgun of his own
Bobby instinctively spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the old gentleman
As Bobby is reloading fast, Sailor sprints through the front door
Bobby is right behind him as he flys out the front door
148A
- The deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped in both hands
He fires his first shot into Bobbys thigh and his second into Bobbys left hip
The shock of the initial slug causes Bobby to drop the bag
The impact of the second forces Bobbys right hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under his chin
The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the on the plate glass window of the feed store
Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls
He puts his hand over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy orders him to stand up
: 149
- Lula is sitting on a bench in the waiting room of the Iguana County Courthouse Building when Marietta and Santos walk in
As soon as she sees Lula, Marietta runs over, sits down next to her and hugs and kisses her
Oh baby,  was beginnin to think was never gonna see you again
Tears are pouring down Mariettas cheeks
She holds Lula to her and Lula does not resist
Lula just stares at Santos
Youre comin home, precious
Santos gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport
Mama, Sailors in deep trouble here
just cant leave him
Marietta takes Lula by the shoulders and looks straight at her
Lulas eyes are bloodshot, her hair is greasy and stringy, and her cheeks are pale
Oh, yes, you can
Santos steps forward
Lula begins to tremble
Your mamas been real worried bout you, honey
Me too
Can you give your old friend Santos a hug, too
Santos arms begin to go around Lula
Lula lets out a blood-curdling scream and shakes like a leaf on a tree
Santos grabs her hard - in a bear hug
On one shirt cuff we see a cufflink which is turquoise, orange, and silver
: 150
- Sailor lays on his jail bed reading a letter from Lula
(voice-over) Dearest Sailor Darling, The first thing youll want to know is Im keeping the baby
Mama wasnt for it in the beginning but  think shes looking forward to it
Im gonna name it Pace no matter if its a boy or a girl
Pace Ripley sounds good, dont it
Its kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old when you get out
feel like Im kind of in prison too, but  know in six months, itll be over and Ill have a son or daughter to show for it
Our child
love you Sailor
dont know how much or what it means though  miss you an awful bunch sometimes  know youre thinking about me cause  can feel it
miss you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever called me that
Mama married Santos
It just about drove me crazy
My daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyre spending it like there is no tomorrow
Im going to move out as soon as  can
Mama and Santos said because of the baby theyre lookin at the two of us in a different light - whatever that means
Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared
No one knows where
miss him, but not near as much as  miss you
Time dont really fly honey does it
Love, your Lula miss dancing
: 151
- Lula sits in her bedroom reading a letter from Sailor
(voice-over) Dear Lula, It is fine with me about the baby as you already know
And Pace being your family name and all is just right
What about a middle name if it is a boy after my granddaddy Roscoe
He would be proud  know though he is long passed
Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound so bad do you think
This place is not so pretty as Pee Dee
Not pretty at all
There are boys inside these walls meaner than Peru you can bet
There is a Death House am getting along
The only thing is not thinking about the future
miss dancing with you, too
love you
It is hard to end this letter
If  stop writing youre gone
There is not a lot more to say though
Vava con dios mi amor
Sailor : : 152
- / 153
-  - (  ) Six years later
Lula stands in the living room holding a glass of ice water while talking on the telephone to her mother
Marietta is wearing a giant diamond ring on one hand and the other hand is holding a Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth
Marietta is slumped over in an ottoman with wheels and is pushing her drunken self around the livingroom as she talks on the phone
Im goin, mama
No way  cant go
You aint takin Pace, though
Course  am, mama
(sighs) What times Sailors train get in
Six
Got any plans
Figure well go have supper someplace
Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline
Sailor always liked that Havana Browns Pig Pickin
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula
Sailor aint a boy no more, mama
Dont mean him
Its Pace concerns me
Really, mama,  gotta go
What if  asked you not to
Wouldnt make any difference
What if  told you not to
(forcefully) Mama
if you get in the way of me and Sailors happiness, Ill fuckin pull your arms out by the roots
Lula hangs up and throws her glass of water at a picture of her mother - draining it
: 154
- is a shy, polite, innocent six-year old who wears a long-billed fishing cap and pants with suspenders
Howll we know what he looks like
Lula makes a wide left turn onto Jeff Davis Highway without signaling, causing the driver of a white Bonneville headed across the intersection to jam on his brakes in order to avoid a collision
The Bonneville driver sits on his horn and shouts at Lula
Mama, you almost crashed us
Lula steadies the steering wheel of her Camaro with her left elbow while she strikes a match and lights up a More
She throws the match out the window and takes possession of the wheel with both hands, the cigarette is clamped in her teeth
Dont give me no trouble now, Pace, please
This aint the easiest day in a long time
And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like
You seen his photo
Howll he know what we look like
He seen our photo
Lula puffs furiously several times on her More before she takes it out of her mouth and drops it
Damn it, child
Now look what you made me do
What  made you do, mama
Lula feels around on the floor with one hand until she finds the cigarette
Sirens can be heard up ahead
Nothin, honey
(stubbing it out in the ashtray) Mamas just actin strange
You aint actin, mama
Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, aint you got one cute mouth tonight
They pass an automobile accident where a man has been thrown into the curb - his head broken open and bleeding
The ambulance is just arriving
Lula looks away
: 155
- in a wheelchair is wheel up to the accident victim, who is bleeding profusely and in a state of shock
The man in the wheelchair stares at him for a moment
Hey man
Same fuckin thing happened to me last year
: 156
- Pace looks up at his mother
still aint sure what my daddy looks like
Like you, sweetheart
You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose
Only difference is your color hair is like mine
My daddy aint never killed nobody, has he, mama
Course he aint never killed nobody
Whyd you say that, Pace
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin
And
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man
Wrong, baby
Your daddy never committed no murder
Musta been you didnt hear grandmama proper
He made some mistakes, is all
Your daddy aint always been so lucky
Were almost at the depot, honey
Sit back a minute
: 157
- Lula pulls the Camaro into in the station parking lot and kills the engine
Why we sittin here, mama
Thinkin a second, baby
Lula gets out and goes around for Pace
They hold hands as they walk toward the station
The big clock on the side of the building shows ten minutes past six
Im scared, mama
Why, honey
Case daddy dont like me
What if he dont like that  dont got his color hair
Pace, your daddyd love you even if you didnt have no hair at all
: 158
- Lula sees Sailor as soon as she opens the door
He is sitting in an orange plastic chair against the opposite wall, smoking a cigarette
Still partial to Camels, huh
Sailor smiles
First pack of tailor-mades  had in a while
He stands up and looks down at Pace, who is still holding hands with Lula
Sailor puts out his right hand
You must be my son
Shake hands with your daddy
Pace releases Lulas hand and puts his own in Sailors
Sailor grips it gently but firmly, pumps once, then lets go
Pleasure to meet you, Pace
read a lot about you
Sailor looks at Lula
Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them loose
Sailor tries to smile
You hungry
Pace and  aint had dinner yet
Lead the way
Sailor picks up his black metal suitcase and follows them to the car
: 159
- Lula drives
No rag top, huh
Lula starts to reply, then stops
She stares straight ahead, gripping the wheel hard
Suddenly, she pulls over to the side of the road, turns off the engine and gets out of the car
Whats wrong, mama
(turning to Pace and patting his head) Dont worry, son
Just stay here
Sailor gets out and goes over to Lula, who is leaning back against the hood
Im sorry, Sailor
just cant help it
Give me a minute and Ill quit
Boys frightened, Lula
This aint no good
Really, Sail, Ill be okay
Its a mistake, honey
You two go on
Ill walk back to the depot
Whatre you talkin about
Thats your son in there
He aint never known me, Lula, so there aint much for him to forget
Not seein each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too
How can you say that, Sailor
What makes sense, is all
Sailor goes around to the drivers side, reaches in and pulls the keys out of the ignition
He unlocks the trunk, removes his suitcase, and closes the lid
Dont do this, Sailor, please
Sailor slips the keys in her shirt pocket and leans his head into the car
(to Pace) Oiga, amigo
If ever somethin dont feel right to you, remember what Pancho said to The Cisco Kid
Lets went, before we are dancing at the end of a rope, without music
Sailor stands up and looks at Lula
Her eye makeup runs in dark streaks down her face
of Lulas eyes
Her eye makeup runs like black sweat over eyes and down her cheeks as in Sailors dream
You been doin fine without me, peanut
There aint no need to make life toughern it has to be
He picks up his suitcase, kisses Lula lightly on the lips and walks away
She lets him go
: 160
-  / Sailor walks down the street pretending hard not to care
: 161
-  / Lula climbs in behind the wheel - sobbing
Pace sits sadly, staring out the window
: 162
-  / Sailor continues walking down the street on  appear and come towards Sailor
They circle around him, coming in closer for the kill
What do you faggots want
Thats all it takes
The gang is on him
Sailor tries to defend himself, but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out
Blood begins to pour from his swelling nose
162A
-  / - a bright light illuminates it
In the sky above Sailor, a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful Good Witch of the North comes floating down above him
Sailor Ripley
Sailors eyes suddenly see the Good Witch through his closed eyelids
His mouth speaks through closed lips
The Good Witch
Sailor
Lula loves you
But Im a robber and a manslaughterer and  havent had any parental guidance
Shes forgiven you of all these things You love her
Dont be afraid, Sailor
But Im wild at heart
If you are truly wild at heart, youll fight for your dreams
Dont turn away from love, Sailor
Dont turn away from love
Dont turn away from love
The Good Witch disappears
162
-  / Sailor opens his eyes and drags himself and his giant swollen nose up on his feet
The gang still stands around him
You had enough, asshole
Yes,  have
And  wanna apologize to you gentlemen for referring to you as homosexuals
also want to thank you fellas, youve taught me a valuable lesson in life
(lifts his head high) Sailor turns around and starts running back
The gang watches him go
: 163
-  / Lula sits in the car in the middle of a giant traffic jam
She is still crying and horns are honking all around them
: 164
-  / Sailor runs up the street, holding his nose and
He rounds a corner and spots her in the middle of a sea of cars
He starts running towards her - leaping from one car to another until he jumps on the hood of Lulas car
She sees him
Lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms
Behind them is a giant golden sunset
As they embrace - the sound of the horns goes away
Lulas gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield
It is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna, but now she knows what it is
It is Paces happy, smiling eyes looking up at the two of them in love
Sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into Lulas eyes and sings Love Me Tender
The people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a feeling of love and happiness in their hearts
