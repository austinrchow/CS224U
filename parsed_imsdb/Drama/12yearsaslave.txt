/ -  1 - , 1841- We are close on a     as they open the hands stringing a
It's not a high end piece, but it is quite nice
a wide shot of the study
Sitting in a chair with violin in hand is  ; a man in his late twenties
Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner, is distinguished
But he, too, seems a hardy individual
Someone who has known manual labor in his time
Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing the strings, their tuning
Satisfied, Solomon begins to play vigorously
As he does, we make a   : /  - We come in on a lively affair
dinner party is being thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house
In attendance are
All are  and all are , in their early twenties
The men and women are dressed in very fine attire
We should get the sense that for the most part they are people of means
The furniture has been set aside in the living room
At the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon, having cut directly from the tune he was previously playing
He plays with a light determination, and in no way seems possessed with empty servitude
Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal thanks and congratulations from all
It should be clear that despite their respective races there is much admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities
/ - It is a Saturday morning
Clad in her finest attire is ; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he
We see also the Northup children:  who is eight, and who is five
They are handsome, and well groomed kids
Anne straightens up the children
She finishes, () 2
3 : 3 she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if preparing to pose for a portrait
They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer
He stands and looks admiringly at his family stressed
It isn't that he doesn't have love for them, he does as well
But in the moment, he truly admires his greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and well and provided for
He goes to his children, and hands each a coin, then goes to Anne
Gives her a kiss on the cheek
The children giggle at the sight
- Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets and groves of Saratoga
The streets are well populated this morning with many people out strolling
Most are , but there are as well
They are   who mingle fairly easily - though not always completely - with the whites
We see, too, a few   who travel with their These pairings are largely from the south and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are not physically downtrodden, not field hands
They are well dressed and "leading apparently an easy life" - comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters
As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart traffic
Solomon and his children easily jump across the muck
Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for Solomon to help her across
Solomon
Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile waving her forward: Come, Anne
Jump
The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on
Jump
You can make it
've done it
You can make it
will not ruin my dress
Catch me
Solomon moves close, holds out his arms
Yet, there's still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes
Anne gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon replies
() 3
will catch you, Anne
() will
Again, lightly stern: You will
And with that Anne takes the leap
Solomon catches her, swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to the delighted applause of the children
That done, Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on
As Solomon and his family make their way, among the slaves on the street, we see one in particular;
As he trails his  he can't help but note Solomon and his family as they enter
His intrigue of this most handsome and harmonious group should be obvious
With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly
Suddenly a voice barks out- (
) Jasper
Come on
- We are inside the store of
; a white man and a supplier of general goods
Solomon greets him : Mr
Parker
Mr
Northup
Mrs
Northup
With money in hand the Northup children move quickly about the store looking for items to purchase
: Anne looks over some silks and fabrics
Parker suggests : (') new cravat, Solomon
Pure silk by way of the French
We are in need of a fresh carry all for the Mrs's travels

Off to Sandy Hill

Using a long pole, Mr
Parker fetches down a from an upper shelf
Something to suit your style, but sturdy enough for the forty miles round trip
Handing the Bag to Anne, she is immediately taken by it
It's beautiful
() At what price
We will take it
Children, come see what your father has just purchased for me
As the children run over - chattering excitedly about the new gift - they    who has quietly entered the store
At the checkout counter sits a portrait of , the edges draped in black crepe
Before the book sits a
Mr
Parker asks of Solomon: If you would sign our condolence book
My hope is to find a way to forward it to the Widow Harrison
Sad days for the nation
Yes, certainly
Poor Mrs
Harris and her children
hope brighter times ahead

5 : (2) 5 Jasper looks scared, timid
It's as though he'd like to engage, but is unsure of as to how
Noting Jasper, Parker : moment, sir, and you will be assisted
If we could discuss the price

5 : (3) 5 Forgive me, Mrs
Northup customer waits
Welcome, sir
To Jasper, with good nature: Shop well, but mind your wallet
Ignore the gentleman's nonsense
Now, may  interest you in a new cravat
Pure silk by way of the-- Before Parker can finish, the door opens
It's Jasper's Master,
He's stern, clearly displeased
Jasper
( ) My regrets for the intrusion
No intrusion
Fitzgerald looks to Solomon
It is a cold glare as though he wasn't speaking to, and has no interest in a response from a black man
Looking back to Parker: Good day, sir
6 6 /  - Anne, busy in the kitchen, puts the final touches to the meal, which is just about to begin
Solomon, in the meanwhile, sits at the head of the table reading from a He reads to his children solemn news of the funeral arrangements for the recently deceased President Harrison
"Thus has passed away from earth our late President
" Solomon starts from the top of the article
(') "During the morning, from sunrise, the heavy bells had been pealing forth their slow and solemn toll while the minute guns announced that soon the grave would receive its trust
Our city as well as our entire nation has been called to weep over the fall of a great and good man
One who was by the wishes of a large majority of our () () 5A

" long moment of quiet, the family continuing to eat
Then, from Margaret: Will you read it again
Not just now, darling
Anne enters the dining room and places a large chicken at the center of the table
As she takes a seat, all heads are bowed
For food that stays our hunger, For rest that brings us ease, For homes where memories linger, We give our thanks for these
Amen
Margaret, that was wonderful
Thank you, Papa
Alonzo, do you have something to say
Yes,  helped Momma make this
Yes, and you were such a good help
Especially making the gravy
Papa,  would very much like to learn how to play the violin
Could you teach me
Me too
Yes, but  asked Papa first
Both of you, calm down
We will have our first lesson after this wonderful dinner
And on that note, let's start eating

The scene is one of warmth and happiness

-  7 Solomon and Anne have fun and difficulty putting the unruly children to bed
They are tucked in, and each given a kiss good night
As Margaret lays down to sleep, Anne blows out the candle darkening the room
Silhouetted in the doorway, Solomon takes Anne in his arms, holds her tightly as they both luxuriate in the simple, beautiful gift that is their children
7A 7A - Now alone together, we see Anne and Solomon wrapped in each other's arms
Beyond being physically close, emotionally close, they are just so very comfortable with one another
They are the very representation of a couple who are made for each other
They look at each other for a prolonged time

Anne and the children are dressed for travel - Anne sporting
The Driver loads bags into the carriage
For her parting gift, Anne gives her husband a kiss
Travel safely
Stay safely
Anne and the children loaded up, the Driver chides the horse and the carriage heads off
Solomon waves a hearty good bye to his wife and children
10 10 - Solomon is now out for a stroll
He passes two men - two in particular - who stand outside conversing with
himself:   and
Brown is about 40, with a countenance indicating shrewdness and intelligence
Hamilton is closer to 25, a man of fair complexion and light eyes
Both are finely, if perhaps a bit garishly, dressed
Hamilton, as Solomon describes him, slightly effeminate
Moon, spotting Solomon: Call the Devil's name
There he is now
Mr
Northup
have two gentlemen who should make your acquaintance
Messrs
Brown and Hamilton
Sir
Mr
Northup, these two gentlemen were inquiring about distinguished individuals, and  was just this very moment telling them that Solomon Northup is an expert player on the violin
He was indeed
Mr
Moon is being overly gracious
() 8
10 : 10 Taking into consideration his graciousness and your modesty, may we trouble you for a moment of your time to converse, sir
11 11 / - We make a jump to a green space
Solomon, Brown and Hamilton are sitting at a bench
circus
That is our usual employee
The company currently in the city of Washington
Circus too constricting a word to describe the talented and merry band with which we travel
It is a spectacle unlike most have ever witnessed
Creatures from the darkest Africa as yet unseen by civilized man
Acrobats from the Orient able to contort themselves in the most confounding manners
And  myself in aide of Mr
Brown; an internationally renowned practitioner in the art of prestidigitation
We are on our way thither to rejoin the company having left for a short time to make a small profit from our own exhibitions
The reason for our inquiry with Mr
Moon
Yes
We had just a devil of a time in procuring music for our () () 9
11 : 11 (') entertainments
Men of true talent seemingly in short supply
Thank you sir
If we could persuade you to accompany us as far as New York
We would give you one dollar for each day's service and three dollars for every night played at our performances
In addition we would provide sufficient pay for the expenses of your return from New York here to Saratoga
You understand this is all very sudden
Consider it an opportunity to see -- It's intriguing
If there is any way in which you would give consideration to the offer
Solomon gives the whole deal one last consideration
The payment offered is enticement enough, as is my desire to visit the metropolis
We are delighted, sir
So delighted
Though we would add that our travel plans-- We would like to depart with haste
() 10
11 : (2) 11 As luck would have it, my wife and children are traveling
will write her of our plans
Excellent
would beg you collect yourself, then we may proceed
12 12 / - Back in his house, we see Solomon packing: putting some clothes in a travel case, and collecting his violin as well
13
/ -  13 Solomon sits down to write a letter; pen poised over paper with already a few lines written
But Solomon thinks better of it 14 14 ' /
- Solomon enters the buggy, carpet bag in hand
Brown and Hamilton are waiting
They ride in a covered carriage led by a pair of "noble" horses
No letter to post
No need
My return will coincide with my family's
We're off then
15 15 - -   , 1841- We find ourselves in a roadside pub
It serves the purpose of drinking and diversion, and little more
As Solomon plays his violin, Brown and Hamilton perform a decent, paired magic routine before a "
" 11
16
-  16 After the show, the pub now fairly empty, Solomon, Hamilton and Brown sit down to eat
Hamilton and Brown drink, but again Solomon abstains
Though Solomon remains cool, Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of being disappointed as Hamilton counts out what little money was collected
Not an additional tip from a one of them
They expect to be entertained for nothing
And not satisfied a bit despite giving them more than what they paid for
It's the national mood
There's too much grief to make room for frivolity
My sincerest apologies, Solomon
You were promised opportunity, and you were given none
The opportunity is with the circus
two man show poorly promoted, what were we to expect
But the circus bills itself
True
have told you of the circus with which we are connected
Creatures from the darkest of Africa
Acrobats from the Orient who-- You have described it, yes
Yes
We need to return immediately to Washington
Solomon
believe us familiar enough now, but forgive me if  am bold
would you consider making the trip with us
Solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea
() 12
16 : 16 Entertaining at pubs and inns has it's place, but a man of your skills deserves better
Hear, hear
And more importantly you would build your own name and following
The circus tends to attract those with the highest of reputations
An introduction here and there could amount to a lifetime of reward
Now would be the time
With your family away, an opportunity presents itself
Said as fellow artists as well as businessmen
Well worth the effort at least
You present a flattering representation
As my family will be traveling back shortly, perhaps might commit only to one trial engagement
Oh, very good, sir
Very good cannot recall being so excited
There is a practical concern
If you are to continue on with us you should obtain your free papers
Not necessary
Here in New York, no
But we will be entering slave states and as a matter of precaution
It's to all our benefit we should not have to come to account for your well being
Six shillings worth of effort could well save much trouble later
() 12A
16 : (2) 16 We'll go to the Customs House in the morning, then travel on
Good business all around

17  17 18
-  18 The city is a swarm of people
At the moment the populace is displaying both sorrow and anticipation
Sorrow for the loss of the President
Many are dressed in black, and black crepe hangs nearly everywhere
Black armbands are frequently seen, and the occasional American Flag hung at half mast
As well, there are portraits of Harrison at varying locations
Having arrived in Washington, Solomon, Hamilton and Brown 19 19 /  - decent though crowded, boisterous and smoke-filled joint
Very lively
Solomon, Hamilton and Brown are among several parties drinking in the hotel's bar
As with seemingly everywhere in the city black crepes accessorize the background
Brown counts out $43
00 on the tabletop
Solomon is astonished by the amount
Forty-three dollars
All to you
That
it's far more than my wages amount to
Consider the remainder an advance from the circus
cannot tell you
honestly wish you had seen the expression of our director when  described your abilities
He was fairly overcome with excitement
You should have invited him to sup with us
did
did, but so many preparations before the company is to depart
-- Tomorrow we shall prepare for our Washington debut
But tonight, our thoughts are with the great man () () 13A
19 : 19 (') for whom this city prepared solemn memorial
He has passed from the praise of men to receive the plaudit of his heavenly father fine man has passed
Let us remember him with a drink
() 14
19 : (2) 19 Both Hamilton and Brown hold up their tankards to drink
Solomon, a bit reluctantly, does the same
Cheers
Another
Our departed President deserves all the salutation we can imbibe
Hamilton and Brown drink again, and Solomon does as well
20 20 21  21 22
-  22 to Solomon outside of the Pub, in an alley, with Brown and Hamilton in silhouette, back-lit by the street lights
He is violently ill, hunched over and retching horribly
That's all right Solomon
No shame in it
No shame at all
15
A23
-  A23 Hamilton and Brown help Solomon to lumber up the spiral staircase, passing the occasional bemused guest
23
/'  -  23 Hamilton is placing a spittoon near Solomon's bed, where a prone and reeling Solomon lays
Hamilton sits on the bed
As he strokes Solomon's sweaty face, Hamilton speaks sweetly
'm afraid that Brown and haven't brought you much luck
But rough waters bring smooth sailing
Eventually they do
So
so sorry
Shhh
We won't hear it
We won't
Let him sleep
Hmm
good night's sleep
And tomorrow
tomorrow you will feel as well and refreshed as though the earth were new again
Hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to Solomon for Brown's taste
With more than a bit of : Hamilton
Nothing more we can do for him
Such is the pity
Displaying an odd sort of disappointment, Hamilton slinks away from the bed
He crosses to, and The room goes dark with a blackness more than night
Brown and Hamilton exit
Solomon lays in the dark and moans
His sounds becoming 24 24 '  - () 16
24 : 24 Solomon stirs, then slowly awakes to his new circumstances
He finds himself in a nearly lightless room about twelve feet square with walls of solid masonry
There is a thick and well-locked door, a small window covered with iron bars and a shutter
The only furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box stove
As Solomon rises he sees that his  are - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and his
At first Solomon is incredulous
But that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic
He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them
He does so with increasing desperation
Solomon flails about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and beating against the masonry
He grunts and screams without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his flesh, but he cannot pull himself free
After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires, slows, then finally he collapses
And in this collapsed state he remains
25 25 '  - Solomon again awakens
He hears sounds beyond the door
footsteps
Eventually the door opens
Enter - who runs the slave pen - and who works as a turnkey and overseer
As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into the otherwise near-black room
The shine is painful to Solomon's eyes
With no salutation whatsoever, Burch : Well, my boy, how yah feel now
Solomon rises up as best he can
With all the resolve he can put together he states what he considers to be fact: am Solomon Northup
am a free man; a resident of Saratoga, New York
The residence also of my wife and children who are equally free
have papers
You have no right whatsoever to detain me-- Yah not any-- And  promise you -  promise - upon my liberation  will have satisfaction for this wrong
Resolve this
Produce your papers
() 17
25 : 25 With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his trousers
He searches one, then the other, but they are empty
He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his papers have been lifted
Solomon's confidence shifts, but to resolve rather than fear
Papers or none, he will not be easily cowed
Still, Burch asserts: (') Yah no free man
And yah ain't from Saratoga
Yah from Georgia
moment
Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man yielding
Burch says again: (') Yah ain't a free man
Yah nuthin' but a Georgia runaway
Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce
Solomon does not in any way
Both men exchange a long and daring stare
The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off
Burch, leans to Radburn, Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of "instruments:" a  - the flattened portion, which is about the size in circumference of two open hands, and bored with a small auger in numerous places
He also carries a
cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many strands
The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the extremity of each
Burch says again: (') Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia
Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism
He will say nothing of the kind
As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men
He is pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his back
Radburn then    , holding Solomon down in a bent position
With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the back with the paddle
Burch strikes him wordlessly - no taunting, no sneering
Solomon screaming against each blow
His back immediately This beating continues on and on and on until quite literally Burch    with the effort
Dripping in sweat and panting: () 18
25 : (2) 25 (') Yah still insist yah a free man
insist
Burch regrets hearing this
Not from sympathy, but rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to beating Solomon
Yet, as if returning to work, Burch returns to pummeling Solomon
Burch punctuates the blows : Yah a slave
Yah a Georgia slave
Burch continues to strike, and strike
This time until the paddle
Burch then
Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly, the flails cutting into Solomon's back
Again, Burch's arm tires before Solomon "breaks
" (') Are yah slave
No
Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping
' Finally Burch can whip no more
He pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough energy to take up his instruments and
Radburn lingers for a moment
He takes the irons off Solomon's legs
Opens the window some
As he makes these gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one wrought with poor sincerity:: seen a good many of the black kind just where yah're
Sick
Make me sick
Often times the situation was resolved, and think; what was all the beatin' and abuse for
Things end as they should, and the violence was for naught
So why cause trouble when they ain't no cause for it
Be of a cooperative nature, and things don't need be particularly unpleasant
() Or, yah can carry on like yah been, and  fear yah won't live to see Sunday next
With that thought, Radburn exits
Solomon rests
But to rest seems like giving in to defeat
He begins pulling () 19
25 : (3) 25 on his chains
But for all his struggling, the chain loosens none
Solomon calls out: Help me
Someone help me
If anyone at all hears him, they do not respond
Solomon continues his plaintive cry for assistance
26 26 '  - Beginning with a   on the shuttered, barred window of Burch's dungeon - Solomon's cries barely eking beyond the space -     from the building, onto the city until clearly visible is the Nation's capital
It's icon's of freedom - the , the   - fairly mocking Solomon's captivity
Simultaneously, barren at the early hour and cluttered with litter and the remains of previous day's procession, the city is a bleak and forboding sight
27 27 '  - The door to the yard is thrown open
The harsh white light floods all over Solomon

A32 29 21
30
' / -  30 It is a yard just beyond Burch's
The yard is hemmed in by a brick wall
In the yard are two men, and a boy
The oldest is   a man of about 25 years of age
He is well educated
is about 20 years old
He is born and bred a slave, is lacking in education, and overwhelmed with fear of the situation
Finally there is a child about 10 years of age who answers to the name of Randall
Solomon, Clemens Ray, John and Randall
Though they try to cover their privates a bit, they are all aware of the uselessness of modesty
Radburn is present
He has before him He throws water on the naked men
Go on
Warsh up
The men, soaking in humility as well as water, begin to scrub with       passed among them
(') The boy, too
Get him clean
Solomon takes some soap and rubs it over Randall
(') Scrub now
Git 'em clean
Solomon scrubs harder
Randall - clearly cold and uncomfortable - appeals to Solomon
Do you know when my Mama will come
Hush him up
Seeing Solomon has no answer for him, Randall begins to cry
Mama
Mama
Is she going to come
Doing all he can to spare the child from a certain : Quiet, please
Randall is becoming nearly inconsolable
Mama
() 21A
30 : 30 Saying anything to keep the boy quiet: Your mother will come,  swear she will, but you must be silent
Please
Be silent
On the seeming strength of Solomon's promise, Randall goes silent
Solomon looks to Radburn, who just throws water on the soapy men
22
31  31 A32
'  -  A32 Radburn brings food in to Solomon; a shriveled piece of meat and some water
Just barely enough to sustain Solomon
Radburn also has a
That old thing of yours is just rags and tatters
Need something proper to wear
Solomon doesn't move for the clothing
(') Go'won
Put it on
With slow defiance, Solomon does as instructed
He removes what remains of his old shirt - the one he was wearing when first kidnapped - and puts on the one Radburn brought him
The shirt's ill-fitting and dirty
Despite that, Radburn says: (') There
Tha's fine
Tha's fine
Got no gratitude
Thank you
Yah keep bein' proper, yah'll see how things work out
Radburn starts to take the old shirt
No
It was from my wife
Rags and tatters
Rags and tatters
Taking the shirt, the "rags and tatters" as he calls them, Radburn exits, locking the door behind him
Solomon sits with the plate of food before him
He pushes the plate away rather than eat
32 32 ' / - Sitting together out in the yard are Clemens Ray, John and Solomon
Over time they have drawn trustworthy enough to speak with one another
At the moment Solomon is still trying to apply reason to the situation
() 22A
32 : 32 Randall wanders about in the background
As usual, he calls out for his "Mama
" By now, however, his calls should feel like little more than background noise
This can't stand
It is a crime
believe now someone lay in wait for me
My drink was altered
We are free men
They have
they have no right to hold us
Solomon waits for a response from the others
They give none
(') We need a sympathetic ear
If we have an opportunity to explain our -- Who in your estimation is that sympathetic ear
The two men  journeyed with
'm certain they're making inquires at this very moment
would be just as certain they are counting the money paid for delivering you to this place
They were not kidnappers
They were artists
Fellow performers
You know that
You know for certain who they were
() 23
32 : (2) 32 The fact is, Solomon can't say for certain
(') How  reckon the situation: whatever past we had
well, that's done now
The reality to come is us being transported southward
New Orleans if  were to venture
After we arrive, we'll be put to market
Beyond that
Well, once in a slave state  suppose there's only one outcome
No
don't say that to give you empty agitation, John
For y'all
For y'all they ain't nothin' but that
But John was'n kidnapped
John bein' hold as debt, tha's all
Massa pay his debt, and John be redeemed-- Boy, our masters will not come for us
John is nearly beside himself with panic
Now John's
John's sorry for y'all, but tha's how it be
Where y'all goin', yah goin' witout John
Massa take care of me
Massa take care
Mama
All three men turn and look
At the moment Randall doesn't call out emptily
At the door to the yard is Burch along with two women
One in her late twenties; She is "arrayed in silk, with rings upon her fingers, and golden ornaments suspended from her ears
" Though a slave, Eliza was a mistress and has - to this point - lived well
This is reflected in her airs and her speech
The other is a little girl, light in skin color, of about seven or eight
This is , Randall's half sister
As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight, then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy
Clearly this is mother and child being reunited
() 24
32 : (3) 32 As Burch locks the yard door, Eliza clutches Randall
She is overcome with emotion
My darling
My sweet, sweet baby
33 33 '  - Later in the evening
Solomon now shares his space with Eliza and her children
As the children rest, Eliza drops into a lament as if pleading her case to Solomon who lends a sympathetic ear
Both slyly, and with a bit of aggrandizement: When  say  had my master's favor, you understand
Above even his own wife,  had it
Do you know that he built a house for me
Built it on the sole condition that  reside there with him
The added promise in time  would be emancipated
And for nine years he blessed me with every comfort and luxury in life
Displaying the finery she still wears: (') Silks and jewels and even servants to wait upon us
Such was our life, and the life of this beautiful girl  bore for him
But Master Berry's daughter
she always looked at me with an unkind nature
She hated Emily no matter she and Emily were flesh of flesh
As Master Berry's health failed, she gained power in the household
Eventually,  was brought to the city on the false pretense of our free papers being executed
If had known what waited; to be sent south
swear  would not have come here alive
() 25
33 : 33 Eliza turns to her children: (') My poor, poor babies
34
'  -  34 It's the deep of night, all are sleeping Burch enters with Radburn beside him
Both carry  with them
Hardly giving Solomon and Eliza a moment to rouse themselves, : Come on
Get yer blankets
Get up
Sensing that things will not end well: No, please don't
don't want to hear yer talk
Get in the yard
Please
Ain't no need for all that
Putting hand to Randall's head
(') Jus takin' a li'l trip, tha's all
Don't want to frighten the chil'ren none over a li'l boat ride, do yah
Eliza gives a shake of her head to the negative
(') Alright then
Git yerselves up
35 35 ' / - We now have Solomon, Clemens, John, Eliza and the children
They are being cuffed together
As John is cuffed, he pulls back
Scared
He beings in : John's massa gunna pay his debt
John's massa gunna come for him
() 26-28
35 : 35 Not wanting to hear any of this talk, Burch strikes John several times in the head with a sap-like instrument
Weakened, but again: (') John's massa gunna-- Burch again strikes John until he's quiet
Curiously, Emily and Randall don't even flinch
Why would they
They are quite used to seeing this kind of violence

They are made to lay down side-by-side
We stay with them as some sort of cloth is flung over them, obscuring and blacking out their view
At that moment, the screen is  and we hear the sound of the cart moving in haste

- Led by Burch, the group of slaves arrive to a dock
They are taken quickly up a gangplank and onto the steamboat as the ,  and a   , but do not interfere
37 37 / - The slaves are hustled down one at a time into a dark, dank hold among barrels and boxes of freight
and
Burch comes around and "checks" the chains; makes sure they are all secure and locked
Satisfied, he heads up out of the hold
Radburn follows
Alone in the dark in the hold, John cries, as does Eliza
Solomon stares down Burch for as long as he can, as if wishing bad things
As if wanting to exact some measure of revenge
But the greater insult is that Burch and Radburn, engaged in conversation, take no notice of Solomon whatsoever
He is that insignificant to them
That fact, that reality, makes Solomon boil with a rage he cannot express in words

Clemens Ray and Solomon watch as the Mulatto Woman returns to top deck, the trapdoor locked firmly behind her
Clemens Ray turns to Solomon with a deadpan stern expression
If you want to survive, do and say as little as possible
Tell no one who you really are and tell no one that you can read and write

Sardines are laid out to dry in rows, glittering in the day's sun as if like silver pennies
chain of slaves enter the frame and are led one by one on to the docked vessel

Chief among them is who fights viciously with his captors
"With all haste" is shoved down into the hold
Having taken their cargo as far as they care or need to, Burch and Radburn depart
They do so without a word spoken to Solomon or the others
With this new and sizable batch of slaves on board, the crew again  , and the Orleans makes its way again

As he cleans, he again watches Robert prep food
Robert's skill with a knife is not lost on Solomon

Muzzle covering his face, Robert is shackled with his hands tied behind his back
Solomon and Clemens Ray look on
sailor descends the staircase and takes off Robert's muzzle, shooting him a forbidding look
He leaves

45 : 45 : Solomon, Clemens Ray and Robert, now in mid-conversation
say we fight
Robert delivers this in a hushed voice
The crew is fairly small
If it were well planned,  believe they could be strong armed
Three can't stand against a whole crew
The rest here are niggers, born and bred slaves
Niggers ain't got the stomach for a fight, not a damn one
All  know, we get where we travelling we'll wish we'd died trying
Survival is not about certain death, it is about keeping your head down
Solomon looks at Clemens Ray, agitated -- his voice now raised above the previous whispers
Grits his teeth
Days ago  was with my family, in my home
Now you tell me all is lost
"Tell no one who  really am" if  want to survive
don't want to survive,  want to live

Sailor descends the ladder approaching Eliza
He bends down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her face
Solomon rouses, and looks across to witness the scene
From his vantage point, we see Eliza stand to interrupt the Sailor
The Sailor looks at Eliza, Eliza looks back at him
Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the hold
As she does so, Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand between Eliza and the Sailor
Stretching out a firm hand to the sailor's shoulder, Robert's look says "No you don't
" Clemens Ray is awake now, watching
There is an odd moment of stillness between the Sailor and Robert, an impasse
We focus on the Sailor's face
Slowly, a greasy smile erupts upon it
Back now to Robert's face, a look of incomprehension
Robert looks down
We follow his gaze to the knife that has already been jabbed unseen between Robert's ribs
The sailor withdraws the bloody blade
wide shot of the two men
Robert collapses to the floor like a sack of potatoes
Clemens Ray and Solomon react
Complete horror

We are in the port of New Orleans, one of the busiest in the young nation
On the dock itself there is a bustle of activity as goods are loaded and unloaded from a various ships
It's a bit of controlled chaos as a    are spoken and shouted while slaves are shuttled from the Orleans to a holding pen
Solomon, and all the slaves are overwhelmed by all that is happening around them
Two men - among many - are awaiting the arrival of the Orleans
They are   - Clemens Ray's master - and who is the solicitor of Mr
Ray
They both look like they mean business
The moment the gangplank is laid, Ray yells for Clemens
Clemens, seeing his master, is nearly crazy with delight
He is, uncharacteristically beside himself
Ironically, his master now represents "freedom
" () 34
52 : 52 My master
Master Ray, sir
Master Ray
Clemens pulls on his chain
As he does so, Several other slaves collapse in his effort to reach his master, like dominos
Who is in charge of this vessel

Jonus Ray
My solicitor has documentation verifying that the Negro named Clemens Ray is my property
As he reads  handed to him by Davis: know nothing of-- You are ordered by court to return that property immediately, or face charges of thievery
My duty is to transport goods am not responsible for their origin
Remove these contraptions
To his mate: Free him
Biddee does as ordered
Once free, Clemens hugs and sobs over his master as would a lost and then found child
It's all well, now, Clemens
You will return home with me
(to the Captain) Consider this notice and warning
() 35
52 : (2) 52 Ray, Davis and Clemens head away
Solomon seems both desperate and hopeful of some aid from Clemens and Ray
But there is none forthcoming
Ray and Clemens continue on - Clemens not so much as even looking back in Solomon's direction
Solomon stands and watches as they fade into the environs and are gone from sight
53 53 / - Hours later
The slaves sit off on one side of the dock, baking in the sun, awaiting their fate

The slaves  as they are called

Freeman steps to Solomon
He gives him a looking over
Stand up
Solomon does as told

Why didn't you answer when called
My name is not Platt
My name is-- Freeman strikes Solomon hard across the face
Your name is Platt, and  will teach you your name so that you don't forget

Get them to my cart

54 /
-  54 Solomon is carted off along with the rest of "Burch's stock:" Eliza and her children, John and Solomon
As they move off from the port in a make-shift cart, it opens up to the frenzic, busy port
For the first time Solomon sees true and severe slavery
These are not visiting servants, such as Jasper was back in Saratoga
These are humans held in strict bondage - herded like cattle, chained together as if in a "chain gang
" Slaves are evident not merely by the color of their skin
The residue and accessories of slavery are everywhere
Blacks almost universally display scars - - brands, and are often missing limbs
Blacks are held in all types of shackles, from simple chains to elaborate bindings, to neck collars that are spiked
Some are muzzled or forced to wear bits
One slave is attacked by a dog and the slave owner
The dog pulls and tears at the slave's clothes , They should be a reminder that not only are people being oppressed, but that there is an entire system of oppression in place
55 55 '   - "Burch's stock:" arrive at Freeman's slave pen
They are led in by Freeman and his house slave  - a mulatto
The yard is enclosed by plank, standing upright, with ends sharpened instead of brick walls as with Burch's
Including Burch's group there are about 30  in the pen
Solomon and the others look around and see nothing but downtrodden and despondent faces
Three men sit next to each other with muzzles and quietly stare back at this new batch of arrivals
One attempts to speak, but all that comes out is a muffled, unintelligible sound
56 56 '   - The slaves are in various states of undress, men and women alike
They clean themselves, scrubbing with soap and water
Women wash their hair
Men shave, skin is oiled
Freeman walks among them, inspecting them as they primp themselves
57 57 '   - The slaves are given new clothes by Cape
The men are given hat, coat, shirt, pants and shoes
The women () 37
57 : 57 frocks of calico and handkerchiefs to bind about their heads
58
'/  -  58 It's an odd, ironic scene
The slaves are in a large and fairly ornate room within Freeman's house - background music - as Freeman tries to line up      , he becomes less patient, jittery and nervous, knowing that his livelihood is at stake, he wants his slaves to make a good impression
Sometimes his patience gets the better of him, and his hands move freely in direction of the slaves
The business has the air of an etiquette class, though what Freeman is trying to do is coach the slaves into being more "sellable
" He works with them in groups of five or so
Tallest to smallest, understand
Are you taller than her
Then you'd go before her
Do it
Move
(to the group) Keep your heads up
sense of direction; that's how you look smart
None of those saucer eyes
Rid yourself of that smile
Look like a goddamn grinnin' monkey
Put the least thought in your head
'mon, now
Think of somethin'
Weary of Cape's playing, Solomon moves to Cape
He asks: Can you play a reel
() Nah
don't know no reel
If  may
Cape looks to Freeman: He sick of your caterwaulin'
Let him play, boy
Let's see what he can do
Cape reluctantly hands the fiddle over to Solomon
Solomon tunes it a bit, then begins to play
His fingers stiff at first, he takes a moment to warm up
But as he warms up he is, despite the circumstances, masterful
() 38
58 : 58 All admire his work
Freeman chief among them
(') Keep on
Keep on
Solomon continues to play
(') damn sight better than you, Cape
damn sight better
Cape looks bitter as Solomon plays on
59 59 '/  - We come in on an odd sort of sight;
have come to see Freeman's lot - the room all gussied up with flowers
Freeman moves among them, displaying them as a rancher would prize chattel
Freeman makes the slaves hold their heads up - "look smart" as he previously admonished them
They are made to walk briskly back and forth while customers feel their hands and arms and bodies, turn them about and ask what skills they possess
The Customers routinely make the slaves open their mouths and show their teeth
At times a  or   are taken off to the side, stripped and inspected more minutely
One of them, John, is stripped and inspected
Cape, as he's done previously, plays his fiddle
buyer -  ; a man of middle age, and an attractive nature in his tone of voice - consults a list he's drawn up and asks of Freeman: What is the price for the ones Platt and Eliza
thousand for Platt; he is a nigger of talent
Seven hundred for Eliza
My fairest price
You will accept a note
As always, from you, Mr
Ford
Eliza is beside herself as it seems she is about to be separated from her family
She begs of Ford: () 39
59 : 59 Please, sir
Please don't divide my family
Don't take me unless you take my children as well
Eliza, quiet
You will have the most faithful slave in me, sir
The most faithful slave that has ever lived, but  beg that you do not separate us
interrupts the skirmish and approaches Freeman and delivers coolly, eyeing Randall- Your price for the child
You see how fit the boy is
Like ripe fruit
He will grow into a fine beast
Randall is made to run, and jump by  - exhibiting his activity and his condition
(') Six hundred, and that's fair and final
Done
He reaches into his waistcoat and retrieves his wallet, counting out six hundred dollars, placing them into the already extended hand of Freeman
Ford sees the distress and panic in Eliza; it visibly touches him
He now tries to buy  to console her
How much for the little girl
You have no need for her
One so young will bring you no profit
will not sell the girl
There's heaps 'n piles of money to be made off her
She is a beauty
One of the regular bloods
None of your thick-lipped, bullet headed, cotton picking niggers
() 39A
59 : (2) 59 Her child, man
For God's sake, are you not sentimental in the least
My sentimentality stretches the length of a coin
Do you want the lot, Mr
Ford, or do you pass on them all
will take the ones Platt and Eliza
Eliza grips her children tight
will not go without my children
You will not take them from me
() 40
59 : (3) 59 As if to prove her wrong, Freeman puts a foot to Eliza and harshly kicks her away from Emily
(') Please, don't
No
Freeman, to Cape: Take her out of here
Cape   , begins to pull Eliza away toward the door of the room, but her screaming and pleading do not abate
(') Keep her quiet
Cape tries to muzzle her with his hand, but Eliza continues to scream for her children as Emily does for her mother
Mama
Mama
( ) Play something
Get the fiddle and play
As ordered, Solomon takes up Cape's fiddle and begins to play lightly
(') Play
Solomon plays harder and more loudly
Still, it is barely enough to drown out Eliza's cries
Freeman gets the other slaves to clap along with Solomon's playing
Emily frees herself and runs back, crying but endeavoring to be strong- Don't cry, Mama
will be a good girl
Don't cry
will keep my head up and  will look smart will always look smart
Make merry, all of you
Goddamn it, Cape
Keep her quiet or it's your damned hide  will take it out of
Cape pulls a rag, stuffs it in Eliza's mouth
Clamping both hands over her mouth, he hauls Eliza from the room by the head

With the loss of her two children she has dropped into a depression she will not be able to pull out of

The main house of the plantation - the   as they are commonly called - is sizable
Two stories high with a piazza in front
In the rear are also a log kitchen, poultry house, corncribs and several slave cabins
The plantation is described as "a green spot in the wilderness
" With the arrival of Master Ford there is a flurry of activity - the "excitement" of a new delivery

A61A A61A '   - John Tibeats, stands before the slaves
Chapin hovers to one side
My name is John Tibeats, William Ford's chief carpenter
You will refer to me as Master
Tibeats nods in Chapin's direction: (') Mister Chapin is the overseer on this plantation
He is responsible for all of Ford's property
You too will refer to him as Master
This plantation covers many hundreds of acres, and you will traverse the Texas road between the forest site and the sawmill in double time
Any clever nigger on that path that gets a little lightfooted,  will remind him that on one side men and bloodhounds patrol the border and on the other the bayou provides a hard living, with alligators and little to eat or drink that won't kill you
No slave has escaped here with his life
You're here to work niggers, so let's commence
Tibeats begins to sing the song "Run Nigger, Run" mockingly
We cut to Solomon chopping logs and into the montage of the slaves doing manual labor and arriving back to the sawmill
Lyrics for "Run Nigger, Run" () 42A
A61A : A61A Oh run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you Run nigger run well you better get away Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you Run nigger run well you better get away Nigger run nigger flew Nigger tore his shirt in two Run run the pattyroller will get you Run nigger run well you better get away Nigger run, run so fast Stoved his head in a hornets nest Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you Run nigger run well you better get away Nigger run through the field Black slick coal and barley heel Run nigger run the pattyroller will get you Run nigger run well you better get away Some folks say a nigger won't steal caught three in my corn field One has a bushel

-  61 -     , 1841- We are in a wooded area
There is chopping trees into timber
It is hard, laborious work made no more easy by the sweltering heat
Solomon is among them as well as Sam
62 62 - The slaves now load the timber onto a horse drawn wagon
Again, hard work done under the ever present sun

We should get the sense the travel is long and tedious
64
'   -  64 It is a sizable work area on the edge of Indian Creek
There is much work being done, the slaves primarily employed in piling the timber and chopping it into lumber
As before, there is little doubt about the rigors of the job at hand

There are also various  who move about placing orders

All of Ford's slaves are dressed with their "finest" clothes - brightly colored and as free as possible of defect
The slaves are gathered on () 43
65 : 65 the lawn just beyond the piazza
Mistress Ford is present as well
As the slaves listen, Ford reads to them Scripture
His tone is of a man trying to preach by way of compassion
"But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,  am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob
God is not the God of the dead, but of the living
And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine
Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law
Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind
This is the first and great commandment
And the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
" Despite the lightness with which Ford speaks and the hope in his words,       - - -
We should be able to see in Mistress Ford's eyes that Eliza's constant crying is unsettling

They snack on smoked meat and drink water from gourds
As they lunch Solomon reads from Sam's Bible to the other slaves
But he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve
For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth
Is not he that sitteth at meat
But  am among you as he that serveth
white customer -  - irate at the sight and sound of slaves reading Scripture, crosses over
He grabs the Bible
From where did you thieve this
Suh, the book is my property
The White Customer has no interest in Sam's answer
With flailing hands he
Solomon tries to stop him
That only makes the situation worse, Solomon now the target of the man's ire
Take your hands from me
Ford comes running over
What is the commotion
Your niggers are either brazen or rebellious
This one was readin' Scripture, and this one claims it to be his
It is

You condone this

As a Christian can do no less

70 : 70 You can do no worse, Ford slave that reads is dangerous
Winslow moves off
He yells back at Ford: (') And the man who would allow a slave to read is unfit to own niggers

The word of God applies to all
In that you may take comfort

Slaves trudge alongside, same as it ever was
Only

Sam brings the wagon to a halt
He, and the slaves look up the road ahead of them
Standing in the middle of the road is a group of They are in their "usual" dress of buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic colors, buttoned from belt to chin
They have with them and
They carry with them the carcass of a deer
The two groups stare at each other for a long moment
73 73 - / The groups of slaves and Chickasaws are now intermingled
They "break bread" - actually they work on the carcass of the deer which is now roasting over a large fire
As well the group share a smoke on a pipe
One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an " " The Chickasaws perform a customary dance; trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a guttural, sing-song noise
The slaves enjoy the respite from work, Solomon particularly taken by the music

-  74 Solomon arrives to some tall grass at the edge of the river
Lowering his trousers, As he does, he stares out toward the flowing waters of Indian Creek
After a few moments, as though a thought far greater than relieving himself has come to him, Solomon stands and replaces his pants
Oddly, Solomon stares out at the water as though he were a man possessed
75 75 '   - Just beyond the   Solomon speaks with Ford as Tibeats listens
Solomon is drawing in the dirt, making rough diagrams for Ford as he explains himself
The creek is plenty deep enough to sail, even with a boat full of load
The distance from the to the point on the latter bayou is several miles by water fewer than land
It occurs to me that the expense of the transportation would be materially -- "Materially diminished
" If we use the waterway
It's a scheme
Plenty of engineers have schemed similarly
The passes are too tight

Wide enough for a tub to traverse team of niggers can clear it out

It's all just a trial for now
The work is diligent, but it is basic to this point
Still, under Solomon's direction, the slaves go at it like they've got something to prove
And rightly they do
Solomon also works on a narrow raft of twelve cribs with which he will transport the timber
Once this is constructed,   "" 77 77 '   - Ford and a group of slaves wait along the river banks just beyond the
All are expectant in their manner

Then, from up river, we see Solomon's raft of lumber winding its way

Tibeats looks pissed
He has just been shown up after all
78 78 /  - As we come into the scene, Ford is presenting Solomon with a fiddle
Not as grand as the one he previously owned in New York, but a fine instrument none the less
It is a gift of thanks for his hard work
Solomon's gratitude is easily expressed
() 48
78 : 78 My great thanks, Master Ford
My thanks to you, and it is the least of it
My hope is that it brings us both much joy over the years
Following the statement, Solomon's not sure how to react
He remains grateful, but the thought of "over the years" is just a reminder of the altered state in which he now finds himself

Eliza, stop
Solomon goes to her, grabs Eliza
She does not stop
As if to force the misery from her, Solomon (') Stop it
Stop

You make no sounds, but will you ever let them go in your heart

Do upset the Mistress and the Master
Do you care less for my loss than their well being
Master Ford is a decent man
He is a slaver
Under the circumstances-- Under the circumstances he is a slaver
Christian only in his proclamations
Separated me from my precious babies for lack of a few dollars
But you truckle at -- No
You luxuriate in his favor

will not fall into despair
Woeful and crushed; melancholy is the yolk  see most
will offer up my talents to Master Ford
will keep myself hearty until freedom is opportune
Ford is your opportunity
Do you think he does not know that you are more than you suggest
But he does nothing for you
Nothing
You are no better than prized livestock
Call for him
Call, tell him of your previous circumstances and see what it earns you

Eliza uses Solomon's name quite pointedly as if to underscore his true self

The slaves are again gathered in the rose garden near the front of the house to hear the word of the Lord as read by Master Ford
And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, And said, Verily  say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven
The phrase seems to trigger Eliza's tears
She begins to sob uncontrollably
Mrs
Ford turns to Rachel in a hushed whisper- cannot have that kind of depression about
Solomon, pretending not to have heard, slowly turns to Eliza with worry
Ford continues to preach over Eliza's keening

-  81 -, 1842- Seasons have passed
It is winter now, and very grey out along the bayou
Ford and Tibeats - who we have seen working around the   - stand with Solomon, Tibeats giving Solomon an inspection
Ford carries much lament
Raise yer shirt
Solomon does as instructed
Tibeats looks at Solomon's back, at the scars from lashings he bears
(') Troublesome
He's a good carpenter and quick- witted
am familiar with his cleverness
You won't find a nigger more humble
Ain't found a nigger yet  cain't humble
Tibeats heads off
Solomon, highly curious over the preceding
Sir, have  done something wrong
Not your concern, Platt
say with much
shame  have compiled debts
have long preached austerity, but find myself hypocritical in that regard
You'll be in the ownership of Mr
Tibeats
You are his now
Serve him as you'd serve me
Sir
And your faithfulness will not be forgotten
() 52
81 : 81 Yes, sir
Pride and want have been my sin
Loss of you is but one of my punishments
82 82 - -  , 1842- [  ] We see Solomon working as a carpenter, helping to erect a Weaving House that stands off to the side of the plantation's Great House
At the moment Solomon is nailing on siding
Tibeats arrives and is immediately dissatisfied with the work
Make them boards flush
They are, sir
They is no such thing
Solomon runs his hands over the boards
As smooth to the touch as a yearling's coat
Callin' me a liar, boy
Only a matter of perspective, sir
From where you stand you may see differently
But the hands are not mistaken
ask only that you employ all your senses before rendering judgement
What's Tibeats to do when faced with fact
All he can do is spew invectives
You are a brute
You are a dog, and no better for followin' instruction
'll do as ordered, sir
() 53
82 : 82 Then you'll be up at daybreak
You will procure a keg of nails from Chapin and commence puttin' on clapboards
Tibeats wheels away
Solomon goes back to his work
After a few moments Solomon notices a bit of commotion in the drive of the great house
It involves an inconsolable Eliza who is being herded by Sam onto a cart Mistress Ford and Rachel watch
Solomon can only watch as the last connection to his days as a free man is driven away to a location unknown
83 83 - It is day break
As ordered, Solomon is up and working
Chapin is rolling a keg of nails off a handcart for Solomon
If Tibeats prefers a different size,  will endeavor to furnish them, but you may use those until further directed
Yes, sir
84 84 - As the day gets on to mid-morning, the sun already baking in the sky, Tibeats makes his way over to Solomon
Even before arriving to Solomon his mien is one of belligerence; out of sorts and something less than sober
thought  told yah ta commence ta puttin' on clapboards this morn'
() 54
84 : 84 Yes, master
am about it have begun on the other side of the house
Tibeats walks around to look over Solomon's work
He is picayune, as if purposefully looking for fault
Didn't  tell yah last night to get a keg of nails of Chapin
And so  did; and Chapin said he would get another size for you, if you wanted them when he came back from the field
Tibeats walks to the keg and kicks it
Moving toward Solomon "with a great passion:" Goddamn yah
thought yah knowed somethin'
Solomon, perhaps inspired by his moment with Eliza, is in no mood for Tibeats
did as instructed
If there's something wrong, then its wrong with your instructions
Yah black bastard
Yah goddman black bastard
In an inconsolable rage, Tibeats runs off to the piazza to fetch a whip
Solomon looks around
He is alone other than Rachel and Mistress Ford who, shocked by that which she witnesses, runs out to the field to fetch Chapin
Solomon's instinct is to run, but he stands his ground as Tibeats marches back whip in hand
(') Strip yer clothes
Solomon does no such thing
(') Strip
will not
With "concentrated vengeance," Tibeats springs for Solomon, seizing him by the throat with one hand and () 55
84 : (2) 84 raising the whip with the other
Before he can strike the blow, however, Solomon catches Tibeats by the collar of his coat and pulls him in close
Reaching down, Solomon grabs Tibeats by the ankle and pushes him back with the other hand
Tibeats tumbles to the ground violent struggle takes place as Solomon puts a foot to Tibeats throat, and then in a frenzy of madness snatches the whip from Tibeats and begins to strike him with the handle again and again and again
Yew will not live ta see another day, nigger
This is yer last, swear it
Solomon ignores the threats, continues to beat Tibeats
Blow after blow falling fast and heavy on Tibeats's wriggling form
The stiff stock of the whip wraps around Tibeats's cringing body until Solomon's arm aches
Tibeats's cries of vengeance turn to yelps for help and then pleas for mercy: (') Murder
It's murder
Lord, God, help me
God be merciful
And then suddenly, Tibeats shrieks- (') Papa 'm sorry
Chapin comes      fast and hard
Solomon strikes Tibeats a blow or two more, then delivers a well-directed kick that sends Tibeats rolling over the ground
What is the matter
Tibeats struggles up and tries to present an air of dignity and control while he keeps a demonic eye on : Master Tibeats wants to whip me for using the nails you gave me
What's the matter with the nails
With a mix of shame, anger and embarrassment, Tibeats says, as if being exposed- They're
they're too large
am overseer here
told Platt to use them, and () () 56
84 : (3) 84 (') shall furnish such nails as please
Do you understand that, Mr
Tibeats
Tibeats answer is in the grinding of his teeth and the shaking of his fist
This ain't done by half
will have flesh, and  will have all of it
Tibeats moves off toward, and then
Chapin follows
long moment, Solomon stands alone
He looks around, not sure what to do; to stay or to flee
Anxiety mounts on his features
moment more, and Tibeats  the house
He saddles his horse and rides off to beat the devil
Or, worse, to fetch him
Chapin comes running back out of the house
He is visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest
Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off an air of impending trouble
Do not stir
Do not attempt to leave the plantation on any account whatever
But if you run there is no protecting you
-- If you run, Platt, there is no protecting you
Rachel
Chapin runs off to join Rachel
The two converse at a distance from Solomon, then they head off for the log kitchen
Solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is to come
And we wait, and we continue to wait
Moment by moment, the dread of the unexpected mounts
Solomon's eyes begin to well
He has beaten a white man, and he knows that death awaits him
, but he is too choked up to fully speak it
() 57
84 : (4) 84 Chapin has now returned to the piazza
He stands and watches, but does not move to Solomon
Solomon waits, and waits
which grow louder and louder in the manner of rolling thunder
It's Tibeats
He returns with two accomplices;  and
They carry with them large whips and a coil of rope
Tha's the one
Tha's him
Dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence
Solomon tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by - his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same manner
In the meantime the other two have slipped a cord within Solomon's elbows, running it across his back and tying it firmly
Solomon is then dragged toward a peach tree
lynching is in store
The naked horror of it intensely palpable
Solomon looks toward the piazza, but Chapin is now gone
Tears of fear flow down Solomon's cheeks
He is on the verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution, he begins to struggle and fight
rope goes around Solomon's neck, then is tossed over the branch of the tree
The trio begin to hoist Solomon
He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the life is choked from him
With suddenness, Chapin comes from the house brandishing a pistol in each hand - Colt Paterson
36 caliber "Holster" pistols with 9" barrels
Chapin moves with determination toward the lynch mob
He is sharp and matter of fact
With the guns in hand, he really doesn't need to be much more demonstrative
Gentlemen
Whoever moves that nigger another foot from where he stands is a dead man
am overseer of this plantation seven years, and in the absence of William Ford, my duty is to protect his interests
Ford holds a mortgage on Platt of four hundred dollars
If you hang him, he loses his debt
Until that is canceled you have no claim to his life
Directing his attention to Ramsay and Cook: () 58
84 : (5) 84 (') As for you two, if you have any regard for your own safety say, begone
Ramsay and Cook don't need to be told twice
The pistols Chapin's gripping make the situation real clear
Without further word, they mount their horses and ride away
Tibeats remains, and his anger with him
Yah got no cause
Platt is mine, and mine ta do with as  please
Yah touch my property,  will 'ave yah strung up as well
Tibeats mounts up and departs
There is a surreal moment as Chapin's not sure what to do about Solomon
He chooses to do nothing
Solomon is left dangling by the neck from the tree as Chapin calls to Sam in the : Sam
Get the mule
You must ride to Master Ford
Tell him to come here at once without a single moment's delay
Tell him they are trying to murder Platt
Hurry, boy
Bring him back if you must kill the mule to do so
Yes, suh
Sam mounts up and rides off, the mule demonstrating much speed
85 85 - The sun is now at its apex
The sight and smell of the red rose bush is more than vivid as Solomon remains tied and dangling exactly where he was left
The scene is both tranquil and horrific
Life on the plantation continues
The   work in the field
make their way playfully in the yard
It should all underscore the fact that a black, hanging even partially from a tree, is nothing unusual in this time and space
() 59
85 : 85 Chapin walks back and forth with the pistols in his hands
Clearly he fears Tibeats returning with more and better assistance
And yet, he does nothing to alleviate Solomon's suffering
He heeds Tibeats words, and as though caught up in the middle of nothing more than a property dispute, he offers no further aid
Solomon's head lolls to one side
He looks toward the sun
The bright light flares off the leaves and branches of the tree from which Solomon hangs
The glare in Solomon's eyes offering him more pain than solace, but he cannot help but look upward
As he does, his eyes flutter between life and lifelessness
86 86 87
-  87 Solomon continues to hang
By now he is drenched in sweat, and nearly delirious with dehydration
His lips dry and parched
He may not die from hanging, but he may very well expire before the day is over
Eventually Rachel comes over - timidly, and as though she were acting contrary to orders - and offers a drink of water from a tin cup, pouring it in Solomon's mouth for him
She then takes a small hand towel and dabs at the water which clings to his lips
Rachel then retreats, and leaves Solomon to hang
88 88 - The sun is just now arching for the horizon
Solomon remains, as though his torture will not end
Ford, trailed by Sam, finally comes riding up
He dismounts, and moves swiftly over to Solomon
With great heartache: Platt
My poor Platt
Ford produces a blade and cuts Solomon loose
Solomon attempts to carry himself, but he cannot
He falls to the ground and passes out
89 89 /  - As we come into the scene, Solomon lays on a blanket on the floor
Eventually, his eyes flutter, then open
He is in the foyer of the Ford house
As he gets his bearings, he looks around the interior ,
It is sharp contrast to the bleak surroundings, shacks and dungeons Solomon has largely been accustom to during his time of slavery
It will be the "first and last time such a sumptuous resting place was granted" during his twelve years of bondage
() 60
89 : 89 Solomon doesn't have much chance to luxuriate in his surroundings
He hears a   just outside, and is unnerved
Has Tibeats returned to finish what he started
From a study, Master Ford appears with a gun in hand
He goes to the door, opens it and looks outside
He can see nothing
Satisfied, Ford crosses back over to Solomon
He is frank with Solomon regarding the situation
believe Tibeats is skulkin' about the premises somewhere
He wants you dead, and he will attempt to have you so
It's no longer safe for you here
And don't believe you will remain passive if Tibeats attacks have transferred my debt to Edwin Epps
He will take charge of you
(desperate, urgent) Master Ford, you must know;  am not a slave
cannot hear that
Before  came to you  was a freeman
am trying to save your life
And
have a debt to be mindful of
That, now, is to Edwin Epps
He is a hard man
Prides himself on being a "nigger breaker
" But truthfully  could find no others who would have you
You've made a reputation of yourself
Whatever your circumstances, you are an exceptional nigger, Platt
fear no good will come of it
90 90 ' /  - -  , 1842- From the back porch, we come into the scene on ; a repulsive and coarse man
His language gives speedy and unequivocal evidence that he has never enjoyed the advantages of an education

, who is forty eight
, who is married to Wiley
and  who are Phebe's children, and
Patsey is young, just 23 years old

She is the offspring of a "Guinea nigger," brought over to Cuba in a slave ship
She nearly brims with unconversant sexuality

She sits with, holds quite lovingly, some "
" We also see Epps's overseer Treach constantly sports a
Though Epps reads the word of the Lord, he lacks the tone of compassion with which Ford read
"And that servant which knew his Lord's will '  and prepared not himself
, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes
" 'ye hear that
"Stripes
" That nigger that don't take care, that don't obey his lord - that's his master - d'ye see

Now, "many" signifies a great many
Forty, a hundred, a hundred and fifty lashes
That's Scripter

As we move out, we identify , a 23 year old striking black woman
The camera moves out again to a wider shot
This reveals several lines of slaves picking cotton, with Patsey way out in the lead
We cut to another pair of black hands
This time, revealing , clumsy and unskilled hands, picking cotton
lash bears down on him
It is August, "cotton picking" season
We are looking out over a cotton field in full bloom
It presents a visual purity, like an immaculate expanse of light, new-fallen snow
The cotton grows from five to seven feet high, each stalk having a great many branches () 62
91 : 91 shooting out in all directions and lapping each other above the water furrow
There is a slave to each side of the row
They have a sack around their necks that hangs to the ground, the mouth of the sack about breast high
Baskets are placed at the end of the furrows
Slaves dump their sacks of cotton in the baskets, then pick until their sacks are again filled
Pick that cotton
Move along now

Despite the heat, there is no stopping for water
The slaves are "driven" by Edward, who is himself "driven" by Treach

Edward moves among the slaves, applying the whip to them without regard
Pick dat cotton
Move along now, hear
92 92 ' /  - The day's work is done
The slaves are now assembled in the gin house with their baskets of cotton which are being weighed by Treach
There is anxiety among the slave, the reason for which soon becomes apparent
Two hundred forty pounds for Bob
What yah got for James
Two hundred ninety five pounds
Tha's real good, boy
Tha's real good
One hundred eighty two pounds for Platt
Epps does not look happy
Treach says again: () 63

Five hundred twelve pounds for Patsey

Queen of the fields, she is

Wiley is pulled from the line, huddled with Solomon

Solomon, Phebe, and Wiley are stripped, placed in a stockade and now being given a perfunctory whipping delivered by 94 94 '  - Evening, but the day is not yet done
Slaves attend their various evening chores; feeding livestock, doing laundry, cooking food
There is no respite from a slave's charge

The slaves finally fix their own dinner of corn meal
Corn is ground in a small hand mill
The corn meal is mixed with a little water, placed in the fire and baked
When it is "done brown" the ashes are scraped off
Bacon is fried
As the slaves eat, Abram goes on in great length and with much emotion about General Jackson
Hold my words: General Jackson will forever be immortalized
His bravery will be handed down to the last posterity
If ever there be a stain upon "raw militia," he done wiped away on the eight of January

Great man
Great man in deed
We all need pray to Heavenly Father da General reign over us always
96 96 ' /  - The slaves are sleeping
There is a loud commotion
Epps enters, drunkenly, forcing the slaves awake
() 65
96 : 96 Get up
Get up, we dance tonight
We will not waste the evenin' with yer laziness
Get up
97 97 ' /  - Despite the lateness of the hour, the slaves are up and now fully dressed
They take up position in the middle of the floor
They wait, poised like actors
Solomon strikes up a tune; Henry joins in with a pan flute and the slaves dance
They do so very wearily
The whole of it certainly more torture than pleasure
Epps, whip in hand: Where's yah merriment
Move yer feet
As the slaves twirl about Epps keeps an attentive eye on Patsey
It should be quite clear that his primary motivation for holding dances is so that he may view Patsey twirl about the floor
This fact is not lost on Mistress Epps
few moments of Epps's lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear
Jealousy mounting, she snatches up a
With all her might she throws it at Patsey
It hits Patsey square in the face
, The dancing, the music stop
The slaves, however, react as though it is not the first time they've seen as much from the Mistress
Mistress Epps, screaming like a hellion: Sell her
'mon, now
Wha's this
You will sell the negress
You're talkin' foolish
Sell little Pats
She pick with more vigor than any other nigger
Choose another ta go
No other
Sell her

Back to that hog's trough where found you
Oh, the idleness of that yarn washes over me
Do not set yourself up against Patsey, my dear
That's a wager on which you will not profit
Calm yerself
And settle for my affection, 'cause my affection you got
Or, go
'Cause  will rid myself of yah well before  do away with her
Mistress Epps stands irate, lost in fury and unable to even think of what to do
Eventually, optionless, she storms away
For a few beats there is only the sound of Patsey sobbing
(') That damned woman
won't have my mood spoiled
will not
Dance
Epps sends the whip in Solomon's direction
Solomon responds by playing
Treach literally drags the prone Patsey from the floor, blood still spilling from her face
The slaves, as ordered, return to dancing

This is a list of goods and sundries
You will take it to be filled and return immediately
Tell Bartholomew to add it to our debt

Solomon looks at the list
In a careless moment, Solomon reads quietly from it
He catches himself, but not before the Mistress notes his action
With high : Where yah from, Platt

Tell me again

Master name of Freeman

And any more'll earn yah a hun'red lashes
Having delivered her cool advice, Mistress heads back into the house
A101 A101 - Solomon walks along a well-worn path, shopping bag draped over one shoulder
We see his feet
As the walk slowly gathers pace, Solomon suddenly turns left into dense foliage
His tread is now a full blown sprint, trees flash past as Solomon attacks his way through the woods
The sound of branches cracking underneath
His feet, heartbeat and breath almost deafening
He is desperate
The violence of his advance abruptly stops, there is silence
We see in a clearance a posse of patrollers, preparing for a lynching of two young men
Solomon's eyes meet theirs
The two men look back at Solomon with a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose around their neck
Suddenly the bloodhounds start barking and the patrollers turn in the direction of Solomon
Solomon's whole body shakes with anticipation
() Boy, where are you going
(almost tripping over ) To the store, Sir, to Bartholomew's

The patroller reaches out for Solomon's free pass around his neck, yanking him forward
He looks at it
Get there and get there quick
The patroller kicks Solomon hard, sending him on his way
Solomon walks on, looking one more time at the two young men; again there is a moment of connection
Solomon turns
The two men are hoisted up, kicking and spitting, behind his shoulder
Solomon finds himself back on the trail walking towards Bartholomew's, his face now full of shock and () 68A

He walks, fighting to calm himself down
We move behind him as he continues his journey, a lonely figure

Solomon stands at the counter as  fills Mistress Epps's order
Among the items set before Solomon is a The items are collected for Solomon and placed in a sack
Solomon giving little thought to them other than getting them back to the mistress
As he turns, he glimpses the regalia of slave restraints, of all different guises; chains, muzzles for sale

It makes for a tranquil surreal scene

Running as though his life depended on getting to his destination in beyond a timely manner

'  -  B105 Still running, slick with sweat, Solomon comes upon the As Solomon arrives: Platt Epps, good Sunday morning
Good morning, Master Shaw
've been sent by Master to retrieve Patsey
May  approach
You may
Solomon makes his way over to the piazza
Excuse me, Mistress Shaw
Nigger Platt
My apologies
Patsey, Master wishes you to return
Sabbath day
's free ta roam
Understood
But the Master sent me running to fetch you, and said no time should be wasted
Drink tea
Thank you, Mistress, but  don't dare
Would you knowed Massa Epps's consternation ta be any lessened wit your timely return
Sit
Sit and drink the tea that offered

B105 : B105 Solomon knows better, but he sits and the Mistress has tea poured for him
(') What'n was Epps's concern
'd rather not say
'il gossip on the Sabbath be fine
All things in moderation
Solomon is not sure what to say
He struggles to be as diplomatic as possible
As you are aware, Master Epps can be a man of a hard countenance
There are times when it is impossible to account for his logic
You know he has ill feelings toward your husband
He do
Master Epps has somehow come to believe, as incorrectly as it may be, that Master Shaw is
That he is something of a lothario and an unprincipled man
misguided belief born out of their mutual competition as planters, no doubt
No doubt
if not born outta truth itself
The Mistress waves to Shaw
Shaw, unsuspecting of the conversation, waves back
'm certain Patsey's well being is Master Epps's only concern
Nothin' Epps desire come outta concern
meant no disrespect
He ain't heard you
() 71
B105 : (2) B105 meant no disrespect to you, Mistress
Ha
You worry for me
Got no cause to worry for my sensibilities
ain't felt the end of a lash in 'mo years than cain recall
Ain't worked a field, neither
Where one time served, now  got others servin' me
The cost to my current existence be Massa Shaw broadcasting his affections, 'n me enjoyin' his pantomime of fidelity
If that what keep me from the cotton pickin' niggers, that what it be
small and reasonable price to be paid 'fo sure
Looking toward Patsey, speaking with great empathy: (') knowed what it like to be the object of Massa's predilections and peculiarities
And  knowed they can get expressed with kindness or wit violence
lusty visit in the night, or a visitation from the whip
And wit my experience, if'n  can give comfort, then comfort  give
And you take comfort, Patsey; the Good Lord will manage Epps
In His own time the Good Lord will manage dem all
Yes, Lordy, there's a day comin' that will burn as an oven
It comin' as sure as the Lord is just
When His will be done
the curse on the Pharos is a poor example of all that wait 'fo the plantation class
Mistress Shaw turns her head to the side, catching a slave's attention
As she does so, the slave, a , commences to pour tea
As if to punctuate her thought, the Mistress takes a sip of her tea

Waiting on the porch of the Great House, a drunk Epps beckons for Patsey, his lewd intentions obvious

Do not look in his direction
Continue on
Epps does not care to be ignored
He lifts himself and moves toward the pair in a rage
Patsey
Solomon moves between Epps and Patsey, cutting Epps off as Patsey continues on
Playing up his "ignorance" of : Found her, Master, and brought her back just as instructed
What'd you jus now tell her
What'd you say to Pats
No words were spoken
None of consequence
Lie
Damned liar
Saw you talkin' with 'er
Tell me
cannot speak of what did not occur
Epps grabs Solomon
'll cut your black throat
Solomon pulls away from Epps, Epps gives chase
Solomon begins to run around the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance
Epps, however is undeterred
He moves after Solomon as speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all
And quickly he tires
Epps is forced to bend over and suck air
Solomon maintains his distance, barely breathing hard
His breath returned to him, Epps starts up the chase again
Solomon runs on out of reach
Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath
And now in what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after Solomon
Again, Epps's vigor leaves him before he can even get close to the slave
Dropping down to the dirt, in a show of regret and piety: () 73

Platt, liquor filled me
admit that it did, and  done over reacted
It's the Lord's day
Ain't nothin' Christian in us carryin' on like this
Help me ta my feet, and let us both pray to the Lord for forgiveness
Epps extends a hand to Solomon
Cautiously, Solomon moves close, but not too close
As Solomon draws within striking distance, Epps lunges for him
He chases Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more drops down
And again offering a treaty: (') 'm all done in, Platt
have met my limitations, and  ain't equal to 'em
concede to yah, but in the name of valor, help yer master to his feet
Solomon cautiously moves closer to help
Again he is attacked by Epps - this time by knife
Sort of
Epps is too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade - and chased far around the field by Epps Mistress Epps comes running from the house to the pair
What
Wha's the fuss
misunderstanding is all
It began when  was sent to retrieve Patsey from where she'd taken sabbatical at Master Shaw's
Upon returning, Master Epps believed Patsey and me to be in conversation when we were not tried to explain, but it lead to all this
What is it
Ya cain't remain the Sabbath without her under your eye
Ya are a no-account bastard
Hold a moment

Of yer misbegotten ways
And he would know what of anythin'

Discretion being the better part and all, Solomon remains silent
(') There; there's all the truth he got
Damned nigger
Damn yah
Epps pushes his way past the Mistress
106 106 ' / - -, 1844- With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are working the field picking cotton
As before , the only thing that distracts them from the tedium at hand
But there is no distracting from the heat
We see Henry begin to falter before it
And eventually collapse right in the dirt
Though the other slaves take note, none move to help him
None dare
From Treach rather matter of factly: Get him water
Edward runs to fetch a gourd
He carries it to Henry, , Roused, Henry rights himself
Go'won
Git up
Unsteadily, Henry lifts himself and goes back to picking cotton
He joins in again with the spiritual, as if the song is all that can keep him going
107 107 ' /  - -, 1844- () 75
107 : 107 The slaves are asleep
Epps arrives, again without knocking, with his whip in hand
The slaves stir
Uncle : We dance tonight, massa
Epps remains quietly focused on Patsey
And it's clear from her apprehensive expression just what it is he's come looking for
This time there is no escaping it
As if to acknowledge the badness to come, Phebe lightly cries
108 108 ' /  - On top of a wood pile, in the back of the smoke house - Epps shoves Patsey
He stops, stands as if gathering his manhood, then he's all over Patsey
He is rough and clumsy
It looks like something between an awkward rape and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter
Patsey does not respond in any way other than to continually turn her head from Epps, but otherwise remain as still as possible
If there is such a thing, she is vicious with her passive aggressiveness
Epps's frustration mounts until - as the Mistress Shaw had cautioned - he crosses the line from passion to violence
He begins slapping Patsey to get a response from her
When that fails, he punches her which only leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey Still, she gives him nothing
Beaten, Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, Epps deep breathing above her
The desire for sex now having left him
Epps heads from the field
Patsey is left where she is
109 109 ' - -, 1844- As before, Solomon waits as Bartholomew fills Mistress Epps order
Among the items set before Solomon is another quantity of foolscap
110 110 - Solomon is making his way back to the Epps plantation
He carries with him a sack filled with the goods from the store
As he walks,
When he is certain he is alone, he sets down the sack, opens it and appropriates       which he folds and places in his pocket
That done, he cinches up the sack and continues on his way

' /  -  112 Solomon takes the slip of paper and hides it within his fiddle
Perhaps the safest place he can think of
He acts as though he's hiding away found gold
In reality it's more than that
For Solomon the paper is a first step toward freedom
113 113 ' /  - -, 1844- It's another night of Epps's forced revelry
Coming in quick from the previous scene, we go from Solomon holding his fiddle, to playing it as the slaves are again made to dance
Mistress Epps brings out a tray of freshly baked pastries
She sets them down on a table
moment from the dancing
Come sample what  baked for y'all
The slaves, thankful for the rest as much as the food, file toward the tray reciting a chorus of "Thank you, Mistress
" As Patsey moves toward the pastries: (') There'll be none for you, Patsey
Patsey merely turns away
Her non responsiveness, however, serves only to incite the Mistress
Screaming: (') Yah see that
Did yah see the look of insolence she give me
Seen nothin' but her turn away
Are you blind or ignorant
It was hot, hateful scorn
It filled that black face
Yah tell me yah did'n see it, then yah choose not to look, or yah sayin'  lie
Whatever it was, it passed
Is that how yah are with the niggers
Let every ill thought fester inside 'em
Look at 'em
() () 77
113 : 113 (') They foul with it; foul with their hate
You let it be, it'll come back to us in the dark a night
Yah want that
Yah want them black animals to leave us gut like pigs in our own sleep
Epps isn't sure how to respond to the inchoate berating
It's an invitation for the Mistress to continue
(') You are manless
damned eunuch if ever there was
And if yah won't stand for me, 'd pray you'd at least be a credit to yer own kind and beat every foul thought from 'em
Epps does nothing
The Mistress lets her anger loose
She moves quickly to Patsey, '
' , the moment marked with appropriate screams
Patsey collapses on the floor, covering her bleeding face
(') Beat it from 'em
Thoroughly cuckolded by the Mistress's actions, Epps takes his whip and pulls Patsey out of the house
His intentions are plain
All the slaves remain silent
The Mistress, however, displaying high satisfaction, entreats the others: (') Eat
Fill yourselves
And then we dance
The slaves eat, but without a hint of levity
114 114 ' /  - We come up on the slaves who lay sleeping
All except for Patsey
She rises from her bedding, goes to a corner of the cabin and removes something from a secretive location
She then moves over to Platt
Platt
Platt, you awake

() 78
114 : 114 Patsey displays what she took from hiding
It is a '
(') secreted it from the Mistress
Return it
It yours, Platt
For what cause
All  ask: end my life
Take my body to the margin of the swamp-- Solomon looks at Patsey as though she were insane
No
Take me by the throat
Hold me low in the water until 's still 'n without life
Bury me in a lonely place of dyin'
No
will do no such thing
The
the gory detail with which -- thought on it long and hard
It is melancholia, nothing more
How does such despair even come to you
How can you not know
got no comfort in this life
If  cain't buy mercy from yah, 'll beg it
There are others
Beg them
'm begging you
Why
Why would you consign me to damnation with such an un-Godly request
() 79
114 : (2) 114 There is God here
God is merciful, and He forgive merciful acts
Won't be no hell for you
Do it
Do what  ain't got the strength ta do myself
Solomon says nothing
Clearly he's not about to do the deed
With nothing else to do, knowing she is damned with every breath she draws, Patsey crawls back to her spot on the floor and lays herself down
115 115 ' / - -, 1846- Hard times on the planation
Where previously the field in bloom was a carpet of white, it is now patchy and under grown
The slaves move through the field picking not cotton, but rather   from the plants
The cotton worms have dined on the cotton and nearly destroyed the crop
We see the cotton worms in extreme close-up, moving among and destroying the cotton crop
Epps is beside himself as he looks out over his ruined field
It is a plague
(
) Cotton worm
plague
It's damn Biblical
Two season God done sent a plague to smite me
am near ruination
Why, Treach
What  done that God hate me so
Do  not preach His word
(
) The whole Bayou sufferin'
don't care nothin' fer the damn Bayou

Epps looks among his slaves at work, his enmity growing
(') It's that Godless lot
They brought this on me
bring 'em () () 80
115 : 115 (') God's word, and heathens they are, they brung me God's scorn
Crazed, Epps runs into the field, taking himself from slave to slave delivering a whipping to all he can lay his hands on
(') Damn you
Damn you all
Damn you

'  -  117 -, 1846- Henry, Bob, Uncle Abram and Solomon sit in the back of a cart
Epps has delivered the men to  , a distinguished man and extensive planter whose large estate is situated on Bayou Salle within a few miles of the gulf
Epps and Turner stand off to one side engaged in bargaining as Henry, Bob, Uncle Abram and Solomon wait and watch
One of the slaves whisper under their breath
' hear cutting cane is twice as hard as picking cotton
But at least we'll be away from Master Epps
Boy, you two have no sense
Epps returns to his slaves and gives a parting salutation
Yer Judge Turner's for the season
More if need be, until my crop return
Yah'll bring no disrespect to me, and yah'll bring no biblical plagues to him
Be decent, ere mark my words,  will deliver an ungodly whippin'

118 : 118 Slaves are crammed into the shack - - as they try to sleep
Some lay, some sit up
Packed in like cattle, there is barely room to move let alone draw a deep, clean breath
There is a real risk of suffocating in the mass
Some cough and wheeze
Among them is Solomon who must believe at this point that his life has reached its very lowest point
The odds of survival are slight, let alone the chance of actually ever returning to his family
This clearly weighs on him as he struggles to find anything like comfortable space in the pen
119 119 - An  is explaining to the new slaves - - how to cultivate cane he demonstrates the process: Draw the cane from the rick, cut the top and flags from the stalk, understand
Leave only that part which is sound and healthy
Cast off the rest
120 120 - -, 1846- are working the field
They are divided into
The first which draw the cane, the next lay the cane in the drill, the last then hoe the rows after
Solomon is among a gang that draws and cuts, and he moves with speed and skill
Certainly more so than he displayed picking cotton
Standing with his overseer, Judge Turner watches
121 121 - Again, the slaves have been herded into the shack and pressed together
As he tries to rest - sleep is nearly impossible - Solomon finds himself face to face with a woman,
She is awake
For a few beats she avoids eye contact with Solomon
She seems, like Solomon, to be unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened by them
Eventually her eyes meet Solomon's
She makes no sound, but great apprehension spills from her eyes
Whatever's next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely stand to face
Fear, proximity
They drive her hand () 81A
121 : 121 to Solomon's
After a moment of seemingly reacquainting herself with genuine human contact, the woman () 82

Solomon tries to jerk his hand away, but
Manipulating Solomon's hand, she begins to massage her breast
Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act - really, neither does Anna ,     , The need quickly compounds
Anna presses her lips to Solomon's
Eventually, Solomon, with slightly more compassion than a guy making union wages, The act remains more perfunctory than passionate
We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual release
But more - or substantially less - than joyous sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against reality
But the feeling quickly fades
All that remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret
And there is shame, too
This is put on display as Anna turns away from Solomon
As quickly as it began, it is as though the act had not happened at all
122 122 123
' /  -  123 Solomon waits outside the house on the porch
house servant -  - approaches and admonishes Solomon
Off the porch
Get off
Like a dog shooed away, Solomon steps down
Eventually Judge Turner exits the house and crosses to Solomon
Sir
Platt is it
Have you cultivated cane previously
No, sir,  have not
You take to it quite naturally
Are you educated
() 83
123 : 123 Niggers are hired to work, not to read and write
Turner gives that a bit of consideration as he gives Solomon a wary looking over
You play the fiddle

Willard Yarney, a planter up the bayou, celebrates his anniversary in a three week's time
will hold out your name to him
What you earn is yours to keep
Sir
Mind yourself, Platt
Yes, sir

As Solomon eats, he takes note of the 125
'  -  (  125) 125 Solomon plays with a piece of cane, fashions it into some kind of writing tool, testing it in the mud
He then brushes over the dirt with his hand
84
126
-  (  126) 126 Secreted away out near the edge of the bayou and sitting by a small fire, Solomon takes the slip of paper from his fiddle
It is yellowed, showing age, but still usable
Dipping the piece of cane - a quill - into the crushed berries, Solomon attempts to write a bit on the paper
The berry juice, too free-flowing, is unusable as ink
Solomon returns the paper to the fiddle
He has some scraps of food with him, which he snacks on
A127 A127 A127A
-  A127A We see a sharp object scratching onto a surface
The tool moves on to form another mark
The sound is repetitive and almost unbearable
As we move out, we see the names Anne, Margaret, Alonzo
They are engraved onto the violin, in the hidden area where Solomon would rest his chin
Solomon looks at it for a moment, moving his fingertips across the engraving
His face full of loss
Sadly, he lifts his instrument under his chin and leaning his head to the side as if to play
127
'  -  127 party has commenced at the noble home of one
group of  have gathered and are on the dance floor, in fancy dress
Their faces are covered with a variation of decorative masks
The party is a feast of celebration
As entertainment, , no more than three
And as he does so, they all play with jovial liveliness
Clearly a good time is being had by all
128 128 - His playing done for the evening, Solomon is returning to Judge Turner's on foot
There is only the moonlight with which to light the way
As he walks, Solomon eats from a Obviously part of his haul from the evening
Solomon again hears noises coming from the brush just up ahead of him
Solomon tears off some of the bread, kneels and holds it out before him
'mere
'mon, boy
() 85
128 : 128 This time, there is no dog
Instead, from the dark and the brush step
Solomon stands
He looks the men over - their clothes tatters and they themselves covered in dirt
It becomes quite clear they are not just slaves
fact confirmed when they step menacingly toward Solomon,
At first it seems they want Solomon's food or money
Worse,
Solomon has but a moment to brace himself before he is attacked,
Solomon fights back, and striking his attacker over the head
That takes the fight out of him, and both men retreat back the way they came leaving Solomon be
A129 A129 - Outside of the slave shacks Solomon's wound tended by Uncle Abram
As he works on it: Runaways  would expect
The Bayou full with 'em
They nothin' 'mo dangerous than a nigger in flight
They acted out of desperation
Act outta lunacy
Heads fulla stories 'bout life up north
Yah ever been north, Platt
No
And never should yah be

-  130 -/, 1847- Alone out on the edge of the Bayou, Solomon is playing a low air on his violin
As he plays, something appears in the distance
From the edge of the bayou, coming forth like an apparition arisen from the earth, is
She is a young woman of about 19 years of age and far whiter than most blacks
" " Beyond that, she is pale and haggard, but still lovely
Dressed in a white gown, she emerges from the water
Draped on her dress, her period
line in her skirt
It's very visible, but not shocking
ribbon of red in her dress
Celeste moves to Solomon without fear or hesitation
As Solomon, startled, takes her in, Celeste says quite : am hungry
Give me food
Who are you
'm hungry
Solomon gives Celeste some of his food
Celeste, famished, devours it
What is your name
My name is Celeste
What are your circumstances
belong ta Massa Carey, and 'ave been two days among da palmettoes
Celeste is sick and cain't work, and would rather die in the swamp () () 87
130 : 130 (') than be whipped to death by the overseer
So  took myself away
Massa's dogs won't follow me
The patrollers 'ave tried to set dem on me
But dey a secret between dem and Celeste, and dey won't mind the devilish orders of the overseer
Celeste lifts her head from the food on which she gnaws
(') Do you believe me
Yes
Why
There are some whose tracks the hounds will refuse to follow
Give me more food
'm starvin'
This is all my allowance for the -- Give it to me
Almost as if compelled, Solomon does as ordered
As she eats, Celeste aggrandizes herself: (') Most slaves escape at night
The overseers are alert for such chicanes
But Celeste tricked dem 'n alight in the middle of the day wit the sun up at its highest
The place of my concealment now deep in the swamp, not half a mile from Massa's plantation, and a world apart
world a tall trees whose long arms make fo' a canopy so dense dey keep away even the beams of the sun
It twilight always in Celeste's world, even in the brightest day
will live there, and  will live freely
The overseers are a cowardly lot
Dey will not go where their dogs show fear and where it always be night
Others will join me in the twilight, and we ain't gunna be slaves no 'mo forever
() 88
130 : (2) 130 Solomon isn't sure what to say
Before he can say : (') Celeste will come to you again in the night
You will have food for her
Celeste departs the way she came; as though she were a vision
131 131 ' /  - Solomon stealthfully makes his way into the storage shed
Dried and smoked meats are hung, and milled corn is about
Taking out a handkerchief, Solomon begins to load it with food
Not too much
Not so much his thievery will be readily noticed, but he does avail himself
132 132 - Solomon plays his violin, but plays it with an anxious nature as he waits
Then, as before, a figure appears in the distance
It is Celeste coming out of the night
She makes her way directly to Solomon
With no greeting, she says: am hungry
Solomon gives Celeste the handkerchief he's filled
She opens it, and begins to devour the food
As she eats: (') was rude, and didn't even ask yo name
Platt
() Solomon
Solomon is my true and free name
Was you free
was

Solomon exposes his wrist, displays his tattoo as he : (') remain free in my heart
() 89
132 : 132 Giving a laugh as though it's the silliest thing she's : Free heart means nothin if'n yo body gunna die a slave
will not
How
Celeste knows you ain't gunna run
Celeste knows it ain't your nature
have a plan
have a letter
letter
How'll yah mail da letter
Who yah trust to post it
nigger that can read and write is a nigger that'll hang
There is a pause
Solomon can't answer this question
It is the glaring hole in his plan
Having finished eating: () 90
132 : (2) 132 (') Celeste will come again in de night
You will bring her 'mo food
risk discovery to take more
You will bring Celeste 'mo food
And with that Celeste again moves back into the darkness

The liquid holds as a form of ink
It is no
t ideal, but it is legible on the page
Armed with this, Solomon writes his letter
138 138 - Solomon sits with Celeste
He relates his news to her
have my letter
Yah has your freedom then
All that remains is to contrive measures by which the letter can safely be deposited in the post office
When Celeste speaks she is quite melancholy
() 91
138 : 138 have resolved to return to my Massa
Solomon gives an unnerved look
This is not good news
Is it more food you need
live in fear
None will come after you in the swamps
It ain't the patrollers  scared of
At all seasons the howling of wild animals can be heard at night along the border of the swamps
At first their calls were welcomin'
Dey too was free, 'n thought dey greeted me like a sistah
Lately, dey cries have turned horrifyin'
They mean to kill Celeste
The solitude plays tricks
It's your impression, nothing more
If you go back to your master you could face the same
My freedom been nothin' but a daydream
So was Celeste's thoughts of slaves conjoinin' in the bayou
Better the loneliness
You have been free most of the summer
Return now and your master will make example of you
It is lonely dwellin' waiting for others who won't never come
() 92
138 : (2) 138 Go north
Make your way by night
It'll only be worse if'n Celeste don't go back of her own will
You won't be caught
The dogs won't track you
You are
you are unique
Celeste
You got alternatives, Solomon
To return is to die
Celeste got no one to write a letter to
As if to punctuate her resolve, without a word more Celeste departs toward the swamp
Solomon starts on into the swamp after her
Celeste
Celeste
Solomon continues after Celeste, wading deeper into the dark night and murky waters
(') Celeste,  will guide you north
Wait, and  will take you
Celeste is too nimble
She outpaces Solomon, continues on and disappears into the night
(') Let me take you
Let me go with you
Solomon runs on, then splashes to a stop
He stumbles around disoriented, calling into the blackness: (') Celeste
Nothing
No answer
Not a human one
There are sounds and echoes - some in the distance, some perhaps moving closer - which, moment by moment, become more and more frightening
Soon, Solomon realizes he is in quite literally over his head; the water first chest deep, then neck deep
With no way to orient himself, no means to guide him in the dark, Solomon's reserve begins to crumble
He thrashes in the water trying to find his way () 93
138 : (3) 138 back to shore
No longer trying to save Celeste, Solomon calls to her - desperately - for assistance
(') Celeste
Come to me, Celeste
In that moment Solomon is quite certain he is nearly done; that he will not find land, nor aid and that this is his final moment
His panic should be that tangible
It is either force of will, or survival instinct
or maybe just pure luck that carries Solomon on until he reaches first muddy ground, then firm footing
Hauling himself onto the swamps edge, Solomon finally collapses in a drenched, worn heap
His life spared, but Celeste never to be seen again
139 139 '  - -/, 1847- We come up now outside of Master Epps's plantation
Epps stands in the drive
He's in surprisingly good spirits as Solomon, Uncle Abram, Henry and Bob trudge their way wearily toward Epps and his other slaves who are gathered
The cotton field is in full bloom, the crop fully returned
joyous day
joyous day
Dark times is behind us
Clean livin' 'n prayer done lifted the plague
Indicating to the cotton: (') As thick 'n white as New England snow
' now my niggers is returned to me

Oh, did you beguile him, Platt, with your slick nigger ways
Well, yah won't stand idle, boy
Not on my land
Much work to do
Days of old long since, eh
Joyous
Joyous indeed
Throughout Epps's welcome, Solomon's focus is on Patsey who is lined up with the other slaves Her face and arms display many new scars
It's clear that in the intervening years she has quite literally been a whipping boy for Epps and the Mistress
94
140
' /  -  140 -, 1847- The slaves are out working on the field
White hands appear, picking cotton:
He is wholly unskilled at picking cotton, and he puts little effort into the job
As we meet him he seems a decent sort if a little short on self-motivation
In anachronistic terminology, he'd be called a "slacker
" He joins in with the slaves, singing a spiritual
141 141 ' /  - As Epps said, it is days of long since
The slaves are back to having their cotton weighed in the Gin House Wiley
Two hundred sixty pounds
Bob
Three hundred forty pounds for Bob
Patsey
Five hundred twenty pounds
Tha's a girl
Don't never let me down
Platt
One hundred sixty pounds
Before Treach is even done announcing the weight, Epps has pulled Solomon aside to where Uncle Abram already awaits his fate
Armsby
Sixty four pounds
Epps speaks to Armsby sternly, but nothing of the manner in which he would address the slaves
() 95
141 : 141 good days labor would average two hundred pounds
Yes, sir
'm sure in time y'll develope as a picker, but it takes effort, boy
Put some damn effort into it
Yes, sir
To Treach, regarding Solomon and Abram: Take 'em out
Get to whippin'
No force is needed
The slaves understand the situation
They follow Treach out of the Gin house
142 142 ' /  - We come in after the punishment has been dealt
Patsey tends to Uncle Abram's back as Armsby applies liniments to Solomon's
As he does, Armsby muses: It's a tragedy
How does such come to pass
Working a field and picking cotton like a lowly hand
'm of a damn sight better station
And my desires never lacked for a grandiose component, though  will admit they have at times been short on ingenuity
But only at times
've worked as an overseer, you know
did not, sir
Not "sir
" Just Armsby
Not owed more than any other in the field
worked plantations from Virginia, down into Alabama could manage easy a hundred slaves and have done so
But to toil in the field
Never thought that would come to pass
Never
But times are desperate
Where once had said "no" to Epps and his merger offerings,  returned cap () () 96

Look at what 've become
How did you arrive at such a place, if  may ask
Ask
It's just conversation
From a pocket Armsby produces a flask
(') became a little too dependant on the whisky, a little too undependable on the job
Before you say 'm just a sorry drunkard, let me state my case: As reliable employment as overseeing is, it's no easy chore on the spirit say no man of conscious can take the lash to another human day in, and day out without shredding at his own self
Takes him to a place where he either makes excuses within his mind to be unaffected
Or finds some way to trample his guilty sensations
Well,  trampled
Armsby takes a drink
(') And with frequency
Where is your place of birth
Maryland
Have you traveled there
cannot say that  have
Fine country
More seasonal than the bayou
deal less humid
Why did you leave it
To make my fortune, of course gave in to tales of wealth and prosperity that were the lore of the southern states: all that's needed being a patch of land and a few good growing seasons
Cotton, () () 97
142 : (2) 142 (') or tobacco
And then locating a proper bank in which to store your riches
But such profitable outcomes are reserved for the plantation masters
It's the lot of the rest of us to serve
So settled on being an overseer, and failed as well at that
In the meantime my dreams gave way to reality
Now,  want nothing more than to earn a decent wage
() And get myself home
Armsby takes another drink and leans back

144
' / -  144 With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are working the field picking cotton
As before they sing a spiritual, the only thing that distracts them from the tedium at hand
But there is no distracting from the heat
We see Uncle Abram begin to falter and finally drop down to the ground
Treach calls to Edward: Get him water
Edward runs to fetch water which he carries to Abram and At this point, the sounds of the singing from the others tapers off as they realize Abram isn't getting up
145 145 ' /  - We are beyond the main of the plantation, the cotton field in the background
We are at the slaves' cemetery, a mixture of crude crosses and unsettled ground
Solomon, Bob and Henry, now much visually older than when we first saw them, are digging a grave in the dirt
The uncovered body of Abram lays near
Having dug down an appropriate distance, the three men take the body and, very unceremoniously, place it into the ground
Holding () 98
145 : 145 the shovel in his hands, and resting it by his feet, Bob tilts his head down and closes his eyes
The others do the same
Almost stutteringly, not really knowing what to -- just want to say something about Uncle Abram
He was a good man and he always looked out for us since we were little
God Bless him
God love him
And God keep him
That done, they begin to cover it with dirt
It is all the more of a funeral that Abram will receive
146 146 147  147 A148
' /  -  A148 female voice appears out of the blackness and begins to sing solo, "Went down to the river Jordan
"  response of "Oh Yeah" quickly follows
Again the singer continues, "where John baptized three
" The same faces we have seen on Epps' plantation, but now filled with rapture, appear
It's as if the voices have created a new form of awakening and presence
It seems to transcend and translate in a strange way, joy
joy which has un-yet been seen on screen
joy which has been hidden, but a joy which is undoubtedly there
It's captivating, infectious
This should be a moving part of the film, which stirs the audience and, for a moment, relieves them of the seemingly chastising environment

Solomon gives a blunt introduction
Re: the : The proceeds of my fiddling performances
few picayunes, but all  have in the world promise them to you if you will do me the favor  require
But  beg you not to expose me if you cannot grant the request
What do you ask
First, your word, sir
On my honor
It is a simple enough request ask only that you deposit a letter in the Marksville post office
And that you keep the action an inviolable secret forever
The details of the letter are of no consequence
Even at that, there would be an imposition of much pain and suffering were it known was the author
patron is what require, sir
Where's the letter now
It is not yet written
will have it in a day
Two at most, my skill with composition as poor as it is
Armsby considers the request
will do it
And will accept whatever payment is offered
Solomon hesitates

151 151 ' /  - Solomon and the slaves pick cotton
Armsby is conspicuously  laboring in the field
As Solomon works he is watched by Epps
Watched more than he normally is
For a moment it seems it might just be a matter of perspective; Solomon's unease over his actions
But soon Epps is joined by Armsby
The two men stand and talk, their looks locked toward Solomon
Whatever it is that is occurring between them continues for a long, long moment
But Epps makes no move toward Solomon
Solomon continues with his work
152 152 ' /  - The slaves are at rest
Gripping his whip Epps enters, without so much as a knock at the door
For a moment there's curiosity; is he there for a dance, for Patsey
Looking right to Solomon: Get up
Solomon does
Epps heads back out into the dark
He says nothing, but his directive is clear: Follow me
153
' /  -  153 Solomon comes out into the dark
Nearly hidden in the shadows is a bitter Epps
Despite the lack of light, Epps's malevolence is quite clear
His whip attached to his hip

That had one that needed close watchin' or he would run away
When  axed him why, he said you come over to him and waked him up in the middle of the night and wanted him to carry a letter to Marksville
What have yah got to say to that
All  have to say, master, is all that need be said
There is no truth in it
You say
How could  write a letter without ink or paper
There is nobody want to write to 'cause  hain't got no friends living as  know of

Now, master, can see what that Armsby is after, plain enough

He wants to make you believe we're all going to run away and then he thinks you'll hire an overseer to watch us
He believes you are soft soap
He's given to such talk
believe he's just made this story out of whole cloth, 'cause he wants to get a situation
It's all a lie, master, you may depend on't
It's all a lie
For a tense moment we are unsure which way Epps'll go
Increasingly it become apparent that, shallow minded and equally soused, Solomon has been able to fold Epps's thoughts
In a low curse that clearly states his ill intentions
() 102
153 : (3) 153 Revealed is a pocket knife, which all through the conversation, unknown to us the audience, was pushed up against Solomon's stomach
As Epps speaks, he closes it and taps it on Solomon's shoulder

Were he not free and white, Platt
Were he not free and white
Epps heads off
Solomon is left to exhale a deep breath
154 154 ' / - Having found a lonely spot, Solomon has struck a He has in his hand his letter
With no ceremony, he casts the letter upon the flames and watches it burn
And with it, at this time, seems all chance of him ever being free

B155 B155 ' /  - As the slaves continue to work, there is a conversation going on between Epps and Bass
Bass much skilled in the art of sophistry, while Epps's arguments are fueled mostly by emotion alone
Though at first Epps does little more than joke his way around the facts
Solomon, working still, can't help but overhear as Epps offers Bass a drink, which Bass waves away
Take it
You look unsettled

No shame in taking respite from the heat; drink, shade

All wrong, sir

If the conversation concerns what is factual and what is not; there's no justice nor righteousness in slavery wouldn't own a slave if  was rich as Croesus, which  am not, as is perfectly well understood

There's another humbug: the credit system

But this question of slavery; what right have you to your niggers when you come down to the point
What right
bought 'em
paid for 'em
Of course you did
The law says you have the right to hold a nigger, but begging the law's pardon
it lies
Is everything right because the law allows it
Suppose they'd pass a law taking away your liberty and making you a slave
Ha
Suppose
That ain't a supposable case
Because the law states that your liberties are undeniable
Because society deems it so
Laws change
Social systems crumble
Universal truths are constant
It is a fact, it is a plain fact that what is true and right is true and right for all
White and black alike
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Yah compare me to a nigger, Bass
Yah might as well ask what the difference is between a white man and a baboon
Now,  seen one of them critters in Orleans that knowed just as much as any nigger  got
Yah'd call them fellers citizens, s'pose
Look here; you can't laugh me down in that way
These niggers are human beings

That will not go unpunished forever
There will be a reckoning yet
You like to hear yourself talk, Bass, better than any man  know of
Yah'd argue that black was white, or white black if anybody would contradict you
fine supposition if yah lived among Yankees in New England
But yah don't

155 155 '  - It's the Sabbath
The slaves are left to themselves to do their own chores
At the moment the female slaves are washing their clothes in large cauldrons, slapping their clothes against washing boards and hanging them up to dry near to their living quarters behind the plantation
It is a sight of ritual
Missing from the field of labor is Patsey, for whom Epps hollers

Eventually Epps drops into true sorrow

156 156 '  - Epps sits on the piazza looking quite forlorn
He looks up only to see
Epps steps up to greet her, with anger rather than relief
As they hear his angry voice, the slaves step around from where they are hanging their laundry to dry
Treach is near as well
Run off
Run off, did you

In short order he returns with the rope in hand

Mistress Epps has now come from the Great House
She gazes on the scene with an air of heartless satisfaction
Now tied to the post, Epps stands behind Patsey with his whip
(') Yah done this to yerself, Pats
Epps hoists the whip to strike, holds it high
but no matter his rage, Epps cannot bring himself to deliver the blow
He looks to Mistress Epps who now stands gloating and spurring him on
Do it
Strike the life from her
Epps again hoists the whip
It trembles in his hand ahead of the act
But he does not have it in him to deliver such a beating
Turning to Solomon, thrusting the whip at him: Beat her
Solomon doesn't move
Epps shoves the whip into his hand
(') Give her the whip
Give it all to her
Patsey, begging to Solomon: 'd rather it you, Platt
Strike her, or yah'll get the same
() 109
156 : (4) 156 Solomon takes a step back
He unfurls the whip
He begins to whip Patsey
Lash after lash, Patsey squirms before it
Epps eyes fill with tears, he is nearly too distraught to watch
But the Mistress
She is not satisfied with Solomon's half-hearted effort
He pantomimes
There ain't barely a welt on her
That's what your niggers make of yah; a fool fer the takin'
Epps's grief is replaced by fury '  and draws down on the slaves
Yah will strike her
Yah will strike her until her flesh is rent and meat and blood flow equal, or will kill every nigger in my sight
Solomon can't strike a blow, even if it means his life
But from the ground, from Patsey: Do it, Platt
Don't stop until am dead
What else can he do
Solomon begins to whip, to truly whip Patsey
Her back welts, then tears
Patsey screams in agony
Solomon strikes again and again
After a full thirty lashes Solomon looks to Epps, who is not satisfied
Until  say no more
ain't said nothing
Solomon strikes another ten to fifteen times
By now, as promised, Patsey's back has been reduced to Finally, Solomon holds low the whip
He can and will do no more
(') Strike her
Strike her
Solomon will not
Epps takes up the whip and whips Patsey with "ten fold" greater force than he had
The painfully loud and angry curses of Epps load the air
Patsey by now is terribly lacerated, literally flayed
The lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and dropped upon the ground
At length Patsey ceases struggling
Her head sinks listlessly on the ground
() 110
156 : (5) 156 Her screams and supplications gradually decrease and die away into a low moan
It would seem that she was dying
Solomon, screaming at Epps: Thou devil
Sooner or later, somewhere in the course of eternal justice thou shalt answer for this sin
Though Epps fronts rage, there should be underlying anguish for what he has done to his beloved Pats
No sin
There is no sin
man does how he pleases with his property
At the moment, Platt, am of great pleasure
You be goddamn careful  don't come to wantin' to lightenin' my mood no further
By contrast to this horror, the field of cotton smiles in the warm sunlight
The birds chirp merrily amidst the foliage of the tress
Peace and happiness seems to reign everywhere
Everywhere else
Epps leaves Patsey to herself
He says not a word to the Mistress as he passes
The Mistress herself heads back into the house
Solomon unties Patsey, lifts her and takes her to the cabin
157 157 - Patsey is laid on some boards where she remains for a long time with eyes closed and groaning in agony
Phebe applies melted tallow to her wounds, and all try to assist and console her
In time Patsey opens her eyes
She looks to Solomon
She does not say a word
She just looks at him
and then her eyes close again

' / / - 160 -, 1852- Solomon and Bass are working together alone on the extension
From the amount of work that's been done on it, it should be obvious that days have now passed
Solomon makes a cautious approach to Bass
As casually as he can he inquires: Master Bass,  want to ask you what part of the country you came from
No part of this land
was born in Canada
Now guess where that is
Oh,  know where Canada is have been there myself
Have you
Montreal and Kingston and Queenston and a great many places
And  have been in York state, too
Buffalo and Rochester and Albany, and can tell you the names of the villages on the Erie canal and the Champlain canal
Bass gives Solomon a long and curious stare
Well traveled for a slave
How came you here
Master Bass, if justice had been done  never would have been here
How's this
Tell me all about it
am afraid to tell you, though don't believe you would tell Master Epps if  should
Every word you speak is a profound secret

Hasn't he heard the same promise before
Prior to Solomon stating his case,   : 161
'  /  -  161 Hours have passed
Bass reflects on the story that Epps has told in the intervening
How many years all told
Just nearly
just passed eleven
Your story is
it is amazing, and in no good way
Do you believe, sir, in justice as you have said
do
That slavery is an evil that should befall none
believe so
If you truly do,  would ask would beg that you write my friends in the north, acquainting them with my situation and beseeching them to forward free papers, or take such steps as they might consider proper to secure my release
Bass looks at Solomon, holding his gaze for more than a prolonged beat
(') My daughter Margaret is possibly now 19 and my son Alonzo, 16 miss them so
It would be an unspeakable happiness to clasp my wife and my family again
Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the conversation by work
They both lift it toward the floorboards
Finally Bass speaks
() 116
161 : 161 have always forgone relationships and family
did once have a sweetheart who  loved deeply
Bass points to a measuring tool, which Solomon immediately hands over
(') But that was a long, long time ago
've been traveling this country for the best part of twenty years
My freedom is everything
The fact that  can walk out of here tomorrow gives me most pleasure
see the aching in your eyes, the pain of not being attached to your loved ones
My life doesn't mean much to anyone, but it seems your life means a lot to a lot of people
What you have just said to me scares me, and must say, sir,  am afraid
Not just for you, but for me
They continue working, fixing the floorboards in unison
Solomon, slightly confused
(') will write your letter sir, for if  could bring freedom to you, it will be more than a pleasure
It will be a duty
Now, would you be so kind as to pass me those nails, sir
We pull back to reveal the two men dwarfed by the unfinished structure
They continue to work, as if the conversation had never occurred

A165 Solomon walks a path he has walked a thousand times or more on his way back from Bartholomew's - sack familiarly slung over his right shoulder
Drearily he walks
His eyes acknowledge something we yet cannot see to his left
Almost simultaneously, his eyes retract back to the path () 116A

As he passes out of shot, the evidence of what he was looking at is revealed

Slaves continue to work on it
As they do so, Bass peels away from the structure to have an overview
He beckons Solomon toward him, out of earshot from the slaves who are continuing to work on the gazebo
As Solomon approaches, Bass shouts- And bring those markers
Solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and approaches Bass
(') No letter yet
You are certain
Bass takes a marker from Solomon and slides it into the earth

More than is safe for either of us
Bass takes another and pokes it into the ground, improvising a pathway towards the gazebo

Solomon's understanding of the finality of the situation should be very clear
(') You must know, wherever  am will press your cause
Five months
On top of these years
No cause remains
If there is any chance
Mr
Bass
will continue to write your -- Go home knowing you have tried
The weight of defeat should hang very heavily with both men
Nothing more to do, nothing more to say ' ,   , knowing full well he cannot be seen making contact with a slave
But in the strength of their collective grip, in the emotion in which they hold each other's eyes, we should be able to easily see how greatly Bass wanted to be able to help Solomon
Equally, we can see the depth of regard Solomon has for Bass
The moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither man can openly speak his regret or thanks
moment longer, and then Bass releases his grip and makes his way marching toward the gazebo, pointing instructions
Solomon is left, markers in hand, alone

'  -  A168 Solomon sits on a secluded part of the road, fiddle in hand
He stares across the expanse
His eyes fixed on something that is a million miles away
Slowly Solomon tunes his fiddle, turning the tuning peg tighter and tighter
As the strings are taut, the sound is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit, as if bones are being cracked one by one
Just beyond the breaking point of sound, there is a snap
He then repeats the action
Solomon holds the neck of the violin
Sliding his thumb and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it at the base
He carefully snaps the neck and removes it from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the ground
He then starts on the body
Heaving it on the ground, it falls apart
Methodically he breaks the violin into small bits - silencing the instrument with a hushed display of violence, rather than aggressive
Seems almost to be, in an odd way, respectful

This is Solomon Northup, a resident of Saratoga Springs,
To hell with that
My nigger, and 'll fight you for 'em
As is your right
As it will be my pleasure to bankrupt you in the courts
Your decision
By this time, the slaves in the plantation have overcome their fear of penalty, and left their work and gathered in the yard as witnesses
They stand behind the cabin, out of sight of Epps
Mistress Epps also bears witness, standing on the veranda next to her house slave
Her face is of a strange mixed emotion
Epps looks to Solomon
Solomon icily, stoically holds his ground
He makes it quite clear in his countenance that nobody owns him
Sheriff, hand on his gun, is there to back Solomon up
Epps, with no other recourse than to : You think this is the last you'll see of me, boy
It ain't

Epps walks back into the plantation
The trio starts for the carriage
Solomon is pulled back by the call of Patsey's voice: Platt
Disregarding Parker, Solomon crosses over to Patsey
Under the circumstances, neither really knows how to engage
Finally, suddenly, Patsey throws her arms around Solomon and they embrace
Epps, now mounted on his horse, witness the encounter
Kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse, he rides off furiously
Calling from the carriage, mindful of Epps: Solomon
if we know what's wise, we should depart

They separate, Solomon heading back to the carriage
He and Parker alight
The Sheriff chides the horses and they () 121

As they move on, Patsey sinks down to the ground, where she remains in a weary and half-reclining state, the other slaves around her
Solomon as he travels further and further from the slaves - who are diminished by distance
Solomon waves a hand to them, but the carriage rounds a bend and a thicket of trees hides them from his eyes forever more
A169 A169 - -, 1853- We now see Solomon in front of a door

Solomon, aged significantly since then, stands nervously, swallowing, and adjusting his attire
He breaths in and holds his breath
He blows out and closes his eyes tear falls from his cheek, but this is not the way he wants his family to see him
He gathers himself, and looks to his right
There stands Mr
Parker

The fact his grandson carries his name, is overwhelming
Solomon breaks down
Emotionally, physically
But As she holds him, Solomon says to Anne with all his heart: (') Forgive me
There is nothing to forgive
The pair, joined now by the whole family, hold on to each other for life

The case was tried in Washington, where blacks were prohibited by law from testifying () 123
