He has a Doctorate from and is staring intently into a large bank of computer screens
An elevator door opens and     come out of the elevator carrying large file boxes
They walk down a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of the trading floor
The scope of the floor now comes into frame
There are more computers than can be imagined and several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling thousands of numbers
gives a knowing glance to the guy sitting next to him,  , a young analyst in his early twenties
Is that them
(nods yes) Jesus Christ
The   people turn and separate into a large glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as almost every person on the floor watches
(cont'd) Are they going to do it right there
Yeah
Fuck me
, sitting next to them, leans back in his chair
(whispered) Have you guys ever seen this before
No
Best to just ignore it
Keep your head down and get back to work
and don't watch

It is brutal
The camera follows one woman, , with her piece of paper down the hall and into a row of employees, she walks right past the then stops a bit down from them
Timothy Singh
Yes
'm afraid we have to speak with you
gets up and walks back towards the conference room with the woman
puts on his headphones and very loud drowns out all other noise and  tries to get lost back into the numbers on his computer screen
The sequence follows the  people walking around and firing people intercut with  just staring at his computer screen
It runs for almost the length of the song until finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and stops behind  and taps him on the shoulder
He takes off his headphones and the
He is shell-shocked

Excuse me
Eric Dale
No

The firm has worked out its transition plan and is prepared to move forward, but we appreciate your concern
We understand that this is very difficult and here is my card

While we appreciate your concern, this is not your problem anymore
Alright
Good luck

He packs up the last of his things, which does not take long, then stands and gets ready to walk out
He looks around and heads out into the cubicle area

just wanted to say thank you
That's not necessary
Well it is
You were the person around here that
looks at him and understands
turns around and begins to walk back toward his desk

turns back and  reaches into one of his boxes and takes out a small key chain portable hard drive and hands it to
(cont'd) was close to something here
But they wouldn't let me finish it
Take a look
The elevator doors open and  gets into the elevator
Just as the doors are closing he says
(cont'd) Be careful
The doors close

gently knocks on the door, enters then sits on the couch
Well, that was fucking hideous

Got any nicorettes

You alright
My dog is dying
'm sorry
Just spoke to the vet, it's some fucking tumor on her liver
'm paying almost a thousand bucks a day to keep her alive
Really
Yeah
and  don't have a clue what to do about it
They both sit in silence and look out the window
Well they're all gone
How many do we have left
Thirty-three
Make sure everyone is out there,  need to say something
They are ready for you

looks as if he may not move, then snaps out of it

Now just thirty-three are scattered throughout the vast mostly empty space
They all look up in silence at him
Long pause, then ' face begins to glow a bit
His posture straightens, he fills up
He speaks slowly at first then builds
You are all still here for a reason
Most of this floor was just sent home
forever
We have spent the last hour saying good-bye
they were good people and they were good at their jobs
but you all were better
Now they are gone
They are not to be thought of again
This is your opportunity
On every floor of this building and in every office from Hong Kong to London the same thing is happening
Before this is all done 3 of every ten guys who were standing between you and your boss's job are now gone
That is your opportunity
've been at this place for thirty-four years and let me tell you that this will not be the last time you go through this
But you all are survivors
And that is how this firm over 107 years has always continued to grow stronger
So hold your heads high
and get back to work
He looks out at them then turns and heads back into his office and closes the door

His eyes no longer believe what he says

There are other people streaming out the door doing the same thing
stops, turns, and looks up at the building then tries to make a phone call but his phone does not work as it has been shut off by the firm
He looks up to the sky and can't believe his fate
As he looks down he sees a woman, , serious, classically beautiful and dressed in a well tailored power suit with her head down walking into the building
He can't help himself

does not respond
(cont'd) Sarah Robertson
This time she looks up
When she sees him she debates if she should stop
She does
He slowly moves a little closer to her, still carrying the slightly tattered box with his personal belongings in it
(cont'd) You shut off my phone
Eric
didn't do anything
They stare at each other
Fuck you
They look at each other for a longer beat, both a little shocked that  was so openly confrontational
She turns and heads back inside quickly
drops the phone to the ground and walks away

is sitting at his desk holding the portable hard drive
is getting ready to leave behind him
stares down at the drive in his hand trying to decide whether to proceed
You ok
Yeah
Just a little freaked out
You want to get a drink
Nah,  need to clean up a few things around here
Everyone is going out
come on

Well, give me a call if you change your mind
will
Come on
Where are you going
The Grand
'll call you when 'm done
Be glad, you're still alive
am
walks out and  puts on his headphones, the kicks in again
He picks up the portable hard drive, looks around and sees no one, then inserts it into his computer
He has four large screens in front of him and as he begins opening window upon window of mathematical models his face begins to soften and he gets into his comfort zone
The frame is filled with the extremely complex programs and numbers flying by
: - 11                                                                   11 is sitting next to the exam table, his dog is on the table lying down very sedated

Figures cross frame and occasionally another banker in the group stops to refill his drink with one of the three bottles in ice buckets on the table in front of them
They are celebrating, but it seems a little forced

He is now wearing glasses and the numbers on the screen are reflected in them
The numbers finally stop moving on the screen and then he takes his glasses off and rubs his eyes
14                                                                  14 is still sitting next to his dog on the exam table

(to himself as he dials) Come on, come on
The number you have called has been disconnected and is no longer in service
Fuck
hangs up the phone
He looks back at the screen
Then picks up the phone again and dials

You have to go get him, and get back up here

The office
What
'm serious
You want me to get our boss's boss out of a club and bring him back to the office at 10:00 on a Thursday night

Why

Alright, we'll be there in ten

The lights are down and there is a cleaning person vacuuming in the far background
They walk over to ' desk
Hey, look who it is, burning the candle at both ends
There aren't anymore cuts planned though, so you can stop kissing my ass, honestly  don't even understand what you guys do
Will,  am so sorry to call you back but really think
Don't worry about it
Hey
is a bit drunk but  looks at ' face and realizes something is up
(cont'd) What's going on
Look at this
comes around and sits at ' desk
(cont'd) Eric gave me this file before he left
Eric
Dale
And he told me he couldn't quite figure it out, then the last thing he says as the doors on the elevator close is `be careful'
Be careful
So 'm obviously a little curious
So get into it a bit and  realize that all he was missing was
well it's not good

What is he doing here
Go to model four, and it makes more sense
Oh
is now paying closer attention, standing over their shoulder
What is this
This is basically everything that we have on our books at any given time
But what Eric was trying to do here is work it for levels of volatility that fall outside the limits of our standard  model
What are those levels
Well it's a fairly complicated
Simplify
The volatility boundaries are basically set using historic patterns then stretching them out another 10-15%
roughly
So what's happening
We are starting to test those historic patterns

What, we got them on our way to meet you at the office
we didn't know what the fuck you wanted to talk about

guess that's true

Look at these people

We are in here stressing our fucking heads off that the world as we know it is ending, and they've got no idea what's coming

pushing some numbers around on a computer screen, so a bunch of glorified crack addicts could take that information and pretend to understand it, and then make a bet against some other jock half way around the world who if he wasn't doing this would probably be in some  somewhere putting it all on number seven
And at the end of the day one guy loses and the other guy wins
continues to look out the window in silence for a long beat
Then with a little sly humor and a smile to : You do know it's a little more complicated than that
' phone starts playing a ring tone
He looks down at the text
It's Will
He wants to know if we've found him
What do  tell him
Tell him that we haven't found him

They wait for who goes first
So
Eric Dale
Oh Jesus
Before he was escorted out of the building by security
had nothing to do with that
know
'm sorry, go on
So as he was leaving the building he hands a disk to Peter Sullivan
Who's Peter Sullivan again
One of Eric's guys
Right
and tells him that he was almost on to something but hasn't been able to figure it out
So he gives him the disk and says give it a try
but the last thing he says as the doors to the elevator close is `be careful'
Be careful

Yes
Why
Well
take a look
Speak, you know  can't read those fucking things they put together
Basically the kid dives right into the thing after your little pep talk, nice job by the way, and he seems to have nailed it
Nailed it
The kid figured out what Eric was missing
And
And
gives him a long pause
it isn't good
' look gets  up and he comes over to stand behind at his desk and look at the computer
(cont'd) As far as  can tell these here are the historical volatility index limits
which  guess our whole fucking trading model relies on pretty heavily
and we are so fucking levered up that if this thing starts getting outside those limits it gets ugly in a hurry
How ugly

24   : (3)                                                24 Real ugly
And how close to those limits have we gotten
Oh we're beyond close
We broke through five or six days over the last two weeks, but we've managed to stay on the upside of it
for now
For now
Well look what happens here when we get on the wrong side of it
What am  looking at
takes his finger and points at a red number with a whole lot of zeroes after it
' look says it all
And that wouldn't even be that bad a day for us
historically speaking
Is this right
don't know
Where is Eric
We shut his phone off
Of course we did
And he hasn't come home yet,  spoke to his wife
He's probably crying in a fucking beer somewhere
() 26
24   : (4)                                              24 Or worse
Where's the kid who did this
Out looking for Eric
Do we think he knows what he's doing
don't know
What do  know
Well get him back here
-  25 25 and  are sitting at the bar each with a drink facing camera
There are women dancing in the background and one dancing in front of them,  and  look up occasionally
What now
We should probably tell Will he's not here
Yeah
They both just continue to look forward and sip their drinks
What do you think this girl makes in a night
Seth
1500
keeps looking forward
(cont'd) 2000
Fuck
That's
All things considered, that's not bad
Eventually ' phone starts to ring
He picks it up
() 27
25   :                                                       25 (cont'd) Will
No, no, we asked and no one's seen him
They exchange a look and slam their drinks
: 26                                                                     26 This time they are really stuck in traffic, the car is not moving at all
27                                                                     27 Eventually the car starts moving, and ' phone starts buzzing with a text again
He's freaking out
We need to get down there
They look out into the city
Finally  reaches into his bag and takes out the forty in the paper bag and starts drinking the beer again
He takes a big sip
(cont'd) What'a you think Rogers makes in a year
Long pause
have no idea
Come on, play along
don't know what year
Last year
Three quarters of a million bucks
Come on
What

27   :                                                     27 Not even close
More
Yes
million
Will Emerson made two and half million bucks last year
Fuck you
looks at him showing he is serious
(cont'd) Fuck you
He did
How do you know that
He told me
He just told you that
Well  asked him
Do you think that's true
Probably
That's fucked up
Why
Does that seem right to you
() 29
27   : (2)                                              27 Right
Jesus
So what do you think that means Rogers puts away
have no idea
They both just look straight forward,  takes a big gulp of the beer
(cont'd) This fucking traffic
We should have taken a the subway
- 28                                                                  28 The doors of the elevator open and  and  look up as and   are standing in front of them about to get onto the elevator
and  are now dressed with fresh shirts, ties, and suits and look as if they are ready to start a new day even though it is almost one in the morning
is still holding the forty in the paper bag
Will looks at it
They share a glancing smile
and step into the elevator keeping the guys in it
Gentlemen
You're coming with us
Will
Mr
Rogers
Sam this is Seth Bregman and this is Peter Sullivan
Sir

Yes
Where are we going
Going to get a second opinion on your work Peter
and  look at each other, growing more concerned
The doors open and they exit
'   - 30                                                                   30 looks for somewhere to throw out his beer but can't find a trash can
They follow  and  down a long hallway that is crowded with assistant cubicles
Eventually they turn into a small conference room that has no windows
It is claustrophobic
'   - 31                                                                   31 There are four people sitting at the table
They stand
Everyone says their somber hellos and shakes hands
Slight hellos, etc
They all sit down and at each place setting there is a pad of paper, a pencil, and an empty binder
Sitting at the head of the table is
He is a blond boyish looking 43 year old, although carries himself with intense confidence
He is the head of all fixed income securities, and oversees roughly 25,000 employees
Next to him is his chief risk management officer,  , the same woman from outside the building earlier who had the run in with
Next to her is her right hand man  , a sixty year old number cruncher and next to him is a firm lawyer
They are all dressed sharply for a new day
Long silence
look down at him
So Sam, what do you have for us
() 31
31   :                                                       31 Well
it should be here in a minute
Finding someone in the copy room at this hour was a little bit of a challenge
Well why don't we start by introducing everyone then
This is Sarah Robertson who you know, our chief risk management officer, Ramesh Shah from upstairs, and David Horn one of the firm's in house counsel
Nice to meet you all
This is Will Emerson my head of trading, and this is
Peter Sullivan, and Seth Bregman
They work in our risk department
Where is Eric Dale
He was let go today
looks at   as it would have been her call to let  go, she nods yes
So who's left in your risk department
As of today that would be Peter and our junior analyst Seth
Everyone looks down the table at  and
Their inexperience glares back
Really
looks back at , then the room goes silent again
Finally a    knocks on the door
Will Emerson
() 32
31   : (2)                                                 31 Here
Please just give one to everyone, thanks
The    hands out the packets to everyone in the room
So apparently Eric had been working on this for some time but was unable to finish it, as he was leaving the building today he gave the program to Peter here, and told him to see what he thought
Peter figured a few things out that Eric seemed to be missing and this is what came out
Where is Eric Dale now
He's been unreachable since he left the office
and the others open up the printout in front of them and start reviewing
, , , and  just sit in awkward silence staring at the other side of the table as they all read
This goes on for a full very long minute
Finally: Peter this is your work
Mainly Mr
Dale's
But this draft is yours
Yes
Again, derived from Mr
Dale's original model
But yes
And what is your background
Background
Your

31   : (3)                                                31 have been with the firm for two years working with Eric that whole time
But hold a doctorate in engineering, specialist in propulsion, from , with a Bachelors from Penn
What's a specialty in propulsion
Well
in laymen terms my thesis was a study in the way that friction ratios effect steering outcomes in aeronautical use under reduced gravity loads
Long silence
So you are a rocket scientist
The whole table looks over at Peter with some awe
Um
was
yes
How did you end up here
Well it's all just numbers really, you're just changing what you're adding up
and if  may speak freely the money is considerably more attractive here
looks down again at the numbers in front of him and his tone suddenly switches to serious, testy even
What time is it
It's 2:15
and  just look at each other in silence for a bit
What do you have in exposure right now, tonight
don't know
between 900 and 1

roughly

31   : (4)                                                31 If Mr
Sullivan's numbers are correct
looks down at the sheet in front of him to go through the numbers and takes a beat too long
1
215 Trillion
checks his number
Yes
Fuck me
fuck me
And 'm guessing by the fact that you two haven't said anything that the math checks out
looks over at  and
then looks to She looks back
Look    we'd need a little more time to go over    this, but Mr
Sullivan here seems to know    what he's doing
And  don't have to tell    you that this is a problem
Thank you for that
What time is it
2:16
Fuck me
Jared stands up and walks around the small room
The rest of the room goes silent
Finally: (cont'd) Sam how long under normal operations would it take your people to clear that from our books
What
The 1
2 trillion
All of it

31   : (5)                                                  31 Yes
don't know, a couple weeks
Weeks
Yes
But as you certainly know our business is selling  buying
It doesn't work for very long without both components
If we suddenly stop buying for a day or two that just doesn't hide under the rug, it gets out and this whole this thing comes to a end
and right quick
understand
Do you
How many traders do we have left between your floor and Petersen's
don't know, sixty
has been looking down at the numbers while this conversation has been taking place
Jared 've just been looking here a little closer, and it's these  numbers that are really setting this thing off
holds up a hand to interrupt Ramesh
Jared nods his head, his eyes are perfectly still but his brain is racing
Excuse me,  need to make a quick call
calmly stands up   and steps out of the   room for a long moment
The room stays   completely quiet the   whole time he is gone
We hear nothing
It is awkward to say   the least
He comes back in and sits   down without missing   a beat
(cont'd) Please
() 36
31   : (6)                                                31 was just saying, and just speaking completely off the record here, it won't be long before someone else starts putting these in and sees the exact same thing we are looking at here
If they haven't already
Pause
Understood
And Sarah, what value would you allow to be placed on those assets that might be left on the books, if they had to be
Why would they still be on the books
Because suddenly no one wants to buy them
Oh fuck you Sam
give me a fucking break, all at once
Without an active market, it could take weeks, months for me to value them correctly
You'd have to go block by block
It's a very simple business Jared
You and  talked about this last year
turns around suddenly and cuts him off
Sam
Will, Peter, and
Seth
Seth, Could you please excuse us for a few minutes
They stand up and start to exit the room
(cont'd) Oh and Peter
Who else has seen this
() 37
31   : (7)                                                31 thinks that through
No one
besides us here
And Mr
Dale
Yes
And can it really be that we don't know where Eric Dale is
'm afraid so
His wife tells us he hasn't come home yet
and the firm shut off his phone today
Perfect
Well,  need to know where he is
, , and  leave the room and close the door behind them
'   - 32                                                                  32 They cross the hallway and sit on a bench staring out the window
They talk very quietly
Jesus fucking Christ
Who is that guy
He's Sam's boss
He looks like he's fifteen years old
How old is he
He's like forty
How does that happen
Oh it happens all the time
Except to me
Kid's a fucking killer
What are they talking about
() 38
32   :                                                       32 It ain't pretty
What ain't pretty
If people suddenly stop buying the shit we're selling
They all look out the window
Long pause
(cont'd) You guys smoke
Well, you should
' 33                                                                     33 Jared you can't do what you are thinking about doing
What if we don't have a choice
What does that mean
Fuck you
you don't have a choice
Fuck me
Have you looked at these numbers Sam
Yes, but what the hell do  know
comes back over to the table and picks up the packet
Well, Mr
Shah tell me if 'm wrong but to me these numbers don't add up
If  may 'd like to take some time before we
Jared we can't answer that yet
Are you fucking kidding me
this is exactly what we've
now cuts him off abruptly

closes the issue off with another look to
We meet in 45 minutes
Sam, do you have this file
Yes, here it is
slides him the hard drive across the table, they all take a second to follow it
And Sam we need Eric Dale, it's making me very uneasy knowing he is out there right now wanting to put a knife in our backs while he's not even aware he's holding the knife in his hand
and  leave the room as  is left alone with What are you going to do
Not sure
Are you going to call him
They both look at each other for a long beat
Finally
already did
puts his hand on ' shoulder briefly
They part

It is a very clear night
Jesus

36   :                                                     36 Wow
Yeah
Shit, that's a long way down
Yeah, it is
They sit down on a girder, then light up
' look and tone becomes a little darker as they all stare out into the night
Long Pause
' 37                                                                  37 and  wait for the elevator alone in silence
The doors finally open and they get in
- 38                                                                  38 Still not a word
Finally
Is this really where you want to be taking this at this point
'm sorry
We don't even know if he's right
How long should this take you to confirm
Not long
Silence except for the ding as it comes to the floor and the doors open
They part

Finally  stands up and goes over to the edge and looks over
He jumps up and sits on the edge
() 41
39   :                                                      39 Careful
Jesus man
Did you know the fear most people feel when they stand on the edge like this is not actually a fear that they will fall but instead it's the subconscious fearing that they might jump
It's a fear of losing faith
Well that's a little deep and depressing, thank you
Yeah well,  can get a little dark sometimes
Will, come on
Get down
jumps down and comes back over to sit down
They stare out again
Not today
(beat) So it looks like they are gonna have us dump this shit
What
Yeah, you watch
How
trillion bucks
'm just saying
How would they even do that
() 42
39   : (2)                                                39 You can't
it's impossible
But they'll figure out a way
've been at this place for ten years and 've seen some things that you wouldn't believe
and when all is said and done
they don't lose money
They don't care if everyone else does, but they won't
Long silence
Will
Yeah
Did you really make two and half million bucks last year
Yeah
did
What do you do with all that money
don't know really
It goes pretty quick
You learn to spend what's in your pocket
Two and a half million goes quickly
Well the tax man takes half of it up front
So now you got what
million and a quarter
Mortgage grabs another 300K, gave 150 to my parents to live off, so now you got what
Eight hundred
bought a car last year for 150
Probably another 100 eating
25 on clothes, put 400 away for a rainy day

125 left
takes a long drag off his cigarette
spent 76,520 dollars on booze, dancers, and whores
76,520
Yeah, kinda shocked me, although  was able to write most of it off, as entertainment
With that he flicks his cigarette over the edge of the building just as a massive   comes sweeping up from behind the building and comes right over their heads
are now  above the rotor noise
Whoa
Whoa

3:30
Oh, here they go
They are bringing in the cavalry
We better get down there

The office is very large and has a full sitting area with two couches

stops reading with a deeply aware look and just stares out the window as well
This is a very
very bad dream
looks over at him directly
don't know, seems like we actually may have just finally woken up
comes to the door
sits up
Hello
Come in
How do we look
Her look says it all
(cont'd) should go
No, you should stay
So
(dead calm delivery) It's all legit
the kid killed it
The formula is worthless
They all look at each other as if they have seen a ghost
What do you mean
It's broken
There are eight trillion dollars of paper around the world relying on that equation

Don't even start
This was discussed
'm heading to the conference room
No
'd like you to hear this
No
don't want to hear this
stares at them both
(cont'd) How do you think 've stuck around this place so long
He walks out of the room
and  look each other over
've called Tuld
Is there a contingency plan here
contingency plan
Yes
We went all in on this one
So we've got ourselves quite exposed here
haven't we
To Tuld or the market

Jared's phone buzzes
He takes it out and his face says it all
(cont'd) He's here
His face says yes
Sarah walks out
Jared stands up and straightens his tie in the reflection of the window
He exits

-                       42 They cut through a short cut near the freight elevator
, , and  are coming down the stairway from the roof
We were just grabbing a cigarette on the roof and a very spiffy looking helicopter dive-bombed us and then landed
know
Come with us
Where's Sam
don't know
Do you want all of us> Yes
ushers the whole group towards the conference room

Finally, Just one piece of advice to everyone here before we go in there
this could get a bit ugly but whatever you do
just
tell the truth
don't try to change a word of it, no sugar coating
no one here is smart enough
including the rocket scientist
He continues on

'   - 44                                                                   44 The guys are taken aback because standing right outside the opening elevator door is a very well dressed page and a female executive assistant who is also dressed perfectly for the day ahead
Mr
Cohen
Yes
This way
They are already in there waiting for you
'   - 45                                                                   45 They come through glass doors and enter a massive conference room with a commanding view of the city
It is filled with people along one side of the table
There are a team of five lawyers, three compliance officers, a couple of key board members, twelve in all
On the near side of the table sits surrounded by empty chairs all alone
The head of the table is empty
They all file in and sit down
They all sit in silence
waiting
Finally from a side door   comes walking into the room
He is dressed in a average suit and tie, is not tall, late fifties and doesn't have a hair on his head
He carries himself without much exception
His eyes however tell a far different tale
Intense even at rest
He walks the length of the room, everyone half stands up
Please sit down
He then seats himself at the head of the table
Everyone in the room has the printout in front of them
is seated immediately to his left, then , then , , , , and finally
(cont'd) Welcome everyone
must apologize for dragging you all here at such an uncommon hour but from what 've been told this matter needs to be handled urgently, so urgently in fact that it probably should have been addressed weeks ago

So why doesn't someone please try to explain to me what's the problem here
Everyone looks around the room a bit and finally  speaks up
Well, Mr
Tuld as  mentioned earlier if you look here at the top page of this printout
He cuts him off
Jared, it's a little early for all that, how bout in English
Actually 'd like to hear from the guy who put this thing together
Mr
Sullivan is it
Does he speak English
Sir
'd like to speak to the analyst who seems to have stumbled across this mess
Well, that's Peter Sullivan here
looks down the table to , as does everyone else in the room
gives him a go ahead look
Sir
Ah, there he is
Yes sir
How old are you Mr
Sullivan
'm twenty-seven sir
Please call me John
Yes sir
() 49
45   : (2)                                                45 So Mr
Sullivan why don't you tell me what you think is going on here, and please speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever,  didn't get here on my brains  can assure you of that
is very nervous
Well, sir
As  guess you may or may not know  work for Mr
Rogers here as an associate in the risk assessment and management office at Now you lost me at
Sorry
was joking Mr
Sullivan
Yes
Well as you probably know over the last 36-40 months the firm has begun packaging new  products that combine several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security
This has been very profitable as imagine you noticed
have
Well the firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day
The problem, which is  guess why we are here tonight, is that it takes us
the firm
almost a month to layer these products correctly thereby posing a challenge from a risk management standpoint
And Mr
Sullivan that challenge is
We have to hold these assets on our books longer than we might ideally like to
() 50
45   : (3)                                                45 Yes
But the key factor is these are essentially just mortgages, so that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably beyond what you might be willing, or allowed to do in any other circumstance, thereby pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags
And how far have we pushed that profile tonight Mr
Sullivan
We have pushed it to 1
215 Trillion dollars
at  alone
Give or take
Give or take
Now Mr
Sullivan what  am guessing, and give me a little rope here, what  am guessing that your report here says is that considering the, shall we say bumpy road, we've been on the last week or so that the numbers that your brilliant co- workers up the line ahead of you had come up with in the past don't seem to make much sense anymore considering what's taking place today
Actually not taking place today but what's already taken place over the last two weeks
So what you're saying is it's already happened
Sort of
And Mr
Sullivan what does your model say that means for us here
() 51
45   : (4)                                                45 Well, that's where it becomes a projection
But
looks down at  for approval to go forward
You're speaking with me Mr
Sullivan
Well
sir
if those assets were to decrease by just 25 percent, and remain on our books
well
that loss would be greater than the current market capitalization of this company
The room goes silent
looks at  long and hard
He then stands up and goes over to the window and looks into the city
So what you're telling me Mr
Sullivan is that the music appears to be about to stop and we are going to be holding the biggest bag of stinking shit ever assembled in the history of capitalism
Everyone looks back at
(cont'd) Mr
Sullivan
Well sir, 'm not sure 'd put it that way but let me clarify using your analogy, what this model shows is the music, so to speak, just slowing, if the music were to stop, as you put it, then this model would not be even close to that scenario
It would be considerably worse
Well let me tell you something Mr
Sullivan
Do you want to know why 'm sitting here in this chair with you all, why  get the big bucks, so to speak
Yes
'm here for one reason and one reason only
() 52
45   : (5)                                                 45 continues to look out over the city for a long beat
(cont'd) 'm here to guess what the music is gonna do a week, month, a year from now
That's it, nothing more
and 'm afraid
standing here tonight
that  don't hear
a
thing
just silence
The room falls completely still for at least half a minute
Then   spins around quickly with a considerably more upbeat tone and looks up and down the table
(cont'd) So, now that we know that the music has stopped, what can we do about it
Long Silence
(cont'd) Mr
Cohen, Ms
Robertson, 'm afraid this is where you are supposed to step back in
Lord knows we relied enough on Mr
Sullivan today
and  come to attention and gather their thoughts
(cont'd) What have you got for us
Long pause
(cont'd) What have  told you since the first day you walked into my office
(pause) That there are three ways to make a living in this business
Be first, be smarter, or cheat
Well  don't cheat, and even though  like to think we have got some pretty smart people in this building of the two remaining options, it sure is a hell of alot easier to just be first
The room goes silent again as Mr
Tuld stares back out the window
Sell it all today
smiles just a bit
Then turns
Is that even possible Sam

45   : (6)                                                 45 looks across the room at  , they have known each other for 35 years
It is, but at what cost
'll pay
Really
and  look and read each other
think so
Almost a trillion bucks of paper
Where does it come back to us
Everywhere
Sam,  don't think you seem to understand what your boy down here just said
if made you
how would you do it
looks down at the table for a long, long, beat
You bring the traders in for their normal 6:30 meeting and you be honest with them, they're gonna know it's the end either way, so you'd have to throw them a bone, and a pretty big one
You'd have to come out of the gate storming
40 percent done by 10:15 and 70 percent of your positions need to be gone by eleven, cause by lunch the word will be out
No swaps, no nothing, and by two o'clock you'll be getting 65 cents on the dollar, if you're lucky, and the feds will be in here looking up your ass and trying to slow us down
Ramesh
He looks to   down the table

45   : (7)                                                45 They'll slow you down but it's yours to sell
They can't stop you
John
let's just say we pull that off, which is saying something
the real question is
who are we selling this to
The same people you've been selling this to for the last two years
and whoever else will buy it
They look at each other to see if they understand each other
If you do this you've killed that market for years
It's over
(Nods
) And you are selling something you know has no value
(cuts him off cold) We are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price, so that  may survive, Sam
You'll never sell a thing to any one of them again
understand
Do you
Do you
This is it, Sam, this is it
The rest of the table is taken aback and just watching them go at it
Silence
(cont'd) It's 4:00
Jared you've got till 5:00 to break this down and draw me up a plan

45    : (8)                                                45 (cont'd) Is there anyone else who actually knows what's in there right now, block by block
Eric Dale
Where is Eric Dale
As of today he is no longer with the firm
We have been trying to locate him
So he is just out there with this information
(Nods yes
) looks down the lawyer side of the table to a secret service looking guy
Carmelo
Yes
Get me Eric Dale here by 6:30
Done
, meet back here in an hour
Everyone stands up and begins to scatter
(cont'd) Sam
let's talk

Long silence

A45   :                                                      A45 Hell of a town isn't it
Never really did it for me actually
Really
Always been kinda a grass and tree guy
've always loved this place
Ever since arrived
Everything about it
can't say  feel that about anyplace actually
Are you going to be able to come on board here Sam
They look at each other
'm not sure John
This is really ugly
You and  are salesmen Sam, we sell
That's what we do
It's not complicated
Exactly
And you damn well know that you don't make a sale unless you think the guy is gonna come back for more, and tomorrow we are done
looks out and then over at  and decides whether or not to proceed
This is it Sam
You keep saying that, what is that supposed to mean
It's the big one
Most of us aren't gonna make it out of this one
() 57
A45   : (2)                                                A45 Us
The street
What are you talking about
This won't be the last `situation'  will be having this week
It's just the start
It's only the start because we are starting it
Maybe
But  don't think that's true, not this time
The numbers just don't add up anymore
Well  agree with you there, 've been saying that for years
mean if this kid can come up with this
don't think  can go in knowing what know and put the hammer down on these guys like this
Oh please, when did you become so soft
Fuck you soft, you're panicking
The word panic slaps   in the face
He then calms
If you're the first one out the door Sam, it's not called panicking stares aggressively at
Look,  obviously don't have all the information that you do
But  think this could destroy this firm

You are knowingly putting people out of business
Full stop

You let me take care of that

He walks over to , , and
How'd that go
This is a fucking shit show
They are going to do it
Probably
Jesus
Remember this day boys, remember this day
walks out of the room
An assistant comes into the room
Gentlemen, there is some breakfast down the hall if you guys are hungry
looks at the guys
Seth, someone is going to have to get breakfast
And let's face it, it's you

There is a housekeeping person standing next to them as well
The doors open, and all three get in

That's where 'm headed right now, downstairs to work on it with my guys
No, you and
with Tuld
'm not sure we need one, Sarah
That's not the way 've ever done this
(with distinct sarcasm) Please
He knows where we both have stood on this all along
There's nothing more to do
This pushes a button with her
That's exactly my point, and knowing what was discussed by both you and  with him, don't see how that can possibly you with anything but a false sense of comfort
'm not looking for a sense of comfort here, Sarah
don't think there is one to be found
The elevator door opens and the housekeeper gets off
Sarah walks after her, but turns to Tuld first
So again, what's the strategy here
On this particular front, 'm just not sure there's much left to do
looks at him trying to judge the situation
'    - 49                                                                 49 holds the door open

Don't even think of fucking me on this one, because if we are going down
you damn well know its going to be together
Jared looks at her for a long beat
No, 'm not sure  do know that
The doors close

and  are sitting on the couch
is stuffing food in his mouth while  eats nothing
What do you think Tuld made last year
Would you shut the fuck up
speaks with food in his mouth
86 mil
in salary and bonus
Really
Yeah, it's public record
That's a lot of fucking money
He was worth a billion
Was

You'll see

(Slight head shake no
) need a little real air
Probably a good idea
Will, is that alright
Alright
If  get out of here for a minute
Yeah
Are you kidding
It's not a prison
Do you want me to hold your hand
Peter exits
Will's phone rings
Will stares at it and finally picks it up
We only hear his part of the conversation
(cont'd) Will Emerson
Yes
Oh thank you understand
comes to the door of ' office
He looks at everyone's faces
What
That was Eric's wife
He's alive, he's home
He doesn't want to talk to us
And he doesn't know she called me
They all look to  to see what to do
Where's he live
The heights

No
it's Eric

comes to the door and knocks lightly
She looks up surprised to see him
May  come in
Please, sit
closes the door and sits in front of her desk
Looks around, then looks right at her
So
we are going to do this thing
It's going to be tight
Is Sam on board
Not yet

(cont'd) Sarah,  need a head to feed to these traders
and the board
this morning

It's you
They stare at each other, she does not flinch
Of course you are well aware  filtered several warnings for you and Cohen over a year ago on this
'm not sure that's the best path for you to be taking at this point
you're going to be taken care of here
(Nods) Obviously it's quite complicated
John  was told that in no uncertain terms
It was all a very grey area
It was actually made very clear at the time, by you and  and Cohen
'd really prefer that you didn't fight me on this
pauses, they look at each other
(cont'd) We all fucked this one up pretty good
Yes
We need you to stay here till this is all done and the markets close

Good luck

There is a security person standing at the door who is waiting for her as he gets up and walks out

As they wait they see   come out of the elevator and walk towards them
Ah fuck, it's Jared
He's coming this way
What does wonderboy want
stands up and walks over to
Do you have a minute
We're heading to get Eric Dale
know
just need a second
walk away from
What is it
Tuld and  have concerns that Sam may not be willing to step up and do the right thing here
looks around the garage, than back at
don't think that's ever been a problem
Of course it hasn't, but during acute situations, such as this, often what is right can take on multiple interpretations
() 65
52   :                                                       52 They look at each other for a long beat as  sizes up the question
In the background the squeals of tires on concrete are heard
Sam will step up
know he will
but if he doesn't
As the question stands unfinished Will's convertible flies into frame down a ramp and pulls up next to  and
The attendant gets out and before  has a chance hands the attendant a tip
then looks back at  who is waiting to get in the car
(') (cont'd) But if he doesn't, we need to know that you will
That  will what
Step up
climbs into the car and shuts the door
He looks at through the open window with  now sitting next to him within earshot
have no doubt Sam will make the right choice
And if it makes you feel any better he and  have always had the same interpretation of what's right
no matter how acute the situation
puts the car in drive and pulls out of the garage leaving  standing there

Slow guitar music playing
The camera glides along the empty floor scanning over the many different empty trading stations and the hundreds of computer screens
It turns the corner and then finally enters ' office

He looks in the mirror, and then decides to wash his face as well
He stares at himself in the mirror
The water drips off his face
He looks old
Just then the door opens and   walks into the room
He does not go to use any of the facilities
He stops and looks to talk to There he is
John
walks over and takes a towel to wipe off his hands and face
Finally he looks up
(cont'd) So what's it look like John
The line is delivered a bit too lightly for  ' liking
Cohen has done a nice job
It can work
What does that mean
It means, as you very well know, that you are a very important piece of this puzzle
They look directly at each other
(cont'd) Here
hands  a single piece of folded paper
opens it and looks at it
That's very generous

unless they believe in you completely

Well you can't have any reservations

Thank you
turns around and starts walking but as he looks up he see the figure of a woman coming towards him
It is immediately obvious that he knows her
He stops and she keeps slowly walking towards him
They stop in front of each other squarely
Hey
Hi
It's really good to see you
She has a very sweet face but looks tired
She appears to be a bartender or something, she is not dressed for banking
You too
You look tired

What are you doing here
never left work

How's your father
She is pleasantly surprised by this gesture
He's good
Thanks for asking
Be safe
He starts to leave
Hey
You got any inside tips for him
This stops  dead in his tracks
His world tightens yet clarifies
Finally
Sell
She looks at him with concern as he doesn't even hint at a smile as he says this
They then give a small kiss on the cheek, and part

She calmly gets up and walks over to the door and slowly closes it
Then she reaches out and twists the blinds on the glass wall separating her office from the floor giving herself total privacy
She walks over to her desk and sits down
She reaches over and grabs a box of tissues, methodically preparing to cry, almost like a surgeon preparing to work
She sits at her desk still seemingly calm and collected
Her face starts to tweak just a little, but it just will not give way
Again she tries
And again
She can not cry
She can't believe it
The deeply tragic look of total failure floods her eyes but still hardly a twitch on her face
Still no tears
Finally she makes a forced noise like a sob, but it isn't real and she knows it
Then she tries to laugh to herself, she tries again to laugh, but it too is not real
She does feel something, but she simply and very sadly can only openly express even to herself
nothing

But 'm pretty sure what it says
Do you think he's right
'm sure he's right
They both sit down on the stoop
Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting of the partners tonight
John Tuld has decided to liquidate our entire position
looks over at Will (cont'd) Today
' face doesn't show much emotion
But he is surprised and sincere
Well,  am very sorry to hear that
They want me to get you back there, they are worried about you being out here
(with pleasant disgust) Please
'm just saying
(cuts him off cold) Not a chance
lets it sit for a few beats
This is serious shit Eric

60   : (2)                                                60 You don't think  know that
've been warning that cunt Robertson about this shit since last March
Well
Fuck her
Fuck her
Look
signed my papers man, 'm out
They've got nothing on me anymore
They'll pay
looks over at
lets him know with a look that they mean real money
've already been paid enough by them
looks back out onto the empty street
(cont'd) Did you know  built a bridge once
'm sorry
bridge
No,  didn't
was an engineer by trade
Well
It goes from Dilles Bottom, Ohio to Moundsville West Virginia
It spans 912 feet over the Ohio river
Steel through arch design
12,100 people a day use the thing
() () 73
60   : (3)                                                60 (cont'd) It cut out 35 miles each way of extra driving to get from Wheeling to New Martinsville
That's a combined 847,000 miles of driving a day
and 25,410,000 miles a month and 304,920,000 miles a year saved
Now ' mind is racing and he is adding up numbers as he goes
(cont'd) completed that project in 1986
22 years ago
Over the life of that one bridge that's 6 billion
708 million
240 thousand miles that haven't had to be driven
At let's say
50 miles an hour that's 134,164,800 hours
or 559,020 days
so that one little bridge has saved the people of those two communities a combined 1531 years of their lives not wasted in the car
give or take
Jesus
One thousand, five hundred, thirty-one years
Fuck
They sit and let it sink in
That's what  did
(beat) Look
you better get back over there
Yeah
Crazy shit
True
Dumping the whole fucking motherload in one day
Fucked up
Well
alright
Thanks for stopping by
() 74
60   : (4)                                               60 No problem
looks out down the street as a black towncar comes pulling up to the house
Who the fuck is this
'd guess it's the firm's people
What
Tuld doesn't want any loose ends
They fired me Will
Fuck em
Fuck em
Just come back with them, take the bonus, and you're home tonight by five
Either that or they are going to fight you on everything, the package, the options
drops his head
walks down the stairs as the town car stops in front of Eric's house
The windows are tinted, but they know who it is
walks around to his car
(cont'd) You're a better man than
Well that's always been true
Yes it has
See ya
is about to climb in his car
The house looks great by the way
Thanks
() 75
60   : (5)                                                   60 And Eric
don't beat yourself up too bad over this shit
Yeah
Who the fuck knows
nods
(cont'd) Some people like driving the long way home
He gets in his car and drives away
'  - 61                                                                     61 and  are driving slowly towards downtown Manhattan which spans up and out in front of them through the windshield
There is a long silence, and finally
So, am  getting fired
don't know
Very long pause, then he looks over at  and decides whether to tell the truth
(cont'd) Probably
yes
almost definitely
Are you
No
This clearly hits  but he recovers quickly
Oh
It's not personal, you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time, the young guys are always the first to go
Nothing say is gonna make you feel any better
() 76
61   :                                                       61 get it
looks over at  and around at the interior of the luxury car and then back into the city
(') (cont'd) When did you know this is what you wanted to do
He thinks that through
The first time  made 36 million dollars for the firm in the last eleven minutes of the trading day
Fuck me
It was a perfect trade
saw it coming from three days away
took my time was in,  was out
Pish posh
And it was beautiful
How did you learn to do that
'm not sure, and whatever it is it could be gone tomorrow
looks out again at the city then to
(') (cont'd) Look man 'm sorry about this
Don't be, you're not doing it to me
know
but 'm still sorry
At least you'll have some decent cash to walk away with
Only if we can get this done, right
We'll get it done
How
() 77
61   : (2)                                                61 'm trying to figure that out right now
There aren't really enough willing buyers out there right now
'm trying to think of every last one of them  can and then 'll make them willing
This line sits there for a minute and  looks out onto the city
Are you ok with that
'm about to completely fuck guys 've been doing business with for fifteen years so no 'm not exactly ok with it
But look, every last one of them would do the same thing to me in a second
so it is what it is
guess
And what about everyone else
Everyone else
Normal people
What are you a socialist
Fuck me Seth
looks over at , sizing him up, looking to see if he has what it takes
(cont'd) Look, If you want to do this with your life, and do it well, you need to believe that you are necessary
And you are
If people want to live like this
with their big cars and these houses that they haven't even paid for
Then you are necessary
The only reason they can continue to live like kings is because we've got our fingers on the scale in favor
And if  were to take my finger off
() () 78
61   : (3)                                                61 (cont'd) Then the whole world gets really fucking fair, really fucking quickly
And no one wants that, they say they do
but they don't
They want what we're giving them, but they also want to play innocent and pretend they have no idea how we get it
And that's more hypocrisy than  can swallow
So fuck em
Long look out at the city ahead
(cont'd) And tomorrow if this all goes south they'll crucify us for being reckless, but if we are wrong and everything get's back on track
They'll be laughing their arses off at us for being the biggest bunch of pussies that God ever let through the door
He is trying to convince himself as much as
They both look out the windows
Are we gonna be wrong on this one
looks into the sea of skyscrapers that now tower above them
No
they're all gonna get fucked

He crosses a large open windswept corporate plaza
As he approaches the building he sees   standing in front having a cigarette
He walks towards him and then finally decides to take off the headphones
The music stops and the wind kicks in
Hello
Peter
(silence) You want one
() 79
62   :                                                       62 don't smoke
But  holds his place comfortably
That's good
don't much either
It's kinda beautiful out right now
They both look out
Slow pacing
Yeah,  guess it is
(almost surprised) 've never really liked this town much
How long have you been here
Forty years
think it's beautiful
The whole place
Forty years, that's something
Are you tired
Of What
Remember  don't work as hard as you do
That's not true
No it is, actually
Long silence
Are we all getting fired after today
looks out and thinks about it for a while
Probably
They're going to fire you
() 80
62   : (2)                                                   62 That's not what they'll call it,
it'll be a mercy killing really
looks at
(cont'd) You don't have to stand out here for me
don't really want to go back in there just yet
understand that
Long beat
think  know your son
Really
Yeah
Not well
but, he always seemed like a nice person
He is a nice person
taxi honks and flies by
(cont'd) guess you could say alot worse about a guy
Have you told him what's about to happen
They look at each other to check the nature of the question
What do you mean
This whole thing
No
hadn't even thought of it
guess it's illegal anyway
() 81
62   : (3)                                              62 Yeah
who the fuck knows anymore
and even if it was you'd sure as hell never get caught
He's already pretty rich anyway though right
He doesn't need the help
laughs quietly
That's very true
He works with a friend of mine
He's a hell of alot richer than me, know that much
But you are taller
Laughs again
That's true
It's not much
but it's something
What did your father do
He's a doctor
Really
Eyes
Now that's something
Yeah
it is
Did he want you to do that
No, never
Oh
() 82
62   : (4)                                               62 He was always a pretty miserable guy actually
Another helicopter is heard overhead landing on the building
Peter looks up
(cont'd) They're all coming in now
Yes they are
Have you ever done anything like this before
No
never
not even close
takes a deep drag off his cigarette
Oh
Yeah
looks down at his watch, then thinks about what to say next
Do you really think this is the only
or the
right thing to do
For who
'm not sure
Now  looks around and thinks
'm not either
So this is gonna make a pretty big mess of it, then
don't even want to think about it
() 83
62   : (5)                                                 62 Yeah
Just doesn't quite seem
Takes another long drag
know
(Very slightly shakes his head
) Well
guess we should get back
Yeah
They both stand in place for a long beat then finally turn and head into the building
- 63                                                                   63 The camera follows them through the long marble lobby
Through security
They comfortably don't talk to each other the entire time till they get into the elevator
- 64                                                                   64 Staring ahead in silence
Well good luck, you know, in the future
Seems like you'll probably be just fine
Thank you
The doors open
: 65                                                                   65 very tight shot of  sitting fully clothed on the toilet with the lid on
He is crying very, very intensely but almost silently
He puts his head in his hands and just once or twice lets out a loud noise
() 84
65   :                                                     65 Eventually someone comes into the room and he hears the person go over to the sink and start running water tries to stop himself from crying
Eventually he accepts that the guy is not leaving and he comes out of the stall and walks over to the sinks
is standing in front of the mirror with his shirt off shaving
His new shirt and tie are on a hanger next to him
walks up to a sink next to him and it is very obvious that he has been crying
He undoes his collar and starts to wash his face
Finally  speaks
You alright
sends him a dagger of a look through the reflection in the mirror
You just fired me
'm sorry
This is all 've ever wanted to do
Really
Yes
This hits  just a touch
am sorry
does up his tie perfectly looks at  again in the eye
Then walks out
- 66                                                                   66 is sitting in a club chair staring out the window
The coffee table in front of her has a huge spread of fruit and cheese and pastries
She is not eating
She sits and stares
Eventually the door behind her opens, and a walks in with
They are almost ready for you Ms
Robertson
Couple of minutes
leaves the room
looks over at  then sits in the chair near her
Silence
() 85
66   :                                                    66 You as well
Yes
Jesus
Yeah
'm sorry
Thank you
Sam and the rest of your floor are gone after today as well
Really
and Cohen
No
still here
Of course
Long awkward pause
Eric looks around for something, anything to talk about
(cont'd) Are you still dating that tall guy
from the Christmas thing
She looks over at him with a slight smile, giving him credit for trying to break the ice
No
He was very tall
6'7''
(quietly) Wow
Silence
() 86
66   : (2)                                                66 did pass on your concerns last year
just so you know
It doesn't matter
It does
The door swings open and a catering person comes in rolling a cart with another large tray with more food on it
She places it on the table next to the other food
The abundance is overwhelming
(cont'd) Thank you
The caterer leaves
looks around
Have they taken all the phones out of this room
nods yes
(cont'd) Jesus
Paranoid fucks
Yeah
didn't think they were going to be able to get you back here
stands up and goes over to the window
They told me they were going to drag me through hell on everything from my options to healthcare over the next two years or  come back and make
(he looks up and does a little math in his head) $176,471
00 an hour to sit in this room quietly
it wasn't much of choice
It never is
goes back and sits in the chair
(cont'd) Obviously looking back, the point was expressed with insufficient urgency
() () 87
66   : (3)                                                66 (cont'd) but your point was passed on
need you to know that
Eric
understand, there was nothing you could do
Now  questions herself
guess
at the time
it didn't seem like there was much of a choice
It never does
They both look at each other with miniscule smiles, then out the windows onto the city, defeated
Long silence
You have kids, yeah
Long pause as he lets her alone
What is your package going to look like
don't know, that's what 'm waiting for now
Should be pretty good, no
It better be
: - 6:30 67                                                                   67 There are 40 young, 90% male, traders jammed into the conference room next to the trading floor talking very loudly with one another
They are oblivious to what is about to happen
Eventually, , , , and a firm lawyer, come into the room
Everyone quiets down a bit
() 88
67   :                                                    67 Alright, hey
(whistles)
They go silent as they notice  standing at the head of the table
and the lawyer are standing off in the corner just to observe
looks somber
Thank you all for coming in a little early this morning,  know yesterday was pretty bad,  wish  could say that today is going to be less so but that isn't going to be the case
Now  am supposed to read this statement here to you all but how bout you read it on your own time and 'll just tell you what the fuck's going on here
looks at  then they look at , he continues
(cont'd) have spent the night here meeting with the executive committee and the decision has been made to begin to unwind a considerable portion of the firm's holdings in several key asset classes
The crux of it is
in the firm's thinking the party is over as of this morning
There is going to be considerable turmoil in the markets for the foreseeable future
They believe that it is better to have this turmoil begin with us
as a result the firm has decided to liquidate the majority of its position of fixed income  today
An assistant starts handing out info packets to each of the traders in the room
(cont'd) You should be getting a breakdown right now, you will see the accounts you are responsible for today
'm sure it hasn't taken you long to understand the implications of this sale on your relationships with your counterparties and as a result on your careers
have expressed this reality to the executive committee and they understand
As a result, if you are able to complete a 93% sale of your assets you will receive a 1
4 million dollar one off bonus
() () 89
67   : (2)                                                 67 (cont'd) If the floor as a whole is able to achieve a 93% sale we all get an additional 1
3 million a piece
Because of this, if you burn through your allotment by noon, get moving around the floor and start picking up other guys leftovers
stops for a second and looks around the room
(cont'd) For those of you who have never been through this before, this is what the beginning of a fire sale looks like don't have to tell any of you that the first hour and a half is going to be very important
want you to hit every bite you can find
Dealers, clients, brokers, and your mother if she's buying
and obviously no swaps, its outgoing only today
This is obviously not the way any of us would like for this to be going down, but the ground is shifting below our feet, and there appears to be no other way out
looks around the room again, person by person and sees that they indeed know what needs to be done
(cont'd) Obviously
this is a very unique situation
if we are successful today we will have been successful in destroying our own jobs
can not promise that each of you will be repositioned within the firm, but  can tell you that  am very proud of the work we have done together here,  have been at this here for 34 years, and  know
from experience people are going to say some nasty stuff about what we have done here, and what you have devoted a portion of your life to
But have faith that in the greater picture our skills have not been wasted, we have accomplished much, and our talents have served some greater good
He looks down at the ground, then back up around the room
Then he walks out

- 8:20 68                                                                   68 There is a very quiet energy on the floor
low murmur
Then a hush falls over the floor as people pass on the info that the ,   is about to come onto the floor
He appears at one end of the floor and it falls silent walks dramatically into the middle of the floor and then into the middle of the row in the dead middle of the floor
He looks around and stands in letting the drama build
Then he climbs up onto the desk and looks out onto the floor like a general
By the end of today almost everyone else in the world, including me, will have considerably less money than they began the day with
You, in this room, are the exception
You will leave here today richer
You will fire the first shot, wish it didn't have to be, but at times the market must eat its weak, and you all
are not the weak
We must strike quick, with no doubt, if you hear pause on the line, attack
By noon the  is going to be in here getting in your faces, sniffing around, you let us take care of them and you just keep going
We own what we are choosing to sell today and there is nothing they can do about it
107 years ago this firm was founded, today we secure our place for next 107
You've got two minutes before we get started
Let's finish this, so we can get on to the next one
climbs down from the table
, who is standing off to the side, walks along the entire floor slowly and then heads into his office
'  - 69                                                                   69 He shuts his door as the bell rings and his office goes almost silent
Through the glass you see the trading floor go wild, then he walks over to his desk, turns around and stares into the four large computer screens as the charts and graphs begin to move
We just see the back of his head
- 70                                                                   70 Several actual individual trading sequences throughout the day

'  - 4:02 71                                                                    71 The market has closed
sits, staring at his computers
There is a knock on his door
He turns and as it opens we hear the sober beginnings of a quiet celebration
He looks up and   is standing in his doorway
Well done
They did alright
wanted to give you a heads up
They are going to start sending some people home out here
Now
(He nods yes) Sorry
No loose ends
Of course
For what it's worth, you're good
Guess somebody upstairs must really like you
stands up and walks past  without another word
- 72                                                                    72 He heads down the hallway and passes the  and from the opening scene who are returning with boxes to lay off more people
heads off towards the elevator
- 73                                                                    73 The room has ten tables formally set that line a long wall of floor to ceiling windows with a commanding view of the city beyond
The room is empty except for   sitting at the last table
looks a little surprised to see  but waves him down
approaches
Sam, please sit
Congratulations are clearly in order
Our guys did what they could
() 92
73   :                                                       73 You did a hell of a job today, and thank you for it
Sit, excuse me for eating but it's been a long day
Can get you anything
No, no thanks
They just sit in silence for a long beat as  takes a few more bites of his meal
So what can  do for you
want out
'm sorry
'm done,  want out
It's been a very difficult day, for everyone
need you to release my options, that is if they're still worth anything after today, and  need the bonus
'm out
You'll get the bonus, the options, and keep your current base, but  need you to stay with me for another 24 months
They look at each other,  seems to know it's not actually a question
is a shell of himself as  takes another hearty bite of his meal
He finally looks up
(cont'd) For God's sake man put a smile on your face, you did some good today, you said so yourself
'm starting to feel a little better about this whole thing
You're one of the luckiest guys in the world, you could've been digging ditches all these years
pushes back his chair, stands, and prepares to leave
() 93
73   : (2)                                                73 That's true, and if  had been at least there'd be some holes in the ground to show for it
'm just not quite sure how we fucked this thing up so badly
This pushes  a bit too far
He also senses he may be losing
He drops his fork, and his tone changes
Jesus, when did you start feeling so sorry for yourself, it's unbearable
What, you think we may have helped put some people out of business today
That it's all just for naught
Well you've been doing that everyday for almost forty years Sam
And if all this is for naught then so is everything else out there
It's just money, it's made up, a piece of paper with some pictures on it so we don't all kill each other trying to get something to eat
But it's not wrong and it's certainly not any different today than it's ever been
Ever
1637, 1797, 1819, `37, `57,`84, 1901, `07, 1929, `37, `73, and 1987
God damn did that motherfucker fuck me up good, 92, 97, 2000, and whatever this is gonna be called
They're just the same thing over and over
We can't help ourselves, and you and  can't control it, stop it, slow it, or even ever so slightly alter it
We just react
and we get paid well for it if we're right
and get left by the side of the road if we're wrong
There's always been and there's always gonna be the same percentage of winners and losers, happy fucks and sad sacks, fat pigs and starving dogs in this world
yes there may be more of us today
but the percentages
they always stay exactly the same
They stare at each other for a long beat and then  looks down and takes another bite
