Written by Tom Stoppard Based on the novel by Leo Tolstoy
-- --Expert fingers--female, unlovely, capable--shape a small lump of dough which, with some shreds of cabbage, becomes a filled bun called a pirozhok
which is now placed on a baking tray to join rows of pirozhoki ready for the oven
-- One hand opens the oven, and, mittened by an apron, removes a tray of perfectly baked pirozhoki, which the other hand replaces with the fresh tray
slightly burning itself on a knuckle
: 1872 ,  ' 300    : , ,  -- Agafia sucks her knuckle and checks what's cooking on the stove-top
She is the cook-housekeeper
He needs to come in if he's to wash himself
Kitchen Maid at the sink obediently dries her hands on her apron dozing dog, Laska, pricks up her ears
, ,  -- It's snowing
The Kitchen Maid, shawled, with a lantern, makes her way across the yard towards the cowshed, a short distance, and pushes open the frozen door
Laska is at her heels, but is made to stay outside
, ,  -- The herd stirs at the lantern light
The bull, Berkut, with a ring through his nose, snorts as the girl goes by
At the back of the shed a cow is calving
Levin is midwifing, sleeves pulled back, blood and slime up to his elbows
He is 34
His steward, Vasili, holds up a lantern
Levin pulls carefully at the emerging forefeet
Good girl
good girl, Pava
The calf's head emerges
() Agafia Mishaylovna says dinner's like to spoil
The calf enters the world like a diver
Levin is feeling great pride and pleasure
her father's colour
Worth coming home for, Konstantin Dmitrich
stayed too long in Moscow
The cow nuzzles and licks her calf
, -- Cleaned up, in a smock shirt, Levin bites hungrily into a pirozhok, talking
He has a book on a book-rest
Agafia ladles soup for him
Three generations of family portraits look down on him
She's a beauty
That's twelve cows sired by Berkut
So one of you is doing what the good Lord made you for
Levin evades, ducks into spooning up soup, finding his place in his book
Agafia goes out
Alone, Levin closes the book and stares into himself
()-- --Expert fingers scrape a cut-throat razor across a lathered cheek
and again, skirting luxuriant facial hair on pampered skin
: ' , '  , ,  -- There is a door to the landing and a door to the bedroom
Prince Stepan Oblonsky-- Stiva to his friends--is 34 and liked by every- body
barber comes in every morning to shave him
His valet, Matvey, is older and almost a friend
He holds up an enormous pear
What should  do with this
Oblonsky puts the barber on hold to have a look
Where did you find it
In your hat
Your Excellency
Oblonsky thinks about it, lets the barber finish
He stands and removes his dressing gown
Yes
picked it up somewhere for Daria Alexandrovna and the children
Matvey is ready with Oblonsky's shirt, which he puts over his master's head like a horse's collar
" ,"  , -- There is a sloping lineup of five children, aged eight, five, four, three and two, dressed and brushed for presentation to their mother, Princess Daria Oblonsky, known as Dolly
who we now see is heavily pregnant
Stand- ing by is a French governess, Mlle
Roland, and a Nurse
Mlle
Roland is buxom
Dolly picks up the youngest, Vasya, to kiss him and hands him to the Nurse, and kisses the others in ascending order
Bonjour, Lili; bonjour, Masha; bonjour, Grisha; bonjour, Tanya
Who's coming to see Grandmama
'  ,  -- Oblonsky, dressed now and holding a cup of coffee, checks from the window
' -- Dolly, in furs, the four youngest children and the Nurse, who carries Vasya, all wrapped up against the cold weather, have come out of the house to a waiting sleigh, as noisy as starlings, bickering, competing, reprimanding
The Oblonsky's Coachman assists, with a rug to spread across knees
Oblonsky hands his coffee to Matvey and lights a small cigar
He detours to take a sugared almond from a dish of sweets, and leaves the room
,  , -- Tanya is at her lessons with Mlle
Roland
When Oblonsky's face appears smiling round the door, Tanya jumps up and runs to him, greeting him, laughing, kissing his face, hanging on his neck
My Tanruchoshka
Mind my cigar
He pops the sugared almond into her mouth and puts a conspiratorial finger to his lips
Mlle
Roland, who has stood up for him, clucks in reprimand
(') Be good today
'm off
Tanya runs back to her seat and bends to her schoolbook
Oblonsky looks Mlle
Roland in the eye
He moves his head slightly, unmistakably ask- ing her to come outside
Mlle
Roland moves her eyes at him in humorous reproach
Clearly, this is familiar ground
Oblonsky closes the door behind him
mlle
roland () Read the chapter carefully
'll come back to test you on it
Read it twice
(
)-- --Pretty fingers put on several rings, and then pick up a Faberge jade paper-knife to slit an envelope and withdraw a letter
: ' , 400 ' ,  , -- It is early in the day
Anna's maid, Annushka, has been dressing Anna
Annushka is young, loyal, modest
Anna is at her dressing-table-bureau, which is host to at least two pho- tographs of a small boy (Serozha) and a child's unframed drawing of "Maman
" As she starts reading the letter, Anna's eyes frown
,  ,  -- ( )-- Oblonsky and Mlle
Roland in a passionate embrace, vertical, clothed
Anna turns the page, reads on, concerned
-- ,    -- ,  -- Still kissing, Oblonsky hoists up her skirts
Anna turns to the second page
-- ,  -- Oblonsky, coming in quietly and late from a night on the town, enters his dressing room
He stops
He smiles a foolish apologetic smile
-- ( ) Dolly is waiting for him, shocked, enraged, holding out a billet-doux on pink paper: a love note
Anna speaks as in exasperation to a naughty child
Tsk, oh
Stiva
' ,  -- and Dolly found a note from the governess
Anna is speaking to her husband "confidentially
" Karenin, a busy man, drains his coffee cup and hands it (as with Oblonsky and Matvey) to his valet, Korney, who bows and withdraws
Karenin continues transferring papers from his desk to his portfolio
Which done, he nods to his private secretary, Mikhail Slyudin, who comes forward to receive it, bows and leaves
10 Well
Karenin is twenty years older than Anna and a senior figure in govern- ment
He has an unattractive reedy voice and is pleased with himself as a model of probity
He has the habit of cracking his knuckles
Stiva wants me to come to Moscow
to persuade Dolly to forgive him
'm to be deprived of my wife so that adul- tery may be forgiven
can't excuse him just because he's your brother
It's for Dolly's sake too
(has to go) have four committees today
There is another interruption: Serozha, aged seven and a half, and his tutor, Vasily Lukich, enter for a ritual "good morning
" Serozha is a little frightened of his father, but the mother and son are in love
Anna goes straight to Serozha, her heart lifted, to hug him
(') Good, good
-- have the world waiting for me, there's never time to look at your exercises
11 Sergei Alexeyich is doing very well, Your Excellency
(a button missing) Tsk-tsk, who put this shirt on you
Never mind
'll come and hear you read
Tomorrow, perhaps
Thank you, Lukich-- perhaps tomorrow
Lukich bows
Anna goes with Serozha, relinquishing him finally
She closes the door on them
Alexei, do you think nine years of mar- riage and children should count for nothing against a
an infatuation
Karenin cracks his knuckles, concedes
No
Very well
(kisses her hand) But sin has a price, you may be sure of that
'  , -- Oblonsky has been bunking down on his couch
He moans and groans
He gets up and tries the door to the bedroom
It's locked
He knocks timidly
12 () Dolly
please think of the children
He listens hopefully
The other door, leading to the upper landing, is opened violently by Dolly
You think of the children
Their lives are ruined now
She slams the door behind her
,  , -- Oblonsky comes out of his dressing room to see the main bedroom door slammed
He attempts to go in but the door is locked
Oh, Dolly
beg you
Matvey come to the top of the stairs with a telegram
Telegram
Should  send up the barber
No, just the razor
Oblonsky tears open the telegram
13 Don't worry, sir, things will shape them- selves, you'll see
() My sister Anna's coming tomorrow
We're saved
' , -- Inner doors open and Oblonsky comes out of his private office
He is his genial self
Everyone in the general office-- minor officials, clerks-- stands up for him and bows
Oblonsky is wearing government uniform--green coat with gold embroidery on the collar--instead of his own coat
Oblonsky is helped out of one coat into the other
Some man came without an appointment, Your Excellency
waiting outside
Oblonsky opens the door to look
Levin is sitting waiting on a bench, wear- ing a sheepskin coat, cap and scuffed boots
Levin
Where did you disappear
He seizes Levin and kisses him
() 'm very anxious to see you
need your advice
14 Well, then, come into my room
Oblonsky leads Levin back through the general office, where everyone stands up again
Levin's sheepskin and boots attract curious glances
(') This is my oldest friend, Konstantin Dmit- rich Levin
Someone send word 'll be a few minutes late
'  ,  -- Oblonsky leads Levin inside and closes the door
've been hard at it
Sit down
Levin undoes his coat and sits down
Hard at what exactly
Why, we're overwhelmed with work
Oh--paperwork
Paperwork is the soul of Russia
Farming is only the stomach
When am  going to come and shoot some snipe
Seeing the clothes Levin is wearing, he laughs
15 (') Oh, but look at you, in Western clothes you told me you'd never wear again
Some- thing's up
Yes
'm in love
've come back to propose
Have you guessed who she is
(rolls his eyes comically) have a suspicion
Why didn't you propose when you were here
decided it was impossible
Kitty is of the heavens, an angel, and  am of the earth-- but then  thought and thought, and
there's no life for me without her
Do have a chance
Of course you do
The Shcherbatskys are giving a soiree this evening
Get there early before the crowd
If  may suggest
Anything
What
New boots
Right
Anything else
16 () We'd better have dinner together
Come on, we'll meet later at l'Angleterre
Or do you prefer the Hermitage
Oblonsky ushers Levin back into the general office
,  -- Everyone stands up as before
The Doorkeeper produces Oblonsky's top- coat and helps him into it
No--five-thirty at l'Angleterre-- owe them more than the Hermitage, so it wouldn't be fair to withdraw my custom
(taking his hat) Boots, and a coat
And a proper hat
He ushers Levin out
' , -- Firstly, a Moscow street scene, busy with people going about their business, on foot and in conveyances
Secondly, Levin approaches 'Angleterre in his new fur-collared coat, top hat and boots
17 ' , -- Oblonsky and Levin preside over the debris of three dozen oysters, with champagne in a bucket to hand
Oblonsky is in a maudlin mood, afloat on champagne
It's so unfair
You marry for love, you're a good husband
Children arrive
Years depart
And all of a sudden your wife is tired, her hair is thin, her body
while you yourself still have your
vigour
and you find yourself distracted by a pretty woman
Forgive me, but  find that incomprehen- sible
As though 'd leave this restaurant and steal a roll from a baker's shop
Well, you know, a freshly baked roll
But 'm talking about love, and you're talk- ing about
your appetite
Easily confused
Now look, do you know Count Vronsky
Who
No
Why
18 He's your rival
He turned up from St
Petersburg after you left
() Who is he
( ) You don't have to worry about him
He's one of those rich, good-looking cavalry offi- cers who've got nothing to do but make love to pretty women
waiter arrives to remove the oyster shells, while an Elderly Waiter places a bowl of soup in front of Levin and a lobster in front of Oblonsky
(') Cabbage soup
Potage aux choux a la Russe, as the gentle- man ordered
It's what  wanted
Oblonsky laughs
The Waiter departs
(') () Understand that for me, tonight is a ques- tion of life and death
19 Oh, Kostya
Kitty would be mad to refuse you
And Dolly is on your side, you know
She says her sister Kitty was always meant to be your wife and will be
Levin jumps up in elation, collects himself, and sits
Dolly said that
've always thought your Dolly's a gem
Oh, she is, she is
() loved her to distraction
(
)-- little out of focus and further obscured by puffs of steam, the wheels of a locomotive and its tender plus a carriage or two, with part of the superstructure--the whole kit and caboodle turning out to be a rich child's table-top model railway--go by the Camera like a  revealing the momentarily gigantic face of Anna
who is crouching down to watch the toy go by
,  -- Serozha is at present snivelling
But why
20 Because that's where Aunt Dolly lives
But why
() told you, Serozha
She's not well
must go to see her
But why
Now, don't make Mama cry
'll be back before you know, and bring you a present
Don't want a present
want you to stay
Anna is on the brink of tears
Oh
my little Kutik
What present
That's better
She dabs her eyes
21 -- Kapitonich, the Karenins' Hall Porter, an "old soldier," comes out of the house to where a private carriage is waiting
The coachman is Konrad
Anna comes out with Annushka, who has a large soft bag containing everything her mistress needs for the journey
Kapitonich holds the carriage door for them
-- Anna has a window seat
Next to her is Annushka
In the opposite window seat is Countess Vronsky, at sixty losing the battle to keep her youthful beauty
She has a lap dog (and perhaps a Faberge-topped walking cane)
Next to her is her Maid
Anna is not happy to be leaving
She holds a small framed photo of Sero- zha, which she then puts away in her red bag
Countess Vronsky smiles at her
Anna wipes her eyes, explains
It's the first time 've left my little boy
So you are leaving your son and  am return- ing to mine
am Countess Vronsky
Anna knows the name
countess vronsky (cont'd) 've been in St
Petersburg for the christen- ing of a granddaughter--my elder son mar- ried Princess Chirkov
You're a charming creature
Why don't  know you
22 've never been in Moscow society, really
But you know my name
've heard you mentioned
Talked about, you mean
Ah, love
Anna, found out, smiles tentatively
Was it love
Always
My sons are ashamed of me
But 'd rather end up wishing  hadn't than end up wishing  had--wouldn't you
don't know
Anna looks at the snow on the window
She is unsettled by the conversation
-- sleigh (i
e
, a cab) brings Levin
23 ,  , -- The Hall Porter lets Levin into the house
Footman takes Levin's hat and coat
Levin is uneasy--he seems to be first to arrive
He decides he has come too early
He pulls his coat back from the Footman
'll come back
Princess Ekaterina (Kitty) Shcherbatsky is eighteen
Eager to see who has arrived, she hurries from the direction of the reception room and looks down into the entrance hall in time to see Levin snatch his hat back from the Footman
Konstantin
'm too early
() No
Come up
Kitty runs off out of Levin's view
He flings his hat and coat at the Foot- man and runs up the stairs
24 ,  , -- Levin hurries in and finds Kitty seated prettily in a "receiving" pose
She is alone
Look at me
'm receiving for Papa and Maman who are late to dress
It's my first reception
Levin plays along, kissing her hand elaborately
Princess Ekaterina
Delighted, delighted
( ) 'm so pleased you were able to be with us, Konstantin Dmitrich
( ) Kitty
you look
you look-- Stiva told us you were back
How long are you staying
don't know
It depends on you
On me
25 He has got ahead of himself
Doors are flung open and the hosts, Prince and Princess Shcherbatsky, and a crowd of guests who have arrived together, are greeting each other
Levin has to make a quick decision, and he makes the wrong one--to go on
What  mean to say-- came with only one purpose-- want to--will you be my wife
Kitty panics
wave of Guests is almost upon her
(') 'm sorry--sorry--wrong moment--but will you
can't
'm sorry
Kitty flees
Levin seems stunned, surrounded now by greetings, laughter, and servants with trays of drinks
Yes
It was impossible
Prince and Princess Shcherbatsky receive a young married member of Kitty's set, Countess Nordston
and introduce Levin, who hears and sees noth- ing
He turns away, leaving the Countess hung out to dry
Levin finds himself face to face with Burisov, a silky Officer in sky blue uniform, who introduces himself
Burisov
Are you the brother of Nikolai Levin
26 Yes
He's in Moscow, he's staying at the Unicorn in Khitrovka
How do you know
() It's the sort of thing  know
He bows to Levin and turns away to greet someone
Levin reacts, decides to leave
He makes for the door
He nearly collides with someone, gives and receives an apology, and suddenly understands who this man in Guards uniform must be
Levin turns
Count Vronsky
Yes
Levin pauses awkwardly
Vronsky hesitates, bows and continues on
Levin witnesses Kitty seeing Vronsky approaching, and sees her face light up
Vronsky kisses her hand
(') () Princess Kitty
It's been so long, and yet it seems like yesterday
His banter is lost on her
She laughs happily
27 It was yesterday
Levin turns away and leaves
-- Levin comes out of the grand house where several coaches are waiting
Hum- bled and angry with himself and the world, he takes off his top hat and considers putting his fist through it, but jams it back on his head
horse- cab comes along
Levin waves it down
, -- mean street, an area of poverty and crime
Levin pays off his cab
, -- Levin goes up a dimly lit, dingy staircase
Snatches of  and - drift up the stairs
Levin knocks at a door, then louder
The door is flung open
Nikolai Levin is the spirit of consumptive, bohemian radicalism
He peers at Levin, surprised
It's Kostya
Nikolai roars with laughter which turns to wheezing
28 God, look at him
You look like a capitalist
( ) What do you want
Nothing
came to see you
Nikolai goes back into the room, shouting for "Masha
" Levin follows him
' , ,  -- Levin sees that he is in a tiny apartment
Young Woman looks at him fearfully from the inner doorway
Good evening, miss
madame
Don't talk to her like that
It frightens her
You sound like a magistrate
(shouts at her) More vodka for my brother, quick about it
don't want anything
Masha goes to Nikolai and whispers to him, calming him
'm all right
He fills a wineglass with vodka and gulps it greedily
29 (') Who told you where to find me
colonel in the Third Department
They're watching you
Good
They must think 'm dangerous
Levin involuntarily smiles at the self-puffery
(') What have you got to smile about
Nothing
That's right
The day is coming
gave up my birthright for it
You're on the wrong side of history
Not because privilege is immoral but because it's irrational
Wheezing, he goes for the bottle again
Masha tries to take it from him, appealing to Levin
He is sick
Let go or 'll beat your lights out
He pushes her away and pours himself more vodka
30 (') took Mary Nikolova from a brothel but consider her my wife
If her presence offends you you're free to leave
Are you married
No
Why not
Are you waiting to fall in love
No
Good
Romantic love will be the last illu- sion of the old order
You should marry one of your peasants
Levin's reaction is almost violent, surprising Nikolai
Yes
damn well should
(toasts, casually) The brotherhood of man
Levin recovers himself
He takes out his wallet
Nikolai, you have to see a doctor
Then come and stay with me at Pokrovskoe till you get your health back
31 () With my wife
Levin becomes flustered
If you
or go abroad to a spa
'll send you more if that's what you
Masha reaches for the money Levin has put on the table
Nikolai knocks her hand away
He throws the banknotes at Levin
He coughs himself into a paroxysm
Levin tries to embrace him
Nikolai throws him off
(') ( ) What about the brotherhood of brothers
Masha snatches up the banknotes
()-- There is a scattering of people of all classes on the platform waiting for the arriving train
By the entrance/exit gate, a Guards Officer stands holding a bouquet
The Stationmaster stands by
strip of faded red carpet has been laid on the planks
The private coach will stop opposite the carpet
The Guards Officer nods
He sees Vronsky arriving
32 Hello, what's this
Austrian royalty on their honeymoon
've got them for four days
Bad luck
What do they like
Art
Food
Here's the train
,   , -- Vronsky moves closer to the slowing train, scanning the windows going by
,  -- The Guards Officer and the Stationmaster are disconcerted to see the obvious "private coach" stop seriously short (or long) behind luggage wagons, etc
'll see to it
He hurries away towards the engine
Oblonsky hurries through, relieved not to be late
33 ,  -- Vronsky is saluted by his mother's Major Domo, a tall man in livery with a cockade
Second carriage, Your Excellency
'll see to the Countess's luggage and bring it on to the house
Vronsky nods, and makes his way towards the second coach, against the flow of disembarked passengers
(), The Stationmaster speaks to the Engine Driver
/ ,  -- The Guards Officer with the bouquet stands uncertainly while arriving passengers go past him
" ,"  -- The Royal Austrian Honeymooners peer anxiously through the window
,  -- Countess Vronsky remains sitting
Annushka packs away Anna's blanket and pillow
Anna looks out of the window
34 'll come back
Anna moves to the door opening on to the "porch
" Vronsky is on the point of entering
He steps back to allow her by
They barely exchange a glance as she passes him, but, simultaneously, each of them looks back
Anna looks away quickly
His look lingers before he turns away to enter the carriage
/
-- Anna, from her vantage point spots Oblonsky, calls to him
Annushka, with her bag, comes onto the porch and descends to follow her mistress
,  -- Anna steps down to the platform and embraces Oblonsky
They are delighted to see each other
() You don't look ashamed
() am,  really am
,  -- Countess Vronsky remains in her seat
Vronsky bends at the window, look- ing at Oblonsky and Anna
35 Yes, of course
Oblonsky's sister
Karenina
Charmante, don't you think
(to her Maid) Wait for me in the carriage
'll take Tosca
She takes the dog
The Maid leaves with her bag
You stayed longer in St
Petersburg
Long enough for you to start a little love affair,  hear
can't think what you're referring to, Maman
He glances back to the window, where Anna turns back to enter the train
,  -- As Anna turns back, a Railwayman with a hammer for tapping wheels is in her way
He steps back for her with a bow and a "Madame
" Anna glances at him and moves past him
The man taps a wheel, making a ring- ing sound which means the wheel is okay
As Anna mounts the steps, a Train Guard looks up and down the plat- form, holding a green flag
36 ,  -- Anna enters from the porch
There, Countess, you have found your son and  have found my brother
Madame Karenin has a son, too
It's the first time they have been apart, so she frets about him
Excuse me for not recognizing you before
We passed the time telling each other about our sons
Yes, 've been hearing all about you
That must have been very boring for you
The ringing sound of the wheel-tapper's hammer is faintly audible in Anna's hesitation
Anna shuts off the gallantry
Au revoir, Countess
Au revoir, my dear
Let me kiss your pretty face
37 Countess Vronsky does so
Anna turns to offer her hand to Vronsky
As Vronsky takes her hand, the train lurches and moves, unsteadying them both
,  -- Oblonsky-- and everyone still on the platform--is shocked by a dreadful scream and shouting
The train, having moved a few feet, stops
Oblonsky hurries towards the scene of the accident, right opposite the gate
The Station- master overtakes him
,  , The Wheel-Tapper lies between the wheels, mangled
Oblonsky joins the horrified onlookers
The Guards Officer arrives, too, with his bouquet
Then Vronsky arrives
He turns to the Guards Officer
Keep your people inside until this has been cleared up
-- Countess Vronsky, Vronsky, Anna and Oblonsky, Oblonsky almost in tears, come towards the gate
Porter follows with Anna's large suitcase, hat- boxes, etc
Annushka has the travelling bag
the sole support of a large family, they say
38 Can't anything be done for them
Vronsky glances at her
Wait for me, Maman
Vronsky retraces his steps
( ) 've you to thank for that
She knows her son
Anna hasn't understood, but when Oblonsky looks back he sees Vronsky with the Stationmaster, taking money from his wallet
What a good fellow
Anna catches on, doesn't like it
-- Have you known Count Vronsky long
Did you like him
He's in love with Kitty
Oh
() But we should be discussing you and Dolly
39 She scolds him like a naughty boy
(') What have you got to say for yourself
've said it all--on my knees--in tears
Now  need you to say it
'm going to the office, so you'll have Dolly to yourself
() Don't be home late
,  , -- Dolly pours tea for Anna
Dolly smiles at her wanly-- brightly
Kitty's coming by to see you
She's all grown-up, and a bit frightened of you--the belle of St
Petersburg society
Is that who  am
Dolly
Stiva has told me
Dolly bursts into tears
Anna embraces her
(') Dolly, 'm sorry from the bottom of my heart
40 don't know what to do
() know,  know
can't bear to be with him
And he doesn't care, he's got what he wants
What he wants is you
He loves you, Dolly
You and the children are everything to him
Are we
And there is room for a governess
That was shameful, disgraceful
But it was not love
It was the animal in man, not the soul
Stiva's remorse is from the soul
What about me
Does his remorse make it easier for me
-- know you are suffering
But, Dolly, you must tell me
is there enough love left in your heart
enough to forgive him
When  think of them together,  can't for- give him, no
41 My poor lamb
So you'd rather accept your fate
My fate
() But  haven't done anything
It's him '-- Do you love him, Dolly
Dolly nods tearfully
(') You love him, and he loves you, but you can't forgive, so your lives must continue like this for ever, with both of you wretched
She's winning
,  -- Anna, Kitty, Tanya and Grisha are at a handsome card table where board games, dominoes, cards, etc
, are kept
There is a spill of alphabet bricks, each with a letter printed in it
They are spelling out their names in alphabet bricks
Grisha is on Anna's lap pulling at her hair
The spelling business, including misspellings by Grisha, creates a noise of laughter and mock-rebuke
Tanya at the same time is trying to pull a ring from Anna's finger
Kitty is not at all frightened of Anna now; enraptured by her, laughing
42 Grisha, don't pull so hard, you're getting it all in a tangle--and look for another  for -- (She takes off her ring for Tanya) --here, darling, you can wear it till you go -- Dolly sits apart, embroidering
She looks up at the sound of voices down- stairs, Oblonsky coming home
The children hear their father and abandon the card table, running out to greet him
Dolly stands up to leave by a dif- ferent door, giving Anna a collusive glance
Anna pushes aside the alphabet bricks
(') Well, that's the end of that
Will you stay for the Bobrishchev's ball, Anna
Oh
always feel dull at a ball
How can you ever be dull
Oblonsky arrives in the doorway with Tanya and Grisha hanging on him
(') Stiva
Tell Anna she must come to the ball
Of course she must
43 He cocks an eye at Anna: how did it go with Dolly
Anna moves her head: upstairs
and God go with you
Kitty catches the moment
() You can introduce me to your new governess
She's old
She's a hundred
Which leaves Anna and Kitty alone
know why you want me to come
You want everyone to be there because you're sure it's going to be your night
How did you know
Anna's smile is her acting out a mock-mysteriousness
know everything
She has moved alphabet letters around to spell out
She laughs at Kitty's tearful, joyful nodding, genuinely happy for Kitty
(') Oh, to be your age again
surrounded by that blue mist, like mist on the mountains 44 that clears slowly to reveal the terrifying, beautiful valley you must enter to become grown-up
was eighteen too, when got married
quiet note of regret hangs in the air between them for a moment before Anna dispels it
,  -- With only a lamp or two lit, and the door open, Anna sits alone at the card table, with a neglected book, one hand playing idly with the alpha- bet bricks
Their pleasant clicks are the only sound as she remains lost in thought
She closes her book, marking the place
She is going to go up to bed
She hears the sound of the doorbell
,  , -- Vronsky has been let in spattered with snow
no, Your Excellency
He's just gone up
The Princess retired early
Is there a message
Vronsky glances up and sees Anna looking down
Their eyes meet
second passes
Vronsky is about to speak
Anna turns away and moves out of his view, towards further stairs, with her book
No
45 -- Levin is coming home in a sleigh, driven by his one-eyed coachman, Ignat
He is huddled under a bearskin blanket
The house is in sight
The sleigh overtakes a Peasant Woman, Serafina, walking to the house car- rying a big bundle of willow wands strapped to her back: a strong young woman with a handsome face
She stops and bows her head
Levin looks at her
She then looks him in the face
Laska, barking joyfully, races from the house
, -- The bathhouse has a stove which heats water
There is a brazier to create instant steam, but not now
Levin, almost naked, lies on a plank deck, thoughtful, staring at something
no, at someone: Serafina, who is put- ting on her clothes
Postcoitum
She has no angst
Dressed, she crosses herself
Will you go to confession
Serafina nods indifferently
(') God will forgive you
And you also, master
He is watching
God forgive us then, for committing the act of love
She nods without irony
46 He is merciful
"Not according to my deserts,  Lord, but according to thy mercy"--that's a fine prayer
But 'm full of doubt
Sometimes even doubt that God exists
How can there be anything if God didn't make it
don't know
One day science will tell us
That's sinful talk if the priest heard you
Well,  won't go to confession
() Your father built the church
You're con- fessed a while yet
Levin feels outplayed
(') Will you bring me something from Moscow
What would you like
47 Soap, the kind wrapped in paper to look pretty, and smelling like for a proper lady
Levin is touched
He nods
--
, -- Kitty enters the Ball, a proper lady
This is a gilded affair, conducted by a Master of Ceremonies
The Host and Hostess are positioned to welcome each guest
Dancing has started-- a waltz
Kitty and her parents enter the ballroom and are received by their hosts
Everything has come together for Kitty--her dress, her hair, her skin, her moment
She radiates happiness
An Officer stands aside to let them pass, openly admiring Kitty, smoothing his moustache
Youth having trouble with his white tie hurries past but turns back to Kitty
Kitty
May  have a waltz
You may, Boris
'll save you the third just because it's your first ball
() You're my first conquest
The Master of Ceremonies, Korsunsky, arrives and without permission sweeps her into the waltz
48 It's a relaxation to dance with you, Princess
Kitty sees Anna arriving with Oblonsky and gives a little gasp at her God-given beauty
(') But back to work
Where do you want to be taken
There
Korsunsky waltzes her brilliantly through the dancers and twirls her to rest in front of a small group including Anna and Oblonsky-- floating Kitty's train
() So that your ankles may be seen
Anna appraises Kitty at a glance and gives her a tiny nod signifying top marks
Kitty glows
How are you, Stiva
Thanks to Anna,  am a happy man
Would you like to dance
No, ask Anna
49 () No
don't
She looks up and sees Vronsky coming straight towards her
(') Come on then
Just as Vronsky is about to bow, she takes Oblonsky's arm and he whirls her away
Kitty smiles for Vronsky but his eyes have followed Anna, know- ing she cut him
He remembers himself after an awkward hiatus
Kitty's mother and father are watching from afar
Vronsky obliges
He invites her into the waltz
this vile, idiotic matchmaking of yours
For goodness' sake, what have  done
Levin is a thousand times better than this Petersburg fop
If he had royal blood my daughter wouldn't need him
Vronsky's mind is absent and the waltz ends after only a few steps
He stand waiting for the music to start
Is anything the matter
50 No
You look
as lovely as ever, Princess Kitty
The music starts and they dance on
At the end of the waltz, Vronsky leaves Kitty with her mother, bows and departs
Princess Shcherbatsky is beginning to have doubts
She starts to ask
() Don't ask me, Maman
Boris the Youth pops up to claim his dance
Dancing, Kitty sees Vronsky talking to a couple of Officers
She is anxious but not disillusioned
Grumpy Prince Shcherbatsky is dancing with Countess Nordston
He'll dance the mazurka with Kitty, you'll see
call the mazurka the now-or-never
Anna watches the dancing
She rejects an offer with a smile
She sees Vron- sky and to her discomfort Vronsky looks up and catches her looking
She turns away at once, and notices that ladies are curtseying and men are bowing as the Host and Hostess escort an overweight but glittering young couple towards a decorative buffet in an adjoining salon: the Austrian royal honeymooners
attended by the Guards Officer from the station
Anna stands and curtseys as they pass by into the salon
where Oblonsky is roaring with laughter, champagne in hand
we were shut up in the train for an hour
51 Anna steals a sidelong glance towards Vronsky but he is no longer there
She looks for him among the dancers, smiles at Kitty going by with the enthusiastic, inexpert Boris
Suddenly, Vronsky is at Anna's side
Dance with me
() am not used to being spoken to like that by a man  met once at a railway station
dare say, but if 'm not to dance with you, 'm getting out of this operetta and going home
Then, for Kitty's sake
She gives him her hand
Kitty looks for Vronsky, can't see him, then is taken aback to see him with Anna
Kitty watches Anna dancing
Anna says something which makes Vronsky laugh
Anna laughs
Anna blossoms in front of Kitty's eyes
Vron- sky twirls Anna around and she comes smiling into his arms
It goes on like that
Kitty watches them from within the arms of young men, old men, from the wall
Anna and Vronsky dance slow, they dance fast, gaily, solemnly, gazes locked
Others are noticing too: Countess Nordston, Princess Shcherbatsky, and eagle-eyed matrons
Anna, oblivious, has found a release in herself
52 Countess Nordston finds Kitty sitting alone
Korsunsky announces the Mazurka
You're not dancing the mazurka
won't have it
She pulls Kitty to her feet
countess nordston (cont'd) 'm engaged by General Glub-- give him to you
Korsunsky supervises a large circle of couples who change partners as they go round, with one couple dancing in the middle of the circle
the lady chooses a lady and a gentleman
The lady in the middle beckons to Anna and the man who, changing part- ners, happens to be dancing with her
They enter the middle where they have their solo turn as a couple, while the original couple reenter the circum- ference
Anna is flushed with pleasure
Among the surrounding dancers, Vronsky has no eyes for his partner, only for Anna
Kitty, dancing, watches Vronsky incredulous
(') ( ) and the lady chooses a lady and a gentleman
53 Anna looks smilingly around the dancing circle and sees Kitty staring at her
Anna "wakes up
" Everything which made her drunk makes her sober in the instant
She waits until the change of partners brings Kitty and Vronsky together
She beckons them into the middle
Her own partner expects to re-join the circumference with Anna, but she makes an apology and escapes through the circle, running towards the door
With a howl and clatter, the St
Petersburg express seems to crash through the ballroom
An abstract, nightmarish, discordant noise of clattering and howling accompanies unexplained flame--light on wood, glass, iron
blackness opens like a door on a blizzard of light, and slams shut
Anna's face, eyes closed, floats ghostlike
,  -- Anna comes to consciousness in the dimly lit carriage, making sense of what seems like a hallucination
Wind and snow batter on the window
The Carriage Stoker, in long coat and cap, deals with the stove, clears frost off a thermometer on the wall
He leaves, opening the door to snow and wind and slamming it behind him
-- The train "speeds" (35 m
p
h
) through a blizzard
54 Anna has a reading lamp hooked over her armrest, and a novel
She cuts a page with a paper-knife
But the book cannot hold her
She is reading without taking it in
She turns back a page and tries again, but almost at once she turns to the window where the dark reflection of her face looks back at her
Kitty's face staring as she stared at Anna, betrayed
Anna turns away from the window
The Guard comes through the door, letting in wind and snow, and shuts it
He walks through the carriage
Bologoye
Fifteen minutes
The train is slowing
-- The train clanks to a halt at a small station
Anna (and a few others) get down from the train
She wears a heavy cloak
The wind blows a few snowflakes through the station but the roof keeps off the snow
She is glad of the fresh air
Here and there, men are walking, smoking, laughing together
She feels better
tall outline of a man in a greatcoat and military cap emerges from the flickering gloom
She catches her breath
He salutes her
Can  be of service to you
didn't know you were
Why are you leaving
55 You know why
have to be where you are
can't not
This is wrong
If you're a good man, forget everything that happened, as  will
'll never forget a single thing about you, not a word, not a gesture-- That's enough
She climbs the steps on to the porch
At the door to the carriage she pauses
The encounter has left her feeling elated and frightened
,
-- The train arrives
Vronsky gets down from the train and starts to walk towards Anna's carriage
His German valet, Franz, runs up to him (from second class)
Take the luggage home
Franz runs back the other way
Vronsky walks on, then stops when he sees Karenin waiting on the platform, smiling and going forward to hand Anna down the steps
Kapitonich enters the carriage
Vronsky hesitates
() Is Serozha all right
56 Oh, is that all  get
Yes, he's quite well
Vronsky steps forward
Anna knows he's there
She angles herself to avoid looking at him
Did you have a good night
He bows to Karenin
Yes, quite comfortable
Count Vronsky
Karenin extends a hand indifferently then dismisses Vronsky, drawing Anna with him
have to get back to the Committee
He walks Anna away
(') Well--were you a success
Oh--Dolly and Stiva
yes,  think so
Vronsky watches them go
57 ' ,
-- snowy St
Petersburg street
Vronsky arrives home by cab
He has a flat in an old apartment block
' ,
, -- Vronsky rings the doorbell
Servant opens the door
male voice shouts "If it's someone demanding money, don't let him in
" 'll announce myself
Veronsky enters the main room
The occupant of the flat is a 2nd Lieuten- ant, Petritsky, wearing his greatcoat over shirt and trousers
Vronsky
The master himself
Baroness, coffee from the new coffeepot for Count Vronsky
Petritsky indicates a pretty young woman in satin
(') hope you are pleased by this ornament to your quarters
Vronsky bows and kisses her fingers
'll be off home if 'm in the way
58 You're at home where you are, Baroness
Ah
--Pierre, you never say such pretty things to me
We were just discussing my husband
He won't divorce me, you see
And do you know why
No
Because he likes eating off my family silver
Ah
want to bring an action
Just because 'm supposed to be unfaithful,  don't see why have to eat off Pierre's crockery
Look at it
It's my crockery
How was Moscow
Provincial
59 ' ,  -- Anna, her dress changed, lies on Serozha's bed, on her side, one arm under his bedclothes scratching his back gently
He lies quietly on his stomach, with his eyes closed, his face inches from hers
In the dim light of a night- light she gazes at him for long moments
() You've stopped
She resumes scratching
He grunts contentedly
(') () Thank you for my present
Sssh
She kisses him and continues to lie there, gently scratching
He falls quickly asleep
She removes her arm and restores his bedclothes
,  -- There is a suite of rooms: the Bedroom connects to Anna's Boudoir/Dressing Room; and thence to Karenin's small Sitting Room/Dressing Room, which connects to the rest of the house
The rooms--like the whole house-- are lit by gas lamps but also by candles at key points
60 '  ,  -- Korney, the Valet, gathers up a discarded shirt, etc
Karenin in a dressing gown is reading in a comfortable chair, by a candle lamp
Korney leaves
,  -- Anna is at her bureau
She frowns and tears up the letter she is writing
,  -- Karenin looks at the clock-- nearly midnight-- and closes his book
He blows out the candle
He comes to the boudoir announcing himself with a smile
Time for bed
,  -- Karenin comes to put his hand on Anna's shoulder
'm writing to Dolly
and to Kitty
You are
good
Anna shakes her head and clasps his hand
61 ,  -- Candles each side of the bed
Karenin cracks his knuckles
He unlocks a drawer and opens a tin box lying in the drawer
Anna, disrobing, registers these sounds
What are they saying in Moscow about the new Statute
What new Statute
Karenin takes a contraceptive sheath, made from animal intestine (re- usable) from the tin
The new Statute  carried in Council
Anna blows her candle out and gets into bed
No one mentioned it
Ah
Really
He comes to bed in his nightshirt
(') Here it made quite a sensation
He gets into bed
Anna waits dead-eyed
Karenin blows his candle out
62 ' ,  , -- Kitty, a hollow-eyed version of herself, in a demure nightdress, sits upright on a chaise longue with her legs stretched out
The Family Doctor deferen- tially removes one of her slippers as though it were an intimate garment
Forgive me, Princess, but  must
With a silver "fork" the Doctor tests the sole of her foot for a reflex
Kitty is miserably going along with a farce she despises
' ,  -- The Prince and Princess are hovering
The Princess flutters with anxiety, the Prince is in a temper
Am  the only one who knows what's wrong with her
But a Celebrity Doctor, as shiny as his own gold watch which he is check- ing, is bearing down on them, riding over a Footman's attempt to announce him
Oh, thank God, doctor--my friends say you're the only one who can save her
Possibly, Princess, possibly
At your service, Your Excellencies
Where is the patient
63 ' ,  -- Kitty is sobbing with shame: the Celebrity Doctor has stripped her to the waist and is tapping her chest
The Family Doctor can't bear it and excuses himself
Come, come, Princess, we are not backward people-- handle naked bodies every day
Deep breath now
' ,  -- The Family Doctor and the parents are in a huddle
The Prince is apoplectic
By God
'll challenge the scoundrel
It's the modern way
(to the Prince) You're not a doctor
Her symptoms
loss of appetite, fast -- Well, whose pulse wouldn't be fast if some brute of a-- The Celebrity Doctor comes briskly out of Kitty's room, checking his watch
64 Nervous palpitations
We must treat the nerves
tubercular cavity is suspected, too soon to tell
Soden water every two hours must see her again tomorrow
( ) Prince
Princess
He's gone
The Prince enters Kitty's room
' ,  -- Kitty is humiliated and triple-wrapped against the violation of her bosom
Don't you fret, my little Kate
You'll wake up one fine morning and say to yourself--" feel well and happy and 'll go out for a walk with Papa
" The Prince is mortified when Kitty's sobs redouble
,
-- The social set Anna now moves in is the brilliant circle with connections to the Court on one hand and to the demi-monde of artists on the other leading light of this set is Princess Betsy Tverskaya, a rich society beauty
Betsy's immediate circle includes Tuskevich, her "admirer
" Anna lifts her eyes to see Vronsky in front of her, talking to Betsy
Vronsky sees Anna and bows
She acknowledges him and kisses Betsy, and moves on, studying the next picture
Vronsky watches Anna move on
Betsy cocks an eye at him
65 ,
-- few rows of chairs in someone's reception room, a mixed audience of guests, a flashy pianist
Betsy with a "toy" dog on her lap, Tuskevich on one side, Anna on the other
The dog yaps and sneezes
Betsy hands the dog to Tuskevich, who goes to exit with the dog
As Tuskevich leaves, Vronsky comes in
Anna sees him
She turns back to the piano
Betsy glances at her
,
-- Anna and Betsy, on a bright snow-white day, are being driven through a park in Betsy's smart equipage
towards a horseman walking towards them: Vronsky salutes the little carriage as it trots by him
Anna keeps looking straight ahead
Betsy acknowledges Vronsky's salute
want to give a small dinner before the opera
Is there anyone you would like me to ask
Yes
Yes, the Metropolitan Bishop of St
Petersburg
Betsy laughs
, -- Annushka puts Anna's opera cloak over her shoulders, while Korney stands ready with Karenin's cloak and opera hat
Karenin comes down the stairs to join Anna
Kapitonich stands ready to let them out
66 Countess Lydia tells me you haven't been to one of her evenings since you returned
The last one was to meet a missionary, the one before was for a lecture on the union of the Greek and Roman churches
( ) 'm sorry-- know you're fond of her
Come on, or we'll be late
Kapitonich opens the door to let them out
" ,"
-- This is a small theatre with a "promenade" area where a group of Guards Officers of high and low rank mix together to enjoy the chanteuses, the comedians and the can-can girls
Vronsky is with his Commanding Officer, Colonel Demin
Here's the thing, Vronsky
posting has come up and there's a promotion in it for you
Thank you, sir
The garrison in Tashkent
67 Tashkent
But
would like to stay in Peter, sir, if you don't mind
don't mind
But your mother
The can-can music starts up, to many cheers
Demin claps enthusiastically
Vronsky is angry
,
-- An attendant takes Vronsky's coat and gives him a token for it
There is a performance going on within, resolving into applause as he mounts the stairs
Karenin, an escapee looking at his pocket watch, comes down the stairs, goes down past Vronsky, looks back at him for a moment, and continues
'  -- Vronsky enters the box as the performance prepares to resume
It is the Tverskoy box, occupied by Princess Betsy and her husband, who is likeable, overweight and, strangely enough, looking at an antiquarian book; wear- ing white gloves
Vronsky bows to them and sits down next to Betsy
He takes her opera glasses and looks through them at the Karenin box
You didn't come to my dinner
had to see my Commanding Officer
68 "She" didn't come either
Vronsky watches Anna through the glasses
Countess Lydia Ivanovna is next to her
Lydia is in her forties, sallow, no beauty, sincerely religious, and determined
,  -- work never ceases for great men
Your husband is a saint and we must all cherish him for Russia's sake
Anna winces a smile
(') hope you can come on afterwards--Father Kristof's report on the Chinese mission will be with lantern slides
'm expected at the Tverskoys
No doubt, but 'm sure Princess Betsy can wait for you, my dear
Anna glances at Betsy's box and sees Vronsky there
The opera resumes
Yes
In fact,  think  won't go to Betsy's
69 ,  -- Vronsky looks through Betsy's glasses
You're caught
'm afraid  am becoming ridiculous
'  , -- Discreet Footmen move chairs to accommodate the guests who move to join one of the conversation circles that make a buzz in the room
Betsy sits by the samovar with her little court, including Tuskevich
The Guests include the Princess Myagkaya, stout, red-faced, outspoken, and two Society ladies, Lisa Merkalova and "Anna's Friend
" Vronsky arrives
Now, there's a phenomenon, look-- Anna's shadow has arrived before Anna
' 'm Anna's friend
but this making-up- one's-mind-to-it in public is not polite to a distinguished man like Karenin
In my opinion Karenin is a fool, and Anna is the best of us
70 And we all love you for your contrary opin- ions, Princess
Vronsky looks around
He knows everybody in the room
Alexei
You look desperate
That's not attractive
'm losing hope
Hope of what
Persuading a virtuous woman to break her marriage vows
And how is Tuskevich
That's not attractive either
Besides,  was never virtuous
No--you're right
She won't come
'm going home
,
-- The Karenin coach arrives
It's Anna arriving at Betsy's
She enters the house in almost unseemly haste
Several coaches are waiting
71 ,
,  -- Vronsky, in a state, lets himself be carried along
Then he changes his mind
He puts his head out of the window to shout to the Coachman
Turn round
'  , -- Anna enters
Faces turn to her
She glances around
She knows at once that Vronsky isn't there
Betsy beckons to her across the room
Anna, self- possessed, smiling, nodding to friends, pressing a hand held out to her, offering the other hand to be kissed, glides through a crowd of Betsy's guests
Wasn't Nilsson glorious
One sees that she has studied Kaulbach, of course
There's something Louis Quinze about Tuskevich
as if he came with the furniture
Betsy is smoking elegantly
She kisses Anna
He's gone
But you're just in time for the surprise
There is a series of minor explosions outside and the darkness out there turns into an illuminated garden lit by fountains of fire, sprays of light
The guests react with cries of pleasure and applause
72 Anna turns at once to the window near her, puts her face up against the glass, putting her hands to her temples as if to see the illuminations better
Her self-possessed face, lit by fireworks, falls apart in misery
The firework display continues for a short minute and is applauded
Betsy acknowledges the congratulations and sycophancy which are her due
Foot- men come through the room with trays of ices
Anna is still at the window, unaware that there is only darkness outside
In the room, Betsy notes the oddity: Anna alone with her back to the room
Anna opens her eyes
She is lost for a moment, perplexed
vronsky (
) May  have the honour of bringing you an ice
Anna turns, understanding nothing
(') Ices are being served
would prefer to try a cigarette
She sits down
Vronsky takes out a cigarette case
He lights her cigarette
She tries it and coughs
73 ( ) Courage
Anna smiles
Puffs delicately once
Thank you
She gives the cigarette to him
(') 'll try another one sometime
When
She looks at him in surprise
He dunks the cigarette in an abandoned dish of ice cream
(') Where
Just as  was thinking your manners have improved since Moscow
You behaved badly, very badly
And who was responsible for that
Anna gets up and walks over to Betsy's chair
Give me a cup of tea
74 Betsy obediently gets up to fill a cup from the samovar
Vronsky follows Anna
This is watched by more than one guest
Betsy hands the cup to Anna
How nice--Alexei Aleksandrevich has arrived
Karenin enters smiling
Lisa Merkalova and Anna's Friend share a delicious-malicious moment
'm not sure my nerves can stand another Alexei at this moment
As Betsy and Karenin move smilingly to greet each other, Karenin's radar picks up the two women's intimate laughter
Karenin remains at apparent ease, as though unaware of people's glances at Vronsky and Anna, and he kisses Betsy's hand
Princess Myagkaya has meanwhile gone over to Anna
Anna likes her and is glad of the diversion
So the Schuzburgs asked us to dinner
The sauce was said to have cost a thousand rou- bles, and it was ghastly
We had to ask them back
gave them a sauce that cost eighty- five kopeks and it was a triumph
Anna and Vronsky laugh
Princess Myagkaya moves on
Were you glad to see me or not
75 This must stop
You make me feel as if were guilty of something
What do you want me to do
want you to go to Moscow and beg Kitty to forgive you
No, that's not what you want
Moscow can do better than that
Tonight  refused a posting to Tashkent
can change my mind, and you'll never see me again
If you have any thought for me, you will give me back my peace
have no peace to give
There can be no peace for us--only misery or the greatest happiness
You are my whole life now
She looks at him and nods slowly, as if in thought
Betsy diplomatically leads Karenin to Anna
Your husband is impossible
-- his opinions are all wrong but he talks so brilliantly he wins every argument
Anna looks up at her, hearing nothing
76 What
She notices Karenin, who kisses her hand
Vronsky acknowledges Karenin
called to take you home
No, 'm staying
Send the carriage back for me
Of course
He bows to Betsy
Ignoring Vronsky, he turns away
Vronsky is with one group of guests, Anna with another
She is animated, excited, at a small table, involved in a game of cards-- which she wins, to local applause
She speaks a "must go" to Betsy, and swiftly goes to the door
,  -- Dressed for outdoors, Anna comes down the staircase
The Doorkeeper sees her, opens the door and signals
,  -- The Karenin coach moves to the entrance door, which is held open by the Doorkeeper
77 ,  -- Anna hears hurried footsteps on the stairs
She hesitates
She continues towards the door
Vronsky catches up with her
The Doorkeeper holds the door open
Do you want me to go to Tashkent
,
, -- The two horses are restless in the freezing air
Konrad looks to the open door
Nobody coming
,
, -- So 'll go to Tashkent
No
don't want you to go
She turns and goes out
Vronsky follows her
,
, -- Vronsky opens the carriage door for her
She gets into the coach, he closes the door
He watches the coach go
His face
78 ,  -- Her face
,  -- Kapitonich lets Anna in
'  , -- Karenin, reading by candlelight in his dressing gown, hears the sounds of Anna's return, all the way to her entrance
He cracks his knuckles
Waiting up
How unlike you
Yes,  stayed up to talk to you
Anna keeps going, to her dressing room/boudoir
What about
It's late
Where's Annushka
He waits for her to return without her cloak
sent her off
Well, if you want to talk, but we should go to bed
79 have to warn you about something
Warn me
It's really rather late
wish to warn you that you may inadver- tently, by indiscretion and carelessness, give the world occasion to talk about you
am not a committee
Please say what you want to tell me
You and Count Vronsky attracted attention tonight
You don't like it when  don't talk to people, and you don't like it when  do
didn't notice anything, myself
But  saw that everyone else noticed
consider jeal- ousy to be insulting to you and degrading to me
have no right to inquire into your feelings
They concern only your conscience
But 'm your husband and  love you
It's my duty to remind you that we are bound together by God, and this bond can only be broken by a crime against God
80 have nothing to say to you, and 'm tired
And you have a son
She returns to the boudoir
After a moment he follows
' ,  , -- Karenin finds her in her underwear, throwing aside her dress
He apolo- gises for that
Forgive me
( ) If  am wrong,  ask your pardon
() don't know what you're talking about, and it's really too late for this
Excuse me, please
Because she wants to undress, Karenin leaves her
, ' ,  -- Anna lies in bed next to Karenin, elated
( ) Too late
81 -- In the next instant, seemingly in her own bed, she gasps and jerks as though her body has taken a blow
The  are now between a fragmented narrative of voracious sex (" ") and "prelude to sex," this being a sequence of shots starting with:-- , Anna arrives, heavily veiled, by cab
She enters the building
,  -- Vronsky opens his door to Anna
They don't speak
He takes her hand and brings her in
' ,  -- Vronsky leads Anna through the apartment to the bedroom
' ,  -- Vronsky takes off Anna's outer clothes, slowly and carefully, starting with her hat and veil
82 ' ,  -- Anna, in underclothes, unbuttons Vronsky's shirt
' ,  -- Anna and Vronsky are standing kissing passionately
He has no shirt
' ,  -- Anna ends up half off the edge of Vronsky's bed, climaxing upside down and falling to the floor
Vronsky, also half off the bed, looks down at her
He reaches down for her
She grasps hold of his hand, huddled, hugs it to her, distressed to tears
Oh God forgive me
It's the end of everything--'ve got nothing left now, only you
Remember that
Anna
Anna
how can  not remem- ber
You're my happiness
He draws her back on to the bed, kisses her face, her shoulder
83 Happiness
You murdered my happiness
She tries to leave but he attacks her as a lover, and she gives way, responding
(') Murderer
Murderer
Go on
Go on
Go on
She starts hitting him
(') Yes
Go on
Go on
Go on

86 Damn you, Kostya, you love Kitty and you can't forgive her because, first, you funked it, then you bungled it, then you ran away from an eighteen-year-old girl who was made a fool of by a uniform
It's Kitty 'm sorry for--not you
Her heart told her no
Did you come to shoot snipe or criticize me
()-- Levin and Oblonsky, with Laska, wait with their guns, a few yards apart
Levin has calmed down
For you, getting married is
a social engage- ment
Not for me
For me, it's the condition of personal happiness and living the right way
'll never again be carried away by passion renounce it
'll have to find another way
Look out--here they come
couple of snipe come drumming over the trees
The men fire simultane- ously
One snipe falls
(') Bad luck
Oblonsky laughs
Despite himself, Levin laughs too
Laska retrieves the bird
87 ,  -- Dolly has had her baby
She is holding the infant, having just finished feeding him
Kitty is with her
There
Oh, 'm sore with his feeding
Would you like to hold him
Dolly gives the baby to Kitty, who takes him almost unwillingly
Dolly buttons herself
Kitty's maternal instinct won't engage
Dolly notes it
(') Well, don't hold him like a parcel
It's Aunt Kitty, darling
Little face
little fingers
look at you
Doesn't he make you ashamed of dwelling on your troubles
have no troubles
That man wasn't worth the tears, believe me
() don't care about him
don't even think about him
Or her
Except to hate her
Then we'll never speak of it again
Dolly relieves Kitty of the baby
88 (') There are better men waiting for you
Stiva says
Kitty, my lamb, did Konstantin Levin
( ) What has Levin got to do with it
Anyway, 'll never get married
The whole business of
it's become disgusting to me
and look what it's done for you
Why do they call it love
Because it's love
Lovingly, she settles the baby in his crib, her face filled with tender joy at the bargain
-- lovers' idyll, by a stream on a warm day
Anna, lightly dressed, smoking a cigarette, watches Vronsky fill his wineglass from a tethered bottle in the stream
There is a pony trap which brought them
He comes back to sit by her
She kisses him
want you to
don't care about it
You should care
You're not supposed to
89 Pooh
Who says
Everybody
Doctors
She laughs and throws her cigarette into the stream
You're squeamish
You a soldier
Would you faint
Anyway, someone might be watching
Anna looks all around
Vast emptiness
She lifts a dock leaf to look under it
She looks up at the sky
But 'm damned anyway
'm not
'm blessed
Anna pushes him onto his back and straddles him
You love me
Yes
Only me
90 No
Apart from Frou-Frou
Yes
Anna holds his face between her hands and works her body on him
But me more than your horse
Yes
Are you happy
Yes
And you love me
Yes
How much
This much
Anna drags the front of her skirts out of her way
91 This much
Yes
This much
Yes
This much
Yes
This much
And this much
And this much
Yes
( ) And
this
much
She falls on him
He strokes her hair
Her hand comes into view, the index finger bloody
She carefully paints his lips with it
She kisses his lips clean, and rolls off him onto her back
92 (') So this is love
This
' ,  -- Korney brings Countess Lydia
Karenin comes from behind his desk to invite her to a chair
Countess
thought you would be at Peterhof now
've come from there
'm distressed that you haven't taken your usual house this year
Anna wanted a change
She is spending the summer at Tsarskoe
Near Princess Betsy
And
Karenin waits
(') The Guards are in summer camp at Tsarskoe
Karenin waits
93 (') Alexei Alexandrovich, forgive me but you are too tolerant
Your wife
Karenin affects surprise
Oh, is this about my wife
He smiles at her
(') My wife is beyond reproach
She is, after all, my wife
Countess Lydia gets the message
She rises to go
Karenin kisses her hand and accompanies her to the door
She leaves him, and his social mask gives way to his disturbance
' , -- The Commanding Officer is throwing a party for his officers: serious drink- ing, Soldier Servants, a crowded table on the large verandah, Soldier Sing- ers in white linen tunics performing operetta and folk songs
Vronsky, in party spirit, is with Petritsky and another friend, Yashvin, singing along
An officer we don't know is, surprisingly, hailed as "Vronsky
"--he's Vronsky's elder brother, Alexander
He gestures "Later
" and goes to Vron- sky
The brothers embrace
Alyosha
a message from Maman
Her friend Princess Sorokina has a house here, and a virgin daughter, that's not part of the 94 message, but they'll all be at the races and you're expected to supper afterwards
The song ends and Demin, half drunk, climbs on the table, shouts for silence and a toast
Gentlemen-- give you--the regiment
General uproar
"The regiment
" ' , -- On a garden bench where the noise of the party is quieter, Vronsky and Alexander talk
heard you turned down a promotion
That was Maman interfering
Yes
And now she's come up with a princess for you
() Alexei--we're brothers, so don't take offence
Getting married puts the pack on your back--it leaves your hands free for climbing the ladder
Getting serious about a married woman is like carrying your pack in your arms
95 So they talk about me
'm leaving, Sasha
An assignation
Come on, 'll introduce you
, -- Vronsky with Alexander beside him clucks his tongue at the black opening of a stable and calls softly for Frou-Frou
There's a stir within and the mare's head appears
Vronsky opens the door
Beautiful
man would come to no harm
Do you think you'll win tomorrow
Makhotin's Gladiator is favourite, sixteen hands--Frou-Frou looks dainty beside him, but she's got heart
Haven't you, my darling
He kisses Frou-Frou
-- Vronsky sees Anna before she sees him
He pauses to look at her, struck by her beauty, full of love for her
She is lost in thought
96 Anna
She has not been expecting him
She is concerned
Alexei, what is it
He shakes his head: nothing
She comes to him and hides her face in his breast
He holds her tight, taking her hand and kissing it
couldn't bear not to see you before the race
She hugs him, kissing his tunic
(') What were you thinking about
She continues to hide her face
He lifts her face
(') Tell me
'm pregnant
Vronsky presses her hand to his face
Ah
My love
He kisses her brow and her eyes
97 (') Well, love was never a game to us
Here's an end to living in corners, existing day to day on lies
Yes, now we can be together
How can we, Alexei
Tell Karenin everything
Do you think my husband will make you a present of me
Leave him
Leave him and be your mistress
Yes
Run away
would never see my son again
The laws are made by husbands and fathers
What, then
'll never forgive myself for your unhappiness
Anna looks into his face
98 Unhappiness
'm like a starving beggar who has been given food
She smiles rapturously
(') unhappy
No, this is my happiness
She kisses him deeply
, '  , -- It's a good maze
Anna and Serozha are running, laughing, between the hedges
It's a game
She is trying to find her way to him, chasing him hedge divides them
Serozha darts away from her, runs into a dead end, doubles back
She spots him, follows him, and now he has eluded her again
Serozha finds his way out of the maze and is confronted by Karenin
How are you, young man
Your tutor doesn't seem to be in evidence
We'll have a look at your lesson books
Anna, coming out of the maze, sees Karenin, recovers
Alexei
--you got away at last
Can you stay
Why
Serozha looks scared to tears
Anna kisses him
99 Go and find Vasily Lukich
Serozha runs into the house
(') have to change
Princess Betsy is sending her trap for me
Would you like to come
-- she's taking me to watch the race
Karenin smiles coldly
Races, surely
No, 'll come on later, and then  must get back to town
Anna returns to the house
She wipes her kissed hand on her skirt
-- This is a rough-and-ready racecourse but the venue for a high society occa- sion, with a grandstand for top people and a grander section, ornamented for greater comfort, for members of the Imperial family
It is also a fashion parade for some
The racecourse itself is an oval approached by a straight
There are nine fences, water-jumps, etc
, of various difficulty
The "jockeys" are officers in the Guards, the Hussars and other regiments
Among them is Vronsky, attended by a Trainer who is fussing over Frou- Frou's bridle and calming her
Vronsky looks with interest at a big power- ful horse which must be Gladiator, with Captain Makhotin already in the saddle
Makhotin and Vronsky greet each other with a nod
100 -- arrives at the races
making his way towards the front, smiling, raising his hat to acquaintances
his eyes busy looking for his wife
He reaches the front and looks up at the Ladies' Stand
' ,  ,  -- Anna and Betsy are here, and, not far away, so are Countess Vronsky and the Princesses Sorokina: the mother is a fading fortyish; the daughter is eighteen, blonde and pretty
Below the ladies section is a planked standing area for gentlemen, who also may stand to watch the races from the stepped aisle of the seated section
Soldiers, Horse People and Locals watch from the turf
race is flowing towards the winning post, with accompanying crowd reac- tion, but it is clear from Anna's detachment, exchanging chat with Betsy, that this is not Vronsky's race
--looks up to the ladies' stand
Betsy smiles at him in greeting, but Anna seems unaware
Countess Vronsky appraises the young princess
Exquisite creature
you really ought to be the spoil of victory today
The young princess smiles at her
Countess Vronsky turns her glasses towards the Starting Post
101 ,  , -- Vronsky mounts Frou-Frou
The Riders move to the starting line
watches Anna who is looking through her glasses towards the Starting Post while the current race finishes to cheers
,  ,  :-- Anna's anxious attention turns to a horse and rider who fell further down the course-- and to the ambulance wagon (with a red cross sewn on it)
Karenin mounts the steps of the aisle, raising his hat to ladies he knows
Anna ignores him
On the wooden boards below, where gentlemen are watching, Oblonsky calls up to Betsy
Princess
bet
What do you fancy in the next
Kusolev
'm on Vronsky
pair of gloves
102 Done
( ) Alexander Vronsky
In the aisle at the top of the stand, Karenin watches as:-- Vronsky's brother Alexander, escorting his wife, Varya, bows to Anna and Betsy, but significantly Varya succeeds in not noticing them
,  ,  -- The riders line up
and they're off
' The stands and spectators are distant, the first fence coming at him, horses on either side
His neighbour falls at the fence but Frou-Frou is clear, with Gladiator half a length in front
The next fence is coming up
Gladiator and Frou-Frou jump cleanly but a following horse falls badly
' ,  ,  -- Spectators on either side of Anna and those behind and in front collectively react
: Anna reacts not at all
Her gaze through her glasses stays unwavering on Vronsky
Karenin notes this, and from then on his attention is fixed on Anna
When the horses come opposite the stand, she lowers her glasses and follows Frou-Frou taking the lead from Gladiator
103 -- eases Frou-Frou past Gladiator
The horses take the next jump
' With one hand Anna grips her folded fan
Karenin's face is a mask as he watches Anna unconsciously half-destroying it
She raises her glasses
' Frou-Frou approaches the last fence with Gladiator half a length behind, on the near side to Anna
-- working the reins, rising and falling in rhythm with the horse, looks ahead to the winning post, and before knowing it he makes an error, losing the rhythm, dropping back into the saddle and raising the horse's head, just as Frou-Frou takes off
'  ( ) Frou-Frou rises, Gladiator rises
Frou-Frou disappears
Gladiator clears the fence in Anna's foreground
Simultaneously, there are shrieks and exclamations all around her--  -- and the view through the glasses zigzags in search of Frou-Frou, impeded by horses jumping the fence
104 She lowers the glasses and sees Frou-Frou on the ground, rolling over, and Vronsky on the ground
-- sees this, too, her mouth set tight with contempt
--looks shocked
Almost in the same moment he hears Anna's anguished cry, conspicuous in the hubbub that follows the crowd's exclamation
Alexei
'm here
This is adroit
He comes down several steps and pushes through to offer his arm, but Anna has lost control, trying to escape like a bird beating against its cage
(') Would you like to leave
Anna ignores him, puts her glasses to her eyes, searching out Vronsky
Vronsky extricates himself from his broken horse and, in terrible recrimina- tion, tries to pull Frou-Frou to her feet by the reins
Frou-Frou struggles to get up but her back is broken
Officials, officers, and a doctor have come running
105 sees an Officer hurrying to the Imperial party to report
Stiva
What are they saying
Vronsky's unhurt--but the horse
Anna relapses into sobs, attempting to hide her face behind her destroyed fan
Betsy gives Anna her fan
--is restrained by an Officer
Her back's broken
The Officer takes a pistol from his holster
Vronsky, enraged and in grief, takes the pistol from him
--persists with Anna
'm asking you
if you wish to go
He touches Anna's arm
She jerks it away
106 No, leave me alone
'll bring her home, Alexei
( ) Excuse me, Princess, but Anna is not well and  want her to come with me
gunshot is heard from the course
Anna turns her tear-streaked face towards it
-- Anna's hysteria has solidified into a blank despair
Karenin seems to want to pretend that nothing important has happened
You know
they say the Emperor dis- approves of the races
the danger of injury
but
Anna looks at him contemptuously
What
'm saying there is a value in manly sport, for the military-- 107 don't understand
In my opinion, it's not the sport itself that's wrong, it's the spectacle, it's making a cruel spectacle out of-- What are you talking about
Karenin changes tack
have to tell you-- Yes
have to tell you, you behaved improperly today
And how was that
She has raised her voice
He raises a warning finger, and reaches to close the communication window behind the coachman's box
By making plain your feelings when one of the riders fell
Your conduct was improper
It must not occur again
have said it before
Anna smiles faintly
He is misled by that
108 (') You are going to say my concern is unneces- sary and ridiculous
You are my wife
am wrong to think that
yes--perhaps  was mistaken
Anna looks at him despairingly
No, you were not mistaken
love him am his mistress
can't bear you, 'm afraid of you,  hate you
Do what you like to me
Karenin is literally winded--gasping for breath, slowly getting his breath- ing under control
Anna huddles away from him in her corner
Karenin recovers himself only to the point of sitting stock-still, looking at nothing, not moving
The coach lurches, unbalancing him so that he is pushed against Anna
He recoils as if from a contamination
The coach slows
The coach stops
Servant comes to the coach door, opens the door
Wait, please
Move away
The Servant backs off
(') will not have a scandal
Therefore
You will not see
this man again
You will behave in such a way that nothing is known against you, by society or by the servants
In return, you will keep the privileges of a 109 wife--and the duties
Tomorrow you will return home
That is all
Anna gets out of the coach and runs into the maze
-- Anna comes to Vronsky
She is still shaken by the showdown with Karenin in his coach, but is now overtaken by concern for Vronsky after his fall
Are you hurt
Vronsky shakes his head
He is moved by the sight of her, full of love and desire, but in her embrace he detects something new, a nervous exaltation
What's happened
told him 'm your mistress
Vronsky lifts her face, strokes her cheek
He waits
(') He thinks  can give you up and go on living
He embraces her for that, relieved, grateful, loving--understanding that she is not going to give him up
110 No, you cannot
(
)-- Imperial hands (the Tsar's for all we know) place over Karenin's head a broad red ribbon from which hangs a heavy medal
Karenin bows low
,
-- At an ornate doorway a Major-Domo announces
Their Excellencies Minister Karenin and Madame Karenin
Karenin, wearing his medal, and Anna smile their way into a party, to a patter of polite applause
Further grandees are being announced, but are not applauded
Prince and Princess Berghatskoy
Ambassador Chamber- lain
Baron and Baroness Verdlov
Prince and Princess Tverskoy
Alexei Aleksandrevich
congratulations
You're the only man my husband would do this for
(To Prince Tverskoy) Tell me your latest find for your library
Not in front of the Princess
111 Betsy draws Anna away for a moment
can tell you're happy
You've put on a little weight
Both true
' , ' -- Anna, in the same dress, kisses Serozha tenderly so as not to wake him, and leaves the room
,  , -- Anna enters the suite where Karenin, in his dressing gown, puts down his book
He is elated by his evening
Time for bed
,  ,
-- Anna is in bed
Karenin is getting ready for bed
Anna listens apprehen- sively to the little noises of Karenin's pre-coital preparations
112 not that  care for decorations but
Alexei
can't
'm sorry
But 'm his wife now
(she turns to him) am having his child
Karenin stares at her
He turns back to the open drawer and puts things back the way they were
He locks the drawer
He puts on his dressing gown and leaves the room
Anna waits a moment and follows him
,  ,  -- It's dark
Anna hears the crack of his knuckles and can see him faintly, sitting in the dark
Tell me what  did to deserve this
()-- prospect: next to a country road, a large expanse of meadow is being mown forty swathes at a time by forty mowers swinging their scythes almost in unison
--Levin is suffering but keeping up, bathed in perspiration
His place is behind an old man, Theodore, who is scything as if without effort
Just in time for Levin, Theodore calls a halt and takes Levin's scythe to sharpen it with a whetstone
Levin attracts a few grins and comments
113 Konstantin Dmitrich, you'll know your rows when the field's all done
Levin's row has stalks of differing heights between the even swathes on either side
There is some laughter, but the men are uneasy
()-- It's time to stop for the day
More tomorrow
The Mowers with their scythes walk back across the large meadow of cut swathes
From the other direc- tion, a crowd of Village Women are coming to meet them carrying food and drink
()-- fire has been lit
The Mowers eat their meal in the company of women
Serafina tends to a cooking pot in the firelight
Levin watches her discreetly
He has settled down at a discreet distance from the men
His attention is caught by a grown-up Boy and his young Wife who have chosen to sit slightly apart
He is charmed by them, watching the girl serve her husband
Theodore comes to Levin with a jug
Levin takes a swig
How many mowers is it, Theodore
Forty-two, master
In your father's time it was work for two days for thirty men
() though he never picked up a scythe himself
114 The men don't like me for it
They like what they're used to
It settles me
How is that, master
When 'm mowing,  don't ask myself why 'm here
You're here to be master, Konstantin Dmi- trich, to be your father's son, and father to a son who will be master after you, as it has always been by the grace of God
My father owned you, Theodore
My grand- father owned your father
Owned you like chattels, to be bought and sold
Was that by the grace of God
It was
Those were good times when your father had the keeping of us
That's my youngest you were looking at there
His young life is perilous now since the Free- dom came and work must be found
115 It's true  was looking at him
() At his wife too,  dare say
Levin is abashed, found out
They look happier than 've ever been
Is it living simply that 'm looking for
()-- Night under the stars
Some of the men have gone, some have settled in for the night
The cooking fire is burning out
Levin remains where he was, watching, thinking: drawn to "the simple life
" ()-- Levin wakes
woken by hoofbeats and the jingle of harness
Levin sees a coach coming towards him
The coach comes nearer, leather boxes strapped to the roof
Levin sees that a young woman is looking out of the side window, holding on to the white ribbons of her bonnet
He sees that it is Kitty, on her way to Ergoshovo
(Princess Shcherbatsky is also inside, dozing
) The coach passes on, leaving Levin lovelorn, the dawn light on him
The sight of Kitty has turned him round again
116 ,  -- Vronsky stands at the entrance to the platform holding a bouquet, waiting for a train
He looks pretty fed up
" ,"
-- As before, the set-up is a small stage, a small auditorium, and an area for drinking, cruising, etc
, a combination of music hall and a bar with a few tables
Vronsky is here as the escort of a Foreign Prince (an Indian), watch- ing a "risque" show with Can-Can Girls, much relished by the visitor
Vronsky's glance casts about in the gloom
The champagne is flowing
Vron- sky spots a trio--Lisa Merkalova, Betsy, and Stremov, a politician and Karenin's rival
Vronsky catches Betsy's eye
She beckons him
He excuses himself to the Foreign Prince, who doesn't notice, and goes over to the other table
Under the music, he is introduced to Stremov, and kisses the hands of the women
He takes the empty chair
He's some kind of prince at home
Exhaust- ing
Where is Tuskevitch this evening
Why ask me
At which moment, Makhotin appears at the table
Vronsky relinquishes his chair
117 Captain Makhotin
Vronsky bows to the women
(') must leave you
'm on duty tonight
Lucky woman
Give her my respects, and to Karenin if you see him
Vronsky freezes in anger
Don't
Would you compromise me
And Lisa
Lisa and Stremov are enjoying it
Vronsky turns away
The Foreign Prince is applauding enthusiastically when Vronsky rejoins him
() only say that a man who can't govern his wife has perhaps gone as far as he can go in government
, ' ,
-- Vronsky wakes
He has fallen asleep in his clothes
note has been deliv- ered, propped up by the bed
He reaches for it
118 ,
-- cab brings Vronsky
The Karenin coach is waiting outside
As Vronsky approaches the door, it opens and Kapitonich comes out with a folded rug
Kapitonich is wrong-footed by seeing him
Karenin comes out of the door, into the gaslight
When he sees Vronsky he hesitates for a fraction but con- tinues
Kapitonich is holding open the door of the coach
Vronsky bows, Karenin, expressionless, touches his hat and gets into the coach, taking the rug
Vronsky walks into the house as the coach moves off
,  , -- Kapitonich comes in, closing the door
Vronsky gives him his hat and coat
Good evening, Your Excellency
Kapitonich is uneasy
Footman comes from a service door
He sees Vron- sky and looks to Kapitonich
am expected
Kapitonich nods to the Footman
,  , -- Anna, six months pregnant, is seated almost formally
The Footman lets Vronsky in and retires closing the door
Anna runs to Vronsky
119 No
--no
will not live like this
He holds her, calming her, hushing her
He leads her into a Winter Garden conservatory off the Reception Room
(') Waiting hour after hour while you're drink- ing champagne with naked actresses-- don't think  don't know
--Lisa Merkalova still calls on me
It's punishment enough that 'm on escort duty, without
Yes--'m sorry--it's my demon,  can't help it
You wrote that you were ill
Did
Well,  am
() But don't worry
It won't be for long, 'll soon be out of your way--soon
Stop
No, it's true
was told it in a dream
120 There, it was only a bad dream
Yes, and 'm only going to die having your baby
That's all nonsense
She kisses him all over his face
Tell me it is, tell me it is
You love me
Only me
Your note said your husband would be out
He was late
Serves him right
And you
Why do you call him my husband
He isn't my husband--he's a clock, a wooden doll-- But it was awkward
a matter of your honour
You made an agreement
Anna flares up again
Do you think of my honour when you're sharing whores with your Hindoo
Your demon again
121 'll be glad to die, before you start to hate me
Anna
Anna gives a gasp
She laughs
Put your hand there
There
Did you feel him move
,
-- "The Committee" is in session
Stremov has the floor
He is referring to a map of Russia on an easel, splotched with colours
Karenin is there but not listening, his thoughts far away
must respectfully ask Minister Karenin whether his proposals for the regulation of these colourful Gypsy tribes, of these schol- arly God-fearing Jews, and of--but 'm afraid  have lost the Minister's attention
All turn to look at Karenin, who sits staring at nothing, unaware even of the pause
He wakes
For a beat he hardly knows where he is
,  -- Kapitonich lets Karenin in
Karenin is brisk
122 Who is here
Only Madame, Your Excellency
Karenin goes up the staircase
There is an urgency in him, a fury
' ,  , -- Karenin walks in and goes to her bureau, empties out little drawers and receptacles, looking for the key to the main drawer
Anna comes in from the bedroom, alarmed, in her nightdress
wanted to see him because
do not wish to be told why a woman wants to see her lover
He pulls furiously at the locked drawer, then looks around for an implement
What are you
want his letters
Karenin finds an iron bootjack
Anna tries to stop him
He pushes her aside and smashes the wood around the lock, then, struggling against her, he takes from the open drawer a pretty cardboard box, a good guess
He confirms that it contains letters
123 (') am going to Moscow tomorrow, and then to the provinces with a commission to investigate conditions among the Jews and Gypsies--whose conditions  infinitely prefer to my own
will not return to this house until divorce has put you into the street
Meanwhile my son will be sent to live with my eldest sister
() Alexei
please
leave me Serozha
Karenin looks at her with contempt
Do you think  would let you have my son
You are depraved, a woman without honour thank God the curse of love is lifted from me
He walks out with the box of letters
, -- Oblonsky arrives outside his office building in a cab
He enters
, -- Saluted by the Hall Porter, Oblonsky mounts a semi-grand staircase and arrives at the entrance to his department
He goes in
124 , ' , -- Levin stands up in his almost new, hardly used coat, top hat and boots
Levin
What
Levin smiles, hopefully, sheepish
need your advice
It's a reprise
Oblonsky understands
He seizes Levin and kisses him
,  -- small group
Dolly is playing the piano
Kitty turns the pages for Dolly
The old Prince Shcherbatsky and the Princess are with Countess Nordston and Oblonsky
Well, is he coming
Kitty, keeping half an eye on the door, sees Levin enter and misses the page- turn
Oblonsky goes to greet Levin
Am  late
Who is here
Of course you're late
Come and meet
Countess Nordston
125 (drily, amused) We nearly met at the Shcherbatsky's last winter
Levin, puzzled, bows to her and to the Prince and Princess, who are respec- tively pleased and making the best of it, and then to Dolly who approaches
Come into the fold
Kitty is here
Levin is shaken
Dolly leads him to Kitty, who is frightened, shy and shamefaced
Dolly leaves them
Konsantin
what a long time since we saw each other
Since you saw me, but  saw you not so long ago
When
You were driving to Ergoshovo
was at Kashin for the haymaking
Oh, but why didn't you
They are both embarrassed by the wrong step
126 'm so glad to see you
You're just the same
hope not-- was young and silly in those days
Months and months ago
And you haven't changed
No
haven't
Kitty looks up at him, decoding
They gauge each other shyly
Permit me to announce--soup Marie Lou- ise, carp with asparagus, and roast beef went to the market in person
But Matvey at that moment presents Oblonsky with a visiting card on a salver
Oblonsky reads it
(') ( ) An extra place
,  , -- The new arrival is Karenin
Oblonsky is pleased
127 Karenin
--'m glad you came
've been on tour in the regions, a govern- ment commission
'm sorry-- have come to tell you our connection must be severed
'm going to divorce your sister
Divorce
Dear me, what are you talking about
Don't be in a hurry
Stay to dinner and later talk it over with Dolly-- Prince Oblonsky, everything is over between our families
() Alexei
divorce is one thing but dinner is quite another
,  -- Dinner for eight-- clockwise, Oblonsky, Countess Nordston, Prince Shcher- batsky, Kitty, Karenin, Dolly, Levin and Princess Shcherbatsky
Two Servants and Matvey serve at the table, clearing away the "carp with asparagus
" The Princess is challenging Karenin
You Petersburgers think yourselves so de bon ton compared with dull, old-fashioned 128 Moscow, but we know how to do things-- only the other day,  hear, Vasya Pryachnikov fought a duel with Kvitsky and killed him
Oblonskky attempts to divert the conversation
Well, what's this government commission, Karenin
But Karenin ignores him
Oblonsky looks on helplessly
What was the challenge about
Pryachnikov's wife, naturally
It was a matter of honour, defending a woman's honour
Karenin remains cool
It sounds like barbarism to me
And what if the lover had killed the husband
-- would that have preserved the wife's honour too
Still, not many of us can say that our lover died for love
129 Love
Thou shall not covet thy neighbour's wife
Would you die for love, Konstantin Dmitrich
would
But not for my neighbour's wife
Levin is nettled to find that he seems to have made a joke, for the Countess especially
Kitty remains serious, watching Levin, loving him
(') An impure love is not love, to me
To admire another man's wife is a pleasant thing, but sensual desire indulged for its own sake is greed, a kind of gluttony, and a misuse of something sacred which is given to us so that we may choose the one person with whom to fulfill our humanness
Otherwise we might as well be cattle
Ah, an idealist
Reconciliatory laughter eases the atmosphere
Levin feels abashed at coming out of his shell
He steals a glance at Kitty and finds her looking at him
She smiles at him and drops her eyes
,  -- The dinner party settles in
Dolly and Karenin sit knee-to-knee in a corner
130 but she will be nobody's wife, she'll be ruined
tried to save her
She chose ruin
Alexei Aleksandrevich--look at me
You will have no peace of mind until you forgive her
It was Anna who taught me that
do not wish to forgive
am not a cruel man
have never hated anyone
But  hate her with all my soul for all the wrong she has done me
Levin and Kitty are at the card table, with a spillage of the alphabet pieces
It's your turn to play us something, Countess
Since we last met, there is something  have often wanted to ask you
What is that
Levin sorts through the alphabet pieces as though he is putting off the moment, but he quickly puts four letters spaced out in a row:
131 This
Kitty tries
Do Not
Levin adds an  next to the
(') Did
Did Not
Levin shakes his head
He adds an  next to the second
Kitty concentrates
(') The last word is Never
Levin nods
Kitty puts letters in place
They read Levin looks into her eyes
Kitty finds letters and presents Levin with
Levin adds to the
Kitty nods
Levin adds  to the
Kitty nods
Levin adds an  to the
Kitty shakes her head
She puts an  after the
know what it says
Dolly, looking across the room, sees Kitty and Levin serious and smiling, rapt
Levin places extra letters:
Kitty nods
132 (') Then
But now
Kitty finds
(') Can You
Kitty nods
(') Can you Forgive
And Forget
Levin puts down
(') never stopped
He looks up to see silent tears streaming down her face
His own eyes flood
, -- Karenin walks away from the Oblonsky house
He lifts his face to meet the snowflakes
He looks tortured
Snow melts on his face like tears
He takes from his wallet a telegram
: Die, then
He stands in the snow, uncertain
133 (
)-- Karenin sits like a statue
,  -- Karenin is let into the house by Kapitonich
How is your mistress
Safely delivered of a daughter, Your Excellency
So
she is well
The mistress is very poorly
The doctor
Karenin, going to the stairs, sees Vronsky's cloak and cap on the coat stand
,  , -- Karenin comes up the staircase
When he reaches his dressing room he hears Anna shouting for "Alexei" in her delirium
He hesitates
Anna shouts the name again
Karenin enters Anna's boudoir
134 ' ,  , -- Karenin sees Vronsky sitting with his hands over his face
Vronsky jumps up in confusion
She's dying
Please let me stay
Karenin looks at him coldly and enters the bedroom
,  -- Anna is not seeing or hearing, struggling against the Doctor and the Mid- wife, while Annushka holds her hand
Thank God
She talks only of you
In her delirium, Anna keeps up a bright prattle
Why doesn't he come
He is kind
He will forgive me
He's here--look--look--can't you see him
want Alexei
Why doesn't he come
Give me some water
No,  mustn't, it's not good for my little girl
Or let her have a nurse
Yes--don't bring her here, because Alexei is coming and it will hurt him to see her
135 He's come, my dear--look there
Annushka gives way to Karenin, who kneels by the bed, taking Anna's hand
( ) More ice
Annushka hurries out
Oh, what nonsense
must be asleep, that's what it is
You think he won't forgive me but you don't know him
No one knows him except me
'm not afraid of him now
Karenin gazes at her
He looks at her as he's never looked at her
(') 'm afraid of death, though
Karenin tries to speak but cannot
He starts making shushing noises as to a baby
She quietens down
She seems to recognise him
(') Oh, my dear
Don't look at me like that
am not the one you think
'm afraid of her
She fell in love with another man
'm the real one
But 'm dying now, then she'll be dead, too
Poor man
Let him come in
Alexis
Alexis
136 ,  ,  -- Vronsky hears her calling
He comes into the bedroom
,  ,  -- Vronsky covers his face, unmanned
The Doctor nods to the Midwife-- "Leave them alone
" They leave
Take your hands away from your face
Look at my husband
He's a saint
Take his hand
Alexei--take his hands away
Karenin pulls Vronsky's fingers, and holds on to Vronsky's hand
(') Forgive him, too
Thank God, thank God
Anna is asleep
Karenin is alone with her
The crisis seems to be over
She opens her eyes
(') So you came
Karenin puts his face down to her shoulder
She strokes him
(') If  had died as  wanted, you would be free of your troubles at last
137 am free of them
Anna closes her eyes and sleeps again
,  ,  -- Karenin comes in
Vronsky is there
He looks up abjectly
Whatever you think of me, please believe me,  love her-- could not have done other- wise than what
what  did
Karenin nods and sits next to him
But you must leave now
promise to send for you if she asks for you
don't know what happened
forgive you
forgive Anna
My soul is filled with joy
will remain with her and look after her for ever
Karenin stands up and offers his hand
Vronsky grasps it and starts shaking
(') Come now, come now
Karenin embraces him, comforting him
138 , Vronsky arrives back at his flat
and finds his mother waiting for him in his sitting room
Look at you
You look like what you are laughingstock
fancy you are to be asked to leave the regiment
would like you to go, Maman
will go when 'm ready to go
little affair with a married woman puts a finish- ing touch to a young man's education--but this morbid, selfish obsession
You have publicly humiliated a man who has devoted his life to Russia, and it will not be forgot- ten
You'd better come back to Moscow with me
You're finished here
In Petersburg
(he taps his breastbone) 'm finished here
,  -- For the first time, Vronsky is wearing civilian clothes
looking reflect- ingly at his uniform hanging in his wardrobe
He places his cavalry cap carefully on a shelf and closes the wardrobe
139 ,  , -- Levin is half-dressed in clothes to be married in, assisted by Matvey and watched over by Oblonsky, who is in wedding clothes
Levin is frantic
Oblonsky is perplexed
Matvey is unflappable, holding Levin's coat ready and following him around
no, 'll go to her and tell her it's not too late to stop this business
Better now than when we're married and she realises she doesn't love me
But she does love you
How can she
mean, look at me
Suppose she's only marrying me to get married
Suppose she's still in love with Vronsky
She's making a terrible mistake
'll go to her and tell her she's free, that's what must do
Your coat, sir
Levin snatches the coat and puts it on, and dashes out of the room
140 ,  -- Levin, in disarray, is let into the house
The entrance hall is crowded, loud and chaotic with children, maids, governesses and Kitty's mother
Tanya, Masha and Lili are bridesmaids
Grisha is a page
Princess Shcherbatsky, trying to create order among last-minute bouquet distribution, hair- adjustments, shoe-changing, etc
, sees Levin and explodes
Konstantin
--what--
have to talk to Kitty
You're not allowed to see her
Levin gallops up the stairs
' ,  -- Kitty, dressed for the church, is whispering into the crack of the bedroom door
No
don't understand at all
What's the matter with you
' ,  -- You can't love me
Think it over
Let people say what they like
141 ( ) Are you mad
Have you changed your mind
Yes
If you don't love me
But  do love you
Levin hesitates, desperate
Do you
Well,  love you
Oh, Konstantin
They link hands through the opening, each with a hand to kiss
-- -- mere fragment of a long and ornate marriage ceremony
The grizzled Priest lights two decorated candles, holding them askew in his left hand, and he uses his right hand to touch Levin and, more tenderly, Kitty
He gives the couple the candles, Kitty taking hers in her gloved hand
Levin looks blissfully at Kitty
142 The Priest lifts crowns from their heads, and invites them to kiss each other, relieving them of their candles
The Choir bursts with pride
,  -- The baby girl, two months old, is being fed by a Wet Nurse
Replete, the baby is given over to the Nursemaid who lays the child in her crib
Karenin watches all this
The women ignore him: they are used to him now, and Karenin is harmless
Karenin stares fascinated at the baby, who stares back
,  ,
-- Anna stares at herself in the mirror
The act of raising a pair of scissors is an effort
She isolates a thick lock of her hair, and snips it off
,  -- Anna's hair is short all over
She sits up in bed, listening to Princess Betsy, who has brought the current gossip
and there was her husband wearing her best ballgown, rouge all over his face
ma chere, le scandale
But 'd better tell you some regimental news
143 ,  -- Karenin enters and sees a glamorous Footman standing in the entrance hall, holding a white fur cape
Who is here
Princess Elisabeth Federovna Tverskaya, Your Excellency
,  -- Karenin approaches the bedroom door
anna (
) No-- don't want to see him
betsy (
) but your husband surely wouldn't
,  ,  -- Anna sees Karenin who is about to retreat
Please excuse me
No--stay
144 am so glad to see you
Everyone asks after you
Karenin bows to her and kisses Anna's hand
You look feverish
We have been talking too much--so 'm going
Princess Betsy came to tell me
don't want to hide anything from you
Count Vronsky asked to come to say goodbye--he's going away
have said can't receive him
Betsy kisses Anna
Goodbye, my treasure
Karenin follows Betsy out
Anna gives in to a moment of grief, and recovers herself when she hears the crack of Karenin's knuckles
He comes in
agree with you
As he is going away, there is no need for Count Vronsky to come here
145 have just said so, so there's no need to repeat it
But it is for you to decide
Yes, and  decided
Then  am very glad that-- That we agree, so perhaps we can stop talk- ing about it
Of course
Is there anything  can do for you
Yes, can you please please please stop crack- ing your knuckles
() 'm a bad woman
But  can't breathe
Your kindness which  can't repay, and your -- You begged me for my forgiveness
But  didn't die and now  have to live with it
If only you would have gone on hating me
146 But then--what
What
What do you want
Do you know what you want
Do you want to see Count Vronsky
() Not to say goodbye
can't hear
Not to say goodbye
() You would be lost
Irretrievably lost
You would have no position
And worse if we divorce
You would be the guilty party
That means you cannot legally remarry
Your union with Count Vronsky would be illegitimate, and so would your daughter who now has the protection of my name
And that is what you want
It would be a sin to help you destroy yourself
You forget something
Count Vronsky and love each other
And this love sanctifies a criminal folly
147 ( ) All  know is that  sent him away and it's as if 'd shot myself through the heart
() see
And Serozha
It's the crux for Anna, and she is prepared for it
would die for him, but  won't live like this for him
When he knows about love, he'll forgive me
Karenin can see where this takes him
Then  must choose the smaller sin
Vronsky robbed me of my cloak and  will give him my coat
will give you grounds to divorce me, and 'll accept the scandal, the humilia- tion and the consequences to my career
No
can't
You may write to him but  would prefer you not to see him until you have left this house
148 ,
-- Two coaches, each with considerable luggage, have a rendezvous, one coach on the bridge
,  -- Anna is holding Baby Anya
Annushka and the Nurse are with her
,  -- Vronsky, in civilian clothes, is alone, looking anxiously out of the window
,  -- Anna gives the baby to the Nurse, as the coach halts
,  -- Anna gets out of her coach and runs the few yards to Vronsky's coach
He opens the door for her
,  -- Anna is kissing Vronsky's face and being kissed, weeping, smiling
You look like a boy
But so pale
We'll go south
to the sea air and sunshine
149 (" ")-- Early morning
In a big untidy bed, Vronsky and Anna lie asleep, naked and satiated
The style of the room, and the warmth of the light, tell of the journey made, confirmed by the view from the window, an attractive panorama from an elevation above the sea
In the room, there are open, unpacked or partly unpacked trunks and cases, and, abandoned untidily, Anna's and Vronsky's clothes
' ,  -- Slyudin is in attendance on Karenin at his desk
and Madame Odette in person, so to speak, Your Excellency, with your permission
respectful cough at the door reveals an obsequious male Shopkeeper
Kar- enin is bewildered
Madame Odette
Excuse the liberty, Your Excellency
it's for a bonnet and some ribbons Her Excel- lency has overlooked
If you wish us to address ourselves to Her Excellency, please be so good as to tell us where we might
Karenin is stricken into immobility, his face hiding in one propped-up hand
tear falls on the blotter
Slyudin rescues him, ushering the Shopkeeper out
150 Countess Lydia arrives in full fluttering cry
have forced my way in
have heard
Countess, every shopkeeper has heard
My dear friend
Don't give way to sorrow
Our Lord Jesus Christ has you in his care
No, 'm done for
don't understand any- thing
All day long 'm being asked to make decisions about bills and servants, the kitchen, Serozha's clothes
understand
understand everything
am going to act
The household arrangements you can leave to me
will come every day will be a second mother to Serozha
He clasps both her hands and kisses them
Lydia falls to her knees
(') He that humbleth himself shall be exalted
You must not thank me
Thank Him whose love pours through me
151 , , -- The sleigh brings Levin and Kitty home through deep snow all around
The house comes into view
They have been on honeymoon travels, attested by hotel labels on the lug- gage
Kitty, eager and anxious, looks at the approaching house
Not too bad
Levin takes her hand
She smiles at him, to calm him
, ,  -- Agafia and Vasili come out on the porch
The house has been painted, the window frames smartened up, and paper flowers are tied to the posts of the porch
The sleigh pulls up
Levin carries Kitty through the snow to the porch
Agafia bobs
Vasili bows
This is Agafia, and Vasili, the steward
My wife, Ekaterina Alexandrovna Levin
am very pleased to meet you both
Kuzma sidles by with a bow and goes to take the luggage from the sleigh
And that was Kuzma
Come inside
152 Careful--door's still a bit
(to Levin's look) it's all right, it'll be dry tomorrow
, ,  -- Levin shows Kitty in
He is immensely relieved
It never looked better
At the same time he realises that Agafia is agitated: a word in private
Is it all right
Kitty nods, smiles gamely--it's not like home
(') Sit down a minute
No-- want to see everything
Agafia panics
moment
Levin follows Agafia out
, ,  -- Agafia follows Levin up the stairs
She is outraged
153 and now 'm doing kitchen maid's work because Nadya's parents won't let her set foot in this house, and who can blame them
--it's indecent
, ,  -- Levin enters the small bedroom
Agafia waits outside
Nikolai is in the bed-- wasted, near death
He lies in squalor
Masha is wiping his face
She stands up at Levin's approach
Levin bends over Niko- lai, presses his gaunt hand
Nikolai opens his eyes
It's me, Konstantin
Yes, good
The doctor here is useless--get me a doctor from Moscow
Where did you go
asked for you every- where, when  was getting married
Nikolai sighs and closes his eyes
Levin retreats, looks to Masha
() 'm sorry
couldn't leave him
know 've done wrong
154 Yes
My wife
You can't stay now
Levin goes outside to Agafia and closes the door
, , -- couldn't go against Nikolai Dmitrich's orders
Yes--yes
She's going
An unwelcome thought strikes Levin
(') Did the doctor see her
Agafia nods guiltily
, -- Kitty has remained
Levin, in miserable agony, is sitting holding her hand
will nurse him with Agafia
The woman will find somewhere in the village
You won't see her
She knows it's impossible for you to meet her
It is a torment to me that  have brought you under the same roof 155 as this unfortunate
this fallen
and in your precious, in your delicate condition
Kitty detaches herself abruptly and leaves the room
He hears her going upstairs
After a moment, he follows
, , -- Kitty comes out of the Guest Bedroom
Good
clean nightshirt and sheets towel and a clean pail of warm water
Ask Agafia for vinegar, and to prepare a bed somewhere for Masha
Wait
Kitty goes back into the room and returns at once with a chamber-pot which she thrusts at Levin
(') And bring the perfume bottle in the outside pocket of my handbag
She goes back into the room and doesn't return
Levin, humbled, goes down the stairs
, -- Nikolai has been stripped
Masha washes his body
Kitty enters with her arms full of clean linen
156 Nikolai lies naked in clean sheets
Masha hauls him up into a sitting posi- tion
Kitty puts a nightshirt over his head
Nikolai protests feebly
'm not looking
Masha and Kitty pull the nightshirt over his body
Kitty pulls the sheet up over him
Masha adjusts the fresh pillow
She combs his hair (and beard)
-- Nikolai lies quietly in a neat bed in the neat room, with medicine and water jug, etc
, tidily by the bed
Masha keeps vigil by candlelight, holding his hand, singing to him quietly
() 'm going
' , ,  -- Levin comes into the room he shared with his brother
The room has been abandoned for years
two bare beds, a washstand, a wooden chest
It contains a jumble of books, shoes, a pair of skates
Levin hears sleigh bells arriving
, ,  -- The sleigh draws up, bringing a Priest
157 , -- Levin, feeling out of place, is at the washstand
He notices there is a prettily wrapped new cake of soap
He picks it up and puts it to his nose
Masha and Kitty are kneeling by the bed
The Priest bends over Nikolai holding up an icon in front of Nikolai's face and murmuring the prayers
Levin, embarrassed, puts down the soap and comes forward and kneels too
Nikolai is at the point of death
Levin stares, torn between the mystery and the lack of mystery, the ordinariness of the body finally wearing out
The death rattle comes
Masha kisses the dead hand
The Priest continues to murmur
Kitty takes hold of Masha's hand
Levin stares into Nikolai's face: if this is death, what is life
Nikolai lies dead, candles burning at his head and feet
, -- Levin counts money, for the services of the Priest
who is eating bread and soup
Thank you, Father
and how much
He offers a handful of paper money
158 At your benevolence
It is a custom, not a levy, Your Excellency
Jesus overturned the money-tables outside the temple, but
He shrugs and puts the money away, and returns to his soup
, -- The snow is almost gone
Nikolai's grave has flowers strewn on the mound
, -- Pava's yearling and several more calves, delirious with release, mill through the yard with the herd, to pasture, with a Herdsman and Laska urging them on
Masha is leaving, alone behind the Coachman
She sits quietly and doesn't look back
Levin and Kitty watch her drive away
You're such an expert on love, Kostya
why didn't you know it when you saw it
,  -- Lydia hurries along grand deserted hallways
She knows her way
door ahead of her opens and a dozen Politicians and Civil Servants carrying portfolios cross her path, with Stremov at the centre of their unheard conver- sation
Stremov is smiling, triumphant
Lydia expects to see Karenin among them
She hurries on to the door they came from
159 ,  -- When Lydia enters, Karenin, alone in the chamber, is sitting immobile, defeated
He starts gathering his papers
Lydia comes to him
Her agitation explained, she takes an opened letter from her bag
Alexei, they're back
Here in St
Petersburg
She has written to me
Karenin accepts the letter and reads it
To you
think  don't have the right to refuse
It's the boy's birthday
My friend
you would be blowing on the embers of a fire which must be allowed to die
Let me write to her
,
-- Anna is looking into the display window of a toy shop
She is excited, glow- ing
She enters the shop
' ,
-- Returning from the toy shop with a wrapped parcel, Anna comes in
Luggage is stacked up in the hallway and Franz is unpacking stuff in the main room
She sees that a hand-delivered letter is waiting for her
She opens it
Anna reads the letter
For a moment she is devastated by it--but then, furious, she tears it up
160 ,
-- It's very early morning
The street is not awake
hired cab brings Anna to her former home
She is heavily veiled, and carries the wrapped parcel from the toy shop
The cab is to wait for her
She rings the doorbell
sleepy Servant opens the big wooden door
'm here to see Sergei Alexeyich
The young Servant doesn't know her
Anna steps past him, pushing money into his hand
,  , -- Kapitonich, pulling on his livery greatcoat, comes to the inner glass door and lets Anna in
He does not recognise her
have brought something for Sergei Alexeyich
Kapitonich scrutinises her, prepared to forestall her
He is not up yet
Would you wish to wait
Who shall  say
Kapitonich peers at her and realises who she is
He steps back and bows
(') Please come in, Your Excellency
161 Anna goes quickly to the stairs
(') Allow me to announce you
The tutor may be there and not dressed
Anna shakes her head and is almost running away from him
Kapitonich gives chase
, ' ,  -- Please allow me
,  ,  -- Anna dashes past two Housemaids who gape at her, and disappears round the corner
She's a little mad now
,  ,  -- Anna, wild-eyed, climbs the stairs and meets the tutor, Vasily Lukich, coming down, buttoning his waistcoat
Lukich is startled, not knowing her
've come to see Sergei Alexeyich
Kapitonich reaches these stairs, calling, "Your Excellency
" 162 ,  ,  -- Anna dashes for Serozha's door and flings herself through it
"' ,"  , -- It's no longer Serozha's room
large Woman sits up in bed
She's probably the Cook
She cries out
Anna reels back
She looks panicked
Kapitonich catches up, out of breath
He's been moved to the small sitting room
,  ,  -- At the bottom of the Upper Stairs, Lukich, the Housemaids and a couple of half-dressed Footmen have their heads together
They move aside as Anna hurries by, seeing nothing
,  ,  -- Kapitonich catches up with Anna at the door of the "small sitting room
" 'll just look in
Anna shakes her head and walks past him, into the room
163 ,  ,  -- The curtains are drawn closed
The room is dim
Anna sees Serozha sitting up, yawning, his eyes closed, and falling back on the pillow
She comes to the bed and whispers his name
Serozha raises himself on his elbow, opens his eyes and smiles dreamily and falls forward into her arms
Mama
Oh, my dear little boy
knew you would come
Today is my birthday
Serozha rubs his face on her neck, falls back on the pillow, only half awake and going back to sleep
Anna looks at him avidly, touching his forearms, his shoulders, the hair over his ears
She can't stop her own tears
He comes awake
(') Are you crying
won't cry
It's time for you to get dressed
And  almost forgot your present, look
open it
Serozha takes off her hat
You don't want that
Let me see
164 Serozha tears open the package, lifts the lid of the cardboard box and finds a puppet, a beautifully dressed marionette
(') Oh, he's grand
,  ,  -- Korney, the Valet, among others, has joined the "conference" and is blaming Kapitonich
It's your fault for letting her in
--you should be sacked
Oh yes, you would have sent her packing
Ten years 've been keeping the door and the mistress was always kind to me
You should stick to stealing the master's clothes
've had enough of this--it's my job to get the boy out of bed before His Excellency comes
' ,  , -- Lukich cautiously opens the door
He sees mother and son working the pup- pet and laughing quietly
Lukich backs off
Anna looks round to see the door closing
165 Darling Kutik, Maman can't stay
Serozha clings to Anna
Don't go
--he's not coming yet
Yes,  must, and you must love Papa-- he's better than  am
When you're grown-up
No one in the whole world is better than you
Anna hugs him
' ,  , -- The Servants in a huddle look round at the sound of a door, and approach- ing footsteps round a blind corner
There is no one in view when Karenin comes around the corner
The Ser- vants have vanished
He goes to Serozha's door
Anna comes out
He stops, astonished
Anna looks at him boldly, then pulls down her veil
Karenin bows
Anna walks past him
166 ' ,
-- Anna comes "home" from Karenin's house
The visit has changed her
She sits down in her hat and coat
Annushka comes in
Where's Anya
She's still asleep
Should  take your coat
Anna shakes her head
(') Are you feeling unwell, Madame
'm not sleeping
can send out for something
Anna nods
Twilight
Anna appears not to have moved
The baby is heard crying in another room
Anna's face remains set, but she reacts on hearing Vronsky coming in
Why are you in the dark
He turns on a gaslight
167 (') Yashvin is going to call
you remember him
(about her clothes) Are you going out
To where
To whom
What's the matter
didn't know what happened to you
But  told you yesterday
My brother
Does it take all day for you to meet your brother
Does he need you more than  do
Vronsky sits next to her and puts his arms round her
What's happened
Anna shakes her head
(') Well
Alexander agreed to everything
Mother's house in Moscow will go to him, and the country estate will be our new home
as soon as the divorce
Karenin hasn't answered your letter yet
Anna shakes her head
She stands up at last and takes off her hat
168 ' ,
-- Yashvin is a welcome visitor
It's wonderful to have you both returned
How good you are to come
You're the very first person to call on me since our return
Yashvin gets the point of that
He is embarrassed
(') received a note from Princess Betsy asking me if 'd call on her between six-thirty and eight
Or was it seven
Yashvin got the point of that, too
(') Alas, between six-thirty and seven is just when 'm unable to see her
But perhaps you'll meet at the opera tonight
would love to be there if  could get a box
() Madame, your box is number four
You'll find me there with Princess Myagkaya
Will you come, Vronsky
169 Vronsky shakes his head
Yashvin kisses Anna's hand
see why
Alexei is so fond of you
Yashvin laughs and bows himself out
You know you can't go to the theatre
Annushka
For heaven's sake-- Annushka comes
bath
'll come in and choose a dress
Annushka goes
Anna-- implore you--don't you know
'm not ashamed of who  am or what 've done: are you ashamed for me
Why do you keep a room at the hotel
Aren't we together
Have you changed towards me
It's because  love you and care about you
170 If that's the case,  don't know why you aren't coming with me
That would make it worse
You're afraid
Well, 'm not
,
-- Before the performance, the stairs, galleries and corridors, giving access to the stalls and boxes, are crowded with the town's highest society
And Anna, at her most beautiful, is magically cleaving through it
Awareness of her presence is like a contagion, and yet everyone manages not to catch her eye
so while all around her there are people impeding each other with greetings, Anna's path opens before her
She knows what is happening
It shocks her but her eyes barely show it
The spell is broken by Princess Myagkaya (she of the 85 kopek sauce) who hails her
Anna
She picks up on the surrounding effect of this, and rubs it in with mischief, taking Anna's arm
princess myagkaya (cont'd) Something has done you good--you look wonderful
171 ' ,  -- Vronsky sits and broods
Angrily, he changes his mind
He jumps up call- ing for Franz
,
-- Vronsky's cab draws up outside the brightly lit, deserted opera house
He alights
, ,  -- Vronsky comes up the stairs
The place is deserted, apart from Atten- dants
one of whom takes Vronsky's cloak and gives him a token
' ,  ,  -- On stage, Act One is just ending, and the curtain falls
The applause gives way to chatter
Should we visit or stay put
Anna sees Vronsky entering on the side-aisle below
He looks up at the boxes, seeking her
She turns away
Stay put
Princess Myagkaya has engaged the attention of Stremov in the neighbour- ing box
172 Minister
Congratulations
Come in for a moment
But Stremov only bows coldly and turns away
Yashvin notes this and begins to chew his moustache anxiously
Anna's neighbour on the other side, a meek husband of a battle-axe, admires her openly
Anna sees that Vronsky has stopped to talk to Countess Vronsky and the Princesses Sorokina
The young Princess seems animated by Vronsky, who bows himself away
Princess Myagkaya sees where Anna is looking
princess myagkaya (cont'd) Princess Sorokina and her daughter, they're from Moscow, neighbours of Countess Vron- sky, quite well off, no sons, she's a widow
Anna gives her a smiling but wounded look
princess myagkaya (cont'd) My dear, 'm a sales catalogue
,  -- Vronsky meets Alexander in the aisle and greets him
You'll come up to see us afterwards
Talk to Varya
173 Alexander indicates his seat to Vronsky
Vronsky sits by Varya
Will you call on Anna
Oh, Alexei
'm fond of you
but
For God's sake, Anna isn't a criminal
'd call on her if she'd only broken the law
But she broke the rules
Vronsky is angry and offended
He gets up, bows to Varya
When he looks up, he sees Betsy beckoning to him from her box
' ,  -- Anna watches Vronsky, sees him acknowledge Betsy's summons
Who has made the decor
Haven't we got a programme
Colonel, would you be so kind
Of course
Anna's neighbour, emboldened, offers her his programme
174 Please
would be honoured if you would take mine
Thank you, how very
The Neighbour's Wife, catching this, reacts as though electrocuted
' ,  -- Princess Betsy is smoking
Prince Tverskoy is examining an ancient book
Vronsky enters the box
He bows to the Prince, and kisses Betsy's hand
Catullus, printed in Venice, 1501
remarkable
grovelling House Manager appears in their midst, to tell Betsy she can't smoke in the box
() thousand apologies, Princess, but
Princess Betsy blows smoke and hands the cigarette, in its holder, to a figure standing quietly in the shadowy corner of the box: Makhotin
Makhotin takes the cigarette from the holder, crushes it in his left palm
He feels humiliated
but that's love
The House Manger bows and leaves
Captain Makhotin
The Angry Wife's voice cuts through the audience chatter
175 ' It's a disgrace
Take me home
Vronsky turns round to look
He sees the Husband trying to calm his Wife
Fetch my cloak
Vronsky sees Anna looking straight ahead
Yashvin is eating his moustache
' ,  -- The scene next door is a social catastrophe for Anna, but she is riding it
Princess Myagkaya takes her hand
Yashvin shrinks into his corner, morti- fied
The whole opera house is becoming aware of the "scandal
" The Angry Wife has raised her voice
' ,  -- What are we coming to
The Husband has succeeded in putting his wife's cloak over her shoulders
Her exit line is for the benefit of the entire audience
(') Is this the opera house or a--or a French music hall--
The Wife and her Husband leave the box
176 '  ,  -- Vronsky is tormented
He moves to leave the box
() Yes, why don't you
Rescue her and put your seal on the fiasco
Vronsky knows it and is trapped
(') Alexei
you see why she must divorce
Marriage will solve everything
When will it be
As far as 'm concerned, she's my wife
But, as you saw, she isn't
We're going to Moscow, and then to my place in the country
That sounds like a good idea
But for a day or two, Anna will be at home, at my flat
Betsy shrugs
177 (') () Then, 'll say goodbye now
' ,
-- Angry and upset, Anna sweeps into the flat in her opera cloak
Vronsky follows her in
you had an excellent night
Does your mother want you to marry the widow or the child
Either one
Don't make a joke of it
If you loved me, you would have locked me in to stop me going
She throws aside her cloak and goes into the bedroom
,  ,  -- Annushka, asleep in a chair, waiting loyally, wakes up
Go to bed
Vronsky comes in as Annushka goes out
He comes to Anna and puts his arms round her
178 Yes, it was my fault
won't sleep
know how to make you sleep
-- Vronsky makes love to Anna but it's not working for her
Her eyes stray around
By the bed is a carafe of water, an empty glass and a pharmacy bottle as dark as ink, with a handwritten label
-- High summer
Heat and dust
, -- Anna, with some dainty shopping by her, is taking tea in a genteel cafe
Her eye is caught by a mother and son at another table
The boy is a "Serozha
" Anna misses her son acutely in that moment
Then Dolly enters the tea shop
Anna's heart lifts for a moment and she is about to greet her, but then realises that Dolly is one of a trio of "society ladies," and Anna lowers her head
When she sneaks a look, she catches one of the ladies whispering to the others
Anna realises that she has been recognised by a stranger, and is notorious
She "hides" in her purse, finding money to leave on the table so that she can escape
sound makes her look up and she sees that Dolly has sat down opposite her
179 Anna
am very glad to see you
Are you well
How is your little one
Anna nods, words won't come
(') Stiva wanted to invite you and Count Vron- sky to the house but it's impossible
understand
No, no--you don't
Kitty and her husband are with us
She's in Moscow to have the baby
Kitty
Oh, tell her how pleased  am
Perhaps 'll wait a year or two
(she gulps a laugh) Oh
love
Yes
love
Don't you disapprove of me for what 've done
No
wish 'd done the same
But no one asked me
Well
wouldn't have been brave enough
(she blinks tears) Stiva, you know
he doesn't change
like all men,  suppose
180 She doesn't notice her tactlessness but it lands on Anna, who manages a smile
, -- , -- Anna, in a nightdress, is awake in the night, staring out of the grand window of a grand hotel, smoking
,  -- Anna comes back to bed
Vronsky is asleep
She unstops a pharmacy bottle (a different one) and pours a draught mixed with water
,  -- Anna sleeps alone in the bed
Annushka, after a tap on the door, comes in cautiously, worried
Madame
Madame
Anna sits up
(') Are you ill
What time is it
Is Anya up
181 It's afternoon, Madame
'm all right
It's all right
() Get them to bring up all our trunks and travel cases
We've been here long enough
, -- Vronsky comes in, noting the empty trunks and cases stacked up
Anna comes from her room to greet him
She is making an effort to be pleasant, but she looks excited, febrile
had an inspiration
Why do we have to wait here
Why can't we wait in the coun- try
don't want to hear any more about a divorce, or think about it
Good
'm bored here
When should we go
If  bore you here, 'll bore you in the country
didn't say you bore me
Moscow bores me
When should we go
Tomorrow
But Anna's mood has turned
182 can't be ready by tomorrow
The day after, then
If you like
No, wait
That's Sunday
have to see Maman
That's twenty minutes away in the train-- you could go to see her tomorrow--or was it that you wanted to spend Sunday with Princess Sorokina
Please don't spoil everything
can't see Maman tomorrow because she won't have read the papers she has to sign
Oh, and then there's the bank
But we can leave on Tuesday
In that case, let's not bother
'll leave on Sunday or not at all
That's absurd
183 It's absurd to you because you have no understanding for my life here
Anna
Anna
You've stopped loving me
You've given up everything for me, and it's turned you against me
Why lie about it
Stop
put off our departure for a day or two, and you tell me  don't love you
Because 've been living off your love and there's none left, so this is over
Finished
She leaves him, slamming the door
, ,  -- Anna comes in and lies down on the bed, closes her eyes, sits up, pours a dose from the medicine bottle by the bed, and lies down
Vronsky comes in
He takes her hand
'm sorry
don't mind when we go
'll telegraph Maman
We'll go on Sunday
'll do anything you want
184 You should leave me
don't want to
love you
Why
You can't ask why about love
,  -- Anna comes straight from bed
She is drugged and shaky
The room is empty but there is a coffee tray on the table
Anna feels the coffeepot and pours herself a cup
,  -- Vronsky is at his desk
Anna enters with her coffee
Vronsky is reading a telegram
Seeing her enter, he puts the telegram under his papers
So--will you be all packed
'll be out today making the arrangements
Is that your way of telling me you'll be at your mother's with that simpering little princess
185 No
'll be with my lawyers
'm waiting for some documents
Then 'm having dinner to say goodbye to old comrades
Well,  know what that means
My God, this is unendurable
He controls himself
(') can invite them here if you like
Thank you, but if 'm not fit to dine in soci- ety,  won't eat with the band
Who was the telegram from
Vronsky retrieves the telegram and hands it to her
didn't show it to you, because Stiva keeps telegraphing what we already know
Kare- nin promises nothing, but will consider
Anna tosses the telegram aside unread
told you  don't care about the divorce, so why hide the telegram
What else do you hide from me
186 hide nothing from you
Why do you care about the divorce
What has it got to do with us loving each other
Until we're married, our daughter is legally Karenin's
care about it because we need to be free to marry
You're perfectly free to marry anyone your mother wants
But we aren't talking about-- Yes, we are, and, by the way, compared to your mother 'm the Virgin Mary
Vronsky is silent with anger
He gets up and goes out, returning with his hat in his hand
Is there anything you wish to say to me
She remains silent
He leaves again
She lights a cigarette
187 ,  -- The Sorokina Coach draws up outside the door
The coach with its crest and the Coachman's livery (a bright yellow cockade) are highly distinctive
,  -- Anna, with her cup of coffee, comes in and looks down from the window
' -- Vronsky, hat in hand, at the coach window, accepts a large envelope from a lilac-gloved hand
He bows
With a wave of the hand and a flash of golden hair, the coach pulls away
Vronsky goes back inside
,  ,  -- With the envelope, Vronsky comes in
Anna is as he left her, the cigarette stubbed out
So it's the child
She brought papers from Maman
He hesitates, thinking she is about to speak
(') Anna
She stays silent
He leaves
188 ,  ,  -- Anna finds Annushka filling several half-filled cases
Unpack everything
We're not going
She lies down on the bed
Annushka would like to comfort her
Anna Arkadyeva
When Count Vronsky comes back, tell him
don't want to be disturbed
,  -- Anna is listening for Vronsky's return
She hears him come in
She hears him approach
Then she hears Annushka's voice, then Vronsky's voice
She waits in suspense, disappointed as Vronsky's steps retreat
,  -- Anna, holding a candle-lamp, finds Vronsky asleep on the couch
She hesi- tates, but turns away
,  -- Anna wakes
She re-collects herself
She looks at the bedside clock
In a sud- den hurry she leaves the bed and the bedroom
189 ,  , -- Anna finds Annushka waiting
Count Vronsky
He went out early, to the stables, he said
Anna collapses on a chair and weeps
Oh, Annushka
should have died
Do you remember
Don't take it to heart, Anna Arkadyeva
've made him hate me
()-- Anna's hand writes in a hurry: "'m to blame
Come home
'm frightened
" ,  -- Anna seals the note and gives it to Annushka
190 Tell Michael to hurry
Annushka runs out with the note
-- Anna is keeping watch at the window
and is rewarded by the return- ing coach
She hurries out
, -- Anna looks down into the entrance hall
Michael, the Coachman, comes in and comes up the stairs to her
She sees that he is holding her note
Count Vronsky had already left, Your Excel- lency
He took a cab to the station
to the Countess
-- Anna clutches her red bag to her, sitting among passengers
Anna looks about her
Across the carriage she sees through the window that her train is overtaking another passenger train on the next line
She looks at the windows of the other train "going by"
seeing the pas- sengers inside
Unexpectedly, she seems to see a Man who might be Vronsky sitting opposite a laughing Woman who might be Princess Sorokina
191 Anna's body jerks involuntarily
She half rises
The image, however, is brief and is borne away, as her own train goes by, accelerating
The win- dows opposite pick up speed as she leaves them behind-- And then she has the same illusion again-- a "Vronsky" and a "Sorokina" glimpsed in the other train and snatched away in the instant
Now she stands up and goes to the opposite window, where the windows of the other train are flashing by in the (anachronistic) manner of pro- jected film-frames, and she sees "Vronskys" and "Sorokinas" flashing by at gathering speed
And then the train has gone and there's nothing going by but the view
Anna collapses into the nearest seat
,  -- The train arrives at a small station
Anna steps down from the train
The platform is well populated by people waiting to board the train or to meet the arriving passengers
There is an energy about the people-- shouting, laughter, movement
Porters shout for custom
couple of Young Men seem to be laughing rudely directly at her, but they pass by, ignoring her
Anna pauses, bewildered, lost, not knowing what to do next
She sees the Sorokina Coachman on the platform, recognising his distinctive livery, a cockade in his hat
Are you waiting for the Princess Sorokina
192 No, Your Excellency, both princesses are at the house of Countess Vronsky
'm waiting -- Anna turns back, agitated, expecting Vronsky to appear, but what comes is a Footman carrying three hatboxes and a large box from a dress shop
Anna walks away, along the platform, impeded by people going by her, aware that some are staring at her as she passes
Boy selling drinks grins at her
little group of Ladies and Children meeting a bespectacled man off the train are laughing and chattering but fall silent and look at her
She increases her pace
She hurries away towards the far end of the platform
Beyond her, a goods train is slowly approaching
Between her and the train, two Maidservants are walking towards her
They turn their heads to look at her, remarking on her dress
Look at that lace on her
There is a rough bench near the end of the platform
Anna reaches it and sits down
The two girls turn again to look back at her, and are struck by the sight of Anna sitting alone in profile
The goods train reaches her and the first wagon goes past her
The two girls stop and watch, vaguely puzzled by her
As they watch, the beautiful woman on the bench gets up and walks the few steps to the edge of the wooden platform and into the path of the train, disappearing from view between the wheels of one of the wagons
()-- -- 193 -- --lying separate against a rail, is clipped by a rolling train-wheel and knocked aside, spilling its contents
()-- scythe cuts a swathe through standing hay
, ,  -- It's nearly the last of the hay
The scythe is being swung by Theodore, known from last year
He is one of a dozen Mowers
Levin is among them, wielding his scythe
They have almost reached the end of the field, where the last of the hay is being pitchforked up on to the last piled cart
Theodore's daughter-in-law, now visibly pregnant, is still adept with a pitchfork
It's a lowering thundery day at the end of summer
'll be buying in feed before winter's over
() Well, you don't press people hard, but you live rightly, for your soul, not your belly
My soul
What's that
know what my belly is
How do we know what's rightly
believe in reason
194 Reason
And was it reason that made you chose a wife
() No
You're a great one for reasoning, Konstantin Dmitrich, but what's rightly is outside your mathematic--that's what's rightly about it
This stops Levin's scythe
He is illumined
Theodore swings the scythe again
Levin walks away, gives his scythe to a Labourer by the cart, and keeps walking
He quickens his pace
-- The first drops of rain, few and heavy, arrive
, , -- Cries of alarm and laughter burst from a Mushrooming Party approaching the house
Children run ahead, the adults walk faster, then run, helping with baby carriages and picking up small children and baskets of mush- rooms
urged on from the porch by Agafia
Levin, coming from the hay field, joins the rout
195 The grown-ups are: Levin, Oblonsky, Dolly, the Oblonsky Nurse, Prince and Princess Shcherbatsky
The children are: Tanya, Grisha, Masha, Lili and Vasili
Dolly carries her youngest
The children are eighteen months older than when we first saw them
The heavens open as everyone gets under cover
Where's Ekaterina Alexandrovna
It's all right, the mistress is giving Mitya his bath
It is evident from her tone that Kitty and Agafia have made it up long ago
, ,  -- Rain on the window and on the roof
The rain is so loud that it is the foreground sound in the scene; and the dialogue, while we can pick it out without difficulty, is the background sound
Levin enters, wet
Dmitri (Mitya), two months old, is lying on his back in a basin, supported by Kitty's palm under his head
Kitty squeezes a sponge over his body, which he likes
196 came looking for you
understood something
And what was that
Kitty lifts Mitya onto a towel on her lap, wraps him and gives him to Levin, who is enchanted by him
He smiled at me
( ) He's very advanced for his age
She picks up her rings to replace them on her fingers
(') What did you understand
But the baby starts to yell for the breast
Kitty starts to undo her blouse
Levin shakes his head: he'll tell her some other time, or maybe not
, -- The storm has passed
Everything drips
Oblonsky comes from inside and lights a cigar
Indistinctly seen and heard through the window, the Mushrooming Party occupies the dining room
Oblonsky smokes thoughtfully, melancholy
197 -- Baby Anya, old enough to stagger on her feet, wavers through wild flowers half her height
She falls over, almost disappearing
This is being watched, with a mixture more pleasure than pain, by Kar- enin
He is in early retirement, sitting with a book in a garden seat, dressed comfortably under a straw hat
There is the   of people playing croquet
Serozha, aged ten, enters his view, going to Anya to haul her upright, and keeping hold of her hand as she staggers on
Karenin's pleasure increases slightly
this, the growing  of a battlefield
()-- Vronsky, in an unfamiliar uniform, sabre pointing forward, is mounted at full gallop with the  of the charge all around him in the smoke and noise of guns
Something heavy and invisible with its own --like the flap of an awning--takes him from his horse into the air and gone, leaving spouts of blood poised for an instant in the smoke
, 198 Serozha picks up Anya like a parcel under his arm and walks on with her towards the indistinct figures of Croquet Players strolling in the heat haze, a couple of parasols held aloft
