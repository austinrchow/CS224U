1 very English scene - a beautiful English garden belonging to a mansion house
smartly turned out gardener in green overalls is raking leaves
It's an impressive picture of Britishness and order
Another gardener,  is trimming the edge of the lawn
We see shots of the garden; plants, trees, a gazebo, sundial, water fountain etc
We follow one of the gardeners pushing a wheelbarrow across the width of the lawn and we see the rear of this impressive property

Behind him, on the stage, we see a 'European Entrepreneur of the Year Award' banner
Orphaned when he was just a boy, Harry Papadopoulos came to this country with nothing
() 5   :                                                 5 We cut to the family seated at a round table
The children look bored
listens proudly
(') Harry was a grafter, entering the restaurant trade as a young man
(Beat) That's a euphemism for 'Greek waiter' isn't it
There is some laughter in the audience
We cut to  again, who attempts to smile off the joke
(') Only joking Harry
He then started the now famous Papadopoulos & Sons - doing all things Greek
From taramasalata to olive oil and frozen mousakas - which, must admit, my wife and  are partial to occasionally
Not one to settle, Harry's made the move into commercial property where he's about to embark on one of the most audacious developments yet - Papadopoulos Plaza
two million square foot redevelopment in the heart of our great city
(Applause from the audience) Ladies and Gentlemen,  give you European Entrepreneur of the Year
Harry Papadopoulos

We now cut to  getting up from the table
He momentarily acknowledges the applause
The children are clapping politely but absently

is at his desk with pots of plants and various tools and test tubes with soil and desk lamps

surveys the room trying to accommodate his son's interest in botany
He notices a poster of Charles Darwin with a quote
He reads it out

Fascinating
Charles Darwin

Alright
Defer the final year
Take a year out, why not
Fine
But don't quit
Your mother would have said the same
Would she
Well, your mother would probably have said do what you feel was right but 'd argue she was wrong

What are the bastards proposing
They've demanded the 300 million we borrowed
Thirty by close of play
Sweet mother of God
They are sons of bitches
They've taken a new position on the value of the property development
It's triggered the guarantees
Can you sell it

When it's bad, they get paid want my son to be a lawyer for the same reason

So what are the options
Well, the obvious is to buy back your own business
Trick is finding the investors to back you
And the banks will sell back to me because
Because nobody makes pink slop like you do Harry
The banks just want a quick sale
They have no interest in running your business
Let's jump on it
'll talk to private equity firms, VCs, angels

We'll find someone

always had a way back when she was with us
Elizabeth was so good to me
She was our world
She was our world
Harry is chocked and is trying to hold it together
'm sorry,  can't
It's okay
've got to get to this meeting
It's an important meeting
It's okay to miss her
Oh man
(Silence) Just give me a minute

The van eventually starts and pulls away

,  &  -

48 , ,  and  - a Scandinavian banker - are sitting round the boardroom table
With the help of Lars and the Norske Velconan Bank, we aim to buy Pap and Sons back from the receivers
Also,  have to say Harry that believe there is an intuitive bond between the Greek and the Nordic peoples, yah
And so, maybe the very first vikings were descended from Ancient Greeks, somewhere in the deep mists of time
And so it's so
so Wagnerian, yah
() 51 48   :                                                48 We should point out the new approach
To buy Papadopoulos & Sons but divest the food manufacturing side of the business
Divest the food manufacturing
What else is there
Sell off the food but keep the property
Papadopoulos Plaza
It's going to be worth a fortune
That's not what  had in mind
It's an asset breakup
Tusk
Tusk, yah
Makes us sound like barbarians
With the new loan, you'd buy back your old assets and then sell off the brands in the Pap & Sons stable
Yah
And you know how to squeeze the value Harry
That's a break up
Please
know what it is
The pitta bread, the cakes get sold to a bakery
The halloumi and feta to a dairy company
love your halloumi
Grilled
It's
(Kisses air) () 52 48   : (2)                                            48 The sell off value of these brands will exceed the new loan
So my bank will get its money back faster than you can say 'knife'
And what do you get
Lars wants 50% of the Plaza development
Which is what will remain after the debts have been settled
So you get 50% of the development for free
Sure, yeah
But you get 50% of the same development yah, also for free
What do you want Harry
want my food business back
Guy,   guys, guys
Reality check
Harry
It's   not going to happen
Okay
The best   you can hope for is to work with Lars   here and save something
can't say no
Okay
So
Yah
need to take this to the board
Take two, three months
But pish, yah
It seems criminal to buy the business back only to break it up
As an aside to
Can  just point out that you are skating
Figuratively speaking
On thin fucking ice
'll do whatever the bank wants
() 53 48   : (3)                                            48 Okay
Harry, we are going to take this to the hoop, yah
Three points
Yah
Three points

Taking out a loan to pay off a loan
So you can remortgage a property
It's got nothing to do with business
It's got nothing to do with making stuff
get my life back
No
You get a loan for some land
My children get their lives back
'm sorry
This isn't very professional
Do you give all your clients a hard time Sophie
No
Just the interesting ones
You got five minutes
Yeah
Of course
Just want to talk about the shop and make sure my brother's got the right plan before  go
Okay
Let's grab a coffee

() 54 50   :                                                50 So it's 30% on materials
The fish, the potatoes, the packaging etc
Would you include energy
Light, heat
Yeah
But not rent because we already own the building
Okay
And 30% on labour
Yeah
So it's 30/30/30
Classic restaurant model
That's right
What are your weaknesses
The price of fish can vary
Dramatically
Can you vary the menu
You don't want to complicate it
It doesn't have to be complicated Harry
(Beat) What are your fears
My fears
Oh
Just that it just won't work out
That fish and chips has maybe had its day
No
Hang on a second
(They stop) Fish and chips is a British classic
It's much more than just a quick meaningless experience
It's something to be savoured
Just think of the soft, white, cod flakes, gently falling away as your fork pierces the hard, crunchy shell of the golden batter
The rich smells of a fryer's delight
The tangy smack of salt and vinegar on your lips
Hell yeah
'd pay for that

What
This time last year  was in Malibu
We'll go tonight
It's not a nightclub
It's America
Oh
Look
The shop's where 'm from but it's not where 'm going to end up
My Dad must've said that to my Mum once
Maybe even on this bridge
See
Look where he ended up
So, what's your plan
Property
Got an eye for it
'll probably be a pop star one day
Cool
Yo, yo, yo

Yo, yo, blue bottle fly

You is bloated
You is fatally attracted
to my light bulb
That is well sick

Fish is being fried
Potatoes are being sliced and fried
Pickled onions are being poured into the European Entrepreneur vase
The shop is being cleaned and the kids mess around
Fish and chips are being prepared

Lovely
Come and try
Fresh fish
Lovely hot chips

Battered inside
Special chip for you
And one for you
Fish and chips, come and try

Across the road, we see  leave his shop and cross the road towards The Three Brothers
He is coming over to talk to offers him some fish and chips

Almost like a referee
drinks a cup of tea
It's not just fish and chips
There's room for all of us
What do you want Hassan
Remember when we were children
When we were friends
We weren't Greeks, Turks
Respectfully,  would like you to take your kebabs off the menu
This is a fish and chip shop
What do we get
won't do fish
You don't do fish Hassan
You are going to put us on the street
It's business
It's not about business
Perhaps you would not be like this if we were Greeks
'll tell you what
We'll take kebabs off the menu, if you ask your son to stay away from my daughter
thinks about this
He sips his tea
More tea
() 58 54   :                                                54 No
Thank you
This is very difficult
Come on
It's easy
My son is his own man
Right
There's no deal
Is this because he's Turkish
Because he's a Muslim
Oh no
don't have a problem with that
Harry's not like that
Because he works in a kebab shop
Is that it
Yeah
Harry's more like that
would ask you - both of you - to respect a man's aspiration for his daughter
have similar aspirations for my son
Spiro, perhaps you should remind your brother where he is now
Tell him to look around
Perhaps he still sees a big mansion with gardens and servants
Well,  don't
But more importantly, neither does my son
This is only
We'll be gone in a couple of months
hope so
It's going to be a very long couple of months
For both of us

We now see a series of photo stills, as you would find in a family album or on a rotating screen saver
The images cover over two months of activity at the shop and beyond
Some of these shots are out of focus
Some are over exposed etc
Some are badly framed
Sometimes the people in the shots are aware of being photographed, sometimes not
They rotate once every four or five seconds throughout the song
The images we see are: 1

You, you made it
