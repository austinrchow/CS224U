by David Twohy August 6, 1995 : -
- Blinding in their white uniforms, naval flag officers sit in the audience, showing their support for  , a 50-year-old civilian
This is his confirmation hearing
Reading from prepared material: last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties
What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on -- Whoa, whoa, whoa
"Land-based maritime specialties
" Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that
At the center of a dais,   leans back to ponder the ceiling of the hearing room
Her plaque card reads " --
" DeHaven is a tough-hided old Southern belle, Scarlett 'Hara at 60
In her arsenal she carries conversational hand-grenades -- and she's apt to pull a pin at the slightest whim
Would that be anything like "typing"
"Restocking the cupboards"
That sort of thing, Mr
Hayes
from the packed gallery
The flag officers go stone-faced
Hayes forces a smile
Hardly the case, Senator
Well, 'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if  jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type
am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military
Case in point
On cue, aides begin distributing reports to other members of the dais
Hayes gets a copy, too
And it jars him
"The Lark Report
" Madam Senator
this is an internal document of the
Navy
must seriously question whether -- (to others on panel) The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an -14 aboard an aircraft carrier
Female aviator, it just so happens
(to Hayes) You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am  right
was one member of the investigating commission
Yes,  see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's
And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm
'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of -- 'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr
Hayes
humorless smile
She's roasting his nuts over an open fire, and everyone knows it
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier
That aside for the moment, 'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report
the degrading remarks by other aviators
innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations
even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior
(closing report) In my seven years on this committee, 've never seen a downed aviator treated like this
Never
'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr
Hayes
Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well
-
- Heading for her office, DeHaven is escorted by a small a full 35 percent of all jobs in the
military are still, to this day, off-limits to women
And that's simply gotta change
#1 What about those who say women aren't suited for all jobs
That they're physically weaker
they have less stamina
Sure
And we're gonna hog the bathroom, too
'  catches up, pulls her aside
' White House boys want a private meeting
'll act surprised
'  -
- Shoes dumped on her desk, DeHaven changes out knee-high stockings while devoting one ear to
#1 to reassure you that he has every faith in the ability of Mr
Hayes to guide the Navy into the next century
The task, as the Administration sees it, is to acknowledge changing realities without losing traditional values
beat
DeHaven looks between the two   boys -- #1 young and eager, #2 older and cagier
'Zat it
Ten minutes, nothin' on the table
Sweetcakes, you best go back to the President and tell him to open up the phone book and start lookin' for his next nominee
White House #1 looks spanked
Taking over, #2 pops a briefcase
An inch-think report appears before DeHaven
#2 Administration's plan for 100 percent integration
If female candidates measure up in a series of test cases, the President will support full integration within three years' time
Surprised -- maybe even startled -- DeHaven flips through the report, absorbing by osmosis
#2 It's your gender-blind Navy, Senator
Surely you're not going to balk now
Well, it's just that askin' you all to integrate the Navy is like sending a man to do a woman's job
(a beat) How do you propose to handle the Combat Exclusion Laws
#2 Keep narrowing the definitions
Keep redefining
#1 We got around it in Saudi Arabia
By calling women "Honorary Men
" Ingenious
#2 'mon, Senator, President's pitchin' right down the center of your plate
If women measure up to men, they've got the job
You going to take a swing
Or step out of the box
DeHaven riffles the edges of the report, thinking it over
Thinking light years ahead
- Buttoning up topcoats, the White House boys move down marble steps to reach a pair of limousines
Hayes and two wait
Well
#2 (shaking hand) Congratulations, Mr
Secretary
'  - Inside the moving car: So she picks the women, we pick the programs
Seals
#1 'd go Special Reconnaissance
Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men
Then  suggest we start there
#1 Doesn't matter who she picks
No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course
And don't care who it is
-
- Winterscape:  Dotted with ice floes, the Potomac wends through the capitol city, banks iridescent with snow, morning water calm
There's an almost hallowed beauty to it all
Soon we pick out
spot of day-glo
Coming out of the mouth of morning
Overtaking the floes
on  '
She pushes her flat-water kayak downriver, paddling hard and clean, making good time
Gliding through the graceful arches of the Arlington bridge, she passes
Cars overhead
Grid-locked by snow conditions
In seconds Jordan paddles clear, leaving the traffic behind as she heads toward the Washington Monument
Something  from a life-vest pocket
She rips through velcro to free a cell phone
Lieutenant 'Neil
(
) Gotta situation here
Where are you
Stuck in traffic
(checking dive watch) Not due in for 22 minutes, sir
Watcha got
-
- All right, stand by, we're going to switch over to
reroutes the call via defense satellite, cryptography flashing on terminals
Lieutenant Commander   joins other Intel officers at a conference table
They're pouring over weather charts, navigation logs, high-altitude  video
Voice-system now secure
(into speaker) Okay, fresh stuff:  Lost a plane over the Sea of Japan signals leads us to believe the pilot is alive and has made his way to the North Korean shore, near a fishing village, "Tamyung
" (
) Do we know it's him using the beacon
Not a decoy
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries
(
) Chances of recovery
You're the analyst for East China, 'Neil
Analyze
-
- Riding the current, Jordan blows a troubled sigh as she accesses the file of her brain
Drifting past the Jefferson Memorial: North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world
The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system
Extraction team has to be small and silent -- 'd go with Seals over Delta Force
Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice
Where's The Polk
: Halfway 'round the world
So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out
(an inspired beat) Unless you Whiskey Run
Blank faces here, 'Neil
Quick-hit technique used by Capone
Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles
All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride
Check the files -- -57 -- doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub
But don't waste time opening and closing hatches
They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters
dubious beat
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back
Is that correct, 'Neil
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir
Why not
Silence on the radio:  They're discussing her scenario privately
During, Jordan's kayak reaches the junction of the Potomac and the Anacostia rivers
On the far bank lies
Naval Intel Center (
), bristling with communication antennae
Jordan stares at the complex, waiting for a response
All right, sending the recommendation across the river
Royce out
The phone goes dead
No, thank you, sir
-
- Bundled in topcoat and scarves, military and civilian employees transit a security station on their way inside
Presently Jordan appears -- wearing a wetsuit and balancing a collapsed kayak on her head
She flashes a photo-badge and double-times inside
-
- Jordan exits a locker room
Smoothing out her Khaki uniform, she heads down a broad corridor with cipher-lock doors
Falling in step: That was good headwork, lieutenant
Thank you, sir
We hear back from the Pentagon
(scoffing) Probably hear back from  first
Hate this part
Just sweating it out on the sidelines
Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle
Now they reach
-
- circular chamber
Dominating the ground floor is the bullpen, a hive of cubicles an computer stations
On the second floor are executive offices, ringing the bullpen
By the way, 'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so  can review it with Admiral Hanover
And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here
(with a look) Is this my glory, sir
On the upper walkway, a frazzled appears
She spots Royce and Jordan below
Excuse me, but  have Senator DeHaven on the line for you
Jesus God, what now
He bounds up the stairs toward his office
'm sorry, sir no -- she asked to speak with Lieutenant 'Neil
Royce turns back and gives Jordan a hall-of-fame look
"Oh, really
" '  -
- (into phone) So everyone  talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside
(
) Thank you, ma'am
Um, may  ask what this is regarding
(reading file) High-school pentathlete scholarship, graduated with honors
top marks in Basic Training
and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia
Oh, the things 'll do for one extra vote
-
- On the phone, Jordan glances around
Co-workers mull within earshot
Those out of earshot post -mail memos on Jordan's computer:  "Moving up in life
"  " want a full report
"  "Don't tell her who you really voted for
" Lieutenant 'Neil,  am prepared to nominate you for the Navy's Special Reconnaissance program
Should you accept, you'll ship out to Coronado next week and join in the big testosterone festival
Complete the course, and you'll have a fast ticket to any assignment you want
That's my personal promise to you
beat as Jordan's mind catches up to her ears
Now the two: "Coronado
" California
know that, sir
Ma'am
It's just that
Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but
do you understand that this involves combat training
This is just a test case, 'Neil
But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat
Or, actually, its official non-policy
Now who's your immediate superior there
Captain Dwyer
Technically
My office will fill him in and help expedite
Look forward to meeting you at the proper time
Jumping off now
Uh, question, ma'am
Yes, dear
Would  be the only one
The only woman
There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter
And your success would mean a lot
Jumping, now
The line goes dead
Jordan hangs up catatonically
Well, shit-a-doodle-do
-  - small gunkhole harbor up the Potomac
Snow falls thick and silent on overturned canoes, stored for the winter
Beyond stands a clapboard rental house
'  - It's not so much furnished as equipped -- scuba gear and wetsuits in the mud room, life vests on coat racks, a training bag and boxing gloves hanging in the living room
In the kitchen we find
naked man
He's steeping tea
(
) well,  survived Basic Training and three brothers -- so  know how to fight
What scares me are the sexual politics
don't want to be turned into some poster girl for women's rights
as the naked man carries a steaming mug through the house
- '  - and sets it down beside Jordan, languishing in a tub
Snow builds on a window sill
Facing Jordan, the man slides into the tub
So why're you even considering it
Are you
Just like you would be
Spec-Recon
Those guys are world- class warriors
And they will not want you there, Jordan
take it you don't either
Feet
Dutifully, Royce massages her feet
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel
Royce
We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while 'm still down in the bullpen
What does that tell you about the Navy
(shaking head) She's haze grey and underway
You need operational duty to really advance
you need combat training to go operational
yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits
'm topped out at Intel
Forget the glass ceiling -- 'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling
So dump on me
This has nothing to do with you
(getting out) Well, guess  don't even need to be here
Get your dick back here
It has everything to do with you
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes
Especially at night
Sorry
But after our days
(a thoughtful sip) So if  try this thing
if  ship out to Coronado
what happens here
'll try to keep the door open
If you wash out,  make it so that -- Wai', wait
What happens if it works
Four months of training, three years of operational duty
What then
(blowing a sigh) don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan
Maybe we should just let it happen
Which is guy-speak for
(conceding) Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth
But 'm trying to be honest, okay
Three years is a long time
Don't ask me to predict how 'll feel then, Jordan, because don't know
And either do you
You know, right up until you said that --  thought  did know
Wounded, she gets out
Jordan
Thank you, Royce
It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy
Really, thank you so much
She punches into a robe and leaves
Royce considers drowning himself in the tub
-   - Jordan drives a top-down Mustang across the sweeping Coronado Bridge, cityscape behind her, naval base ahead
flock of pelicans pace Jordan alongside the bridge
Suddenly two    overhead, scattering the pelicans
-    - On base, Jordan carries a gunnysack across an asphalt courtyard
The is "the grinder," reminiscent of a gladiator's arena
She notices at one end
silver ship's bell
Hung prominently
-    - Excuse me, lieutenant
was told this is where  check in
looks up to find Jordan across a counter
In no particular hurry, the duty officer makes his way over to check Jordan's orders
(looking up) So you're the one
Hearing, other workers look up
Among them is a female ensign,   -- no makeup, no nail polish, no concession to her sex
Throughout, she'll watch Jordan with more than passing interest
Still don't have my bearings yet
Direct me to the officer's quarters
The duty officer stamps her paperwork, returns it with room assignment and keys
You'll proceed directly to the infirmary for eye tests, blood tests, urinalysis, pregnancy test
Uniform issue adjacent
Then you're to report to the Base Commander
He'd like a word with you
Fine
And the officer's quarters
's office can supply you with directions
Enjoy your visit, lieutenant
It's a nasty little barb -- one that Jordan decides to let slide
Jordan turns for the door
Blondell catches up with a base map
, south side
Take a starboard tack out the door
Thank you, ensign
No problem, lieutenant
'  -    - soft
Come
opens the door
Behind him is Jordan
Lieutenant j
g
'Neil reporting, sir
For a beat,   (
)  takes stock of the female in his doorway, sizing her up like a fighter across the ring
Then he stubs out a perfectly good cigar, rises with an amiable face, and touches the back of a chair -- stopping just short of pulling it out for her
Yes, of course
Please, have a seat, lieutenant
Thank you, sir
Would you care for a beverage
Tea
'm fine, sir
So
We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training
It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you
Thank you, sir
But  expect a certain amount of pain
More stock-taking
Is he looking at her hair
Barber was my next stop, sir
Would've had it regulation sooner, only -- Don't worry about it
If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all 'm going to ask
Really,  have no problem with -- 'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant
You'll have separate beds, separate heads
If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary
If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so  can deal with it immediately
Questions
None at this time, sir
Then that's all  have to say
Dismissed
Another smile, another phantom gesture on the back of her chair
If Jordan was expecting a fight, the bell never sounded
She rises, salutes -- then turns back at the door
Sir,  just want you to know
'm not here to make a statement don't want to make men look foolish
All  care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else,  suspect
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant,  suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we
(a beat) Take your leave
-    - The Spec-Recon  loiter outside their open rooms, pumping weights, hosing down dive gear, trading Walkman tapes
This is the last day of liberty they'll have for a long time
What am  scannin' here
Other eyes quickly lock in on
Jordan
Across a grass courtyard, she walks the ground floor of an identical building, trying to match key number to room number
Every door is open, every room empty
Soon she feels the presence of
The men
They're disgorging from their rooms -- ten, twenty, thirty of them -- all buffed and cut
These guys are what Hitler saw in his dreams
Jordan picks up her pace
Where the hell is her room
On all three levels of their building, the men shadow Jordan en masse
Not hooting
Not leering
Just assessing
Jordan finds her room at the far corner of the building: She's got the entire floor to herself
With a last look over her shoulder, Jordan vanishes inside
-    - Special Reconnaissance
Here you will be trained to infiltrate hostile territory
to be the real- time eyes on the ground
to recover assigned targets and, if need be, to fight your way out under adverse conditions
faces of the trainees:  , , , , , , , ,
We'll get to know them later
Dressed in Navy greens, they stand in formation -- ten rows, ten deep, helmets in hand
Pacing before them: That is all that will be said about the special nature of this class -- by us or by you
Many of you have waited years for admission to this program
Opportunities like this are rare -- and those who seize upon them are rarer still
He approaches Jordan
We can tell what she's thinking
"Just keep moving
Don't single me out
" Other than that, there is little to be said but "Good luck, gentleman
" (correcting) "Gentlepersons
" Jordan flinches
Now  turn you over to the chief training officer
He has earned six naval commendations, the purple heart, and the Navy Cross for heroism and valor
give you Master Chief John James Urgayle
Taking over,   stands before the class a moment, sizing them up while giving them -- get an eyeload of him, too:  His body is 30 years old, his face 40, his eyes 50
An ageless warrior
Somewhere, the blood of Ulysses runs in this guy's veins
The Chief lifts a bullhorn to deliver his opening salvo -- and it's anything but the kick-ass rant the class is expecting: The sun and moon
the ebb and flow of the Pacific tides
global warming
the very angle of the Earth upon its axis
these are just some of the things  control in my world
Trainees swap private looks
We're fucked
Darth Vader reads poetry
We are so fucked
-    - on boots, crashing through shallow surf, spraying water
We assume this is a routine beach run -- until to reveal
Telephone poles on their shoulder
Working in groups of 10, trainees labor under 300-pound poles
Jordan, six inches shorter than most, looks like Atlas carrying the weight of the world
But she's doing it
Count down
one, two
count down
three, four
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four
An ambulance shadows the class
Perched on the front bumper like an hood-ornament, the Chief keeps working his bullhorn: You may think that you are the brightest, the best, the strongest
assure you, that is a total delusion on your part
It is my job to show you just how weak human beings can truly be
60 percent of you will not finish this course
How do  know
Because that is an historical fact
It's also intimidating shit
Poles down
The earth literally shakes as the phone poles hit the damp sand
Approaching on foot, the Chief loads fresh batteries into his bullhorn
He does it like a man thumbing rounds into a shotgun
Now for the bad new:   always like to get one quitter on the first day
And until  do, the first day does not end
So look around right now -- go on, do it
wonder who it's gonna be
He passes right by Jordan, never meeting her eyes
steps up
He's the Chief's bulldog
Down to BVDs
The guys strip down to boxers
Jordan settles for boxers and jog bra
Now face the Pacific
link arms
and take a stroll
The class wades in
The first wave takes Jordan's breath away:  It's February, and the water is cold
When they move out of instructors' earshot: What is it with the damn phone poles
We sign up for Spec-Recon or Just trying to thin the herd
That's all they want to do right now
Some of the guys are glancing Jordan's way, cashing in on a cheap wet -shirt contest
Jordan covers herself instinctively -- and hates the instinct
Modesty isn't going to get her through this
Man
Doesn't she know it's rude to point
Wow
You see that girl
got eyes, Newberry
One night
Just one night in my room, she'd forget all about playin' commando
Tone that shit down, Slutnik
You heard with they said
Out of the water
The class breaks for the beach
Now make like sugar cookies and roll in the sand for me
The trainees hit their bellies and roll
Indeed, they look like sugar cookies
Collect those poles, gentlemen
Still a lotta beachfront you haven't seen
Groaning, the trainees grab poles
Jordan's pole, wet slips from their collective grasp
And bangs Stamm's ankle
He  through his teeth
How bad
Stamm
We better get a medic over -- No, goddamnit
No
Up
Up
Up
Up
Stamm swallows the pain
Poles go back on shoulders
Looking like drunk centipedes, the class staggers off down the beach
-    - Wallowing in mud, the class does belly-busters, atomic sit-ups -- and the sadistic reverse push-up, where trainees lie of their backs, place hands under shoulder blades and push their crotches skyward
Pain is your friend
You ally
It will keep you awake in times of emergency
it will tell you when you are seriously injured
it will keep you angry and remind you to finish the job and get the hell home
But you know the best thing about pain
No, sir
It lets you know that you aren't dead yet
Instructors roam,  , kicking students into proper position
Jordan struggles with the reverses
Go regulation if you can't do the reverses, 'Neil
She looks around
lot of the guys are having trouble with the reverses, not just her
Thank you, sir
But  like these just fine
Not doin' them very fine, 'Neil
'll try anyway, sir
You'll try what we tell you to try, 'Neil
Go regulation
She switches to standard push-ups, her face disappearing into the ooze with every downstroke
Soon the Chief's boots slosh into
He's still looking for his human sacrifice
Who's it gonna be
just wonder, who is it gonna be
-    - On your belly
on your back
on your feet
on your belly
on your back
on your feet
Whistle-drills
Silhouetted against a lowering sun, the students flop around like docked fish
-    - Blondell is ending her shift
She shoulders a purse and pauses at a window, seeing
The trainees shuffling into formation like the living dead
Jordan is still among them
-    - You have noticed a ship's bell hanging at the west side of this courtyard
If, at any time, you feel you cannot continue with your training -- that bell is your salvation
Strike it three times, and the ordeal is over
Nervous eyes flick to the bell
Yes, it is a long walk
So 'll make it as easy as  can
He turns his back to the class
Now you don't have to watch me watching you break rank
Because know someone here wants to do it
their faces
There isn't one trainee here who hasn't thought about it
Including Jordan
Now  know what you're thinking
(low) 'm thinkin' we could jump him right now
"Can  really take 15 weeks of this bubonic asshole
"  If you don't know the answer to that question, the answer is "No, you cannot
"  And that is another historical fact
So do it
Admit you don't have what it takes
admit you are out of your depth -- or we're all heading back to the beach right now
(waiting a beat) Instructors
Time hack
Following the Chief's lead, Instructors lift their dive watches
Six
five
four
three
two
one
(to class) The time is now 12-hundred
The sun is shining brightly
Plenty of daylight left for another phone-pole run
behind him
The groans give way to the breaking rank
-    - ' :  Of a lone figure crossing to the bell
-    - of Miller, Slutnik, Wickwire, turning to watch someone cross the grinder
At least we know who it isn't
on the Chief as the
He turns around to find
Stamm at the bell
For the first time, the Chief looks dead-bang at Jordan
Was he expecting her
Leave your helmet there, Stamm
Back to the barracks
Stamm drops his helmet and limps away
The rest of you should remember one thing
The only easy day was today
Lieutenant Wickwire
Turning it over to you
Cuh-lass, face right
They march off
-    - Dead-ass tired, Jordan slides her tray down the line, piling on food that means nothing more than raw calories
She heads for
table of trainees, one spot open
Seeing her coming, the guys shift position
Suddenly the table is full
Better look elsewhere, 'Neil
Jordan glares
None of them meet her eyes
She wheels around -- and now all eyes are on her, watching her ass walk away
Slutnik, the walking sperm bank
Half a night, Lord, just gimme half a night to set her straight
Jordan tries another table
This one, too, becomes abruptly full
As Jordan leaves,  on Miller
He's a human eclipse -- six-three, 220, the perfect commando physique
Instructors wish they could clone him
Average woman is 25 percent body fat
That's one-quarter fat, man
Think about that
Nice distribution, though
No way does she makes this program
No way
After wandering the mess hall like a homeless person, Jordan finds refuge at a table with female mess stewards
They look at her with blank faces
No understanding
No compassion
-    - Jordan walks in a bathrobe, toweling her hair dry
She fishes for keys at her door
It's not so much that they hate you
Jordan looks
Someone is sitting on an outdoor table, smoking
He leans into the light so she can see his face
It's Wickwire, the mid-30s lieutenant who doubles as class officer
He's dangerously handsome
They're more afraid of you
Well, now  feel so much better
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide
Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all
To your face, anyway
Whose orders were those
It was made clear
(getting up) Anyway, stay ballsy
First week's hell, then it levels out
Until training, anyway
That's hell-and-a-half
And how do you know that
Made it to Week 10 last time
didn't know they let you try again
Especially at your age
You're kind of a surprise yourself
faint grin from Wickwire before he shadows back across the courtyard that separates the two
buildings
Back across no-man's land
'
-    - Two beds
Matching lockers
desk, a chair, a mirror
All overwhelmingly dull
Jordan drops the robe off her shoulders to take inventory of her body
Both sides of her neck are bruised from the phone-pole run
Her back and thighs are sand-burned
Mirror cuts abound
She's already a mess
Jordan uncaps some cologne
It's a vestige of her old life she's not going to surrender
She sniffs
Savors
Dabs
Looks back in the mirror
And breaks out laughing
It's like dropping a rose in a cesspool
-  - stands near a car parked just outside the base
He's peering through a 600mm lens
' :   through cyclone fencing
past the sand dunes
and finding green-clad trainees gathered at an obstacle course
-    - An explosion of sand:  England and Wickwire belly-flop into a sand pit and speed-crawl under barbed wire
Clear, they gain their feet and blitz toward
The rolling logs
They balance-beam their way to
The rope climb
Racing to the top, they reach a platform and fling themselves down onto
The high poles
They land awkwardly, losing their wind and their grip, tumbling into the sand pit below before
Racing for the finish
The Chief thumbs a stopwatch
England, 88 seconds
You're good to go for the slide-for-life
Wickwire, roll back till you get south of 90
Fuck
Yes sir
Who'd you kiss to get back in here, anyway
Wickwire dusts off and starts back for
The starting line
Stepping up next is Cortez, the human fighting cock
Jordan lines up beside him and psyches up for the first obstacle -- and eight-foot sheer wall
Hang on, here
He grabs something off a truck and positions it at the base of the wall
It's a little two-step platform
,  from the guys
Cortez can barely contain his disgust
Aw, what is this
(mortified) Sir
Don't have to use it, 'Neil, but it's gotta go out
(calling out) Five
four
three
can make this wall without -- two
one
Cortez blurs away
Jordan starts a step late
Cortez takes the wall clean
Eschewing the two-step, Jordan jumps right over it -- but jumps too far out because of it
She takes the wall awkwardly
the others as they break rank to follow, eager to see Cortez blow her off the course
Lesgo, Cortez, , ,
Cortez belly-flops into the sand pit -- and snags going under the barbed wire
Shit of a saint
Catching up, Jordan clears the wire without a hitch and leads going into
The rolling logs
They both tight-rope across nimbly and bound on toward
Rope climb
Jordan starts up at a decent clip -- but Cortez comes from behind like a chimp on white sugar, doubling her speed
Take her, take her here, Cortez
lookit that monkey-man go
hoo- yah, hoo-yah
Cortez reaches the top platform
Now he's faced with
The high poles
He's seen others land sideways and pay the price
Trying another way, Cortez takes a flying leap
And  down with legs astraddle
He tried to cushion the landing with his hands -- and failed magnificently
His balls took the brunt
Jordan  down beside him with legs astraddle -- and shoots Cortez a "Hey, no problem" look
She rolls off the poles
And drops to the pit below
Cortez lands right behind
Now it's a flat-out sprint for
The finish line
He takes her at the tape
Cortez, 93 seconds
'Neil, 94
Cortez, do a little rescue-recovery on your gonads and line up again
'Neil
move ahead
Heading back to the starting line, Jordan wheels around
Say again, sir
You heard me
Move on
Aw, this is such bullshit
Others  in commiseration
Jordan flushes with anger
Chief, sir,  don't understand why -- Educate her, Pyro
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire
It's called "gender-norming," 'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses
Where you been the last few years
What "all females"
If 'm the only -- Twice now,  have said the words "move on
" He turns his back, leaving no possibility of discussion
Jordan stares after
Can't live with them, can't kill them
What's the point
Somebody throw a tent over this circus
(low to Jordan) Just let it go
If it's in your favor, just shut the hell up and take it
-    - Dressed in bathrobe, Jordan reaches her door
She pauses to check
The outdoor table
No visitors tonight
'
-    - Jordan pushes inside -- and stops when she sees the little two-step platform
That awful crutch
Someone has put it beside her bed
Jordan wheels around to check
-    - The men' building
Slutnik and a few others loiter on a balcony, mirroring her stare
- Hastily dressed, Jordan marches across the base
Her march turns into an angry run as she cuts through parking lots
jumps hedges
and finally reaches
'  -    - An on-base bungalow
Jordan bangs on the front door until the
' scowling face appears
Pardon the hour, sir
But you told me to come to you immediately if felt  was being mistreated in any way
Didn't take long
He waves her inside
'  -    - All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, 'll have the file an action first thing in the morning
(waits) name
It's you, sir
And it started the day  came here
(jolted) Oh, really
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment
It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met
Because  was civil, now you're complaining
can't afford civility, sir
How am  supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider
Even if  make it under these rules,  still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but
" mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base
Did you just have a brain-fart
Pardon
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander
If so, regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and  resent it when people fart inside my home
think you've resented me from the start, sir
Now, finally, her opponent steps into the ring
And he's a bare-knuckle brawler
(building) What  resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment
What  resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men
the day-care center  have to build where an officer's lounge used to be
and the /  have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears
(drawing close) But most of all, lieutenant, resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which  will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities
No, sir
No, sir,
The shape doesn't bother me
It's just that goddamn rotten stench
dangerous beat -- before the
disengages
Well
'Least now we're talking the same language
(a beat) So one standard
Is that what you're after
Same rules for everyone, sir
Straight up
Across the board, sir
And if you just happen to wash out, won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator
And please note did not identify any one in particular
Wouldn't dream of it, sir
deciding beat
Then good night
So 'll get a fair shot
You'll get everything you want, 'Neil
Let's see if you want what you're gonna get
-    - Jordan gets her hair cut to regulation length
It's over in seconds
-    - Jordan slaps down old room keys and new orders
Blondell scans the paperwork with deepening concern
This some kind of joke
'
-    - Jordan tosses her belongings into a laundry bag
She slings the bag over her shoulder, boots aside the hated two-step on her way out
-    - marches across the no-man's land
-    - and bangs open a door
Slutnik sits up on his bed
Well, who the shit you think you are
Comin' in here like that
Your new roommate
Slutnik's face curdles
Jordan dumps her bag on an open bunk and starts unpacking
Anybody usin' these drawers here
Hey, hey,
No possibility
You can't stay in here
You can't sleep right next to me
Funny, the
says  can
She slaps orders on his chest, continues to unpack
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here
'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there
That your desk
'll take this one
(whirling on him) Listen, Sex Ape
'm here to stay
And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out
End of file
Slutnik stalks out
Jordan fires a look at the innocent bystander here, McCool
He was studying at his desk when the fireworks began
What about you, McCool
Any problem with the room assignment
McCool -- an imperturbable black lieutenant -- just goes back to his manuals
"It's not a job -- it's an adventure
" -    - on flares igniting overhead
the flares as they parachute down into the surf to illuminate
The class, standing in one long line, arms linked
As black waves knock out their legs, we're reminded of show girls kicking their way through some macabre review
-    - Firing flare guns and working their bullhorns: 58 degrees this morning
That's not a bad water temp, really -- if you're standing where we are
Slurred speech, lack of proper motor control, short-term amnesia -- all early signs of hypothermia
Advanced hypothermia is easy to detect in a classmate
He'll look like he's dead
Body heat
In situations of extreme cold, you can always count on body heat to keep you alive -- and  do not mean your own
We will break you of the cultural barriers that dictate you should not invade another man's space
Are any of you in a situation of extreme cold right now
trainees and instructors: Yes, sir
Then why aren't you all over the man next to you
The class pivots 90 degrees and starts to close rank
Behind Jordan, Montgomery (a
k
a
"Flea") hesitates: He's a bantam-weight from Georgia, his manners bred into the bone
He just can't find a delicate way to grab Jordan without mounting her
Just do it, okay
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough
want nuts to butts
Come on, Montgomery
Flea
'Neil
Why is there a break in that line
Finally Jordan grabs Flea by the neck, pushes him ahead and mounts him
The class closes down into a long human snake
(in his ear) Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"
It's really "
Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea
"  For short, ma'am
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size
No, ma'am
Well, Flea,  appreciate the respect you just showed me
But  don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway
It's just gonna hurt us both, okay
'll work on it, ma'am
Do that
(to the Chief) Time
Check your watch, Pyro
Seems fast
the grim, blue-lipped faces in the water
Jordan feels Flea starting to shake
Badly
Hey
You okay, Flea
'Snot me
It's him
Two bodies ahead, it's the big bruiser, Miller, who's shuddering
Jordan feels him shaking through Flea
Jesus, my hands
they aren't workin' right
How long i'zis for
'Sposed to be 20-minute intervals, no more
Swear each time's gettin' longer
This where you bailed last time, Wick
Huh-uh -- but wasn't middla February last time, either
How you doin', Miller
Miller
No answer
Bad sign
On shore: 22 minutes
Ignoring, the Chief lifts his bullhorn: Remember, all this is completely voluntary
For any of you who don't want to continue, Instructor Johns is now serving coffee and danish at the ambulance
portable light comes on
Indeed, an instructor is setting up coffee service
Any takers
He's the fuckin' Antichrist
Wick
They really got donuts over there
Or just some'a last night's dinner rolls
Look like donuts to me
(in disbelief) What're you guys doing
Huh
Just askin' What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist
How dumb you gotta be
That's exactly what they -- Suddenly the line rips apart
It's Miller, breaking for shore
Soon the dyke is bursting everywhere:  Four others break rank, following Miller's lead
The deserters stagger onto the beach
close in quick, draping them with blankets, shining flashlights in their faces, asking brain-check question
Tell me what day this is
look at me now
what city are you from, sailor
here, look right here
medic nods to the Chief
No hypothermia
Not yet
You want another minute to think about this
Huh
(no response; to Miller directly) Do any of you want to reconsider
Avoiding his eyes, Miller wags his head
Johnson
Get 'em out of my scan
It's a death sentence
As the quitters slouch for the coffee truck
By my watch
which, of course appears to be broken
they've been in 27 minutes without the benefit of protective gear
on the Chief
Scanning the remaining trainees
Thinking about holding out out for one more
on Jordan
Knowing who he's waiting for
Wondering if she can outlast him
(into bullhorn) Everybody out
With a  , the trainees stampede ashore, grabbing blankets, trading body-bumps and high-fives
Jordan gets swept up in the esprit:  They've conquered a common enemy
But when she tries to get high-fived
The guys turn their backs
It's a cold rebuff, worse then any water
on Jordan
Shivering
Watching the guys drift away
Hating them
Hey
Way to gut it out
Thanks, Wick
'  -    - The instructors are shuffling muster lists, reorganizing the class
, the   again and again
(shaking head) Miller
Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium
Really didn't expect to lose him
Every class has its surprises, Pyro
This one'll be no different
-    - Blondell crosses the grinder with another female ensign, tall and striking
Passing the bell, Blondell checks on
The helmets lined up beneath
dozen already
An
-- then, led by Wickwire, trainees double-time into the grinder, uniforms drenched from a beach run
Among them, still, is Jordan
It brings a Mona Lisa smile to Blondell's face
Change those clothes, be back here in six minutes
And  am timing you
The class scatters
Slutnik hits the brakes when he sees Blondell and her friend
Jesus Christ
And  only got three minutes apiece
(jerking him away) Barkin' up the wrong dress, Slutnik
You ain't their type
Overhearing, Jordan snaps a look at Blondell, only now realizing
Their eyes meet
'Neil
What're you gawking at
'  -    - (reading newspaper) "
last week at Coronado
The woman, identity unknown, is believed to be the first female candidate for the elite Special Reconnaissance program
Her presence could signal a shift in the Navy's long-standing policy that excludes women from combat positions

It's the San Diego Tribune
Under the headline "

(calling
) 'm asking again
Where is she
Inbound now, sir
Had to pull her out of the dive bell

And a sociologist from
San Diego called, wanted to know if she could examine the interaction between "
Jane" and the men
" sociol
"  Kill the interviews

Just kill 'em before this whole thing gets outta con -- Senator DeHaven calling, sir
The
gets an instant headache
-
- (
) Base Commander Turrentine speaking
In the Senate barber shop, DeHaven is having her hair colored
She holds a fax of the Tribune article in one hand, a cell phone in the other
(hitting like a Scud) Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill
These were supposed to have been discreet test cases -- : Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses -- -- and now  got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what  know about this "
Jane" thing
-- nothing  can do about it unless you're suggesting  infringe on their civil liberties -- which 'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution
Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee
mean, 'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts
'  -    - The
double-takes as Jordan enters:  She's sun-burned, wind-burned, sand-burned, chapped and chaffed, bloody and soggy
Her dive suit leaks onto the floor
See me, sir
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant
He tosses her the paper
Jordan scans the article as DeHaven continues over speakerphone: Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r
p
m
From this point forward,  want all press matters coordinated via my office
'll be god-damned if 'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one
Him or the President
(aside to beautician) This my shade
"Midnight Mahogany"
'Cuz 'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here
Your prerogative, Senator
Awright
How's our girl doin', anyway
Standing right here in my office
Jordan, dear
How are they treating you
(catching
's eyes) Can't complain, ma'am
Hmmm
Maybe 'll ask when  see you in person
Uh, ma'am
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If  were a gambler, 'd say Dennis 'Conner's days are numbered
But they're in San Diego, so  thought 'd take a quick promenade of the base
Deafening silence
We aren't sure who dreads the idea more -- the
or Jordan
Uh,
security arrangements generally take some time, Senator
"Security"
What the hell you talkin' about
Your base isn't secure
Of course, but there's more -- Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch
My office will follow up with details
Jumping off, now
Phone goes dead
The
gives Jordan a look one might reserve for a lab technician who inadvertently unleashed Ebola upon the world
Sir,  want you to know that  had nothing to do with any of this
Not this article, not -- "We'll all have lunch
"  Good idea
Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a Sir
Secretary Hayes calling
The
's headache becomes a migraine
(backing out) Permission to leave, sir
Permission to evaporate, 'Neil
-
- DeHaven hands the phone to her aide
He's set up a portable office in the next barber chair
Think  overplayed it
' Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing
They'll never know whose leak it is
-    - 150-pound rubber boats ("Zodiacs") litter the beach
The class is breaking down into six-man crews
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise
Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer
Follow his orders to your death
Get it up
Crew Five finds their Zodiac, hoists it onto their heads
Boat Six -- England, 'Neil, McCool, Montgomery, Cortez, and Slutnik
Lieutenant England is your senior officer
Jordan rolls her eyes:  At least two of the guys in her crew are blue-ribbon misogynists
Cortez and Slutnik don't like it any better
Ah, c'mon
Motherachrist
Me
Again
(looking up) Somebody got a problem with the muster
Fine by me, sir
No problem, sir
Full of joy here, sir
Exchanging looks across their Zodiac, Jordan and her new crewmates lift the boat overhead
Boat Seven
-    - With  , 12 boat crews charge into the teeth of the
Some lose their boat to the first wave; others clear the surf and scramble aboard
(into bullhorn) First crew to finish gets hot food and warm racks for the night
Rest of you are digging hide-sites and eating earthworms tonight
- Beyond the breakers, the Zodiacs run parallel to shore, crews paddling furiously, racing the wind, the sun, the other crews
Instructors shadow in power boats, stopwatches running
-  - McCool Don't wanna be pickin' no sandcrabs outta my ass tonight
So shutup and stroke, McCool
Hoo-yah
Hoo-yah
Flea checks on Jordan
She paddles hard, really digging in
Flea grins:  On some level, he has to admire this women
Jordan catches the grin, gives one back
Ahead, buoys mark the finish line
And just when it seems victory is at hand
Something hits Boat Six
Suddenly it's losing air
Jordan torques around to see
The Chief on a nearby boat, speargun in hand
Your boat just hit razor coral
What do you do now
Patch and pump
'mon
Whose ass is on the kit
say keep paddlin'
We're almost -- Forget it, McCool
Pri One is to save the boat, not win a race
So let's get on it
They flail to save their sinking boat
Boat Five noses past, stealing the lead
Wickwire tosses Jordan a passing look
"Sorry, but
" -    - Up and down the dunes, crews are digging "hide-sites" -- six-man holes that will be their homes tonight
Cortez and Slutnik are uprooting shrubs, collecting camouflage material
Four years  petition to get into this program
Four years
Finally get here, and now it's co-ed
Such bullshit
Now 'm gettin' hammered just 'cuz she's on our crew
Least you don't have to sleep with her every goddamn night
Tellin' you, 'd rather be the last class with balls than the first one with chicks
: -    - Jordan and Flea fill sand bags to shore up the walls of their hide-site
England and McCool shovel back to back
Had a grandaddy who wanted to be a Navy man
Wanted to fire them big guns on a big-ass battleship
But Navy said to him, "Oh, no
You can only do one thing on a battleship
" "Well what's that
" grandaddy said
"Cook," they said
Now this ain't 100 years ago -- 'm talkin' United States Navy, middla World War
And you know the reason they gave him
You know why they tol' my grandaddy he couldn't fight for his country
He talked too much
"Negroes can't see at night
Bad night vision
" You're kiddin' me
Jordan jumps in the hole, ready to take over shoveling
See, you just the new nigger on the block, 'Neil
That's all
And maybe you moved in too early
He climbs out
on Jordan, looking off down the dunes, seeing the other crews covering up and going underground for the night
How the hell did she wind up here
So far from home
- Jeep speeds along the public highway, carrying the
back to base
When the Jeep tops a rise: What in God's name
Ahead, a half-dozen news crews are camped on the shoulder
All cameras are trained on the base

topcoat draped on a chair-back
on a television
() is denying that it is considering changing its long-held policy of exclusion -- but it isn't denying the presence of at least one female in a heretofore all-male program
Dubbed "
Jane" by the media, this woman is now undergoing commando training at the Special Warfare Command Center in San Diego
Half-shaven, Royce leans out of the bathroom in time to catch
Footage from Coronado:   woman in Navy greens is on a beach run, loaded down with backpack and -16
The ,   with the indelible image that will be used over and over in coming weeks:  Woman cradling rifle
Madonna for the 21st century
Goddamn
My poster girl
() Senator DeHaven's office still has not released the identity of the woman, but DeHaven is confirming that "
Jane" has outlasted many of her male counter-parts in the program, said to be one of the most grueling anywhere
Joining us now on "Washington Tonight" for the feminist perspective is Gloria Allred, live from -- Royce snaps it off
He can't take anymore
-  -
- Beneath the coffered ceiling of a great Beau-Art hall, one of Washington's power-tribes is celebrating
We find gowned women, tuxedoed men, gold-braided naval officers, a , and
Secretary Hayes, newly confirmed
He beams as he dances with his wife
Compliments and friendly barbs come from all directions: (
) Congratulations, Mr
Secretary
Say hello to the President for me
Maybe now you can change that carpet in your office, Teddy
So what was the deal you made with DeHaven
Or was it the Devil
Always get them confused
Didn't you hear
Effective immediately, all navy vessels can no longer be referred to as "she
" of laughter
: -  -
- Royce,  his way through the crowd, fixating on the bar, leading his -- winner by the hand
Conversations drift into earshot: #1 women are child-bearers
Life- givers
Now we're going to make them killers
#2 just don't have the upper-body strength
#3 How strong do you need to be to launch a rocket
To push a button or pull a trigger
Royce can't get away from it
-- Are we going to dance
Not right now
Just yards from the bar, a Pentagon - snags Royce's elbow
- Commander Royce
How's life across the river
Little slow, sir
When's the Pentagon going to send me a good crisis
- 'll check my out-basket in the morning
Say, do you know
The -Ringer turns to make introductions -- but finds his embroiled in the topic du jour: #1 but men have trained as athletes for 5,000 years
Women have been at it for, what, couple of decades
Do we really know the limits of their strength
#2 Or their endurance
You know, 30 years ago, women marathoners were 90 minutes off the pace of the men
Now, the women's time is probably only 20 minutes off
#1 Try 15
#3 But what do female soldiers really contribute
mean, why is this "
Jane" there instead of a man
Eyes drift to Royce, inviting him into the fray
(to dial-a-date) You wait right here
'll get the drinks
- -  - Heading upstairs with an iceless rum
Royce finds a calm and secluded place to get drunk in peace and quiet
#1 Take my word for it
It's just not going to happen
Not now, not anytime soon
#2 You're guaranteeing that
Royce frowns:  He thought he was alone
He tracks the voices to a forced-air vent beside the chaise
#1 have it on unorthodox but reliable authority that combat positions will remain off-limits
Despite what's happening with our Babe in Boyland
Alarms go off in Royce's head
He moves quickly to a railing, looks down
' :  Of two naval officers on the floor below
They stand beside a matching vent
It's impossible to see faces from this angle -- but one man has a distinct bald spot
( #1) Well, isn't that what these test cases are supposed to decide
(thinking) Unless, of course, you're suggesting that "
Jane" is on her way to becoming "Jane Doe"
( #2) All 'm saying is that we won't be integrating -- despite the rhetoric coming off Capitol Hill, despite what's happening in Coronado
And you did not hear it from me
( #1) Hear what
conspiratorial handshake
The men split up
-  -
- Royce flashes down the stairs
Hitting main floor, he looks around and then bumps into
-- There you are
Can we please dance now
Over her shoulder, Royce spies Bald Spot heading for the cloak room
Royce commandeers the nearest
Lieutenant
Yes sir
Take a dance
-  -
- Royce bobs and weaves through the crowd, trying to keep sight of
Bald Spot
Pushing through the exit doors
Only steps behind, Royce shoulders through the doors
-  -
- And blasts outside, intending to shake some answers out of Bald Spot
But here Royce finds
dozen naval officers waiting for their cars
All of them now wear caps
Royce tries to check faces of the quickly departing men
but it could have been anyone
: - high-speed transport ("Seafox") is
Lashed to one side is a rubber life boat
-  - Crew Six
Stand by
Flea
'Cool
'Neil
Cortez
Slutnik
In that order
Five- second intervals
Let's go
England's crew lines up for cast-and-recover drills:  One by one, they speed-roll off the transport
and drop into the life boat
After quickly stabilizing, they roll off the life boat
and disappear underwater like human bullets
England is last to cast off
- Jordan resurfaces
Treading water, she scans for
Seafox
It makes a hard turn in the water and starts back
The recovery rig -- a big flexible loop -- is lowered into position
Still hauling ass, Seafox picks up the trainees in reverse order -- England, Slutnik, Cortez
They each stab an arm through the passing loop
-  - and vault back aboard, slick as hell
Hoo-yah
Better'n sex in a car crash
But now they're bearing down fast on
- Jordan
She braces as best she can
As past, she stabs for the loop
And snags it with her hand
But only her hand
Hanging on grimly, Jordan drags face down in torrential water
Her mouth gropes for clean air but can't find it
If she doesn't let go soon, she'll drown
-  - At the stern, the Chief spots Jordan bobbing up in the boat's wake
(to pilot) Next recovery
Keep goin', keep goin'
-    - up water, Jordan watches Seafox speed on toward McCool and Flea
They make textbook recoveries
She's the only one who couldn't cut it
'  -    - Head hung, Jordan showers alone
(
) You know, the Israelis
Jordan recoils
Christ, how long has he been there
Just standing in the doorway
they tried women in the 1967 War
Female soldiers
With forced calm, Jordan squeaks off the water and finds a towel
Permission to get dressed, sir
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs
Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives
They don't use women anymore
(moving closer) Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross
May  ask what you got it for
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia
see
So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero
But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft
Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant
She can't say yes
She wants to but can't
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion
Men fight better without women around
And that is an historical fact
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir
So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead
She shoulders past
The Chief gives her a few steps before dropping his bomb: England went out with a stress fracture
That puts you in charge, lieutenant
(off-balance) McCool's that same rank
We're both j
g
's
You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer
(passing her on his way out) Remember
There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders
-    - Trainees are getting familiar with -60 machine guns, firing   at downfield targets
(pissed) No operational experience, and now she's callin' the shots
Unbelievable
Suppose she'll wanna eat with us now
Jordan overhears them
She steps up to an open slot -- and proceeds to   with her -60, tracer rounds blazing
Her target vaporized, she keeps madly, taking out Slutnik's target
then Cortez's
then
'Neil
'Neil
'
Finally she stops
One burst, one body, 'Neil
What the fuck you trying to do
Spell your name
(to class) You are not infantry
Your firepower is limited
Excessive killing only risks compromise
Reloading, Jordan tosses a look at Slutnik and Cortez
Ain't nobody bitchin' now
-    - (
) training coming up
Eating at a table with other women, Jordan turns to see Blondell setting down her tray
They take you away to San Clemente Island
Half the guys quit when they come back
Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half
That's what  hear
Can  ask you somethin', lieutenant
How come you're doing this
mean, we're kinda curious
Who's "we"
Just some of the women
-    - Walking across the base: don't know if there's any single reason
But my father was Navy
And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den
It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee,  wish  were a man
'd join the Navy
"  Was maybe 10 years old when  first saw it, and even then it felt wrong
Made me mad
And  don't think a month has gone by that  haven't thought about that poster
"Gee,  wish  were a man
" 've been accused of that wish
The woman  saw you with
Just a friend
We have friends, too, you know
But are there
mean, how many
More than you'd guess
It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches
If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising
They laugh
Sounds funny now, but it's really not
We have to be careful
The Navy still knows how to put on a witch-hunt
Reaching the quarterdeck, they scan a message board
Jordan finds a half-dozen phone slips for her
Royce
- (into phone) 've been trying you for five days
Don't they give you messages
(
) It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce
Much less keep up with my phone life
How hard they making it on you
-    - Jordan sighs and slumps against the phone kiosk
Where to start
(
) That bad
feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men
But hey, what'd  expect
Jordan and Royce: Well, not this
was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago
Got some fresh stuff -- about you
You may be in a hostile camp
think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn
Me
Why me
Don't you know
How they're talking about you
saw an article
can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about "
Jane
"  You're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster
Jordan's face sours with an errant thought
So why are you telling me this
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan
think someone's gunning for you
You know, Royce,  got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too
'm only trying to warn you in case -- Well, let me warm you:  'm going though with this
The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish
So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay
That's not what  want, Jordan mean
it is and it isn't
Still can't make up your mind, huh
Gotta go, Royce
Jordan
You watch your ass
Sure
'll join the crowd
-    - on its pad
Crew Six approaches, garbed in black wetsuits, loaded down with weapons and rucksacks
Jordan is at the lead
- The helo is airborne
Sitting on rucksacks, trainees slather their faces with green camouflage paint
Over the : Infiltrate
establish your hide- site
record any movement of troops, vehicles, patrols -- any activity inside your scan
If you are compromised, you have two options
Newberry
Newberry is the new sixth man
He's young enough to still have a hyperactive Adam's apple
Evasive maneuvers or radio for emergency extraction, sir
If you are extracting, be damn sure to follow procedures you have learned in your classroom training
helo cannot extract you from a wooded area
You must bring it down in a clearing
What's the minimum clearance for an -60 Black Hawk, McCool
32 feet, six inches, sir
You will be penalized for early extraction, but you will be penalized more for capture -- trust me, far more
Survival
Evasion
Rescue
Evacuation
Welcome to - The helo swoops low over the water, moon silhouetting
Black figures helo-cast into the ocean
- Last out, Jordan is poised to follow when
Lieutenant
Don't back down
Jordan looks back
"What the hell does that mean
" Offering no elaboration, Pyro signals "
"  Jordan springs clear
- and knifes into black water
The   away
An inky stillness overtakes the world
Jordan activates a red-light beacon, sweeps it around, revealing her position to
Her crew
Five black faces regroup around her
Feel right at home, McCool
They secure weapons atop their waterproof rucksacks
Jordan checks a heat-bearing compass
(nodding direction) South-southeast
And  don't want to hear another word till we're underground
Pushing rucksacks ahead of them, they start swimming towards
moonlit shoreline
Half-mile ahead
-    - Jordan's crew reaches shallow water
They deflate their vests and rucksacks
Jordan trades her face mask for night-vision goggles
- :  Sweeping the rocks
Nothing at first
Then two "hostiles" appear, patrolling the rocks
Jordan motions "down
"  Six faces sink from sight
-/ :  Of the "hostile" patrol moving on
They resurface
On Jordan's cue, the crew sheds flippers and begins scaling rocks
They've made landfall
-  -    - :  Racing the coming sun, Jordan's crew builds their hide-site
digging feverishly
filling sand bags
telescoping open a roof pole, fanning out spars
laying canvas roof panels into place
camouflaging the panels
sprinkling sanitizing powder around the perimeter to ward off animals
snake slithering across the ground
As it nears the hide-site
knife whacks its head off
Slutnik picks up the carcass, kicks dirt over the severed head
No trace
- the island, awash in morning light
Woodlands lie distant
road is the only man-made feature -- until in , we find a spotting scope poking from the ground
- -    - :  Of the road
Fast-attack vehicles approach
(peering into scope) Got two FAVs moving south make
four banditos aboard, carrying
-60 machine guns
Jordan    into a digital tape-recorder, adds the time
Newberry, get a photo
South
Entering my scan now
West
Clear
North
Clear
:  Of the FAVs disappearing down the road
FAVs clear
Everyone relaxes -- as much as six people can in a hole five feet-wide
McCool opens up MREs (Meals Ready to Eat) Slutnik guts his snake
You mind
'm trying to eat here
So am
Cortez finishes pissing into a tin pot
He transfers the waste to a zip-lock baggy, offers the pot
Anyone
He looks at Jordan
She eyes the pot, tempted and nettled at the same time
Don't wanna evacuate 'cuz someone came down with uric poisoning, el- tee
Abruptly Jordan unzips, drops her pants, sticks the pot under her
It raises eyebrows:  It's a far cry from when she was covering up in cold water
Didn't even bitch about the seat, did
- :  As a lone figure appears on foot
- -    - What the
Got an unknown here
100 yards north-northeast
They pile up at McCool's scope
Jordan bulls her way through
:  It's a women
Dressed in civilian clothes, she collects firewood
And she's coming this way
She part of the training
don't know
"She
"  There's another one
McCool takes a second look
:  Of the women drawing closer
closer
and finally looking dead-bang at us
She does an about-face and walks away
Quickly
Shit
Think we're had
Smoke her
ain't gonna shoot her
Only blanks
Lemme do it
(pushing him away) Hey
Ain't your call, man
He looks to Jordan
Pri One is to protect the mission
If she represents a real threat, we have to do it
Pleased, Cortez slips his rifle under a roof panel
(to McCool) But did she see us
Do you know for a fact that we are compromised
McCool doesn't
Not for sure
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area
Now how smart is that
(a beat) Mighta been civilian
They got regular peeps on this island, don't they
-    - The asphalt road shimmers with midday heat
Suddenly a over a rise
- -    - :  Of the troop carrier braking hard
"Hostiles" spill out the rear -- and fan out all around us
(at scope) Banditos on the east perimeter
150 yards
Shit, she was part of it
Fuck me
What's the word, el-tee
We're about one minute from a major take- down here
on Jordan, heart skipping
Did she really make the wrong call
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers
Drop everything but weapons and the radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site
Ready
Sure
Now she wants to shoot
- They come out of the hide-site like atomic locusts, splintering into three groups and laying down as they blitz for
The woodlands
"Hostiles"  and pursue
Flea is running flat out when the ground vanishes beneath him
He goes down like a doped race horse
Suddenly exposed, another crew scrambles into daylight:  Flea ran right over their hide-site
Slutnik yanks Flea out, gets him back on his feet
-    - Breathing like asthmatics, Jordan's crew regroups at the link-up site just inside the woods
Flea comes in hobbling
Badly
This ain't workin' right
What's our go-to-shit plan, 'Neil
This ain't even workin' wrong
beat as Jordan deliberates
She doesn't want to go out like this
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee
Heard some bad things
Fuck
(snatching the radio) Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction
Stand by for a  fix
- As a helo pirouettes in midair
-    - Jordan's crew lopes through the woods, searching for a place to bring the helo down
Right on their heels
--, illumination and flare
This may not be war, but it'll do until the real thing comes along
- ' :  Buzzing treetops, searching
-    - On the run: 32 feet, six inches
'm lookin', 'm lookin'
Finally they break into a clearing
Is it big enough
'Cool
(doesn't care) Smoke it
Jordan chucks a smoke grenade
- ' :  Yellow smoke rises from the woods
We swoop toward it
-    - Whirling smoke, the helo descends
Jordan's crew breaks early, trying to get there the instant it touches down
But before they can
An  crashes through the underbrush, -60s  in the helo's direction
The helo bounds away
Jordan's crew tries to retreat -- but a second  cuts them off
- ' :  Of the action below, growing smaller and smaller:  Jordan's crew
Surrounded
Laying down weapons
Captured
-    - ' :  Brush slapping her face
Crew Six is being hauled through the woods, hands tied back, boots around their necks, pulled along by
The captors
We assume they're instructors in camouflage paint -- but we're moving so fast it's impossible to be sure
-    - camp, disturbingly authentic
dozen trainees are already here, held in pens of bamboo and barbed-wire
Flea, McCool, Slutnik, Cortez, Newberry -- all five get tossed into a pen
Jordan is pulled away
Where are you
Where are you taking her
-
-    - Jordan is thrown to the ground
Her eyes go wide when she sees a row of steel boxes nearby
They're scarcely larger then coffins
-
- Hands push Jordan inside the box
She has to curl up fetally just to fit
How long
(no answer) Please,
The   closed
,
Daylight sheets in through ventilation slats
When her eyes adjust, Jordan finds markings on the lid and walls
Scratchings made with a nail
The memoirs of previous tenants
"Don't know how much  can take"
" little taste of death"
"Save the nail"
(then the real kick- in-the-teeth) "It's been three days now"
-    - As "hostiles" pull Flea out of the pen
-
- wakes Jordan
Are they coming for her
But from the adjacent box
Who is it
(
) (a beat) You know,  had an apartment about this size once
Wick
They got your crew, too
(
) Intagliata was out chasing breakfast
They found his tracks
Well, shit
beat
You really came back for more
Of this
(
) When  was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow
Blame it on my big brother
He was Spec-Recon
And the stories he used to tell
If you got a good one, Wick
Anything to get her mind off this box
Out of this box
Now  Jordan and Wickwire, lying like fraternal twins in their wombs of steel: One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline
This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense
So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone
But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts
They had to kill 'em
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep
But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette
Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted
That's a good story
So the shit you gotta go through
To get from here to there
Brother said it was worth it
Worth the training
worth the divorce
worth anything
He was married
At first
You got anybody, Wick
Not me
You
It hurts to think about it
The Potomac
The gunkhole harbor
Royce
'Neil
How'd you make it last time, Wick
How'd you get through this part
(a beat) Last time  didn't
(jarred) Let's keep talkin', Wick
Just keep talkin' to me
-
- Royce stops for a newspaper
As he pays, something else catches his eye
He picks up
"People" magazine
The grainy image of "
Jane" fills the cover
photo inset, much clearer, shows a beaming DeHaven
"
" (shaking head) Suitable for framing
-
- Got time for a brain-pick
Reading as he walks, a former  spook looks up to find Royce in lockstep
It surprises him:  Not many people here talk to him -- unless they're in trouble is physically unremarkable except for a face that would be right at home on Easter Island:  This is a man who's seen most of the world's ills -- and forgotten none
Subject
'Neil, Jordan
Thought you two were file-closed
You knew about us
Sorry
Thought you knew  knew
-
- Royce and the Spook enter
The vault-like door closes emphatically
Ensuring their privacy: Computer -- no transcription, no com-link, no data-link
In fact
shut-down sequence 0-Niner-0-8, mark
All around, screens go blank, phone lights extinguish
They sit at the conference table
No Computer
No files
Just two guys doing headwork
All right
So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way
The -Ringers
Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe
(agreeing) Congress cuts, military bleeds
But Pentagon's a big place
Let's narrow the sights
The Navy
They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads
What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed
Sabotage born of economics
Wouldn't be a first
But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure
Possibly
Just to spite DeHaven
Hmm
Let's aim higher
Royce blinks
"What's higher
" The White House
If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades
Why
Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man
The first female President
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story
"
Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all
Women
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes
don't know
Seems
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school
The implications go way beyond
Christ,  don't want to see her take a fall
She thinks  do, but
take it this file is still open
(shaping his words) Even tough  don't talk to her every day --  still talk to her every day
Know what  mean
(nodding) Okay, so now work it from the other end
Think about California -- and how things might be handled there
don't
(scoffing) What, someone on base
"mole"
This is what you get for brain- picking an old  spook
but if needed to control the outcome of this test case, that's how 'd do it
man-in-place
Makes everything very controllable
-
- ' :  The box opening
Daylight assaulting us, blowing out our eyes
Disembodied hands pulling us out
-    - Legs hobbled, uniform soiled, Jordan is led past a row of huts
She looks like she got hit by a train -- and got back up
' :  Vision still blown out
But inside the pen, we make out 40 trainees now
One guy wrings out a sock and drinks from it
Jordan moves past huts
spill out as trainees get interrogated
' :  Outside one hut, we see Flea
At least we think it's him:  Strapped face-down to a table, sobbing quietly, he wears a slinky dress and whore's makeup
They broke him -- and it's an ugly, ugly sight
-
- What is your father's name
Jordan seated
Prowling the hut is her interrogator
Her tormentor
Her chaperon through Hell
Simple question, lieutenant
No reason not to answer
What is your father's name
"Dad
" Any brothers
Sisters
Dick, Jane, and Spot
Are you hungry
What's your favorite food
We'll try to get it for you
Green Eggs and Ham
You're not going to get anywhere
You might as well put me in the cage
You are in the cage, 'Neil
Right here, right now
Should  be afraid
Right down to your worthless womb, and 'll tell you why
This is my island
My world
And here  can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world
Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside
If  can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you
Huh
It makes Jordan think -- and yes, it makes her afraid
Continuing the psychological strip-search: Why didn't you shoot the woman, 'Neil
Wasn't deemed a threat
She led us right to you
That's no threat
Jordan rubs her head
So long ago
How did the call come down
Would you have shot if it was a man
No
Yes
mean, depends on -- The others already told me, 'Neil
They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them
Because you went soft on another women -- That's not right
That's what your crew said
Are they lying
Or are you
think you're the liar
'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage
You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew -- We didn't know we were compromised
Firing would only've given away our position
You think we should go easy on women, 'Neil
She stares a beat, knowing it's a loaded question
Do you
No
'm so glad we agree
With stunning ferocity, he grabs her by the neck, pushes her out the door
-    - and throws her onto a table
In the pens, all faces turn to watch
Even instructors stop what they're doing as
The Chief pushes Jordan's head down and jams up behind her
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured
Didn't you even think about that
Sure
Just like your men do
think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect
He flips her over, rips off her belt, starts tearing open her pants
Should  practice bleeding, too, sir
Would that make me a better soldier
He covers her mouth -- her whole face -- with one hand
(to the men) Any of you can stop this
Just give me the location of one more hide- site, and it ends right here
In the pen: (wide-eyed) Someone's trippin' out here
The Chief jerks Jordan up, whirls her around like a dead dance partner, slams her face-first into the pen to give the guys a good look at what's happening to that pretty face
Three crews are still on this island somewhere
Who knows where
The men trade itchy looks
Some do know
Don't do it, don't do it
The Chief throws her down like garbage
Who's gonna tell me
Who's gonna be chivalrous and stop this abuse
What, you want to see her get mauled
Is that it
The men shift anxiously
Should they talk
Behind the Chief, Jordan staggers to her feet
Don't tell him shi -- The Chief whirls, decks her a crescent-kick
Instructors lurch forward instinctively
(waving them back) She's fine
(squatting beside) When  put you down, 'Neil, take the hint and stay down
She licks her bloody teeth -- and considers kicking his balls into his brainpan
Instead she makes a move to get up
He grinds her back down with a crowbar forearm
(for her ears only) am saving your life, 'Neil
You may not know it, but  do
You're an inferior soldier, a bad officer, and  don't want you learning that inconvenient truth when you're stuck in a muddy bomb crater behind enemy lines and don't know how the fuck to get out
You get out now, 'Neil
Seek life elsewhere
And if you can't do it in front of me, do it behind my back
Pinning her down with just his eyes, he rises -- and starts away
Behind him, Jordan struggles to rise
An   races through the men:  They don't want to see this
They don't want to see her crucified
Down
stay down
Hearing, the Chief turns back to see
Jordan wobbling to her feet
Eye-lock
Fuck you and the boat you rode in on
Sir
on the faces of her crewmates -- Slutnik, Cortez, McCool
In their eyes, a new respect
The Chief see it
Instructors see it
Everyone does
(to instructors) We're done here
Beaten, he walks right out of camp
Wordless, instructors open the pens, unlock the boxes
Wickwire rises like a vampire in daylight
But this time he made it
medic tries to help Jordan, but she pushes him away, walking drunkenly for
Flea
She begins wiping the makeup from his face
Make you a deal, Flea
Never tell me how  look -- and 'll never tell you
-    - The Chief chucks gear onto a transport boat approach
He knows it's Pyro
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured
You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before  lost count
've had it
Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean 'm gonna be one
She's a trainee, just like the others
Why are you coming down so hard
She's an officer
There's a higher standard
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback
Of course it is
And 'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost
Maybe mine, maybe yours
oughtta report you
think you probably would -- if you didn't know  was right
-
- As a limo moves -- heads for the Capitol building
'  - DeHaven snags a
Yes
'  (
) (anxious) Did you hear
She made it through
training
Got a call this morning from -- '  (
) Not that
The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws
The phone suddenly weights a ton, DeHaven dumps it on the seat beside her
on her disbelieving face
'  (
) You there
Senator
-  - Hand-carrying a report, Flag Officer #1 hurries down a corridor, pushes through a door
on the door marker: "Secretary of the Navy
" -  - Without telling us they do this
With absolutely no lead time
At his desk, Hayes scans the report with a deepening frown
#1 (to Hayes) Mr
Secretary, if this bill passes
#2 Forget our three-year plan
They're rushing the cadence
We'll be forced to reorganize the Navy from top to bottom -- overnight
What the hell is the President trying to do
Steal DeHaven's thunder
#1 think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly
"
Jane
"  And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week
Huh
The flags squirm
Shaking his head, Hayes moves to a window that offers a stunning view of Arlington National Cemetery
20 years in the Pentagon,  finally rate an office with a window -- and it looks out over the world's largest graveyard
Think it's a sign
-    - The bell
It reflects the moon
to reveal a new batch of helmets -- the casualties of graveyard of its own
-    - Jordan exits with purchases
Her face is still bruised from
With a minute to kill, she peruses a bulletin board casually
But a   leads her eyes to
Wickwire
At a phone kiosk, he hangs up emphatically
He looks flustered when he spots Jordan
Sorry, didn't mean to -- That's okay
Just an ex-girlfriend
And know  remember why
First big night of liberty and no date
You're pathetic, Wickwire
Maybe 'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four
Don't wanna come, do you
(touching bruises) can't go out
Not like this
think you look beautiful
Thanks for lying
But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up
Besides
Catching up, Blondell exits the exchange
Sorry
Forgot  needed oregano and
She sees Wickwire
An awkward beat for them all
Do you, uh, know
Sure, sure
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta
Just, you know, nothing special
Okay
Well
thought 'd ask
Jordan and Blondell head for the parking lot
on Wickwire, looking after them
Thinking it through
-    - Charts are being passed around the room
Every trainee takes one, including Jordan
underwater detonation devices employ mechanical timers, and as such, they are subject to variances due to water temperature
That's why when clearing mines, we always use two timers
The charts now being passed out contain calculations you must memorize before
fills the classroom doorway
Frowning, Johns joins the cop for a private discussion
'Neil
Sir
You're wanted at the
's
'   -    - Jordan enters
The yeoman's desk is unattended
Noticing the
's door open, Jordan peers inside to find
Blondell
She looks scared out of her mind
Before she and Jordan can speak, the yeoman materializes
This way, lieutenant
They're expecting you
'  -    - See me, sir
The
and
are both here
(uncomfortable) don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so  won't try
Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety
Specifically, that you were
(reading) "
seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming
" (a beat,laughing in relief) Sir, if someone is suggesting that 'm a lesbian, they're wrong
The
's face remains grim
He isn't relieved
They're very wrong
And 'd like to know where you got this information
On the
's nod, the
opens an adjoining office
Wickwire enters
He's stiff as a groom on a wedding cake
'm sorry, 'Neil
But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations
This is insane
You've got no proof
(from report) You were seen leaving Ensign Blondell's apartment at approximately 0-200, whereupon physical affections were exchanged in public
We hugged
In addition, you have been seen frequenting the base exchange, the mess hall, the -- Because the men didn't want me eating with them
Jesus Christ, let's get this right
That's enough
Everybody
(to Wickwire) Rejoin your class, lieutenant
(only to Jordan) wish  didn't have to do this, Jordan
Dismissed, lieutenant
Wickwire exits
Sir,  just want you to know that this is either a gross mistake -- or someone's vindictive bullshit
In no way did anything happen between Ensign Blondell and myself
We're just friends
So you're saying the charges have no validity whatsoever
Jordan opens her mouth to confirm -- and hesitates, realizing where this might be headed
What the collateral damage might be
'm saying, we're just friends
find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant
But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders
There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty
You should prepare yourself
Sir, please
if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud
don't see how, 'Neil
Dismissed
Jordan moves to the door
Again she makes eye-contact with Blondell
Now we understand why she's so scared: There's a witch-hunt brewing
(turning back) Sir
If tomorrow
was not under your command
would the inquiry still go forward
'm not sure what -- Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there
She's offering her own head on a silver platter -- and the actually hesitates before answering
believe so
-    - McCool and Flea exit a classroom with other trainees
They spot Jordan approaching
So what'd he want
'Neil
She passes them robotically
Flea realizes where she's going
Oh, no
no, no, no, no
They lurch after her, grabbing her, stepping in her way
Stand fast
McCool and Flea jerk to a stop:  The Chief has emerged from the instructor's office
Helpless, they watch as
Jordan mounts the stairs to the bell
takes up the baton
and    like a tyko drummer
:  On the pained faces of her crewmates
:  On the Chief
Taking no joy in it
Just accepting it as inevitable
-    - :  On Wickwire as he walks across the base
His regrets are obvious
: -   - The ice floes are gone
The river banks are budding green
Soon   a power boat making its way upriver
lone figure sits on the prow
- It's Jordan
Dressed in civvies, gunnysack between her legs, she's back in Virginia with nothing more than what she left with
Around a river bend appears
The gunkhole harbor
Home
-  - The boat docks
Jordan springs clear, waves a worn-out thanks, starts up the dock
But now she comes to a stop, seeing
Royce
Stepping out of the house
:  River shimmering behind them, they meet on the dock
charged stand-off:  Where do they pick up
Can they pick up
Then Jordan drops her gunnysack and steps into his wide-spread arms
Royce wraps her up as if to never let go
For the first time in this whole ordeal, Jordan begins crying, sobbing uncontrollably
(in her ear) want to kill them
want to kill the guys who made you cry like this
- '  - An hour later
Sharing a quiet moment, Jordan and Royce cradle tea mugs while sitting on the rear porch that overlooks the Potomac and a fiery sunset
All  wanted was an honest chance
And If  couldn't get it,  couldn't stay
And this class officer
"Wickwire
"  You think he was just trying to get even
Striking back for
Maybe
Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it
Almost like
(a beat) Did  say he was class officer
Almost like someone put him up to it
Okay, who
No shortage of suspects
The Chief
Or maybe even Turrentine
Your
She looks at him sidelong
Royce
Tell me you didn't keep a file on me
- '  - on multiple files being pulled out of a briefcase
One contains clippings -- "
Jane" photos, editorials, political cartoons
Another holds records of Coronado personnel -- Jordan's crewmates, instructors, the base brass
Somebody was yankin' your stings, Jordan -- maybe from 3,000 miles away
wanted to know who
still do
She shakes her head, resisting
'mon, Jordan
Do the headwork with me
It's done with, Royce
Let it go
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back
'm tired of fighting back
just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay
Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork
Agitated, she walks away
, a   until the machine picks up
(pulling a file) "John James Urgayle
"  The Chief
What about him
Instructors typically pull three year assignments
This guy's in and out in one year -- your year
That sound right
Sounds like an amazing coincidence
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy
don't know,  don't care
Well, pardon me if  do
Now who else
Who could've leveraged a class officer like that
'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game
, we hear some of the  : '  (
) just got word today
The Senator wants you to know that she's disturbed by the matter, and she'll be looking into it carefully to make sure you were treated fairly
If you need to reach us, we're here in Washington, 202-224-3121
-
Something stirs in Jordan's memory
"In Washington
" What
Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado
We can see her mind gathering speed
Royce switches files quickly
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"
Second run at Coronado
and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country
(a revelation) He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere
'd sure like to know who
Yeah
Me too
-    - Answering a : Administration, Ensign Blondell
(
) Don't say my name
Who's
(brightening) Lieuten -- (
) Or rank
But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order
Okay, but
You didn't have to do what you did
Not for me
(
) (appreciative) "Wickwire, Thomas Dane
"  See what you can find
: -    - File in hand, Blondell returns to the phone
Got it
(
) Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"
Uh
don't see it
There's no signature
But hang on -- there's a note to "See Addendum
"  Checking
She finds a crisp sheet of stationary, out of place among the smeared government forms
Wow
(
) What'd you find, Kathy
on the stationary
It bears an image of the Capitol dome
: -
- The real Capitol dome
flag is being raised over the Senate Wing
-
- car parks at barricades
Jordan and Royce emerge, both in uniforms
Don't even dream about leaving that vehicle there
Government car -- tow it if you want
Just point us to DeHaven's office first
Not waiting for directions, Jordan takes the Capitol steps two at a time
We've seen this look on her face before -- and last time, she nearly knocked the grinder bell into orbit
-
- Jordan and Royce move quickly down a corridor, eyes hunting, passing   and their tourists
Soon they find
DeHaven's office
Navy captain exits with paperwork
Hasty salutes
Capt'n
Commander
The captain moves on
Royce holds in the doorway a beat, memory nagging him
Again he looks at
The captain
He has a distinct bald spot
(to Jordan) Get started here
'll catch up
Picking up where he left off a few weeks ago, Royce follows Bald Spot around a corner
-
- down a private staircase
-
- and through a door marked "Naval Appropriation Liaison Office
"  It's not 30 seconds from DeHaven's door
- '  -
- Your name again
Lieutenant j
g
'Neil
In a side office, DeHaven's aide overhears
He rises quickly and enters the foyer
' Ms
'Neil
Yes, of course
'm Douglas Champeau
Unfortunately, the Senator is in chamber right now
How can  help you
What chamber
Which way is that
' mean, she's on the floor of the Senate
Okay, which way
' She really can't be disturbed
But if you care to wait, 'll find you an office with a phone
It might be several hours, but -- pokes in
'Scuse me, but 'm here to pick up gallery tickets
Are you
' See the secretary, please
Over the aide's shoulder, Jordan watches as
The tourist claims tickets
on the bureau near the secretary's desk where the tickets are stored
-
- On the chamber floor,  mull about, consulting aides, polling party mates
place microphones and fill the ceremonial snuff boxes, readying the room for session
Among the activity, we find
DeHaven
Caucusing with another Democrat
(
) Senator DeHaven
DeHaven looks behind her
Nobody
DeHaven
Now she looks up to behold
Jordan standing in the gallery
Staring down on DeHaven as she is, it's hard to read anything into her expression but open disdain
Drawn by Jordan's voice, a   hurries down the gallery steps
Royce runs interference
We can talk here or we can talk outside, Senator
You tell me
On the floor, half the
Senate stops what it's doing and looks up
In the gallery, the guard is thrown off-balance by the naval uniforms:  Do Royce and Jordan belong here or not
Confused, he looks for guidance from
DeHaven
She notes - cameras swinging Jordan's way
Summoning a page: Cloak room
'll meet her there
Just her
-
- Towering doors swing open
DeHaven appears, face pleasant but harried
Jordan
always hoped we'd get together -- though just now 'm gearing up for a child-care vote that -- Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire
About to hug Jordan, DeHaven stops awkwardly
You know him
Sounds familiar
It should
You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me
Jordan
Might we do this over lunch tomorrow
do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely -- Did you set me up
Did you set me up just to see me fail
Absolutely not
DeHaven glances back at the doors to the Senate chamber -- the open doors
Walking Jordan a few steps away: Wickwire was there to help
To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot
At least that was the intent
What changed
Should probably ask him that
If  have to ask again, Senator, 'll be asking in front of cameras
It's a threat DeHaven doesn't appreciate
The Senate appears
Madam Senator
Your esteemed colleagues are requesting -- Two seconds, Walter
(answering Jordan) In 1981, the Supreme Court was asked to rule on the issue of women in combat positions
The Court cited the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws as a legal foundation for keeping women ineligible
That decision held for all these years -- until the White House, 10 days ago, moved to have the Exclusion Laws voided
To demolish that legal foundation
So
Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire
Because he knows what know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way
You don't know that
In face,  do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same
What are you saying
That a women's life is more valuable than a man's
That a women's death hurts a family more
'm saying it's not going to happen
Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should  choose to ever campaign against him
He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags
Jordan shakes her head in disbelief
She has met the enemy -- and she is us
You were never going to let women serve in combat
You always had a safety net
Or thought you did
Jordan
don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory
So the rhetoric gets you headlines
But the reality gets you in trouble
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war
don't need to compound the problem with women
(off Jordan's look) Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life
Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with -- wanted the choice
The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me
That's how it should've been
Madam Senator, once again  must -- Just hold the goddamn clock, Walter
Not happy about it, the doorkeeper reaches into an alcove, grabs a broom he keeps around for just these occasions
He enters the chamber
-
- and moves behind the rostrum
Holding the broom by the bristles, the doorkeeper stands on tip-toes
And uses the broom handle to turn back the Senate clock by three minutes
Senators
It's an old trick played by senior members -- and they all hate it when it happens to them
-
- once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and  always meant to make good on that
Come work for me can always use a hard-charger on my team
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too
've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began
And that's quite verifiable
'm sure it is
You'll think about my offer
You know,  wonder what the SecNav would think about it
If  spoke with him
Well,  spoke with Mr
Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off
No more test cases
He was only too happy to oblige
(dangerously low) Don't play politics with me, little darlin'
You'd be up way past your bedtime
(distraught) Madam Senator, please
'll call you in a few days
She flashes a winning smile and turns away
As the chamber doors start to close behind her: So  wonder what the President would think
The last image we have of DeHaven is her whirling back, startled
The    in her face
'  -    - Through a window, we see the
with a phone pressed to his ear
He stands at attention even though wearing a bathrobe
Half-audible through the glass: Yes sir
No, 'm not saying it would be impossible, sir, just
Yes sir
No sir
Yes sir
can appreciate that, sir
Good night, sir
'  -    - The
hangs up and looks to Jordan, heretofore unseen
She waits anxiously
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it
Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'
Sir
What did he say
Basically -- he asked me if  could unring a bell
-    - on the helmet graveyard
Hands enter  to reclaim one helmet in particular
on Jordan, back in the grinder, back in Navy greens
The Spec-Recon class is here
Crewmates gawk like stone idiots as Jordan takes her old place in the line-up
(to class) One of you here understands better than anyone what this is all about
Someone who has engaged in conduct unbecoming
Someone who knows, would hope, what he must now do
on Wickwire
Feeling the heat
Wondering if they really know who it is
Now the
parks himself right in Wickwire's face
And unless that someone takes the honorable way out in the next 10 seconds --  will make certain he faces action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice
Wickwire breaks rank and heads for the bell
He slows when reaching Jordan, considering an apology he knows would be inadequate
Just walk away and never stop
He does
As Wickwire  : It seems we have an opening for class officer
Any nominations
Eyes swing to Jordan
Way ahead of them: All those in favor
Jordan puddles up
Chief Urgayle, turning it back over to you
On his way to the front, the Chief stops to check in with Jordan
Well, 'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three
Good to see you again, too, sir
Okay, 'Neil
So you've impressed all the others
Now try me
- The morning sun is an orange ball balanced on the Coronado Bridge
In silhouette, pelicans circle, some dive-bombing into the bay below
Suddenly a   across the sun, scattering the birds as it heads off-shore
- (setting watch) Four

Flea, McCool, Slutnik, Cortez, Newberry, Jordan
Inside the airborne helo, they synchronize their dive watches
Final assignment
Each crew will be dropped 12 miles out
Between you and the shore is a network of mines and underwater obstacles
You will clear the obstacles, you will tag the mines with your crew number
You have until 18-hundred to make landfall
- As the helo swoops down onto the ocean deck
- The trainees double-check wet gear and survival vests
On Jordan's nod, they push an inflatable life boat ("") to the helo door
It's rolled up into a rubber log
Remember
The one thing you can count on in any mission is that anything mechanical will fail
If you get stuck out here, do not call me, for you will no longer be in my class
Try the Coast Guard
The   slows to five knots
The Chief gives Jordan the go-ahead nod
(to her crew) One-second intervals
Go
- The  splashes down into the ocean
Jordan's crew helo- casts in after it
From the door of the circling helo, the Chief watches as
Jordan's crew swims to the , bobbing in the swells
Flea turns a handle on the CO2 tank meant to inflate the boat
Nothing happens
'mon, c'mon
Cortez tries to help
The handle spins in his grip
This tank's not gonna cut it, el- tee
Handle's stripped
Jordan looks skyward
100 feet overhead, the Chief gives her a parting salute as the helo lifts away
just wonder how that happened
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear
Try a wrench on that thing
- The helo turns into the morning sun
and - drop visors
' :  Of dots in the sun
What the hell are try
Something hits the windscreen, splattering red and brown
What happening
Fucking pelicans
Hang on
He starts to bank clear -- but not fast enough
- More birds pepper-shot the helo:  One  through the main rotor, another through the tail rotor
Another bird gets sucked right into
The main turbine
- a
and now they whole helo loses power
Holy
'
As the pilot wrestles controls, the co-pilot rigs for auto-gyration
But the bank they started is working against them:  The helo is coming down badly, circling like a huge steel feather
Braced, the Chief looks out the side door -- and sees ocean rushing up at him
Fast
- What the shit is
Jordan whirls
She's just in time to witness
The helo hitting the water
In seconds it's gone
stunned beat
We never knew the ocean could be this quiet
When the anesthetic of shock wears off: You don't suppose this is just part of
Mark it, mark it
Cortez
What the hell you waiting for
Cortez torques his wrench hard:  CO2 flows into the , inflating it
The crew scrambles aboard
Jordan digs like a dog to find a radio
Base, this is Crew Leader Six
We have a downed helo 12 miles west- south west of base with three aboard
Repeat, we have a downed helo with three aboard
Slutnik yanks a starter cord:  Their outboard to life
The boat does a donut in the water and blasts away
: - The  powers over swells
Flea is perched on the bow, nose to the wind like a hunting dog
Slutnik motors down
Close as  can get, el-tee
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water
Go,
They grab masks and mini-tanks and dive in like dolphins
Jordan snaps up the radio
Base, this is Crew Leader Six
What is your

) Crew Leader, we have a Medevac rerouting from Long Beach, but no other helos prepped at this time
Seafox One and Two are launching now

Base, don't think you copied me
We are 12 miles out
Seafox tops out at 30 knots, which makes it a no- show for 18 minutes
Over
(
) You copied right, Crew Leader
We're looking for options ourselves
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard
Shut your hole, Slutnik
: - McCool surfaces
Visibility drops dead at 40 feet
If they're deeper than that
The others surface and swim in
Nobody's comin' outta that crash, el-tee
Nobody
grim beat -- and then   on the radio
With a voice seemingly from the far side of the moon: (
) Base, this is Basher One
've got a small problem here
Do you copy
Jaws drop
(into radio) Basher One, this is 'Neil
We are barely reading you
What is your situation
-  - 50 feet down, the helo lies canted on a reef shelf
-  - Wedged into a tortured maze of hydraulics and equipment, we find the Chief, operating out of an air-pocket near the windscreen
The pilot is dead, impaled on his cyclic stick, head submerged
The co-pilot is still alive, barely
The Chief struggles to keep the man's head up as he keys a survival radio
Got one other heartbeat here, looks touch and go
've got a questionable leg
- (
) Managed to activate the
If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that
Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef
Over
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes
What's your air situation
Over
(
) Say again
How many micks
15, sir
-  - The Chief sizes up his air pocket
(into radio) That
may not be adequate
- If we could just fix on him
Beacon's a no-go for us
(into radio) Chief -- did  see a flare box aboard
And can you get at it
Over
-  - The Chief props up the co-pilot's head
Gulps air
Ducks underwater to grope through wreckage
Only now do we see that "questionable leg" he was talking about:  It's snapped at mid-calf, blood rivering out
- (
) Got it
(into radio) Show us where you are, Chief
-  - Again the Chief goes below water
He finds a small breach in the fuselage
sticks the flare launcher through
and pulls the trigger
With a  , the flare launches
- streaks toward the surface
- and arcs into daylight 50 yards behind the
Six o'clock
Marking, marking
Spotted you, Chief
Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the -team shows
Over
An ominous beat
Chief
(
) 'Neil
there's no air in your main tanks
What
They scramble to check their main dive tanks
Even through the gauges show full, they're dead empty
All of them
-  - (into radio) This mission wasn't about tagging mines
It was to see how you coped with mechanical failures
Pretty fuckin' ironic, huh
He laughs
It's the bleakest laugh imaginable
- He's circlin' the drain, el-tee
Jordan surveys the equipment they do have aboard -- the stuff she can count on
Mental turbos kicking in: So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each
'Cool
How much air in yours
Maybe half
Not even
Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it
Cortez, help him
Flea
You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles
(grabbing her) 'Neil
Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there
You know that, don't you
So  guess we get one shot at it
-  - Swimming in his own blood, the Chief starts to fade away, losing consciousness
But then, through the cockpit windscreen
hazy orb of light above him
The orb grows and grows until it resolves into a flare carried by his would-be savior
Jordan
Why'd it have to be her
-  - Reaching the downed Helo, McCool and Cortez wedge their oars under the fuselage and leverage hard until
An opening appears
Jordan and Flea swim into the breach
-  - and surface inside the wreckage
Chief, sir
still with me
(unbuckling co-pilot) Take him first
Once he's clear, come back with -- Sir, let me suggest you stop giving orders and start doing exactly what say, because that's the only way we're all getting out of here
Now how's your vest check out
Still good
-  - McCool's air craps out
He abandons his oar and swims for the surface
That leaves only
Cortez, struggling mightily to keep the escape route open
He knows his mini-tank is running on empty -- and it scares the bejeezus out of him
-  - Flea, take the pilot up slow, feed him air
Chief, sir, you and  are gonna take the express elevator outta here
Remember to let your air out
Ready
- Twin transports -- Seafox One and Two -- pound across the water
Instructors sweep binoculars, trying to spot
The
Newberry    skyward as Slutnik over the radio
-  - Cortez's air goes dead
He gives it three more seconds, eyes riveted on the underside of the helo, knowing they have to come out
right
fucking
absolutely
:  Jordan appears with the Chief
Flea is at their heels with the co-pilot
Cortez drops his oar as if it were radioactive and swims for the sky
The   back down onto the reef
Jordan yanks the cord on the Chief's vest
It inflates instantly
One arm raised, Jordan streaks for the surface
- and "Supermans" into daylight with the Chief
They covered 50 feet in four seconds
Doing a 360, Jordan spots
Seafox One coming their way
Jordan waves like a shipwreck victim
Not slowing, Seafox lowers a recovery rig into place: They're wasting no time on the pick-up
Remembering the last time she tried this, Jordan gets a death-grip on the Chief's vest
(growling) 'Neil
Shut up, sir
'm concentrating
The recovery loop comes at her like a big brass ring
past
Jordan plunges her free arm through the loop
And suddenly they're gone, whisked away by the boat
Throwing a rooster tail a mile long, Seafox pivots on the water and heads back to base
Hoooooo-yah
Go, go, go, go
Uh-huh
That's right
Just like we always practice it
: -    - Limousine leading, a parade of vehicles reaches the base entrance
man exits the limo to expedite matters with the
' Senator DeHaven is here for the graduation ceremonies
What are all these other vehicles
' Just a small press corps
Routine
And that pickup truck at the end
' That
That would be the all-woman America's Cup team
-    - (into microphone) Special Reconnaissance Class 118, you may now stand down
All buffed and polished and wearing their dress whites, the former trainees erupt with   -
What began as a class of 100 now ends with just 40
Sitting among the families and friends we find Royce, smiling through his fears
Not far away sits Blondell
No one claps louder
Jordan trades high-fives and fierce hugs with crewmates
Pyro finally manages to take her aside
Lieutenant
was asked to give you this
It's a small case
Jordan opens it to find a medal of bronze and blue enamel
The Navy Cross
believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia
He wanted you to have it
He was very clear on that point
was looking for him earlier, but
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday
By 18-hundred he was gone
Out of the Navy
(knowing better) Just a coincidence
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts
But think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone
Jordan nods, understanding
: -    - DeHaven
She's holding a press conference, trying to turn piss into wine -- and doing a pretty good job: of course, we always prefer peace to war
But if we're going to war, give women a piece
Give them the choice to defend their country
And if the President doesn't like that idea -- if he wants to continue to deny women their equal rights -- then 'll be happy to step out back with him any time, anywhere
Jordan approaches
Spotting her, the   for a photo-op with both women
Jordan
Jordan, dear
Letting silence be the ultimate expression of scorn, Jordan walks right past DeHaven
And joins Royce
Together they turn and leave
Senator, perhaps this would be a good time for that lunch
Will the America's Cup team be joining us
-    - Jordan and Royce walk hand in hand, strolling the same beach she trained on
So here we are again
Staring three years of operational duty in the face
Look
It's not like you'd be completely out of reach
And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado
There are ways of dealing with these things --  mean, if people are so inclined
(warily) Which is guy-speak for
"Yes, Jordan -- 'll wait for you no matter how long
" Finally, the right answer
-    - on Jordan's face
Even beneath the camouflage paint, we can see her exhilaration
to find her in a line of commandos boarding an  -130:  She's embarking on her first mission
until we've lost her completely -- until she's just one soldier among many, indistinguishable from the rest
