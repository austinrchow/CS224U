on Piedmont Plantation in Cherokee County
An   interviews Aibileen
(
) Did you know as a girl, growing up, that one day you'd be a maid
Yes, ma'am

(
) And you knew that because
Momma was a maid
My grandmother was a house slave

) Oh
The woman repeats Aibileen's answer slowly as she writes
(
) (') House
Slave
Uh-huh
Okay
Aibileen squeezes the notebook in her lap
(
) (') Now, did you ever dream of being something else
Aibileen gulps
She doesn't answer
The room is quiet
(
) (') Well then, what's it feel like, to raise a white child when your own child's at home
being looked after by somebody else

Aibileen's hand trembles as she sips from a glass of water
She glances sadly up to the picture of the young black male
: (

Mae Mobley reaches up and touches Aibileen's face
Aibileen kisses her and whispers in her ear
(') You is kind
You is smart
You is important
Mae Mobley's mother,  , 21 and lanky, enters wearing a green dress very much under construction
Pins and double-stick tape hold it all together
Elizabeth has pointed features and a nest of teased, brittle hair
Aibileen, bridge club's in an hour
Did you finish the chicken salad

(') Oh, and Hilly's deviled eggs
No paprika
Elizabeth rotates around like the Tin Man
(') Does this dress look homemade
reckon when you finish, it won't
Elizabeth exits with her pinned hemline sloping at a good twenty degree angle
Aibileen shakes her head
(
) (') Miss Leefolt still don't pick Baby Girl up but once a day

Even the light bulbs have yellowed
(
) But, not Miss Skeeter
Skeeter has very frizzy blond hair cut short above her shoulders
She carries a red satchel
(
) (') No babies
No man
And not lookin'
She wears flats, careful not to add more than a centimeter to her towering height
Dressed well, Skeeter tugs on her unfamiliar attire
'  - The receptionist and Skeeter enter the office of , 68
He has greased, grey hair and the face of a mean man
Smoke pours into the room
Shut the Goddamn door
He snaps his fingers over a chair
Skeeter sits down
(') They announced last week cigarettes'll kill you

Mr
Blackly pours a pack of nuts into his mouth
(') () Okay, let's see what you got
Skeeter quickly hands Mr
Blackly a resume
He skims it over, marking it violently with a red pen
(') "Murrah High Editor, Ole Miss Rebel Rouser Editor, double major, Junior League editor
Damn girl, didn't you have any fun
Is that
important
Mr
Blackly sighs, hands the resume back to Skeeter
You got any references
Skeeter nods slowly
She takes a deep breath and pulls a letter out of her satchel
She hands it to Mr
Blackly
Mr
Blackly snatches the letter and reads it quickly, mouthing the words as he does
He drops the letter on his desk, and looks to Skeeter, flabbergasted
(') That
is a rejection letter
Skeeter's face flushes hot and quick
Not exactly
Missus Stein- -
Missus who
Skeeter points toward the letterhead

In New York

Blackly
So, when applied to Harper and Row, Missus - -She told you "no
" Until  gain some experience, Mr
Blackly
See, it says it right there at the end
"Great potential

Blackly pours the rest of the peanuts in his mouth

Oh, Christ
guess you'll do
Can you clean
Clean
Mr
Blackly sees cigarette smoke bleeding under his door
Clean
Mr
Blackly pulls up a box filled with letters and newspapers
He slams it down in front of Skeeter
(') Miss Myrna's gone shit-house crazy on us, drunk hair spray or something
Read her past columns and all these letters
Answer them just like she did, nobody'll know the damn difference
Skeeter forces a smile
(') You know who Miss Myrna is
() read her articles all the time
Articles
Ha
It's a cleaning advice column, Miss Phelan
Eight bucks a week
Copy due Thursday
Mr
Blackly picks up the phone and starts yelling at someone
Skeeter excitedly grabs the box of letters and leaves
-  - , 22, white and hefty, sits on a closed toilet seat in a well-appointed bathroom
She's covered in red plaid and bows and has a round face topped by a perfect beehive
( ) Momma
We're late for bridge
Hilly carefully rolls toilet paper out from its holder
She raises a pencil and places the tiniest dot imaginable on the first and second sheets of paper
(
) Miss Hilly was the first of the babies to have a baby
And it must a come out of her like the eleventh commandment
`Cause once Miss Hilly had a baby, ever girl at the bridge table wanted one too

She carefully rolls the paper back up in the roll
Minny
Go get Momma
-    - , 33, black, plump and in uniform, rolls her eyes beneath a crystal chandelier
She shouts up the mahogany stairwell
Missus Walters
You need help coming down
, 60, passes quietly behind Minny
'm down
Minny jumps with a yelp, spins around
(') Been down
Gone give me a heart attack
Missus Walters ambles toward the closet door
Minny quickly tries to turn her toward the front door
Missus Walters resists
Minny, 'm getting my coat
Missus Walters opens the closet
It's ninety degrees out there, Missus Walters
Missus Walters pulls out a red, wool coat with cheetah print collar
The early stages of Alzheimer's have appeared, but Missus Walters is still quite proud at eighty percent capacity
(
) Once Missus Walters' arteries went hard, Miss Hilly moved her and Minny in with her
Fired the maid she had just to make room
See, Minny about the best cook in Mississippi, and Miss Hilly wanted her
Hilly's approach is marked by the whishing sound of her plaid, fat thighs
7
She nonchalantly grabs the coat from her mother and carries it out the door
Minny and Missus Walters follow
Minny carries a chocolate pie
Hilly barks over her shoulder
Minny, William took Billy out for ice cream
So, hurry back and get Billy down for his nap
No dilly dallying
Yes, ma'am
Minny raises the pie behind Hilly's beehive, dreaming of smashing it into her head
(
) Minny my best friend
old lady like me lucky to have her
- - Aibileen kneels next to Mae Mobley who sits on a small children's training toilet
No
(
) It's a tricky thing
you try to make a baby go in the toilet bowl before it's time
If theys can't get the hang of it, theys get to thinking low a theyselves
Mae Mobley sticks her lip out
(') You drunk up two glasses a grape juice,  know you got to tee-tee
Nooo
Mae Mobley shakes her head
give you a cookie if you go
Tee-tee immediately sprinkles into the bowl
(') Mae Mobley
You going
Aibileen and Mae Mobley laugh excitedly as Elizabeth storms into the bathroom in her finished dress
The hemline now slants in the other direction
8
Aibileen, the girls are pulling up, and the table isn't set
Mae Mobley go, Momma
Get in your room
Right now
Mae Mobley rises behind Aibileen's leg
sorry
Elizabeth reaches down and scoops up Mae Mobley like a sack of potatoes
Mae Mobley looks to Aibileen over her mother's shoulder, her eyes have welled up
Aibileen mouths " love you" and blows her a kiss
-   - The Leefolt's small, wood paneled, two bedroom "ranch" is destined to become income property one day
, early 20s, and Elizabeth hover around two collapsible card tables arranged in the living room
Aibileen methodically arranges grapes on a platter of chicken salad resting on Elizabeth's dining table
The table has a small -  in the middle
(
) lost my own boy, Treelore, right before  started waitin' on the Leefolts
Elizabeth glances anxiously to the dining table then catches eyes with Aibileen, nodding ever so slightly
: Aibileen carefully slides the platter over the - making sure it's hidden
(
) (') After Treelore died, a bitter seed was planted inside a me
And just didn't feel so accepting anymore
Hilly enters the front door holding Missus Walters coat
Hey, girls

( ) Hey, Hilly
Minny follows behind holding the pie and Missus Walters' arm
(over her shoulder) Put Momma in a chair before she breaks a hip
'm not deaf yet, Hilly
Minny spies Aibileen in the corner and gives her a "here we go" look as she lowers Missus Walters into a chair
Hilly approaches Aibileen with the coat
Aibileen,  want you to have this coat
It's too big for Momma now and it's way too expensive to put in the coat drive
Hilly extends the coat with a smile
(') All yours
Aibileen takes the coat
Thank you, Miss Hilly
Go on
Try it on
-  - Minny plows through the swing door and reaches for Hilly's deviled eggs
Aibileen rushes in behind her wearing the cheetah collared coat
The sleeves are about a foot too short
Hold on
Those are Miss Hilly's
Aibileen pulls another plate of eggs out of the fridge
(') Gots to have paprika on `em
Minny takes an egg
It disappears in a single bite
Forgive me, Lord, but 'm gonna have to kill that woman
10
Aibileen removes the coat and lays it over a chair
Watch yo mouth, Minny
Looks like a walking Christmas present with all them bows
Aibileen shakes with silent laughter
(') And, now she gone to puttin' pencil marks on the toilet paper
Oh, law
Did she
Uh-hum
But,  carry paper in from my own damn house
That fool don't know
-   - Elizabeth and Hilly cackle with a group of girls as Missus Walters sits on the couch watching "Guiding Light
" Skeeter suddenly rushes through the front door
Hey, girls
( ) Hey, Skeeter
, 24, approaches and hugs Skeeter
Well, if it isn't Long-Haul- Skeeter
We didn't think you'd ever leave Ole Miss
Well, it's supposed to take four years, Jolene
Skeeter spins around to Hilly and Elizabeth with a sigh
(') Sorry 'm late

Hilly and Elizabeth look at Skeeter with concern
(') What
11
About supper club tonight
Honey, Stuart had to cancel
Again
Hilly places her hand on Skeeter's shoulder
He can't get off the rig, Skeeter
It's offshore
Stuart is a very successful oil man
'm starting to think this Stuart is a figment of your imagination
Raleigh called his cousin down in Hattiesburg
He'll drive up
The cousin with one eye
Elizabeth nods
(') guess his black patch will match my dress
Just forget it
Skeeter storms off
Hilly glares at Elizabeth
One eye
-   - Aibileen clears the dining table as bridge begins
Hilly, Elizabeth and Skeeter sit with Jolene
Skeeter takes a deep breath and belts out her news

at The Jackson Journal
Everyone looks at Skeeter as if she just threw up on herself
Finally, Hilly pats Skeeter on the leg
They'd be a fool not to hire you
Jolene raises her glass
To Skeeter
and her job
Last stop `til marriage
Hilly kicks Jolene under the table
12
The Miss Myrna column
Have y'all read it
Well, no
But,  bet the poor girls without any help, in South Jackson, read it like the King James
Everyone laughs
Skeeter's forehead crinkles
Elizabeth, would you mind if  talk to Aibileen
To help me answer some of the letters
Just until get a knack for it
Aibileen clears dishes as if she hasn't heard a thing
Elizabeth gets very still
Aibileen
My Aibileen
What can't you just get Constantine to help you
Skeeter looks to her lap and shakes her head
Constantine

What
Oh, my gosh
Skeeter nods her head sadly
'm so sorry, Skeeter
really don't want to talk about it
Okay
The girls nod
(') Anyway

Elizabeth looks to Aibileen
Well
mean as long as it doesn't interfere with her work
phone rings
Elizabeth nods to Aibileen
-  - Aibileen rushes in the kitchen and answers the phone

Leefolt residence
() -  - : Pink, fuzzy slippers anchoring bare, sexy legs stand on a black and white check floor
(
) Ah-hem
Hello, is Elizabeth in
Rising up a slim torso, sizeable cleavage bursts out of a pink robe's collar
She having bridge club right now
May  take a message
, 28, peroxide blonde, stands in all her country girl glory
She speaks with a thick, unrefined, Southern accent, mired in insecurity
Please tell her Celia Foote called again
'll call back tomorrow
Yes, ma'am
Celia nervously twists herself around in the phone cord
Ah-hem
Miss
"Miss" strikes Aibileen as very odd
(') 'm looking for some help at my house
You know any maids looking
No, ma'am
Okay
Celia Foote
Emerson 6-8-4
Bye, now
Celia hands up the phone with a frown and sips from a coca- cola bottle
-   - Aibileen enters the living room with a coffee pot
14
Who was that on the phone
Miss Celia Foote called again
Elizabeth leans over and touches Hilly's arm
've never called her back, Hilly
She can't take a hint, can she
Who's Celia Foote
That tacky girl Johnny married
Girl
heard she's twenty-eight
Oh my God
Uh-hmm, worked concessions at a game and sold him a hotdog
And, boy, he got a whole lot more
All the girls laugh
Could have been you, Hilly
And live thirty minutes outside of town
Anyway,  ran into her at the beauty parlor, and she had the nerve to ask if she could help with the children's benefit
Aren't we taking non-members
The benefit's gotten so big
Yes, but we're not telling her
Everyone laughs but Skeeter
Aibileen pours Skeeter a cup of coffee
Skeeter looks up decidedly and smiles
Thank you, Aibileen
Hilly begins squirming in her seat, obviously making a point
Elizabeth leans over
Oh, Hilly,  wish you'd just go use the bathroom
15
Ah-hem
'm fine
Missus Walters shouts out from the sofa
She's upset cause the nigra uses the guest bath, and so do we
Elizabeth turns to Aibileen
Aibileen, go check on Mae Mobley
Aibileen disappears
Elizabeth leans into Hilly
(') Just go use mine and Raleigh's
Hilly hiss-whispers
If Aibileen uses the guest bathroom, 'm sure she uses yours too
Aibileen turns the corner in the hall and stops
Wouldn't you rather them take their business outside
Skeeter sees a reflection of Aibileen listening off of a picture in the hall
Skeeter tries to change the subject
Did y'all see the cover of "Life" this week
Jackie's never looked - -Tell Raleigh every penny he spends on a colored's bathroom, he'll get back in spades when y'all sell
It's just plain dangerous
Everybody knows they carry different diseases than we do double
Elizabeth takes a puff of her cigarette and fidgets with her cards
can't ask Raleigh until tax season
But, it would be nice
That's why 've drafted The Home Help Sanitation Initiative
16
"The Home"
the what
As a disease preventative bill that requires every white home to have a separate bathroom for the colored help
've even notified the Surgeon General of Mississippi
'll pass
Skeeter again glances at Aibileen
Their eyes meet
Maybe we ought to just build you a bathroom outside, Hilly
The room grows eerily quiet
You ought not to joke about the colored situation
Hilly leans in toward Skeeter
(') 'll do whatever it takes to protect our town
Your lead, Jolene
Jolene suddenly looks to a wall clock
She jumps up and throws her cards to the table
have to skedaddle
Gotta get over to the station
() Daddy's letting me do the weather tonight
-  - Celia delicately prunes two rosebushes
Her long pink fingernails wrap easily around a pair of sheers
As Celia stands back to admire her work, We widen to see the Foote estate
Ancient oaks dripping in Spanish moss surround a perfectly manicured lawn
"Tara" pales in comparison
Oddly, the two rosebushes have been planted in the center of the lawn, jeopardizing the Antebellum Feng Shui
(
) Now, Miss Celia had her a man
`Bout the best lookin' man in all of Mississippi
But, no baby and no friends
, 23, Celia's ridiculously handsome husband, sneaks up behind her as he removes his jacket and tie
17
Roses look like weeds next to you
Celia turns with a yelp
She slaps him playfully
Johnny, you scared the daylights out of me
Johnny begins kissing her neck
(') You're home early
Celia pushes him back
(') Johnny,  can't get any of your old friends from school to call me back
Oh, who cares, honey
We got all we need right here
Johnny kisses her again and lowers her to the grass
Johnny, honestly
Doctor's orders
Johnny starts kissing Celia's breasts
She becomes uneasy and rolls out from under him
don't know what's taking us so long
'm sorry
Johnny brushes hair from Celia's face
Hey, we've never done it in the yard
Maybe that's the trick
Celia seductively bites her lower lip
Watch my hair
Johnny's hand slides up her thigh

Aibileen enters with a stack of dirty coffee cups
Aibileen
Aibileen becomes nervous at the sight of Skeeter alone
Yes, ma'am

Yes, ma'am
So
Would you help me
Aibileen nods and looks out to Elizabeth on the street
Miss Myrna gets it wrong lotta times
Be good to get it right
Thank you, Aibileen

Aibileen doesn't respond
She grabs a basket of rolls
(') Listen

Aibileen quickly turns her back to Skeeter
gospel choir begins singing on the radio
(') Is that Preacher Green's sermon on the radio
Yes, ma'am, it is
That reminds me so much of my maid growing up
Aibileen starts wiping down a serving tray
Constantine and me

19
Skeeter turns to Aibileen as she puts out her cigarette
She loved me like you love Mae Mobley
Yes, ma'am
Skeeter moves closer to Aibileen
Aibileen
How could she just quit like that
Aibileen stops wiping and looks up to Skeeter
Quit
Yes
When  got home from school last week, Momma said she had quit
Back in March to go live with her people up in Chicago
She didn't leave me a note or anything
Aibileen turns and resumes wiping the tray
(') Could you do that to Mae Mobley
Aibileen slowly turns back to Skeeter
No, ma'am
couldn't
Do you have an address for her or anything
Aibileen shrugs her shoulders, reeling it all back in
Just then, Elizabeth walks into the kitchen holding papers stapled together
She looks between Aibileen and Skeeter
'm sorry
Did  interrupt something
Skeeter and Aibileen shake their heads
Elizabeth hands Skeeter the papers

The black woman smiles and waves as Skeeter passes
When Skeeter looks in her rear view mirror, they're gone
Skeeter suddenly stops the car just short of an intersecting gravel road

Charlotte removes the wig with a sigh

Tight on Skeeter's face as Constantine gives her a big hug
- '  - Skeeter lies in bed staring holes into the ceiling as a rooster announces the morning
sudden revelation washes over her
In a flash, Skeeter is out of bed and running down the stairs
-  - Pascagoula tends to a skillet full of eggs next to a black and white  resting on the counter
: Jolene French attempts to deliver the weather on
Sunny skies and a high of ninety- eight today with ninety-nine percent humidity
There's a slight chance of afternoon showers so y'all carry an umbrella
Jolene pivots to camera, lowers her chin and smiles
Skeeter runs past Pascagoula with a phone and disappears inside the pantry
-  -   - , 45, hard but stylish, talks on the phone in a large corner office
She lights a cigarette and swivels her chair toward the Manhattan skyline
What gave you this idea, Miss Phelan
'm
curious
() -  - Skeeter sits on a huge sack of flour
millennium's supply of can goods fills the shelves

was
well,  was raised by a colored woman
've seen how simple it can be and
well, how complex it can be, too
between the families and the help
Continue
'd like to write something from the point of view of the help
These colored women raise white children, and then twenty years later those children become the employer
It's that irony, Miss Stein, that we love them and they love us yet
we don't even let them use the toilet in the house
Miss Stein's swivels her chair back around and sits up
'm listening
Margaret Mitchell glorified the mammy figure who dedicates her whole life to a white family but no one
ever asked Mammy how she felt about it
There is both undisguised hate for white women and an inexplicable love, but nobody ever talks about it down here
So, a side to this never before heard
Yes
Charlotte knocks on the pantry door
(
) Skeeter, who are you talking to in there
Skeeter covers the mouth piece and opens the door
Go
Away
Skeeter slams the door
(') So, yes, their side of the story
Skeeter leans back against the shelves
30
Who was that
My mother
She just dropped by to- Look, no maid in her right mind would ever tell you the truth
That's a hell of a risk in a place like Jackson, Mississippi watched them try to integrate your bus station on the news
Oy
They jammed fifty-five Negroes in a jail built for four
Skeeter panics
already have a maid
Skeeter can't believe what just came out of her mouth
Miss Stein rises and sits on the edge of her desk
Really
negro maid has already agreed to talk to you
Skeeter blinks hard
No turning back now
Yes, ma'am
Well
suppose  could read what you come up with
The book biz could use a little rattling
You'd do that
'm saying 'll let you know if it's even worth pursuing
Oh, thank you, Miss Stein
And for God's sake, you're a twenty- four-year-old educated woman
Go get an apartment
She hangs up
-  - Skeeter sits across the table from Aibileen, reading the `Miss Myrna' letters
31
Outside, winds howl, and the sky grows dark
Jolene's forecast appears to be a bit off
"Dear Miss Myrna, How do  remove the rings from my fat, slovenly husband's shirt collar when he is such a pig and sweats like one too
" Which one she want a get rid of
Them rings or the husband
Skeeter chuckles and shrugs her shoulders
(') Tell her a vinegar and Pine-Sol soak
Then let it set in the sun a bit
Skeeter writes this down
(') Bout an hour
Let it dry
Skeeter keeps writing
Aibileen notices something outside
Hilly walks into the Leefolt backyard with her son, , 3, perched on her hip
, 30s, follows holding a set of plans
Skeeter turns to the open window
It's already started to sprinkle outside
Build it just like the one at my house, right against the garage
The contractor nods
Lightning strikes, thunder cracks
(') Oh, mercy
Hilly is off and running with Billy
Skeeter seizes the moment
Aibileen, do you ever wish you could
change things
Aibileen turns slowly from the window
(') mean, all that talk yesterday and now with what Hilly's up to
Aibileen's eyes fall to the floor
32
Everthing's fine
My momma fired Constantine
Thank you for telling me that
never tolt you that
Aibileen jumps up as another crack of thunder sounds out
Aibileen,  have an idea
Something  want to write about
But  need your help
Skeeter rises
(') want to interview you
about what it is like to work as a maid
Aibileen stops at the refrigerator, gripping the life out of its handle
(') 'd like to do a book of interviews about working for white families
Show what it's like to work for, say
Elizabeth
Aibileen begins to perspire
She grabs the counter to steady herself, then moves toward her chair
You know what'd happen to me if Miss Leefolt knew  was tellin' stories on her
was thinking we wouldn't tell her
The other maids will have to keep it secret, too
Other maids
was hoping to get four or five
To really show what it's like in Jackson
To see what y'all get paid, the babies, the bathrooms, the good and the bad
Aibileen shakes her head
They set my cousin Shinelle's car on fire just cause she went down to the voting station
33
book has never been written like this, Aibileen
`Cause they's a reason
do this with you,  might as well burn my own house down
Bam
The front door slams shut
() -   - Soaking wet, Elizabeth and her husband, , 25, stand toe to toe
put up with the new clothes and all the damn trips to New Orleans, but this takes the goddamn cake
It'll confuse Mae Mobley if she sees Aibileen going inside
And we can't risk her health
: Aibileen hears Mae Mobley crying, but she is frozen
: (') Hilly spoke to the Surgeon General
She also said it'll add value to our home
Great
Mae Mobley can just go to college in that bathroom, too
Honey, Hilly's covering the cost
and said you can just do William's taxes to pay her back
We don't take orders from the Holbrooks
-  - Raleigh storms in and is surprised to see Skeeter
Skeeter
How you doing
Fine
34
Fix me a sandwich, Aibileen
Raleigh storms out as Elizabeth charges into the kitchen
Aibileen, Mae Mobley's crying her eyes out
Aibileen runs off
Elizabeth sees Skeeter and tries to compose herself
(') Skeeter
Hello
'm sorry but think it's best if you leave now
Skeeter gathers her things
(') And
don't think this Miss Myrna thing is gonna work out with Aibileen
-  - The storm has escalated
The Holbrook house is without power
Hilly runs around lighting candles
Missus Walters lies on the couch while Minny fans her with a newspaper
You're making it a lot hotter flapping your arm like that
Minny stops and begins squirming with discomfort
Missus Walters notices her looking out to the garage bathroom
Lightning strikes
Leaves blow across the yard
Hilly plops down in a chair with a candle
That should do it
Minny, go get me and Momma some iced tea
Minny hesitates
She gulps
Uh
Miss Hilly
Yes
Never mind
As Minny turns, Missus Walters calls out to her
35
You go on ahead and use the guest bath, Minny
It's okay
Oh, for crying out loud
It's just a little rain
She can go get an umbrella up in William's Study
believe she was working for me before you dragged us both here
Minny looks outside just as wind slams an aluminum lawn chair against the garage bathroom
Boom
Another crash of thunder
Large hail stones begin falling in the yard
'm gone get your tea
-  - Minny sneaks into the guest bath with a candle and shuts the door
She carefully lowers the seat and sits
Relief spreads across her face
There's a knock on the door
She freezes
(
) Minny
Minny panics, staying completely quiet
() -  - Hilly leans into the bathroom door
, are you in there
Yes, ma'am
Are you sitting down
Minny gets up quickly and flushes the toilet
Hilly beats on the door
(') Outside the house, an eerie, groaning sound, much like a freight train, intensifies
The top of a huge tree snaps off and falls against the house, shattering a window
36
Minny crouches down and covers her head
draft sucks the candle's flame toward the bottom of the door
-  '  - Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley against an interior wall, holding a mattress on top of them and humming in her ear
(
) On top a Minny losin' her tenth job, eighteen people died in Jackson that day
Ten white
Eight black
- Skeeter stands in her backyard facing Jackson
Cool winds head toward the dark, swirling horizon
In the distance, lightning strikes
-   - Celia leans on the porch railing, gazing helplessly as the relentless hail storm pummels her two rosebushes
(
) God don't pay no mind to color or class once he sets a tornado loose
Within seconds, the rose blossoms are gone
/
/ () - Aibileen uses the newly completed bathroom Hilly has built in the garage
The walls consist of unpainted plywood with a small window hugging the ceiling
Beads of sweat glisten on Aibileen's forehead under a single bulb hanging above
(
) Soon after, that bitter seed inside of me had sprout and was growing fast
Well into her second pregnancy, Elizabeth exits the house with Mae Mobley at her side
She wears an awful, homemade maternity dress
Hurry, Aibileen
Mae Mobley's up, and 'm off to the doctor
Aibileen reaches behind and flushes the toilet
Mae Mobley gets excited and points to the garage bathroom
37
Aibee bafroom, Momma
Mae Mobley walks toward the bathroom and calls out
(') Aibee
Elizabeth grabs her and forces her down on the back step
No
Be right there, Baby Girl
Aibileen pulls up her panty-hose
- Aibileen waits with  , 45, as well as other maids and black males at a bus stop
Yule May is tall, pretty and graceful
Her hair is pulled tightly into a bun
Skeeter walks down the sidewalk toward them
She and Aibileen catch eyes
Skeeter waves
Yule May inches away from Aibileen
One   in particular looks with concern as Skeeter walks up
Afternoon, Aibileen
Aibileen nods nervously, looking at the other domestics
(') Can  talk to you
bus pulls up
You got some "Miss Myrna" questions for me
No
Yule May and others board
Skeeter grabs Aibileen's arm
(') Please
Aibileen signals to Yule May to go on ahead without her
Yes, ma'am
The bus pulls away
38
Please let me interview you know it's scary, but  really believe this has to be done
We'll be careful
This already ain't careful, Miss Skeeter
You not knowing that is what scares me most
'm sorry
Skeeter hands Aibileen a piece of paper with her phone number written on it
Aibileen turns and walks off down the sidewalk
- Dark outside, Aibileen approaches another, more integrated bus stop
(
) know pretty well what happens if the white ladies found out we was writing about them
Womens, they ain't like men
Women don`t beat you with a stick
Naw, they like to keep they hands clean
Got a shiny set a tools they use, sharp as witches' fingernails
As Aibileen ambles toward a bench,    in nurse uniforms push in front of her and sit
- Skeeter sits at a long table surrounded by books piled high as if to provide a shield of sorts
Lying before her, is an old, thin, onionskin booklet curling at the edges
It's titled: "Compilation of Jim Crow Laws of the South" Skeeter opens the booklet and begins reading
(
) Any person printing, publishing or circulating written matter urging for public acceptance of social equality between whites and negroes is subject to imprisonment
'  -  - Aibileen sits at a table wearing a nightgown
She carefully combs and styles her wig for work in the morning
Her real hair is bound tightly in dozens of tightly bound nubs
39
The rotary wall phone rings
Aibileen hangs the wig on her chair and answers
'  () -  - Minny is hysterical
Oh, Aibileen
went and did it now
Minny wraps a hand up in the phone cord
(') Miss Hilly been tellin' everbody in town  stole a candelabra
That's why  can't get no job
Everbody know you honest, Minny
Oh, but  got her back
did something awful, Aibileen
What you did
() - Minny stands on Hilly's porch holding a chocolate pie
(
) cain't tell
ain't tellin' nobody
done a terrible awful thing to that woman
And now she knows what  did
Hilly answers the door and snarls at Minny
Minny presents the pie and says " am sorry
" Hilly waves Minny inside
'  -  - She got what she deserve, Aibileen
But, now  ain't gone never get no work again
Leroy gone kill me
Minny's husband, , 40, approaches behind Minny
Minny slowly turns
'  -  - Aibileen hears a loud slap and Minny's phone dropping to the floor
Yelling and screaming follows
40
Minny
She can't bear to listen and hangs up the phone
She sees Skeeter's phone number taped to the wall
Aibileen's breath becomes heavy
Anger wells inside her
She picks up the phone again and begins to dial
'  -   - Wearing a black scarf over her hair and clutching her red satchel, Skeeter approaches a small, one-story wood structure
White paint peels, hydrangeas fill the yard
Skeeter spies an old pickup truck parked on the side of Aibileen's house, completely covered in years of dust
Skeeter checks over her shoulder several times
The porch steps creak under her big feet
Aibileen quickly opens the door and waves her inside
'  -   - Aibileen wears the same yellow dress she wore in the first scene
parked way up on State Street and caught a cab here like you asked
Got dropped two streets over
Skeeter nods
Aibileen,  now know it's against the law for us to meet like this
Skeeter stares Aibileen up and down
Aibileen self- consciously flattens our her dress
(') 've never seen you out of uniform before
You look nice, Aibileen
Thank you
Aibileen motions for Skeeter to sit on a narrow sofa behind a coffee table covered in hand-tatted lace
tray holds a teapot, two cups that don't match and cookies resting on folded napkins
As Aibileen pours the tea, her hand shakes
41
(') 'm sorry
've never had a white person in my house before
Skeeter sips her tea
've never been in a colored person's home before
think we're both doing great
This tea is really nice
Aibileen watches as Skeeter takes a bite of the cookie
Miss Skeeter, What if
What if you don't like what  got to say
About white peoples
this isn't about my opinion
It doesn't matter how  feel
You gone have to change my name
Mine, Miss Leefolt's, everbody's
Everybody
So, you know other maids who might be interested
Aibileen is quiet for a moment
She shakes her head
It gone be hard
What about Minny
Minny got her some stories, sho nuff
But, she ain't real keen on talking to white peoples right now
'  -  - We continue with the interview seen on page one
What does it feel like, to raise a white child when your own child's at home, being
looked after by somebody else
It feel
Uh
Aibileen glances up to the framed picture of Treelore
Is that your son
42
Yes, ma'am
He dead two years now
Got run over at the lumber yard
Lungs were crushed
'm so sorry
That's horrible
And, Aibileen, you don't have to call me "ma'am
" Not here anyway
Aibileen nods
Skeeter stares at her list of questions
(') Do you want to talk about the bathroom
Or, about Elizab--Miss Leefolt
Anything about the way she pays you
Has she ever yelled at you in front of Mae Mobley
Aibileen shakes her head
'm sorry, - Aibileen covers her mouth with her hand
Skeeter becomes disgusted with herself
No,  am
She pulls out a stack of Miss Myrna letters
(') Let's just do a couple of Miss Myrna letters, and 'll run on
thought  might write my stories down and read them to you
Well, sure  guess
It no different than writing down my prayers
You don't say your prayers aloud
Prayer like electricity
It keep life going
Writing it down make it more powerful
Lot a ailing, sick peoples in this town
'm sure
didn't get a chance to pray for Treelore
43
(') God took him fast `cause he didn't want to argue with me
He was just twenty-four years old
The best part of a person's life
Oh, Aibileen
But he'd like we's doing this
He always said we gone have a writer in the family one day
After my prayers last night,  got some stories down too
Skeeter nods
Aibileen opens her notebook and reads
(') My first white baby to ever look after was named Alton Carrington Speers
It was 1938, and 'd just turned fourteen years old
Daddy had left us, so  dropped out a school to help momma with the bills
- congregation of three hundred stand singing lively with the large choir
Aibileen stands next to Yule May and is whispering in her ear
Yule suddenly leans back, shocked, shaking her head "no
" Minny watches from two pews back
Her curiosity is peaked
(
) Alton's momma died a lung disease
loved that baby, and he loved me
That's when  learned  could make children feel proud of theyselves
-  - Miss Stein sits at her desk reading Aibileen's stories
(
) Alton used to always be asking me how come 's black
'  -  - It just ate him up, so one time told him it cause  drank too much coffee
Oh, law, you should a seen his face
44
Skeeter laughs as she writes down Aibileen's story
This is great
You have no idea how much  appreciate this
But just have to ask
What changed your mind
( ) Miss Hilly Holbrook
- Hilly stands at a podium banging a gavel
The pleats of her navy blue sailor's number fan out like an accordion
room full of    sits up and quiets down
Half the girls are pregnant and most all drink  and are smoking
Skeeter sits in the back next to Elizabeth
We're running behind on our "coat drive," girls
So hurry up and clean out those closets
But our Christmas Benefit, however, is right on schedule as y'all have already filled all our baked goods raffle slots
The girls applaud, turning to each other with praise
(') 'all think we can put a dent in the African Children's hunger this year
More applause
Those who aren't pregnant, stand
Hilly beams
Elizabeth nudges Skeeter out of her chair
(') Now for some exciting news wanted y'all to be the first to know
My William is seeking election to the State Senate this November
Now, even the pregnant women stand
Elizabeth grabs Skeeter's arm and pulls herself up
(') He's runnin' on a platform of health
Protecting our children
Protecting our way of life
So, , with William, have drafted The Home Health Sanitation Initiative
This sets off a room of whispers
45
(') Skeeter, when can we expect to see the initiative in the newsletter
gave it to you a month ago
Everyone turns to Skeeter
Elizabeth panics
gave that to you myself
, ah
Well, - Would you please stand, Skeeter
As Skeeter rises, several women shake their heads
'll have it in there soon
Skeeter glances at the initiative tucked in her satchel
-   - Skeeter turns a corner and sees Hilly leaning on her car
Hilly
Do you need a ride
Hilly shakes her head with little emotion
(') 'm sorry about the newsletter
Hilly nods
soft smile begins to form
(') With Momma being sick and- Hilly erupts with excitement
He's coming
Oh, Skeeter, he's definitely coming this time
This Saturday night
Oh, Hilly, he's cancelled twice before
Maybe it's a sign
Don't you dare say that
You know  won't be his type
Hilly grabs Skeeter by the shoulders
46
It's your time, Skeeter
And damnit, 'm not going to let you miss this just because your mother convinced you you're not good enough for somebody like him
'  -  - Minny is again wearing her maid's uniform
She puts two plates of food down on the kitchen table
She sits next to her daughter, , 15
Sugar wears a brand-spanking-new maids's uniform
Eat up, Girl
Miss Woodra's like to not feed ya on try-out day
Sugar takes a bite of toast
(') still say you're too young to be waitin' on white peoples
Now, Sugar,  want you to listen to me, and you listen to me good
Minny grabs Sugar's face and looks her right in the eyes
(') These are the rules for working in a white lady's house
Sugar jerks her face away and sticks her lip out
(') Rule Number One: Don't you ever let White Lady find you sittin' on her toilet
Sugar nods
(') Number Two: You keep your nose out of White Lady's problems, and don't cry to her with yours
White people ain't your friends
- Minny steps off a bus and walks down an old country road
(
) Number Three: When you're cooking white food, taste it with a different spoon
They see you put the tasting spoon back in the pot, might as well throw it all out
Spoon, too
47
- Minny approaches the Foote estate
She stops just short of stairs leading up to the front porch
(
) Four: You use the same cup, same fork, same plate every day
Minny takes her first step on the stairs
(
) (') Five: Don't hit her kids
White people do they own spanking
Minny slowly raises her hand to knock on the front door
(
) (') Six: No sass-mouthing
Minny knocks
(') ( ) Number six, Minny
Number six
The door flies open
Celia Foote answers
She's covered in tight pink clothes
Flour covers her face and hair
Hey there
'm Celia Rae Foote
Aibileen said you'd be on time
Minny looks down disapprovingly to Celia's bare feet
(') Can  get you a cold Coca-Cola
No, thank you
'm Minny Jackson

One of those upsidedown cakes from the magazine
It ain't workin' out too good

What in the hell- Minny catches herself
(') ( ) Tuck it in, Minny
Tuck it in
48
guess  have some learnin' to do
( ) You sure do
-   - Minny and Celia enter a huge dining room
Minny gawks at a dusty mahogany table surrounded by twelve chairs
Johnny's momma wouldn't let me decorate a thing
If  had my way, this house would have wall to wall white carpet with gold trim and none of this old stuff
Minny spies a framed battle-worn Confederate flag complete with bullet holes
Where you from
Celia lowers her head in shame
Sugar Ditch
It's near Memphis
know Sugar Ditch
My cousin live there
Celia changes the subject
Let's go meet Oscar
Celia grabs Minny's hand
Annoyed, Minny pulls it away
-   - Minny stands at the base of a massive, stuffed Grizzly bear
It clears the twelve-foot ceiling by an inch
Johnny's granddaddy shot him up in Montana back in 1910 with Teddy Roosevelt
Celia points to fifteen guns mounted behind Oscar
(') We got five bedrooms and bathrooms here in the main house
The pool house has two more beds and baths
49
When you gone have some chillins, start fillin' up all these beds
Celia swallows hard
She places her hand on her stomach
'm pregnant now
Minny steps back and surveys Celia
Gone be eatin' for two
Double the cookin'
Celia slumps her shoulders as she looks around the house
know it's an awful lot to do
Five other maids have already turned me down
Can  at least give you some bus money
When you hear me say  don't wanna clean this house
What
So
You'll do it
Before Minny can nod
Celia throws her arms around her
Minny backs away
No huggin', now
No huggin'
'm sorry
This is my first time hiring a maid
We got to talk about some things first
work Sunday through Friday
Celia bites her pinky nail
You can't come at all on weekends
Okay
What time you want me here
After eight, and you have to leave at four
Okay
Now what your husband say you can pay
Celia looks away
50
Johnny doesn't know 'm bringing in help
And what's Mr
Johnny gone do if he comes home and finds a colored woman up in his kitchen
It's not that 'd be fibbing just want him to think  can do this on my own

Last one done got shot in the head
Minny sniffs the air
(') Miss Celia,  think you done burned up yo cake
-  - Celia grabs a rag off the sink and jerks the cake out of the oven
Oww
Dawgonit
She drops the burnt cake on the floor
You can't use no wet towel on a hot pan
Minny grabs a dry towel and picks up the cake
(') 'll take this burnt up cake with me so Mister Johnny don't see it
-  '  - Aibileen removes Mae Mobley's wet cloth diaper on a changing table
Mae Mobley's behind is covered with inflamed diaper rash
Aibileen shakes her head
Elizabeth enters the room
'm off, Aibileen
Don't forget Raleigh wants pot roast tonight
51
Yes, ma'am
Aibileen's eyes narrow
'  -  - Skeeter works with a typewriter now
Aibileen, more casually dressed than before, waits for Skeeter to finish typing
reckon 'm ready
to talk about Miss Leefolt now
Skeeter stops typing and looks up
She nods
(') Baby girl don't get her diaper changed `til  get there in the morning
That's `bout ten hours she gots to sit in her mess
be so worried about her on my day off
always come in an hour early on Mondays
-  - Charlotte sits at a table sorting through mail as Skeeter enters and grabs an apple (
) Miss Leefolt pregnant again, too
And, law,  pray this child turn out good
It a lonely road if a momma don't think theys child is pretty
Charlotte glances down disapprovingly at the dingy, huarache shoes on Skeeter's feet
Skeeter heads for the door
Where are you going, Skeeter
Skeeter turns
Bible study
On a Saturday night
Momma, God doesn't care what day of the week it is
Skeeter walks out the back door as Charlotte shakes her head
52
'  -  - Hilly, Elizabeth and Jolene French stand with Hilly's contractor
He unrolls a set of bathroom plans
Hilly and Elizabeth look to Jolene and nod approvingly
'  - Skeeter's typing slows
Miss Leefolt be spending so much time keeping up with the society ladies, she done forgot the child she got now
Just then Minny barges through the kitchen back door
Aibileen
Minny stops cold in her tracks at the sight of Skeeter
(') Yule May told me what y'all up to
Aibileen nods
Minny's face hardens
(') Medgar Evers live five minutes away
They blew up his carport last night
For talking
Minny scowls at Skeeter
(') What makes you think colored people need your help
You white
Why you care
We all working for the same thing
( ) Maybe you just want to get her in trouble
Skeeter is petrified
Her face reddens
want to show her perspective
so people might understand what it's like from your side
Well it's a real Fourth of July picnic
53
(') It's what we dream a doing all weekend long, get back in they house to polish the silver
And we just love not getting minimum wage or Social Security
know, Minny
Maybe things might - What law's gonna say you gotta be nice to your maid
And another thing,  don't want my children going to school with white kids
And  don't care a thing about votin
' Only thing black mens get elected to is Deacon of the church
You don't have to do this, Minny
You damn right  don't
You two givin' me the heart palpitations
Minny storms out the back door
Skeeter looks like she might get sick
And that was a good mood
Minny immediately storms back in the kitchen
All right
'm gone do it
just want to make sure you know this ain't no game we're playing here
Skeeter nods, trembling as Minny slides a chair in the middle of the kitchen and sits
(') ( ) Slide your chair out from under that table and face me
want to see you square on at all times
Still trembling, Skeeter slides her chair from the table and just sits there staring at Minny
(') 's got to come up with your questions, too
Let's begin
begin with
with where you were born
Aibileen grabs her notebook and begins writing
54
Belzoni, Mississippi on my great- auntie's sofa
Next
'  -  - Minny talks a mile a minute
Aibileen continues writing
(
) Once Minny got to talking `bout food, she liked to never stop
put the green beans in first, then  go on and get the pork chops going cause, mmm-mmm,  like my chops hot out the pan
Just as Aibileen fills the first notebook, Skeeter hands her another from her satchel
(
) But when she got to talking about the white ladies, it took all night
'  -  - The first signs of morning sun filter into the kitchen
"Oh, Minny, 'm gone give you a week paid vacation
" Now,  ain't had no paid vacation in my life week later,  come back and they'd moved to Mobile
"Miss Lazy Fingers" scared 'd find a new job before she moved
Minny spins around to Aibileen with sudden realization
(') We gots to get more maids
Minny stands
Skeeter's eyes widen with hope
know, but it hard, Minny
Mind racing, Minny flies out the door without a word
Aibileen turns to Skeeter
(') You gone and done it now
55
-  -   - Miss Stein discusses Aibileen and Minny's stories with Skeeter on the phone
like this "Sarah Ross
" She can kvetch but not complain too much
-   () - Skeeter nods rapidly as if she knows what "kvetch" means
And this "Bertha"
she's got chutzpah
'll give her that
So

This many negroes and whites haven't worked together since "Gone with the Wind
" Does this mean you'll publish it
never said that
My advice is to write it fast before this civil rights thing blows over
need it by New Year's, and don't send me anything more until you have twelve maids
Twelve
At least
'  - Minny, Aibileen and Skeeter sit at the kitchen table
Aibileen and  done asked everbody we know
Thirty-one maids
Everbody too scared, think we crazy
Then we might as well stop
56
got plenty a stories, Miss Skeeter
Just write`em down and invent a maid that said it
We already making up everbody's name
Make up the maids, too
Skeeter jumps up from her chair
We can't do that
Aibileen and Minny lean back
(') mean
would never do that
It wouldn't be real
It's wrong
Don't give up on us, Miss Skeeter
Skeeter softens and sits back down
'm sorry
Thank you both for trying
-  - Skeeter delivers the "Miss Myrna" columns to the receptionist, who hands her back a paycheck
- Celia and Minny stand at a fried chicken assembly line
What can you cook
Minny dips pieces chicken in an egg wash, then drops them in a paper bag
puff of flour rises out of the bag
can cook corn pone, boil potatoes, and do grits
Minny bursts out laughing
(') We didn't have electric current where  was raised
Well,  reckon if there's anything you ought to know `bout cooking
Minny holds up a can of Crisco
57
(') It's this
The most important invention since they put mayonnaise in a jar
You don't even know the things you can do with this here can
Celia peers into the skillet as Minny spoons out a mound of Crisco
How pretty
Looks like frosting
Minny rolls her eyes and hands Celia the bag of Chicken
Shake that
Celia starts shaking the bag
This is fun
-  - Minny sits down at the table with a plate of chicken
Celia sits down next to her
Looks so good
'm starved
Aggravated, Minny stands
You supposed to eat in the dining room, Miss Celia
That how it works
Minny grabs Celia's plate
(') Here, 'll take your plate in the dinin' room for ya
Want tea
'm fine right here, Minny
Minny sits back down with a sigh
Celia touches her arm
(') 'm real grateful you're here
Miss Celia, you got a lot more to be grateful for than me
car is heard pulling up in the driveway
Minny panics
(') Mister Johnny
58
Oh, no
Hide
Minny slides down underneath the kitchen table
(') Oh
It's just the florist
Johnny must have sent me flowers
Minny pulls herself up off the floor
She's mad
Miss Celia,  ain't playin' around no more
He gone catch me here and shoot me dead right here on this no- wax floor
You gots to tell him
Ain't he wondering how the cooking so good
You're right
Maybe we ought to burn the chicken a little
The doorbell rings
Celia runs off to answer
Minny don't burn chicken
-  - Skeeter sits with a towel draped across her shoulders
Charlotte, now in an auburn wig, squirts mounds of goo from a pink tube onto Skeeter's hair
This is bound to work, Sweetie
It even smells expensive
She begins twisting Skeeter's hair into gooey spikes
feel the hope in your fingers
Skeeter resembles a papier mache starfish
How can you not know his last name
He's William's cousin
That's all know
That's just so sweet of Hilly
Charlotte takes a drag from her cigarette, then lifts up a silver machine complete with power cord and rubber hose
What is that
59
The Shinolator
It cost eleven dollars
'm a good mother
Charlotte puts a shower cap device on Skeeter's head and reads from the Shinolator manual
(') "The Miracle Straitening Cap" must remain on the head for two hours
" Two hours
Charlotte flips a switch and takes another drag
The machine groans to life
Skeeter's cap inflates
'll have Pascagoula bring you a magazine
Skeeter snatches her mother's cigarette and takes a drag
-  - Skeeter sits under the Shinolator buried in a magazine
Pascagoula enters and sets down a glass of tea
Thanks, Constantine
Do you think this dress is cute
Skeeter holds the magazine up to Pascagoula
Only now does she realize what she's said and done
(') 'm sorry
Thanks, Pascagoula
Pascagoula nods and starts to walk away then turns
knew Constantine
She was a mighty fine woman
- '  - The Shinolator was a success
Skeeter's hair is straight, silky and beautiful
Holy shit
You've shrunk five inches
You'll be able to wear heels tonight
Charlotte looks down to the huarache shoes on Skeeter's feet and rushes to the closet
60
(') You're not leaving this house in those awful, Mexican, man shoes
Charlotte pulls out a dress and pair of heels
(') What time is he picking you up
He's meeting me at Hilly's
Can take the Cadillac
We promised Carlton the Cadillac tonight
So, William's cousin will just have to come get you himself
'll take the truck
It's hooked to the motor grader
'll drive slow
-  - Skeeter pulls away in a rusted 1941 Chevy farm truck with a huge motor grader attached
Charlotte runs next to the truck
Her wig is askew
Don't mope
Remember to smile
Skeeter floors it
Charlotte runs faster
(') And, don't sit like some squaw Indian
Cross
Your
Ankles
Skeeter leaves her mother in a cloud of dust
(') () love you
-   - Chunks of mud fly off the tires
The June sun has set the truck's interior at a stubborn 115 degrees
Skeeter has no choice but to lower her window
The Shinolator meets its match
mangy,   suddenly jumps out in the road
When towing 10,000 pounds of farm equipment, slowing down quickly isn't an option
61
loud thud sounds out from the truck's grill
-  - Hilly, her husband, , and Skeeter's date, , drink high balls and eat cheese in the Holbrook parlor
Gold swag curtains hang on the windows
Balding and pudgy, only William's family money once made him a desirable bachelor
Stuart, on the other hand, is very handsome, the "Marlboro Man" in a well-tailored suit
Yule May (who we met earlier at church with Aibileen) now works for Hilly
She clears empty glasses
With your daddy's endorsement, can win that Senate seat
Stuart feigns interest
'll talk to him
Ice slams against Stuart's teeth as he downs his drink
Hilly pats William's leg then turns with concern to a grandfather clock announcing half past the hour
The front door flies open
Skeeter enters completely out of breath and sweaty
Her
She waves
Hey
As Hilly races toward Skeeter, William and Stuart stand
Stuart is as tall as he is handsome
Boys, we'll be right back
'all talk about quarterbacks or something
Yule May, get Miss Skeeter a Coca Cola
Yule May runs off
Hilly pulls Skeeter down the hall
-  - Skeeter sits on the toilet downing a Coca-Cola
Hilly twists the last of Skeeter's hair into giant rollers
Skeeter, you don't even have on lipstick
Skeeter dabs her armpits
62
It was so goddamn awful
hit a cat
Hilly sprays Final Net
Well
What do you think of him
Skeeter applies lipstick
Hilly removes the rollers
He looks handsome
Skeeter stands up and does a twirl for Hilly
(') All right, give it to me
One to ten
Hilly sprays Skeeter with perfume and stands back
Seven
Really
Seven
Hilly nods, lets out a little squeal
Honey, you're beautiful
Just go on out there
you're gonna do great
It's your time, Skeeter just know it
Hilly hugs Skeeter
-   - Hilly, William, Stuart and Skeeter sit at a round table adorned with white linens, silver and fine china
The room buzzes with Jackson's elite all trying to be noticed as a   plays softly in a corner
approaches
Stuart leans into Skeeter without making eye contact
You want a drink
Just water, please
( ) Double Old Kentucky straight
with a water back
Make that two backs
63
So
you went to Alabama
Stuart nods
Hilly rolls her eyes
"Roll Tide
" We still love him
Hilly pinches Stuart on the cheek
Now you're in the oil business
Hilly says you're a rigsite leader
The money's good
If that's what you really want to know
That's not what - Skeeter and Hilly watch as Stuart's and William's eyes fix on the front of the restaurant
Celia and Johnny have entered
Celia wears a tight green dress and the reddest lipstick ever put in a tube
Isn't that your old boyfriend, Hilly
Johnny Foote
Hilly scowls
(') Who's his girl
Lord, she's hotter than Delta asphalt
Celia spots Hilly and gives a self-conscious wave
William
The Lieutenant Governor just walked in
Hilly jumps up and pulls William away
The waiter returns with Stuart's drink and the water backs
So, what do you do with your time
write a
a domestic maintenance column for the Jackson Journal
Stuart smirks, taking a huge sip of his drink
You mean housekeeping
Skeeter nods and grabs her water
64
(') Jesus,  can't think of anything worse than reading a cleaning column
Except maybe writing one
-  - Hilly and William finish shaking hands with the Lieutenant Governor
As he walks away, Hilly shouts out
We'd love your support on election day
Celia and Johnny walk up
Hilly stiffens
Hilly, you look lovely tonight
Thank you, Johnny
William, have you ever met Celia
William steps forward and shakes Celia's hand
Nice to meet you
Hilly grabs the crook of William's arm
Sweetie, we need to go order our dinners
Celia musters up all the courage inside her
Hilly, did you ever get the messages that 've been calling you
did not
Well,  would love to help with the benefit
have a lovely hand if you need invitations addressed
"Save the dates" were mailed weeks ago
You didn't get one
Celia shakes her head
(') Mail's a lot slower way out there in the country, huh
65
(') ( ) Now, come on, before they run out of Trout Almondine
Hilly pulls William away
Johnny grabs Celia's hand
-   - Sounds like a ploy to find a husband
becoming an expert on keeping house
Well, you must be a genius
You figured out my whole scheme
Skeeter fumes as Hilly and William return and sit
What'd we miss
Isn't that what you women from Ole Miss major in
Professional husband hunting
'm sorry, but were you dropped on your head as an infant
Stuart blinks and then smiles, somewhat impressed
Desperate to change the subject, Hilly claps her hands
Who
Is
Hungry
Skeeter stands
Not me
kiss from God couldn't turn this `frog' into a `prince
' Tables begin to stare
Or you a `princess,' Sweetheart
As Skeeter walks away, she purposefully slides her purse into a glass of water, knocking it over into Stuart's lap
-   - Hilly and William each have a section of newspaper in their face as Yule May clears breakfast dishes
Yule May lingers nervously
66
Run on, now, Yule May
Got a big crowd coming for Miss Leefolt's baby shower
Miss Hilly,  would like to ask you and Mister William something
Hilly lowers her paper and nods
Yule May begins wrenching her hands
(') My twin boys finished high school, both on the honor roll
My husband and  have been saving for years to send them to college
Okay
Only now does William lower his paper
We are short seventy-five dollars on one of the tuitions
William stands up, kisses Hilly on the cheek
Well, 'm late
Gotta go
William leaves
Go on
Now
We're faced with having to choose
Which son gets to go
if we don't find all the money
Hilly draws in a deep breath as does Yule May
(') Would you consider givin' us a loan
'll
'll work for free until it's paid off
That's not working for free, Yule May
That's paying off a debt
Yes, ma'am
As a Christian, 'm going to do you a favor
Yule May's eyes widen as a hopeful smile forms
67
(') God doesn't give charity to those who are well and able
You need to come up with this money on your own
You'll thank me one day
Hilly raises the paper up to her face as Yule May exits
- Minny and Aibileen, in uniform, push carts side by side in the grocery store
The white shoppers are dressed casually
Other maids in the store (all required to be in uniform while shopping) keep quietly to themselves
White women smile and chat with one another as they meander down the aisles as if the black maids aren't even there
Minny suddenly spots Celia in the produce section
She pulls Aibileen close as they peer around the corner
That's her
Aibileen's mouth drops open at the sight of Celia's shorts and tight sweater
Celia is having trouble selecting produce
(') Lord, she's trying to shop
Celia walks up to a maid, grabs her, and pulls her to the tomatoes
The maid, clearly uncomfortable, selects a tomato, hands it to Celia, and scurries away
( ) Thanks, Doll
Miss Celia just don't see `em
The lines
Not between us, Miss Hilly, nobody
Aibileen just nods
(') What you so quiet for
know you got a opinion `bout all this
You gone accuse me a philosophizing
ain't afraid a no philosophy
68
don't believe in lines anymore
Lines is in our heads `cause people like Miss Hilly try to make us believe they there
Celia squeezes a canteloupe with another scared maid
Oh, they there
know
get punished for crossing them
- Aibileen and Minny continue their conversation while waiting with several other maids at a bus stop in front of the store
Lotta of folk think if you talk back to your husband, you crossed a line
need to be punished
You know  ain't studying no line like that
Cause it ain't there
`Cept in Leroy's head
Lines between black and white ain't there either
Minny and Aibileen watch as Celia exits the store with her groceries and prances toward her car
So,  ain't crossing no line if tell Miss Celia she ain't good enough for Miss Hilly
Tell her she ain't in Miss Hilly's league
All 'm saying is kindness don't have no boundaries
Just then,  , 30, (Medgar Evers wife) approaches the bus stop with her three Children
, 10 and 3, and a , 8
Aibileen and Minny nod as the Evers walk past and sit on a bench
(') Law, the Evers children have gotten so big
() Cause they happy
Myrlie got her a good man
And you better not try to say they ain't no line between her Medgar and my Leroy
69
No
You got me
bus pulls up and the doors open
Minny, Aibileen and the other maids step aside to let the Evers family board first
-   - Aibileen has come along to aid Yule May with Elizabeth's baby shower
table is set in the middle of the yard covered in white linens and Hilly's best sliver
Hilly's son sits on her lap
The other girls' children wear bathing suits jumping noisily in and out of two plastic kiddy pools
Yule May clears cake plates while Aibileen removes crumbs with a sterling crumb scraper
Mae Mobley wanders up to the table
Her belly almost looks distended crammed inside last year's one piece
Mae Mo hungry, Momma
Elizabeth turns to Mae Mobley but never gets up
She's always hungry
All the women laugh except for Skeeter
You know she can hear you, Elizabeth
Elizabeth looks down to her plate
Aibileen sets down the scraper and kneels down to Mae Mobley
'm on cut you some cake, Baby
Aibileen, we gave that scraper to Hilly and William for their wedding present
Chantilly
It so pretty
Hilly begins bouncing William Jr
on her knee
Aibileen, are you enjoying your new bathroom over at Elizabeth's
Hilly nods with a tight smile and glances to the ground at Skeeter's red satchel
70
(') Nice to have your own, isn't it
Yes, ma'am
Separate but equal
That's what Ross Barnett says, and you can't argue with the Governor
Not in Mississippi
Birthplace of modern day government
Hilly narrows her eyes at Skeeter and turns to Aibileen
Aibileen, did you know that me and Mister Holbrook arranged for that bathroom
Sent the boys over and the equipment, too
Hilly stays on Aibileen, waiting for her to say something
Skeeter fumes, hoping Aibileen doesn't say it
Yes, ma'am
And  thank you
Hilly smiles and nods
Well
You
Are
Welcome
Hilly shoots Skeeter a last look
William Jr
leans into Hilly and hugs her
(
) One thing  got to say about Miss Hilly, she love her children
Always tellin' them they smart and beautiful
Can't go more than ten minutes without givin' one a kiss
Hilly kisses her son gently
(
) (') And, law, do they love her back
When she starts up on me,  just try and think a my sweet Treelore and how much he loved me
That kind a love makes me cry
Even when it going to Miss Hilly
Hilly again glances to the red satchel, staring quizzically at the worn booklet of The Jim Crow laws sticking out
-  - Yule May washes dishes as the women are heard saying their "good-byes" on the street
Skeeter slips into the kitchen
71
May  get you something
No, thanks
() Yule May,  wanted to talk to you
Yule May turns off the sink faucet making sure Hilly is still cackling out on the street
know what you want to ask, Miss Skeeter
Aibileen and Minny already did
Yule May closes the kitchen door
(') 'm trying to get my boys off to college
It's worthwhile what y'all doing, but my boys are worth more
understand
(
) What do you "understand," Skeeter
Skeeter and Yule May turn to find Hilly standing in the swinging door leading into the dining room
Ah
Yule May was just telling me how excited she was that her boys were going to go to college
Is that true, Yule May
Yes, Ma'am
Skeeter notices that Hilly is holding the booklet of Jim Crow laws in her hand
Did you also ask Miss Skeeter if you could borrow money
Of course not, Hilly
Hilly approaches Skeeter
Skeeter, 'm starting to think you're intentionally not putting my initiative in the newsletter
Eyes down, Yule May hurries out of the kitchen
72
Not at all
'm just so busy right now with Mom
Skeeter
'm sorry about your mother
And  know you must be so worried
Hilly holds up the Jim Crow booklet
(') But 'm worried about you
All this carrying on lately and now you're reading this stuff
My dad had me get that for him
mean, around your friends is one thing
But, believe it or not, there are real racists in this town
If the wrong person caught you with this
you'd be in serious trouble
Skeeter snatches the booklet from Hilly
Thanks, Hilly
And thanks for going through my things
- '  - Skeeter types feverishly while smoking a cigarette
Keys type out: "Home Help Sanitation Initiative
" Skeeter picks up Hilly's document and shakes her head
She types: Don't risk your children's and family's health
-   - Yule May vacuums
She pulls the sofa away from the wall to clean beneath it
Noticing something on the floor, Yule May leans over
She rises holding a
Years of dust and hair blanket the pitiful gem set in ten karat gold
The vacuum seems to roar louder now
Yule May breathes heavily
She shoves the ring into her uniform pocket
- '  - As Skeeter bangs away on her typewriter, Charlotte bursts into the room, stuck somewhere between panic and joy
73
Skeeter
What
Don't panic, but there's a very tall man named Stuart here for you
He's a drunken asshole, Mother
You wouldn't like him
Charlotte pulls a sun dress out of Skeeter's closet
Skeeter, love and hate are two horns on the same goat
And, you need a goat
-   - Skeeter, Charlotte and Stuart sit in the living room
Pascagoula serves finger sandwiches
Stuart looks nice in khaki pants, a blue blazer and a red tie
His nose is pink from working in the sun
No one says a word
Finally
Stuart, would you like a cocktail
Skeeter shoots her mother a "What the
" look
No, Ma'am
Little too early
Ha
Charlotte moves on
What's your last name, Stuart
Whitworth
Hmm
Where are you from
Natchez
Really
Well,  know a Whitworth from Natchez
But he's a Senator up in Washington
74
Yes, Ma'am
That's my daddy
Who is
Senator Whitworth
That's my father
Charlotte's jaw drops to her string of pearls
Really
Stuart nods
Charlotte stands, flustered yet joyful
(') Well
tell him  said "Hello"
'm going to go see if Pascagoula needs some help in the kitchen
Charlotte backs away behind Stuart's chair
She points at Skeeter violently, as if to say, '
-   - Skeeter and Stuart stand beneath an old Cypress tree as Charlotte peeps from an upstairs window
Look
know it was a few weeks back, but  came here to say 'm sorry for the way  acted
Who sent you
William or Hilly
Neither
was rude, and 've been thinking about it a lot
Well,  haven't
So, just go
Now, look
told Hilly  wasn't ready to go out on any date wasn't even close to ready
Stuart shoves his hands in his pockets like a boy
(') was engaged last year
She ended it
Skeeter refuses to pity him
75
(') We'd been dating since we were fifteen
You know how it is
Actually,  don't
've never dated anyone before
Stuart looks up and starts laughing loudly
Well
That must be it then
What
've never met a woman that said exactly what she was thinking
've got plenty to say
Would you like to
come downtown with me and have dinner
We could talk
We could listen to each other this time
can't think of anything worse
Stuart looks down and nods
Then, 'm sorry
That's what came to say and
said it
Stuart turns and walks towards his car, self-consciously weaving his strong fingers through his hair
Skeeter looks up to her mother's empty window and shouts out to Stuart
Just give me a minute
Stuart turns
(') Let me get my sweater
-   - Skeeter and Stuart sit closely as the same waiter as before approaches
What do you want, Skeeter
76
'll have a Co-cola
Lots of ice
No,  mean in life
What do you want
Only now does Skeeter notice the tray of champagne the waiter is holding
Stuart nods as two glasses are set before them
The waiter leaves
want to be a journalist
Maybe a novelist
Maybe both
like that
've been thinking about you
You're smart, you're pretty, you're
tall
Pretty
Yes
And  read your column
Very informative
() never knew Crisco got rid of diaper rash
Skeeter laughs and slaps him playfully
(') hope you get to write something really good, Skeeter
Something you believe in
Stuart suddenly leans over and kisses Skeeter
-- - Stuart and Skeeter make out  in the back of the Holbrook's convertible
Hilly and William sit in the front
Hilly peers into the rearview mirror to get a better view
Proud of herself, she pats William's leg
William slides his hand up Hilly's leg
She jerks it away
-  - Aibileen sits on the kitchen floor next to a bucket
She feverishly scours grease off the baseboards
Elizabeth's car pulls up
Aibileen smiles
Baby girl home
77
The car door slams shut
(
) Aibileen
My trunk's full
Aibileen rises slowly, placing a hand on her knee
Outside, Elizabeth suddenly shouts out hysterically
(
) (') Mae Mobley
No
Stop
Aibileen panics
She gets up, looks out the window
- Mae Mobley sits on Aibileen's toilet in the garage
Door wide open, pants around her ankles
Me and Aibiee bafroom, Momma
Elizabeth runs over and yanks Mae Mobley off, popping her hard on the behind
It
Is
Not
Mae Mobley begins to cry
Aibileen watches as Elizabeth hiss- whispers and yanks Mae Mobley hard on the arm
(') This is dirty out here
You'll catch diseases
Elizabeth punctuates with three more slaps to her legs
(') No
No
No
-   - Aibileen sits on the couch with Mae Mobley who eats a cookie
Mae Mobley's face is red and damp
'm here, baby girl
Aibee's here
Aibileen kisses her on the cheek
(') You is kind
You is smart
You is important
You want me to tell you one a our secret stories
Mae Mobley nods
The phone rings
Aibileen rises
(
) got it
78
Aibileen sits back down and leans into Mae Mobley
One day this wise Martian come down to Earth to teach us people a thing or two
Martian
How big
Oh, he about six-two
What's his name
Martian Luther King
What did he look like
Looked just like us, nose, mouth, hair on his head
But, sometimes people looked at him funny and were just downright mean to him
Why Aibee
Why was they so mean
`Cause he was green
Elizabeth suddenly barges into the living room
Aibileen
Come on
We have to go help Hilly
Now
Come on
Elizabeth runs outside
Aibileen grabs Mae Mobley
- Elizabeth wobbles briskly up the street holding her pregnant belly
Aibileen and Mae Mobley follow
stream of people walk toward them, laughing
They round a corner to see   , in every shape and color imaginable, littering Hilly's lawn
Some have towering tanks with chain pulls at the top, providing amusement to the procession of cars driving by
The Holbrook's station wagon sits in the driveway, doors still open with  tied to the roof
Two    struggle to remove a toilet under William's supervision
79
Aibileen hides her smile
Mae Mobley points
Look
Look, Aibee
Hilly flies out of her house as a  snaps a picture of her
Get out of here
Hilly pushes him in the bushes and runs up to Elizabeth
(') Skeeter
She put it in the newsletter
specifically said old coats are to be dropped at my house
Not commodes
Hilly faces the toilets again and screams
(') She put it in the newsletter when she knew we'd be down at the beach
Hilly steps up to Aibileen and points to the old men
(') Go help those boys - Aibileen rides in the back of a bus with a
Two white men sit right behind the white driver
The bus slows to a stop in the middle of the road
In the distance, blue lights flash in front of a road block
few people gather
'all stay put
Let me find out what's going on
As the driver gets up, a - news truck whizzes by followed by a police motorcycle
Aibileen leans in the aisle and looks ahead
The driver returns
The young black man speaks up
What happen up there, Mister
Colored people off
White people lemme know where y'all are going
'll get you as close as  can
80
As the young black man helps Aibileen down the aisle, a white passenger taps the driver on the shoulder
What's going on
Aibileen and the young man walk down the stairs
don't know
Some nigger got shot
Where you headed
The bus door shuts and the driver backs away
- Aibileen and the young man walk along a dark street
The sound of cicadas and sirens fill the air
You all right
You close to home
be all right
My house is seven blocks from here
Want me to walk you
Naw, thank ya
'll be fine
Law, hope this ain't as bad as- Aibileen turns to discover the young man is gone
She stares into the darkness
Scared, she begins to run
She cuts through a yard and trips over a hedge
She falls hard to her knees
Terrified, Aibileen begins to sob
She sees Minny's porch light and pulls herself up
'  -  - Minny sits with all five of her children, Sugar,  , 12, , 10, , 6, and , 4
They all listen anxiously to a radio on the table
Aibileen opens the screen door and falls to the floor
Minny jumps up to help her
She sees blood and grass stains streaking the knees of Aibileen's panty hose
Aibileen
You okay
Aibileen nods, trying to compose herself
81
(
) Almost ten years serving as the Field Secretary for the Medgar Evers is dead
Aibileen swallows hard
shot him
Hour ago
Right in front a his children, Aibileen
We gone pray for the Evers
We gone pray for Myrlie
Minny raises her fists
We living in hell
We trapped
Our kids is trapped
Minny turns to Sugar
(') Take your brother and sister and go get in my bed
Stay there
Sugar leads the kids to the back of the house
(') What they gone do to us if they catch us with Miss Skeeter
We gone be careful
Hitch us to a pickup and drag us behind
Shoot me front a my kids
We ain't doing civil rights with Miss Skeeter
We just tellin' stories like they really happen
Minny and Aibileen grab hands and squeeze hard
You a fool, old woman
fool
Aibileen hugs Minny
(') can't believe 'm on say this
But,  actually wish Leroy was home right now
Aibileen and Minny laugh a little through the tears
82
-  - Elaine Stein sits at her desk flipping through the New York Times
She notices something, actually laughs
: picture shows Hilly standing among the fifty toilets in her front yard
caption reads: "Come on by, have a seat
" Home of William and Hilly Holbrook, Jackson, Mississippi
- Stuart, on the deck of an offshore oil rig, laughs as he looks at Hilly's picture inside a local newspaper
He writes on the back of a postcard addressed to Skeeter: guess you potty trained Hilly
Much love, Stuart
-   - Skeeter parks and gets out of her car
She suddenly finds herself face to face with Hilly
You are sick
Do not speak to me
Do not look at me
Don't say hello to my children
How long had you been planning to humiliate my family
That's not it, Hilly
You thought you were so clever, didn't ya
But 've already installed three of those old toilets in people's garages
Technically, it was a typo, Hilly
intend to tell Stuart he's ruining his reputation by associating with you
Jolene's yard boy saw you hanging around the colored bus stop
wasn't hanging- 83
guess your car was in the shop
Skeeter looks away
(') You know as well as  do, people won't buy so much as a slice of pound cake from an organization that harbors racial integrationists
Skeeter steps forward
Hilly, just who is that pound cake money being raised for, anyway
Hilly rolls her eyes

" Skeeter nods and walks away
Hilly shouts out
(') Just so you know, Lou Ann Templeton has taken your seat at bridge club
-   - Minny walks in, notices it's eerily quiet
Miss Celia
-  - Minny walks into Celia's bedroom
Miss Celia, you in here
Minny hears running water and muffled crying behind the bathroom door
She presses her ear to the door
(') Hello
You sick
Minny twists the knob
It's locked
(
) 'm fine
Minny
Go on home for the day
You mess up your hair coloring again
helped you fix it last time, got it back real pretty
84
Celia yells at Minny for the very first time
(
) said go home, Minny
Minny sees water creeping out from under the door
She steps back and charges, shoulder first
-  - The bathroom door bursts open with splinters of wood
Minny slips in a pool of watered down blood
Celia sits against the wall in a bloody nightgown
Miss Celia
Celia aimlessly moves the blood around with a wash cloth
There's so much blood
Why is there so much blood this time
Minny crawls over, peers into the toilet bowl and gags
(') Please, Minny
Will you get it out
can't look at it again
Shaken, Minny reaches for a trash can
She puts her hand on Celia's neck and pushes it down
Keep your head down
-  - Celia lies in bed while Minny presses a cool rag to her forehead
Celia stares out of her bedroom window
' : The two rosebushes stand in the middle of the front lawn

Give her another pill if she gets too agitated
There'll be more bleeding, but don't call me unless it's heavy
Minny nods as the doctor leaves
We got married because  was pregnant
But it slipped out too
85
That's just God's way
Next one's gonna catch
Johnny wants kids now
thought if  was real still, brought somebody in to do the house and cooking, maybe 'd hold on to this one
Oh, Minny, what's he gonna do with me
He gone have to get over this
He needs to know this takes time
He doesn't know about this one, or the one before
Minny turns to Celia, stunned by this revelation
Minny, you know how to play bridge, don't you
Minny nods
Yes, ma'am

Celia lowers the box in the grave, covering it with dirt
-   - Celia and Minny sit at a card table holding playing cards
Two additional hands lay face up on the table in front of two empty chairs across from them
Minny lays down one of her cards then looks over to Celia's hand
She removes a card from Celia's and lays it down
She then points to the hand next to Celia
Celia nods
-   - Hilly stands at her podium, tan and ready to lead
She holds her gavel like a weapon
Okay
First order of business
We're updating our newsletter
Hilly stares right at Skeeter who sits alone in the back
87
(') We're adding a fashion column with all the latest trends
Your dresses better be cute at next week's benefit
The women applaud and tap each other on their thighs
(') Now it's time to choose a new editor for our new modern monthly

Jolene looks back and snarls at Skeeter
Jolene, you're the sweetest thing

All in favor of Hilly, say "Aye
" The room erupts
Aye
Skeeter's ousting took less than ten seconds
Elizabeth secretly turns to Skeeter from a few rows ahead
() 'm so sorry
-   - Skeeter sits alone on the porch swing in her nightgown, shifting through the Miss Myrna letters
Charlotte steps onto the porch
Honey, would you like me to drop you off at bridge club on the way to my doctor's appointment
() No, Ma'am
It's been cancelled
Mae Mobley's sick or something
88
-   - Bridge is underway at the Leefolt house
Aibileen enters holding a tray of coffee cups
Elizabeth, Hilly, Jolene and several other girls giggle as they kneel down behind furniture
Everything okay
Elizabeth looks back
Her belly is huge
Shhh
There's a knock at door
(
) Elizabeth, it's me, Celia Foote was in the neighborhood and thought 'd drop by
The girls giggle more loudly now
Celia peers into the living room window
The bridge tables are in plain view
Celia's face grows pinker than her sweater
(') brought you a chocolate pie
My maid, Minny, made it
Hilly's face hardens
-  - Minny stands at the sink shelling peas
distinct red cut is perched above her swollen eye
Celia sits at the kitchen table halfway through the pie
They made me stand there like the vacuum man
Why, Minny
Minny freezes, keeping her face on the peas
Because they know about you getting knocked up by Mister Johnny
They mad you married one a they mens
Especially since Mister Johnny and Miss Hilly had just broke up, too
So, Hilly probably thinks  was fooling around with Johnny while they were still going steady
89
Missus Walters says Miss Hilly still sweet on Mister Johnny, too
Celia suddenly slaps her thigh with excitement
No wonder
They don't hate me
They hate what they think did
They hate you cause they think you're white trash
And don't be takin' pies to those women
Well, 'm just going to have to let Hilly know 'm not a boyfriend stealer
In fact, 'll tell her Friday night at the benefit
Celia rises and smiles like she just cured cancer
Now, Miss Celia
please don't be going to that benefit
Celia gets some ice out of the fridge
(') Did you hear what  said
Celia places the ice in a towel and approaches Minny
She looks at the cut above her eye
(') What are you doing
That looks bad
got to get my work done
know you didn't fall in the tub, Minny
Let me take a look
Celia grabs Minny's hand
Minny pulls away
Just then Johnny pulls up in the driveway
Celia and Minny turn to the window, then spring into action
-  - Minny sits crouched on the lid of the guest bath toilet as Johnny chases Celia around the house
Celia giggles
90
(
) Come here, Sexy
(
) Johnny, you are bad
Bad
Bad
Minny looks at the ridiculous image of herself crouching on the toilet in the bathroom mirror
She raises Celia's ice rag up to her swollen eye
'  -  - Skeeter enters quietly through Aibileen's kitchen door
She is surprised to see twenty other black women standing solemnly around the kitchen and the living room
Aibileen approaches with a worried look
What's wrong
Yule May in prison, Miss Skeeter
Gone be there four years
Minny shouts out across the kitchen
Hilly Holbrook been sent from the devil to ruirn all our lives
() -   - Hilly and the usual suspects play bridge at Hilly's house
Aibileen pours coffee an earshot away

Hilly leads the girls' nods of acknowledgement

'  -  - As Minny wipes her nose with her sleeve, Skeeter approaches
'll ask daddy to get her a good lawyer

She had a lawyer

The women part, making way as Aibileen leads Skeeter to a seat at the kitchen table

Another  walks over

Another woman speaks from the living room

Women of all ages slowly rise up and nod their heads
Skeeter looks around in awe
Thank you

'  -  - Skeeter sits and writes as Pearly begins the interviews

Doctor Dixon went and paid that farmer double for two a those acres
Told him he `bout to start farmin' too
But he bought it just for me
So could get to work easy
He did
Skeeter closes her eyes for moment
When she opens them she sees Constantine smiles and grabs Skeeter's hand
She presses her thumb firmly in her palm
When Skeeter blinks again, the vision is gone
Standing in place of Constantine is , 26
All these colored women have been real nice, haven't they
Yes
Very nice
Well, they hate you
You know this
Every little thing about you
But you're so dumb, you think you're doing them a favor
Skeeter and the other maids are taken aback
You don't have to do this
You know the nicest thing a white woman's ever done for me
Gave me the heel of her bread
These women are playing a trick on you
They'll never tell you the truth
93
You don't know what they've said
Say it, lady, say the word you think every time one us stands in front of you
Nigger
Aibileen crosses over to Gretchen
That's enough, Gretchen
You just as dumb as she is
Get out a my house
'  -   - Aibileen sits with Skeeter on the sofa reading and answering Miss Myrna letters
Aibileen is dressed very nicely
Several flower arrangements are placed around the room
An unwrapped present rests on the coffee table
Tell her to pour vinegar in her trash cans
Then them dogs will stay away
As Skeeter writes this down, someone walks onto Aibileen's front porch
Skeeter becomes worried
Aibileen looks to a wall clock and smiles
About a dozen letters and cards fall into a basket under the mail slot
Aibileen jumps up and starts sorting through the cards
(') Today my birthday, Miss Skeeter
Well, happy birthday, Aibileen
You should have told me
And, from all over the county, my babies find they way home
Aibileen stops on one card in particular
She sits back down next to Skeeter
(') Some even from overseas
Alton Spears lives in Paris now
Married him a real pretty French girl
Got five kids, too
they's my grandbabies
94
Aibileen opens the card to find a twenty dollar bill inside along with a picture of the Spears family
Aibileen reads the card aloud
(') still don't drink coffee
Happy Birthday
Love Alton
Aibileen laughs and raises her hand to her mouth
Skeeter is touched
The doorbell rings
Aibileen jumps up and opens the door delivery man greets her with two more vases of flowers
Aibileen looks out to the street where a white woman gets out of her car with a huge country ham
Two little girls in matching dresses jump out behind her
The woman sees Aibileen on the porch and waves
Aibileen waves back and smiles
Catching it all, the moment soon grows bittersweet for Skeeter
She wipes her eye
- '  - 3 Morning light shines into Skeeter's room
Stuart has returned from the rig
Fully clothed, he and Skeeter sleep on Skeeter's bed
Charlotte shouts Skeeter's name from down the hall
(
) Eugenia
Skeeter's eyes pop open
She's groggy and hasn't fully realized the company lying next to her
What
Stuart throws his arm over Skeeter
Reality sinks in
Skeeter rolls over to find Stuart, eyes shut, smiling
(') Oh my God
Oh my God
When Stuart tries to get up, Skeeter flattens him reaches down and pulls the covers up over his entire body
(') Don't move a muscle
Skeeter props up on her side and faces the door making sure the covers hide that she's clothed
Charlotte enters and heads straight for Skeeter's closet
Morning, Sleepy Head
95
Morning, Mom
Charlotte pulls out a dress and lays it on the bed, right on top of Stuart
thought you could take me to the doctor this morning and then we could get some lunch afterwards
Sure
Charlotte spies a   sticking out of the covers
It belongs to Stuart, but she assumes it's Skeeter's
(looking at toe) Or
we could
go straight to Fanny Mae's for a girl day
Great
'll get dressed
When did Stuart leave last night
Right after you went to bed
Well,  hope he knows he's welcome to stay in Carlton's old room
'm not really ready for that yet
"Bird in the hand," Eugenia

We hear archival footage of Walter Cronkite addressing the nation

Celia runs into the living room
Tears stream down her face
Minny turns to Celia
Cronkite tells the nation that John

She grabs on to Oscar's body and slides down to the floor
- Hilly sits with her son William playing on a blanket on the front lawn

He leans out and tells Hilly the tragic news
In complete disbelief, Hilly puts her hand over her mouth

They're all crying
Some throw their hands in the air
-   - Skeeter and Stuart sit solemnly with the Phelan family watching Cronkite's coverage of the Kennedy funeral
Skeeter's dad wipes tears from his eyes
Stuart checks the time and leans into Skeeter's ear
97
Honey, 'm sorry, but  have to get down to the coast
Skeeter nods as Stuart kisses her
(') 'll be back in time for the benefit
Love you
You, too
We hear Walter Cronkite's parting thoughts on
'  -  - Minny, Skeeter and Aibileen sit quietly compiling stories
Aibileen and Minny look up to Aibileen's framed picture of John
Kennedy
Aibileen grows anxious
She suddenly jumps out of her chair and paces around the kitchen
Are you okay
The world done gone crazy, Miss Skeeter
And 'm scared
What if folks find out what we writing
Figure out Niceville really Jackson, and figure out who who
Aibileen
We've changed all the names
Aibileen snaps
'all two gone sit there and tell me you one hundred percent without a doubt sure `bout all this

No
So  been thinking
Maybe we need us some insurance
Skeeter look to Minny

But we got no choice
It's time
Time to tell you both "the terrible awful"  did to Miss Hilly
It might be the only thing to protect us
98
() -  - 6 We continue with the earlier flashback where Minny arrives at Hilly's with her famed chocolate pie
Hilly leads Minny into the kitchen, Missus Walters follows behind
Hilly slices a big piece and grabs a fork
She leans against the counter and takes a big bite
Nobody wanted to hire a sass- mouthing, thieving nigra, did they
Minny stands silent as Hilly finishes in three bites
(') Pie's as good as always, Minny
'm glad you like it
Hilly cuts another piece for herself
If
take you back, 'll have to cut your pay five dollars a week
Not expecting this, Minny leans away from Hilly
Take me back
Hilly takes an even bigger bite from the second slice
What do you put in here that makes it taste so good
That good vanilla from Mexico
Minny's eyes narrow over a forced smile
(') And
something else real special
Missus Walters grabs a plate and reaches for the pie
(') No, Missus Walters
That Miss Hilly's special pie
Momma can have a piece
Hilly slides the pie a little too fast down the counter toward Minny
Minny stops it before it falls to the floor
(') Cut her one
99
() Eat my shit
Hilly calmly sets her plate down on the counter
What did you say
said eat my shit
Have you lost your mind
Minny moves toward Hilly
No
But you're about to, `cause you just did
Minny nods smugly as she looks down at Hilly's slice
Did what
Missus Walters immediately gets it
She bursts out laughing so hard she has to lower herself to the floor
Well, Hilly, that's what you get, guess
And you didn't just eat one
You ate two slices
Hilly starts to hyperventilate as everything sinks in
As Minny leaves, Hilly runs to the sink and throws up
'  -  - Aibileen and Skeeter are speechless
You trying to get yourself killed
No
never planned to tell her
just wanted to see her take a bite and leave so  could be done with her
Forever
She was never supposed to ask me back
Minny eyes narrow
(') And, then for less pay
That got me even madder
And, then she went slid that pie at me
Oh lord
That was it
just lost control, Aibileen
you know how  get, now
100
(') So, before  knew it, it just came on out my mouth
and  had tolt her what was in that pie
Aibileen looks to Skeeter shaking her head
Minny suddenly gets misty
She wipes her eyes
(') 've asked God to forgive me
But, more for what happened to poor Missus Walters
Miss Hilly threw her in that nursing home just for laughing
() We can't put that story in the book
It's too dangerous, Minny
We need insurance
Hilly Holbrook can't never let people know that pie story is about her
Exactly
If people find out "The Terrible Awful" was you and Miss Hilly, then we in trouble
Trouble there ain't words for
Right
But don't you see
Miss Hilly gone go to her grave convincing people this book ain't about Jackson
Then we safe, insured
Minny gets up and walks toward Aibileen
(') You brought me into this, and 'm on finish it
Either put it in or pull my parts out all together
Minny storms out of Aibileen's kitchen

The last editor's meeting is December 17th
If you want a chance of this getting read,  need it in my hands by then
But that's in a week, Miss Stein

Otherwise it goes in The Pile
You don't want it in The Pile
Yes, Ma'am
And you must get a piece in about the domestic who raised you
It'll add something personal to it
Skeeter nods with frustration
-  - The African Children's Benefit Ball is well underway
The energy and look of the two hundred attendees feel like a throwback to the women's suffrage movement
Many older women wear heavy long black skirts and jackets
Hilly wears swathes of maroon-colored taffeta
Ruffles clutch her throat
She stands next to Jolene French and a Dressed to the nines, Jolene raises a microphone and looks into the camera
This is Jolene French reporting from the African Children's Benefit Ball, and 'm here with League President Miss Hilly Holbrook
Thanks, Jolene
Three dozen servers stand in a line
Minny and Aibileen are among them
Tables are covered with items donated for the auction
On the baked goods table, Minny's famed chocolate pie promises to again be a big money maker
Celia and Johnny enter the ballroom
Celia wears a hideous, pink and silver sequined gown
As usual, Celia's breasts command attention
The room locks on Celia as specks of light bounce off her dress and jiggle across the ceiling
tips his martini onto his wife's shoe
(a little too loudly) Look at the jugs on that one
102
Other wives dig fingernails into husbands' arms
The man's wife responds louder
Bosoms are for bedrooms and breast- feeding
Not occasions of dignity
Celia downs a glass of champagne and leans into Johnny
Do you think  might have overdressed a little
It's supposed to be formal, but this looks like a funeral
You look gorgeous
Minny pulls Aibileen aside and points to Celia
Look what she got on
Celia grabs more champagne from a passing server
Lord have mercy
Ladies better hold onto they husbands tonight
Celia catches eyes with Minny
She smiles and nods quickly and then looks away, careful not to tip off Johnny of their relationship
( ) And that's the man that don't even know he's paying me
Skeeter enters with Stuart
She wears a long-sleeved black velvet dress and her hair is being somewhat cooperative
There's Skeeter and that must be Stuart
He's handsome
Missus Walters
Missus Walters enters wearing a floor-length blue beaded gown, circa 1943

Hilly can throw her in a home, but she can't keep the taxis away

Celia is now drinking some kind of pink drink with an umbrella sticking out of it
Well, hello, Elizabeth
103
Hi
Elizabeth's homemade maternity ball gown resembles a velvet potato sack cinched with red ribbon
Those are lovely dresses
Yours too
Really

Jolene reaches out an pats Celia's shoulder
Oh, no
You're just perfect
Elizabeth pulls Jolene away
Celia downs her drink

Scores of black servers dressed in tuxedos ferry plates
Hilly makes her way to the podium
Everybody enjoying their dinner
The room claps enthusiastically
(') () Let's give a nice round of applause for all the men and women that have helped make tonight possible
Hilly mechanically gestures toward the servers in the room
(') cause 'm sure is dear to their hearts as well
Skeeter shakes her head as the less inspired applause dies down
Celia waves to Minny and jumps out of her chair
Woo-hoo
Johnny grabs Celia by the arm and pulls her back down
Celia reaches for Johnny's glass of wine
Honey, maybe you've had enough to drink
Try to eat your dinner
104
And have my stomach poke out
- As Celia looks at the prize table's bids, Johnny and Stuart lean against a bar chatting with a few other bored men
Hilly suddenly slides next to Johnny completely ignoring Stuart
Why, Johnny Foote
'm surprised to see you here
Everybody knows you can't stand parties like this
Hilly squeezes the crook of his arm
Celia wouldn't have missed this for anything
Where is that wife of yours
Out selling hotdogs
Johnny looks away
(') Oh, you know 'm teasing you
We dated long enough where  can do that, can't
Johnny walks away leaving Hilly no choice but to acknowledge Stuart
She and Stuart never look each other's way
(') () Stuart
() Hilly
Hilly walks away as Jolene approaches the podium
've got the list of winners
-  - Jolene finishes up the winners list
hope you enjoy your new set of tires, Missus Atwell
Now, on to the baked goods
Jolene flips a page
105
(') Oh, yum
Yum
The highest bid in baked goods goes to Minny Jackson's chocolate pie
Congratulations, Hilly Holbrook
The room erupts in applause
Hilly now sits at a table with her family, Missus Walters, and the Leefolts
Skeeter and Stuart sit at a table full of elderly people they don't know
Minny clears dishes nearby
Hearing her name, she becomes very alert
What
didn't bid on anything
Minny turns to find Hilly smiling at her tightly
(') Well, wasn't that sweet
Someone signed me up for that pie
( ) Oh, no
Celia rushes up behind Hilly, her voice slurred
Congratulations, Hilly
didn't know you're a fan of Minny's pies
Hilly remains calm
Celia grabs Hilly's long sleeve
(') 've wanted to talk to you all night
Minny told me why you won't be my friend
You think me and Johnny went behind your back
Let me go
Hilly stands up and pulls away
ripping sound cuts through the air
Celia stares at Hilly's torn cuff in her hands
Oh, God
'm so sorry
( ) What are you trying to do to me
What are you and that nigra up to
106
Jolene announces another round of winners loudly over the microphone, forcing Celia to raise her voice
don't know what you- -You liar
Who did you tell
Jolene loses her place on the list
The room grows quiet but Celia is still yelling
Hilly,  got pregnant after you and Johnny broke up
The room echoes with Celia's words
Across the room, women's noses wrinkle
Oh, shit
Shut up, Mother
Stuart belts out with a laugh
Skeeter pinches his arm
Celia is mortified
Sweat beads on her forehead
Johnny never cheated on you
At least, not with me
Celia starts to breathe heavily
Her eyes start to water
Johnny would never- And 'm sorry  thought you'd be tickled to win that pie
You tell that nigra if she tells anybody,  will make her suffer
Horrified, Skeeter catches eyes with Minny and Aibileen
They all immediately look away
Johnny makes his way over
Celia holds her breath, shaking her head back and forth
Celia, what's wrong, Honey
Uh-oh
Celia leans over and vomits on the fleur-de-lis print carpet
The entire room gasps in horror
107
Oh, shit
Johnny tries to pull Celia back
She pushes Johnny away and runs for the bathroom
He follows
Hilly marches over to Aibileen who is standing nearby
Get that cleaned up before it starts to smell
Yes, ma'am
-  - Minny's daughter, Sugar, stands over a large commercial sink filled with sudsy water, washing dishes
Minny approaches from behind as Sugar holds court with five other young girls
That big-boobed lady Momma works for was drunker than an Injun on payday
Upchucked in front a everbody
As the girls all laugh, Minny pops Sugar hard on the back of her head
Don't you never let me hear you talking bad about the lady who puts food in your mouth
Clothes on your back
You hear me
Minny storms off
( ) You do it all the time
-   - Hilly and William walk to their car
Missus Walters follows closely behind, holding Minny's pie
Just come on home and stay with us tonight, Mother
No thanks,  got a pie to eat
Hilly spins around and sees the pie
108
You throw that pie away right now
spent good money on this
Won it just for you
You
You signed me up
Missus Walters steps up to Hilly
may have trouble remembering my own name and what country  live in
But there's two things  can't seem to forget
That my own daughter threw me in a nursing home
And that she ate Minny's shit
Missus Walters winks at Hilly and ambles to a waiting taxi cab
-  - Celia lies in bed with the covers pulled over her face
Minny enters carrying a tray of food, setting it down next to two other trays of uneaten food
Ain't Mister Johnny gone wonder how dinner got on the table if you laid up in bed
Celia pulls the covers off her head and sits up a little
The way Hilly looked at me
Like was trash on the road
Celia pulls a letter out from under the covers
(') She billed me for her dress
In lieu of payment, she's asked that send two-hundred dollars to the African Children's Fund and then she banned me from all future League events
She don't count
Don't judge yourself by the way she see you
'm not right for this kind of life, Minny
don't need a dinner table for twelve people
109
(') couldn't get two people over here if  begged
She called me a liar and accused me of getting her that pie
wouldn't have thrown up if it wasn't for that
can't do this anymore to Johnny
'm going back to Sugar Ditch
You gone leave your husband cause you threw up at some party
Celia sobs
(') Lord,  reckon it's time you knew
-  - Celia stares at Minny, wide-eyed and disgusted
Miss Hilly thought you knew `bout "The Terrible Awful," that you were making fun a her
It's my fault she pounced on you
But if you leave Mister Johnny, then Miss Hilly done won the whole ball game
Then she done beat me, and she done beat you
Celia lies there
Minny's concerned she's said too much
Thank you
For telling me that

spoke to your dad, and he's gonna have Jameso drive you down right now
Oh, Stuart
What
have to work
Work in the car
Jesus, Skeeter, it's a cleaning column
have a deadline, Sweetie
You should have asked me about this
'm trying to be romantic
'm sorry, Honey
can't come
Stuart shakes his head and hangs up the phone
'  - Aibileen and Skeeter sit across from,  , 101, palsied and gray skinned and hunched in a wheelchair
Aibileen grabs Faye Belle's hand stirring a sudden flash of memory
Her voice is coarse and hard to understand
remember hiding with Miss Lilia in a steamer trunk while Yankee soldiers stomped through Master's house
We were both four
Eighty- five years later she died in my arms
We's were friends `til the end
Her grandson still pays my rent
Buys all my groceries too
'  -  - The manuscript sits before Aibileen, Minny and Skeeter
111
have one more story to type, but other than that, we are done
Law, look at all them pages
Two- hundred and sixty-six of `em
Now we just wait and see
Hopin' Missus Stein publish it
Skeeter nods
(') What story you got left to type
Mine
Aibileen looks at Skeeter
If your momma won't tell you, reckon  will
-  - Red-eyed, Skeeter enters Charlotte's room
bowl rests on the bedside table with a wet rag draped over the side
Charlotte is wig free and terribly thin
Her collarbone protrudes long and narrow, but her eyes are as sharp as ever
Have you been crying
You know that ages your skin, Dear
Mother,  need to talk to you about Constantine
Oh, Eugenia
That was so long ago
Well,  have to speak to her
Now, you look
was good to Constantine
Oh, she talked back plenty of times, and  put up with it
But, Skeeter, she didn't give me a choice
What
happened
112
()   - Charlotte, much healthier, scurries around the house adjusting flower arrangements and straightening pictures
(
) was hosting a
luncheon
Constantine was to do the floors that morning so they'd be dry in time
Charlotte finds Constantine mopping the foyer very slowly
The effects of arthritis are apparent
(
) (') Well, the floors were soaking wet when the first guest arrived
guest unnecessarily grabs a table for balance, making a point about the damp floor
()   - Charlotte sits with twelve women at the dining table as Constantine pushes the casserole cart around and begins serving lunch
As the guests sip coffee, each woman grimaces and turns to Charlotte
(
) Then, she burned the coffee
She had gotten so old, Skeeter
Charlotte shoots Constantine a look
Constantine nods sorrowfully
She picks up a woman's plate and begins filling it with food from the cart very slowly
Constantine strains to lower the plate in front of the woman
Her hands tremble
(
) (') Her mishaps were becoming a daily occurrence, and  had had it
The plate tilts causing peas to pour into the woman's lap
Watch out
With that, Charlotte stands up and slaps the table with her hand
Get a hold of yourself, Constantine
Constantine slowly looks to Charlotte
Totally exhausted, she grips the casserole cart with both hands to steady herself
113
(
) (') And that's when it happened
Constantine wets herself
Slowly the women begin realizing what's happening
The two women closest to Constantine gasp and quickly move away from her
Another woman rises from the table covering her mouth with a napkin and leaves the room
Just now realizing what has happened, Constantine looks down at her soiled dress
No one says a word
No one comes to Constantine's aid
Constantine looks to Charlotte
() - Constantine hobbles with a cane down a gravel road still wearing her soiled dress
She turns and looks one last time at the Phelan Plantation
told her she couldn't work here anymore and to go on home
-  - Skeeter trembles
Charlotte won't look at her
How could you humiliate her like that
didn't mean to
Why didn't you help her
was upset
didn't know what else to do
So you just threw her away
That woman did you the biggest favor of your life
She taught me kindness and self respect and you just threw her away like a broken appliance
Charlotte starts to cry
Skeeter isn't affected
114
didn't throw her away, Skeeter
Your daddy went to her house the very next day to give her her job back
But she had already moved to Chicago
Left everything behind
`Cause she didn't have anything anymore
You broke her heart
Please don't do this to me, Skeeter
feel terrible
And you have to remember, they're not like us
They are different
Charlotte gets defensive
(') And you idolized her too much
You always have
needed somebody to look up to
Skeeter turns to leave
(') have to go find her
She needs me
We finally found the address of her daughter in Chicago
so we sent Carlton up there to go get Constantine
Skeeter turns back to her mother
And
When he got there
she was dead, Eugenia
'm so sorry, Honey
Charlotte tries to comfort her
Skeeter rejects her mother's hand
Why didn't y'all tell me all this
knew you'd blame me
when it wasn't my fault
It just happened, and it was so unfortunate
'm sorry, Eugenia
When did she die
How long had she been in Chicago
115
Charlotte pulls the white basin closer, hugs it to her side
Two weeks
Skeeter stands, never turning as she exits
-  - Skeeter stands on the back patio crying
She slowly walks off into the yard
(
) Constantine's story finally made it in our book
But the reason she got fired did not
Miss Skeeter just couldn't put that kind a shame on her own mother
-   - The front window of a bookstore displays many of the nation's top selling books
clerk sets a tiny stack of books in the far corner
(
) They printed a few thousand copies with the worst advance Miss Stein had ever seen
The stack is "The Help," in hardcover
It's wrapped in pale blue
white peace dove spreads its wing under the title
'  -   - Minny stands over the stove frying chicken as Sugar enters with the day's mail
Minny snatches the mail from her and sees an envelope from Harper and Row
Minny tears it open
Her eyes go wide
(
) We got four hundred dollars
Got another four hundred when it got printed
Divided thirteen ways that came to sixty-one fifty-three a person
Minny hugs Sugar and runs out the screen door with her check as the chicken sizzles
'  -  - Aibileen and Minny hug each other as the jump up and down with checks in hand
116
(
) Minny got so excited she burnt up a skillet of chicken
-   - Minny knocks on the door holding bags of groceries
Come on, Miss Celia
Get out a that bed and let me in
It's twelve noon
did all the shopping just like you asked
The door slowly opens
Celia steps out onto the porch, looking beautiful, still dressed tacky
(') Well, look at you, Miss Celia
-   - Celia leads Minny into the dining room
The table, set beautifully in silver and crystal, is covered with delicious looking casseroles and fried chicken
What's all this
cooked it all by myself
wanted to do something special
wanted to say "thank you
" -   - Celia and Minny dine, and Minny's enjoying it
Greens got just the right amount a hock taste to `em
That's a good pot liquor, Miss Celia
Who taught you to cook like this
Minny winks as she dunks a piece of corn bread in the greens
(') Corn bread's happy now
Celia lays down her fork
Are you happy, Minny
Why you ask such a funny question
117
Are you
course 's happy
You happy too
Big house, big yard, good husband
You know, if  were you, 'd give it right back to him
'd hit him over the head with a skillet and tell him to go straight to hell
Minny starts to protest but is tired of excuses
Maybe  will
Celia jumps up
almost forgot the dessert
Minny smiles softly as Celia disappears into the kitchen
-   - Aibileen irons as Elizabeth enters with shopping bags
She races to the television and turns it on
As the tube warms up, we hear the conclusion of a Tide commercial
's lunchtime show, "People Will Talk," continues
,  , ' , '
- Jolene French sits on the set of Jackson's morning show watches as the show runner counts down
Five, four, three, two, one
Welcome back to "People Will Talk
" And do we have something to talk about
Jolene has quite a book to review
Jolene shakes her head, visibly upset
'  -   - Hilly watches Jolene on television as her new maid, , pours a cup of coffee with her right hand
118
Ernestine's left arm is missing
The maid pickings for Hilly have gotten slim
Why are you frowning, Jolene
Hilly leans over and taps her television
(') You don't look cute that way
It's called "The Help
"  new book by an anonymous author
Aibileen jerks her head toward the television
(') Touching and enlightening, it's filled with testimonials from Mississippi's own housekeepers
-   - Minny watches transfixed as she and Celia eat dessert in front of the television
Look how cute that dress is
Takes place in the fictional town of "Niceville
" The book is dedicated to  and
If you're out there  and , we'd love to have you on the show because Niceville sounds like Jackson, if you ask me
The host starts laughing
Jolene snaps
It's not Jackson
It's a disgrace to the South
disgrace to good Southern women who've spent their lives taking care of their help
Smoke rises from the shirt Aibileen is ironing
She snaps to attention, pulls the iron off the burned shirt
But did you read that ending
know  personally treat my help like family, and every one of my friends does the same
119
( ) Bertha, if you're listening,  have a new found respect for what you do
And, believe me, 'll be passin' on dessert at your table
Minny walks like a zombie over to Celia and gathers her dirty plate, never taking her eyes off the television
Do not buy this book
Ladies of Jackson, do not support slander with your husband's hard earned- Poof
Jolene disappears by way of a Seal-Lily ice cream commercial
' Don't cut her off like that
What's that book called, Aibileen
wasn't paying attention
- Stacks of "The Help" rest on tables in the store
Elizabeth enters, pick up two copies and pulls them close to her body
She races to the register like a teen buying a Playboy
Back at the table of books, we see in rapid succession the books quickly disappearing by the hands of Jacksonians
- '  -  - Aibileen, Skeeter and Minny sit at the table
Aibileen's phone rings off the wall, but she won't answer
knew nothing about it
Miss Stein's
Department called the station directly
120
Ever maid callin' to say they white lady's gone and bought the book
They so scared
`One-arm-Earnestine' said Miss Leefolt brought a copy over to Miss Hilly in less than a hour
She better read it quick and start the "this ain't Jackson crusade
" Don't count on it
In her one year at Ole Miss she never cracked a book
Oh, she gone read it
Especially after that man made such a stink on the tee-vee
She gone read it
/  () - Elizabeth and Hilly read the book aloud over the phone with each other
They stop and nod with speculation
- bus is filled with domestics en route to work
Everyone is either reading the book or having it read to them
- Missus Walters reads to a group of women in the home
- Charlotte lies in bed reading the book next to Robert, who is asleep
As she turns a page, her face reveals a dawning realization
Troubled, she starts to wake Robert but doesn't
Charlotte trembles as she brings the book in close to her chest
She slides down to her pillow and stares at the ceiling
-  - Skeeter sits on the swing with Stuart who's just arrived from the rig, still wearing his dingy work clothes
121
That month felt like a year missed you so much
Me, too
Skeeter,  told Daddy 'm not going back on the rig
Stuart nonchalantly pulls out a ring from his front pocket and places it in Skeeter's lap
huge diamond is surrounded by twelve small sapphires
Skeeter's smile quickly fades as she raises the ring
Stuart
have to tell you something
How about "yes
"  had this with me down in New Orleans, you know
Skeeter touches Stuart's face
'm serious
and
you have to promise not to tell anyone
Hang on
Did you say `yes'
Yes
Stuart hugs Skeeter
She pulls back
(') But listen
Can  have your word
Skeeter has again ruined Stuart's big moment
Sure
You have my word
-  - Stuart storms off the porch, dumbfounded
Finally
This is what you've been writing for the last twelve months
What happened to the cleaning column
did both
122
Skeeter approaches Stuart
So, the talk in town
said they were dead wrong
Told them you were too smart to get mixed up in anything like that
Skeeter reaches to calm him
He pulls away
(') That joke you played on Hilly with the toilets
Hell, that's funny
But this
don't understand why you did this
why you even care
What
Things are fine around here
Why stir up trouble
'm not stirring up trouble, Stuart
Trouble's already here
guess it is
Skeeter grabs his arm
had to tell you
You needed to know
Stuart shakes his head and pulls away
guess  don't really know you, Skeeter
And  can't marry somebody don't know
Stuart looks down at the ring
(') That was my grandmother's
Skeeter hands the ring back
Stuart shoves it in his pocket
(') Don't worry
won't tell anyone
Just leave
-  - Charlotte sits in bed next to Robert who is fast asleep
She hears a door closing outside
123
Skeeter
Come in here, please
After a few moments, Skeeter enters
You okay
Can  get you anything
Come here, Eugenia
want to tell you something
Me, too
You go first
Stuart proposed
Finally
You knew
Of course
He had to ask Daddy for your hand
She lifts Skeeter's ring hand
Seeing her bare finger, Charlotte's smile fades
Skeeter prepares for the worst
Just say it
What did you do
Nothing
Skeeter stands to walk away
Young lady, 'm talking to you
Skeeter sits back down
(') Stuart'll come around
It's a funny dance
(points to Robert ) Took this one a year
Anyway, my news
After a long talk with your daddy, 've made a decision
My health's been on the uptick these past few weeks
And  know the doctor says it's some kind of last - 124
Charlotte starts coughing
Skeeter hands her a tissue
(') But, as  said,  made a decision
have decided not to die
Oh, Momma
Charlotte slaps her palms as if throwing the cancer away
Too late
tried calling Fanny Mae's so  could make your hair appointments for the next twenty years, but they wouldn't allow it
Charlotte raises Skeeter's ring finger
(') certainly can't leave you now
Skeeter laughs and hugs her mother
Robert never stirs
-   - Hilly drives in front of Jitney Jingle grocery store
She wears a scarf on her head and big sunglasses
One-armed Ernestine rides in the passenger seat
Hilly slows in front of the store's big glass entrance
She hurriedly waves Ernestine out of the car
(
) The voters of Hinds County had spoke
Mister Holbrook wasn't gone have no political career
One-Arm Ernestine races to the storefront and removes William's campaign poster taped to the window
-  - Hilly reads the book in bed
William is fast asleep
Suddenly, her eyes widen, her breath becomes heavy
She slowly turns a page and freezes
Her face turns white
Hilly balls both fists, looks to the ceiling and screams louder than humanly possible
: '  - Skeeter lies in bed sleeping
Her eyes pop open
125
'  - Aibileen lies in bed sleeping
Her eyes pop open
'  - Minny lies in bed sleeping
Her eyes pop open
But, this time, Hilly's scream fades as knocks at the door grow louder
Knocking that has actually stirred Minny awake
Sugar and Kindra enter, jumping in bed with Minny
Momma, there's a white man at our door
(
) Minny Jackson
Are you in there
Minny covers the girls with a blanket
She puts on a robe and grabs a bat from behind the door
(
) (') can hear you
Open the door
'  -   - Minny approaches the door
Who there
Johnny Foote
Minny Jackson, want to talk to you
Open up
Minny slowly opens the door
Johnny is all smiles
Finally,  meet Minny Jackson
As Johnny enters, Minny raises the bat and swings
Johnny turns and stops the bat with his hand
(') What the hell are you doin'
Minny lets go of the bat and cowers on the floor, raises her hands in front of her
Please don't hurt me
My babies are in the house
Johnny drops the bat and pulls Minny up from the floor
Calm down, girl
'm not here to get you
126
He suddenly throws his arms around her and squeezes hard
'  - Johnny and Minny sit at her kitchen table
When  finally confronted Celia about you, she told me about the baby
All of them
You saved her life
don't know about that
Well,  know the day you came to our house, she started getting better
And 'm not just talking about the cookin' either
You knew  was there
Fried chicken and okra on the first night
'all should have at least put corn pone on the table
couldn't make you eat anymore corn pone, Mister Johnny
Next morning,  snuck back up to the house, peeked in the window, and there you were
Given ol' Oscar a wipe down
Minny smiles for the first time
So  ain't losing my job
You have a job with us for the rest of your life, if you want it
-   - Bridge is underway at the Leefolt house with the usual suspects, except Skeeter
has taken her place
Aibileen nervously pours coffee
heard that Betty character might be Charlene
127
It's not Jackson, and that book is garbage
bet the whole thing's made up by some nigra
Aibileen begins pouring coffee into Hilly's cup
And, Jolene, didn't your momma leave Cora to you in her will
Well, yes
But that's not odd is it
Happens all the time, right
sudden realization washes over Jolene
Did anybody ever figured out who and  are
The book is
Aibileen spills a few drops of coffee on Hilly's plate
Hilly looks up to Aibileen slow and deliberate
(') You spilled some, Aibileen
Aibileen takes the cloth from the coffee pitcher handle and dabs the spilled coffee
Aibileen glances at Hilly
secret burns between them
(') Get me a new plate
One you haven't soiled with a dirty cloth
- Aibileen and Minny walk into the church parking lot wearing their Sunday best
Minny takes note of all the cars
We late
Looks like Bible study done already started
No
We ain't late
- As Minny and Aibileen enter the church
Four-hundred members stand at once
The congregation begins to clap
128
Minny and Aibileen look around trying to figure out the source of adulation
They both start clapping too
Aibileen steps up to a woman in the last pew
Who we clappin' for
The woman laughs
Honey, we clappin' for you
The woman raises a copy of "The Help
" Aibileen notices a copy of the book in each member's hand
Aibileen looks to Minny, realizing she's in on it
approaches, hands Aibileen a copy of the book
Aibileen, this is an important time for you and our church
We know you couldn't put your name in here, so we all signed our own
The Reverend then hands her a box wrapped in white paper, tied with a blue ribbon
(') This is for the white lady
Tell her we love her like family
'  - Skeeter sits between Aibileen and Minny on the sofa thumbing through her signed book
Hundreds of signatures cover the pages
Churches over two counties signed our books
All for you and me
Aibileen points to the inside back cover
(') Doctor King signed it, too
He readin' our book
Aibileen glances proudly at the framed portrait of Dr
King
We did something
We did something good
It's beautiful
Skeeter closes the book and sets it down regretfully
129
What's wrong
Skeeter pulls a letter out of her purse
got a job offer from Harper and Row
in New York
Congratulations
That real good, Miss Skeeter
not taking it
just wanted to share it with you both
There's no one else  can tell
What you mean you not takin' it
This is what you been dreaming of
can't leave you two right when things are getting bad from a mess created
set out to write a book to make white people thankful
But in the end, what we should say is "sorry
" If bad things happen, they ain't nothing you can do about it
And if they happen, at least now theys a reason behind it
reason we can wrap our heads around and be proud of
Skeeter nods with little relief
(') Now,  don't mean to rub salt in your wound, but
you ain't got a good life here in Jackson
Plus, your momma's getting better- Minny aggressively chimes in
You ain't got nothing left here but enemies in the Junior League
You done burned ever bridge there is
And you ain't never gone get another man in this town, and ever body know it
So don't walk your white butt to New York,
Minny leans over, placing her hand on Skeeter's for the first time since knowing each other
130
(') And you listen to me
'm on take care a Aibileen, and she gone take care a me
Skeeter nods
Go find your life, Miss Skeeter
- Skeeter stands next to the barn smoking a cigarette reading the Harper and Row offer for the hundredth time
Tires crunch gravel down the drive
Skeeter sees a car moving toward her with the headlights off
Worried, Skeeter looks toward her home
Charlotte can be seen in an upstairs window
Skeeter soon recognizes the car as Hilly's
Hilly parks, lights a cigarette and gets out of her car
Skeeter charges toward her
What are you doing here
Hilly screams and throws her lit cigarette at Skeeter
Don't you get an inch closer
Hilly's a mess
Her shirt is half tucked
Her shorts strain to contain a newly developed layer of fat
horrible fever blister burns hot on Hilly's upper lip
(') 've contacted my lawyer, Hibbie Goodman
He's the best libel attorney in Mississippi
You're in big trouble, Missy
And you're going to jail
You can't prove anything, Hilly
one-hundred-percent know you wrote it `cause nobody else in town is as tacky as you
Those nigras of yours are in a lifetime of trouble
Exactly who are you talking about
You don't know anything
131
don't, do
You tell Aibileen, the next time she wants to write about my dear friend Elizabeth
uh- huh
Remember her
Had you in her wedding
Let's just say, Aibileen ought to've been a little bit smarter before putting in the - shaped crack in poor Elizabeth's dining table
And that nigra, Minny
Do  have plans for her
Careful, Hilly
Don't give yourself away now
That was not me
Hilly storms up the porch steps
Skeeter follows
did not invite you here
Skeeter yanks Hilly's arm hard
've come to tell your mother what a hippie you've become
She's gonna be disgusted by you
Skeeter can't help but laugh
You're telling my mother on me
Hilly opens the door
Skeeter grabs her
They struggle
(') You get out of here
Charlotte suddenly appears
Skeeter lets go of Hilly
Why, Hilly
It's been such a long time, Dear
Everything okay, you two
Hilly is shocked by Charlotte's frail appearance
Missus Phelan, 'm
'm here to- Hilly, you're a mess
Are you ill
Hilly self-consciously licks her fever blister
Well,
didn't have time to get fixed up before- 132
Darling, no husband wants to come home and see this
Charlotte peers closely at Hilly's cold sore
(') And that
that is horrendous
Missus Phelan, 'm here- You know, Hilly
If  didn't know any better, 'd say you've been eating too many
Hilly's face turns purple with embarrassment
Charlotte moves in for the kill
(') In fact
'm sure of it
Now before we all get one of those on our lip
Hilly looks back and forth between Skeeter and her mother, not knowing what to say
Hilly runs out of the house as Charlotte sashays quietly into the living room
Shocked, Skeeter stands alone in the foyer
Hilly sprays gravel across the Phelan yard as she speeds away
(
) (') Eugenia
Yes, Ma'am
(
) Come in here, please
Skeeter gulps as she heads toward the living room
-   - Charlotte pats the sofa as Skeeter enters and sits
Ma'am
Do you have plans tomorrow
Bible study
Anything like that
No, Ma'am
133
Good
We're going shopping
Skeeter lets out a big sigh of relief
(') `Cause no single daughter of mine is going to New York, representing the great state of Mississippi, without a proper cosmopolitan wardrobe
What
'm very proud of you, Eugenia
How do you know about New York
friend of Constantine's told me
Charlotte reaches down and pulls up her copy of "The Help"
(') Would you do me the honor of signing my copy
Skeeter nods
Charlotte hands Skeeter a pen
Her hand trembles as she signs the book, never having guessed how good it would feel
-  - Aibileen washes dishes as the phone begins to ring
She answers
Minny screams on the other end of the line
() - Minny stands barefoot inside a phone booth, her lip swollen, face bleeding
Her kids stand outside, crying
They fired Leroy last night
And when Leroy ask why, his boss say Mister Holbrook told him to do it
Said his nigger wife the reason
Oh, Law
He try to kill me with he bare hands
He threw the kids in the yard, lock me in the bathroom, and say he gone set the house on fire
134
Where are you now
The gas station
climbed out the window, and we all ran here
'm on come there now
Wait, Aibileen
'm pregnant
Minny, now, you listen to me
That baby gone be fine, and you ain't never gone lose your job
Mister Johnny told you that hisself
They's more book money coming
Your baby ain't gone know about gettin' beat
You hear me
You free, Minny
You are free
Minny lets out a chuckle of relief and wipes her eyes
(') You hear me
hear you
The Leefolt front door opens
Elizabeth calls out
(
) Aibileen
-   - Aibileen enters to find Elizabeth and Hilly staring at her
Elizabeth is two weeks
Good morning
Hilly licks her cold sore as she steps forward
She glides her hand across the -shaped crack in the Elizabeth's table, drawing Aibileen's attention to it
Aibileen, the silver  lent Elizabeth last week
It not polished good
Humidity been fighting me on polishing day
When you returned it, three pieces were missing out of the felt wrapper
fork and two spoons
135
Lemme
lemme go look in the kitchen, maybe  left some behind
You know as well as  do that silver's not in the kitchen
Aibileen turns to Elizabeth
You check in Mae Mobley's bed
She been putting things- Do you hear her, Elizabeth
She's trying to blame it on a toddler
Elizabeth won't look at Aibileen
ain't stole no silver
Elizabeth whispers to Hilly
She says she doesn't have them
Then it behooves me to inform you that you are fired, Aibileen
And 'll be calling the police
They know me
Mae Mobley enters the room
Aibee, my froat hurts
Mae Mobley coughs
go get her some syrup, Miss Leefolt
Elizabeth can take care of her child
Elizabeth looks to Hilly, appearing somewhat upset with this suggestion
'll go get the couch syrup
Hilly glares at Aibileen as Elizabeth runs down the hall
won't tolerate liars
Mae Mobley becomes scared and hides behind Aibileen's leg
136
didn't steal no silver
'm not talking about silver
'm talking about those things you wrote about Elizabeth
Maybe can't send you to jail for what you wrote, but  can send you to jail for being a thief
And your friend, Minny
That nigra's got a nice surprise coming to her
Johnny Foote listens to what  say
She's as good as- Aibileen shouts, interrupting Hilly
Woman
know something about you
Don't you forget that
Hilly narrows her eyes
(') From what Yule May says, they's a lot a time to write letters from jail
Plenty a time to write ever person in Jackson the truth about you, and the paper is free
Nobody would believe something you wrote
don't know
Already sold a lot a books
Fear floods into Hilly's eyes
Get out of here
Don't go, Aibiee
Aibileen kneels down as Elizabeth returns with the syrup
Baby, you need to get back to bed
You got a fever
Noooo
Don't go, Aibee
Please don't leave
gots to, Baby
am so sorry
Why
Are you going to take care of another little girl
137
No, Baby, that's not the reason don't want to leave you, but
It's time for me to retire
You my last little girl
Noooo
Baby Girl,  need you to remember ever thing  told you
Okay
Do you remember what  told you
To wipe my bottom good
No, Baby
The other
What you are
You is kind
You is smart
You is important
That's right, Baby Girl
Aibileen squeezes Mae Mobley for the last time
They both cry together
Hilly speaks up
You need to go now, Aibileen
Aibileen rises up from Mae Mobley and turns to Elizabeth
Give my sweet girl a chance
Elizabeth avoids eye contact
Aibileen turns and walks away
As Elizabeth leans down to pick up Mae Mobley She glares at Hilly with shock and regret
- Aibileen steps out of the house with her purse
She walks stoically down the driveway
Tears stream down her face
Mae Mobley runs to the living room window crying
She beats on the glass from inside
Aibeeeee
Don't go
Aibileen never turns
138
(
) Mae Mobley was my last baby
In just thirty minutes,  felt like my whole life was done
Of the thirteen maids, seven of us got fired
Several other maids got fired who had nothin' to do with our book
Guess our stories weren't so unique after all
But, like Minny, we was all free
-  - Hilly, even fatter now, sifts through the day's mail
(
) And we's was a lot freer than Hilly Holbrook
She comes across a piece from Celia Foote addressed to The Starving Children of Africa Fund
smug smile forms
She opens the envelope to find a check for $200
00 made out to: -
Hilly screams as she rips the check into pieces
-  - Minny folds laundry on a picnic table
(
) Ever so often, we all get a nice piece of book money in the mail
`Manna from heaven' we like to call it
Minny looks across the table and smiles at Celia who is holding and playing with Minny's newborn child
-  - Close on tombstone: Born December 24th 1883 Died March 15th, 1963 bouquet of flowers lay at the foot of the tombstone copy of "The Help" leans against it
In the distance, a cab slowly pulls away with Skeeter inside
139
'  -  - Aibileen sits at her kitchen table, typing on Skeeter's old typewriter
We watch as keys write out the rest of Aibileen's voice over
(
) Thousands of our books went out all over the world
We had got paid to tell the truth and we just couldn't believe it
Aibileen takes this last page out of the typewriter and places it behind two hundred other typed out pages
She looks up to the framed picture of Treelore and rises from the table with pride
- '  -   - Skeeter smiles as she reads from a book in her corner office
The Manhattan skyline rises behind her
She wears Pucci
Her hair is perfectly styled
She looks gorgeous
She sets the book down on her desk and picks up the phone
The book's cover reads: "All My Babies" By Aibileen Clark Next to the book is a glass box
Constantine's corn pipe rests inside
'   -   - Aibileen, 70, rises from a sofa
Her hair is gray
Reading glasses hang on a chain from around her neck
As she begins a slow walk down the hall, we see the surroundings of her new home for the first time
It's much bigger, well furnished and beautiful
She passes a study lined with shelves of books
copy of "The Help" and "All My Babies" are placed side by side
At the end of the hall, Aibileen approaches the opened door of a brightly lit, sparkling white, bathroom
She enters the bathroom and closes the door
