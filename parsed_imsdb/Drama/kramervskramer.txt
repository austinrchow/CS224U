"
" by Robert Benton : large and very comfortable office over-looking St
Patrick's Cathedral
At the moment the office is filled to bursting with men and women, slumped in chairs, sitting on desks, all of them very tense
Among the crowd of people we note: , a young and very ambitious junior executive and , an attractive woman in her early thirties
She is a lawyer with the agency
At the moment,  , nice-looking without being what you would call a matinee idol, paces back and forth
His tie is loosened, he checks his watch every fifteen seconds
Clearly he is very distraught
(predicting the worst) They're not gonna call
tell you they're not gonna call
blew it don't know what  did wrong, but ' Ted's boss and good friend
He is in his middle fifties, nattily dressed with the slightly bleary look of a heavy drinker
He sits back in his chair with his feet propped on the desk and a drink in one hand
' (not unfriendly) Ted, will you take it easy
Revlon's not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this, without making us sweat
Now just relax, okay
Everything's gonna be fine
(at this stage, nothing will help) don't think so, Jim
Maybe shouldn't have Sound-effect: The phone rings
Everyone freezes
As 'Connor reaches for the phone, : ' , The room is dark, the only light coming from a small night light
We  a beautiful five year old boy ( )
He lies in bed, half asleep
as a beautiful woman ( ) leans over, kisses the child and hugs him tightly to her
(intense) love you, Billy
(drowsy) love you too, mommy
Good-night
She gets up from the bed and starts toward the door of the child's room
Sleep tight
Don't let the bedbugs bite
Joanna stops in the doorway, silhouetted against the light
She turns, takes a last look at her son, then steps outside
: Now that the light is brighter, we can  her more clearly
In her mid-thirties, she is beautiful, dressed in a style that can best be described as Bloomingdale's as she leans against the door
It is clear from her expression that she is terribly upset
Then, making up her mind, she crosses to a closet and takes out a suitcase
as she carries it into the bedroom, lays it out on the bed and opens it
as she crosses to a closet, grabs an armload of clothes and dumps them helter-skelter into the suitcase
: '' It is a few minutes later, the news has obviously been good because there is a general celebration in progress
Jim 'Connor, now standing, raises one hand for silence, then making a toast
' Here's to Ted Kramer
Cheers and good-natured jokes
' (putting an arm around Ted squeezing him tight) wanna tell you something about this little runt
He went out there and sold the shit out of Revlon and that's why we got the account
It was his idea, it was his concept, right down the line
More hoots and cheers
People start to yell "Speech
" (embarrassed, but cannot stop grinning) All  can say
All  can say is this is maybe one of the five best days of my whole life
: Joanna stands at the medicine cabinet, going through it, packing things in a travel kit: rollers, deodorant, makeup, birth control pills
She starts to take a small bottle of perfume that has only an eighth of an inch of fluid left inside, hesitates, then puts it back
: '' Now some time has passed, most of the crowd has gone and only the regulars are left
(in the middle of a story) So anyway Jim and  are making the pitch, right
And all of a sudden this old guy starts to cough and keep on going and he keeps on coughing and  keep on going and he keeps on coughing and Murray Fisher leans over, shakes Ted's hand
(interrupting) Congratulations, Ted
That was a hell of a job
(surprised) Where you goin' Murray, it's early
Got to get home
(glancing at his watch) Oh, Christ, 'm late
gotta get out of here
(however, instead of going, he settles back and resumes his story) So anyway,  look over and this old geezer is starting to turn blue and swear to God the only thing  can think about is that this poor sonofabitch is gonna die on me and screw up the pitch
: :  long and meticulous list that Joanna is making out of the phone numbers and addresses of doctors and hospitals, of what the various medicines are for, and of the foods that Billy is and isn't permitted to eat
As Joanna puts the finishing touches on the list and carefully arranges it on top of the kitchen counter next to a box of unsweetened, whole grain cereal and a jar of honey
Note: It is this same set of notes that Ted will later unthinkingly throw away
: As the doors to the outer lobby open and Ted and 'Connor appear
Ted starts to hail a cab, 'Connor stops him
' Hey, what's the rush
'mon, walk me a couple of blocks
Jim, 've got to go
'm already late ' Listen, Ted
just want to tell you, when old man Schmidt retires next year, 've got a pretty good feeling they'll kick me upstairs
He turns and starts to walk off down the street, Ted, of course, follows
' and when they do,  just want you to know 'm takin' you along with me
: As she goes through her jewelry case, taking some things, leaving others
In the
we  a framed photograph of Billy, smiling, looking into the camera
: ' Tracking with them as they walk
' (feeling no pain) 'know, Ted,  mean what  said back there
You did a hell of a job on this and  want you to know 'm turning the whole show over to you
(thrilled) Wow
' mean it Ted, you're running this one
: The suitcase is now full
Joanna zips it shut and looks around to make sure that she hasn't forgotten anything
Then, she hefts her suitcase and starts out of the room
: Joanna carries in the suitcase, sets it by the front door, then she crosses to the living room and sits down at the dining table
She takes out a list made on the back of an old envelope
As she begins to review it, checking off some items: Sound:  key turning in the lock
As Joanna looks up
: As the door swings open to reveal Ted Kramer, an enormous grin on his face, a bottle of champagne in his hand
He is so full of himself that he doesn't notice there is anything wrong
Note: Throughout the entire scene he carries the bottle of champagne, never putting it down
thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon
-  : (she takes a deep breath, then:) Ted, 'm leaving you
That represents a gross billing in excess of two million (hearing her) What
Joanna opens her purse, takes out her keys and wallet
Here are my keys
won't be needing them any more
Note: Ted does not for a moment believe that his wife will really leave him
All he can think of right now is that he will have to spend the rest of the evening coping with one of her moods
(sardonic) 'm sorry 'm late, all right
'm sorry  didn't call   was busy making a living
-  : Joanna doesn't even bother to look up at him
She opens her purse, takes out her wallet and begins removing credit cards
My American Express
My Bloomingdale's Credit Card
My check book (the martyr) Okay, okay
What is it this time
What did  do now
(ignoring this) took two thousand out of the savings account
That was what  had in the bank when we got married
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, 'm sorry
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning
They'll be ready on Saturday
(hard lining it) Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think - (not bothering to look up) 've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them
She checks off the last item on her list as her husband watches, dumbfounded
There, that's everything
Joanna gets to her feet and starts toward the front door
In an instant Ted is after her
(panic starting) For God's sake, Joanna, would you at least tell me what  did that's so terrible
Would you do me that little favor
At the door
Look, it's not your fault, okay
It's me
It's my fault  you just married the wrong person
(placating her) So we've got problems
Everybody's got problems  that's normal Joanna opens the door and they step out into the hallway
Ted, you're not listening to me
It's over, finished
'm listening, Joanna  believe me, 'm listening
My wife is walking out on me after eight years of (bitter) You just don't get it, do you
(as though to a child) am  really  and  truly leaving  you
heard you, Joanna
promise heard you
No you didn't
(quietly) You didn't even ask about Billy
(stiffening) What about Billy
'm not taking him with me
What
(tears start) Ted,  can't
tried
really tried but
just can't hack it anymore
'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that
You're a terrific mother (from her gut) am not
'm a terrible mother
'm an awful mother
yell at him all the time
have no patience
No
No
He's better off without me
(unable to look at Ted) Ted, 've got to go
've got to go
(desperate) Okay,  understand and  promise won't try and stop you, but you can't just go
Look, come inside and talk
Just for a few minutes
(pleading) Please
Please don't make me stay
swear
If you do, sooner or later
maybe tomorrow, maybe next week
maybe a year from now
(looking directly at him) 'll go right out the window
Sound-effect: The elevator approaching
-  : There is nothing more that can be done, this is the last moment of intimacy
(quiet) Where are you going
don't know
The elevator door opens, Joanna steps inside
Do you want me to help you get a cab
Joanna shakes her head
The elevator door closes behind her and it starts to descend
He stands for a moment, stunned, unable to move
Then he turns and races back into the apartment
as he rushes across to one of the living room windows, throws it open and leans out
Looking down to the street from the eighth floor
We Joanna step off the curb and hail a passing taxi
(calling out) Joanna
Joanna
Either she doesn't hear him or else she pays no attention
She gets into the cab, closes the door behind her and it drives away
: As he stands for a moment watching the taxi as it disappears
Then, slowly, he closes the window, turns, and , walks into the bedroom
The bedroom is a mess: the closet door stands open, inside Joanna's section is empty except for some shoe-boxes and a few dresses that are scattered across the floor
Several dresser drawers have been pulled out and their contents emptied
as Ted wearily picks up one of the dresses and hangs it back on its hanger in its proper place, ready for Joanna's return
As he continues straightening up the room, : Ted Kramer paces back and forth, eyeing the phone
Then, coming to a decision, he crosses to it, picks up the receiver and starts to dial
: The building is dark except for the Kramer apartment which is ablaze with lights
as we : Sound: The phone ringing
Then: ' (obviously asleep) Huh
Hello
(righteous) All right, Thelma
That's it
've had it
You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay
mean,  don't know what  did, but you can tell her she's made her point
' Ted, what are you talking about
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma
You know perfectly well what's going on
' (exasperated) Ted,  don't understand a word you're saying
Where's Joanna
Ha
You tell me
Sound-effect, as Ted slams down the receiver
Instantly a light is turned on two floors below
: As we : Sound-effect: the doorbell rings
moment later Ted opens the door and   enters
She is a neighbor (Apt
6-) and Joanna Kramer's best friend
About four months ago Thelma and her husband Charley were divorced
Until then the two families had been very close, the Kramer's son (Billy) being about the same age as the Phillips' daughter (Kim)
With the divorce, however, the Kramers tried to remain friends with both Thelma and Charley and that has caused a certain amount of friction
Thelma is an attractive woman in her mid-thirties
She dresses well, works out religiously at Jack LaLanne's and goes to a therapist twice a week
She is also given to acting the lay analyst with her friends
Thelma is generous with her advice, sharing the wealth so to speak
With all of this she is kind, loyal and a loving friend
At the moment, however, she is all business
(looking around, suspiciously) All right
What's going on
From his attitude it is clear that there is no love lost between them
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on
'll tell you what's going on
'll tell you exactly what's going on
Look, Ted, all (starting to really roll) came home tonight
We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency
Do you know what that means
Do you understand what that means
It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life
Ted, all  wanted to know was where (not letting her get a word in edgewise) walk in the house and before  can say "How are you
", "Did you have a nice day
" before  can say anything
Pow she's out the door
OhmyGod
Didn't she say anything
She must've said something
(sarcastic) Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore
Ted, don't be so hostile
Ted draws himself upright with the dignity of the Ambassador to the Court of St
James
However, during the following, he begins pounding the pillows on the couch into shape with real vehemence
Hostile
(pow) Me
(whack) Thelma, 'm not hostile
(thud) am anything but hostile
(sock) But if you want to know what  am
'll tell you what  am
What  am is,  am hurt
am very hurt
And just want to know one thing, okay
Just one thing
Why
That's all want to know
Why
(how to say this) Ted, Joanna and  used to talk a lot and
well, she told me a lot of
ah, things about the two of you
(instantly nervous) Things
What kind of things
(clearly she knows more than she's willing to say) mean
things
Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and (flash of anger) Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life
She's got a husband that loves her
She's got a terrific kid
She's got a wonderful home (getting mad herself) What d'you know about how Joanna felt
You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell
Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with
Did it
For one thing she's always thirty minutes late
You can set your watch by it (exasperated) So she's late
What's the big deal
That's just a way of saying, "Pay attention to me
" (not listening) Two
She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it
Thelma, do you know where  could be in this business if had a wife that entertained or went out socially Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being  have ever met
No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps
Joanna said that
Thelma nods
Then how come she never said anything like that to me
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to
Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed
(stung) Boy, you guys are really something, y'know
'd like to know one thing, okay  just one little thing
Did you tell Joanna she should leave me
(stiffly) No
She turns and starts toward the front door, Ted at her heel
'know something Thelma  you are the typhoid Mary of divorce
mean it
Joanna and  never had any trouble until you and Charley split up
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing know,  went through it
You've got to believe  did everything  could to get Joanna to stay
(pause) But 'll tell you something
You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did
'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child
That stops her dead in her tracks
She had always assumed that Joanna took Billy with her when she left
Joanna left Billy
She didn't take him with her
Ted shakes his head
There is a long beat of silence
(stunned, quiet) Oh Shit
: : It is a beautiful sunny morning and the super stands in front of the building hosing down the sidewalk
as a garbage truck enters  and the garbage men begin loading sacks of trash into the back of the truck
As it begins to grind up the garbage with an ungodly sound, : ' Billy Kramer lies in his bed, fast asleep
as we : Sound: From the street below, the garbage truck grinding up garbage
moment later, Billy opens his eyes, struggles to his feet and, , trudges sleepily out of his room, across the hall and into the bathroom
As the child stands in front of the toilet, eyes closed, we : Sound-effect: as the child pees noisily
Then, when he is finished, he turns and, without bothering to flush the toilet, shuffles down the hall and into his parents' bedroom
The bed is empty, there is no sign that anyone has slept in it
look of suspicion on his face, he turns and starts back down the hall toward the living room
As Billy enters, looks around
Ted Kramer, still fully dressed, looking like the wrath of God is asleep in the chair
As he marches across to his father
Where's mommy
His eyes open, he looks around startled
Huh
Oh God
What time is it
-  : (suspicious) The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine
Where is mommy
(trying to pull himself together) Oh, Christ
Ah, yeah
you want to know why mom's not here, right
Billy nods
(bullshit) Okay, 'm going to tell you
It's like this
Mommy and daddy had a little argument and mommy decided she wanted to go off by herself for a little while
You know how sometimes you get mad and want to go off and be by yourself
Well, it's like that, okay
Okay
(subject closed) Now how about some breakfast
Ted struggles to his feet and      as they start toward the kitchen
When is mommy coming back
(lying) Soon
Very soon
By now they are inside the kitchen, Ted looks around
There, on the kitchen cabinet is a box of "natural grain" cereal, a jar of honey, some wheat germ, and a banana, with carefully written instructions from Joanna underneath
He takes one look at the note, crumples it up and tosses it in the wastebasket
(the camp counselor) 'll tell you what, kiddo  why don't fix us some French toast
(impressed) Wow
French toast, really
(the camp counselor) Sure
Didn't  ever tell you French toast was my specialty
'll bet never told you that
Now then, the first thing we need is
(trying desperately to remember) eggs
Right
Billy nods
Ted opens the refrigerator and takes some eggs
This is terrific
isn't this terrific
As Ted begins the process of making French toast, it soon becomes obvious that he has no idea of what he is doing
What follows is a symphony in incompetence on Ted's part
He breaks the eggs into a bowl and ends up with most of the shell mixed up with the egg
Then he takes a piece of bread and drops it into bowl
(saying it will make it so) 'm having a good time
Are you having a good time
Watching all of this with increasing apprehension
You forgot the milk
(still the camp counselor) That's right
You're absolutely right
It's been a long time since made French toast
Ted takes a container of milk, pours it into the bowl so that it is filled to the brim
Then he sloshes the bread around until it is half-dissolved
Look at this, isn't this something
He lops off a huge hunk of butter, drops it into an omelet pan and turns up the flame
Watching
He looks as though he is about to throw up
What about my orange juice
(the counterman) Right
One
coming up
He opens the refrigerator and starts to get the orange juice
As he does, black smoke begins to billow ominously from the frying pan
(scared) Daddy
Ted turns, spots the smoke
Don't worry
Everything's fine
He lunges for the handle of the frying pan, which by now is very hot
He grabs it, lets out a howl of pain and the whole mess, frying pan, butter, bread, goes crashing to the floor
Suddenly all the rage comes pouring out
Goddam
Son of a bitch
Terrified
As Ted kneels down and begins to clean up the mess
(to himself as much as to Billy) It's okay
It's gonna be okay
Everything's going to be all right
: As it pulls to a stop
The doors open and a stream of mothers and children get off
Among them we spot Ted Kramer with Billy
As they start across the street, Ted reaches down and takes hold of Billy's hand
The moment they get to the far side, Billy takes his hand away from Ted's and wipes it on his pants
Clearly Ted's hands are very sweaty
As they start down the block toward Billy's school
When is mommy coming back
Soon
told you before, very soon
(nervous) Will she pick me up after school
No
If 'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim
What if she forgets
(weary) 'll call Thelma and remind her, okay
Don't worry
They walk in silence for a few steps, then: But what happens if she's on her way to school and she gets runned over by a truck and killed
What happens them
Ted looks at Billy in amazement
As the two of them enter the school and disappear from view
: , ' As they open and Ted steps out looking like the wrath of God
as he crosses the waiting room toward the inner offices
Glancing up as he passes
(cheerful) Congratulations, Mr
Kramer
Looking at her like she has lost her mind
Nevertheless he continues on, passing through swinging doors into a long corridor lined with secretaries' desks and offices leading off of it
Suddenly a younger man rushes up, grabs Ted's hand and starts to pump it vigorously
Terrific news, Ted
Another nut
Ted smiles at the man, humoring him and continues toward his office
'Connor appears, throwing his arm around Ted, squeezing him in a bear hug
' Hey
Look who was out celebrating last night
Suddenly Ted realizes that all these people are congratulating him for getting the Fire and Ice account
(trying to appear nonchalant) Uh, Jim
Can  talk to you
: '' Ted and 'Connor sitting across from one another
'Connor has just heard the news
' Jesus Christ
That's a real blockbuster
(shakes his head) always figured you guys had it made
(morose) You want to know the real kicker
The real kicker is, for the first time in my life  the first time feel like a loser
'Connor nods sympathetically
Actually he is praying that Ted won't start to cry
' (stiff upper lip) Listen, don't let it get you down
(doesn't believe it for a second) You're going to be fine
(toujour gai) Me
've never been better
mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine
' Look, Ted, 'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay
Three marriages, two divorces
You're gonna be okay
(wishful thinking) 'm going to be okay
The way  see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time
' (emphatically) She'll be back
Ted nods in agreement
There is a beat of silence as both men consider Joanna's imminent return
Then: ' (trying to be tactful) But
just in case
mean, just on the off chance she doesn't
What are you going to do about the kid
(the wind goes out of him) don't know, Jim
This whole thing has happened so
Pow  like that
' (a friend having to say something very difficult) Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay
But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while
Just until you get yourself straightened out
(doubtfully) don't know, Jim
' (the Dutch uncle) Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right
And now it's up to us  that's you and me  to deliver the goods
Ted, you're my main man, and if can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose Jim,  appreciate what you're saying
mean it, but  really think Joanna's coming back
' Clearly he doesn't believe this
' hope you're right, Ted
really hope you're right
: : It is postmarked Denver, Colorado
The letter is addressed to Billy Kramer and it is from Joanna
As he rips open the letter
Billy
He sits in the living room watching television, a chocolate doughnut in one hand and a remote control device for watching television in the other
Off-screen Sound: a Saturday morning kiddie program from the television set
(focused on
) Uh, huh
You got a letter from mom
Instantly, Billy turns down the volume of the television
(excited) When is she coming home
As he starts to read, slowly, carefully, so that Billy can absorb it
"My dear, sweet Billy: Mommy has gone away
Sometimes in the world daddies go away and mommies bring up their little boys
But sometimes a mommy can go away too, and you have your daddy to bring you up
" As Ted continues to read, Billy starts turning up the sound on the television, using the remote control device
(raising his voice so he can be heard) " have gone away because  must find some interesting things to do for myself in the world
Everybody has to, and so do
Being your mommy was one thing, but there are other things and this is what  have to do
did not get a chance to tell you this, and that is why  am writing you now
" By now the volume from the television is so loud that Ted has to shout to make himself heard over it
" will always be your mommy and will always love you
just won't be your mommy in the house
But will be your mommy of the heart
And " (he looks up, about to tell the child to lower the volume) Billy
Billy sits, watching television with an almost ferocious intensity on his face, doing his best to block out Ted's voice
He watches his son for a second, then carefully refolds the letter, puts it away
(as he reaches across, turns down the sound on the
) It's okay
It's okay
We'll talk about it some other time
: Reading Joanna's letter
Oh, God
OhmyGod
She finishes the letter, looks up at Ted
What are you going to do
don't know, Thel
This whole thing has happened so
Pow, like that
mean, what are you going to do about Billy
(stiff) 'm gonna keep him, why
Look, this is nothing personal, but don't think you can do it
Thelma, 've lost my wife, 'm not losing my child
(backing off) All right
Okay
But let's get something straight, right now mean, 'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand
He nods
-  : 'm not going to have you calling every fifteen minutes just because you can't find a hot water bottle, understand
Ted nods
've got enough trouble raising my own kid
don't need another one
Got it
Got it
You're on your own, understand
understand
You're sure
'm sure
long pause, she looks at him with all the warmth of a top sergeant facing a raw recruit
Then: All right
Who's Billy's pediatrician
He hasn't the foggiest idea
(machine-gun delivery) Ed Davies
230 East 76th Street
472- 8227
Fifty bucks a house call, thirty for an office visit
Write this down: 'm not telling you twice
What's the nearest hospital
As he grabs a piece of paper and starts writing frantically
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
(not waiting) Lenox Hill
77th Street between Park and Lex
The emergency number is 327- 0800
Slow down
Slow down
: ' Ted stands in the middle of the room, sorting out a huge pile of dirty clothes
Thelma sits on the edge of the bed, watching
Colors in one pile, white things in another and shirts in a third
In the  we  the bathroom door as it opens and Billy Kramer steps out, freshly bathed and wearing clean clothes
(without looking around) Brush the teeth
Hang up the towel and flush the toilet
Billy immediately turns on his heels and heads back into the bathroom
: That is inscribed, "Ted and Joanna Kramer, Married April 4, 1970
" then Ted's hand reaches into  and picks it up
As he takes the cigarette box and balances it on a stack of scrap books, photographs, ash trays, etc
, etc
, that he is carrying
He crosses to another table, picks up a framed photograph of Joanna and Billy and piles that on top of everything
We realize that Ted is going through the apartment from top to bottom and methodically cleaning out every trace of Joanna that he can find
: : As Ted goes through the room, picking up Billy's clothes which have been strewn every which way
as he carries them into Billy's room
' Billy is fast asleep, the only light coming from the night lamp on the dresser
Ted dumps the soiled clothing in a hamper, hangs up Billy's jacket, then he neatly folds the boy's sweater and crosses to the dresser
As Ted opens a drawer and starts to put the sweater away
Suddenly he spots something
: There, in the drawer, sitting on top of a pile of clothing is one of the photographs of Joanna that Ted put away this afternoon
Billy has retrieved it and hidden it here, hoping that Ted wouldn't find it
As he takes a long look at the photograph, then turns to his son
Billy asleep, tangled up in the covers
He removes the photograph from the drawer, crosses to the bed and places it on the nightstand nearby so that Billy will be able to see the picture of Joanna when he wakes up in the morning
He sits for a moment longer on the side of the bed and reaches across and smooths down his son's rumpled hair
: ' Clearly in a rush, loading his briefcase with work to do that evening
He starts for the door and as he walks along the outer office corridor, heading for the elevator
As he passes the door to 'Connor's office: (calling out) 'Night, Jim
' (
) (calling out) Hey, Ted
'mon in
wanna' talk to you
Reluctantly Ted stops, turns around and walks back to the door to 'Connor's office
: '' 'Connor sits back in his chair, his feet propped on the desk a drink in one hand
' (jovial) What's the big rush
'mon in, put your feet up, have a drink
Hanging in the doorway, clearly anxious to leave
Can't do it tonight
Gotta pick up Billy
'm late
' (paying no attention to that) Listen,  heard a terrific joke today
There's this Polish skydiver (urgent) Sorry, Jim 've got to go
'll talk to you tomorrow
And before 'Connor can say anything he is gone
' Obviously displeased
He sits for a moment, drumming his fingers on the desk top, then reaches for the phone and starts to dial
moment later: ' Murray
Jim 'Connor, why don't you drop by and have a drink
: As Ted emerges from the building, starts to hail a cab
: , As the cab pulls to a stop
Ted leaps out and rushes inside
: The elevator doors open and Ted steps out
as he crosses to the doorway of an apartment, rings the bell
As the door is opened by a pleasant-looking woman in her thirties
This is
She has the slightly haggard look of someone who has just survived a birthday party with eight five-year-olds
In fact, behind her we  an abundance of crepe paper and balloons
(apologetic) Mrs
Kline, 'm sorry 'm late, but That's all right, but 'm afraid Billy was a little nervous
(she glances off screen) Billy, his coat on, his goody bag in his lap sits alone on a bench in the foyer
The moment he sees his father, he gets up and starts for the door
(to Ted, accusingly) You're late
'm sorry, pal, but  had a meeting and (to Mrs
Kline anxious to get away) Goodbye
Goodbye, Bill
Thank you for coming
(calling out to her son in the next room) Mark
Say goodbye to Bill
(
) (preoccupied) Bye
Bye
And he hustles his father out into the hallway
Once door is shut behind them: (sullen) was waiting a long time
By now they have crossed to the elevator
Ted rings the bell
(this ain't exactly the greeting he's expected) It wasn't so long, 'm only
(checking his watch) twenty minutes late
The elevator doors open
All the other mothers got here a long time ago
And the doors close, blocking them from view
: Ted and Billy sit at the dining table, a large pizza between them
Ted is working hard, trying to establish some kind of rapport with his son
Billy is silent, he picks at the slice of pizza in front of him
(more of the camp counselor) How was school today
Okay
Same as usual
Billy, don't eat with your fingers
(morose) Sorry
There is a long beat of silence
(like pulling teeth) Well,  see the Yankees finally won a game
Mom,  mean dad
Yeah
Can  be excused
'm not hungry think 'll go to bed
Sure
Too much birthday cake, right
(as he gets up from the table) guess
As Billy shuffles off toward his room
Ted sits for a beat picking at the food on his plate
as he gets up from the table and walks into his room
as he takes off his shirt and pants and leaves them lying on the floor
The boy crosses to the closet, gets his pajamas and puts them on
Standing in the doorway, watching
Goodnight
He starts to crawl into bed
(aloof) 'Night
as he crosses to where Billy dropped his clothes on the floor, picks them up
Listen, pal, 'm sorry, okay
Silence
know how you feel
Silence
Ted crosses, sits on the edge of the bed
Look,  remember one time when was a couple of years younger than you are now and
was staying with this cousin of mine and my parents were supposed to come and pick me up by three, but it got later and later and they didn't and they didn't show up and  remember  got really scared that something had happened to them and  remember when they finally came instead of being happy to see them  was very angry and
Billy,  promise 'll never do that to you again, okay
Silence
Billy
Okay
His face is turned to the wall
as we him nod
' Note: The following scene, which is written as one, is actually to be played so that each time we cut back to the woman who is being interviewed as housekeeper, it is a different woman: sometimes nervous and excited, sometimes large and lugubrious, with six shopping bags, sometimes looking like a headmistress at Dachau
They are uniformly (until the last) unappetizing
Throughout this, we  Ted becoming increasingly desperate
(looking around nervous) It's very big
They didn't tell me it was this big
(apologetically) No
No, actually it's only two bedrooms
(sniffing) Phew
This place is a real pig sty
(defensively) Look, my wife just walked out on me
Okay
It's been a tough week
Don't tell me your troubles, mister
got enough of my own
Note: With the   we begin on a  and to  that we are in Ted's office and it is the middle of the afternoon
' The first thing is,  don't do floors
At that point the door behind her opens and 'Connor pokes his head in
' Ted
(ignoring him) Or windows
come in at ten and get Wednesdays off
' Ted
(brisk) 'll be with you in a minute, Jim
(back to the woman) You couldn't make that Saturday, could you
: (
) She is a slightly built attractive woman in her early sixties
There is a long pause as she looks around
What kind of boy is your son
This is the first person that ever asked about Billy
(taken aback) Well, he's
ah, he's a good kid
He's shy and
think he's probably very creative and
Could  see him
Sure
He's right in here
As they start toward the child's room
: ' In the darkness we can  Billy, all scrunched up in the covers
as the door opens and the light from the hall falls across the sleeping boy
Ted and Mrs
Willewska stand silhouetted against the light
Oh
He's very beautiful
As he stirs, in his sleep
(
) Mr
Kramer, you are a very lucky man
, This is the first time since Joanna left that this has occurred to him
Mrs
Willewska, could you start on Monday
: as they wheel a shopping cart along the aisle
Ted has a shopping list in his hand
Ted stops, takes a box of detergent off of the shelf, starts to put it in the shopping cart, when: (worried) Mom,  mean dad
(his mind elsewhere) Uh huh
That's not the right soap
We use the kind in the green and yellow box
'mon, there's not much difference (firmly) We use the green and yellow
Ted looks at his son for a moment, then carefully replaces the detergent that he had originally picked and reaches for the green and yellow kind
They continue on for several steps and Ted stops again, this time looking for a dishwashing liquid
He starts to reach for one, stops, looks around at Billy
Billy shakes his head
Ted points to another
(shaking his head again) The pink stuff
Ted takes a bottle of the pink stuff, puts it in the shopping cart and consults his shopping list
Okay, what color cereal do we get
: , It is that same afternoon and Billy (his clothes are much dirtier by now) is running back and forth with a group of other children
'  (
) Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain and buy him an ice
He sits on one of the playground benches, the work he took from the office stacked beside him on the bench
Sitting next to him is a personable-looking man of about Ted's age
He is nattily dressed in a suit complete with vest, tie and polished Gucci loafers
We will call him
Note: The Saturday Father and his daughter (a pretty young girl of about ten) will appear from time to time throughout the film
He is a divorced father, putting in his time, not giving a shit about the child
The Saturday Father insists on treating Ted as though they were members of the same secret fraternity
And he comes to represent Ted's nightmare of what might happen to him
(looking in the direction of the voice) What
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice
It'll kill twenty minutes
've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill
Tough
(checking his watch) get off duty at five-thirty
(bored, anxious to make conversation) How long you been divorced
(surprised) Three months
How can you tell
You've got that look
My lady and split two years ago in August and 'm an old pro at this shit
First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo
It's pure hell  if  never see another chicken, 'll be happy
(calling out to his daughter  ) 'm here, darling
Don't worry
Finding this distinctly unpleasant
He glances around, looking for Billy
The sprinkler area
Other children are running around, but there is no sign of Billy
(calling out) Billy
Another area of the playground
Billy is nowhere in sight
As he grabs his stuff and starts toward the exit of the playground
(louder) Billy
Looking in another direction
Nothing
Standing among a crowd of people just outside the entrance to the playground
He is looking around wildly
Billy
There in the distance is Billy Kramer, running as hard as he can away from Ted
as he starts to chase after Billy
It is clear that Billy is running with a purpose
(
) Billy
Billy pays no attention to him
as he continues to chase his son
Closer now, we can  that ahead of Billy is a woman that, from behind, looks remarkably like Joanna
As he realizes what is about to happen
Catching up to the woman
Mommy
Mommy
moment later he gets close enough to grab onto her skirt
As the woman turns around: Quite clearly it is not Joanna
His face becomes impassive again
All the excitement vanishes
Oh
thought you were my mommy
His face reveals all of the pain that Billy's can't
: , As it opens and Billy Kramer, wearing an outsized moustache, a makeshift cape and a stovepipe hat made from construction paper
He stands for a moment, looking around, finally he spots someone, grins and begins waving
Across the room eighteen to twenty mothers (Ted Kramer is the only man present) are gathered, sitting on tiny chairs and at work tables watching as their children put on a show
Suddenly he forgets his lines, looks around nervously moment later a very pretty young teacher leans over, whispers in his ear
Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to the greatest show on earth
Welcome to the
(he forgets again) He leans forward mouthing the words as the teacher prompts Billy
Greatest
Greatest
Show
Show
On earth
On earth
Ted breathes a sigh of relief, his son having gotten through it
- : look of total pleasure on his face
From time to time when Billy does something particularly difficult, Ted nudges the woman next to him
Note: In all of the shots of Billy we  the teacher there guiding, helping, over and over and over we cannot help but notice how attractive she is
Toward the end of the show Ted's  occasionally follows the teacher rather than the child
: The show is over and the parents and children mill around eating popcorn, drinking lemonade from paper cups
Ted stands off to one side, talking to the teacher as Billy runs around
Mr
Kramer,  just wanted to tell you what a wonderful boy your son is
(clearly attracted to her) don't know
've been worried
(glancing around, making sure Billy is out of earshot) mean, with what he's been through and everything (solicitously) No
No
Billy is doing just fine
(giving himself a few points) Well, you know it's not easy raising a kid on your own and  thought if we could get together and, uh, discuss At that moment one of the class mothers interrupts, reaches across Ted and takes hold of the teacher's hand
(effusive) Barbara
Congratulations
When is the baby due
() Oh, God
Not 'til August
Inadvertently glancing at the teacher's stomach, nothing shows
As she turns back to Ted
Excuse me
You said you wanted to talk, Mr
Kramer
(embarrassed) Yes, but
ah, not now
(checking his watch) 've got an appointment
forgot all about it
As Ted begins beating a hasty retreat, : as he walks down the street carrying a large and elaborate papier-mache art thing that Billy made in school
-     : As he manages to notice every single pretty girl that passes, thread his way through the crowd and still balance Billy's enormous work of art
: As they open, Ted squeezes off and , he crosses the waiting room and enters the offices proper
He pauses at his secretary's desk and deposits Billy's papier-mache thing
She jumps up from her desk, takes the papier-mache thing and her notebook in hand, and follows Ted as he walks down the corridor towards 'Connor's office
Mr
'Connor called
There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late
(in a rush) know
know
Mr
Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday
No
Uh, uh
Tell him  asked for it Friday
want it Friday
Period
Mr
Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday
Fine
By now they have reached the board room
He enters without knocking, his secretary still in tow
And Mrs
Kelsey called to ask if Billy can come to Stephanie's birthday party on Tuesday
: The room is filled with executives in three piece suits and 'Connor who is doing a lot of backing and filling
(as he enters) Yes
Remind me to pick up a "Crying Chrissie" doll at lunch on Tuesday
' Clearly he is very irritated at this
' (sardonic) If it's all right with you, Mother Kramer, can we get down to work now
: ' It is a real mess, legal files and law books scattered everywhere
In the midst of all this chaos sits  , as we said before, she is about thirty, very pretty in spite of her glasses
She looks up as Ted enters
It is clear from their attitude that they have known one another for a long time and are very relaxed together
Hello, Kramer
He drops into a chair and shoves a stack of papers across the desk to her
Hiya, Phyllis
These are the Revlon contracts
thought you ought to check them out
Sure
She takes the papers and starts to rifle through them, stopping every so often and making a note in the margin
As she does, we notice that the second and third buttons of her blouse have come undone and that she is not wearing a bra
As he realizes this
She glances up to ask Ted a question about some point or other, notices the direction of his gaze and, unself- consciously buttons up her blouse
She goes back to her papers as Ted continues to watch her
Not looking up from her papers
Yes
(baffled) Yes, what
(looks up, serious) Yes, 'll have dinner with you
: ' Although the room is dimly lit, we can  quite clearly that Ted and Phyllis are in bed together
They have finished making love and Ted lies back, half asleep
Phyllis reaches across to the nightstand, puts on her glasses and checks her watch
Kramer, 've got to go
've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street
(half asleep) Mmmmnph
'll get you a cab
But he makes no move to get up
Phyllis gets to her feet and in the dim light we can that, except for her glasses, she is naked
(as she crosses the hall on the way to the bathroom) That's okay
It's just that 've got these clients that are : There is Billy Kramer, standing by the toilet, buttoning his pajamas
He looks up at Phyllis
There stands Phyllis, naked as the day she was born, a look of stunned amazement on her face
(softly to herself) Oh, God
Too startled to cover herself
He looks her up and down, then: (very serious) Do you like fried chicken
Suddenly remembering to cover herself
(hoping desperately it is the right answer) Ah
Yes
So do
And he shuffles off to bed
Phyllis waits, frozen until he disappears into his room
Then, she turns and flees back into the bedroom
: As she bursts into the room, closes the door behind her, leans against it
(eyes wide) just met your son
Who has leapt out of bed and is scrambling into his pants
Like that
Phyllis nods
And
He wanted to know if  liked fried chicken
Do you
Phyllis nods rather frantically
(grinning) So what's your problem
: Stand side by side
He is cutting, chopping, making some kind of stew
Thelma stands nearby watching, sipping a glass of white wine
we can hear Billy and Kim running around, playing
You ever think about getting married again
No, not really
(she thinks for a moment, then:) guess it's different if you don't have children, but
dunno, even if Charley and  don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again
He'd still be my husband
That stuff about "Till death do you part
" That's really true
(nodding toward a cookbook that is propped open nearby) How many onions does it say to use
(without bothering to look in the book) Three
And add some basil
(as he does) 'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again
No
don't think so
'mon, Thel
So Charley had a little fling
So what
All in all he was a pretty good husband
Look,  know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay
mean forget the logic part
But  keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him
: The Saturday Father and his daughter, clearly with nothing to say to one another, stand eating ices from a nearby vendor
across to Billy, Ted and Phyllis
She is dressed in a very nice suit, silk blouse, high heeled shoes and looks distinctly out of place in Central Park on a Saturday afternoon
At the moment, Ted is trying to teach Billy how to bat
Now look, you hold it like this
(he places Billy's hands on the bat just so) and you swing like this
(taking him through the motions) Watching
She can't believe what she's seeing
Finally, she can't stand it any longer
(impatient) No, no, no, Kramer
That's not how you do it
Look
She crosses to Billy, gently takes the bat from him and demonstrates
you hold it like this
(showing him her grip) Farther down the bat
And you swing like this
(to Ted) Throw me one
As he gives Billy a look that says, we have to humor her
He throws a ball
As she swings, connects and slams a ball in a long, looping fly that goes at least two hundred feet
Watching the ball disappear in the distance, he turns back to Phyllis, open-mouthed
Embarrassed, she grins, shrugs and hands the bat back to Billy
: '' 'Connor, Murray and the Art Director are in 'Connor's office as the door opens and Ted enters, carrying a pile of papers, charts, graphs, etc
, etc
Okay, Jim
Here's the report on
He stops in mid-sentence, looks around
On the walls are a series of mock-ups of the various Fire and Ice ads, none of which are what Ted and 'Connor had agreed upon
(surprised) What the hell is this
' (innocent) Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs
(weakly) think they're kind of interesting
(bugged) don't
Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about
It's not even close
(oily) Ted, basically it's still your concept
' (chiming in) Murray just added a few things, that's all
Now hold it right there, 'm the one that went in and sold Revlon on this idea to start with, remember
You said  was going to be Sound-effect: The phone rings
'Connor picks it up
' Yeah
He listens for a moment, then hands the phone to Ted
' It's for you
As he takes the receiver
(puzzled) Yes
Then, embarrassed, he turns his back and lowers his voice
Look, Billy,  told you before, one hour of
a day, that's the rule
No
(clearly, Billy is giving him an argument) don't care what the other mothers do
Listen,  can't talk now, 'm in a meeting
(firm) Billy, 'll talk to you later, good- bye
Note: During the phone call, the    to Murray & 'connor, looks of bored Condescension and smug superiority on their faces
Ted hangs up the phone and turns back around
(smooth) Ted,  appreciate what you're saying, but  really think you're just too close to it right now
' (quickly) Murray's right
(reassuring) Look it's just some ideas, okay mean nothing's locked in cement promise you this is your show
Not very reassured
' Trust me on this one, Ted
: Ted is sitting at the dining room table, working
Spread out all across the table are layouts, rate sheets, etc
, etc
Billy sits across from him drawing on a pad with felt-tipped pens
, then: (worried about something) Mom,  mean dad
(busy) In a minute
beat of silence then: What do you do when an elephant sits on your fence
Silence
You get a new fence
(he hasn't heard a word) 'mon, Billy
'm trying to work for God's sake
Another beat of silence, then Billy reaches for his glass of Hawaiian Punch and accidentally tips it over, spilling purple liquid across all of Ted's papers
Instantly, Ted is on his feet, yelling
Goddamnit, can't you watch what you're doing
-  : (quiet) 'm sorry
Je-sus Christ
catch all kind of shit at the office because 'm not pulling my weight because 'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and 'm sorry
(sardonic) That's terrific
That's really terrific, but  notice 'm the one that's cleaning up this (noticing an important paper covered with grape juice) Oh, crap, 'll have to do this one over
(starting to help) 'm sorry
By now there is nothing the boy can do right
Look, it's after your bedtime, okay
Just do me a favor and go to bed, okay
Billy gets to his feet, collects his stuff and walks into his bedroom
who sits for a moment, then gets wearily to his feet and as      crosses to the door of Billy's room
He stops in the doorway, looks Billy struggling to get his pajamas on, having a hard time
-  : Look, 'm sorry  yelled, okay
(quiet) That's okay
It's just
've been catching a lot of flack at the office
That's okay
'' As it opens and Phyllis comes out
In the background in 'Connor's office we  'Connor and Murray, talking, laughing
Phyllis as she walks to Ted Kramer's office and opens the door without knocking
How about lunch, Kramer
'm buying
: , As they sit across from one another
waiter stands over them, setting drinks in front of them
Perrier and lime
(placing a drink in front of Phyllis) and scotch with soda
(putting Ted's drink in front of him) The waiter bustles away
Okay, Phyllis, what's up
Kramer
She breaks off, uncertain whether or not to go on
Then, making up her mind, she reaches across, takes Ted's scotch and soda and drinks half of it down in one gulp
(in a rush) 'Connor's out to get you
He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you
(stunned) What
Phyllis nods
(angry) don't believe it
That's crazy
Why would Jim do something like that
Phyllis polishes off the rest of Ted's drink
(angry herself) You want to know why
'll tell you why
(signaling to the waiter) Another scotch and soda for the gentleman
(back to Ted) 'll tell you exactly why
Because you're not his buddy anymore
Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him
can't
've got Billy to take care of
(exasperated) You dope
'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy
All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home
(stiff) don't believe you
The waiter sets Ted's drink on the table in front of him
He starts to reach for it, but Phyllis is quicker
(taking a stiff drink) All right
Okay
But tell me something, Kramer
Who do you think is palling around with 'Connor these days
Ted shrugs
How should  know
Murray
, Stunned, but trying to be nonchalant
So
what's so terrible about that
(would like to take him by the shoulders and shake him until his teeth rattle) Oh, for God's sake, Kramer
You have got to be the world's most naive human being
(leaning forward) Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign
Every layout
Every idea
Every single thing, right down the line
No
No,  don't believe it
Jim 'Connor would never let anything like that happen
He gave me my shot in this business
If it wasn't for Jim 'Connor 'd be   don't know where 'd be
He's a wonderful man
(apologetic for having upset Ted) Kramer, 'm sorry
All  was trying to do was (cutting her off) don't want to hear another word against him
Not another word
He's a wonderful man
a wonderful man
: ' : The finished proof of the ad that Murray had done, that Ted had seen in 'Connor's office
as he steams out of his door and marches along the corridor to 'Connor's office
(as Ted brushes past her) 'm sorry, Mr
'Connor is in conference
But it is too late
Ted barrels into 'Connor's office without bothering to knock
: '' 'Connor is alone in the office
He looks up startled as Ted comes barging in
(furious) All right, Jim
You said  was running this show, right
You said no decisions without my approval, right
(brandishing the ad) Well what the hell is this
What's going on, Jim
' (embarrassed) Well, ah
thought it over and decided we're doing it Murray's way
Jim, this is garbage
This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about
None of it
You can't ' (tough) That's my decision, Ted and that's final
: Who sits looking down at the plate of food in front of him as though it was a coiled rattlesnake about to strike
What is it
Preoccupied, jumpy
He is eating, but he doesn't taste a thing
Salisbury steak
hate it
You don't hate it
We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine
(stubborn) No  didn't
hate the brown stuff
It's gross
(strained patience) All it is is onions and gravy
'm allergic to onions
You are not allergic of onions
You've had them lots of times
(sullen) want a pizza
(trying not to lose patience) No
This is fine
Just take a bite, you'll like it fine
Reluctantly, Billy takes a tiny bite
He barely puts it in his mouth before he spits it out with a great show of being physically ill
think 'm going to throw up
(getting pissed off) Oh, for God's sake
Here
He reaches across and scrapes most of the sauce off of the meat
There, okay
Now that's just plain old hamburger
Some of the brown stuff is still there
(through clenched teeth) Then eat around it
No
(anger building) Now listen to me, young man
Do you know what  had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table
(obstinate) don't care
hate it
want pizza
(blowing up) Not on your life
That's it
've had it with crap around this house
From now on, no more pizza
Get it
Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being
No
By now both of them are out of control
You want to know something
You are a spoiled selfish little brat
Now eat Billy takes his plate and looking his father straight in the eye deliberately overturns it, spilling food everywhere
He is out of his chair like a shot, crosses to Billy and jerks him to his feet
(yelling) Goddamnit
Go to your room
He half-carries, half-drags the child kicking and screaming into his room
(at the top of his voice) Owwww
You're hurting me
You're hurting me
hate you
hate you
(seething) You're no bargain either, pal
want my mommy
want my mommy
By now they have reached Billy's room
Ted dumps him on the bed unceremoniously and starts out of the room
(sobbing) want my
mm
ommy
want mmmy
mommy
(at the door) Tough shit
You're stuck with me
And he slams the door behind him
: The dining area
Ted sits down and tries to resume his meal alone
(
) (sobbing, fighting to catch his breath) want my
mmmo
mmmy
want mmmy mmo
mmy
As he lifts his glass to take a drink and we can  that he is shaking like a leaf
: As he finishes doing the last of the dishes, dries his hands and looks around to make sure that everything has been put away
He flips off the light and, as , he walks from room to room, turning off the lights, until he reaches the door to Billy's room which is still closed
Ted hesitates for a moment, then eases open the door and steps inside
: ' ' Billy lies sprawled across the bed, all tangled up in the covers
As he crosses to the sleeping child and starts to straighten the covers
(tentatively) Daddy
(all anger gone) Yeah
'm sorry
(kisses him) That's okay, pal
Go back to sleep
It's very late
He starts to get up, when: Daddy
Uh huh
(very quiet) Are you
gonna go
away
Stunned at the question
Of course 'm not going away
love you very much
'll be right here
There is a beat of silence, then: (it comes pouring out) That's why mommy left
isn't it
'Cause  was bad
The boy begins to weep
(he puts his arm around Billy and holds him close) Oh, Christ
Oh, Christ
(he thinks for a moment, then:) No, pal
Your mom loves you very much
The reason she left didn't have anything to do with you
(pause, this is very painful) Look,  don't know if this will make any sense to you, okay
But 'll try and explain
You see the reason your mom left was because
Well,  guess it was because  kept trying to make her into a certain kind of person
Make her be the way  thought a wife was supposed to be
Only she wasn't like that
She was
(smiles to himself) Well, she wasn't like that
And now, when  think about it,  can see she tried very hard to be like  wanted very hard
And when she couldn't, then she tried to tell me about it
Only  wouldn't listen
guess thought that if  was happy, that meant she was happy too
Only she wasn't
The truth is, the only reason she didn't leave a lot sooner was because she loves you so much
Joanna stayed until she couldn't stand me any longer and then she left
But it wasn't you, pal
It wasn't you
There is a long beat of silence as Billy thinks about this
Clearly an enormous burden has been lifted from his shoulders
Finally: Is mom ever coming back
You mean for good
Billy nods
don't think so
(thoughtfully) Oh
Ted gets to his feet, starts for the door
Now go to sleep
It's very late
Good night
Sleep tight
Don't let the bedbugs bite
See you in the morning light
Dad
Ted pauses in the doorway, smiles
Yes
love you
: As Ted runs along beside Billy, who is learning to ride a bike
Then, in the last shot, Ted lets go of the bike and runs along just behind
Slowly as Billy gains confidence he speeds up, leaving Ted farther and farther behind
Finally, as Billy glances over his shoulders
: ' As the boy, by now a considerable distance away, turns and waves
Waving back, a grin of enormous pride on his face
He glances around, embarrassed to make sure no one is watching and wipes tears from his eyes
: As it pulls to a stop and a mob of mothers and children get off
Among them we spot Billy and Ted Kramer as they cross the street and enter the school building
'  across the street, to a Coffee Shop with large plate glass windows facing the school
There, standing in the window, watching, is Joanna Kramer
and we a look of overwhelming pain on her face
: , Sitting on a bench, the area around them is stacked high with toys that the kids have brought with them to the park
we can  Billy and Kim racing around, playing
(a little too casual) Thel, you ever hear from Joanna
(also with deliberate nonchalance) Not for a couple of months
The last time  heard from her she was living in San Francisco
(surprised) California
(watching him) Uh, huh
She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis
She wanted to know all about Billy
There is a beat of silence, then: (the real question) She ever ask about me
(lying) Uh, huh
Yeah
What d'you tell her
told her you're doing a pretty good job
(

Daddy
Ted glances around: Billy and Kim are standing near the jungle Jim
Billy has a toy airplane in his hand
Daddy, look
Presenting Billy Kramer's Fantastic Superjet
And he begins to race around the area, making jet noises and holding the airplane in his hand
Watching him, smiling
Weaving in and around the benches
He turns and starts back towards Ted
As he does: : : Billy's foot, as he trips
As he starts to fall, still holding onto the airplane
: Watching, horrified
As he hits the concrete
He leaps to his feet, starts toward the boy
As he looks up
There is a terrible-looking gash running from his cheek into his hairline
Kim screams at the sight of the blood
(terrified) Daddy
: As Ted, carrying Billy, wrapped in his coat, comes barreling out of the park, nearly knocking over several people with shopping bags, and begins running like hell In the  we  Thelma and Kim chasing after him ,  , ,       , , ,
: ,  , He is covered with Billy's blood, it is on his face, his shirt, his trousers
At the moment 'he stands helpless, watching as, Off-Screen, a surgeon examines Billy's wound
(
) (calm, reassuring) That's good, Billy
That's a brave boy
Now then, how's that
Now we've cleaned it out
Billy lies on the examining table with the doctor bending over him
There
That wasn't so bad, was it
Billy doesn't say anything
Now then, you just wait here, Billy
want to talk to your dad for a minute
The doctor motions for Thelma to wait with Billy and he crosses to Ted who stands in the doorway
(low voice, again calm and reassuring) Your boy is very lucky, Mr
Kramer
One inch over and it would have caught the eye
But 'm going to have to take some stitches
(flat) How many
Ten
Ted closes his eyes, there is a sharp intake of breath
Because of the position of the wound and your son's age,  don't think there will be much of a scar
Otherwise 'd call in a plastic surgeon
Ted nods
Now, 'd advise you to wait outside
It'll be eas (like a shot) No
(reasonable) Mr
Kramer, there's (softly, but with real vehemence) Fuck you
He's my son
'm staying with him
: He holds his son tightly while the doctor stitches up the boy's wound
From    we can  Ted's face, but only the back of Billy's head
Although we do not see the stitches being made, we do  the doctor's hand, with the needle and surgical thread as it moves into and out of view with a slow, steady rhythm
Billy's hand clutches Ted's so tightly that the knuckles are white
(softly, as each stitch is taken) Ohhh
Ohhhh
Ohhhhh
(whispering to his child) It's okay, son
'm here
Just a little more to go
Don't worry, son
'm here
: It is late, only a few lights are still on
: ' He lies in bed, fast asleep, his head swathed in bandages
across to Ted, who sits in a nearby rocking chair, watching his son
, then Ted gets to his feet, walks quietly to the door and steps out into the hall, closing the door behind him
: Thelma having washed and dried the dishes is now wiping off the top of the counter top, more to keep busy than anything else
She looks around as Ted enters
How is he
Standing in the doorway
He hasn't changed his clothes and he is still covered with blood
(nods) He's okay
Thel, can  ask you a favor
Sure
don't mean a little favor
mean a big  favor
Thelma nods
She watches Ted closely
He doesn't look at her
Thelma, if  die (aghast) What
(quickly) didn't say 'm going to die, but if  should (deeply upset) Don't say that
don't want to hear you say that
(firmly) Thel, listen to me
If, on the million to one shot that  should (correcting himself) That anything should happen to me
Would you take care of Billy
(amazed) Me
You want me to take care of Billy
thought about it a lot and you're the only person  know that  trust with him
mean, if anything happened to me, he'd be okay with you
You're a good mother
Silence
Thelma looks away from him
(hastily) know it's not an easy thing to answer
Silence
She still cannot look at him
Look, if it's too much responsibility Thelma nods, unable to speak
You're sure
She nods again
Thank you, Thel
Thank you very much
: ' As he lies in bed asleep
Some time has passed and Billy's bandage is much smaller
as we Sound: From the street below, the regular six-forty-five garbage truck that serves as Billy's alarm clock
As he wakes up, struggles to his feet
as, eyes closed, he stumbles into the bathroom, pees, and still not remembering to flush the toilet walks into the bedroom and wakes his father
As the child turns and walks toward the kitchen, He heaves himself to his feet and, eyes closed, in much the same manner as his son, stumbles into the bathroom
He automatically flushes the toilet without bothering to look, walks into the living room, opens the front door and picks up the paper
As he starts into the kitchen, he meets Billy coming the other way carrying two plates, a doughnut on each
as he walks into the living room, carefully sets the plates on the dining table, crosses to the television set, and turns it on
He returns to the table, and sits down as Ted appears carrying two glasses of orange juice and vitamins
He takes a seat in the chair opposite Billy and opens his paper and starts to read
as they sit without talking, eating their breakfast  the only sound, a children's cartoon program coming from the
From time to time Ted glances up from his paper to look across at the cartoon
as we  that they have become roommates in the best sense of the word
' It is a gray, cloudy day in mid-November
Snow is falling
Sound-effect: a telephone ringing
Then: ' Hello
' Ted
' Joanna
: , As Ted enters, looks around
The Maitre d'hotel approaches
From his attitude, it is clear that Ted and Joanna were regular customers
' Good evening, Mr
Kramer
We haven't seen you for a long time
Mrs
Kramer, she waits for you in the back
Thank you, John
as he walks toward the back room of the restaurant
Several waiters approach and say hello, the piano player looks up and smiles
As he reaches the door to the back room
: ' She sits against the wall, a glass of white wine in front of her
She is dressed simply and no longer has a tan
Nevertheless, Joanna is still stunningly beautiful as she looks up, smiles
He stands watching her, his knees weak
It is impossible not to fall in love with her all over again
As he crosses to her table, sits down
Hello, Ted
You look well
So do you
The waiter appears, carrying a scotch and soda
He sets it down on the table in front of Ted
The usual, Mr
Kramer
(not taking his eyes off Joanna) Thanks, Gino
The waiter nods and promptly disappears
How's the new job
Fine
There is a self-conscious pause
From the bar, the piano player begins playing a new song
From Ted and Joanna's reaction, it is clearly a song that has meant a great deal to them in the past
They listen for a moment, then: Look at us, Joanna
Just like any old married couple having dinner
Who would believe it
Yes
How's Billy
The question he has been dreading
He's great
except
(not looking at her) Except he had
he fell and he cut his face
He
He has a scar, Joanna, from about here to here
(indicating where and how big) There is a beat of silence
moment of shared feeling
(he has to say it to someone) can't help but feel somehow
it's my fault
keep thinking could've done something  stopped it
You can't tell it from a distance, Ted
For the first time he looks up at her
What
-  : 've seen him
You have
few times
Sometimes  sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school
Speechless
He looks like a terrific kid
He is
(he still can't get over it) You sat in that coffee shop across from school (completing the sentence) Watching my son
Ted, 've been living in New York for the past two months
(amazed) You've been living here, in the city
(a deep breath) Ted
The reason  wanted to see you
want Billy back
You want what
(firm) want my son
'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street
want my son
Are you out of your mind
You're the one that walked out on him, remember
(trying to explain) Ted, listen to me
You and , we had a really crappy marriage (hastily) Look, don't get so defensive, okay
It was probably as much my fault as it was yours
Anyway when  left was really screwed up Joanna,  don't give a (she will be heard) Ted, all my life 'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother
Then all of a sudden,  was a thirty- two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child
went to California because that was about as far away as  could get
Only
guess it wasn't far enough
So  started going to a shrink
(leaning forward, very sincere) Ted, 've had time to think
've been through some changes
've learned a lot about myself
(like a shot) Such as
Silence
(boring in) Come on, Joanna, what did you learn
'd really like to know
Silence
(relentless) One thing, okay
Just tell me one goddam thing you've learned
There is a beat of silence, then: (quiet, determined) 've learned that  want my son
He reacts as though he has been slapped
Joanna, go be a mother
Get married, have kids
Don't get married, have kids
Do whatever you want
don't give a damn
Just leave me out of it and leave my baby out of it
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally - (getting to his feet) Joanna, go fuck yourself
And with that he turns on his heels and stalks out of the restaurant
: ' large, very plush office: lots of antiques, beautiful nineteenth century paintings on the wall along with autographed photographs of at least three ex-Presidents of the United States
Sitting behind a large and imposing desk is  , a handsome, formidable man in his early sixties
He is well-dressed, a cornflower in his buttonhole, that sort of thing
At the moment, Shaunessy leans back in his chair as Ted finishes his story
(leaning forward, intense) Look, she walked out on her own child, right
That's desertion, right
Mr
Shaunessy, 'm telling you it's an open and shut case
First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case
Especially where custody is involved
Got it
Ted nods
Second, the burden is on us to prove your ex-wife is an unfit mother
That means 'm going to have to play rough and, if  play rough, you can bet they will too
Can you take that, Mr
Kramer
Ted nods
Third, it'll cost you five thousand dollars
That's an astronomical amount of money to him
That's if we win
If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well
(determined) Fine
Good
You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr
Kramer
(down to business) How old is the child
Six
He shakes his head
That's tough
In most cases involving a child that young, the court tends to side with the mother
Agitated
This is not what he wanted to hear
But she signed over custody
Here
He digs in his pockets, pulls out a piece of paper and thrusts it at the lawyer
(glancing at it) 'm not saying we don't have a shot, but it won't be easy
(thinks for a moment) Mr
Kramer, do me a favor
There is something  find very helpful in matters like this
sit down and make a list of all the pros and cons on an issue
actually write them down and look at them
want you to do that, okay
Then, after that, if you're really sure you want to retain custody of your child  then we'll go in there and whip their asses
: Ted sits at the dining table, the supper dishes have been pushed aside
He has a legal pad in front of him and is writing
' The legal pad
On one side Ted has written "Pro" and on the other, "Con
" Underneath "Con" Ted has written a long list of the drawbacks involved in keeping Billy: Sex Life, Money, Possibility of Remarriage, Sleep, Emotional Dependence
The "Pro" side of the list is empty
He sits for a moment, staring at the list, then he crumples the paper, gets to his feet
: ' As Ted enters
He crosses to Billy's bed where the child is fast asleep, sits down on the edge, and starts to rub the child's back
love you Billy Kramer
(half-asleep) love you too daddy
Ted kisses the child, gets to his feet and starts toward the door
Sleep tight
Don't let the bedbugs bite
(almost asleep again) See you in the morning light
: '' 'Connor stands with his back to Ted, looking out the window
From the beginning this is clearly an awkward and unpleasant moment
' (scared to do what he is about to do) Look, ah
Ted
just got word from the guys at Revlon and
ah they did some marketing tests on our campaign and the results were
Hold on him listening as it slowly dawns on him that he is being fired
' (stiff) Disappointing
It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty five minimum, and
ah
they're not very happy and
Well, the guys have decided they want to
ah, re-think the entire concept and
Look,  don't like having to do this, okay
But mean, what  mean is
ah, 'm going to have to
ah, let you go (not really sure he heard right) Are you firing me, Jim
' He still has his back to Ted
' 'mon, Ted, don't get emotional
Okay
(whining) Look, this isn't exactly an easy thing for me to do, y'know
swear Murray and  did everything we could, but those sons of bitches were out for blood
mean it was all  could do to keep the account inside the shop
Look,  promise, if  hear of anything 'll let you know first thing
Ted,  want  'Connor looks around
' Ted
The room is empty, the door stands open and Ted is gone
'' Ted
: ' As Ted grabs a picture of Billy from his desk, takes his jacket and coat and stalks out the door
: As he walks along the street in a state of total shock
Behind him, in the windows of expensive stores we note Christmas decorations
: , Ted sits across from the interviewer, a polished young man in his middle twenties, very efficient, he sounds a bit like a tape recording
(glancing at a form Ted has filled out) Ummm, hmmm
umm, hmmm
(the good news) Well, this looks very good
Of course (the bad news) you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job
(panic) What
What do you mean,  don't understand
(patronizing) Mr
Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus
Look, you don't understand
need a job
've got a kid and (smooth) understand and 'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up
(ending any further discussion) after the first of the year
: Ted stands inside, talking on the phone , he hangs up the receiver and takes the employment section of the New York Times which is filled with listings he has circled and crosses off one
He goes on to the next, takes a dime from the stack on the shelf in front of him and starts to dial
: ' : Who stands at the sink doing the last of the dishes dishtowel is tucked into his belt, serving as an apron as we : Sound-effect: The phone ringing
Ted wipes his hands, picks up the phone
Uh, huh
' (from the phone) Mr
Kramer
Please hold for Mr
Shaunessy
Then, a moment later: ' Ted
They've set the court date just heard today
It's
(checking his notes) January sixth
(despair) Oh, Christ
John, there's some- thing  ought to tell you
My
ah, situation has
changed
lost my job
There is a long pause, too long
John
' (thoughtfully) Ted,  won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work
Ted doubles over the phone like he has been hit in the stomach
(softly, but with real feeling) Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life
' Ted
Are you there
Yeah
' Any prospects
(trying to make himself believe it) Don't worry
plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John
' (amazed) How the hell are you going to do that
(grim) don't know
The same young man sits across the desk from Ted
(smirk) Mis-ter Kramer, as  mentioned yesterday, this is a very bad time of year to look for work
Now 'm sure we'll have something for you by mid-February, March at the latest
Leaning forward, impatient
need a job, now
-  : The interviewer gives Ted a weary look
Then he starts to flip through the card file
(going through the motions) No
No
No
Finally he pauses at one card, pulls it out
(doubtfully) There might be something at
Walter Thompson
But
(shaking his head) don't think they're really serious
The position's been open for two months and
(shrugs) They may just be on a fishing expedition
(cheerful) 'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first (checking his watch) Call up the people at
Walter Thompson
Set up an appointment at four
(politeness strained almost to the breaking point) Mis-ter Kramer, it's
(checking his watch) almost four now
It's the Friday before Christmas
Nobody is going to want to (leaning forward, tough as nails) Either you call and set up the appointment, or 'll call
And if call, you lose the commission
(arch) My, we are a hot shot aren't we
Ted is already on his feet and halfway out the door
You bet your ass
: , It is dark outside and the lights are on in the office
From beyond the door, we can hear the sounds of a Christmas office party in full swing
The advertising manager
balding man in his mid-forties, he wears a suit, complete with vest
At the moment he sits behind his desk listening to Ted's spiel, from time to time he glances at the resume on the desk in front of him
(
) So, Mr
Ackerman, as you can see from my resume, my experience in setting up the leisure package concept means that 've spent a lot of time working along the same lines as your multiple buys and your regional advertising ideas
know the pitfalls, but  and this is more important   know the potential revenue for the company inherent in these programs
As he finishes
He sits back, pleased with himself
-  : Well, Mr
Kramer,  must say this has been very impressive
'd like to think about it and get back to you
(leaning forward) Mr
Ackerman, is there anyone else that  should see before you come to a decision
Mr
Spencer, our Advertising Director
(no time to waste) Could  see him right away
(taken aback) 'm sorry, but he's leaving this evening for a two-week vacation
'll set up something the moment he gets back
He gets to his feet, starts to shake Ted's hand, ready to end the interview
'd like to see him now  before he leaves
Mr
Kramer,  don't think (means it) want this position very much
Ackerman gives Ted a long, considered look, then: Wait here
He turns and goes out the door
: , The large room is crowded with secretaries, junior executives, researchers, editors, ad-men, etc
, etc
They all have drinks in their hands and there is a good deal of kissing and general conviviality going on
as he steps out of his office, closes the door behind him and makes his way across the room to
, the Advertising Director
At the moment, Spencer stands with his coat over one arm and a drink in his hand talking to a very pretty young woman
Ackerman approaches him, whispers something in his ear
Spencer shakes his head and points to his watch
Ackerman says something else and finally, with a look of weary resignation, Spencer excuses himself from the pretty young woman and follows Ackerman back to his office
As Ackerman opens the door to his office,     so that we can  past them, into the office where Ted stands waiting
(as they enter) Mr
Spencer, Mr
Kramer
(not wasting any time) So you're the go-getter
All right, you've got ten minutes
As the door closes behind them, blocking our view, to a clock over the door
It reads five-fifteen
: ' Which now reads five twenty-two Spencer, now sitting in Ackerman's chair, his feet on Ackerman's desk
Ted has just finished his pitch
(sipping his drink) That's very interesting, Mr
Kramer
must say, it's very interesting
Let me think about it
'll let Jack
(indicating Ackerman) know and he'll get in touch with you
Spencer gets to his feet, starts to retrieve his coat
As he decides to take a gamble
Excuse me,  believe you said  had ten minutes
Almost at the door, looking around
Well
Checking his watch
That means 've got two minutes left
understand you're paying twenty- five
Spencer nods
(a deep breath, then a real huckster) All right, 'll tell you what 'm gonna do  'll take the job at twenty- two-five
Now, that's twenty-five hundred less than you're offering
The only thing is, you have to say yes right now
Not tomorrow
Not next week
Not after the holidays
It's worth it to me for a yes right now and 'll take twenty-five hundred less
There is a long beat of silence as Spencer and Ackerman look at one another
They were clearly not prepared for this
(watching them) Today only
One day only
Twenty-two five
Mr
Kramer, can we talk privately for a moment
Certainly
: As he steps out of Ackerman's office, sits down
Now, all of the fear, all of the anxiety that he has been fighting down comes welling up
What if he pushed too hard
What will he do if he doesn't get a job
If Ted Kramer could fall to his knees and pray, he would
- That swirls around him
We notice in particular, one very pretty young woman flirting with a number of men
She is wearing a dress with straps, one of them has broken and she has patched it with a piece of masking tape
Finally the door to Ackerman's office opens and he steps out
Mr
Kramer
Ted jumps to his feet, starts into the office
: ' He looks at Ted carefully for a long time, then: (grins) Welcome aboard, Mr
Kramer
There is an instant of relief, then, with astounding cool: Well, gentlemen, 'm pleased to be with you
As they shake hands, say their good-byes as he makes his way through the Christmas party that is still going strong
Then, suddenly, as he passes the very pretty woman we noticed earlier, he turns and kisses her
As a look passes between them, a sudden chemistry, something we have not seen in Ted before
(steps back from the astounded girl, grins) Merry Christmas
: As it pulls to a stop, the doors open and, along with the usual flood of mothers and children we  Ted and Billy
as they walk to school
Billy is talking a mile a minute, describing in minute detail the plot of an episode of " Dream of Jeannie
" Ted listens intently, then, almost involuntarily, he glances over his shoulder in the direction of the Coffee Shop
There, standing in the window, watching, is Joanna
As they continue to walk
Ted's eyes remain on Joanna
As they reach the door to the school, Ted looks at his son
(kissing Billy goodbye) You're a terrific kid, Billy Kramer
He stands watching as Billy rushes off into the building
Then he turns back and once again looks in the direction of the Coffee Shop
This time there is no one there
: as we : Sound:  telephone ringing
Then, a moment later: ' Hello
' Ted
John Shaunessy here
just got a call from your wife's lawyer
She wants to see the kid
: Ted Kramer, the phone cradled against his ear is cleaning up the remains of one of Billy's attempts to make the perfect peanut butter sandwich
Horrified
What
She wants what
' (he's been through this a million times) She's the mother
That means she's within her legal rights
(agitated) John, what if she kidnaps him
've heard all these (the patience of a saint) Look, Ted,  don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him
(doubtful) don't know, John
mean, to be brutally honest, 'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now
'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink
' (a flicker of interest) You ever see her talk to the walls
No, but ' Then you don't have a choice
Have Billy at the Seventy-Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten
: as they walk along the Central Park side of Fifth Ave
From their attitude it is clear that each of them, for their own reasons, is very nervous
' About half a block away Joanna paces back and forth
She hasn't seen them and it is clear that she is as nervous as they are
Ted stops, turns to Billy and gives him a last-minute check
Then, spotting a smudge he takes his handkerchief, spits on it and wipes the child's chin
Now satisfied, he takes Billy's hand and they continue
Suddenly: As he spots his mother
Mommy
: As she turns, spots Billy, starts to run
as he lets go of Ted's hand and starts to run flat out toward his mother
She kneels, opens her arms wide for him and he goes barreling into her, almost knocking her down from the impact
(somewhere between laughter and tears) Oh, Billy
Oh my Billy
Oh my son
Joanna gets to her feet and takes Billy's hand
(to Ted, but looking at Billy) 'll have him back at six
And they start off in the opposite direction
Realizing that Billy has not said good-bye, has not looked at him once
: Ted stands helpless, watching them leave
: Ted, now almost lost from view on the crowded street, still hasn't moved
: Ted and Phyllis, getting ready to go to bed
They look like a couple that has been married at least five years
Ted is busy talking as he takes off his tie, jacket and starts to unbutton his shirt
Phyllis is getting undressed also, hanging things in the closet, putting things away in drawers
But as Ted continues to talk, she watches him apprehensively, it is clear that something is wrong
(he has become an armchair lawyer) So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right
(thoughtful) Right
But it doesn't work that way
major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969  in the case of Haskins vs
Haskins
Kramer Now in Haskins vs
Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby
Kramer
There's something  ought to tell you
Yeah
've been offered a job in Washington with
He stops what he is doing, turns to her
And
(a deep breath) 'm going to take it
He sits down on the bed
It's a very good job  too good to pass up
'll be handling funding for the whole
(she stops, sits beside him on the bed) Look,
(she means love) "like" you a lot
And you
(she means love) "like" me, okay
Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different
(quiet) But it's not a year from now, is it
She shakes her head, then, reaches out and touches him
'll miss you, Kramer
It is open and standing in the doorway is an attractive woman, a bit overweight and very serious
This is
, the court appointed psychiatrist
Mr
Kramer
Yes
'm Dr
Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet
Oh, yes
Won't you come in
Dr
Alvarez enters the apartment
Ted helps her off with her coat
Where is the child
He's in his room, playing
Good
'll see him in there
As Ted carries her coat to the closet, Dr
Alvarez walks into the living room, looks around
Mr
Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone
Doctor,  attempt to conduct my social life discreetly
At the moment  am seeing no one
-  : Does that distress you
Not particularly
What does
The prospect of losing my child
(makes some notes, then:) Very well, 'd like to see him if may
They cross to the door of Billy's room
Ted opens it
' The room is a mess, blocks are stacked everywhere
Billy sits in the middle playing with his toys
They stand in the doorway
Billy
This is Dr
Alvarez
She would like to talk to you
(looking up from his toys) Sure
There is an awkward pause as Ted remains in the doorway
(pointedly) 'd like to talk to Billy privately
(embarrassed at being caught) Oh, yeah
Reluctantly, Ted leaves, closing the door behind him
as he crosses the living room to the couch where he has a stack of legal books and a number of note pads spread out
He is obviously continuing his legal education
,
(
) What do you have here, Billy
(
) Detroit
(
) Have you ever been to Detroit
(
) No
But 've been to Brooklyn
(
) see you have people there
What are their names
(
) That's Kim
and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs
Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin
(
) What about your mommy
(
) Oh, sure
Here, this can be mommy
(
) Do you like to be with your mommy
Ted by now has given up all pretense of working
He wags his pencil in the direction of the door
(the defense attorney) Objection
You're leading the witness
(
) Sure
(
) What do you like best about her
(
) Lunch in a restaurant
(
) What do you like best about your daddy
(
) Playing
(
) Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you
Eyes wide
He starts to get up
Objection
(
) Sure
Lots of times
This brings Ted all the way to his feet
He starts across the living room headed for the door to Billy's room
(
) (interested) When does he hit you
Ted has his hand on the doorknob, about to enter
(
) He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when  steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory
(
) In real life when does he hit you
(
) (laughing) My daddy doesn't hit me, silly
Why would my daddy hit me
: , It is a Saturday afternoon
as we  Ted Kramer and Billy approaching
Billy is talking a mile a minute
Ted listens intently, absorbed in the boy's description
As they turn into the entrance of the office building: , long corridor with desks for secretaries lined up next to doors leading to smaller individual offices
As they approach a door in the foreground that bears a small sign reading, "Ted Kramer": (interrupting Billy, who is still in the middle of his story) See
That's my name
(looking at the sign) It's my name too
Right
As he opens the door: : ' It is a pleasant enough office, but nothing spectacular, windows that look out over Fifty-seventh Street, simple Formica furniture, that sort of thing
As they enter
(he stops dead in his tracks at the sight of the office) Wow
(pleased) You like it
Billy crosses to the window, presses his nose to the glass, looks out
Wow
Is this really where you work
Ted nods, walks over to the desk and begins collecting paperwork to do over the weekend
As he does, Billy goes through the office, sitting in every chair, looking in every drawer
Is this really your desk
Yep
Is that really your chair
Uh huh
Wow
That's neat
Can  sit in it
Sure
Billy plops himself down in Ted's chair, swivels around
Did mommy ever see this
No, she never did
Are you going to get remarried
don't know
hadn't thought much about it
Are you going to remarried Phyllis
(shaking his head) No
There is a long pause, then: Will you and mommy get remarried
Ted stops what he is doing, looks across at Billy: No, son
Daddy and mommy will never get remarried
(looking around Ted's office) Boy,  bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you
: As it rings,     and we  Joanna sitting in bed wide awake, smoking
As she puts out the cigarette she has been smoking and starts to get out of bed, : ' Who stands with a cup of coffee in his hands, looking out the window, but not seeing anything
, then he checks his watch and starts for the bedroom
: ' As she selects a very conservative suit from her closet
: ' As Ted, now fully dressed, wearing a dark blue suit, white shirt, conservative tie, leans over Billy and wakes him
: Joanna sits across from her lawyer as he talks to her, intently, giving her last-minute instructions
: Taking Billy to school
They stop at the entrance, Ted kisses his son good-bye and stands for a moment watching as the boy runs into the building
: It is a bleak January morning, the streets around the courthouse are mobbed with people on their way to work
We Ted Kramer, a tiny figure among hundreds, coming out of the subway
He crosses the street and starts up the steps of the large and forbidding courthouse
: As Ted gets off the elevator and starts down the corridor, toward the courtroom
In the f
g
,  standing by the door of the courtroom itself is John Shaunessy, he greets Ted, they shake hands and talk together for a moment
Then, as they enter the courtroom: : As Ted enters, looks around
Mrs
Willewska sits in one of the back rows, wearing her best Easter hat
Ted pauses by her, thanks her for coming
Several rows in front of her is Thelma
Ted crosses to her, they talk quietly between themselves for a few moments
Then Ted moves on to a table at the front of the room where John Shaunessy waits
As they swing open and Joanna, along with her lawyer, a
as they walk to the front of the room and take their seats at the table opposite Ted and his lawyer
Oyez, oyez
The third Circuit Court of the State of New York, Judge Atkins presiding is now in session
All rise
As the judge enters, takes his seat
Opening business of the court
As Gressen (Joanna's lawyer) gets to his feet
Your honor
As our first witness would like to call Joanna Kramer
The lawyer leans across to Ted
(stage whisper) Real direct
Motherhood
They're going right for the throat
As Joanna gets to her feet, crosses to the witness stand and is sworn in
Note: Throughout the following, we continually - to Ted Kramer, leaning forward, listening intently
It becomes evident that, in spite of himself, there are moments he feels great compassion for Joanna
Now then, Mrs
Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married
Six years
And would you describe those years as happy
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult
Mrs
Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband
No,  did not
Did you wish to
Yes
tried to talk to Ted  my ex- husband  about it, but he wouldn't listen
He refuses to discuss it in any serious way
remember one time he said  probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby-sitter for Billy
Tell me, Mrs
Kramer, are you employed at the present time
Yes,  work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer
And what is your present salary
make thirty-one thousand dollars a year
Stunned
(switching tactics) Mrs
Kramer, do you love your child
(emphatically) Yes
Very much
And yet you chose to leave him
There is a long pause, then: (speaking carefully, with great thought) Yes
Look, during the last five years we were married,  had was getting more and more
unhappy, more and more frustrated
needed to talk to somebody
needed to find out if it was me, if  was going crazy or what
But every time  turned to Ted  my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it
He became very
don't know, very threatened
mean, whenever  would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack
Anyway, we became more and more separate
more and more isolated from one another
Finally,  had no other choice, had to leave
And because of my ex- husband's attitude  his unwillingness to deal with my feelings,  had come to have almost no self-esteem
(with feeling) At the time  left,  sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me  that my son would be better off without me
It was only when  got to California and started into therapy  began to realize wasn't a terrible person
And that just because  needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother
(to the judge) Your honor,  would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs
Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr
Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California
And with that he hands both the judge and Shaunessy a thick sheaf of papers
Then, turning his attention back to Joanna: Mr
Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York
Because my son is here
And his father is here
As a mother,  don't want my child to be separated from his father
Mrs
Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody
There is a pause, then: Because he's my child
Because love him
know  left my son, know that's a terrible thing to do
Believe me,  have to live with that every day of my life
But just because 'm a woman, don't  have a right to the same hopes and dreams as a man
Don't  have a right to a life of my own
Is that so awful
Is my pain any less just because 'm a woman
Are my feelings any cheaper
left my child   know there is no excuse for that
But since then,  have gotten help
have worked hard to become a whole human being
don't think  should be punished for that
don't think my son should be punished for that
Billy's only six
He needs me
'm not saying he doesn't need his father, but he needs me more
'm his mother
There is a beat of silence, then: Thank you, Mrs
Kramer
have no further questions
As he stands, collects his papers from the table and, taking his own sweet time, crosses to Joanna
Now then, Mrs
Kramer, you said you were married seven years
Is that correct
Yes
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way
No
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way
No
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic
No
heavy drinker
No
Was he unfaithful
No
Did he ever fail to provide for you
No
(wry smile) Well,  can certainly understand why you left him
Objection
(switching his line of questioning) How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs
Kramer
Permanently
Note: During the early part of Shaunessy's cross-examination, Joanna has been very forthright, very sure of herself
Now, as he starts getting tougher, she begins to falter
Permanently
(smiles, like a shark smiles) Mrs
Kramer, how many boy friends have you had  permanently
Her head snaps back as though she's been hit
don't recall
(boring in) How many lovers have you had permanently
(looks toward Gressen for help) don't recall
More than three, less than thirty- three  permanently
He is again on his feet, outraged
Objection
Overruled
The witness will answer, please
(almost a whisper) Somewhere in between
Do you have a lover now
(furious) Objection
(to the judge) Your honor,  would request a direct answer to a direct question
Does she have a lover
'll allow that
The witness will answer please
(in a whisper) Yes
Is that
permanent
(by now she is becoming thoroughly rattled) don't know
Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say "permanently" if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent
' Gressen jumps to his feet
Objection
must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness
Sustained
(a new attack) Mrs
Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult
(red in the face) Objection
Sustained
'll ask it another way
What was the longest personal relationship you have had in your life  other than parents and girlfriends
(rattled) Ah
guess 'd have to say
with my child
(wonder, irony) Whom you've seen twice in a year
Mrs
Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life
(reluctantly) suppose
Would you speak up, Mrs
Kramer couldn't hear you
(louder) Yes
How long was that
We were married two years before the baby
And then four very difficult years
So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life
Objection
Overruled
was not a failure
(sarcastic) Oh
What do you call it then  a success
The marriage ended in divorce
(so angry she forgets her cool) consider it less my failure than his
(seizes on this) Congratulations, Mrs
Kramer
You have just rewritten matrimonial law
You were both divorced, Mrs
Kramer
(on his feet) Objection
(to the judge) Your honor, 'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at
(to Joanna) Mrs
Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life
Who sits silently
Please answer the question, Mrs
Kramer
(whisper) It did not succeed
(suddenly fierce) Not it
Not it, Mrs
Kramer  you
Were you a failure at the most important personal relationship of your life
Silence
Were you
(barely audible) Yes
Shaunessy smiles, turns his back on Joanna and walks back toward the respondent's table
No further questions
As Shaunessy sits down next to Ted
(leaning over, in a whisper) Jesus Christ
Did you have to be so rough on her
(tough) Do you want the kid or don't you
Shaken, she gets down from the witness stand, crosses to the petitioner's table without looking at Ted
She sits, leans across to her lawyer and whispers something in his ear
As he nods
: , ' Who sits in the witness stand
At the moment he is being examined by Gressen
Now then, Mr
'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you
' Eight, almost nine years
And did you have a close personal relationship
' (in a whisper) Yes
And how did you find his work
' It was good
He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler
And yet you fired him
There is a long pause
' (looking down) Ted was a good worker
But, ah
after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change
Look, know he had problems,  understand that
've got problems, everybody's got problems
But 've got a shop to run,  can't let that kind of thing get in the way
(quietly) guess  felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office
Thank you
have no further questions
Shaunessy stands up
Mr
'Connor, does the agency still have the Fire and Ice account
' (up tight) No
Mr
'Connor, can you tell me where you are employed at the moment
' (stiff) At the moment  am unemployed
If the petitioner has no further witnesses, we will hear the respondent tomorrow morning at 9:30
: Ted sits at the dining table poring over law books, writing copious notes on a legal pad
Billy sits across from him drawing in a pad with magic markers
as Billy looks up at his father
It is clear that something is bothering him
Mom   mean, dad
(not looking up) Uh, huh
What did you do when you were little
(still involved in his books) guess about the same kind of things you do
Did you watch " Dream of Jeannie
" (distracted) Uh, uh
We didn't have television then
Eyes wide
He finds this hard to believe
You didn't have
He looks up for the first time, smiles
Nope
It hadn't been invented yet
He starts to go back to work
(this is serious business) Was there apple juice when you were little
Yeah, there was apple juice
Was there Burger King
Uh, uh
There was no such a thing as Burger King
What else wasn't there
He takes a long look at his son, then closes the law book, puts his notes away
Well, let's see
There wasn't McDonald's
And there wasn't astronauts
And there wasn't frozen yogurt
And there wasn't
As he continues on about what wasn't, we : She sits in the witness stand being examined by Shaunessy
From her attitude it is clear that she is very wrought up, that all of this is taking a heavy emotional toll on her
Mrs
Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer
Six years
Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building
How often do you see Mr
Kramer and his son
(to the judge, by way of explanation) Charley, my husband, and  are
divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot
So,  guess we see each three or four times a week
Can you describe the relationship between Mr
Kramer and his son
It's beautiful
It's just beautiful
They have a beautiful relationship
Getting wearily to his feet
(patronizing) Objection, your honor
The answer is, to be generous, very vague
Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr
Kramer's care of his child
(fighting a losing battle with her emotions) Ted  Mr
Kramer, spends a great deal of time with his child
don't just mean hours,  mean good time, involved time
He reads to Billy
They play together
They talk all the time
(tears start) He is a very
kind man
a very
devoted father, and
and
(she turns to Joanna) And Joanna if you ever saw them together
there wouldn't be a trial at all
(she breaks down, weeping) Oh, shit
'm sorry
'm sorry
Note: during this we cross-cut to Joanna, who sits, staring at her friend, shaken
(gently) No further questions
Thank you Mrs
Phillips
(without looking up from his notes) No questions
Thelma leaves the stand and walks back to her seat
: Sitting in the witness stand
Mr
Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child
(speaking quietly) When Joanna (to the judge, correcting himself) my ex-wife  when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage
Well,  guess most of what she said was probably true
There were a lot of things didn't understand  a lot of things would do different if  could
Just like  guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change
But we can't
Some things, once they are done, can't be undone
Joanna says she loves Billy
believe she does
So do
But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue
The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy
When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man,  suppose she's right
But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex
guess 've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent: constancy, patience, understanding
love
Where is it written that a man has any less of those qualities than a woman
Billy has a home with me, 've tried to make it the best could
It's not perfect
'm not a perfect parent
(unconsciously echoing something Joanna said earlier) don't have enough patience
Sometimes  forget he's just a little kid
But  love him
More than anything in this world  love him
Thank you, Mr
Kramer
No further questions
As he gets up from the petitioner's table and crosses to the witness stand
(hard-lining it) Mr
Kramer, by any chance have you ever had a woman in your bed while your child was asleep in the next room
suppose
(pointedly) So do
Objection
Sustained
(switching to another line of attack) Mr
Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago
(not losing his cool) Technically, the agency lost a big account and seventy four people were let go
was one of them
(snotty) You were fired, correct
Yes, but 'm with
Walter Thompson now
don't think that will happen again
(snide) Give them time
Objection, your honor
Counsel is harassing the witness
(to the judge, pettish) Your honor, 'm only examining the man's employment record
He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job
Sustained
He is thoughtful for a moment, like a man trying to decide whether or not to drop the bomb
Then, turning back to Ted: (very tough) Mr
Kramer, did your child nearly lose an eye when he was in your care
Stunned
He looks across at Joanna
Joanna looks away
(boring in) Mr
Kramer, did you, or did you not tell the child's mother that you were responsible for the injury that permanently disfigured your child
Shaunessy is on his feet racing toward the bench
(vehement) Objection
Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings
(to the judge) While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred
(to Gressen) Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor
Yes, your honor
see
Well, you'll have to do better than that
Do you have any affidavits to support negligence
do not, your honor, however This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise
(back to Ted) Does the witness deny the injury took place
(before Ted can say anything) No, counselor, 'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning
Then  have concluded my questions
' Joanna sits, still not looking at Ted
She holds her face, one hand shielding her eyes
: As he makes his closing statement
: , Shaunessy and Ted stand talking, reviewing the case
Then the two men shake hands, the lawyer waves goodbye, turns and starts back into the building
as he walks toward the main exit
: , As he comes out of the building, starts down the steps
(
) Ted
He stops, turns: There, standing waiting for him is Joanna
His face a mask of cold anger
She crosses to him
'm sorry
just mentioned it in passing
never thought he'd use it
(sarcastic) Yeah, well he did, didn't he
Please, Ted
never would have brought it up if  thought 'm not interested, Joanna
Goodbye
As he turns and walks away from her, leaving her standing, watching him as he disappears
: It is a bleak winter's day
as they walk along, Ted carrying a bag of groceries, Thelma with cleaning
The children run around them, playing
You heard anything yet
(shakes his head) Any day
They walk in silence for several beats, each clearly lost in their own thoughts
Then: Ted
(preoccupied) Uh, huh
(this is hard to say) Ah, Charley and  are
Well, we're thinking about
mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together
(thunderstruck) You and Charley
Thelma nods
Really
Thelma nods
(conflicting emotions) Hey, that's terrific
(hastily) Maybe
said maybe
(apologizing for her good fortune) What  mean is, ah
don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so
She leaves the sentence unfinished
They walk in silence for several more steps
Then she takes his hand
(can't help grinning) Oh, God
Ted,  am really scared
They walk in silence for a beat, then Ted looks  , spots something: The Saturday Father, restless, bored, walking with his daughter who is also bored
It is clear that they have nothing to say to one another
He looks around, spots Ted, waves and starts in his direction
He reacts as though he has seen a vision of his own death
(to Thelma, urgent) 'mon
(to Billy and Kim) Billy, Kim
Let's go
As Ted ushers them across the street, away from the Saturday Father
: ' , crowded, rather posh watering spot
Shaunessy sits alone at a table for two, a drink in front of him
As Ted enters, spots Shaunessy and starts in his direction
' As Ted sits down
Well
As he looks up at Ted, says nothing
He realizes that they have lost
Oh, Christ
-  : The judge went for motherhood straight down the line
lost him
lost him
can't tell you how sorry  am
Oh, no
(reading from a piece of paper) Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January
That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month
That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period
(looks up at Ted) That's it
(grim) What if  fight it
(matter of factly) We can appeal, but  can't guarantee anything
(determined) 'll take my chances
It's going to cost
(his mind is made up) Don't worry
'll get the money
There is a beat of silence, then: 've got to tell you something, Ted
This time it'll be Billy that pays
This time 'll have to put him on the stand
As his last hope goes crashing to the ground
Oh, Christ no
can't do that just
can't
(he looks up at the lawyer in despair) Excuse me
'm sorry
just
That is all Ted can manage to say
He gets to his feet and rushes for the door
: As Mrs
Willewska comes out
Her eyes are red from crying
as she turns up the street on her way to pick up Billy from school as she meets Thelma
They stand talking for a moment, then Thelma turns and starts to run toward the building
: ,  ' They open and Thelma steps out
She runs to the door, begins to knock
(calling out) Ted
It's me
Ted
There is a beat of silence, then: (
) (very quiet) Please go away, Thel
just have to be by myself for a little while
Ted,  just heard
(
) Please, Thel
Thelma leans against the door and begins to sob
'm so
sorry
Oh, Ted, 'm so sorry
: : As Mrs
Willewska brings Billy back from school
: It opens and Billy and Mrs
Willewska enter
Billy sees Ted and rushes across to him
(excited) Daddy
You're home early
Did you get fired again
(laughing in spite of himself) No, son,  didn't get fired
(fake cheerful) 'll tell you what we'll do, okay
How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little
and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow
Just you and me
How 'bout that
: , then: : He sits at the dining table, a typewriter in front of him
As he begins to type, hunt and peck system, we: : The page in the typewriter
We  and  at the same time
(
) Joanna
This is by way of introducing William Kramer
He is a sweet child, as you will see
He is allergic to grape juice, but will more than make up for the loss in apple juice
He is also allergic to peanut butter from the health food store, but not from the supermarket
Don't ask me why
: As Ted mails the letter
(
) At times, in the night he will have nightmares, one particular monster is called The Face
The Face, as best as  can determine, looks like a circus clown without a body, and from what the pediatrician says, and what  have read, may be sexual fear of losing his penis, or a fear of his own anger, or just a circus clown he saw once
: As a sack of mail is loaded into a truck
(
) His doctor, by the way, is still Ed Davies
The Sundafed is for colds, one tablespoon every four hours will pack it in the blue suitcase
: ' enters the building carrying a bag of mail
(
) His best stories have been Babar and Winnie the Pooh up to now, with Batman moving up
His housekeeper has been Etta Willewska and she is the main reason for the note
She is a loving woman, conscientious, very concerned about Billy and more important, Billy cares about her
: , ' As it is dropped in front of a doorway
We  that the letter from Ted to Joanna is on top
(
) urge you to retain her
Her number is 722-8099, and  think she will take the job if it is offered
'm sure other things will come up
Ask me what you need to and  guess eventually we'll talk
: ' As she finishes reading the letter
(
) That's all  can think of, except to repeat what  said before, he's a terrific kid
'm grateful for the time we've had together and  feel am a better man because of my son
Ted
: It is a clear, cold beautiful winter's day
Ted and Billy walk along the beach at the edge of the water There are several beats of silence as Ted tries to think of how to begin
Finally: Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father
Now there is a man who is very wise
He's called a judge
And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with
Why does he decide
Because
Well, that's what he does
He's a very powerful man
Like a principal
Bigger than a principal
The judge sits in robes in a big chair
The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided
(a deep breath) he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment
(fake cheerful) And 'm very lucky
Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna 'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month
don't understand, daddy
(trying very hard not to cry) What don't you understand, pal
Where will my bed be, where will sleep
At your mom's
She'll have a bed for you in your own room
Where will my toys be
'll send your toys there and 'm sure you'll get some new ones
Who will read me my stories
Your mom
(worried) Daddy, what if The Face comes when 'm at mommy's
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay
Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it
Will you come and say good-night to me every night
Suddenly Ted can't stand it any longer
Look, it's getting cold
Why don't you go inside where it's warm
'll be along in a minute
Billy hangs back, watching Ted
Go on, scoot
The boy turns and runs back along the beach toward the house
Then, he stops, turns back to look once more at his father
Ted stands at the ocean's edge, his back to , weeping
: It is early Monday morning
: They stand side by side, like a surgeon and his assistant
Spread out on the counter in front of them are the makings of French toast
The following is done with great efficiency, in contrast to the first time we saw them go through the same ritual
They work in silence except for an occasional command
Each concentrating on this last moment of closeness, each doing his best to avoid thinking about Billy's departure
Finally: Looking at his father, trying to memorize the older man's face
Ted turns, sees his son watching him
(with false gaiety) Hey
What's doin' with that bread
Let's see a little hustle around here
: Billy's bags are packed and stacked neatly in the living room
Nearby, Billy and his father sit, silent, waiting
Sound-effect: The intercom from the lobby buzzes
Ted looks at his son, smiles
The boy smiles back
This is it, pal
Billy, fighting back tears, nods
Sound-effect: The intercom buzzes again
Ted gets to his feet and starts toward the foyer
: As Ted picks up the intercom: Yes
' Ted, it's Joanna
Can you meet me in the lobby
Alone
And she hangs up before he can answer
(to Mrs
Willewska, in the kitchen) 'll be back in a minute
: As they open, Ted steps out, looks around
The lobby is dark, the only light coming from the window
Joanna sits off to one side, wearing sunglasses
She looks up as Ted approaches, a small smile on her face
(abrupt) Okay, 'm here
Now why did you Ted, do you love him
Goddamnit, Joanna
What the (insistent) Ted, do you love him
He nods
love him too
don't think ever knew how much until now
There is a long pause as she looks at Ted, unable to speak
Finally: (a deep breath, then:) Ted, when we got married it was because  was twenty-seven years old and  thought  should get married and
when  had Billy it was because thought  should have a baby
and  guess all  did was mess up my life and your life and Joanna, what the hell is (urgent) Please
Please don't stop me
This is the hardest thing 've ever had to do
Struck by the urgency in her voice
After  left
when  was in California,  began to think, what kind of mother was  that  could walk out on my own child
It got to where  couldn't tell anybody about Billy   couldn't stand that look in their faces when  said he wasn't living with me
Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much  loved him
And  did
And won
Only
it was just another "should
" (she begins to break down) Sitting in that courtroom
Hearing everything you did, everything you went through
Something happened
guess it doesn't matter how much love him, or how much you love him
guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy
don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway
Ted,  think Billy should stay with you
(stunned) What
(she reaches out, takes his hand) He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two
He's yours
(her last ounce of reserve crumbles) won't fight you for him any more
He's yours
Oh, God
Oh, my God
Only can  still see him
No more waiting in Coffee Shops promise
Joanna's last ounce of reserve crumbles, she begins to sob
Ted puts his arms around her and holds her
They do not kiss
Then, after a few moments she steps back
(chin high) Okay
think 'll go talk to my son now
(wiping her eyes) How do  look
Beautiful
They step into the elevator and, as the doors close, blocking them from view, we
: as they walk to the park
They are deep in conversation, although we are too far away to bear what they are saying
and, as they reach the entrance to the park, Billy first, then Ted begin to run, overwhelmed with the sheer joy of being alive, of being together
As they continue to run, that they are only two among thousands of parents and children in Central Park on a sunny afternoon
until they are lost from view and it is
