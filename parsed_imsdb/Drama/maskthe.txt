Written by Mark Verheiden - The dragonhead prow of an ancient Viking ship cuts through the thick fog of the rough North Atlantic Sea

The crew's near mutiny
Ericson draws his broadsword with a flourish
Know this
The first man to turn will taste my steel in his guts
But we've surely gone far enough
That accursed box must be thrown off the edge of the world
We will go until we can go no more
Suddenly there is an ear-splitting  and the entire boat rocks violently as it runs aground
The  is thrown from his crow's nest
and straight through the deck right in front of Ericson
His pained voice floats up from the black hole
Land ho
Ericson wheels about just as the fog parts off the starboard bow

beautiful rustic coastline stretching off as far as the eye can see

He backs away, terrified, as burly Vikings, led by Ericson, muscle the over to the hole and quickly bury it
Ericson turns to an exotic-looking Eurasian Be quick, Witch
Let the deed be done
The Witch unravels a scroll and recites: Oh Loki, ancient one
Thy mischief dwell now in waters, base and bland
And in waves and sand thy magic forever sleep
As the Witch speaks, a strong wind kicks up and a black wall of clouds appears
The sky explodes in  and
The look about fearfully
(
) Back to the ship men, hurry
Captain, you've discovered a new world
It is your right to name it
Leave that to the Italians
We're never coming back here
Never
This land is now cursed

Cityscape of towering skyscrapers stands in the haze just beyond the crowded beach
:   - caffeine-driven
's voice booms over the beach-goers' radios
(
) Yessiree, it's a four-alarm sizzler out there today with highs in the upper nineties and no relief in sight
We have a third stage smog advisory and a metro traffic gridlock alert
Flourocarbons are up, the Dow Jones is down and we're expecting another Spike Lee movie any second
In other words folks, it's just another bee-youtiful day in Edge City

Freaky weather
, a bright0eyed amiable young account exec pauses by Charlie's desk and drops off a print-out
Hey Charlie, can you go over these stats
We're supposed to have a complete report before lunch
Charlie takes one looks at the complex print-outs and tosses them back
Woah
Sorry Stanley,  just had my weave tightened and my head is killing me
Be a pal and take those over to Hinkleman, will ya
, a cute young blonde now strolls by
Hi guys
Did you have any luck with those concert tickets Stanley
Stanley perks up at the sight of her
sure did
Friday night, just like you wanted
Oh, Stanley, that's wonderful
What time should  pick you up
Gee,  don't know
My best girlfriend just got into town and know she'd love to go
Can we get an extra ticket for her
Well
uh, actually it's sold out
was kinda lucky to get these
She's only going to be in town a couple of days and  just can't let her sit at home all alone
Are you sure there isn't something we can do
Stanley considers the situation for a moment, then pulls the tickets out of his pocket
You know what
Here
You two go
Oh Stanley,  couldn't do that
No really
Go ahead
It's okay
hate concerts anyway
All that, you know
music floating around
Maggie snatches the tickets from Stanley's hand
That is so sweet
Sheila's just going to love this
So maybe you and  can get together over the weekend
'm not sure what's going on, but just give me a call
You know like to be spontaneous
Oh, sure
Me too
Stanley Ipkiss, you are the nicest guy
Maggie gives him a quick air-kiss and hurries off to her teller's window
That's it
What
The kiss of death
As soon as they use the "" word it's all over
So maybe  am a nice guy
So what
You are a rug
am talking astro-turf here
You're letting these women sharpen their cleats on you
Hey, 'm a gentleman
If they can't appreciate that, it's their problem
You spend too much time being "nice" to a girl, you'll wind up sittin' around listening to her complain about the son of a bitch she really loves
Charlie, you are a very sick puppy
Wake up, Stanley
These are the nineties
We're dealing with an entire generation of dysfunctional love junkies
You can't romance 'em
You gotta confuse 'em
It's the only thing that gets their attention
() Let me demonstrate
You see that girl over there
Stanley looks over at the coffee service where an attractive young  is pouring herself a cup of coffee
(
) Hi Lisa
(forgets his name) Oh, hi
Charlie
That's right
Sorry
Lisa, this may seem a little odd, but my friend over there and were having this discusion and thought maybe you could settle it for us
'll help out if  can
() Actually,  don't know
this is kind of a personal question
That's okay
Go ahead
Alright
Just for the sake of argument, if  wasn't a happily married man
am  the kind of guy you'd go out with
Oh, um
don't know
() Well
yeah
guess  would
Lisa,  have terrific news for you
What
'm not married
Is this perfect or what
Listen, there's not a lot of women willing to come right out like that and admit they're attracted to a guy, but
Lisa  Charlie, turns on her heel, and marches off
(
) Jeez
make up your mind
Stanley gives Charlie the fish eye as he returns
Okay
Bad example
Some of these women got so much baggage they need an emotional sky cap
'll tell you what Stanley, tonight 'm gonna take you on a love safari, deep into the darkest heart of the urban jungle
And where's that
The Monkey's Paw
Hottest new club in town
It's a guaranteed skirt alert and no dead beats allowed
So how are we gonna get in
Woah, do  detect a little self-image problem there, buddy
You just leave everything to me
This, my friend is going to be the perfect night on the town
Suddenly a resounding peal of  rings out like the crack of doom
Sheets of rain pour down on the bank's windows
Pedestrians scramble for cover in the sudden downpour
- young woman scurries into the bank holding a newspaper over her head
She's soaking wet and pauses in the foyer to straighten herself out
Charlie immediately notices her
Hold the phone
Killer at three o'clock
Stanley follows his gaze
'
does a classic  - starting with the woman's million dollar legs as she squeezes some of the water out of her skirt
up past her body, which through her damp summer clothes is undeniable proof that there is a God
up
up
to her face as that newspaper is tossed aside
She's a heart-stopping woman/child with a Cupid's bow mouth and ice blue eyes
In other words she's trouble
Big trouble, also known as
Charlie may as well have just seen the Virgin of Guadalupe
(hushed reverence) Oh my god
perfect dime
The dame of dames
The Moby of my dick
Easy Charlie
You'll sprain your eyes
Tina now enters and walks towards Stanley and Charlie
Excuse me, where can  open a new account
Charlie flashes his best 100 watt smile
You've come to the right place, ma'am
Just step right this way and pull up a chair
Charlie tries to steer Tina to his desk, but she's still preoccupied with her damp clothing
Oh, 'm sorry
'm a complete wreck
Will you hold this please
She hands her shoulder bag to Stanley and peels off her wet blazer, creating another awe-inspiring visual moment
Here, let me take that for you
Charlie clutches her jacket with white knuckles
Thanks
But Tina turns and sits at Stanley's desk; Charlie is stunned at his near miss, but there's not a thing he can do about it
So, uh, what kind of account did you have in mind
(smiles sweetly) Well, 'm not sure exactly
'm just terrible with things like that
That's an interesting tie Mr
Ipkiss
Stanley Ipkiss
Tina extends her hand
Tina Carlyle
Pleased to meet you
The, uh
pleasure's all mine
Tina notices a box of Kleenex on Stanley's desk
May
'm such a mess
Oh
of course
Tina takes out a compact and daintily blots the moisture from her face
As  was saying about that tie
It's like one of those, what do you call them, ink blot tests
Rorschach test
She twists open a tube of lip gloss andbegins to run it across her incredibly lush liips
That's it
It looks like
um
young woman riding bareback
You know, like a Lady Godiva or something
Really
don't think  can
She slowly runs a finger along Stanley's tie
Or
if that's not a horse it could be two lovers
man and a woman
That would be the woman on top, of course
() Of course
She licks her lips and blots them on the Kleenex, leaving a perfect kiss impression and drops it on Stanley's desk
What do you see, Mr
Ipkiss
Stanley starts to get uncomfortable under her gaze
don't know
Bold colors
It's a power tie, y'know
They're supposed to make you feel
powerful
Does it work
Sort of
It's just a tie
Now, about that account
- as Tina drops her compact back in her shoulder bag and we see her flick a red
light on
She carefully adjusts the bag, aiming a tiny neatly concealed within it
Tina's pointing the bag at the open bank vault that stands a short distance from Stanley's desk
: - displaying the shot of the vault that Tina is broadcasting
-
' - a slick nouveau-mobster complete with diamond ear stud and Matsuda jacket watches the video broadcast from his sanctum; an eclectic post-modern playroom with an array of electronic toys and minimalist gun racks
Dorian sips nervously on a Yoo-Hoo as he watches the show
That's it sweetheart
little to the right
His two gunsels,   and   are busy at the back of the room playing air-hockey
Serious firepower is visible in shoulder holsters
(
) Hey, will you guys keep it down back there
Dorian's safe cracking expert, a black hip-hop artist named scribbles notes as he watches the screen with a practiced eye
That's cool, man
Freeze it right there
Dorian punches a button and the image freezes
What do you think, Doctor
Layout's not bad
We got us a sweet little Perkins/Jenning time lock
But them motion detectors are putting the chill on my thrill
Can you pull it off
Hey, you're talkin' with the Doctah, man
It's all about time and money
Yeah, well the meter's runnin' on this one
We got less than a week
Not cool
What about the coin
There's plenty
And 'll be happy to invest your share
What you talkin' about, man
This isn't about the lousy couple hundred thou' that's sitting in that vault, Freeze
That's chump change
Yeah
Then 'm chump number one, man
We gotta expand your horizons Doctor
Take a look
Dorian pulls back a curtain
An amazingly gaudy building stands on a pier across the river from Dorian's club
huge sign across it's archway reads: "Opening Soon Valhalla Casino"
(
) The Valhalla Casino
Twenty mil of glass, neon, booze and dice
World class sucker bait
The grand opening is Saturday night and it will drive this two bit club of mine out of existence
But  say if you can't beat 'em, take 'em over
Yeah
That's Arnie the Swede's place, man and he is one ice cold meatball eatin' motha fucker
Leave him to me
You pull off this heist and  promise you, it'll be all tits and champagne from here on in
: -  - The Mask lies tangled in a rat's nest of seaweed and garbage that's washed up in a culvert under a bridge
large   now creeps out along the garbage sniffing curiously at its timeworn wooden surface
It takes a tentative nibble
- begins to
to vibrate with its own magical inner life
The rat  and jumps back, disturbing the pile of garbage
The Mask is dislodged and floats back out into the river
Camera with the Mask as it follows the current into the dark heart of the city
: - Stanley and Charlie are riding along at breakneck speed in a taxi cab
Hold it up right here, please
gun port suddenly  open and the wild-eyed Albanian wheels about and cocks a huge
45 from his side of the riddled partition as the cab continues to barrel through traffic
Hold up
No hold up
keel you very well
splatter your guts big time, Mr
Cowboy Man
Stanley dives for cover
No
No
He only wants you to stop the cab
The driver instantly  on the brakes, throwing his passengers forward mercilessly
(now totally calm) Hokay
Pardon you very much
Charlie helps Stanley sit back up
It's alright, Stanley
() hate this town
really hate this town
Why are you getting out here
gotta pick up my car
Fine
Now don't forget
Ten o'clock at the Monkey's Paw
've already got us lined up with a couple of authentic dimes
Stanley steps out of the cab
Charlie, please
The last time you said that you showed up with two lesbian mud-wrestlers
Well,  can't promise we'll get that lucky again
Later
With a  of tires the cab peels back out into traffic
: '   - Stanley enters the grease spattered, cluttered garage and scans the area for signs of life
We can hear the -- of less than light-fingered automotive work in progress
Stanley  a little service bell sitting on a counter plastered with naked playmate decoupage and Mrs
Power Tool '93 calendars
Hello
, a lumbering unshaven behemoth of a man with permanently low- slung refrigerator repairman pants, makes his way past half rebuilt car carcasses towards Stanley
Hang on
Hong on
Don't get your panties in a twist
, a thinner version of Irv with Coke bottle glasses and a mop of greasy hair, pops up from beneath a car,  out of chunk of motor and wiring and holds it up to Irv
(examining part) Hey Irv, what the hell is this
(eyes it carefully) Ohh
dunno
About seven hundred bucks
They both laugh evilly as Irv slaps Burt on the back
Irv makes his way over to Stanley, still chuckling to himself
Now what can  do for you, Bub
'm here for the Civic
Japanese car, right
Kind of a nasty pea soup green
Well, they call it Emeral Forest, actually
Irv turns back to Burt
Burt
Pea green Civic
Burt pops back up from beneath the hood
Green Civic
Green Civic
Oh yeah
Brake drums are still on order and 'm only halfway through rebuilding the trans
But  just brought it in for an oil change
Yeah
Well you're lucky we caught those other problems before they caused some serious trouble
Alright
Alright
When will it be ready
Irv looks over at Burt, who gives him a "Make something up" look
Come back tomorro
(Burt shakes his head "no"
) First thing next wee
(Burt shakes again) next month
(Burt shakes an enthusiastic "yes"
) Yeah, first thing next month
That's if we can get the parts
What am  going to do in the meantime
can't afford to keep taking cabs all over town
Irv smiles a rotten-toothed smile
Oh, hell
we can take care of that
(to Burt archly) Hey Burt, bring around the loaner
(to Stanley) And for you little buddy, only ten bucks a day
: '  - The joint is jumping with musclehead  picking and choosing from the crowd of terminally trendy ' gathered around the entrance
light drizzle is falling
parade of swanky cars pulls up one by one as   scurry to keep up with the flow; glistening pearlescent Rolls Royce
fire engine red Ferrari
classic two tone Corniche in tan and burgundy
And finally a broken down Citroen in rust bucket red and spackle gray  up to the front of the club with a disgruntled Stanley behind the wheel
car hop attempts to open the door, but it's rusted shut
Stanley throws his shoulder into it and the door finally pops open with a  of metal
Stanley nearly tumbles out into the street
He smiles nervously at a high class couple looking with disdain at the eyesore-mobile
He pats the hood
It's a classic
The car hop jumps in and tries to throw the car into gear with a horrible
He finally waves over two other car hops who quickly push it off down the street
Hey, Stanley
Nice wheels
What is that, a Rolls Canardley
what
You know, a Rolls Canardley
Rolls down one hill canardley roll up the next
(he cracks up) We are not discussing the car, okay
Whatever you say, man
Charlie gestures expansively towards the club
What do you think
Pretty terrific, huh
This place make Sodom and Gomorrah look like Mayberry
Stanley now notices a life-sized poster of Tina Carlyle standing by the main entrance that reads "Featuring the Musical Stylings of Miss Tina Carlyle
" Hey, isn't that
Right
The wet dream from the bank
() Hold on
think  see my future ex-wife
Two rather tacky looking  beckon Charlie from the crowd
Hey Charlie
Charlie
() We're in luck
It's Barbie and Pebbles
Doesn't it bother you that all the women you know are named after cartoon characters
Barbie and Pebbles hurry over through the crowd
We've been waiting out here for hours
Can you get us in
No, problemo
Ladies, this is my pal Stanley Ipkiss
(leans closer) Stanley's very influential in the banking business
Charlie is truly in his element as he elbows his way through the crowd dragging his entourage with him
Charlie finally makes through the crush of badies at the entry way's velvet ropes and calls to one of the two hulking that guard the door
Hey Bobby
Bobby, buddy
What's happening man
Bobby completely ignores Charlie as he ushers a pasty faced and his underage  past the ropes
(
) (to the girls) This will just take a second
(to the other bouncer) Yo Nick
It's me
Charlie
Nick is also completely oblivious
Forget it, Charlie
refuse to stand here waiting to be judged by these power-mad steroid jockeys
How much cash you got on you
What
You heard me
How much you got
dunno, fifty or sixty bucks
Hand it over
No way
Hey, 'll pay you back
'm only carrying plastic
'mon man, you want to stand out here all night
Stanley begrudgingly starts to count out some cash
Charlie snatches the whole wad and elbows his way back around to the ropes
(subtly flashing bills) Hey Bobby
Bobby's uncanny tip radar suddenly lights up
Charlie, how you doin' man
Long time no see
Bobby unsnaps the rope for Charlie and gets the cash handshake he longs for
The crowd surges around Charlie, Barbie and Pebbles as they step by, briefly cutting Stanley off
He catches up just as the all-important rope is  closed
Hey, wait a minute
Charlie
But Charlie and the girls have already been whisked inside
Dorian now steps out of the club and begins to check Bobby's list
(
) 'm with them
Hey, Bobby
But Bobby is back into his deaf and dumb routine
Stanley unsnaps the rope himself and starts throgh
Bobby and  #2 grab Stanley and quickly subdue him
Hey
Leggo
awk
Dorian glares at Stanley
Lose him
The bouncers drag Stanley through the crowd and unceremoniously toss him out into the rain-slick street
Stanley slowly rises, smoothing out his disheveled clothing horn  and Stanley scrambles to one side as a limo swings into the club's alleyway, splattering him with a wave of muddy water
Stanley wipes the mud from his eyes just in time to see Tina Carlyle escorted from the back of the limo by a carrying an umbrella
She's shoe-horned into a heart-stopping red dress that's fighting a losing battle to restrain her decolletage
Their
Tina pauses as she recognizes him
() Oh
Stanley
Hi
Stanley realizes he looks ridiculous but gives a pathetic little wave hello anyway
(
) Are you okay
Stanley gestures "no problem" and tries to strike a casual pose against a street lamp, but slips and nearly falls
With a  of grinding gears and the - of a backfire, the car hop pulls Stanley's battered loaner right up behind him
Stanley flashes a last nervous smile at Tina, and digs for the car hop's tip money
nothing
He shrugs apologetically to the disgusted car hop and climbs in
The car ,  the finally  off in a cloud of exhaust fumes
: - forlorn looking spot on the outskirts of Edge City
We can hear Stanley's car  and  along before it actually pulls into sight on the dark rain-slick street
Stanley drives along in a miserable daze
Suddenly the engine starts  violently and the car dies
Steam  from the radiator as the car slowly rolls to a stop
Stanley  the ignition key again and again trying futilely to restart the engine
Finally, Stanley fights his way out of the rusted door with a of metal, turns and kicks the bumper
which promptly falls off with a resounding
Beat
The front axle collapses, the tires fall off and the driver's side door  to the ground
Stanley stands there staring at the steaming heap of useless metal
his mind a complete blank
He slowly turns, looking down at the black brackish water swirling along beneath the Tahoochie Bridge
wave of melancholy sweeps over him
Stanley plucks a button from his coat and watches as it drops down
down to the river below
Suddenly, something catches Stanley's eye
a , floating along in the darkness
He snaps back to reality
(
) Hey
Hey mister
Stanley rushes down the slippery embankment beneath the bridge
He spots the body dead ahead, floating along in the moonlight and as fast as he can
with Stanley as he scrambles down the slope; a black cat  as it races past him
He steps on and shatters a discarded mirror, and he ducks under an old ladder that leans against the bridge's foundation as he finally reaches the shore
Stanley splashes into the waist deep water just in time to catch the body as it floats by
- As Stanley grabs it, the "body" falls to pieces
revealing that it's nothing but a trash bag, an old tire and some floating bits of garbage all clinging to the "head": an old wooden Mask
Stanley shakes his head in disgust
some lifesaver
Stanley inspects the Mask more closely; strange ritualistic symbols carved into a puckish face with a leering grin and eerie empty eye holes
The faintest sound of a haunting "Mask  Theme" rises as Stanley turns the Mask around and inspects the inside
slowly bringing it closer and closer to his face
The surface of the Mask begins to But then
frog jumps out of it, right into Stanley's face
Stanley nearly loses his footing on the slippery river bottom
Suddenly a blinding  shines down from the bridge and an amplified voice calls out from a squad car
Hey, you
What are you doing down there
Stanley squints into the light, trying to think of a reasonable answer
was just looking for
(holds up Mask) My mask
: '  - The club is closing up
stack chairs on top of tables in the
as Tina gathers her sheet music from her
Thanks Reno, you're the greatest
'night, doll
Tina crosses to the bar area where Dorian lounges with
,   and
Dorian toasts her as she pulls up a bar stool
That was a great performance, baby
But not as great as the one you pulled off at the bank
Yeah, well don't get used to it
'm not going to start running cons for you again, Dorian
'm a singer now and that's it
Dorian rolls his eyes at Freeze, "Get her"
Oh, really
And you had such a red hot career before you latched on to me
Tina pours herself a drink
Who latched on to who
Get real, Tina
You'll do what say or 'll drop you back where found you, slingin' hash and dodgin' horny peterbuilt drivers
(downs a shot) Don't push me, Nicky
might just take a walk  should have taken a long time ago
() Easy, baby
Easy
(to his men) love it when she gets pissed
Dorian scoots over and puts an arm around Tina
She remains cool
(
) 'mere
You take a hike and who's gonna kiss you like Dorian Tyrel
Tina pours another shot
(
) 'mon
Who
Tina finally cracks a smile
Nobody
(pulls her close) That's right, baby
'mere
Tina slowly leans in for a kiss, her lips softly parted
but raises a finger to Dorian's lips, stopping him cold
She glances over at Freeze
Sorry
never get personal in front of the help
Tina abruptly stands and exits as Freeze glares at her
Dorian breaks into laughter
That broad kills me
She just might, man
The bitch is trouble
Dorian pours them all a drink
'mon Doctor, lighten up
(raises his glass) Here's to Edge City Bank
May it crack like an egg on Easter Sunday
Their glasses
: - The police car pulls up in front of Stanley's brownstone and he wearily climbs out
Okay, Mr
Ipkiss
Try to be a little more careful next time
Thanks Officer
The black and white pulls away and Stanley starts across the empty street
Hey, mister
Stanley turns
razor-cut '   hops down from a fire escape in a darkened alleyway
' You a cop or something
half dozen other '  appear out of the shadows all decked out in nipple chains, tattoos and other self-mutilation- - oddments
Uh
no
They just gave me a lift
' cop chauffeur
never seen that before
How about you boys
The other Death's Heads pipe up with "Not Me," "Nope," "Pretty special," etc
as they slowly surround Stanley
Alright, you guys
It's been a tough night
haven't got any money
haven't got a car
All have is this and you're welcome to it
Stanley tosses Death's Head #1 the Mask
He briefly inspects the funky looking antique, still slick with river slime, then tosses it back
He approaches Stanley
' Hey, man
You got us all wrong
We don't want any trouble
was just going to ask you for the time
That's all
You got the time
Uh
yeah
As Stanley pulls back his sleeve to check his watch, the Death's Head flicks out a butterfly knife
With a  of steel, he slices straight through Stanley's watch band and snatches the watch
' (holding up his prize) See,  only wanted the time
Heh, he, heh
All the punkers laugh like the half-wits they are as Death's Head #1 shoves Stanley into Death's Head #2
#2 pushes him back across to #3 and so on
Stanley is roughly bounced back and forth more and more violently within the circle of giggling street toughs
He finally breaks free and scrambles to his front door, still reeling with dizziness
He fumbles with the key and  the door behind him as the Death's Heads roar with laughter
: - Stanley's wet shoes  as he tiptoes past - "" - sign that reads "Quiet Please" hangs from the doorknob
Stanley continues past it to Apartment ""
Just as he removes his keys - Manager's door flies open and
appears
She's an old dragon in hair curlers who will probably live forever just to spite her relatives
Ipkiss
Do you have any idea what time it is
Reflexively, he looks at his (now empty) wrist
Actually, no
It's three o'clock in the morning
First, you wake up the entire building laughing it up with your pals
Then, you come in and start squeak - (sees puddles) My new carpet
Just look at that
This is coming out of your cleaning deposit Ipkiss
Stanley, battered, bruised and soaking wet is deep in urban shell-shock
() Are you done
Yes
think 'll be going to bed now
Mrs
Peenman  her door
'  - Small, full of books but very neat
few cherished animation cels from 1940s cartoons are framed on the wall
As Stanley locks the door behind him - he's greeted by , a happy little terrie sized mutt with a big heart
Hello, Milo
Milo gets so excited he starts  and
(
) Easy, buddy
missed you too
Stanley pats Milo on the rump, crosses his tiny kitchenette and heads straight into
Stanley's prized collection of "golden Age" Looney Tunes tapes are neatly displayed on a simple bookshelf
He tosses the Mask down on his bedside table, pops one of his cherished Tex Avery cartoons into the
, plops down on his bed and starts to strip off his shoes and socks
enters, holding a Frisbee in his mouth
(
) 'mon, Milo
'm beat
(to the dog ) Okay, okay
One throw
Stanley tosses the Frisbee into the air
The disk sails
Milo runs it down, leaps up, and makes a perfect catch
He trots back to the bedroom, and drops it in Stanley's lap
Easy
This is the best part
On the screen a cartoon dog  into frame and drops a frizzing stick of dynamite down a bad guy's pants
-
The dog maniacally
Suddenly there is a  on the wall that rattles Stanley's framed cartoon cels
(
) (calls out) Sorry Mrs
Peenman
With a sigh, he ejects the tape and a much quieter talk show on
Larry King and a guest
Stanley rises and crosses into the bathroom to wash up
King's guest, Dr
Arthur Neuman, is replying to a caller
That's correct
The truth is we all wear masks, metaphorically speaking
We repress the Id
our darkest desires and hide behind a more socially acceptable image of ourselves in order to cope with the frustrations of our day to day lives
Stanley's only half listening though the open bathroom door as he brushes his teeth
Think 'm repressed, Milo
Stanley tries a couple of fierce expressions in the bathroom mirror, his mouth foaming with toothpaste
Milo does that doggie-head-cocked-sideways "What the hell
" look
(
) (-) Nah
He spits and rinses
as King wraps it up, displaying the doctor's book
The book is "The Masks We Wear," by Dr
Arthur Neuman
Thank you Dr
Neuman
Stanley pops off the
with his remote
No thank you, Dr
Neuman
As he buttons up his
s, Stanley notices Milo warily sniffing at the strange Mask, which is still lying on the bedside table crosses its surface
Milo  and quickly hops off the bed
We now begin to hear the "Mask Theme"
echoes of the Viking drums
growing louder
Haunting whispery  seem to call to Stanley as he slowly crosses to the bedside
He picks up the Mask and turns it over in his hands running his fingers across the time work wood
The music builds
He turns back to the bathroom mirror and slowly raises the Mask to his face
Milo watches apprehensively from beneath the bed
For an instant - the    like a vacuum over Stanley's head
We hear the

) Whoa
Stanley studies the old mask, then his own face in the mirror
Everything's status quo
It must have been his imagination
(
) Naw
He puts the Mask on again - firmly this time
Milo dives under the bed as
: shoot out of the Mask and wrap around Stanley's head - locking the Mask in place
'  magically reweave themselves
growing in all directions
, turning lime green as it unites with the Mask
- His body begins to move uncontrollably
Spinning faster and faster like a gyroscope
The  get loonier and loonier as he becomes
Stanley's words are almost unintelligible as his voice jumps one, two, five octaves
Hellllllllppppmmmmmmmeeeeeeeee
reaches out of the twister and locks onto the bedpost
The whirlwind  to a halt, causing sparks and smoke to rise the singed carpet
The smoke clears revealing
He's dressed in a snazzy zoot suit - a distortion of the paisley material of Stanley's pajamas
The head is no longer Stanley's
It's large, bald and bright green
The huge bug-eyes glow with mischief
The nose is small, bony and beaked
The mouth and teeth are enormous and gleaming white as he breaks into a learning grin
The overall effect is devilishly loony, but not altogether unhuman
In fact, there's something downright charming about him
The Mask checks himself out in the mirror and likes what he sees
-s-s-nazzy
He  his bow tie with a crazy gleam in his eyes
(
) It's party time
- Trying to ber ,  quiet, the Mask tiptoes down the darkened corridor
The floor makes a barely audible  as the Mask steps with exaggerated care pst  "" with it's little "Quiet Please" sign
He raises a finger to his lip, making the "" sign
Suddenly - and unexplicably - a ringing   leaps out of Stanley/Mask's pocket and starts jittering down the hall
/ , jeepers--
Stanley/Mask tries to snag the clock, but it bounces away every time
Frustrated, he pulls a full sized  from his pocket and starts  the floor in an effort to stop the clock
Glancing blows shatter the clock face and most of the works, but those bells just keep ringing
The hammer, of course, slams craters the size of manhole covers into the floor and reverberates through the building like The door bursts open and Mrs
Peenman's angry face pops out covered in blue mud pack and framed in curlers
She gets one look at the Mask with his oversized carnival mallet raised over his head and bloody murder
The Mask  in response, his eyes bugging out on stalks and his mouth expanding to the size of a tuba in mock horror
Mrs
Peenman's door  shut and reopens a beat later as she appears cocking an enormous shotgun
Easy lady
was just killin' time
The Mask starts ricocheting off the walls  maniacal laughter as Mrs
Peenman lets loose with both barrels
-
The Mask bounces off walls as Mrs
Peenman continues to blast away, and finally leaps straight out the window
-
- Sending his body  our through the air towards the street seven stories below
/ - - Stanley/Mask lands face up in the middle of the street
He slow
painfully starts to rise as a   machine turns a corner and
The machine disappears down the street as we  on Stanley/Mask's flattened body
He raises one arm, grabs himself by the head and peels himself off the street
He shakes himself out with one sharp  and straightens his zoot suit
He's shocked to find a tiny  on his sleeve
/ Hey
You missed a spot
As if on cue, a  street cleaning machine  into him and This time he reinflates himself back into 3- by blowing into his thumb and hops up
/ And next time, no starch
Fully recovered, Stanley/Mask starts down the street, strutting like a prize fighter
Hey mister
Death's Head punker #1 hops down from his fire esscape behind the Mask
'  #1 (grins evilly) You got the time
The Mask turns to see he is surrounded by the Death's Head punkers
He seems to be delighted by their presence, but now that they see his face, they're totally freaked
(wiggles eyebrows) Why of course, Cubbie
got all the time in the world
He whips out his forearm (which grows large for emphasis cartoon- style)
It's covered with crazily spinning watches, cuckoo clocks and sun dials
London, Paris, Rome, standard, substandard and no standards at all
And for our English friends we have
Big Ben
'  #1 Big Ben
Stanley/Mask  a nearby street post, snapping it in half and sending a large decorative street clock  into the sidewalk
-
It completely obliterates Death's Head #1
The other gang members jump back in shock as the Mask races around the corner
'  #2 Get him
The Death's Heads pull out nasty homemade weapons and race around the corner into the alleyway
They come to a screeching halt as they discover Stanley/Mask dressed as a carnival barker
Multicolored lights and Calliope music come from out of nowhere
And for my next trick
Long pink and blue balloons appear in Stanley/Mask's hands and he instantly goes into a frenzy of twisting and knotting them into elaborate balloon sculpture
The Death's Heads are too stunned by the severe weirdness of all this to do anything but stand there and stare
(These guys were no rocket scientists in the first place
) (
) And viola
We have a giraffe
Sure enough, he's created a first rate balloon sculpture
He hands it to the biggest, dumbest Death's Head, who grins like a little kid upon receiving it
The Mask instantly goes into another flurry of motion, sculpting more balloons
(
) few more twists of the wrist and for you, Cubbie
He hands this next prize to Death's Head #3
(
) French poodle
And finally my favorite
He goes into another flurry of motion
- As the Mask pulls the ends of the knotted balloon, it straightens out and  into
(
) Tommy gun
real one
He immediately sprays the Death's Heads with hot lead
The greasy punkers dive for cover and scramble out of the alley under a hail of bullets
Stanley/Mask tosses the gun aside, intoxicated with his newfound powers
(
) Wait a minute
This is incredible
Why, with these powers  could be a superhero
could fight crime
Work for world peace
- (
) But first
: '   - It's late, but there's still a light on inside
- Burt and Irv, both woozy from drink, attempt to finish a card game
dozen empty beer bottles and two half eaten chili dogs adorn the table
Irv takes a big bite of his chili dog and pauses to regard it like a true connoisseur
Now these are serious chili dogs
know
Here's the proof
(lets out a long ) Aaah
Even tastier the second time around
Irv leans forward and sticks out his index finger
Hey Burt, pull on my finger
No way, man
No, really
Go ahead
Irv, don't
Irv raises a leg anyway and rips off a nasty fart
() That, my friend is the sweet smell of success
() No style
give it a five tops
Okay, how about
Soprano
Irv shifts his weight and hits an amazing high note
Burt is impressed in spite of himself
Fine muscle control
And now for my grand finale, The audience is listening
Irv lets one loose in perfect sensurround
Suddenly the front door  inward
Stanley/Mask stands there  like a gunfighter from a Clint Eastwood movie
Irv squints into the light, unable to make out the mysterious figure
Hey, 40 watt
we're closed
Nobody's here
Ah
but you're here
Irv rises
What  mean is
He lets loose a sneaker to help make his point
Nobody's here that wants to help you
Stanley/Mask now steps into the light
But 'm here to help you
Burt and Irv's eyes go wide as they get a better look at their nemesis
Fear loosens Irv's sphincter and a last feeble bit of gas escapes with a Stanley/Mask whirls about with a flourish and pulls two gleaming mufflers from the wall
Sounds like you have a little exhaust problem there
There's a mad gleam in his eyes as he spins the mufflers like two huge pistols and  them to a halt
(
) We better do a few touch ups before you have some serious trouble
The Mask  out of frame like a human tornado
Camera   past Burt and Irv's shocked expressions into an of the garage's bare light bulb as it  on its wire
We can't see the mayhem, but we can hear wacky/bizarre sound
as the Mask whirls about the garage
No
Wait
Eeeeeyaah
: As that light bulb becomes the morning  peaking over Edge City's skyline
through Stanley's bedroom window
'  -  - Stanley slowly awakens
He grabs his head and moans, looking and feeling completely hung over
Then suddenly he remembers - and out of bed with a start
He looks in the mirror, touching his face
It's the same old Stanley
He looks at his paisley 's
Same old 's
He picks up the mask
Same old mask
dream
It was only a dream
Stanley starts to relax
There's a  at the door
- Stanley's greeted by
(50)
This hound-dog of a cop can't help but stare at Stanley's garish pajamas
Nice 's pal
Can  help you
You're Ipkiss
Stanley Ipkiss
That's right
Some kind of prowler broke in and attacked Mrs
Peenman
(swallows hard) Really
didn't hear a thing
Then you must be a pretty sound sleeper, Ipkiss 'cause she unloaded a couple rounds of 20 ott buckshot five feet from your door
Kellaway swings Stanley's door open wider to give him a better view of the damage
Mrs
Peenman stands there in the hall tearfully speaking to anither
Stanley is flabbergasted to see: - The shotgun blasts in the walls
- The pot holes left from the mallet
- The shattered remains of the wacky alarm clock
All flashbacks from last night
() That's
impossible
Excuse me
Stanley quickly pulls himself together
That's
a, possible
See, have this inner ear problem
(wiggles a finger in his ear vigorously) Sometimes  can't hear a thing
() Is that a fact
What
Kellaway leans closer to speak more loudly, but catches himself and shoots Stanley a dirty look
Forget it
He hands Stanley his card
(
) Here
You remember anything unusual about last night, anything at all, call me
Sure
thanks
Stanley  the door and throws his body against it, his heart pounding in his chest
Milo gives him that curious dog-head-cocked-sideways look
(
) Milo, it was real
How could it all be
real
Stanley suddenly notices the clock on the wall
(
) Oh my god
'm late
He races into the bedroom
Kellaway is taking notes as patiently as he can from Mrs
Peenman
Look, Mrs
Peenman, you gotta admit your description is pretty tough to swallow
Then you can choke on it for all care
saw what  saw
Right
(refers to notes) green head the size of a pumpkin, purple zoot suit and spats
That's a pretty serious fashion risk for any self-respecting second story man
An  now hurries up the steps all out of breath
Lt
, we just got an emergency call from a mechanic on 67th Street
What
Some kind of assault and battery
Sound pretty bad
() Alright
Dont' worry Mrs
Peenman, we'll find this guy for you
Officer Deluca here has a few forms you'll have to fill out
: ' Stanley rushes around the apartment, but he can't find his keys anywhere
He finishes tying his tie as he searches
Milo
Keys
Keys
- Milo's ears prick
He leaps up and immediately starts sniffing around
He pulls a cushion off the sofa and emerges with the keys just as Stanley comes out, briefcaase in hand
Good boy
He pets his dog, takes his keys and starts out the door
but he pauses to take a last look at the mask
It's eerie black eye holes and devilish grin seem to mock him
On sudden impulse, he grabs it, hurls it out the balcony's sliding glass door and exits
- - Sailing end over end through the air
As the mask flies out into the sir, a sudden wind kicks up
The mask arcs back toward the building like a boomerang and lands balanced precariously on a narrow ledge
Its mocking grin seems to glow with triumph
: '   - The place looks like it's been hit by cartoon graffiti guerrillas: Everything's printed in polka-dots, checks, tartan, etc
The "Ripley Auto Finishing" sign hangs askew over the doorway
Letters have been sprayed out to read "Rip Off
" Several  and curious  stand nearby as Kellaway and his men take it all in
appear wheeling Burt and Irv out of the building on two gurneys
They're both in severe discomfort and look more like cars than men: Bodies spray painted metallic colors, hood ornaments glued to their foreheads, wire rims under each limb, and gleaming four foot long mufflers sticking out of their rear ends
They wince in pain at each tiny bump of the gurney
Ah
Eeeh
Ooh
Paramedic #3 speaks into his emergency radio-phone as Burt and Irv are loaded into the van
#3 want a proctologist standing by
Yeah, you heard me
The best one you can find
An  steps out of the building and approaches Kellaway
We were able to get a description Lt
, but it's pretty weird
() Let me guess
Big green head
Zoot suit
How did you
Whoever this guy is, he's a world class twisto
, an attractive young woman in her mid twenties, appears besides the other reporters and approaches Kellaway, notepad in hand
Excuse me, Lt
, 'm with the Evening Star
Can you tell me what happened here
Sorry
Too early to comment
It looks like some kind of mob scare tactic
said no comment
Now break it up
This is a crime scene
As the officers disperse the reporters and other onlookers, Peggy slips away from the group
Even though it's closed off with yellow police tape, Peggy slips inside the garage
'  - The empty garage has been turned into a topsy-turvy nightmare
The same cartoon paint job covers the walls
Peggy looks around, through some papers scattered all over the floor
Nothing
Then she spies the
Peggy opens it and pulls out a of pink "comment" slips
She looks at them
Almost all of them are from one customer -
- Stanley, still looking rumpled and unshaven, hurriedly takes off his coat and powers up his computer
Charlie steps over to his desk carrying a newspaper
What happened to you last night
The girls and  were looking all over for you
uh, didn't feel so good decided to go home early
As a matter of fact, you don't look so good
You got to take better care of yourself, man
How was the club
Are you kidding
It was hotter than a pistol
Did you see the paper
No
Your girlfriend got a great review
Chralie flips open the Entertainment section of the Evening Star
There's a great close-up of Tina singing her heart out with the "Bombshell Explodes at Monnkey's Paw
" , the smarmy office manager who is younger than Stanley, now appears
Ipkiss
You're forty minutes late
Every time you do that you're robbing this bank of its time and money
Sorry, Mr
Dicky
It won't happen again
(snatches newspaper) If you weren't so busy ogling girlie pictures you'd get some work done around here
Ah
She's a prospective client of Stanley's, sir
(sudden attitude change) She is
Well
Next time she comes in see that you send her directly to my office
Yes sir, Mr
Dickey
Dickey tosses the paper back on Stanley's desk and marches off through the bank
Look at that little creep
If it wasn't for his daddy he'd be out somewhere shakin' down school kids for lunch money
Stanley toys with the Kleenex that bears Tina's lipstick "kiss"
You think she ever will come back, Charlie
Who knows
Forget about her, Stanley
dame like that is always looking for the
The bigger better deal
Ask her what her sign is and she'll say dollar
You don't know that
She's an artist
Maybe she's sensitive
Yeah
She can sense a guy's credit line at two hundred yards
Stanley, you need a girl you can depend on
Someone a little more down to earth
someone like
as Peggy Brandt stops by a teller's window, looking sharp and pretty in a blazer and jeans
Excuse me, can you tell me where can find Stanley Ipkiss
Like her
Someone like her
(straightens tie) As a matter of fact  could use someone like her myself
(rises as Peggy approaches) Hel-lo there
May  be of some assistance
Stanley Ipkiss
Charlie begrudgingly points to Stanley
(
) Hi
'm Peggy Brandt
'm with the Evening Star
Oh, hi
already have a subscription, thanks
Oh no, actually  just wanted to ask you a few questions
Really
About what
Ripley Auto Finishing
You're a customer of theirs aren't you
uh
No
think you must have made a mistake
Peggy produces one of the complaint slips
Isn't this a form of theirs you filled out
(nervous chuckle) Oh, that Ripley Auto
guess have stopped in there once or twice, Miss
what did you say your name was
Peggy Brandt
Wait a minute
Peggy Brandt of "Ask Peggy"
That's right
(brightens up) You printed my letter last year, remember
"Nice Guys Finish Last
" You're Mr
Nice Guy
Stanley do you realize how much mail we got about that letter
There's hundreds of women out there who are looking for a man just like you
Are you serious
Of course
you know how hard it is to find a decent man in this town
Most of them think monogamy is some kind of wood
Why are you covering this story
They cut my salary
just can't make it by on "Dear Peggy" anymore
The truth is,  want to be a real reporter and if can break this story  know they'll let me
(sits closer) Look Stanley,  know Ripley Auto is a crooked operation
They may even have had ties to the Mob
'm not out to get you
just want the truth
wish  knew the truth, Peggy
really do
: '   - well dressed  checks from beneath his sunglasses to see nobody's watching and  on the door
It opens and he quickly inside
' Sweet Eddy escorts him inside
The man removes his glasses and glances about nervously
Dorian sits at his desk
Dr
Freeze and Chun Woo are going over an array of high tech burglary equipment laid out on the air hockey table
Good afternoon, Councilman Snell
Nice of you to drop by
Cut the crap
Dorian
What's so important that  had to come here in person
Dorian gazes out the window to the Valhalla Casino
got a little job for you, Tom
want you to pull the Swede's gambling license
That's impossible
He was approved six months ago
Pull a few strings
Find something in the fine print don't care how you do it, but do it
You owe me
() owe you nothing, you little piece of shit
got your liquor license when nobody else would touch
Dorian suddenly , overturning his desk and sending Snell tumbling backwards
In less than a heartbeat, he grabs Snell by his shirt ffront,  him up against the wall,  a whiskey bottle and presses the jagged edge to his throat
Snell hangs there whimpering
Dorian has a crazed look in his eyes as he gazes at the Councilman's lapel
() That's pretty
What is that, a carnation
Snell nods
Dorian takes a deep whiff
(
) Nice
Hey, Eddy
call my florist
Two dozen pink carnations to Mrs
Snell with my regrets over her husband's untimely accident
Tears begin to well up in Snell's eyes
() No
please
can do it can make it happen
Dorian eases back
brushes off Snell's coat
That's smart
You're a very smart man
Now pull yourself together
Look at you
Dorian picks up an Uzi from Dr
Freeze's equipment
(
) Shut the Swede down, Snell
We'll buy him out cheap with a little collateral the bank is about to provide us
(looks at his men) And Gentlemen
we are going to be in the casino business
: '  - Distant sirens can be heard over the occasional sound of a gunshot
It's a reasonably peaceful night in Edge City
'  - off of Tina's picture, which is now taped to Stanley's dresser mirror
to Stanley himself as he tosses and turns in a fitful sleep
Milo lies curled up at the foot of the bed
He looks concerned over the little noises Stanley is making in his sleep
of Stanley as we : '  - a 1940s noir-style montage: Huge soft-lit faces loom over him, one dissolving into the next
Tina, luminous and breathtaking speaks under heavily lidded eyes
Or it could be two lovers
That would be the woman on top, of course
Charlie looms up out of the darkness
Forget her, Stanley
Ask her what her sign is and she'll say dollar
Mr
Dickey appears, glaring down angrily at Stanley
Every time you're late Ipkiss, you're robbing this bank
The shrink from the "larry King Show" floats by on a cloud of pipe smoke
We must repress our Id
our deepest darkest desires
Finally Tina again standing beside the limo as she was that night in the Monkey's Paw alley: Hey, are you okay
Stanley stands at the curb, but this time he's not splattered with mud
He's decked out in first class Armani and looks suave as hell
He looks straight into her eyes
am now
'mere, baby
() Oh, Stanley
She runs to his arms and they embrace in a passionate kiss
But Tina suddenly pulls back and begins rapidly licking Stanley's ear
which is kinda weird
- Tina
Stanley suddenly realizes Milo is licking his ear
and he's just woken up
(
) Milo, down
He pushes Milo away, tosses back the covers and rises out of bed
It's still the dead of night and Stanley is all in a huff from his dream
He spots Tina's clipping on his dresser mirror and rips it off, upset with himself
(
) Stupid, stupid
She'd never
Stanley wheels about and to his complete surprise sees
Through his bedroom window, propped up on the fourth story ledge
Its leering grin seems to beckon Stanley as we begin to hear the beat of the Mask
theme
stands transfixed, staring at the moonlit face
He can almost hear echos of faint whispered  calling his name
deadly siren song above the pounding drums
() No
He backs away from the window
- shimmers as the  grow louder
takes a last look at the crumpled picture of Tina in his hand and finally loses control
He bolts from the room
- Stanley is a driven man as he makes his way out onto the narrow ledge
Milo tugs at his pajama leg, but Stanley kicks him away and climbs out over the ledge
Stanley wavers precariously on the crumbling masonry, then catches his balance
His face is bathed in sweat as he gazes at the leering face
music  in his head
(faint echos) Stanley
Stanley
Stanley tries to steady himself, his eyes transfixed on his prize
Just
one
last
time
He lurches back out and makes his way one shaky step at a time towards the mask
watches from the apratment window, whimpering softly
- Narrow masonry begins to crumble
carefully reaches down, his fingers just brushing the mask as he teeters out over nothingness
Night traffic whizzes by down below
cracks away
as he begins to fall, jamming the mask to his face
The window suddenly  inwards as the whirling Stanley/Mask tornado bursts into the room
Milo dives for cover
The tornado scorches the rug as it wheels around the room, then to a halt, revealing the Mask in his full glory
He strikes a grand entrance pose with his arms held high
() gotta be me
just gotta be me
He  into the bathroom The Mask sticks the picture of Tina on the bathroom mirror and blows her a kiss
(a'la Big Bopper) Oooooh Bay-bee
knoooooows what you likah
He sprouts a couple of extra arms as he madly brushes his teeth, sprays on cologne and bats himself with a powder puff all at once
He  into the bedroom
The Mask stands before a full length mirror and checks himself out
With a magical "hands are quicker than the eye" move, he wardrobe instantly
now posing in an effete fashion victim Don Johnson-style suit
The
look
Naw
In a  he's changed again: now in  Rapper-style over- sized jeans and backwards baseball cap
(
) 501's
(shakes his head) For buttonheads only
He changes again in a flash
This time he's naked except for his Calvin Klein underwear (his stomach muscles appear super-cut washboard-style)
(
) Marky Mark, eat your heart out
He changes one last time and appears in a wild banana yellow zoot suit complete with a snap brim fedora
That's the ticket
(
) -s-s-mokin
Now let's see
The Mask quickly searches his pockets
He pulls his pants pockets inside out and a moth flutters out
(
) What
Seems to be a minor cash flow problem here
don't like to keep a lady waiting, but
(points a finger in the air) First things first
The Mask  out of frame
: - The street is quiet and empty, except for a Dipsy Doodle Diaper delivery van parked across from the bank
Crowded with Dorian's men, it's been set up as a makeshift control room for the robbery
Dr
Freeze  a clip in his 9mm and looks down through the van's false bottom to Sweet Eddy, who is standing in an open manhole working on a bundle of underground wiring
What's the
Another five minutes
Freeze synchronizes his watch
Counting down
now
Freeze presses a button on the side of a miniaturized headset he's wearing (
) (into headset) Lookin' good here, my man
- ' He sits at his desk, speaking into a high tech walkie talkie
In the
Dorian's wall-mounted video monitors display live shots of the club in full swing
Nice work, Freeze
You boy are on your own now
've got to make sure 'm seen downstairs
(
) Do it, man
The Doctah is about to operate
Freeze turns to his men
Gentlemen
(cocks his gun) Let's do our duty and grab the booty
The burglars gather their gear when suddenly the bank alarm starts
Freeze looks down the hole to Sweet Eddy
(
) What the hell you doin', fool
Nothing
didn't do nothing
(to the others) 'mon
You keep that motor runnin'
Freeze and company race across the street with guns drawn
Freeze and Chun Woo flatten themselves on either side of the door as Burglar #4 drops to one knee and quickly picks the lock
Suddenly the glass doors  wide open as a bursts out of the bank, shoots right past them and zig-zags up street
Twenty dollar bills slowly drift down onto the stunned robbers in its wake
In an instant the whirlwind does a -turn, zig-zag races back up to them and  to a halt
The Mask, still in his banana yellow zoot suit and carrying huge sacks of money like Santa Claus, plucks those stray twenties from the air, one, two, three
Sorry, fellas
Waste not want not
And , he's off again
laughter like a maniac
Freeze pulls his gun
Get that sucker
Two cop cars now  around the corner, their sirens blaring and  up the street at the bank robbers
Oh, shit
The robbers race back to the van, dive inside and
The police open fire as they roar after them in hot pursuit
Bullets tear into the van, blowing out the rear windows
: ' The die-hard crowd of  is piled up outside as usual clamoring to get in
But a buzz of excitement begins to travel through the crowd as one by one they notice
But not just any limousine
As it slowly pulls up by the front of the club we realized it's long
longer
the longest limousine we'vve ever seen
Finally the passenger door rolls into sight and the limo comes to a halt
The door bursts open and out leaps the Mask
Ah
my public
The crowd parts like the Red Sea as the Mask sashays to the front door
Bobby the Bouncer gets one look at the Mask and actually loses his cool
Er, uh
Are you on the list
No, but  believe my friends are
(fans a wad of cash) Jackson, Lincoln and Roosevelt
He tosses a handful of loot in the air and struts into the club as the crowd scrambles for the cash
' This is the first time we've gotten a good look at the place and it's a real eyeful
its wild tropical complete with live exotic birds in huge indoor Banyon trees
in leopard skin leotards make their way across the crowded dance floor with trays full of oversized tropical drinks
as the hostess seats Dorian at his favorite ringside table and removes the "reserved" sign
The lights dim an all eyes go to the bandstand
spotlight hits the stage and tropical ferns part like a gigantic fan revealing
in a glittering gown that's made of little more than sequins and mesh
If there were such a thing as fashion police this dress would be arrested for disturbing the peace
She talks/sings the intro of her number a capella
There's all kinds of men In this old world That seek the affections Of a beautiful girl
But of the men from Which to choose There's only one type That
ap
aprooove
And now the band slides in, in classic torch song style as Tina sings "Checks Appeal"
She works the room throughout the song, driving the men crazy as she lingers by each table
(
) You can keep your cowboys on the farm The gigolos don't make me warm It's mink my fingers crave to feel need a man with checks appeal
The Mask is seated at a table on the other side of the club and immediately reacts when he lays eyes on Tina
His eyes   on stalks, an  horn sounds and his heart starts  wildly, shooting two feet out of his chest with beat
Customers at nearby tables are astonished
(
) Pretty boys are such a bore There's manly macho types galore But you'll always know The diamond's real If you've got a man with checks appeal
The Mask snatches a bottle off a passing ' tray and sucks it down in one gulp
His head  like an electric paint shaker
He  both hands on his head to hold it still
' Sweet Eddy looks nervous as hell as he appears beside Dorian
What the hell are you doing here
We got trouble
You better come upstairs
Dorian immediately rises and hurries through the corwd towards his office
as he continues to ogle Tina
His face now elongates into a wolf's
He , , pounds his fist on the table and stomps his foot on the floor
Don't want to see too fanatic But dollar signs are so romantic want a love That's deep and real Just with a man that's got
(big finish) Checks ap-peaaal
The audience goes crazy
Tina takes a bow
Suddenly the Mask  around the perimiter of the club, leaps up on top of the piano and  his fingers
spotlight hits him
Let's rock this joint
He grabs the stuffy, tuxedoed ' stool and spins it hard
When the pianist stops twirling, he been transformed into a hip, - who immediately starts pounding out a mean - The Mask produces a conductor's baton from thin air, spins around and magically whips the rest of the band into a frenzy, out a driving rock 'n roll tune
Satisfied with the music, the Mask leaps down onto the dance floor, grabs the astonished Tina and drags her off her feet into a wild special watches amazed as
put Fred and Ginger to shame
Jiving away at warp speed, the Mask movves like a combination of Gumby and Barishnikov
He beneath his legs,  her back into midair,  her like a baton and hits the floor in the splits without missing a beat
-s-s-smokin
: ' Dorian and Sweet Eddy enter to find Dr
Freeze, sitting there, gasping in pain with a bar towel pressed against a bloody wound in his side
What the hell happened to you
'll be okay
Nobody puts the chill on Freeze
Where's the money
Deal went south, Bro'
Someone else hit the place before we did
Who
Don't know
Dude looked like a freakin' goblin or something
Next thing we know there's cops all over us, man
Where's Chun Woo
Takin' a dirt nap
It was bad, man
Real bad
(swallows hard) need a smoke
Yeah
sure
Dorian taps out a cigarette, places it between Dr
Freeze's lips and lights it
but the flame doesn't draw
Beat
The cigarette tumbles from Freeze's mouth
Dorian glances back up and sees that Dr
Freeze's eyes are glazed over in death
Dorian leaps to his feat and hurls his chair across the room in anger
It  the mirror over his bar
(
) Son of a bitch
Who did this Eddy
Who
Eddy is staring at Dorian's
monitor
On it the Mask can still be seen in the midst of his wild dance with Tina
That's him
That's the guy
Dorian grabs a
45 from his desk, checks the barrel and jams it in his coat
Come on
: The Mask spins Tina all around him like a top and then  her straight up into the air
Amazingly, she continues somersaulting at the apex of her ascent, suspended in mid-air by her magical momentum
stands there nonchalantly filing his nails, whistling to himself
Tina continues to  in place high above him
casually checks his watch
Without looking up he holds out one hand for the catch
perfect timing
final somesault and she drops right back down into his arms
They go straight back into a rockin' hitterbug without missing a beat
Dorian and Eddy race down the steps, guns drawn
Dorian calls to Bobby by the hostess' stand
Clear the club
Now
The dance's grand finale
The Mask spins Tina around and around his body like a baton in one of those awful Hawaiian fire dances
As the band bangs out the final bars of the tune, the Mask Tina to a halt, bends her over backwards and nails her with a Valentino kiss that literally blows her shoes off;
She hangs onto the Mask's tie for support when  the tie is shot in half
Tina falls on her cute behind
- The shot-away piece of the Mask's tie flutters to the floor and back into a piece of Stanley's pajamas
stands at the edge of the dance floor, his smoking gun trained on the Mask
(gasps in mock horror) Gee willickers
Does this mean we won't make the Star Search finals
This means you won't make it out of this club alive if you don't tell me where my money is
Okay
The Mask immediately whips out an old fashioned pull handle calculator, snaps on a green visor and starts tabulating
- (
) (fast talking) You got a 27
5% in -Bills amortized over the fiscal yeah 16-3/4% in stocks and bonds/ (-, -) Carry the nine and divide by the Gross National Product
Now cut that out
(turns to Eddy) Ventilate this goon
Eddy pulls out his
38 and starts blasting
The Mask dodges the bullets by contorting his cartoon-flexible body
The Mask  once and freezes in a pirouette, now dressed in a tutu
The Mask  again and stops dressed as a matador, the bullet whizzes under his cape
hockey goalie bats the bullet away
Russian Dancer leaps over the shot
Cowboy
takes the hit
The Mask staggers back
the forwards in a classic Western death scene
He throws an arm around Sweet Eddy for support
Ak
you got me Pahdnuh
(cough
cough) Eddy seems touched by the Mask's dying words as he holds him in his arms
(
) Hold me close, Red
It's a gettin' dark
() Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller out
(cough
cough) Tell Tint Tim  won't be makin' it home for Christmas
() Tell Scarlet  do give a damn
And the Mask gives up the ghost, his pink tongue flops out the side of his mouth
Eddy bursts into tears
Suddenly a huge cartoon  pops up silhouetted in the foreground, applauding wildly
An off-camera  shoots into frame handing the Mask an Oscar
The Mask leaps to his feet and starts taking bows
(
) Thank you
You love me
You really love me
Dorian pulls out his own
45 and opens fire
The Mask starts  laughter and ricochets off the dance floor
Dorian gives chase, but suddenly the nightclub doors are and Kellaway and a squad of police burst into the room with guns drawn
Drop it, Tyrel
Dorian lets his
45  to the ground
Kellaway retrieves it
Hello, Kellaway
You got a warrant or did you just drop by for a night cap
got probable cause
couple of your boys were spotted knocking over Edge City Bank
One of his men begins to roughly frisk Dorian Easy, junior
You're givin' me a woodey
One of them was wearin' some kind of big green mask
For once you're on the right track, but that's not one of my men
Maybe you ought to try a little actual police work instead of this harassment bullshit
This isn't harassment
You want to see some harassment
(to his men) Search the place, boys
His men begin to tear the club apart
Ever wonder why you didn't make Captain, asshole
got friends so high up they'd give you a nose bleed
Kellaway hauls off and  him in the face with a solid right cross
Well what d'ya know
guess they gave you one too
Dorian shakes it off and glares at him
() You're a dead man
One of the officers now appears on the stairway
Lt
, we got a stiff upstairs
One of the guys from the heist
(cuffs him) Better call that high-priced lawyer of yours, Tyrel
You're comin' downtown
'll be back on the streets before sunrise and you know it
Then just think of this as the city's way of showing you a little hospitality
(pats him on the cheek) 'll stop by to tuck you in myself
As the police drag Dorian outside, Kellaway notices someting on the dance floor
Kellaway picks up the slice of pajama fabric that was once the Mask's tie and inspects it closely
It's the same fabric Kellaway saw Stalney wearing that morning
Kellaway exits and walks right past the poster of Tina
Flattened into the poster, with his arm around her, is a cartoon of the Mask
The eyes follow Kellaway as he speaks to   guarding the door
You're on your own, boys
Don't worry, Lt
If he's in there, well get him
Kellaway slips the pajamas fabric in his pocket
And if he's not,  got a feeling  know where to find him
As Kellaway heads for his car, the Mask slips out of the poster (still flat as a pancake), slides along the wall behind unsuspecting policemen and around the corner to safety
: '  - Milo , Frisbee in mouth
Stanley wakes up with a massive headache and dark rings under his eyes
The Mask, which lies on the pillow next to him is taking a greater and greater toll
There's a on the door
(
) Police
Open up
Stanley runs to the closet to hide the Mask
The instant he opens the door, an avalanche of  pours out, suffocating him
Oh my god
(
) Ipkiss
know you're in there
Stanley grabs the Frisbee and starts shoveling the money back into the closet
Now the doorbell starts
All right, 'm coming
Stanley tosses the Mask and the Frisbee into the closet and it shut
He scoops up a few stray dollars and throws them under the bed
He hurries to the door and opens it, an easy smile on his face
Lieutenant, what a surprise
What can  do for you
You can answer a few questions
've got to get ready for work
Trust me
Your bank's opening late today
Kellaway steps into the apartment, without waiting for an invitation
Stanley glances nervously back at the closet
Milo is scratching at the door
(
) Where were you last night
Here
mostly
Is something wrong
Maybe, yes
Maybe, no
Maybe it's all just a crazy coincidence that this so called "Mask" character always seems to be wherever you are
Mask -- who
Don't insult my intelligence, Ipkiss
First, he's spotted in your building, then the bank where you work and now  find this at the Monkey's Paw
He displays the
It matches the piece missing in Stanley's pajamas
Stanley wilts
Milo  and leaps up, trying to open the closet door
Milo
No
(moves the dog away) Okay, so  went out on the town last night
guy's got to have a little fun
In your jammies
Milo is back at the closet door
He's just about got it open as Stanley turns the detective to the door
Naw,  just took 'em with me in case  didn't make it home don't know about you, Lieutenant
But 've got a pretty good track record with the ladies
Kellaway pulls away from Stanley and begins suspiciously the air around him
Wait a second
you smell that
What
() Bullshit
hate the smell of bullshit
Don't even think about leaving town, Ipkiss
'll be in touch
Kellaway  the front door, just as the closet door falls open -- spilling all the cash
Milo happily snatches his Frisbee
Stanley sinks back down on his bed
What are we gonna do, Milo
What are we gonna do
- replay of the bank robbery, from the bank's grainy videocams blurred image of the Mask is visible as he zig-zags around the bank at high speed
Kellaway sips a cup of brackish coffee as Oliveras - the best image of the Mask
There's a wild-eyed look of glee on his face as he stuffs sacks full of money
don't know, boss
That's one helluva rubber mask
Where's the lab report
Oliveras hands it over
We got fingerprints on some of the currency, but nothing matches Tyrel's men
Looks like this guy beat 'em to the punch
Get the bank's employee files and run down the prints on a guy named Ipkiss
You figure it was an inside job
Yeah, and all  need is a couple of prints to lock this wack job up 'till doomsday
'  - Dorian's assembled a war council
At the table are Sweet Eddy and assorted Button Men from the city's underworld
An open attache case filled with stacks of money sits before Dorian
fifty thousand dollar reward to the man who finds this "Mask" character before the cops do
Get the word out to every street hustler and low life in this town
(pounds his fist) want him here
In my office
Alive
By tomorrow
Now get going
Everybody scrambles out of their seats
Tina sits in the corner of the room, painting her nails
She glances up at Dorian
What are you looking at
You
You're losing it Dorian
'm losing nothing
Except maybe some extra baggage  don't need around here
What's that supposed to mean
You weren't putting up much of a fight when that green goon kissed you last night
'mon, did it look to you like had a choice
Maybe you did and maybe you didn't, but  know this, one day real soon 'm gonna run this town and when  do there's gonna be payback for anyone who crossed me
(glares at her) mean anyone
: - The place is in general disarray but still functioning, jammed with worried depositors
Stanley makes his way to his desk, his face pale and unshaven
Dark circles ring his eyes
Ipkiss
We have a crisis on our hands here and you stroll in over an hour late
If  have to put up with your slovenly
Stanley develops an odd facial , then
() Back off Monkey-Boy, before  tell your daddy how you're running this branch like it's your own personal piggy bank
If the
saw some of those files we could arrange a little vacation for you at Club Fed
Dickey is absolutely shocked into silence by this outburst, then
That will be all, Ipkiss
Dickey turns on his heels and exits
Charlie Schumacher now appears glowing with new respect for Stanley
Woah
What side of who's bed did you wake up on
'm not sure
() haven't exactly been myself lately
For a split second, Stanley's entire face  into an alarming Mask-like expression
() Yeah, well you look like you could use a little  and  there buddy
and as a matter of fact 've got just the ticket
Or should  say tickets
'm afraid to ask
Charlie flashes two tickets
Saturday night
Grand opening of the Valhalla Casino
Serious skirt alert
Everybody who's anybody will be there
What do you say
don't know Charlie,
Stanley suddenly spots Tina making her way across the room to his desk
(
) Excuse me a second
' Tina
What are you doing here
heard about the robbery guess  just wanted to make sure you were okay
Oh, don't worry about me
() 'm fine
Are you sure
You look a little
'm just having a little trouble sleeping is all
() guess you won't want to open that account after all this
'm not so sure 'll have much to open an account with anymore
What about the nightclub thought you were doing great
don't know how much longer can stay there Stanley
Things are getting a little intense
Well, there must be plenty of other places you could sing
Maybe even get a record deal
wish it was that easy
There's thousands of girls out there just like me who
Not just like you
You've got a voice like
like an angel
(lights a cigarette) An angel huh
That's the first time 've heard that one
No,  mean it
You really do
can vamp my way through a tune
But that's not really singing
What is it with you, Tina
Why don't you believe in yourself
() guess 've just heard a lot of promises from a lot of guys
In the end they all wanted the same thing and it wasn't a song
So maybe you've been singing for the wrong guys
'm not so sure there's any other kind
Not for me, anyway
() Well, 'm glad nobody got hurt
Yeah
What about this guy, the Mask
Do the cops have a line on him
'm not sure
Why are you interested
Promise you won't say anything
Sure
He came to the club last night and he was just so
well, different
haven't been able to get him off my mind
Really
They say he's pretty weird looking
Yeah
He's ugly
but he's kinda cool
y'know, like Mick Jagger
You really think so
Yeah
If you hear anything about him, would you call me at the club
Stanley nods - unsure of what to say
Tina opens the door, but before she exits
Actually
sort of know the guy
What
The Mask
We're - old college buddies him and
Are you serious
Oh yeah
To tell you the truth, 'm sorta covering for him on this bank thing
He's not such a bad guy, really
He just gets a little carried away
'll say
Do you think you could give him a message
suppose so
Tell him  want to see him again When
mean, 'd need to tell him exactly
How about seven o'clock tonight at Peninsula Park
'll be
mean, 'll make sure he's there
: -  - Peggy parks her car in her space, locks it up and beeps on the car horn
When she turns, she notices a shadowy  watching her from a bark corner of the garage
She hurries down the row of parked cars, clutching her purse to her side
The figure follows at a slow but relentless pace
Peggy fumbles for her keys, finally finds the correct one and enters the building
Peggy is relieved as she reaches her apartment door and slips the key in the lock
but the lock is jammed
She tries and tries again
nothing
Suddenly, a hand enters frame and  an eviction notice on her door
Sorry, doll
had the locks changed this afternoon
You what
You can't do that
You've known we're going condo for six months, Peggy
can't stall the owner a minute longer
Either you pony up the downpayment or you're out
Just a couple more days, Phil
The paper's ready to give me a full time job
've heard that one before
'mon, at least let me get a few of my things
Phil considers this a beat, then unlocks the door for her
Don't make me regret this
We get a certified check by noon tomorrow or a Sheriff will escort you out of here
Thanks Phil
You're a sweetheart
Phil exits
Peggy picks up her things when she hears an off- camera "Pssst
" She turns
stands in the shadows by the fire escape
He's got a voice that sounds like he's been gargling glass
heard you were lookin' for a story
Who
Who are you
Just a guy with a little information lookin' to make a buck
But maybe  heard wrong
You don't look like much of a reporter to me
Peggy gulps back her fear, determined to live up to her job
You give me something worth printing and 'll get you your money
What's this about
The guy they call the Mask and why Dorian Tyrel's willing to pay fifty large to get him
How do  find this Tyrel
Careful, sweet meat
You break this story and he just might find you
: as he enters
'  - Dorian and Sweet Eddy casually step through the front door of the restaurant's ersatz chalet facade
Sweet Eddy takes a position by the door as Dorian greets Artie the Swede at a large oak table in the festeively decorated The Swede is flanked by his gunsels as he's served by a big blonde waitress in a classic peasant girl costume
Dorian
thanks for coming by, kid
My pleasure, Swede
It's been too long
was worried you were still pissed about that little thing with Harry the Hat
That
It was nothing
He was a pain in my ass anyway
Here, sit down, sit down
Congratulations on the new casino
Thanks, but it might be a little early to celebrate
As a matter of fact that's why  asked you to stop by
Is that right
Here
have a little something to eat
That's Svenska meatballs, kid
The real thing
Thanks
Dorian starts to eat
So,  tell you Dorian, it's a terrible shame
put all my hard work into this beautiful casino and what do you think
All the sudden  got all kinda problems with the city
Big problems
The whole deal could fold
Maybe  can help you out
'm expecting to come into a little investment capital shortly
If worse comes to worse and you really need to bail out
What a sweet guy
Isn't this guy a sweetheart
Thanks for the offer Dorian, but  think maybe can solve this myself
Is that right
That's right
You know that Councilman you got in your pocket
Dorian freezes with a forkful of meatballs halfway to his mouth
He notices a   squashed into the gravy
(
) Well now you've got 'im in your mouth
How you like that
The Swede and his men have a good laugh as Dorian spits out his meatball
The Swede pulls a gun and jams it under Dorian's chin
Sweet Eddy goes for his gun, but one of the Swede's men pops up, jamming a barrel to his temple
(
) (to Dorian) Now listen close scumbag
You want to bw in business with me
Okay, we're partners now
'm takin' fifty per cent off the Monkey's Paw
You screw with me again and 'll send you straight down to Hell with your scumbag councilman
You can apologize for eatin' him for lunch
Sure, Swede
Take it easy
Good
Now get out of my sight
Dorian rises
Oh Dorian, here's a couple tickets to my grand opening
Stop by
And try to dress up nice
It's good for business
: : "The Mask Robs Bank - Police Scour The City
" It's accompanied by a grainy blow-up of the Mask from the bank video
jams a quarter in the slot, opens the machine and pulls out the entire stack of papers
to reveal Stanley, still looking pale and desperate as he dumps the entire stack of papers in a nearby garbage can
He starts to turn away when he notices an ad on the back of the paper for a book
"The Masks We Wear" by Dr
Arthur Neuman, the man we saw interviewed on "The Larry King Show
" The byline reads "The Mysterious Powers of the Identities Within Us
" Stanley rips out the ad and hurries off down the street
: '  - -
Dozens of them line one wall
Tribal masks
Victorian masks
Ceramic masks
Masks from all countries and cultures
Stanley paces the plush office like a caged animal while Dr
Neuman sits nearby toying with his pipe
This is extremely unusual, Mr
Ipkiss
Barging in without an appointment or
Look, you're the big expert on masks, right
Well, 've got an emergency here
(his face ) Try to calm yourself
Now this woman you were telling me about, 'm not sure  understand the problem
've got a date with the girl of my dreams, only she doesn't know it's me
Stanley suddenly reaches into his briefcase and pulls out the mask
(
) It's this thing
(takes the mask) Very interesting
looks like tenth or eleventh century Scandinavian
Where did you get this
(snatches it back) found it
or it found me
'm not sure
The problem is it's ruining my life
So you believe this actually changes you into a different person
Yes
(face twitches) It's turning me into some kind of lunatic
(briefly  into a Mask expression) Mr
Ipkiss, please
This is just obsessional dellusion
What you have here is nothing more than a piece of wood
But your book says masks
My book uses masks as a metaphor for our complex personalities
The masks we must present to the outside world
to suppress the id
To protect our innermost desires
Yeah, well this one works in reverse
You're going to have to be willing to work on this delusion or
It's not a delusion
Alright, 'll prove it to you if  have to, but  won't be responsible for the consequences
Mr
Ipkiss please
There is no such thing as a magical mask
(holds up mask) Last chance to hide all dangerous objects
Alright then, go on
You're not going to frighten me
Stanley takes a deep breath and shoves the mask onto his face
Whooooooooaaaaa
He starts spinning around
Whoa, what
Stanley just stands there like an idiot
Nothing happened
He tries it again
Same result
It didn't work
Does that surprise you
The mask is nothing but a reflection of you - the inner you
Stanley isn't listening
He's thinking out load
It worked last night
And the night before
Maybe it only works at night
What kind of mask did you say this was
Scandinavian
It looks like a representation of Loki, the Norse God of Mischief
He supposedly caused so much trouble that Odin banished him from Valhalla forever
() What if he banished him
into a mask
() 'm sorry, Mr
Ipkiss, we're out of time
But what should  do about my date
Your date
You know
Tonight
The park
Tina
Do  go as myself of the Mask
Dr
Neuman puts an arm around Stanley and leads him to the door
Mr
Ipkiss, please
Haven't you been listening to anything 've been saying
Go as yourself
And as the Mask
(a beat) Because they are the one and the same, beautiful person Stanley sees this is a losing battle
He turns and walks out
: - Lt
Kellaway sits in this unmarked police car, finishing up lunch
The police band comes on
Kellaway grabs it
Yeah
(
) 've got that cross-check from the bank files
And
(
) It's Ipkiss, Alright
Stanley Ipkiss
Kellaway smiles to himself
At that moment - comes out of Dr
Neuman's office building
He gets in his car and drives off
(
) You want us to pick him up
Don't do a thing until  tell you
Just keep the  team standing by
If this guy's half as bad as he's supposed to be we'll need all the help we can get
fires up his engine and pulls away
- Topiaried ivy reads: "Welcome to Peninsula Park
"  small sign below that reads: "No dumping
" Carrying his briefcase, Stanley enters the park
Stanley passes through a stand of trees and nearly bumps into Tina
Stanley, what are you doing here
Oh, Tina
Hi
You're early
little
just
wanted to make sure you two got together okay
That's nice
(sits down) You know,  hardly ever stop by here
It's hard to believe it was just a garbage heap
(looking at the sky) It's always beautiful at sunset
Those methane emissions really pick up the colors
Wow
They really do
All those pinks and greens
Well
'm sure my cousin will be along any minute
He never shows up anywhere 'till after sundown
He's sort of strange that way
() guess 'll get going
No, Stanley
Stay for a second
was thinking about what you said and , uh,  want you to know appreciate it
Maybe you're right
If  believed in myself a little more  wouldn't rely on guys like Dorian
Dorian
You mean Dorian Tyrel
Yeah
He's sort of my manager
Tina, you've got to be careful of that guy
He's a dangerous criminal
You really mean that, don't you
Absolutely
You ought to hear the stories
No,  mean, you're really worried about me
That's
real sweet, Stanley
'mon, Tina this is serious
How involved are you with this guy
can take care of myself, Stanley
always have
Oh, really
People close to Tyrel have a nasty habit of turning up dead, or haven't you noticed
Look, this may sound a little cold but  do what  have to do to get by, okay
'm nobody in this town without Dorian
And who are you with him Tina
'm not exactly sure who  am anymore but at least 'm trying to find out
If you really had any faith in yourself, you wouldn't be hanging on to some kind of free ride
That last bit stung, and Stanley knows it
shadow falls over them as the last rays of the sun disappear behind the clouds
(
) () 'm sorry Tina
guess  better get going
Stanley gets up and hurries off through the trees
() Stanley
wait
But he's already disappeared
Tina starts to follow after when she hears a strange
whirlwind begins to kick up the leaves all around her
The Mask leaps out from behind a stand of trees in all his glory and literally sweeps her off her feet
With his lower lip thrust out he romances Tina in a deep syrupy French voice
Cher
Ce moi
Je'taime, Je' taime, Je any old tame
At last we are together mon petite bon bon
Kellaway, Doyle, and two other officers are watching from a distance
He speaks into his walkie talkie in hushed tones
This is Kellaway
need back up and  need it now
Every available man down to Peninsula Park
- , an old timer newshound hurries into the room, grabs his notebook and pulls on his coat
Looks like it's gonna be a long night
My wife is gonna kill me
What is it, Murray
The cops got your pal Ipkiss staked out at Peninsula Park
We just picked it up over the police band
Let me cover it, Murray
You go on home to Claire
don't know, Peggy
Ramsey said
(grabs her coat) 'll take care of Ramsey
Thanks a million
owe you one
She gives Murray a quick peck on the cheek and runs out the door
: The Mask is all over Tina like a cheap suit, stroking her hair grabbing her bod
She's definitely having second thoughts about him as he backs her up to the bench
Our love is like a red red rose, and 'm feeling so thorny already, 'd like to nip you in the bud
She ducks his grab, but he recovers smoothly, flipping out a pack of cigarettes
He pops one in her mouth
(
) Cigarette
His hand is a blur of motion as he sticks dozens of cigarettes in her mouth
(
) Regular
Menthol
Filter
Cigar
Cigarette
Tiparillo
He produces a huge blow torch from within his jacket and pops on the flame
(
) Let me get that for you
He grabs the gigantic wad of cigarettes as if they were one, puts them in his own mouth and applies the blow torch
With one mighty he smokes them all down to gray ash
Beat
The ash tumbles away
(
) (exhales a huge cloud of smoke) Aaaaaah
And now
amore
He throws his arms wide and lunges at Tina
Freeze
The Mask freezes in mid-air, arms outstretched and feet suspended off the ground
(
) Put your hands up
The Mask's lips barely move as he speaks in a tiny voice out the side of his mouth
But eu 'tol me 'oo freeze
Alright, alright
Unfreeze
You're under arrest
The Mask instantly drops to the ground and throws himself into wildly exaggerated expressions of remorse and pain
Under arrest
My god
The Law
knew 'd forgotten something
() was so young
So foolish
So full of life
Tears are gushing from Stanley/Mask's eyes like twin water taps
He puts his hands out and Kellaway slaps on the cuffs
(
) What
What'll they do with me, Sarge
Sorry, son
That's not my department
Search him
Doyle reaches into the Mask's zoot suit and starts tossing stuff on the ground
Comb - Flintstones vitamins - Sousaphone - Bazooka - () picture of Kellaway's wife
Kellaway looks down at the photo
It really  a picture of his wife with a handwritten note: "Call me, lover - 555-1234
" What the --
() Margaret
Furious, Kellaway  at Stanley/Mask's neck
Two other officers restrain him
You son of a bitch --
/ Jeez,  figured you had a sense of humor
() After all, you married her
Stanley/Mask honks Kellaway's nose which makes a loud noise and runs for it
Kellaway starts to follow, but discovers he's now handcuffed to Doyle
Get him
The other police officers draw their guns and give chase as Stanley  off through the trees hooting laughter
twelve foot high stone wall surrounds the park
Stanley/Mask races through the entryway,  the park's huge wooden gates behind him
- The Mask throws an iron bolt,  on a huge padlock,  down a steel plate  up a gigantic zipper,  in dozens of nails at high speed and throws himself against the gate panting
But then his eyes   on stalks as he sees what lies on the opposite side of the gate
'
more  than seems humanly possible
They're in cars, armed antipersonnel carriers, hanging from trees, parachuting helicopters
And they're all aiming serious looking guns at
It's all over
Put your hands over your head or we'll open fire
Stanley/Mask looks around, like he's trying to figure a way out of this mess - then - / Hit it
With that, a police   on, and the brightly lit park entry-way becomes a beautifully lit stage
Stanley/Mask strikes a pose, now wearing a straw hat "boater" and weilding a cane
Pedestrians with radios and ghetto blasters look down in shock as a  begins playing from every speaker in town
Stanley/Mask  seductively in time to the music
steps forward, a look of surprise spreaading over her face as, against her will, she opens her mouth in song
They rave about Sloppy Joe - the Latin lothario - but Havana - has a new sensation
It's "Cuban Pete " by Desi Arnaz
(Yes, this is a real song
) (
) He's really a modest guy - although he's the hottest guy - in HavAAAAna - and here's what he has to saaaay - Stanley/Mask steps up to the "stage" and tilts the boater over his eyes, casting a sly glance toward the crowd
/ ("Latin" voice) They call me Cuban Pete - 'm King of the Rumba beat - every time  play the maracas  go chick chick chickie boom
Gene Kelly on acid, Stanley/Mask punctuates his number with any number of sly gestures - winking, nodding, sliding seductively down a street lamp post, doing repeated "splits" on the sidewalk - it's his big number
The cops watch this with open mouthed astonishment
Kellaway climbs over two of his men to scale the wall
He can't believe his eyes
Doyle clamors up beside him
Hey, he's not bad
Kellaway shoots him a dirty look
/ waltzes into the street, prancing just inches from the heavily armed cops
His legs twine around each other like spaghetti, then his upper torso until they're straightened out again
/ (still singing) Yessir, 'm Cuban Pete
The craze of my native street
When  start to dance everything goes chick chick chickie boom
Like some weird, loony case of mass hypnosis, Stanley/Mask waits for the "musical break" to coax the armed cops into  him on the number - as the rough and tumble equivalent of
- The street takes the look of a Busby Berkeley musical as the cops in time to the infectious  beat
- Kellaway leaps/tumbles down from the wall into some bushes and scrambles to his feet
He can't believe his eyes
His cops, his tac squad, his friggin'  team - they're  in the street, dancing with this crazy maniac
Stanley/Mask sidles up to a heavily armed female  officer, "dirty dancing" her across the street - / The senoritas they sing, and how they sling their sombreros --
(It's very nice
So full of --) (dip
) And when they're dancing they bring a happy ring to their vaqueros - they sing their song, all the day loonnnggg - Doyle crash lands beside Kellaway and starts out to join the others, but Kellaway grabs him by the back of his jacket
You go out there and 'll blow your brains out
Furious, Kellaway yanks open the door of an abandoned squad car, pulls out a tear gas gun and fires into the air
The sharp stinging gas seems to break the spell of
The music suddenly  and the high stepping cops stagger away from the line, looking confused
(
) Goddamn it
Arrest that thing
The cops - shaken back to reality - fumble for their weapons
The Mask takes off - dashing into the crowd
spots the Mask and races after him, calling his men
(
) This way
bumps into an   who  at his hideousness
The Mask realizes how obvious he is
He turns away and brings his arms to his head
There's a  sound
And when he turns around, the Mask has now transformed back into
Carrying the mask, Stanley tries to blend in with the crowd
followed by a handfull of officers bears down on him
Halt
Halt or we'll shoot
Stanley quickly cuts down
Stanley races down the lane - cops hot on his trail
Bullets all around him
Just as he reaches the next street
screeches to a halt - almost running Stanley over
The window rolls down revealing
Stanley
Get in
Stanley jumps into the passenger seat
'  -  - Peggy rips around the bend, easily outdistancing the cops
Thanks
Where are we going
Someplace where we'll be safe
- The streets are empty
- Stanley and Peggy sit on stacks of bound newspapers in the vast shadowy shipping room
In the b
g
, a huge machine spews out hundreds of newspapers on an assembly line
Everything's mechanized: printing, folding, wrapping
Peggy hands Stanley a cup of coffee
He's a complete wreck, clothes disheveled, rings under his eyes
saw it
saw the whole thing
What's happening to you, Stanley
It's crazy
've lost all control
When  put on this mask can do anything
be anything, but it's ruining my life
Stanley,  don't know what's happening to you, but  do know this
That letter you sent my column was from a guy with more guts and heart than any of the creeps 've met in Edge City
Whatever this mask is, you don't need it
You
Stanley Ipkiss, are already all you ever need to be
Gosh, Peggy
Do you really mean that
() Actually
no
What
We now hear a door open and footsteps
() What took you guys so long
've been vamping here for twenty minutes
Dorian and three of his men stand there with their guns trained on Stanley
This is him
You have the fifty thou
Sweet Eddy  open a briefcase lined with cash
(
) Right
When he puts on the mask he becomes that green thingamajig
(still dumbfounded) Peggy, what are you doing
Sorry, Stanley
You really are a great guy, but  just can't lose my condo
You know how hard it is to find an apartment in this city
Sweet Eddy and a second thug grab Stanley and hang him over the steel maw of the whirring news press
Okay Ipkiss
Where's the money from the heist
My aparment
It's in my apartment
Thanks
Now  believe you have a pressing engagement
Hey, you said you wouldn't hurt him
Dorian toys with the wooden mask, enjoying his control over the situation
You're right
Easy boys
One thing at a time
Tell me about this mask, Ipkiss
How does it work
don't know
You just put it on
The Mask  theme builds, Dorian raises the mask to his face
Better be careful, boss
With a  of thunder a whirlwind of light and power swirls around Dorian's figure
Unlike Stanley's transformation, Dorian's is much more diabolical
He grows and changes within a nimbus of light
Finally the light dies away and Dorian/Mask rises from a circle of swirling smoke
/ While Stanley was a zoot suited bee-bopper in hyper-drive, Dorian/Mask is more like a hulking evil , fresh out of the lamp and pissed at the world
His diamond earring and touches of his neuvo-gangster look is still apparent, but his huge grin stretches out like a Rex's under eyes that glow green with wicked power
His voice is a deep inhuman
What a rush
Whoa, boss
are you okay
/ 'm better than ever, you idiot
Now stop the presses
There'll be a new headline tonight
Sweet Eddy stands there looking disappointed with Ipkiss still held dangling above the churning presses
But what about him
Dorian/Mask wheels about and  at Sweet Eddy
/ have other plans for Ipkiss
Everything's become so clear to me now
Peggy sheepishly reaches for the suitcase
Ah
excuse me
If you don't mind, 'll just take my money and be going
You guys make yourselves at home
Dorian/Mask slides up to Peggy threateningly
/ Must you go
What a shame
You and  could make beautiful headlines together
Peggy removes his arm from her shoulder
Thanks, anyway
That wasn't part of the deal
Peggy snatches the briefcase, but Dorian/Mask blocks her exit
/ Of course
You only want what's coming to you, don't you
Peggy whips out a snub-nose
38 out from beneath her coat
Back off Freakazoid
wasn't born yesterday
/ Ah
But you might die today
Dorian throws the switch and the presses  to life
In a flash he snatches Peggy off her feet
/ (
) girl like you deserves to have her face plastered all over page one
He tosses her into the grinding mill of steel and paper
as Peggy's feet disappear between the presses' huge rollers and continues down, down past the whirling gears and hydraulics to finally  on the chute where the newspapers roll out on a conveyor belt
Headlines in blood red ink now read: "Reporter Killed in Freak Accident" next to a picture of a slightly flattened-looking Peggy, her mouth open in a silent scream
What do we do with Ipkiss
/ The police are looking for the Mask
We shall give them the Mask
And Eddy
Yeah, Dorian
/ Get the boys ready
The Swedes' expecting us at the casino opening tomorrow night
We wouldn't want to disappoint him, would we
Dorian/Mask throws his head back and lets loose a deep It's unnerving even to Eddy, but he laughs nervously in and elbows the other thugs to join in
: '  - The door is kicked open and two of Dorian's henchmen burst into the room
Milo leaps off the couch and scrables behind the curtains
They yank open the closet door and start scooping the cash into plastic garbage bags
- Stanley lies in the back seat, gagged, bound hand and foot and half hidden under a blanket
thug in the driver's seat pokes his
45 under Stanley's nose
That money better be where you said it was, Ipkiss or you can Ipkiss your ass goodbye
He chuckles at his own little joke
Milo peeks out from behind the curtain as the henchmen finish their job
He ducks behind the curtain and looks out the window
'
of the henchmen's car
Stanley can barely be seen peeking out the car window
The henchmen pushes him back down
His ears perk up
The boss is in trouble
He checks back outside the curtain
finish up and start out the door carrying the trash bags
Milo races right by them, just out of sight
The henchmen hop in and start the engine
As the car peels out into traffic, Milo appears, valiantly racing along the sidewalk, pedestrians and cross-traffic to keep the car in sight
: - Dejected, Lt
Kellaway heads up the steps with Sgt
Doyle
still can't believe it
Hardened cops dancin' in the streets
and broadcast all over the ten o'clock news
The  team got an offer to open for Wayne Newton
'm history
The Captain's going to have my badge for breakfast
With a little pension on top
'mon Lieutenant, it wasn't your fault
Something will turn up
Sure
Stanley Ipkiss is going to fall right into my lap
car
The door flies open and a  comes tumbling out - knocking Kellaway down
He looks up at the body sitting in lap - Ipkiss
can explain everything
Don't bother
Doyle pulls a    out of Stanley's pocket
Kellaway starts hauling him up the precinct steps
You have the right to remain silent, you freakin' Looney Tune
Anymore of your half-baked wisecracks can and will be used against you by me, personally
You've got to listen to me
Kellaway and Doyle drag Stanley into the precinct - just as charges up
But the dog is shut out of the station
- Bruised, beaten and exhuasted - Stanley's thrown into a small cell
The - locks the cell up - then walks away
Stanley looks around his dismal quarters
filthy toilet
The cot even worse
There's a
He climbs up on the cot and looks out the small, barred window
'
: There's a dumpster below the window, overflowing with trash
Next to the trash heap - is
The dog looks up at Stanley and happily
Stanley forces a smile
Go find yourself a new home, Milo
It looks like 'm going to be here for a long long time
Milo watches Stanley recede back into the cell
- Stanley lies on his cot - staring at the ceiling
The Guard bangs on the door
Wake up
You gotta visitor
About time you found me a lawyer
(a beat) Tina
Hello, Stanley
What's wrong
Your boyfriend kick you out for not delivering me on schedule
Is that what you think - that set you up
don't know
But 've got plenty of time to figure it out
You're just going to have to trust me on this
Now is not the best time for me on trusting women
ran out on Dorian last night, Stanley
just came to tell you 'm sorry
Sorry about everything
You ran out on him
That magic mask of yours turned him into some kind of monster
He wasn't exactly Mother Theresa in the first place
He's going to the casino opening tonight and he's planning to do something terrible
real change of pace for him
Half this town will be there Stanley
tried to tell the cops, but they wouldn't listen to me
As long as he's got the mask, there's nothing they can do to stop him anyway
There's nothing anyone can do
There must be some way
How does it work
() It's like it brings you innermost desires to life
If deep down inside you're a little repressed and
a hopeless romantic, you become sort of a love-crazy wild man
And if you've got a black heart
Then the world's going to be a very dark place
And if  were you, 'd get out of town
Fast
Tina takes a beat and absorbs this information
Thanks
For what
Lots of things
For really believing in me when  couldn't
For sharing a sunset with me
For being the first guy to treat me like  was a person instead of a slab of meat
(a beat) And for being any kind of romantic
Even a hopeless one
() You're welcome
You know, that night at the club knew  met someone special
Someone like nobody 'd ever met before
The Mask
No
the guy that was inside the Mask all the time
You
Stanley Ip - They draw closer
The iron bars scrunch up their faces
(
) --kiss
They
sweet, soft and romantic kiss
Then
the - pulls her away
- Time's up, lady
've got to disappear for awhile Stanley
'm not sure where 'll go but 'll let you know as soon as  can
Stanley takes a long last look at Tina as she's escorted out
- Warily, Tina slips out of the precinct
She's about to cross the street, but spots a  , engine idling
Quickly, she doubles back and heads - Behind the station
She looks over her shoulder
No one's there
Tina hurries toward the next street and - roars up, cutting her off
She turns and runs back the way she came - but freezes when   screeches up, blocking her
Sweet Eddy and Hicks jump out of the limo
She
'  -    - Stanley watches helplessly as Tina is dragged into the limo
Frantic, Stanley runs to the cell door
(to the Key-Guard) Hey
girl's being kidnapped out there
Do something
tunrs up the volume on , drowning Stanley out
'  - slick/modern house on the hills overlooking Edge City
Sweet Eddy pulls Tina from the limo
' Sweet Eddy and Huey enter and push Tina roughly into the room
Dorian rises to meet her
() Baby, there you are
(he embraces her) was gettin' all worried about you
just went out for a little while Dorian
Sweet Eddy holds up a small suitcase and an overstuffed shoulder bag he got from her car
Looks like maybe a long little while, right baby
Dorian grabs her by the throat and  her against the wall
The pictures rattle
You know what happened to the last bitch that ran out on me
Do you
() No
Nobody else does either
Nobody ever will
He tosses her onto the bed
She lies there gasping for breath
Now fix yourself up, baby
And pick out something pretty to wear tonight
Dorian picks up the mask and admires it
(
) We're going to make a big splash at that opening
One this town will never forget
: - Agitated, Stanley paces around the room
Stanley's eyes pop open
An
He stands up, clunking his heaad on the upper bunk
peers down the hall and sees watching a  boxing match
He's  on the leather key-chain strap
There's a half eaten sausage and a wedge of cheese on the desk
climbs up on the cot and looks out the window
(stage whisper) Milo
- Just a pile of trash
The dog's gone
Then
a
filthy blanket moves
and  emerges from it - tail waggling as he sees Stanley
The little dog jumps up, helplessly trying to reach the window
Come on, boy
Milo gets an idea
He jumps on boxes and trash bags, using them as steps
He climbs higher and higher until he's reached the top of the dumpster
(
) Come on, Milo
Milo jumps from the dumpster
He almost reaches the window, but falls back down again into the trash heap
The dog leaps a second time
On this jump, Stanley grabs him and brings him through the bars
- Stanley gathers Milo up in his arms
The dog licks his face and joyously
Stanley muzzles him and peeks - The Key-Guard's  in his chair
The chewed leather key- chain strap is still in his
His half-eaten sausage and cheese still lies before him
shows Milo the guard, then whispers in the dog's ear
Keys, Milo
Get the keys
Milo cocks his head at the sound of the word
He zips out through the bars
- Milo trots down the hall and approaches the key-guard's station
The dog stares and sniffs at the  man
'  - Milo returns, slipping back into the cell
Good boy
He pulls the wedge of cheese out of the dog's mouth
(
) said "keys" not "cheese"
Keys
---
keys
Stanley pushes the dog back out the cell
He approaches the guard and stops - staring at the keys dangling from the man's mouth
Milo jumps up on the desk and bites down on key-chain
He starts to pull when
The guard stirs and almost wakes up
Milo freezes
moment later, the guard starts  again
Milo grabs the keys and trots back to Stanley's cell
Atta boy, Milo
Now let's see if we can get out of here
: - Built on pilings at the edge of the marina, the extravagant Vegas-like structure looks like a stylized Viking castle
(Production note: Key mater shots will be matte paintings
) and tuxedoed  crowd around as the Swede and town prepare to cut a huge red ribbon and officially open the casino
Two statuesque  in scanty Valkyrie (Viking goddess) costumes present the Swede with a gigantic pair of
The applaudes and flashbulbs
So, ladies and gentlemen with a special thanks to Mayor Tilton and everyone else who made this possible,  give you
the Valhalla Casino
With a mighty  of the scissors the Swede cuts the ribbon and the doors of the casino open wide
: - Dorian's limo barrels through the streets of Edge City followed by two sedans full of his men
- as it disappears behind the clouds
as the limo's moon roof slides shut
We tilt down to discover Dorian and Tina, dressed to the nines for the opening
Dorian holds the mask in his lap
It's almost time
Tina nervously starts to light a cigarette
Dorian snatches the lighter away from her
(
) wouldn't do that, Sweetie
We don't want to start the celebration early
Dorian flips back a blanket covering four compact wooden crates marked "-7 - Caution
Demolition Materials
" (
) Now sit back and try to relax
've got to change for the party
Dorian slowly raises the mask to his face as Tina watches in horror
The tinted glass   from inside like muted fireworks as Dorian's transformation begins
: -
- from his snoring mouth down to his gun as a hand carefully lifts it out of his holster
Gun in hand, Stanley silently backs away with Milo at his side
The Guard chokes off a snore and begins to wake up
He sees Stanley's cell door standing open and goes for his gun
but grasps air
puts one hand over his eyes and slams the butt of the gun down as hard as he can on the Guard's head
The Guard drops back on his chair unconscious
Stanley peeks from beneath his hand and regards his work
Not bad
Milo yips happily
Come on
Stanley turns and starts for the door when he bumps straight into Lt
Kellaway
Ipkiss
Stanley is shocked, but quickly realizes he's got the gun
He points it at Kellaway with greater authority
Hold it
warn you
'm seriously stressed out here
Easy, Ipkiss
Don't be an idiot
You're in the middle of a police station
There's no way you're just going to walk out of here
() You're right
Stanley pockets Kellaway's gun while keeping him covered with the Guard's gun
He pulls the handcuffs from Kellaway's belt and begins to handcuff the two of them together
Now what are you doing
Putting myself in your custody
You are certifiable
Stanley unbuttons his shirt and holds it open
Milo
Milo immediately jumps inside and Stanley buttons up
He now looks like he has a pretty nasty pot belly, but otherwise okay
(
) Okay
Now we have to hurry or we'll miss the party
Of course
We wouldn't want to keep Alice and the white rabbit waiting
Keeping the gun jammed in Kellaway's ribs, Stanley folds his jacket over his gun hand
We hear it cock beneath the jacket
- Now move
: The opening is in full swing as the limo and two sedans pull up to the front doors
- as the   attempts to open the passenger door, it off and shoots ten feet from the car taking the unfortunate Car Hop with it
Dorian/Mask steps out of swirling mists within the limo in all his wicked green glory
/ Don't be shy, Tina
know how you like to make an entrance
He pulls her out of the limo
/ And  must say, that's a dress to die for
Or should  say in
Dorian's men scramble, hauling the -7 out of the limo and racing off into the darkness with their automatic weapons
: Lt
Kellaway and Stanley march past ,  and in the front desk area looking stiff and unnatural as hell
Doyle waves hello from the coffee service as he munches on a chocolate doughnut
Hi Lieutenant
Where are you taking Ipkiss
Ixnay
Ehay's otgay an ungay
ouch
Stanley jams him in the ribs with that hidden gun
What did you say
Milo pokes his head up out of Stanley's shirt, but Stanley instantly pushes it back down
Doyle does a double-take wondering what's wrong with this picture as they continue their stiff-legged walk out the door
Doyle gives an uncertain wave with his half-eaten doughnut
(
) See ya
: The casino is a true Caesar's Palace style show place featuring a dragon-prowed Viking ship that's the of the room
The gaming floor is packed with happy
on Charlie Schumacher as he snatches a drink off a passing ' tray and turns to a gorgeous Valkyrie change girl whose helmet has two large horns sticking out of it
Hello tall, Nordic and beautiful
One look at you and  know how your hat feels
Suddenly Mrs
Peenman appears, pushing her way past Charlie with a paper bag filled with quarters
Out of my way, Buster
Mama feels lucky tonight
She jams a quarter in a slot machine right behind Charlie and throws her weight behind the handle
as they suddenly  inward, blowing Security Man off their feet
Dorian/Mask steps through the smoking ruin dragging Tina after him
He's flanked by a half dozen of his heavily armed men
/ Now
let the games begin
Armed Security pull their weapons, but are immediately blown away by the thugs
The crowd is thrown into a panic
: / As it tears through the streets of Edge City with its siren Kellaway sits in the rear of the car with his hands cuffed behind his back
Stanley's at the wheel with Milo at his side
Kellaway is livid
Ipkiss, 'll have you locked up for this so long sex will be safe again
Kellaway is thrown into the door as Stanley  around a corner
: The frightened crowd mills about in terror as Dorian's thugs seal off the exits
They frisk down their captives for loot and jewelry
Orlando runs up to Dorian/Mask with canvas sacks filled with money
We scored over half a mil from the safe
now pops out from behind a mock-stone pillar and opens fire on Dorian
Orlando dives for cover
The bullets seem to have no effect as Dorian rips a Viking spear off a wall display and hurls it straight across the room with supernatural force
The spear  the Security Guard, sends him flying back and him to a slot machine which immediately rings  and spills out quarters
/ You can come out now, Orlando
think he got the point
Dorian hauls Tina over to the Vikin ship where his men are wiring up boxes of -7 and sticks of dynamite
He slams her up against the prow as his men lash her in place with coils of rope
Let me go you bastard
/ What's wrong darling
This is your big production number
You of all people know how important it is to go out with a bang
Dorian pulls his walkie talkie out
/ (
) Eddy
How goes it
- Sweet Eddy and two other Thugs are busy wiring explosives to the pillars that support the pier the casino rests on
All set boss
Dorian plugs the timer into the nexus of all the wiring
/ Excellent
The real party starts now and ends in
(sets timer) Thirty minutes
- Stanley  to a halt in the cop car
He turns to Kellaway, brandishing his gun
Okay
When  push the red button the safety is off, right
'm not helping you, Ipkiss
Alright, suit yourself
(to Milo) You stay and be a good boy
As soon as Stanley shuts the door Milo starts pawing at the handle
The Swede scrambles under a crap table to escape the mayhem and bumps into Mayor Tilton
Hey, watch it
Oh, Arnie
Suddenly the entire table is lifted away as if it were a child's toy and they look up into the evil grinning of Dorian/Mask
/ Swede
my dear, dear business partner
And Mayor Tilton
What a surprise
We have just enough time left to play my favorite game
As Stanley sneaks in an employee's door, the coast looks clear
He snaps off the kitchen lights
Stanley spots a  standing guard outside the kitchen's double doors
He ducks back down behind a barrel and gets an idea
The label on the barrel reads "Olive Oil"
The Thug seems to be enjoying the mayhem when he hears an off camera
He pulls out his
45 and cautiously enters the kitchen to investigate
The Thug enters, brandishing his gun and cautiously makes his way into the kitchen
- He steps into a large slick of olive oil and his legs shoot right out from under him
'
as he slides across the kitchen floor at high speed
Whoaaaaa
Suddenly Stanley pops up from behind the overturned barrel with a huge frying pan and slams it right into camera
plucks the gun from the unconscious Guard and sneaks into the casino
Stanley appears out of the kitchen doors and gets the attention of the nearest captive party-goers
Pssst
You guys
Over here
Charlie turns around
Stanley
What are you doing here
He motions them over to the kitchen and hands Charlie the gun
Start sneaking people out the back
Watch out for the oil
Stanley now makes his way deeper into the casino
- Milo finally manages to pop the lock and the car door opens
He scurries off towards the casino
The Swede struggles desperately as he's tied to a spoke of a huge wooden  , a kind of upright roulette wheel that's one the casino's attractions
Mayor Tilton and two other town dignitaries are tied to the other three spokes
Let me offa this thing, you lousy scumbag
Dorian/Mask pulls three Viking hand axes off a wall display and casually begins to juggle them
/ Sorry Swede
've got an ax to grind with you
In fact  got a couple and 'm afraid they may give you a splitting headache
He nods to one of his men who gives the wheel a big spin
As the captives  Dorian prepares to throw his first ax
/ (
) Round and round she goes
Who dies first, nobody knows
Stanley pops up behind the dragon-prow and starts untying Tina
Stanley
Hang on, Tina
Stanley, look out
Stanley ducks just as a Viking ax splits the dragonhead right next to him in half
Dorian  with rage as he rushes across the room to the boat
Stanley pops back up firing his gun
Dorian takes the direct hits
He grins horridly at Stanley and he extends his slimy tongue
- The bullets all stand there on end in a neat little semi-circle
Dorian now sucks in a mighty breath
Stanley grabs a Viking shield and protects Tina and himself
Dorian blows the bullets back at Stanley
---
They batter the shield
Stanley's knocked backwards from the impact
drags Stanley out and  up against the prow next to Tina
One of his men immediately begins tying Stanley in place
/ How touching
The two love birds
Just to show you there's no hard feelings, 'm going to let you spend the rest of your lives together
You've got it all wrong
could care less about this creep
Nobody could replace you, Dorian
Nobody
/ If you think a line like that's going to save your life, you're dumber than he is
() Okay
Maybe it's too late
Then all  want is
a kiss
/ kiss
One last kiss
/ (a beat) Sure, why not
Dorian/Mask sticks out his slimy - , and stick his eyebrows back
Hiss massive lips flutter as he puckers up
But Tina turns her head way
No
From the real Dorian
The guy  used to love
() Nobody ever kissed me like Dorian Tyrel
No time, boss
This building's going down any minute
/ make the decisions
And 've decided
Tina stares at him dreamily
Ego gets the better of him
He reaches up and  the mask off
/ to give the girl one last thrill
He plants his mouth on Tina's -- kissing her roughly
Tina really gets into it
But Stanley watches as Tina slyly positions the leg that he freed up
And
- right out of Dorian's hand
It flies into the air
-
,  and
But then suddenly
shockingly
, soar straight up through thr human hands and
as though it were a Frisbee
Everyone's stunned
The dog lands back on the ground -- the mask firmly in his mouth
He starts to run away but
Dorian grabs his hind leg
'mere, you ugly little mutt
legs pumping frantically, is losing ground
At the last second, he drops the mask and jams his muzzle into it
Lightning
' eyes widen as -- /
His pint-sized doggy body now has a giant-sized   with a double-row of
The plain collar now sparkles with
- distend
The eyes glow hell fire green
(
) Whoa
Reflexively, Dorian lets go
Dog/Mask unleashes an incredibly loud   that explodes glass front slot machines all around them
(
) Don't let it get away
Sweet Eddy lunges at the Dog/Mask
But the canine-creature runs between his legs and   on his butt
The tiny dog picks Sweet Eddy up and shakes him back and forth, like a rag doll
watches this, then takes a look at the
Less than a minute to go
He strains at his bonds -- forcing the rope into a Tina winces as Stanley's hand-rope begins to burn
/ uses Eddy as a club -- knocking other Thugs down
Get him off me
Dorian raises his Uzi and
Dog/Mask leaps away in the nick of time
'mon
We've got the money
Let's get the hell out of here
gotta have that mask
Dorian chases Dog/Mask into the maze of slot machines
burns through his ropes
He frees himself and races to the detonator
15 - 14 - 13 - 12 Dorian stalks Dog/Mask, whistling for him to come
stream of now trickles down on him from above
Dog/Mask is in the chandelier taking a whiz and snorting doggie laughter
Dorian sprays the ceiling with gunfire, but
/ pounces on Dorian, knocking him flat, then races out of sight
Stanley yanks one wire after another, but the timer still ticks down -- 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 -- Stanley pulls the last wire
The timer stops
Tina exhales, relieved, as Stanley unties her
(kissing him) You did it
- as it  back to life
2 - 1 - 0
muffled  rumbles from beneath the floorboards
- The two front support pilings
- The entire floor
Gaming tables and slot machines start to slide by
Stanley grabs Tina and hangs onto the prow of the boat
Milo
Milo, come
Dog/Mask appears racing up the tilting floor and leaps into the boat as
The entire casino floor drops straight down
straight across the gaming floor towards the huge front doors
as the boat slides right over him
- The Viking ship  through the doors and  down in the marina as the entire casino sinks into the water
- It bobs for a moment, then floats
Stanley, Tina and the dog emerge from their hiding place, under one of the dining tables
They can't quite believe they're alive
Their faces reflect romantically from the light of the Viking torch sconces
Stanley
we made it
We're alive
Milo lets loose a happy "Whoof
" and leaps into Stanley's arms
Stanley removes the mask with a  and Milo transforms back into a regular dog
'll take that
They turn as  clamors over the side of the boat
He's got a gun pointed right at them
Stanley slides an iron grappling hook through the mask's eye holes and holds it overboard
Hold it right there or you'll be looking for this on the bottom of the harbor
Dorian stops in his tracks
Drop it and 'll kill you all
You can have it
But she gets to go
Fine
Go where
Swimming
We're still close to shore
Five seconds, Ipkiss
Stanley tosses a wooden barrel overboard and turns to Tina
Go ahead
Hurry
Tina takes the dog and slips overboard
Dorian moves in
Okay
Put it down
Right over there
Dorian waves his gun at the nearest dining table
Stanley starts to put down the mask
But at the last instant -- he tosses it As Dorian turns to see where it lands, Stanley jumps him
Dorian but misses
Stanley jumps Dorian -- knocking his gun away
Dorian falls into one of the   -- toppling it
The   slug it out as a
It burns closer and closer to the dynamite -- the mask in the middle of the pile
Tina and Milo cling to the floating barrel
(sees fire) Stanley
The dynamite
Dorian pummels Stanley with a flurry of jabs to the head as the toward the explosives
But Stanley counters with a solid right that rocks Dorian back
Dorian grabs him by the collar to retaliate but sees
The  licking at the dynamite casing on which the mask lies
Dorian lunges for the mask
Stanley jumps overboard
The dynamite explodes
Tina and Milo watch as the ship blows up
The fireball burns bright, smoke everywhere
Stanley
Beat
Stanley surfaces gasping for breath
Tina pulls him over to the barrel and Milo licks his face
And then the smoke parts revealing
/ standing on the remains of the boat
Like Wile
Coyote, he's charred pitch black, with singed hair and clothes
But like a cartoon -- he just shakes off the soot and stands there in all his fearsome Dorian/Mask glory
/ What a
This mask makes me a god
He picks up the last fizzing, but     and laughs
/ (
) 'm immortal
He raises his arms and thunders to the heavens
At that moment -- the  peaks over the horizon
/ (
) Do you hear
'm immortal
The sun's rays hit the Mask
In an instant, he transforms back to regular Dorian
The mask pops off Dorian's face -- useless
Dorian stares dumbfounded at the  stick in his hand as it -- -
Dorian is blown to smithereens
- There are cops everywhere
Lt
Kellaway wraps Tina in a dry blanket
Stanley holds out his arms
Back to jail, Lieutenant
Ipkiss, 'd like to lock you up for the rest of my life
But the mayor and a hundred other witnesses say Dorian Tyrel's the bad guy and you're the good guy
So no jail
Just a downtown parade at noon
() And 've got to be your escort
Stanley smiles and puts his arms around Tina
They head down the beach
The two young lovers and Milo walk past -- standing near the crowd of post-party  being helped by the and
He's still hitting on that Valkyrie change girl
So  deck this thug, grab his gun and tell Stanley, "Take cover, Buddy
'll get these folks out sae and sound
" 'know we should go back to my place so can tell you the rest of the story
Mrs
Peenman is walking along grumbling to herself when she notices the mask floating to shore with some of the wreckage from the boat
Just look at this mess
She picks it up out of the surf and The Mask  theme begins to pound in her head
Back to Charlie and his Valkyrie
So what do you say, sweetheart
Let's you and me go back to my place and scramble some eggs
Suddenly Mrs
Peenman/Mask  up and sweeps Charlie off his feet
She's the most whacked-out Mask creature yet with a huge Witch Hazel face and Bride of Frankenstein hair
/ Hello short, dark and handsome
'mere and give Momma a kissy-poo
She starts  her king-sized lips horribly
() Yah
Put me down
She jams a hand down the front of Charlie's pants
/ Let's see what caliber pistol you're packing there, soldier boy
She gets a grip and squeezes
Charlie , ttears himself from her grasp and starts running for his life
with Mrs
Peenman as she  after him hooting laughter
We  on Stanley and Tina as they watch the spectacle pass them by
They turn and embrace for a well deserved kiss as Milo yips happily and squirms up between them
