He is very drunk, disheveled and cheerful beyond his means

The aides flag it down and throw Fallow onto the cart
The cart carries him past the garbage con- tainer into a long tunnel-like corridor
sways on the cart, trying to mix a drink for himself -- he pulls a glass out of one pocket and some ice cubes out of another pocket
But he is physically incompetent
jumps onto the cart and tries to hold him up
The male aide runs alongside the cart
in black tie carry covered silver trays as they trot through the tunnel
come running in the other way, pushing carts filled with dirty dishes and glasses
comes to the end of the tunnel and jerks to a halt
Fallow loses his balance and sprays the female aide with soda water
pulls Fallow off the cart and continues to lead him through a dark, red-lit area
Several security guards run to meet them
The guards and the aide now escort Fallow through the area
pop out of nowhere, trying to get a picture
The guards push them away and lead Fallow into a lighted corridor
and his wife and daughter join the entourage as they head for an elevator
The diplomat offers Fallow a pen and a book to autograph
Fallow misses the pen and falls face down into the breasts of the diplomat's daughter
The guards pull him into the elevator

The elevator starts to move
Fallow falls into the mousse
The aide pulls him up and tries to clean him off

Fallow is led out of the elevator

Ah, Sherman

Pollard, you old phrase-maker
beg your pardon

Is that as witty as we get
As Pollard enters the building and Sherman drags Marshall away
don't know what you're talking about
And furthermore, if you plan on being wet when you return, suggest you take the service elevator

Above him, the tremendous noise of   along the expressway
But he can't see them
He can only hear them and feel their vibration
He stands there a moment, taking in the strangeness of the place and of his own situation -- the tire, Maria, his wife, his life
little chill of lone- liness hits him
He shakes it off and walks to the tire -- a simple, inevitable move toward a destiny he could never have imagined

One big, young, powerfully built ( )

The two young men are moving steadily toward him
What happened, man
You need some help
No thanks
Hi
No,  don't think so
No
Thank you very much
Sherman is confused
He doesn't move
Maria gets behind the wheel of the car
Roland reaches slowly into his jacket pocket
He smiles and keeps moving toward Sherman
Sherman sees the hand moving out of the jacket pocket
He is still frozen

Roland steps in front of him
They both keep moving
Where you going with that tire
Oh
Is this yours
Here
You take it
Sherman pushes the tire toward Roland
Roland pushes it back at him
Sherman throws up his arms
The tire bounces off his arms and knocks Roland down
Oh
Sorry

There was this sound

'm sorry
But you see, you have no witness
Without a witness, there's no case of anything at all
You got what he told his mother
That's hearsay
You may believe it and  may believe it, but it's not admissable in a court of law
If this boy was born on Park Avenue and he was run down by two niggers in a Pontiac Firebird, then you'd have a case
Wouldn't you
work Park Avenue and  work Bruckner Boulevard, Reverend
There's good and bad in both places
Now we'll do everything we can for this lady
But we don't have a hell of a lot to go on
Gentlemen,  want you to make an investment here
An investment in steam control
Steam control
That's right
Steam control
Because a righteous steam is building up in the souls of my people and that steam is ready to blow
see
Well
Now, on judgment day,  am your safety valve
Because when it blows -- and it will, my friend -- how grateful you will be that am on your side -- the one nigger who can control the steam and save your lily white ass from being burned off the face of the earth so to speak

Nothing
uh
no, nothing special
But what's a bond
McCOY (delighted) Oh, yes, Sherman, do explain it
McCOY Yes
Your mother and  really want to hear this, Sherman
bond is a way of lending   people money
Let's say you want   to build a road or a hospital   and you need a lot of money
Well,    you issue a bond
Do you build roads
No,  don't actually build them
McCOY think you're in over your head
More laughter
Here
Let me try
Darling, Daddy doesn't build roads or hospitals or anything, really
Daddy just handles the bonds for the people who raise the money
That's what he said
Bonds
Yes
See, just imagine that a bond is a slice of cake
Now you didn't bake that cake, but every time you hand somebody a slice of that cake, a little bit comes off, little crumbs fall off
And you're allowed to keep those crumbs

Really
McCOY (pointedly) And many a man has sold his soul for those little crumbs
(enjoying this) Yes
And that's what Daddy does
He passes somebody else's cake around and picks up the crumbs
But you have to imagine a lot of crumbs
And a great golden cake
And a lot of golden crumbs
And you have to imagine Daddy running around picking up every little golden crumb he can get his hands on
That's what Daddy does
Well, you can call them crumbs if you want to
That's the best  can do
Excuse me
She gets up abruptly and leaves
Mrs
McCoy goes after Judy
Sherman and his father sit there without talking
Then
McCOY Of course, in my day, there was some integrity to it
Yes
Well
McCOY Now it's not about anything, is it
Except the money

We're having a little
It's nothing serious

We take a picture of Sherman McCoy over to the hospital, to this kid
And three or four other guys, white guys, and we put them by the bed, the pictures
And the kid comes to

And he keeps pointing
Nobody believes what they're hearing -- except Kramer
Might work
That might work
It's a long shot, but it might work
An  rushes up to Kramer and pulls him aside
Mr
Kramer
Yeah
What do you want
(to Weiss) You'll kill him
He wakes up out of a coma and sees four white men in suits and ties staring at him from the end of the bed, he'll shit and die
It's worth a try
don't believe what 'm hearing
Some poor gook with a tube down his throat pointing at a picture

was on the plane
We're going into Mecca, see
And the plane is full of Arabs and all these animals -- sheep, goats, chickens
They won't travel without their animals
We had to put plastic in the cabins
You know, they urinate, they defecate
Yes
Anyway, the plane goes off the runway and we hit the sand with a hell of a jolt and the right wing tip digs into the sand and the plane skids around in a circle
360 degrees before we stop
We're scared shitless
Panic
And we look into the cabin and there's everybody calm, quiet, they're picking up their luggage and their animals and they're looking out the window at the little fire that started on the wing and they're waiting for the doors to open like nothing happened
And then it dawns on me

Annie,  know that nothing can heal the wound that you have suffered
But ten million dollars in damages will certainly make your grief more comfortable
Well, yes,  could use a few things, Reverend, thank you been worried about my clothes for instance
feel that the presentation of my person should be carefully designed
As a model to black mothers everywhere, think  should have the right wardrobe
So if you could have Mr
Fox's limousine pick me up in the morning,  could do some shopping
Why certainly
'll need some furniture, too
And a new refrigerator
And although  should probably continue to live in that shithole of an apartment at least until after the lawsuit is settled, would like to start looking now for a co-op in Manhattan -- for me and my son -- something with a view of the river and preferably in a neighborhood that is at least upwardly mobile

You have to help me, Maria
But how can  help you
Well,  know this may sound like a strange request, but you could start by telling the police what really happened
Oh, Sherman, you are the sweetest thing
But 'm not sure anybody knows what really happened
Not anymore
And if anybody does know, it certainly isn't me
But you were driving the car that night
Was
don't remember
Isn't it funny how a little thing like that can slip your mind

Right on the street
And was there any obstruction or barricade of any kind that caused the car to stop
Oh, no
Nothing like that at all

Why, Sherman never let anyone drive his car
Sherman McCoy was driving the car

Justice is not the will of the few and it's not the will of the many

Or an angle, or a contract, or a hustle or a campaign or a trick or a bid for sympathy
Decency is not the beast that bays for money, power, dominion, position, votes and blood
