With an intimate familiarity she kisses on the top of his head, sits close behind him and wraps her arms around her lover, linking her slender hands across his upper chest
Her head resting on his shoulder, her face beside his, and  watch the fire together in easy silence

Solid as stone, the frozen lake takes his weight

The landscape is magical

There are footprints in the thin snow going out across the lake

Then, about ten metres inland from the edge of the lake, a low branch dips and a thick rug of snow falls from the branch

She grunts, winded
He lies besides her

There's someone in the shadows
He rubs snow into his woollen hat, edges up until he can just see over the snow and pumps   into the dusk under the trees
We hear a muttering groan and then a sliding sound, as if has just shot a tobogganist
More snow slides off the trees

You have a gun
How do you have a gun
Why should you carry such a weapon

The  is slouched forwards in a drift of snow, his body cushioned in white softness

He's dead
Jack talk to me
grabs his collar and turns him over
He doesn't recognise him
fumbles at his buttons and rummages in his clothing
In his breast pocket he finds a
Who is he

He's not dressed like a hunter
Why is he alone
Hunters always go in pairs
For safety
Swiftly,  removes the bolt from the man's rifle and throws it far into the trees
Go for help
Call the police
sets off, stumbling up the track they have made through the snow
shoots her just once, in the nape of her neck
She twitches in the snow, her blood staining the white fur of her coat collar
From a distance,  looks like a shot Snow-hair
approaches her
And steps over her, trying not to look down
Trying not to look back

In the end it is  who confesses to you
Expecting me to reciprocate
Perhaps
For your own good
You cannot doubt the existence of Hell
You live in it
It is a place without love
As for me,  go about my daily duties because the town requires it of me
Some know what you know
Perhaps  have no right to wear these robes
But  do have a heart full of a father's love
Something close to His heart
And for that  am both grateful and happy

Then again, maybe Clara is who she says she is and my Belgian clients will take the gun, shoot me themselves and keep the money
Always a risk in my profession
Or perhaps my trusted colleague in Rome no longer trusts me
Perhaps even you, Father, with your connections in Naples
What will you do

Tomorrow and the next day

It's time to go home
Let me come to your home

One day
She's upset but decides not to press her demand
