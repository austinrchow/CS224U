The Woman glances at the American Ballet magazine on Sara's lap
Tries to make conversation

Never had the body for it
Do you dance
Sara folds her arms, turns away mumbling under breath

As Glynn looks on, Sara completes the routine with a pirouette
She spins out of it with a preoccupied frown on her face
What's the matter
It was good
(checks her stance in mirror) Everybody there's going to be good, Mom
have to be better

That it doesn't do anything
That  don't do anything special enough to get in
Sara
You'll get in
Don't lie because you love me
My free form sucks
(giving up that battle) 've got something for you
Come on
Sit
Mouth closed, eyes shut
No pouting
No peeking
Sara flops down on the sofa beside her
Closes her eyes
Glynn removes the clover chain from her neck, fastens it around Sara's
For luck tomorrow
Not that you'll need it
You dance like an angel
The necklace is Glynn's talisman
Sara knows what it means to her
She throws her arms around Glynn, holds onto her tightly
love the necklace but you're still the best luck 'll ever have
Glynn, not one to choke up, chokes up
They cling to each other

Wanna pray
You're leaving for Philly after first period won't see you
We should pray
(stupefied) Lindsay
no
Not here
Lindsay grabs Sara's hand and bows her head
Sara, embarrassed, aligns her head with Lindsay's
She's praying nobody sees them
'Awesome, Father,

She's ready for them
Please make them ready for her
Even if she screws up
Thanks

Where'd you get those, traitor
Ellison -- Mr
Ellison
He actually told me to break a leg
Roses from the principal, even droopy, out-of-season yellow ones, is beyond cool, kiddo
You're definitely movin' up in the world
Sara looks through the windshield
It's starting to drizzle
Know what would be great
If you didn't drop me off at the bus station
If we just kept going until we get to Philly
Ruin everyone's Valentine's Day and not have a shop when  get back
That's your definition of great
can see the headline now: 'Starving Artist Kills Unfit Mother
' (gently) Sweetheart, we talked about this
'll get there as soon as  can
Sara looks at her and Glynn instantly feels guilty
Right
This is the hardest, most important day of my life and all you can do is get there as soon as you can
Thanks, Mom

Sara's stomach drops to her feet
Her mother's not there and her free form sucks and she doesn't have a theme
Shit
Well, it's um, pretty self- explanatory
The theme
The Judges exchange a look
New
Some driving,
Sara tries to elevate her body above the music, but she's nervous, unsure on her feet
She keeps glancing in the back of the auditorium for Glynn
Searching for her port in the storm
Wondering where her mother is and knowing how badly she's dancing
Knowing but somehow continuing, stumbling, recovering, and finally finishing with those damned knocking knees
The Judges, eyes like stones, perfunctorily nod
Their equivalent of maybe next year
Sara chokes two words out
Thank you

Helped you say good-bye
That's what you were doin', wasn't it
Uh-huh
Roy takes another drag, nods thoughtfully to himself
That's what  figured you were doin'
Sara peers out    the windshield
Baltimore City
The neighborhoods    are changing
The streets are getting progressively    gritty and dirty
It surprises her
It worries her
Roy worries her
Look
Sara
feel bad too mean, we both got hit by the same bolt of lightning
You don't have to pretend this is easy
(off nothing) Everything's upside down right now but don't worry
We'll work this bachelor-father thing out
Hell, it ain't like we're movin' in with strangers
We got a pretty good idea about each other, right
Sara looks askance at him, her expression indicating otherwise

Roy's too new at this to hold up both ends of the conversation
The silence deepens

He and Sara each lug a suitcase from the truck

They're on the fringes of a ghetto
few people roost on their stoops, hang on the corners
All of them have black faces

partition separates the living area from the bedroom
Sara walks past a collection of saxophones and several framed pictures of herself
Aside from the saxophones and the pictures, there's hardly any furniture
Roy lights a cigarette
Not much of what you're used to
But the water's hot and the fridge is full
And  made room in the closets for you
Girl's gotta have closets, right
You even get your own bed
'll crash on the couch
You bought a bed
(slight bow) Pardon me
Your own futon
Check it out
On the other side
Suitcase in hand, Sara walks around the partition
Her "room" is an old futon, an ancient set of drawers
She stands in the middle of nothing, wanting something to do
She removes framed photos of Glynn from her backpack, places them around the room

The last place  saw anyway

Are you alright, Sara

Not around here you don't
Not until you get the hang of things
Sara looks out the window at a full-fledged ghetto
It's all to obvious, the hang of things
Roy glances over at her
called about your transcripts
You're all set
Patterson's got a pretty good Humanities program
No ballet, but we can find a studio someplace close for after school -- --  don't think 'll have time
have to study, 'll be busy
Roy can hear the lie behind her words
The pain too
He lights a cigarette, cracks the window
He wants to say the right thing
Good idea
Take a break
Not too long a break though
You're a dancer
You should dance
Stay on top of your art
Like you stay on top of yours
Maybe  ain't playin' no grand ballrooms or fancy jazz festivals, but 'm playing

This is a near out-of-body experience for her
She walks like a well-rehearsed soldier in a stiff straight line to the school's entrance
It's clogged with students
Inside the doorway, two security guards flank a metal detector
When it's Sara's turn to pass through, one of the guards grabs her backpack and wordlessly begins searching it
He hands it back to her on the other side of the detector where Sara stands obtusely and mutely amazed

Kids like her

Ten rides in five days

Sara's thoughts are jolted by two black girls squeezing by
One clips Sara's elbow as she passes, knocking it against a locker
They keep going as if they don't see her
No one seems to see her

Thrusts it at her
That's how easy it is to give to charity around here
Don't put your shit on the floor
(cautions a smile) Thanks
She closes her locker, starts to say something else
She's eager to make a friend
One friend
But Chenille's gone

Sara gets a fleeting glimpse of him

Heartbreakingly handsome

We don't take ourselves seriously
Just look around
Half the student body is -- and that's from the neck up, Clara
Sara
It's Sara
(
) Yeah
It's Sara
And you're boring her from the ears down
Sara looks up, surprised to see Chenille standing there
She flashes a knowing smile at her, indicates Sara's tray
You finished
Sara leaps up with a quick, grateful nod
Beats a hasty retreat from the table
As she and Chenille walk through the cafeteria, Sara shudders with relief
She feels rescued
God
Thank you

She trails off as she catches someone in the corner of her eye
She turns away from Chenille, gradually focusing on -- playing cards with Snookie at one of the picnic tables
He glances up to see Sara
Glowering at him
He grins
Sara rolls her eyes, turns away
Mutters loudly to herself
Asshole

Thinks he's so

So cute

Real smart
Real trip, too
So you know him
Patrick Reynolds
Hell yeah, know him
He's my brother
Chenille waits for Sara to swallow her tongue
Enjoys a laugh
as Nikki approaches him
Sexy, standoffish and conceited, she's the stuff of wet dreams and futile longing
She sits down next to Patrick
Close to him
Snookie watches her, much amused
You comin' tonight
Patrick keeps playing his hand
Responds very coolly
Gotta work
You already skipped three meetings

Everybody on the committee thinks it's because of me
Us

Patrick throws out a card, turns slowly to Nikki with a withering stare in his eyes
You already fired my ass, Nikki
Once and done
Over
Out
'Bye
She stalks off
Snookie oogles her departure, peers at Patrick, about to say something
Patrick cuts him off, indicates cards
Hit me and shut the hell up

'Specially since she broke up with you
That was harsh, way she canceled your ass like a stamp for that Howard dude

Both of them ignore it
But it goes on like a musical number
Sara gets a sinking feeling that drops like a stone when she looks across the street
Roy's parked at the curb, waiting for her

Fine

'mere a minute
Sara lets out a heavy sigh
What does he want
What
(
) Just come here
She walks into the kitchen
Roy's in front of the open freezer door
Grinning from ear to ear
He motions her over
Sara crosses to the freezer
Looks inside
- It's full of frozen dinners
They're in unruly, lopsided stacks
Roy regards her expectantly
Hungry and Healthys
asked at the market
They're the best
So
What do you feel like
(whimsically) Lamb Chop Suey
Tropical Tuna
Primavera Paradise
had a big lunch
Roy, deflated, closes the freezer door, trails her into the living area
Sara's clenching again
There's no escaping him
What do you wanna do
You wanna hang out with me
Go to my gig
You can if you want
It's a school night, Roy
Right
School night
Got it

It drives home where she is

It's overwhelming

Vestiges of Roy's meal
as Sara enters
She opens the freezer to unearth a dinner and starts an avalanche of falling food
box of Sugar Puffs cereal lands at her feet
Something else out of place
She picks it up, jams everything back into the freezer
Slams the door shut

Wall to wall
Scrubbing away what's churned up inside
The dervish ends in her "room," where she finishes unpacking
Several layers into a suitcase, she comes to her ballet shoes
The sight hits her like a slap in the face
Sara stares at the shoes until her eyes blur
Then she snatches them up and entombs them deep inside her closet

'     -             61 Patrick, Chenille, Snookie straggle through the dreary jungle of concrete lawns and blighted high rises on the way to school
It's quiet now but the scars of past battles, like the bombed out police substation on one of its corners, are evident everywhere
need a date -- Why
Your hand busy
-- For the prom
And if it wasn't for that kinda undue attitude, you could be the lucky girl, Chenille
My personal prom queen
can see us now

Snookie glances at Patrick
He's somewhere else
Help me, man
Defend me
got my own problems, Snook
What problems
You goin' to college
Doctor college after that
You large, man
ain't gonna be doctor nothin' if don't get in and 'm not in 'til get my letter
It's in the mail, Patrick
Okay
(wishfully thinking) probably coulda been a doctor too
If  hadn't got left back that time
That time
What
Fifth and sixth grade don't count
Patrick finally laughs
Then his face changes
Becomes serious
He hops a low wall, keeps in stride above them
They continue on like this, the ruins of their world in the b

behind them

Sara, seated by a window, doesn't bother looking out
Inside's more interesting
The kids cut up
Singing, rapping, and jousting with each other
Some even manage to read
Sara watches with immunity
She's invisible to them
63

Patrick's the only one to see her and their eyes briefly connect

( ) -                 64 Patrick and Chenille pass through metal detectors, watch Snookie clown his way through
The security guard shakes his head
All three begin to walk
Snookie, bobbing and jiving, doesn't see Mrs
Gwynn coming up from behind
Her voice stops him cold
(as Patrick and Chenille look on) Light on your feet
Good
Be sure they dance into my office next week
She moseys on
Snookie regards Patrick's smile, shakes his head

-                          65 The class has donned lab coats and is ready   to begin when Sarah rushes in
She tries to slink into a    seat
The teacher,
, gives her a disapproving   look, points at one of several formulas (C2,H6,O2) on the   blackboard
Sara just looks at him We're cooking today, Ms
Johnson
This is your first lab
You'll need a partner
Mr
Reynolds -- Patrick -- will show you the ropes
Patrick bounces a smile off unsettled Sara
This should be fun
66
-                              66 The class, in safety goggles and gloves, has partnered up
He's holding two vials
Sara picks up a beaker
Stares at the blackboard
She has no idea -- and no intention of admitting it
(very casually) That's too big
She glints at him, grits through her teeth

She puts the beaker down
Picks up a vial
Flips through her textbook
Her eyes shift from it to the blackboard, trying to make a connection
She settles on one
Picks up a vial of powder
Patrick grabs her hand, leans over and whispers
wouldn't do that if  were you
(yanks her hand back) Who died and made you teacher
Patrick pulls back, looks at her
He can't believe she dissed him
small smile forms on his face
Sara turns away from it, goes back to her vials
Patrick slides to the farthest end of the table
Watches her consternation with bemusement
Know the difference between ethyl glycol and methyl acetate
Both got three elements, two parts the same
It's that first part, C2 versus C3
C3 could blow a vial right out a person's hand
Sara thinks he's messing with her
But then the contents of the beaker begin to ominously bubble
Panicked, she drops the vial into their sink
It instantly goes up in smoke
Some of the liquid splashes on Sara's lab coat
Patrick grabs a wet towel, quickly wipes it off
The class stops cold
Hill rushes up to them
Once he's sure Sara's fine, he looks sternly at Patrick
What happened
Everybody back in your seats
Patrick stares at Sara
Her face is red
She's biting her lip
misread the component
(even more angry now) You
You misread a component
Don't give me that, Patrick
You were screwin' around

He turns to     Sara
She's trying to say something but the words won't    come out
Hill regards her wearily, then walks off    pushing the curious class back to their stations
Sara     looks at Patrick, weakly mouths "thanks

a girl's plump ass
Squirming in too-tight gym shorts that hug the cheeks
to reveal a stout white girl on a balance beam
Trying to get her legs to stand up on it
Hanging on for dear life
From somewhere around her, a
(
) Alright, Ms
Diggs
Time
to see the teacher and her class ( Sara, Chenille, and Nikki)
Amid snickers, the stout girl ("") slides off the beam, walks past the teacher with her head demurely cast down
Clearing the teacher, Diggy pivots around, both middle fingers in the air
Gives up the double bird with much attitude
The class loves it
Cheers it
Until the teacher swerves around
67                                                   67 Chenille on balance beam
competent but average
Nikki on balance beam
Agile
Self-assured
Good
And then   on Sara
Tentatively approaching the balance beam
Mindful of all the eyes on her, all the bated breaths
All waiting to see the new girl fall on her ass
Sara swings herself onto the beam with aplomb
Her legs and body are strong, supple, pliable rubber bands
She flounces across it on her tiptoes
Does a flawless split
Hops off
Looks out

Awed
Except for Nikki
She stands there with her arms folded
Simmering

(wildly gesticulating) Yeah
What was all that double- jointed cheerleader shit
This is Diggy
Thinks she's down
Egg-cuse me
am down
So, Sara
What's up with that
(awkwardly) Nothing's up with it

Snook dee's sometime
He can get you in

then Patrick
loping her way
She steels herself
He's going to say something, crack some joke about her nearly blowing him up
But Patrick just stares at her with a twinkle in his eyes
nice twinkle
Sara's not entirely immune to it
Chenille breaks their eye play, pushes Patrick aside
She grabs Snookie's arm, indicates Sara

All the way up
Sara, give Snook twenty dollars
For what
Eye-dee
How you think you gettin' in
On your looks
(rolling his eyes) Chenille, your girl is weak
Shit
got my rep to watch can't just be gettin' any green in
Sara glares
Regards Snookie with a sweeping scowl
Look closer
And if  still look green,  think maybe you should wipe the crust from your eyes
Snookie's jaw drops
Patrick cracks up
Diggy too
Chenille's stays on point
She's about solving the problem
You gonna pay the man or what
She ain't got it
Look at her
Loud-talkin' me and broke as a damn promise
Sara, put on the spot, pulls out the money
Snookie snatches it
don't even know where it is
So we'll hook up at my house
Go together
will have your
Snookie shrugs affirmatively
Patrick looks directly at Sara
The twinkle in his eye is gone, replaced by fair warning
Feetz ain't no square dance

Chemistry
You're takin' chemistry
Right now it's taking me
Give yourself some time
Well
See ya in the mornin'
Maybe 'll call between sets
Sara really looks up
Gives him an angelic, sluggish shrug
'll be asleep
He leaves
As soon as Sara hears the front  , she jumps up, strips down to bra and panties, races to the closet
One hand rips the rollers from her hair, the other rips through outfits
She's frantic and unsure about choosing the right one

Doesn't meet anyone's eye
But can feel the eyes on her

Sara's surprised -- the apartment is surprisingly quaint and extremely neat
It looks a helluva lot better than Roy's place

Sara takes it in
Cool outfit

Decides to lie

Sara takes off the bolero
Chenille ties it around her own neck, then yanks Sara's miniskirt down around her hips

Chenille releases him, gently smoothes out his shirt
That's how  thought  had it
(a fly wave) See ya
She and Sara continue on to back-of-the-club tables
Stop at a reserved one
An adjacent table sports Nikki, her three girl crew
and Diggy
All nurse drinks
Nikki snake-eyes Sara
What is up with this place
Seems like they're lettin' anybody in
Yeah
And they started with you
The three girls and Diggy snicker
Nikki gives Chenille a look
Turns back to Sara with a snide smirk
Points out her crew
'm Nikki
Alyssa
Jasmin
Tiff'nee
You know Diggy, right, Marsha
Sara
It's Sara
And  know you
We have a class together
That don't mean you know me
Quit it, Nikki
Quit what
ain't walkin' on eggshells just 'cause you brought the Brady Bunch to the Negro Club

'm pretty sure this one doesn't have any Negroes
Chenille cracks up mainly to back Sara up
Nikki glowers at her
'm pretty sure you came with one
Oh, no
Uh-uh, wench
You did not just call me a Negro
As Chenille bucks, Diggy springs up from her seat, runs her arm in the space between Chenille and Nikki like a referee
Alright, y'all
Chill
Tell her to chill
She always got somethin' to say
can say a lot more
Keep runnin' your mouth, Nikki
'll lay all your shit bare
Whatever shit it is, Nikki's not taking any       chances
She ejects herself from the table, walks off
The three girls scoot loyally after her
Diggy gets        up
Sits down at Sara's and Chenille's table
Diggy goes        with the flow
That's why she always fits in
Why you burn her like that
'Cause  can't stand her ass and the way she played my brother need a drink, Sara
Let's walk

-  -                                  79 Patrick and Malakai enter with two high school dropouts we will learn are  and
Females flock to flirt with Patrick and Malakai, who both swell like sponges, soaking up the attention

-  -                                          80 Chenille pushes her way to the bar, tugging Sara along
tall, angular twenty-something  on the far side of the bar sees her
She sees him
Sucks her teeth, nudges Sara
That's him
Comin' over
Kenny
Don't look
So of course Sara does
She makes a silly face at Chenille as Kenny sidles up to her
Chenille rolls her eyes half-heartedly
() What's up
Where's my money, Kenny
'm a little short this week
Don't jump off
It's comin'
It's comin'
No
You lyin'
Lemme rap to you about the situation on the dance floor
She shakes her head firmly but her eyes do tell
She's in love with him
Enough to let him whisper in her ear, sweet-talk her away from the bar
Before she's swallowed up by the crowd, Chenille turns back to Sara, shouts: Rum and Coke
No ice
Hook me up
splitting off from Malakai and a girl clinging to him
He's walking through when Nikki appears from nowhere, grabs his arm
Let's dance
(pulling away) Let's not

80   :                                                        80 Oh
It's gonna be like that
How'd you think it was gonna be
That you was gonna drop me and pick me up whenever you felt like it
It ain't all that serious, Patrick
It ain't anymore, Nikki
Not to me
He walks off
him going deep inside the club
He wants a drink
He's almost at the bar when he sees Chenille on the dance floor with Kenny
She shrugs a smile, then cocks her head over at the bar
Toward Sara
The look is like, help me out
Don't let me leave her hangin'
Patrick rolls his eyes as he glances at Sara, before he really sees her
She looks fly
Hugely fly
He ambles up as she shouts into the bartender's ear
Rum and Coke, straight up
And a beer
don't care
Anything
(
) Bad choice
'Anything
' The closeness of his voice startles her
She turns into his smile
That cocksure, leave'em-weak-in-the-knees smile
It's just a beer
Then it should be the best beer
You'd know that if you really drank
Sara's knees straighten, her spine stiffens
The asshole's back
Whatever
What's that mean
Whatever
() 43
80   :                                                   80 Whatever you want it to mean
You're the whiz kid, right
You know everything
(chuckles at this, at her) Not everything
Like  don't know why we're standin' still
(closer with a teasing whisper) 'm supposed to be dizzy by now
Remember
From all those circles you danced around me
Sara leans against the bar
The knees are going again
don't feel like dancing
But you do know how
Would  be here if  didn't
Let's do it then
'mon
He coaxes her onto the dance floor
' funk classic "Flashlight" is playing
The dance crowd is robustly singing the refrain to the song
There's a party on the floor
Sara and Patrick, facing each other
He's moving already
She starts to dance, stiffly, tentatively
Patrick smiles at her
Shakes his head
He grabs her hands, swings them in time to the music
Now move your hips
Not so fast
(as Sara looks lost) Sara
Just like our hands
(singing, in sync with the crowd) 'Flashlight
Neon light
Stop light
Everybody got a little light under the sun
' The music's beginning to feel good to Sara
Patrick lets go of her hands
Starts to dance
Sara watches him intensely, her body follows his stiffly
Patrick's a good teacher
He leads without leaving her
Whenever she misses a complicated move, he smoothly segues into another less-complicated one
() 44
80   :                                                    80 Sara begins to pick-up on Patrick's rhythm
Her eyes never wander from his
And then she starts to feel something else
They both do
rising beat quickening heart
And not from the dancing
She smiles bashfully at him
Patrick suddenly grabs her around the waist, pulls her to him in a sexy spoon dance
All Sara can do is try to keep up and hang on
Nikki avidly watching Sara and Patrick with Jasmin and Tiff'ny
She's all up in your nut, Nikki
Oh, that's right
It ain't your nut anymore
It is if  want it to be
He is if  want him to be
That bitch ain't got shit on me
The girls regard her in conspicuous, dubious silence
Nikki maintains her cool but inside her pride is pricking
81
-                                          81 Malakai and the clinging girl nuzzle in a back corner
She licks his ear, whispers into it
Malakai laughs
Then his expression abruptly darkens
storm cloud comes over it
He gets up
'  - two dealers a few feet away
They're talking to an Asian guy with a multi-colored Mohawk
One slips Mohawk a packet of coke, the other takes his money
as Malakai reaches the dealers
He doesn't explain, doesn't complain
He just starts swinging
The  changes and their dance ends
They stand there for a moment, a little caught up in each other
little unsure of the moment
And then there's a scream
Several of them actually
Patrick reacts to it instinctively
Looking around
In a small pocket of the club he sees Malakai
() 45
81   :                                                       81 '  - in full fisticuffs with the two dealers
Holding his own
leaving Sara, slicing through a clot of looky-loos until he reaches Malakai
He jumps into the fray
-  - thick crowd around them, proceed to beat the living shit out of the two dealers
wrangling their way to the front line of the crowd, Diggy not far behind them
Sara looks on, dumbfounded and dazzled by what she sees, which is -- pummeling his dealer into cowering submission
Only then does he look over at Malakai who, eyes engorged with rage, is standing over his opponent, kicking and stomping him with no signs of letting up
Patrick can see Malakai's too far gone for talk
He rushes him from behind, nearly lifts Malakai off his feet to swing him away from the dealer's writhing body on the floor
82
-   -                 82 The exit door bursts open and Patrick and Malakai tumble out
Patrick bends over, cups his knees as he catches his breath
Man, what the hell are you doin'
Tryin' to get sent back up
They the ones tryin' shit
Comin' here
Squarin' off in my shit
You couldn't let it slide

You know that
Malakai, you fuck up parole, you ain't gonna back to JuVee
Eighteen and up, that's Jessup
Hardcore lockdown
You want that
(regards him coldly) want what was mine
Feetz is my spot
'ma do business here just like  did before
Like we did before
And if  gotta stomp some niggers in my way, so be it
An uncertain but tense moment
Patrick tries to salvage it
Well, you definitely got the stompin' part down
They look at each other
Share a small laugh
We fucked those fools up for sure
(crossing to exit door) For damn sure, man
Patrick finds the door locked
He and Malakai hoist themselves over a high, wrought iron fence
Disappear behind it
83
-   -                            83 Distant  of  as Feetz begins to empty out
Kids converge on the sidewalks
Sara, Chenille and Diggy
Waiting and watching for Patrick
Diggy looks at them
It's about to get real out here
Cops and shit

She leaves
Chenille spots Patrick
Not too worse for the wear
She smiles with relief
Then Sara sees him
She smiles too

Walking home
Chenille's preaching to Patrick
He's not in the mood
Yeah, 'ma tell you
Tell you like  keep tellin' you, Patrick
You need to let Malakai alone
Let him handle his own shit before he drags you down in it
Chenille
heard you the first five hundred times
They round a corner bordering the Heights
Stop in front of it
Chenille, disconcerted with Patrick, looks dourly at Sara
'll see you Monday
(to Patrick, like an order) He'll walk you
As much as this makes sense, it still takes Patrick by surprise
Sara sees it in his face, regards Chenille with a false bravado
It's just a few blocks
It's okay
No, it's not okay
Would you tell the girl it ain't okay
It's not okay, okay
(before she can protest) Come on, Braveheart

have to look somewhere
The streets are deserted
Might as well look at you
That's not why
You wanna know somethin'
Ask somethin'
It's not a question
It's the way you were beating that kid up
You looked so mad
was mad and he wasn't no kid
But you're from the suburb Mars, right
Folks don't fight there
Not like that
(some kind of wonder) You were really kicking his ass
It's not funny, the look on her face
But Patrick laughs
Are you laughing at me
Dropping the smile, Patrick shakes his head
Looks at her
My friend was in trouble
Maybe he's my question
Your friend
Chenille doesn't like him
She likes him
It don't stop her from trippin' off him now and then
But Malakai's good people
We go back
Way back

Once you got used to the music
It wasn't the music  wasn't used to
mean, it's not the first time  heard hip-hop, Patrick
Uh-huh
Bet you listen to it all the time
Patrick regards her with a sly, knowing smile
His stare is significant, unsettling
Sara's face flushes
She turns from him, hoping he didn't see it
Not all the time
But a lot
We gettin' any closer to your crib or should we stop for food and water
Sara snaps out of it
Looks around
Shit
First the flush and now this
She looks at him
She could kick herself
We passed it
You passed it

They double back to her front door
Pause on the stoop

He makes it impossible not to smile
So damned charming
haven't said gee-whiz since was six

They eat in silence

Nope

Snookie, in sunglasses and a reversed baseball cap, clerks behind the counter

He separates the two girls who are still swinging at each other
He throws one into a corner, hurls the other in an opposite corner
as a   standing next to her shakes her head lamentably
What happened
The White Girl studies Sara's suburban clothes and fresh- scrubbed face
Thinks she found a kindred spirit
( ) We freed the slaves and didn't teach them no manners
(before Sara can react) You're Sara, right
(as Sara warily nods) Toni

You know
Chenille, her girls, that identity crisis Diggy
Sara looks at Toni
Getting it
Getting her
The expression on her face closes off
Toni, too dense to read it, keeps talking
(brightly) We should hang out sometime, Sara
The two of us
Whenever you decide to lose the tan
Her inference clear, Toni flashes a brilliant smile, happily walks off
Sara shakes her head to herself

He goes into a spin, a half-split, comes out of it swaggering and half-stepping around her
Sara gives him an impish look
Rises up on full pointe, turns out her legs and lifts one of them in a spiral just below his head
It happens in two blinks
So fast Patrick thinks it was a mirage
He stares at her, dumbfounded
Sara smiles
The look on his face is worth the pain in her joints
She blows some stray hair out of her face, puts her hands on her hips
Looks appropriately hapless

Why not
Because  don't want to talk about it
That's why you brought it up
Did that whole relieve thing

Because it's not a big deal
Can we just concentrate on this
Yeah, we can concentrate

Malakai backs up
The Girl jumps up, runs out the lavatory
Malakai zips up his pants

You and Malakai
Yep
Most of the time

'Kai's tough
He has to be

Sara stares at the ground, struggling to tell him what she saw
Patrick
Let me finish
Me and him got into some shit awhile back
Real bad shit
We held up a gas station off 95
bailed the ride -- jumped out the car
'Kai kept goin', got caught
(pauses) knew what he was gonna do that night
Knew the car was hot woulda been guilty as him if they had caught me, if Malakai had served my name up
But he didn't
That means you owe him something
He did his time plus most of mine
owe him that
No matter how much he messes up
We all mess up
Maybe Malakai gave up
But he's still m'boy and he still got a chance
ain't just gonna cross him completely off and be like everybody else

got along and shit So she meant something to you
How come you never talk about her
There's nothing to say
(studying her face) Know why there's nothing to say
Because you don't talk about her
You won't talk about her

Patrick  backs up to the sink
Washes his hands
Impishly  dries them on her apron
He sits, begins sifting  through the mail
Momma Dean pulls an envelope from her  pocket
Waves it at him
This what you're lookin' for
Chenille appears in the doorway
Patrick takes the letter
He's almost afraid to open it

Can't find any words
So she just goes into her evening bag and pulls out a small box
She hands it to him, a little nervous about how it will be received
wanted to get you something and couldn't figure out what
It's not much but  hope you like it
Patrick opens the box
Removes a key chain
It's engraved with the medical emblem (snake & staff, etc
)
He regards her, touched
like it
love it
Thank you
Wait
There's more
She leans in, turns the key chain over in his hand
The back side of it is engraved with the words, " ,

Sits across from Sara and Patrick who have moved even closer to each other
Patrick's arm is around Sara's shoulder
He whispers something in Sara's ear
She laughs and looks up to see the white woman staring at them with a muted but obvious repugnance
Watching the woman from the corner of her eye, Sara drapes her arms around Patrick's neck, nuzzles at his ear
Patrick's eyes widen
Sara, playing this for all it's worth, folds one of her legs between his and whispers: We have an audience
Work with me
(nonplussed) Work with you
(sotto voce, through her teeth) Grab something

-- runs his hand along her side

Parking valets hover on the sidewalks waiting for cars
Into this, Sara and Patrick walk
She looks at the crowd, then sees the overhead banner -- "Boston Ballet,  Command Performance

Her feet freeze
Patrick looks at her
She looks positively catatonic

can't go in
(doesn't understand) You have to go in
This is where 'm bringing you
The ballet

Feeling stupid for ruining the evening
She bites her lip, shakes her head ("but nothing")
Patrick takes her and they go in

They're both enraptured
But while Patrick keeps sneaking excited glimpses of Sara, her eyes remain fixed on the dancers, the dance
She is utterly, totally engaged and amazed
The yearning that never really left her returns to tug at her heart and project her soul onto the stage

You ain't actin' like you did
She looks over at him, tries to smile
'm sorry
They come to a small, secluded bridge
Sara sits down on the edge of it
Patrick follows suit
long moment
don't want you to think  didn't have a good time tonight, Patrick
did
But ballet isn't a part of my life anymore
Why not
What happened
You just woke up one day and decided to waste your talent
(without rancor) How do you know  have talent
Because  did some stupid leg trick
saw the look on your face when you did it, Sara
The same look saw tonight
Goofy happy
So if you're gonna tell me somethin' about not dancing, at least tell me somethin' real

Finally, she looks at him
Maybe  don't want it to be real

It's hard to reconcile that beauty and the turmoil she's feeling
But she goes on
What  want is to wake up and see my mom
For things to go back to the way they were
When they made sense
When my life made sense
(because) And it's all my fault
She got scraped off the highway for me, for my fucking audition
She was rushing
It was raining
It was raining
(a torrent) But she promised to be there
made her promise
And then didn't wait for her
should have but they called my name and didn't say anything
just went out and danced
was mad needed her and she wasn't there
She buries her face in her hands, breaking down, racked with tears and guilt
Patrick puts his arms around her
(inconsolable) She was dying while  was dancing and  was mad at her and 'm sorry
'm sorry
It's not your fault it rained or she died
Or that you danced
That's what you were there for
Your mom would've expected you to do what you did
Sara, choking on tears, regards him forlornly
That's what makes it so bad
She always did what was right for me
wanted to be a prima ballerina -- had to be
Even if it took most of our money, all of her spare time
didn't care
It was my stupid dream and it killed her
All she wanted was for it to come true

She wouldn't want you to give up
Sara swipes at her face, looks up at him, still crying
know
but she
just don't think  can do it without her
(holding her) Do you want to do it, Sara mean you
Do you want Juilliard

Neither of them wants the night to end
See you tomorrow

Stares deeply into them

But it doesn't matter
The moment has named itself

closet door

Wiggles them
Nothing magical or mystical but simply wonderful
Gleefully wonderful

(hates to admit this) It hurts
'm out of shape and it hurts
Okay
Satisfied
(admiring her) That's what you call outta shape, what's it take to get you in shape
Practice
This is the perfect spot for that
You can run around and  can sit under the trees and watch you
don't get in shape like that
But it's still a good spot
(diffidently) got my application for Juilliard
Just in time too

Negative shit
White folks call it karma
The bad kind
You don't understand
Ballet takes a lot of time, a lot of preparation
used to practice two, three hours every day
'm so far behind
And unsure and afraid
Which Patrick can sense
But he won't let her go there or stay there
He's firm, matter-of-fact
Quit whinin' and catch up then
It's not as easy as that
My free form still sucks
It's still the weakest part of my routine

Leans in with his drink, openly and contently with her
Nikki and her crew (Jasmin, Tiff'nee, Alyssa)

Sara and Patrick among them
She looks at him nervously
He smiles
Nobody's watchin' you but me
gallant lie
Sara tries    to believe it
They dance
Practice has made her near   perfect
Their movements are ambitious, nimble, better   than anyone else on the floor
They move so well together   that Snookie, dancing nearby, starts chanting: Go, Patrick
Go, Patrick

Snookie, Diggy and others prance around them like backup dancers

Watch me squash their shit

Shoving, pushing, and barging her way up to Patrick
Without preamble or regard for Sara, she starts dancing with him
Patrick looks at Sara but he's somehow dancing with Nikki
Sara retreats with daggers in her eyes

From a curtain of kids, Malakai suddenly appears at her side

Patrick holds her off with both arms
Walks away

He takes her hand
Sara fiercely jerks away
Patrick grabs her hand again, more emphatically this time
But Sara won't budge from the spot where she's standing
So Patrick slides his arms around her, holds her without moving
They remain like this for a moment or two until they slowly begin to dance
We    them in this little space
Patrick's lips brush Sara's ear

Eyes on Sara and Patrick
Both underwhelmed and resentful of what he sees

Somewhere between five seconds and forever

He gets up, follows Sara behind the partition into her "room

He cups her face with his hands
Kisses her
They begin to take off each other's clothes, alternately sure and fumbling; a bit awkward, a bit urgent
Sara unzips Patrick's pants, catches something other than his clothes
Patrick winces in pain
She looks at him with an embarrassed grimace
Says this very low
Sorry

Fall down upon it and begin to make love

'Hit it and quit it,' that's their motto

How am  frontin', 'Kai

You busted

You the one need his jaws tightened with your pork-ass instigatin' self

It's an excuse for some unnecessary mayhem
Ain't nothin' unnecessary 'bout it

Mayhem and madness
That's a black man's life

You ain't tried nothing else
Now you sittin' up here strapped for no good reason

Snookie shifts uncomfortably

Why does he have to leave
We're all adults
Right
He either leaves or  throw his ass out
Your call, Sara
Patrick jerks his arm free from Sara, grabs his jacket off the back of his chair
He back-talks Roy as he passes him

Siddown

Ain't like that's exactly news
But disrespectin' me, that's where the road ends, Sara
don't want him up here again mean it
You mean it because he's black
Don't start that bullshit
Why's it bullshit
Because you hang with black guys and play jazz and have the hots for Angela Bassett
Because he was in my house with his hands all over my daughter
Keep telling yourself that
Just don't expect me to believe it saw how you looked at him
But you didn't see him
Well, for your information, he's a straight- student with more heart and guts than you'll ever have

You were a piece of shit husband and you're a piece of shit father
You were never there for Mom or for me
You took off and never looked back
So don't talk to me about guts
Not quite the truth, but near enough to sting
It quiets Roy down
He regards her with regret and guilt
Sounds like you have it all figured out
have you figured out
You think you can make up all the time you missed, all the things you didn't do
You can't
'm here because have to be and it's a goddamned nightmare
Well, you might as well wake up and get used to it, Sara, because that's the way things are sometimes, the way life is
How the hell would you know
You've been asleep for the past thirty-seven years
Now she does storm off

It clips Nikki's head, bounces out of bounds

Stay down, girl

Roy follows her to the futon
For what
Fighting

He's barely audible
Pretty bad

Nikki clenches, tries to dismiss him with a backhanded wave
Whatever it is,  don't wanna hear it

The walk there has composed his emotions

You thought wrong

Nikki petulantly follows him there

Stuck up in her shit like she's somethin' special
What if she is

) Uh-huh
Patrick glares in the Old Woman's direction, then back at Nikki
thought  was goin' someplace good with you
You the one called me off
But you ain't tryin' to remember that
Now you mad
Why
Because she's white and  like her
'm with her
Please
You're with her because she's white
That's what sets me off
(exasperated) It ain't got no business settin' you off
Me and her ain't got nothin' to do with you and what you think
So keep your hands off her and that shit to yourself
Nikki folds her arms across her chest, looks at him defiantly
don't think it,  know it
But you go ahead, deny it

Chenille's too mad to    see it

It's more than a dollar
And it's all  got

, Chenille
been workin' part- time
Money's tight
You know how you are about money
That's way  haven't been coming around
Chenille stares at him for a long moment
Her voice is low
Money ain't got nothin' to do with it, Kenny
You don't come around because you don't feel like comin' around
You don't want the responsibility of comin' around
As long as you out there and 'm in here, you know your son's being taken care of
You ain't got no worries when it comes to him
And you don't have no   feelings when it comes to me
All you do is bitch and complain   about what don't do
get sick    of that
Be sick of it
You ain't got to see me to see your son
'll be sure to keep that in mind
He leaves

They are piled up like cars on a freeway, waiting to be seen
The noise level is at a peak when Chenille and Sara walk in
Chenille's carrying a fussy Christopher, his diaper bag and her backpack
Sara, wanting to be helpful, reaches for Christopher
Want me to take him
Chenille shakes her head
Walks to reception to sign herself in
Sara takes in the faces of girls younger than herself, the grime and gloom of the room
It's incomprehensible that this is a place where sick children are brought to get well
Chenille finishes at the desk
Returns to Sara
They cross to a corner of the clinic where they sit -- on the floor
Chenille indicates the receptionist bitterly
That wench
You gotta stand over her to make sure she puts your name on the damn list
Triflin' bitch
Chenille starts to change Christopher's diaper
He starts to wail and flail
Chenille can't placate him
One of his kicks connects with Chenille's open backpack, sends books and papers flying
Sara can see the veins stand up on Chenille's neck
'll get 'em
She does
Chenille's finally got control of Christopher but he's still crying
Chenille slips off his dirty diaper
When Sara hands her a clean one, Chenille regards her strangely, as if just remembering that she's there
So your old man flipped about the fight
(with some animus) Probably thinks it's all Patrick's fault
No
explained about Nikki
Right
You put it all on her
None of it's on you

She wanted to start it
told you what she said
Chenille flashes a look, finishes up with Christopher
She picks him up, puts a bottle in his mouth
Cradles him
Maybe she didn't have no business gettin' in your face
But she had a reason to say what she said
reason
Sara studies her, trying to fathom the remark
So you agree with her
You think don't belong with Patrick
What  think don't matter
But you and him act like it don't bother people that you're together
Like it don't hurt people to see
(her Irish up) We like each other

He's smart
He's motivated
He's for real
He ain't gonna make no babies and not take care of 'em or run the streets, fuck up his life
He's gonna do somethin' with himself

So what you gonna do
How many times you gonna ask me that
It's payback time
Either you down or you ain't

Simple as that
Patrick takes a long moment
The choice is simple

Snookie rebuffs him, keeps talking to Patrick
Me and Sara lit it up

Sara and Patrick exchange smiles
Malakai isn't amused
He flattens Snookie's ass with the business end of his foot
Snookie sprawls flat on his face to the floor
Now Malakai's amused
Sara looks at Patrick
Patrick scowls at Malakai
That shit ain't funny
(springing up) Damn right it ain't funny
thought you liked it down there
That's your specialty, ain't it
Crawling
That was a reflex action, man
And you just plain rude and wrong to bring the shit up in mixed company
Sara's not quite sure what they're alluding to but she doesn't want the displeasure of Malakai's company
She taps Patrick
gotta get home
Ready
Malakai's eyes slice into her
First Snookie, now this bitch
Steppin' all over his conversation with Patrick
No, he ain't ready
He's talkin'
To me
- conversation
Gotta go
yourself the fuck home
(a real reflex action) Fuck you
Malakai lunges for her
The move is so swift and sudden Patrick overturns his stool to dive between them
He sweeps Sara behind him, into the path of a startled Snookie
Stands there nose-to-nose with Malakai, staring him down, furious with him
Have you lost your motherfuckin' , man
Huh
Have you
Sara, frightened and frozen, doesn't know what to do
Snookie's voice weakly creaks out
He's trying to rise to the occasion
Patrick, man, c'mon
But Malakai and Patrick stay where they stand
Too close for comfort
Both in the danger zone
Malakai regards Patrick with a combination of cruel anger and deep, genuine hurt
You take that bitch's back and won't even cover mine
'Cause you wrong, Malakai
No
You wrong
You  wrong
You ain't worth shit no more
(venomously) Get out my face, and take that ho with you
Patrick bucks up
Sara walks over to him, gently clutches his sleeve
It's no easier to turn away from Malakai than it is to walk away from a lifetime of friendship
But Patrick does
With Sara holding onto his arm, at his side, he turns and walks away

She looks at him
and loves him
and doesn't know what to do
'm just saying that we should think about this, that's all
That's a fuckin' 'nough
Why are you getting mad
Because  like to think for myself, run my own life, and thought you did too
Sara looks at him
Now she's getting mad
You're never gonna run your own life as long as you keep running back to Malakai every time he fucks up or fucks you over
She's crossed the line
But Patrick responds so deliberately, so calmly prosaic, that she doesn't immediately realize it
First of all, Malakai ain't never fucked me over
Second of all, you don't know him, Sara, what he been through
Matter of fact, you don't know shit about none of it
So don't come off to me like you do

Everybody but you can see that
And if you keep reaching back for him, you're gonna wind up lost too

Who the fuck are you to say he's lost
Malakai had my back when you were busy gee-whizzin' in the woods with your backward-ass, redneck friends

He hands her an audio cassette of her free form music
Sara gazes at it, then up at him, understanding what this means
She won't let him see how it shatters her
He hesitates, as if he wants to say something else
But Sara turns her back on him and Patrick walks away
- approaching Sara's locker
Having seen the encounter between Patrick and Sara, she's as smug and overbearing as ever
Lovers' quarrel
You're better off
That menace to society would've broken your heart and spent all your money in a news flash
Trust me on that, Sara
Sara stares at her, uncomprehending at first
She resists the urge to slap the smile off Toni's face
She gets in it instead
Toni, listen carefully
You're a simple bitch and you don't have any friends, black or white, because nobody likes a fucking asshole

To be in love with your mother

Collects herself
You want him there

But whatever he brings to the table, Patrick can't dance for you, Sara

Arvel's father, stoic, holds his wife's hand
Arvel's mother kneads a Kleenex, her face etched with tears
Patrick hugs her
Stands up to see Malakai frozen in the doorway, put off by the palpable grief
Patrick crosses over to him
They retreat quietly into the corridor, their concern for Arvel a shaky ground for conciliation
Why his mom's cryin' like that
Arvel's gonna make it, right
That what's his nurse said
She told me herself, 'Your friend's gonna make it
' Did that bitch lie to me
Talk to me, Patrick
Is he gone
Patrick steers Malakai away from the waiting room, backs him against a wall and, in a gentle but firm way, holds him there
They just got bad news, man
They don't need to hear it again

He's gonna pull through
Thing is, when he does, they don't think
he ain't

Arvel ain't gonna walk again
In that moment, whatever's left of Malakai's soul crumbles
