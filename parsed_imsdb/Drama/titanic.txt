a screenplay by James Cameron 1 Then two faint lights appear, close together
growing brighter
They resolve into two  , free-falling toward us like express elevators
One is ahead of the other, and passes close enough to  , looking like a spacecraft blazing with lights, bristling with insectile manipulators
to follow it as it descends away into the limitless blackness below
Soon they are fireflies, then stars
Then gone

singing softly in Russian
Next to him on one side is
He's in his late forties, deeply tanned, and likes to wear his Nomex suit unzipped to show the gold from famous shipwrecks covering his gray chest hair
He is a wiley, fast-talking treasure hunter, a salvage superstar who is part historian, part adventurer and part vacuum cleaner salesman
Right now, he is propped against the CO2 scrubber, fast asleep and snoring
On the other side, crammed into the remaining space is a bearded wide-body named  , sho is also asleep
Lewis is an

Anatoly glances at the bottom sonar and makes a ballast adjustment

It hits bottom after its two hour free-fall with a loud

Bodine is watching the sidescan sonar display, where the outline of a huge pointed object is visible
Anatoly lies prone, driving the sub, his face pressed to the center port
Come left a little
She's right in front of us, eighteen meters

Thirteen
you should see it
Do you see it
don't see it
there
Out of the darkness, like a ghostly apparition, the bow of the ship appears
Its knife-edge prow is coming straight at us, seeming to plow the bottom sediment like ocean waves
It towers above the seafloor, standing just as it landed 84 years ago
Or what is left of her
Mir One goes up and over the bow railing, intact except for an overgrowth of "rusticles" draping it like mutated Spanish moss

Brock Lovett's face fills the
It still gets me every time
The image pans to the front viewport, looking over Anatoly's shoulder, to the bow railing visible in the lights beyond
Anatoly turns
Is just your guilt because of estealing from the dead
, to show that Brock is operating the camera himself, turning it in his hand so it points at his own face
Thanks, Tolya
Work with me, here
Brock resumes his serious, pensive gaze out the front port, with the camera aimed at himself at arm's length
It still gets me every time
to see the sad ruin of the great ship sitting here, where she landed at 2:30 in the morning, April 15, 1912, after her long fall from the world above
Anatoly rolls his eyes and mutters in Russian
Bodine chuckles and watches the sonar
You are so full of shit, boss
7 Mir Two drives aft down the starboard side, past the huge anchor while Mir One passes over the seemingly endless forecastle deck, with its massive anchor chains still laid out in two neat rows, its bronze windlass caps gleaming
The 22 foot long subs are like white bugs next to the enormous wreck
(
) Dive nine
Here we are again on the deck of Titanic
two and a half miles down
The pressure is three tons per square inch, enough to crush us like a freight train going over an ant if our hull fails
These windows are nine inches thick and if they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds
8 Mir Two lands on the boat deck, next to the ruins of the Officer's Quarters
Mir One lands on the roof of the deck hous nearby

Snoop Dog goes down several decks, then moves laterally into the First Class Reception Room
'  , moving through the cavernous interior
The remains of the ornate handcarved woodwork which gave the ship its elegance move through the floodlights, the lines blurred by slow dissolution and descending rusticle formations
Stalactites of rust hang down so that at times it looks like a natural grotto, then the scene shifts and the lines of a ghostly undersea mansion can be seen again
, as Snoop passes the ghostly images of Titanic's opulence: 10  grand piano in amazingly good shape, crashed on its side against a wall
The keys gleam black and white in the lights
11  chandelier, still hanging from the ceiling by its wire
glinting as Snoop moves around it
12 Its lights play across the floor, revealing a champagne bottle, then some    china
a woman's high-top "granny shoe"
Then something eerie: what looks like a child's skull resolves into the porcelain head of a doll
Snoop enters a corridor which is much better preserved
Here and there a door still hangs on its rusted hinges
An ornate piece of molding, a wall sconce
hint at the grandeur of the past

Heading for bedroom -54

Don't stir it up like you did yesterday

Glinting in the lights are the brass fixtures of the near-perfectly preserved fireplace
An albino Galathea crab crawls over it
Nearby are the remains of a divan and a writing desk
The Dog crosses the ruins of the once elegant room toward another
It squeezes through the doorframe, scraping rust and wood chunks loose on both sides
It moves out of a cloud of rust and keeps on going

The remains of a pillared canopy bed
Broken chairs, a dresser
Through the collapsed wall of the bathroom, the porcelain commode and bathtub took almost new, gleaming in the dark
Okay,  want to see what's under that wardrobe door
as the  deploys its   and starts moving debris aside
lamp is lifted, its ceramic colors as bright as they were in 1912
Easy, Lewis
Take it slow
Lewis grips a wardrobe door, lying at an angle in a corner, and pulls it with Snoop's gripper
It moves reluctantly in a cloud of silt
Under it is a dark object
The silt clears and Snoop's cameras show them what was under the door
Ooohh daddy-oh, are you seein' what 'm seein'

By his expression it is like he is seeing the Holy Grail
Oh baby baby baby

There is also a documentary video crew, hired by Lovett to cover his moment of glory
Everyone crowds around the safe
In the background Mir Two is being lowered into its cradle on deck by a massive hydraulic arm
Mir One is already recovered with Lewis Bodine following Brock Lovett as he bounds over to the safe like a kid on Christman morning
Who's the best
Say it
You are, Lewis
(to the video crew) You rolling
Rolling
Brock nods to his technicians, and they set about drilling the safe's hinges
During this operation, Brock amps the suspense, working the lens to fill the time
Well, here it is, the moment of truth
Here's where we find out if the time, the sweat, the money spent to charter this ship and these subs, to come out here to the middle of the North Atlantic
were worth it
If what we think is in that same
is in that safe
it will be
Lovett grins wolfishly in anticipation of his greatest find yet
The door is pried loose
It clangs onto the deck
Lovett moves closer, peering into the safe's wet interior
long moment then
his face says it all
Shit
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered
(to the video cameraman) Get that outta my face

,   - Technicians are carefully removing some papers from the safe and placing them in a tray of water to separate them safely
Nearby, other artifacts from the stateroom are being washed and preserved
Buell is on the satellite phone with the
Lovett is yelling at the video crew
You send out what  tell you when  tell you
'm signing your paychecks, not 60 minutes
Now get set up for the uplink
Buell covers the phone and turns to Lovett
The partners want to know how it's going
How it's going
It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think
Lovett grabs the phone from Buell and goes instantly smooth
Hi, Dave
Barry
Look, it wasn't in the safe
no, look, don't worry about it, there're still plenty of places it could be
in the floor debris in the suite, in the mother's room, in the purser's safe on  deck
(seeing something) Hang on a second
tech coaxes some letters in the water tray to one side with a tong
revealing a pencil (conte crayon) drawing of a woman
Brock looks closely at the drawing, which is in excellent shape, though its edges have partially disintegrated
The woman is beautiful, and beautifully rendered
In her late teens or early twenties, she is nude, though posed with a kind of casual modesty
She is on an Empire divan, in a pool of light that seems to radiate outward from her eyes
Scrawled in the lower right corner is the date: April 14 1912
And the initials
The girl is not entirely nude
At her throat is a diamond necklace with one large stone hanging in the center
Lovett grabs a reference photo from the clutter on the lab table
It is a period black-and-white photo of a diamond necklace on a black velvet jeller's display stand
He holds it next to the drawing
It is clearly the same piece
a complex setting with a massive central stone which is almost heart-shaped
'll be God damned
: 16 : a live satellite feed from the deck of the Keldysh, intercut with the  studio
Treasure hunter Brock Lovett is best known for finding Spanish gold in sunken galleons in the Caribbean
Now he is using deep submergence technology to work two and a half miles down at another famous wreck
the Titanic
He is with us live via satellite from a Russian research ship in the middle of the Atlantic
hello Brock
Yes, hi, Tracy
You know, Titanic is not just  shipwrick, Titanic is shipwreck
It's the Mount Everest of shipwrecks

It is full of ceramics, figurines, folk art, the walls crammed with drawings and paintings
things collected over a lifetime
to show a glassed-in studio attached to the house
Outside it is a quiet morning in Ojai, California
In the studio, amid incredible clutter, an   is throwing a pot on a potter's wheel
The liquid red clay covers her hands
hands that are gnarled and age-spotted, but still surprisingly strong and supple

(
) 've planned this expedition for three years, and we're out here recovering some amazing things
things that will have enormous historical and educational value
(
) But it's no secret that education is not your main purpose
You're a treasure hunter
So what is the treasure you're hunting
(
) 'd rather show you than tell you, and we think we're very close to doing just that
The old woman's name is
Her face is a wrinkled mass, her body shapeless and shrunken under a one-piece African-print dress
But her eyes are just as bright and alive as those of a young girl
Rose gets up and walks into the living room, wiping pottery clay from her hands with a rag
Pomeranian dog gets up and comes in with her
The younger soman,  , rushes to help her
Turn that up please, dear

) Your expedition is at the center of a storm of controversy over salvage rights and even ethics
Many are calling you a grave robber
Nobody called the recovery of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb grave robbing

Look at this drawing, which was found today
The video camera pans off Brock to the drawing, in a tray of water
The image of the woman with the necklace
a piece of paper that's been underwater for 84 years
and my team are able to preserve it intanct
Should this have remained unseen at the bottom of the ocean for eternity, when we can see it and enjoy it now

- The Mir subs are being launched
Mir Two is already in the water, and Lovett is getting ready to climb into Mir One when Bobby Buell runs up to him
There's a satellite call for you
Bobby, we're launching
See these submersibles here, going in the water
Take a message
No, trust me, you want to take this call

The call is from Rose and we see both ends of the conversation
She is in her kitchen with a mystified Lizzy
This is Brock Lovett
What can  do for you, Mrs
Rose Calvert
Mrs
Calvert
was just wondering if you had found the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr
Lovett
Brock almost drops the phone
Bobby sees his shocked expression
told you you wanted to take this call
(to Rose) Alright
You have my attention, Rose
Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is
Oh yes
The woman in the picture is me

180 degrees as it roars past
There is no land at either horizon
The Keldysh is visible in the distance

Rose's face is visible, looking out calmly

- Brock and Bodine are watching Mir 2 being sweng over the side to start a dive
She's a goddamned liar
nutcase
Like that
what's her name
That Anastasia babe
They're inbound
Brock nods and the three of them head forward to meet the approaching helo
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic
At the age of 17
If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now
hundred and one next month
Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar
traced her as far back as the 20's
she was working as an actress in
An actress
Her name was Rose Dawson
Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids
Now Calvert's dead, and from what 've heard Cedar Rapids is dead
The Sea Stallion approaches the ship, , forcing Brock to yell over the rotors
And everyobody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead
or on this ship
But she knows about it
And  want to hear what she has to say
Got it

Lovett, Buell and Bodine watch as the    hands out about ten suitcases, and then Rose is lowered to the deck in a wheelchair by Keldysh crewmen
Lizzy, ducking unnecessarily under the rotor, follows her out, carrying  the Pomeranian
The crew chief hands a puzzled Keldysh crewmember a goldfish bowl with several fish in it
Rose does not travel light
the incongruous image of this little old lady, looking impossibly fragile amongst all the high tech gear, grungy deck crew and gigantic equipment
'cuse me,  have to go check our supply of Depends

'  /  - Lizzy is unpacking Rose's things in the small utilitarian room
Rose is placing a number of   on the bureau, arranging them carefully next to the fishbowl
Brock and Bodine are in the doorway
Is your stateroom alright
Yes
Very nice
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy
She takes care of me
Yes
We met just a few minutes ago, grandma
Remember, up on deck
Oh, yes
Brock glances at Bodine
oh oh
Bodine rolls his eyes
Rose finishes arranging her photographs
We get a general glimpse of them: the usual snapshots
children and grandchildren, her late husband
There, that's nice
have to have my pictures when  travel
And Freddy of course
(to the Pomeranian) Isn't that right, sweetie
Would you like anything
should like to see my drawing

, Rose looks at the drawing in its tray of water, confronting herself across a span of 84 years
Until they can figure out the best way to preserve it, they have to keep it immersed
It sways and ripples, almost as if alive
Rose's ancient eyes, gazing at the drawing
25  of a man's hand, holding a conte crayon deftly creating a shoulder and the shape of her hair with two efficient lines
26  '    , dancing under the water
27   of a man's eyes, just visible over the top of a sketching pad
They look up suddenly right into the
Soft eyes, but fearlessly direct
28 Rose smiles, remembering
Brock has the reference photo of the necklace in his hand
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up
The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too
recut into a heart-like shape
and it became Le Coeur de la Mer
The Heart of the Ocean
Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond
It was a dreadful, heavy thing
(she points at the drawing) only wore it this once
You actually believe this is you, grandma
It is me, dear
Wasn't  a hot number
tracked it down through insurance records
and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy
Do you know who the claiment was, Rost
Someone named Hockley,  should imagine
Nathan Hockley, right
Pittsburgh steel tycoon
For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee
you
a week before he sailed on Titanic
And the claim was filed right after the sinking
So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship
(to Lizzy) See the date
April 14, 1912
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank
() (') (to Rose) And that makes you my new best friend
will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery
don't want your money, Mr
Lovett
know how hard it is for people who care greatly for money to give some away
(skeptical) You don't want anything
(indicating the drawing) You may give me this, if anything  tell you is of value
Deal
(crossing the room) Over here are a few things we've recovered from your staterooms
Laid out on a worktable are fifty or so objects, from mundane to valuable
Rose, shrunken in her chair, can barely see over the table top
With a trembling hand she lifts a tortoise shell hand mirror, inlaid with mother of pearl
She caresses it wonderingly
This was mine
How extraordinary
It looks the same as the last time  saw it
She turns the mirror over and looks at her ancient face in the cracked glass
The reflection has changed a bit
She spies something else, a silver and moonstone art-nouveau brooch
My mother's brooch
She wanted to go back for it
Caused quite a fuss
Rose picks up an ornate art-nouveau
jade butterfly takes flight on the ebony handle of the comb
She turns it slowly, remembering
We can see that Rose is experiencing a rush of images and emotions that have lain dormant for eight decades as she handles the butterfly comb
Are you ready to go back to Titanic

/ It is a darkened room lined with  monitors
fill the screens, fed from Mir One and Two, and the two ROVs, Snoop Dog and
Live from 12,000 feet
stares raptly at the screens
She is enthraled by one in particular, an image of the bow railing
It obviously means something to her
Brock is studying her reactions carefully
The bow's struck in the bottom like an axe, from the impact
Here
can run a simulation we worked up on this monitor over here
Lizzy turns the chair so Rose can see the screen of Bodine's computer
As he is calling up the file, he keeps talking
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic
Okay, here
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis
No, no
It's fine
'm curious
Bodine starts a    on the screen, which parallels his rapid-fire narration
She hits the berg on the starboard side and it sort of bumps along
punching holes like a morse code
dit dit dit, down the side
Now she's flooding in the (cont'd) forward compartments
and the water spills over the tops of the bulkheads, going aft
As her bow is going down, her stern is coming up
slow at first
and then faster and faster until it's lifting all that weight, maybe 20 or 30 thousand tons
out of the water and the hull can't deal
so
(making a sound in time with the animation) it splits
Right down to the keel, which acts like a big hinge
Now the bow swings down and the stern falls back level
but the weight of the bow pulls the stern up vertical, and then the bow section detaches, heading for the bottom
The stern bobs like a cork, floods and goes under about 2:20 a
m
Two hours and forty minutes after the collision
The animation then follows the bow section as it sinks
Rose watches this clinical dissection of the disaster without emotion
The bow pulls out of its dive and planes away, almost a half a mile, before it hits the bottom going maybe 12 miles an hour
The bow impacts, digging deeply into the bottom, the animation now follows the stern
The stern implodes as it sinks, from the pressure, and rips apart from the force of the current as it falls, landing like a big pile of junk
(indicating the simulation) Cool huh
Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr
Bodine
Of course the experience of it was somewhat less clinical
Will you share it with us
Her eyes go back to the screens, showing the sad ruins far below them
from one of the subs   over the boat deck
Rose recognizes one of the Wellin davits, still in place
She hears ghostly waltz music
The faint and echoing sound of an officer's voice, English accented, calling "Women and children only"
30   of screaming faces in a running crowd
Pandemonium and terror
People crying, praying, kneeling on the deck
Just impressions
flashes in the dark
31 Rose Looks at another monitor
moving down a rusted, debris-filled corridor
Rose watches the endless row of doorways sliding past, like dark mouths
32    , three years old, standing ankle deep in water in the middle of an endless corridor
The child is lost alone, crying
33 Rose is shaken by the flood of memories and emotions
Her eyes well up and she puts her head down, sobbing quietly
(taking the wheelchair) 'm taking her to rest
No
Her voice is surprisingly strong
The sweet little old lady is gone, replaced by a woman with eyes of steel
Lovett signals everyone to stay quiet
Tell us, Rose
She looks from screen to screen, the images of the ruined ship
It's been 84 years
Just tell us what you can-- (holds up her hand for silence) It's been 84 years
and  can still smell the fresh paint
The china had never been used
The sheets had never been slept in

Crewmen move across the deck, dwarfed by the awesome scale of the steamer
Southanmpton, England, April 10, 1912
It is almost nnon on ailing day crowd of hundreds blackens the pier next to Titanic like ants on a jelly sandwich
a gorgeous burgundy    swings into frame, hanging from a loading crane
It is lowered toward  #2
On the pier horsedrawn vehicles, motorcars and lorries move slowly through the dense throng
The atmosphere is one of excitement and general giddiness
People embrace in tearful farewells, or wave and shout bon voyage wishes to friends and relatives on the decks above

Around the handsome cars people are streaming to board the ship, jostling with hustling seamen and stokers, porters, and barking    officials
The Renault stops and the   scurries to open the door for a dressed in a stunning white and purple outfit, with an enormous feathered hat
She is 17 years old and beautiful, regal of bearing, with piercing eyes
It is the girl in the drawing
She looks up at the ship, taking it in with cool appraisal

It doesn't look any bigger than the Mauretania
opens the door on the other side of the car for , the 30 year old heir to the elder Hockley's fortune
"Cal" is handsome, arrogant and rich beyond meaning
You can be blase about some things, Rose, but not about Titanic
It's over a hundred feet longer than Mauretania, and far more luxurious
It has squash courts, a Parisian cafe
even Turkish baths
Cal turns and fives his hand to Rose's mother,   , who descends from the touring car being him
Ruth is a 40ish society empress, from one of the most prominent Philadelphia families
She is a widow, and rules her household with iron will
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth
(indicating a puddle) Mind your step
(gazing at the leviathan) So this is the ship they say is unsinkable
It is unsinkable
God himself couldn't sink this ship
Cal speaks with the pride of a host providing a special experience
This entire entourage of rich Americans is impeccably turned out, a quintessential example of the Edwardian upper class, complete with servants
Cal's ,  , is a tall and impassive, dour as an undertaker
Behind him emerge  , personal servants to Ruth and Rose
scurries toward them, harried by last minute loading
Sir, you'll have to check your baggage through the main terminal, round that way-- Cal nonchalantly hands the man a fiver
The porter's eyes dilate
Five pounds was a monster tip in those days
put my faith in you, good sir
() (') (curtly, indicating Lovejoy) See my man
Yes, sir
My pleasure, sir
Cal never tires of the effect of money on the unwashed masses
(to the porter) These trunks here, and 12 more in the Daimler
We'll have all this lot up in the rooms
The White Star man looks stricken when he sees the enormous pile of steamer trunks and suitcases loading down the second car, including wooden crates and steel safe
He whistles frantically for some cargo-handlers nearby who come running
Cal breezes on, leaving the minions to scramble
He quickly checks his pocket watch
We'd better hurry
This way, ladies
He indicates the way toward the first class gangway
They move into the crowd
, Rose's maid, hustles behind them, laden with bags of her mistress's most recent purchases
things too delicate for the baggage handlers
Cal leads, weaving between vehicles and handcarts, hurrying passengers (mostly second class and steerage) and well-wishers
Most of the first class passengers are avoiding the smelly press of the dockside crowd by using an elevated boarding bridge, twenty feet above
They pass a line of steerage passengers in their coarse wool and tweeds, queued up inside movable barriers like cattle in a chute examines their heads one by one, checking scalp and eyelashes for lice
They pass a well-dressed young man cranking the handle of a wooden Biograph "cinematograph" camera mounted on a tripod
(whose father founded the Biograph Film Studio) is filming his young bride in front of the Titanic
stands stiffly and smiles, self conscious
Look up at the ship, darling, that's it
You're amazed
You can't believe how big it is
Like a mountain
That's great
Mary Marvin, without an acting fiber in her body, does a bad Clara Bow pantomime of awe, hands raised
Cal is jostled by two yelling steerage boys who shove past him
And he is bumped again a second later by the boys' father
Steady
Sorry squire
The Cockney father pushes on, after his kids, shouting
Steerage swine
Apparently missed his annual bath
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family
All part of my charm, Ruth
At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late
You told me to change
couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea
It's bad luck
felt like black
Cal guides them out of the path of a horse-drawn wagon loaded down with two tons of  , in wooden cases, for Titanic's Victualling Department
Here 've pulled every string  could to book us on the grandest ship in history, in her most luxurious suites
and you act as if you're going to your execution
Rose looks up as the hull of Titanic looms over them
a great iron wall, Bible black and sever
Cal motions her forward, and she enters the gangway to the  Deck doors with a sense of overwhelming dread
(
) It was the ship of dreams
to everyone else
To me it was a slave ship, taking me back to America in chains

He escorts her up the gangway and the black hull of Titanic swallows them

The steamer's whistle echoes across Southampton

It is crowded with dockworkers and ship;s crew
Just inside the window, a poker game is in progress
, in working class clothes, play a very serious hand
and   , both about 20, exchange a glance as the other two players argue in Swedish
Jack is American, a lanky drifter with his hair a little long for the standards of the times
He is also unshaven, and his clothes are rumpled from sleeping in them
He is an artist, and has adopted the bohemian style of art scene in Paris
He is also very self-possessed and sure-footed for 20, having lived on his own since 15
The   continue their sullen argument, in Swedish

can't believe you bet our tickets
(subtitled) You lost our money
'm just trying to get it back
Now shutup and take a card
(jaunty) Hit me again, Sven
Jack takes the card and slips it into his hand

They betray nothing

Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo-- Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time
He slaps a full house down on the table
(grinning) 'Cause you're goin' to America
Full house boys
Porca Madonna
The table explodes into shouting in several languages
Jack rakes in the money and the tickets
(to the Swedes) Sorry boys
Three of a kind and a pair
'm high and you're dry and
(to Fabrizio) we're going to-- / '
Olaf balls up one huge farmer's fist
We think he's going to clobber Jack, but he swings round and punches Sven, who flops backward onto the floor and sits there, looking depressed
Olaf forgets about Jack and Fabrizio, who are dancing around, and goes into a rapid harangue of his stupid cousin
Jack kisses the tickets, then jumps on Fabrizio's back and rides him around the pub
It's like they won the lottery
Goin' home
to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot-dogs
On the
We're ridin' in high style now
We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio
You see
Is my destinio
Like  told you
go to l'America
To be a millionaire
() (') (to pubkeeper) Capito
go to America
No, mate
Titanic go to America
In five minutes
Shit
Come on, Fabri
(grabbing their stuff) Come on
(to all, grinning) It's been grand
They run for the door
'Course 'm sure if they knew it was you lot comin', they'd be pleased to wait
: 37 38
- Jack and Fabrizio, carrying everything they own in the world in the kit bags on their shoulders, sprint toward the pier
They tear through milling crowds next to the terminal
Shouts go up behind them as they jostle slow-moving gentlemen
They dodge piles of luggage, and weave through groups of people
They burst out onto the pier and Jack comes to a dead stop
staring at the cast wall of the ship's hull, towering seven stories above the wharf and over an eighth of a mile long
The Titanic is monstrous
Fabrizio runs back and grabs Jack, and they sprint toward the third class gangway aft, at  deck
They reach the bottom of the ramp just as detaches it at the top
It starts to swing down from the gangway doors
Wait
We're passengers
Flushed and panting, he waves the tickets
Have you been through the inspection queue
(lying cheerfully) Of course
Anyway, we don't have lice, we're Americans
(glances at Fabrizio) Both of us
(testy) Right, come aboard
Moody has   reattach the gangway
Jack and Fabrizio come aboard
Moody glances at the tickets, then passes Jack and Fabrizio through to Rowe
Rowe looks at the names on the tickets to enter them in the passenger list
Gundersen
And
(reading Fabrizio's) Gundersen
He hands the tickets back, eyeing Fabrizio's Mediterranean looks suspiciously
(grabbing Fabrizio's arm) Come on, Sven
Jack and Fabrizio whoop with victory as they run down the white-painted corridero
grinning from ear to ear
We are the luckiest sons of bitches in the world

- The mooring lines, as big around as a man's arm, are dropped into the water
cheer goes up on the pier as   pull the Titanic away from the quay
: 41
/   - burst through a door onto the aft well deck as they run across the deck and up the steel stairs to the poop deck
They get to the rail and Jack starts to yell and wave to the crowd on the dock
You know somebody
Of course not
That's not the point
(to the crowd) Goodbye
Goodbye
'll miss you
Grinning, Fabrixio joins in, adding his voice to the swell of voices, feeling the exhilaration of the moment
Goodbye
will never forget you
: 42 - The crowd of cheering well-wishers waves heartily as a black wall of metal moves past them
Impossibly tiny figues wave back from the ship's rails
Titanic gathers speed

The bow wave spreads before the mighty plow of the liner's hull as it moves down the River Test toward the English Channel
: 45
/ -  - Jack and Fabrizio walk down a narrow corridor with doors lining both sides like a college dorm
Total confusion as people argue over luggage in several languages, or wander in confusion in the labyrinth
They pass emigrants studying the signs over the doors, and looking up the words in phrase books
They find their berth
It is a modest cubicle, painted enamel white, with four bunks
Exposed pipes overhead
The other two guys are already there
and
Jack throws his kit on one open bunk, while Fabrizio takes the other
(in Swedish/ subtitled) Where is Sven

-52-56 - By contrast, the so-called "Millionaire Suite" is in the Empire style, and comprises two bedrooms, a bath, , wardrobe room, and a large sitting room
In addition there is a private 50 foot promenade deck outside
room service waiter pours champagne into a tulip glass of orange juice and hands the Bucks Fizz to Rose
She is looking through her new paintings
There is a Monet of water lilies, a Degas of dancers, and a few abstract works
They are all unknown paintings
lost works
Cal is out on the covered deck, which has potted trees and vines on trellises, talking through the doorway to Rose in the sitting room
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money
(looking at a cubist portrait) You're wrong
They're fascinating
Like in a dream
there's truth without logic
What's his name again
(reading off the canvas) Picasso
(coming into the sitting room) He'll never amount to a thing, trust me
At least they were cheap
porter wheels Cal's private safe (which we recognize) into the room on a handtruck
Put that in the wardrobe
47    Rose enters with the large Degas of the dancers
She sets it on the dresser, near the canopy bed
Trudy is already in there, hanging up some of Rose's clothes
It smells so brand new
Like they built it all just for us
mean
just to think that tonight, when  crawl between the sheets, Iill be the first-- Cal appears in the doorway of the bedroom
(looking at Rose) And when  crawl between the sheets tonight, 'll still be the first
(blushing at the innuendo) 'cuse me, Miss
She edges around Cal and makes a quick exit
Cal comes up behind Rose and puts his hands on her shoulders
An act of possession, not intimacy
The first and only
Forever
Rose's expression shows how bleak a prospect this is for her, now

,  - Titanic stands silhouetted against a purple post-sunset sky
She is lit up like a floating palace, and her thousand portholes reflect in the calm harbor waters
The 150 foot tender Nomadic lies-to alongside, looking like a rowboat
The lights of a Cherbourg harbor complete the postcard image
: 49
/ - Entering the first class reception room from the tender are a number of prominent passengers
-  in an enormous feathered hat comes up the gangway, carrying a suitcase in each hand, a spindly porter running to catch up with her to take the bags
Well,  wasn't about to wait all day for you, sonny
Take 'em the rest of the way if you think you can manage
(
) At Cherbourg a woman came aboard named Margaret Brown, but we all called her Molly
History would call her the Unsinkable Molly Brown
Her husband had struck gold someplace out west, and she was what mother called "new money"
At 45,   is a tough talking straightshooter who dresses in the finery of her genteel peers but will never be one of them

) By the next afternoon we had made our final stop and we were steaming west from the coast of Ireland, with nothing out ahead of us but ocean

Jack leans over, looking down fifty feet to where the prow cuts the surface like a knife, sending up two glassy sheets of water

-    - ,   turns from the binnacle to Take her to sea Mister Murdoch
Let's stretch her legs
Murdoch moves the engine telegraph lever to
53   a kind of musical/visual setpiece
an ode to the great ship
The music is rhythmic, surging forward, with a soaring melody that addresses the majesty and optimism of the ship of dreams
the telegraph clangs and moves to "All Ahead Full"
All ahead full
On the catwalk  , the shipbuilder, watches carefully as the engineers and greasers scramble to adjust valves
Towering above them are the twin  engines, four stories tall, their ten-foot-long connecting rods surging up and down with the turning of the massive crankshafts
The engines thunder like the footfalls of marching giants
54     the  chant a song as they hurl coal into the roaring furnaces
The "black gang" are covered with sweat and coal dust, their muscles working like part of the machinery as they toil in the hellish glow
55  the enormous bronze screws chop through the water, hurling the steamer forward and churning up a vortex of foam that lingers for miles behind the juggernaut ship
Smoke pours from the funnels as-- 56 The riven water flares higher at the bow as the ship's speeds builds
the prow to find Jack, the wind streaming through his hair and-- 57 Captain Smith steps out of the enclosed bridge onto the wing
He stands with his hands on the rail, looking every bit the storybook picture of a Captain
a great patriarch of the sea
Twenty one knots, sir
She's got a bone in her teeth now, eh, Mr
Murdoch
Smith accepts a cup of tea from
He contentedly watches the white  of water hurled outward from the bows like an expression of his own personal power
They are invulnerable, towering over the sea
58    Jack and Fabrizio lean far over, looking down
In the glassy bow-wave two dolphins appear, under the water, running fast just in front of the steel blade of the prow
They do it for the sheer joy and exultation of motion
Jack watches the dolphins and grins
They breach, jumping clear of the water and then dive back, crisscrossing in front of the bow, dancing ahead of the juggernaut
looks forward across the Atlantic, staring into the sunsparkles
can see the Statue of Liberty already
(grinning at Jack) Very small
of course
around them, until they are framed against the sea
, across the forecastle deck
Rising, as we continue back, and the ships rolls endlessly forward underneath
Over the bridge wing, along the boat deck until her funnels come   besides us and march past like the pillars of heaven, one by one
We pull back and up, until we are looking down the funnels, and the people strolling on the decks and standing at the rail become antlike
And still we pull back until the great lady is seen whole in a gorgeous aerial portrait, black and severe in her majesty
(
) She is the largest moving object ever made by the hand of man in all history

- , Managing Director of White Star Line
and our master shipbuilder, Mr
Andrews here, designed her from the keel plates up
He indicates a handsome 39 year old Irish gentlemen to his right, , of Harland and Wolf Shipbuilders
, showing the group assembled for lunch the next day
Ismay seated with Cal, Rose, Ruth, Molly Brown and Thomas Andrews in the Palm Court, a beautiful sunny spot enclosed by high arched windows
(disliking the attention) Well,  may have knocked her together, but the idea was Mr
Ismay's
He envisioned a steamer so grand in scale, and so luxurious in its appointments, that its supremacy would never be challenged
And here she is
(he slaps the table) willed into solid reality
Why're ships always bein' called "she"
Is it because men think half the women around have big sterns and should be weighed in tonnage
(they all laugh) Just another example of the men settin' the rules their way
The waiter arrives to take orders
Rose lights a cigarette
You know  don't like that, Rose
She knows
Cal takes the cigarette from her and stubs it out
(to the waiter) We'll both have the lamb
Rare, with a little mint sauce
(to Rose, after the waiter moves away) You like lamb, don't you sweetpea
Molly is watching the dynamic between Rose, Cal and Ruth
So, you gonna cut her meat for her too there, Cal
(turning to Ismay) Hey, who came up with the name Titanic
You, Bruce
Yes, actually
wanted to convey sheer size
And size means stability, luxury
and safety-- Do you know of Dr
Freud
His ideas about the male preoccupation with size might be of particular interest to you, Mr
Ismay
Andrews chockes on his breadstick, suppressing laughter
My God, Rose, what's gotten into-- Excuse me
She stalks away
(mortified) do apologize
She's a pistol, Cal
You sure you can handle her
(tense but feigning unconcern) Well,  may have to start minding what she reads from now on
: 60
/   - Jack sits on a bench in the sun
Titanic's wake spreads out behind him to the horizon
He has his knees pulled up, supporting a leather bound sketching pad, his only valuable possession
With conte crayon he draws rapidly, using sure strokes
An emigrant from Manchester named  has his 3 year old daughter  standing on the lower rung of the rail
She is leaned back against his beer barrel of a stomach, watching the seagulls
captures them perfectly, with a great sense of the humanity of the moment
Jack is good
Really good
Fabrizio looks over Jack's shoulder
He nods appreciatively
, a scowling young Irish emigrant, watches as a crewmember comes by, walking three small dogs around the deck
One of them, a , is among the ugliest creatures on the planet
That's typical
First class dogs come down here to take a shit
Jack looks up from his sketch
That's so we know where we rank in the scheme of things
Like we could forget
Jack glances across the well deck
At the aft railing of  deck promenade stands , in a long yellow dress and white gloves
, unable to take his eyes off of her
They are across from each other, about 60 feet apart, with the well deck like a valley between them
She on her promontory, he on his much lower one
She stares down at the water
He watches her unpin her elaborate hat and take it off
She looks at the frilly absurd thing, then tosses it over the rail
It sails far down to the water and is carried away, astern
spot of yellow in the vast ocean
He is riveted by her
She looks like a figure in a romantic novel, sad and isolated
Fabrizio taps Tommy and they both look at Jack gazin at Rose
Fabrizio and Tommy grin at each other
Rose turns suddenly and looks right at Jack
He is caught staring, but he doesn't look away
She does, but then looks back
Their eyes meet across the space of the well deck, across the gulf between worlds
Jack sees a man (Cal) come up behind her and take her arm
She jerks her arm away
They argue in pantomime
She storms away, and he goes after her, disappearing along the -deck promenade
Jack stares after her
Forget it, boyo
You'd as like have angels fly out o' yer arse as get next to the likes o' her
: 61
- as she sits, flanked by people in heated conversation
Cal and Ruth are laughing together, while on the other side - is holding forth animatedly
We don't hear what they are saying
Rose is staring at her plate, barely listening to the inconsequential babble around her
(
) saw my whole life as if 'd already lived it
an endless parade of parties and cotillions, yachts and polo matches
always the same narrow people, the same mindless chatter
felt like  was standing at a great precipice, with no one to pull me back, no one who cared
or even noticed
showing Rose's hand, holding a tiny fork from her crab salad
She pokes the crab-fork into the skin of her arm, harder and harder until it draws blood
: 62
/   - Rose walks along the corridor
steward coming the other way greets her, and she nods with a slight smile
She is perfectly composed
: 63
'  - She enters the room
Stands in the middle, staring at her reflection in the large vanity mirror
Just stands there, then-- With a primal, anguished cry she claws at her throat, ripping off her pearl necklace, which explodes across the room
In a frenzy she tears at herself, her clothes, her hair
then attacks the room
She flings everything off the dresser and it flies clattering against the wall
She hurls a handmirror against the vanity, cracking it
: 64
,  - Rose runs along the  deck promenade
She is dishevelled, her hair flying
She is crying, her cheeks streaked with tears
But also angry, furious
Shaking with emotions she doesn't understand
hatred, self-hatred, desperation
strolling couple watch her pass
Shocked at the emotional display in public
: 65
- Jack is kicked back on one of the benches gazing at the stars blazing gloriously overhead
Thinking artist thoughts and smoking a cigarette
Hearing something, he turns as Rose runs up the stairs from the well deck
They are the only two on the stern deck, except for  , twenty feet above them on the docking bridge catwalk
She doesn't see Jack in the shadows, and runs right past him
as she runs across the deserted fantail
Her breath hitches in an occasional sob, which she suppresses
Rose slams against the base of the stern flagpole and clings there, panting
She stares out at the black water
Then starts to climb over the railing
She has to hitch her long dress way up, and climbing is clumsy
Moving methodically she turns her body and gets her heels on the white-painted gunwale, her back to the railing, facing out toward blackness
60 feet below her, the massive propellers are churning the atlantin into white foam, and a ghostly wake trails off toward the horizon
, we see Rose standing like a figurehead in reverse
Below her are the huge letters of the name ""
She leans out, her arms straightening
looking down hypnotized, into the vortex below her
Her dress and hair are lifted by the wind of the ship's movement
The only sound, above the rush of water below, is the flutter and snap of the big Union Jack right above her
Don't do it
She whips her head around at the sound of his voice
It takes a second for her eyes to focus
Stay back
Don't come any closer
Jack sees the tear tracks on her cheeks in the faint glow from the stern running lights
Take my hand
'll pull you back in
No
Stay where you are
mean it
'll let go
No you won't
What do you mean no  won't
Don't presume to tell me what  will and will not do
You don't know me
You would have done it already
Now come on, take my hand
Rose is confused now
She can't see him very well through the tears, so she wipes them with one hand, almost losing her balance
You're distracting me
Go away
can't
'm involved now
If you let go  have to jump in after you
Don't be absurd
You'll be killed
He takes off his jacket
'm a good swimmer
He starts unlacing his left shoe
The fall alone would kill you
It would hurt
'm not saying it wouldn't
To be honest 'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold
She looks down
The reality factor of what she is doing is sinking in
How cold
(taking off his left shoe) Freezing
Maybe a couple degrees over
He starts unlacing his right shoe
Ever been to Wisconsin
(perplexed) No
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and  grew up there, near Chippewa Falls
Once when  was a kid me and my father were ice-fishing out on Lake Wissota
ice-fishing's where you chop a hole in the-- know what ice fishing is
Sorry
Just
you look like kind of an indoor girl
Anyway,  went through some thin ice and 'm tellin' ya, water that cold
like that right down there
it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body
You can't breath, you can't think
least not about anything but the pain
(takes off his other shoe) Which is why 'm not looking forward to jumping in after you
But like said,  don't see a choice
guess 'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here
You're crazy
That's what everybody says
But with all due respect, 'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship
He slides one step closer, like moving up on a spooked horse
Come on
You don't want to do this
Give me your hand
Rose stares at this madman for a long time
She looks at his eyes and they somehow suddenly seem to fill her universe
Alright
She unfastens one hand from the rail and reaches it around toward him
He reaches out to take it, firmly
'm Jack Dawson
(voice quavering) Pleased to meet you, Mr
Dawson
Rose starts to turn
Now that she has decided to live, the height is terrifying
She is overcome by vertigo as she shifts her footing, turning to face the ship
As she starts to climb, her dress gets in the way, and one foot slips off the edge of the deck
She plunges, letting out a piercing
Jack, gripping her hand, is jerked toward the rail
Rose barely grabs a lower rail with her free hand
, up on the docking bridge hears the scream and heads for the ladder
've got you
won't let go
Jack holds her hand with all his strength, bracing himself on the railing with his other hand
Rose tries to get some kind of foothold on the smooth hull
Jack tries to lift her bodily over the railing
She can't get any footing in her dress and evening shoes, and she slips back
Rose again
Jack, awkwardly clutching Rose by whatever he can get a grip on as she flails, gets her over the railing
They fall together onto the deck in a tangled heap, spinning in such a way that Jack winds up slightly on top of her
Rowe slides down the ladder from the docking bridge like it's a fire drill and sprints across the fantail
Here, what's all this
Rowe runs up and pulls Jack off of Rose, revealing her dishevelled and sobbing on the deck
Her dress is torn, and the hem is pushing up above her knees, showing one ripped stocking
He looks at Jack, the shaggy steerage man with his jacket off, and the first class lady clearly in distress, and starts drawing conclusions
Two seamen chug across the deck to join them
(to Jack) Here you, stand back
Don't move an inch
(to the seamen) Fetch the Master at Arms
: 66
- few minutes later
Jack is being detained by the burly   , the closest thing to a cop on board
He is handcuffing Jack
Cal is right in front of Jack, and furious
He has obviously just rushed out here with Lovejoy and another man, and none of them have coats over their black tie evening dress
The other man is   , a mustachioed blowhard who still has his brandy snifter
He offers it to Rose, who is hunched over crying on a bench nearby, but she waves it away
Cal is more concerned with Jack
He grabs him by the lapels
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee
Look at me, you filth
What did you think you were doing
Cal, stop
It was an accident
An accident
It was
stupid really
was leaning over and  slipped
Rose looks at Jack, getting eye contact
was leaning way over, to see the
ah
propellers
And  slipped and would have gone overboard
and Mr
Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself
You wanted to see the propellers
(shaking his head) Women and machinery do not mix
(to Jack) Was that the way of it
Rose is begging him with her eyes not to say what really happened
Uh huh
That was pretty much it
He looks at Rose a moment longer
Now they have a secret together
Well
The boy's a hero then
Good for you son, well done
(to Cal) So it's all's well and back to our brandy, eh
Jack is uncuffed
Cal gets Rose to her feet and moving
(rubbing her arms) Let's get you in
You're freezing
Cal is leaving without a second thought for Jack
(low) Ah
perhaps a little something for the boy
Oh, right
Mr
Lovejoy
twenty should do it
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love
Rose is displeased
Mmm
what to do
Cal turns back to Jack
He appraises him condescendingly
a steerage ruffian, unwashed and ill-mannered
know
(to Jack) Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale
(looking straight at Rose) Sure
Count me in
Good
Settled then
Cal turns to go, putting a protective arm around Rose
he leans close to Gracie as they walk away
This should be amusing
(as Lovejoy passes) Can  bum a cigarette
Lovejoy smoothly draws a silver cigarette case from his jacket and snaps it open
Jack takes a cigarette, then another, popping it behind his ear for later
Lovejoy lights Jack's cigarette
You'll want to tie those
(Jack looks at his shoes) Interesting that the young lady slipped so mighty all of a sudden and you still had time to take of your jacket and shoes
Mmmm
Lovejoy's expression is bland, but the eyes are cold
He turns away to join his group
: 67
'  - As she undresses for bed Rose sees Cal standing in her doorway, reflected in the cracked mirror of her vanity
He comes toward her
(unexpectedly tender) know you've een melancholy, and  don't pretent to know why
From behind his back he hands her a large black velvet jewel case
She takes it, numbly
intended to save this till the engagement gals next week
But  thought tonight, perhaps a reminder of my feeling for you
Rose slowly opens the box
Inside is the necklace
"   " in all its glory
It is huge
a malevolent blue stone glittering with an infinity of scalpel-like inner reflections
My God
Cal
Is it a-- Daimond
Yes it is
56 carats
He takes the necklace and during the following places it around her throat
He turns her to the mirror, staring behind her
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth
They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the-- The Heart of the Ocean
Cal, it's
it's overwhelming
He gazes at the image of the two of them in the mirror
It's for royalty
And we are royalty
His fingers caress her neck and throat
He seems himself to be disarmed by Rose's elegance and beauty
His emotion is, for the first time, unguarded
There's nothing  couldn't give you
There's nothing 'd deny you if you would deny me
Open your heart to me, Rose
begins to
Closer and closer, during the following: (
) Of course his gift was only to reflect light back onto himself, to illuminate the greatness that was Caledon Hockley
It was a cold stone
a heart of ice
Finally, when Rose's eyes  , we   to her eyes as the are now
transforming through 84 years of life
68 Without a cut the wrinkled, weathered landscape of age has appeared around her eyes
But the eyes themselves are the same
After all these years, feel it closing around my throat like a dog collar
PUllS  to show her whole face
can still feel its weight
If you could have felt it, not just seen it
Well, that's the general idea, my dear
So let me get this right
You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic
(he guffaws) That's great
(warningly) Lewis
But Rose laughs with Bodine
(still laughing) All you had to do was wait two days
Lovett, standing out of Rose's sightline, checks his watch
Hours have passed
This process is taking too long
Rose, tell us more about the diamond
What did Hockley do with it after that
Im afraid 'm feeling a little tired, Mr
Lovett
Lizzy picks up the cue and starts to wheel her out
Wait
Can you give us something go on, here
Like who had access to the safe
What about this Lovejoy guy
The valet
Did he have the combination
That's enough
Lizzy takes her out
Rose's old hand reapears at the doorway in a frail wave goodbye
: 69
/  - As the big hydraulic jib swings one of the Mir subs out over the water
Lovett walks as he talks with Bobby Buell, the partners' rep
They weave among deck cranes, launch crew, sub maintenance guys
The partners are pissed
Bobby, buy me time
need time
We're running thirty thousand a day, and we're six days over
'm telling you what they're telling me
The hand is on the plug
It's starting to pull
Well you tell the hand  need another two days
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby
we're close
smell it
smell ice
She had the diamond on
now we just have to find out where it wound up
just gotta work her a bit more
Okay
Brock turns and sees Lizy standing behind him
She has overheard the past part of his dialogue with Buell
He goes to her and hustles her away from Buell, toward a quite spot on the deck
Hey, Lizzy
need to talk to you for a second
Don't you mean work me
Look, 'm running out of time
need your help
'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and () (') one year old grandmother
came down here to tell you to back off
(with undisguised desperation) Lizzy
you gotta understand something
've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean
've got all my dough tied up in this thing
My wife even divorced me over this hunt
need what's locked inside your grandma's memory
(he holds out his hand) You see this
Right here
She looks at his hand, palm up
Empty
Cupped, as if around an imaginary shape
What
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when  hold that thing
You understand
'm not leaving here without it
Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time
Don't forget, she contacted you
She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past
What past
She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time
(looks at him hard) You think she was really there
Oh, yeah
Yeah, 'm a believer
She was there
: 70 Bodine starts the tape recorder
Rose is gazing at the screen seeing --  is moving along the starboard side of the hull, heading aft
The rectangular windows of  deck (forward) march past on the right
The next day, Saturday,  remember thinking how the sunlight felt
: 71
- from the rusting hulk to the gleaming new Titanic in 1912, passing the end of the enclosed promenade just as Rose walks into the sunlight right in front of us
She is stunningly dressed and walking with purpose
(
) As if  hadn't felt the sun in years
13, 1912
Rose unlatches the gate to go down into third class
The steerage men on the deck stop what they're doing and stare at her
: 72 The social center of steerage life
It is stark by comparison to the opulence of first class, but is a loud, boisterous place
There are mothers with babies, kids running between the benches yelling in several languages and being scolded in several more
There are old women yelling, men playing chess, girls doing needlepoint and reading dime novels
There is even an upright piano and Tommy Ryan is noodling around it
Three boys, shrieking and shouting, are scrambling around chasing a rat under the benches, trying to whomp it with a shoe and causing general havoc
Jack is playing with 5 year old  CARTMeLL, drawing funny faces together in his sketchbook
Fabrizio is struggling to get a conversation going with an attractive Norwegian girl,  , sitting with her family at a table across the room
No Italian
Some little English
No, no
Norwegian
Only
Helga's eye is caught by something
Fabrizio looks, does a take
and Jack, curious, follows their gaze to see
Rose, coming toward them
The activity in the room stops
a hush falls
Rose feels suddenly self-conscious as the steerage passengers stare openly at this princess, some with resentment, others with awe
She spots Jack and gives a little smile, walking straight to him
He rises to meet her, smiling
Hello Jack
Fabrizio and Tommy are floored
Its like the slipper fitting Cinderella
Hello again
Could  speak to you in private
Uh, yes
Of course
After you
He motions her ahead and follows
Jack glances over his shoulder, one eyebrow raised, as he walks out with her leaving a stunned silence
: 73
- Jack and Rose walk side by side
They pass people reading and talking in steamer chairs, some of whom glance curiously at the mismatched couple
He feels out of place in his rough clothes
They are both awkward, for different reasons
So, you got a name by the way
Rose
Rose DeWitt Bukater
That's quite a moniker
may hafta get you to write that down
There is an awkward pause
Mr
Dawson, -- Jack
Jack
feel like such an idiot
It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you
Well, here you are
Here  am
want to thank you for what you did
Not just for
for pulling me back
But for your discretion
You're welcome
Rose
Look,  know what you must be thinking
Poor little rich girl
What does she know about misery
That's not what  was thinking
What  was thinking was
what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out
don't
it wasn't just one thing
It was everything
It was them, it was their whole world
And  was trapped in it, like an insect in amber
(in a rush) just had to get away
just run and run and run
and then  was at the back rail and there was no more ship
even the Titanic wasn't big enough
Not enough to get away from them
And before 'd really though about it, was over the rail
was so furious
'll show them
They'll be sorry
Uh huh
They'll be sorry
'Course you'll be dead
(she lowers her head) Oh God,  am such an utter fool
That penguin last night, is he one of them
Penguin
Oh, Cal
He is them
Is he your boyfriend
Worse 'm afraid
She shows him her engagement ring
sizable diamond
Gawd look at that thing
You would have gone straight to the bottom
They laugh together
passing steward scowls at Jack, who is clearly not a first class passenger, but Rose just glares at him away
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella
Yes, exactly
So don't marry him
If only it were that simple
It is that simple
Oh, Jack
please don't judge me until you've seen my world
Well,  guess  will tonight
Looking for another topic, any other topic, she indicates his sketchbook
What's this
Just some sketches
May
The question is rhetorical because she has already grabbed the book
She sits on a deck chair and opens the sketchbook
' sketches
each one an expressive little bit of humanity: an old woman's hands, a sleeping man, a father and daughter at the rail
The faces are luminous and alive
His book is a celebration of the human condition
Jack, these are quite good
Really, they are
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree
Some loose sketches fall out and are taken by the wind
Jack scrambles after them
catching two, but the rest are gone, over the rail
Oh no
Oh, 'm so sorry
Truly
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree
He snaps his wrist, shaking his drawing hand in a flourish
just seem to spew 'em out
Besides, they're not worth a damn anyway
For emphasis he throws away the two he caught
They sail off
(laughing) You're deranged
She goes back to the book, turning a page
Well, well
She has come upon a series of nudes
Rose is transfixed by the languid beauty he has created
His nudes are soulful, real, with expressive hands and eyes
They feel more like portraits than studies of the human form
almost uncomfortably intimate
Rose blushes, raising the book as some strollers go by
(trying to be very adult) And these were drawn from life
Yup
That's one of the great things about Paris
Lots of girls willing take their clothes off
She studies one drawing in particular, the girl posed half in sunlight, half in shadow
Her hands lie at her chin, one furled and one open like a flower, languid and graceful
The drawing is like an Alfred Steiglitz print of Georgia 'Keefe
You liked this woman
You used her several times
She had beautiful hands
(smiling) think you must have had a love affair with her
(laughing) No, no
Just with her hands
(looking up from the drawings) You have a gift, Jack
You do
You see people
see you
There it is
That piercing gaze again
And
You wouldn'ta jumped
: 74
/ - - Ruth is having tea with    -, the , a 35ish English blue-blood with patirician features
Ruth sees someone coming across the room and lowers her voice
Oh no, that vulgar Brown woman is coming this way
Get up, quickly before she sits with us
Molly Brown walks up, greeting them cheerfully as they are rising
Hello girls,  was hoping 'd catch you at tea
We're awfully sorry you missed it
The Countess and  are just off to take the air on the boat deck
That sounds great
Let's go
need to catch up on the gossip
Ruth grits her teeth as the three of them head for the Grand Staircase to go up
, as they cross the room, the    to Bruce Ismay and Captain Smith at another table
So you've not lit the last four boilers then
No, but we're making excellent time
(impatiently) Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too
We must give them something new to print
And the maiden voyage of Titnaic must make headlines
prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in
Of course  leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all
(Ismay slaps his hand on the table) Retire with a bang, eh,
beat
Then Smith nods, stiffy
: 75
- Rose and Jack stroll aft, past people lounging on deck chairs in the slanting late-afternoon light
Stewards scurry to serve tea or hot cocoa
(girlish and excited) You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist
living in a garret, poor but free
(laughing) You wouldn't last two days
There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar
(angry in a flash) Listen, buster
hate caviar
And 'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head
'm sorry
Really
am
Well, alright
There's something in me, Jack
feel it
don't know what it is, whether  should be an artist, or,  don't know
a dancer
Like Isadora Duncan
a wild pagan spirit
She leaps forward, lands deftly and whirls like a dervish
Then she sees something ahead and her face lights up
or a moving picture actress
She takes his hand and runs, pulling him along the deck toward-- Daniel is cranking the big wooden movie camera as she poses stiffly at the rail
You're sad
Sad, sad, sad
You've left your lover on the shore
You may never see him agian
Try to be sadder, darling
Rose shoots into the shot and strikes a theatrical pose at the rail next to Mary
Mary bursts out laughing
Rose pulls Jack into the picture and makes him pose
Marvin grins and starts yelling and gesturing
We see this in , with music and no dialogue
: Rose posing tragically at the rail, the back of her hand to her forehead
Jack on a deck chair, pretending to be a Pasha, the two girls pantomiming fanning him like slave girls
Jack, on his knees, pleading with his hands clasped while Rose, standing, turns her head in bored disdain
Rose cranking the camera, while Daniel and Jack have a western shoot-out
Jack wins and leers into the lens, twirling an air mustache like Snidely Whiplash
: 76
/  - Painted with orange light, Jack and Rose lean on the -deck rail aft, shoulder to shoulder
The ship's lights come on
It is a magical moment
perfect
So then what, Mr
Wandering Jack
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so  went down to Los Angelas to the pier in Santa Monica
That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster
sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece
whole ten cents
(not getting it) Yeah; it was great money
could make a dollar a day, sometimes
But only in summer
When it got cold,  decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing
(looks at the dusk sky) Why can't  be like you Jack
Just head out for the horizon whenever  feel like it
(turning to him) Say we'll go there, sometime
to that pier
even if we only ever just talk about it
Alright, we're going
We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach
right in the surf
but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff
You mean one leg on each side
Scandalous
Can you show me
Sure
If you like
(smiling at him) think  would
(she looks at the horizon) And teach me to spit too
Like a man
Why should only men be able to spit
It's unfair
They didn't teach you that in finishing school
Here, it's easy
Watch closely
He spits
It arcs out over the water
Your turn
Rose screws up her mouth and spits
pathetic little bit of foamy spittle which mostly runs down her chin before falling off into the water
Nope, that was pitiful
Here, like this
you hawk it down
then roll it on your tongue, up to the front, like thith, then a big breath and
You see the range on that thing
She goes through the steps
Hawks it down, etc
He coaches her through it (ad lib) while doing the steps himself
She lets fly
So does he
Two comets of gob fly out over the water
That was great
Rose turns to him, her face alight
Suddenly she blanches
He sees her expression and turns
, the Countess of Rothes, and Molly Brown have been watching them hawking lugees
Rose becomes instantly composed
Mother, may  introduce Jack Dawson
Charmed, 'm sure
Jack has a little spit running down his chin
He doesn't know it
Molly Brown is grinning
As Rose proceeds with the introductions, we hear
(
) The others were gracious and curious about the man who'd saved my life
But my mother looked at him like an insect
dangerous insect which must be squashed quickly
Well, Jack, it sounds like you're a good man to have around in a sticky spot-- They all jump as a  sounds the meal call right behind them
Why do they insist on always announcing dinner like a damn cavalry charge
Shall we go dress, mother
(over her shoulder) See you at dinner, Jack
(as they walk away) Rose, look at you
out in the sun with no hat
Honestly
The Countess exits with Ruth and Rose, leaving Jack and Molly alone on deck
Son, do you have the slightest comprehension of what you're doing
Not really
Well, you're about to go into the snakepit
hope you're ready
What are you planning to wear
Jack looks down at his clothes
Back up at her
He hadn't thought about that
figured
: 77
' Men's suits and jackets and formal wear are strewn all over the place
Molly is having a fine time
Jack is dressed, except for his jacket, and Molly is tying his bow tie
Don't feel bad about it
My husband still can't tie one of these damn things after 20 years
There you go
She picks up a jacket off the bed and hands it to him
Jack goes into the bathroom to put it on
Molly starts picking up the stuff off the bed
gotta buy everything in three sizes 'cause  never know how much he's been eating while 'm away
She turns and sees him, though we don't
My, my, my
you shine up like a new penny
: 78
/  CLAsS  - purple sky, shot with orange, in the west
Drifting strains of classic music
We    along the deck
By Edwardian standards he looks badass
Dashing in his borrowed white-tie outfit, right down to his pearl studs
steward bows and smartly opens the door to the First Class Entrance
Good evening, sir
Jack plays the role smoothly
Nods with just the right degree of disdain
: 79
/    - Jack steps in and his breath is taken away by the splendor spread out before him
Overhead is the enormous glass dome, with a crystal chandelier at its center
Sweeping down six stories is the First Class Grand Staircase, the epitome of the opulent naval architecture of the time
And the people: the women in their floor length dresses, elaborate hairstyles and abundant jewelry
the gentlemen in evening dress, standing with one hand at the small of the back, talking quietly
Jack descends to  deck
Several men nod a perfunctory greeting
He nods back, keeping it simple
He feels like a spy
Cal comes down the stairs, with Ruth on his arm, covered in jewelry
They both walk right past Jack, neither one gecognizeing him
Cal nods at him, one gent to another
But Jack barely has time to be amused
Because just behind Cal and Ruth on the stairs is Rose, a vision in red and black, her low-cut dress showing off her neck and shoulders, her arms seathed in white gloves that come well above above the elbow
Jack is hypnotized by her beauty
as she approaches Jack
He imitates the gentlemen's stance, hand behind his back
She extends her gloved hand and he takes it, kissing the back of her fingers
Rose flushes, beaming noticeably
She can't take her eyes off him
saw that in a nickelodean once, and  always wanted to do it
Cal, surely you remember Mr
Dawson
(caught off guard) Dawson
didn't recognize you
(studies him) Amazing
You could almost pass for a gentlemen
: 80
- , as the party descends to dinner
They encounter Molly Brown, looking good in a beaded dress, in her own busty broad-shouldered way
Molly grins when she sees Jack
As they are going into the dining saloon she walks next to him, speaking low: Ain't nothin' to it, is there, Jack
Yeah, you just dress like a pallbearer and keep your nose up
Remember, the only thing they respect is money, so just act like you've got a lot of it and you're in the club
As they enter the swirling throng, Rose leans close to him, pointing out several notables
There's the Countess Rothes
And that's John Jacob Astor
the richest man on the ship
His little wifey there, Madeleine, is my age and in a delicate condition
See how she's trying to hide it
Quite the scandal
(nodding toward a couple) And over there, that's Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon
She designs naughty lingerie, among her many talents
Very popular with the royals
Cal becomes engrossed in a conversations with Cosmo Duff-Gordon and Colonel Gracie, while Ruth, the Countess and Lucille discuss fashion
Rose picots Jack smoothly, to show him another couple, dressed impeccably
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert
Mrs
Guggenheim is at home with the children, of course
Cal, meanwhile, is accepting the praise of his male counterparts, who are looking at Rose like a prize show horse
Hockley, she is splendid
Thank you
Cal's a lucky man
know him well, and it can only be luck
Ruth steps over, hearing the last
She takes Cal's arm, somewhat coquettishly
How can you say that Colonel
Caledon Hockley is a great catch
The entourage strolls toward the dining saloon, where they run into the Astor's going through the ornate double doors
, Madeleine, 'd like you to meet Jack Dawson
(shaking his hand) Good to meet you Jack
Are you of the Boston Dawsons
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually
nods as if he's heard of them, then looks puzzled
Madeleine Astor appraises Jack and whispers girlishly to Rose: It's a pity we're both spoken for, isn't it
: 81 Like a ballroom at the palace, alive and lit by a constellation of chandeliers, full of elegantly dressed people and beautiful music from ' small orchestra
As Rose and Jack enter and move across the room to their table, Cal and Ruth beside them, we hear
(
) He must have been nervous but he never faltered
They assumed he was one of them
a young captain of industry perhaps
new money, obviously, but still a memeber of the club
Mother of course, could always be counted upon
: 82 Tell us of the accommodations in steerage, Mr
Dawson
hear they're quite good on this ship
:
Jack is seated opposite Rose, who is flanked by Cal and Thomas Andrews
Also at the table are Molly Brown, Ismay, Colonel Gracie, the Countess, Guggenheim, Madame Aubert, and the Astors
The best 've seen, m'am
Hardly any rats
Rose motions surreptitiously for Jack to take his napkin off his plate
Mr
Dawson is joining us from third class
He was of some assistance to my fiancee last night
(to Jack, as if to a child) This is foie gras
It's goose liver
We see whispers exchanged
Jack becomesthe subject of furtive glances
Now they're all feeling terribly liberal and dangerous
(low to Madame Aubert) What is Hockly hoping to prove, bringing this
bohemian
up here
(to Jack) How do you take your caviar, sir
(answering for him) Just a soupcon of lemon
(to Jack, smiling) it improves the flavor with champagne
(to the waiter) No caviar for me, thanks
(to Cal) Never did like it much
He looks at Rose, pokerfaced, and she smiles
And where exactly do you live, Mr
Dawson
Well, right now my address is the  Titanic
After that, 'm on God's good humor
Salad is served
Jack reaches for the fish fork
Rose gives him a look and picks up the salad fork, prompting him with her eyes
He changes forks
You find that sort of rootless existence appealing, do you
Well
it's a big world, and  want to see it all before  go
My father was always talkin' about goin' to see the ocean
He died in the town he was born in, and never did see it
You can't wait around, because you never know what hand you're going to get dealt next
See, my folks died in a fire when  was fifteen, and 've been on the road since
Somethin' like that teaches you to take life as it comes at you
To make each day count
Molly Brown raises her glass in a salute
Well said, Jack
(raising his glass) Here, here
Rose raises her glass, looking at Jack
To making it count
Ruth, annoyed that Jack has scored a point, presses him further
How is it you have the means to travel, Mr
Dawson
work my way from place to place
Tramp steamers and such
won my ticket on Titanic here in a lucky hand at poker
(he glances at Rose) very lucky hand
All life is a game of luck
real man makes his own luck, Archie
Rose notices that Thomas Andrews, sitting next to her, is writing in his notebook, completely ignoring the conversation
Mr
Andrews, what are you doing
see you everywhere writing in this little book
(grabs it and reads) Increase number of screws in hat hooks from 2 to 3
You build the biggest ship in the world and this preoccupies you
Andrews smiles sheepishly
He knows every rivet in her, don't you Thomas
All three million of them
His blood and soul are in the ship
She may be mine on paper, but in the eyes of God she belongs to Thomas Andrews
Your ship is a wonder, Mr
Andrews
Truly
Thankyou, Rose
We see that Andrews has come under Rose's spell
83  : Dessert has been served and a waiter arrives with cigars in a humidor on a wheeled cart
The men start clipping ends and lighting
(low, to Jack) Nest it'll be brandies in the Smoking Room
(rising) Well, join me for a brandy, gentlemen
(low) Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke and congratulate each other on being masters of the universe
Joining us, Dawson
You don't want to stay out here with the women, do you
Actually he does, but
No thanks
'm heading back
Probably best
It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing
Wouldn't interest you
Good of you to come
Cal and te other gentlemen exit
Jack, must you go
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin
He leans over to take her hand
: We see him slip a tiny folded not into her palm
Ruth, scowling, watches him walk away across the enormous room
Rose surreptitiously opens the note below table level
It reads: "Make it count
Meet me at the clock"
: 84
- - Rose crosses the -Deck foyer, sighting Jack at the landing above
Overhead is the crystal dome
Jack has his back to her, studying the ornate clock with its carved figures of Honor and Glory
It softly strikes the hour
as she goes up the sweeping staircase toward him
He turns, sees her
smiles
Want to go to a real party
: 85 Crow led and alive with music, laughter and raucous carrying on
An ad hoc band is gathered near the upright piano, honking out lively stomping music on fiddle, accoridon and tambourine
People of all ages are dancing, drinking beer and wine, smoking, laughing, even brawling
Tommy hands Rose a pint of stout and she hoists it
Jack meanwhile dances with 5 year old Cora Cartmell, or tries to, with her standing on his feet
As the tune ends, Rose leans down to the little girl
May  cut in, miss
You're still my best girl, Cora
Cora scampers off
Rose and Jack face each other
She is trembling as he takes her right hand in his left
His other hand slides to the small of her back
It is an electrifying moment
don't know the steps
Just move with me
Don't think
The music starts and they are off
little awkward at first, she starts to get into it
She grins at Jack as she starts to get the rhythm of the steops
Wait
stop
She bends down, pulling off her high heeled shoes, and flings them to Tommy
Then she grabs Jack and they plunge back into the fray, dancing faster as the music speeds up
: 86 87 The scene is rowdy and rollicking
table gets knocked over as a drunk crashes into it
And in the middle of it
Rose dancing with Jack in her stocking feet
The steps are fast and she shines with sweat
space opens around them, and people watch them, clapping as the band plays faster and faster
Dancing has obviated the need for a common language
He whirls her, then she responds by whirling him
Fabrizio's eyes go wide when he realizes she's stronger than he is
The tune ends in a mad rush
Jack steps away from Rose with a flourish, allowing her to take a bow
Exhilarated and slightly tipsy, she does a graceful ballet ployer, feet turned out perfectly
Everyone laughs and applauds
Rose is a hit with the steerage folks, who've never had a lady party with them
They move to a table, flushed and sweaty
Rose grabs Fabrizio's cigarette and takes a big drag
She's feeling cocky
Fabrizio is grinning, holding hands with Helga
How you two doin'
don't know hwat she's say, she don't know what  say, so we get along fine
Tommy walks up with a pint for each of them
Rose chugs hers, showing off
You think a first class girl can't drink
Everybody else is dancing again, and Bjorn Gundersen crashes into Tommy, who sloshes his beer over Rose's dress
She laughs, not caring
But Tommy lunges, grabbing Bjorn and wheeling him around
You stupid bastard
Bjorn comes around, his fists coming up
and Jack leaps into the middle of it, pushing them apart
Boys, boys
Did  ever tell you the one about the Swede and the Irishman goin' to the whorehouse
Tommy stands there, all piss and vinegar, chest puffed up
Then he grins and claps Bjorn on the shoulder
So, you think you're big tough men
Let's see you do this
In her stocking feet she assumes a ballet stance, arms raised, and goes up on point, taking her entire weight on the tips of her toes
The guys gape at her incredible muscle control
She comes back down, then her face screws up in pain
She grabs one foot, hopping around
Oooowww
haven't done that in years
Jack catches her as she loses her balance, and everyone cracks up
to the well deck is open a few inches as Lovejoy watches through the gap
He sees Jack holding Rose, both of them laughing
closes the door
: 88
- The stars blaze overhead, so bright and clear you can see the Milky Way
Rose and Jack walk along the row of lifeboats
Still giddy from the party, they are singing a popular song "Come Josephine in My Flying Machine"
/ Come Josephine in my flying machine And it's up she goes
Up she goes
In the air she goes
Where
There she goes
They fumble the words and break down laughing
They have reached the First Class Entrance, but don't go straight in, not wanting the evening to end
Through the doors the sound of the ship's orchestra wafts gently
Rose grabs a davit and leans back, staring at the cosmos
Isn't it magnificent
So grand and endless
She goes to the rail and leans on it
They're such small people, Jack
my crowd
They think they're giants on the earth, but they're not even dust in God's eye
They live inside this little tiny champagne bubble
and someday the bubble's going to burst
He leans at the rail next to her, his hand just touching hers
It is the slightest contact imaginable, and all either one of them can feel is that square inch of skin where their hands are touching
You're not one of them
There's been a mistake
mistake
Uh huh
You got mailed to the wrong address
(laughing) did, didn't
() (') (pointing suddenly) Look
shooting star
That was a long one
My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven
like that
Aren't we supposed to wish on it
Jack looks at her, and finds that they are suddenly very close together
It would be so easy to move another couple of inches, to kiss her
Rose seems to be thinking the same thing
What would you wish for
After a beat, Rose pulls back
Something  can't have
(she smiles sadly) Goodnight, Jack
And thank you
She leaves the rail and hurries through the First Class Entrance
Rose
But the door bangs shut, and she is gone
Back to her world
: 89
'  /   - 14, 1912
bright clear day
Sunlight splashing across the promenade
Rose and Cal are having breakfast in silence
The tension is palpable
Trudy Bolt, in her maid's uniform, pours the coffee and goes inside
had hoped you would come to me last night
was tired
Yes
Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting
(stiffening) see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me
You will never behave like that again
Do you understand
'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command
am your fiancee-- Cal explodes, sweeping the breakfast china off the table with a crash
He moves to her in one shocking moment, glowering over her and gripping the sides of her chair, so she is trapped between his arms
Yes
You are
And my wife
in practice, if not yet by law
So you will honor me, as a wife is required to honor her husband
will not be made out a fool
Is this in any way unclear
Rose shrinks into the chair
She sees Trudy, frozen, partway through the door bringing the orange juice
Cal follows Rose's glance and straightens up
He stalks past the maid, entering the stateroom
We
had a little accident
'm sorry, Trudy
: 90
'  - Rose is dressed for the day, and is in the middle of helping Ruth with her corset
The tight bindings do not inhibit Ruth's fury at all
You are not to see that boy again, do you understand me Rose
forbid it
Rose has her knee at the base of her mother's back and is pulling the corset strings with both hands
Oh, stop it, Mother
You'll give yourself a nosebleed
Ruth pulls away from her, and crosses to the door, locking it
(wheeling on her) Rose, this is not a game
Our situation is precarious
You know the money's gone
Of course  know it's gone
You remind me every day
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name
And that name is the only card we have to play
Rose turns her around and grabs the corset strings again
Ruth sucks in her waist and Rose pulls
don't understand you
It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival
(hurt and lost) How can you put this on my shoulders
Rose turns to her, and we see what Rose sees-- the naked fear in her mother's eyes
Do you want to se me working as a seamstress
Is that what you want
Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds
My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish
It's so unfair
Of course it's unfair
We're women
Our choices are never easy
Rose pulls the corset tighter
: 91 At the divine service, Captain Smith is leading a group in the hymn "Almighty Father Strong To Save
" Rose and Ruth sing in the middle of the group
Lovejoy stands well back, keeping an eye on Rose
He notices a commotion at the entry doors
Jack has been halted there by two stewards
He is dressed in his third class clothes, and stands there, hat in hand, looking out of place
Look, you, you're not supposed to be in here
was just here last night
don't you remember
(seeing Lovejoy coming toward him) He'll tell you
Mr
Hockley and Mrs
DeWitt Bukater continue to be most appreciative of your assistance
They asked me to give you this in gratitude-- He holds out two twenty dollar bills, which Jack refuses to take
don't want money, -- --and also to remind you that you hold a third class ticket and your presence here is no longer appropriate
Jack spots Rose but she doesn't see him
just need to talk to Rose for a-- Gentlemen, please see that Mr
Dawson gets back where he belongs
(giving the twenties to the stewards) And that he stays there
Yes sir
(to Jack) Come along you
, not seeing Jack hustled out
(singing) hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea
: 92
- An Edwardian nautilus room
There are machines we recognize, and some don't
woman pedals a stationary bicycle in a long dress, looking rediculous
Thomas Andrews is leading a small tour group, including Rose, Ruth and Cal
Cal is wroking the oars of a stationary rowing machine with a well trained stroke
Reminds me of my Harvard days
McCAULEY, the gym instructor, is a bouncy little man in white flannels, eager to show off his modern equipment, like his present-day counterpart on an "Abflex" infomercial
He hits a switch and a machine with a saddle on it starts to undulate
Rose puts her hand on it, curious
The electric horse is very popular
We even have an electric camel
(to Ruth) Care to try your hand at the rowing, m'am
Don't be absurd
can't think of a skill  should likely need less
The next stop on our tour will be bridge
This way, please
: 93
, -  - - Jack, walking with determination, is followed closely by Tommy and Fabrizio
He quickly climbs the steps to -Deck and steps over the gate separating 3rd from 2nd class
She's a goddess amongst mortal men, there's no denyin'
But she's in another world, Jackie, forget her
She's closed the door

Tommy shakes his head resignedly and puts his hands together, crouching down
Jack steps into Tommy's hands and gets boosted up to the next deck, where he scrambles nimbly over the railing, onto the First Class deck

Another ice warning, sir
This one from the "Baltic"
Thankyou, Sparks
Smith glances at the message then nonchalantly puts it in his pocket
He nods reassuringly to Rose and the group
Not to worry, it's quite normal for this time of year
In fact, we're speeding up
've just ordered the last boilers lit
Andrews scowls slightly before motioning the group toward the door
They exit just as      comes out of the chartroom, stopping next to First Officer Murdoch
Did we ever find those binoculars for the lookouts
Haven't seen them since Southampton

/   - Andrews leads the group back from the bridge along the boat deck
Mr
Andrews,  did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned
forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard
About half, actually
Rose, you miss nothing, do you
In fact,  put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here
(he gestures along the eck) But it was thought
by some
that the deck would look too cluttered
So was over-ruled
(slapping the side of a boat) Waste of deck space as it is, on an unsinkable ship
Sleep soundly, young Rose
have built you a good ship, strong and true
She's all the lifeboat you need
As they are passing Boat 7, a gentlemen turns from the rail and walks up behind the group
It is Jack
He taps Rose on the arm and she turns, gasping
He motions and she cuts away from the group toward a door which Jack holds open
They duck into the-- : 97

Rose and Jack are alone in the room
Jack, this is impossible
can't see you
He takes her by the shoulders
Rose, you're no picnic
you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl 've ever known and-- Jack, -- No wait
Let me try to get this out
You're amazing
and  know  have nothing to offer you, Rose
know that
But 'm involved now
You jump, jump, remember
can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright
Rose feels the tears coming to her eyes
Jack is so open and real
not like anyone she has ever known
You're making this very hard
'll be fine
Really
don't think so
They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out
Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong
But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out
It's not up to you to save me, Jack
You're right
Only you can do that
have to get back, they'll miss me
Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone

Rose sits on a divan, with a group of other women arrayed around her
Ruth, the Countess Rothes and Lady Duff-Gordon are taking tea
Rose is silent and still as a porcelain figurine as the conversation washes around her
Of course the invitations had to be sent back to the printers twice
And the bridesmaids dresses
Let me tell you what an odyssey that has been
on Rose as Ruth goes on

The mother correcting her on her posture, and the way she holds the teacup
The little girl is trying so hard to please, her expression serious

As the ship looms,  , we push in on the bow
Jack is there, right at the apex of the bow railing, his favorite spot
He closes his eyes, letting the chill wind clear his head
Jack hears her voice, behind him
Hello, Jack
He turns and she is standing there
changed my mind
He smiles at her, his eyes drinking her in
Her cheeks are red with the chill wind, and her eyes sparkle
Her hair blows wildly about her face
Fabrizio said you might be up-- Sssshh
Come here
He puts his hands on her waist
As if he is going to kiss her
Close your eyes
She does, and he turns her to face forward, the way the ship is going
He presses her gently to the rail, standing right behind her
Then he takes her two hands and raises them until she is standing with her arms outstetched on each side
Rose is going along with him
When he lowers his hands, her arms stay up
like wings
Okay
Open them
Rose gasps
There is nothing in her field of vision but water
It's like there is no ship under them at all, just the two of them soaring
The Atlantic unrolls toward her, a hammered copper shield under a dusk sky
There is only the wind, and the hiss of the water 50 feel below
'm flying
She leans forward, arching her back
He puts his hands on her waist to steady her
(singing softly) Come Josephine in my flying machine
Rose cleses her eyes, feeling herself floating weightless far above the sea
She smiles dreamily, then leans back, gently pressing her back against his chest
He pushes forward slightly against her
Slowly he raises his hands, arms outstretched, and they meet hers
fingertips gently touching
Then their fingers intertwine
Moving slowly, their fingers caress through and around each other like the bodies of two lovers
Jack tips his face forward into her blowing hair, letting the scent of her wash over him, until his cheek is agianst her ear
Rose turns her head until her lips are near his
She lowers her arms, turning further, until she finds his mouth with hers
He wraps his arms around her from behind, and they kiss like this with her head turned and tilted back, surrendering to him, to the emotion, to the inevitable
They kiss, slowly and tremulously, and then with building passion
Jack and the ship seem to merge into one force of power and optimism, lifting her, buoying her forward on a magical journey, soaring onward into a night without fear

He's fascinated
Cal insist on luggin this thing everywhere
Should  be expecting him anytime soon
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out
She unlocks the safe
Glancing up, she meets his eyes in the mirror behind the safe
She opens it and removes the necklace, then holds it out to Jack who takes it nervously
What is it

The last thing  need is another picture of me looking like a china doll
As a paying customer,  expect to get what  want
She hands him a dime and steps back, parting the kimono
The blue stone lies on her creamy breast
Her heart is pounding as she slowly lowers the robe
Jakc looks so stricken, it is almost comical
The kimono drops to the floor (this is all in cuts, lyrical)
Tell me when it looks right to you
She poses on the divan, settling like a cat into the position we remember from the drawing

and lower your head
Eyes to me

He drops his pencil and she stifles a laugh

Big Artiste
can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing
(sweating) He does landscapes
as his eyes come up to look at her over the top edge of his sketchpad
We have seen this image of him before, in her memory
It is an image she will carry the rest of her life
Despite his nervousness, he draws with sure strokes, and what emerges is the best thing he has ever done
Her pose is languid, her hands beautiful, and her eyes radiate her energy

' Cal and Ruth wait in the sitting room, along with the Master at Arms and two stewards (Steward #1 and Barnes)
Silence as Rose and Jack enter
Ruth closes her robe at her throat when she sees Jack
Something serious has happened
That's right
Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening
Now that one is back
(he looks from Rose to Jack) have a pretty good idea where to fine the other
(to Master at Arms) Search him
The Master at Arms steps up to Jack
Coat off, mate
Lovejoy pulls at Jack's coat and Jack shakes his head in dismay, shrugging out of it
The Master at Arms pats him down
This is horseshit
Cal, you can't be serious
We're in the middle of an emergency and you-- Steward Barnes pulls the Heart of the Ocean out of the pocket of Jack's coat
Is this it
Rose is stunned
Needless to say, so is Jack
That's it
Right then
Now don't make a fuss
He starts to handcuff Jack
Don't you believe it, Rose
Don't
(uncertain) He couldn't have
Of course he could
Easy enough for a professional
He memorized the combination when you opend the safe
: Rose at the safe, looking in the mirror and meeting Jack's eyes as he stands behind her, watching
But  was with him the whole time
(just to her, low and cold) Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on
They put it in my pocket
(holding Jack's coat) It's not even your pocket, son
(reading) "Property of
Ryerson"
Lovejoy shows the coat to the Master at Arms
There is a label inside the collar with the owner's name
That was reported stolen today
was going to return it
Rose-- Rose feels utterly betrayed, hurt and confused
She shrinks away from him
He starts shouting to her as Lovejoy and the Master at Arms drag him out into the hall
She can't look him in the eye
Rose, don't listen to them
didn't do this
You know  didn't
You know it
She is devastated
Her mother lays a comforting hand on her shoulder as te tears well up
Why do women believe men

/ Smith and Andrews come down the steps to the Mail Sorting Room and finds the clerks scrambling to pull mail from the racks
They are furiously hauling wet sacks of mail up from the hold below
Andrews climbs partway down the stairs to the hold, which is almost full
Sacks of mail float everywhere
The lights are still on below the surface, casting an eerie glow
The Renault is visible under the water, the brass glinting cheerfully
Andrews looks down as the water covers his shoe, and scrambles back up the stairs
: 163
/ Andrews unrolls a big drawing of the ship across the chartroom table
It is a side elevation, showing all the watertight bulkheads
His hands are shaking
Murdoch and Ismay hover behind Andrews and the Captain
When can we get underway, do you think
Smith glares at him and turns his attention to Andrews' drawing
The builder points to it for emphasis as he talks
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes
in the forepeak
in all three holds
and in boiler room six
That's right
Five compartments
She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached
But not five
Not five
As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads
at  Deck
from one to the next
back and back
There's no stopping it
The pumps-- The pumps buy you time
but minutes only
From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder
But this ship can't sink
She is made of iron, sir
assure you, she can
And she will
It is a mathematical certainty
Smith looks like he has been gutpunched
How much time
An hour, two at most
Ismay reels as his dream turns into his worst nightmare
And how many aboard, Mr
Murdoch
Two thousand two hundred souls aboard, sir

Smith turns to his employer

Ismay

Steam is venting from pipes on the funnes overhead, and the din is horrendous
Speech is difficult adding to the crew's level of disorganization
Andrews sees some men fumbling with the mechanism of one of the Wellin davits and yells to them over the roar of steam
Turn to the right
Pull the falls taut before you unchock
Have you never had a boat drill
No sir
Not with these new davits, sir
He looks around, disguisted as the crew fumble with the davits, and the tackle for the "falls"

Ruth exits and Hockley crosses to Rose
He regards her coldly for a moment, then  her across the face
It is a little slut, isn't it
To Rose the blow is inconsequential compared to the blow her heart has been given
Cal grabs her shoulders roughly
Look at me, you little-- There is a loud knock on the door and an urgent voice
The door opens and their steward puts his head in
Sir, 've been told to ask you to please put on your lifebelt, and come up to the boat deck
Get out
We're busy
The steward persists, coming in to get the lifebelts down from the top of a dresser
'm sorry about the inconvenience, Mr
Hockley, but it's Captain's orders
Please dress warmly, it's quite cold tonight
(he hands a lifebelt to Rose) Not to worry, miss, 'm sure it's just a precaution
This is ridiculous
In the corridor outside the stewards are being so polite and obsequious they are conveying no sense of danger whatsoever
However, it's another story in

The door is thrown open and the lights snapped on by a steward
The Cartmell family rouses from a sound sleep

Lifebelts on
Everybody up, come on

People come out of the doors behind the steward, perplexed
In the foreground a   asks her husband what was said
He shrugs
: 167 , looking shocked
, sir
That's right
The distress call
Tell whoever responds that we are going down by the head and need immediate assistance
Smith hurries out
Blimey
Maybe you ought to try that new distress call
(grinning) It may be our only chance to use it
Phillips laughs in spite of himself and starts sending history's first Dit dit dit, da da da, dit dit dit

The deck is empty except for the crew fumbling with the davits
He yells over the roar of the steam to First Officer Murdoch

They've all gone back inside
Too damn cold and noisy for them
Andrews feels like he is in a bad dream
He looks at his pocketwatch and heads for the foyer entrance

They are getting indignant about the confusion
Molly Brown snags a passing What's doing, sonny
You've got us all trussed up and now we're cooling our heels
The young steward backs away, actually stumbling on the stairs
Sorry, mum
Let me go and find out
The jumpy piano rhythm of "Alexander's Ragtime Band" comes out of the first class lounge a few yards away
Band leader   has assembled some of his men on Captain's orders, to allay panic
Hockley's entourage comes up to the -deck foyer
Cal is carrying the lifebelts, almost as an afterthought
Rose is like a sleepwalker
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book
There's no need for language, Mr
Hockley
(to Trudy) Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back
Thomas Andrews enters, looking around the magnificent room, which he knows is doomed
Rose, standing nearby, sees his heartbroken expression
She walks over to him and Cal goes after her
saw the iceberg, Mr
Andrews
And  see it in your eyes
Please tell me the truth
The ship will sink
You're certain
Yes
In an hour or so
all this
will be at the bottom of the Atlantic
My God
Now it is Cal's turn to look stunned
The Titanic
Sinking
Please tell only who you must,  don't want to be responsible for a panic
And get to a boat quickly
Don't wait
You remember what  told you about the boats
Yes,  understand
Thankyou
Andrews goes off, moving among the passengers and urging them to put on their lifebelts and get to the boats

Urgently

Lovejoy pulls a pearl handled Colt

The Master at Arms nods and tosses the handcuff key to Lovejoy, then exits with the crewman

- Lightoller has his boats swung out
He is standing amidst a crowd of uncertain passengers in all states of dress and undress
One first class woman is barefoot
Others are in stockings
The maitre of the restaurant is in top hat and overcoat
Others are still in evening dress, while some are in bathrobes and kimonos
Women are wearing lifebelts over velvet gowns, then topping it with sble stoles
Some brought jewels, others books, even small dogs
Lightoller sees Smith walking stiffly toward him and quickly goes to him
He yells into the Captain's ear, through cupped hands, over the roar of the steam
Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir
Smith just nods, a bit abstractly
The fire has gone out of him
Lightoller sees the awesome truth in Smith's face
(to the men) Right
Start the loading
Women and children
The appalling din of escaping steam abruptly cuts off, leaving a sudden unearthly silence in which Lightoller's voice echoes
raising his violin to play
Number 26
Ready and-- The band has reassembled just outside the First Class Entrance, port side, near where Lightoller is calling for the boats to be loaded
They strike up a waltz, lively and elegant
The music wafts all over the ship
Ladies, please
Step into the boat
Finally one soman steps across the gap, into the boat, terrified of the drop to the water far below
You watch
They'll put us off in these silly little boats to freeze, and we'll all be back on board by breakfast
Cal, Rose and Ruth come out of the doors near the band
My brooch,  left my brooch

She turns back to go to her room but Cal takes her by the arm, refusing to let her go
The firmness of his hold surprises her
Stay here, Ruth
Ruth sees his expression, and knows fear for the first time

/ It is chaos, with stewards pushing their way through narrow corridors clogged with peopel carrying suitcases, duffel bags, children
Some have lifebelts on, others don't

Aw, bloody hell
He throws up his hand at the sight of a family, loaded down with cases and bags, completely blocking the corridor
Fabrizio and Tommy push past the stewards, going the other way
They rech a huge crowd gathered at the bottom of the  3RD
Fabrizio spots Helga with the rest of the Dahl family, standing patiently with suitcases in hand
He reaches her and she grins, hugging him
Tommy pushes to where he can see what's holding up the group
There is a steel gate across the top of the stairs, with several stewards and seamen on the other side
Stay calm, please
It's not time to go up to the boats yet
Near Tommy, an  stands stoically with two small children and their battered luggage

We're just waiting, dear
When they fiish putting First Class people in the boats, they'll be startin' with us, and we'll want to be all ready, won't we

He picks up the bullet

It shoots into the sky and  with a thunderclap over the ship, sending out white starbursts which light up the entire deck as they fall
off the starbursts to Ismay
The Managing Director of White Star Line is cracking
Already at the breaking point from his immense guilt, the rocket panics him
He starts shouting at the officers struggling with the falls of  5
There is no time to waste

You're afraid, darling
Scared to death

Either she suddenly learned to act or she is petrified
watches the farewells taking pace right in front of her as they step closer to the boat
Husbands saying goodbye to wives and children
Lovers and friends parted
Nearby  is getting a reluctant woman to board the boat
Come on, you heard the man
Get in the boat, sister
Will the lifeboats be seated according to class
hope they're not too crowded-- Oh, Mother shut up
(Ruth freezes, mouth open) Don't you understand
The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats
not enough by half

Molly practically hands her over to Lightoller, then looks around for some other women who might need a push
Come on, Rose
You're next, darlin'
Rose steps back, shaking her head
Rose, get in the boat
Goodbye, mother
Ruth, standing in the tippy lifeboat, can do nothing
Cal grabs Rose's arm but she pulls free and walks away through the crowd
Cal catches up to Rose and grabs her again, roughly
Where are you going
To him
Is that it
To be a whore to that gutter rat
'd rather be his whore than your wife
He clenches his jaw and squeezes her arm viciously, pulling her back toward the lifeboat
Rose pulls out a hairpin and jabs him with it
he lets go with a curse and she runs into the crowd
Lower away
Rose
Stuff a sock in it, would ya, Ruth
She'll be along
The boat lurches downward as the falls are paid out

She looks back and a furious Cal is coming after her
She runs breathlessly up to two proper looking men
That man tried to take advantage of me in the crowd
Appalled, they turn to see Cal running toward them
Rose runs on as the two men grab Cal, restraining him
She runs throught the First Class entrance
Cal breaks free and runs after her
He reaches the entrance, but runs into a knot of people coming out

Pull
Ain't you boys ever rowed before

Mr
Andrews, thank God

She spins and runs back, locating the right door, then pushes it open, creating a small wave
She splashes over Jack and puts her arms around him
Jack, Jack, Jack

They are so happy to see each other it's embarrassing
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket

She kisses his face and hugs him again, then starts to go through the desk
So

In a lit porthole beneath the surface she sees Jack looking up at her
a face in a bubble of light under the water

There's no key in here

She climbs the stairs, her long skirt leaving a trail like a giant snail
The weight of it is really slowing her down

She bounds up the stairs in her stockings and knee-length slip, to find herself in-- 191

She is alone here
long groan of stressing metal echoes along the hall as the ship continues to settle
She runs down the hall, unimpeded now
Hello
Somebody
She turns a corner and runs along another corridor in a daze
The hall slopes down into water which, shimmers, reflecting the light
The margin of the water creeps toward her
appears, running through the water, sending up geysers of spray
He pelts past her without slowing, his eyes crazed
Help me
We need help
He doesn't look back
It is like a bad dream
The hull gongs with terrifying sounds
The lights flicker and go out, leaving utter darkness

Then they come back on
She finds herself hyperventilating
That one moment of blackness was the most terrifying of her life
runs around the nearest corner, his arms full of lifebelts
He is upset to see someone still in his section
He grabs her forcefully by the arm, pulling her with him like a wayward child
Come on, then, let's get you topside, miss, that's right
Wait
Wait

There's-- No need for panic, miss
Come along
No, let me go
You're going the wrong way
He's not listening
And he won't let her go
She  in his ear, and when he turns, she punches him squarely in the nose
Shocked, he lets her go and staggers back
To Hell with you
See you there, buster
The steward runs off, holding his bloody nose
She spits after him
Just the way Jack taugh: her
She turns around, : a glass case with a fire-axe in it
She breaks the glass with a battered suitcase which is lying discarded nearby, and seizes the axe, running back the way she came
192    she looks down and gasps
The water has flooded the bottom five steps
She goes down and has to crouch to look along the corridor to the room where Jack is trapped
Rose plunges into the water, which is up to her waist
and powers forward, holding the axe above her head in two hands
She grimaces at the pain from the literally freezing water
: 193 Jack has climbed up on the bench, and is hugging the waterpipe
Rose wades in, holding the axe above her head
Will this work
We'll find out
They are both terrified, but trying to keep panic at bay
He positions the chain connecting the two cuffs, stretching it taut across the steel pipe
The chain is of course very short, and his exposed wrists are on either side of it
Try a couple practice swings
Rose hefts the axe and thunks it into a wooden cabinet
Now try to hit the same mark again
She swings hard and the blade thunks in four inches from the mark
Okay, that's enough practice
He winces, bracing himself as she raises the axe
She has to hit a target about an inch wide with all the foce she can muster, with his hands on either side
(sounding calm) You can do it, Rose
Hit it as hard as you can,  trust you
Jack closes his eyes
So does she
The axe comes down

Rose gingerly opens her eyes looks
Jack is grinning with two separate cuffs
Rose drops the axe, all the strength going out of her
Nice work, there, Paul Bunyan
He climbs down into the water next to her
He can't breathe for a second
Shit
Excuse my French
Ow ow ow, that is cold

That's White Star Line property-- (turning together) Shutup

They join the steerage stragglers going aft
In places the corridor is almost completely blocked by large families carrying all their luggage

Here, lass, cover yerself
Jack rubs her arms and tries to warm her up as they walk along

The crewmen and stewards push them back, shoving and punching them
#2 Get back
Get back you lot
(to the crewmen) Lock it
They struggle to get the gate closed again, while Steward #2 brandishes a small revolver
Another holds a fire axe
They lock the gate, and a cry goes up among the crowd, who surge forward, pounding against the steel and shouting in several languages
For the love of God, man, there are children down here
Let us up, so we can have a chance
But the crewmen are scared now
They have let the situation get out of hand, and now they have a mob
Tommy gives up and pushes his way back through the crowd, going down the stairs
He rejoins Jack, Rose and Fabrizio
It's hopeless that way
Well, whatever we're goin' to do, we better do it fast
Fabrizio turns to Helga, praying he can make himself understood
(with a lot of hand gestures) Everyone
all of you
come with me now
We go to the boats
We go to the boats
Capito
Come now
They can't understand what he's saying
They can see his urgency, but , the patriarch of the family, shakes his head
He will not panic, and will not let his family go with this boy
Fabrizio turns to Helga
Helga
per favore
please
come with me,  am lucky
Is my destiny to go to America
She kisses him, then steps back to be with her family
Jack lays a hand on his shoulder, his eyes saying "Let's go"
will never forget you
He turns to Jack, who leads the way out of the crowd
Looking back Fabrizio sees her face disappear into the crowd

past a woman arguing heatedly with a man in Serbo-Croatian, a wailing child next to them
past a man kneeling to console a woman who is just sitting on the floor, sobbing
and past another man with an English/Arabic dictionary, trying to figure out what the signs mean, while his wife and children wait patiently
Jack et al come upon a narrow stairwell and they go up two decks before they are stopped by a small group pressed up against a steel gate
The steerage men are yelling at a scared
Go to the main stairwell, with everyone else
It'll all get sorted out there
Jack takes one look at this scene and finally just loses it
God damn it to Hell son of a bitch
He grabs one end of a bench bolted to the floor on the landing
He starts pulling on it, and Tommy and Fabrizio pitch in until the bolts shear and it breaks free
Rose figures out what they are doing and clears a path up the stairs between the waiting people
Move aside
Quickly, move aside
Jack and Tommy run up the steps with the bench and with all their strength
It rips loose from its track and falls outward, narrowly mssing the steward
Led by Jack, the crowd surges though
Rose steps up to the cowering steward and says in her most imperious tone: If you have any intention of keeping your pathetic job () (') with the White Star Line,  suggest you escort these good people to the boat deck

We're too late
There are still some boats forward
Stay with this one
Murdoch
He seems to be quite
practical
215     there is another panic
Boat 13, already in the water but still attached to its falls, is pushed aft by the discharge water being pumped out of the ship
It winds up directly under boat 15, which is coming downt he right on top of it
The passengers shout in panic to the crew above to stop lowering
They are ignored
Some men put their hands up, trying futilely to keep the 5 tons of boat 15 from crushing them
Fred Barrett, the stoker, gets out his knife and leaps to the after falls, climbing rudely over people
He cuts the aft falls while another crewman cuts the forward lines

Someone has released the pets from the kennels

Colonel
Are there any boats left
(staring at her bedraggled state) Yes, miss
there are still a couple of boats all the way forward
This way, 'll lead you
Jack grabs her hand and they sprint past Gracie, with Tommy and Fabrizio close behind

The crowd is sparse, with most people still aft
Cal slips his hand out of hte pocket of his overcoat and into the waist pocket of Murdoch's greatcoat, leaving the stacks of bills there
So we have an understanding then

Cal, satisfied, steps back
He finds himself waiting next to

Ismay does not meet his eyes, nor anyone's
Lovejoy come sup to Cal at that moment

She's just over on the port side

Women and children
Any more women and children

Cal looks longingly at his boat
his moment has arrived
God damn it to hell
Come on
He and Lovejoy head for the port side, taking a short-cut through the bridge

Even with Jack's arms wrapped around her, Rose is shivering in the cold
Near her a  with    looks into the eyes of a she knows she may not see again Goodbye for a little while

The woman stumbles to the boat with the children, hiding her tears from them
Beneath the false good cheer, the man is choked with emotion
Hold mummy's hand and be a good girl
That's right
Some of the women are stoic, others are overwhelmed by emotion and have to be helped into the boats

Please get this to my wife in DeMoines, Iowa
Jack looks at Tommy and Fabrizio
You better check out the other side
They nod and run off, searching for a way around the deckhouse

Get in the boat, Rose
Cal walks up just then
Yes
Get in the boat, Rose
She is shocked to see him
She steps instinctively to Jack
Cal looks at her, standing there shivering in her wet slip and stockings, a shocking display in 1912
My God, look at you
(taking off his boat) Here, put this on
She numbly shrugs into it
He is doing it for modesty, not the cold
Quickly, ladies
Step into the boat
Hurry, please
Go on
'll get the next one
No
Not without you
She doesn't even care that Cal is standing right there
He sees the emotion between Jack and Rose and his jaw clenches
But then he leans close to her and says
(low) There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in
Jack and  can get off safely
Both of us
(he smiles reassuringly) 'll be alright
Hurry up so we can get going
we got our own boat to catch
Get in

Lightoller grabs her arm and pulls her toward the boat
She reaches out for Jack and her fingers brush his for a moment
Then she finds herself stepping down into the boat
It's all a rush and blur
Lower away
The two men watch at the rail as the boat begins to descend
(low) You're a good liar
Almost as good as you
always win, Jack
One way or another

It's going to be worth a lot more by morning
Jack knows he is screwed

All sound going away
Lightoller giving orders, his lips moving

this cannot be happening
a rocket bursts above in slow-motion, outlining Jack in a halo of light
Rose's hair blowing in slow motion as she gazes up at him, descending away from him
she sees his hand trembling, the tears at the corners of his eyes, and cannot believe the unbearable pain she is feeling
Rose is still staring up, tears pouring down her face
She lunges across the women next to her
Reaches the gunwale, climbing it
Hurls herself out of the boat to the rail of the -Deck promenade, catching it, and scrambling over the rail
The Boat 2 continues down
But Rose is back on Titanic
No Rose
Jack spins from the rail, running for the nearest way down to -Deck
Hockley too has seen her jump
She is willing to die for this man, this gutter scum
He is overwhelmed by a rage so all consuming it eclipses all thought

He sees her coming into -deck foyer, running toward him, Cal's long coat flying out behind her as she runs
They meet at the bottom of the stairs, and collide in an embrace
Rose, Rose, you're so stupid, you're such an idiot-- And all the while he's kissing her and holding her as tight as he can
You jump,  jump, right
Right
Hockley comes in and runs to the railing
Looking down he sees them locked in their embrace

Cal fires again, running down the steps toward them
bullet blows a divet out of the oak panelling behind Jack's head as he pulls Rose down the next flight of stairs
Hockley steps on the skittering head of the cherub statue and goes sprawling
The gun clatters across the marble floor
He gets up, and reeling drunkenly goes over to retrieve it

Jack and Rose come down the stairs two at a time and run straight into the water, fording across the room to where the floor slopes up, until they reach dry footing at the entrance to the dining saloon

He  twice
Big gouts of spray near them, but he's not a great shot
The water boils up around his feet and he retreast up the stairs a couple of steps
Around him the woodward groans and creaks

Lovejoy arrives next to him
Cal suddenly remembers something and starts to laugh
What could possible be funny
put the diamond in my coat pocket
And  put my coat
on her
He turns to Lovejoy with a sickly expression, his eyes glittering

if you can get it
He hands Lovejoy the pistol and goes back up the stairs
Lovejoy thinks about it
then slogs into the water
The icewater is up to his waist as he crosses the pool into the dining saloon

It is a sea of tables, and they could be anywhere
silver serving tolley rolls downhill, bumping into tables and pillars

Monstrous groans echo through the ship

They see the water advancing toward them, swirling over the floor
They crawl ahead of it to the next row of tables

He moves off as-- Lovejoy moves over one row and looks along the tables
Nothing

He moves another row

It starts to roll down the aisle between tables
as the cart rolls toward her
It hits a table and the stacks of dishes topple out,  across the floor and showering her
She scrambles out of the way and-- Lovejoy spins, seeing her
He moves rapidly toward her, keeping the gun aimed-- That's when Jack tackles him from the side
They slam together into a table, crashing over it, and toppling to the floor
They land in the water which is flowing rapidly between the tables
Jack and Lovejoy grapple in the icy water
Jack jams his knee down on Lovejoy's hand, breaking his grip on the pistol, and kicks it away
Lovejoy scrmbles up and lunges at him, but Jack  him right in the solar plexus, doubling him over
Compliments of the Chippewa Falls Dawsons
He grabs Lovejoy and slams him into an ornate columb
Lovejoy drops to the floor with a splas, stunned
Let's go

We can't leave him
Jack nods and they leave the promise of escape up the stairwell to run to the child
Jack scoops up the kid and they run back to the stairs but-- torrent of water comes pouring down the stairs like rapids
In seconds it is too powerful for them to go against
Come on
Charging the other way down the flooding corridor, they blast up spray with each footstep
At the end of the hall are heavy double doors
As Jack approaches them he sees water spraying through the gap between the doors right up to the ceiling
The doors groan and start to crack under the tons of pressure
Back
Go back
Rose pivots and runs back the way they came, taking a turn into a cross-corridor

In seconds it is up to their waist
Help us

Fucking 'ell
He runs back, slogging against the curretn
He pulls a key ring from his belt and struggles to unlock the padlock as the water fountains up around them

The water rises over the lock and he's doing it by feel

The pressure from behind pushes them forward, and one guy falls off the edge of the deck into the water less than ten feet below
Give us a chance to live, you limey bastards
Murdoch fires his Webley twice in the air, then point it at the crowd

Murdoch  the first man, and seeing Tommy coming forward, puts a bullet into his chest
Tommy collapses, and Fabrizio grabs him, holding him in his arms as his life flows out over the deck
Murdoch turns to his men and salutes smartly
Then he puts the pistol to his temple and
He drops like a puppet with the strings cut and topples over the edge of the boat deck into the water only a few feet below
Cal stares in horror at Murdoch's body bobbing in the black water
The out of the pocket of his greatcoat, the bills spreading across the surface

Andrews

One by one the band memebers turn, hearing the lonely melody
Without a word they walk back and take their places
They join in with Hartley, filling out the sound so that it reaches all over the ship on this still night
The vocalist begins: "If in my dreams  be, nearer my God to thee

Underwater he struggles to free himself, and then kicks back to the surface

Bert Cartmell shakes the gate futilely, shouting for help
Little Cora wails as the water boils up around them all
: 256 Rose and Jack struggle to climb the well deck stairs as the ship tilts
Drunk Baker Joughin puts a hand squarely on Rose's butt and shoves her up onto the deck
Sorry, miss
Hundreds of people are already on the poop deck, and more are pouring up every second
Jack and Rose cling together as tehy struggle across the tilting deck
257 As the bow goes down, the
2, which is just off the stern, passengers gape as the giant bronze propellers rise out of the water like gods of the deep,   behind them
People are  from the well deck, the poop deck, the gangway doors
Some hit debris in the water and are hurt or killed
258 259 260 Jack and Rose struggle aft as the angle increases
Hundreds of passengers, clinging to every fixed object on deck, huddle on their knees around  , who has his voice raised in prayer
They are praying, sobbing, or just staring at nothing, their minds blank with dread
Pulling himself from handhold to handhold, Jack tugs Rose aft along the deck
Come on, Rose
We can't expect God to do all the work for us
They struggle on, pushing through the praying people
loses his footing ahead and slides toward them
Jack helps him
261   are twenty feet above the water and rising faster
262    make it to the stern rail, right at the base of the flagpole
They grip the rai, jammed in between other people
It is the spot where Jack pulled her back onto the ship, just two night
and a liftime
ago
Above the wailing and sobbing, Father Byles' voice carries, cracking with emotion
and  saw new heavens and a new earth
The former heavens and the former earth had passed away and the sea was no longer
The lights flicker, threatening to go out
Rose grips Jack as the stern rises into a night sky ablaze with stars
also saw a new Jerusalem, the holy city coming down out of heaven from God, beautiful as a bride prepared to meet her husband
heard a loud voice from the throne ring out this is God's dwelling among men
He shall dwell with them and they shall be his people and He shall be their God who is alway with them
Rose stares about her at the faces of the doomed
Near them are the , clinging together stoically
Helga looks at her briefly, and her eyes are infinitely sad
Rose sees a young mother next to her, clutching her five year old son, who is crying in terror
Shhh
Don't cry
It'll be over soon, darling
It'll all be over soon
He shall wipe every tear from their eyes
And there shall be no more death or mourning, crying out or pain, for the former world has passed away
: -- As the ship tilts further everything not bolted down inside shifts
263  burst open in the pantry showering the floor with tons of china
slides across the floor, crashing into a wall tumbles across the Smoking Room floor
264   -  passengers lose their grip and slide down the wooden deck like a bobsled run, hundreds of feet before they hit the water
, Rose's maid, slips as she struggles along the railing and slides away screaming
265    the propellers are 100 feet out of the water and rising
Panicking people leap from the poop deck rail, fall screaming and hit the water like mortar rounds
man falls from the poop deck, hitting the bronze hub of the starboard propeller with a sickening smack
266    and see the stern towering over them like a monolith, the propellers rising against the stars
110 feet
120
267     a man jumps
we fall seemingly forever, right past one of the giant screws
The water rushes up-- : /  6 268    on Ruth as the sounds of the dying ship and the screaming people come across the water
269  /  :     we see the spectacle of the Titanic, her lights blazing, reflecting in the still water
Its stern is high in the air, angles up over forty five degrees
The propellers are 150 feet out of the water
Over a thousand passengers cling to the decks, looking from a distance like a swarm of bees
The image is shocking, unbelieveable, unthinkable
Ruth stares at the spectacle, unable to frame it or put it into any proportion
God Almighty
The great liner's lights flicker
: 270 In darkness Chief Engineer Bell hangs onto a pipe at the master braker panel
Around him men climb through tilted cyclopean mahcines with electric hand-torches
It is a black hell of breaking pipes, spraying water, and groaning machinery threatening to tear right out of its bedplates
Water sprays down, hitting the breaker panel, but Bell will not leave his post
The breakers kick
He slams them in again and--
a blast of light
Something melts and arcing fills the engine room with nightmarish light-- : 271 The lights go out all over the ship
Titanic becomes a vast black silhouette against the stars
:   has his back to the ship, unable to watch the great steamer die
He is catatonic with remorse, his mind overloaded
He can avert his eyes, but he can't block out the sounds of dying people and machinery
loud   comes across the water
: 272 Near the third funnel a man clutches the ship's rail
He stares down as the right between his feet
yawning chasm opens with a  of breaking steel is clutching the railing on the roof of the Officers' Mess
He watches in horror as the ship's structure   right in front of him
He gapes down into a widening maw, seeing straight down into the bowels of the ship, amid a   like the sound of artillery
People falling into the widening crevasse look like dolls
The stay cables on the funnel part and snap across the decks like whips, ripping off davits and ventilators
man is hit by a whipping cable and snatched
Another cable smashes the rail next to Lovejoy and it rips free
He falls backward into the pit of jagged metal
Fires, explosions and sparks light the yawning chasm as the hull splits down through nine decks to the keel
The sea pours into the gaping wound-- : 273 It is a thundering black hell
Men scream as monstrous machinery comes apart around them, steel frames twisting like taffy
Their torches illuminate the roaring, foaming demon of water as it races at the through the manchines
Trying to climb they are overtaken in seconds
: 274
- The   of the ship, almost four hundred feet long, falls back toward the water
On the poop deck everyone screams as they feel themselves plummeting
The sound goes up like the roar of fans at a baseball stadium when a run is scored
Swimming in the water directly under the stern a few unfortunates shriek as they see the keel coming down on them like God's bootheel
The massive stern section falls back almost level, thundering down into the sea and pushing out a mighty wave of displaced water
Jack and Rose struggle to hole onto the stern rail
They feel the ship seemingly
Some of those praying think it is salvation
We're saved
Jack looks at Rose and shakes his head, grimly
Now the horrible mechanics play out
Pulled down by the awesome weight of the flooded bow, the buoyant stern tilts up rapidly
They feel the as the fantail angles up again
Everyone is clinging to benches, railings, ventilators
anything to keep from sliding as the stern lifts
The stern goes up and up, past 45 degrees, then past sixty
People start to fall, sliding and tumbling
They skid down the deck, screaming and flailing to grab onto somehting
They wrench other people loose and pull them down as well
There is a pile-up of bodies at the forward rail
The   falls one by one
We have to move
He climbs over the stern rail and reaches back for Rose
She is terrified to move
He grabs her hand
Come on
've got you
Jack pulls her over the rail
It is the same place he pulled her over the rail two nights earlier, going the other direction
She gets over just as the railing is going , and the deck
Jack grips her fiercely
The stern is now straight up in the air
a rumbling black monolith standing against the stars
It hangs there like that for a long grace note, its buoyancy stable
Rose lies on the railing, looking down fifteen stories to the boiling sea at the base of the stern section
People near them, who didn't climb over, hang from the railing, their legs dangling over the long drop
They fall one by one, plummeting down the vertical face of the poop deck
Some of them bounce horribly off deck benches and ventilators
Jack and Rose lie side by side on what was the vertical face of the hull, gripping the railing, which is now horizontal
Just beneath their feet are the gold letters  emblazoned across the stern
Rose stares down terrified at the black ocean waiting below to claim them
Jack looks to his left and sees Baker Joughin, crouching on the hull, holding onto the railing
It is a surreal moment
(nodding a greeting) Helluva night
The final relentless plunge begins as the stern section floods
Looking down a hundred feet to the water, we drop like an elevator with Jack and Rose
(talking fast) Take a deep breath and hold it right before we go into the water
The ship will suck us down
Kick for the surface and keep kicking
Don't let go of my hand
We're gonna make it Rose
Trust me
She stares at the water coming up at them, and grips his hand harder
trust you
Below them the poop deck is disappearing
The plunge gathers speed
the boiling surface engulfs the docking bridge and then rushes up the last thirty feet
278    , we see the stern descend into the boiling sea
The name disappears, and the tiny figures of Jack and Rose vanish under the water
Where the ship stood, now there is nothing
Only the black ocean
: 279
/ Bodies are whirled and spun, some limp as dolls, others struggling spasmodically, as the vortex sucks them down and tumbles them
280 Jack rises
kicking hard for the surface
holding tightly to Rose, pulling her up
281   : a roiling chaos of screaming, thrashing people
Over a thousand people are now floating where the ship went down
Some are stunned, gasping for breath
Others are crying, praying, moaning, shouting
screaming
Jack and Rose surface among them
They barely have time to gasp for air before people are clawing at them
People driven insane by the water, 4 degrees below freezing, a cold so intense it is indistinguishable form death by fire
man pushes Rose under, trying to climb on top of her
senselessly trying to get out of the water, to climb onto anything
Jack  him repeatedly, pulling her free
Swim, Rose
She tries, but her strokes are not as effective as his because of her lifejacket
They break out of the clot of people
He has to find some kind of flotation, anything to get her out of the freezing water
Keep swimming
Keep moving
Come one, you can do it
All about them there is a tremendous wailing, screaming and moaning
a chorus of tormented souls
And beyond that
nothing but black water stretching to the horizon
The sense of isolation and hopelessness is overwhelming
: 282 283 Jack strokes rhythmically, the effort keeping him from freezing
Look for something floating
Some debris
wood
anything
It's so cold
know
know
Help me, here
Look around
His words keep her focused, taking her mind off the wailing around them
Rose scans the water, panting, barely able to draw a breath
She turns and
is right in from of her face
It is the black  , swimming right at her like a seamonster in the darkness, its coal eyes bugging
It motors past her, like it is headed for Newfoundland
Beyond it Rose sees somehting in the water
What's that
Jack sees what she is pointing to, and they make for it together
It is a piece of wooden debris, intricately carved
He pushes her up and she slithers onto it belly down
But when Jack tries to get up onto the thing, it tilts and submerges, almost dumping Rose off
It is clearly only big enough to support her
He clings to it, close to her, keeping his upper body out of the water as best he can
Their breath floats around them in a cloud as they pant from exertion swims toward them, homing in on the piece of debris
Jack warns him back
It's just enough for this lady
you'll push it under
Let me try at least, or 'll die soon
You'll die quicker if you come any closer
Yes,  see
Good luck to you then
(swimming off) God bless
: 284
/ The boat is overloaded and half-flooded
Men cling to the sides in the water
Others, swimming, are drawn to it as their only hope
Cal, standing in the boat, slaps his oar in the water as a warning
Stay back
Keep off
Fabrizio, exhausted and near the limit, makes it almost to the boat
Cal with the oar, cutting open his scalp
You don't
understand
have
to get
to America
(pointing with the oar) It's that way
as he floats, panting each breath agony
You see the spirit leave him
' : Cal in  , yelling and wielding the oar
demon in a tuxedo
The image fades to black
: 285 still float amid a chorus of hte damned
Jack sees the ship's officer nearby,
He is blowing his whistle furiously, knowing the sound will carry over the water for miles
The boats will come back for us, Rose
Hold on just a little longer
They had to row away for the suction and now they'll be coming back
She nods, his words helping her
She is shivering uncontrollably, her lips blue and her teeth chattering
Thank God for you Jack
People are still screaming, calling to the lifeboats
Come back
Please
We know you can hear us
For God's sake
Please
help us
Save one life

/ 6: Ruth has her ears covered against the wailing in the darkness
The first class women in the boat sit, stunned, listening to the sounds of hundreds screaming
They'll pull us right down  tell ya
Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me
Come on girls, grab your oars
Let's go
(nobody moves) Well come on
The women won't meet her eyes
They huddle into their ermine wraps
don't understand a one of you
What's the matter with you
It's your men back there
We got plenty a' room for more
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat
Ruth keeps her ears covered and her eyes closed, shutting it all out
287   : Sir Cosmo and Lucile Duff-Gordon sit with ten other people in a boat that is two thirds empty
They are two hundred yards from the screaming in the darkness
We should do something
Lucile squeezes Cosmo's hand and pleads him with her eyes
She is terrified
It's out of the question
The crewmembers, intimidated by a nobleman, acquiesce
They hunch guiltily, hoping the sound will stop soon
, most half full, float in the darkness
None of them make a move
: 288 Jack and Rose drift under the blazing stars
The water is glassy, with only the faintest undulating swell
Rose can actually see the stars reflecting on the black mirror of the sea
Jack squeezes the water out of her long coat, tucking it in tightly around her legs
He rubs her arms
His face is chalk with in the darkness
low in the darknes around them
It's getting quiet
Just a few more minutes
It'll take them a while to get the boats organized
Rose is unmoving, just staring into space
She knows the truth
There won't be any boats
Behind Jack she sees that Officer Wilde has stopped moving
He is slumped in his lifejacket, looking almost asleep
He has died of exposure already
don't know about you, but  intend to write a strongly worded letter to the White Star Line about all this
She laughs weakly, but it sounds like a gasp of fear
Rose finds his eyes in the dim light
love you Jack
He takes her hand
No
don't say your good-byes, Rose
Don't you give up
Don't do it
'm so cold
You're going to get out of this
you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed
Not here
Not this night
Do you understand me
can't feel my body
Rose, listen to me
Listen
Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me
Jack is having trouble getting the breath to speak
It brought me to you
And 'm thankful, Rose
'm thankful
His voice is trembling with the cold which is working tis way to his heart
But his eyes are unwavering
You must do me this honor
promise me you will survive
that you will never give up
no matter what happens
no matter how hopeless
promise me now, and never let go of that promise
promise
Never let go
promise
will never let go, Jack
'll never let go
She grips his hand and they lie with their heads together
It is quiet now, except for the lapping of the water

/  - Fifth Officer Lowe, the impetuous young Welshman, has gotten Boats 10, 12 and Collapsible  together with his own Boat 14
demon of energy, he's had everyone hold the boats together and is transferring passengers from 14 into the others, to empty his boat for a rescue attempt
As the women step gingerly across the other boats, Lowe sees a shawled figure in too much of a hurry
He rips the shawl off, and finds himself staring into the face of a man
He angrily shoves the stowaway into another boat and turns to his crew of three
Right, man the oars
: 290
/  14 The beam of an electric torch plays across the water like a searchlight as boat 14 comes toward us
as the torch illuminates floating debris, a poignant trail of flotsam: a violin, a child's wooden soldier, a framed photo of a steerage family
Daniel Marvin's wooden Biograph camera
Then, their white lifebelts bobbing in the darkness like signoposts, the first bodies come into the torch's beam
The people are dead but not drowned, killed by the freezing water
Some look like they could be sleeping
Others stare with frozen eyes at the stars
Soon bodies are so thick the seamen cannot row
They hit the oars on the heads of floating men and women
a wooden thunk
One seaman throws up
Lowe sees a mother floating with her arms frozen around her lifeless baby
(the worst moment of his life) We waited too long
: 291 we see Jack and Rose floating in the black water
The stars reflect in the mill pond surface, and the two of them seem to be floating in interstellar space
They are absolutely still
Their hands are locked together
Rose is staring upwards at the canopy of stars wheeling above her
The music is transparent, floating
as the long sleep steals over Rose, and she feels peace
Rose's face
Pale, like the faces of the dead
She seems to be floating in a void
Rose is in a semi-hallucinatory state
She knows she is dying
Her lips barely move as she sings a scrap of Jack's song: "Come Josephine in my flying machine
" ' : The stars
Like you've never seen them
The Milky Way a glorious band from horizon to horizon
flares
a line of light across the heavens
again
We see that her hair is dusted with frost crystals
Her breathing is so shallow, she is almost motionless
Her eyes track down from the stars to the water
'
: The silhouetter of a boat crossing the stars
She sees men in it, rowing so slowly the oars lift out of the syrupy water, leaving weightless pearls floating in the air
The  of the men sound slow and
Then the lookout flashes his torch toward her and the light flares across the water, silouetting the bobbing corpses in between
It flicks past her motionless form and moves on
The boat is 50 feet away, and moving past her
The men look away
Rose lifts her head to turn to Jack
We see that her hair has frozen to the wood under her
(barely audible) Jack
She touches his shoulder with her free hand
He doesn't respond
Rose gently turns his face toward her
It is rimed with frost
He seems to be sleeping peacefully
But he is not asleep
Rose can only stare at his still face as the realization goes through her
Oh, Jack
All hope, will and spirit leave her
She looks at the boat
It is further away now, the voices fainter
Rose watches them go
She closes her eyes
She is so weak, and there just seems to be no reason to even try
And then
her eyes snap open
She raises her head suddenly, cracking the ice as she rips her hair off the wood
She calls out, but her voice is so weak they don't hear her
The boat is invisible now, the torch light a star impossibly far away
She struggles to draw breath, calling again
292    Lowe hears nothing behind him
He points to something ahead, turning the tiller
293  struggles to move
Her hand, she realizes, is actually frozen to Jack's
She breaths on it, melting the ice a little, and gently unclasps their hands, breaking away a thin tinkling film
won't let go
promise
She releases him and he sinks into the black water
He seems to fade out like a spirit returning to some immaterial plane
Rose rolls off the floating staircase and plunges into the icy water
She swims to Chief Officer Wilde's body and grabs his whistle
She starts to with all the strength in her body
Its sound slaps across the still water
294   14 Lowe whips around at the sound of the whistle
(turning the tiller) Row back
That way
Pull
Rose keeps blowing as the boat comes to her
She is still blowing when Lowe takes the whistle from her mouth as they haul her into the boat
She slips into uncosciousness and they scramble to cover her with blankets

Present day
Fifteen hundred people went into the sea when Titanic sank from under us
There were twenty boats floating nearby and only one came back
One
Six were saved from the water, myself included
Six out of fifteen hundred
As she speaks    slowly across the faces of Lizzy and the salvage crew on
Lovett, Bodine, Buell, the others
the reality of what happened here 84 years before has hit them like never before
With her story Rose has put them on Titanic in its final hours, and or the first time, they do feel like graverobbers
Lovett, for the first time, has even forgotten to ask about the diamond
Afterward, the seven hundred people in the boats had nothing to do but waith
wait to die, wait to live, wait for an absolution which would never come

Cal, sipping from a hip flask offered to him by a black-faced stoker
Ruth hugging herself, rocking gently

Only her face is visile, white as the moon
The man next to her jumps up, pointing and yelling
Soon everyone is looking and shouting excitedly
In Rose's  it is all silent, -  we see Lowe light a green flare and wave it as everyone shouts and cheers
Rose doesn't react
She floats beyond all human emotion

Rose watching, rocked by the sea, her face blank
seamen helping survivors up the rope ladder to the Carpathia's gangway doors
two women crying and hugging each other inside the ship
,   -
There is just music, so gentle and sad, part elegy, part hymn, part aching song of love lost forever
to music
Rose, outside of time, outside of herself, coming into Carpathia, barely able to stand
Rose being draped wtih warm blankets and given hot tea
climbing aboard
He has the face and eyes of a damned soul
As Ismay walks along the hall, guided by a crewman toward the doctor's cabin, he passes rows of seated and standing widows
He must run the gauntlet of their accusing gazes
: 300
/  - It is the afternoon of the 15th
Cal is searching the faces of the widows lining the deck, looking for Rose
The deck of Carpathia is crammed with huddled people, and even the recovered lifeboats of Titanic
On a hatch cover sits an enormous pile of lifebelts
He keeps walking toward the stern
Seeing Cal's tuxedo, a steward approaches him
You won't find any of your people back here, sir
It's all steerage
Cal ignores him and goes amongst this wrecked group, looking under shawls and blankets at one bleak face after another
Rose is sipping hot tea
Her eyes focus on him as he approaches her
He barely recognizes her
She looks like a refugee, her matted hair hanging in her eyes
Yes,  lived
How awkward for you
Rose
your mother and  have been looking for you-- She holds up her hand, stopping him
Please don't
Don't talk
Just listen
We will make a deal, since that is something you understand
From this moment you do not exist for me, nor for you
You shall not see me again
And you will not attempt to find me
In return  will keep my silence
Your actions last night need never come to light, and you will get to keep the honor you have carefully purchased
She fixes him with a glare as cold and hard as the ice which changed their lives
Is this in any way unclear
(after a long beat) What do  tell your mother
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic
She stands, turning to the rail
Dismissing him
We see Cal stricken with emotion
You're precious to me, Rose
Jewels are precious
Goodbye, Mr
Hockley
We see that in his way, the only way he knows, he does truly love her
After a moment, he turns and walks away
(
) That was the last time  ever saw him
He married, of course, and inherited his millions
The crash of 28 hit his interests hard, and he put a pistol in his mouth that year
His children fought over the scraps of his estate like hyenas, or so  read

It is just as Fabrizio saw it, so clearly, in his mind
302      at the Cunard pier, Pier 54
Over 30,000 people line the dock and fill the surrounding streets
The magnesium flashes of the photographers go off like small bombs, lighting an amazing tableau
Several hundred police keep the mob back
The dock is packes with friends and reletives, officials, ambulances, and the press-- Reporters and photographers swarm everywhere
6 deep at the foot of the gangways, lining the tops of cars and trucks
it is the 1912 equicalent of a media circus
They jostle to get close to the survivors, tugging on them as they pass and shouting over each other to ask them questions
Rose is covered with a whoollen shawl and walking with a group of steerage passengers
Immigration officers are asking them questions as they come off the gangway
Name
Dawson
Rose Dawson
The officer steers her toward a holding area for processing
Rose walks forward with the dazed immigrants
The
of photographer's magnesium flashes cause them to flinch, and the glare is blinding
There is a sudden disturbance near her as two men burst through the cordon, running to embrace an older woman along the survivors, who cries out with joy
The reporters converge on this emotional scene, and flashes explode
Rose uses this moment to slip away into the crowd
She pushes through the jostling people, moving with purpose, and none challenges her in the confusion

If a mindless insect can do it, why couldn't

/ Old Rose sits with the group in the Imaging Shack, lit by the blue glow of the screens
She holds the haircomb with the jade butterfly on the handle in her gnarled hands
We never found anything on Jack
There's no record of him at all
No, there wouldn't be, would there
And 've never spoken of him until now, not to anyone
(to Lizzy) Not even your grandfather
woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets
But now you all know there was a man named Jack Dawson, and that he saved me, in every way that a person can be saved

There is music and some of the (co-ed) Russian crew are dancing
Bodine is getting drunk in the aggressive style of Baker Joughin
Lovett stands at the rail, looking down into the black water
Lizzy comes to him, offering him a beer
She puts her hand on his arm
'm sorry
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time
Lovett notices a figure move through the lights far down at the stern of the ship
Oh shit
: 307 Rose walks through the shadows of the deck machinery
Her nightgown blows in the wind
Her feet are bare
Her hands are clutched at her chest, almost as if she is praying
running down the stairs from the top deck, hauling ass
reaches the sern rail
Her gnarled fingers wrap over the rail
Her ancient foot steps up on the gunwale
She pushes herself up, leaning forward
Over her shoulder, we see the black water glinting far below
run up behind her
Grandma, wait
Don't-- her head, looking at them
She turns further, and we see she has something in her hand, something she was about to drop overboard
It is the "Heart of the Ocean"
Lovett sees his holy grail in her hand and his eyes go wide
Rose keeps it over the railing where she can drop it anytime
Don't come any closer
You had it the entire time
:       walking away from Pier 54
The photographers' flashes go off like a battle behind her
She has her hands in her pockets
She stops, feeling something, and pulls out the necklace
She stares at it in amazement
, Rose smiles at Brock's incomprehension
The hardest part about being so poor, was being so rich
But every time though of selling it,  though of Cal
And somehow  always got by without his help
She holds it out over the water
Bodine and a couple of the other guys come up behind Lovett, reacting to what is in Rose's hand
Holy shit
Don't drop it Rose
(a fierce whisper) Rush her
(to Bodine) It's hers, you schmuck
(to her) Look, Rose,
don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is
we're not dealing with logic here,  know that
but please
think about this a second
have
came all the way here so this could go back where it belongs
The massive diamond glitters
Brock edges closer and holds out his hand
Just let me hold it in my hand, Rose
Please
Just once
He comes closer to her
It is reminiscent of Jack slowly moving up to her at the stern of Titanic
Surprisingly, she calmly places the massice stone in the palm of his hand, while still holding onto the necklace
Lovett gazes at the object of his quest
An infinity of cold scalpels glint in its blue depths
It is mesmerizing
It fits in his hand just like he imagined
My God
His grip tightens on the diamond
He looks up, meeting her gaze
Her eyes are suddenly infinitely wise and deep
You look for treasures in the wrong place, Mr
Lovett
Only life is priceless, and making each day count
His fingers relax
He opens them slowly
Gently she slips the diamond out of his hand
He feels it sliding away
Then, with an impish little grin, Rose tosses the necklace over the rail
Lovett gives a strangled cry and rushes to the rail in time to see it hit the water and disappear forever
Aww
That really sucks, lady
Brock Lovett goes through ten changes before he settles on a reaction He laughs until the tears come to his eyes
Then he turns to Lizzy
Would you like to dance
Lizzy grins at him and nods
Rose smiles
She looks up at the stars

Rose, circa 1920
She is at the beach, sitting on a horse at the surfline
The Santa Monica pier, with its rollercoaster is behind her
She is grinning, full of life
We   the last picture to Rose herself, warm in her bunk

She is very still
She could be sleeping, or maybe something else
: 310     looms like a ghost out of the dark
It is lit by a kind of moonlight, a light of the mind
We pass over the endless forecastle deck to the superstructure, moving faster than subs can move
almost like we are flying
, and the echoing sound of distant waltz music is heard
The rust fades away from the walls of the dark corridor and it is transformed
onto the grand staircase, lit by glowing chandelier
The music is vibrant now, and the room is populated by men in tie and tails, women in gowns
It is exquisitely beautiful
we sweep down the staircase
The crowd of beautiful gentlmen and ladies turn as we descend toward them
At the bottom a man stands with his back to us
he turns and it is Jack
Smiling he holds his hand out toward us
Rose goes into his arms, a girl of 17
The passengers, officers and crew of the  Titanic smile and applaud in the utter silence of the abyss
