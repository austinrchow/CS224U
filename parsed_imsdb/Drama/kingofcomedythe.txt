: 1   :      - Behind the opening credits, we watch a montage of making his daily rounds as a messenger delivering manila envelopes and packages to various New York offices, always courteous and polite in his demeanor,  is an attractive-looking young man just past thirty and dressed in a stylish blue suit, broad tie and wide-collared shirt
His shoes are neatly polished, his hair carefully groomed
As the montage continues, we see that he has finished his deliveries and is walking rapidly towards his destination
It turns out to be a television theater north of Times Square whose marquee announces
It is dusk and the show is about to break
There is a very small crowd already positioned at the stage door -- a few young girls, a few curious passers-by who have stopped to see who will emerge
Three professional autograph hunters are clustered together: , a lady in her sixties, wears a red velvet dress, a lace hat and much too much rouge
is in his mid-twenties, tall, badly-complexioned, slicked hair but otherwise neatly dressed
He carries a brown lunch bag
is an enormously fat woman in her mid-thirties
She wears a large cape to conceal her obesity
middle-aged , dressed in a corduroy suit,    emerges from the backstage door which is guarded by a    large, white-haired
The non-professionals     in the crowd just peer at the  but  immediately    steps in front of him with her autograph book raised
(to the ) Are you somebody
No, honey, 'm just a working stiff
The  keep walking and  returns to her cohorts just as  arrives
Hi, Rupert
(coolly) Hello, Rupert
Who did you get
(distractedly) Nobody
carefully places himself near the door, a step or two away from the other professionals
(to ) got Mr
Raf Vallone outside 21
(to  about ) He'd never tell you anyway, Sidney
Then  got him again at the Pierre at four o'clock
Be a dear, Mae
don't happen to have Mr
Vallone
You know what  want for him
But  have only six Barbra's left
You know how difficult she is to work with
don't have her even once
(to ) Maybe Rupert would help you
shoots a hostile glance back at
Would you do that, Rupert
You don't feel about Barbra the way  do
'll give you Mr
Burt Reynolds too
(needling ) Look, Sidney, Rupert doesn't do that sort of thing
How about it, Rupert
'll give you whoever you want
starts pulling little white cards out of his paper bag and reading them off
Rodney    Dangerfield
Richard Harris
Liza Minelli
and she's    not so easy to work with either
Louise Lasser
You're wasting your time
has been trying to remain apart from the other three
Finally he turns to
Look, Sidney
'm just not interested
This isn't my whole life, you know
What's that supposed to mean -- that it's my whole life, or Sidney's or Mae's
It is so my whole life
Shut up, Mae
What about your mother
Isn't she part of your life
It's her whole life too
The show breaks
The doors swing open and people pour out
The crowd around the backstage door swells
(to the crowd) If you want Jerry's autograph, give me your piece of paper and 'll send it backstage
number of people in the crowd hand in pieces of paper
is standing next to a young couple, about college age
The   has just sent in her paper
(to the ) What are you going to do with Jerry's autograph
don't know
Maybe 'll sell it
'll tell you what she's going to do with it
She's going to pin it on her bulletin board and have an orgasm
The   laughs unself-consciously
: 's limousine waits directly in front of the stage door
has engaged the  who stands at the door of the car in conversation
(wearily) No, Mae
don't mean now
No, Mae
'll get right out
The , smiling, shakes his head
: plain-looking  in a black raincoat and black, floppy hat stands on the street side of the limousine, carefully watching  and the  talk
: But 've never been in one
We hear a cry as a celebrity emerges from the backstage door
turns and goes back towards the door
: The  is handing out the autographs
Suddenly emerges, flanked by three , husky young men in their early twenties dressed in theater uniforms
There is screaming and some yelling of 's name
pays no attention
Smiling nervously, he makes his way towards the limousine
The  stands at the rear of the car, holding the door
enters the car and then suddenly springs back
The  in the black raincoat and black hat has hidden herself in the back seat of the limousine
The three , who have already turned and headed back toward the theater, hear the commotion and swing around
The , who we shall come to know as , hides herself in the far end of the limo, so two of the  go around to the far side of the car and start pulling her out while the third moves into the limo from the street side
She fights like a wildcat, but the  slowly    manage to drag her out
During the struggle,      stands amid the crowd, a bit shaken
stands next to     him, staring at him
When finally catches 's eye,     smiles pleasantly
(to  who barely listens) How the hell did that girl get in there
Jesus, they certainly don't give you very good protection, do they
says nothing, glancing nervously at
Look at you here
Who the hell is watching you
Any one of these freaks could just walk right up to you and do whatever he wants
couple   are pressing against
Oh, Jerry
How can we get to talk to you
Just a minute
This is crazy
straightens up for action
(yelling at the crowd) Okay
Stand back
wades through the crowd towards the limousine, pushing  and  among others out of the way
follows in the path  is clearing
Didn't you hear me
Come on, people, have a heart
The  have succeeded in pulling the  out of the far door of the limo just as  and  arrive at the near door
The  has been blocked by the crowd from opening the door so  opens it
Stand back
(To )   Go ahead, Jerry
slips in quickly
He looks up at  who is holding the door, smiling pleasantly
Thanks
Thanks very much
stares at  for a moment and then slides into the limo next to him, closing the door behind him
2   :    - hate to bother you like this, Jerry, but could  speak to you for a minute
'd like to but
know you're a busy man
promise not to take very long, really
But  need your advice
looks down at his hand which has been badly scratched
You don't have a handkerchief, do you
Jesus, these people will kill you for a cufflink
hands him a monogrammed handkerchief, then checks his watch
Thanks
If you have to be somewhere, don't mind talking as we drive
You can drop me off anywhere
Sorry, but 've got a strict rule never to
put myself on the line for you, Jerry
Reluctantly,  signals with his head to his to start moving
As the car moves through New York traffic,  and  talk
Thanks, Jerry
'm grateful for this chance to talk to you
hope 'm not boring you
'll let you know
Really
Fine
'm      Rupert Pupkin, Jerry
know that the name    itself doesn't mean very much to you but    it means an awful lot to me, believe me
Maybe you've seen me outside your show and wondered who  am
Well, right now, 'm in communications but, by nature, 'm a stand-up comedian
know what you're thinking -- 'oh no
Not another one
' And  wouldn't take up even one minute of your time if  wasn't absolutely convinced of my talent
'm really good, Jerry, believe me, 'm dynamite
Now you're probably wondering if 'm so good why haven't you caught my act somewhere, right
Well
Well, up to now, 've been biding my time, developing my act slowly and carefully so that when my big break finally comes, 'm ready -- like you were that night Paar got sick and you sat in for him
was there that night, in the theater
That was the most important night of my life, until tonight, of course
fishes a cigarette case out of his jacket pocket, flips it open and offers one to
No thanks
don't smoke
returns the pack to his pocket
Me neither
just carry them as a courtesy
How about a cough drop
(smiling indulgently) No thanks
don't cough
try not to but sometimes, you know Am  making any sense
(smiling) Go on
Well, that night you did Paar,  walked out of the theater like  was in a dream
All of a sudden,  knew what  wanted
started catching your guest appearances on Sullivan and taping them and, when you got your own show, it got to be a kind of regular thing
studied how you built to your one-liners, nice and relaxed like you were chatting, and how you delivered the jokes without leaning too much on them, without saying "here's the punchline, folks
" And  watched the way you played off dead audiences, how you let those long silences build until people couldn't stand it and then the way you got them off the hook with that slow smile
You were my college of comedy, Jerry, like a kind of teacher, a friend
know it sounds crazy, but when you watch someone every night
But that's all in the past
What 'm trying to say is this
'm ready now
've finished the course
And 'm thinking as we sit here talking "Is this it
Is this that one big break
" Is it, Jerry
There is a long pause
Jerry
Look
er
what was the name
'm Rupert, Jerry
Look, Rupert
know what you're saying
But things don't work that way
You can't just walk onto a network show without any experience
You've got to start at the bottom
But that's where  am
You've got to work your way up, learn your trade in front of live audiences, start playing the little clubs
But that can take years, Jerry
Look at me
'm already 31 years old
People my age are way ahead of me
've got some catching up to do and  need your help
What do you say, Jerry
All 'm asking you to do is listen to my act
That's all
Is that asking too much
get calls from agents every day
All they want
tried getting an agent
did, Jerry
But you know how it is
You can't get an agent unless you're working and you can't get work unless you've got an agent
or unless you know somebody
And the only person  know is you, Jerry
There is a long pause
Look, why don't you call my office
Could
Oh,  knew you'd say that, Jerry
You don't know how many times 've had this conversation in my head
And this is the way it always turns out
That's why had to sort of invite myself into the car tonight
know it's kind of presumptuous and  really appreciate the time you've given me
But breaks like this don't just happen
You have to make your own breaks
The limousine starts slowing down as it pulls up before Plaza
It stops
gets out
follows

- turn to ,    looking to get rid of him as cleanly and gracefully as    possible
extends his hand
goes to     shake it but his hand is wrapped in the handkerchief
He     extends his left hand shakes it awkwardly
Nice meeting you, Rupert
hope it all works out for you
Thanks, Jerry
don't know how to repay you
'm a little short on cash this evening, but, if you don't mind some good, hearty food, 'd be honored to take you to dinner
Thanks, but some people are waiting for me
Oh,  understand
Well, then, maybe  could repay you with a joke
is starting to walk into the building
Wait a minute
How's this
The      first night you do your show from the coast,    you open this way
"Good evening, ladies    and gentlemen, it's great to be back    here in Southern California where you can wake up in the morning and listen to the birds coughing
" (nodding but unsmiling) Not bad
Maybe
calls after  who heads for the entrance to his building
Consider it a gift
Hey, Jerry
How about lunch
My treat
(turning back before he enters the building) Call my office
waves with his bandaged hand, notices 's handkerchief and unwraps it
(to the handkerchief) Thanks, Jerry
The    for a - of  in a kind of daze
: 4   :   '  - and  stand at the edge of the foyer, waiting for the Maitre d' to seat them
, the owner, spots them and hurries over
'm sorry, Mr
Langford
(To , angrily) How did you get in
That's alright, Vincent
Mr
Pupkin's a friend of mine
(puzzled) Oh,  see
That's alright
Now if you'd be good enough to find us a nice table
pushes a five dollar bill into 's hand
Certainly
This way, please
leads  and  to the "bullpen," a select spot in a corner of the restaurant
Here you are
Enjoy your lunch, gentlemen
Is Eddie here today, Vincent
'll send him over
arrives and hands them the menu
Our specialty today is Rizzofino Dolce Acqua a la Marinara con Spezi
Very good
Sounds like a new opera
Fine
What comes with it
Me
The three laugh
Fine
For two
Very good
The  leaves
You look tired, Jerry
It shows, does it
It's all these problems with the show
That and the custody suit
was sorry to read about that, Jerry
Charlene never should have gotten the kids
If there's anything  can do
appreciate it, Rube
Just talking about it a little with you helps
Eddie arrives
He     is a small, slightly-bald man with greying hair and a    goatee
He wears a foulard under an open-necked shirt
He carries a long sketch pad
He immediately sets up    a small easel and starts sketching
Hasn't Eddie already done you
Never mind
You were saying
Well, 've been giving a lot of thought to your situation, Jerry, ever since saw you starting to lose ground in the ratings
And  think  know what the problem is
Too many of the same faces
Yeah
Sure, people are getting tired of these people who live off game shows and talk shows and can't really do anything
They've seen 'em and heard 'em till they can't stand it anymore
You know, maybe you're right, Rube
'm sure  am
When a show runs out of surprises, it loses its audience
stands before  and
She hands her autograph book
What's your name, dear
Dolores
(writing) To Dolores, who sensed greatness
Rupert Pupkin
(reading it) Thanks, Mr
Pupkin
The  leaves
You see what  mean
What you need on the show is some unknown quantity, some brilliant talent making his television debut
Imagine the suspense
Who is this young guy
How will he do with the eyes of all America on him
Something like that has got to help
And that's where you come in
Why not
Believe me,     Jerry, 'd give you the credit you deserve    and 'll stick with you
Anytime you need     me, 'll be there, doing a few minutes at    Guild scale
'd be grateful, Rube
really would
All finished, Mr
Langford
turns the caricature so  and  can see it
It's a picture of the two of them, facing each other and smiling
Oh, Jerry, you sneaky
Looks good, Eddie
The  arrives with a bottle of champagne
What's this
Compliments of Mr
Sardi
hangs the picture of  and  on the wall behind them among the hundreds of other caricatures -- from Bankhead to Sid Caesar to Bette Davis
The over these
We hear the champagne pop
' How does your afternoon look
' What have you got in mind
' Well, we've still got time to catch the Cubs and the Mets out at Shea
' Why not
But first, a toast
To you, Rube and your success
' Thanks, Jerry
: 5   :
- Thanks, Jerry
takes 's handkerchief and folds it reverentially, tucking it carefully into his breast pocket
He claps his hands together a few times for joy and dashes into the street to hail a cab
: 6   :   ' enters his apartment
It is tasteful, modern, spacious and empty
floodlight shines on a single setting at the end of a long dinner table
He walks over to a large aquarium and sprinkles some food for the fish
(to the fish) Say hello to Jerry
On a shelf above the aquarium stand three pictures, one of two boys, roughly eight and eleven, flanked by a shot of each boy alone
walks to the end of the table where a covered dish and a New York Post await him
He lifts the covered dish which reveals a large, cold salmon
(to the fish) Say hello to Jerry
begins poking at the fish with his fork
The phone rings
He answers it
Yeah
' It's Marsha, Jerry
Did you get my note
left it on the back seat
Did you get it
dropped it there before they pulled me out
Those guys hurt me, Jerry
(pause) Jerry
(icily) Who gave you this number
' Don't be    angry with me, Jerry
didn't know what    else to do; 've been trying you every    five minutes,  miss you, baby
Jerry
hangs up the phone and then takes it off the receiver
Say goodbye to Jerry
He shakes his head wearily, returns to his dinner and turns to the inside pages of the New York Post
: 7    :        - cab pulls up in front of an all-night florist shop
dashes out of the cab and into the florist's
The cab waits
: 8    :        - dashes out of the florist's clutching a single red rose
He hops back into the cab which starts moving
: 9    :       - The cab pulls up in front of Gil's Steaks and Chops, a restaurant of little distinction that has a few checkered tableclothed tables in the rear and a long bar at the front
stares through the window of the bar at , the bargirl, an attractive, somewhat shopworn blonde in her late twenties
enters
: 10   :   - goes to the near end of the sparsely-populated bar
Miss
comes over
smiles knowingly
beer please, Miss
Something imported
Heineken's alright
Fine
serves him a Heineken's
She stares at him, searching his face
How have you been, Rita
She stares again
You're not Rupert Pupkin
smiles broadly
How the hell did you find me
Sally Gardner,  met her after a matinee
Aren't you glad to see me
Sure, sure
How is old Sally
The same,  guess
You know, two kids, a nice husband, living in Clifton
It figures
lot of the kids in our class have moved back
What are you doing here
just thought 'd say hello
Here, brought you a little something
(recognizing his style) Oh, yeah, Mr
Romance
Don't forget to put in an aspirin
It lasts longer
fills a glass of water and puts in the rose
Nothing's gonna keep it alive in this place
How have you been, dear, sweet Rita
don't have an aspirin
Maybe a Rolaids would work
pulls out a pack of Rolaids and hands one to who smiles vaguely and drops it into the glass
Well, what are you up to these days, Rupert
Didn't you know you'd see me again
You still going to the movies
You're looking as beautiful as ever
Oh, yeah
was a real knockout
thought so
Well, here  am
Local cheerleader makes good
voted for you for Most Beautiful
Yeah
didn't have the nerve to tell you then, but  guess it's alright now
Well, nothing terrible's gonna happen, if that's what you mean
There is an awkward pause
stares admiringly at Well, how are things with you, Rupert
Great
Everything's starting to break
Is that right
Yeah
As a matter of fact, that's why 'm here
've known about this place for a long time
just didn't want to make my move until  had something to offer you
Everything's a question of timing
stares at  as he rattles on
What's the matter
shakes her head in disbelief and chuckles
Jesus Christ, Rupert Pupkin
(smiling) The two of us are often confused
He's the one with the famous father
waits for a laugh
just keeps shaking her head
looks around
(critically) You like this place
shrugs
Why, you got something better
Maybe
What
What are you doing tonight
Tonight
starts laughing
(smiling reluctantly) What's so funny
(still laughing) You call me up all junior and    senior year
Night after night after night,    right
And every time 'm wondering 'when    is this guy going to stop talking and ask    me out
' Well, now  know the answer
August twelfth, nineteen seventy-six
It only took you ten, eleven years to    work up to it
If  had asked you out
Would you have gone
Oh, no
Why not
starts laughing again
Because  thought you were a jerk
You see
was right
But that guy isn't me anymore
look at my picture in the yearbook and  don't even recognize myself
'm not the same guy, Rita
bull-necked  in his early forties enters
He waves a brief hello to  as he walks by
smiles and the  takes a seat at the far end of the bar
Rita
(to ) Excuse me a minute, honey
'm not honey
'm Rupert
goes to the far end of the bar and serves the  a beer
They chat briefly as  watches uneasily
Finally  downs his beer and raises his glass
Miss
Miss
The  gets 's attention for
returns to  and serves him another beer
'm in the mood to celebrate tonight
Why don't we go to this nice restaurant know, talk over and times, get to know each other all over again
And then
Well, tomorrow night  thought we'd go out again, talk some more, get to know each other even better
How much
How much what
How much do we have to get to know each other
don't understand
(emphatically) How much do we have to get to know each other before we start talking about that job
'm not talking about any job
Then what's this big offer you were talking about
You'll see
Right now 'm asking you for a date
How about it
'm sorry, Rupert
But 'm busy
Busy
Yeah
Busy
But this is the biggest night of my life
've already got a date
The  at the end of the bar raises his glass
Rita
goes to the far end of the bar
She pours him another beer and settles against the bar, resuming her chat with him
looks for a moment and downs his beer
He raises his glass
Miss
Miss
returns to him
Is that your date
None of your business
What do you want to go out with him for
He's a good friend of mine
Tell him you're busy
What's so important about tonight
Everything
You don't understand
No

It's been really nice seeing you, Rupert
Thanks for dropping in
But 've got some work to do
leaves  and returns to the far end of the bar where she once again resumes talking with the sits for a moment, gets up slowly and heads for the john
11   :     - He enters the john and goes to the farthest of the three urinals
moment later, the  enters
He goes to the nearest of the three urinals
The two men stare at the wall before them but the obvious tension between them renders them both incapable of relieving themselves
glances over at the 's face, then immediately turns back to the wall as the  turns to look at him
The  glances quickly at  and then returns to staring at the wall
sneaks a furtive glance at the 's penis
The  sneaks a furtive glance at 's penis
: 12   :     - emerges from the john, followed a moment later by the
They resume their seats at each end of the bar
third  has come in and is seated midway between and the
Miss
walks over reluctantly
Listen to me for a second
have work to do, Rupert
Just listen
'm at the start     of something really big
don't     want to talk about it here but it's    going to happen soon and it's going    to be great -- for both of us
No kidding
So see that guy some other night
Rita
turns to go
But  haven't finished
returns to the  and pours him another beer sits for a few moments, then downs his beer quickly
Again, he raises his glass
Miss
Miss
The  leans over the bar and tells  something
She opens a bottle of beer and hands it to the  who slides it down the bar towards
As the beer reaches the middle of the bar, the   seated midway between and the  raises his beer glass to take a sip just as the sliding beer bottle passes under his hand
The bottle stops right in front of  who takes it and slides it back with equal force
At this moment, the in the middle has finished his sip and has just placed the  's glass on the counter
The beer bottle collides with the  's glass, creating a mess glares at  as does the
shrugs an apology and  cleans up the mess
(to the  ) 'll get you another one
As  cleans up the mess and pours a fresh beer, the walks down the bar towards
He leans over him and puts a supposedly friendly paw on his shoulder glances distastefully at the 's hand on him
(to ) Look,    friend
'm trying to have a nice    civilized conversation with the young    lady
Be a good little lad, huh,    and give us a break
looks up at the  who pats him on the back in a gesture of fraudulent friendship and menace
burps
With an effort, the  controls his temper and returns to his seat at the end of the bar
instantly raises his glass
Miss
Miss
The  advances towards  with another bottle of beer
watches passively as the  pours half the bottle into 's breast pocket and slams the half-empty bottle on the counter
The  walks down to the end of the counter where a smiling  is waiting
again gulps his beer down
and the  stare at  expecting him to raise his glass and call for another beer
just sits there
After a few moments,  and the  resume their conversation, but they keep glancing over at , expecting him to interrupt them with a call for beer at any moment continues to sit there
Just as  and the  have settled back into their conversation,  falls like a stone from the barstool onto the floor
He lies motionless
and the  look at  for a moment while the handful of other patrons glance at him and return to their drinks
leaves the bar and goes to the rear of the restaurant, disappearing into the kitchen
As she does, the  walks over to where  is lying inert and prods him cruelly with his foot
'mon, schmuck, wake up so  can kick your ass outta here
The  turns to the kitchen to see if  is returning
As he does,  carefully opens one eye, grabs a free chair from a nearby cocktail table, rises and bangs the smartly over the head
The  falls, out cold straightens up quickly as the other patrons look on with interest
brushes off his suit, which is blue, just like the 's, and stands above the  just as the stood above him, his back to kitchen
emerges from the kitchen with the owner,
and a large black (to ) He was making trouble one minute and the next he was on the floor
automatically reaches out as she talks for what she thinks is the 's arm
Instead,  turns around smiling, leaving her too startled to speak
and the  lift the  to his feet
Okay, buddy, here we go
and the  lead the , who is still groggy, out of the bar as  continues to stare at  with a mixture of curiosity and amusement
Okay, Tarzan
Where do we eat tonight
: 13   :         - We are in the kitchen watching two dishes being chopped, shredded and boiled in deep fat
The activity is frantic
the two dishes as a  carries them from the kitchen to a booth where  and  are talking
It is a painfully plain restaurant, shaped in a rectangle, with booths lining either side and a row of little tables in between
At the back is the kitchen and two phone booths, facing each other
An old Chinese  mans the cash register by the door
The  sets the dishes down before  and  and clears an enormous plate of spare rib bones from 's place
hands the her empty cocktail glass
and  are facing one another
Another one, Chan
(to ) Chopsticks, please
The  nods and leaves
So all this time you've been thinking about me, huh
That's right, Rita
What kinds of things were you thinking
drops his eyes shyly
starts laughing
Oh, ho
Those kinds of things
Shame on you, Rupert
Rita,  assure you there was
Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person
Come on, Rita
People will hear
(in a whisper) Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person
Oh, come on, Rupert
Relax
Have a little fun

It always looks like they put worms in this stuff
Just taste

Well,  guess it won't kill me
This is supposed to be the finest Cantonese cuisine in the city
Yeah
Then what happened to the tablecloths
drops his eyes
Oh, don't worry about it
This is fine
(She takes a long drink) 'm having a good time
So you've been devoted to me, huh
used to see you at the Garden every year
Oh, the Follies
That was the right name for 'em
How did you know which one was me
We all looked like chickens
What  mean is, we all looked like the same chicken
thought it was gonna be Rita Keane in the Ice Follies and wind up looking like Henny Penny
chuckles to herself
You just didn't get the breaks
Breaks, bullshit
My parents didn't have the money for the right coach
But what difference does it make
She starts laughing to herself
remember once we were down in Atlanta and the ice machine broke down
We did three hours of slush
Everyone was falling on their faces and hopping up with their arms open for a bow like the whole thing was planned
And the people ate it up
liked the show
Yeah
The Follies
You really must have been carrying the torch
What did you think when  got married
You knew  got married
knew it wouldn't last
You think  should have married you, instead, huh
Peter Drysdale Really, Rita
If he'd only been hit by a train
He was worth a helluva lot more dead than alive,  can tell you that

As she does, a nice-looking young  sitting in the middle aisle raises his glass of beer to her and drinks it, as a kind of toast smiles briefly and her eyes return to

The  comes over and collects the glass
Throughout the rest of the scene, a subtle flirtation continues between  and the Are you seeing anyone

What do you mean
want to know about the competition, that's all
Well, tomorrow night, 've got a date with Joe Namath -- you know Joe
And Thursday --- let's see -- 'm serious, Rita
(imitating him) 'm serious, Rita
(In her own voice) Sure  see people
'm not a nun, Rupert
see a lot of people
Anyone special
(chuckling) You mean am  "going steady"
Rupert, 'm thirty-one years old
What about that guy tonight
Him
Why him
What am  supposed to do, huh
Sit home watching
He's just some guy
He's got his own aluminum siding business
He comes into the city sometimes, that's all
You don't go out with him for his money
Oh, horrors
Look, Rupert, what do you think they pay me in that dump
Ninety-five bucks
And you don't get the world's greatest tippers in there either
Somebody has to take care of me
That's what  want to talk to you about, Rita
The  arrives with 's drink
Who's your favorite movie star
You are, Rupert
Especially your nose
Just tell me
Is this some kind of game
Are you going to tell me something about my character
You'll see
Give me his name
can't think of anybody
You've got to have one, Rita
Everybody does
Okay
Okay
Let's see
(pause) Marilyn Monroe
slowly pulls out a leather-bound book from his inside jacket pocket
Oh, Rupert
Are we going to exchange phone numbers
expertly flips to a middle page in the book and, keeping the book open, his finger pointing under a name, he turns the book to
That's her name
Her name
She signed this herself, especially for me
starts flipping through the book, curious about the other names
She isn't paying any attention to what is saying
She wasn't a great actress but she had a real gift for comedy
She died tragically, you know, alone, like so many of the world's most beautiful women
'm going to see that doesn't happen to you, Rita
Who's this one
checks the book
Burt Reynolds
Oh yeah, the guy with no clothes
Who's this
Mel Brooks
And this
Carol Burnett
No kidding
How about this
Glenda Jackson
Never heard of her
(pointing to other names) And that's Woody Allen and there's Ernie Kovacs -- he's dead -- and that one's Lauren Bacall
You don't really know any of these people
Take a look at this
flips to one of the back pages and shows a name to (squinting) can't make it out
Try
This is really weird handwriting
Exasperated,  follows the name in question with his index finger
Rooooper
(guessing) Redford
That's Robert Redford
It is
No
It's
it's Rupert Pupkin tears out the page and hands it to her shyly just stares at it and back at
Don't lose it
It's going to be worth something in a couple of weeks
start laughing
That's what 've been trying to tell you
Things are really breaking for me
'm ticketed for stardom
laughs harder, despite efforts to be serious
Only a couple of hours ago,  was talking to Jerry Langford, the Jerry Langford
Stop it, Rita
pulls herself together for a moment
We were talking about my doing my act on his show
(suppressing a smile) Your act
Get    that guy you knew from Clifton out of    your head right now
You're looking at    Rupert Pupkin, Rita
Rupert Pupkin, the    new King of Comedy
starts laughing hysterically, in spite of herself
(getting a grip on herself) 'm sorry
Why not me, Rita
guy can always get what he wants if he's willing to pay the price
All it takes is a little talent and sacrifice and the right break
If you've got a friend in the right place, that's all it takes
And that's exactly what have going for me right now
After all, crazier things have happened
listens silently for a moment, then begins to giggle
As  resumes speaking, we  between  and the Their flirtation picks up steam
The raises his eyebrows as if to ask, "Are you interested in me
" She smiles
All the while,  rattles on
You just don't realize what a shot on the Langford Show can mean
That's coast to coast, national , a bigger audience than the greatest comedians used to play to in a lifetime
shot like that means a free ticket on the comedy circuit -- Flip Wilson one week, Cosby the next, then Sonny and Cher or Carol Burnett
And you've always got those other talk shows to fall back on -- Carson, Griffin
And all that leads straight in one direction, Rita -- Hollywood
That's when we really start living How does this sound to you -- a beach house in Malibu, right on the ocean
You'll get a beautiful tan, believe me
And we'd keep a suite at the Sherry
That's the only place to stay when you're big
We could get something on a top floor and look down on all our old friends in Clifton and just laugh
How does that sound to you
It sounds wonderful, Rupert, and really hope you get what you want
But it's getting late and 'm a working girl
You know what  mean
The telephone at the back of the restaurant starts ringing
in the background moves slowly to answer it
You going to spend the rest of your life in that place
Is that what you really want, talking about nothing with nothings
thought you wanted something a little better than that and that's what 'm offering
Every King needs a Queen, Rita
want you to be mine
What do you say
You really want to help me out
You see this
(She points to her lower back molar)  hundred seventy-five bucks
If you could spare fifty, say, until next Monday, that would keep three people really happy -- me, my landlord and my dentist
During 's speech, the  has been working his way from the phone booth towards the front of the restaurant
Telephone for you, Miss
(looking puzzled) Me
Nobody knows 'm here
You didn't tell anybody, did you
No
(getting up) What the hell's going on
, who walks to the back of the restaurant and picks up the dangling receiver in one of the two facing booths, the other of which is occupied
14   :      - Hello
' Hi
Who is this
' Who do you think it is
've been staring at you all evening
Where are you
The   taps forcefully with his index finger on the glass door of his booth
, hearing the noise, turns around and finds herself staring at the
She smiles
: 15   :     - at the table looking over the check
He gets out a ten dollar bill
emerges from the booth in nervous high spirits
(with repressed gaiety) You know who that was -- the bar have to go back to work
How did they know you were here
(gathering her things) guess  must have told them
They need someone right away
(accusingly) You don't even care, do you
Oh, no
do
Really
It's not the bar, Rita
Don't tell me it's the bar
Don't be angry
It has nothing to do with you
had a nice dinner, really
It was great seeing you again
stare at her icily
Come on
Let's see a smile
Why don't we finish the evening up at the bar together
End the evening where it began
After what happened there
Well,  could at least drop you off
(hurriedly making up her face) That's okay
Really
can manage
Why don't you just go to a movie or something
Don't let me spoil your evening
But that wouldn't be right
gets up and stands before
(firmly) Look, Rupert
It's been a lot of fun, really
'll see you sometime, huh
But Rita
starts moving towards the door
Come on, Rupert
'm in a hurry
marches out with  trailing behind
He throws the check and the ten dollar bill at the

- as he streaks out the door and jumps into the adjacent doorway, immediately peering down the street
He spies the   and  walking about three quarters of a block down and follows them, keeping out of sight
They turn occasionally to see if he's around, then stop turning
They go around the corner and disappear into a large apartment building
rushes after them,   positioning himself across from    the building
He searches   the windows for some clue as to    where they have gone
Finally a set of lights go on on    the fourth floor and a   's shadow is seen closing two    sets of blinds
: 17   :       - enters the building and finds himself in a small entranceway
The door to the lobby is locked
Next to the door, on the wall, are listed the tenants, their apartment numbers and a button next to each name
There is an intercom speaker
There are eight apartments listed on the fourth floor, running from 4A to 4H
looks them over, takes a deep breath and pushes 4A
: 18   :    '  - It is an extremely well-furnished studio apartment with all the requirements of a contemporary bachelor pad -- an imitation bearskin rug, nice bookshelves including an elaborate stereo system, recessed lighting, including a soft spotlight on the Queen-sized bed with its pseudo-satin cover
The   and  stand in the middle of the room
looks about uneasily
No intercom buzzer sounds
Welcome to the pleasure dome
You don't kid around, do you
(smiling) do alright
What's your libation
Huh
Your potion
Your drink
Bourbon and soda
Make it light
The   goes to his chic little bar and starts fixing a strong bourbon and soda
He also fixes himself a strong scotch and water
As he works, they talk
You from the South
Me
That's what Southern people drink
Lots of bourbon
What do people from Jersey drink
make it a point to study things like that
It's important to know people's backgrounds, their tastes, their culture
It gives you a little head start
The   turns from the bar and hands  her drink
'm Chet
Whom do  have the pleasure of serving
'm Mary
Pleased to meat you, Mary
(He lifts his glass) To our evening
: 19   :     - stands before the intercom

pushes 4B
: 20   :    '  - is seated on the couch
The   is putting a record on the phonograph
Once again, the intercom doesn't sound
has drawn another blank
Leisure is America's fastest growing industry
Did you know that
Think about it
Short work weeks, more vacation
People need something to do with all that time and that's where come in
Leisure Villages, Inc
We buy land an hour or so outside your metropolitan centers
We set up the bungalows, dig some lakes, lay out a golf course, you know, fix the whole place up so it's usable
Then young, personable guys like me show the people around
It the guy seems tight, we point out the investment factor
If he's a swinger, well, the bungalows are very private
If he's a sports nut, we talk up skiing and fishing and tennis
The phonograph starts playing Burt Bachrach
What's your work, Mary
The   walks back to her and stands over her
Me
fly for National
(delighted) No kidding
What's that smell
Sandalwood incense
It seemed very you
: 21   :     - yells into the intercom
said 'm sorry
We hear the intercom at the other end click off pauses a moment and pushes 4C
: 22   :    '  - and the   are seated on the couch
Still no buzzer
As the   talks,  is staring at a woman's shoe lying underneath a small table that holds a lamp
Did you know that you have remarkable hair
Yeah
You know what
feel like going to a movie
Now
Sure
Why not
It's only twenty of ten
We can make a ten o'clock show
The   takes her hands and looks deep into her eyes
Why don't we make our own movie
No
don't think so
Don't be so uptight
Give it a chance
want to go to the movies, that's all
We can go to the movies later
pulls her hands away
Let's stop playing games, okay
'm not a kid
You have something against pleasure
'm just not interested in being tonight's ritual sacrifice, okay
Shall  freshen up your drink
shakes her head
(growing irritated) What exactly did you think we were going to do up here
: 23   :     - pushes 4D and waits
' Yeah
: 24   :    '  - The   is practically sitting on 's lap
He has  backed up against the end of the couch
Look, if you've got sexual problems let's talk about them
It helps clear the air
There's nothing wrong with me Then it's me
don't even know you
Then find out
Sex is a great way of breaking down barriers
don't think so
'm sure this could lead to something beautiful
The   kisses  roughly
Passive resistance, huh
Let's just write this thing off as a big mistake
What do you say
What's wrong with me
Nothing
just want to go home
can see 'm not turning you on
(smiles) You noticed that, huh
Come on
What's wrong with me
You really want to know
Yeah
How can  put it
Well, it's like you've got your fly open and your tongue hanging out
: 25   :   - , growing more frantic, pushes 4E

No buzzer sounds

Come on
Get offa me
Sometimes  write poetry

No
So you wanna play hard to get, huh
The   grabs her
: 27   :     - , even more desperate, pushes 4F
' Que es, por favor
: 28   :    '  - The   is strong-arming  who is beginning to get frightened
Come on
Let's talk this over
admire you very much
respect you, Mary
(her eyes beginning to fill with terror) You're hurting me
'm only doing what you want
(pleading, on the verge of tears) Oh, please
: 29   :     - , frantic, pushes 4G
: 30   :     '  - The   has  securely pinned and is starting to undo her blouse
She is desperate
Afterwards, you'll thank me
The buzzer sounds with great force
It is one, long, protracted blast that breaks the  's concentration
takes advantage of the distraction to grab her bag and rush out as the buzzer continues to sound
: 31   :     - still has his finger on 4G as  rushes out the door next to the elevator and comes rushing towards him
She is numb and emotionally exhausted
Rita
(in desperation) What do you want
keeps walking out of the entranceway and onto the street
is at her side
Don't be angry with me
was worried about you, that's all
Just go home and leave me alone
take off his jacket and puts if around 's shoulders
(quietly) Here
You'll need this
It's getting chilly
'm so bad 'm such a dummy
Don't say that, Rita
Everyone does crazy things
Not all the time

rushes into the street and hails a cab

dime bounces at 's feet
' Stuff it, big spender
pays no attention
He walks  to her front stoop
Well,  guess you're entitled to come up for coffee
That's okay, Rita
You're tired and know 'm not always the easiest guy to be with
There is a pause
(puzzled) What do you want , Rupert
(softly) You don't understand anything, do you
love you, Rita
want to change your life
if you'll only give me a chance
just shakes her head sadly
Look, what if  arranged it so you could meet Jerry
You'd have to believe me if you heard it from him
There's no
'll arrange that, Rita
We'll all go out to dinner some night or maybe out to his place, on a weekend
You'll see
The trouble with you is you've got no faith
Now go to bed and get a good rest and 'll see you in a couple of days

It reads 10:10
nearby record store starts blasting music into the street through a loudspeaker
The music serves as background for a montage in which we   the clock, which moves in bites towards 11:30 to Broadway as it looks to  in the booth -- that cavalcade of hustlers, whores, housewives, kids, weirdos and working people; and  of various people waiting to use the phone -- their impatience, anger, disgust
Each time one of them arrives,  pretends to thumb through the phone book and dial a number
him chatting with animation until the waiting party leaves
Then   him push the coin return to retrieve his dime

You know the secret of dieting, Jerry
Grapefruit
It's good for you
It's filling
And it's low in calories
(to the camera) Take note of that, you ladies
As a matter of fact, yesterday  went to the outdoor market near where live and  bought twenty grapefruit
The grocer looked at me and said, "What are you gonna do with all those
" So  bent over and told him (in a confidential tone) "'m gonna take 'em back to Florida and set 'em free

: 45   :   '  - enters
that it is a small room, furnished by the hotel in the plainest way
Nicely-done home-made collages of show business figures decorate the drab green walls
The room is neat and clean
goes directly to a plain table which holds two tape recorders -- one a small cassette the other a large table tape recorder
He picks up the microphone of the larger one and speaks into it
Testing
Testing
Testing
In the following montage, we hear in the background the replay of his "testing, testing testing" and various other noises -- a bit of his voice taped, a burst of laughter, the squeal of a tape recorder sent fast-forward, a sudden burst of applause, a scrap of theme music
At the same time, the   about the room
We look at the collages which include all the obvious show business figures, with a heavy emphasis on comedians from Chaplin and Keaton to Sid Caesar and Woody Allen
The collages also include such varied figures as Jimmy Carter, Julia Childs, Tom Seaver, David Brinkley, Muhammad Ali, Clifford Irving, Walter Cronkite and Mark Spitz
There is a special Kennedy section -- John
and Bobby framed in black, Jackie in mourning and a picture of Teddy
There is also a trio of assassins -- Sirhan, Oswald and James Earl Ray
There is also a talk show collage with a photo of Langford in the center like a sun surrounded by Snyder, Walters, Carson and Griffin
One bookshelf holds a veritable library of comedy -- joke books, biographies of comedians, treasuries of American humor
Another shelf holds scores of tapes in their own little boxes, each one neatly marked, i

Finally, he starts the larger recorder and lifts the mike
First, Miss Long
Thanks very much for your help at the office and for passing this along to Jerry appreciate it more than you know
stops the tape recorder and thinks again for a few beats
He then starts the large recorder
Now, Jerry
Before  begin,  just want to thank you for listening to this material and for the opportunity that you've given me
You know, lots of people think that guys like you, you know, people who have made it, lose their feeling for struggling young talent such as myself
But now  know from experience that those people are just cynics, embittered by their own failure
know, Jerry, that you're as human as the rest of us, if not more so
(pause) Oh well, guess there's no point going on about it
You know how  feel
So let's get on with the show
The best of Rupert Pupkin
've sketched out this little introduction in order to save you a little time
So close your eyes and imagine it's exactly six o'clock
You're standing in the wings and we hear Rick Ross and the Orchestra strike up your theme song
pushes a button on the cassette and we hear the theme song of the Jerry Langford Show, followed by the voice of  , the announcer
' And now, direct from New York, it's the Jerry Langford Show
Tonight, with Jerry's special guest
deftly shuts off the cassette and substitutes his own voice for that of 's
The large tape recorder keeps rolling
the comedy find of the year making his television debut, Rupert Pupkin, the King of Comedy
rapidly races the cassette tape forward, then pushes down the "play" button
We hear a burst of thundering applause
lets the applause run for a while and then shuts it off
The large recorder keeps rolling
Now you come on, Jerry, and do your monologue
Then, when the time comes, this is how  see you introducing me
You'll say something like this
"Ladies and Gentlemen we're going to do something a little bit different tonight
It isn't often that you can call someone a sure thing in the entertainment business
After all, the verdict is always in your hands
But  think after you've met my next guest, that you'll agree with me that he's destined for greatness
So, now, will you please give your warmest welcome to the newest King of Comedy, Rupert Pupkin
" pushes the cassette and we hear another enormous burst of applause
lets it run, listening intently
He stands up and faces a wall of his room, still holding the microphone
that the wall is covered by a huge blow-up of an audience laughing and applauding
: 45   :       - a real audience laughing and applauding
: strides triumphantly onto the stage, nodding to acknowledge the applause
He stops center stage as the television cameras maneuver about him
: of the "" sign flashing, then stopping
Still, the applause goes on
: raises his hands to quiet the audience
After a few moments    the applause dies down, except for a pair of hands in the    center of the orchestra
peers out to see who is    still applauding
: , in the middle of the audience, applauds enthusiastically
: on stage
gives  a special smile and nod
Will somebody tell that lovely lady that the applause sign is off
The audience laughs
: 46   :   '  - stands facing the "audience" still holding the mike
That's a possible introduction, Jerry
Now let's move on to my act
: 47   :          - is pacing
He is wearing another suit, this one a broad-lapelled-grey
He is freshly shaved, is hair neatly combed, his shoes carrying a bright shine
He clutches a small flat box, neatly wrapped with the words ' " written clearly across the top in large print
emerges from one of the back corridors into the reception area
Yes
(suddenly a bit shy) didn't want to take any chances with this
uh
Miss Long, so uh
thought 'd just bring it here myself
He hands   the package as though it contained nitroglycerine
We talked about this this morning, did we, Mr
Pupkin
Rupert Pupkin
Oh, yes
It's been some day
(pause) Well,  certainly appreciate your bringing this over, Mr
Pupkin, and we'll listen to it as soon as possible
Fine
Er
you don't have any idea how soon that might be
Well, you can try checking with us tomorrow
We might know something by then
Otherwise, it'll have to be Monday
What if  just sort of waited around here today, just in case
'll stay out of the way
You'd just be wasting your time, Mr
Pupkin
We won't know anything until tomorrow at the earliest
Oh,  wouldn't consider it a waste of time at all
'd be glad to do it
Look, why don't you try us tomorrow
Okay
Tomorrow
Right
'll do that
Thanks a lot, Miss Long
And thank Jerry
smiles at      and    goes, leaving staring at a picture     of     on the wall
on a moment and          to see  in what would imagine     his office    to be
48   :     - large, corner office furnished in royal red, with high ceilings and a huge desk
Potted palms and hydrangeas rest on a marble floor
is moving about restlessly, clutching 's tape in one hand and waving it about
is seated on a comfortable couch
Dynamite
This is dynamite
(shyly) You think so, Jerry
Look, 've been at this for fifteen years, Rupert, and  haven't come up with anything like this -- not me, not any of my writers
(smiling with obvious pleasure) Well, 'm glad you like it, Jerry
Tell me something, Rube
(pause) How do you do it
'm not asking to use the material myself
just want to know how you ( waves his arms in a gesture of frustration) how you do it Well,  don't know if  can explain it, really
Come on
Try, Rube
Well,    it just sort of comes
think about    my life, see, mainly about the worst    parts, all the awful things, and just    try to see them in a funny light
That's    all
(eagerly) Is that what you do
The worst parts, and then you look at them in a funny light
Is that what you do
More or less
It's hard to describe how its happens
But that's just it, Rube
It doesn't happen for me
Why do you think the show is in so much trouble
By the time 've done my monologue, everyone has switched to Carson
Maybe if you did a little writing
Sure, Jerry, 'd do anything  could to help out
You would
Great
Why don't you come out to my place this weekend and we'll hash it out
'm having a few of my friends but we should be able to get a little work in
Would you mind if  brought someone
(smiling) girl, Rube
very special girl, Jerry
'd love to meet her
49    -      - emerges, lost in thought
Suddenly he notices waiting nearby
She doesn't see
He sneaks off
: 50   :
- It is a bright morning
, attempting to camouflage himself by wearing a cap over his eyes and his trench coat collar turned up, his eyes hidden behind dark glasses, walks out of the building
is standing by the door
Cab, Jerry
That's alright, thanks
as he walks
Some people don't notice
Others stare but leave him alone, a few commenting to their companions and pointing at him
pulls alongside
Hey, Jerry
My brother can sing and juggle at the same time
How about puttin' him on your show
keeps walking
How about it, Jerry
Sorry, 'm off duty
: 51
- stands at the corner, next to a middle-aged You're Jerry
pulls his cap a little more tightly around his eyes
You know something
(She giggles) undress in front of you every night and Larry here doesn't mind at all
can't get anything started with her until you're off the air
Your show is ruining my sex life, Jerry
Well then, you'll just have to put on a better show than  do
: 52   :   ,      '  - continue to walk, feeling what it is to be a celebrity out in public
After a few beats, we : 53   :    - trailing
notices her and starts walking quickly
walks quickly starts jogging
starts jogging
Finally, breaks into a sprint
runs after him disappears into his office building
arrives several seconds later
Jerry
God damnit
Just as  turns around, , unaware of her, walks cheerfully into the building
: 54   :          - enters
The same middle-aged, plump is seated behind the desk
Yes, sir
(recognizing him)   Oh, hi
Hi
How are you
Not bad
'm fine
Can  help you
'd like to see Jerry, please
You are
Mr
Pupkin
Just a minute
The  dials a number
Mr
Pupkin is here
That's right (to ) She'll be with you in a minute
Who
Miss Long
But  wanted to see Jerry
Mr
Langford's not in
Miss Long will take care of you
Alright
paces for a few beats
He smiles at the beat later,   comes out, carrying the tape in its box
Mr
Pupkin
How are you today
Fine, Mr
Pupkin
Thank you for your tape
We listened to it with great interest
And, frankly, Mr
Pupkin, we saw a lot of good things in what you're doing
We feel you have good potential
Very good potential
(smiling) Thanks
That's why 'll be honest with you, Mr
Pupkin
Yes
We just don't think you're ready yet
(baffled) Not ready
Well, we just don't feel right now that you're right for Jerry
(rapidly, half-listening) Right for Jerry
Sure
Some of the material
some of the one-liners, for instance
Yes
were not very strong
You didn't care for some of the jokes, is that it
That"s right
Good
Good
can take care of that right way
Thanks
Just tell me the ones you think should go
That would be a big help
(to the ) This is great
(to ) Which ones
Well, it's not just that, Mr
Pupkin
You see, Jerry likes to panel his guests, you know, chat with them afterwards
Sure
Sure
And frankly, we just don't feel you've got very much to talk about right now
But 've got my whole life to talk about
Which is interesting to you, 'm sure and to your wife
and to a few friends
But we feel that you should keep developing your act
Test it in some live situations
There are a number of clubs in the city you can try
And after a reasonable period, get in touch with us again and we'll be glad to send someone down to check out your progress
stares at her for a few moments as the tension grows
May  ask you a question, Miss Long
Of course
Are you speaking for Jerry
Let's put it this way, Mr
Pupkin
Mr
Langford has complete faith in our judgment
'm sorry to have to say this, Miss Long, and  certainly don't want you to take it personally, but  have to tell you that don't don't have faith in your judgment
Well, 'm sorry you feel that way, Mr
Pupkin
But 'm afraid there's nothing that can be done about that
No
No
'm afraid 'll have to disagree with you again
(with strained politeness) That's your privilege, Mr
Pupkin
Now, if you'll excuse me, please, have some things to do
'm sorry the news isn't better
turns to go
Miss Long
turns back
When are you expecting Jerry in
He won't be in until very late this afternoon
That's fine
Thank you
stares at  for a moment, glances at the and then goes
takes a seat in the reception area
He smiles once more at the
The  drops her eyes
few beats go by passes by the entranceway and glances at
continues sitting there
Is there anyone else you would like to see
That's alright
'm happy just waiting
few beats pass in silence
Well, would you mind waiting outside, please, Mr
Pupkin
This is a reception area, not a waiting room
understand
remains seated
few more moments pass
Several pass by the entranceway and glance at After a few more beats, a large, plainly-dressed in his mid-fifties emerges from the back offices
He goes over to , who stands
Mr
Pupkin
'm Raymond Wirtz, in charge of security for the Langford organization
puts his arm on 's shoulder and, as the following dialogue unfolds leads him out the door, down the corridor and into the elevator
Now  think you understand that we have certain rules here that are essential to the smooth functioning of our operation
Sure
Sure
And that without these rules, we really wouldn't be able to function at our best
You follow my point
nods
Now one of these rules is that only authorized personnel and those having official business with our organization are permitted on our premises
And that's why 'm asking you, Mr
Pupkin, to cooperate with us
They have reached the elevator and  has pushed the button
You want me to leave the building
That's right
It's nothing personal, Mr
Pupkin
Just doing my job
The elevator arrives
signals with his head that should enter
gets in
Have a pleasant day
: 55   :        - comes out and takes up a position outside the door, preparing to wait for
sees him and comes over to him
Well, did you give it to him
(out of a daze) Huh
Did you get my letter to him
He's not in there
Look, if you don't want to give it him, okay
'll get somebody else
But don't try to con me
told you 'd try and  will
'm going to wait for him right here
Give me the envelope, huh
Sure, but
saw him go in myself
Who
Jerry
But they said he wasn't in
Just give me the envelope
When did he go in
Ten minutes ago
That's when
You sure
Look,  saw him my
And he hasn't come out
've been standing right here
Now how about it
turns and goes back into the building
yells after him
'm staying right here
: 56   : enters briskly and goes up to the
(with authority) Tell Jerry Langford 'm here, please
'm sorry, sir
Mr
Langford's not in
happen to know he is So would you please tell him 'm here
'm sorry
He's not in
You're putting your job on the line, lady
The  starts making a call inside glances at her and walks right in to the inner corridors
He starts peering into the open doors of the offices that line the corridor
The whole place is like a gigantic maze
pass by him, taking no notice of him
He continues wandering around desperately, completely lost
few beat later, he spots  leading a pair of keeps peering into offices quickly as he flees
The  and  finally catch up to at the steno pool and, after a brief chase around the pool, they catch  and subdue him
They start dragging him out past the eyes of the
(calling as he is dragged) Jerry
Jerry
(to ) You're going the have a hell of a lot of explaining to do
(calling) Jerry
You had your warning, Mr
Krupkin
Jerry
Help me
Jerry
: - of  as he is dragged out
(screaming) Jerry
: 57   :        - the   and  pitch  out into the street
If we see your face again, Mr
Pupkin, we'll call the police
Start looking for a new job
comes straight up to  who is brushing himself off
His eyes are glazed and distant
Well
Huh
Does he have it
(abstractedly) Don't worry
'll get it to him
Yeah
When
There is a pause
This weekend
He asked me to go out there, to his house
: 58    -    - enters the bar-restaurant
Through the window him talking to
He is voluble, animated
She looks skeptical, with a wry smile on her face
Finally him extract an answer from her
She shrugs, smiles and says yes
He comes walking out the door, his hounded expression softened by a smile
: 59   :        '  - getting fitted in a new suit, attended by a  and a
: 60   :     - buy a suitcase
: 61   :   '  - perusing the beautiful diamond, sapphire, and emerald rings and we take a few moments to these beautiful jewels as he sees them
Finally, he picks out a splendid ring with a single, middle-sized sapphire and hands a surprised  the money in cash
: 62   :     - and  are seated side by side
Since it is Saturday morning, the train is sparsely populated has just finished taking 's tickets is edgy
is strangely calm and a little remote
He is wearing his new suit
What are we going to do
(patiently) Look,  told you, 've got some work to discuss with him
That's all
But what about me
You're with me That's fine, but while you two are talking, what am  going to do
You can chat with the other guests
'm sure they'll be thrilled hearing about the wonderful world of draft beer
(pause) Let's tell 'em 'm a model, okay
What
If they ask what  do, let's just say model
You don't mind pretending just a little, do you
If it make you feel better
There is a pause
This is    a gas
Too bad nobody'll believe    it
(pause) After you guys are done    working, what happens
Are we going    out someplace, or what
'm sure Jerry has something arranged
There is another pause
What do    these people do for fun
Do they    party or do freaky things or just    get drunk or
mean, What do    they do guess they just sit around and talk and enjoy each other's company, like anybody else
Talk
What can you talk about for three or four hours
What do    you mean
They've got plenty to talk    about
They do things
All kinds of    interesting things happen to them    and then they talk about them
What do    you think Jerry's show is all about
Yeah, a cocktail party with no drinks
That's what all those shows are
At least they help you get to sleep
There is a pause
(glumly) Boy, this is going to be some great weekend
thought we were gonna have some fun
(smiling) Just take it easy, Rita
Everything's going to be fine
for a - of  who is fading out
: 63   :    - It is a large white house with colonial columns set in the middle of a palatial estate whose rolling lawns are punctuated with fine old trees
We circle around to the back where , a handful of his  (which can be familiar television celebrities) and  and  are just finishing a lavish lunch on the patio
pair of are clearing the table and serving the coffee and desert as the scene unfolds
As we arrive, we hear a loud burst of laughter
is regaling the  with stories
Oh, you have no idea how bad it's gotten in New York
Now the muggers are so efficient that, each time they jump you, they take your name and address and put you on a mailing list
(the  chuckles) And once you're on the list, you're in real trouble, like this friend of mine who was mugged thirty-two times on his way home from work
(a little laughter from the ) places the desert, a little, elegant tart, in front of  and
(to ) Thanks
The  smiles
As  continues his story, he glances occasionally at  who has begun to nibble at her tart
also glances conspiratorially at who smiles back
So what my friend does is get himself a dog, one of those huge German Shepherds
One night, he's walking the dog in Central Park when he hears this voice behind him
(in a German accent) Okay, Harry, drop your vallet and keep your hantz over your head or  bite your little fanny off
The  breaks up
(to ) Looks like you've found yourself a winner, Jerry
(looking at ) He's the one who found himself a winner
looks up, smiles and blushes
The rest of the smiles benignly and grows attentive as  returns to eating her tart
Suddenly she bites down on something hard
She fishes it out of her mouth and looks at it
The giggles
It is the ring  purchased at Cartier's
The  applauds lightly and laughs
lifts his wine glass
To Rita and Rupert -- a short engagement and a long, happy marriage
The  drinks with murmurs of "Hear
Hear
" and  beam
looks lovingly at
(the ) Have you set a date
(looking pointedly at ) Oh, yes
hope we're all invited
Everyone's invited
: 64   : The theater is packed
World Series bunting hangs from the balcony and the front of the stage
We hear   and the  strike up Mendelssohn's Wedding March
Down one aisle walks , accompanied by the  whom hit over the head at the bar
Down the other aisle marches , accompanied by
The  cheers wildly
The two  walk to the stage where a white- haired  awaits them
stands at his side
and  disengage from their  and stand before the
The music stops and the grows quiet
We are met here in these extraordinary circumstances to join this man and this woman in holy wedlock
But, before we begin, let me voice a personal word of thanks to you, Rupert and to you, Rita, for choosing me to perform this prestigious ceremony
Because we are on prime time,  am going to discard my customary remarks in favor of a few personal reflections
When  was principal at Clifton High and these two were students,  had very little faith that Rupert here would amount to very much
But like his teachers and his fellow students,  underestimated this fine young man
Some say that this misjudgment is directly tied to my recent dismissal as head of the Clifton School System
But let me take this opportunity to set the record straight
Knowing that Rupert and Rita here were most certainly destined for a great career and a lifetime of happiness, voluntarily stepped down
would only here add my own wishes to those of millions of viewers for their continued health, wealth and boundless success
The  looks quickly past  and
We'll be back to marry them in a minute, right after this word
: 65   :     - and  are seated as they were
We hear the calling
' Greenwich
Greenwich next stop
Greenwich
and  grab their small suitcases and quickly move down the aisle towards the door
: 66   :      - is peering out the window
is still lost in thought
Look at that one
How'd you like to live in that
Or that one
What do you figure these run
The taxi stops in front of a walled lot behind which is visible a handsome English stucco home
(to ) What's this
This is it
It's gorgeous
is genuinely puzzled
(to ) You sure
Look, friend,  wouldn't want to tell you how many times  made this trip
(pause)    That'll be three seventy-five
, still puzzled, hands him a five dollar bill
(abstractedly) Keep it
The  gets out and puts  and 's bags, which he had stacked on the front seat, onto the sidewalk
Thanks
If you need a ride back, just ask the guy for Wayne
That's me
The    as  opens the gate and he and walk up the drive
: 67   :   '  - and  stand before the front door
rings, After a few beats, the door is opened by an Indonesian walks in right past him,  following behind
: 68   :   '  - hands the  the two suitcases as he talks
You must be Jonno
'm Rupert Pupkin and this is Rita Keane
Mr
Langford's expecting us
Jonno nods politely but uncertainly
(uncertain) Mr
Langford asked you to come
That's right
Would you mind taking those up
Jerry and  have some work that may oblige me to stay overnight
But Mr
Langford's not here
Out playing golf, right
(still puzzled and unsure) That's right
Maybe he'll finally break a hundred
Maybe it's better if you came back
(interrupting) That's alright
We don't mind waiting
walks from the foyer into the living-room, leaving staring after him holding the bags
walks into the living room after
(worried) The table's only set for one
That's from breakfast
Relax, will you
: 69   :   '  - is on the phone
black lady  stands at his side
(into the phone) Let me talk to Jerry Langford please know he is
It's important
: 70   :   '   - It is a handsomely furnished room, done in old American antiques and other tasteful pieces
There is a grand piano heavy with pictures in one corner and wall-to-wall bookshelves that are mostly full and mixed with a balance of classics and modern popular reading
The whole room marks  as a man of discernment
The shelves also house a fine stereo and a small, discreet bar
and walk in like strangers in paradise, awed by the obvious elegance and expense the room reflects
(as though he owned it) How do you like it
(admiringly) could live here
(smiling proudly) It's the only way to live
stands in the center of the room, ill at ease, while strolls about comfortably, picking up an ashtray here, a cigarette case there, inspecting the artifacts for inscriptions, clues, hints about 's character and life
How come he isn't here
You heard the guy
He's out playing golf
Didn't you tell him when we'd get here
continues to move about the room, fielding 's suspicious inquiries effortlessly
We didn't have time to iron out the details
Now just relax
We're the first guests, that's all
(interrupting) That Jonno character hadn't even heard of us
(a little irritated) It probably slipped Jerry's mind
He has better things to think about than what he tells his houseboy
It's just not time way  expected it, that's all
There is a pause
continues his investigation
He has moved to the grand piano in the rear of the room
What do we do now
is looking    at a picture of an American Gothic couple standing in front    of a wood-frame house
As he comments on the pictures, the      over them
They form a kind of slide-show of    's life
These are Jerry's parents
His father runs the Post office in Wolverine -- that's in North Dakota
then fixes on a picture of an eleven-year-old boy standing next to a puppet stage with a puppet (obviously held by the boy) staring at its master
This one was in Newsweek
He started giving these puppet shows when he was still in grade school
a picture of a very young  seated before a microphone with some celebrity
And this is from his quiz show in St
Louis
Can you believe it
Sure  can
That was the name of the show
to a picture of  smiling at
And here's when he wrote for Jack Paar
He made a hundred and fifty a week and look at him now
Another picture of  with a group of women sitting in a studio
And this is his morning show
picture of  standing in a park with his two boys, eleven and eight
And his kids
He's divorced
, who has been only half-listening, has picked up a small, beautifully enameled cigarette box
Look at this
love these kind of things
Look at the work
've got this thing about boxes
puts it down reluctantly, picks it up, then puts it down again
: 71   :     - is holding the phone, waiting
The  stands, looking at him
Mr
Langford
'm sorry to disturb you
: 72   :      - has just finished fixing herself a drink
She takes a large sip and starts pacing around
is seated
How much longer are we gonna have to wait
don't know
Until he gets back
Do we have to just sit here
He should be back pretty soon
Doesn't he have any music or anything
Let's get a little life into this place
It's like a funeral parlor
She walks over to the stereo and opens the cupboard beneath it, revealing rows and rows of records
This is more like it
She pulls out a record
Come on, Rita
Come on, yourself
She puts the record on
Frank Sinatra starts singing "They Can't Take That Away From Me
" She takes a big sip of her drink, puts it down and comes over to
How about a little spin, handsome
(pulling back) Here
snuggles into  and starts dancing him around
He resists feebly
Come on, Rupert
came up here for a good time
gives in and starts      dancing with her in the    style of the 1950's, elbow out, arm      up, box step
After a     few moments,  closes his      eyes
He has reached a     moment of perfect bliss, his dream      girl in is arms
They     dance silently as we hear Sinatra      singing
' The way you wore your hat, The way we danced till three, The memory of all that -- Oh no, they can't take that away from me, No
they can't take that away
from
me
The orchestra plays
You never could dance, could you
How would you know
Oh  danced with you a couple of times -- at the Sigma  party
You were there with Tommy Winston
You didn't ask me
That's the one time did ask you and you went with him anyway
Well,  couldn't go with you Why not
Be serious, Rupert
: 73   :      - stands a few feet from the kitchen door, staring at and  dancing in the living room, an unbelieving, anxious expression on his face
: 74   :      - The music has stopped momentarily and  and disengage
looks lovingly at
Well, it's all ended happily and that's what counts
grows jumpy under his gaze
She looks around
wonder what the rest of this place looks like
'm sure it's all very nice
(gaily) Well, there's only one way to find out
scampers over to the stairs and pauses on the first step
You coming or not
bounds up the stairs
Rita
up the stairs
: 75   :    - There is no sign of
Where are you
There is no answer
from room to room
They are all guest rooms, neat, pretty, clean
Come on, Rita
This isn't funny
Finally,  opens the door to another room
: 76   :     - It is clearly 's bedroom with a few clothes strewn about, and other signs of being lived in
lies on the bed
(shocked) What are you doing, Rita
love it
All those millions of women out there dying to change places with me right now
Come on
We shouldn't be here
Relax, will you
Let me have a little fun, for Christ's sake
gets off the bed and runs into the john
: 77   :      - Look at this
It's nicer than my whole apartment
enters the large, beautifully done bathroom examines her face in the mirror
(urgently) Let's go, Rita
Boy,  really need some sun
Rita, this is Jerry's
Lay off, will you, Rupert
But we have no right
picks up a can of shave cream and squirts a large dollop in 's face
for a   of 's face, buried under shaving cream
That wasn't funny, Rita
hands him a towel
Here
She looks around
Now for something that smells nice
She swings open the cabinet with a flourish
The door swings open violently and the mirror shatters against something as pills and bottles tumble into the sink
and  stand there, staring at each other begins to laugh, but her laugh is cut short by the slam of the downstairs door
: 78   : has entered, drawn and businesslike
and the  have moved out to greet him
(looking around) Where are they
was going to call the police but then  thought to myself 'what if they are Mr
Langford's friends
' We hear some whispers and scuffling at the top of the stairs
,  and the  look up comes bounding down the stairs jauntily with  following cautiously behind
has large traces of shaving cream behind his ears and on his neck
Hi, Jerry
We were just freshening up
stops at the base of the stairs, turns around, and waves  down
(to ) Come on, Rita
No need to be shy
smiles conspiratorially at
comes slowly down
Jerry, 'd like you to meet Rita Keane
Rita, say hello to Jerry
(tentatively) Pleased to meet you
nods imperceptibly, his face tense, his eyes alert
, reading her frigid reception, looks to who walks blithely past  into the living room, toward the bar
What's your pleasure
glances at the small mess he has left on the bar and turns back to  who has moved into the living room with  and the  a few steps behind
flashes an apologetic smile
(to ) We've already taken the liberty, so to speak
Rita was a little nervous
It isn't every day she meets someone like you
What's going on here
We've been sitting around, waiting
That's all
How was your golf game
told them you weren't here
That's right
He did, Jerry
He was very helpful
We had to take an early train
There was nothing else until after one
(pause)  brought the material
It's upstairs, in my bags
(pause) Where is everybody
Who
The other guests
(in a confidential tone) We're getting a little hungry, to tell you the truth
(as though confirming what  said) You are
(backing off) But we don't mind waiting, do we, Rita
says nothing
She has sensed something terribly wrong and is slowly backing away from
You know,  could have you arrested, both of you
(seizing the idea) You know you could
And there'd be absolutely no way we could prove we belonged here
never thought of that
Well, you should have before you
(still fixed on the idea) Maybe we could work up a routine about that, about a guy who throws all his friends in jail
Let's talk about that
(sharply) Let's not Sure, Jerry
Whatever you
(exasperated) Look, if you've got something for me to sign, let's have it and get it over with so  can get back
(interrupting) That wouldn't be right, Jerry
Not in your own house
(summoning his last bit of patience) have a lot of work to get to
(to ) How did they get here
We took a taxi, Jerry
But don't worry about us
You go ahead and do your work and we'll just take a stroll around until lunch is ready
You're a little thick, aren't you
(smiling as though complimented) Well, maybe a
What's he's saying, Rupert, is that he wants us out
Don't listen to her, Jerry
She doesn't understand anything about us
Don't get me into this
(to ) Call the station
goes back into the foyer, followed by the
There'll be a cab here in a few minutes
Now if you'll just wait at the gate
Look, Jerry, if 've said anything out of line, let's chalk it up to inexperience, okay
'll just go upstairs and get my tape and we can start working
It shouldn't take long and then you'll have the rest of the afternoon to yourself
've told you just as clearly as can
want you out of here and want you out now
Scram, beat it, vamoose, out
Is that plain enough
deftly pockets the enamel box
But what about my material
When are we going to go over it
Come on, Rupert, the man wants us to go
Tell her she's wrong, Jerry
Look, Mr
Langford
didn't know anything about all this
hardly know this guy
haven't seen him in years
Rita
So if there's anything  can do, any way  can make this up to you
She's nothing, Jerry
She's just some girl who works in a bar
Don't let her spoil things
starts herding  and  towards the door
Come on
Let's go
All 'm asking is fifteen minutes
That's all

He stops for a moment

But what about me , Jerry
What about my life

You can't just turn your back on me
'm not telling you again
There is a long pause as the truth finally sinks in just stares at  with disbelief that turns to anger
So this is the way it   works when you're big, huh
You    just play with people
Is that part    of the kick, Jerry

All    wrong
starts tugging at
Come on, Rupert
(to ) Shut up
(to ) You weren't my friend at all, were you
You were just playing some kind of game with me
Well, that's not going to stop me, Jerry
'm just going to work a little bit harder, that's all, use a little bit more enterprise
And not count on anybody
That's where made my mistake

It looks real
That's the whole point

He will

We'll come back tomorrow

Look, you're going to have him all to yourself

Is that him
No

That looks too much like him

Now  know you're wondering    what this is all about
Actually     you've got nothing to worry about
You just do what  tell you and    by, say, midnight, you'll be safe and    out of here
Of course if you try     anything clever, 'll kill you -- or    Marsha will
She knows how to use     this too
You realize what you're saying
Come on, Jerry
This isn't a spur of the moment thing
Give me a little credit, will you
looks over to a small phone table with a chair next to it
He motions to it with his head
(to ) Sit down
docilely sits by the phone
Now, you're going to call your office and tell them this: that unless a man who identifies himself as the King is allowed on the show tonight as the first guest, they'll never see you alive again
What
'll say it again

There are memos and lists and other papers on the table

He says it's urgent
(smiling) Yeah
Well, tell him 'll call him back

Okay, Martino, let's stop the bullshit

Okay, 'm listening

Give me that again
Wait a minute
What do we call our second cameraman

(into the phone) Helen Keller
(warning) No tricks, Jerry
: 95   :    '  - is still at the phone
Don't do anything, Jerry
Stay right there
Tell him we'll do     anything he wants
Tell him to cool     it
Are you okay
Look, tell him    to call us about five, okay
We'll     let him know what to do
And don't do     anything stupid

(panicky) know he's in a meeting and  don't care
've got to talk to him
No, he can not call me back
Don't you understand
This is an emergency : 98   :   '  - is seated on a chair whose back is pressed right up against the high, ornate brass bedstead at the foot of the bed
trains the gun on  now is unpacking a suitcase
He takes out a handsome blue suit, ruffled shirt, a bow tie, black shoes, underwear, socks, shaving equipment, soap, a hairbrush, a clothesbrush, a small shoe shine kit, aftershave lotion, deodorant and a dozen or so rolls of inch-and-a-half wide adhesive tape
He removes this stuff from a suitcase that is barely big enough to hold it -- so the mere packing of all this para- phernalia into such a small space represents something of an achievement
As he takes the stuff out, he talks to , his back turned to him
This wasn't an easy decision for me, Jerry, believe me
For one thing,  knew it meant we could never be friends again and that hurt me
It's hard to lose a friend, even one who has let you down
You always hope you can patch things up
You know, a guy like me doesn't make friends that easily
pauses a moment, then turns to , his voice filled with emotion
Why didn't you just listen to the tape when  asked you
Then wouldn't have to be doing all this
Was it really too much to expect -- a few minutes of your time to listen to something 'd worked on my whole life
's eyes shift rapidly
He is obviously calculating how to deal with
(with disarming charm) Hey, if that's what's bothering you, let's go over to my office and listen to that tape right now
Are you crazy, Jerry
Do you know what would happen to me
listens to this exchange a bit nervously
Gesturing to her gun, she says: Am  going to have to hold this thing all day
sees she has lowered it practically to her side
(to ) Just keep it on him
(to ) You know, Jerry
Friendship is a two- way street
All that time  was worrying about you and your ratings and everything, you couldn't have cared less about me
thinks rapidly for a beat or two
You're right
You know that was thoughtless
It's just that when you're doing a big show, it's hard to tell who your friends really are
was wrong
apologize
Why don't we just shake hands and forget the whole thing
(suspiciously) That's easy to say, Jerry
But  mean it
'll tell     them that the whole thing was a joke    and then we can go to my office and    listen to that tape
Come on
What      do you say
rises with his hand extended toward
(to , sharply) Sit down
looks to
said sit reluctantly sits down
(to ) What's the matter
You heard what he said
All of a sudden, with a gun on him, he wants to make up and be friends
And, once he's out the door, what happens then
What happens then, Jerry
You get to his office and they jump you, that's what happens, Rupert
She's right, Jerry
Not if  tell them not to
This is Jerry, Rupert,  give you my word
(to ) He gives me his word
Yeah
And what else
Come on, Rupert, 'm sick of waiting
And what else, Jerry
Come on, Rupert
My word's good enough, isn't it
stares at  for a few beats
Then he shakes his head sadly and says in a very quiet, discouraged voice
No, Jerry
It's not
(to ) Keep the gun up comes over to  with a few rolls of adhesive tape in his hand
'm sorry to do it this way, Jerry, but 'm no good at knots
Just put your arms up and out, okay
spreads his arms back against the brass bedstead
As  goes to tape them,  tries to grab him, but, with sudden, demonic force,  pins him against the bedstead
They are practically nose to nose
Oh, no, Jerry
None of that
Now hold still
: 99   :       - We are in the office of  , president of the National Broadcasting Network
sits behind his desk, facing a group which includes several other ,  ,  , , and his assistant,
They are in the midst of debate
Look,  tell you, the bureau is doing everything possible to locate Mr
Langford
Right now our men are out checking out every radical group in this city
Radical
They're willing to sacrifice their leader in order to get their message across, aren't they
You've got to figure that this is a desperate outfit
don't know who they are anymore than you do
But  do know 've got to stop them
Otherwise, what you're seeing here is just the first of a whole wave of these kinds of kidnappings
(upset) Does this mean we're not supposed to put him on
Who am  addressing, please
That's Bert Thomas
He produces the show
'm only saying, Mr
Thomas, that we can't allow this to reach the public
When the kidnappers call in, of course you're going to be cooperative
Promise them anything they want
After all, this King character is going to have to show up sooner or later
And once we get our hands on him, he'll tell us where Mr
Langford is
grinds his fist into his palm
: 100   :   '  - in the shower, shampooing
: 101   : The scene is as before
Sure
Let him go on if you have to
It's just a taping
You can always erase him afterwards, can't you
(pause) All 'm saying is this: don't put him on the air
That's fine, Inspector, but let's say he finishes his bit and you've worked him over
Questioned him, Mr
Thomas
There is light laughter
Okay, questioned him and he still won't talk
We get to eleven thirty and what do we do
Do we air him or what
There is a heavy pause
would say no
But they might kill Jerry
(breaking in) Okay, Burt
(to ) Thank you, Inspector
We appreciate your position and we'll do all we can to cooperate with you
But  have to tell you right now that, if it comes down to it, we're not taking any chances with Mr
Langford's life
understand but
(interrupting) If your men haven't been able to locate Mr
Langford by air time, we're going to have to put this King guy on, no matter what he's said
After all, Inspector, what's ten or fifteen minutes of talk show time against a man's life

He is talking to but we don't see anyone but
Open

Good
He is wrapping 's mouth shut but all we see is that he is doing something
Can you breathe
Both ways
In and out

He is strapped to the    bed    with tape and encased    like a mummy, only his eyes and    nose    showing
has     wrapped him in tape from tip to    toe

Have a good time

Yes, Mr, King

Everything's been arranged
Now if you'll just tell me a little    about the nature of your material, so    that we can

Thomas

Goodbye

She talks as she works
've got so much to tell you  just don't know what to begin with
Are you okay
mumbles incoherently through his gag and tape
Good
Tell me if you're not
guess you're wondering why  do stuff like this
think it's because 'm a Leo, but my shrink says 'm pathologically rebellious and self-destructive
You don't think 'm self-destructive, do you

Any one of these a writer

He's out
What if we don't run this King guy
Who'll fill the time
We'll stretch the other guests
But think we're going to wind up running him
For one thing, we've got to think about Jerry
And from a news point of view, we've got a responsibility to air this story
Exactly, Lou
(pause)  mean, who would you rather watch -- some tiger expert or a live kidnapper
But nobody's going to know he's a kidnapper
They'll think we've gone crazy
Then they'll read about it in the papers tomorrow and, believe me, tomorrow night, everyone in America will be watching Jerry talk about his experience
And he can put this King guy on rerun
You're going to put him on twice
What if his stuff's unusable
And remember what Patten said about
Hold on
(pause) We can always edit the guy
And, as for a wave of these things,  just don't buy the idea that there are that many people out there crazy enough to spend their lives in prison for a few minutes on television

Direct from New York
It's the Jerry Langford Show with guest host Tony Randall and his special guests -- Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz, pundit Gore Vidal, the one and only Zsa Zsa Gabor and another of Jerry's taped exclusives, an interview with Prince Ranier of Monaco
As always, Rick Ross and the Orchestra and me, Bert Canter
And now
say hello to Tony
: An  sign flashes like crazy
The  cheers wildly
In the back, we notice a handful of scattered about
strides on stage briskly, accepting the cheers of the crowd with his arms raised
He nods and then his eyes fix on those hastily written outsized cue cards
He reads them with a mixture of professionalism and wry distance, wanting to disown the words without seeming silly
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
Thank you
Thank you very much have some sad news for you
Earlier today, my writing staff was executed in Central Park by the network firing squad so there'll be no sensational Randall monologue this evening
The  cheers derisively
No embarrassing displays of emotion, please
(the  laughs) Instead, we're going to do something a little bit different this evening -- a lot different if you ask me
We're going to give you a glimpse into the future
It isn't often that you can call someone a sure thing in the entertainment business
After all, the verdict is always in your hands
But  think tonight, after you've met my first guest, you'll agree with me that he's destined for greatness -- in one way or another
So will you please give your warmest greeting to the newest King of Comedy, Rupert Pupkin
The music plays
The  sign flashes
The applauds heartily -- and nobody appears to fill the spotlight at the edge of the wings
The spotlight holds for what seems like an eternity
: 132   :     - Just hold
Three
Pick up the audience
: 133   :     - Finally after what seems like an eternity,  emerges, straightening his jacket a bit and trying to crane the kinks out of his neck
He is a bit tense but very high and in full command
As he delivers his monologue, is more confident, comfortable and self-assured than we have ever seen him
Good evening, ladies and gentleman
Let me introduce myself
My name is Rupert Pupkin
was born in Clifton, New Jersey, which was not, at that time, a federal offense
(laughter) Is there anyone here from Clifton
(silence) Good
We can all relax
Now, 'd like to begin by saying that my parents were too poor to afford me a childhood but the fact is nobody is allowed to be really poor in Clifton
Once you fall below eleven thousand you're exiled to Passaic
My parents did, in fact, put down the first two payments on my childhood
Then they tried to return me to the hospital as defective
But, like everyone else grew up in large part thanks to my mother
If she was only here today 'd say, "Hey, mom
What are you doing here
You've been dead for nine years
" (laughter) You should have seen my mother
She was wonderful -- blonde, beautiful, intelligent, alcoholic
(laughter) We used to drink milk together after school
Mine was homogenized
Hers was loaded
(laughter) Once she was picked up for speeding
They clocked her doing fifty -- in our garage
(laughter) When they tested her they found that her alcohol was two per cent blood
They took away her license and she died shortly afterwards
We used to joke together Mom and me, until the tears would stream down her face and she'd throw up
(laughter) And who would clean it up
Not Dad
He was too busy down at 'Grady's throwing up on his own
In fact, until  was sixteen, thought throwing up was a sign of maturity
While the other kids were off in the woods sneaking cigarettes, was hiding behind the house with my fingers down my throat
(laughter) never got anywhere until one day, my father caught me
Just as he was giving me a final kick in the stomach, for luck,  managed to heave all over his new shoes
"That's it," thought
"'ve made it
'm finally a man
" (laughter) As it turned out, that was the only time my father ever paid any real attention to me
He was usually too busy out in the park playing ball with my sister, Rose
And, today thanks to those many hours of practice, my sister Rose has grown into a fine man
(laughter) Me,  wasn't especially interested in athletics
The only exercise  ever got was when the other kids picked on me
They used to beat me up once a week, usually Tuesday
After a while, the school worked it into the curriculum
And, if you knocked me out, you got extra credit
(laughter) Except there was this one kid who was afraid of me kept telling him, "Hit me
Hit me
What's the matter with you
Don't you want graduate
" As for me,  was the only kid in the history of the school to graduate in traction
The school nurse tucked my diploma into my sling
But my only real interest, right from the beginning, was show business
Even as a young man, began at the very top, collecting autographs
(laughter) : 134   :   '  - Dinner is over
is sitting next to
As speaks, it is obvious that he is turning on the charm for strategic reasons
That was a wonderful dinner, Marsha
want you to know how much  enjoyed it
We can do it again
'd like to show you my gratitude
But it's a little difficult, like this
indicates his bonds
(in a tone of intimacy) Let's say  took all this off
What would you do to me
Tell me
: 135   :      -- We break in on a great burst of laughter
is just finishing his monologue
lot of you are probably wondering why Jerry couldn't make it this evening
Well, he's tied up -- and 'm the one who tied him
(laughter) You think 'm joking, but that's the only way  could break into show business -- by hijacking Jerry Langford
(laughter) 'm not kidding
Right now, Jerry Langford is strapped to a bedstead somewhere in the middle of this city
(laughter) Go ahead
Laugh
But the fact is
'm here
Tomorrow you'll know  wasn't kidding and you'll think  was crazy
But figured it this way: better to be King for a Night than Schmuck for a Lifetime
(laughter) Good night ladies and gentlemen
God bless you
The  applauds heartily
The music plays
And salutes  with a wave of his hand goes off stage after soaking up the applause
: 136   :     - group of  seize  and march him briskly through the backstage corridor towards the backstage door
: 137   :      - handful of  are waiting, among them the autograph hunters, ,  and

and  look on
trails after  and the
(to ) Could  have a ride
The  says nothing and starts getting in the limo
've never been in one
The limo pulls away
: 138   :    '   - stands among a crowd of  who have obviously been working him over
sits behind his desk
is at his side
The clock on the wall reads 10:20
Okay, Pupkin
We'll start all over again
Where is Langford
You know, we're going to find him sooner or later
'm trying to tell    you, Inspector
You let me walk out    of here, right
And as soon as 'm    seen my act on the show -- as soon    as 'm sure they've really put it on --    'll tell you where Jerry is and you'll    get him back safe and sound
Fine, Pupkin
Then why don't you watch the show here with us
That way we're all happy
(to ) What channel
Seven
We get that one in fine
So what do you say, Pupkin
Look, 'll say it again
You let me go now
motions to the  wearily with his head
They drag  off
looks up at the clock
: 139   :   '  - is frantically attempting to unwrap
With each pull of the tape,  yelps
There is a small tangle of unwrapped tape collecting around 's feet and sticking to 's clothes
Watch my hair
'm sorry, baby
We hear the sound of tape ripping
Ow
'm sorry
: 140   :   '  - is hustled before  again
Still nothing
glances at the clock
It is 11:05
've got to get out of here
You're not going anywhere, Pupkin
Now, where is he
'm telling you, Inspector,    if  don't see that show where want to see it, Jerry Langford is dead
My     people have instructions to execute    him unless they hear from me by    midnight
glances apprehensively at
Just where is it you want to watch this show
: 141   :   '  - is half unwrapped now
The place is covered with yard after yard of tape
is working frantically to finish unwrapping  who is helping now that his arms are free
Ow
God damnit
Not so fast
(working frantically) We haven't all night, baby
rips the tape off
Oh,  love you, baby
love you so much
: 142   :    - limo drives down Broadway, followed by an unmarked car
: 143   :     - and  sit up front, with the sits in the back between two
The limo pulls up in front of the bar-restaurant where  works
turns around in the front seat to address
Here we, are, Pupkin
don't know what this is all about, but as soon as you've seen yourself, you're going to talk to us or  promise you, you'll never see daylight again
'll need a couple of minutes, Inspector
What
After it's over,  want a couple of minutes
And 'll need ten dollars
Does anyone of you gentlemen have my wallet
Don't push me, Pupkin
condemned man's last request, Inspector
Well, 'll tell you right away, the answer is no, Pupkin
It's not much of a ransom, Inspector
(losing his temper) Look, 'm drawing the line, that's all
No ten dollars and that's it
(emphatically) No -- ten -- dollars
You understand
(in mollifying tones) Sure
Sure, Inspector
No ten dollars
(appeased) Okay
and no Jerry Langford
There is a pause as  stifles himself
Come on, it's getting late, Inspector
(exploding to     one of his ) Go ahead
Give him      his goddamned ten dollars
Give him      twenty
don't care
Just get him      out of here
One of the  in the back opens the door and and the other  get out
The unmarked car has pulled up behind the limo and other stand next to it
and the two  start walking the ten yards or so to the bar-restaurant
: 144   :    - - marches in flanked by the
The clock over the bar reads 11:30
looks up from talking with a  and sees
She says nothing
She just looks at him
There are five  at the bar working class  in their late fifties are half-stewed, the man telling the woman that her friend, Maud, isn't really her friend because she wants $150 for a used refrigerator
few seats down, two  in their mid- forties, in wind-breakers are locked in an intense but inaudible conversation
And, close to the television set which hangs over the far end of the bar sits a with glasses, who looks like an accountant
He is sipping a beer, his eyes fixed on the set where the  late movie is just showing its logo
marches up to the bar
(urgently to ) Turn on Langford
Seven
Hey
'm watching this keeps staring at
Just turn it
Come on
was here first, mister
You can't just walk in like this
It isn't fair
glances at the
can't      wait
He vaults onto the bar and turns the set to the     Langford Show, just as, on screen, he walks from the wings     onto the stage to the applause of the studio audience
Perched atop the bar, standing next to the image of himself,      looks down at , a smile of pride and triumph on     his face
: 145    -- walking onto television screens in various homes across America -- in a chic New York living room, in a suburban bedroom, in the parlor of an Indiana farmhouse, in a kitchen where a  is in the middle of a raging domestic quarrel, in an otherwise dark bedroom where a is in the throes of lovemaking, in a bar, a station house, in a television store window display
: 146   :   '  -- has just removed her dress and stands in      her bra and panties as  unwraps the last tape from      about his ankles
The room is swimming in tape, like an       enormous boa constrictor gone mad
moves towards       , her arms open
Oh, baby
Baby
frees his ankles of tape just in time to side-step and moves quickly to the dining room table where he grabs the gun
He trains it on her
Stop
moves toward him
He pulls the trigger, releasing a plastic pellet that hits  in the stomach, stinging her
Ow
glances down in horror at the gun which he now realizes is a toy and looks up in horror to see , bigger than life, bearing down on him
Don't be afraid of Marsha, baby
: 147   :   - - The  are watching the conclusion of Pupkin's monologue, along with the  and a split second after a joke
The  laugh, with the exception of the   who is waiting, in bad humor, for Pupkin's act to finish
The laugh reluctantly
, no longer standing on the bar, but back down with the others, watches with fascination
watches grimly, occasionally glancing at
on But  figured it this way: better to be King for a Night than Schmuck for a Lifetime
(audience and laugh)   Good night, ladies and gentlemen, and God bless you
The television audience applauds and the  applaud and cheer in good humor except for the
The -  leans across his  to yell at as the two  in windbreakers congratulate  at the same time
There is a brief moment of carnival excitement
- Hey, that's pretty good
(to ) Schmuck for a Lifetime
How do you think up all (to the ) You know      that stuff
who he's talkin' about
Your brother
-        It's a trick, that's What about your all
Larry can do it brother
as good as him
- What about him
Is it over now
- He's another one
He's funnier than Larry
Larry just makes a lot -  of faces
(getting a little angry) told you to shut up about my brother
(to )       Well, if nobody She doesn't know nuthin'
minds
takes all this praise and excitement with a shy smile of satisfaction, glancing at  from time to time for her reaction
She merely stares at  with a sad expression on her face
Come on, Rita
Don't spoil the party
(to the ) Drinks all around on me
- (in a loud voice, to - ) What about the hundred and fifty
We never saw a penny outta your brother
- That's because my brother is a family man , not like Phil
The argument between the -  and his continues at the end of the bar
The two  have resumed their intense conversation
(to the two ) What'll you have
'm okay
Thanks, pal
Me, too
The   has climbed up on the bar and has turned the back to the late movie
He sits enthralled by a scene of violence courtesy of Tony Curtis as the Boston Strangler
looks down the bar at the to offer them drinks, but they are lost in an argument over the relative merits of their brothers
turns to the
don't suppose you're allowed anything
(to )  guess nobody's in a celebrating mood
How about you
You want something
It's getting time, Pupkin
In a second
(in a sad, serious voice to ) That was true, wasn't it
about the kidnapping
nods and shrugs
Now you can say you knew me
That's something, anyway
Come on, Pupkin
(to , in a quiet, tender voice) guess 've got go
Take care of yourself, will you
And when you're bored -- you know, when you're brushing your teeth or something, give me a thought, okay
Okay
The  lead  out of the bar
The two are still buried in their intense, private conversation
The  and  walk past the -
- It's okay to talk about my sister, but we can't say nuthin' about Phil, is that it
- (to ) She's just had one too many
The  lead  onto the street
148   :     - As they walk the few steps to the car, the turns to
just don't get    it, Pupkin
You're gonna spend eight    years in the can -- "minimum" -- and    for what
Yeah, Pupkin
You threw it all away
(vaguely) We'll see
on , smiling
: 149   :        - The   is counting down
At zero, he points to who launches the orchestra into the Langford Show theme song
, standing stage right, speaks into the mike
And now
Direct from New York
The Jerry Langford Show, starring Jerry's special guest, out on bail, Rupert Pupkin, the kidnapping King of Comedy
The  applauds mightily and the   roll
As they roll, the music to the Langford Show continues and a  that shows  progressively taping to the back of a brass bedstead on stage as the two of them talk and laugh
By the end of the , is once again mummified and , having finished, bows and smiles
