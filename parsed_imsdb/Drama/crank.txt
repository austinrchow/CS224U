He jams his head under the Fossil sink and runs the water
He steadies himself against the matching black marble counter, staring at his hands

He's back on the floor, stunned
All the while we hear the faint sound of his

He begins crawling back into
, the living room, toward the telephone where he spots a plain black  tape propped up in front of a plasma screen with police ribbon wrapped around it, tied in a bow, like a present

He grabs the thing, fumbles to unwrap it, shoves it into the and pushes

What are we talking about
Don't fuck with me

There's  on the door

Look,  got to find Ricky Verona
Why would  know where

otal mad chaos ensues, ,  and the  packed in like sardines, everyone pointing guns at every one else's head, shoving each other back and forth, everyone screaming
The situation teeters at the very edge of an explosion of bloody violence
Finally  cuts through the din with a booming voice
- just the sound of ' heartbeat, pumping
(') (calmly) Can we all just get along
Can we
Beat
' gun is still trained on ' head
(') Now Chevy here has something he would like to discuss
So we are going to discuss it
In a civilized manner
Chevy
believe you had a question, or some point you were trying to make
Where's Verona
am not affiliated with Ricky Verona
(starting to lose it again) You pulled the Anselmo job together, don't try to bullshit me
He presses closer to
the  bristle
the situation is close to blowing up again
() 13
: (3) Easy
easy
now things are beginning to clarify
you see how that works
How discussion can lead to clarity
is running out of patience
(') Clearly you are operating under a false pretense
Ricky Verona and myself did not "pull the Anselmo job together
" In fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the Anselmo job
In fact, Ricky Verona owes me seventy five hunna dollars
That's not how  heard it
But that's the way it is
That's the way it is
So you see,  don't know where Ricky Verona is
Because if  knew where he is,  would probably be there right now, beating his Gucci ass down
tandoff
holds the gun with an unsteady hand, studying ' eyes, evaluating
hen, as much from exhaustion as from a sense that he's telling the truth, he lets his gun hand drop
Alright
The room lets out a collective exhale
The  mutter amongst themselves - damn right you better put that shit away, crazy bitch ass mother
Thank you
That's what 'm talking about
That resembles civility
begins to fade again
He slumps back, looking as though he might pass out
One of the  catches him, holds him up and shoves him away
(') Shit dude, what's the matter with you
() 14
: (4) Forget it
just gotta find Ricky Verona, that little bitch
understand that
You've made that point abundantly clear to all of us
He takes pity on him -  really looks like shit
few of the  lose interest, begin to filter out of the room
(') Now what can  do to help you
Look, just give me some coke,
You got any coke
gives him the look
, now you're insulting me
Come on, man,  know you got coke
You think every brother is carrying, is that it
Come on,  don't have time for this, just give me something
'm really dying here
can see that
No
You don't understand, 'm really fucking dying
if  don't
(losing it again) May  just have some coke, please
So this is medicinal use coke, that's what you're telling me
That's right

You got something for me, or what
shoves his gun into his belt, pulls out a wad of tens, tosses it into the sink
He's visibly fading
takes a quick look over the wad, pulls a little plastic bag out of his vest pocket, tosses it to
The bag hits  square in the forehead, hits sweat and
reaches for it lamely - it slides off and lands on the floor
His reflexes are not the best at this point
collapses to his knees, breaks it open and snorts it right out of the bag like a pig on his elbows and knees
The find this hilarious
shakes his head in disgust
(') Chevy
come on, man
We hear ' heart rate start to build, increase in volume
Suddenly he pops up to his feet, almost slips and falls, steadies himself

That's good
Oh that's good, right
pounds rhythmically on chest, keeping time with his beating heart
(') hy you looking for Verona anyway
Seems like some Chinese assholes hired him to kill me
Ah, so this is about the Don Kim situation
