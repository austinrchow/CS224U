href <b>// --> </b> ' "'   " By Frances Goodrich Albert Hackett Frank Capra Jo Swerling : Series of shots of various streets and buildings in the town of Bedford Falls, somewhere in New York State
The streets are deserted, and snow is falling
It is Christmas Eve
Over the above scenes we hear voices praying: ' owe everything to George Bailey
Help him, dear Father
' Joseph, Jesus and Mary
Help my friend Mr
Bailey
' Help my son George tonight
' He never thinks about himself, God; that's why he's in trouble
' George is a good guy
Give him a break, God
' love him, dear Lord
Watch over him tonight
' Please, God
Something's the matter with Daddy
' Please bring Daddy back
from the Bailey home and travels up through the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly toward a firmament full of stars
As the camera stops we hear the following heavenly voices talking, and as each voice is heard, one of the stars twinkles brightly: ' Hello, Joseph, trouble
' Looks like we'll have to send someone down  a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey
' George Bailey
Yes, tonight's his crucial night
You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately
Whose turn is it
' That's why  came to see you, sir
It's that clock-maker's turn again
' Oh  Clarence
Hasn't got his wings yet, has he
We've passed him up right along
' Because, you know, sir, he's got the of a rabbit
' Yes, but he's got the faith of a child  simple
Joseph, send for Clarence
small star flies in from left of screen and stops
It twinkles as Clarence speaks: ' You sent for me, sir
' Yes, Clarence
man down on earth needs our help
' Splendid
Is he sick
' No, worse
He's discouraged
At exactly ten-forty-five  tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift
' Oh, dear, dear
His life
Then 've only got an hour to dress
What are they wearing now
' You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey
' Sir
If  should accomplish this mission   mean  might  perhaps win my wings
've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir and people are beginning to talk
' What's that book you've got there
' The Adventures of Tom Sawyer
' Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings
' Oh, thank you, sir
Thank you
' Poor George
Sit down
' Sit down
What are
' If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you
' Well, naturally
Of course
' Well, keep your eyes open
See the town
The stars fade out from the screen, and a light, indistinguishable blur is seen
' Where
don't see a thing
' Oh,  forgot
You haven't got your wings yet
Now look, 'll help you out
Concentrate
Begin to see something
The blur on the screen slowly begins to take form
We see a group of young boys on top of a snow-covered hill
' Why, yes
This is amazing
' If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself
' Oh, wonderful
Group of boys
They are preparing to slide down the hill on large shovels
One of them makes the slide and shoots out onto the ice of a frozen river at the bottom of the hill
(as he slides) Yippee
' Hey, who's that
' That's your problem, George Bailey
' boy
' That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919
Something happens here you'll have to remember later on
Series of shots as four or five boys make the slide down the hill and out onto the ice
As each boy comes down the others applaud
George Bailey at bottom of slide
(through megaphone) And here comes the scare-baby, my kid brother, Harry Bailey
On top of hill, preparing to make his slide
'm not scared
(ad lib) Come on, Harry
Attaboy, Harry
Harry makes his slide very fast
He passes the marks made by the other boys, and his shovel takes him onto the thin ice at the bend of the river
The ice breaks, and Harry disappears into the water
'm coming, Harry
George jumps into the water and grabs Harry
As he starts to pull him out he yells: Make a chain, gang
chain
The other boys lie flat on the ice, forming a human chain
When George reaches the edge with Harry in his arms, they pull them both to safety
' George saved his brother's life that day
But he caught a bad cold which infected his left ear
Cost him his hearing in that ear
It was weeks before he could return to his after- school job at old man Gower's drugstore
Five or six boys are coming toward camera, arm in arm, whistling
Their attention is drawn to an elaborate horsedrawn carriage proceeding down the other side of the street
The carriage driving by
We catch a glimpse of an elderly man riding in it
The boys watching the carriage
Mr
Potter
' Who's that  a king
' That's Henry
Potter, the richest and meanest man in the county
The boys continue until they reach Gower's drugstore
The drugstore is old-fashioned and dignified, with jars of colored water in the windows and little else
As the kids stop: So long
(ad lib) Got to work, slave
Hee-haw
Hee- haw
George comes in and crosses to an old-fashioned cigar lighter on the counter
He shuts his eyes and makes a wish: Wish  had a million dollars
He clicks the lighter and the flame springs up
Hot dog
George crosses over to the soda fountain, at which Mary Hatch, a small girl, is seated, watching him
George goes on to get his apron from behind the fountain
(calling toward back room) It's me, Mr
Gower
George Bailey
Mr
Gower, the druggist, peering from a window in back room
We see him take a drink from a bottle
You're late
George behind soda fountain
He is putting on his apron
Yes, sir
Violet Bick enters the drugstore and sits on one of the stools at the fountain
She is the same height as Mary and the same age, but she is infinitely older in her approach to people
(with warm friendliness) Hello, George
(then, flatly, as she sees Mary) 'Lo, Mary
(primly) Hello, Violet
George regards the two of them with manly disgust
They are two kids to him, and a nuisance
He starts over for the candy counter
Two cents worth of shoelaces
She was here first
'm still thinking
(to Violet) Shoelaces
Please, Georgie
George goes over to the candy counter
(to Mary) like him
You like every boy
(happily) What's wrong with that
Here you are
George gives Violet a paper sack containing licorice shoelaces
Violet gives him the money
(the vamp) Help me down
(disgusted) Help you down
Violet jumps down off her stool and exits
Mary, watching, sticks out her tongue as she passes
Made up your mind yet
'll take chocolate
George puts some chocolate ice cream in a dish
With coconuts
don't like coconuts
You don't like coconuts
Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from
Lookit here from Tahiti  Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea
He pulls a magazine from his pocket and shows it to her
new magazine
never saw it before
Of course you never
Only us explorers can get it
've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society
He leans down to finish scooping out the ice cream, his deaf ear toward her
She leans over, speaking softly
Mary, whispering
Is this the ear you can't hear on
George Bailey, 'll love you till the day  die
She draws back quickly and looks down, terrified at what she has said
'm going out exploring some day, you watch
And 'm going to have a couple of harems, and maybe three or four wives
Wait and see
He turns back to the cash register, whistling
Taking in entrance to prescription room at end of fountain
Gower comes to the entrance
He is bleary-eyed, unshaven, chewing an old unlit cigar
His manner is gruff and mean
It is evident he has been drinking
George
George
Yes, sir
You're not paid to be a canary
No, sir
He turns back to the cash register when he notices an open telegram on the shelf
He is about to toss it aside when he starts to read it
: It reads: "We regret to inform you that your son, Robert, died very suddenly this morning of influenza stop
Everything possible was done for his comfort stop
We await instructions from you
Pres
" George puts the telegram down
goodness of heart expresses itself in a desire to do something for Gower
He gives the ice cream to Mary without comment and sidles back toward Gower
Gower, drunk, is intent on putting some capsules into a box
Mr
Gower, do you want something
Anything
No
Anything  can do back here
No
George looks curiously at Gower, realizing that he is quite drunk
Gower fumbles and drops some of the capsules to the floor
Capsules spilling on floor at their feet
George and Gower
'll get them, sir
He picks up the capsules and puts them in the box
Gower waves George aside, takes his old wet cigar, shoves it in his mouth and sits in an old Morris chair in the background
George turns a bottle around from which Gower has taken the powder for the capsules
Its label reads "
" George stands still, horrified
Take these capsules over to Mrs
Blaine's
She's waiting for them
George picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or say
His eyes go, harassed, to the bottle labeled poison
George's fingers fumble
Yes, sir
They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir
Ummmm
Gower stares moodily ahead, sucking his cigar
George turns to him, the box in his hand
Is it a charge, sir
Yes  charge
Mr
Gower,  think
Aw, get going
Yes, sir
George comes out into main room
As he puts on his cap he sees a Sweet Caporals ad which says: "   " With an inspiration, George dashes out the door and down the street
Mary follows him with her eyes
George runs down the street until he comes opposite a two- story building with a sign on it reading: "Bailey Building and Loan Association
" He stops
Potter's carriage is waiting at the entrance
Suddenly he runs up the stairs
The offices are ancient and a bit on the rickety side
There is a counter with a grill, something like a bank
Before a door marked: " , ", George's Uncle Billy stands, obviously trying to hear what is going on inside
He is a very good-humored man of about fifty, in shirt-sleeves
With him at the door, also listening, are Cousin Tilly Bailey, a waspish-looking woman, who is the telephone operator, and Cousin Eustace Bailey, the clerk
The office vibrates with an aura of crisis as George enters and proceeds directly toward his father's office
Uncle Billy listening at the door
As George is about to enter his father's office, uncle Billy grabs him by the arm
Avast, there, Captain Cook
Where you headin'
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy
Some other time, George
It's important
There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm
During the foregoing, Cousin Tilly has answered the telephone, and now she calls out: Uncle Billy
telephone
Who is it
Bank examiner
'   There are pieces of string tied around two of the fingers, obviously to remind him of things he has to do
Uncle Billy looking at his hand
Bank examiner
should have called him yesterday
Switch it inside
He enters a door marked: " , "
George stands irresolute a moment, aware of crisis in the affairs of the Bailey Building and Loan Association, but aware more keenly of his personal crisis
He opens the door of his father's office and enters
' George's father is seated behind his desk, nervously drawing swirls on a pad
He looks tired and worried
He is a gentle man in his forties, an idealist, stubborn only for other people's rights
Nearby, in a throne-like wheelchair, behind which stands the goon who furnishes the motive power, sits Henry
Potter, his squarish derby hat on his head
The following dialogue is fast and heated, as though the argument had been in process for some time
'm not crying, Mr
Potter
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse
All 'm asking is thirty days more
(interrupting) Pop
Just a minute, son
(to Potter) Just thirty short days
'll dig up that five thousand somehow
(to his goon) Shove me up
Goon pushes his wheelchair closer to the desk
Pop
Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages
Times are bad, Mr
Potter
lot of these people are out of work
Then foreclose
can't do that
These families have children
Pop
They're not my children
But they're somebody's children
Are you running a business or a charity ward
Well, all right
(interrupting) Not with my money
Mr
Potter, what makes you such a hardskulled character
You have no family  no children
You can't begin to spend all the money you've got
So  suppose  should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me
George cannot listen any longer to such libel about his father
He comes around in front of the desk
He's not a failure
You can't say that about my father
George, George
You're not
You're the biggest man in town
Run along
He pushes George toward the door
Bigger'n him
As George passes Potter's wheelchair he pushes the old man's shoulder
The goon puts out a restraining hand
Bigger'n everybody
George proceeds toward the door, with his father's hand on his shoulder
As they go: Gives you an idea of the Baileys
George and his father at the door
Don't let him say that about you, Pop
All right, son, thanks
'll talk to you tonight
Bailey closes the door on George and turns back to Potter
George stands outside the door with the capsules in his hand
: ' Gower talking on the telephone
George stands in the doorway
(drunkenly) Why, that medicine should have been there an hour ago
It'll be over in five minutes, Mrs
Blaine
He hangs up the phone and turns to George
Where's Mrs
Blaine's box of capsules
He grabs George by the shirt and drags him into the back room
Capsules
(shaking him) Did you hear what  said
(frightened) Yes, sir,
Gower starts hitting George about the head with his open hands
George tries to protect himself as best he can
What kind of tricks are you playing, anyway
Why didn't you deliver them right away
Don't you know that boy's very sick
(in tears) You're hurting my sore ear
Mary is still seated at the soda fountain
Each time she hears George being slapped, she winces
You lazy loafer
(sobbing) Mr
Gower, you don't know what you're doing
You put something wrong in those capsules
know you're unhappy
You got that telegram, and you're upset
You put something bad in those capsules
It wasn't your fault, Mr
Gower
George pulls the little box out of his pocket
Gower savagely rips it away from him, breathing heavily, staring at the boy venomously
Just look and see what you did
Look at the bottle you took the powder from
It's poison
tell you, it's poison
know you feel bad
and
George falters off, cupping his aching ear with a hand
Gower looks at the large brown bottle which has not been replaced on the shelf
He tears open the package, shakes the powder out of one of the capsules, cautiously tastes it, then abruptly throws the whole mess to the table and turns to look at George again
The boy is whimpering, hurt, frightened
Gower steps toward him
Don't hurt my sore ear again
But this time Gower sweeps the boy to him in a hug and, sobbing hoarsely, crushes the boy in his embrace
George is crying too
No
No
No
Don't hurt my ear again
(sobbing) Oh, George, George
Mr
Gower,  won't ever tell anyone
know what you're feeling
won't ever tell a soul
Hope to die, won't
Oh, George
: (1928) It is late afternoon
young man is looking over an assortment of luggage
Across the counter stands Joe Hepner, the proprietor of the store  he is showing a suitcase
An overnight bag  genuine English cowhide, combination lock, fitted up with brushes, combs
Nope
to him, he turns and we get our first glimpse of George as a young man to a  by now
Nope
Nope
Nope
Nope
Now, look, Joe
Now, look,
want a big one
Suddenly, in action, as George stands with his arms outstretched in illustration, the picture freezes and becomes a still
Over this hold-frame shot we hear the voices from Heaven: ' What did you stop it for
' want you to take a good look at that face
' Who is it
' George Bailey
' Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist
' That's the kid
' It's a good face
like it
like George Bailey
Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills
' Not a soul
' Did he ever marry the girl
Did he ever go exploring
' Well, wait and see
The arrested  of George springs to life again
Big - see
don't want one for one night
want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand
a great big one
see, a flying carpet, huh
don't suppose you'd like this old second- hand job, would you
He brings a large suitcase up from under the counter
Now you're talkin'
Gee whiz,  could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk
How much does this cost
No charge
That's my trick ear, Joe
It sounded as if you said no charge
(indicating name on suitcase) That's right
(as he sees his name) What's my name doing on it
little present from old man Gower
Came down and picked it out himself
(admiring the bag) He did
Whatta you know about that my old boss
What boat you sailing on
'm working across on a cattle boat
cattle boat
(as he exits) Okay,  like cows
: ' The place is practically the same except that it is now full of school kids having sodas, etc
juke box and many little tables have been added
It has become the hangout of the local small fry
There are now three kids jerking sodas
Gower is a different man now  sober, shaven and good-humored
He is behind the counter when George comes in
Gower's face lights up when he sees George
Mr
Gower
Mr
Gower
thanks ever so much for the bag
It's just exactly what  wanted
Aw, forget it
Oh, it's wonderful
Hope you enjoy it
George suddenly sees the old cigar lighter on the counter
He closes his eyes and makes a wish
Oh
Oh
Wish  had a million dollars
As he snaps the lighter the flame springs up
Hot dog
George shakes Gower's hand vigorously and exits
as George crosses the street, Uncle Billy, cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace are leaning out of the second floor window of the Building and Loan offices
Avast there, Captain Cook
You got your sea legs yet
Parlez-vous francais
Hey, send us some of them picture postcards, will you, George
Hey, George, don't take any plugged nickels
Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking
George waves up at them and continues on across the street
As George crosses the street
He spots Ernie and his cab, and Bert the motor cop, parked alongside
Hey, Ernie
Hiya, George
Hi, Bert
George
Ernie, 'm a rich tourist today
How about driving me home in style
Bert opens the door of the cab and puts George's suitcase inside
Sure, your highness, hop in
And, for the carriage trade,  puts on my hat
As George is about to enter the cab, he stops suddenly as he sees Violet (now obviously a little sex machine) come toward him
Her walk and figure would stop anybody
She gives him a sultry look
The three men by the cab, but including Violet
Good afternoon, Mr
Bailey
Hello, Violet
Hey, you look good
That's some dress you got on there
She reacts to this
Oh, this old thing
Why,  only wear it when  don't care how  look
As Violet goes by, George and Bert raise their heads above the top of the cab
On Violet's back as she goes
As she crosses the street, an elderly man turns to look at her and is almost hit by a car that pulls up with screeching brakes
Ernie sticks his head out form the driver's seat
How would you like
(as he enters cab) Yes
Want to come along, Bert
We'll show you the town
Bert looks at his watch, then takes another look at Violet's retreating figure
No, thanks
Think 'll go home and see what the wife's doing
Family man
: Pop Bailey is seated at the dinner table
Mrs
Bailey and Annie, the cook, look up toward the vibrating ceiling
There are  of terrific banging and scuffling upstairs
Annie pounds on the ceiling with a broom
(calling out) George
Harry
You're shaking the house down
Stop it
Oh, let 'em alone
wish  was up there with them
Harry'll tear his dinner suit
George
Mrs
Bailey is calling up the stairs
That's why all children should be girls
But if they were all girls, there wouldn't be any
Oh, never mind
(calling upstairs) George
Harry
Come down to dinner this minute
Everything's getting cold and you know we've been waiting for you
' Okay, Mom
She goes up the stairs
Pop is smiling and poking his plate
commotion is heard on the stairs, the boys imitating fanfare Down they come, holding their mother high between them on their hands
They bring her into the dining room and deposit her gracefully into Pop's lap
Here's a present for you, Pop
Pop kisses her
Mother gives Pop a quick hug, then turns with all the wrath she can muster on the two boys
Oh, you two idiots
George, sit down and have dinner
've eaten
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party
Look at you
don't care
It's George's tux
Annie crosses the room, holding her broom
Harry reaches out for her
If you lay a hand on me, 'll hit you with this broom
Annie, 'm in love with you
There's a moon out tonight
As he pushes her through the kitchen door, he slaps her fanny
She screams
The noise is cut off by the swinging door
George and his mother sit down at the table
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy  my last meal at the old Bailey boarding house
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure
Harry, as he sticks his head through the kitchen door
Pop, can  have the car
'm going to take over a lot of plates and things
What plates
Oh, Mom  'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen
Oh, no you don't
Harry, now, not my best Haviland
She follows Harry into the kitchen, leaving Pop and George
As she goes: Oh, let him have the plates, Mother
George and his father, eating at the table
There is a great similarity and a great understanding between them
Hope you have a good trip, George
Uncle Billy and  are going to miss you
'm going to miss you, too, Pop
What's the matter
You look tired
Oh,  had another tussle with Potter today
Oh
thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit
wonder what's eating that old money grubbing buzzard anyway
Oh, he's a sick man
Frustrated and sick
Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one
Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have
Hates us mostly,  guess
The dining room
Harry and his mother come out of the kitchen, Harry carrying a pie in each hand and balancing one on his head
them as they cross
Gangway
Gangway
So long, Pop
So long, son
Got a match
Very funny
Very funny
Put those things in the car and 'll get your tie and studs together
Okay, Mom
You coming later
You coming later, George
What do you mean, and be bored to death
Couldn't want a better death
Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too
hope it works
No gin tonight, son
Aw, Pop, just a little
No, son, not one drop
George and Pop at the table
Annie comes in with some dishes
Boys and girls and music
Why do they need gin
She exits
Father, did  act like that when graduated from high school
Pretty much
You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you
Your mother and  talked it over half the night
We have that all figured out
You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go
He's pretty young for that job
Well, no younger than  was
Maybe you were born older, George
How's that
say, maybe you were born older suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college
Oh, well, you know what 've always talked about  build things
design new buildings  plan modern cities all that stuff  was talking about
Still after that first million before you're thirty
No, 'll settle for half that in cash
Annie comes in again from the kitchen
Of course, it's just a hope, but you wouldn't consider coming back to the Building and Loan, would you
Annie stops serving to hear his answer
Well,
(to Annie) Annie, why don't you draw up a chair
Then you'd be more comfortable and you could hear everything that's going on
would if  thought 'd hear anything worth listening to
You would, huh
She gives George a look, and goes on out into the kitchen
Bailey smiles and turns to George
know it's soon to talk about it
Oh, now, Pop,  couldn't
couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office
He stops, realizing that he has hurt his father
Oh, 'm sorry, Pop
didn't mean that remark, but this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of pipe
'd go crazy
want to do something big and something important
(quietly) You know, George,  feel that in a small way we are doing something important
Satisfying a fundamental urge
It's deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace, and we're helping him get those things in our shabby little office
(unhappily) know, Dad
wish  felt
But 've been hoarding pennies like a miser in order to
Most of my friends have already finished college
just feel like if  don't get away, 'd bust
Yes
Yes
You're right, son
You see what  mean, don't you, Pop
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter
You've got talent, son
You get yourself an education
Then get out of here
Pop, do you want a shock
think you're a great guy
To cover his embarrassment, he looks toward the kitchen door and calls: Oh, did you hear that, Annie
Annie listening through glass in door
heard it
About time one of you lunkheads said it
George and his father at the table
'm going to miss old Annie
Pop, think 'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party
Have a good time, son
: At one end of the room an orchestra is playing
George wends his way through the dancing couples toward a supper table
He and Harry are carrying plates and pies
Here you are
Several of the boys take the plates from him
George looks at them, feeling very grown up and out of place
(introducing George) You know my kid brother, George
'm going to put him through college
Sam Wainwright comes in behind Harry, waggles his hands at his ears as he talks
Here comes George
Hello, hee-haw
George swings around, delighted to hear a familiar voice
Including Sam and Marty Hatch
Sam is assured and breezy, wearing very collegiate clothes
Oh, oh
Sam Wainwright
How are you
When did you get here
Oh, this afternoon
thought 'd give the kids a treat
Old college graduate now, huh
Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me
Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all
Yep
Sam sees Harry and leaves George in the middle of a gesture
(to Harry) Harry
You're the guy  want to see
Coach has heard all about you
He has
Yeah
He's followed every game and his mouth's watering
He wants me to find out if you're going to come along with us
Well,  gotta make some dough first
Well, you better make it fast
We need great ends like you  not broken down old guys like this one
George and Sam wiggle their fingers at their ears, saluting each other
Hee-haw
Hee-haw
An elderly, fussy school principal comes over to George
George, welcome back
Hello, Mr
Partridge, how are you
Putting a pool under this floor was a great idea
Saved us another building
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun
There's lots of stuff to eat and drink
Lots of pretty girls around
Violet Bick comes into the scene and turns to face George
She is waving her dance program at him
Hey, George
Hello, Violet
Hello, what am  bid
Marty Hatch enters scene
George
Hiya, Marty
Well, it's old home week
Do me a favor, will you, George
What's that
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary
Oh, yeah, yeah
"Momma wants you, Marty
" "Momma wants you, Marty
" Remember
Dance with her, will you
Oh
me
Oh, well,  feel funny enough already, with all these kids
Aw, come on
Be a sport
Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life
Aw, go on
(calling off) Hey, sis
Well, excuse me, Violet
Don't be long, Marty
don't want to be a wet nurse for
He stops suddenly as he sees Mary, staring at her
She is standing talking to one of the boys, Freddie, a glass of punch in her hand
For the first time, she is wearing an evening gown and she has gained assurance from the admiration of the boy with her
She turns around and for the first time she sees George
For a second she loses her poise, staring at him
' And the next thing  know, some guy came up and tripped me
That's the reason why  came in fourth
If it hadn't been for that
George, staring at Mary
' that race would have been a cinch
tried to find out who it was later
Still staring at George, and smiling
' but  couldn't find out
Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was because they'd be scared
They know
Mary and Freddie
Marty comes into scene, followed by George
what kind of
(interrupting) You remember George
This is Mary
Well, 'll be seeing you
Well
Well
Well
Now, to get back to my story, see
Mary hands her punch cup to Freddie, and she and George start dancing
Hey, this is my dance
Oh, why don't you stop annoying people
Well, 'm sorry
Hey
Following George and Mary as they dance
Well, hello
Hello
You look at me as if you didn't know me
Well,  don't
You've passed me on the street almost every day
Me
Uh-huh
Uh-uh
That was a little girl named Mary Hatch
That wasn't you
is heard offscreen, and the  stops
Harry on the orchestra platform, whistle in hand
Oyez  oyez  oyez
The big Charleston contest
The prize genuine loving cup
Those not tapped by the judges will remain on the floor
Let's go
As the  starts and couples begin dancing once more, they look at each other
'm not very good at this
Neither am
Okay  what can we lose
They start their Charleston
We see a    of various couples doing their routines, some good, some bad
Leaning against the railing around the dance floor, looking daggers at George
Mickey, a young punk who has had one too many, is beside him
What's the matter, Othello  jealous
Did you know there's a swimming pool under this floor
And did you know that button behind you causes this floor to open up
And did you further know that George Bailey is dancing right over that crack
And 've got the key
Freddie needs no more
He takes the key from Mickey and turns the switch
The floor begins to part in the middle, each half sliding under the bleacher seats
Pandemonium starts
Dancers begin to scream as they try to get off
Some are so engrossed in dancing they continue at top speed
Teachers and elders start to scurry off
As the floor opens, it reveals an attractive, lighted swimming pool
George and Mary are so busy dancing they don't notice the floor opening
Spotlights concentrate on them
They mistake the screams for cheers
George and Mary dancing
They're cheering us
We must be good
The crowd watching George and Mary dancing
They move backwards until finally they reach the edge of the floor and fall into the pool below
George and Mary still trying to dance in the water  the crowd on the edge cheering them  some of the crowd leap into the pool  the principal trying to restore order, finally clasps his hands like a diver and leaps in himself
: - George and Mary
The night is warm with a bright moon
George is dressed in jersey sweater and oversize football pants that keep wanting to come down
Mary is in an old white bath robe
Each is carrying their wet clothes tied into a bundle that leaves a trail of dripping water
As they near the camera we hear them singing: (singing) Buffalo Gals can't you come out tonight
Can't you come out tonight
Can't you come out tonight
Buffalo Gals can't you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon
Hot dog
Just like an organ
Beautiful
them as they proceed down the street
And  told Harry  thought 'd be bored to death
You should have seen the commotion in that locker room had to knock down three people to get this stuff we're wearing here
Here, let me hold that old wet dress of yours
He takes the bundle of clothes from Mary
They stop and look at each other
Do  look as funny as you do
guess 'm not quite the football type
You
look wonderful
You know, if it wasn't me talking 'd say you were the prettiest girl in town
Well, why don't you say it
don't know
Maybe  will say it
How old are you anyway
Eighteen
Eighteen
Why, it was only last year you were seventeen
Too young or too old
Oh, no
Just right
Your age fits you
Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on
Mary stops
George, to cover his embarrassment, talks quickly on: mean, without a dress
You look older
mean, younger
You look just
In his confusion George steps on the end of the belt of Mary's bath robe, which is trailing along behind her
She gathers the robe around her
Oh-oh
(holding out her hand) Sir, my train, please
pox upon me for a clumsy lout
He picks up the belt and throws it over her arm
Your
your caboose, my lady
You may kiss my hand
Ummmmm
Holding her hand, George moves in closer to Mary
Hey  hey, Mary
Mary turns away from him, singing "Buffalo Gals": (singing) As  was lumbering down the street
George looks after her; then picks up a rock from the street
Okay, then, 'll throw a rock at the old Granville house
Oh, no, don't
love that old house
It is a weather-beaten, old-fashioned two-storied house that once was no doubt resplendent
No
You see, you make a wish and then try and break some glass
You got to be a pretty good shot nowadays, too
Oh, no, George, don't
It's full of romance, that old place
'd like to live in it
In that place
Uh-huh
wouldn't live in it as a ghost
Now watch
right on the second floor there
George hurls the rock at the house
We hear the  of a window breaking
We see a grumpy old man in shirt sleeves in a rocking chair on the porch
He looks up as he hears the breaking glass
What'd you wish, George
Well, not just one wish
whole hatful, Mary
know what 'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that
'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and 'm going to see the world
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum
Then 'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know
and then 'm going to build things
'm gonna build air fields
'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high
'm gonna build bridges a mile long
As he talks, Mary has been listening intently
She finally stoops down and picks up a rock, weighting it in her hand
Are you gonna throw a rock
The old deserted house
Mary throws her rock, and once more we hear the  of breaking glass
Hey, that's pretty good
What'd you wish, Mary
Mary looks at him provocatively, then turns and shuffles off down the street, singing as she goes
George hurries after her
(singing) Buffalo Gals, can't you come out tonight
George joins her in the singing as they proceed down the street
(singing) can't you come out tonight, can't you come out tonight
Buffalo Gals can't you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon
What'd you wish when you threw that rock
Man on the porch of house, listening to George and Mary
They have stopped walking and now face one another
Oh, no
Come on, tell me
If  told you it might not come true
What is it you want, Mary
What do you want
You want the moon
Just say
Full moon shining through the trees
the word and 'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down
Hey, that's a pretty good idea
'll give you the moon, Mary
'll take it
And then what
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see
And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair
(pauses) Am  talking too much
As George finishes talking, he jumps up out of his chair: Yes
Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death
How's that
Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death
Want me to kiss her, huh
Aw, youth is wasted on the wrong people
As he speaks, the man leaves the porch and goes into his house, slamming the front door
Hey, hey, hold on
Hey, mister, come on back out here, and 'll show you some kissing that'll put hair back on your head
What are you
Mary runs off scene
George has been once more standing on the belt of her bath robe, so as she goes, her robe comes off
(looking around) Mary
He drops his bundle of clothes and picks up Mary's robe
He cannot see her anywhere
Okay,  give up
Where are you
We see Mary's face peering out from the leaves
Over here in the hydrangea bushes
George walks toward the bush
Here you are
Catch
He is about to throw her the robe, when a thought strikes him
Wait a minute
What am  doing
This is a very interesting situation
(from the bushes) Please give me my robe
Hmm
man doesn't get in a situation like this every day
(impatiently) 'd like to have my robe
Not in Bedford Falls, anyway
Mary thrashes around in the bushes
We hear her say: Ouch
Gesundheit
This requires a little thought here
(getting mad) George Bailey
Give me my robe
've heard about things like this, but 've never
(interrupting) Shame on you
'm going to tell your mother on you
Oh, my mother's way up the corner there
(desperate) 'll call the police
They're way downtown
They'd be on my side, too
'm going to scream
(thoughtfully) Maybe  could sell tickets
Let's see
No, the point is, in order to get this robe
've got it
'll make a deal with you, Mary
Headlights flash into the scene, and the old Bailey automobile drives in, with Harry at the wheel, and Uncle Billy beside him
George
George
Come on home, quick
Your father's had a stroke
George throws Mary's robe over the bush and gets into the car
Mary
Mary, 'm sorry
've got to go
Come on, George, let's hurry
Did you get a doctor
Yes, Campbell's there now
As the car drives off, Mary, now wearing the robe, rises up from the bush and follows the car with her eyes
: There are about twelve directors seated around a long table
They are the substantial citizens of Bedford Falls: Dr
Campbell, a lawyer, an insurance agent, a real estate salesman, etc
Prominently seated among them is Henry
Potter, his goon beside his wheelchair
Uncle Billy and George are seated among the directors
The Chairman of the Board is Dr
Campbell
They have folders and papers before them, on which they have been reporting
Before each of the directors there are individual reports for them to study
think that's all we'll need you for, George
know you're anxious to make a train
(rising) have a taxi waiting downstairs
want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months
Good luck to you at school, George
Thanks
Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting  to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey
Mr
Chairman, 'd like to get to my real purpose
Wait just a minute now
Wait for what
claim this institution is not necessary to this town
Therefore, Mr
Chairman, make a motion to dissolve this institution and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver
(angrily) George, you hear what that buzzard
Mr
Chairman, it's too soon after Peter Bailey's death to discuss chloroforming the Building and Loan
Peter Bailey died three months ago
second Mr
Potter's motion
Very well
In that case 'll ask the two executive officers to withdraw
Dr
Campbell rises from his seat
George and Uncle Billy start to collect their papers and leave the table
But before you go, 'm sure the whole board wishes to express its deep sorrow at the passing of Peter Bailey
Thank you very much
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization
'll go further than that
'll say that to the public Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan
Everyone looks at him surprised
(trying to control himself) Oh, that's fine, Potter, coming from you, considering that you probably drove him to his grave
Peter Bailey was not a business man
That's what killed him
Oh,  don't mean any disrespect to him, God rest his soul
He was a man of high ideals, so-called, but ideals without common sense can ruin this town
(picking up papers from table) Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop
You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi
You know
happen to know the bank turned down this loan, but he comes here and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars
Why
George is at the door of the office, holding his coat and papers, ready to leave
Well,  handled that, Mr
Potter
You have all the papers there
His salary, insurance
can personally vouch for his character
(sarcastically) friend of yours
Yes, sir
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money
What does that get us discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class
And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas
Now,  say
George puts down his coat and comes around to the table, incensed by what Potter is saying about his father
Just a minute  just a minute
Now, hold on, Mr
Potter
You're right when you say my father was no business man
know that
Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, 'll never know
But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was
Why, in the twenty- five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself
Isn't that right, Uncle Billy
He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me
But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr
Potter
And what's wrong with that
Why
Here, you're all businessmen here
Doesn't it make them better citizens
Doesn't it make them better customers
You
you said
What'd you say just a minute ago
They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home
Wait
Wait for what
Until their children grow up and leave them
Until they're so old and broken- down that they
Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars
Just remember this, Mr
Potter, that this rabble you're talking about
they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community
Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath
Anyway, my father didn't think so
People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle
Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be
'm not interested in your book
'm talking about the Building and Loan
know very well what you're talking about
You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you
That's what you're talking about,  know
(to the Board) Well, 've said too much
You're the Board here
You do what you want with this thing
Just one thing more, though
This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter
Come on, Uncle Billy
George leaves the room, followed by the jubilant Uncle Billy
Potter's face is grim with hatred
The "frustrated old man" remark was gall in his veins
Sentimental hogwash
want my motion
He is interrupted by a babble of talk, as the directors take up the argument George, visibly shaken, is busy with his bag, his papers
He is worried about the outcome of the meeting
Dissolving the Building and Loan will alter his plans
Uncle Billy follows him around, chattering
Boy, oh, boy, that was telling him, George, old boy
You shut his big mouth
(to Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace) You should have heard him
What happened
We heard a lot of yelling
Well, we're being voted out of business after twenty-five years
Easy come, easy go
(reading a newspaper) Here it is, "Help Wanted  Female
" Ernie is in the doorway
You still want me to hang around, George
(looking at his watch) Yeah, 'll be right down
Hey, you'll miss your train
You're a week late for school already
Go on
(indicating Board room) wonder what's going on in there
Oh, never mind
Don't worry about that
They're putting us out of business
So what
can get another job
'm only fifty-five
Fifty-six
Go on  go on
Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip, now you don't want to miss college too, do you
Dr
Campbell comes running out, all excited
George
George
They voted Potter down
They want to keep it going
Cousin Eustace, Cousin Tilly and Uncle Billy cheer wildly
Dr
Campbell and George shake hands
Whoopee
But they've got one condition  only one condition
What's that
That's the best part of it
They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place
Oh, no
But, Uncle Billy
You can keep him on
That's all right
As secretary you can hire anyone you like
(emphatically) Dr
Campbell, now let's get this thing straight
'm leaving
'm leaving right now
'm going to school
This is my last chance
Uncle Billy here, he's your man
But, George, they'll vote with Potter otherwise
The same stars we saw in the opening sequence are once more twinkling as we hear the voices form Heaven ' know
know
He didn't go
' That's right
Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college
Harry became a football star  made second team All American
' Yes, but what happened to George
Characteristic activity; a number of people waiting for the train
Uncle Billy is seated on a baggage wagon eating peanuts as George paces up and down in front of him
' George got four years older, waiting for Harry to come back and take over the Building and Loan
Oh, there are plenty of jobs around for somebody that likes to travel
Look at this
(takes some folders from his pocket) There
Venezuela oil fields wanted, man with construction experience
Here's the Yukon, right here  wanted, man with engineering experience
The  of the approaching train is heard
Thar she blows
You know what the three most exciting sounds in the world are
Uh-huh
Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner
No, no, no, no
Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles
Peanut
: The train comes to a stop, and Harry is among the first to get off, followed by an attractive girl about the same age as he is
George rushes into the shot, and as the brothers embrace: (joyously) There's the professor now
Old professor, Phi Beta Kappa Bailey
All American
Well, if it isn't old George Geographic Explorer Bailey
What
No husky dogs
No sled
(to Uncle Billy) Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a bit
Nobody ever changes around here
You know that
Oh, am  glad to see you
Say, where's Mother
She's home cooking the fatted calf
Come on, let's go
Oh, wait
Wait
Wait a minute
The group, including Ruth Dakin
This is the young lady who came off the train with Harry
In the excitement of greetings she has been momentarily forgotten
She stands, smiling, waiting
Hello
How do you do
Ruth Dakin
Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind
George and Uncle Billy stare, astounded
Huh
Well,  wired you  had a surprise
Here she is
Meet the wife
George is thunderstruck
He takes Ruth's hand
Well, what do you know  wife
Well, how do you do
Congratulations
Congratulations
What am  doing
He kisses Ruth
them down the platform
Harry, why didn't you tell somebody
(to Ruth) What's a pretty girl like you doing marrying this two-headed brother of mine
(smiling) Well, 'll tell you
It's purely mercenary
My father offered him a job
George stops, with a sinking feeling
Uncle Billy and Ruth continue out of shot
Harry stops with George
(as he moves off) Oh, he gets you and a job
Well, Harry's cup runneth over
George
about that job
Ruth spoke out of turn
never said 'd take it
You've been holding the bag here for four years, and
well,  won't let you down, George
would like to
Oh, wait a minute
forgot the bags
'll be right back
He runs out of the shot, George watching him
George slowly moves after Uncle Billy and Ruth
He is thinking deeply
' It was a surprise to me
This is the new Mrs
Bailey, my nephew's wife
Old, old friend of the family
' Oh, of course
've heard him speak of you
' And  want to tell you, we're going to give the biggest party this town ever saw
George as he comes into the scene
Ruth detaches herself from the group and offers George some popcorn
(to George) Here, have some popcorn
George, George, George
that's all Harry ever talks about
(quietly) Ruth, this
what about this job
Oh, well, my father owns a glass factory in Buffalo
He wants to get Harry started in the research business
Is it a good job
Oh, yes, very
Not much money, but a good future, you know
Harry's a genius at research
My father fell in love with him
And you did, too
Ruth nods, smiling
: Cousin Eustace is taking a photograph of the family group assembled on the porch
Flash bulbs go off, and the group breaks up
The crowd enters the front door of the house, leaving George and Uncle Billy on the porch
The latter is tipsy
He feels very high
Oh, boy, oh boy, oh boy
feel so good  could spit in Potter's eye think  will
What did you say, huh
Oh, maybe 'd better go home
He looks around for his hat, which is on his head
Where's my hat
Where's my
George takes the hat from Uncle Billy's head and hands it to him
Oh, thank you, George
Which one is mine
(laughing) The middle one
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy
Now, look  if you'll point me in the right direction
would you do that
George
Right down here
They descend the porch steps, and George turns his uncle around and heads him down the street
Old Building and Loan pal, huh
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down
That way, huh
He staggers out of the scene, and as George turns away, we hear Uncle Billy singing "My Wild Irish Rose
" There is a of cans and bottles, then: ' 'm all right
'm all right
"
the sweetest flower that grows
" George is standing at the garden gate
He takes some travel folders from his pocket, looks at them and throws them away
He is obviously disturbed about the latest turn of events
His mother comes out of the house and kisses him
Hello, Mom
(as she kisses him) That's for nothing
How do you like her
She nods toward the house, where Harry and Ruth, among a crowd of other couples, are dancing to the  of a phonograph, and can be seen through the front door
She's swell
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school
Uh-huh
Came back three days ago
Hmmmm
Nice girl, Mary
Hmmmm
Kind that will help you find the answers, George
Hmmm
Oh, stop that grunting
Hmmm
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary
Sure  Sam Wainwright
Hmmm
Yes
Sam's crazy about Mary
Well, she's not crazy about him
Well, how do you know
Did she discuss it with you
No
Well then, how do you know
Well, 've got eyes, haven't
Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around
Oh
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls
And all's fair in love and war
(primly) don't know about war
Mother, you know,  can see right through you  right back to your back collar button
trying to get rid of me, huh
Uh-huh
They kiss
Mrs
Bailey puts George's hat on his head
Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry
All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal,  think 'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking
Oh, George
Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction
This direction
(as he leaves) Good night, Mrs
Bailey
: George is standing in the middle of the street, hands in his pockets
As a girl passes, he turns and watches her for a moment
He is obviously undecided as to what he wants to do
' Violet is locking up for the night
couple of men are crowding around her, each one bent on taking her out
There is laughter, kidding and pawing
She looks up and sees George standing there
(to the two men) Excuse me
Now, wait a minute
think  got a date
But stick around, fellows, just in case, huh
We'll wait for you, baby
Violet as she crosses the street to George
Hello, Georgie-Porgie
Hello, Vi
He looks her over
Violet takes her beauty shop seriously and she's an eyeful
She senses the fact that George is far from immune to her attractions
She links her arm in his and continues on down the street with him
What gives
Nothing
Where are you going
Oh, 'll probably end up down at the library
They stop walking and face one another
George, don't you ever get tired of just reading about things
Her eyes are seductive and guileful as she looks up at him
He is silent for a moment, then blurts out: Yes
what are you doing tonight
(feigned surprise) Not a thing
Are you game, Vi
Let's make a night of it
(just what she wanted) Oh, 'd love it, Georgie
What'll we do
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass
Huh
Then we can go up to the falls
It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it
Then we can climb Mt
Bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and
we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal
(interrupting) George, have you gone crazy
Walk in the grass in my bare feet
Why, it's ten miles up to Mt
Bedford
Shhh
(angrily) You think just because you
By this time a small crowd has collected to watch the above scene
Violet is furious and talking in a loud voice, and George is trying to quiet her
Finally: Okay, just forget about the whole thing
As George stalks off, the crowd breaks into laughter, and we : George is walking slowly past the Hatch home
He stares meditatively at the simple dwelling, then he starts walking ahead
But after a few steps he turns around and starts back
He walks past the house a few yards, turns, and starts back again
Mary is looking out the window, watching George walk back and forth
What are you doing, picketing
George stops, startled, and looks up
Hello, Mary
just happened to be passing by
Yeah, so  noticed
Have you made up your mind
How's that
Have you made up your mind
About what
About coming in
Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit
George looks surprised at this
My mother just called you
Well, how did she know
Didn't you tell her
didn't tell anybody
just went for a walk and happened to be passing by
But Mary has disappeared from the window
(to himself) What do you
went for a walk, that's all
Mary is running down the stairs
(calling off) 'll be downstairs, mother
' All right, dear
Mary looks in a mirror at the bottom of the stairs and fixes her hair
She is plainly excited at George's visit
She runs into the parlor and puts a sketch on an easel
: It is a caricature of George throwing a lasso around the moon
Lettering on the drawing says: "George Lassos The Moon
" Mary runs into the hall, opens the phonograph and puts on a record of "Buffalo Gals
"  Then she opens the front door and stands there waiting for George
George is struggling with the gate  he finally kicks it open and starts slowly up the path toward Mary
Well, are you coming in or aren't you
Well, 'll come in for a minute, but didn't tell anybody  was coming over here
Mary and George are in the entrance hall
When did you get back
Tuesday
Where'd you get that dress
Do you like it
It's all right
thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them
Oh,  worked there for a couple of vacations, but  don't know guess  was homesick
(shocked) Homesick
For Bedford Falls
Yes, and my family and
oh, everything
Would you like to sit down
They go through the doorway into the parlor
All right, for a minute
still can't understand it though
You know didn't tell anybody  was coming here
Would you rather leave
No,  don't want to be rude
Well, then, sit down
George sees the cartoon on the easel and bends down for a close look at it
(indicating cartoon) Some joke, huh
George and Mary sitting on the divan
He is uncomfortable, and she tries desperately to keep the conversation alive
Well,  see it still smells like pine needles in here
Thank you
There is silence for a moment, then Mary joins in singing with the phonograph record which has been playing all through the above scene: (singing) "And dance by the light
" What's the matter
Oh, yeah
yeah
He looks at his watch, as though about to leave
Well,
(desperately) It was nice about your brother Harry, and Ruth, wasn't it
Oh
yeah, yeah
That's all right
Don't you like her
Well, of course  like her
She's a peach
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh
No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you
Mrs
Hatch, in a bathrobe, and with her hair in curlers, is leaning over the banister as she calls: Mary
Mary
George and Mary seated on the divan
' Who's down there with you
It's George Bailey, Mother
' George Bailey
What's he want
don't know
(to George) What do you want
(indignant) Me
Not a thing
just came in to get warm
(to mother) He's making violent love to me, Mother
George is aghast
' You tell him to go right back home, and don't you leave the house, either
Sam Wainwright promised to call you from New York tonight
(heatedly) But your mother needn't
you know didn't come here to
to
to
(rising) What did you come here for
don't know
You tell me
You're supposed to be the one that has all the answers
You tell me
(terribly hurt) Oh, why don't you go home
(almost shouting) That's where 'm going
don't know why  came here in the first place
Good night
As George leaves the room, the telephone in the hall starts ringing
(to George) Good night
' Mary
Mary
The telephone
It's Sam
Mary comes into the hall
(almost weeping) 'll get it
As Mary comes into the hall, she stops by the phonograph, which is still playing "Buffalo Gals," takes off the record with a jerk, and smashes it against the machine
The phone is still ringing
Mary, he's waiting
Hello
As Mary picks up the phone, George comes in from the front porch
forgot my hat
(overly enthusiastic) Hee-haw
Hello, Sam, how are you
' Aw, great
Gee, it's good to hear your voice again
George has stopped, hat in hand, to hear the first greetings
Oh, well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sam
(glances toward door, sees George still there) There's an old friend of yours here
George Bailey
You mean old moss-back George
Yes, old moss-back George
' Hee-haw
Put him on
Wait a minute
'll call him
(calling) George
He doesn't want to speak to George, you idiot
He does so
He asked for him
(calling) Geo
George, Sam wants to speak to you
She hands the instrument to George
Hello, Sam
' Sam is seated at his desk, while a couple of his friends are nearby, with highballs in their hands
(into phone) Well, George Baileyoffski
Hey, a fine pal you are
What're you trying to do
Steal my girl
(into phone) What do you mean
Nobody's trying to steal your girl
Here
here's Mary
' No, wait a minute
Wait a minute want to talk to both of you
Tell Mary to get on the extension
(to Mary) Here
You take it
You tell him
Mother's on the extension
As she hears this, she hastily hangs up the extension phone on which she has been listening
We can both hear
Come here
Mary takes the telephone from George and holds it so that of necessity George's cheek is almost against hers
He is very conscious of her proximity
(on phone) We're listening, Sam
' have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich
George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans
Huh
Yeah-yeah-yeah
soybeans
Yeah
' Well, Dad's snapped up the idea
He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester
How do you like that
Mary is watching George interestedly
George is very conscious of her, close to him
Rochester
Well, why Rochester
' Well, why not
Can you think of anything better
Oh,  don't know
why not right here
You remember that old tool and machinery works
You tell your father he can get that for a song
And all the labor he wants, too
Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down
' That so
Well, 'll tell him
Hey, that sounds great
Oh, baby,  knew you'd come through
Now, here's the point
Mary, Mary, you're in on this too
Now listen
Have you got any money
Money
Yeah
well, a little
' Well, now listen
want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear
And George,  may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan
This is the biggest thing since radio, and 'm letting you in on the ground floor
Oh, Mary
Mary
(nervously) 'm here
' Would you tell that guy 'm giving him the chance of a lifetime, you hear
The chance of a lifetime
As Mary listens, she turns to look at George, her lips almost on his lips
(whispering) He says it's the chance of a lifetime
George can stand it no longer
He drops the phone with a crash, grabs Mary by the shoulders and shakes her
Mary begins to cry
(fiercely) Now you listen to me
don't want any plastics
don't want any ground floors, and  don't want to get married  ever  to anyone
You understand that
want to do what want to do
And you're
and you're
He pulls her to him in a fierce embrace
Two meant for each other find themselves in tearful ecstasy
Oh, Mary
Mary
George
George
George
Mary
Mrs
Hatch is at the top of the stairs
She practically faints at what she sees
: Cousin Tilly's face fills the screen as she cries: Here they come
, and we hear the  of the Wedding March
People are crowded into the rooms: family, friends, neighbors
There is a din of conversation
Mary and George appear at the top of the stairs in traveling clothes, with Mrs
Hatch, red-eyed, behind them
Mary throws her bouquet, which is caught by Violet Bick
As they come out onto the porch, we see that it is raining
Nevertheless, Cousin Eustace has his camera equipment set up and is taking pictures of the group
George and Mary dodge through the rain and a shower of rice and get into Ernie's taxicab, which pulls away from the curb
Mrs
Bailey and Annie, the maid
First Harry, now George
Annie, we're just two old maids now
You speak for yourself, Mrs
' , George and Mary are in each other's arms
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me
Hey, look
Somebody's driving this cab
Ernie reaches over and hands George a bottle of champagne done up in gift wrappings
Bert, the cop, sent this over
He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles
Oh, look at this
Champagne
Good old Bert
By the way, where are you two going on this here now honeymoon
Where are we going
(takes out a fat roll of bills) Look at this
There's the kitty, Ernie
Here, come on, count it, Mary
feel like a bootlegger's wife
(holding up the money) Look
You know what we're going to do
We're going to shoot the works whole week in New York
whole week in Bermuda
The highest hotels  the oldest champagne  the richest caviar the hottest music, and the prettiest wife
That does it
Then what
(to Mary) Then what, honey
After that, who cares
That does it  come here
The cab passes the bank, and Ernie sees a crowd of people around the door
He stops the cab
Scurrying people under umbrellas, swarming around the bank doors
Panic is in the air
Attendants are trying to close down
Several people come running past the cab
, Don't look now, but there's something funny going on over there at the bank, George, 've never really seen one, but that's got all the earmarks of a run
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money in the bank, you better hurry
George, let's not stop
Let's go
George gets out of the cab and looks down the street
Just a minute, dear
Oh-oh
Please, let's not stop, George
'll be back in a minute, Mary
George runs off up the street, toward the Building and Loan
An iron grill blocks the street entrance to the Building and Loan
It has been locked
crowd of men and women are waiting around the grill
They are simply-dressed people, to whom their savings are a matter of life and death
George comes in with an assumed cheerful manner
The people look at him silently, half shamefaced, but grimly determined on their rights
In their hearts there is panic and fear
Hello, everybody
Mrs
Thompson, how are you
Charlie
What's the matter here, can't you get in
No one answers
He quickly unlocks the grill door and pushes it open
Followed by the crowd, George runs upstairs and into the outer offices of the Building and Loan
George, followed by the still-silent people, comes in
Uncle Billy is standing in the doorway to his private office, taking a drink from a bottle
He motions to George to join him
What is this, Uncle Billy
holiday
George
He points to George's office
George turns back cheerfully to the crowd
Come on in, everybody
That's right, just come in
George vaults over the counter
Now look, why don't you all sit down
There are a lot of seats over there
Just make yourselves at home
George, can  see you a minute
The people ignore George and remain standing in front of the teller's window
They all have their passbooks out
George hurries into his office where Uncle Billy is waiting for him
' Why didn't you call me
just did, but they said you left
This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle
All right now, what happened
How did it start
How does anything like this ever start
All  know is the bank called our loan
When
About an hour ago
had to hand over all our cash
All of it
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe
Holy mackerel
And then  got scared, George, and closed the doors
The whole town's gone crazy
The telephone rings
Uncle Billy picks it up
Yes, hello
George
it's Potter
Hello
' Potter seated behind his desk, his goon alongside him
Standing in front of the desk is a distinguished-looking man, obviously the president of the bank
He is mopping his brow with his handkerchief
George, there is a rumor around town that you've closed your doors
Is that true
Oh, well, 'm very glad to hear that
George, are you all right
Do you need any police
' (on phone) Police
What for
' Well, mobs get pretty ugly sometimes, you know
George, 'm going all out to help in this crisis
've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs
They'll close up for a week, and then reopen
' (to Uncle Billy) He just took over the bank
' may lose a fortune, but 'm willing to guarantee your people too
Just tell them to bring their shares over here and  will pay them fifty cents on the dollar
' (furiously) Aw, you never miss a trick, do you, Potter
Well, you're going to miss this one
George bangs the receiver down and turns to meet Uncle Billy's anxious look
' If you close your doors before six you will never reopen
He realizes George has hung up, and clicks the phone furiously
' George, was it a nice wedding
Gosh, wanted to be there
Yeah
(looks at string on Uncle Billy's finger) you can take this one off now
An ominous  of angry voices comes from the other room
George and Uncle Billy exit from George's office
More people have crowded around the counter
Their muttering stops and they stand silent and grim
There is panic in their faces
Now, just remember that this thing isn't as black as it appears
As George speaks, sirens are heard passing in the street below
The crowd turn to the windows, then back to George
have some news for you, folks
've just talked to old man Potter, and he's guaranteed cash payments at the bank
The bank's going to reopen next week
But, George,  got my money here
Did he guarantee this place
Well, no, Charlie
didn't even ask him
We don't need Potter over here
Mary and Ernie have come into the room during this scene
Mary stands watching silently
'll take mine now
No, but you
you
you're thinking of this place all wrong
As if  had the money back in a safe
The money's not here
Your money's in Joe's house
(to one of the men) right next to yours
And in the Kennedy house, and Mrs
Macklin's house, and a hundred others
Why, you're lending them the money to build, and then, they're going to pay it back to you as best they can
Now what are you going to do
Foreclose on them
got two hundred and forty-two dollars in here, and two hundred and forty-two dollars isn't going to break anybody
(handing him a slip) Okay, Tom
All right
Here you are
You sign this
You'll get your money in sixty days
Sixty days
Well, now that's what you agreed to when you bought your shares
There is a commotion at the outer doors
man (Randall) comes in and makes his way up to Tom
Tom
Tom, did you get your money
No
Well,  did
Old man Potter'll pay fifty cents on the dollar for every share you got
(shows bills) (ad lib) Fifty cents on the dollar
Yes, cash
(to George) Well, what do you say
Now, Tom, you have to stick to your original agreement
Now give us sixty days on this
(turning to Randall) Okay, Randall
He starts out
Are you going to go to Potter's
Better to get half than nothing
few other people start for the door George as he vaults over the counter quickly, speaking to the people
Tom
Tom
Randall
Now wait
now listen
now listen to me
beg of you not to do this thing
If Potter gets hold of this Building and Loan there'll never be another decent house built in this town
He's already got charge of the bank
He's got the bus line
He's got the department stores
And now he's after us
Why
Well, it's very simple
Because we're cutting in on his business, that's why
And because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides
The people are still trying to get out, but some of them have stood still, listening to him
George has begun to make an impression on them
Joe, you lived in one of his houses, didn't you
Well, have you forgotten
Have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken-down shack
(to Ed) Here, Ed
You know, you remember last year when things weren't going so well, and you couldn't make your payments
You didn't lose your house, did you
Do you think Potter would have let you keep it
(turns to address the room again) Can't you understand what's happening here
Don't you see what's happening
Potter isn't selling
Potter's buying
And why
Because we're panicky and he's not
That's why
He's picking up some bargains
Now, we can get through this thing all right
We've got to stick together, though
We've got to have faith in each other
But my husband hasn't worked in over a year, and  need money
How am  going to live until the bank opens
got doctor bills to pay
need cash
Can't feed my kids on faith
During this scene Mary has come up behind the counter
Suddenly, as the people once more start moving toward the door, she holds up a roll of bills and calls out How much do you need
George jumps over the counter and takes the money from Mary
Hey
got two thousand dollars
Here's two thousand dollars
This'll tide us over until the bank reopen
(to Tom) All right, Tom, how much do you need
(doggedly) Two hundred and forty-two dollars
(pleading) Aw, Tom, just enough to tide you over till the bank reopens
'll take two hundred and forty-two dollars
George starts rapidly to count out the money
Tom throws his passbook on the counter
There you are
That'll close my account
Your account's still here
That's a loan
Mary turns and slips out through the crowd, followed by Ernie
George hands the two hundred and forty-two dollars to Tom, and speaks to Ed, the next in line
Okay
All right, Ed
got three hundred dollars here, George
Uncle Billy takes out his wallet and takes out all the cash he's got
Aw, now, Ed
what'll it take till the bank reopens
What do you need
Well,  suppose twenty dollars
Twenty dollars
Now you're talking
Fine
Thanks, Ed
(to Mrs
Thompson, next in line) All right, now, Mrs
Thompson
How much do you want
But it's your own money, George
Never mind about that
How much do you want
can get along with twenty, all right
(counting it out) Twenty dollars
And 'll sign a paper
You don't have to sign anything know you'll pay it back when you can
That's okay
(to woman next in line) All right, Mrs
Davis
Could  have seventeen-fifty
Seven
(he kisses her) Bless your heart, Of course you can have it
You got fifty cents
(counting) Seven
: George, Uncle Billy and Cousin Tilly are behind the counter, watching the minute hand of a clock on the wall as George counts off the seconds
Cousin Eustace is ready to close the door
(excitedly) We're going to make it, George
They'll never close us up today
(counting) Six
five
four
three
two
one
Bingo
Cousin Eustace slams and locks the door, and scurries around the counter to join the others
We made it
Look
(holds up two bills) look, we're still in business
We've still got two bucks left
Uncle Billy is taking a drink out of his bottle
Well, let's have some of that
Get some glasses, Cousin Tilly
(to Uncle Billy) We're a couple of financial wizards
Those Rockefellers
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons
We'll save them for seed
toast
They raise their glasses
toast
toast to Papa Dollar and to Mama Dollar, and if you want the old Building and Loan to stay in business, you better have a family real quick
wish they were rabbits
wish they were too
Okay, let's put them in the safe and see what happens
The four of them parade through the office; George puts the two dollars in the safe
As George comes out: (handing out cigars) Wedding cigars
(startled) Oh-oh
wedding
Holy mackerel, 'm married
Where's Mary
Mary
(he runs around looking for her) Poor Mary
Look, 've got a train to catch
(looks at his watch) Well, the train's gone
wonder if Ernie's still here with his taxicab
George rushes into his office to look out the window
(on telephone) George, there's a call for you
Look, will you get my wife on the phone
She's probably over at her mother's
Mrs
Bailey is on the phone
' don't want Mrs
Bailey
want my wife
Mrs
Bailey
Oh, that's my wife
Here, 'll take it in here
(picks up phone) Mary
Hello
Listen, dear, 'm sorry
What
Come home
What home
Three-twenty Sycamore
Well, what
whose home is that
The Waldorf Hotel, huh
: An old-fashioned, run-down house, unpainted and warped by the weather
It once had class but has not been lived in for years
This is the house that George and Mary will live in from now on
The rain is pouring down
faint glow of light shines out from bottom windows
George hurries into scene
He stops to make sure it is the right number before going up the steps
Bert and man working in rain, sorting through travel posters
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this
How would you like to get a ticket next week
Haven't you any romance in you
Sure  have, but  got rid of it
(reading poster) Liver pills
Who wants to see liver pills on their honeymoon
What
They want romantic places, beautiful places
places George wants to go
sharp whistle is heard
Ernie is leaning from the window
Hey, Bert, here he comes
Come on, we got to get this up
He's coming
Who
The groom, idiot
Come on, get that ladder
(disgustedly) What are they  ducks
Bert and the man are putting up travel posters to cover up the broken windows
Get that ladder up here
All right  all right
Hurry up
hurry up
hurry up
'm hurrying
George is approaching the front door of the house, on which a sign is hanging: "Bridal Suite
" Ernie looks out through the curtain covering the broken glass of the front door
Hiya
Good evening, sir
Ernie opens the door, revealing himself as a homemade butler
This has been accomplished by rolling up his pants and putting on an old coachman's hat
George enters
Entray, monsieur, entray
The house is carpetless, empty  the rain and wind cause funny noises upstairs
huge fire is burning in the fireplace
Near the fireplace a collection of packing boxes are heaped together in the shape of a small table and covered with a checkered oil cloth
It is set for two
bucket with ice and a champagne bottle sit on the table as well as a bowl of caviar
Two small chickens are impaled on a spit over the fire
phonograph is playing on a box, and a string from the phonograph is turning the chickens on the spit
The phonograph is playing "Song of the Islands
" Mary is standing near the fireplace looking as pretty as any bride ever looked
She is smiling at George, who has been slowly taking in the whole set-up
Through a door he sees the end of a cheap bed, over the back of which is a pair of pajamas and a nightie
Ernie exits and closes the door
(tears in her eyes) Welcome home, Mr
Bailey
(overcome) Well, 'll be
Mary, Mary, where did you
They rush into each other's arms and hold each other in ecstasy
Bert and Ernie, standing in the pouring rain, start singing " Love You Truly
" They remain embraced
Oh, Mary
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house
This is what  wished for
Darling, you're wonderful
They finish their song, and Ernie kisses Bert on the forehead
Bert slams Ernie's hat on his head
: In front of one of the miserable shacks that line the street are two vehicles
One of them is George Bailey's rickety car, and the other is an even more rickety truck piled high with household goods
The Martini family is moving
The family consists of Martini, his wife and four kid of various ages, from two to ten
George and Mary are helping the Martinis move
About a dozen neighbors crowd around
Martini and George, assisted by three of the Martini children, are carrying out the last of the furniture
As they emerge from the house, one of the neighbors, Schultz, calls out: Martini, you rented a new house
Rent
(to George) You hear what he say, Mr
Bailey
What's that
own the house
Me, Giuseppe Martini
own my own house
No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field
Hurry, Maria
Yes
Come on
(to Mary) Bring the baby
(to Martini) 'll bring the kids in the car
Oh, thank you, Mr
Bailey
Mary gets in the front seat of the car, with the baby in her arms
All right, kids  here  get in here
Now get right up on the seat there
Get the
get the goat
The family goat gets in the back seat with the three kids
Goodbye, everybody
All in
The rickety caravan starts off down the street, to the cheers of the neighbors
: Sign hanging from a tree "Welcome to Bailey Park
" follow George's car and the old truck laden with furniture as they pass  we hear Martini's voice singing " Sole Mio
" Bailey Park is a district of new small houses, not all alike, but each individual
New lawns here and there, and young trees
It has the promise when built up of being a pleasant little middle class section
: ' George and Mary are on the porch of the new house, with the Martinis lined up before them
Mr
and Mrs
Martini, welcome home
The Martinis cross themselves
Sam Wainwright is standing in front of his big black town car
Sam is the epitome of successful, up-and-coming businessman
His wife, in the car, is a very attractive, sophisticated-looking lady, dripping with furs and jewels
Sam is watching George across the street
That old George
he's always making a speech
(to George) Hee-haw
(wiggles his hands) (to Mary) Sam Wainwright
Oh, who cares
(to Mrs
Martini, giving her loaf of bread) Bread
That this house may never know hunger
Mrs
Martini crosses herself
(giving her salt) Salt
That life may always have flavor
(handing bottle to Martini) And wine
That joy and prosperity may reign forever
Enter the Martini castle
The Martinis cross themselves, shaking hands all around
The kids enter, with screams of delight
Mrs
Martini kisses Mary
' Potter seated in his wheelchair at his desk, with his goon beside him
His rent collector, Reineman, is talking, pointing to maps spread out on the desk
Look, Mr
Potter, it's no skin off my nose
'm just your little rent collector
But you can't laugh off this Bailey Park any more
Look at it
buzzer is heard, and Potter snaps on the dictaphone on his desk
' Congressman Blatz is here to see you
(to dictaphone) Oh, tell the congressman to wait
(to Reineman) Go on
Fifteen years ago, a half-dozen houses stuck here and there
(indicating map) There's the old cemetery, squirrels, buttercups, daisies
Used to hunt rabbits there myself
Look at it today
Dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw
Ninety per cent owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you
Your Potter's Field, my dear Mr
Employer, is becoming just that
And are the local yokels making with those David and Goliath wisecracks
Oh, they are, are they
Even though they know the Baileys haven't made a dime out of it
You know very well why
The Baileys were all chumps
Every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost the Building and Loan to build
If were you, Mr
Potter
(interrupting) Well, you are not me
(as he leaves) As  say, it's no skin off my nose
But one of these days this bright young man is going to be asking George Bailey for a job
Reineman exits
The Bailey family has been a boil on my neck long enough
He flips the switch on the dictaphone
' Yes, sir
Come in here
George and Mary are talking to Sam Wainwright in front of the latter's car
Hs wife, Jane, is now out of the car
We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're going to drive on down to Florida
Oh
Why don't you have your friends join us
Why, sure
Hey, why don't you kids drive down with us, huh
Oh, 'm afraid  couldn't get away, Sam
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh
Jane,  offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold
Oh, now, don't rub it in
'm not rubbing it in
Well,  guess we better run along
There is handshaking all around as Sam and Jane get into their car
Awfully glad to have met you, Mary
Nice meeting you
Goodbye
Goodbye, George
So long, George
See you in the funny papers
Goodbye, Sam
Have fun
Thanks for dropping around
(to chauffeur) To Florida
(to George) Hee-haw
Hee-haw
The big black limousine glides away, leaving George standing with his arm around Mary, gazing broodingly after it
They slowly walk over to George's old car and look at it silently
: ' Potter is lighting a big cigar which he has just given George
The goon is beside Potter's chair, as usual
Thank you, sir
Quite a cigar, Mr
Potter
You like it
'll send you a box
(nervously) Well,
suppose 'll find out sooner or later, but just what exactly did you want to see me about
(laughs) George, now that's just what  like so much about you
(pleasantly and smoothly) George, 'm an old man, and most people hate me
But  don't like them either, so that makes it all even
You know just as well as  do that  run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan
You know, also, that for a number of years 've been trying to get control of it
or kill it
But haven't been able to do it
You have been stopping me
In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing
Take during the depression, for instance
You and were the only ones that kept our heads
You saved the Building and Loan, and  saved all the rest
Yes
Well, most people say you stole all the rest
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers
Now,  have stated my side very frankly
Now, let's look at your side
Young man, twenty- seven, twenty-eight
married, making, say
forty a week
(indignantly) Forty-five
Forty-five
Forty-five
Out of which, after supporting your mother, and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, ten, if you skimp
child or two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the ten
Now, if this young man of twenty-eight was a common, ordinary yokel, 'd say he was doing fine
But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel
He's an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man  who hates his job  who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as  do
young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born young man
the smartest one of the crowd, mind you, a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places, because he's trapped
Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters
Do  paint a correct picture, or do  exaggerate
(mystified) Now what's your point, Mr
Potter
My point
My point is,  want to hire you
(dumbfounded) Hire me
want you to manage my affairs, run my properties
George, 'll start you out at twenty thousand dollars a year
George drops his cigar on his lap
He nervously brushes off the sparks from his clothes
(flabbergasted) Twenty thou
twenty thousand dollars a year
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe
You wouldn't mind that, would you, George
Would
(looking around skeptically) You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you
You know, this is me, you remember me
George Bailey
Oh, yes, George Bailey
Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard
Well, what about the Building and Loan
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success
'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today
Is it a deal or isn't it
Well, Mr
Potter,
know ought to jump at the chance, but just
wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty- four hours to think it over
Sure, sure, sure
You go on home and talk about it to your wife
'd like to do that
In the meantime, 'll draw up the papers
All right, sir
(offers hand) Okay, George
(taking his hand) Okay, Mr
Potter
As they shake hands, George feels a physical revulsion
Potter's hand feels like a cold mackerel to him
In that moment of physical contact he knows he could never be associated with this man
George drops his hand with a shudder
He peers intently into Potter's face
(vehemently) No
no
no
no, now wait a minute, here
don't have to talk to anybody
know right now, and the answer is no
Doggone it
(getting madder all the time) You sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money
Well, it doesn't, Mr
Potter
In the
in the whole vast configuration of things, 'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider
You
He turns and shouts at the goon, impassive as ever beside Potter's wheelchair
And that goes for you too
As George opens the office door to exit, he shouts at Mr
Potter's secretary in the outer office And it goes for you too
: ' The room is modestly furnished with just a cheap bed, a chair or two, and a dresser
Mary is asleep in the bed
As George comes in, his head is filled with many confusing thoughts, relating to incidents in his past life
' You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town
Buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, going to New York on a business trip a couple of times a year
Maybe to Europe once in a while
George takes off his hat and coat, moves over to the dresser and stares at his reflection in the mirror
' know what 'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the year after that
'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet, and 'm going to see the world
And 'm going to build things
'm going to build air fields
'm going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high
'm going to build a bridge a mile long
While the above thoughts are passing through George's head, his attention is caught by a picture on the wall near the dresser: : It is the sketch of George lassoing the moon that we first saw in Mary's living room
The lettering reads: "George Lassos The Moon
" ' What is it you want, Mary
You want the moon
If you do, just say the word; 'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down for you
Mary is now awake, and starts singing their theme song: (singing) Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight, won't you come out tonight, won't you come out tonight
George crosses over and sits on the edge of the bed
Hi
Hi
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me
To keep from being an old maid
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town

You didn't even have a honeymoon promised you

Mary nods her head happily
: Over the following    we hear the voices of Joseph and Clarence in Heaven

' Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls
' No

He is obviously tired and discouraged as he starts up the stairs
The knob on the banister comes off in his hand
' Night after night George came back late from the office
Potter was bearing down hard

George is walking along the sidewalk reading a newspaper
It is a raw, gusty day, and his overcoat and muffler flap in the breeze
Draped around one arm is a large Christmas wreath
Under his other arm are several more copies of the paper
' This morning, day before Christmas, about ten
Bedford Falls time
George comes to where Ernie, the taxi driver, is standing on the sidewalk
(holding out paper) Hi, Ernie, look at that
: The front page of the paper, the Bedford Falls Sentinel
The headline reads: " "
The subhead tells of a plan for a giant jubilee and parade, to be followed by a banquet, in honor of Commander Harry Bailey,
on his way home from Washington after receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor
There's a large picture of President Truman pinning the coveted medal on Harry's bosom, in the midst of dignitaries; a picture of the transport which Harry saved
Practically the whole front page is devoted to the story
(kidding) Gonna snow again
(outraged) What do you mean  it's gonna snow again
Look at the headlines
know   know   know
think it's marvelous
Gower comes running across the street from his drugstore and joins them
(reading) Commander Harry Bailey
Mr
Gower, look at this  the second page
(gives them papers) Now look, this is for you
This is for you, this is for you
(as he leaves) See you again
Uncle Billy is walking along the street, humming happily to himself
He sees some men decorating the Court House with banners and bunting  there is a huge sign reading: "Welcome Home Harry Bailey" (calls out) Be sure you spell the name right
The offices are unchanged, still small-time and old-fashioned
The same office force, albeit a few years older: Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace
Seated on a chair is a middle-aged man with a brief case
The outer door opens and George enters: Extra
Extra
Read all about it
Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace are talking on the phone
George
George
It's Harry now on long distance from Washington
Harry
What do you know about that
He reversed the charges
It's okay, isn't it
What do you mean it's okay
For a hero
(takes the phone) Harry
Oh, you old seven kinds of a son of a gun
Congratulations
How's Mother standing it
She did
What do you know
(to Eustace) Mother had lunch with the President's wife
Wait till Martha hears about this
What did they have to eat
(on phone) What did they have to eat
Harry, you should see what they're cooking up in the town for you
Oh, are they
(to Eustace) The Navy's going to fly Mother home this afternoon
In a plane
What
Uncle Billy
(to Eustace) Has Uncle Billy come in yet
No, he stopped at the bank first
(on phone) He's not here right now, Harry
Cousin Eustace has turned away from George and caught a glimpse of the man waiting in the chair
This is Carter, the bank examiner, come for his annual audit of the books of the Building and Loan
(on phone) But look
(interrupting) George
(on phone) now tell me about it
(interrupting) George, that man's here again
What man
(nervously) Bank
bank examiner
Oh
(on phone) Talk to Eustace a minute, will you
'll be right back
He gives the phone to Eustace, puts down his wreath and goes over to Carter
They shake hands
Good morning, sir
Carter  bank examiner
Mr
Carter, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
We're all excited around here
(shows him paper) My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor
The President just decorated him
Well,  guess they do those things
Well,  trust you had a good year
Good year
Well, between you and me, Mr
Carter, we're broke
Yeah, very funny
Well
(leading him into office) now, come right in here, Mr
Carter
(as they go) Although  shouldn't wonder when you okay reverse charges on personal long distance calls
George, shall we hang up
No, no
He wants to talk to Uncle Billy
You just hold on
(in doorway) Now, if you'll cooperate, 'd like to finish with you by tonight want to spend Christmas in Elmira with my family
don't blame you at all, Mr
Carter, Just step right in here
We'll fix you up
Uncle Billy is filling out a deposit slip at one of the desks
(writing) December twenty-fourth
He takes a thick envelope from his inside pocket and thumbs through the bills it contains
It is evidently a large sum of money
Eight thousand
Potter is being wheeled in by his goon
Various bank officials run over to greet him  he is reading a newspaper
Uncle Billy has finished filling out his slip, and comes over to taunt Potter, the envelope containing the money in his hand
Well, good morning, Mr
Potter
What's the news
He grabs the paper from Potter's hand
(') Well, well, well, Harry Bailey wins Congressional Medal
That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys
You just can't keep those Baileys down, now, can you, Mr
Potter
How does slacker George feel about that
Very jealous, very jealous
He only lost three buttons off his vest
Of course, slacker George would have gotten two of those medals if he had gone
Bad ear
Yes
Uncle Billy folds Potter's paper over the envelope containing his money, and flings his final taunt at the old man
After all, Potter, some people like George had to stay home
Not every heel was in Germany and Japan
In a cold rage, Potter grabs his paper and wheels off toward his office
Uncle Billy smiles triumphantly and goes toward deposit window with his deposit slip
Uncle Billy and bank teller at the window
(still chuckling) Good morning, Horace
Uncle Billy hands the bank book over
The teller opens it, starts to punch it with rubber stamps
guess you forgot something
Huh
You forgot something
What
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit
Sure, sure  am
Well, then
it's usually customary to bring the money with you
Oh, shucks
Uncle Billy searches through every pocket he has
(looks bewildered) know  had
The teller, knowing the old man's vagaries, points to one of the numerous string tied around his fingers
How about that one there
Hmm
Well,
' Potter is now behind his desk
He spreads the newspaper out in front of him, muttering as he does so
Bailey
He sees the envelope, looks inside at the money
Then, to his goon, indicating the office door: Take me back there
Hurry up
(as they go) Come on, look sharp
Potter opens the door just a little, and peers through into the bank
Uncle Billy looks around for the money envelope
It is not there
He looks puzzled, thinks hard, then a look of concern creeps into his eyes
He starts thumping his pockets, with increasing panic, and looks in the waste paper basket on the floor
He finally rushes through the door and out into the street
' (to goon) Take me back
The goon wheels him back to his desk
He is deep in thought, with a crafty expression on his face
Uncle Billy running across the street in the direction of the Building and Loan
George coming from room where he has just left the bank examiner
Just make yourself at home, Mr
Carter
'll get those books for you
He sees Violet Bick standing there
Oh, hello, Vi
George, can  see you for a second
Why, of course you can
Come on in the office here
He hears a noise, and sees Uncle Billy entering the office
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry
He's on the telephone
George and Violet enter his private office
Uncle Billy comes hurrying in
Hurry, Uncle Billy, hurry
Long distance, Washington
Hey, here's Harry on the phone
Harry, your nephew, remember
(on phone) Here he is
Uncle Billy picks up the phone and speaks distractedly, without knowing what he is saying
(on phone) Hello
hello
Yes, Harry  yes
everything
everything's fine
He hangs up agitatedly, muttering to himself as he goes into his own office
Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace look after him, dumbfounded
should have my head examined
Eight thousand dollars
It's got to be somewhere
' George has just finished writing something, and is slipping the paper into an envelope
(hands it to her) Here you are
(bitterly) Character
If  had any character, 'd
It takes a lot of character to leave your home town and start all over again
He pulls some money from his pocket, and offers it to her
No, George, don't
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you
know, but
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat
Want to walk to New York
You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls
(taking money) Yeah  sure
It's a loan
That's my business
Building and Loan
Besides, you'll get a job
Good luck to you
She looks at him, then says a strange thing
'm glad  know you, George Bailey
She reaches up and kisses him on the cheek, leaving lipstick
George opens the door for her
As George and Violet come through the door, they are being watched by Cousin Tilly, Cousin Eustace and the bank examiner, who is still waiting to go to work on the books
Say hello to New York for me
Yeah  yeah
sure  will
Now, let's hear from you
Violet sees the lipstick on George's cheek, and dabs at it with her handkerchief
What's the matter
Merry Christmas, Vi
Merry Christmas, George
She exits
Mr
Bailey
Oh, Mr
Carter, 'm sorry
'll be right with you
(to Cousin Tilly) Uncle Billy in
Yeah, he's in his office
' As George opens the door he sees Uncle Billy frantically looking for the missing envelope
The office is in a mess, drawers are opened, and papers scattered on the floor and on the desk
Unc
What's going on
The bank examiner's here, and
(in dismay) He's here
Yeah, yeah
He wants the accounts payable
George stops short, suddenly aware of the tragic old eyes looking up at him
What's the matter with you
Uncle Billy gestures nervously for George to come in
He does so and closes the door
Cousin Tilly is at her switchboard, and Cousin Eustace standing beside her
Carter is still waiting in the doorway to his office
Suddenly the door opens and George comes striding out
He goes directly to the safe and starts searching, but doesn't find the money
Then he goes to the cash drawer in the counter, and looks through it
Eustace
Yeah
Come here a minute
Cousin Eustace runs over to George
Did you see Uncle Billy with any cash last night
He had it on his desk counting it before he closed up
Uncle Billy and George are retracing the former's steps through the snow, looking everywhere for the missing money
They pause for a moment on the sidewalk
Now look, did you buy anything
Nothing
Not even a stick of gum
All right
All right
Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house
This way
They continue on down the street on their search
' Potter is peering through the slats of the Venetian blind, watching them as they go
George and Uncle Billy continue their search
: ' shabby, old-fashioned, gas-lit room which has been turned almost inside out and upside down in an effort to locate the missing money
Drawers of an old secretary have been pulled out and are on the floor
Every conceivable place which might have been used by Uncle Billy to put the money has been searched
George, his hair rumpled, is feverishly pursuing the search
Uncle Billy is seated behind the desk, his head on his hands
And did you put the envelope in your pocket
Yeah
yeah
maybe
maybe
(shouts) Maybe  maybe
don't want any maybe
Uncle Billy, we've got to find that money
(piteously) 'm no good to you, George
Listen to me
Do you have any secret hiding place here in the house
Someplace you could have put it
Someplace to hide the money
(exhausted) 've been over the whole house, even in rooms that have been locked ever since  lost Laura
Uncle Billy starts sobbing hysterically
George grabs him by the lapels and shakes him
(harshly) Listen to me
Listen to me
Think
Think
(sobbing) can't think any more, George can't think any more
It hurts
George jerks him to his feet and shakes him
Uncle Billy stands before him like a frisked criminal, all his pockets hanging out, empty
George's eyes and manner are almost maniacal
(screaming at him) Where's that money, you stupid, silly old fool
Where's the money
Do you realize what this means
It means bankruptcy and scandal, and prison
He throws Uncle Billy down into his chair, and still shouts at him: That's what it means
One of us is going to jail
Well, it's not going to be me
George turns and heads for the door, kicking viciously at a waste basket on the floor as he goes
Uncle Billy remains sobbing at the table, his head in his arms
: ' Janie (aged eight) is seated at the piano playing "Hark, the Herald Angels Sing," which she practices during the remainder of this scene
There is a Christmas tree all decorated near the fireplace
At a large table Mary is busy putting cellophane bows and decorations on gift packages
At a small table Pete (aged nine) is seated with pad and pencil in the throes of composition
On the floor Tommy (aged three) is playing with a toy vacuum cleaner
We hear the  of a door open and close
Mary turns and sees George enter the hall, a slight powdering of snow on his head and shoulders
As George comes into the house
Hello darling
Hello Daddy, hello daddy
(indicating tree) How do you like it
George sneezes violently
Bless you
Did you bring the wreath
Did you bring the Christmas wreath
What
What wreath
The Merry Christmas wreath for the window
(gruffly) No
left it at the office
Is it snowing
Yeah, just started
Where's your coat and hat
Left them at the office
Mary stares at him, aware that something unusual has happened
What's the matter
(bitterly) Nothing's the matter
Everything's all right
George slumps into an armchair and lifts Tommy onto his lap
Mary is helping Pete decorate the Christmas tree
Go on, Pete, you're a big boy
You can put the star up
Way up at the top
That's it
Fill in that little bare spot right there
That's it
(to George) Isn't it wonderful about Harry
We're famous, George
'll bet  had fifty calls today about the parade, the banquet
Your mother's so excited, she
During this scene, George has been sitting in the chair, hugging Tommy to him, and crying quietly
Mary realizes that something is seriously wrong, and breaks off
Janie is thumping away at the piano
Must she keep playing that
(hurt) have to practice for the party tonight, Daddy
Mommy says we can stay up till midnight and sing Christmas carols
Can you sing, Daddy
(to George) Better hurry and shave
The families will be here soon
(rising from chair) Families
don't want the families over here
Mary leads him out toward the kitchen
Come on out in the kitchen with me while  finish dinner
They exit with Tommy hanging onto George's coat-tails, and pulling at him
them
Excuse me
excuse me
As they go toward kitchen
Have a hectic day
(bitterly) Oh, yeah, another big red letter day for the Baileys
Daddy, the Browns next door have a new car
You should see it
(turns on him) Well, what's the matter with our car
Isn't it good enough for you
Yes, Daddy
(tugging at coat) Excuse me, excuse me
They come through the door
(annoyed) Excuse you for what
burped
All right, darling, you're excused
Now go upstairs and see what little Zuzu wants
Tommy leaves, and Mary turns to the stove
Zuzu
What's the matter with Zuzu
Oh, she's got a cold
She's in bed
Caught it coming home from school
They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat
What is it, a sore throat or what
Just a cold
The doctor says it's nothing serious
The doctor
Was the doctor here
Yes,  called him right away
He says it's nothing to worry about
Is she running a temperature
What is it
Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six
She'll be all right
George paces about the kitchen, worried
Gosh, it's this old house
don't know why we don't all have pneumonia
This drafty old barn
Might as well be living in a refrigerator
Why did we have to live here in the first place and stay around this measly, crummy old town
(worried) George, what's wrong
Wrong
Everything's wrong
You call this a happy family
Why did we have to have all these kids
(coming in) Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"
(shouts) don't know
Ask your mother
George goes toward doorway
Where're you going
Going up to see Zuzu
We hear his footsteps as he leaves
Mary looks after him, puzzled and concerned, then comes over to Pete
He told me to write a play for tonight
------
The knob on the banister comes off in his hand, and for a moment he has an impulse to hurl it into the living room
Then, he replaces the knob, and goes on up the stairs
' The  of Janie at the piano can be heard, the same monotonous rhythm over and over
Zuzu (aged six) is sitting up in her bed, the lamp burning beside her
She is holding her prize flower
George tiptoes in
Then, as he sees she's awake, he comes over, sitting on the edge of her bed
Hi, Daddy
Well, what happened to you
won a flower
She starts to get out of bed
Wait now
Where do you think you're going
Want to give my flower a drink
All right, all right
Here, give Daddy the flower
'll give it a drink
She shakes her head and presses the flower to her
few petals fall off
She picks them up
Look, Daddy
paste it
Yeah, all right
Now, 'll paste this together
She hands him the fallen petals and the flower
He turns his back to Zuzu, pretending to be tinkering with the flower
He sticks the fallen petals in his watch pocket, rearranges the flower, and then turns back to Zuzu
There it is, good as new
Give the flower a drink
George puts the flower in a glass of water on the table beside her bed
Now, will you do something for me
They whisper
What
Will you try to get some sleep
'm not sleepy
want to look at my flower
know   know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden
It will
Uh-huh
She closes her eyes and relaxes on the bed
George pulls the covers over her
He bends down and his lips touch a tendril of the child's hair
Then he gets up and tiptoes out of the room
Janie is still pounding with grim determination at the piano
Pete is seated at the table writing
Tommy is playing with his toy vacuum cleaner
The telephone rings
Telephone
Mary comes in and picks up the phone
'll get it
(on phone) Hello
Yes, this is Mrs
Bailey
George enters shot, and stands listening to her
Oh, thank you, Mrs
Welch
'm sure she'll be all right
The doctor says that she ought to be out of bed in time to have her Christmas dinner
Is that Zuzu's teacher
(hand over receiver) Yes
Let me speak to her
He snatches the phone from Mary
(on phone) Hello
Hello, Mrs
Welch
This is George Bailey
'm Zuzu's father
Say, what kind of a teacher are you anyway
What do you mean sending her home like that, halfnaked
Do you realize she'll probably end up with pneumonia on account of you
(shocked) George
She puts a restraining hand on his arm
He shakes it off
She cannot know that George's tirade against Mrs
Welch is really a tirade against the world, against life itself, against God
Over the phone we hear Mrs
Welch's voice sputtering with protest
Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for  to have teachers like you
Silly, stupid, careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on
You know, maybe my kids aren't the best-dressed kids; maybe they don't have any decent clothes
Mary succeeds in wresting the phone from George's hand
Aw, that stupid
Mary speaks quickly in to the phone
Hello, Mrs
Welch
want to apologize
hello
hello
(to George) She's hung up
(savagely) 'll hang her up
But the telephone is suddenly alive with a powerful male voice calling: ' Now, who do you think you are
George hears this and grabs the receiver from Mary
(to Mary) Wait a minute
(on phone) Hello
Who is this
Oh, Mr
Welch
Okay, that's fine, Mr
Welch
Gives me a chance to tell you what  really think of your wife
Mary once more tries to take the phone from him
George
(raving at her) Will you get out and let me handle this
(into phone  shouting) Hello
Hello
What
Oh, you will, huh
Okay, Mr
Welch, any time you think you're man enough
Hello
Any
But before he can think of an insult to top Welch's, we hear a click on the phone
Oh
He hangs up the receiver, and turns toward the living room
His face is flushed and wet
Daddy, how do you spell "Hallelujah"
(shouts) How should  know
What do you think am, a dictionary
He yells at Tommy, noisily playing with his vacuum cleaner
Tommy, stop that
Stop it
Janie is still practicing at the piano, monotonously
(savagely) Janie, haven't you learned that silly tune yet
You've played it over and over again
Now stop it
Stop it
The room has suddenly become ominously quiet, the only being George's labored breathing
George goes over to a corner of the room where his workshop is set up  a drawing table, several models of modern buildings, bridges, etc
Savagely he kicks over the models, picks up some books and hurls them into the corner
Mary and the children watch, horrified
George looks around and sees them staring at him as if he were some unknown wild animal
The three children are crying
(gasping for breath) 'm sorry, Mary, Janie
'm sorry didn't mean
you go on and practice
Pete,  owe you an apology, too
'm sorry
What do you want to know
(holding back his tears) Nothing, Daddy
Mary and the children stare at him, stunned by his furious outburst
There is silence in the room
What's the matter with everybody
Janie, go on
told you to practice
(shouts) Now, go on, play
Janie breaks into sobs
Oh, Daddy
(in an outburst) George, why must you torture the children
Why don't you
The sight of Mary and the children suffering is too much for George
Mary
He looks around him, then quickly goes out the front door of the house
Mary goes to the phone, picks it up
Bedford, two-four-seven, please
Is Daddy in trouble
Shall  pray for him
Yes, Janie, pray very hard
Me, too
You too, Tommy
(on phone) Hello, Uncle Billy
: '       8:00
Potter is seated at his desk, his goon beside him
He is signing some papers
George is seated in a chair before the desk, without a hat or coat, covered lightly with snow
'm in trouble, Mr
Potter
need help
Through some sort of an accident my company's short in their accounts
The bank examiner's up there today
've got to raise eight thousand dollars immediately
(casually) Oh, so that's what the reporters wanted to talk to you about
(incredulous) The reporters
Yes
They called me up from your Building and Loan
Oh, there's a man over there from the
's office, too
He's looking for you
(desperate) Please help me, Mr
Potter
Help me, won't you please
Can't you see what it means to my family
'll pay you any sort of a bonus on the loan
any interest
If you still want the Building and Loan, why
(interrupting) George, could it possibly be there's a slight discrepancy in the books
No, sir
There's nothing wrong with the books
've just misplaced eight thousand dollars
can't find it anywhere
(looking up) You misplaced eight thousand dollars
Yes, sir
Have you notified the police
No, sir
didn't want the publicity
Harry's homecoming tomorrow
(snorts) They're going to believe that one
What've you been doing, George
Playing the market with the company's money
No, sir
No, sir
haven't
What is it  a woman, then
You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick
(incredulous) What
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money
can't get hold of him
He's in Europe
Well, what about all your other friends
They don't have that kind of money, Mr
Potter
You know that
You're the only one in town that can help me
see
've suddenly become quite important
What kind of security would  have, George
Have you got any stocks
(shaking his head) No, sir
Bonds
Real estate
Collateral of any kind
(pulls out policy) have some life insurance, a fifteen thousand dollar policy
Yes
how much is your equity in it
Five hundred dollars
(sarcastically) Look at you
You used to be so cocky
You were going to go out and conquer the world
You once called me a warped, frustrated old man
What are you but a warped, frustrated young man
miserable little clerk crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help
No securities  no stocks  no bonds  nothing but a miserable little five hundred dollar equity in a life insurance policy
You're worth more dead than alive
Why don't you go to the riff-raff you love so much and ask them to let you have eight thousand dollar
You know why
Because they'd run you out of town on a rail
But 'll tell you what 'm going to do for you, George
Since the state examiner is still here, as a stockholder of the Building and Loan, 'm going to swear out a warrant for your arrest
Misappropriation of funds manipulation  malfeasance
George turns and starts out of the office as Potter picks up the phone and dials
All right, George, go ahead
You can't hide in a little town like this
George is out of the door by now
to Potter
(on phone) Bill
This is Potter
George comes out of the bank into the falling snow
He crosses the street, tugs at the door of his old car, finally steps over the door, and drives off
' An attractive little roadside tavern, with the name "Martini's" in neon lights on the front wall
' The place is an Italian restaurant with bar
The bottles sparkle
There are Christmas greens and holly decorating the place
It has a warm, welcoming spirit, like Martini himself, who is welcoming new arrivals
The booths and the checkered-cloth-covered tables are full
There is an air of festivity and friendliness, and more like a party than a public drinking place
George is seated at the bar  he has had a great deal to drink, far more than he's accustomed to
' (greeting new customers) Merry Christmas
Glad you came
' How about some of that good spaghetti
' We got everything
During this,    to George
Nick, the bartender, is watching him solicitously
Seated on the other side of George is a burly individual, drinking a glass of beer
George is mumbling: God
God
Dear Father in Heaven, 'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me, show me the way
'm at the end of my rope
Show me the way, God
(friendly) Are you all right, George
Want someone to take you home
George shakes his head
Martini comes over to his side
(worried) Why you drink so much, my friend
Please go home, Mr
Bailey
This is Christmas Eve
The ugly man next to George, who has been listening, reacts sharply to the name "Bailey
" Bailey
Which Bailey
This is Mr
George Bailey
Without any warning, the burly man throws a vicious punch at George, who goes down and out
Martini, Nick and several others rush to pick him up
(to George) And the next time you talk to my wife like that you'll get worse
She cried for an hour
It isn't enough she slaves teaching your stupid kids how to read and write, and you have to bawl her out
(furious) You get out of here, Mr
Welch
Mr
Welch reaches in his pocket for money
Now wait
want to pay for my drink
Never mind the money
You get out of here quick
All right
You hit my best friend
Get out
Nick and Martini shove Welch out the door, then run back to help George to his feet
George's mouth is cut and bleeding
You all right, George
(stunned) Who was that
He's gone
Don't worry
His name is Welch
He don't come in to my place no more
Oh  Welch
That's what  get for praying
The last time he come in here
You hear that, Nick
Yes, you bet
Where's my insurance policy
(finds it in pocket) Oh, here
He starts for the door
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr
Bailey
'm all right
Nick and Martini try to stop him, but he shrugs them off
Oh, no  you don't feel so good
'm all right
Please don't go away  please
George opens the door and exits to the street
: George's car comes along the empty street, through the falling snow, suddenly swerves and crashes into a tree near the sidewalk of a house
George gets out to look at the damage, and savagely kicks at the open door of the car, trying to shut it
The noise brings the owner of the house running out
What do you think you're doing
George stands unsteadily near the car, shaken by the accident
The front lights are broken and the fender is ripped
George stands dully looking at the damage
The owner comes up, looking at his tree
He leans over to examine the damages
(with indignation) Now look what you did
My greatgrandfather planted this tree
George staggers off down the street, paying no attention to the man
Hey, you
Hey, you
Come back here, you drunken fool
Get this car out of here
George is crossing the approach to the bridge when a truck swings around the corner and nearly hits him
Hey, what's the matter with you
Look where you're going
The truck turns onto the bridge, and George takes a narrow catwalk at the railing
George has stopped by the railing at the center of the bridge
The snow is now falling hard
from George's angle  the water, dotted with floating ice, passing under the bridge
He stares down at the water, desperate, trying to make up his mind to act
He leans over looking at the water, fascinated, glances furtively around him, hunches himself as though about to jump
From above George a body hurtles past and lands in the water with a loud splash
George looks down, horrified
(from river) Help
Help
George quickly takes off his coat and dives over the railing into the water
George comes up, sees the man flailing about in the water, and    him as he swims toward the man
Help
Help
Help
The toll house keeper, hearing the cries for help, comes running out on the bridge with a flashlight, which he shines on the two figures struggling in the water below
The man in the water is Clarence, the angel whose voice we have heard speaking from Heaven
George reaches him, grabs hold of him, and starts swimming for shore
: , , George is seated before a wood-burning stove before which his clothes are drying on a line
He is in his long winter underwear
He is sipping a mug of hot coffee, staring at the stove, cold, gloomy and drunk, ignoring Clarence and the tollkeeper, preoccupied by his near suicide and his unsolved problems
Clarence is standing on the other side of the stove, putting on his undershirt
This is a ludicrous seventeenth century garment which looks like a baby's night shirt  with embroidered cuffs and collar, and gathered at the neck with a drawstring
It falls below his knees
The tollkeeper is seated against the wall eyeing them suspiciously
Throughout the scene he attempts to spit, but each time is stopped by some amazing thing Clarence does or says
Clarence becomes aware that his garment is amazing the tollkeeper
didn't have time to get some stylish underwear
My wife gave me this on my last birthday
passed away in it
The tollkeeper, about to spit, is stopped in the middle of it by this remark
Clarence, secretly trying to get George's attention, now picks up a copy of "Tom Sawyer" which is hanging on the line, drying
He shakes the book
Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too
You should read the new book Mark Twain's writing now
The tollkeeper stares at him incredulously
How'd you happen to fall in
didn't fall in
jumped in to save George
George looks up, surprised
You what
To save me
Well,  did, didn't
You didn't go through with it, did you
Go through with what
Suicide
George and the tollkeeper react to this
It's against the law to commit suicide around here
Yeah, it's against the law where come from, too
Where do you come from
He leans forward to spit, but is stopped by Clarence's next statement
Heaven
(to George) had to act quickly; that's why jumped in
knew if  were drowning you'd try to save me
And you see, you did, and that's how  saved you
The tollkeeper becomes increasingly nervous
George casually looks at the strange smiling little man a second time
(offhand) Very funny
Your lip's bleeding, George
George's hand goes to his mouth
Yeah,  got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago
(comes around to George) Oh, no  no  no
'm the answer to your prayer
That's why  was sent down here
(casually interested) How do you know my name
Oh,  know all about you
've watched you grow up from a little boy
What are you, a mind reader or something
Oh, no
Well, who are you, then
Clarence Odbody, --2
Odbody
--2
What's that --2
Angel, Second Class
The tollkeeper's chair slips out from under him with a crash
He has been leaning against the wall on it, tipped back on two legs
Tollkeeper rises and makes his way warily out the door
From his expression he looks like he'll call the nearest cop
(to tollkeeper) Cheerio, my good man
George rubs his head with his hand, to clear his mind
Oh, brother
wonder what Martini put in those drinks
He looks up at Clarence standing beside him
Hey, what's with you
What did you say just a minute ago
Why'd you want to save me
That's what  was sent down for
'm your guardian angel
wouldn't be a bit surprised
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money
Eight thousand dollars
(bewildered) Yeah
just things like that
Now how'd you know that
told you  'm your guardian angel
know everything about you
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel 'd get
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you
What happened to your wings
haven't won my wings yet
That's why 'm an angel Second Class
don't know whether  like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings
Oh, 've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you
(humoring him) Sure, sure
How
By letting me help you
Only one way you can help me
You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you
Oh, no, no
We don't use money in Heaven
Oh, that's right,  keep forgetting
Comes in pretty handy down here, bub
Oh, tut, tut, tut
found it out a little late
'm worth more dead than alive
Now look, you mustn't talk like that
won't get my wings with that attitude
You just don't know all that you've done
If it hadn't been for you
(interrupts) Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody'd be a lot better off
My wife, and my kids and my friends
(annoyed with Clarence) Look, little fellow, go off and haunt somebody else, will you
No, you don't understand
've got my job
(savagely) Aw, shut up, will you
Clarence is not getting far with George
He glances up, paces across the room, thoughtfully
(to himself) Hmmm, this isn't going to be so easy
(to George) So you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier, eh
(dejectedly) Oh,  don't know
guess you're right
suppose it would have been better if 'd never been born at all
What'd you say
said  wish 'd never been born
Oh, you mustn't say things like that
You
(gets an idea) wait a minute
Wait a minute
That's an idea
(glances up toward Heaven) What do you think
Yeah, that'll do it
All right
(to George) You've got your wish
You've never been born
As Clarence speaks this line, the snow stops falling outside the building, a strong wind springs up which blows open the door to the shack
Clarence runs to close the door
(looking upward) You don't have to make all that fuss about it
As Clarence speaks, George cocks his head curiously, favoring his deaf ear, more interested in his hearing than in what Clarence has said
What did you say
You've never been born
You don't exist
You haven't a care in the world
George feels his ear as Clarence talks
No worries  no obligations  no eight thousand dollars to get  no Potter looking for you with the Sheriff
George indicates his bad ear
Say something else in that ear
(bending down) Sure
You can hear out of it
Well, that's the doggonedest thing
haven't heard anything out of that ear since  was a kid
Must have been that jump in the cold water
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George
George feels his lip, which shows no sign of the recent cut he received from Welch
He is now thoroughly confused
What do you know about that
What's happened
George looks around, as though to get his bearings
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it
What's happened here
(standing up) Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry
Our clothes are dry
George feels the clothes on the line
What do you know about that
Stove's hotter than  thought
Now, come on, get your clothes on, and we'll stroll up to my car and get
They start dressing
George interrupts himself
Oh, 'm sorry
'll stroll
You fly
can't fly
haven't got any wings
You haven't got your wings
Yeah, that's right
: This is the same empty street where George's car swerved into the tree near the sidewalk
George and Clarence come into shot and up to the spot where George had left his car smashed against the tree
George looks around, but his car is nowhere to be seen, and the tree is undamaged
What's the matter
(puzzled) Well, this is where  left my car and it isn't here
You have no car
Well,  had a car, and it was right here
guess somebody moved it
The owner of the house passes with some Christmas packages under his arm
(politely) Good evening
Oh, say
Hey
where's my car
beg your pardon
My car, my car
'm the fellow that owns the car that ran into your tree
What tree
What do you mean, what tree
This tree
Here,  ran into it
Cut a big gash in the side of it here
The owner bends down to examine the trunk of the tree, then straightens up and smells George's breath
He backs away
You must mean two other trees
You had me worried
One of the oldest trees in Pottersville
(blankly) Pottersville
Why, you mean Bedford Falls
mean Pottersville
(sharply) Don't you think  know where  live
What's the matter with you
The owner proceeds toward his house
George is completely bewildered
Oh,  don't know
Either 'm off my nut, or he is
(to Clarence) or you are
It isn't me
Well, maybe  left the car up at Martini's
Well, come on, Gabriel
He puts his arm around Clarence, and they start off up the road
(as they go) Clarence
Clarence
Clarence
: ' It is Martini's place, but almost unrecognizable
The cheerful Italian feeling is gone
It is now more of a hard-drinking joint, a honky-tonk
Same bar, tables have no covers
People are lower down and tougher
Nick the bartender is behind the bar
George and Clarence come in
George does not notice the difference, but Clarence is all eyes and beaming
They go up to the bar
(as they come in) That's all right
Go on in
Martini's a good friend of mine
Two people leave the bar as they approach
There's a place to sit down
Sit down
Nick is wiping off the bar as they sit down
Oh, hello, Nick
Hey, where's Martini
You want a martini
No, no, Martini
Your boss
Where is he
(impatient) Look, 'm the boss
You want a drink or don't you
Okay  all right
Double bourbon, quick, huh
Okay
(to Clarence) What's yours
was just thinking
(face puckers up with delicious anticipation) It's been so long since
(impatient) Look, mister, 'm standing here waiting for you to make up your mind
(appreciatively) That's a good man
was just thinking of a flaming rum punch
No, it's not cold enough for that
Not nearly cold enough
Wait a minute
wait a minute
got it
Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light on the cloves
Off with you, me lad, and be lively
Hey, look mister, we serve hard drinks in here for men who want to get drunk fast
And we don't need any characters around to give the joint atmosphere
Is that clear
Or do have to slip you my left for a convincer
As he says this, Nick leans over the counter and puts his left fist nearly in Clarence's eye
Clarence is puzzled by this conduct
(to George) What's he talking about
(soothingly) Nick  Nick, just give him the same as mine
He's okay
Okay
Nick turns away to get the drinks
What's the matter with him
never saw Nick act like that before
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on
Oh, yeah
Hey, little fellow  you worry me
You got someplace to sleep
No
You don't huh
Well, you got any money
Nick is listening suspiciously to this conversation
No
No wonder you jumped in the river
jumped in the river to save you so could get my wings
Nick stops pouring the drinks, bottle poised in his hand
Oh, that's right
cash register bell rings off stage
Clarence reacts to the of the bell
Oh-oh
Somebody's just made it
Made what
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings
George glances up at Nick
Look,  think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here
Why
Don't they believe in angels
(looking at Nick) Yeah, but
you know
Then why should they be surprised when they see one
(to Nick) He never grew up
He's
(to Clarence) How old are you, anyway, Clarence
Two hundred and ninety-three
(thinks) next May
Nick slams the bottle down on the counter
That does it
Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window
Look, Nick
What's wrong
(angrily) And that's another thing
Where do you come off calling me Nick
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it
What's that got to do with it don't know you from Adam's off ox
(sees someone come in) Hey, you
Rummy
Come here
Come here
small wreck of a man, with weak, watery eyes
Obviously a broken-down panhandler, his hat in his hand
He can hardly believe his eyes
It is Gower the druggist
(to Gower) Didn't  tell you never to come panhandling around here
Nick picks up a seltzer bottle, and squirts Gower in the face with it
The crowd laugh brutally
Gower smiles weakly as the soda runs off his face
George, horrified, leaps up and goes over to Gower
Mr
Gower
Mr
Gower
This is George Bailey
Don't you know me
No
No
(to his bouncers) Throw him out
Throw him out
The bouncers throw Gower out the front door
George rushes back to the bar
(bewildered) Hey, what is
Hey, Nick, Nick
Isn't that Mr
Gower, the druggist
You know, that's another reason for me not to like you
That rumhead spent twenty years in jail for poisoning a kid
If you know him, you must be a jailbird yourself
(to his bouncers) Would you show these gentlemen to the door
Sure
This way, gentlemen
' George and Clarence come flying through the door and land in the snow
' Nick at the cash register, busily ringing the bell
Hey
Get me
'm giving out wings
' George and Clarence lying in the snow
George has a strange, puzzled look on his face
They remain for a moment as they landed, looking at each other
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the
What do you mean,  wasn't there remember distinctly
George catches a glimpse of the front of the building with the neon sign over the door
It now reads "' " instead of "'
" George and Clarence get to their feet
(exasperated) What the
hey, what's going on around here
Why, this ought to be Martini's place
He points to the sign, and looks at Clarence
Clarence sort of hangs his head
George fixes him with a very interested look
Look, who are you
(patiently) told you, George
'm your guardian angel
George, still looking at him, goes up to him and pokes his arm
It's flesh
Yeah, yeah,  know
You told me that
What else are you
What
are you a hypnotist
No, of course not
Well then, why am  seeing all these strange things
Don't you understand, George
It's because you were not born
Then if  wasn't born, who am
You're nobody
You have no identity
George rapidly searches his pockets for identification, but without success
What do you mean, no identity
My name's George Bailey
There is no George Bailey
You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4- card, no insurance policy
(he says these things as George searches for them) George looks in his watch pocket
They're not there, either
What
Zuzu's petals
George feverishly continues to turn his pockets inside out
You've been given a great gift, George
chance to see what the world would be like without you
George is completely befuddled
(shaking his head) Now wait a minute, here
Wait a minute here
As, this is some sort of a funny dream 'm having here
So long, mister, 'm going home
He starts off
Clarence rises
Home
What home
(furious) Now shut up
Cut it out
You're
you're
you're crazy
That's what think
you're screwy, and you're driving me crazy, too
'm seeing things
'm going home and see my wife and family
Do you understand that
And 'm going home alone
George strides off hurriedly
Clarence slowly follows him, glancing up toward Heaven as he goes
How'm  doing, Joseph
Thanks
(pause) No,  didn't have a drink
: The sign bearing the name of the town reads: "Pottersville
" George looks at it in surprise, then starts up the street toward the main part of town
As he goes, him
The character of the place has completely changed
Where before it was a quiet, orderly small town, it has now become in nature like a frontier village
We see a of night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, pool halls and the like, with blaring jazz  issuing from the majority of them
The motion picture theatre has become a burlesque house
Gower's drugstore is now a pawnbroker's establishment, and so on
George stops before what used to be the offices of the Building and Loan
There is a garish electric sign over the entrance reading: "Welcome Jitterbugs
"  crowd of people are watching the police, who are raiding the place, and dragging out a number of screaming women, whom they throw into a patrol wagon
George talks to one of the cops: Hey
hey
Where did the Building and Loan move to
The Building and what
The Bailey Building and Loan
It was up there
They went out of business years ago
George sees the struggling figure of Violet Bick, arrayed as a tart, being dragged into the patrol wagon
Hey, Violet
(to the cop) Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick
know
know
know that girl
The cop shoves George to one side
He looks around and sees Ernie's taxi cruising slowly by
Hey, Ernie  Ernie
Ernie stops the cab, and George enters it
Ernie, take me home
'm off my nut
(a much harder Ernie) Where do you live
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff
You know where  live
Three-twenty Sycamore
Now hurry up
Okay
Three-twenty Sycamore
Yeah  yeah  hurry up
Zuzu's sick
All right
He pulls down the flag on the meter and starts the cab
Ernie is puzzled by the stranger
Look here, Ernie, straighten me out here
've got some bad liquor or something
Listen to me now
Now, you are Ernie Bishop, and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kid
That's right, isn't it
(suspiciously) You seen my wife
(exasperated) Seen your wife
've been to your house a hundred times
Look, bud, what's the idea
live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid
And  ain't never seen you before in my life
Okay
Just step on it
Just get me home
Ernie turns to driving, but he's worried about his passenger
As he passes the burlesque house he sees Bert the cop standing beside his police car
Attracting his attention, he motions to Bert to follow him, indicating he has a nut in the back
Bert gets into his car and follows
: ' The taxi pulls up to the curb and stops
The cab is parked
George gets out and looks at the house
Is this the place
Of course it's the place
Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years
George is stopped momentarily by the appearance of the house
Windows are broken, the porch sags, one section of the roof has fallen, doors and shutters hang askew on their hinges
Like a doomed man, George approaches the house
The police car has pulled up beside the cab, and Bert and Ernie stand watching George's actions
What's up, Ernie
don't know, but we better keep an eye on this guy
He's bats
Ernie switches on the spotlight on his cab, and turns the beam toward the old house
' The interior of the house is lit up here and there, ghostlike, by Ernie's spotlight
No furniture, cobwebs, wallpaper hanging and swinging  stairs are broken and collapsed
In a voice that sounds like a cry for help, George yells out: Mary
Mary
Tommy
Pete
Janie
Zuzu
Where are you
Clarence suddenly appears leaning against a wall
They're not here, George
You have no children
(ignoring him) Where are you
(then, to Clarence) What have you done with them
Bert is standing in the entrance, with his gun in his hand
Ernie is a few feet behind him, ready to run
All right, put up your hands
No fast moves
Come on out here, both of you
Bert
Thank heaven you're here
He rushes toward Bert
Stand back
Bert, what's happened to this house
Where's Mary
Where's my kids
(warningly) Watch him, Bert
Come on, come on
(bewildered) Bert  Ernie
What's the matter with you two guys
You were here on my wedding night
You, both of you, stood out here on the porch and sung to us, don't you remember
(nervously) Think 'd better be going
Look, now why don't you be a good kid and we'll take you in to a doctor
Everything's going to be all right
Bert tries to lead George away by the arm, but George struggles with him, trying to explain
Bert, now listen to me
Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house
Bert, listen
(gesturing to Clarence) It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me
hate to do this, fella
Bert raises his gun to hit George on the head
As he does so, Clarence darts in and fixes his teeth in Bert's wrist, forcing him to let George go
Run
George
Run, George
George dashes out of the house and down the street, as Bert grapples with Clarence, and they fall to the ground, wrestling
We see Bert kneeling, trying to put handcuffs on Clarence
Help
Joseph, help
Oh, shut up
Help, oh Joseph, help
Joseph
Suddenly Clarence disappears from under Bert's hands
Bert gets up, amazed by his vanishing
Where'd he go
Where'd he go
had him right here
Ernie's hair is now standing on end with fright
(stammering) need a drink
He runs out of the scene
Well, which way'd they go
Help me find 'em
George runs up the path to the front door of the house and raps on the door
He rings the bell and taps on the glass, when his attention is caught by a sign on the wall reading: "Ma Bailey's Boarding House
" The door opens and a woman appears
It is Mrs
Bailey, but she has changed amazingly
Her face is harsh and tired
In her eyes, once kindly and understanding, there is now cold suspicion
She gives no sign that she knows him
Well
Mother
Mother
What do you want
It is a cruel blow to George
Mother, this is George
thought sure you'd remember me
(coldly) George who
If you're looking for a room there's no vacancy
She starts to close the door, but George stops her
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me
Something terrible's happened to me
don't know what it is
Something's happened to everybody
Please let me come in
Keep me here until  get over it
Get over what
don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody  know
(desperate) Well,  know everybody you know
Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy
(suspiciously) You know him
Well, sure  do
When'd you see him last
Today, over at the house
That's a lie
He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business
And if you ask me, that's where you belong
She slams the door shut in George's face
George stands a moment, stunned
Then he turns and runs out to the sidewalk, until his face fills the screen
His features are distorted by the emotional chaos within him
We see Clarence leaning on the mail box at the curb, holding his volume of "Tom Sawyer" in his hand
Strange, isn't it
Each man's life touches so many other lives, and when he isn't around he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he
(quietly, trying to use logic) 've heard of things like this
You've got me in some kind of a spell, or something
Well, 'm going to get out of it
'll get out of it know how, too
the last man talked to before all this stuff started happening to me was Martini
You know where he lives
Sure  know where he lives
He lives in Bailey Park
They walk out of scene
: George and Clarence approach the tree from which the "Bailey Park" sign once hung
Now it is just outside a cemetery, with graves where the houses used to be
Are you sure this is Bailey Park
Oh, 'm not sure of anything anymore
All  know is this should be Bailey Park
But where are the houses
The two walk into the cemetery
(as they go) You weren't here to build them
George wandering like a lost soul among the tombstones, Clarence trotting at his heels
Again George stops to stare with frightened eyes at: Upon it is engraved a name, Harry Bailey
Feverishly George scrapes away the snow covering the rest of the inscription, and we read: " 1911-1919" Your brother, Harry Bailey, broke through the ice and was drowned at the age of nine
George jumps up
That's a lie
Harry Bailey went to war
He got the Congressional Medal of Honor
He saved the lives of every man on that transport
(sadly) Every man on that transport died
Harry wasn't there to save them because you weren't there to save Harry
You see, George, you really had a wonderful life
Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away
Clarence
Yes, George
Where's Mary
Oh, well,  can't
don't know how you know these things, but tell me  where is she
George grabs Clarence by the coat collar and shakes him
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is
'm not supposed to tell
(becoming violent) Please, Clarence, tell me where she is
You're not going to like it, George
(shouting) Where is she
She's an old maid
She never married
(choking him) Where's Mary
Where is she
She's
Where is she
(in self-defense) She's just about to close up the library
George lets Clarence go, and runs off
Clarence falls to the ground, where he rubs his neck
(to himself) There must be some easier way for me to get my wings
: Mary comes out the door, then turns and locks it
We see George watching her from the sidewalk
Mary is very different no buoyancy in her walk, none of Mary's abandon and love of life
Glasses, no make-up, lips compressed, elbows close to body
She looks flat and dried up, and extremely self- satisfied and efficient
George, as he watches her
George and Mary, on the sidewalk
Mary
She looks up, surprised, but, not recognizing him, continues on
Mary
Mary starts to run away from him, and he follows, desperately
Mary
Mary
He catches up to her, grabs her by the arms, and keeps a tight grip on her
She struggles to free herself
Mary, it's George
Don't you know me
What's happened to us
(struggling) don't know you
Let me go
Mary, please
Oh, don't do this to me
Please, Mary, help me
Where's our kids
need you, Mary
Help me, Mary
Mary breaks away from him, and dashes into the first door she comes to, the Blue Moon Bar
Small tables, booths, perhaps a counter
It is crowded
Many of the people are the same who were present during the run on the Building and Loan
Mary comes running in, screaming
The place goes into an uproar
George comes in, practically insane
Some of the men grab and hold on to him
(shouting) Mary
(to men holding him) Let me go
Mary, don't run away
Somebody call the police
Hit him with a bottle
He needs a strait jacket
(from back of room) That man  stop him
(recognizing some of them) Tom
Ed
Charlie
That's my wife
Mary lets out a final scream, then faints into the arms of a couple of women at the bar
Mary
Oh, no you don't
(screaming) Mary
George can't fight through the men holding him
Desperately he thinks of Clarence, and heads for the door
Clarence
Clarence
Where are you
Just as George breaks through the door, Bert arrives in his police car
He gets out and heads for the door, to run into George as he comes out
Oh, it's you
He grabs for George, who lets him have one square on the button, knocking him down, then continues running down the street yelling for Clarence
Bert gets up, takes out his gun and fires several shots after the fleeing figure
(to crowd) Stand back
Bert gets into the police car, and, siren screaming, sets off in pursuit of George
: The same part of the bridge where George was standing before Clarence jumped in
The wind is blowing as it has all through this sequence
George comes running into shot
He is frantically looking for Clarence
Clarence
Clarence
Help me, Clarence
Get me back
Get me back
don't care what happens to me
Only get me back to my wife and kids
Help me, Clarence, please
Please
want to live again
George leaning on the bridge railing, praying
want to live again
want to live again
Please, God, let me live again
George sobs
Suddenly, toward the end of the above, the wind dies down
soft, gentle snow begins to fall
The police car pulls up on the roadway behind him, and Bert comes into scene
Hey, George
George
You all right
George backs away and gets set to hit Bert again
Hey, what's the matter
(warningly) Now get out of here, Bert, or 'll hit you again
Get out
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George
Don't
George
George talks hopefully  George touches Bert unbelievingly George's mouth is bleeding again
Bert, do you know me
Know you
Are you kiddin'
've been looking all over town trying to find you
saw your car piled into that tree down there, and  thought maybe
Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right
What did
George touches his lips with his tongue, wipes his mouth with his hand, laughs happily
His rapture knows no bounds
(joyously) My mouth's bleeding, Bert
My mouth's bleed
(feeling in watch pocket) Zuzu's petals
Zuzu's
they're
they're here, Bert
What do you know about that
Merry Christmas
He practically embraces the astonished Bert, then runs at top speed toward town
George runs away from camera yelling Mary
Mary
: George's wrecked car is smashed against the tree
He comes running into shot, sees the car, lets out a triumphant yell, pats the car, and dashes on
George sees that the "" sign is now replaced by the original "     " sign
Hello, Bedford Falls
He turns and runs through the falling snow up the main street of the town
As he runs, he notices that the town is back in its original appearance
He passes some late shoppers on the street Merry Christmas
(ad lib) Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, George
: Merry Christmas, movie house
: Merry Christmas, emporium
: Merry Christmas, you wonderful old Building and Loan
George notices a light in Potter's office window, and races across the street
' Potter is seated working at his desk, his goon by his side
George pounds on the window
(from outside) Merry Christmas, Mr
Potter
George runs off as Potter looks up from his work
Happy New Year to you  in jail
Go on home  they're waiting for you
' The lights are on
There is a fire in the fireplace
The Christmas tree is fully decorated with presents stacked around
Carter, the bank examiner, a newspaper reporter and photographer, and a sheriff, are waiting in the hall for George
George comes dashing in the front door
(excitedly) Mary
(sees the men) Well, hello, Mr
Bank Examiner
He grabs his hand and shakes it
(surprised) Mr
Bailey, there's a deficit

Eight thousand dollars
(reaching into pocket) George, 've got a little paper here
(happily) 'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest
Isn't it wonderful
Merry Christmas
The photographer sets off a flash bulb
Reporters

(calling) Mary
George runs to the kitchen
He gets no answer
As he goes: Oh, look at this wonderful old drafty house
Mary
Mary
He comes running back to the hall
Have you seen my wife
' Merry Christmas, Daddy
Merry Christmas, Daddy
The three children are at the top of the stairs
They are in their pajamas
Kids
George starts to run up the stairs, and the old familiar knob on the banister comes off in his hand
He kisses it lovingly and puts it back, then continues up the stairs
Pete  kids  Janie  Tommy
(takes them in his arms) could eat you up
George and the kids
He is hugging them
Where's your mother
She went looking for you with Uncle Billy
Zuzu comes running out of her bedroom
George crushes her to him
Daddy
Zuzu  Zuzu

(laughing) Not a smitch of temp
As Mary comes through the door, breathless and excited
The four men are watching with open mouths
' Hallelujah
(to the men) Hello
(sees George) George
Darling
Mary races up the stairs, where George meets her in a fierce embrace
Mary
Mary
George, darling
Where have you been
George and Mary embrace tearfully
Oh, George, George, George
Mary
Let me touch you
Oh, you're real
Oh, George, George
You have no idea what's happened to me
You have no idea what happened
He stops her with a kiss
She leads him excitedly down the stairs
Well, come on, George, come on downstairs quick
They're on their way
All right
Mary leads George, who is carrying a couple of the kids on his back, to a position in front of the Christmas tree
Come on in here now
Now, you stand right over here, by the tree
Right there, and don't move, don't move hear 'em now, George, it's a miracle
It's a miracle
She runs toward front door and flings it open
Ad lib of an excited crowd can be heard
Uncle Billy, face flushed, covered with snow, and carrying a clothes basket filled with money, bursts in
He is followed by Ernie, and about twenty more townspeople
Come in, Uncle Billy
Everybody
In here
Uncle Billy Mary and the crowd come into the living room table stands in front of George
George picks up Zuzu to protect her from the mob
Uncle Billy dumps the basketful of money out onto the table  the money overflows and falls all over
Isn't it wonderful
The rest of the crowd all greet George with greetings and smiles
Each one comes forward with money
In their pockets, in shoe boxes, in coffee pots
Money pours onto the table pennies, dimes, quarters, dollar bills  small money, but lots of it
Mrs
Bailey and Mrs
Hatch push toward George
More people come in
The place becomes a bedlam
Shouts of "Gangway  gangway" as a new bunch comes in and pours out its money
Mary stands next to George, watching him
George stands there overcome and speechless as he holds Zuzu
As he sees the familiar faces, he gives them sick grins
Tears course down his face
His lips frame their names as he greets them
(emotionally at the breaking point) Mary did it, George
Mary did it
She told a few people you were in trouble and they scattered all over town collecting money
They didn't ask any questions  just said: "If George is in trouble  count on me
" You never saw anything like it
Tom comes in, digging in his purse as he comes
What is this, George
Another run on the bank
Charlie adds his money to the pile
Here you are, George
Merry Christmas
Ernie is trying to get some system into the chaos
The line forms on the right
Mr
Martini comes in bearing a mixing bowl overflowing with cash
Mr
Martini
Merry Christmas
Step right up here
Martini dumps his money on the table
busted the juke-box, too
Mr
Gower enters with a large glass jar jammed full of notes
Mr
Gower
(to George) made the rounds of my charge accounts
Violet Bick arrives, and takes out the money George had given her for her trip to New York
Violet Bick
'm not going to go, George
changed my mind
Annie, the colored maid, enters, digging money out of a long black stocking
've been saving this money for a divorce, if ever  get a husband
Mr
Partridge, the high school principal, is the next donor
There you are, George

(hands his watch to Zuzu) And here's something for you to play with
(giving money) wouldn't have a roof over my head if it wasn't for you, George
Ernie is reading a telegram he has just received
Just a minute

Heehaw and Merry Christmas
Sam Wainwright
The crowd breaks into a cheer as Ernie drops the telegram on top of the pile of money on the table
(calling out) Mr
Martini
How about some wine
As various members of the family bring out a punch bowl and glasses, Janie sits down at the piano and strikes a chord
She starts playing "Hark
The Herald Angels Sing," and the entire crowd joins in the singing
We see a of the various groups singing the hymn, and some people are still coming in and dropping their money on the table
Carter, the bank examiner, makes a donation; the sheriff sheepishly looks at George and tears his warrant in small pieces
In the midst of this scene, Harry, in Naval uniform, enters, accompanied by Bert, the cop
Hello, George, how are you
Harry
Harry
(as he sees the money) Mary  looks like  got here too late
Mary,  got him here from the airport as quickly as  could
The fool flew all the way up here in a blizzard
Mrs

Harry, how about your banquet in New York
Oh,  left right in the middle of it as soon as  got Mary's telegram
Ernie hands Harry a glass of wine
Good idea, Ernie
toast
to my big brother, George
The richest man in town
Once more the crowd breaks into cheering and applause
Janie at the piano and Bert on his accordion start playing "Auld Lang syne," and everyone joins in
George, still holding Zuzu in his arms, glances down at the pile of money on the table
His eye catches something on top of the pile, and he reaches down for it
It is Clarence's copy of "Tom Sawyer
" George opens it and finds an inscription written in it: "Dear George, remember no man is a failure who has friends
Thanks for the wings, Love Clarence
" (looking at book) What's that
That's a Christmas present from a very dear friend of mine
At this moment, perhaps because of the jostling of some of the people on the other side of the tree, a little silver bell on the Christmas tree swings to and fro with a silvery tinkle
Zuzu closes the cover of the book, and points to the bell
Look, Daddy
Teacher says, every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings
(smiling) That's right, that's right
He looks up toward the ceiling and winks
Attaboy, Clarence
