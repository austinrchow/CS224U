' There's a moment of orderly silence before a football play begins
Players are in position, linemen are frozen, and anything's possible
Then, like a traffic accident, stuff begins to randomly collide
From the snap of the ball to the snap of the first bone is closer to four seconds than five

/  -  2 We're watching footage of the 1985 Redskins/Giants Monday Night Football game
Lots of angles, faces, knuckles as the two teams line up, Redskins on offense, for the snap of the ball
As the play begins -- ' One Mississippi
Joe Theismann, the Redskins quarterback, takes the snap and hands off to his running back
hands off to  , who takes two steps forward, then turns and tosses the ball back'to Theismann
The footage    like a coach breaking down film
'  (') Two Mississippi
It's a trick play, a flea flicker, and the running back tosses the ball back to the quarterback
, the Giants linebacker sees that Theismann has the ball back and races toward him
Theismann steps up and to the side and Carson flies past

Up to now the play's been defined by what the quarterback sees
It's about to be defined by what he doesn't

at Taylor's ankles, and misses
Taylor leaps, arms raised, filling the sky behind Theismann

Lawrence Taylor is the best defensive player in the and has been from the time he stepped onto the field as a rookie
The frozen image of Taylor comes to life as he jackknifes Theismann's body

And suggest if your stomach is weak you just don't watch
' Joe Theissman never played another down of football

The camera finds  , Seattle's quarterback
'  (') And you'd be right
What you probably don't know is that more often than not the second highest paid player is, thanks to Lawrence Taylor, a left tackle
The camera goes to  , Seattle's left tackle
() 3 : 3 '  (') Because, as every housewife knows, the first check you write is for the mortgage and the second is for the insurance
The left tackle's job is to protect the quarterback from what he can't see coming
To protect his blind side

Then we   of their hands, feet, waists, etc
, corresponding with --- ' The ideal left tackle is big, but a lot of people are big
He is wide in the butt and massive in the thighs
He has long arms, giant hands and feet as quick as a hiccup

Lots of folks out, milling about, but our focus is on   in the distance, moving in - while everyone else is at normal speed
He's extremely large, six and a half feet, but he carefully steps instead of strutting
His name is

For on that day he not only altered Joe Theismann's life, but mine as well

Not much more than a desk on either side of which sit  , an African- American woman in a business suit, and Michael Oher
Michael slumps a bit, eyes the ground and rubs his hands on his knees - a nervous trait of his
Do you find it odd
Your predicament
( ) Michael
Iono [ don't know]
Investigator Granger sifts through her briefcase, pulls out files, documents - a good bit of evidence for whatever trouble Michael is in
She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him out
Michael can't meet her gaze

- '  -  12 , football coach, cleans off his desk, ready to leave for the day
Big Tony knocks at the door
They say you the coach
Cotton eyes Tony, offers a hand
Bert Cotton
Tony Hamilton, but everybody call me Big Tony
What can  do for you, Tony
13
-   -  13 Steven and Michael eye the freshly painted buildings, the flowers, the new playground jungle gyms and outdoor hoops
() 13 : 13 Sure is pretty, huh, Big Mike
Mike doesn't answer, just takes it all in
Steven sees and opens a container filled to the brim with balls - footballs, basketballs, four square balls
(') Not even locked
White people are crazy
14
- '  -  14 Big Tony and Cotton are mid-discussion --- You see  promised my mama Boo, on her deathbed, that  would get Steven outta public and into a church school
appreciate that but 'm not involved with admissions
figured 'd come to you; seeing as you might need some players
What sport does he play
Anything with a ball
Good, too
He has Cotton's attention for a moment, then it passes
Classes start in a week
It'd have to be for next semester
know what you're thinking, Coach, but  got money
'm a mechanic at Wilson's Auto t'other side of town
( ) What if someone drops out or moves
Could they get in then
() 14 : 14 "They
" You only mentioned one son
Steven, yessir, but  brought another boy along
Another boy
Yeah, Big Mike
He stays on our couch sometimes
It's a bad deal
His mama's on the crack pipe and he ain't got nobody
He just wanted to come along with us today
Would
Big Mike be an applicant as well
Yeah, sure, why not
Cotton sighs, considers what to do
They'd have to fill out applications and make an appointment for interviews
was hopin' you might just interview 'em now
They're here
Big Tony points out the
window to the playground where Steven and Michael are playing one on one basketball
The little ones Steven and the big ' -- Big Mike
Yeah
That's right
: 15
-  -  15 For a boy his size Michael can really move
He dribbles, fakes left, then falls away, making a long three pointer
Cotton's eyes get a little wider as he watches -- Michael dribbles the ball between his legs, behind his back and jumps high, slamming the ball through the hoop
Big men aren't supposed to move like this
Cotton's lips are almost quivering -- Mother of God
16
-  16 The Board of Admissions, eight or so men and women, are seated around a large conference table
By himself, at one end, sits Bert Cotton
Are there spots available or not
, Principal, taps his fingers before
Technically, yes, in both grades
But we have a greater responsibility than just filling classrooms
Steven Hamilton's paperwork looks acceptable and believe he would be capable of succeeding here but the other kid -- Sandstrom looks through papers for the name
Big Mike
Michael Oher gives us no reason to believe, based on his record, that he would be successful here
How bad could it be
Another board member,
, pores over Michael's file, which is a mess
She finds facts and lays them out --- () 16 : 16 We're not sure exactly how old he is due to lack of records
He has a measured  of 80
That's 6th percentile
He's been enrolled in seven different institutions, including a gap of eighteen months around the age of ten when he apparently didn't attend school at all
He repeated first grade as well as second, there's no record of attendance in third, and in fourth grade -- So they moved him ahead without going to third grade
That says something
( ) His attendance records are abysmal and his grade point average begins with a zero
Zero-point-six- Silence around the room
, a board member and science teacher, looks to the others
Everyone passed him along - gave him 's so they could hand their problem off to the next school
Brave kid
(off their confusion) For wanting to come here
For wanting a quality education
An education denied him by the poor quality of the schools he's attended
Most kids with his background wouldn't come within two hundred miles of this place
Coach Cotton, we understand your interest in the young man's athletic abilities
He wouldn't be able to play until he got his grades up anyway
() The Blind Side - Green Revision - 04/28/09 10 16 : 16 Forget sports
Look at the wall
He points to the crest on the wall
Beneath it: ", , "

We either take that seriously or we paint over it
You don't admit Michael Oher for sports, you admit him because it's the right thing to do
Their faces announce that he's made a point
17
-  17 First day of class
Students, mostly blonde-haired and blue- eyed, wearing crisply laundered Abercrombie and Fitch, carry their backpacks through the school's arch and converse with friends they haven't seen over the summer
Michael
Fills it up in fact
He stares at the arch
Beneath the school name we read "
,      "
Michael takes a deep breath and enters
He carries his "school bag" - a plastic grocery sack
18
-  -  18 Just as before, Michael moves at    than those around him
Makes sense because he is different
Not only the color of his skin but his size, his clothes (short pants and -shirt), his eyes taking in the pavement - all point to the fact that he doesn't belong here
Small children from kindergarten and first grade give him a wide, cautious berth
He's noticed and ogled by everyone
19

'  -  19 It's Mrs
Boswell's biology class and she's writing on the board in front of a full classroom when Michael enters
He pauses and all eyes go to him
Mrs
Boswell does her best to stifle a gasp as she first lays eyes on him
Then
Class, this is Mike Oher and he's new here so  expect you all to make him feel welcome
(with a warm smile) Mike, take any empty seat
() 11 19 : 19 She urges him with a nod
Michael walks back and sits in the corner, looking terrified
He barely fits in the seat
Mrs
Boswell hands out a stack of papers to each row
As students pass them back to others
(') This is a quiz based on the information you learned last year in your science curriculum
( ) Don't worry
It won't be graded just want to see how much of the information we need to hit again
Just answer whatever you know
The student in front of Michael hands a sheet back to him and eyes the size of his feet
The students start to work while Michael stares at the sheet like it's written in Greek
Mrs
Boswell watches him for a few seconds before turning back to her work

Boswell collects the last of the papers
She walks over to Michael, looks down at his sheet
Nothing filled in, just his name scrawled at the top
She tries to decide how to deal with this then opts for -- It's okay
Can  leave now
She nods and watches him stand and walk away
She glances down at the sheet, turns it over and sees
on the back - a boat on an ocean
On the boat is a single, stick figure person
It's sweet but looks like a third grader drew it

'  -  22 Michael lies on a tattered sofa
The lights are out but Michael's eyes are open, staring at the light emanating from beneath a closed bedroom door
We hear voices

Hey, Big Mike, um

During a time out, Sean eyes the crowd, sees something odd
In the upper corner of the gym sits Michael, by himself, rubbing his knees
Others around him, all white, have moved away
He's a very large island in the lily white gym

What kid
Black kid
Up in the corner

Leigh Anne, loaded up with refreshments, makes her way up the stands to her family
She has a nod, a smile, a bon mot, for everyone she passes
As she sits
What'd  miss
Collins got a dig
It's girl's volleyball, Mom
You didn't miss anything
Leigh Anne gives him a look then stands and shouts -- Collins
Move your feet

Collins, we'll wait outside
And don't double condition in the shower - you still have homework

Can  go
to the Johnson's for dinner
They invited me
What's so awful about our house
Sean smiles, shakes his head as  and Collins leave
() 15 26 : 26 Sean's eyes go to the upper stands where he sees Michael, alone, walking slowly, then bending down, picking something up, taking a few more steps and repeating the process
Picking up left-over bags of popcorn
Sean considers this for a second before leaving

Mrs
Boswell can't contain herself
He writes
His name

Mrs
Boswell goes to'her purse, pulls out a crumpled page
He threw this in the trash can

They are looking at Michael, who sits by himself without a tray in front of him
If he makes his grades he'll be eligible in the spring
If he makes his grades
But boy-hidey, just look at him
Cotton is admiring Michael's size but Sean sees something else
He stands, walks over to Michael, who barely looks up
What did you eat for lunch today
Here in the cafeteria
didn't ask where you ate,  asked what you ate
few things
Do you need some money
For lunch
() 17 28 : 28 don't need any
Sean walks back over to Coach Cotton
Buy him a semester lunch pass and put it on my bill
(off Cotton's look) He's hungry
You could tell that by looking at him
- didn't grow up all that different from him
At public school they give you free lunch, Bert
And when food is finite, you'd be surprised how much time you can spend thinking about it

Boswell distributes a test to the class

Boswell points and he sits
You can take the test back here away from everybody else

He rubs his hands on his knees and stares
Mrs
Boswell waits a beat then scoots her chair over next to him
(') Mike, how about  ask the questions and you tell me the answers or as much as you know
She looks at his hands - huge next to hers - then reads: (') Protozoans are classified based on: a) how they get their food, b) how they reproduce, c) how they move, or d) both a and c
Michael just stares
After a long moment Iono
Just try
Ask questions if you don't understand
But still Michael stares at the page
The look on her face says she's about to give up when He lifts his eyes to her and points to -- -- the question on the test - specifically to the word "classified"
(') "Classified"
It means how things are grouped together
Like our "class"
Exactly
This science course is classified based on what grade y'all are in

She holds up the test -- marked with a large red ""
On how big a curve
He's been listening the whole time
It's amazing what he's absorbed
And, trust me, he's listening to you, too
Okay, so his reading level is low and he has no idea how to learn in a classroom, but

She hears a   in the neighborhood and moves to the window to look out

-  55 Michael, plastic sack in hand, walks away
Leigh Anne exits the front door, spots Michael and tries to catch up
Big Mike
() The Blind Side - Yellow Draft -- 04/15/09 29 55 : 55 He stops, turns
Leigh Anne walks over
(') Where are you going
Iono
Are you spending Thanksgiving with your family
Michael shakes his head
56
-  --  () 56 Leigh
Anne carves turkey onto a tray and takes it into
57
-   --  57 Leigh Anne sets the turkey on a serving table alongside the rest of the Tuohy Thanksgiving feast
Come and get it
Sean sits at the ,"watching an Ole Miss football game, while  plays
video games on another
Collins chats on her cell
Michael sits off to the side, taking it all in
, Ole Miss is about to score
Which means they're about to fumble
They all shuffle over, grab plates, start piling on food
Sean loads his plate and heads back to the couch
Looks great, hon
Collins plate is pretty delicately apportioned
see a lot of starch
jams turkey into a roll and lathers on cranberry sauce - creating an easy to eat sandwich
He walks away
() 30 57 : 57 Michael stares - he's never seen so much food
Leigh Anne hands him a plate
He gingerly puts a slice of
turkey on it
As much as you want
( ) Oh, the potato salad
With no one watching him, Michael shoves two rolls into his pants pocket and finishes filling his plate
Leigh Anne reenters to see Michael sitting at the dining room table, alone, not touching his plate
Her eyes go to the rest of her family, shoving down food and playing games
She makes a decision, grabs the remote and turns off the TVs
58
-   -  58 The entire family sits at the table
Rockwell would be proud
Why are we eating in here
Leigh Anne holds out her hands
Shall we say grace
The Tuohy family plus Michael hold hands
Collins stares at her tiny hand intertwined with Michael's
As Leigh Anne prays Michael tries to emulate behavior without closing his eyes, taking it all in
(') Heavenly Father
We thank you for all your many blessings on this family
We thank you for bringing us a new friend
And we ask that you look after
us in this holiday season and never let us forget just how very fortunate we are
Amen
chorus of Amens and they all dig in
Michael is unsure at first how to correctly use the silverware
He picks up the fork and Leigh Anne nods, "that's right"
She eyes Michael's stained shirt
() 31 58 : 58 (') Big Mike, do you like to shop
(off his look) Because tomorrow  think 'm gonna have to show you how it's done
59
'  --  59 Leigh Anne drives and Michael sits shotgun
qot clothes
You "have" clothes
And an extra - shirt in a plastic bag does not a wardrobe make
He looks out the window
(') Okay, fine, let's go get 'em
Just tell me where 'm going
No answer
Frustrated, she pulls the car over to the curb and puts it in park
(') Tell me everything  need to know about you
He still stares out the window
(') Who takes care of you
( ) mother
Do you have a mother
( ) grandmother maybe
Nothing
Leigh Anne turns off the car
(') Look, Big Mike, we can do this the easy way - or we can do it the hard way
Take your pick
He eyes the floor
(') Fine
Tell me one thing  should know about you
One thing
() 32 59 : 59 After a beat
don't like to be called Big Mike
She wasn't expecting this, nods her head
Okay
Mike or Michael
(off his shrug) Tell you what, from now on, to me, 'you're Michael
So,
Michael, where we headed
60
-  60 An expansive beehive of rotting housing
It's the place we saw when we first laid eyes on Michael and nothing's changed
Leigh Anne's car stops at one of the complexes
This is where your mother lives
He nods and she opens her door
(') Okay, let's go
He forcefully reaches across her and closes the door, catching her off guard
Don't get out
Who's going to help you with your clothes
() Don't get out of the car
Michael gets out on his side and takes care to push the lock before he closes the door
She watches as he walks toward the structure, then notices several of the local ne'er-do-wells eyeing her
she locks the doors again, just for luck
33 61
-  61 Michael walks slowly past a few gang-bangers on the steps
The obvious leader, , eyes him
Big Mike
Where you been
Michael ignores, keeps walking
(') And who's that fine piece o' thing driving you around
One of Alton's minions, , sits nearby
Michael sees him, nods
Hey, David
David, a little embarrassed to be with Alton, nods back
62
-   -  62 Michael arrives at an apartment and stops, taken aback
On the door is an   and padlock
He reads from the eviction for several seconds
An Addict down the way fires up and slumps into bliss

-   A63 With Leigh Anne's car in the bg
, Michael, hidden from view slumps against a wall, looking lost - the first real emotions we've seen from-him
63
'  -  () 63 She watches as Michael approaches the building with nothing in his hands, and makes his way back to the car
She unlocks it and he crawls inside
After a pregnant moment
She wadn't home
We can come back
Michael takes this in, looks out the window
() 34 63 : 63 She prolly moved to a nicer place
64
-  64 Wrong side of the tracks
Michael and Leigh Anne cross the street toward the shop
've lived in Memphis my whole life and never been anywhere near here
You're going to take care of me, right
got your back
That's good to know
Thank you
As they start to walk, Leigh Anne reaches up and takes Michael's arm
He holds it out for her
65
-  ( ) 65 An    directs Leigh Anne and Michael
Everything  got to fit him will be -right here
This is it
If this is all you got why's it say "Big and Tall" on the sign
Big and Tall
You need "Bigger and Taller"
He walks away
She starts to pore through the small rack
Anything you like
( ) The one thing  know about shopping is that if you don't absolutely love it in the store, you won't wear it
The store is where you like it best
() () 35 65 : 65 (') And before you choose something think about yourself wearing it and ask yourself: Is this me
She finds one shirt, holds it out
(') What about this
He shakes his head, "no"
(') ( ) This isn't atrocious
He shakes his head again
After a beat he points
almost laughs
(') This one
This is the one you like
He nods, completely sure
66
-  66 Drop off area
Leigh Anne's car pulls up and , Collins and Michael get out
Have a great day
Learn something
They say a few good-byes, get out and walk toward the arch
Only then do we see what Michael is wearing: a Leigh Anne shakes her head, watching him walk away
car behind her
She checks the rear view mirror -- (') Don't get your panties in a wad
67
-  67 Ladies who lunch
The right sort doing their thing
Leigh Anne sits at a table with three friends, ,  and They sip on lemon water and nibble at salads
The best part about Paris was the food
() () The Blind Side - Yellow Draft -- 04/15/09 36 67 : 67 (') They use sauce like we use gravy had to join a gym the day'we got back
Any of y'all spent much time on the other side of town
On the freeway
Where exactly are you talking about
Alabama Street
Hurt Village
Hurt Village -- that sounds like a threat
You're not far off
It would "hurt" me to go there
It would certainly hurt your reputation to go there
(tongue in cheek) 'm actually from there but didn't mind hard work and look where  am now
Eating an eighteen dollar salad
And it's a little soggy to be honest
Such a shame
(re: her salad) Yes it is
() 37 67 : 67 Civil rights was responsible for some good things but those programs - building ugly, low cost housing
mean how could you be creative if you lived there
It's stifling
Did you know that black men were employed at a higher rate before those programs
It's a fact
They're not "black", Elaine
The term du jour is African-American
And what if they're from Jamaica, or like Bermuda
Then they're BerMUDian-Americans
They all cringe and laugh
So, why are you asking about the projects, Leigh
Anne
Another one of your charities
project for the projects
That's catchy
Money would raise itself
(off their laughs) Don't laugh
Count me in, Leigh Anne
And they laugh harder
Leigh Anne smiles, biting her lip
68
-  -  68 and Michael sit at the island doing their homework
It can't be that hard
Oh, yeah
Si looks at the Michael's notebook
() 38 68 : 68 There are different parts of a sentence and you just have to draw lines showing what they do
Sean stops by the refrigerator for a cold drink while he talks on his cell
( ) They're gonna get rid of those stores in Florida
'll look it over now but  need the sales figures by tomorrow morning
Dad, you remember how to diagram sentences
Nah
Sean starts to leave, then stops at the door, turns around, sighs and walks over
He leans in over Michael
(') Let's see
You don't have to help
(off Sean's
look) mean if you're busy or somethin'
know
(points to page) Think of a sentence like a football team
This is a noun here, see
That's like the team name or what they're known for - whether they're a running team or a passing team
And this is the verb
That's what makes 'em go - like a star player -- maybe a quarterback, maybe a running back
And this is an adjective - everybody oohs and ahs over adjectives but they're not as important as verbs
They're like wide receivers
() 39 68 : 68 Or kickers
Michael just stares at them
(') You have no idea what we're talking about, do you
Not exactly
They all laugh
Leigh Anne watches, fixated on the image of the three
Sean has an arm on Michael's shoulder
She smiles, almost sadly
69
-   --  () 69 Leigh Anne hands over clean sheets and pillows to Michael, who starts to make the bed
Do you want to stay here, Michael
He keeps working
(') Because if you want to
stay
for awhile
longer
'll try and find some time to figure out a bedroom for you
He stops, turns to her
She walks over, examines the structure of the couch
It sags a bit
(') mean, look at this, you've practically ruined a
ten thousand dollar couch
She moves closer to him
Her face softens
(') Do you want to stay here, Michael
don't want to go anyplace else
She's a bit befuddled by the response
() 40 69 : 69 Well,
alright then
70
-  -  70 Leigh Anne sits in a chair reading through Michael's file
see here on the admission that we're Michael's contact for medical emergencies
Mrs
Smith (from the admissions meeting) sits with her
Sean wrote that in last week
We needed a contact number and the ones listed weren't in service
Love that man
Leigh Anne pulls out another sheet, hands it over
(`) What's this
The state makes schools measure for career aptitude in eighth grade
It came with his'file
They try to figure out what a kid's going to be in the eighth grade
What does

Mrs
Smith nods and reads over Michael's results
Doesn't look promising
Spatial relations - third percentile
Ability to learn - fifth percentile
(sees another number) It's funny though
He tested in the 98th percentile in one category
Which one
() 41 70 : 70 "Protective instincts
" Leigh Anne smiles and hands the file back
(') It's just so sad
Leigh Anne considers this, then
Yes, it is sad
So sad
But he either doesn't know it or doesn't think so and it's my job, and your job, to make sure he doesn't find out
(off Mrs
Smith's look) Michael Oher doesn't feel sorry for himself and 'll be damned if he starts to because of the way we treat him
(again off her look) "Darned

Is this his address as well
Yes
He lives with us
Are y'all his foster parents
No
His legal guardians
oh
no
The Employee does a search on the computer
As she types
Does he have a Social Security card
Leigh Anne looks to Michael, who shakes his head
(') Birth certificate
() 62 101 : 101 We tried to find one for school, but
You don't know which city, which county, which hospital
How big a problem is this
Employee looks to Leigh Anne
There's nobody named Michael Oher in the system
Another last name perhaps
Leigh Anne again turns to Michael, who shrugs
Look, 'll sign something saying he lives with us and we'll pay for the insurance; whatever it takes
(off her look) What's it gonna take
Off the Employee's look -- 102
-    '   -  102 As they get ready for bed
Sean rinses his mouth -- You wanna do what
Don't pretend you didn't hear me
Shouldn't we at least talk about it
What do you think we're doing
And don't act like 'm going behind your back
know you put us down as his medical contact at school
() 63
102 : 102 There's a big difference between paying for a broken arm and being legally responsible for someone
Someone we barely know
And that's another thing
We have to find out more about his past
He won't talk about it
He's like an onion; you have to peel it a layer at a time
Not if you use a knife
What if we sent him to a child psychologist
Do you really expect Big Mike -- --- -- expect Michael to lie down and talk about his childhood like he's Woody Allen or something
Michael's gift is his ability to forget
He's mad at no one and doesn't really care what happened in the past
This puts her on her heels
' You're right
(like he's never heard ) Excuse me
"You're right
" (off her grimace) How'd those words taste coming out of your mouth
Like vinegar
She moves to him, holds him
() 64 102 : 102 (') At least promise me you'll think about it
Alright
"Alright" you'll think about it or "alright" we should do it
Is there a difference
103
103 Leigh Anne sits in a crowded waiting area, talking on her cell phone
She's been here awhile
( ) Just tell Rodney to hold the chiffonier for me and 'll get by after while
She hangs up and, exasperated by the wait, rises and walks a counter, pushing past someone -- (') 'm not cutting, just asking
( ) 've been waiting for over an hour and  look around and all  see is people shooting the bull and drinking coffee
Who runs this place anyway
The "heard it all"  points to the wall with a government seal and a large portrait of President Bush
(') Well 'd have it in shape in two days,  can tell you that
'm sure you would
How can  help you
She turns to the man waiting behind her
He was first
() 65 103 103 : No, you go ahead

want to hear this
Me, too
( ) do not appreciate the attitude
Ma'am, you can tell me what you want or 'll make sure you wait all day
How
Can
Help
You
'd like to become a legal guardian
Lord look over that child

- haggard , let's call him , sits across from Leigh Ann
He looks at a flimsy file
There's very little on Michael
Most of his files have been lost
What is in there
few case notes
(holds one sheet up) This one describes an incident where officers forcibly removed Michael and six half-siblings from Denise Oher's care when Michael was seven
Quite a scene evidently
They had to split up the kids
And it's far from the worst
Where is she
His mother
Dunno, but if you find her we have a bunch more files we could add to
(
) 66 104 : 104 How many children does she have
At least a dozen, probably more
With her drug arrest record my guess would be she can't even remember
Leigh Anne absorbs this
We'd need her permission though, right
No
Michael is a ward of the state
Just apply and get a Judge to sign off on it
So you would give him away without even telling his mother
Ronald shrugs
105
-  105 Looks the same as before except for the'blonde woman walking between the buildings
Leigh Anne spots and checks a list of tenants posted
She can barely see through the cover as someone has scrawled " Block" on it

-  106 The one Michael visited before
Leigh Anne summons her courage and knocks on the door
And again
No answer
comes from the apartment behind her -- '  (
) Who you lookin' for
Startled, Leigh Anne turns and sees Alton approaching
'm looking for Denise Oher
Dee Dee don't stay there no more

Chances are she ain't gone far

You with Big Mike now
You wanna come in for a wine cooler or sumthin'
No,  can't, but thank you

( ) He's fine
He's doing well
(after a beat) When did you move from the other building
() 68 109 : 109 Denise emerges from the back of the apartment, adjusting a wig on her head, making herself "presentable
" Awhile back
This is temporary
Friends let me stay here
When did you last see Michael
Iono
We might have some wine in the kitchen, if
No, no that's very kind but
How many foster kids you got living with you
Oh, 'm not a foster parent to Michael
We were just helping him out
State don't pay you nothing
No
And he lives with you
(Leigh Anne nods) And you feed him
( ) Buy him clothes, too
When  can find them in his size
You a fine Christian lady
try to be
This is all real nice what you're doing, but don't be surprised if one day you wake up and he gone
() 69 109 109 : What do you mean
He's a "runner"
That's what the state called him after they took him from me
(off her look) Every foster home they sent him to, he'd slip out the window at night and come looking for me
No matter where  was that boy would come find me, take care of me
( ) 've had some
health problems
Mrs
Oher, was Michael born under a different name
Denise tries to remember
After a few seconds
Proctor
That was his Daddy's last name
Where is he, the father, if you don't mind me asking
Ain't
seen him since he left
And when was that
Week after Mike was born
Do you have Michael's birth certificate
Denise sighs, looks around at the mess, shakes her head
And then, unexpectedly, starts to cry softly
(') It's okay, Mrs
Oher
'll figure it out
Leigh Anne walks over, kneels and takes Denise's hands
() 70 109 : 109 (') You'll always be Michael's Mama
Would you like to see him
No
Not this way
People lose birth certificates
It's nothing to be ashamed of
It's Williams
(off Leigh Anne's look) His last name's Williams
Couldn't even remember who the boy's father is
Leigh Anne bites her lip'and puts her arms around Denise, who hugs back

Michael, we have something to ask you

Well, what it means is, we want to know if you'd like to be a part of this family
Michael looks to a grinning , to Collins who nods and smiles, then to Leigh Anne

Michael smiles and he and  get inside the truck
He wanted a truck

You are now seniors
Congratulations
But with that distinction comes responsibility
This will be one of your tougher courses because my job is to prepare you, at least most of you, for the rigors of college Freshman English
You are each holding a class study guide which details assignments
won't remind you what is due and when
Read the materials and come prepared
At the end of the year you will each choose one of our literature assignments and present a written dissection of the piece

Busted lip, some facial bruising
When an airbag strikes a child his size it usually means a fractured face, a broken neck or worse
It's almost like the airbag started at him then changed direction
Defective or something
Very, very lucky

She walks over, kneels down
Michael, it wasn't your fault

He moves inside and the linebacker moves outside
Michael looks at the move, confused
Hut
Tony, the Wingate  starts to drop back but hands off the ball on a draw to , the Oompaloompah
Michael, unsure which player to block, just stands there while they both crush Bobby
The Milford players high five and both give Michael a shoulder as they pass him

But he's quick as a cat and jumps to bat down a pass

Michael and Bobby are at the bottom of the pile
66 extricates himself from the pile and gives Michael a little kick as a cherry on top

Blood flies from Alton's face - eighteen years of subdued rage coming out in seconds
grab Michael from behind and one -- ' Michael screams like a banshee, spins, grabs them and tackles them over the couch
An errant round  into the ceiling
table flies and the crib smashes
Michael looks to David, frozen in the corner, then over to the  child on the floor
He grabs his head and heaves, trying to make it all stop - the music, the screams, the crying
The shots  to the music and

Michael breaks away and runs to Denise

Leigh Anne stops, looks to Alton
(') But you tell him 'll be seeing him around
You tell him he'll get his
Michael was here
Last night
Sneaked me then took off like a little bitch
So you tell him, sleep with one eye open
Yod'hear me, bitch

No, you hear me, bitch

'd imagine the last thing anybody at Hurt Village wants is cops snooping around
(after a beat) swore 'd never ask but
how'd you make it out of there, Michael
When  was little and something awful was happening, my Mama would tell me to close my eyes
() () 125' 202 : 202 (') She was tryin' to keep me from seeing her do drugs or other bad things
And she'd say, "keep 'em closed till  say so
" And then when she was finished or the bad things were over she'd say, "now when  count to three, you open your eyes and the past is gone, the world is a good place, and it's all gonna be okay
" You closed your eyes
He nods
She shakes her head, amazed at the kid
They stare out at the street, then
(') You know, when  was driving all over Kingdom Come looking for you just kept thinking about one thing
() Ferdinand the bull
Everyone assumed because he was big that he wanted to fight in the ring
But he just wanted to sit under a tree and smell the flowers
(right at him) know  should have asked this a long time ago but do you even wanna play football
mean, do you even like it
' Michael considers this
'm pretty good at it
Yeah, you are
( ) Sean and  have been talking and Michael, if you're gonna accept a football scholarship we think it should be from Tennessee
(off his look) And  promise you  will be at every game cheering for you
Every game
() 126 202 : 202 But  will not wear that gaudy orange of theirs because it's not in my color wheel
You want me to go to Tennessee

It's your life
What if  wanted to flip burgers
She takes this in, swallows hard and Your decision; your life
Michael smiles
Okay
Okay, what
203
-  -  203 Michael is at another session with Jocelyn Granger
'm sorry  left the other day
You were pretty upset
You ask a lot of questions
'm trying to get to the bottom of this
But all the questions you asked were about why everybody else wanted me to go to Ole Miss
() 127 203 : 203 Okay
You asked about everybody but me
You never asked why  wanted to go there
Alright, fine, Michael
why do you want to go to Ole Miss
It's where my family goes to school
It's where they've always gone to school
Granger considers this, stares at Michael, then almost, just almost, smiles

-  204 Cars are unloaded as parents and siblings move their kids into the dorm
Tearful good-byes and lots of picture taking
Leigh Anne and
Sean walk from the dorm toward the car, giving last words of advice
and
Collins are there, too
College is going to be a different experience for you
There are lots of distractions
Just have fun
There'll always be some nimrod in the dorm who wants to play video games all night, or goof off on the internet
You're gonna have a great time know  did
Leigh Anne gives Sean a look - "You're not helping
" () 128 204 : 204 You'll spend lots of time at practice which means you have to be very dedicated to your studies
(
) Relax, Mama
Miss Sue walks up carrying papers
(') Just got back from the library where  reserved a private cubicle for the semester
(hands sheets to Michael) Here's your class schedule and our study hall hours
She reaches in her purse for her keys
(') Now, if y'all don't mind 'm gonna go move into my new apartment
She walks away
Thank you, Miss Sue
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Sean and Michael and  eye a sashaying past
does a little dance move and laughs
Have a lot of fun
Leigh Anne notices their looks
Michael Oher, you listen to me want you to enjoy yourself but you need to know that if you get a girl pregnant out of wedlock  will climb in the car, drive here to Oxford and cut off your penis
(sotto: to Michael) She means it
() 129 204 : 204 Yes ma'am
Leigh Anne gives Sean a look that says, "let's get on the road
" Sean offers a hand; Michael shakes it
Collins high fives him
offers a fist; Michael knocks it
Leigh Anne, tearing up, nods and gives Michael a quick hug
(') Thank you, Mama
Overwhelmed, she turns for the car with a little wave
The 78'll be a parking lot
We should go
She gets inside and closes the door for privacy
Sean, , Collins and Michael stand there, watching her cry
Why does she always do that
She's an onion, Michael
You have to peel her one layer at a time
Michael walks over to the car, knocks on the window
She rolls it down, dabbing tears from her eyes
What
need a proper hug
She gets out of the car and holds him for a long time

Then another headline, another young, black face
Another and another, until the last headline shows a photo of David, Alton's minion - his face full of shining promise
' In the last paragraph they talked about his superb athletic skills and how different his life might have been if he hadn't fallen behind and dropped out of school
He was twenty-one years old the day he died
It was his birthday

' That could have been anyone
It could have been my son, Michael
208 208 Beautiful on a fall day
And then and Michael, books in hand,   walking
It's like the other Michael/crowd shots with one difference - this time he moves at the same speed as everyone else
