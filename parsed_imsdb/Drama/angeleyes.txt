by Gerald DiPego October 1999 Seventh Draft/Polish : ( ) - As   play, we study the city's nighttime pulse, ribbons of headlights moving and cross-connecting like blood through the veins of a body -- impressionistic, even beautiful, but what we're hearing is soulful trumpet-based , mellow and haunting, the modern classic --  sound of a Wynton Marsalis, putting a voice to our story
As  , we
: -
- Now the  is ,  are  and vision blurred
We get the impression of urgent movement
We hear
There are , , even , but , far away
Only the breathing is distinct
We come to realize it is our breathing, and we are inside someone, looking out
The man whose  this is is on the edge of consciousness and not far from death
He lies on the pavement of a freeway at the site of an accident only minutes after impact
His  goes  and  of clarity
People are swarming around him and rushing by toward the carnage of wrecked vehicles
in the distance and approaches haltingly
The man slips away, comes back toward consciousness, slips again
The crowd around the downed man parts to allow passage to a police officer
It is a woman, Officer  , She kneels at the man's side, taking charge, speaking, but we hear only  of
He sees her face clearly now, close above him
Sharon is   a dedicated professional and more
We see down into her   to a place of real caring
She stares into our eyes and   connects
We begin to hear her now -- and there are more    converging in b
g
Can you hear me
(shouting, off) This one's conscious
(
) Paramedics on the way
We are slipping away again
Sharon holds us with her eyes, and she grips our hand
() 2
: Wait
Wait
Listen to me
Can you feel that
She holds on tight
We see that our hand, held in her own, is bloody
That's my hand
Hold it
Go on -- as hard as you can
We watch our hand gripping hers, and as we hold on, the sights and sounds around us grow more clear
It's over, and 've got you, and you're safe
You're safe now
You got that
Don't let go
Don't let me go
But our eyes unlock from Sharon's and   a patch of night sky
Her voice fades awawy
Our  begins ,   that sky, as the blue-black night begins to turn white
We   that white light and
: - We   a police car from the traffic and
The beat being patrolled is a mixed neighborhood with some very rough edges
- Officer Sharon Pogue is driving the car
It is two years since we saw her at the accident site
Her partner, , sips coffee and keeps one eye on the monitor which lists all area police calls
She slows behind a car that is crawling along, an old 60s car, driven by a young man and woman who sit very close on the bench seat
The car's  is  and smoking
That car is older than they are
'67 Chevy Impala
That's what  said
() 3
: Needs a servicing
Don't we all
Robby nearly spits his coffee, laughing at what Sharon has said and trying not to choke
Sharon smiles, shaking her head
Get it together, officer
As Robby smiles, Sharon looks ahead at the young couple who each have an arm around the other
She is stroking his neck
He is making gentle circles in her hair
Sharon watches this, and for a moment her eyes reveal a depth that may be loneliness, but she quickly pushes her thoughts away and hits the , startling Robby and startling the people ahead who now disengage and drive on
Jesus, Pogo
Almost spilled my coffee again
You didn't like his hair, or what
love Elvis hair
They were going two damn miles an hour
But Robby's eyes have caught something on the monitor
Let's roll to this -- fight in progress
As Robby secures that coffee cup, Sharon hits the and speeds around the car in front of them
- At the same time, a few blocks away, an ,   is carrying two plastic grocery bags that are too heavy for him
Walking behind this man is a younger man named , an attractive man with some scarring on his face
His eyes, deep down, are haunted by something, but there is energy in his step
He is dressed in a relaxed and stylish manner, not expensive
He begins to pick up his pace to catch up to the old man
() 4
: People glance at Catch, nad he glances back in an open and unflinching way, ready for anything, a smile, a nod, or -- because these are some of
's mean streets -- a threatening or taunting look
These he also meets openly, without a trace of fear
The man has been through some kind of fire, and it has left him different from us
Outside the usual boundaries
Catch walks beside the Old Man, glancing at him
Finally, the man glances back, wondering and suspicious, but Catch has a slight, disarming smile, open and honest
'know
since we're both walking the same way,  could take one of those bags for you
That way, do some upper body work while 'm walking along
Helps my back
What d'you say
The Old Man trudges on, proud and suspicious, too
Right now your mind's making pictures of me robbing your groceires, but, y'know, nine times out of ten, people do the right thing
The Old Man glances at him, still not convinced, but he soon has to stop and rest
Catch stops, too
The old man looks at him, a bit embarrassed
It's the dog food that makes it so heavy
Catch nods, puts out his hand
The Old Man hesitates, then decides and lifts a bag, and Catch takes it
guess it's worth it
for a good dog
Catch isn't kidding
He has that honesty
The Old Man nods and starts trudging again
As they walk on together, Catch reaches for that second bag
The man relents and lets him take it
They continue on, Catch carrying the bags and every now and then lifting them a bit for his upper body work

- This is the call Sharon and Robby have sped to
It is a chaotic scene of cops breaking up a fight between eight boys, 16-20
big , 18 or so, is being pulled off another by Sharon and Robby
The Kid is wild and resisting and Sharon shows her toughness and professionalism and some anger, too, as she slams him into a fence -- and Robby holds him while she cuffs the young man -- who is very mouthy, playing to his friends
Look at this bitch
Whoo
Benny, look at this
Sharon and Robby are both very good at their jobs, taking this Kid to their car while other cops contain the rest
crowd watches -- mostly teens
(to Sharon) You come in with me
Hey, bitch
Some of his bystanders friends howl at that
You're going to arrest me, you come into the back seat with me
Come on
He resists a bit, but they're getting him into the car
Come on
We'll have a good time
-  (  ) Sharon's on the radio to dispatch as Robby drives and the Kid keeps mouthing off
(to radio) Three Adam Five -- show us 1019 to the jail with one male prisoner
Take off your uniform
Take off my handcuffs, bitch, and come back here
want one touch
Give it a rest
Sharon is stone-faced through this
() 6
: If you're going to put me away, you gotta give me one sweet touch
- As Robby and Sharon bring their suspect to the booking counter, each holding one of his cuffed arms
The Kid is looking at Sharon's hand on his arm
That ain't the touch
That ain't the touch  want
They get him to the counter
As  remove your cuffs,  want you to put your hands here
Spread your legs
More
As they remove the cuffs, the Kid makes a sudden move toward Sharon, reaching between her legs -- but she was not only ready for this, but hoping for it -- and the stoniness of her face cracks into fierce anger as she moves quickly and grabs the Kid by the hair, bringing his face into her upraised knee
He cries out and goes down on his knees, hurting and bleeding
The jailer rushes over to help, but Robby grabs the Kid's wrists
That's it
Back off, John, we got it
Robby glances at Sharon -- a dark glance
-  () as Robby and Sharon walk to their car
They are interrupted by one of their lieutenants, , walking their way and stopping to stare at Sharon
She meets his look
You trying to be a bad-ass, Pogue
She is straightforward, not rebellious
just dealt with the situation
The prisoner
() 7
: And you don't see a pattern here
(pause) want you to keep yourself way inside the line instead of walking on it
All right
Are you taking notes
He walks away, and Sharon and Robby walk on to their car -- she is dark; he is glancing at her
You broke his nose
He grabbed me
End of story
And you were waiting for him
You were hoping
You were making long-range plans for his ass while he was mouthing off in the car -- and you're supposed to be above that shit
If you think  crossed the line, put it in the report
Pogo, stop the shit
What is it
You pissed off at me, too
They enter the car, Sharon behind the wheel
Not you, Rob
You're a rare unthreatened male cop with a good marriage, and you like to eat where  eat -- so everything's code four
She  the  and starts to back out, and he reaches over and turns  the
She stares hotly at him -- but then, slowly, she softens, takes a deep breath
Come over    for dinner tonight
'll call    Charlene
She'd like to see you
It's been awhile
We'll talk about    it
() 8
: She  the  again, more calm, starts to drive out of the lot
Thanks
But  she'll invite friends, try and fix me up
She's always trying to fix me up so she doesn't have to worry about you and me
She doesn't worry about that
They all worry about that
They both smile wryly, driving on
You don't need to fix me, Robby, or fix me up
don't want some guy to heart and soul me and then walk away 'cause he can't stand the cop thing -- or worse: he wants cop stories every night 'cause it turns him on, and he has no idea who  am inside my head
Anyway, 'm busy tonight
Got some action, huh
Well, that's promising
Yeah
Hot and heavy
: '  - She is on the floor using an exercise rig, sliding into crunches, pushing herself, sweating, alone
We the rain-spattered window as night sounds filter in, ,  , a    with that pulses the very air and the   of her window
- Catch Lambert is walking the wet streets, head down in the rain
Far away we hear that car with a - () 9
: In the glow of a street lamp, Catch sees a bright-colored object in the gutter
He picks it up out of the gurgling rain water
It is a small toy, a discarded superhero
He puts it in his pocket, walks on
Now the car, the prowling, -, - turns a corner and begins rollling along slowly -- beside Catch
He glances over, walking on
There are four tough-looking  in the car, looking for trouble
The  is
Catch glances again, walks on
Their eyes follow him like gun barrels
He stops and walks out on the street, moving toward the car, shouting over the music
Hey
You want to turn that volume down
What's your point
The men, incredulous, stop the car and snap  the in order to make sure they're hearing right
They stare death at Catch
() What did you say
What's the point of blasting your music through the whole zip code
Don't you realize there are kids trying to sleep in these apartments -- old people, sick people
They can hardly believe this
You better watch your mouth, asshole
Catch meets the man's look with his own unflinching, haunted eyes
Why
What're you gonna do
Kill me
Catch's look is not a macho challenge
It's something else -- beyond that, a man somehow without limits
One of the riders in the backseat taps the Driver's shoulder
#2 Guy's nuts
Let's go
The Driver, never breaking his death stare, snaps on the and then slowly rolls on, still glaring at Catch
Catch stands in the rain, watching them go
10
'   - Catch is arriving home, soaking wet
He lives in a slightly-seedy three-story
As he walks down the corridor toward his apaprtment, he passes a neighbor's door and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock
He pauses -- and then knocks softly on the door
Someone looks through the peephole and then opens the door -- a young single mother, friendly but with a little caution, too
She recognizes Catch
Behind her is a little boy, (five)
The woman's name is
Her son is
Hi
Hi
Your keys are in the
He gestures, and she sees the keys and retrieves them, more friendly now
Oh, thank you
Thanks a lot
God
was trying to carry Tommy and all these bags
He was so tired
Of course, as soon as put him down he had all this energy
While she is talking, Catch is staring deeply at the boy, who is shy
Catch almost speaks to the boy, wants to, goes halfway to a smile -- but the sight of the kid stirs that layer of darkness in Catch
He nods a good-bye to the mother and is about to go
She thinks about this, as he is turning, and pushes through her remaining caution to say
'know, we were just baking nectarine bars because the peaches weren't ripe
Ever had a nectarine bar
He smiles and seems to want to stay, but he is already retreating
His contact goes only so far -- and no further
Sorry
Gotta be going
And with one more glance at the boy, he walks to his apartment, unlocks it and steps in
11
'  - He walks into a bare living room -- no chairs, tables, lamps, nothing on the walls
He walks into a spotless, never-used kitchen and flips on the light, opens a drawer
In the drawer is a collection of kids' toys, some found, some purchased, mostly plastic figures
The action of opening the door has started some battery-operated animals moving around in there
Now from his pocket he takes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in and closes the drawer
He walks back into the living room
He sits on the floor, leans back against the wall, his clothes still soaked from the rain
He stares at his thoughts, looking a bit numb -- and lost
/
- Sharon is just leaving with a clean uniform on a hanger in a plastic bag
It's a neighborhood place where alterations are done
As she is leaving, an older woman is just entering
This is
, beaming at Sharon, a real talker
Sherry
Hi, Mrs
Vander
You're looking good
Oh, you just wait
splurged
She is pulling a new blue dress out of a shopping bag
It's for the church and the party
It's just a little too long
Looks great
'know,  cried over the invitation -- just imagine me in church
(laughs) It'll be so good to spend time with you
() 12
: Sharon forces a smile -- but is mystified
Mrs
Vander is walking to the counter and pausing to say
You know Dan and    renewed our vows last year
bet that's where your mom got   the idea
Their vows
Your mom and dad -- the ceremony
Mrs
Vander realizes what's going on and stammers on, sympathetic and embarrassed
Oh, well
y'know,  just got that invitation a few
just now, so 'm sure you'll
Oh, yeah
We've had
there's been some problems with the mail in our building, so
'll probably get it today
They're both covering like mad, both realizing Sharon's been left out
So,  guess 'll see you
Sure, honey
'll see you there
Sharon leaves -- Mrs
Vander staring after her, feeling bad
As Sharon walks away, we see her forced smile die, replaced by an old pain and darkness
- Robby and Sharon's unit pulls up at a house remodel with a sign marked "
" Sharon exits the car and walks onto the site, moves toward a man who is both carpenter and supervisor on the job
This is her brother,  , 29
They are not comfortable with each other -- an old wound
He gives her a wary nod
She's trying a little harder, being a bit more friendly
We can sense the strain
() 13
: didn't see his truck, so
He's not here
How you doing
She touches his shoulder as she says this, a friendly gesture, a reaching out
He doesn't respond, only shrugs
'm okay
Kathy and the boy
Bet he's big now
Growin' fast
Is he looking more like you now -- or did he get lucky
She has broken through a bit and they both smile a brief, wry smile
He's got Kathy's looks and brains and my strong back
You should feel his grip
(pause) You just passing by
She looks about
Place is coming along nice
The octagon window
Dad's signature
But Larry's look stays on her, wondering what's on her mind
Look, Larry,  shouldn't have to hear it from Mrs
Vander -- about what's happening
He turns back to his work now as they speak, uncomfortable
() 14
: What's happening
(hurt) So you really weren't going to tell me
Nobody was going to tell me
Mom and Dad renewing their vows, the church, the party
Mrs
Vander is all excited
She bought a new dress
It's blue
We're workin' on Dad
We think you should be there
We told him
Mom told him
We mentioned it
He's holding out, hah
You want to come
It's my family
Jesus, Lar
It's over ten years, and he won't let go of it
You two were always head to head
For good reason
Remember
Let's just leave it
She stares, then
You're still scared of him
Pissed, he throws his hammer down on the plywood, turns to her
() 15
: don't think it's a good idea you coming around here in uniform
People see it, they think we're in trouble here
Nice seeing you, too
She walks away
He frowns, picks up his hammer, goes back to work
As Sharon walks towards the car, she sees a van approaching and she holds up a hand to Robby and calls out
Two more minutes
And she walks toward the oncoming van, which is parking now
- The van is driven by , Sharon's brother's wife
Beside her in a car seat is ,
, four years old
Sharon comes to the rolled down window on the driver's side
She has a warm smile for Kathy and the child
Kathy smiles, too
Hi
Look -- it's your Auntie Sharon
Hey, Champ, my God, look how big
She has a special affection for the boy -- who is subdued, but he smiles a small one for his aunt
She takes one of his hands and they shake in mock formality
Hi
Ow
You hurt my hand with that grip
Whew
() 16
: She shakes her fingers, and he smiles a bit more
Sharon reaches in and rubs his head in a mock knuckling move
He laughs
She smooths his hair, affectionately
We're bringing Larry his lunch
Hey, it's good to see you
It's been awhile
What
Sharon is staring at Kathy's badly bruised ear
Oh,  went boom into a low shelf -- chasing after him of course
(nodding to the child) How're you doing
Sharon pulls her eyes off the bruise to meet Kathy's look -- and connect
'm semi-okay
heard about the
ceremony and the party
(embarrassed) Oh
hope you'll be there
(pause) Really
Sharon smiles a bit, appreciating the support
She pats Kathy's arm
Take it easy
You too, Champ
The boy offers his little hand to shake again
Oh, no
You're not breaking my fingers again
They smile and drive on and Sharon walks toward her car and Robby
-  ( ) We  moms and kids and a basketball game in the park and   Catch walking by
Two pre-teens are playing bounce and catch with a rubber ball against a (tennis practice) wall, and one of them misses, and Catch makes a lunge and snags the ball
Instead of throwing it to one of the boys, he fires it at the wall
() 17
: One of the boys catches it, bounces it off the wall toward Catch
Catch grabs it, and now he's part of this rapid-fire game -- and he's athletic and funny, too, playing hard and mugging and making them smile until
a comes  down the boulevard, slowing a bit to  its  a few times -- clearing traffic
Catch glances up and sees
' Sharon is in the car beside Robby
Stunned by the sight of her -- and he doesn't know why
He can't move, can't breathe, eyes fixed on her
The pulls around a truck and  on -- and that's when he is struck by a memory, a little like lightning
It comes as a quick -- -
-      - ' -- The man near death
Sharon is bending close to him, this all just a sliver of an image, and it jolts him
() The police car is now converging with other squads just half a block away
Catch throws the ball back to the boys and runs toward the police incident
The boys watch him go, wondering
- police   car is parked askew near this closed store -- as now Robby   and Sharon's   to a  beside it
Two cops   are calling and motioning to them, one holds a shotgun
This is
Break-in alarm
One suspect in -- nobody out
Take the back
And they are moving
- Robby and Sharon are hurrying around to the back as we hear more    in front
18
- As Catch arrives on the scene and sees Sharon and Robby moving around the building to the back
He is still amazed at the sight of her
He decides to follow her, keeping her in sight, driven
, They are scouting through crates and weeds as a young man is flushed from cover at the back of the store and runs from them
Freeze
The man runs on, and Sharon chases with Robby close behind her
Sharon speaks to her shoulder radio mike as she runs
(to radio) Three--5, foot pursuit
Suspect fleeing south on Pico Place, young man, green jacket
No visible weapon
(to Robby) Robby
Right behind you
(to man) Stop and lie down with your arms
shit
The man has jumped a fence
Sharon follows
Careful
see him
She goes over the fence, then Robby
- The man runs and Sharon chases
Robby, not far behind glances off to the side, seeing Catch, still following
Citizen on your right
Hey
() 19
: But Sharon is now closing on the fleeing man who turns suddenly, pointing a handgun
Gun
And Sharon, wide-eyed, is already pulling her weapon, but not in time
The man is aiming at her and about to fire when he is tackled by Catch
Catch and the man go sprawling, and the gun flies out of the man's hand, and Sharon is on him in an instant, pointing her gun at him
Freeze
Right there
Catch scrambles to his feet
Robby joins Sharon and puts his knee in the man's back and cuffs him, then glances at Catch
So does Sharon
But Catch starts to hurry off
Hey
Wait
Two other cops (Ray Juliette and ) rush toward the suspect on the ground
You got him
He was armed
Jesus
Citizen took him down
No shit
Sharon stares across the lot to where Catch has halted
More cops are converging
Ray Juliette and Sanchez move toward Catch, while a sergeant and others surround Sharon and the suspect
In between the crowd of cops, Catch and Sharon glance at each other, during
as the cops reach him
() 20
: What happened here
just saw it and
saw the gun, so
You all right, Pogo
She is shaken, speaks softly
was dead
'know
She glances toward Catch
(She doesn't recognize him from the accident
) Their eyes meet briefly, but then their attention is pulled to the others
Sharon speaks to her sergeant
He had me
was dead
He is shaken, too
Sanchez is taking notes as Ray checks his
was just walking by
live near here
Ray nods, handing the
to Sanchez
Sergeant's going to want to talk to you, Mr
Lambert
We'll need a statement
Don't worry about it
That's just procedure
Look -- we appreciate what you did
No bullshit
Let us buy you a drink tonight, all right
You know where the Rib House is
Catch glances at Sharon again, and he nods
21
-  ( ) Catch, a bit bruised and dirty from his tackle, is carrying groceries up the walkway steps to a small, well- kept home
He is taking out a key as he walks to the covered portico
'  - , 60, is an attractive woman with warmth and intelligence in her eyes
She is in a wheelchair, at a writing table where she carefully translates an English text into Chinese characters
She glances up as Catch opens the front door and heads for the kitchen, speaking as he goes, not looking at her or into the living room at all
got you nectarines because the peaches are hard as rocks
Your jacket's all dirty
She rolls away from the table in her motorized chair -- and as they speak across the house, she performs a ritual
(
) tackled a guy
Elanora is moving about the living room, picking up framed photographs and turning them face down
We don't see what -- or who -- is in these photos
She is turning them all in a routine way, used to this
Why would you 'tackle' a guy
(
) Why do you think
- Catch is at the cupboards, putting away groceries as Elanora rolls into the kitchen, her
He had the ball
He was going for a touchdown
Can you be serious
() 22
: (as he works) What day is today
Wednesday
No
They are not smiling at their little jokes, but they have an ease with each other and the deep love of dear friends
He doesn't pause in his work, but we can see some nervousness in him as he says
Met somebody today
Mrs
Chu is now taking some of the groceries out of the bags to help
Oh
That's good
Ahh -- they had the broccolini today
Thank you
woman
Elanora is more interested and curious now, still helping with the groceries and being casual
You didn't tackle her, too, did you
No
Good, Catch
She's a police officer
(stops; worried) Are you in trouble
Catch goes on working, a depth in his eyes
No
No trouble
() 23
: Elanora watches him work and gladdens slightly
We see her own depth of feeling
Well
that's a good thing
He is still working, but his eyes are on his thoughts, his struggle
saw her once a long time ago
Elanora stares a moment
This has meaning for her
Where
He doesn't answer
He's nervous about this
She looks the same
Now she watches him as he moves to the refrigerator and continues his work in silence
- It's a noisy restaurant with a large bar area
We a booth of off-duty cops, out of uniform now, including Ray, Sanchez, Sharon and a few more male officers
They're all a bit high
Sharon shows the signs, too
They are passing around a photo now as one  looks at it and says
Beautiful
And Sanchez says proudly
Yeah
My wife's got him in agility class
No shit
Ray is handed the photo, and we see that they're talking about Sanchez's dog, the name "" printed on the photo
() 24
: 'Rex
' Rex is good
wonder who the first person was to name a dog 'Fido,' and what the hell does it mean
like how you're always asking the big questions, Ray
There is some laughter
Ray is a smart-ass and a flirt
got a big question for you, Pogo -- but  can only ask it when we're alone
She moves some of the change on the table, sliding it toward Ray
Here -- use this -- call your wife and ask her instead
happen to know Ray's wife is busy tonight
They laugh and drink and Ray asks her
Why doesn't your partner ever come out with us
Robby's a family man
'm a family man
Yeah, but his family actually likes him
More laughter
Sharon's eyes do a quick roam of the bar
Ray catches this
That Lambert --  guess he's not showing either
She shrugs this off like it's not important and starts to slide out of the booth
() 25
: Where are you going
The head
Do you mind
She's just gonna freshen up her makeup
You're wearing makeup
She leaves the booth with a wry frown
That reminds me, Ray
You still have that eye-liner you borrowed from me
She grins, leaving the laughter behind her
- Catch has entered the bar
He is watching Sharon leave the booth and walk to the rest rooms
He looks back at the raucous booth and hesitates
He sits at a small table near the door
- Sharon is drying her hands in the bar's bathroom, staring into the mirror
No smile now
We see into her mind for a second
- Pointing the gun at her face today
() in the mirror and see how shaken she still is
waitress is leaving his table, and he looks back at Sharon's booth and sees that she still isn't there
He starts to turn, and then freezes as he hears
() 26
: (
) There you are
She has stepped out of the bathroom and spotted him
He is surprised, face to face now
We thought you wouldn't show
Why you sitting here
He shrugs
don't talk to a lot of people
Would you
He half rises and gestures to the other chair
She glances back at her booth, then sits
She's nervous, too
didn't have a chance to thank you
'm Sharon Pogue
She puts out her hand
He stares at that hand for just half a beat before taking it
They shake
The feel of her hand holding his evokes the memory of the accident, but he covers this
You look familiar
guess  live on the beat you patrol
Her way to cover nervousness is to be blunt, even tough
Why would you do that -- jump a man with a gun
(shrugs) He was going to shoot you
He could've shot you
You have a death wish
You a bungee jumper
No
didn't have time to think about it
() 27
: What d'you think about it now
figure
it was worth the risk
For someone you don't even know
Yeah -- and for what you do think cops are great
Out there, trying to keep it safe
You know
Tough job
Firemen are everybody's heroes
Kids wave at firemen
People should wave at cops
Did you ever think about how many people are walking around this town because you saved them
never thought about it
because you helped them or because you arrested somebody who would've hurt them or because you just
did your job
Now 'm walking around this town because of you
Ever think about that
Maybe you should be a cop
don't know
look pretty dumb in a hat
He has made her smile
and  don't drive and, like said,  don't talk to many people
Am  talking too much
am
You go ahead
Okay
What d'you do
You employed around here
Oh, God
Sorry
Every time  try to talk to somebody, it comes out like an interrogation
() 28
: Where do you want to be ten years from now
What
Somebody taught that to me
Kind of a shortcut
You ask somebody, what are your plans for tomorrow -- what're your dreams for ten years from now
It's supposed to get things started
Does it work
never tried it
Bullshit
No
Really
just remembered it -- God is my witness
Not in here
It's mostly cops
Now she has made him smile, the first real smile we've seen from Catch
It's open and real and she is charmed by it
You have a nice smile
She's a bit self-conscious, saying that, and just as she says it, the waitress arrives with shots and beers for both of them
Sharon looks up, questioning, and the waitress nods toward the booth
Catch and Sharon see the cops, staring, smiling, raising their glasses
There is a hint of teasing in their grins
And now Sharon is more self-conscious, and a bit tough again, taking her drink and turning back to Catch
So
what were we talking about
Oh, yeah, you were giving me some line about starting a conversation
() 29
: The shortcut
Okay
'll play
They clink glasses and drink
Then
Tomorrow 've got a night watch shift
If the weather clears, in the morning 'll go hiking
If it rains, 'll go to the gym -- and the laundromat
Ten years from now
want to be living in some mountainous place
Tibet
Could be Tibet
Could be Colorado
Your turn
But now Ray Juliette is approaching the table
Hey, Pogo -- don't keep him all to yourself
Come on over, Lambert, join the group
We'll buy you dinner, give you a medal for saving Pogo's ass
Sharon drains her shot and stands
Actually, 'm kind of tired, Ray
'm taking off
Oh
'll
walk you to your car
Catch stands and turns to Ray
Thanks for the drink
Least we could do
We don't like her very much -- but we don't want to lose her
Sharon frowns and waves to the booth of cops
Ray smiles and shakes hands with Catch as a good-bye
() 30
: Take care
And Catch and Sharon leave
- As Catch and Sharon exit the building, walk toward her car
It's not a great neighborhood
Maybe  should walk you to your car
don't have a car
They walk on, silent a moment
This doesn't come easy for her
Want a ride home
Oh, thanks, but
like to walk
It's starting to rain
Don't be a hero
He hesitates, nervous about it, but then
Yeah
If it's no trouble
Thanks
They walk to her car
Okay
ten years from now, what d'you want to be doing
They walk side by side a moment
He shrugs
Then -- in his open way
don't know
This is pretty good
She glances at him, taking this in, then fumbles a bit with her car keys, and he asks -- nervously again
() 31
: Can you drive okay
She gets a little defensive
'm not drunk
You think 'm drunk
'm not
You'll know 'm drunk when 'm throwing up, and never throw up, so don't worry about it
He nods, looks at her dead-on a moment
The only time  worry is when people tell me not to worry
Get in the car, will you
- As they get in and she  the
'm on Lundy Street, just off Pico
They drive a while
She notices his anxiety
He grips the armrest when she speeds up
'm good at this
Streets are wet
Are you one of those people who drive ten miles an hour in the rain
hate that
never drive
She glances at him, and he notices her glance
'll be alright
() 32
: He's forcing himself to relax
He takes a deep breath, sitting back in his seat
He watches her as she drives
After a moment
'know,  can picture you in Colorado
Oh yeah
What am  doing there
Driving around
pissed off
She smiles in spite of herself, slows down
'm not pissed off at you
Give me some time
Now she laughs
She drives, not to his building, but to her own street
She parks, takes a deep breath
This sounds a bit hard-bitten because she's using her toughness to cover
Those guys  in the bar are my friends --  sort of
We work together,  we tell jokes and we bullshit,  but  can't say to them
She halts
What
She says this clipped and fast and even tougher: Every time  close my eyes,  see that goddamn gun pointing at me and  don't know why 'm telling you unless it's because you were there and because  had three drinks, but 'm not ready to go inside and close my eyes and don't want to go to your place and don't want to keep driving around, so what the hell do we do
() 33
: Whew
feel like we're boxing, and you've got me on the ropes
(pause) We'll do whatever you want
What  want  is to know how you happened to  be walking by that parking lot  at that minute
What if you hadn' t been there
For a moment, she shows her fear
guess we were supposed to meet
They stare a while, then she opens her door
If you want -- you can come in for a minute
'  - As they walk in, she moves into the kitchen
Want a drink
No thanks
She pours one for herself while he looks about
It's a stiff drink
Now that he's here, her -don't-want-to- make-a-fool-of-myself alarm is on
She flops on the sofa, watches him
Sit down or something
'm circling awhile
He's looking around at the clutter of her life -- the intimate details
You're not supposed to look around
didn't have time to straighten up
() 34
: So
it's more real this way
It's rude
He turns to her
Now that 'm in here, you seem mad about it
'm not mad
You'll know when 'm mad
don't usually let somebody in here, but here you are
That's all
Let's talk about something stupid
You first
She smiles in spite of herself
Okay -- one thing  don't believe is that 'supposed to' business
We were 'supposed to' meet
That sounds a little fringy to me, like something you might hear on public access
You believe that
Some people say we each give off a particular odor -- that can only be detected by one other person's brain
So, we
smell each other
Who says that
have no idea
(as they smile) 'm more in the destiny school, we-met-in-another-life school
Do you believe that
Do you think when we die -- we come back in another form
() 35
: You mean like   a duck
No think dead is   dead
've been thinking about   it all day -- and don't want to   think about it anymore
He looks at her, steps close to her, takes the drink out of her hand, puts it to his lips and drinks it all down
He puts the glass on the table
Why'd you do that
See
Now you're thinking about me
She gets a half smile, assessing him
Her look is direct, and the attraction is there
He feels it, too, and he deflects it, nodding toward a large photomural of snowcapped mountains
Let me guess
Colorado
It's Austria, but  can't picture myself in Austria
'm not good with languages, so  couldn't qualify for the departments over there
She rises and goes to a desk and takes the holstered gun off her ankle
She takes the cuffs off her belt, the mace from her jacket, the shield from her shirt pocket, puts them all in a desk drawer
She takes off her jacket and throws it over a chair
Disarmed, she turns to him
Her look is all wanting and pushing away, almost fierce in her struggle
He sees this
Thanks for
coming up here
Does that mean 'm going
(flustered) No
You don't have to
You okay now
() 36
: Her eyes grow a bit hard, defensive
Oh
You're here as a medic
Is this the mad part
She smiles in spite of herself -- again
He has gotten to her
She wants to fall into this guy, but she's pumping those brakes
They are standing close together
Maybe going is a good idea
Can  come back some time
Why
(shrugs) Must be the smell
That makes her laugh, and her resistance falls away with her surprised laughter, and she puts her hands around the back of his neck
Her touch is electric to him
She is going in for a kiss, and he is retreating
They stare a moment -- and then he suddenly takes her shoulders and lets loose his own longing
It is a hungry and passionate kiss, and in the very midst of it, he breaks off and pulls back, his darkness rushing at him
She is staring, surprised, and he is looking a bit shaken, getting the words out just above a whisper
better go
She doesn't know what to say
The moment hangs
He leaves
Once he closes the door, the breath escapes her, and she shakes her head -- feeling like an idiot
She lost control
With a stranger
Oh, God
- Catch leaving Sharon's building in a turmoil of emotions, staring hard at his thoughts -- and he steps into the path of a car
The   to a stop, and the scream of those brakes and white light of the head lamps paralyze Catch, and he sees -- 37
- Headlights suddenly washing into a vehicle he is driving
() This sliver of memory jolts  -- and then another one comes
- coming closer and the scream of brakes from his memory, and all of this is exploded -- () by the angry  shouting at him
What the hell do you think you're doing
Catch is numb -- completely shut down there in the middle of the street
The Driver exits his car and comes toward him, raging
Are you crazy
Catch isn't even aware of him
The man gawks at this -- and now Catch walks off
It is raining
The streets are wet
-   - As Catch continues his walk, he is still a bit shaken -- but when he passes a parked car with the window half open, rain getting in, he hesitates
He can't just walk on
He looks about
He tests the lock
He opens the door, rolls up the window, closes the door, walks on
But a  is just exiting a doorway to the street -- and calls out
Hey
Hey
What did you do
Catch stops and turns in the rain
The Man hurries toward him, upset, angry
() 38
: That's my car
What the hell were you doing
Nothing
just
The Man shoves him
saw you
What did you take out of there
No,  rolled up the window
It's rain
The Man gets in his face, shaky
You take my phone
Hah
He shoves Catch again, and Catch's desperate confusion explodes in a surprising reaction, grabbing the Man's jacket front in one hand and not punching him but quickly slap, slap, slapping him, saying
Hey
Hey
Wake up
Wake up
The Man is now speechless, frozen, terrified, as Catch's eyes hold him with a fierceness -- and a sadness
helped you
(pause) helped you
Catch lets him go, and immediately begins walking away, hunching into the rain, his expression dark and troubled
He gets five steps away and turns
The Man steps back -- but Catch only says
'm sorry
And he walks on
The Man watches him go
'    - Candace, Catch's neighbor, is waiting for the slow, with her son
() 39
: The elevator door opens -- and there is Catch, seated on a newly-bought wicker chair in the elevator with a small table across his lap, other boxes nearby and a long-stemmed rose in his hand, wrapped for giving
Oh
Sorry
He rises and hurriedly gets his purchases off the elevator so the woman and little boy can enter
Shopping day
He smiles at her, a bit less subdued than before as he gets his things into the hall -- and he manages a special look for Tommy, a wink
He frees the elevator; they step inside
As the door starts to close, Catch's face "follows" the sliding door with a funny look for the boy
We hear Tommy laugh as the door closes
Catch carries his new possessions to his apartment
- well-kept older home, well-planted, pretty
woman of nearly 60 is tending the flowers
She hears someone approaching the gate in the wooden fence
She looks up
Sharon is at the gate, in uniform, on her dinner break
The older woman is her , Elaine Pogue
There is an old strain between them, a sadness -- and a nervousness in Elaine
She's a quiet woman
She smiles at her daughter as Sharon comes through the gate
They hug tentatively, a lot of baggage here
Sharon turns to the garden
It's looking great, Mom
(pleased) Thanks, honey
It's the best year ever for the impatiens
The very best
There is a beat of awkward silence
Let's go in
- As they enter
() 40
: It's a bit dark inside, older furniture, lots of keepsake clutter and photos
Sharon is restless in here -- bad memories
Looks the same
Still smells like cigarettes
thought he quit
He's down to six a day
Your hair looks nice
Her Mother touches her hair, self-consciously
She can't help glancing at her daughter in all that gear -- bullet-proof vest under her shirt, radio, cuffs -- and that gun
Are you well
Sharon steps close to the mantel
There is a photo of her there, graduating from the police academy, a professional, not a family shot
She is surprised
guess 'm well
Is this always here
Yes
It's always there
Did Larry tell you  came by where he's working
Is that why you called me
called because we want to invite you to our renewal of vows
It's three weeks from Saturday
Who's 'we
'     You said 'we' want to invite you
The family
Sharon takes that in, still looking about
() 41
: How come you're renewing your vows
It's sort of
a fresh start
Your idea
No
Both of us
It's a way of
having the marriage blessed
Wasn't it blessed before
Her Mother sighs, sad for all the trouble between them
Sherry
of course it was blessed
You just
just what, Mom
You just think about the bad, and you never remember the good wish you remembered the good
Sharon stares deeply at her
Sorry
wish  did, too
(then, almost like a child) Does he
Remember any good about me
Of course
He doesn't hate you
He just
still feels hurt
Hurt
hurt him
Being arrested like that
Somebody doesn't forget that
Oh
How come you forgot what he did
() 42
: It wasn't as bad -- you always make it sound worse
And it hasn't been that way for years
'm glad it hasn't been that way
That means it worked, Mom
That was the point
That's why  did it
Christ
Why do  get punished for it
Honey, nobody's punishing you
We're inviting you
Will you come
Of course 'll come
We didn't think you'd want to
Why not
Now her Mother shows a trace of fear
She says gently
We don't want any trouble
on that day
Please
Mom, 'm your daughter
don't want any trouble -- ever
'll come to the ceremony
won't come to argue, and  won't come in uniform
They each get a small, sad smile
It's on the 23rd
Saint Monica's
'd like you to send me an invitation
Mrs
Vander said it's a beautiful invitation
Her Mother starts to leave the room
'll show you
() 43
: Mom
'd like to get one
in the mail
from my family
Okay
Yes
Sharon goes to the door, then stops and turns, letting her guard down all the way to say
Tell Dad
thanks
And she leaves
'  - Sharon is climbing the   outdoor staircase to her apartment, tired after   her shift, drained a bit   by her visit home
When she    reaches her door she sees   that a long-stemmed rose has   been masking-taped to her   door
Written on the masking   tape is: "Catch Lambert"    and a phone number
She pauses, staring at this, gets a little grin
'  -  ( ) Sharon is dressed for bed in a sleep shirt, lying on the bed, surrounded by old photos and a couple of photo albums from her girlhood
In a vase on her bed table is Catch's rose
Sharon is feeling blue, looking at her young self within the family that has shut her out
She closes the book, angry at herself for nearly crying
She sits up and catches sight of the rose and rummages in the drawer and pulls out the tape with Catch's phone number on it
She's very conflicted    about this
She puts the tape down, but it sticks to    her fingers
She tears it off and tries to throw it onto    the table, but it hangsoff her thumb
She sighs and     steels herself and dialsthe number
' He has bought a shelf unit that "needs some assembly" and he's at work with a screwdriver, his new chair and table nearby, the phone on the floor
, and he picks it up
44
As we  the call: Do you have a machine
What
Do you have an answering machine
Yes
Will you hang up please, and 'll call your machine
Why
She hangs up
He stares at the phone a moment, bewildered
He hangs up, and his
He lets it ring
His  comes on with no recording, only a Hi
Maybe we can
have breakfast or something
get up early and run in Ballard Park
There's a Denny's across from the park
Like eight or so
If you're there, you're there
She hangs up, sighs a heavy one
Oh, God
And she falls back on her bed
' - Catch walks in, glances at the clock
It's 7
He's nervous -- and excited
He takes a seat where he can watch the park, the runners
He waits
'  - She has tossed and turned all night
She is awake, turning to look at her clock-radio
It is 7:14
She raises a hand over it
() 45
: It changes to   7:15 and the
She slams her hand down on   it, cutting it
She lays    back and heaves a sigh   that becomes a moan, sits up   again and picks up the   phone, dials the number on the   tape
Hi, don't pick up
Look,  didn't sleep much and anyway this is a bad idea
was feeling funky last night and 'm all right now so let's just leave it where it's at
Bye
Oh, thanks for the
Bye
She hangs up and lays back down and pounds her head into the pillow and covers herself, even her head, with the sheet
' - Catch is waiting, watching out the window
It's 8:05, until we
: ' - and now it's 8:38, and Catch is still waiting and watching
'  - She is still in bed, under the sheet
Someone begins on her door and she sits up, bleary and frustrated
Damn it
She stumbles out of the bedroom to her door
What
Who
(
) It's me
Oh, Jesus
() 46
: She opens the door
He wears a stern look
She is not apologetic
was just falling asleep
Finally
We made a date
It wasn't a 'date
' Okay, an 'appointment
'      keep my appointments
She gives an exasperated moan and turns to stagger back to bed
He closes the door and follows
called you
called you at seven
get up early
walked there
waited there
Check your messages
She heads for the bed, passing a     mirror, looking at her rumpled self and groaning at the     sight
She climbs into bed and snuggles there and puts     the sheet over her head
He is entering the bedroom
He      carries a Denny's take- out bag
(under the sheet) need more sleep
Come back in a month
Come back
What makes you think 'd come back here
The lump under the sheet says
Then why are you here
() 47
: 'm here to tell you that when you tell someone you're going to be somewhere then that someone rearranges his life and you should be more aware of that and a lot more considerate instead of just
She has come out from under the sheet and is watching him
What's in the bag
What
None of your business
Did you bring some coffee
You think you deserve coffee
What else did you bring
Food
(opening the bag) You definitely don't deserve food
've got coffee, sugar, sweetener, non-dairy
Just black
Black
Thanks
She sits up
He hands her the coffee
She sips, relishing the sip, then studies him
So what kind of life did you rearrange in order to get to Denny's
You never said one word about yourself last night
What d'you do
What's the difference
What's the difference
You're standing in my bedroom
That's the difference
Who are you
() 48
: Somebody who keeps appointments
You're ducking
Don't duck
(then a thought) Oh, shit -- you're married, right
Convinced -- she picks up one of the throw pillows from the bed and tosses it at him
'm not
don't believe you
You don't believe me
Give me back the coffee
No
Give me the coffee
She hands him the coffee
He hits her with the pillow and hands her back the coffee
He has made her smile, but she continues, half teasing now
Oh, God
Oh, wait -- you're involved in some criminal activity, aren't you
Great -- That's all  need
My name is Catch Lambert
don't work
don't commit any crimes
like being with you
We can start from here -- from now
Bullshit
'm
let you in here
'm not going to be some fool
need the details
And  need to start from here
That's ridiculous
Why
() 49
: That's the way it is
Oh
Your rules
My rules
Jesus
Okay
Fine
don't really want to know you anyway
Goodbye
He is conflicted -- but he won't relent
He walks to the door
She stares, waiting
But he never turns around
He walks out
She is mystified, exasperated
She hears her
She puts the coffee on her bed table -- and finds herself staring at that damn rose
She suddenly gets up and begins to dress hurriedly -- with a plan
- Sharon is driving, speeding a bit, getting to Catch's building ahead of him
'  - He approaches his apartment building, unlocks the front door, walks in the entrance area
Now we see, across the street, Sharon exit her car and follow him
- The front door has locked automatically
Outside there is a panel of buzzers and apartment numbers
Sharon hits all the buttons
Somebody  her in
- Sharon enters, looks at the elevators
It's not moving
She goes to the stairs, listens, hears him the stairway
She follows silently
- As Catch reaches his apartment door, unlocks it, opens it and walks in
50
'  - Before he can close the  behind him, it  open wider, startling him -- and Sharon is in the doorway, staring hard at him
(sarcastic) Can  come in
She walks in and closes the door and starts looking around as he says
Yeah
Sure
Come in
Despite his recent "decorating" the apartment is still nearly empty
No books, magazines, photographs, no clutter of life
She glances into the equally sterile kitchen
You live here
Nobody lives here
This place is some kind of front, a scam, a drop -- or what
This is what you told me about -- right
What
Your interrogation
Do  need a lawyer
He has made her look at herself, and take a breath
just don't want to be jerked around
'm not
Then tell me straight out
Who are you
He is silent, and she starts to leave
Moment of truth
What is it you're looking for
() 51
: Your life
don't want any surprises
This is it
sleep here
walk around town
That's all of it
That's all of it
Yeah
Except for you -- the way feel about you
Which is
Surprising
thought it was impossible
thought  was
You thought you were what
Gay
Dead
In a way
'm supposed to understand that
No
Did you ever wonder what 'scratch' meant, when people say, 'we'll start from scratch'
This is scratch
We can start from here
She looks at him, looks at his empty place, his non-life, and back at him again
don't know
just don't know
She breaks off the stare and heads for the door
He watches her go
-  ( ) As Catch charges up the stairs to the wide porch of Mrs
Chu's well-kept home, carrying a grocery bag, head full of his thoughts
52
'  - As Catch enters
She is watching
He does glance into the living room briefly to throw her a quick hello smile, before moving to the kitchen
She   the and begins turning the photos face down as she sends her voice to the kitchen
remember that
That was a smile
- He is putting groceries away as she rolls into the room
He doesn't look at her, tries to be casual, but his thoughts are bubbling out
You know the cop -- the woman cop
She
visited me
Mrs
Chu registers surprise at this, but keeps it covered and casual
Oh
Where did she sit
have a chair now
You're
seeing her
He darkens a bit as he works
She has a lot of questions
She wants to know everything
Of course she does
Everybody does
We could start from today
What's so wrong with that
Tell her
The can in Catch's hand bangs on the cupboard, and he stops, suddenly uptight
() 53
: Tell her what
Mrs
Chu comes closer
Tell her, Catch
Tell somebody
It's been almost two years
(a warning) Nora
Every time  tell somebody, it gets a little bit easier
'm not saying it goes
His next warning is tough and absolute
Nora
She is silenced
The moment hangs
She rolls her chair to him, takes a box of cookies out of his hand, opens the box and eats one, defusing the moment
She nice
He starts to work again
She's tough
She pretty
That doesn't matter
(smiles) She is pretty
She's sort of pissed-off at me
Apologize
For what
() 54
: It doesn't matter
We like it when men apologize
He stares at her a while
'm sorry  yelled at you
She smiles and hands him the box
Have a cookie
See
- Sharon is typing at the computer, dark and dogged in her work
Lieutenant Sanderman is watching her through the glass wall of the watch commander's office
He comes out of the office and moves to where Sharon is typing
Sharon
(typing) Lieutenant
We can see the   computer screen now
Sharon is searching for any prior   record of "Catch Lambert" -- arrests, convictions
She has several "Carl Lamberts" on the screen, even a   "Casper," no Catch
Anything bothering you
Why
What'd  do
Nothing
'm talking about your general attitude lately
Sharon stops typing
She can find nothing
She clears the screen, sighs
My attitude's fine
End of a long day
'm tired
Family matters getting to you
() 55
: Family
Your brother, Larry
What about Larry
You know Nester -- on the Culver City
He went out on a violent domestic dispute yesterday
neighbor called it in
It got a little ugly
No arrest -- a warning
This hits her hard
Larry
Oh Christ
Nester said it's not the first time
Sharon is quiet a while, taking it in, shaken by it
Thanks for telling me
( ) -  ( ) Sharon, not in uniform, is approaching Larry's house
It has a small yard with kids' toys strewn about and a tire- swing
She walks up on the porch and  the
She hears  inside,   , a quick murmuring, low-voice argument, can't make out the words
In a moment, Larry opens the door
Jesus, you're up early
wanted to catch you before you went to work
thought you were on late shifts
don't sleep much
Can  come in
56
'  -   - The place is messy
can be heard --
What's up
Where's Kath
She's busy with Larry Jr
right now
Sharon nods, but then walks past him
'  - As Sharon walks into this toy-strewn room
Larry Jr
is sitting on the floor, watching a small
Kathy is not with him
Sharon kneels beside the boy a moment
Hey, Champ
But he stays focused on the , some darkness, some unsayable worry in his eyes
She picks up a toy car, speaks softly
'know, they call this one a woody 'cause it has wood on the sides
know
Now he looks at her with sad and bottomless eyes
She is hurting for him
Larry is now in the doorway
Sharon kisses the child's head and walks out, passing her brother
Why'd you come by
To see Kathy
As Sharon heads for the master bedroom, Larry takes her arm
She's not feeling good
() 57
: Sharon pulls away from her brother
'll just say hello
- Sharon walks in
Kathy is sitting on the bed, her face badly bruised
They stare
Kathy speaks quietly, her eyes filling
Don't make it worse
It gets worse
He's okay now
He's torn up about it
Don't make him mad
Sharon moves closer
She reaches out, touches Kathy with a comforting touch as the woman turns her bruised face away
When Larry and  were growing up, our mother said that all the time
'Don't make your father mad
' (pause) Has he hit Larry Jr
yet
He never would
Oh
Just you, huh
Larry is in the doorway now, angry
What d'you think you're doing in my house, Shar
In my home
She walks out of the room and he follows her
- She turns on him
You see a pattern here, bro
() 58
: lost my temper
Things got out of hand
It won't
People always say that: ''ve got a temper
' Like it's an excuse
don't need a goddamn lecture
She comes very close to him
You want to hit someone
Next time your 'temper' flares      up, Lar, and you just have to hit      somebody, you go home and hit your      father
You blame everything on him
'm blaming you, you fucking coward
He grabs her shirt hard
You don't come in here
He pushes her into the wall
You don't come in here and call me names
What do you call a man who uses his wife as a punching bag
(pause) Coward
He swings a slap at her
She blocks it and punches him hard in the face, and he crashes down on the floor
Kathy comes running, calling out
Don't hurt her, Lar
() 59
: Kathy sees that it's Larry on his ass
The little boy comes out of his room
There is a surprised moment
Then Kathy picks up the child and takes him back to his room
Larry is sitting up, shaken, his nose bleeding
Sharon goes close to him, rigid with fury
know how it feels, 'cause remember
remember standing between you and Dad and taking the blows for you -- and for what
You turned out to be just like him, you bastard
(pause) And so did
And she leaves the house and  the
'  - She is just returning home after her shift, very tired, drained
She absently turns  the , the
She notices a blinking light on her   and hits the button
(
) bet you feel real proud of yourself, Shar, knocking me down in front of my family
You know what 've got in my hand
've got a Polaroid picture of my busted-up face, and 'm thinking of sending it to your department, to your lieutenant
'm going to turn you in to the police, Shar, and see how you like it
The message ends
She stands there a moment
(quietly) Oh, God
Oh, shit
She sits on the edge of a chair, worried, deep in her thoughts, hitting bottom -- the darkness engulfing her
In a moment, she looks at her desk, walks there, opens a drawer, pulls out that piece of tape with Catch's number on it -- but it is all stuck to itself
She hesitates, then starts to pick it apart when a  at the door makes her jump
She wonders, then, somehow, she knows
She walks to the door
() 60
: It's you, right
She unlocks   and opens the door, stares at Catch, very vulnerable,   on the very edge, her pain and fear over Larry just   under the surface
Catch holds a box of cookies as   an offering
Can you just shut up
Just shut up and listen
didn't say anything
don't want to talk
don't care if you have to play some game and pretend you're a
'angel of mercy' or
whatever
don't care, but  don't want to hear about it
All right
don't want to hear anything
She steps back, allowing him in, and closes the door and turns to him
It's a bad night
He sees her pain and puts his arms around her, pushes through his fear and holds her -- and she lays her head on his chest
He embraces her fully, and the effect on him goes deep, to his core, where there is both pain and longing, but he holds on to her, even rocks her a bit
She sighs
In a moment
This is good
but 'm too tired to stand up anymore
He walks her to the couch and has her sit, and then slowly, gently, he "disarms" her
He lifts her leg, takes the ankle holster and gun off, puts it on the table
He turns her, takes the cuffs off her belt from the middle of her back
He reaches into her pants pocket and removes the Mace
From her shirt pocket he takes her shield
He has her lie down on the couch now, their faces close, eyes locked
They linger
You want to kiss me
() 61
: He looks a little lost, but he nods, helpless
He comes toward her lips -- finally -- but just before they touch, she says, softly
Kiss me someplace 've never been kissed
He's not sure what to do
He begins to look her over -- as if hunting, and she gets a soft smile
He starts slowly toward her ear -- but she shakes her head
Her shirt is out of her belt and her midriff bare, and he starts to move there, but checks her with a look
She shakes her head
He hunts
Her smile deepens a bit
He takes her hand and turns it over, going for the soft flesh on the underside of her forearm, and she closes her eyes
He kisses her there softly, and then again, and then he lavishes kisses from her wrist to the underside of her elbow as she sighs with pleasure and draws up her knees in a kind of sensual glow that is leading them to
No
He stops
She looks at him, a deep look, soft voice
Why do you stop
You always stop
She has a glimpse of his mystery, the old sorrow, the deep pain
He hugs her drawn-up knees, closing his eyes a moment
Then he sits on the couch, puts a pillow on his lap and raises her slightly, lays her head on the pillow
He strokes her hair, her scalp as she closes her eyes and sighs, slowly moving toward sleep
Our slides in here, lush and dreamy as we linger a while, and then -- : '  - Just after dawn
Catch has slept on the couch
He is beginning to awaken now as the first light strikes the windows
The dreamy
Catch's eyes clear, sleep replaced by thought, and he is suddenly shaken by -- - ' -- a sliver of memory
But in this one, he is driving
We see his hands on the wheel
Then his  looks to the side and we see an Asian-American woman seated beside him, attractive, about his age
Her name is Annie
She is saying something to him
We don't hear the words
When the   -- 62
() Catch sits up on the couch, jolted
He gets another sudden -- - glaring through his windshield, blinding him
He gasps, sitting there on the couch, but it's all over
He stands, rattled, and he moves toward Sharon's bedroom
- Sharon is peacefully asleep
He stands over her with troubled eyes, but this slowly changes to a loving look
He bends close to her face
He feels her breath on him
He wants to lie down with her -- but he raises a hand and very gently brushes her cheek
She stirs
He does it again
She sighs a peaceful sigh, opens her eyes
He smiles at her
New day
- Sharon is driving Catch home
They are now on a main boulevard of stores, office buildings
They stop at a light
Both are surprised by a voice calling out from the pedestrians crossing the street
(
) Catch
They look up to see a well-dressed man pausing in the middle of the crosswalk to face their car
He is in his forties, tall, with grey-blond hair
This is He has a small smile and wave for Catch
Sharon is curious, looking at Catch
Catch throws the man a dark look and then turns away, ignoring him, nervous, intense
Catch
(to Sharon) Drive, will you
Pindella is moving toward the car, Sharon watching him, wondering
() 63
: Drive
The light changes
Pindella hurries to the curb as the cars surge forward
Sharon drives slowly, checking the mirror to see Pindella stare after them -- then enter the office building on the corner
Will you get off this street
She makes a turn, glancing at Catch
What
You owe him money
But his dark look persists, and he doesn't answer
Then
If you take a right and stop -- we can walk from here
'd rather walk
He is nervous, being in the car -- and glad to leave it when she pulls over
She watches this, wondering
- Sharon exits the car and locks it, staring at Catch
If you're in trouble
'm not
If you're in trouble with him, maybe  can help
Forget about him
Somebody  used to know
don't want to know him anymore
That's all
Forget about it
Walk with me
She hesitates,    then falls in   beside him as he walks on
They walk along    in silence,   the neighborhood growing more seedy, tougher    as they go
Catch is relaxing now, trying to push it all    away
Sharon    looks around her
() 64
: This is not a great place to walk
like it here
It's fine
work here
It's not fine
What's the problem
Besides the shootings, break-ins, rapes, cart thefts
We've got a loose dog raiding garbage cans, knocking 'em over
Can't catch him
Got somebody blowing a trumpet between midnight and three
Can't find him
As someone approaches them, Catch makes eye contact and smiles a small, friendly smile-in-passing
He gets a brief smile in return
He and Sharon amble on
He does it again
You know everybody here
He nods to another   he's never met
How's it goin'
Goin' uphill, man
Catch and Sharon smile
(to Sharon) You try it
Try what
Go ahead
We need this
Everybody
She has misgivings
young woman is bustling along
Sharon makes eye contact and presents a nervous smile and a nod -- but the woman looks at her sternly and bustles on
() 65
: feel like a jerk
feel like a smiley face
Catch smiles, Sharon frowns, but when an   passes, she gives a small smile
The Man lights up
Mornin'
Catch looks at her
She tries to shrug it off, but can't quite hide her pleasure
Now Catch is pausing as a woman is walking her six-year-old daughter to their parked car
Catch makes eye contact with the girl and does a goofy wave that makes her smile
Sharon smiles, too
As the girl's  is unlocking the car, the girl shyly looks back at Catch for more fun
He does that quick finger trick -- trying to catch his own thumb, and the girl giggles But the Mother is impatient
Go on
The girl gets in
The Mother is about to close the door
She frowns, mean-eyed
Move your arm
The girl slides in further,         and the Mother slams the door
The girl follows her          mother with hurt eyes as she walks around to the driver's         side
Catch has paused to watch this, his eyes gentle         on the girl
The Mother is about to enter the car when         she sees Catch staring
What are you staring at
She feels bad 'cause you yelled at her
What
Who the hell do you think you are
Sharon is uncomfortable
Catch persists, never flinching at the woman's anger
She just needs you to smile at her
() 66
: It's none of your business
Why not smile at her
What's it cost
Who the hell are you to talk to me
Catch's anger is like flint in his eyes
It surprises Sharon
She's upset by this
You're so damn impatient
Get away from me
You're so busy being pissed off, and time is going by
What
It's not her fault
The Woman gets into the car and slams the door
'm calling the police
No
'm calling the police
(turns to Sharon) Hey -- police
The Woman speeds her car away
Sharon gets in Catch's face
Jesus Christ, Catch
Maybe she'll think about it now
() 67
: You had no right to do that
God
You think you know everything
Who the hell are you, some expert on raising kids
The neighborhood angel
Jesus
No
No,  just
some people are walking around blind
That's not your problem
Don't tell me what my problem is
Okay, fine -- you tell me what it is
Maybe it's not my problem
Maybe it's your problem
Maybe you're going around blind
Blind to what
Blind to what's going on around you
Blind to what people need
We're supposed to take care of each other
We're supposed to keep each other safe
That's the way it should be -- if you're not going around blind, like that woman
Or like me, right
What about you
How come you can see
That stops him, the darkness rising
He looks about, trying to contain it
think 'll
walk the rest of the way on my own
Yeah
Fine
() 68
: 'll call you later -- about the hiking
'll be out
She turns and walks away
He is still angry, but sorry to see her go
Shar
wait
Hey
But she   keeps walking, and he watches her walk away
Then he   walks on, upset, mad at himself, trying to pound through   it, walking quickly
He is passing an alley, when he   hears a
He looks in
- He sees a large dog that has just knocked over a garbage can
He and the dog stare
Catch walks into the alley, approaches the big dog, squats down to look the animal in the eye, and begins petting it
The big mutt is now leaning into the petting, and Catch's eyes go deep -- and slowly find their way to a sad smile
- Sharon and Robby    are patrolling in their unit
Robby is driving
Sharon     is watching out the window with a deep- eyed look, a bit    down because of her argument with Catch
She is staring as    she rolls along
' She is watching the people on the street, , for once, just how isolated they are, each in a box, passing without connecting
watching
'  - We've never seen the apartment flooded by sunlight like this, all blinds open
() 69
: We  in the kitchen, staring at the drawer that is now so loaded with toys, it won't shut
Some brightly- painted soldiers are sticking out of the drawer
In the living room there are two chairs now, and more lamps and tables
Our   that the dog from the alley is sitting in the living room, watching Catch -- whom we now see is hanging a picture on the wall -- a mountain scene
He holds the picture in one place, then moves it to another, wondering
His fight with Sharon still colors his mood, but he's working through it
Do we go for
symmetry
Or
more off-center
Japanese
He glances at the dog as he moves the picture
Are you into this
Bob
The dog watches him
'  - It is early evening of the same day, and Sharon is just off shift, out of uniform in her own car, parking on Larry's street and walking to the door
She knocks -- and takes a step back
Larry opens the door, already angry, his nose bandaged, eyes blackened a bit from the blow
don't want you around here
Let's go talk in the yard
They stare
She starts walking back into his darkening front yard, looking over her shoulder
She walks to a tree where the tire swing hangs, waits there
He goes back inside, but leaves the door open
In a moment he reappears, coming outside, closing the door behind him
As they meet by the tire swing
His eyes burn her, hate and pain
You took a swing at me
() 70
: You asked for it -- calling me a coward
You knew 'd swing
You think  look bad now
Look at this
He has a Polaroid photo in his hand, holds it in front of her, dried blood and bad bruising on his face
Nice, huh
Beautiful
The cops'll love this, right
Evidence
Don't you guys love evidence
He puts it in his pocket, and they stare a moment more
You wanted me to swing
She looks away
She nods, speaks softly
'm sorry  hit you so hard
But you're not sorry you hit me
Jesus, Larry, what about Kathy's face
That's not your business
Nobody called you, right
She didn't ask for you to come here
This is my family
You don't get it, 'cause you've got no family
Nobody
So you try to run everybody else's life
Jesus Christ -- get your own life
That's the goddam problem
Get your own goddamn life
Their stare holds, but she is giving way
Okay
'm sorry  came here
'm sorry  hit you
Okay
Okay what
This is very hard for her
() 71
: Don't go to my department, all right
Why the hell not
Larry
Why not
Because the job's all  got
That's what  said, right
No life
She nods, her voice smaller, almost a whisper
That's what you said
He makes her wait, thinking it over
And you won't come around here
You won't call
Ever
In a moment Sharon nods
And  don't want you to come to Mom and Dad's celebration
Her eyes snap to his, surprised
Not the church
Not the party
Stay away
don't want you around
don't want to see you, Shar
After another moment, she nods again -- and he snatches the photo out of his shirt pocket and pushes it against her chest and walks away
The photo falls to the ground
Larry says without turning
Go get a life
and she snaps
() 72
: got a life
The words burst out of her, thick with tears, but she's not crying
Larry stops and turns
How the hell would you know about my life
know
You know nothing about me, because you don't want to know
The family doesn't want to know me
Well, too bad
Sharon's got a life
Sharon's got a boyfriend
Sharon's going hiking in the morning with her boyfriend
She's not sitting alone miserable like you want
Too bad
She reaches down, snatches the Polaroid photo off the ground, walks to her car, enters and slams the door as hard as it is possible to slam it
- Moving through the panorama are two small figures on a hiking trail, traveling uphill on a ridge
, Sharon is pounding along, barely out of breath
She studies the beautiful view, and it helps her
It lifts her
Catch is falling behind, breathing heavily
Hey
Hey
Can you wait up a minute
She waits
He catches up
thought you walked all over the city
() 73
: (gasping) The city is flat
Okay
Can we stop here
Can we examine the view
Have a Milky Way
've burned every calorie  ever had
But she walks on
My favorite lunch spot is another half mile
Up
She smiles and walks on, and he follows, calling out
'm not one of those competitive guys, you know
-  ( ) Sharon is already unpacking their lunch as Catch trudges up and collapses near a stream-fed pond
She hands him a sandwich, but he shakes his head
No thanks
can't eat and have a heart attack at the same time
She smiles again and takes a bite and stares off, and soon enough her dark thoughts come and cover her, and Catch notices
As soon as you get happy, you get sad
'm okay
Everything's code four
Everything's what
Everything's fine
Fine
This isn't fine
know fine
This is something else
Something happened yesterday
() 74
: Yesterday -- you mean you want to hear about it
Sure  do
No kidding
Why
You never talk about yesterday
All my days are the same
He keeps staring, waiting
She is chewing a sandwich, looking at him
Finally, she begins -- with no emotion
Yesterday
Okay
Yesterday we rolled on a 415
Juliette and Sanchez had these four guys against a wall, but they were and definitely unco-op
It got pretty jumpy, but we got them in the car with a couple of bruises and Robby got a sprained wrist, so  did the rest of the shift with a rookie who lost it over a
in Sunset Park, old woman who'd been dead maybe six, seven days, and  usually do all right but the smell got to me, and can still smell her
Then we arrested a prostitute working out of her home, and  carried her little girl out to the social worker, and the kid was holding on real tight and making my shoulder wet and  wanted to punch her rock-head mother, and then shift ended and  had a nice visit with my brother Larry
He is staring at her
He takes her hands, holds them
(softly) 'm sorry
That would make anybody sad
Sorry you asked
() 75
: No
No, you can always tell me
She stares a moment, then speaks with an irony he doesn't pick up on
Well
feel better now
You feel better
feel fine
Great
He takes off his -shirt and begins stripping off his shorts, his underwear
What are you doing
She is surprised, smiling, as he plunges into the pond, her darkness dissipating
Catch
There's no swimming here
And you can't be naked in a state park
He dives under and surfaces again
Take the day off, Pogo
What if a park ranger comes
He dives and surfaces once more
We    him
Take your badge off for once
Don't be such a damn Marine about everything
Just
He stops because she isn't there
He looks about
Then suddenly he sees her, poised on a boulder right above him, in her underwear about to dive
He yelps and gets out of her way, and she dives off the rock in classic, near-professional form, a beautiful, sleek dive
She hits the water just right and surfaces, and they splash and swim and frolic and dunk each other in unabashed play
() 76
: At one point she jumps at him to dunk him, and he catches her
They are in chest-deep water and their faces are close
They pause -- then she goes in for a kiss, but he pulls his head back, avoiding that kiss and says
Someplace 've never been kissed
She smiles, staring, then slowly reaches her hands to his face, gently closes his eyes and is about to kiss him on the closed lids, but she changes her mind and instead puts her lips tenderly on each of the small scars on his face
Then she moves away
He opens his eyes
She walks to the shore, moves to her clothes and starts getting dried and dressed, giving him a soft look
Catch comes to the shore    to dry himself, but as he dresses, Sharon glances    at his body -- and the scarring on his chest and arms
He is troubled about this, avoiding her eyes
Then     he makes a decision
They tell me  was in an accident
Long time ago
Looks like a bad one
don't remember it
She waits -- but he says no more
She continues        to dress, sliding her shorts over her wet underwear       -- but before she puts her shirt on, she turns her back       to take off her wet bra
He glances at her
She looks         over and catches him glancing
They both smile softly, ironically, as they finish dressing
We should be thinking about lunch
We have to pack up
So soon
Some of us have to work
(teasing) You ever work
Yeah
worked
() 77
: Oh
You remember that
Working
She smiles and walks off toward the food
He stares after her, his smile fading into thoughtfulness, memory, as he dresses
- Catch is standing outside, looking in through the large window, searching
His eyes settle on a man, and he stares
The man, about his age, is having coffee and reading the paper
Catch is staring deeply, mustering his courage
He walks into the place
- Catch hesitates, then walks over and stands beside this man until he --   -- looks up
Jack beams with recognition and surprise
Catch -- Jesus
Catch is held back, smiling a bit, but on thin ice here, dipping into his past
How are you
Sit down
Been years
You been out of town
(sitting) 've been around
Jack's smile clouds as memory kicks in
Oh, man, 'm really sorry about what happened
never got a chance to say
Catch, with a steady look, says
We don't need to go there
Jack nods a moment
Okay
All right
So
what d'you want, a coffee
() 78
: want my old job back
(pause) What d'you think
You been workin'
No, but 'm up to speed
(thinks) Well, it's not good with Randal anymore
No
No, he's out of it, but Danny Coley's got something going
Wanna go see 'im
Catch stares, nods
Finish your coffee
-  (  ) In a seedy parking lot, tough part of town, Robby and Sharon are arresting two teenage girls
One of them is leaning on the car as Sharon searches her
Robby stands back with the other (cuffed) girl
Robby is staring at Sharon through this moment -- noting the difference in her, still very professional -- but softer
The girl is upset, near tears
Sharon is gentle in her search
have to check these jacket pockets
What's your name -- Allison
The girl nods, not trusting her voice
need to unsnap this, Allison
'm checking your waistband
You got to Whitney School
St
Mark's
() 79
: Sharon is searching, Robby is noting all this, his eyes appreciating the difference
Lift your arms higher
Got a good basketball team at St
Mark's
You play basketball
-  (  ) Sharon and Robby are still on the job, their unit rolling down a residential street of apartment buildings parked car is  , and Robby halts beside it
Sharon starts making dancing moves to the , sitting there beside Robby, and he stares at her as she grooves, kidding it
Then Robby  the  to get the driver's attention in the parked car
Robby makes a gesture to lower the volume, and the man   his
Robby rolls on, glancing at Sharon
She wears a small smile, checking their beat
What's going on, Pogo
You're not happy or anything
Well, it's a mix, Robby
Life is shit, but 'm dating this great dead guy
She smiles at Robby's look
He says before  came along, he thought he was dead
Sounds better when he says it -- (stops abruptly) Listen
What
Shhh
Sh
Robby stops the unit, rolling the windows down
They hear the   of
The trumpet player
Robby pulls over
() 80
: This time we got his ass
They exit the car and stand in the street, looking up, scanning the dark buildings -- but the sound is hard to track, a   on a skillful
Wow
Got 'im
Look at that moon
They stare at the full moon
In a moment, we hear the sound of  , their   as they turn onto this street, one car speeding ahead to cut off the other and force it to stop
The two male drivers are screaming at each other
Robby shakes his head
Full moon, man
Hey
They run toward the drivers who are exiting their cars to confront each other
One big guy carries a baseball bat
Robby heads off one  while Sharon intercepts the -
This guy's crazy
- This asshole side-swiped me
Are you McGuire
- What
Mark McGuire
- No
Then put that bat away
Put it in your trunk
Now
The man hesitates, then moves toward his trunk
() 81
: never touched his car
- You lying bastard
The man charges, bat in hand, and Sharon makes a flying tackle, bringing him down hard on the street -- and we immediately
: '  -  () as she lies on the bed, on her stomach, her top off, and Catch straddles her, massaging her back and shoulder which are sore from her tackle
Ow
Ow
Sorry
No
That's good
Deeper
(as he works) How heavy was this guy
Like a truck
God
Tractor-trailer
Pickup
Ow
Ow
That's really good
She begins to moan as he digs out the pain
He is fighting against the erotic charge of this, trying to keep it medicinal, but he's got his hands all over her naked back, and she is moaning -- so he stops and takes a breath
better
More oil
He reaches to the bed table and puts oil on his hands, noticing a card that stands open on the tabletop, a very pretty invitation
() 82
: This is pretty
Don't get oil on it
Renewal of vows -- that's great
Is this your parents
Yes
Just put it down
'm not going
Why not
She doesn't answer
He puts it down, comes back to the slow rubbing of her shoulders, her neck
In a moment
If  go, my brother'll hurt    me with the department
got     mad and knocked him down
All     they need is a complaint
Just     leave it alone and keep rubbing
Okay
She moans in pleasure as he rubs, trying to push all other thoughts away
So
he says you can't go
Can't you rub without talking
(then) It's been bad with my family a long time, so the hell with it anyway
If they don't want me there,  don't want to be there
All right
All right
(then, as he works) Bad how
Oh, Jesus
But we see her eyes turn inward toward the old pain and, for once, she shares it
() 83
: My father used to knock us around, all of us
But 'm the one who called the cops -- finally
(pause) They say  turned against the family
Catch works in silence a while, absorbing this, looking at Sharon with more tenderness than ever
In a moment
But
they invited you
You don't know anything about it
So forget it
Well
know about family
Oh, yeah
What about it
It's
a door you don't close
didn't close the door
You're closing it now
Right
Family invites you, you go
Family shows up, you welcome them in
That's family
Oh, sure
What if they don't deserve it
Then you forgive
You have all the answers
No
just
It seems like a chance, doesn't it
chance to make things right
'd take it
Then you tried -- y'know
And it's up to them
() 84
: Sharon is considering his words, but she's also deep in her old pain, defensive, challenging
You close with your family
That hits him, but he keeps rubbing her, gentle now, looking a little lost
He doesn't answer
See
So why should  listen to you
But as he works her back in silence, we see her facing her pain and thinking through it
'  - Just after dawn
Catch is on the couch, stirring in his sleep, in the grip of an unsettling dream
We hear what he hears: the  of his wife, his son, murmurings
We're not sure of the words, even laughter
Catch's eyes snap open, jolted out of sleep, but the  don't stop, and he suddenly sits up
The   as he catches his breath, gulping air
He tries to calm down
In a moment, he rises and moves to Sharon's bedroom
- He comes to the side of the bed and sees that she is asleep
He sits on the bed and studies her, his dark thoughts dissipating as he watches her sleep, his eyes going deep
In a moment he begins to raise a hand to brush her cheek -- the way awakened her before -- but he stops before touching her
Instead, he brings his face close to her and lightly kisses her
She stirs
He kisses her again
She opens her eyes
They stare at each other
She raises a limp hand and touches his face
He begins to come close, slowly, for another kiss
She welcomes it
They kiss on the mouth, very tenderly
They kiss again -- deeper
They kiss again, and she holds him, and he moves fully onto the bed, lying over her and supporting his weight on his elbows and kissing and kissing and letting go for once, hungry for her because she is in his heart now, and she is a salvation, and there is a moment when they both pause and stare clear-eyed, acknowledging what they are doing, and both of them abandon their fear and pain and begin to smile, and they make love that way, smiling, as we slowly
: 85
- The night of that same day finds us at this neighborhoody place with a lot of down-to-earth atmosphere and not a lot of noise, like Harvell's in Santa Monica -- earthy blues and jazz from a small band in a darkish club, small dance floor
We  during this slow number and a few dancing couples, including Sharon and Catch who mostly just hold each other and sway
When their eyes meet, there is a lot of deep pleasure there
The music ends
The small crowd applauds
Couples head back to the tables, but the little band goes right into a more up-tempo but still earthy blues
Sharon stops and pulls Catch back onto the dance floor
He smiles and follows
This number has a driving beat, and, slowly, we watch Sharon drop her inhibitions and become more and more   free out there, and Catch is smiling and wowed by her, and   she laughs, wowing herself, and she keeps going, getting   wild and playful, and it's something to see
We      the joy and abandon
She's earned it
They go a little crazy, happy crazy, and in a while we
: - The blues club is emptying out
It's late
The band is finishing what seems to be its last number, for the last of thinning crowd -- including a tired, happy Sharon and Catch who applaud the end of the number
Catch stares at her
What's your favorite song
He rises -- as if to go to the band with a request
She smiles, spent
Catch, 'm beat
So are they think they're finished
One more
It's a surprise
She watches as he leaves her, walks to the bandstand
He talks to the leader who is the
' From the instrument cases on the floor behind the piano, Catch picks up a trumpet case, opens it
Now Sharon's tired smile is changing to curiosity, wonder
86
As he puts the mouthpiece on the horn, nervous, but excited, too, speaking to the Piano Player
Thanks, Danny
( ) Gonna be good having you back, Catch
Catch comes to the edge of the bandstand, grinning a bit at Sharon, at his surprise for her, nervously fingering the horn
He puts it to his lips
Mouth-open surprise -- and then smiling with the wonder - - and Catch begins to play, closing his eyes and rendering a ballad, like the haunting "
" Sharon's smile slowly fades, replaced by a much deeper look, not only because he is so good, but because he is showing her his heart, his love and even his pain -- more than he can show her any other way
We  as he opens his eyes briefly, watching her, sending her the music, closing his eyes again to fall into the song -- as Sharon's eyes fill at the beauty and sadness of it, and at this look inside her man
We
Then
: - We keep the sound of '  going as he and Sharon exit the club and begin to stroll away, arms around each other
In a moment, he stops
He can't go another step
He has to kiss her
He holds her face and comes in for the kiss, and above the music we hear her say softly
Where 've never been kissed
He stops and stares a moment, then takes her hand and walks her out into the middle of the traffic-less boulevard and there, in the center of the street, kisses her, and she responds, and it is their finest, fullest moment, lifting on the , and it is ironic and prophetic that at its peak they are washed over by the revolving light from a police car and a  that once as they break, staring
() 87
: Oh, God
We  to see Ray and Sanchez in their police unit 20 feet away
Ray uses a small electronic bullhorn to say
Are you in danger there
Go away
was talking to him, Pogo
No thanks, Ray
Everything's code four
Go away
Sharon laughs aloud and walks (with Catch in hand) to the police car, her joy overwhelming any embarrassment
She gestures behind them at the jazz club
See that place
He's going to be playing there every weekend
Catch notes the pride with which she says this
(impressed; to Catch) Oh, yeah
What d'you play
It's music, Ray
You wouldn't like it
She waves and walks off with Catch, arms around each other
The cops watch them go
: '  -  ( ) Sharon is asleep, alone in the tousled bed
- Catch is dressed, putting a leash on Bob, glancing into the bedroom at Sharon
() 88
: There is love in his look, and then a passing question, too, a residue of fear now that their relationship has begun in full -- but it all ends up in a soft smile for her as he walks Bob to the door
He hesitates at the door -- then walks into the kitchen and slides open that drawer of toys, stares at them
-  ( ) Sharon is waking, sleepy
She rises, finds a robe and slips it on, calling out softly for Catch
- Sharon sees that Catch and Bob are gone
She drifts to the window, looks at the day, looks down at the street -- and she sees them
' She sees Catch and Bob on their way into the park across the street from the building
She smiles and moves into the bedroom to dress
-  ( ) Catch is walking Bob in the park, but is also checking for someone, studying the playground
He begins walking toward the swings
- Tommy, Catch's neighbor, is playing in the sand with a metal truck
Catch walks up to Tommy, carrying a bulging plastic bag -- but Tommy's attention is on Bob, and pets the big, friendly dog
- She sits on a bench nearby, watching this, smiling a bit
89
, Catch kneels in the sand, beside the boy, and he spills out the contents of the bag -- action figures, superheroes, soldiers
Tommy goes wide-eyed at the array
Catch is pleased by the boy's reaction
Catch keeps a layer of emotion covered here
You like these
Yeah
Well
They're for you
We can pretend it's your birthday
Tommy stares at him, then back at the toys in delight
Candace is walking toward them, and Catch turns to her
hope you don't mind
They're for me, Mom
Her look of surprise questions him
Yeah
've
kind of been saving them up
For Tommy
He nods
She kneels close to her boy, the toys, pleased but not quite knowing what to say
Well, thank you
Thanks a lot
Catch nods, grins at Tommy who is already at play with the figures
- She has entered the park and witnessed this from a distance
She is angling toward the playground
He watches Tommy at play with the figures, but it's almost too much for him
He touches the boy and rises, smiles and nods at Candace and begins to walk off
90
She hurries her steps to intersect with Catch
, Wow, Tommy -- Look at them all
Did you say thank you
Now Tommy looks up
Catch is moving away with Bob, walking home
Tommy stands up, Candace calls out to stop Catch
Excuse me
But he is walking on, some of the emotion seeping through, not darkness, some old joy welling up
We see, in b
g
, Tommy starts to run after him to say thanks
We now have a convergence of Tommy, Sharon and Catch, who is moving steadily toward the street, crossing a bike path now
is coming on
All in one moment Catch hears the  of the , Tommy calling out "Thank you," and Candace shouting "Be careful
" And Catch goes cold inside and turns quickly and rushes onto the bike path, taking the collision with the bike so Tommy is sure to be safe
Catch and the biker fall hard
Sharon stops -- holding her breath
Tommy watches, wide-eyed, and Candace comes running
Catch is rising, a little sore and soiled
The biker is angry
Goddammit --  saw the kid
Jesus
wasn't even close
But Catch is walking     away with that frozen, numb look, all shut down by his     fear and his memory as Bob trots along beside him and     the Biker comes after him and Tommy and Candace watch him     go and Sharon hurries her steps to catch up
The Biker      reaches Catch first
Wait a minute
Hey
But Catch won't turn to him, walking on -- and the man gets in front of him, raging
() 91
: Why the hell did you cause a wreck
told you --  saw the kid, you idiot
was
Pain and darkness build in Catch's eyes until he says in a quiet, choked voice, right into the Biker's face
One more word, and your life will change forever
The man stops talking, looking at the dead certainty in Catch's eyes
He wants to say more, to save face, but Catch's look holds him like a fist
Sharon has stopped, frozen, watching
The Biker turns away and walks back to his downed bike as Catch moves on
Sharon can hardly believe all of this, following Catch again
, Catch
Catch
It takes a moment for her voice to penetrate, then he quickly turns and sees her approaching
Are you all right
Your elbow's bleeding
But he is tight, nearly frozen, everything held in
What's wrong
He walks away from her, and this shakes her, and she catches up again
Where are you going
Catch -- you're scaring me
Please
But he walks on, desperate, and she gets in his way, faces him
Please, Catch, don't
Can't you talk to me
He turns and walks off, heading for the street
() 92
: Please
Wait
Catch
He has walked into traffic -- not completely unmindful of the cars, but desperate to get away
She watches this, frozen, as
He has to stop in the middle of the street to wait a moment, and he stands there, stricken
As the traffic moves around him and the dog -- a ,  , and he thrown into a storm of
That come sharper and faster than before, bits and pieces of memory outside any order: He is driving, Annie smiles at him, headlights blind him, Annie screams, the little boy in Annie's arms grins at him,  , Annie says something to him, calmly, but he can't hear her, the headlights blind him again and   again, and: () Catch stands there shaken and shut down
Watching him, shocked and frightened for him
She sees the traffic let up, and Catch crosses and walks toward home
She watches him go
-  () As Robby and Sharon's police unit moves along with traffic
In a moment they pull over and park beside an office building
It is the same building the man entered shouting, "Catch
" Sharon watches the building's entrance
After a while
Are you going to tell me why we're sitting outside this building again
Watching for somebody
Tall guy
40s
Grey-blond hair
() 93
: What's it about
It's personal
Fine -- what am  supposed to do
Chill
She watches the building, studying the people who come and go
'  - Catch is at home, still shaken by what happened to him in the park
He reaches for the , punches in a number
It  and Elanora Chu picks up
Catch is deep in his pain
(
) Hello
(softly) Hi
(
) Hi
How are you
Have you been out in this great afternoon
Brenda took me for a walk
She senses the silence on the other end and quiets a bit
(
) Anything wrong
've been
remembering
She is quiet for a moment
(
) Catch
This is good
It's awful
(
) No
No, there's good to remember
() 94
: He doesn't speak, shakes his head
(
) Catch
'll call you
He hangs up, staring at his thoughts
- Sharon is still staking out the office building
Robby is fidgeting
She just keeps watching
When Robby begins to speak, she puts up a hand to stop him, going very still, staring out the window at the man who Catch was afraid of, Richard Pindella
The man enters the building
Sharon gets out of the car, intense
Give me fifteen
And she hurries after the man
- As Sharon enters, sees the man at the elevators
He gets into an elevator, and she just misses him
She watches the elevator indicator
It stops at two
She hurries up the stairs
- As Sharon bangs into a hallway through the stairway door
She looks one way, looks the other way down the long hall, and sees the man just entering a door
She walks to that door
It is marked "private
" She knocks and walks in
- She enters a comfortable office, many shelves, books, couch and chairs, big desk
She hears the man's voice from an anteroom
He's coming toward her
(
) Excuse me -- that's a private entrance
He sees her now, sees the uniform
() 95
: Oh
is there a problem
He's calm, gentle in the eyes
She stares a moment, trying to keep her emotions undercover
'm not sure
Who am  speaking to
'm Dr
Pindella
She takes her time, afraid
What kind of doctor
What is this
Do you know a Catch Lambert
Oh
Yes
Is he in trouble
need to talk to you
He glances at his watch, worried for Catch
Well,  have a patient in five minutes
But  can
Are you a
'm a psychiatrist
And Mr
Lambert
My relationship with Mr
Lambert is confidential
She's dying inside -- but covering, lying, forcing her way into this
() 96
: He's your patient
He's your patient we
know all this
This is police business
'm officer Sharon Pogue --
Look
want to help Mr
Lambert but  can't tell you anything that isn't public record
In general
In general
He's your patient, and he
He's not my patient
He walked away from treatment
That was
nearly a year ago
Why did he walk away
can't discuss that, but if you know how to reach him,  would appreciate being able to talk to him
(desperate) You can help by just   telling me what's in the public   record
It'll take me half a   day to do a search
Can you tell    me
Just
She is unable to play this out as a "cop," her emotions coming through
Pindella sees this
She sits on the edge of a chair and takes a breath, speaks more softly
Can you please tell me what's in the record
He stares a moment, sympathetic -- and realizing
You were with him -- in the car
Your uniform threw me
Are you his friend
She looks at him, nods
() 97
: More
He takes that in, leans back on the desk
can tell you he was in an accident, hospitalized, referred to me as an outpatient
What accident
bus
a city bus hit his vehicle
That was a couple of years ago
It was
an awful thing
His family was in the van
His wife and child
His wife's parents
bus
and a van
Where
On
the freeway
Something is pulling at her memory
Her vision turns inward, and she stops breathing for a moment -- remembering
She was there
And here we get a
- glimpse of the carnage -- what she saw, first on the scene -- with Catch lying there
All the while Pindella is speaking
(
) think so
Yes
Near Santa Monica
On the freeway
He was severely injured but
thrown clear
The others were trapped in the van
() still in shock, looks at Pindella again
Survivors
Only him
don't remember
Remember
() 98
: (quietly) Yes
was there
was there
Pindella stares, then
His wife's mother survived, but
she was paralyzed
She takes a moment, absorbing this
Elanora Chu
She's still in town, believe
Does he
still see her
He used to
don't know
(pause) 'm glad to see
he has someone else who cares about him
know he's running from this
He left all his friends, his home, his whole life
He says
he doesn't remember the accident
He lost a lot of memory
tried to help him with that
He resisted
Walked away
She stares
think he remembers me
Very subdued now, she asks
How does he live
He received a large settlement from the city, but he
barely touches it
He was a professional musician
She stares at him and nods
() 99
: Trumpet
As he says that, we hear our   begin -- a fast and furious  , incredible , and we use this to carry us, as we
: - Sharon is in the report room, using the computer, hunting
We   to see her and the screen
She is searching the police records to find the accident
The    are the motor for this
She suddenly stops as we   the name: "
" Then we watch her as she punches up the data and she reads
: '  - We   Sharon's nearly dark apartment, its stillness in strange contrast to the manic
We  to find her curled in a chair, staring deeply, sadly, drinking a drink
As we , we  she is looking at that mural of the mountains and through this to her thoughts, and then she makes a decision and rises and goes to the phone, punches in a number
'  - He is sitting on his bed, back against the headboard, sitting there fully dressed, shoes and all, knees up -- as he plays his muted trumpet, hard and fast, playing the incredible riffs we've been hearing, playing in a driven way, keeping his demons away
When the  of the breaks through, he stops suddenly
He waits
His and
We  the call as Sharon's voice comes on, subdued
Catch, it's me
Can you pick up
But he sits there, waiting, listening
Why don't we
meet tomorrow
'll be in Westwood
Can you meet me there
Westwood and Cole
About two o'clock
Okay
() 100
: He sits there
He slowly puts the horn down
He reaches for the phone now -- but she hangs up before he picks up the call
: -  - Catch waits on a busy street corner in Westwood Village not far from Santa Monica
He is waiting, glancing over the passing crowds for Sharon
He sees her
She is off duty, out of uniform
He watches her until she spots him
She smiles a little, but there is a mix of fear and sadness in her smile
They walk to each other and stop and hug, but it is brief, and then she keeps walking slowly, and he walks beside her
There is a strain lingering between them
Shar, 'm sorry about yesterday
That's okay
It's hard to explain, but it's
'm okay now
You don't have to explain
He glances at her, wondering, walking along
So
why'd we meet here
So you're the trumpet player who was waking people up -- on my beat
They walk along in silence a moment
used to practice late
outside
On my roof
On your roof
That's why we couldn't find you
() 101
: didn't know it bothered anybody until you mentioned it
You arresting me
They smile nervous smiles
She walks on, leading him somewhere
He looks about, beginning to show some agitation, but covering it
You going to tell me where we're going
(as she doesn't answer) That's okay
mean
'll go anywhere with you, Shar
Jaws of death
The mall on a Saturday
Just about any
He slows his steps, looking across the street and down half a block
We see an ivy-covered brick building there, with a sign that is too far away for us to read
He looks quickly away from that building
She sees his growing agitation
You can trust me, you know
She takes his hand
've got you now
'm holding on -- like before
What d'you mean
Like  held you before
Like did -- at the accident
He suddenly pulls his hand out of hers, shocked, and it shakes her
() 102
: What makes it so
unspeakable, Catch
What makes it like that
He begins to shut down, to grow cold and numb and not hear this
Is it because you were driving
He turns away, closing his eyes
read the reports, and it wasn't your fault
It wasn't
Is it because you survived and they didn't
She puts her hand out for him again
Catch
Please
Hold on, and we'll go in there together
He does not take her hand, so she takes his and walks a few steps toward that building
You can talk to them
You can say goodbye or  love you or whatever
He pulls his hand away again, more violently, a layer of rage over his pain
This is wrong
It's wrong
Why are you doing this
To help you
don't need your help
don't need this
We don't need this -- we're fine
We're not
We're not fine, Catch
Nothing is fine -- no matter how much you pretend
It is as if she's fighting for his life again -- and her own
() 103
: You pretend that nothing happened
You walk all over the city helping people, but you're dying inside
'm not dying
'm not pretending
don't remember don't remember any of it
So leave me alone
What good does it do
It's gone
And 'm all right this way
Why do you have to change it
'm all right
She points at the building across the street
Then walk in there
He can't even look at the place
Walk in there, and 'll walk in with you
Walk in there and say it's real -- what happened is real
Your family died
Don't talk about that
Don't
(breaking down) All right -- you talk about it
You tell me your family died and say yes,  know, 'm sorry, and you say,  loved them
and say, what an awful thing to lose a family
(unravelling) Damn you, Shar
Damn you -- why won't you stop
So you can have a life
have a life
We could have a life
We could get up and go to work and come home to each other and never, never talk about before
We don't need to do that
Why do we need to do that
() 104
: Because it happened
Because it's the truth
'm sorry
'm so sorry it happened, but
Nothing happened
If we say it, then that's the truth, that can be the truth
Say it
Nothing happened
Say it, Shar
Catch -- take my hand
Please
Say it
'm asking you to say it
Her tears come, and she shakes her head
can't
Why not
Because  want it too much want everything with you
want all of you -- not just the part that isn't hiding and running away
Why are   you pushing so hard
Why does it   have to be your way
Why does it   have to be your truth
This is   who  am
This is the way am
Not anymore
It doesn't have to be this way anymore because you're not alone -- because we're the family now
We can be the family
You like to push people, don't you
You just have to push and shove and make it right for you -- for you
You push everybody, Shar
You even pushed your family away, didn't you
() 105
: He has stung her
The tears are in her throat
She has to take a moment, but she pushes through to say quietly
just
want to say
You already said it
You said it all
When you're ready, 'll be there for you
just want to say that
And she turns and walks away
He watches her go, angry, scared and sorry for what he said
He takes a few steps after her, wanting to call out and to stop her
We see him almost call to her
He is coming apart, watching her, needing her so much, but unable to call out
He is shaky
He takes a glance at that building, then away
He stares after Sharon -- but she's out of sight now
He steels himself, then looks across the street again at that building
He is desperately afraid
He stares at the building a long while
He begins to cross the street
He makes fists to keep from shaking
He walks to the entrance
- This is the "Wellston Memorial Chapel and Mausoleum
" The sign is on one of the brick pillars
The iron gate is open
He can't walk in there
He just can't
He walks away quickly, as if escaping
- The new shift    of cops is heading for its cars -- Sharon and Robby, Ray    and Sanchez, others
The mood is relaxed, teasing talk,    but Sharon is way down
She tries to push her mood away    and tough through it
Rib House after shift today
4:30
think 'll head home
() 106
: Pogo
Bring your friend
No,  think 'll turn vegetarian
Gotta have that meat to keep your strength up
How come it's not working for you
There is a scattering of laughter -- almost by rote -- as Sharon enters her car without even the hint of a smile
Robby notices
She just punches up the  monitor, all business
Our   comes in, aching now, and takes us into
'  - She is exercising on the machine, sliding into her crunches, fast and furious, but all the pain and sorrow is in her eyes, and in a moment she just stops
The through this
She looks over at the phone
'  - We   Bob-the-Dog, watching something
We see a few scattered sheets of music lying about, hearing , and we   Catch, seated on the floor, shuffling through a stack of sheet music, driven, looking for something
The
He ignores it
He is opening up each chart of music, shaking it out, searching
Sharon's voice comes on his machine, almost hollow with sorrow
(
) Catch
Can you
pick up
(pause) Will you call me
He keeps searching, seeming to not even    listen
The He shakes the next     music chart and something falls out
He stares at this     piece of paper, picks it up, slowly turns it over
It     is a picture of himself, a man blowing a horn, drawn in    crayon by a four or five-year-old
Catch stares at this     with a depth that goes on forever, as the
107
- Sharon and Robby are rolling to a stop in a strip mall parking lot, exiting their car
No rush
She's still very downbeat
As they walk from the car, he keeps glancing at her, concerned for her
Pogo
She puts up a hand to brush all the words away
She can't talk about it
She pushes through it by doing the work
Which store is it
The little market there
They came through a back window last night
Mostly vandalism
They walk on, but as Sharon reaches the sidewalk, a little child, three years old or so, toddles out the door of a shop
is rattling along, and Sharon makes a grab for the child, taking his arm gently
Whoa
and pulling him to safety as the Skateboarder passes by shouting
Sorry
And now the   is emerging from the shop
Oh, God, thank you
Billy
She picks up her boy, walks back into the shop
Sharon stands there -- as it all blooms inside of her, rocks her, really, this little act, evoking Catch, who he is, what he said and what he means to her
Robby is a few steps ahead, waiting for her, but she can't move yet, looking around her now at the people walking among the shops and cafes
She picks one
She catches the eyes
She gives a brief smile
The smile is answered, shyly, kindly, the person moves on
Pogo
She doesn't move for a moment
Then she turns to Robby
() 108
: There's something  have to do need an address and phone
What's the name
Elanora Chu
Robby looks at her, then nods, giving her this
Let's do it
They walk back to the car
- We see Sharon walking quickly from her police car to the front of Mrs
Chu's home
Robby waits in the unit
- Sharon walks under that covered portico to the front door, but before she rings the bell, a voice startles her a bit
(
) Pogo
Mrs
Chu emerges from the shadows of the portico, rolling her wheelchair toward Sharon
She has a smile for her -- but with some reserve
'm Sharon Pogue
know all about the
Elanora
Sharon nods, very held back
She gestures toward the wheelchair self-consciously
'm sorry for
what happened know about the accident
(hopeful) He told you
() 109
: No
found out, and remembered
was there
Oh
Yes
Sharon stares a moment, begins with some of her tough cover in place, over her emotions
guess he comes here a lot -- to talk to you
He shops for me
Twice a week
Oh
And when he comes here -- he never mentions the past, never talks about the accident
No
And you
let him do that
All this time
Why
It's what he needs
Walking all over the city like
Like an angel
Yes
Sweet man
But
you let him get so lost
Elanora is a bit defensive now
let him find his own way through it
Why did you come here, Sharon
Because
want to know how to help him
You are helping him
() 110
: don't think so
Why not
He
he was paying me back, guess, for the accident, for helping him
That's why he felt
so close to me
But
Is that what you think
But now he probably hates me
What happened
took him to the cemetery, and
The cemetery
Elanora's look darkens and she begins to shake her head in worry
thought it might help him
come back, you know
But he wouldn't even go in
He screamed at me
(upset) What made you take him there
For the truth
He knows the truth
But he won't even say it, or
() 111
: That's his way
That's his way through all this
He made a wall -- around that whole day, that night -- other things, too
He keeps them behind the wall -- his little boy, my daughter
He can't help it
The cemetery
Do you know how hard it is for me to go to the cemetery
Can you imagine
Sharon is shaken by this, realizing, crumbling a bit as Mrs
Chu goes on
That's where it stares you in the face -- the loss
And it's too much sometimes
Elanora takes a breath, acknowledging how upset she is
See
'm still finding my way through it
And Catch -- it almost kills him to think about it or say it or drive a car or see the place where it happened or
go by the cemetery
was trying to help him
come back to some kind of life
But he was coming back
Do you realize how much he changed in the past weeks
His apartment, his life, his music is coming back
He fell in love
He even got a job, Sharon -- for you
For the two of you
Isn't that coming back
Why do you have to rush
Everybody has to rush these days
Sharon, battered by the truth of this, is totally exposed now, realizing, admitting
was scared
push so hard
when 'm scared
Scared of what
() 112
: Losing him
So  did
lost him
He won't talk to me didn't know what  was doing
Elanora sighs, looking at her, and her anger drains away, studying Sharon's misery
You were finding your way
What else can we do
You think    'm always sure what to say to   him, what not to say
do what think is right and hope he   sees the love in it
She shakes her head at Sharon's tears, her warmth showing now, liking this girl
Look at you -- so worried now, so miserable
That's the love in it
Did
make it worse for him
don't know
really don't
But  think he'll see the love in what you did
Sharon stares, without much hope
She puts out her hand to touch Elanora's, to say goodbye
Elanora takes her hand and holds on a moment, staring into the girl, with strength
Sharon nods and walks off, dark and sad
Elanora watches her go
'  - It's the next day, and Sharon is preparing to go to her parents' renewal of vows
She is at the bottom -- with Catch gone from her life -- but she is doing her best to go through with this
We   a table, looking at the invitation and next to that is a wrapped gift
We hear Sharon moving about, see her nervous, half-dressed, speaking to herself
In the b

Very soulful
just came by to
wish you well
To
congratulate you and wish you well
Shit

: She checks the mirror again, doesn't like the look, starts undressing, comes back to the table with the gift on it, wonders if she should add more decoration to the box
She does, and as the trumpet plays on we -- : dressed differently, re-wrapping the gift and then -- : dressed differently, rewrapping it again and then -- : sitting still in a chair, holding the gift on her lap, looking at the clock, nervous, scared, sad
-  ( ) Catch is walking down a commercial street -- no Bob-the- dog, no strolling gait
He is focused, deep-eyed, on a mission of some kind
Our   over this and on into

There is no one else outside the church
The ceremony has already begun
She's planned it that way
She enters the church as the
- As Sharon comes in quietly
The church is not full, but perhaps 50 people sit in the front pews, watching the ceremony at the altar: The priest, Mr
and Mrs
Pogue, altar boys
Sharon moves forward and slips into a pew a few back from the altar
The slight disturbance of people sliding over to let her in causes a few people to glance over
() 114
: One of them is Kathy
They trade a brief, nervous nod
Then Kathy whispers to her husband
She came
We see Larry grow tense and angry
Don't say anything
Think of your parents
Larry doesn't look at Sharon
The little boy, looking fine in a tiny suit and tie, and being bored, leans to look at his aunt
Sharon and Larry, Jr
trade a look
She winks, then settles back in her pew, watches
We get our first   look at Sharon's , Carl Pogue, 62
Standing beside   his wife, a rather big, stolid guy, taken with the moment,   both he and his wife emotional over this
He wears    a hearing aid
The priest is speaking
watching with a mix of feelings as the mass continues and the vows are renewed, the priest reciting the rituals
- The '  from the church plays over this scene, invoking the blessings, saying the prayers of the mass as we watch Catch continuing his mission, slowing his steps now and pausing at the entrance to the Welston Memorial Chapel
He hesitates
We see the price he's paying and the determination
He walks through the gate
- He walks into a courtyard of several small buildings in a garden setting -- all red brick and ivy, fountains and flowers
He is fighting his way through this, moving closer to one of the buildings
He is nearly alone on the chapel grounds, and, as he reaches the sheltered wall of this building, he is alone
() 115
: This is a wall   of bronze vaults within the bricks, and on each vault is   a plaque -- a name
His breath shivers in his body as he   struggles to lift his eyes
Slowly, his gaze comes to   rest on a name: "
" As he stares, the '  from Sharon's church , and we are left with silence
Catch is shaky,
He takes a step closer to the wall, to the name, to them -- and he tries to speak, but can't
He tries again -- his voice intimate, just above a whisper at first
Annie
Chet
don't
want you to think  forgot about you
It's just that
couldn't find you
(pause) woke up, and you were gone
Everything was gone
It all just
disappeared
In one minute
couldn't remember that minute
lost it
It took me so long to find it
think  found it all now
used a calculator
did
figured it out
You know
we get about 1400 minutes a day and so  figured it out was 33 years old and three months and eight days, so it was
've got it here
He fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket
His hand is shaking as he reads a number off the paper
It was minute number 17 million eight hundred ten thousand, two hundred
or so
He puts the paper away
That's the one  lost
And
when  lost that minute,  guess tried to lose it all, all the memories -- because they hurt tried, but
couldn't do it
We -- 116
- to that minute and, for once, we go in order and     play out each piece of it
We see Catch driving the van,      his wife beside him
His son Chet is in back with      his grandparents, Elanora and her husband
The boy      is a bit whiny, pouty
We  the flashback  -- at the grave, struggling through this
Chet
you weren't feeling so good, remember
It was your birthday, and you ate too much
We see   Annie and Catch both glance back toward Chet, and we get   present sound in this  scene as Catch and Annie   both say, "What's the matter
Hm
Aww
" And then Annie   looks out the window and turns to Catch and -- we Catch at the grave, his eyes filling
And, Annie, you said
you said
In the  we see Annie turn to him again, and this time we hear her say, softly
Slow down in the rain, all right
We   Catch at the grave, fighting tears
And  don't know if  slowed down
don't know
hope  did, but
didn't always listen
'm sorry
'm really sorry
Back in the , we see Annie reach around as Elanora hands Chet to her
Then we're  at the grave and  so that we see Catch speaking through his tears and we also see this tender moment played out in the van
You put him on your lap, and he looked at me, and  made a face
Remember
made you smile, Chet
() () 117
: (') And then we all smiled, and it was a great minute
It was
'm really glad
found that minute
No matter what
Catch stares at the grave, in tears, as the rest of that minute now plays out, punishing him
It lasts only about three seconds: a bus out of control, headlights suddenly glaring through the windshield, Catch turning the wheel, ,   -- and then it's over
And Catch has been battered by the memory, and is weeping, but has not looked away
He is still staring at the name of his family, and he is able to say, in a broken voice
won't forget
anymore
love you
He steps forward and puts his hand on the plaque, rests it there
We   this, then in a moment, we
: - The renewal of vows is over, and Sharon is standing in the aisle, nervous and not sure what to do
Guests are up and milling about, many leaving the church
"See you at the house
" "See you at the party
" Etc is setting a group shot at the front of the church
Mr
and Mrs
Pogue, Larry and Kathy and the little boy
All right
The whole family in this one
Just
Out of the milling crowd comes Sharon, taking a breath and braving it, walking up there, speaking quietly
Where do you want me
The Photographer turns to her, wondering
'm the daughter
Oh
Oh, well, how about
() 118
: We see the family shift so that Larry and his family are on one side of the parents
Sharon follows the Photographer's gesture to stand at the other side, beside her Mother
Her Father has not looked at her
The photo is taken
Sharon now turns to her mom and dad
This is difficult, the strain is thick in the air
You both look so great
(nervous) You, too
just wanted to
The Father speaks to her, his voice not hard, but flat, not warm either
No smile
You coming to the party
Sure
He nods, then turns to greet well-wishers
Sharon is left alone by the drifting away of the family, but one old couple greets her, the older woman (Mrs
Vander) wearing her new blue dress, her  beaming beside her
Sherry
Look how nice you look
Big police officer now
Not so big
(to Mrs
Vander) Nice dress
Sharon moves off toward a side exit, trying to catch up with Larry and his family
- As Larry and his family exit -- and Sharon comes out of the church, calling ahead
Larry
() 119
: He starts to just walk on, ignoring her, but Kathy takes the little boy and walks ahead, with a look at Larry, at Sharon
They nod to a few passing guests
Then they're alone
His nose is still bandaged, but less so, anger and betrayal in his eyes
How did you have the guts to walk into a church after breaking your word
have to be here
It's a chance to make things right, and 'm taking it
Why even talk go me
You got what you wanted
You laugh about it
You tell your cop friends how you
You think  talk about it
You think
She stops herself, catching her rush toward the old anger
She goes calmer, deeper, even sad
Here, Lar
She hands him something
It is the Polaroid photo
He looks at it, surprised
They lock eyes
She speaks softly
was invited
'm here
'm going to the party
You do what you want
And she walks off toward the parking lot
- We're in the midst of the party
We see Sharon drifting a bit, a hello here and there
She feels out of place
() 120
: Though the home and yard are thick with people, there is some tension, especially in the core group -- all who know about the estrangement of Sharon
Now and then a nervous glance from her mother is directed at Sharon, or a hostile glance from Larry
Sharon passes the videographer, who is pointing light, camera and microphone at the Vanders -- having them put their good wishes on tape
She smiles, then looks over and sees her Father across the room
He is alone
She steels herself and heads his way
He makes eye contact, then averts his look
She is approaching him, about to speak, when he walks up to some friends and starts joking with them, leaving Sharon hurt, humiliated
Her mother has seen this and comes to her, speaking quietly, nervously
Don't make him talk about
anything today
Mom,  was going to fix his tie
His tie is crooked
She sighs, pushing through her hurt to say
It was a nice ceremony
(worried) Yes
We're running out of chicken, though
Nobody's eating the ham
It's a great party, Mom
You look happy
Some joy is allowed to surface in her Mother's face
Thirty-five years and still in love, huh
Her Mother's look clouds a little, nervous again
You think that's wrong, don't you
Of course not
() 121
: always
feel like apologizing to you
But  love him
know
And then  feel like apologizing to him for loving you
'm the one in the middle
'm the only one in this family who knows how to forgive anybody
And she walks away
Sharon's eyes follow her, surprised and thoughtful
She watches her Mother approach her Father and straighten his crooked tie
Then Kathy is moving toward Sharon
Sharon turns to her and they both speak quietly -- at the same time
You look great
Then they smile sad smiles
Kathy gestures to her face, the faded bruise
Tons of makeup
On Larry, too
They smile wryly again
Sorry about that, but couldn't stand him doing that to you
took it on
Don't worry
'm not your mother
If he tries it again, 'm gone
'm out of there, me and Larry Junior
He knows that
They stare, and Sharon gives her a hug, Kathy returns it
We see Larry, across the room, notice this hug
He keeps his expression intact for the group he's in, but we see a flare of anger in his eyes
122
moving across the living room
She sees Larry Jr
sitting alone and goes to him, sits beside the child -- who looks sad
What's up with you
They won't let me watch
Oh
Well
let's pretend this is It's a show about a party
They look about the room
(as if it's a secret) That man
is really a super hero
Is not
Is too
And so is she
Look
See
Red tights under her dress
Oh-oh, that man gave her a drink with something in it
With what
With stuff to make her sleep
He's a bad guy
The woman sips her drink, and the boy smiles, getting into it
She drank it
Watch
She'll fall down any minute
The boy is suddenly swooped up, lifted away by his father
Larry puts the boy down near the door
Hey, sport, you should go play outside
() 123
: He turns to Sharon
Stay away from my family
Then he turns to the crowd, smiling a smile without humor, speaking loudly
Hey, everybody, keep it down
Somebody might call the police
There is some nervous laughter, people watching them now
Sharon is angry and embarrassed, keeping her voice low
What're you doing
(to crowd) Once the cops leave, we can really party
The crowd around them is all staring now -- as he turns back to Sharon
Why don't you give everybody a break -- and go home
In the hushed tension that follows, a  falls and , and more people quiet down and stare
Sharon looks at her glaring brother, looks at her Mother nervously picking up the broken glass -- no support there
Angry and shaken, she turns to the door
She walks to the door, opens    it, starts to leave, starts to close the door behind her,    and she stops, take takes a breath, battling hard against    the old patterns of hurt and anger
She looks at that     nearly-closed door
She pushes it open and walks back    in
We see a surprised and angry look from Larry, a worried look from her Mother -- but Sharon is moving through the crowd, searching until she sees her Father
She heads toward him
He sees her and walks into the kitchen, avoiding her
She follows him
We see Larry and his Mother exchange an anxious look -- and then move toward the kitchen
- Sharon enters, waits, others are leaving the kitchen, leaving her alone with her dad, but he starts to follow them
() 124
: Don't walk away
Okay
He acts as if he just noticed her
What
She gestures toward his hearing aid
Is it working
Do you need to check it
He absently touches the device
It's fine
Dad
But the kitchen door opens
We hear the party going on out there
Larry and Sharon's Mother enter, her Mother looking at her husband and back to her daughter, very frightened
Larry is raging in a near whisper
What the hell are you doing
Sharon, please
Please
Please what
Will you stop protecting him
You were always protecting him
Don't talk to your father
Don't bother your father
She turns to her dad
'm going to bother you for one minute, Dad
Okay
Can you handle that
Larry advances on her
Just get the hell out
And she turns on him in a fury that halts him
() 125
: This isn't about you, Larry -- or you, either, Mom
This is between me and my father, so leave us alone for one goddam minute
She turns back to her father
How about you, Dad
Do you want me to leave
Up to you
Dad
'm asking
Am  welcome here
Jesus -- you're here, aren't you
What d'you want
want to know
(then, quieting) Do you want me here
Do you love me, Dad
want to know
The question's out, and she's totally exposed now -- and the silence that follows breaks her heart
She nods toward his hearing aid
Her voice is close to a whisper, thick with tears
Do you
need to
check that again
feel like
He can't finish it
What, Dad
You feel like what
feel like  don't have a daughter anymore
She takes the blow and doesn't crumble, only her eyes show the depth of the pain
She speaks quietly, softly
() 126
: Well
you do
It's a shame you're going to miss knowing her
You're going to miss all that
And she leaves, brushing past Larry and her Mother
- Sharon comes out of the kitchen, blinking   back tears
The party goes on around her, oblivious
She stops on her way to the door because she sees the   video crew moving, hunting the next guest -- and she   makes a decision and walks toward them, stops in   the light, faces the camera
'm next
As they roll tape, people turn, gather, watch
Sharon speaks over a torrent of emotions
(to camera) Hi, Mom and Dad
Congratulations
We see her family coming out of the kitchen and walking into this, surprised, stopping still
'know
being in this house reminds me of something
was about ten,  guess, and Larry and were playing aliens -- remember, Lar
We're making a lot  of noise, and Dad comes home from work tired and pissed off
: watching this
Her Mother is near panic, Larry staring hard, Kathy wondering
their reactions during
We're yelling like mad, and Dad bursts into the room and says, what the hell are you doing
And 'm scared
'm really scared
() () 127
: (') And  say, we're playing alien invasion, Dad, and he says, oh, yeah, 'll show you a damn invasion, and he picks me up, picks me up off the floor and throws me on the couch
hit that couch and bounce off, and he grabs Larry and throws him on the couch, and then
then he starts making these monster sounds, and he says, we came to earth to kick ass, and  run at him and jump on him and he tosses me on the couch and then Larry, and we're laughing so hard  almost wet myself, and he keeps tossing us and growling and beeping, and it was
it was great
It was great, and 'm never going to forget that
Never
And  miss that
miss it
So  just
wanted to tell you tanks for that, Dad
Thanks
That's all
(pause) Bye
She hands the microphone back and walks away as the surprised looks, the deep looks of her Father, Mother, Larry and Kathy follow her
She walks to the front door and leaves
- Sharon exits    and starts to walk away
She sees Larry Jr
look up from    his play
He smiles at her
She returns the smile --    it means a lot to her, and she walks on
As she reaches    the gate, she notices something across the street that    halts her
She stops still, surprised and so pleased
Catch is there, waiting near her car, watching her now
- as Sharon walks to him, so glad he's there, needing him -- but still not sure of what he's feeling about her, until she gets close and sees his eyes and the way he opens his arms -- and they embrace, and she holds on tight, eyes closed
() 128
: They break the embrace, still holding on, searching each other's eyes
Sorry, Shar
For what  said
Me, too
In a moment, he gestures toward the Pogue house
Was it bad
They don't like me in there
Then they don't deserve you in there
She stares a moment more, still together
That's a nice thing to say
It's not a thing to say
It's the truth
She can only look away, not wanting to cry
Why do you try so hard not to cry
She stares at him again
Her throat fills with tears, mouth is trembling a bit
She starts quietly, finally, with nothing held back -- but this is not anger as much as mourning
It's not fair
The tears come, and she doesn't fight them, emptying the old, old wound, speaking through her weeping now
The first time we've seen her cry
It's not fair
Things got better for them because of what  did
Things got better, and 'd still do it
'd do it all over again
And it's not fair they shut me out
It's not
() 129
: No
It's not fair
was     19, and didn't know what else    to do didn't know how else    to stop it
It's not fair  don't    have a family anymore
No
It's not, Shar
It's not
He raises his hands to her face, places a palm gently on each cheek, and she covers his hands with her own and closes her eyes
They remain that way awhile
In a moment he lightly kisses her forehead
There is a depth to his words
We're the family, Pogo
She opens her eyes, staring deep into       his
He has said it all -- as it is and as it will be
She smiles a bit through her tears and nods
He puts        an arm around her shoulder and holds her tight against       him as they walk to her car
She puts an arm around his        waist
They reach the car, and she unlocks it, gets in behind the wheel as Catch gets into the passenger seat
- Sharon just sits behind the wheel, still shaky from crying
She puts the key in the ignition, but doesn't move -- no longer sad, but drained now
He watches her
In a moment, he gets out of the car
- Catch comes around to Sharon's window
She rolls the window down, concerned, wondering what he's doing
Is he leaving
But he reaches for her door and opens it and says without a fuss
'll drive
She stares a long moment,    realizing,    but also making no fuss about it as she gets    out of the    car, walks around and enters the passenger    side
They     close the car doors
Catch  the  and    drives them    away
Drives them home
