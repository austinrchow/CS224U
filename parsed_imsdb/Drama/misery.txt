href <b>// --> </b> "" by William Goldman Based on the Novel by Stephen King : that holds a bottle of champagne
The cigarette is unlit
The match is of the kitchen variety
The champagne, unopened, is Dom Perignon
There is only one sound at first: a strong -- --now another sound, sharper--a sudden burst of  as we typing at a table in his hotel suite
It's really a cabin that's part of a lodge
Not an ornate place
Western themed
He is framed by a window looking out at some gorgeous mountains
It's afternoon
The sky is grey
Snow is scattered along the ground
We're out west somewhere
The  grows stronger--there could be a storm
pays no attention to what's going on outside as he continues to type
He's the hero of what follows
Forty-two, he's got a good face, one with a certain mileage to it
We are not, in other words, looking at a virgin
He's been a novelist for eighteen years and for half that time, the most recent half, a remarkably successful one
He pauses for a moment, intently, as if trying to stare a hole in the paper
Now his fingers fly, and there's another burst of
He studies what he's written, then-- : , as he rolls it out of the machine, puts it on the table, prints, in almost childlike letters, these words: : at the rear of the table
He puts this last page on, gets it straight and in order, hoists it up, folds it to his chest, the entire manuscript--hundreds of pages
: , as he holds his book to him
He is, just for a brief moment, moved
: across the room
goes to it, opens it and pulls something out from inside: a battered red leather briefcase
Now he takes his manuscript, carefully opens the briefcase, gently puts the manuscript inside
He closes it, and the way he handles it, he might almost be handling a child
Now he crosses over, opens the champagne, pours himself a single glass, lights the one cigarette with the lone match-- there is a distinct feeling of ritual about this
He inhales deeply, makes a toasting gesture, then drinks, smokes, smiles
, then-- : - --exiting his cabin
He stops, makes a snowball, throws it, hitting a sign
Still got it
He throws a suitcase into the trunk of his '65  and, holding his leather case, he hops into the car and drives away
: that reads "Silver Creek Lodge
" Behind the sign is the hotel itself--old, desolate
Now the '65 Mustang comes out of the garage, guns ahead toward the sign
As "Shotgun" by Jr
Walker and the Allstars starts, he heads off into the mountains
: Gun-metal grey
The clouds seem pregnant with snow
: , driving the Mustang, the battered briefcase on the seat beside him
: Little dainty flakes of snow are suddenly visible
: , going into a curve and : , driving, and as he comes out of the curve, a stunned look hits his face as we : --and here it comes--a mountain storm; it's as if the top has been pulled off the sky and with no warning whatsoever, we're into a blizzard and : , slowing, driving deeper into the mountains
: , squinting ahead, windshield wipers on now
: , rounding another curve, losing traction-- : , a skilled driver, bringing the car easily under control
: Snow is piling up
: driving confidently, carefully
Now he reaches out, ejects the tape, expertly turns it over, pushes it in and, as the  continues, he hums along with it
: Only you can't see it
There's nothing to see  but the unending snow, nothing to hear but the wind which keeps getting wilder
: Inches of snow on the ground now
This is desolate and dangerous
: , driving
: Worse
: , curving sharply, drop ping
sign reads: "Curved Road, Next 13 Miles
" : , coming into view, hitting the curve--no problem-- no problem at all--and then suddenly, there is a very serious problem and as the car skids out of control-- : , doing his best, fighting the conditions and just as it looks like he's got things going his way-- : , swerving down and : , all traction gone and : , helpless and : , skidding, skidding and : as it drops more steeply away and the wind whips the snow across and : starting to spin and : as the car skids off the road, careens down, slams into a tree, bounces off, flips, lands upside down, skids, stops finally, dead
There is still the sound of the , and there is still the music coming from the tape, perhaps the only part of the car left undamaged
Nothing moves inside
There is only the and the
The wind gets louder
: looked at from a distance
The  sounds are only faintly heard
: --
The car is barely visible as the snow begins to cover it
: from outside, and we're close to it now, with the snow coming down ever harder--already bits of the car are covered in white
He's inside and doing his best to fight is, but his consciousness is going
He tries to keep his eyes open but they're slits
Slowly, he manages to reach out with his left arm for his briefcase-- --and he clutches it to his battered body
The  continues on
But  is far from listening
His eyes flutter, flutter again
Now they're starting to close
The man is dying
Motionless, he still clutches the battered briefcase
Then-- : The  in Paul's hands as he sits at a desk
(
) What's that
We are in New York City in the office of Paul's literary agent,
The walls of the large room are absolutely crammed with book and movie posters, in English and all other kinds of other languages, all of them featuring the character of  , a perfectly beautiful woman
Misery's Challenge, Misery's Triumph--eight of them
All written by Paul Sheldon
: , lifting up the battered briefcase--maybe when new it cost two bucks, but he treats it like gold
An old friend
was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there
Like it was waiting for me
: (searching for a compliment) It's
it's nice, Paul
It's got
character
: When  wrote my first book,  used to carry it around in this while was looking for a publisher
That was a good book, Marcia
was a writer then
You're still a writer
haven't been a writer since  got into the Misery business-- (holding up the cover art of ' ) Not a bad business
This thing would still be growing, too
The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million
Marcia, please
No, no
Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get
You go and kill her
Marcia, you know  started "Misery" on a lark
Do  look like a guy who writes romance novels
Do  sound like Danielle Steel
It was a one- time shot and we got lucky
never meant it to become my life
And if hadn't gotten rid of her now, 'd have ended up writing her forever
(touches his briefcase) For the first time in fifteen years, think 'm really onto something here
'm glad to hear that, Paul,  really am
But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study
(passionately) Marcia, why are you doing this to me
Don't you know 'm scared enough
Don't you think  remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books
You think 'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness
(beat) 'm doing this because  have to
(Marcia is stopped) Now, 'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and  want your good thoughts--because if  can make it work
(beat) might just have something that want on my tombstone
On the word "tombstone" : ' --the upside down car with the blizzard coming gale-force and his motionless body trapped inside the car
The  screams
'  flutter, then close
Hold Keep holding as-- Suddenly there's a new sound as a crowbar  at the door-- -- nd now the door is ripped open as we -  gently beginning to pull  and the case from the car
For a moment, it's hard to tell if it's a man or woman-- --not to let the cat out of the bag or anything, but it is, very much, a woman
Her name is   and she is close to Paul's age
She is in many ways a remarkable creature
Strong, self-sufficient, passionate in her likes and dislikes, loves and hates
: as she cradles him in her arms
Once he's clear of the car, she lays him carefully in the snow : :
She slowly brings her mouth down close to his
Then their lips touch as she forces air inside him
(Their lips touch again
Then--) You hear me--Breathe
said breathe
: , as he starts to breathe-- --in a moment his eyes suddenly open wide, but he's in shock, the eyes see nothing-- : --the moment she sees him come to life, she goes into action, lifting  in a fireman's carry, starting the difficult climb back up the steep hill
As she moves away, she and Paul are obliterated by the white falling snow
: Everything is bled of color
It's all vague-- --we are looking at this from Paul's blurred vision
And throughout this next sequence, there are these , words really, but they make no sense
"
no
worry
be
fine
good care
you
'm your number one fan
" The first thing we see during this is something all white
It takes a moment before we realize it's a ceiling
Now, a white wall
An
bottle is next, the medicine dripping down a tube into '
The other arm is bandaged and in a sling
is standing beside the bed
She wears off-white and seems very much like a nurse
good nurse
She has pills in her hands
: Motionless, dead pale
He has a little beard now
Eyes barely open, he's shaking with fever
(hardly able to whisper) where
am
is quickly by his side
(so gently) Shhh
we're just outside Silver Creek
How long
You've been here two days
You're gonna be okay
(relieved) My name is Annie Wilkes and 'm-- --my number one fan
And now the gibberish words make sense
That's right
'm also a nurse
Here
(Now, as she brings the pills close) Take these
She helps him to swallow, as Paul's eyes close
: It's a farmhouse--we 're in a desolate area with mountains in the background
is set on a knoll so that Paul's room, although on the first floor, is ten feet off the ground
: , in the room
He's not on the
anymore
His fever has broken
Annie enters, pills in her hand
Here
What are they
They're called Novril--they're for your pain
(helps him take them) applies a cool rag to his forehead
Shouldn't  be in a hospital
The  blizzard was too strong couldn't risk trying to get you there
tried calling, but the phone lines are down
tries to test his left arm
(Gently, her fingers go to his eyelids, close them) Now you mustn't tire yourself
You've got to rest, you almost died
: :
Sometimes her face shows the most remarkable compassion
It does now
briefly
: ' (
) Open wide
: ' He lies in bed
His fever is gone, but he's terribly weak
: As she lays the pills on ' , she gives him a glass of water from the nearby bed table
: , swallowing eagerly
: , watching him, sympathetically
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they
(Paul says nothing, but his pain is clear) It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, promise you
Will  be able to walk
Of course you will
And your arm will be fine, too
Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but  finally popped it back in there
(proudly) But what 'm most proud of is the work  did on those legs
Considering what  had around the house,  don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better
And now suddenly she flicks off the blankets, uncovering his body
: , staring, stunned at the bottom half of his body as we : '
From the knees down he resembles an Egyptian mummy--she's splinted them with slim steel rods that look like the hacksawed remains of aluminum crutches and there's taping circling around
From the kness up they're all swollen and throbbing and horribly bruised and discolored
: , lying back, stunned with disbelief
It's not nearly as bad as it looks
You have a compound fracture of the tibia in both legs, and the fibula in the left leg is fractured too could hear the bones moving, so it's best for your legs to remain immobile
And as soon as the roads open, 'll take you to a hospital
: : In the meantime, you've got a lot of recovering to do, and  consider it an honor that you'll do it in my home
on her ecstatic face
Then-- : '
We're back in 's office in New York
The office looks just the same, posters and manuscripts all over
But she doesn't
She holds the phone and she is fidgety, insecure
This is Marcia Sindell calling from New York City
'd like to speak to the Silver Creek Chief of Police or the Sheriff
(
) Which one do you want
Whichever one's not busy
: with a view of the mountains
sits at a desk, by himself, holding the phone
In his sixties, he's still as bright, fast and sassy as he was half-a-lifetime ago
Never mind what his name is, everyone calls him
'm pretty sure they 're both not busy, Ms
Sindell, since they're both me
also happen to be President of the Policeman's Benefit Association, Chairman of the Patrolman's Retirement Fund, and if you need a good fishing guide, you could do a lot worse; call me Buster, everybody does, what can  do for you
: in her office
She pushes the speakerphone, gets up, paces; she's very hesitant when she speaks about Paul
Almost embarrassed-- 'm a literary agent, and  feel like a fool calling you, but  think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble
Paul Sheldon
You mean Paul Sheldon the writer
Yes
He's your client, huh
Yes, he is
: ' He rolls a penny across the back of one hand--he's very good at it, doesn't even look while he does it
People sure like those Misery books
'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books
Yeah,  understand he's been up here the last six weeks
Not quite
just called, and they said he checked out five days ago
Isn't that a little strange
don't know
Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels
: , really embarrassed now
No, no, of course not
It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch
So when there was no word from him
You think he might be missing
(shakes her head) hate that  made this call--tell me 'm being silly
: He nods as a  enters, carrying lunch
It's his wife,
She begins putting the food down on a table for the both of them
Just a little over-protective, maybe
(beat) Tell you what--nothing's been reported out here-- (he puts Paul Sheldon's name with a
on a 3 x 5 ) --but 'll put his name through our system
(he tacks the card to a bulletin board) And if anything turns up, 'll call you right away
: She smiles, a genuine sense of relief
appreciate that
Thanks a lot
: 'bye, Ms
Sindell
As he hangs up-- We actually got a phone call
Busy morning
(smiles) Work, work, work
(gives her a hug) Virginia
When was that blizzard
Four or five days ago
Why
: The penny flies across the back of his hand
He doesn't look at it, stares instead out the window at the mountains
(a beat) no reason
for a moment
: ' ' (soft) guess it was kind of a miracle
you finding me
's soft, sweet laughter is heard
She stands over him, finishing shaving him with a very sharp straight razor
She wears what we will come to know as her regular costume--plain wool skirts, grey cardigan sweaters
No, it wasn't a miracle at all
in a way,  was following you
Following me
concentrates on shaving him with great care; she has wonderful, strong hands
(explaining, normally) Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how 'm your number- one fan and all
Some nights 'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin-- (gently moves his head back, exposing his neck; this next is said with total sincerity, almost awe) and 'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer
Say that last part again,  didn't quite hear-- (smiles) Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck-- (shaving away) Well, the other afternoon  was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and  wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming
didn't know it was going to be a big storm
Lucky for you,  did
(pauses) Lucky for me too
Because now you're alive and you can write more books
Oh, Paul, 've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels
: : know them all by heart, Paul, all eight of them
love them so
: , looking at her
There's something terribly touching about her now
You're very kind
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain
(runs her fingers over his cheek) Like a baby
(smiles) All done
(starts to dab away the last bits of soap) starts cleaning up
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up
have to call my daughter, and  should call New York and let my agent know 'm breathing
It shouldn't be too much longer
(gently) Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time
If you give me their numbers, 'll keep trying them for you
(suddenly almost embarrassed) Could  ask you a favor
(Paul nods) noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and
(hesitant) and  wondered if maybe
(her voice trails off) You want to read it
(quietly) If you wouldn't mind
have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck
(genuinely thrilled) You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me
: His eyes close briefly, he grimaces
: , watching him, concerned
She glances at her watch
Boy, it's like clockwork, the way your pain comes--'ll get you your Novril, Paul
Forgive me for prattling away and making you feel all oogy
She turns and goes out of the room
: , watching her
What's your new book called
don't have a title yet
What's it about
(fast) It's crazy, but  don't really know, mean  haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about
Maybe you can come up with a title
(in the doorway) Oh, like  could do that
: ' Small, neat, one window--outside, snow covers all
,  , are going over books and records
Libby is an old guy, walks with a cane
Nothing unusual about Mr
Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne
Maybe you can, Libby
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go
Then he'd pay up and be out the door
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary
(head shake) don't think Mr
Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary
Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs
Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think
He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul
Sure hope nothing happened to him
So do
'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now
'm sure you're right
But you can tell he's not sure at all as we : : '
He lies in bed
Sun comes in the lone window
sits on the bed, a large bowl of soup in her hands, feeding him
(almost shy about this) know 'm only forty pages into your book, but
She stops, fills the spoon up again
But what
Nothing
No, what is it
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am  to make a criticism to someone like you
can take it, go ahead
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant
Pretty rough so far
(a burst) The swearing, Paul
(beat) There,  said it
The profanity bothers you
It has no nobility
Well, these are slum kids,  was a slum kid, everybody talks like that
: She holds the soup bowl in one hand, the muddy-colored beef barley soup close to spilling
They do not
What do you think  say when  go to the feed store in town
"Now, Wally, give me a bag of that effing pigfeed and ten pounds of that bitchly cow-corn"-- is amused by this
: , almost spilling as she gets more agitated
--and in the bank do  tell Mrs
Bollinger, "Here's one big bastard of a check, give me some of your Christing money
" : , almost laughing as some soup hits the coverlet
(seeing the spill, suddenly upset) There
Look there
See what you made me do
: --his smile disappears
: , and she is just totally embarrassed
Oh, Paul, 'm sorry
'm so sorry
Sometimes  get so worked up
Can you ever forgive me
Here
She hands him his pills and starts to clean the soup off the coverlet
Then she makes the sweetest smile
love you, Paul
(more embarrassed than ever) Your mind
Your creativity--that's all  meant
Flustered, she turns away as we-- : Piles of snow all around but it's been ploughed enough so it's driveable
: coming into view
Up ahead is the sign we've already seen: "Curved Road, Next 13 Miles
" : : Virginia is driving while Buster intently studies the terrain
He reaches for a large thermos, pours some coffee, offers it to her
She shakes her head
He begins to sip it
This sure is fun
She puts her hand on his leg
(removing it) Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff
: Suddenly, it goes into a little icy spin--she fights it back under control
: (suddenly) Stop--stop right here
What
What is it
: , skidding, slowing, stopping
get out, go to the edge of the road
Mountains of snow
Nothing much else visible
Then Buster points
Look at that broken branch there
: , seeing it, unconvinced
Could be the weight of the snow
Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it
Could be a lot of things
He steps off the road, starts down
: , watching him, worried--it's very slippery
: , graceful, in great shape, navigating down easily
: that the car ran into
reaches it, studies it
: , staring out after him--she can't see him because the drop is both too steep and covered with trees and mounds of snow
Anything down there
'  (
) Yeah
An enormous amount of snow
: He's moved away from the tree now, going toward where the Mustang is buried
: with the Mustang inside
: , making his way closer to it, closer, staring around
: Nothing to be seen--everything is covered with mountains of snow
You could have a house down there and not be able to see it
Just glaring white
: , angry, frustrated, turning around and around and : from another angle, from behind the mound with the Mustang inside--and out of his sight, glistening in the sun, a bit of the door protrudes
But, of course, Buster can't see it
, in a sour mood, staring around as the edge of the door continues to glisten
: , on the road as Buster makes his way back up, still ticked
(they move to the car) You really think Sheldon's out there
Hope not--if he is, he's dead
Let's go to the newspaper office
As they get in the car-- --it's Annie in her Jeep--neither she nor Buster notice each other
: ' The door opens and  enters
Oh, 'm sorry
didn't mean to wake you
It's fine
Paul's eyes fluttering awake to see the hardback copy of his novel, Misery's Child, in Annie's hands
She's never been more excited-- They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there
As soon as  saw it,  slammed my money down
got the first copy
Then the roads are open
The one to town is, but that's about it
called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon told him who you were and what had happened
He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you
The phones are working
Well, mine's still out
But the ones in town were working just fine called that agent of yours
(soft now) Oh, Paul,  peeked at the very beginning
(looks at him) What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain
My daughter must be going nuts
it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend
was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago
Your agent said she would tell her you were okay
But 'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself
She starts to leave, stops at the door
(She looks at him now with almost a look of amazement) Oh, Paul, what a poet you are
As she leaves-- : , watching as she enters, moves to him, carrying a tray
made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes
And 'm on page 75
guess that means it's okay
No
No, it isn't, it's-- (halts) --oh pooh,  can't think of any words
Would "great" be insulting
can live with "great
" He starts, with effort, to eat
(as she turns, goes) No, it's not just great, it's perfect, a perfect, perfect thing
: '
- is clearing Paul's tray
She hands him his Novril; he quickly swallows them
'm up to page 185
always get sad when  pass the halfway point
Will you do me a favor
'd love it if you would autograph my copy
already have your autograph on a picture, but it would mean so much to me to get it in person
know you're right- handed, so don't worry if it's not so legible
'll cherish it anyway
As  signs the book: don't mean to pry, but 've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials
And said it can't be true
Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines
knew it
knew it wasn't true
Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe
He finishes the autograph, hands the book back to her
Thank you so much
My pleasure
: -  - : opens and guess what--a sow lumbers in
: , kind of stunned as this female pig skitters its way around the room, excited, confused, slipping and sliding
: , all smiles and happiness, laughing in the doorway
thought it was time you two should meet
Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery
Misery
: , snorting around the room
: , watching it
Yes
told you  was your number- one fan
'm getting to believe you
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me-- (happy) But when  got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so
She's a fine
uh
pig is what she is
(scooping up the pig, holding it tight as she stands by Paul) 'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine
What's the ceiling that dago painted
The Sistine Chapel
Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world
watches as the pig skitters out of the room with in pursuit, happily imitating the pig
Woink
Whoink
Whuh-Whuh-
: staring after them--what the hell was that
: '  is heard softly
When my husband left me
wasn't prepared, it wasn't an easy time
, standing at the window, her back to the room
In bed,  is dealing with a bedpan, peeing
For a while  thought  might go crazy
know how that can be
don't know about you, but what did to get through it was  dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital
did a lot of reading
That was hen  first discovered Misery
She made me so happy
She made me forget all my problems
(She smiles now) 'Course,  suppose you had a little something to do with that too
There is a peeing sound
Yeah, well
He is embarrassed
(She isn't) just kept reading them over and over
know when  finish this one-- and 've only got two chapters to go-- 'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again
'm
(She turns around, moves to the bed) Done
Yeah, thanks
No problem
As she takes the bedpan
Don't get me wrong
'm not against marriage per se
But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly
It boils down to respect
People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more
They have no sense of real commitment
: , attempting to smile
There is not much he can say to this
'd love to stay here and chat, but 'm right at the end and  gotta find out what happens
Well,  hope you like it
Of course 'll like it
Misery's about to have her child
What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl
Ooh, don't tell me
With that, she exits
: : He's been dozing but now his eyes flutter awake as we : It opens and  enters, comes to his bedside
: Hard to see
He squints up as we : : her face is ashen pale
You
you dirty bird
She can't be dead
Misery Chastain cannot be dead
How could you
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive-- (screaming) '
want
And you  her
'
Then who did
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all
(screaming) She slipped away
She slipped away
She didn't just slip away
You did it
You did it
You did it
You did it
You murdered my Misery
And now she has lifted a chair--it's heavy but she's very strong--and she raises it and turns on Paul, and it's high above her head, and  realizes that this might be it, she might shatter him with it, crunch his skull--and that's just what she seems she's about to do--and then she swings it, not against him but against the wall, and it shatters and she's panting from the effort as she turns on him again, her voice surprisingly soft
thought you were good, Paul, but you're not good, you're just another lying old dirty birdie and  don't think  better be around you for awhile
(she crosses to the door, then stops) And don't even think about anybody coming for you, not the doctors, not your agent, not your family--because never called them
Nobody knows you're here
And you better hope nothing happens to me because if die, you die
: , watching as she closes the door behind her
Then there is a     and the sound of the door to his room : , getting in her Cherokee and gunning away
: lies still
He looks around the room and listens for sounds
All he hears are the      in the mountains
After a few beats, he takes a deep breath and then begins his greatest effort of all: to force his body out of bed, to make it move
He's still weak from what he's endured, but that's not the main thing: it's the pain
Any attempt at movement and his legs scream
He sags back, lies there still a moment
Slowly he tries to maneuver his body off the bed
He rolls over onto his stomach, then tries to lower himself onto the floor by moving down head first
His good arm hits the floor, and he is able to hold himself up but, realizing there is no way to get out of bed without causing tremendous pain, he girds himself and flings himself out of bed and comes crashing to the floor
The pain is excruciating
After he regains his composure, he slowly crawls toward the door
He reaches up and tries the handle
It is, in fact, locked
He awkwardly tries to slam up against the door, but it is much too painful and to no avail
He crawls back over to the bed, realizes there's no way to climb back in, then grabs the blanket from the bed, wraps it around himself, and closes his eyes
: '
He sits alone at his desk on the telephone, staring at the Rocky Mountain Gazette spread in front of him
: ' In a prominent spot on the top is what is most likely a book- jacket photo of Paul
Above the picture is the following: "
" is on the phone with Marcia Sindell
No, Ms
Sindell, there's no point in coming up here now
Everything that can be done is
Yes, we're working closely with the state police, and the  has been informed
Right
Right
As soon as we know anything we'll let you know
No, it's no bother
Call anytime
Bye, Ms
Sindell
enters, carrying some files
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges
Nothing after the Silver Creek
(With a glance at his dour face, she indicates the photo) Any calls
Just from his agent
: His eyes flick up to her
An almost imperceptible shake of the head
, then-- They are distorted, and they come into view but briefly, then change into the next distorted face
All kinds-- there is no order to them --young, Oriental, female, male, pretty, sad, black, not so pretty, happy, white, old--what we  is this: "
You've changed my life

We love you

you poor dear thing
" This last was said by Annie, out of focus, and for a moment, she stays that way-- : ,      -- is standing by the bed
It is dusk
She wears a dark blue dress and a hat with a sprig of flowers
Her eyes are bright and vivacious--the fact is, this is the prettiest   has ever looked
What are you doing on the floor
(crossing to the bed) It's my fault
If 'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened
Here, let me help you back in
(She lifts him back into the bed, which causes considerable pain) know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds
There you go
Comfy
(in pain) Perfect
You're such a kidder
have a big surprise for you
But first there's something you must do
don't suppose  could have a little snack while  wait for the surprise
'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first
Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, accept that
It's why  couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver
Now she turns, goes to the doorway, keeping on talking
She is never out of sight
But this time  thought clearly asked God about you and God said " delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way
" Show me the way
Yes
She exits and re-enters wheeling something toward his bed
It's a charcoal barbecue, the kind you use in summer for cooking hamburgers
She holds several items in her arms: a box of Diamond Blue Tip wooden matches, a can of lighter fluid
And most noticeably, Paul's manuscript
: He watches, mute, as she takes off the grill, puts the manuscript into the barbecue itself where the charcoal goes, spritzes it with lighter fluid
The grill is close enough to the bed for him to reach out and drop a match
When  mentioned a snack,  was thinking more along the lines of a cheese and crackers kind of thing
: , looking at him
Paul, this is no time for jokes
You must rid the world of this filth
She hands him the box of kitchen matches
You want me to burn my book
(she nods) Yes
You want me to burn my book
know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best
This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies
There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now
So if you want me to burn it, fine
You're not ridding the world of anything
: , watching him
(quietly) Then light the match, Paul
No big deal
So you've indicated
Do it
: '  are starting to tremble now
He can't do it
know this is the only copy, Paul
When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously
But they did
And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge
You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you
When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split
(pause) God knows you're entitled to it
Oh, Paul
This isn't about money
It's about decency and purity
It's about God's values
You're right
You're right
don't know what  was thinking
'll tell you what
It doesn't have to be published
Nobody ever has to see it
'll just keep it for myself
No one will ever have to know it exists
As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free
think you should light the match, Paul
There is a long silence
doesn't move
Can't you see it's what God wants
She's holding the can of lighter fluid in her hand as she speaks and absentmindedly flicks a few drops of the fluid on the bed
You're so brilliant
would think you'd certainly be able to see that
(More drops fall on the bed) We're put on this earth to help people, Paul
Like 'm trying to help you
watches as the fluid continues to drop on the bed
Please let me help you
: His hands shaking
Almost robot-like, he strikes one
It flames
You're doing the right thing, Paul
: , as Paul's hand appears, drops the match on the fluid-soaked manuscript
For a moment--nothing-- --and then, , the goddamn thing practically explodes and : , staring, dazed, and as the flames leap higher, : , suddenly scared and startled at the heat and the size of the flames and the full baking heat and (crying out) Goodness
: The sound is  as the flames leap up and now charred bits of paper begin floating upward and : , watching, as more bits of paper rise
Goodness--Goodness--Oh, my gracious-- And she starts trying to catch them
: in midair, floating against the gauzy curtain, and for a moment it looks like the curtain will catch fire and : , panicked, racing out of the room, going "Goodness, heavens to Betsy"-- : , and what's left of the book
: , and he cannot take his eyes off the disaster
: , hurrying back in, carrying a big bucket, slopping water as she lifts the bucket
: of the manuscript as the bucket of water is tossed onto it--there's hissing and steam and as the steam clears it all looks now like a log in a brackish pond
Well, isn't that an oogy mess
As she starts to wheel the barbecue out, suddenly there is a new and different sound as we : , head turning toward the window
: taking  a step toward the window, stopping for a moment
The sound we're hearing is a motor
And it's getting louder
Annie goes to the window now, looks toward the sky as we : flying along
: and a  are in the machine
Buster has a pair of binoculars looped around his neck, a map rumpled in his lap
(pointing out) That's the Steadman place up there
(The pilot nods
Buster points again) The only other place up here is the Wilkes farm
Another nod
The  points down
stares through the binoculars
: '  parked in front of her house
: That's no '65 Mustang
There's nothing else out this way--circle on back
As the pilot starts to change direction : at the window, watching, as the helicopter turns, starts off
: , listening as the  sound recedes
: , staring out the window
do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year
People say it has something to do with the ozone layer
What do you think
don't know
Yeah, well, it's a theory
Here's your Novril
(she wheels the barbecue to the door; stops) How does tuna casserole sound for dinner
Great
She exits
takes the two Novril, stares at them, then deliberately tucks them under his mattress
: '
As  is finishing the last of his tuna casserole
There are two Novrils on his tray
We hear strains of These sounds are not surprising
Paul has heard them before
: '
It is much smaller than Paul's and filled with religious bric-a-brac, pictures of Paul Sheldon, and a  on a portable stand
Annie lies in bed, with an open bag of Cheetos resting on her stomach and a big quart-sized plastic bottle of Coke on the nightstand
As she munches away, she is heavily engrossed in her favorite  show, "The Love Connection
" As Chuck Woolery extracts the embarrassing details of a couple's romantic interlude, we : Paul faintly hearing the sounds of the
He has now finished eating
He takes the two Novril from under the mattress
He then undoes the sheet, takes his fork and delicately pokes a hole in the mattress, then stuffs all four pills back into the hole
: Coming up to dawn
: '  slowly opening
: , staring at  the door
: , seen from underneath the bed, being rolled around the foot of the bed
We realize  is in a wheelchair with pushing him
See, isn't this nice
Great
've always wanted to visit the other side of the room
And look what 've got for you
An electric razor so you can shave yourself now
If  knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books
(She hands him some Novril) Now don't josh
This is a very big day for you, Paul
Here
You just sit tight, and 'll set everything up
exits
: , quickly shoving the Novril into the mattress
Set what up
That's the big surprise
Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work
Work
You mean write
What in the world do you think 'd write
Oh, but Paul
(flushed) don't think,  know
Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at-- (beat) --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return
: Stunned
(after a beat) Misery's Return
know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right
: :
In an almost religious fervor
Yes
It will be a book in my honor
For saving your life and nursing you back to health
'll be the first one to read it
(beat) Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world
: You just expect me to whip something off, that it
(nods) expect nothing less than your masterpiece
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation
She rolls him over to a table she has set up by the window
have total confidence in your brilliance--besides, the view will inspire you
: , as the wheelchair approaches it
The sky is innocent of clouds
There's a green forest climbing the flank of the nearest mountain
plot of open ground between the house and the mountain
neat red barn where the livestock stay
Jeep Cherokee, maybe five years old Fisher plow
And no neighbors in sight
This is a desolate place
You just inhale that
'll be right back
: , staring out the window
(calling out) guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much
Don't worry about that
You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work
Great
: in the doorway, carrying reams of typing paper, pencils, pens and sharpener
: , watching her--it's all kind of amazing
She hands him a box of typing paper
got you this expensive paper to type on
: , looking at the paper
It's Corrasable Bond
An idea hits him; he masks it as best he can
(putting the rest of the paper on the table) And  got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n
"  told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie
(embarrassed, blushing) You--fooler
(turns, grabs up pens, pencils, paper) Did  do good
(gesturing to the box of paper) You did great, except there's just one little thing-- can't work with this paper
It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges
Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo
But mine cost the most so  don't see how it could smudge
(quickly taking a sheet of paper, making a pencil mark on it) 'mere, 'll show you
As she approaches, he rubs his thumb over the pencil mark
(looking at it) Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating
thought you'd be interested
'd like you to be in on everything, Annie
Not just the finished book, but how it's written
Thank you for thinking of me
(She can be so charming when she wants) Anything else  can get while 'm in town
Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying
Would you like a tiny tape recorder
Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers
No, just the paper will be fine
(suddenly very agitated) Are you sure
'Cause if you want, 'll bring back the whole store for you
Annie, what's the matter
What's the matter
'll tell you what's the matter
go out of my way for you
do everything to try and make you happy
feed you, clean you,  dress you
And what thanks do  get
"You bought the wrong paper, Annie
can't write on this paper, Annie
" Well, 'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man
With that, she throws the ream of paper in ' , causing considerable pain
: as she slams it shut, locks it, stomps off and : Annie, in a parka, can be seen storming out in the direction where her Cherokee was parked
She gets in and drives off
: He heaves a sigh, reaches out toward his tortured knees, then drops his head
He sees something
: on the floor
: , as he moves toward the bobby pin
Or tries to
It's brutally hard for him
The chair moves half a foot
Stops
Paul strains again
Another half foot
Another
: The
The wheelchair is beside it now
reaches down for it
Can't make it
Tries again
Can't
He takes a deep breath, forces himself to bend, ignoring the pain
The bobby pin is in his hands
: , inserting the bobby pin into the keyhole, beginning to jimmy the lock
: --it makes a --something has caught
: , excited, trying to force the bobby pin and he's doing great--until it slips from his hands, falls to the floor again
(furious) Shit
: Paul reaches for it
The pain has him
He reaches again, involuntarily cries out
But he grabs it, clutches it tight
: Paul is trying to jimmy the lock a second time
No luck
: In wild frustration
You've written how to do this--now do it
: There is a loud  sound
: as Paul turns the knob
The door opens a crack
(amazed) What do you know, it actually works
: , trying to get out of the room--but it's a bitch because in order to get to the lock he had to move the wheelchair up to the door and in order to get out, he's got to maneuver it out of the way of the door and every turn of the chair's wheels is an effort for him
He works at it and works at it, but his energy is failing him
He's pale, perspiring
Finally he succeeds, barely forces his way into the hall
: , in the hallway outside
He looks around for a phone
Doesn't see one
He wheels himself over to the front door, tries it
It's locked from the outside
What a surprise
He looks off into the living room, and
: : , wheeling into the living room
Dark red predominates
It's a musty room
Over the mantel, a photograph of a six- year-old , with her mother and father in front of the family car--a new 1952 Buick
These were happier times
The windows have bars on them
As  begins to wheel as fast as he can toward the phone-- : as  at last grabs for it, gets it, punches the "operator" button-- Operator
(nothing) (wildly frustrated) Shit
He shakes the phone
It's terribly light
He picks it up, turns it over--it's hollow, just a shell of a telephone
He stares at it for a long moment, shaking his head, the disappointment plain
You crazy bitch
He puts the phone back on the table
: Annie exits the store, carrying new paper, hops into her Cherokee and drives off
: , as  enters
He looks around
It's stuffed with heavy, graceless furniture as well as lots of coffee tables covered with knickknacks
As he, with effort, wheels across it-- : shelf of
books
Paul Sheldon book
: , pausing, looking at her collection
The only book on the shelf that isn't his is a large scrapbook
The title on the back reads "My Life
" He glances back at the shelf as he forces his wheelchair across the study, and we : with little ceramic doodads on top
The wheelchair his it, one of the doodads topples--it's a penguin, fragile looking, and as it's about to fall to the floor and shatter-- : , grabbing for it, catching it, putting it back where it was
He continues his slow way across the room and : Out in the hallway, on his way toward the kitchen, notices a door to his right
He wheels over and surprisingly it opens
However, this is not a door to the outside of the house, only a storage pantry
He looks around--nothing but canned goods, potato chips, cereals and large plastic Coke containers, etc
Just as he is about to close the door, he notices an open cardboard box
He opens the flap and sees all kinds of prescription drugs
Among them are a couple of strips of Novril encapsulated in blisters
He grabs them and stuffs them into his sweatpants
Now he closes the pantry door and heads to the kitchen
: As  approaches it
He starts to wheel his way in, but he has trouble
He backs up slightly, wheels forward again-- --but the door is too narrow for the chair to fit through
He pounds his fists on the chair arm, staring as we : It's at the far end of the kitchen leading to the outside
It seems somehow less formidable than the front door did
The windows around the kitchen are barred
: , staring at the kitchen door-- --then without warning, he makes his move, starting to lower himself out of the chair gently to the floor-- --only it doesn't work that way
It's too awkward, he doesn't have the strength to maneuver properly-- --and his body tilts awkwardly out of the chair, slams hard against the hard floor
: , crying out in pain as he lands
He lies there for a moment
Little droplets of sweat are on his forehead now
He is hurting
He closes his eyes, gathering strength-- --and then slowly, very slowly, inch by inch, he moves his body across the floor toward the kitchen door
: It's still a long way away
: , ignoring his pain, his awkwardness, making his body move
: Closer now
: , growing pale, but he won't stop, and now the door is just ahead of him, and with his good arm he reaches out and up and grabs the doorknob-- : Locked solid
: :
The disappointment and anger is plain on his face
His arm drops
He lies still for a moment, panting from his effort
Then-- : , and his eyes are wide for a moment
You can feel his wild excitement, as we Sitting on the counter:      sticking out of a slotted wooden block
They seem to be out of reach, but that doesn't stop him
He starts to crawl over to the counter
: is driving along in her Cherokee
She is heading home
: Now at the counter,  tries to pull himself up with his one good arm, but even though he is able to chin himself up to the top of the counter, he is still unable to reach the knives
He makes a desperate attempt which sends him crashing to the floor
As he starts to force his way up again--from outside there comes a sound--the motor of a car
: ' , driving up to the house
: , throwing himself back to the floor, starting a wild crawl back across the kitchen toward the wheelchair and : ' , getting out of her Jeep and : , crawling, crawling and : ' , walking around to the back of the Jeep and : , scrambling wildly up into his wheelchair, starting to get it turned and : ' , opening the back of the Jeep and lifting out several rectangular boxes of paper and : , straightened out now, forcing the wheelchair to move, and now we're into a race, a crazed life-and-death race and the cuts go fast-- --and  closes the door of the car-- --and  is suddenly stuck, there's no traction on the rug-- -- ow , purchases in hand, starts away from the car for the house-- --and now  is finally moving toward the bedroom
--and  is moving swiftly toward the front door
-- he drops one of the packages of paper
: , still biting down, churning his arms with all the strength he has left
' , aching, start to turn to rubber
: ' , walking quickly across the snow-covered area in front of the house and : as Paul gets through it, shuts it, and attacks the bedroom lock with the bobby pin and : , unlocking the front door of the house and : , as it locks and : , unlocking and : balancing the bundles under her chin as she jiggles the key out of the front door lock and : , soaked
(
) (her voice from the hallway, close and growing closer) Paul, 've got your paper
: He wheels to exactly where he was when she left him
He at last allows himself a sigh of relief
: as the sound of a lock  is heard
Just the kind you asked for
And as the door opens-- : --looking down
Paul's waistband--a half a dozen strips of Novril ominously stick out
As the door swings open, he quickly covers the Novril with this hands
: , in the doorway, a strange look on her face
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing
You know goddamn well what 've been doing--' need my pills
(tenderly, as she starts toward him) Poor dear
Let's get you back in bed and 'll get them for you
(exploding--a real child's tantrum) want my pills
It'll only take a second
want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie-- (She looks at him-- you can't tell if she's buying it or not) --please
: She stares a moment more, then turns, starts for the door
(upset) It just breaks my heart to see you like this
: watching, and the instant she is out the door in the hallway, he stuffs the Novril into his pants
(
) (coming closer) 've done a lot of thinking on the drive
: , entering the room, the Novril in her hand
She is genuinely contrite
and 'm absolutely convinced that the main reason 've never been more popular is because of my temper
You must be so mad at me
The truth now
She hands him the pills
And rolls him over to the bed
Well,  don't  hold grudges
After all, who doesn't let off a little steam once in a while
: putting the pills in his mouth, as she picks him up from the chair and puts him gently down in bed
My genius needs his rest before he writes
She hands him a pad and pencil
Here, in case you think of any ideas
Yeah, well  wouldn't expect too much
Don't be silly
You'll be brilliant
Think of me as your inspiration
: , as  starts to it
have faith in you
(beat) my darling
On that she turns--for the first time, a coquettish look comes to her face
Catch this-- (she throws him a kiss--it's grotesque) --ummmm-wahhhh
: , summoning up all his courage, as he mimes catching it and forces a smile on
She waves, closes the door
The smile dies
He reaches in and pulls the two Novril capsules out of his mouth
Now-- : : flying along
Buster is all bundled up as he stares out, using the binoculars
: reflecting the sun
--we're looking at the part of Paul's Mustang that was revealed by the snow when Buster almost found the car
(to Pilot) Walter, we could be skipping lunch today
: Paul's car being hoisted by chains from the ground and, as it starts to rise up into the afternoon air
-- is there and a bunch of and various   are there--Buster stands with the    watching as the car is hoisted via derrick; the sound of the powerful  lifting the car is enormous and as the car keeps rising higher and higher and  take pictures and stare and : is addressing maybe a dozen
It's very cold
stands slightly away from the group
The presumption must now be that Paul Sheldon is dead
We know he somehow crawled out of his car
But we have been unable to locate his body in the vicinity of the crash
We also know if anyone had found him, they would have taken him to an area hospital
His body is undoubtedly out there buried somewhere in the snow
We'll find him after the first thaw--unless the animals have gotten to him first
(beat) 'll take questions
After the first sentence, a very cold and very unhappy leaves the gathering
: '  as Buster studies it, especially the area by the driver's side where there are still dents visible from Annie's crowbar
moves to him now
They exchange a glance, start walking together toward their car
: , surrounded--people are asking questions, raising hands for attention, and as he answers them-- : , close together, walking toward their car
You don't think he's dead, do you
He might well be
But not the way they say
He didn't crawl out of that car by himself
You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world
That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents
As they drive off

lies in bed listening to the strains of "The Love Connection," coming from upstairs
As Chuck Woolery drones on, Paul is intently involved in folding a piece of paper from his pad
He is making a container of some sort
He finishes, then reaches down and grabs the Novril capsules that he has been stashing in the mattress
Carefully, he opens one and pours it into the palm of his hand
First he smells it--no odor--then he takes a tiny bit on a finger and tastes it--no taste
Then, he takes his paper container and empties the contents of all the pills into it, then places it under the mattress
Now, what to do with the empty capsules
He thinks for a second, then--what the hell--he swallows them
He then places the packet back in the mattress
: The window is visible behind it
From this angle, it almost seems to be staring at , broken "n" and all
tests his wounded arm
He's able to raise it a few inches, but that's it
: is visible heading for the barn, followed by , the pig
For a moment, she stops, turns to look back
(calling out) Don't be nervous-- (beat) --just remember, 'll treasure whatever you do
Now, as she turns again, moves quickly away-- : : He rolls in a piece of paper, types briefly
: ' ,  ' : "Misery's Retur
" By Paul Sheldo for   ie Wilkes
: , studying the paper
He takes it out, starts to roll in a new sheet
: as the new sheet is rolled in
: , staring at the blank page
He takes a deep breath, glances outside, then back to the paper
: : , and now there's a brief light behind his eyes and suddenly he types a burst, stares at what he's written
: and these words: "fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck
" : He closes his eyes briefly, mutters something, kind of nods, opens his eyes, grabs for another piece of paper, rolls it in and starts mechanically to type
: with the words "Chapter Two" and a half paragraph of writing as we in his room
enters, the first pages of manuscript in her hands
It's dusk
'm sorry, Paul
This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again
(totally stunned) What
What happened to "'ll treasure whatever you do
" Paul, it's not worthy of you
Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me
You can leave that in
really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair
--not fair
That's right--when  was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays
(it just comes out) --cliff-hangers-- (suddenly angry) know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials
'm not stupid, you know
(and she's a child again) Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and-- was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered-- (standing up now) --but  didn't cheer,  stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia
-- -- ' --" :
Still in her childhood reverie
Shouting: " ' " They always cheated like that in cliff-- (stops himself) --chapter plays
But not you
Not with my Misery
Remember, Ian did ride for Dr
Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any "experimental blood transfusion" that saved her life
Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there
As she goes-- Look at this, 've got Lizzie Borden for an editor, here
slumps, staring barefully at the typewriter
: : : '
is at the table
He takes the Novril off his breakfast tray, wheels over to the bed, and stuffs them into the mattress
He hears  coming down the hall
He smoothly wheels back to the table
pause
enters to remove the tray
What's the matter, Paul
You haven't written a word
can't write this anymore
Don't be silly
Of course you can
'm telling you,  can't
You can--you have the "gotta"-- The what
The "gotta
" Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine
You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta
" said that
You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page
You know, " 'gotta' know will she live," " 'gotta' know will he catch the killer
" " gotta see how this chapter ends
" You said it
don't usually buy that magazine
only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you
: :
Blinking
(quietly) What about a bee
What
Nothing
: as the piece of paper slides in and the keys start to move
Annie stands there for a moment, then quietly backs out of the room
: It's late afternoon
in the wheelchair watching as  finishes reading
Well, is it fair
Should  keep going
You better
Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma-- : , in a fervor
--and when Gravedigger Wilkes remembered how thirty years earlier, the same thing had happened to Lady Evelyn-Hyde-- (hands clasped) --and then old Dr
Cleary deduced that Misery must be Lady Evelyn-Hyde's long-lost daughter because of the rarity of deadly bee-stings--my heart just leapt
: , watching her
It's as if he had nothing to do with anything she's read as she goes on
've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and  was right
(mumbling  to himself) Yeah, yeah
: ; she touches the pages as if they were gold, rubbing gently with the tips of her fingers
Oh, Paul, can  read each chapter when you finish
can fill in the "n"s
(Paul nods, and she's off again) Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia
have to wait
Will she still love him with that special perfect love
Have to wait
(plead ing) Not even a hint
Paul shakes his head
: , spinning around the room like a happy child
Misery's alive
Misery's alive
Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance
'm going to put on my Liberace records-- (Stops, looks at Paul) --you do like Liberace, don't you
(quickly) Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row
'm going to play my records all day --to inspire you--he's my all-time favorite
And with that, she starts to leave
Annie
She stops at the door
Would you have dinner with me tonight
She can't speak
To celebrate Misery's return couldn't have done it without you
Oh, Paul
It would be an honor
dashes excitedly out of the room
wheels over to the bed, pulls the packet of Novril powder out from the mattress and stuffs it in his pants
The sound of Liberace playing "Tammy" with orchestra and chorus booms in from beyond the door
Jesus Christ
: '
is on the phone
(into phone) No, he's not here
don't know where he went
He never tells me anything anymore
He's probably out having an affair somewhere
Wait a minute think  hear him coming
enters carrying a bagful of books
(to Buster) It's Jim Taylor
He wants to know who you've been having an affair with
: He puts the bag down, shoots Virginia a look and grabs the phone
looks in the bag
Hey, Jim, what's doing
Uh-huh
uh- huh
Jim, we've been over this
If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them
don't like him either, but 'm not going to come over there and tell him to move
Give my best to Denise
Bye
(looking through the books; all paperback Misery novels) Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot
Virginia, 'm flattered you think got that much energy
just figured if  can't find Paul Sheldon, at least  can find out what he wrote about
What do you expect to find
story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm
Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice
: is sitting at a table that Annie has set up with her best china and silverware
It is as romantic as Annie Wilkes gets
enters, carrying a basket of rolls
She sits and serves Paul
hope you like it
It looks wonderful
And so do you
Oh
They eat in awkward silence
Finally: 've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it
My secret is  only use fresh tomatoes, never canned
And to give it that little extra zip,  mix in some Spam with the ground beef
Oh
(pause) You can't get this in a restaurant in New York
After another pause: Annie,  think we should have a toast
toast
Yes, to Misery
Let me pour you some more wine
Paul pours more of the Gallo wine, then raises his glass
To Misery
Wait, let's do this right
Do you have any candles
Oh,  don't know
think so
'll go look
She exits into the kitchen
quickly pulls the packet filled with Novril powder from his pants
He empties it into her glass of wine, stuffs the empty packet back into his pants, talking the whole time: Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair
Oh, you
just picked things up over the years
Well, it certainly says you
You really think so
Absolutely
Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay
just thought it might be nice
re-enters with a candle
Are you kidding
If anyone ever told me that one day 'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house,  woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled
Will this do
It's perfect
She places the candle on the table
With a slight tremor in her hand, she lights the candle
raises his glass
To Misery and Annie Wilkes, who brought her back to life
raises her glass
Oh, Paul, every time  think about it,  get goosebumps
They clink glasses
And with that, her emotions having gotten the best of her, she knocks over the candle
In trying to right the situation, she places her glass back down, and as she reaches for the candle, she knocks over her glass, spilling the wine
(wiping up the spilled wine with her napkin) Oh, God, what have  done
'm so sorry, Paul
ruined your beautiful toast
Will you ever forgive me
Here, let me pour another one
(she does) Can we pretend this never happened
To Misery
To Misery
So they drink their wine
: The snow, although still present, has melted somewhat
And starting now and continuing throughout is this: the sound of typing
: ' , working at his typewriter
: Growing
: '
, in her room
Reading and loving it
: '
sitting in his den reading a Misery novel by the fire
brings him a cup of tea
: '
, the sling off, moving his injured arm
It's more mobile than before
Testing his strength, he uses his arm to remove the page and place it on the pile
He puts in another page and continues to type
: , entering Paul's room, carrying a chapter
Handing him a cup of tea
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written
think you're right
: Bigger
: , out by the barn
She stares in at the house
Framed in the window is , working
She smiles, enters the barn
: '
He stretches but only briefly, then back to his typing
: , cooking happily away, reading a chapter
: ' , arm out of the sling
He manages to lift the typewriter once, sets it back down, puts the sling back on
: '
, bringing a tray of food
think it's so wonderful that Misery would sacrifice her title to take up the cause of her people
That's true nobility
Paul hands her some new pages
As she exits, : ' , in his office reading
He is alone
: '
Annie is reading by the fire
Her pig Misery sits beside her, staring at the pages
: '
His fingers just fly, faster than he's ever typed and : '
Paul, staring and : , growing, growing and : ' : ' , ripping open a new ream of paper
: '
His lips move silently
He's not even aware of it as he nods and
: , line after line being written
: Paul's face at , , and  in rapid succession, ending with : '
Lightning
Giant deep rolls of  as  begins
: being lifted out of frame, then back in, then out again
: '
The pile of manuscript has doubled
Maybe two hundred pages
, with some effort, is pumping the typewriter up and down
Finally, he places it back down and puts his arm back in the sling
: , looking outside breifly
: Worse
The  hit s the roof of the house, hits the window
: , lumbering in--she's never looked like this: She's wearing her slippers and her pink quilted housecoat
Her eyes are without life
Her hair, loose and straggly, hangs around her face
Slowly, like a  robot, she goes to , who looks silently up at her
Here's your pills
She drops them on the table
: , as the pills hit his chest and bounce into his lap
Annie, what is it
: (half turns away, turns back, gestures outside) The rain
sometimes it gives me the blues
: :
And suddenly it's as if she's been turned off, gone lifeless
: , staring at her
No sound but the rain
: , seen straight on
No light in her eyes
When you first came here,  only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon
But now  know  love the rest of him too
As much as Misery loves Ian
(beat) know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and 'm
not a movie star type
You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me
Why would you lose me
The book is almost finished
Your legs are getting better
Soon you'll be able to walk
You'll be wanting to leave
Why would  want to leave
like it here
That's very kind of you, but 'll bet it's not altogether true
It is
She slowly reaches into the pocket of her bathrobe and pulls out a
38 Special
have this gun, and sometimes think about using it
She is absentmindedly clicking the empty gun
better go now
might put bullets in it
Robot-like, she crosses to the door and leaves
As she closes and locks the door-- : , stunned, listening, waiting-- --here is the sound of the front door closing-- --then footsteps on the outside walk-- --the sound of a car door opening and slamming shut
Now comes the  of the motor
: as  drives by, hunched over the wheel
The sound grows fainter, faint
: '
are lying in bed
Buster is reading yet another Misery novel, Misery's Trial
Virginia is also reading
"There is a justice higher than that of man
will be judged by Him
" What
They're hauling Misery into court
That's nice
(mutters under his breath) "There is a justice higher than that of man-- will be judged by Him
" : '
The kitchen  on the counter
: , now using both arms, forcing his body up toward them
This isn't easy, it was a bitch the first time he tried it, but nothing's going to stop him now
He's leaning against the cupboard, using it for balance-- --his balance starts to go but he won't let it as we : ,    grabs the largest one, a fat-handled sharp beauty and : , and you can sense the relief as he begins to lower himself to the floor
: , back in his wheelchair, knife in his lap, carefully opening drawers of little tables, looking inside
He closes them, moves on, unmindful of the rain
Now-- : As before-- --except the "My Life" scrapbook is gone
: , glancing around-- --and there it is, on a coffee table in the living room
Also on the table are a roll of Scotch tape, a pair of scissors, and a copy of Newsweek
Paul wheels toward the table and the book, which is as big as a folio Shakespeare play and as thick as a family Bible
: , opening the book
: , as Paul opens it
It's a newspaper clipping as is almost all of what follows
small article: simply a birth announcement for Anne Marie Wilkes
turns the page
This headline reads: "Investment Banker Carl Wilkes Dies in Freak Fall
" " Nursing Student Dies in Freak Fall
" That's the headline on the next page
Now: "Miss Wilkes is Nursing School Honors Graduate
" Paul turns the page
Manchester, New Hampshire, Union Leader: "Ernest Gonyar, 79, Dies After Long Illness
" Now that phrase seems to be what catches our eye--"after long illness" is from the next article
"Long illness" from the one after that
Then, on the next page, a variation: "Short Illness
" Now we're in Pennsylvania: "New Hospital Staff Announced
" And here come those phrases again on page after page--"After Long Illness
" "After Long Illness
" "After Long Illness
" : , transfixed; he keeps on turning the pages--the states keep changing, moving west
Pennsylvania to Minnesota, Minnesota to North Dakota
And always the clippings reporting deaths and deaths and-- --and now we're in Colorado
"
" And now the dead are young and helpless; babies
More and more of them
(stunned) Holy shit
Then a headline which reads: "      " Next page: "
" Next page: "
" Next page, at last: "
" Then a photo: the front page of the Rocky Mountain Gazette
Annie on the courthouse steps
"   ," under which there is a statement by Annie Wilkes
Paul turns quickly to the next page and a very large headline: "    " just sits there, shaking his head in bewilderment
: , as Paul turns the  page
: , stunned and now we find out why, as we : It's an article from Newsweek magazine, a picture of Paul's car being hauled up out of the snow
Above it this caption: "Presumed Dead--Paul Sheldon
" : Slamming the book shut, putting it back on the coffee table, then quickly turning his wheelchair as we : , steering his wheelchair toward the front door
He tries to position himself for a surprise attack of , but he can't find a way to get close enough
The wheelchair is too cumbersome
He looks around and decides to head back to his room
He is faced with the same problem there--so he struggles into bed and, lying on his back, he rests the knife on his chest and stares up at the ceiling
: ' , hours later
The rain has stopped
: --trying to stay awake
After a few beats, he hears something
It's the sound of a
can be seen flashing through the window grips the knife and hides it under the covers
The sound of a     , then
As the   ,  girds himself for attack , then a couple of
Then silence
Then the  continue down the hall and up the stairs
After a beat, we hear the
Someone is explaining how you can buy millions of dollars of prime real estate with no money down
, allowing himself to relax, slips the knife under the mattress
As the   , Paul lies staring up at the ceiling
: We hear a clap of  and once again the rain pours down
: : --eyes closed
There is another loud which causes Paul to stir and open his eyes
He turns his head and another    is heard, flashes and reveals  standing over his bed
Before he can react, she jabs a needle into his arm, pulls it out and starts out of the room
tries to raise himself, but the power of the drug causes him to collapse, unconscious
: It's stopped raining,  lies asleep
Now, surprisingly, we hear a  we've never heard in the movie before--loud-- for an instant we don't recognize the voice, then we do: It's  talking to his audience on a record going, "Thank you, thank you, what a wonderful thing it is for me to be back with you in Paris
"  stirs and awakens to discover that he is strapped to his bed
He can move his arms, but that's it
: , standing in the room, and she looks very together; her eyes are bright
Too bright
Way too bright
She comes to the foot of his bed
: , groggy from being drugged, tries to clear the cobwebs
(in a soft voice) Paul,  know you've been out
What
You've been out of your room
No,  haven't
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south
don't know what you're talking about
looks up at her--he is totally honest and sincere
As he talks, his hand surreptitiously begins moving toward the mattress edge
: , as she brings the fat-hand led knife out of her skirt pocket
Is this what you're looking for know you've been out twice, Paul
At first,  couldn't figure out how you did it, but last night  found your key
(She holds up the bobby pin) know  left  my scrapbook out, and can imagine what you might be thinking of me
But you see, Paul, it's all okay
: , as she walks slowly back to the foot of the bed
And now a  comes from the foot of the bed
Something is out of sight
: , staring at her; waiting
Last night it came so clear
realize you just need more time
Eventually, you'll come to accept the idea of being here
Paul, do you know about the early days at the Kimberly Diamond Mine
Do you know what they did to the native workers who stole diamonds
Don't worry, they didn't kill them
That would be like junking a Mercedes just because it had a broken spring-- no, if they caught them they had to make sure they could go on working, but they also had to make sure they could never run away
The operation was called hobbling
And with that, she reaches down out of sight and comes up holding a 16-inch piece of 4 x 4 wood
Annie, whatever you're thinking about, don't do it
: She wedges the 4 x 4 firmly between his legs, just above the ankles, secures it and adjusts his feet
Now don't fuss, Paul
Why would  run away
'm a writer, Annie--it's all  am--and 've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you
picks up a sledgehammer
Didn't you
Why would  leave a place where 'm doing my best work
It doesn't make any sense
: , positioning herself to the side of his right ankle
Shh, darling, trust me-- (taking aim at his ankle) It's for the best
She takes the sledgehammer back
Annie, for God's sake, please
As  swings, the sledgehammer makes contact with the ankle
It breaks with a sharp
: :  , shrieking
: , moving to the other side of the bed
Almost done, just one more
And as she breaks the other ankle,  shrieks even louder
: :
God,  love you
: '
He is beyond agony
: For a long moment, nothing
Then
a
After a moment, it begins to become more intrusive and we can tell what it is: a car horn
: and  in her Cherokee,  for another car to get a move on
: , from finger to finger
, sitting by the front window of his office, reading The Rocky Mountain Gazette
He watches idly as  yells out the window to the car in front of her
of the car yells back
Annie yells louder
The Driver guns off, and Annie pulls into the parking space next to the General Store
: , getting out, shaking a fist at the other car, calling out, "You poop
" She enters the store
: , staring straight ahead
Something is gnawing at him
: , in his office, tidying the desk
enters, looks angry
Just leave it, all right
Oh,  like that tone
How many times do  have to tell you-- have a system here
(rooting through a pile of papers) Where the hell is that thing
What thing
That thing
(finding what he's looking for, a 3 x 5 card) Here it is
Right where it's supposed to be
What is it
'm not sure
Maybe nothing
It's good you found it
There's that spice again
As  leaves,  goes back to tidying the desk
: as Buster leaves his car, hurries inside and : , wearing bifocals, sits poring over bound volumes of The Rocky Mountain Gazette
: , frustrated, puts one set of volumes down, picks up another, starts through it, as we : , as the pages turn
--only now they stop moving
: , tense, adjusting his bifocals
: pertaining to Annie Wilkes' murder trial
: which reads, "
" Under a    on the courthouse steps, we see a : "Wilkes told reporters on the courthouse steps, 'There is a higher justice than that of man;  will be judged by Him
'" : He takes the 3 x 5 card out of his pocket
: The --on it is printed the exact quote we just saw in the paper
: , sitting there, staring at the quote
Interesting
, then-- : , carrying a bag of feed, followed by , the sow, comes into view
She slows, smiles, waves-- Hi, Punkin
: , staring out at her
Give us a smile
(Paul gives her the finger
She laughs) Such a kidder
As she exits our view-- : , lifting the typewriter and repeatedly raising it over his head, this time without any difficulty
: enters
The place is empty
It's one of those wonderful spots that stocks pretty much everything in what seems like complete disarray
Buster goes to the coffee urn behind the counter, helps himself
He speaks to the guy who sits behind the counter nearby; these two have known each other forever
Hey, Pete
Buster
Answer me a couple things
If  can
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books
We had a batch
Sold 'em all in three days
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you
Are you kidding
Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy
opens the cash register, drops his coffee money inside, closes the register
Has she been buying any odd things lately
Miz Wilkes
Same old stuff
(beat) --Lest you call paper odd
Newspapers
(mimes typing) No, the typing kind
: : Oh
That kind
Nothing odd about that
He cannot hide his excitement now as we-- : , entering Paul's room
He lies back in the wheelchair, eyes closed
Liberace music playing in the background
From the start, '  is different--strong, he's in control
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again
It's been over a week
don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices
Get the fuck out of here
Don't talk to me like that
(staring at her now) Why, what are you going to do
(spreading his arms wide) Kill me
Take your best shot
(taken aback) Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles
'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer-- (He spreads his legs) Be my guest
(after a beat) That's disgusting
As she exits
: Empty
Hold for a moment--now a car appears around a curve
: is driving fast
: in his room
He sits as before, by the window
He doesn't move
Now he closes his eyes, stretches, sighs as we : , busily making cocoa
: He stops at a mailbox
The name on the box is
Buster turns his car slowly into the driveway by the mailbox
: He yawns, opens his eyes briefly
Closes them
In the distance now, growing more and more visible is Buster's car-- --and now '  go open wide, and he's staring out the window at the car as it keeps on coming, closer, closer and : , looking around
He's driving very slowly, carefully
: Fixating on the window and now it's all going to be all right, everything's going to be all right-- --and then  is on him, hypodermic needle in hand, jabbing it into his arm
He desperately tries to fight her off, but the drug starts to take hold
He tries to grab her by the neck, but she fights him off as she wheels him out of the room, down the hall and towards the cellar door
don't think 'll ever understand you
cook your meals,  tend to you practically twenty-four hours a day, and you continue to fight me
When are we going to develop a sense of trust
opens the cellar door
is all but limp by now
As she picks him up and starts to carry him down the steps-- : pulling up in front of the house
As he gets out of his car-- : placing Paul on the cellar floor and heading up the stairs
is out
: heading up the steps to the front door
: stashing the wheelchair in the hall closet
She crosses to the front door, opens it, revealing
(Gasping) Oh, my
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you
You didn't give me a chance to knock
(all charm) Guess you can tell from my reaction, 'm not all that used to visitors out here
What can  do for you
was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon
(stammering) What do you want to know
Anything you can tell me might help
: The words pour out-- Well, he was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, forty-two years ago, the only child of Franklin and Helene Sheldon, mediocre student, majored in history
: , watching her, surprised
(cutting in) Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information  was after
You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and
know
It's so upsetting
'm his number-one fan
've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down
'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection
(stops suddenly, almost embarrassed) here  am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away haven't invited you in
Please
Thank you
lets  in, closes the door
They linger in front of Paul's door
Buster idly checks out the hallway
'Course you must know about that horrible accident
nods and wanders into the living room
follows
He crosses into the study and checks out a bookcase that contains the complete works of Paul Sheldon
One shelf below contains Annie's infamous scrapbook
Almost killed me, too
prayed when heard the news
got down on my knees and begged for it not to be true
: She's so moved
Buster wanders into the kitchen
You're going to laugh at what 'm about to say, but go ahead,  don't care
(beat) when  was praying, God told me to get ready
: , watching her
This isn't at all what he expected
Get ready for what
: , trying to fight the drug; just his eyes flutter
: and  heading back down the hallway toward Paul's room
To try and be his replacement--he gave so much pleasure to so many people and there's a shortage of pleasure on this planet these days, in case you hadn't noticed
enters Paul's room
follows
God told me, since  was his number- one fan, that  should make up new stories as if  was Paul Sheldon
So, went to town
And  bought a typewriter
And paper to type on
The same kind Paul Sheldon used
And turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio
Would you like to see it
Sure
It's right this way
takes a look in the bathroom
waits for him
It's right here
knew how he wrote, the kinds of words he used, the wonderful stories he told-- (moved) --'ve spent the last four weeks trying to write like Paul Sheldon
(sad shake of the head) But  can't do it right
try and try and  know all the words-- (eyes closed in despair) --but it's just not the same
: He just stands there, watches her
Well
(long pause) maybe it takes time to get the hang of it
(holding up pages from the manuscript) could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think
'm not much of a critic
Well,  just thought--oh, look at me
You'd think 'd never had a house guest before
Would you like something to drink
Sure
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound
Sounds good
As she exits into the kitchen
There's some already made
lingers in Paul's room for a beat, then goes into the hallway
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself
always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else
You got a point there
As Buster moves up the stairs-- : , still fighting the drug
His arm twitches almost involuntarily, grazing the barbecue
: opening the door to Annie's room
He looks around and just as he is about to turn to leave-- : , standing right in front of him
Here you are
heads down the stairs,  follows
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but  don't want to take up any more of your time best be going
But you didn't even taste your cocoa
They cross to the front door
'm sure it's wonderful, but really should be getting back
opens the door
: stirring
: and  at the door
If you don't mind, perhaps  could pay you another visit sometime
'd be delighted
Now that you know the way
With that, she closes the door
We stay with
He stands on the front porch for a beat, thinking, then starts heading down the porch steps
Just as he reaches about halfway down, we     coming from inside the house
: --he has managed to partially fight his way through the drug, and in waking has accidentally knocked over the barbecue
He fights to clear the cobwebs
: Miz Wilkes, are you all right
There is no answer
He quietly moves into the house
Miz Wilkes
Again, no answer
: , still fighting to gain complete consciousness
(weakly) Here
'm down here
Down here
: Hearing Paul's muffled call for help, he tracks the sound to the cellar door
As  continues to call out, Buster looks around, sees no one, and opens the cellar door
The shaft of light from the open door pours down on Paul, who is still lying on the floor
Mr
Sheldon
But before Paul can answer, there's the sound of a Seemingly from nowhere a hole is ripped through Buster's chest, knocking him out of frame, revealing Annie, smoking shotgun in hand, standing at the top of the cellar steps
Don't feel bad, Paul
It had to happen
've been waiting for this sign
walks toward '  and very casually takes his gun out of its holster
've known for some time why  was chosen to save you
You and  were meant to be together forever
But now our time in this world must end
But don't worry, Paul
've already prepared for what must be done put two bullets in my gun, one for you and one for me
Oh, darling, it will be so beautiful
With that,  turns and exits the cellar
Paul's mind races desperately
He looks at the barbecue again
Next to it is a messy table with a dozen jars and cans on it
: One of the cans is
: He stares at it for a moment
An idea hits him-- --now,  struggles and crawls over to the table
He grabs the lighter fluid in his hands, jams it into the rear of his pants and scrambles back to where  left him
: returning with her
38 Special and a hypodermic needle
She stops at the top of the stairs
Now don't be afraid
love you
She starts toward him
know you do
love you too, Annie
(this stops her) And you're right
We are meant to be together
And  know we must die
But it must be so that Misery can live
We have the power to give Misery eternal life
We must finish the book
But the time is now
Soon others will come
It's almost done
By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world
stares at Paul
She could go either way on this
Then, without a word, she turns and goes back up the stairs
Here, Paul
'll fix you something to eat
She exits
hesitates for a moment, then realizes he has no choice
He starts dragging himself over  and up the stairs
: '
working
Typing like a madman, totally concentrated on the white paper
His lips move but he's not even aware of it
enters quietly, holding a few pages
Oh, Paul
It's beautiful
Three more chapters to go
She looks at him now, enthralled
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past
Maybe
This is so exciting
It's Windthorne, her first love, right
Maybe
Are you ready for the next chapter
He taunts her with it
(brimming with enthusiasm) Oh you
She takes the pages and goes
: '
types a moment then rips out the page and starts over
: , putting the coffee down for him, putting the pages back on the main pile
(more excited now than the last time) It  Windthorne
knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian
-- (thinks) --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place
(Paul glares at her, she turns to the door) Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful
'm glad you like it
Paul, this will be our legacy
It will
He hands her a few more pages, she starts reading as she exits
: '
rubs his eyes
For a moment, he sags, but he fights it
He puts a clean page into the typewriter
bursts in
Oh, Paul
'm dying
Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne
You have to tell me
You'll know very soon
'm starting the last chapter
And when  finish, want everything to be perfect
'll require three things
What things
You don't know
(smiling) was fooling, silly
(ticking them off) You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it
And you need one glass of champagne
(thinks) Dome Pear-igg-non
Dome Pear-igg-non it is
exits
: The first light of morning is starting to break through
: , stretching
He makes sure everything is set
(calling out) Annie
Annie
With that, she enters
Yes, Paul
'm almost done
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic
Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand
Does Ian win
Oh, don't me
It's Windthorne, right
You'll know everything in a minute
Get the champagne
(dying from the suspense) Ahh
She exits;  adjusts the manuscript on the table and then types the last line
: She takes the bottle of Dom Perignon out of the icebox, places it on a tray with two glasses-- opens a drawer--takes out the gun--places it in her pocket-- then takes out the hypodermic needle and places it on the tray
: ' enters with the tray
She sets it down on the table
Did  do good
You did perfect
Except for one thing
This time we need two glasses
He takes the last page out of the typewriter
Oh, Paul
As soon as she exits,  drops the manuscript to the floor, pulls the lighter fluid from his pants, and starts dousing the manuscript with lighter fluid
He grabs the last chapter and twists the last few pages together torch style
He douses it with the fluid and holds the match out of sight
He smiles as we : entering with the second glass
It's all right here, Annie
Remember how for all those years no one ever knew who Misery's real father was, or if they'd ever be reunited
It's all right here
Will Misery finally lead her countrymen to freedom
Does she finally marry Ian or will it be Windthorne
It's all right here
: , as he strikes it and : screaming-- Paul, you can't
And as her hands fly out beseechingly-- : --it falls to the floor, explodes like a torpedo, shards of glass all over, curds of foam everywhere-- Why not
learned it from you
And on that-- : as Paul brings the match close to it and it bursts into flame
And Paul, holding it like the torch it is
Annie starts moving forward now
No, no,  --
He drops the last chapter into the soaked manuscript and : , as
, it bursts into flame and-- : , transfixed by the sight for a moment, --and then she charges
: as  rushes to the book, stoops down, grabs it with both hands, brings the burning mass up to her body, both arms across it, trying to smother the flames-- : , grabbing the typewriter, raising it high above his head, then throwing it down on her with all his power and : , crashing into the back of her head
: , screaming, driven to the floor by the blow, the book beneath her, and the flames fly up, her sweater is starting to burn and she's covered with shards of glass from the shattered bottle of champagne and some of the manuscript is hissing from the liquid, but she is able to struggle to her knees-- 'm going to kill you, you lying cocksucker
As she struggles to her feet, she pulls out the gun and shoots at Paul, hitting him in the shoulder
Just as she's about to shoot again, Paul quickly wheels the chair up to her, throws himself out of the chair, and tackles her
The gun flies out of her hand and lands in the hallway, going off as it lands
They wrestle on the floor
Flames still around them,  gets on top of her, grabs some burning pages, stuffs them into her mouth, shouting -- Here
Here
You want it
You want it
You can eat it--eat it--eat it till you fucking --you sick, twisted fuck
And as he forces more paper into her mouth-- : , and she's hideous--blistered, her hands claw at her throat
She makes horrible sounds, spitting the charred chunks of manuscript out of her mouth
Shards of glass are in her hair
Now a shriek and a tremendous jerk of her body and : , falling away -- : , still making the sounds as she gets to her feet, and : , trying to crawl away after her
: --heading for the door, she takes a step away from Paul, then another, then : , suddenly kicking out with his shattered leg, screaming in pain as it crashes into her ankle and : , trying to keep her balance, not doing well, her arms windmilling as she fights for balance one last moment, fights and loses, and now, as she topples over-- : as she falls and her head slams into it, collides with the sharp metal and a great wound opens in her head
There is one final cry
Blood pours
It's over
All over
We are looking at a dead body
: , exhausted, panting, lying there, trying to gather his energy
He starts to crawl for the door
Just as he reaches the doorjamb, an arm grabs his leg, and : , shrieking, and : , pulling herself up his body and : , trying to buck her off, but he can't and : , the stronger, relentless, moving up on him, and : , his grip broken as he turns and : , all-powerful, looming over him and : , hitting up at her and : , swelling, and the blood pours down and if she feels his blows she doesn't show it and : , whatever energy he has left he uses now, trying to twist and strike and as his body moves-- : and : , grabbing the thing, suddenly bringing it across his body, clobbering Annie in the face and : , startled by the power of the blow and for a moment she is stopped and : , as with everything he has left, he crunches her forehead with the sharp heavy metal base, just creams her as the air is forced out of her-- : Her eyes roll up into her head
For a moment all we see are the whites-- --then she collapses on , a motionless mountain of slack flesh
: , scrambling free, pushing her off him, crawling for the door-- : --outside the door, as  crawls into view, makes it to the corridor, reaches back, closes the door, locks it
Safe, he collapses, exhausted against the wall opposite the door
: It is dawn
He is awakened by a loud smashing at the front door
After a couple of heart-stopping pounds, : smashes open, revealing two cops with guns drawn
, hurrying to
The   kneels beside Paul
It's the writer--the dead one-- (trying to keep himself together) --right
'm the dead one-- Where's Sheriff McCain
He's in the cellar
She killed him
Annie Wilkes
Yeah
She's in there
: The  , taking the key to the room, unlocks the door, throws it open, and as he steps inside-- : The   has his gun ready to fire, but even with it tight in his hand, he's edgy as hell
He looks around-- --glass and bloodstains on the floor
The charred remains of a manuscript
He kneels quickly, glances under the bed--nothing
He looks at the window--wide open
: and the
Pause
The   is in the doorway now
Mr
Sheldon
There's no one in there
: :
In shock
: , This legend appears: is seated at a table
enters, walking briskly, and he's never looked this good before
He's gained his weight back, his color is normal again
He appears to be, for the first time in the movie, a jaunty, happy figure
Sorry 'm late
Jenny's basketball game went into overtime
If anybody ever told me 'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, 'd
Did they win
Yeah
They're in the semis
Here it is
(big moment) Very first copy
And she hands him a wrapped package
sits, begins unwrapping it
It's a book
new one by Paul Sheldon
The Higher Education of
Phillip Stone
Paul turns it over gently in his hands
: The word 'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter
That'd be a first
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves
And don't laugh--for the first time,  think you've got a shot at some prizes
(flatly) Great
thought you'd be thrilled
You're being taken seriously
'm delighted the critics are liking it, and  hope the people like it, too
But it's not why  wrote the book
: :
There is a genuine sense of peace about him
He has been through the fire and survived
like it
Remember how you once said  live my whole life as if 'm in danger of being found out
Well, believe 've managed to get that guy down on paper
(He touches the book
Beat
) Don't think 'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me
Paul, since you brought her up, have to ask you this, or 'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book
The truth about what went on in that house
Gee, Marcia, if  didn't know you better, 'd think you were suggesting dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks
Now you've hurt me, Paul
As Paul glances around
: , looking past
: , some distance away, being pushed by a waitress
It is
: thought you were over it
am
Well, maybe not completely-- He glances toward the trolley
: , moving inexorably closer to reaches down and pulls out a very sharp knife
: don't know if you can ever be totally over something like that-- just don't think about it as much anymore, and when  do, it's not so terrifying
: , with the knife raised
: , staring up at
mean, once they found her body, my nightmares stopped
: --only it isn't Annie, just a
She stands by the trolley, the knife in her hand, ready to slice whatever anyone wants
Would you care for anything
(smiles) Cut me something sinful
: The smile holds
In the background now, soft music: someone might be playing "Liberace
