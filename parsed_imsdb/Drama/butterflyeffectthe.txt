"  " Screenplay by Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress - '  -  - 2002 , 20, good-looking but with dark haunted eyes, frantically hides himself in an unlit Doctor's office
His face and chest are covered in blood
He holds his forehead in pain
stab through the darkened corridor hunting for him
are heard shouting to each other
Evan grabs a cardboard box and hides under a doctor's desk
He grabs some paper and begins writing in shorthand
(as he writes) If anyone finds this, then  guess my plan didn't work and 'm already dead
He takes a deep breath
But if  can just go back to the beginning of all this,  still might be able to save her
Fatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing
-  - 1982 : , twenty-five, an attractive pregnant woman strapped to a gurney, is rolled down a busy hospital corridor
She is clearly ready to give birth, and as she flails her arms, she knocks another patient's  bottle into the wall

Evan's father,  (23), puts a 1-year old on a slide
'  -  - 1987 birthday party for , 5, a chubby kid with only a few friends
Evan, now 5, is gently prodded by Andrea toward , 5, a quiet sweet-looking girl with beautiful hair
Evan clumsily shakes her hand and she quickly leans over and kisses his cheek
He blushes and runs to hug his mother's leg

'  -   - 1989 In the driveway, 7-year old Evan plays with , a frisky cocker spaniel puppy
Andrea, wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit, works impatiently on the carburetor of a Toyota Celica
Evan pets the dog as he watches his mother work
Okay, okay
what now
Evan quickly eyes the situation and grabs the 5/16" wrench from the toolbox
We're gonna be late again
When did you ever care about getting to school on time
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night
Evan impatiently watches Andrea turn the bolt
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy
Thanks
Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time
The carburetor will not set properly
She bangs on it with the wrench
(re: carb) Darn it
Um
can dad come this time
(getting impatient) You know the answer to that
Can't he come out for one day
We've been over this a hundred times
It's too dangerous for him
But Lenny said that his dad's coming
and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad
Andrea hands the wrench to Evan
Here, Ev
Finish this up for me
Evan beams as he climbs onto the bumper and screws the carb back together
Andrea, meanwhile, strips off her coveralls, revealing a spotless nurse's uniform underneath
All the dads are gonna be there
get the point, kiddo
But 'm not so bad, am
No
Good
Because 've been waiting to see your art projects all week and 'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there
Evan, disappointed, passes the wrench back to Andrea
(beat) Done
Try it
Andrea gets behind the wheel
She turns the ignition and the engine roars to life
Evan wears a proud smile
You're amazing, kiddo
-  - 1989 Andrea races through the school zone and heads for the main doors
Evan's already got the car door open and his foot on the ground by the time the car skids to a halt
Andrea checks her watch
Okay have a great day  love you 'll pick you up later gotta go
Evan blows Andrea a kiss goodbye and runs into the school
As Andrea pulls away,
, 35, taps the car window
Mrs
Treborn
need to speak with you
'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight
'm already late for work -- Mrs
Boswell's morbid expression stops Andrea
think you really need to see this
-  - The classroom is filled with screaming, running children
Mrs
Boswell enters the classroom with Andrea and immediately calls out to , a tough seven-year old kid who swings a whiffle bat at , now seven, a sniffling, chubby kid
' '
Evan is surprised to see his mother enter with Mrs
Boswell, but continues playing with Kayleigh, now seven, a quiet, sweet-looking girl
Mrs
Boswell leads Andrea over to the teacher's desk
was going to show this to the principal, but  wanted to talk to you first
What is it
Yesterday  had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up
Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this
Mrs
Boswell opens the bottom drawer of her desk and pulls out a drawing
Andrea turns to stone when she sees it
don't understand
Evan did this
The drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while standing on a heap of dead bodies
It's extremely sophisticated for a seven-year old
Some of the corpses have been cut open and the insides are surprisingly anatomically correct
Andrea sees Evan playing with Lenny, harmless as a bunny, and struggles to control her concern
Thank you for showing it to me first
'll
'll take care of it
Can have the picture
Of course
There is one more thing, Mrs
Treborn
And  feel bad for mentioning it
What
When  asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it
Andrea is visibly shaken now
have to go
- Andrea seems so impacted by this revelation that she cannot even start the car
- The children hang artwork on the walls in prep for Parent's Night
Each child has a picture of his or her family made from colored construction paper and macaroni
Evan's picture (no longer sophisticated) depicts his mother, Crockett and himself on a green hill
Tommy and Kayleigh's pictures each show two kids and a single father
And their 'mother' is stuck to the far end of page
Lenny beams as he pins-up his picture of an ideal nuclear family
He looks at Tommy's picture and is confused
You put the mommy too far away
Mrs
Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it
You're such a retard
Mommy lives far away but she comes and visits
(to Tommy) If 'm retarded, why didn't my mommy move away from me
Tommy gets upset
He swipes his hand down Lenny's picture and his macaroni "mother" crumbles to the floor
Lenny begins to cry
Hey, what'd you do that for
Fat little baby, crying for mommy
Evan takes the ruined picture and leans down next to Lenny
Come on, Lenny
It's not that bad
You can still see your mom a little
Lenny, unable to stop crying, begins hyperventilating out of control
His desperate gasps for breath are frightening
Evan, scared, looks around for Mrs
Boswell, but cannot find her
He reaches up to his own picture and quickly tears his own macaroni "mother" apart and places it over Lenny's picture
It's a nuclear family again
Lenny slowly is able to catch his breath
(grateful) Can
can
Can  have this
Sure
was gonna make a new one, anyway
Kayleigh helps Lenny glue a new "mother" in place and she smiles gratefully at Evan
As Evan smiles back at Kayleigh, Mrs
Boswell calmly enters the room in time to see Evan tacking up his butchered family portrait
She shivers
-  - 1989 Gothic
Imposing
Andrea runs up the stairs
-
'  - , 40, a handsome and extremely genial man, scrutinizes a disturbing drawing
And you say he doesn't remember any of it
(anxious) Not according to his teacher
It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition
Hold it, hold it, Andrea
Let's not jump to conclusions
'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out
Andrea nods and forces a thankful smile
Tell you what, bring Evan here tonight and we'll run a -scan series
- The looming building looks even more frightening at night
Andrea and Evan head up the stairs
don't like this place, Mom
It's creepy
Please can we go
promise won't make any more bad pictures
(lighthearted) You'll be fine
Dr
Redfield just wants to give you some tests
You'll like him
- Andrea leads Evan into Dr
Redfield's office
Dr
Redfield warmly greets Evan at the door
Hello, Evan
It's very nice to meet you
(to Andrea) He's as handsome as his father
(stunned) You know my father
Before Dr
Redfield can answer, Andrea cuts him off
That's why  wanted you to come here, Evan
Dr
Redfield already has a background in memory loss
My father has a bad memory, too
(off Andrea's look) Uh, tell you what, Evan
If it's okay with your mother, 'd like to run some tests
Nothing scary
Evan raises an eyebrow at the doctor
Okay, it might be a little scary
- Evan looks terrified as he lies on a medical platform as a series of -scan images are taken
In another part of the room, a distressed Andrea speaks quietly with Dr
Redfield
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness
Look, Andrea, 'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders
But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory
Anything
journal
Just have him write down everything he does
Why
What for
It could be extremely useful to jog his memory
See if he remembers anything new the next day
And 'll have the test results back in a few days
'  -  - The next morning
Evan busily writes in his new black-marble mead comp book: ' "Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayley and Tommy will mete there father and see what a real dad is like
Maybe one day  will mete my Dad
" Andrea, meanwhile, speaks into the phone as she pours Lucky Charms into a cereal bowl for Evan
Thanks, George
really appreciate you watching him, he won't be any trouble at all
Evan puts down the journal and eats breakfast
He separates the green clovers from the cereal and drops them to the floor for Crockett to nibble
These'll bring you luck, Crockett
(into phone) Great
'll see you soon
Andrea hangs up the phone and walks into the next room
- Andrea grabs the pocket book off the coffee table and heads back into the kitchen
She drops her purse in shock when she sees: Evan, in doorway, expressionless and holding a large by his side
Evan
Evan sees her but remains expressionless
Evan
What are you doing with that knife
Life suddenly springs into Evan's face
He seems stunned to find himself holding the knife and drops it
(scared) What happened
Honey
What were you doing with that
(tears welling) don't remember
- Andrea, still shaken, drops Evan off at the house of , 35, a handsome athletic man with an infectious smile
He approaches the car and opens the door for Evan
Hey, Andrea
(to Evan) Hello little man
Andrea writes nervously on a piece of paper as Evan gets out
Thanks a lot George
Here's my work number in case there are any problems
(lighthearted laughter) Whaddaya kidding
We're going to have a great time today, right Evan
Andrea nods thanks and nervously drives away
Evan walks up to Mr
Miller and momentarily reaches for his hand
Mr
Miller flinches his hand away and chuckles at Evan
You waiting for an invitation
The kids are inside
Evan appears confused for a moment at Mr
Miller's unexpected rudeness, but walks inside
'  - Evan enters the well-kept middle class home and sees his classmates Kayleigh and Tommy
Kayleigh is dressed in a make- shift Medieval gown and Tommy is also dressed in a period costume
(excited to see Evan) Evan, guess what
Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie
don't think Evan gets to be in it -- Quit it, Tommy
Evan gets to be Robin Hood
'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham
thought  was the bad guy
You are, silly
He's a bad sheriff
Mr
Miller, holding a full glass of scotch in one hand, sets the circa-80's bulky video camera on a tripod and plugs it into the porta-deck
We're really gonna be in a movie
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star
thought  was the star
Shut up, moron
Now get in your costume, Evan
And you have to promise, your bestest super-duper promise, that this will be our little secret
Think you can do that
Evan nods and sticks his arms straight up in the air
Mr
Miller downs his drink and helps Evan off with his clothes
Suddenly -- : '  -  - Evan comes to in an unfamiliar place
The rec-room/basement
Evan's eyes dart from the fireplace to Mr
Miller's camera lens and finally to Kayleigh, whose ashen face trembles slightly
Panic spreads across Evan's face
Where am
What happened
Where did we all go
Calm down, kid
Stand still
Evan backs up and awkwardly scurries around the basement, grabbing his clothes
Panicking
was just somewhere else -- how did get here
Quit acting like some retard or 'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been
Kayleigh
What happened
Kayleigh's eyes are unable to leave the floor
She begins adjusting her disheveled clothing
Evan trembles
What's wrong with me
Tommy silently watches from the top of the basement stairs, absently wringing the head off one of his sister's dolls
- Dr
Redfield places Evan's -scan slides on the light box
Andrea squints, unable to interpret them
Well, the good news is that the results are negative
've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors
And the bad news
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with
It's harder playing detective now
But you must have something to go on
If  had to guess, 'd say the blackouts are stress related
But he's seven
What kind of stress can he have
Plenty
Who knows
Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father
Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad
Come on,  doubt the answer's that simple
You'd be surprised how often they are
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but 've been putting it off
It's worth a shot
can arrange a controlled meeting
careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and  monitoring
Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex
How soon
'  -   - Evan, dressed in his Sunday best, writes copiously in a journal marked " 7
" ' "April 15
Today  get to mete my father
His name is Jason and he is crazy
hope he lets me call him dad
" - Andrea tightly grips Evan's hand as the pair follow Dr
Redfield down a corridor
Evan's enthusiasm is dampened by the sounds of distant screams and bloodcurdling laughter
Dad lives here
Not in this wing, actually
No
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay
Okay
They walk to the end of the corridor and come to a "Visitor's Chamber"
Dr
Redfield leads Evan inside
Andrea begins to follow, but the doctor gestures that she stay outside
- '  - Evan takes a seat at a long rectangular table
His eyes are fixated on the door on the other side of the room
Finally, a dark figure can be seen through the opaque glass
, thirty and haggard looking, enters the room
His eyes want to sparkle at seeing his son for the first time
But tranquilizers have dulled the effect
Evan's eyes fixate on the leg-restraints and handcuffs that hinder Jason's movement
Finally Jason sits
He smiles warmly and speaks in over-enunciated tones
It's okay
won't bite
You've seen pictures of me, right
Uh-huh
Mom says  have your eyes and your -- : - '  - Evan "comes to" in another unfamiliar place
Rather than seeing his father across a table, he's looking up at a ceiling
Blocking his view of the ceiling is Jason, whose face is now monstrous with rage, and whose cuffed hands are wrapped around Evan's throat, choking the life out of him
(through clenched teeth) love
you
Suddenly,  tackle Jason from both sides and wedge a baton under his jaw to wrench him away
Andrea frantically struggles to rescue Evan from Jason's clutches
(panicking) He has to die
You don't understand
It's the only way to stop it
Jason wrestles the baton from under his chin, hits an orderly in the kneecap and comes for Evan with the baton
Orderly #2 acts quickly, beating Jason with his baton
As Jason makes another desperate grab for Evan, Orderly #2 is forced to bash him in the skull
Down for the count
Andrea hugs Evan, now in shock
'm sorry, Evan
'm sorry
And  sounds and Andrea tries to cover Evan's eyes, but through her fingers he can see a quick blur of a pool of blood spreading from Jason's head
: : -  - 1989 Dressed in black, Andrea and Evan watch Jason's casket being lowered into the ground
Andrea's tears soak through her veil
few feet back, Kayleigh stands behind Evan
Ashes to ashes
dust to dust
Evan watches the coffin descend, disappearing from sight
Kayleigh steps up to Evan and takes his hand
moment
And she softly whispers in Evan's ear
You're better off anyway
rumble of thunder
Evan looks up at the brooding dark clouds
- Gray skies
Andrea drives the children home
Evan stares at the passing tombstones that flutter by like a white picket fence
The flickering strobe effect that intensifies into a white blur is hypnotic
: '  -  - 1995 Bright and sunny
The lawn freshly cut
Toro lawnmower has been carelessly left in the grass-strewn driveway
: to the window of the -- '  - Evan, Kayleigh, Tommy and Lenny are now
Evan exhales cigarette smoke, taps his ash and finishes sketching a portrait of Kayleigh in his journal
Tommy wears a leather jacket and now has traces of peach fuzz on his upper lip
Kayleigh's hair is longer now, albeit stringy and unkempt
Evan closes his journal and coolly ignites a - with his thumb and lights Kayleigh's cigarette
Everyone but Lenny smokes in the basement
Tommy, now with longer hair, ransacks his father's army locker looking for something
Tommy, 'm bored shitless over here
What's up already
Hold your horses, man
It's here somewhere
saw it when  was a kid
Tommy absently chucks an old Playboy toward Lenny
Kayleigh seems uncomfortable by the sight of it
(to Tommy) We should go soon
If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead
So let's go
This place creeps me out
Evan claps his hands and stands up, Lenny and Kayleigh join him
Finally, Tommy shakes an old army thermos and hears something rattling inside
knew it had something to do with the army
Tommy opens the thermos, tips it over and a blockbuster (1/4 stick of dynamite) spills out
Tommy grins mischievously
Let's blow the shit out of something
'  - Tommy leads Evan, Kayleigh and Lenny on a mission through the woods
Everyone smokes except Lenny, yet he's the only one who's wheezing
He pulls out an inhaler and takes a puff
Guys, slow up, would you
Evan, did  tell you
My mother said might be able to visit her this summer in Orlando with her new family
What did  say about mentioning that bitch
(uncomfortable) Where the hell are you taking us anyway
Just blow something up already
Just blow something up
Are you nuts
There's an art to mass destruction
Would you just paint the Mona Lisa
No
Besides, we're here already
Now at the edge of the woods, Tommy spots: '  - sits at the end of the driveway
It's exquisite
An exact replica of a Colonial home it serves
Across the street, Tommy hands the blockbuster to Lenny
Here you go, buddy
(recoiling) What
No frigging way, man
'm not touching that thing
The hell you aren't
Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy
Look how small that fuse is
'll get killed
Not necessarily
All eyes turn to Evan as he takes his lit cigarette, breaks off the filter and jams the fuse into the unlit end
That should buy you ten minutes at least
Gee, thanks friend
'  - Lenny paces back and forth next to the three-story mailbox, desperately trying to appear nonchalant
He pretends to notice his shoe's untied and bends down to tie it
From the woods, the other kids watch anxiously
Oh, for Christ's sake, just do it, Lenny
Finally, Lenny throws the bomb in the mailbox
Then sprints like hell to the woods
Kayleigh shakes Lenny's inhaler and hands it to him when he gets back
(taking puff) Thanks
Evan pats Lenny on the back
You got balls, man
The four watch the mailbox in intense anticipation
Evan smiles with the cigarette pressed tightly between his lips and places his hands over Kayleigh's ears
She smiles back at him and presses his hands against her head
Tommy catches this and seems disturbed, and quickly turns back to -- The mailbox
Tick-tock
tick-tock
It's like a staring contest
: '  - Evan, running full speed, comes to in an unfamiliar place
He instantly loses his footing and falls to the ground
Lenny, falling on top of him
Hurry
Let's go
Get him up, Evan
Come on
(frantic) What happened
Where are we
Evan gets up and starts running, then realizes he's not being followed
Kayleigh and Tommy are helping Lenny up and carrying him
Evan realizes that Lenny's completely dazed
Evan doubles back, grabs Lenny's arm and he and Tommy drag Lenny through the woods as fast as they can
(crying) Oh God
what did we do
Shit, Lenny
What's happened to you
We've gotta get help
: '  -  - Andrea's car screeches to the curb of Lenny's house
Lenny's mother, Mrs
Kagan, frantically loads Lenny into an ambulance
As Andrea rushes up to the ambulance, Mrs
Kagan gives her an icy glare and slams the ambulance door in Andrea's face
Andrea turns to Evan, now trembling on the front stoop
What is it
What happened
(staring menacingly at the others) We were just building a fort in the woods when Lenny freaked out
One minute he was fine, then he just froze up
Right guys
What happened, Evan
The truth
don't know
don't remember
Something must've happened
What set him off
blacked out
(building frustration) Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one
Evan looks helpless
You're not making this up, are you
Evan shakes his head "no"
Almost ashamed
: '  - Evan lies on a couch
With every breath you exhale, you can feel all of the tension draining from your body like water through a faucet
Nine, ten, and you're completely asleep
Relaxed
Evan breathes slowly
Deeply
Andrea watches nervously from the far side of the room
Now  want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny
Think of it like a movie
You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish
Understand
Yes
Where are you now
'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears
Are you hurting her
No, protecting her
Andrea suppresses the tiniest of proud smiles
Okay
Then go a little forward in time
What do you see now
see a car
Evan's eyes suddenly roll back in his head
Yes, tell me about the car
Evan moans and begins shaking
Go on
Nothing can hurt you
Remember, this is only a movie
You're completely safe
(moaning) can't
the car vanishes and all of a sudden 'm on the ground in the woods
The car doesn't vanish Evan
The movie in your head has broken, that's all
But now 've re-spliced it and want you to tell me about the car
It's coming
argh
can't
Evan moans and shakes on the couch
Fight it Evan
Hurry
It's coming
Blood begins to trickle from Evan's nose as a guttural sound is uttered from deep within him
Dr
Redfield bolts upright in his chair and redirects the session
Okay, Evan
Listen to my voice
On the count of ten, you're going to wake up
Feeling refreshed and remembering everything we talked about
Evan moans in agony
Andrea darts into the room
What's happening to him
Make it stop
Dr
Redfield waves her away and concentrates on Evan
One
You're feeling more awake now
Two, your eyes no longer feel heavy
Andrea moves to stop the blood flowing from Evan's nose
She lifts Evan's eyelids and sees only the whites of his eyes
Five
Six
Refreshed and awake
Seven, eight
Come on, Evan, wake up, dammit
Evan is completely non-responsive
Evan wake up, oh please wake up
Nine, ten
And you're awake
Open your eyes, dammit
Nothing but moans and blood
Dr
Redfield frantically opens some desk drawers until he finds smelling salts
He breaks a small capsule under evan's mouth, pinches his bleeding nose closed and lets Evan inhale the vapor through his mouth
Evan lurches forward on the couch and falls off
Holding his bloody nose
What happened
Did it work
Evan deduces the answer from everyone's horrified faces
-   - Andrea drops off Evan, Kayleigh and Tommy outside the complex
Kayleigh, looking morose, shuts the car door and Andrea drives off
They walk through the parking lot
(to Kayleigh) Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted
You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you
'm sorry
Would someone just tell me already what the hell happened in the mailbox
On "mailbox", Tommy suddenly grabs Evan's jacket and him against a parked car
Tommy looks around to make sure nobody heard anything
Don't ever bring that shit up again
Not ever
Not to me, not to Kayleigh, or even Lenny
The stupid fuck if he ever learns to talk again
Understand
Evan nods, scared
Tommy gives a final shove
Ever
(re: Kayleigh) She don't want to talk about it, anyway
Do you Kayleigh
Tommy's right
Kayleigh clearly doesn't
- Kayleigh shuffles behind Evan and Tommy as they head toward the theatre
Evan drops back
Are you okay
Kayleigh says nothing as Tommy sees the theatre playing and whispers
There it is
Let's go
'  -  - Andrea does the dishes as the  plays a  in the b
g
(on ) was the grizzly aftermath of what police officials of upstate New York are calling a horrible act of vandalism gone awry
Andrea turns to the , blocking our view
We can only hear the report as she watches intensely
The powerful explosion is believed to have been caused by a small quantity of dynamite
Andrea's face looks haunted by the on-screen images
She shakes her head in terror and grabs the remote
Police thus far have no leads as to the suspects
She clicks off the , trembling
- The movie's in progress
Evan and Kayleigh sit behind Tommy
Holy shit
Look at that fat fuck
You'd have to wipe his ass with a forklift
Some crowd members  around and give Tommy a
Tommy whips &Ms at them
Shut up, faggot
No one's talking to you
Kayleigh, repulsed, suddenly darts from the aisle and runs out
Evan follows
- Evan follows her to a small alcove
'm sorry Kayleigh
This was a bad idea
You really don't remember anything that happened
Evan shakes his head "no"
She looks devastated
You're so lucky
She begins to cry
Evan makes sure no one's staring
It's going to be okay
Lenny'll be fine
You'll see
He reaches to comfort her
But she winces
Ouch
'm sorry
She pulls her sleeve up, revealing a large bruise
It's not your fault
Mrs
Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny
Damn
Your dad did this
Kayleigh pulls back her shirt collar to show an even larger, darker bruise
(looking down) deserve a lot worse
What are you talking about
What you deserve is a better brother and father
All they do is make you feel like shit
She looks into his eyes
You really have no clue how beautiful you are, do you
She searches his eyes for sincerity
And finds it
They lean into each other for a
After a moment, a from nearby
(
) What the fuck are you doing
They jerk back to see Tommy, shocked and betrayed, staring at them from across a small crowd
By now, some teens chuckle at Tommy
(
) Buying popcorn, what the fuck are you doing
Tommy rushes through the small crowd at Evan
His hands in fists
Suddenly a  reaches out and trips Tommy
Tommy falls to the floor and the crowd cackles at him
Tommy slowly gets up, locks eyes with Evan
Hatred oozing
Evan looks guilty, weakly shaking his head, it's not what you're thinking
Tommy suddenly lunges at the   who must be at least a foot taller than he is
Tommy lands a flurry of punches before the Teen Punk can even defend himself, frequently taking opportunities to eyeball Evan
Evan, Kayleigh and even the punk's  look on helplessly when
Tommy valiantly struggles against them at first
But the moment he realizes it's hopeless, he allows his body to go slack
As Tommy is being dragged away, he turns to Evan, a sick smile on his face
Evan and Kayleigh look back, speechless
'  - Andrea drives through the winding roads
Andrea's eyes
Tormented
she's driving Evan and Kayleigh home
Evan's up front and Kayleigh sits behind them
Everyone silent
Andrea stares through the rearview mirror into Kayleigh's eyes
Probing
Searching
So how was the movie
Okay
Andrea watches Kayleigh
calculated beat
Any exploding mailboxes
Kayleigh flinches at the question
And Andrea catches it
Evan can't help but look back at Kayleigh
Oh my god, she knows
(faking poorly) What do you mean
Andrea pulls the car over and stops
After a moment, Kayleigh realizes she's at her house
She exits the car in a hurry
Goodnight
Andrea stares at Evan, who keeps his eyes facing dead ahead
She finally shifts the car into gear
We're moving
Evan says nothing
: '  - "For Sale" sign is now planted on the front lawn
Andrea, in her nurse uniform, exits the house to her car
'   - Evan discreetly watches her leave through the window
Grabs his coat and exits frame
'  - Kayleigh and Evan walk down toward the house
can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me
He knows 'm moving away, right
He's been acting real strange lately
He won't even look me in the eyes anymore
Duck, here they come
As a station wagon rolls up the street, Evan and Kayleigh duck in nearby bushes
Did your mom say if Lenny was
okay
He must be
They're letting him go, right
The station wagon finally heads into the driveway
Evan puts on a smile and charges the car, pounding the window
Welcome home, Lenny
Inside the car, Lenny jerks back in horror
Mrs
Kagan looks angry as she rolls the window down
think your little homecoming's in bad taste
The smile fades from Evan's face
Kayleigh hangs back
Sorry
(acidic) Lenny's been through a hell of an ordeal no thanks to you
Evan and Kayleigh look guilty as the garage door opens up and Mrs
Kagan continues into the garage
'  - Alone, Lenny concentrates on a
There is a sudden  at the window
Lenny's head jerks around to see Evan and Kayleigh smiling through the window
'  - Evan and Kayleigh stand on the ivy-covered trellis
(quietly) Welcome home
Thought you might like some fresh air for a change
Hi, Lenny
Lenny twitches ever-so-slightly
Is Tommy with you guys
Evan shakes his head "no"
It's cool
Lenny looks back at the model airplane
Needs to think
- Evan, Lenny and Kayleigh pass a junk pile in the woods
(to Lenny) So what did you do in there
It was awful
You can't sleep 'cause everyone's screaming all night long
never want to go back
As Evan and Kayleigh absorb this in silence, they see a column of smoke billowing in the horizon
Do you see that
Evan and Kayleigh run toward the smoke
Lenny nervously follows behind
They exit the woods to find: - Tommy has stuffed a dog into a gunny sack which he douses with lighter fluid
Next to a campfire
Crockett
Evan and Kayleigh rush toward the trapped, helpless dog
Tommy is ready for them
He drops the lighter fluid, picks up a wooden plank and
Evan ducks back at the last minute and Tommy accidentally connects with Kayleigh's head
Knocking her unconscious
Look what you made me do
What's wrong with you
Tommy, enraged, fakes a high swing, then goes for Evan's knee cap
Evan doubles over in pain and falls to the ground, clutching his knee
Tommy moves to the fire, Crockett squirming inside the bag and picks up the lighter fluid
Evan painfully looks up from the ground and his eyes dart from the sight of Kayleigh, unconscious, to Crockett, trapped in the tied gunny sack
Kayleigh
Wake up
No response
Why don't you fucking kiss her, Prince Charming
Tommy squeezes the bottle hard, creating a flaming fuse from the campfire to the fluid soaked dog
As the flames near Crockett, Evan, seething with rage, stands up with clenched fists and  Tommy at   -- : - Evan comes to in an unfamiliar place
Still in running mode
His body contorts spastically like a fish on land, since he is now lying face down on the ground
Evan regains himself and sits up painfully
His face is badly bruised and he clutches his battered ribs
How long was  out
He gets no answer from Lenny, who stands in the exact same spot
Tommy is nowhere in sight and the sound is of Kayleigh weeping
Evan spins to face her
Kayleigh
Are you okay
Where's Crockett
Kayleigh, her knees drawn tightly to her chest, is unable to answer through her tears
Evan struggles to rise but he becomes dizzy and falls back to the ground
Evan takes a quick glance toward the gunny sack, smouldering then moans and buries his head in his hands
'  - small neighborhood  has gathered to watch an ambulance with the  insignia take an entranced Lenny away
Mrs
Kagan is about to climb in the rear when she stops and turns to Evan
(ice cold) Do you know what you are
monster
Evan stands there, speechless
'  - packed - sits in front of Evan's house
Andrea shifts the small truck into gear and slowly pulls out
Outside the truck, Kayleigh waves to Evan, tears spilling shamelessly down her cheeks
Evan reaches behind his seat and opens a large cardboard box
It is filled with past journals
He finds the most recent journal, uncaps a pen and writes something
Finished he presses the journal to the window
' "'ll come back for you
" Evan waves back to her, trying nonchalantly to wipe away his own tears as she fades into the distance
When Kayleigh disappears from sight, Andrea looks over to see what he's written
'm sorry
Evan returns the journal and begins writing furiously
: -  - 2002 : Evan, twenty now, continues writing in a college Blue Book
He is older, dressed down in worn jeans, -shirt and plaid flannel
He closes the Blue Book with a cocky grin just as , 40, calls out to the class: Time
Please place your blue books on my desk before you leave
Evan grabs his psychology textbook from under his seat, gets up and turns in his exam
How'd you do, Evan
Evan flashes a confident smile
'm not sure
might have gotten some stories mixed up
Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts
(laughing) Typical psych major
complete wise ass
And how's your project coming
Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation
(shrugging) Hey,  got no choice
Professor Carter nods solemnly, obviously in the know
-  - Evan bikes past students
-   - Evan bikes past some obnoxious
- '  - Evan docks his bike and carries his knapsack inside
'  - Evan's dorm is cluttered "double" whose walls are adorned with head-shop posters of Gothic rock bands
By Evan's bed is a bookshelf filled with books on amnesia, memory loss, fugues, hypnotism and other related bands
Evan's roommate, , 19, is a completely punked out Gothic boy who weighs 300 pounds
He currently hands a black lacy dress to , 17, a pierced Goth co-ed
She slips the tattered dress on as Thumper wipes his post-coital self off with a black tee-shirt
Evan barges through the door, throwing his pscyh books on the bed and politely looking away from the half-naked girl
Whoa
Smells like patchouli and
ass
Evan opens the window and checks out his Psych project: a small maze has several flatworms at one end and a bowl of cornflakes at the other
Cricket, meet my well-mannered roommate, Evan
Cricket puts on her Doc Martens as Evan watches the worms
Yeah, you're the one who fucked up the bell-curve on my Anthropology final
Later, Thumper
Nice to meet you, too
As she leaves, Thumper takes the black -shirt by his wallet and throws it on Evan's bed
Here, bro
Found your -shirt
Evan nods thanks, picks up his journal
Reads something and smiles
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday
thought you were a December baby
This is bigger
Seven years to the day
No blackouts
Thumper pulls out a bong
Let's do this
'  - '  - popular watering hole
dark rustic interior, blasting alternative rock
Plenty of underage students carry pitchers of beer to their tables
Evan and Thumper play pool against two young women
, beautiful, wears ripped jeans, no make up
She sinks the eleven ball off the rail
coolly smokes a cigarette, confident that she and Heidi will hold the table
So
which one of you has a pet worm
Thumper proudly steps forward
Worms, plural
That's so gross
Thumper steps back, points to Evan
Talk to him about it, he's got the fetish
Heidi sinks another ball and looks up at Evan strangely
Actually, they're for a psych project
study on memory
Heidi misses her shot and passes the cue to Evan
(stifling a yawn) Shit, better explain before all the excitement gives me a heart attack
Evan speaks as he knocks the one-ball in the corner pocket
As he talks, at a table behind them, some obnoxious Greeks, including , , and  make fun of Thumper
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze
You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it
Then you put a new flatworm in the maze
He's clueless
Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever
(thoughtfully) Like Ozzy
Gwen giggles as Spencer throws popcorn at Thumper's head
Ten bucks says he eats it off the floor
Thumper seems oblivious to their taunts as Evan knocks the three-ball in the side
You chop up the smart flatworm and feed it to the dumb one and presto, the dumb one suddenly knows the maze inside and out
Evan walks past Heidi, putting his hand on her shoulder to squeeze by
The hand lingers longer than necessary and Heidi doesn't mind
He sinks another ball
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories
(thoughtfully) That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart
handful of popcorn hits Thumper's face
They all try to ignore Hunter and Spencer's jeers
So what's the point
(setting up the eight) Maybe if  can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain
Another barrage of popcorn hits Thumper's jacket
Although his hand clenches on the cue
He meekly shuffles away to the opposite side of the pool table from the cackling Greeks
(intrigued) So are you planning on becoming a doctor or something
Thumper casually takes the pool cue from Evan
No,  just don't want to lose my mind
As Heidi digests this, Thumper carefully lines up his shot
The eight ball
The cue ball intentionally jumps the table, rocketing into the pitcher of beer on the Greek's table
They're all soaked with beer and debris
Just as they begin to rise, Thumper smashes the cue stick on the table,  innocently (while now brandishing a spear)
They sit the fuck down
Kristin, impressed, casually wraps her arm around Thumper's waist
He smiles coolly, it's nothing
(to Heidi) think that's your game
'  - Evan and Heidi, making out, burst through the door and fall on the bed
Evan's shirt is unbuttoned and Heidi strokes his chest
Suddenly Heidi stops and sniffs the air
Smells like sex in here
Thumper had a busy afternoon
You're kidding
He's so
big
Evan drunkenly crosses the room, grabs two beers from the mini-fridge
Charisma and eyeliner go a long way, guess
Wanna beer
Heidi takes one
Looks under the bed
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are
comp books
Yeah
've been keeping journals since  was seven
(respectfully) Wow
read something
Evan chugs his beer and sits next to her on the bed and puts his arm around her
Very drunk
No way, 'd be too embarrassed
Heidi teasingly runs her fingers over his smooth torso
Then keep drinking, worm-boy
You're too uptight
Evan stops short
Freeze
No "worm-boy"
No "Mr
Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General
" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it
And  don't want everyone thinking 've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay
(laughing) Deal
Now read me something
Heidi hands him a book marked " 13"
He flips it open to a random place and takes the beer from her hand
(re: her beer) For courage
Evan takes and finishes her beer and begins reading
As he reads, he seems more and more on the verge of passing out
It's like my mind refused to believe what it was seeing
Hearing Crockett make those awful screams
Just writing about it gives me the shivers
Color drains from Evan's face as he realizes what he's reading
He looks over at Heidi, who kisses him
Come on, go on
It was like Tommy was possessed or something
There was a hate in his eyes that  couldn't really call human
As Evan reads, the world seems to around him
His voice becomes distant and around him like distant memories resurrecting themselves
: -  - 1995 Evan is  again
The scene begins exactly where Evan's blackout occurred as a child
Tommy has just knocked Kayleigh unconscious with a wooden plank, Lenny is frozen at the sight of Crockett in the fluid-soaked gunny sack
And Evan, seething with rage, stands up with clenched fists and  Tommy at full speed
Evan looks around, utterly confused by his surroundings
What the hell is going on
Before an answer comes, Tommy smiles at his good fortune and swings the plank, hitting Evan's head
Evan is sent sprawling backwards, his forehead bleeding freely
Tommy knocks Evan hard in the ribs with his boots
Evan writhes in agony, his face against the ground
Lenny moves toward the gunny sack, lifts it and tugs desperately on the rope that traps Crockett inside
can't undo the rope
Tommy spins around and flashes an evil smile
Drop it or 'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep
As if on cue, Lenny does exactly as he's told
His eyes begin to glaze over
Evan, beaten and bloody, reaches out with his last bit of strength, grabs Tommy's foot and holds on
got him, Lenny
Help Crockett
Lenny remains frozen in place
Tommy yanks his leg back, breaking Evan's grip
Evan groans on the ground in a writhing heap
Tommy's voice hitches
His eyes water from pent up frustration
Listen to me good, Evan
There's a million other sisters in the world
You didn't have to fuck with mine
Tommy smiles viciously at Lenny, traumatized to watch Tommy pick up the lighter fluid and spray a liquid fuse from the campfire to the soaked gunny sack
And Evan passes out
: '  -  - 2002 Evan comes to with Heidi slapping him awake
Oh my God
No
No
Heidi rolls her eyes
Wake up, idiot
It was just a dream
She stands and angrily puts on her jacket
(freaked out) It didn't feel like a dream
Maybe because they never do
(sarcastic) So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates
Evan doesn't even hear her
After getting his bearings, he grabs his jacket and exits, leaving her dumbfounded
'  - Evan drives
'  - Evan, exhausted, finally pulls into Lenny's driveway
Very little has changed in the past seven years
'  - Now 20, making a model airplane
He's still overweight and looks like his mother dresses him
The room is filled with model airplanes
Hundreds of them
on Lenny's bedroom door
Mrs
Kagan, grayer, fatter, opens the door and escorts Evan inside
She glares at Evan while pretending to be cheerful
've got a surprise for you, Lenny
You'll never guess who's here
Lenny looks up to see Evan, his jaw drops
Looking around, shocked to see: Nothing has changed in the past seven years
The same kids' toys, posters and comic books
We see he's working on the model again, in his own world
The window of opportunity for conversation has closed
Hey, uh, it's me
Evan
Silence
Lenny frowns
What's that you're working on model
Nothing
Well, you look busy, so maybe  should make this quick
'd totally understand if you didn't want to get into this right now, but that day at the junkyard, could you help me remember what happened
Any details
No response
Evan picks up a model airplane from the desk
couldn't cut the rope
(containing excitement) Yeah, good, what else do you remember
Drop it or 'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep
Evan, startled, drops the model on the desk
An epiphany
Jesus Christ
It really happened
Lenny stares out the window
What if  can get back all my lost memories with my journals
With lightning speed, Lenny jumps from his desk and unexpectedly shoves
Squadrons of hanging planes crash to the floor
Lenny digs his fingers into Evan's shoulder
Make one peep and  swear it'll be your last, motherfucker
Evan is terrified
Then Lenny suddenly moves back and begins working on the model again, his eyes a million miles away
Evan is speechless
The door bursts open
Mrs
Kagan looks at the smashed model airplanes by Evan's feet
Evan ignores her accusing stare
Well, thanks for seeing me, man shouldn't have waited so long
When Lenny doesn't respond, Mrs
Kagan hustles Evan back into the hallway
'  - Evan pulls a dozen journals from beneath his bed and begins pouring over them
Nearby, Thumper empties a can of hairspray into his Mohawk
You really think he wanted to kill you
All  know is that  might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories
He finds something he's looking for, marks the page with a yellow post-it note marked,  and sets the book in a separate pile
As he sets the next journal on the bed, it automatically opens up to a place where the spine was bent
Staring up at him is the message: ' " will come back for you
" Evan looks overcome by guilt
Later that evening: '  - Evan has now organized a pile of five journals
He selects an entry, begins reading and suddenly closes the journal
Fear covers his face
He holds one of his hands up and isn't surprised to see it trembling
He opens his journal again and reads out loud
(reading aloud) The last thing  remember before the blackout was holding my hands over Kayleigh's ears
(his voice slowly fades) think  was more focused on her hands on mine than the mailbox across the street
His own words grow reverberant, distant
Furthermore, the walls behind him vibrate, slightly worse than before
: '  -  - 1995 Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny and Tommy, all thirteen, watch the mailbox across the street with intense anticipation
When Evan comes to in this memory, the lit cigarette absently drops from his mouth and nestles into the folds of his shirt, The mailbox
tick-tock, tick-tock
Like a staring contest
Maybe it went out
Should someone check it
Yeah, you do that, Lenny
Suddenly a car appears from down the street and slowly pulls into the driveway
, 24, an attractive young mother, gets out of the car and walks to the mailbox
Across the street, Tommy digs his fingers into the nerves of Lenny's shoulder
Make one peep and  swear it'll be your last, motherfucker
Tommy's words make Evan flinch
From inside the car, a begins to cry
Mrs
Halpern walks back to the car
Evan looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt, sending the lit cigarette to the ground
He pulls up his shirt revealing a fresh   on his stomach
How's my sweet girl
Awww, you need a change, don't you honey
Mrs
Halpern picks her up and carries her to the house
As the mother unlocks the front door to the house, the kids break into wide smiles of relief
But wait
The mother remembers the mail and carries the baby back to the mailbox
Now Tommy is the only one left still smiling
You want to open the door, honey
The baby fumbles with the mailbox's door handle for a moment -- ' The blast is deafening
Evan, Kayleigh and Lenny watch the results in stunned horror
'mon
Run
Evan and Kayleigh slowly back away in shock and begin to run a few steps when they realize that Lenny isn't with them
Lenny
Come on
Oh my God oh my God
Lenny doesn't seem to hear, his eyes fixated on the crimson road
Evan and Tommy double back and grab him
They try to make him break out into a run, but Lenny's feet drag limply against the ground
Both Tommy and Evan grab an arm and begin to run with Lenny through the woods
: '  - Evan comes to
Lurches his body over the bed and vomits
Sounds of squeaky bed springs fill the room
Looking sick and pale, he lifts his shirt to see a   from the cigarette burn
What the hell
In the next bed, Thumper's head, wrapped in a blanket, pops up from above a  ' waist
Christ, man
You wanna clean that up before  lose my appetite here
Evan sits upright in bed and begins writing in the margins of the journal
- The lobby is decorated with colorful streamers, balloons, posters and banners announcing '
Carefree  and their parents carry shopping bags toward the bustling elevators
Evan leans against the side of a pay phone, holding his ear to drawn out the noise
Yes, hello, uh, Mrs
Kagan, this is Evan Treborn
(rolling eyes) know
'm sorry about that
But really need to speak with him
She's obviously hung up on him
Suddenly, a  grabs his shoulder
It's
Whoa
Didn't mean to scare you, Evan
Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming
Oh, fine  guess
It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so  haven't
know,  know
Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right
Evan shrugs and forces a smile
Just don't drop the ball, okay
won't let you down, Professor Carter
Carter waves to another student and her parents and walks away
- waiter clears the dishes away from Evan and Andrea's table
Her hair now has gray streaks
As she signs for the bill, she leans over and kisses Evan on the cheek
Please, mom
People will talk
can't help it
'm just so proud of you
You've got the highest grades in all of your classes
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades
(smiling) Please
He got straight 's without ever touching a book
That was the one area where his memory never failed him
Ma
Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time
Andrea's smile fades
Why do you ask
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all,  just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten
When he was around your age
almost exactly your age
He said he figured out a trick to remember the past
Evan tries not to react
couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms
You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them
Sure
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could
What
What could he do
Andrea shakes her head
Forget it
It's nothing
He was far too sick by then
Evan nods, but something gnaws beneath the surface
'  - Evan hastily hunts through his journals, tearing up the room looking for a certain book
Thumper, lying on his bed, quietly watches Evan with growing concern
(reading aloud) never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so  wanted to wear my clothes but Mr
Miller took his shirt off -- What the fuck are you doing
Shhh
need quiet for this
Thumper jumps off the bed and snatches the journal away
Are you stupid or what
What
Shucks,  dunno
But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit
Thumper begins scanning the journal entry
bitter laugh
Yeah, man
'd think twice about this
You could wake up a lot more fucked up than you are now
He hands the journal back to Evan
Evan opens it and begins reading it silently
His hands begin to tremble and he slams the book shut in defeat
'  -  - Evan, looking haggard and frail, wipes the greasy hair from his eyes and punches the accelerator
His teeth are clenched and he hammers his fist on the dashboard
: - Evan pulls into a parking lot of a country diner
He eyes a piece of paper with an address scrawled on it and gets out
- run-down greasy spoon
Filled with a number of  and The place is stale with cigarette smoke and appears decorated in grime motif
Evan is about to enter when he spots Kayleigh coming out of the kitchen with a tray full of food
Kayleigh, now twenty, looks pale and sickly thin
She bangs her hip on the swinging door and an order of food crashes to the floor
Her  stares back in aggravation
Can we get through one goddamned day without you breaking something
Kayleigh's face turns beet red as she bends down to clean up the order
She is humiliated and Evan leans back against a pay phone so that she can't see him watching her
As she brings the mess inside the kitchen, a  pinches her ass
Evan closely studies her reaction to the offense
She flinches uncomfortably but then composes a smile for the customer
Evan backs out uncomfortably
- Kayleigh struggles with the zipper of a shabby coat as she exits
Evan steps out of the shadows
She's startled at first, but eventually recognizes him
smile flickers across her face and she allows herself to be hugged
God, Evan
never thought 'd see you again
How've you been
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know
No, Evan
don't know
It's been a long time
Fill me in
'm going to State now
Things are going okay
guess
Mom's good
Kayleigh nods and they walk down the street
She reaches into her pocket, pulls out a pack of smokes
(declining) Not since we were kids
've stopped a hundred times
So how's Tommy
(takes a long drag) They kept him in juvy for a few years
Now he works over at Dale's Autobody
Evan nods and scrutinizes her face with his next question
You still live with your dad
Her face is betrayed by a slight tick
No
emancipated myself when  was fifteen
Wow
That must've taken some courage
Not if you remember my dad
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom
(shaking her head) She had a new family
Not enough space for me
Said  should have moved in with her when we were kids
But
whatever
They walk in silence for a moment
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason came back to town was to talk to you
(brightening) Me
Are you kidding
Why
Remember when  was a kid  had all these blackouts
Of course
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and 'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular
It'd be a big help
Well, sure
'll try to remember
Shoot
When we were kids
Your dad was making a movie
Robin Hood or something
(cold) What do you want to know, Evan
It's just
did he
what happened in the basement
It was a long time ago
know, but
(cold) Is that why you came all the way back
To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood
No, but  think something really bad might've happened to us
Kayleigh stops walking and crushes her cigarette
Is there a point to any of this
Evan's features shift from inquisitory to tenderness
He steps closer to Kayleigh and softly strokes her face
She flinches at first, but remains in the same spot
Whatever happened, it wasn't our fault
You know we couldn't have stopped it
Kayleigh begins to tremble
Tears flow
Look, Kayleigh
This may sound like bullshit coming from a guy who hasn't spoken to you in seven years
She moves her face away from his hand
But you were seven years old and there's nothing you could've done to deserve
Her face collapses and she turns away
(defeated) Just shut up, Evan
You're wasting your breath
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak
Who are you trying to convince, Evan
You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory
You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now
Well fuck you, Evan
Nothing's gonna be all better
Okay
Nothing ever gets better
Kayleigh runs, stops and turns back to Evan
If  was so wonderful, Evan, why didn't you ever call me
Why'd you leave me here to rot
She turns and runs away
Evan looks sick with guilt
-  -  - 2002 few  play frisbee and talk trash
Evan, tired and depressed, sits on the lawn nearby, fingering the new burn scar on his belly
Contemplating
'  - Evan enters his dorm
He ignores Thumper, who sits on Evan's bed sucking furiously from a gurgling bong
He chokes out a message
Some dude left a message for you
Evan puts a towel under the door
You can smell it all the way in the bathroom
Evan hits "play" on the answering machine
(male voice) Hi, Evan, this is Professor Carter
Just wondered why you didn't hand in your essay this afternoon
was a bit concerned
Call me to schedule a make-up
Thumper offers Evan a magnified frown of disapproval
(male voice) What did you say to my sister motherfucker
Last night she cried on the phone for over an hour to me
(enraged breathing) She said you came and saw her last night
Thumper coughs accidentally, tips the bong over on Evan's bed
Reacting quickly, he grabs a towel from under the door and wipes off Evan's comforter
(Tommy; cont'd) She
she fucking killed herself tonight
She's dead
(beat) And so are you
Evan stares dumbstruck at the machine
Whoa, bad news, bro
don't think this is gonna come out
: - Evan, dressed in black, gets out of his car at the edge of the cemetery
small cluster of friends and family gather at the grave
Evan grabs a bouquet of roses and begins walking to the grave
When he suddenly spots Mr
Miller and Tommy
Evan's hands tense up into fists
He becomes weak in the knees and stops walking
After an uncomfortable moment of standing still, he retreats to his car and watches the ceremony from the driver's seat
: - The last of the mourners are filing away
Evan exits his car and walks to the deserted grave
He drops the roses on the casket and turns to make sure nobody is watching
Evan reaches into his pocket and pulls out a sheet of paper
He unfolds it and leaves it on her gravesite: ' "'ll come back for you
" '  - He makes a weighty decision and gets up
He hastily hunts through his journals, looking for a certain book
Evan opens his journal marked "Age 7"
He plops on his bed and starts writing sideways in the margins
(
) It's been said that a person's life is little more than the sum of his experiences
If that's true, then 'm not sure  know who  am anymore
(beat) definitely never knew Kayleigh
He turns the page and begins reading the journal
As he mouths the entry to himself, the resonance of an older man's voice seems to  throughout the room and the  behind his head
: '  -   -  - 1989 Mr
Miller plays with his camera and the kids are excited about playing Robin Hood in a movie
Shut up moron
Now get in your costume Evan
Evan slowly nods and begins to strip out of his clothes
Mr
Miller takes a quick peek at him
've got an idea
Let's go downstairs, it'll look more like a dungeon down there
'  -  - 1989 Mr
Miller puts the camera on a tripod in the basement
Kayleigh and Evan sit on folding chairs in front of the camera
Tommy stands at the top of the basement stairs, looking down
(to Tommy) What did  say about keeping that door closed, stupid
But  wanna see
You're gonna see my fist in about two seconds unless you do what tell you
Tommy sulks and closes the door
Mr
Miller lowers his voice and speaks to Evan and Kayleigh
Now in this part of the story, Robin Hood just married Maid Marian and they have to kiss and stuff like grown-ups do
Kayleigh giggles and covers her mouth with her hand
Evan looks skeptical
So take your clothes off Kayleigh
Kayleigh stops giggling
Evan says nothing
Come on, like when you take a bath
Don't make a deal out of it
You too, Evan
Mr
Miller gets behind the lens
The room is dead silent
Let's go
Who silently opens the door at the top of the basement stairs and watches with horror
Evan's face is flushed with rage
He walks behind Kayleigh and cups his hands tightly around her ears
She can't hear anything now
What time is it
It's time for you to stand where the hell  told you
Wrong answer, fuckbag
This is the very moment of your reckoning
In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors
The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood
The mature speech seems completely surreal coming from a seven-year old
Mr
Miller looks around the room as if he's the butt of some sick joke
(stunned disbelief) What's happened to -- How are you doing that
(voice rising) It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father
Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide
Nice work, daddy
(hoarse whisper) Who -- who are you
Evan impatiently waves the question
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George
Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like
oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter
Sound okay to you, Papa
(choking) yes
Listen close then, fuckbag
You screw up again and  swear 'll flat out castrate you
The impact of the last sentence isn't lost on Mr
Miller
One last thing
Evan leans over to whisper in Kayleigh's ear
Kayleigh stares at the floor, then looks up at her father and shivers
Kayleigh looks into Evan's eyes for support
Evan nods go on
His confidence brings a boldness to her lips
Don't you ever touch me again
--  won't
Kayleigh summons her own new courage
'm cold
And 'm putting on my clothes
As he leaves to pick up her clothes, Evan grins
What you need to do is discipline your son Tommy, because the kid's one sadistic pup
Hiding at the top of the basement stairs, Tommy recoils in horror and picks up one of his sister's dolls and begins twisting the head back and forth
: -  - 2002 broad smile lines Evan's face as he slowly wakes up from his slumber
He suddenly grabs his head as if suffering from a pounding migraine
Quick cuts and flashes of Evan and Kayleigh growing older -- she seems more carefree now, full of life and less self- conscious
'  -  - 1989 Evan pulls Kayleigh around in a little red wagon

More memory flashes of Evan and Kayleigh throughout the teen years, they grow up as lovers now: -  - 1997 Evan and Kayleigh have romantic picnic on a rowboat
-  - 2002 Evan and Kayleigh watch the sunrise after senior prom
: -  - 2002 Finally the memory assault is over
Evan groans in pain as blood trickles from his nose
An arm reaches over and touches his shoulder
(
) Honey, are you all right
Evan whips around to see Kayleigh watching him
Not only is Kayleigh alive, but she's a ravishing beauty
Evan lurches back from the shock of seeing Kayleigh and falls to the floor
She sees Evan's nose bleed and her eyes go wide
Oh my God, Evan
You're bleeding
Look at you
Evan, still stunned, can do little but stare from the floor
(transfixed by her) Jesus, Kayleigh, you're
(looks around) Incredible
(purring) Mmmm
You give good compliment
Clean up and come back to bed
He stands in the middle of her bedroom, surrounded by sorority plaques and pink preppy decor
Evan, hardly able to take his eyes off her as she hands him a tissue
He reaches for his clothes at the foot of the bed and comes up with a Greek-lettered fraternity sweatshirt and brown suede jacket
Where
where are my clothes
Those are your clothes, silly
Evan frowns with distaste, grabs a towel and heads out
: - At the sink, Evan washes the blood off his face and looks at his reflection in the mirror
nearby shower
This is too amazing
Un-fucking-real
'  (
) wish  could get so excited about a nose bleed
Evan turns around and sees Gwen, one of the sorority brats from the bar, exit the shower naked
Whoops
Sorry
My bad
Evan blushes and turns back to the mirror through which Gwen dries herself with a towel while staring flirtatiously back at Evan
Hey, you were with those assholes who threw popcorn at Thumper
Evan holds his temple in pain as another memory comes to him
And your name is
Gwen
Seriously, Evan
Lay off the blow
She pats his ass and exits the bathroom
-  -  - 2002 Kayleigh, wearing a long skirt and tight red sweater, catches the eye of every guy on campus
She and Evan stroll arm in arm through the quad
Somehow, the world seems brighter now
Even the colors seem more vibrant when compared to the somewhat grimmer world we've known
wave to Evan and call his name
He can't remember all their names but it's kinda cool being the
Evan takes a long look at her and becomes curious
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera
Well  remember he had one
but he, like, put it away after the first day
Why would that freak me out
dunno
(goofy smile) Just being weird
Kayleigh playfully sweeps her leg around to kick him on the ass, then smiles as if a ghost must have done it
Such a goofus
See you tonight
Kayleigh gives him a big unexpected kiss and walks away
After a moment of wow, Evan runs off to class himself
- Evan inserts his last quarter into the lobby pay phone and dials a telephone number
(to himself) Come on, Mom, be there
(Andrea's voice) Andrea, (Evan's voice) Evan, (a strange, older man's voice) And Chuck, (all three) Aren't home right now
You know what to do
(off-guard) Hi, Mom and, uh, Chuck
Just calling to say hi and well, call me
Evan hangs up the phone, then checks his watch
No, wrist
At that moment, Thumper passes Evan in the lobby
Thumper
What time is it, man
Thumper eyes this strange preppy kid with distaste
Whasamatter
Lost your Rolex
Huh
Fuck off, frat boy
Thumper walks away, leaving Evan dumbfounded
- Evan runs into the lecture hall and gets in line behind other who are taking No
2 pencils from a box on Professor Carter's desk
Evan hears  he cannot see calling his name
Somehow, it's more creepy than cool
The Professor makes a loud announcement
Remember, everyone
Only two weeks until your science projects are due
(quietly) still owe you an essay from last week
Is there any way  could get an extension
And you are
(disappointed) Evan Treborn
The answer's 'no', Mr
Treborn
Now take a seat
The exam's about to begin
Evan walks up the aisle and takes a seat
As he sits down, someone puts his  menacingly around Evan's throat
Evan flinches, turns around and sees Hunter, the frat guy Thumper assaulted the other night at Dirty Hank's bar
Leave me alone, asshole
didn't lay a hand on you, okay
Hunter bursts out laughing
Evan, you're hysterical
You study for this
(awkward) We'll find out soon enough
(laughing) Me neither
Hunter surreptitiously hands Evan a cheat-sheet to the exam
Evan's face brightens
You're kidding
Are these the answers
Damn, Evan, on the
(holding it lower) Thanks
Wow
Hey,  want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow
If  said  needed some help from you and the brothers
'd say blow me
Get the pledges to do it
Evan nods and smiles as exams are passed down his row
- Evan and Kayleigh have just finished having sex
She seems incredibly satisfied, but he looks slightly uncomfortable
Oh my God, that was good
Where'd you learn all those new tricks
So it didn't feel
weird
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird
She giggles and snuggles into him
He's grateful for her affection, but still looks uneasy
The   and he automatically answers it
Yellow
Silence on the other end
More silence
Fuck 'em
As Evan hangs up, he and Kayleigh share a giggle and he resumes snuggle position
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect
Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after moved away
(laughs) As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you
What's he gonna do to me
Evan smiles to himself
And hugs her tighter
You think we'll always be together
For the first time she looks at him with concern
That is the plan, right
Hell or high water
He's in heaven, but plays it cool
Just making sure
: -   - The pledges of Theta Chi busily gather around Evan, their clothes covered in dirt, food and what might be vomit
Evan, now dressed like his usual self, bangs a wooden spoon on a metal salad bowl that a poor    wears as a hat
Order, order
So all you rushes know what you've got to do for me
(correcting him) Pledges, Sir Brother Evan, Sir
Pledges, rushees, same difference
Now this is a one-time deal
You do all this for me and 'll never give you shit again
Promise
buzz of excitement runs through the pledges
: -   - It's peaceful now
Evan covers Kayleigh's eyes with his hands as he leads her through the attic hallways
Both are dressed to the nines
don't understand, where are you taking me
You'll see
-  - The wooden door to the rooftop swings open, revealing Kayleigh and Evan
Kayleigh is dazzled by what she sees: The entire roof is decorated with fairy-lights, Chinese lanterns and hundreds upon hundreds of candles
And elegant romantic table for two awaits them, flanked by twelve (previously seen pledges) who respectfully stare ahead with the utmost class
Two pledges immediately pull out two chairs and stand by
Kayleigh applauds and laughs with delight
don't know what to say
It's beautiful
Go on
Sit down
As she takes a step toward the table --   shower down on her
She looks up to see    standing on ladders, delicately tossing pedals
Kayleigh looks overwhelmed as she sits down
Why are you doing all this for me
Simple math
When  woke up this morning and saw your smile
knew that  wanted to spend the rest of my life with you
Her hand reaches out to his and grabs it fiercely
Her eyes tell him she feels the same way
magical moment
And they lean into each other for a kiss so enchanted it might as well be their first ever -- Hunter bolts up the stairs, two at a time
We been lookin' all over for you, man
Someone trashed your car
The moment's gone
Evan and Kayleigh exchange worried looks
-   - Evan runs down the front lawn to his car, the Honda parked at the bottom of the hill
His face collapses
Evan's car has been trashed and is surrounded by broken glass
The seats and tires have been slashed, the hood has been mysteriously yanked off and the steering wheel sits on the roof
The most unnerving thing, however, is a hangs off the rearview mirror
By now a crowd has gathered
Evan runs up to people
(panicked) Did you see who did this
You see anyone
No one will answer with anything more than a shrug
Probably them Pika fuckers
But Kayleigh knows better
She stares at the collar
How could he get away with this
Right in front of the goddamn frat house
angrily calls him from the lawn
Frat house
Hey man, would you call your "country" a "cunt"
Kayleigh shudders and Evan puts his arms around her
Don't
He's probably watching
- '  - Evan leads Kayleigh into his bedroom and shuts the door
Evan can't help but look under the bed
No one
He then locks the door, reaches into his desk and finds a tiny canister of Pepper Spray
It's my fault
should have told you he was released a few weeks ago
Might'a been nice
(re: pepper spray) Like this is gonna do any good
Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun
Please, Evan
Don't even joke
He wouldn't hurt you
He's just trying to scare you away from me
(shaking the cannister) Yeah, right
Tell that to Crockett
(quietly) It's not his fault, Evan
You knew how bad he had it when we were kids
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine
(quietly) My father never laid a hand on me
It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy
Evan sits in silence for a moment, contemplating this
Kayleigh's eyes plead for him to have compassion
Fine, then
We'll let campus security deal with him
- Kayleigh and Evan walk through the all-but-deserted campus
Evan seems especially paranoid
In the distance, some guy vomits loudly
Are you okay
What do you mean
It's just
you've been acting kinda strange, you know
Like how
don't know
You seem
different
You make weird jokes
Your accents changed
You don't even walk the same
walk differently
can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off
Even the dinner tonight
It was beautiful, but
know 've been actin strange lately
It's just that
don't want anything to happen to us
The guy along the path gags loudly into the bushes
Kayleigh and Evan instinctively avert their eyes
Suddenly, Kayleigh's ears perk and she stops walking mid-stride
Wait
Something's not right
Isn't that your jacket
What
The guy, wearing Evan's brown suede jacket, suddenly springs to his feet, revealing his face for the first time
Tommy
Tommy has grown in the last seven years
He has long, greasy hair and some tattoos
He holds a   (a short, steel bat for truckers) menacingly in his right hand
Evan stands frozen in fear, his hands rooted in his coat pockets
Leave us alone you sick fuck
Get this "us" shit
As if  was gonna lay a hand on my own sister
You've done nicely for yourself, Evan
Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister
Not a bad piece of ass if  say so myself
Shut up, Tommy
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment
Tommy takes a few practice swings with the tire thumper
What the hell are you doing
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think  was a piece of shit
(suppressing panic) No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy
Right, Evan
believe you just said "sick fuck
" Tommy rushes Evan and bashes him with the tire thumper in the shoulder and ribs
Evan goes down
As Tommy prepares to bash his brains in, Evan whips out the Pepper Spray and nails Tommy in the face
Tommy reels back in pain, covering his eyes with this free hand
Evan struggles to his feet and circles around Tommy, keeping a distance as he douses Tommy with Pepper Spray
Kayleigh screams
Tommy blindly stumbles around, madly swinging the tire thumper
Evan charges forward in an uncontrollable rage, rips the weapon out of Tommy's hands and sprays a lethal dose of pepper spray into Tommy's open mouth
Evan, stop
You're gonna kill him
He's a fucking maniac
Evan knocks Tommy down with the tire thumper
Kayleigh screams and tries to hold Evan back, but he easily wrestles free of her
She runs to a blue streetlight on the quad
He ruined Lenny's life -- Evan kicks Tommy hard in the ribs
Kayleigh pushes a button on the "Blue Light" lamp post and an
He killed Crockett -- (kicks him) Murdered that woman and her baby
(kicks again) And he's trying to kill me, Kayleigh
He's trying to fucking kill me
Evan raises the tire thumper for a final attack and swings down
Evan sees what he's done and drops the weapon, horrified
Kayleigh sees what Evan's done to her brother
And stops cold when she sees the damage to Tommy
Evan rushes toward her and she stumbles backwards, still terrified by his rage, and skitters away from him in a crablike fashion
come racing to the quad
Evan looks away from Tommy's limp body
Collapses to the ground and begins to weep
: - pulls through the ominous metal gates of the large state prison
The vehicle stops and Evan, along with nine other convicts, exit in leg and hand restraints
- Evan, now wearing his standard issue inmate uniform, enters the General Population area of the prison
begin screaming vicious taunts and catcalls at the fresh batch of new inmates
Evan tries to keep composed and walks toward his cell
Evan looks up to see one of the men leaning over the second tier, , a huge muscular con with tattoos of swastikas and other Nazi symbols on his arm, blows a kiss at Evan and winks
'  - Evan enters a dimly lit cell plastered with pictures of Jesus Christ and various Saints
Burning flames on open cans of shoe polish serve as candles to the large shrine
There is a stained bare mattress on the top bunk
Sitting on the bottom bunk is , 30s, a massive Hispanic convict covered with faded Indian ink jail tats of Christ in agony
Carlos stares at Evan disinterestedly as Evan makes up his bed on the top bunk
First time
Evan nods glumly
Best not bitch up
Wind up someone's luggage that way
(desperate) Can you protect me
Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood
When they come, just put your mind in another place, man
Be somewhere else
Carlos leaves the cell without another word
- Evan sets his tray down at a table filled with Carlos and some other
No sooner has he sat down to eat, do eager forks reach onto his tray and steal his food
Carlos shrugs at Evan and offers him a roll
- Andrea sits across from Evan in the visitor's chamber
Her hair is now bottle-blonde
Four inches of Plexiglas separate the two and they talk on monitored phones
Andrea, frazzled, twirls an unlit cigarette
spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal
He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient
How long will  be in here
don't know
These things take time
How's Kayleigh doing
She all right
Andrea's look tells him to look for hope elsewhere
What about my journals, Mom
Did you bring the ones  asked for
Andrea nods, holding up two comp books
" 7" and " 13"
found these
The others are still in storage
Damn it, Mom
told you  need them all
Fine
You'll get them, Evan
But think it's far more important to focus on your case right now
Evan looks as if he's about to disagree with her, but he closes his mouth and placates her
Sure, Mom
You're right
Just try to tell Kayleigh 'm sorry
And officer signals Evan and points to his watch
'm not gonna lose you, kiddo
Promise me you'll hang on, Ev
They look at each other and Evan slowly lowers the phone
He hangs up, Andrea still pressing her phone to her ear
- Evan walks closely behind Carlos through a corridor, clutching his journals
As he passes Karl, the Neo-Nazi, Karl reaches over and firmly grabs Evan's crotch
Evan, totally violated, turns white with rage
Shit on my dick or blood on my knife
Evan stands there, stunned, unable to react when -- Another Neo-Nazi, , swats Evan's journals out of his hands and onto the floor
Life springs back into Evan as he rushes for the journals
He and Rick grab the journals at the same time
minor tug of war
Let go
They're mine
Rick tears them away, Evan coming up with only a few torn pages
Evan sees the damage and goes mental
Motherfucker
Evan swings at Rick and misses
It's on
Rick lunges for Evan, a brief and painful scuffle ensues, the journals getting trampled
Suddenly -- The sounds of echo through the air
The fight stops instantly as Rick and Evan look up to see -- Officers aim rifles at the pair
From an upper tier, even more officers with more rifles
Their barrels sight directly at Evan
Rick steps away, quick to maliciously scoop up Evan's torn journals
We'll be comin' for you tonight, sister
Evan catches his breath, then looks at the remaining few pages on the floor
'  - Evan enters the cell with a few entry pages
He looks through them
Nothing there
Evan nods depressed, then sees the page from his "Age 7" journal, grabs Carlos' duct tape and tapes the page over his bed
- Evan, walking toward some White Supremacists, flinches whenever the occasional  brushes against him
Evan is completely paranoid, waiting for an inevitable attack
Karl makes himself visible among them, holding a journal
He reads: (from Evan's journal) Today  found my grandfather's death certificate
He died in a nut house, just like my father
Mom denies it, but she thinks 'm gonna end up the same way
The other Supremacists start laughing and calling "looney" and "nut job
" Evan rushes past them and they make chicken clucks at him
- Evan and Carlos sit on  that overlook the other prisoners working out
Evan closely watches Karl and Rick who stare daggers at him from across the yard
with a white-taped handle to Karl but no officers seem to notice
Evan slides closer to Carlos and stares at the Jesus Christ tattoos all over Carlos' back
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways
" Straight up
Because  think he sent me to your cell on purpose
For you to help me
Shit
knew you were crazy
ain't bullshitting
Jesus speaks to me in my dreams
Carlos scoffs whatever
Pack of smokes says  can prove it to you
Carlos is suddenly interested
'  - Evan holds a tattered journal entry in his hand and finishes up a conversation
Carlos looks dumbfounded
So when 'm out,  need you to watch my face and hands closely
You need to see the prison shrink, man
Their conversation stops when a convict rolls a mail cart by, Evan looking up expectantly
Anything today
Yep
Just not for you
Disappointed, Evan turns back to Carlos
Holds up his journal entry
Just tell me if anything weird happens
Weirder than this
Marks, scars,  dunno
Anything could happen  guess
Evan studies the page
"On Wednesday  got in trouble for a drawing that  didn't do
Mommy wont let me see it
" Then as he starts reading it to himself, the bars behind him almost imperceptibly  -- : -  - 1989 Evan, seven,   in an old familiar place
are back in Mrs
Boswell's first grade class
All of the children draw colorful pictures
Evan sees some paper spindles sitting on Mrs
Boswell's desk
As he heads over to them, Mrs
Boswell firmly grabs his shoulders and steers him back to his own desk
No monkey business, Evan
Sit still and finish your drawing
Evan, defeated, looks over at his blank piece of paper
He smiles mischievously, and grabs some colored pencils
That's great everyone
Just imagine anything you want to be
There are no limits
Soon enough, an image emerges: Evan holding a knife, stands over a heap of several dead inmates Karl and Rick
When done, he sneaks over to Mrs
Boswell's desk, where the two paper spindles sit
The metal needles reach up and skewer a number of paper notes and messages
Evan looks over to see Mrs
Boswell holding up his drawing, horrified
(musically) Oh, Mrs
Boswelllllllll
She looks over in time to see Evan using all of his seven- year old strength to  his hands down toward the spindles
The moment before his palms reach them there's a brief instant where   and the world behind him
'  : '   -  - 2002 Evan comes to as
Alertness slowly creeps back up on him as he hears: Oh sweet Jesus
It's true
It's a miracle
miracle
Evan looks up to see Carlos staring at him with reverence
Your hands
The stigmata
Evan looks to see two scars in the center of each palm
What did you see
What did it look like
(laughing) Signs of the Lord
They just appeared out of nowhere
thought you were loco
So you believe me
Carlos simply stares at him, awestruck, and hands over a box of cigarettes
'  - Evan nervously approaches
of Aryans block his path
want to make a deal
The Aryans laugh, make discrete eye contact with Karl, who grins and signals to let Evan pass
'  - Karl and Rick wait expectantly as Evan nervously enters
They say nothing, relishing the fearful silence
Look
'm new to all this but  think get how things work
You gotta join a gang or else end up dead meat
They continue to stare
Well it sure ain't gonna fucking be with no niggers or spics
So how do we do this
You gotta work your way up, and 'm the new guy
(looking ill) So
should
mean, do  suck your dicks right now
Karl and Rick exchange looks
Is your blood pure
(angry) ain't no fucking kike if that's what you mean
Rick stands
All muscle
Let's see what you got
And watch the fucking teeth or you'll be leaving without 'em
Evan nods reluctantly and peacefully drops to his knees
Karl and Rick lower their pants to their ankles
Evan looks miserable, about to do the deed when --  bulldozes past the Aryans into the room, slamming Karl into the wall and jamming a shank into Karl's crotch
Rick instantly charges Carlos, but trips on the pants around his ankles
Evan, anticipating Rick's fall, stomps Rick's face before snatching his journals from Karl's shelf
Evan frantically flips through them, hunting for something, as the other   charge the cell
Carlos
Carlos drops Karl's writhing body to the floor and presses his girth against the cell door
Evan locates an entry and concentrates on the words just as the other supremacists force the door open -- Evan focuses on the words
Chanting quickly
We took the woods behind the junkyard just to make sure we wouldn't bump into Tommy
We hadn't seen the smoke yet
from the entry begin to break the sound barrier and the image of Aryans storming the cell behind him become a : -  - 1995 Evan, thirteen again, comes to in the woods
Evan stumbles at first, then rights himself
He seems strangely exhilarated
sinister victory smile
Rot in hell you fucking animals
Kayleigh and Lenny, walking by his side, do a double take
Evan shrugs "just kidding" and looks around, getting his bearings
He whips his hand out and stops them
Wait
Before we -- He suddenly notices Kayleigh who now no longer looks an awkward and unkempt tomboy, but rather a vibrant and feminine young girl
Whereas her clothes were loose and unflattering before, she is now radiant and wears fashionable styles
Evan remembers his mission and darts over to a
We need something to cut open the sack
Kayleigh and Lenny stare at him, concerned for his sanity
Evan roots through the trash until he finds something: a razor sharp piece of metal about two feet long
Evan offers it to Lenny
want you to take this, Lenny
Today's your day of atonement know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby -- Evan
Stop it
It's not the time
(frantic) Now's the only time
(to Lenny) Today you get a chance to redeem yourself
Start over with a clean slate
Tabula rasa -- What are you talking about
You're acting crazy
(desperate; to Lenny) Please
If you've ever trusted me before, trust me on this one
Evan places the metal shard in Lenny's hand
Cut the rope
Lenny slowly follows Evan as he bolts away
- Evan groans on the ground, writhing
Tommy's voice hitches, eyes watering from pent up frustration
Listen to me good, Evan
'll do whatever you want
You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine
Just let Crockett go
Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure
And  know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father
Evan's words hit home and Tommy's anger slowly dissipates look of understanding passes between them
Gratitude, even
Tommy looks at the sack and begins to untie it
Lenny comes screaming from nowhere like a bat out of hell
With all of the force he can muster, he jams the metal shard all the way through Tommy's throat
Tommy clutches his throat, gagging in blood
Evan surveys the scene in shock: Oh fuck, Lenny, no
Lenny drops to the floor, Indian style, wipes the dirt in his hands and freezes up completely
Kayleigh wakes up and when she sees blood spurt from Tommy's throat
Meanwhile, Crockett escapes from the sack
' Lenny, silhouetted by the sky, seems to vibrate violently as if operating a jack-hammer
: - '  -  - 2002 Evan comes to in a familiar place
His original college dorm - Christ
Help me
He sits upright in bed and takes in his surroundings
When suddenly, Evan clutches his head in severe pain
: - Color memories of Kayleigh's sorority fade to  and and dissipate
-  - 2002 Memories of Evan's vandalized car fade to  and and dissipate
-  - 2002 The faces of Karl and Rick all turn grainy
- '  -  - 2002 As new images of  become more
-   -  - 2005 new image overwhelms the others: Lenny, 13, with dark, soulless eyes wearing a straight-jacket in a padded room
: '  -  - 2002 Evan's eyes roll back in his head
He shakes uncontrollably and blood pours from his nose
Thumper opens the door, sees Evan convulsing and jumps back in horror
He scans the hallways for assistance
Someone call 9-1-1
- Evan lies on an examining table undergoing another series of -scans
The machines are now state of the art and the lab room has been redecorated
'  - Andrea nervously chews her fingernails as she watches Dr
Redfield post -scan results on the light box
young nurse pushes Evan, in a wheelchair, into the doctor's office
Okay, doc
What's the damage
How much time have  got
Cute, Evan
It's a little complicated
haven't seen results exactly like these before
Are you sure
Not even with my father
Dr
Redfield and Andrea exchange looks
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago
So what did you find
Dr
Redfield points to the -scan slides, specifically, to the outer lining of Evan's brain
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging
The outer lining of the cerebral cortex
(nonplussed) Lemme guess
Would that be where the memories are stored
Dr
Redfield stares ahead
Transfixed by the slides
've never seen anything like this
've compared these to the ones taken last year, and there's evidence of severe hemorrhaging and massive neural reconstruction
Andrea stares at him blankly
Evan impatiently "pops wheelies" in the wheel chair
What does that mean for Evan
(to Andrea) He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year
Overload city
'Sat about the gist of it, doc
Dr
Redfield nods, awed by Evan's effortless interpretation
Evan springs out of the wheelchair and stretches his legs
(to Andrea) Mind if  wait in the car
The lighting here bugs my eyes
Andrea nods
Evan shakes Dr
Redfield's hand
Well, it's nice seeing you again
But you know, people to see, things to read
Andrea shoots Dr
Redfield an apologetic look
Evan heads out the door, accidentally knocking Dr
Redfield's jacket to the floor
He shrugs apologetically and re-hangs it
- Outside the office, Evan inspects Dr
Redfield's  and attached   and smiles
Evan covertly winds himself through the maze of corridors, careful not to be seen by the staff
He finally sees a wing marked " "
Evan looks around to make certain he's not being watched, then uses the security card to open the door
He looks in every room of the wing until he finds -- - '  - Evan unlocks the door and is moved by what he sees
Lenny is strapped onto a metal bed, his arms and legs in tight leather restraints
The dark five o'clock shadow and his malicious grin radiate evil
His black and haunting eyes personify hate and murderous intent
Lenny seems neither surprised or happy to see Evan
That is, if he's aware of Evan's presence at all
Is there anything you need
Anything can get you
Nothing from Lenny
What about the models, man
Bet can get you a shitload of models up in here
Still nothing
Not even a glance in his direction
Evan sighs and gives up
Okay, Lenny
Just wanted to say "hi"
Evan turns around to leave
You knew the whole time, didn't you
(Evan spins around) When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen
Didn't you
(jaw dropped) yes
guess  did
Lenny's eyes seethe with hate
Then you should be where  am
You should be where  am
Evan backs away, face guilt-stricken
'  - Evan enters his dormroom (where everything's backwards), reaches under his bed and is relieved to find the journal marked " 7"
- Evan is ignored by several Theta Chi pledges as he plops himself by a tree and hunts through his journal to find the entry from when he was seven and visited Jason at Sunnyvale
"Today  get to mete my father
His name is Jason and he is crazy
hope he lets me call him dad
" Evan takes a calming breath and begins reading
(as if reciting a mantra) Today  get to meet my father
His name is Jason and he is crazy
Evan gets some strange looks, but continues
As he does, the trees and frisbee-playing students behind him  and : '  -  - 1989 Seven-year old Evan comes to during the time he first met his father, Jason
Jason waits patiently for young Evan to finish his sentence
Are you okay
You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there
Look, Jason,  need some fast answers if 'm ever gonna fix what 've done
Jason is completely thrown
was praying this curse would have ended with me
But it didn't
And now  need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me
(frustrated) There is no "right"
When you change who people are, you destroy who they were
Who's to say you can't make things better
Jason seems extremely upset to hear Evan say this
You can't play God, son
It must end with me
Just by being here, you may be killing your mother
Bullshit
'll send you a postcard when 've made everything perfect again
Jason launches himself across the table, shackles and all, and grabs hold of Evan's throat
' As Jason looks down at us, frothing at the mouth, there's a trick of the light where Jason's head seems to  against the ceiling
: -  - 2002 Evan's hands instinctively reach for his throat, then he realizes his surroundings
Heartbroken, he shuts the journal and stands up shakily
- Evan eats in the same diner where Kayleigh used to work
As he eats, his arm sits in front of his plate, protectively
Guarding his food
Just get out, didja
Huh
(re: his arm) Nothing
Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that
(defensively) come from a big family
Meant no offense
None taken
Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here
(confused) Sorry
Never heard of her
- Evan slowly walks up the driveway, which is now a dilapidated mess
Garbage litters the front lawn and paint chips rot off the sides of the house
Inside, Mr
Miller yells at someone
Just shut the hell up already
Can't a man get a little goddman peace in his own home
(Evan rings doorbell) Oh, for Christ's sake, now what
Mr
Miller opens the door and sees Evan
Don't suppose you're here to sell cookies
In a blur, Evan grabs Mr
Miller's shirt and violently shoves him through the house and into a wall
Good guess, fuckbag
(off Miller's startled face) Remember me now
We had a great chat once when  was seven
Mr
Miller goes slack, his eyes wide with horror
One question, fuckbag
Where can find your daughter
- Evan walks past some junkies and enters
- Evan steps over some passed out bodies that litter the hallway of an incredibly seedy motel
The kind with hourly rates
He knocks on a door
Kayleigh, now haggard, strung-out junkie, opens the door and immediately the contempt for Evan grows in her eyes
She puts out an expression of disappointment
Oh,  thought you were my eight o'clock
Make it fast, 'm expecting someone
Nice to see you, too
Can  come in
She looks around, waves him in
If  knew you were coming 'd have cleaned the stains off the sheets
'    - The room is dirty and sparse, excepting charred-bottom spoons, yellowed cotton balls and brown-spotted squares of tin foil
Evan doesn't hesitate to sit on the "soiled" bed
What do you want
Evan can't speak
His eyes begin to water
just needed to see
a friendly face
His sincerity touches her
Well, time is money, Evan
So you
Evan reaches for his wallet and throws it on her dresser
Kayleigh eyes the wallet
But makes no move to pick it up
Well,  guess  can spare ten minutes for an old friend, right
Tears fall freely from Evan's eyes
So how's tricks
Sorry, occupational humor
get it
You can drop it now
(angry again) Oh, 'm sorry
Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious
No
Just that you need to hurt me with it
've been where you've been
Ha
Where's that
The bottom
When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack
Kayleigh watches Evan silently
What's happened to you
You wouldn't believe me
mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying
've seen some sickening shit don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case
Why's that
Because you're
different
Different
How
Let me ask you a question
Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years
Yeah
On the bridge
How did you know that Tommy had your dog
That was no fucking hunch
Do you remember when  was a kid and had those blackouts
Evan continues and Kayleigh listens with a mixture of intense interest and matched skepticism
: - Kayleigh finishes a plateful of food at a busy diner
She lights up an after-dinner smoke
You're right, Evan,  don't believe you
never thought you would
That's why 've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why  never will again
'm the only person you've told
That's a great line
Does that make other girls swoon
Do they actually eat up this bullshit
couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly 'm too tired to prove it to you
Oh
There's proof now
(tired) Shit
dunno
How would  know about the twin moles on your inner thigh
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that
Then forget that
How about
you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister
Kayleigh's jaw drops
Oh
And when you orgasm, your toes go numb
'm sure your clientele aren't privy to that one
Kayleigh tries to conceal the surprise in her eyes
just thought you should know
Know what
That  didn't leave you there to rot
Kayleigh flinches as if her should had been invaded, then her eyes fill with distrust and contempt
There's one major hole in your story
Which is
There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that  was in some fuckin' sorority
She opens Evan's wallet and leaves a twenty on the table
Sure you don't want your wallet
Don't think 'll need it where 'm going
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it
Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while  wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act
'm over it
Whenever  try to help anyone it all turns to shit
Well, don't give up now, Slick
You've already done so much for me
Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs
Halpern and her baby
Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family
She gets up and puts on her coat
Oh, here's one
Go back when 'm seven and fuck me in front of Daddy's handicam, you know, straighten me out a bit
She tosses his wallet over her shoulder at him and leaves
'  - Evan enters his familiar looking dorm and hears the familiar sounds of Thumper having sex with another naked  - On Evan's bed
Get out
Both of you
Sorry, dude
Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all
Evan's temper flares and he picks up a chair and  it against a wall above Thumper's head
'm not saying it again
Thumper and the co-ed quickly cover themselves in the blankets and leave
Alone in the room, Evan looks under his bed and breathes a sigh of relief to see all of his journals are intact
He sifts through them again
He finally finds the passage he needs
Something catches the corner of Evan's eyes and he turns to examine it
To the left of Thumper's Buddha statuette sits a large that bears a portrait of Jesus Christ
(humble) Lord give me the strength and guidance need to set things right
As he begins reading a passage to himself, backward at us from another time and place
And the entire around him -- : '  -  - 1995 Evan comes to as he, Kayleigh, Lenny and Tommy -- all thirteen -- watch Mrs
Halpern carry her baby back to the mailbox across the street with intense anticipation
Evan suddenly comes to life and makes himself visible, running across the street shouting
Lady, stay back
Don't go near the mailbox
Mrs
Halpern, startled, stares at the young kid skeptically as she absently continues toward the mailbox
mean it, woman
Get the hell back
Lenny comes running across the street to Evan's aid, and Tommy shrugs and follows after him
There's a bomb in the mailbox
Get away
Tommy, still running, cringes to hear Lenny's stupid confession and rolls his eyes at the situation
Evan positions himself between Mrs
Halpern and the mailbox, frantically waving his hand at her to stay back, because she's 'll save you lady
Tommy takes a running dive at Mrs
Halpern, perhaps a bit too hard, and sends her and the baby to the pavement, hurt, but no major injuries
Seeing things are safe, Evan backs away from the mail -- The blast is deafening
Evan's body is hurled backwards dramatically
: '  -  - 2002 Evan comes to back in his dorm, the same posters are on the wall, the sheets are the same
Even the familiar sounds of Thumper having sex under the covers
thought  told you two to beat it
Evan's face falls as he hears a familiar voice, but not Thumper's
What
Hey, sorry, man
We wake you up
Evan is confused by Lenny's presence, but smiles to himself and shakes his head "no"
No, it's cool
(re: Lenny's okay) Really cool
Evan yawns, bringing his hand to his mouth, but there's no hand
No arm, really, either
Just two
Evan bolts upright in bed and stares down at his amputations
: We see countless and brief image flashes of Evan growing up from the age of thirteen with  , and requiring a -  - 1995 Tommy and Kayleigh load popcorn and drinks onto Evan's lap as Lenny pushes the wheelchair
'  -  -  - 1995 Evan celebrates his 14th birthday and blows out the candles
Andrea, Kayleigh, Tommy and Lenny all clap
-  - 1995 Tommy pushes Evan to church
'  -  - 2002 Evan screams as blood pours from his nose
Lenny is out of bed at once to help him
as is
(Now beautiful and natural looking)
: -  - 1999 Lenny and Kayleigh, as teens, sit together with Evan at the far end of the boat
-  - 1999 Evan looks on longingly as Lenny and Kayleigh become lovers in high school
-  - 1999 campfire
Evan sips from a   as Lenny and Kayleigh make out in plain sight with Tommy's bashful approval
: -  - 2002 Evan's in agony as Kayleigh opens a series of dorm doors and Lenny rushes Evan's wheelchair through
Kayleigh carries a pair of prosthetic arms in her hands
Evan moans and tries to rub his temple with his stump
Where are we going
We have to get you to Sunnyvale
You're having one of your famous hemorrhages
Stop
Take me back
Sorry, tough guy, no can do
Your mother would kill me
Evan launches his body forward and spills clumsily out of the wheelchair
Lenny must halt in order not to crush Evan
As Evan writhes about on the floor, his legs paralyzed, a Evan focuses on Lenny, but it's hard to ignore the crowd that titters and snickers in the background
Take me back, Lenny
(teeth clenched) You owe me that much
Kayleigh turns to face the jeering crowd
What are you geeks looking at
Must be nice to be so goddamned perfect, huh
Fucking losers
The crowd breaks up and leaves
- It's calm now
Lenny and Kayleigh push Evan's wheelchair around the quad
Evan now wears prosthetic arms
Random call out to Lenny
He's extremely popular in this world
'Sup, Sheila
We missed you at the party
Don't even think 'm giving you my lab notes either
Think like getting up for "eight thirty's"
Lenny pushes Evan past Thumper and Cricket
Their conversation stops and they stare at their feet as Evan gets wheeled by
Evan boils to be treated as if he were non-existent
Hey, there's Tommy
Evan spins around in fear
He sees Tommy, clean-cut, and handing out flyers in front of a banner that reads "Campus Crusade for Christ
" Tommy seems good-natured now, working hard and soliciting names for his list
He looks up as Evan rolls along and his eyes brighten to see Evan
did what you said, man
We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til  puke
Tommy frowns and exchanges glances with Lenny, who shrugs and nods back to him
Uh, we should be getting to class now
Forget it
What's the point of Psych now
Tomorrow  could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh
Another exchanged glance
Kayleigh looks at Evan
Let's go for a stroll
Evan allows Kayleigh to roll him away from the others
To the very spot where Evan once killed Tommy
Evan stares at his prosthetic hand which he can "magically" will to open, close, open, close
So Tommy's really into this Jesus kick, huh
Kayleigh looks at him curiously
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs
Halpern and Katie
He saved Mrs
Halpern
Please, the twisted fuck
Kayleigh, now by a bench
Stops and sits
As she casually uses her foot to turn his chair to face her, she pulls out a granola bar and hands it to him
His prosthetic hand crushes it
It crumbles to dust
She seems more confused
Is something the matter
(re: prosthetic arms) Yeah,  think  gotta get these fixed or something
She leans into him, gently feeding him her remaining bar
Kayleigh
Do you ever think about "us
"  mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us
Sure, Evan, why not
You were the first person  really ever cared about
was
That's why when  was little  never went to live with my mother
don't get it
(feeding another bite) When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with
couldn't stand my dad, but  knew if  moved to my mom's 'd never see you again
never knew that
So then you still sometimes think of us
together
It's crossed my mind from time to time
(hopeful) And
Well a lot of things cross my mind
've always been a fast thinker, Ev
can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second
Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit
It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine
Then you think it might have worked out
Why not
But that's not how things wound up
'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend
And there it ends
She looks into his eyes and shrugs almost apologetically
Tears streak down Evan's face as he speaks in a pleading tone
Would it make any difference if told you that no one could possibly love anyone as much as  love you
Kayleigh shakes her head sadly, then suddenly looks up
Evan turns to see Lenny waving her over
She puts her hand on Evan's shoulder, stands and goes to Lenny
Evan can't take his eyes off her
Lenny kissing Kayleigh
In painful slo-mo
Evan turns away, utterly heartbroken
- Evan's stump turns on a
: Evan, fully clothed, lies in a bathtub that's filling with water
Beside the tub, the wheelchair has been tipped over
The water rises past his mouth, to his nostrils -- Evan makes his peace and takes a final breath
And the water spills over the side of the tub
All Evan can do is watch it, still breathing easily through his nose
beat
Then the door opens
Immediately sizing up the situation
You forgot to put the toaster on the edge
Tommy casually turns off the water, then pops open the
The water level lowers to Evan's mouth
But you, Kayleigh and Lenny like toast
And that's really all that matters now
Tommy feels Evan's anguish and plops his ass on the wet floor by the tub
He lays his head onto Evan's shoulder
Evan bristles at first, but finally gives in to his hatred, ultimately resting his own head against Tommy's
Taking the comfort offered
'll get you changed
Visiting hours are almost up
'  - Tommy rolls Evan through a quiet hospital corridor
(looking around) What, did mom get transferred again
Tommy frowns, confused, then rolls Evan into -- '  - Evan is startled to see Andrea hooked up to several 's, an oxygen tank and a respirator
Several oxygen hoses connect to a tracheotomy tube
Tommy smiles and kisses Andrea on the cheek
She tousles his hair in return
Evan can hardly speak
As Tommy begins to wheel Evan's chair closer to Andrea's bedside, Andrea utters a faint whisper
Looking
Good
Kiddo
Evan eyes her   as he's wheeled by
(reading) Lung cancer
Sorry, Mrs
He's been out of sorts lately
Andrea flinches to hear this
Evan stares at her, eyes wide
Right
You started chain smoking after  blew myself up
Evan suddenly seems sick with guilt
There must be a way to fix this
Fix
just need the entry about the blockbuster
Wait, shit, no arms never even got the chance to write it
flicker of recognition registers in her eyes
Is Evan
different
He's just going through some tough times
Mom
Don't cry
can change this
think 'll go check out the chapel
You're
Acting
Like your father
Come on, Mom
Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that 'm nuts
Andrea is shocked
How
Did you
Know that
You told me that on Parents' Weekend
Remember
Wait, that wasn't me
Or you
She uses her left hand to pinch off the air to her oxygen tube and forces herself to speak in a sick,  manner
Just
Like
Jason
Don't worry
'm gonna get you out of here
He pushes a lever and the mechanical wheelchair rolls itself out of the room
Andrea forces her loudest raspy scream
Stop him
Stop him
Stop him
'  - Lenny tears through old cardboard boxes in Evan's closet
Evan watches nearby
Are you sure you even packed it
My mom packed for me
think she sent everything  ever owned
So we'll see
Evan watches Lenny eagerly as he dumps tons of Evan's junk on the floor
Old report cards, books, toys and photo albums fall on the floor
Is this it
Evan beams when he sees Lenny holding his old journal 7
What do you need it for
don't get you lately
Duly noted
Now 'm gonna ask you for one last favor
What
Shhh
need to concentrate on the blockbuster if 'm gonna destroy it
(concerned) Destroy it
If  hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place
Now shhhh
Lenny, utterly baffled, sits back in silence and watches Evan begin reading his journal to himself for a beat
As new sounds
There's a -- : '  -  -  - 1989 Evan comes to in his childhood kitchen
He is only seven years old
He coughs up Lucky Charms that have "magically" appeared in his mouth
On a journal before him is the recently written passage: "Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayley and Tommy will mete there father and see what a real dad is like
" Andrea is nowhere in sight
Evan springs to his feet and flexes his real hands triumphantly
Yes
Now how do  destroy the blockbuster
He rummages through the utensil drawer and pulls out a large butcher knife and grabs it
He tucks it into his sock but it won't fit
He's still debating what to do when: and is startled by the unexpected sight of Evan holding a huge knife
Evan sees her but remains expressionless
Andrea's face blanches
Evan
What are you doing with that knife
: '  -  - 2002 Evan comes to to find Lenny still staring at him
Waiting for something big to happen
Well, that didn't work
Evan flips a single page of his journal and tries again
He reads to himself, then relaxes his head -- : '  -  - 1989 Evan, seven again, stands in the basement dressed in his Robin Hood costume as Mr
Miller prepares for the sex scene
Now in this part of the story, Robin Hood just married Maid Marian and they have to kiss and stuff like grown-ups do
Kayleigh giggles
There seems to be a new glint of intelligence in Evan's eyes as he adjusts to his new surroundings
Wait
need my belt
Mr
Miller is puzzled, but watches Evan  to the fireplace
(overly childlike) Loo loo, skip to my loo
Loo loo, skip to my loo
Mr
Miller puts his eye back to the viewfinder as Evan quickly finds Mr
Miller's old army thermos in the bottom drawer of the dresser, opens it and shakes out the blockbuster
Loo, loo, skip to my loo
He tries to crack it with his own hands, but his seven-year old body is too weak
Hey kid, don't bother with the belt
Mr
Miller finally turns around and sees Evan banging the blockbuster on the table
Shock registers in Mr
Miller's eyes and he takes a step towards Evan
Back off, fuckbag
Mr
Miller freezes on that, and Evan smiles at him
Amazing
That word never fails to make an impression with you
Mr
Miller takes a slow, non-threatening step toward Evan
Easy does it, Evan
Don't be a bad boy or 'll tell mommy you were naughty
And 'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors
One step closer and 'll shove this up your ass
Kayleigh's mouth hangs open with utter amazement at the scene
Tommy, hiding at the top of the stairs, slowly creeps down to get a better view
Evan rummages in the bureau and finds the wooden "strike anywhere" matches used at thirteen to light his cigarettes
That's dangerous
You could blow your hands off
Been there, done that
Evan, standing near the fireplace, defiantly strikes the match with this thumb and lowers the flame to the short fuse
Mr
Miller charges Evan just as the fuse is lit
Mr
Miller knocks the blockbuster from Evan's hand and it rolls towards the other side of the room, resting peacefully against the video camera
Kayleigh's eyes are dazzled by the sparkling fuse and she bends down to pick it up -- // Kayleigh
NOOOOOooooo
'  -  - 1989 The blast is deafening
: - '  -  - 2002 Evan, twenty, wakes up with a bloody nose
Oh God, Kayleigh
Evan gets a new series of   and
-  - 1989 Evan (now seven) is institutionalized before a judge
-  - 1989-1994 Evan (seven through twelve)   in an institution
'  -  - 1989-1994 Evan undergoes years of therapy under Redfield's care
: '  -  -  - 2002 Evan lies in a room, same posters from college adorn the walls
Blood flows freely now
(sobbing uncontrollably) Kayleigh
no
You can't die again
won't let this happen
won't
Evan fights off the pain and looks under his bed for something
Where are they
His journals are missing
He runs from the room
'  - Evan runs into Dr
Redfield's office just as another patient is leaving
Hey, Evan
What's the big rush
We don't meet for another hour
Where are my goddamn books
Books
My journals
Where are they
The doctor looks heartbroken, as if Evan has had a relapse
It kills me to have to go through this again
There are no journals
There never were
It's part of this fantasy world your mind created to cope with the guilt of killing
Evan looks stunned
Refusing to believe it
Think Evan
You've invented a disease that doesn't exist
Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia
But
need those books
You remind me of your father
He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one
Photos
Evan's eyes roll back and he collapses lifelessly to the floor
- Evan lies on a platform and gets another series of -scans
'  - Evan, no longer incapacitated, stares out the window into the darkness
Alone
Trapped
Hopeless
'  - Later that day, Dr
Redfield posts the new -scan slides on the light box and shudders when he sees the results
Andrea looks on anxiously
Jesus, no
Andrea, biting her nails, is unable to conceal her fear
No dances, just tell me
(devastated) The hemorrhaging
the neural damage is irreparable
'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions
Andrea begins to break down in tears
Evan secretly listens in from the hallway
His gaunt face looks deep in thought
He takes a breath and enters the lab, making sure not to look directly at his weeping mother
Hey, Mom, didja remember to bring those goofy old home movies we used to make
Andrea wipes tears away, nodding in advance
'  - Evan sees no one is watching him in the institution corridor as he throws his weight into the door of the doctor's office, breaking it open
Sporadically, severe  invade Evan's environment, threatening to distract him from his mission
'  - Evan enters the office and tears the file cabinets apart, looking for something
His nose bleeds profusely and he repeatedly wipes the blood off his face with irritation
Evan sees a cardboard marked ,
Grabs it and hides under the doctor's desk
'  - stab through the darkened corridor hunting for him
An
are shouting
'  - Evan, under the doctor's desk, grabs some paper and begins writing in shorthand
If anyone finds this, then  guess my plan didn't work and 'm already dead
Again, the world flutters as if it were attached to a paint- shaker
He takes a deep breath
But  --  can just go back to the beginning of all this,  might be able to save her
Fatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing
'  - Dr
Redfield catches up with the rest of the guards
He's not in his room
Search the grounds
'  - The cardboard box is overturned
Evan finishes threading a -8 film projector and turns it on
Careful not to let any light spill against the wall, Evan projects it at the underside of the desk
We see familiar home movie footage from his childhood: Lenny, 5, has a birthday party
Kayleigh is there
' Getting lost in the memory
of '  bleed into Evan's reality
The world
: '  -  - 1987 Evan, 5, comes to at a birthday party
He's unexpectedly gently prodded forward by Andrea
Go on, Evan
Introduce yourself
Evan slowly approaches Kayleigh, only five
She smiles bashfully at him
An old memory comes back to him
(
) When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with
couldn't stand my dad, but  knew if  lived with my mom, 'd never see you again
Evan slowly looks around the yard, taking in the reality of this distant memory
He even inhales the aroma of the place
Savoring the moment
He locks eyes with Kayleigh
(
) He's not usually this shy
It's time
Evan leans over to Kayleigh as if he's about to kiss her
Then whispers in her ear: hate you
If you ever come near me again, 'll kill you and your whole family
Kayleigh reacts predictably
Bursting into tears and runs into Kayleigh's mother's arms
' What did you say to her
What happened
Evan ignores them
He can't take his eyes off Kayleigh
Goodbye
His eyes well up
: '  -  - 2002 Evan wakes up with a bloody nose
He grabs a pillow and covers his head with it as a flood of memories seizes him
Lenny (looking fit) grabs a towel from atop an award-winning flatworms project and hands it to Evan
(
) You alright
Should  call the doctor
Evan groans and shakes his head "no"
He rides out the pain like a seasoned pro
When it finally subsides, he lowers the pillow and smiles feebly
'll think 'll be alright this time
(a new hope) really do
Lenny nods, still concerned
-   - Evan opens the door to a concrete room with a large furnace
He and Lenny carry cardboard boxes
You sure about this
Evan nods
They silently dump tons of journals into the fire
Evan steps outside and returns with a box of home movies, photo albums, old report cards, etc
In they go
Burning journals
: -  - 2010 Evan, a suit now, walks down a city street cradling a cell phone to his ear
: (into phone) Yeah, Ma
'm running a little late for lunch
One of my patients had a breakdown
Anyway, order some soup in the meantime
See ya soon
As he clicks off, an attractive woman wearing a power suit approaches from the other direction
Evan has to look closely, but it's Kayleigh
mature woman, now
He stumbles slightly, caught off guard
As she passes, her eyes linger on his a little longer than necessary, but there's no recognition
Evan watches her continue past him and down the sidewalk
After a hesitant beat, he takes a breath, turns around and follows her
Roll credits
