We  "Waltzing Matilde," by Tom Waits
-  ( ) Fade out music
Silence
well-dressed black  and his  walk through several galleries
They stand before Picasso's "Guernica," holding hands
The mother is disturbed
Crying
The boy looks up, confused and frightened, concerned to see his mother crying in public
She looks at him tenderly
Her brow furrows
She stops crying
She stares just above his eyes
Something's happening: she looks with wonder at the top of his head
his eyes roll upward, trying to see - it's a crown
He raises his hands
He touches it
beam of light illuminates the crown, casting its glow on his mother's face
The beam gets whiter, the rest of the screen gets black
Silence
In darkness, we hear a  - imbued with a sense of its own history: (
) Everybody wants to get on the Van Gogh boat
There's no trip so horrible that someone won't take it
The idea of the unrecognized genius slaving away in a garret is a deliciously foolish one
We must credit the life of Vincent Van Gogh for really sending this myth into orbit
How many pictures did he sell
One
He couldn't give them away
We are so ashamed of his life that the rest of art history will be retribution for Van Gogh's neglect
No one wants to be part of a generation that ignores another Van Gogh
The beam of light shines through a small hole
It falls upon a sleeping, dreaming, delighted face
It belongs to ,   filter in
Hearing the voice, Jean frowns at being woken up
- long, rectangular cardboard box
: "  " : (early 30's), seated at a park bench, hunched over a notebook
He's a raggedy dandy:  poet in a hooded sweatshirt and white hightops
As he writes, he reads aloud, as if addressing Posterity
(') (sighing theatrically) In this town one is at the mercy of the recognition factor
One's public appearance is absolute
Beyond him, a  gropes its way out of the box
It tosses a can of  chocolate drink
(') consider myself a metaphor of the public
am a public eye
am a witness
appears from the box
It's Jean's
Jean sees the start of a crisp, colorful autumn day
The urban park around him is alive with a typically full range of the good and bad in life
He eases himself out of the oversize box in which he has spent the night
There's something about the way that he stands while waking up that suggests he's almost surprised at his own body, the adultness of his limbs - just a subtle hint of him coming out of a dream
He squints in the sunlight
He has a soft, gentle, Haitian face
His hair is pulled tight to his head
He wears two pairs of blue jeans (one cut like chaps over the other) a paint-covered Wesleyan University -shirt, and the inside lining of an overcoat
His appearance is unruly, but it's deliberate
He's stylish
He shakes himself off and collects his stuff, which includes: a small book of Pontormo drawings, a can of black spray paint
and a cigar box made into a loudspeaker with pencil holes and masking tape
Jean walks out of the park and looks up past the buildings at the sky: - Jean sees the surfer, 'riding the nose' in glistening, shimmering sunlight
: - Rene grabs the box for use as a desk and continues to speak out loud as he writes
(',
) Part of the artist's job is to get the work where  will see it
- As he speaks, we see Jean pass the wall of a funeral parlor
He spraypaints: "     " (',
) When you first see a new picture, you don't want to miss the boat
You have to be very careful because you may be staring at Van Gogh's ear
Jean signs his words with his 'logo', a triple pointed crown
As he presses the spray can, we  the roar of a breaker
: : Pressed into the concrete is a pair of
light- colored piece of rock completes the picture to make a face
'  - ' : His shoes pause next to the face in the concrete
: Is a   with red plastic magnetized  that reads: "' :   $1
50
" : ' - Jean enters
: '  - The sign
It now reads: "'    $5
00" : '  - Bending over a countertop, we see  , 22
He fixates on her
She looks up and notices his stare
She continues to work
Still staring at her, he sits down at a table
He pours maple syrup onto the table
He draws in the syrup with his fingers
arrives at his table
She's put off by the syrup
What'll it be
Jean thinks about it, eyes still following Gina
Ummm
It'll be great
We'll live together in peace
What's her name
(indicates Gina) He looks up at the waitress
Gina
What'll it be
Pancakes
She leaves and whispers something to Gina
Gina turns and glances over at Jean
Jean pours more syrup and starts writing his name
At the grill, , the burly Owner/Cook, has his watchful eye on Jean
He doesn't like what he sees
Jean smears the syrup thinly, so it doesn't erase itself
He draws a picture of Gina, using his fingers and the silverware, rendering her last expression strikingly with a few quick lines
saunters up to Jean's table
He's sort of a tall Puerto Rican Alain Delon with sleepy eyes
He is
Hey - Willie Mays
Willie Mays
Suddenly, Rene Ricard enters - a one-man parade
He beckons to Gina, snapping his fingers
Nurse
Oh
Nurse
Carrot juice
Tofu burger
Rapido
We don't serve that - amigo
Fine
greasy cheeseburger
Fries - and a vodka
(under his breath) Who's that
The Devil, man
Rene Ricard
Art critic - writes for Artforum
People read him
Tell him who you are
Who am
Oh yeah
Rene lands at the counter
Jean's gaze is still on Gina
She waits on a  at a nearby table
How's the special today
It's your stomach
She hurries past Jean
Hey
She slows down, not wanting to
(') What do you think
She looks at her portrait in the syrup
She can't resist smiling
It's me
've never been done in maple syrup
Here's a rag
Gina smiles
She offers him one
As she holds it out, their eyes lock
She tries to resist his smile
(gently) Gina
She puts her finger in the syrup and licks it off
Benny takes it all in
Leshko is upon them
Alright
Look at you, staring at this girl, making a mess
He waves Jean toward the door
Jean takes Gina's rag and begins cleaning his mess, seemingly compliant
How about those pancakes
He brings out a roll of dimes to the tabletop and splits it open
Dimes roll all over the table and stick in the syrupy parts
The manager explodes
Goodbye
Pipe down, Lech
Let him order
You nuts
Let him order
You on his side
You're not such a good waitress
You get out, too
just don't think you're being fair
need this
need this
Gina quietly removes her apron in disbelief
Benny gets up to leave very casually
(waving g'bye to Jean) Willie Mays
(to Gina) That's right
You go with them
Make babies the government has to pay for
: Leave the restaurant
Behind them, we see Rene, absorbed in his writing
- They stand outside, not knowing quite what comes next
Jean gives Benny a look (i
e
'scram')
Catch you later
Benny leaves
picks up
Jean's mood is suddenly downcast
They button up their overcoats, about to leave
What's a job, anyway
(pause) What's wrong with you
The truth is, he feels awful for causing Gina's trouble, but shows it by moping like a child
(') No, don't tell me - you just got fired by your crazy boss
guess you did
Guess  just got sick of him
Can  walk you home
think  could do that alone
Gina walks away
He runs after her
Wait, 'm in a band
We're at the Mudd Club on Halloween
'll put you on the list
Gina turns and looks back at Jean
hate the Mudd Club
He catches up to her
Gina notices a dead leaf in his hair and picks it out
(') Have you been camping
You could use a scrub
'm clean
Smell me
always smell good don't know why,  just do
He leans forward, offering his neck
(smelling) You do
You definitely do
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday
don't go there
Too many party girls
Party girls
Can  call you
(teasing him) Yeah, if you have any dimes left
477-0496
He writes her number on his pant cuff with a big fat magic marker
Here, this is for you
made this
He hands her the small speaker
She takes it
Thanks
She admires the speaker watches him walk off
(  ) We see Jean crossing a lawn outside a mental hospital
-  /   - fill a cavernous day-room engaged in arts and crafts
Some of the sadder patients stare off into space as Jean crosses the room
He carries a plate of cookies and a full glass of milk
He approaches a sad, nice-looking, middle-aged black woman - the same one from the dream, earlier
She sits alone fondling a pillow in her lap
It's his mother,
She doesn't see him coming
As he sets the plate in front of her, she notices him
She recognizes him and seems pleased, even in her isolation
He kisses her on the cheek
Hey, mom
She smiles slightly
Jean takes a cookie
She does likewise
They eat in silence, looking at each other, communicating what they can
Time passes
In between cookies her fingers find and break the stems of the pillow feathers
(') met the girl 'm gonna marry
His mother brightens
She drinks the milk
They finish the cookies
Do you like it here
'd like it better in Hawaii
- Jean tries to sleep in the box
falls heavily onto it
Drops of water hit his face
He wills it to stop
It doesn't
Finally, he can't stand it
Rain forces his blinking eyes open
'  - door opens to reveal Jean's wet face
Benny lets him in
Jean enters a rundown railroad flat crammed with musical instruments, beer cans, and homemade art
There's a couch with a sheet over it
Junk is piled in a corner - mostly art books and drawings
Benny sits down at an electric piano, which he's evidently playing
He sings along, softly, working out the words, concentrating, absorbed
Jean sets his belongings on the couch, walks to a mic stand and starts making up his own words
"She loves me
Oh yeah she loves me
She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me
" Bring me some chicken, baby
Would you shut the fuck up
You hear what 'm doing
Yeah man
'm jealous
You're always great, Benny
(goes back into 'act') "Her name is --- Gina And she lo-oooves me
" did say chicken
Benny turns off the piano and lights a roach, angry at Jean's self-centeredness
Jean digs through a pile of garbage
Finally, he finds what he's looking for - a pile of " baseball cards" - color Xeroxes of his favorite images and words
He pockets them
(') knew  left these somewhere
One of these'll send your kids to college someday
(hands it to Benny solemnly) Here -  made this for you
Thanks
(beat) Your dad called again - something about a job
He hands Jean a slip of paper
He notices the number on Jean's pants
(') You got a date already
(exhaling) We're getting married
She said she could tell  was a great artist - she could see it in my eyes
She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me
Benny grins
He grabs a basketball and spins it expertly on his index finger
'night
See you in court tomorrow
Jean turns on the
He notices the roach
He picks up the paper Benny gave him with the message from his father and sets it on fire
He lights the roach with it
He looks up; on television, we see a  being interviewed
Jean turns up the volume
The bum's on the ground, looking beat up
Jean picks up a pocket recorder and turns it on: The guy just hit me and  was on the ground
Boom, for real
Jean mutes the sound on the
He rewinds and proudly plays back the words "Boom, for real
" He picks up the phone and dials
He turns on the speakerphone
Jean holds the recorder to the speaker as someone answers the phone
(Jean walks in and out of frame throughout the following
) Hello
(deadpan) -Is this the s-s-suicide h-h-hotline
Yes
My name is Chris
What's yours
Jean Michel
That's a beautiful name
French
Haitian
'm going to kill myself
'm taking pills
Reds, blues, greens
Jean opens his notepad and looks down a long list of seemingly random words
He comes to the words (in order) "liquid, hijack," and "Marlboros
" What
Wait a minute
talk to me
(about to sob) Life doesn't
make
sense
This city's k-killing me
want my liquid hijack Marlboros
What
Life's beautiful
Depression isn't permanent
Don't you believe that
(pause) What is it - did your girlfriend leave you
No
have a boyfriend
He loves me
Jean spies an electric pencil sharpener and plugs it in
You see
You have someone to live for
No,  don't
'm alone
We all are
Especially here
The world's unjust
The respect fools get
The disrespect  get
What is it you want
Respect
have respect for you, just    for making this call
One philosopher said    "Sadness is a sin against the richness    of the world
" Think about it
Feel it
You don't even know me
want real respect
He jams a pencil into the electric sharpener and holds the receiver right next to it, giving the guy an earful: -  speaker
It fills the screen
We continue to hear: (
) (beat) What
What do you want
(breaking loose) Fame
My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it
: - Jean and Benny are on stage with two other , members of the band Gray
Everyone but Jean is dressed in some sort of Halloween costume
We  the words "Boom, for real" blasting from the
system
What follows is a continuation, a collage of words from Jean's "suicide hotline" call - One philosopher said "Give me my liquid hijack Marlboros
Life's beautiful
You have someone to live for
What do you want
That's a beautiful name
French
Jean sits in a chair onstage with his band members
Benny plays the organ
The other band members play percussion and guitar
It works
The crowd loves it
The song ends abruptly
We begin to hear James Brown's "Sex Machine
" Jean looks out into the crowd and notices Gina
She's looking right back at him from the bar
Pleased to see her face, he says to himself - Boom, for real
We see him walk offstage into the crowd
They meet
(') thought you hated this place
do
(beat) just said that
was never here before
actually like it
segues into 's "Public Image"
Let's get out of here
He leads her towards the exit
They step out of the club
- , It's raining heavily
Jean motions for Gina to wait under the entrance
He tries to hail a cab
And another
And another
parade of them passes, but each time they slow down, they get a glimpse of Jean and drive off
Finally, Gina steps out of the entrance
She raises her hand, and a car pulls over instantly
- They scurry into the backseat
The cab pulls off
- Through a steamy, rain-wet window, we see Jean and Gina seated at a table, dining
They seem to be having a nice time
'  - Gina lays in bed
Daylight streams into the apartment
Jackhammers  outside
(Music:   - Errol Scorcher's "Cockroach in de Corner
") cockroach crawls from Gina's bedroom across the floor and into the kitchen where Jean sits naked on the floor, working on a drawing
It crawls over his drawing towards a cardboard box
Jean rummages through a cabinet
He finds a can of bugspray
Jean tears off a side of the box
With cardboard in one hand and bugspray in the other, he forgets the cockroach
He's mesmerized by the list of ingredients on the aerosol can
Someone  furiously at the door
Ignoring the pounding, he starts listing the ingredients on the piece of cardboard, finishing his new drawing by including a symbol of a cockroach to the left of the list
Miss Cardinale
Open up for me, please
He gets up and peeks through the security hole
He sees a middle- aged Hispanic woman reaching to unlock the door
He opens it
(') Ohhh, Dios mio
She stares at him levelly
(') just want the rent
Why didn't you say so
Damn
She's asleep
Jean draws on a piece of paper on the counter next to him
He hands it to the landlady
It's a a little shack with a big head next to it that says "'Here' For Rent
" The landlady looks at him like he's crazy
She balls up the drawing and puts it in her pocket
Gina arrives in the doorway, wearing a robe
The landlady's trapped between them
(to Jean) What're you doing
The landlady wags her finger at Gina
Next Monday
Gina and Jean look amused as they watch her leave
Wanna go get some breakfast
friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery
He's an electrician
was supposed to be there an hour ago
She looks at the bugspray drawing on the floor
(') Ohh, that's nice
Jean kisses her neck as she looks at the drawing
We  on the drawing
- White dust sprinkles down onto Jean's face from the ceiling
Unable to use his hands, he tries to blow the dust out of his eyes
His boss, , a mild-mannered hippie electrician, works above him on the ladder
Jean steadies the ladder
Greg's head is out of frame
The gallery is an impressive space under preparations for an opening
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver
what
Phillips head
From the toolbox
Yeah
Jean searches through the toolbox
He picks up a screwdriver and reads the handle: "" (') 'Phillips head,' right
Yeah
Jean shakes his head and puts it back
He tries a couple more - they each say "
" He puts them back
Finally, he finds one with a different handle
It says "
2000
" You don't have any
That's impossible
've got, like, five of 'em
He comes down off the ladder
(') You're holding one in your hand
(beat) You've never done this kind of work before, have you
(demonstrating) See, this is a regular screwdriver, and this is a Phillips head
The cross thing
'll tell you later what all the tools are so you'll know
of people arrives
Albert Milo    comes into view, tailed closely by Rene Ricard and - well dressed, petite, intense, 30
Milo, (also about 30), wears    casual clothes splattered with paint
Mary Boone is engaged in    conversation with Milo
Rene chatters away
Greg climbs back up the ladder
He holds a piece of wire down to Jean
Jean stares at the group while trying to be invisible
need to make a call, Mary
You don't mind, do you
Certainly not
You can use my line
Rene picks up the phone
To Paris
Bernard Picasso - (to Mary) You know Bernard - (wincing) Be my guest
Jean watches the group talking
Jean
Hold this, please
(beat - he sees why Jean's so distracted) You'll get there
But it's good to have something to fall back on
That's why became an electrician
It pays the rent
'know, 'm an artist, too
didn't know
sculpt
'm really just starting to find myself
How old are you
Twenty
You're just like  used to be
'm forty-one
And 'm glad  haven't gotten any recognition
It gave me time to develop
Jean watches Mary and Milo talking
(to Milo) can't tell you how happy  am with this show
Mary yells across the room to Jean
(') (her tone impersonal) Excuse me - you - what's your name
Would you move those tools there and put them somewhere else
He looks at her
Milo watches to see what he's going to do
(to Milo) My name is Jean Michel Basquiat
Have you heard of me
(amused) No
Should  have
'm a painter, too
Really
Huh
Too bad
Excuse me, would you please move those tools
Jean looks at Milo
Milo looks back at him
Jean walks past the tools and continues toward the door
He walks out without turning around
Milo smiles to himself
-    - The    fills the gallery
Jean lurks across the street, watching through the window
Cabs and limousines line the block
crowd outside blocks the street
Jean's obviously impressed, jealous and estranged -     he feels entitled to all this
He crosses the street to get a closer look
He sees Albert Milo    talking with   and Andy,    of course, is thin, silver-haired, and nearly albino
Bruno    is a Swiss art dealer in his 40's
He exudes money - a pillar of    security
On the other side of the room, Rene Ricard is surrounded by a coterie of young, mostly
Rene looks drunk, enjoying the moment, holding court
Rene crosses to Albert and Andy
People pass by
Jean starts to walk
About half a block away, he sprays on a wall: " " He looks pleased
He turns and looks up West Broadway beyond the buildings at the sky: We see a surfer emerging from a
He looks powerful and exalted
: - :  wall
We see the following graffity: " " basketball bounces against a wall
Jean and Benny amble onto a basketball court
Jean's changed his hairstyle
Now the dreadlocks stand straight up from his head
Benny dribbles with skill while Jean puffs furiously on a cigarette
He doesn't look like he's slept, but he's happy
Benny throws the ball to Jean
It bounces off a puddle and splashes Jean
Come on, Jean
Get rid of your cigarette
Concentrate
am
On Gina
(beat) Fuck -  didn't think we were actually gonna do this
Concentrate on the ball
Shoot
Jean shoots
It flies up, up, up -     and over the backboard
He runs after the ball, gets it, and dribbles clumsily
You're shattering all my myths
About what
Your people
Oh - you mean black people
He shoots and misses again
He throws it to Benny, who does a picture-perfect lay-up
(') (changing the subject) How long do you think it takes to get really famous
During the following, Benny performs a series of amazing shots while Jean looks on admiringly
For a musician or a painter
Jean shrugs
Whatever
Famous
To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else
Ummm
Four years
Six to get rich
He shoots
Swish
(') First, you have to dress right
He shoots again
Swish
(') Then, you have to hang out all the time - with famous people - the right people, the right chicks, the right parties
He shoots again
Swish
(') And you gotta do your work all the time when you're not doing that
The same kinda work, the same style - over and over again, so people recognize it and don't get confused
Then, once you're famous, you have to keep doing it the same way, even after it's boring - unless you want people to really get mad at you - which they will anyway
Benny tosses Jean the ball
Jean walks off the court
Come on
hate this
'm no good at it
Jean shoots the ball and keeps walking
The ball goes in
He doesn't notice
Benny runs after it
- Benny and Jean walk along
Benny dribbles
Famous people are usually pretty stupid
You're too smart
You'd get bored to death
You don't wanna be like John Henry - fighting the machine
Just do what you do
It's about integrity
Follow your heart
Who's John Henry
Oh man
Folklore guy - worked on the railroad
'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track
Then one day they invented a machine to do it
And he says "Fuck that, 'm a " and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track
It takes two days
Neck and neck the whole time
They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike
(pause) Got a cigarette
So then what
He drops dead
See
Just do your shit like you do it
Your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere
It's good
What else do you want
They watch a long stretch limo cruises up across the street
Like  said - my liquid hijack Marlboros
(indicates limo) Check it out
The   opens the back door
Andy Warhol and Bruno Bischofberger step out
(') Andy Warhol
He's famous and he's not boring
:    ' (    ) Jean scrounges in his pockets, pulls out his Xerox cards, and readies himself as Bruno and Andy enter '
What're you doing
You're doing something
He's the best painter in the world
'm gonna give him one of these
Don't give him anything, man
Your art's worth a lot
Trade
That's what real artists do with each other
Besides, he'll just use you
He's famous for that
Benny watches Jean crosses the street
Jean passes the limousine
Inside, the driver (a 24-year old Rasta) takes a hit from a joint and watches Jean
The driver's eyes
: ' : He watches Jean cross the street
Jean enters the restaurant
' - Jean enters
Andy and Bruno spot him
The Maitre'd becomes alarmed
but it's too late - he's at their table
He spreads his cards on the table
The topmost card reads "
" Andy stares dead ahead, Sphinxlike
Bruno watches the non-interaction between the two
' (to Jean, flustered) Can  help you
He taps Jean's shoulder
' (') (to Jean) Sir
(sympathetically) think it's ok
' Of course, Mr
Bischofberger
Bruno picks up one of the cards
You wanna buy some ignorant art
Ten bucks
Ignorant art
Yeah
Like - stupid, ridiculous, crummy art
Ohhh
That's new
That sounds good
Ten bucks apiece
can give you five
You didn't do very much to these
You don't even work on your stuff
It doesn't matter how much you worked on them
It matters how much you can get for them
can get ten
'll take two
This one and
that one
(to Bruno) Can  borrow some money, Bruno
Bruno pulls out a hundred dollar bill
Here
Do you have change
As  arrives with the tray, Jean pockets the bill
You made a good deal
Here, you can have these, too
He leaves all the cards and walks toward the door
' : Jean leaving past stupified Maitre'd
'  - Jean and Benny are outside the entrance to Gina's building
Jean carries two huge bags overflowing with groceries and flowers
He buzzes
There's no answer
'll be right back
He produces a key and lets himself in
He enters the building
'  - Jean sets the groceries on the counter and leaves
We notice the Bugspray painting on the wall, along with more of Jean's work and supplies
'  - Jean rejoins Benny in front of Gina's building
As they're leaving, Gina comes up the street
(to Benny) Check you later, man
Hi Gina
Hi
- '  - Flowers and groceries are strewn on the counter
: Over the following  we : (
) ' 20'
The church bells would ring at noon and six a
m
24 strokes: How many times we counted them
We called our bed the cloud
And there we'd float
The bathtub was in the kitchen and took forever to fill up
We'd bathe together afterwards
Oh the countless cigarettes and take out Chinese food
The bed was so narrow Three years we made it fit
The sheets were green the sheets were pink the sheets white linen from the past
Little home, farewell, The broken windows and the bodega on the corner
Now from my balcony look out over all New York
'  - Jean and Gina are sleeping
: As they're turning together in their sleep
: /  (' ) - Filled with Jean's paintings
: Paintings and objects fill the room
: "       9TH
" : '  - Jean watches "The Little Rascals" on  in the living room
The sound is turned off and a record player  Gypsy music loudly
Rolled up in a large drop cloth, Gina is asleep on the floor
Next to her, Jean works on all fours, drawing figures, crowns, and houses
Working feverishly, he writes ", , " in big clusters, then writes other words: , ,   , , , ,  ,  ,  and
He has an acoustics manual and Bible open    on the floor
He copies the technical blueprints from the manual
He reads the Bible, following the text with a dirty finger
It    seems that he watches , draws, listens to the music and reads    at the same time
He mixes Liquitex paints and puts some colors on the drawings
He draws a long blue line and carries it over onto the floor
Up the wall
Through the fridge
Across the window
He takes off his paint-covered clothes and changes into Gina's black slip
He rummages around the room, gathering pieces of his and Gina's clothes
He spreads the clothes on the floor, and selecting wide brushes with long bristles, picks up the cans of Liquitex paint
When paint spills on the clothes, he spreads it into shapes
Gina wakes up
She reaches for one of the painted shirts
(in disbelief) Basquiat, those are my best clothes
What are you doing
'mon, baby,  painted them for you
They're beautiful now
'm going to my parents this weekend
What am  going to wear
(she begins to cry) How could you do that to me
Jean wipes his hands off on his thighs and puts his arms around Gina, holding her
'll buy you some new ones
You don't have any fucking money
Jean lets her cry for a moment, then notices the music playing on the stereo - a Gypsy song sung in Spanish
Do you know what he's saying
What who's saying
Manzanita
(translating song) if one day  die, and    you read this piece of paper,  want you    to know how much love you
Although 'll    never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your    hair, your hair, your face, your face' Gina looks up at him
(') 'Even though you were never mine And you never will be You have a piece of my heart You have, you have, you have
' (he reaches down, wiping off Gina's face) 'Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face
' No longer crying, Gina leans her head against Jean
We  a  from the window: (
) Willie Mays
Willie Mays
(at the window) Come on in
: Benny and two  come barreling into the apartment
Immediate chaos
Benny holds up a packet of drugs and jiggles it temptingly
They make themselves at home
Jean sits with them and starts to chop up the drugs
Gina gives Jean a look
She stands, still wrapped in the drop cloth
She lets it fall to the floor
She's wearing only her underwear
She walks to the bedroom
Benny watches her
Gina, don't you want any of this
You could use some
Gina doesn't respond
She comes out of the bedroom with a small suitcase
See you later
She leaves
Silence
#1 Nice underwear
They start to laugh
'  - Kneeling on the floor,    Jean    covers the surface    of the refrigerator door with    fast,    rushing strokes
He mixes paint in a large soupbowl and dips    his    hair in the bowl
Pressing his head to the door, he paints    with    his hair
He stops    to examine the marks
He  his head against the door harder and harder
'  - : Revealing Jean's eyes
They're open and motionless
His head is tilted toward his chest
the sounds of Gina coming home: The  turns
The door
Gina comes in and drops a bag on the floor
Basquiat
Silence
She picks up the mail from under the door and walks into the room
There's a lump on the floor
It's Jean
(') Wake up
'm back
She shakes his arm
No result
She lifts his head, revealing his painted hair
She shakes him harder
His body is totally limp
The whites of his eyes are red; his pupils slowly float up, vanishing
Jean, what did you do to yourself
She listens to his breath, then to his heart
(panicking) Jesus Christ
She finds heroin sprinkled into some pot on the floor near him
(slapping his face) Don't do this to me
She shakes him until his eyes unglue
His pupils float into their proper place
What's the matter
(furious) Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me
How the fuck could you do that to yourself
You're back
It's Monday morning
It's not Sunday
missed you
You shouldn't leave me alone
You're blaming me
had to go see my family
'm your family
Basquiat, what did you take
Jean tries to pick himself up from the floor
He gets up stiffly, like Pinnocchio
The long sleep made his limbs wooden
Nothing special - just some weed
He finds an old joint and lights it up
Basquiat, don't lie
(holds up powder) This is smack
You want some
He offers her the joint
'  - Jean and Benny walk along, sharing a beer in a brown paper bag
They approach a   and exchange money for dope
Jean finds a discarded window frame in a pile of trash and carries it with him
They sit down on a stoop
Jean rolls up a dollar bill, empties the dope onto the window, and splits it into two lines
He hands the rolled up bill to Benny, who snorts the line
Benny shakes his head involuntarily, making a violent face, as though the dope burned a hole in his sinus
We got beat
For real
Jean takes a taste with his finger
He tastes his tongue and makes a face
He snorts part of his line, anyway, to make sure
He frowns
They continue onwards
Jean still carries the window
You gonna carry that around all night
Yeah
'll paint on it
- The party's winding down - hip-hop kids, Lower East Side types
Jean and Benny pass through the room, ignoring the two or three clusters of people - maybe fifteen in all
Jean encounters a familiar face: an enormous red-haired dealer - (35)
They greet each other as friends
Rockets leads Jean aside
They stand near a wall where a painting hangs ("Flats Fixed")
It bears Jean's three-point crown
You did that, didn't you
Jean shrugs
gave it to Maripol
She let me stay here for awhile
Jean hands him twenty dollars
Rockets hands him two dime bags
As if thinking better, he hands the bill back to Jean
Do one for me and it's free
How's that
Jean re-pockets his money
He gestures to Rockets as if to say "fine - it's a deal
" He and Benny sit down across the room and split a bag onto the window, as before
This time, it's good
They lean back into it, slumping down into the couch
Nearby, Rene sits on a couch with    - artists (who we've seen at Milo's opening)
They sit on their knees looking out a window passing binoculars back and forth
#1 looks through the window with a pair of
He points down towards the street, trying to get Rene's attention
#1 Check this out, Rene
Rene lunges towards the window
The stereo  (Curtis Blow's "Survival") (singing along) "The name of the game is survival, You learn it in jail upon your arrival
" Another  (#2) a young black man, runs up and tries to turn down the volume
Rene grabs his crotch
#2 Chill, man
Be cool
This isn't even my apartment
Oh man, you a  nigga
You know that
#2 Cut it out, man
And don't be callin' me that shit
: Benny is now alone on the couch
He nods out
(noticing him) Oh my, there goes the neighborhood
Who's house is this, anyway
Artist #2 is still mad at Rene
(') (to Artist #2) That's what  like about you straight boys
You're so sensitive
(resumes singing) "The name of the game is survival, Survival
Survival
only the strong survive" #1 Rene
Come here, man
gotta go pee
Rene weaves across the room
Suddenly, he stops cold
He's staring at Jean's painting
He doesn't move
(') (to himself) Who did this
(beat - louder) Who did this
#2 don't know
told you, this isn't my apartment
#3 know who did that
That's Jean Michel's
He's right here, man
He turns to look for Jean
#3 Fuck, man, where'd he go
Where's Jean
Benny looks around ineffectually and shrugs
(to himself) It's fucking amazing
Motherfucker's got to put a crown on it
#1 (yelling from the window) Rene, man, check this out
Whoa
He's kinda cute
Rene looks to him and back at the painting
He takes one last look
He stumbles towards the window and grabs the binoculars from Artist #1
We look through the binoculars'  at a  coming down the street
He's wearing all black, cowboy boots, and sunglasses
Naaaa
Poor thing has a little dick
#2 How do you know
Just look at him
(Rene hands the binoculars to him) Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots
Honey,  don't think so
He looks around the room again as if looking for Jean
#3 Whoa - check it out
It's him
Rene grabs binoculars
: Jean pauses before one of his own graffiti pieces: " ,  " Rene watches in awe
Jean, moving a bit slowly, `signs' his tag with the copyright sign
He walks off
#2 That's the same guy who did this painting
know that
Don't let him get away
He hands the binoculars to Artist #3 and runs towards the door
- We watch as Rene looks frantically for Jean, but can't spot him
Finally he sees Jean's hair-do bobbing up and down a block away
He runs towards it
Hey, wait up
Huffing and puffing, he catches up
You heard of Albert Milo
made    that niggah
'm Rene Ricard
Didn't    you read "Not About Albert Milo
"  know    who to hype
Baby, 'm gonna make you a    star
Can you put me in the ring with him
can put you in the ring with him
Even book the dates
(beat) But those big boys know how to fight
They could make you look real sissy
(they laugh) was looking at that painting upstairs
It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything
(beat) So what's your real name
'Samo
' Jean Michel Basquiat
They shake hands
Sounds famous already
1  - :    huge poster reads: "  / 100 " :  , Jean pounds a nail into one of his pieces, nailing it directly onto the wall
Everyone stares
Oh child
You got no respect
Didn't anyone teach you how to mount paintings
Rene smiles
Jean finishes pounding the last piece into the wall
pulls back to reveal several of Jean's paintings - found objects with paint on them
(') This is a very important season in New York
One's public appearance is absolute
(beat - a man approaches) Oh
Louise
'd like you to meet Jean Michel Basquiat - (beat) This is Henry Geldzahler
crowd begins to gather around the work
Ohh
've heard a lot about you love your graffiti
was a kid then
(to Rene) How much are these
You or the museum
It's for me
Five
'll take it
Henry leaves
That's five thousand dollars
(hissing to Jean) He's from the Metropolitan Museum of Art so suck my pussy, you star
There seems to be a buzz about Jean already
People gather around his paintings
Gina arrives
She looks great
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful
Well thanks
, a sophisticated, well-groomed woman appears at Jean's side
She takes in his paintings
As Jean, Rene, and Annina talk, Gina is left out
This is Jean Michel, whose work  told you about
(to Jean) Rene hasn't stopped talking about your paintings
Haven't  seen you in my gallery
No
(to Rene) You haven't been by lately
didn't have the subway fare
My Medicare ran out
(to Jean) How do you come up with all those words you put over everything
don't know
Jean sees Bruno and turns his back to her
Bruno looks at the paintings with a smile
He gives a cheerful nod to Annina
You're doing well
He leaves
Annina's impressed that Jean knows Bruno
'd love to see some more of your work
Where's your studio
You name it,  paint there
Well,  don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner
Maybe  could find a place for you to work
Take my card
You want a drink
He produces a pint bottle in a paper sack
No thanks
(to Rene) But 'd like one of these paintings
She walks off
Who's that
You kidding
That's Annina Nosei
Jean's been in her gallery a thousand times
(to Jean) You slut
How do you know Bruno Bischofberger
(to Gina) He's only the biggest art dealer in Europe
had lunch with him once
'  () - Jean and Gina lay in bed
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on
Maui
Kaui
Molokai
(a little upset) hadn't thought about it
(in perfect Hawaiian) Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee - Staten Island would be ok
Beat
Silence
Jean can't sleep
He stares at the ceiling
Do you wanna marry me
Beat
No reply
Gina's asleep
'  () -  () Quietly, Jean kneels on the floor of the kitchen
He paints on an old window
He draws figures of three people sitting at a table - obviously a family
He crosses out one person and paints a dog under the table
He crosses everything out
He mixes the paint in a large bowl and starts again
Again, he crosses everything out
- '  - Jean continues to work
He's wearing pajamas and a bathrobe
Gina enters, waking up
She looks at the painting
Kind of a family portrait
Jean moves to add something
She stops him
(') It looks done
Think so
He pauses
(') babies
You mean babies with you
What's wrong with me
You're your own baby
Jean paints out the image
There's a  at the door
Who is it
(
) Annina Nosei
Who
Jean jumps up and locks himself in the bathroom
Gina goes to the door, unlocks the chain, and looks out
(') (through the crack) Hello
Oh
Come in
She opens the door
Is Jean Michel here
No
Closed in the bathroom, Jean smiles while eavesdropping
'm here to see some work
Annina starts noticing all the work around her
Gina hands her a stack of drawings
(') These are great
Aren't they
How much for these five
You should talk to him about this
Annina contains her excitement
(continuing to stare at the work) Um
Do Rene and Jean have a contract together
We see Jean in the bathroom looking at himself in the mirror with a bird's nest on his head
(') 'm interested in showing Jean's work
really think you should talk to him about this
Jean pops out of the bathroom
When
How about right now
She opens the door
Unnoticed, Gina starts for the bedroom
(calling back) Be ready in a minute
: As Jean exits with Annina
- Jean waits in a taxi in front of Benny's apartment
Honk the horn again, will you please
The  obliges
The back of the cab is loaded with all his belongings
Boxes piled with junk
Bags of new painting supplies
Benny emerges from his building and jumps into the cab
(') (annoyed) You're late
(to cabby) One-fourteen Prince
The cab pulls out
Jean lights a joint
and smokes it furiously
He doesn't pass it to Benny
What's the rush, John Henry
ain't John Henry
Good
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway
Benny holds out his hand for the joint
(inhaling) don't really have any problems
Good
What do you have
What's your fuckin' problem
You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me
(mortified) 'Uppity
' Like as in 'uppity nigger
' He snaps his finger for the joint back
That's not how  meant it
(beat) For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan
You can never tell
Hey fuck you
deserve this shit
You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you
The cab stops for a red light
Benny gets out
He doesn't say a word
Jean doesn't look at him
The cab sails off
- It stops in front of the gallery
From outside, we see Annina conversing on the phone
She looks up and opens the door for him
-
Off screen we  Jean walking down the stairs
've got to find the switch
- , ' - Annina flips on a light
Here it is
Jean looks around him
He's in a large, empty cement-floored room lit by fluorescent lights
, ' - () - Jean bends over, beginning several canvases
He pours paint on them - kind of like photographs we've seen of Jackson Pollock
We Miles Davis' "Flamenco Sketches
" - , ' -  () ' " " fills the room
The walls are covered with half-finished, unstretched
Two or three more lie on the floor
He works like a maniac, buzzing back and forth from one painting to another, adding figures, crossing out words, all the while smoking and eating cookies
The crumbs fall onto the paintings
He walks on them
Every so often, he refers to a book of DaVinci drawings
Torn pages litter the floor beneath the book
We hear someone  down the stairs
It's Rene
follows him
He dumps a huge load of paint supplies, art books, and carryout ribs
The puppy sniffs around happily, licking at Jean and walking over the paintings, wagging his tail
He stops the tape player and inserts some Persian music
Jean empties some foil-wrapped bags of coke
He cuts a line of coke on a foil plate
Rene starts reading from a poem he's evidently written: 3rd night  called    him 'boy' He sed "don't call    me 'boy'" "Well Then don't call me    'Boss'" That Was the end for us    and 've Been seeing him for    2 1/2 years
In kangaroo court     want to be Able to say  never kept a Slave
But he tricked me in To Tying him up and busting his Face
He'll jump up at my Trial Yelling 'He wupped me gud
' Jean warms the plate 'til the coke crackles, and then "chases the dragon," sucking the smoke through a straw
He offers it to Rene, who refuses
He lights and hands Rene the joint
Rene takes a hit
Jean takes it back
Jean starts to work again
The  runs around, chasing after him, getting in his way, running across the paintings
Jean laughs, playing tag
The puppy gets a hold of Jean's sleeve
It unravels about ten feet
While Jean's playing, Rene spots a painting with the words "Famous Negro Athletes
" Oh man
That's one looks famous already
Without hearing him, Jean walks towards the painting and with a swipe, paints out what Rene is pointing to
(') You are a willful boy
How'm  s'posed to write about you if you keep changing everything
The phone
Jean ignores it
Rene gets it - (') Uh huhh
Band practice
(to Jean) It's Benny
He wants to know why you're not at band practice
(quietly) Fuck
(to Rene) forgot about that
He sets his brush down
Rene hold the phone against his leg
Fuck band practice
If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts - you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett
Tony Bennett
What do you mean
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time
didn't know Tony Bennett painted
My point exactly
Jean picks up the phone
All he hears is a
(') So keep painting
Yes, Boss
(beat) If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement
You're news
want the scoop
write it down
When  speak, no one believes me
But when  write it down, people know it's true
(beat) There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know
So what
So shut up and keep painting
(touched) What time is it
5:11
Jean regards a near-finished painting
He writes "5:11" on it
He crosses it out and re-writes it, "Rene 5:11
" Rene looks pleased
That one's for you
Thanks
'll take it tonight
can't
After the show
Jean continues painting
Rene slumps down onto the floor, happy - a parasite content to have a host, impressed with Jean's limitless energy
Rene closes his eyes
'  - Jean is bent over his work
He looks to see a pair of legs
They belong to Albert Milo
Hey - it's the big
Rene's been telling me about your work
Milo takes his time looking at the paintings
Jean continues to work, never wanting to appear impressed by anyone
He walks on top of the paintings
(') Is this finished yet
don't know
When's your show
Not sure
How was yours
haven't decided yet
(beat) Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow
wanna make a painting of you
How about now
Rene shrugs to Jean
He prepares to leave
See you at your opening
Thanks
Albert and Rene begin to ascend the stairs
Jean continues painting
The dog leaves with Rene and Albert
'  (
) Ohhh, Albert Milo, what a pleasure to meet you
Jean's brush stops
(
) This is Rene Ricard
Jean paints over the words "Rene 5:11
" We hear
The woman continues - '  (
) We're Tom and Cynthia Kruger - nice to have met you
' We see Annina's legs coming down the stairs
man wearing a pin-striped suit and gold-rimmed glasses
The woman is wrapped in a cashmere shawl
(
) Tom and Cynthia Kruger
(
) know
We  that Jean continues to paint, looking down
This is Jean Michel Basquiat
(beat) You've seen the  graffiti everywhere
That's his
This is the true voice of the gutter
As she speaks, Jean squirms
He grabs a banana from a fruit bowl
Without peeling it, he takes a big bite
And another
And another
Everyone looks uncomfortable
Annina starts showing them the paintings
We've seen the graffiti
work on Wall Street
And 've heard wonderful things about the paintings
Everybody's talking about you
Yeah
He looks up at them, eating the banana
Here's a very good example of his recent work that's not spoken for yet
(beat) He's got to work in a basement
He's got so much energy that if he worked in a place with a window, he'd jump right through it
Most of these are reserved already
After this week, this work will not be available
(to his wife) don't know
This one's nice, but don't know if  could live with it
That green is so
institutional
He (Kruger) looks up to see two  enter - young black artists, one of whom we saw with Rene at the loft party
They walk right into the middle of the room, completely oblivious to the presence of Annina and the Krugers
#1 (enthusiastically) Yo, man, you're a damn lucky nigger selling this shit
You like it
#1 Not bad
Yeah,  do
The Krugers hem and haw in front of the painting next to Jean
'm fascinated by his choice of crossing out words that way
Yes, well, they are more meaningful in their absence, no
#1 (to Jean, joking) What does it mean
Jean paints the words "Rene 5:11" back into a painting
They ignore the kid
like this one, but that green
Suddenly, we see  coming down the stairs
It's Gina
Everyone looks at her
'want me to make it a nice shit brown
Beg pardon
Gina hadn't expected to find herself in the middle of this scene
Hi
This is Gina
Annina nods to her
Gina nods to the group
They're something like Dubuffet's
That
childlike quality
Gina tries to connect with Jean
He's cold
(') (to her husband and Annina) can't make up my mind
like this one
If it were just another color
Get a fucking decorator
If you buy one, you'll have to change your whole lives - maybe even sell your kids
(to Annina) These paintings aren't even done yet
He sets his brush down
As he leaves - (
) think we'll take the green one
: Gina, left standing in the middle of this
- McDonald's
He smiles
'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie
line begins forming behind Jean
Forget it
'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies
You only want one Big Mac
The people in line are beginning to get impatient
Yeah
And make it three apple pies
- Jean leans on a fire hydrant, eating a Big Mac
pink scarf blows on the wind right in front of his face
He catches it
arrives with her hand outstretched to retrieve it
How can  ever thank you
(with a smile) 'd like to squeeze your titties
He offers her a Big Mac
Come on
Wanna Mac
No, 'd like the scarf
Have a Mac
don't eat junk food
Oh
didn't know
'll take you to the best restaurant in town
(beat) You'll miss a great meal and 'll keep the scarf, anyway
What's your name
You're a fast mover
No name
That's ok
'll just call you Big Pink
man sleeping on the ground with a beehive of paper bags on his head and three overcoats sticks out into the sidewalk
Jean leaves the McDonald's bag near his head as he walks down the street with the girl
'  - Jean enters the apartment
Hi
Hi
What's that
present  picked up for you
Gina holds the scarf up and looks at it
It's beautiful
Thanks
As she holds it up he puts it around her neck and kisses her
(tenderly) You look like an angel
- Silence
We read the words: " #2 " (the big red-haired dealer we met earlier) walks in front of us
to reveal a crowd in a gallery
It is literally filled with people
Again - all this takes place in silence
We begin to  Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is
" It colors the motion of the crowd
: (
) - Jean walks down the street
He's got on a new set of clothes and he listens to a Walkman
We  Miles Davis' "Flamenco Sketches
" ' We  down Prince St
and take a left on West Broadway
We approach a huge crowd
We get closer and closer until we are immersed in it
The crowd realizes Jean's amongst them
People start approaching him
Someone removes the headphones
The  of the crowd replaces the music
Amongst the normal crowd chatter, we hear friends' calling out: Jean
Jean Michel
Annina    beckons to him
Beyond her, he sees Albert, Andy, and Bruno
He's being escorted or maybe just pushed - it's hard to tell
Each step of the way, he's pounced upon by we've    never met
The room is wall-to-wall with people
People are swept    along in currents
(wildly enthusiastic) Jean, man
Let's make a record
(slyly, intimately) You finally did it
#2 (pointing to Jean, sneering) He's so fulla shit
#3 (
) How much is he getting for these
Jean walks up to Andy Warhol
Andy, man, thanks for coming
'd like to paint your jacket
My jacket
Gee, great
(he Polaroids Jean) Your show looks great
Quite a turnout
You look great
You kids
You drink red wine with fish
You can do anything
Make paintings in the basement of your gallery
First time 've heard of that
They are approached by Mary Boone, a short woman in high heels and an Armani suit)
(') Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone
She's got the great new gallery
Yeah,  met her already
(shaking Jean's hand) You should be pleased
It's a great show
'm having a dinner later at Mr
Chow's for Albert
You should come
In the background, we see Annina watching
You'll like it
Everyone'll be there
Annina walks over to Jean with a
Jean, your parents are here
Hi Dad
Hi Nora
Congratulations
Thanks for coming
Rene appears out of the crowd
(continuing to Jean's father) You must be very proud
am
How does it feel to have a genius in the family
It feels
good
Jean notices Benny across the room
He slows down and waves
Jean sees Gina across the room wearing the scarf
Just beyond her, he sees Big Pink approaching
There must be ten people between them
(to Rene) 'll be right back
He moves towards her
Suddenly, directly in front of him are the Krugers
We love our painting
Which painting
The green one
Oh yeah
We got a couch to match
She's only kidding
Looking past the Krugers, Jean looks for Gina
He sees her
His path is blocked
He presses forward, looking for Gina, getting caught in the crowd
Jean strains to keep an eye on Gina and Big Pink
Benny arrives at Jean's side holding a bottle of Jack Daniels and a shot glass
Willie Mays
Toast
Jean brushes past him
Not now, ok
Benny is left standing next to Andy holding the bottle
Jean manages to advance a few more feet through the crowd, then runs smack into Rockets, his drug dealer
Jean Michel, my man
Nice party
Should we step into my office
Nearby, Benny sees this meeting and walks off, disgusted, thinking this is why Jean gave him the brush off
That's alright
'm cool now
Jean looks off and sees Big Pink fingering the scarf, saying something to Gina
Gina slaps her in the face
Jean tries to get around the dealer
Gina turns to leave
She catches Jean's eye
She walks out
gift
was just trying to give you a gift
The dealer palms something to Jean
gotta go
Jean steps away from Rockets, but is trapped in the crowd
Rockets looks after him with disappointment
Rene arrives with, Andy, Bruno, and a
(edging his way in) This guy wants a picture
They shrug and crowd in - Jean, Andy, and Rene
The photographer gets them to squeeze closer and closer
Of the painters, please
There's not enough room
Rene accidentally gets pushed out of frame
Rene fumes
Albert Milo arrives with his parents ( )
They are a nice Jewish couple in their 70's
He said 'of the painters
' Hey - Albert
Get in the picture
Albert crowds in
The photographer  a picture and the blinds everyone momentarily
Hey, Jean, 'd like you to meet my wife
and my parents
Mom, Dad, this is Jean Michel Basquiat
Jean pulls out a joint and lights it as if it were a cigarette
He offers it to Albert, who takes a hit
(frowning at her son) Don't do that
(beat) Hello, Jean
Hi, John
Are your parents here
Well
(inhaling) My dad's here with his wife
My mom couldn't make it
He offers the joint to Albert's mother
(waving it away) No thanks
Everyone laughs
(to Jean) 'd like to do a show with you
(pointing to "Rene 5:11" painting) 'm especially interested in that one
'd like to buy it for myself
Jean spots the very word on the painting ("Rene 5:11") and freezes for a second
wasn't gonna sell this one
He looks around the room for Rene, but doesn't see him
Bruno remains smiling, waiting for an answer
You shouldn't have put it in the show
This is the one  absolutely have to have really love it
Sure, ok
Jean wants out
He feels compromised
(') Do you think  could borrow your limousine
'll get it back to you in an hour
It's
Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr
Chow's later
We'll be there
Bye, Jean
Jean makes his way through the crowd, as we see images of the crowd and fragments of paintings
As he nears the door, he feels his arm pulled
(hissing) You fucking little whore
You sold my painting
'm gonna tell you something, brother - when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs
Believe that shit
'll make you another one
Forget it
He pulls out a scrap of paper and starts writing
Rene - Rene shushes him
He hisses loudly, like a cat
Later
(speaking to himself) "What is it about art, anyway
" Jean pauses
He turns around and surveys the room once more
blink
Silence
We see the crowd in
Everyone's eyes are shut
(
; ') that we give it so much importance
Artists are respected by the poor because what they do is an honest way to get out of the slum using one's sheer self as the medium
The money earned is proof pure and simple of the value of that individual
The Artist
/
- The  rises higher and higher over the crowd and follows Jean as he makes his way toward the street
We begin to  into a  of stills of : (
') The picture a mother's son does in jail hangs on her wall as proof that beauty is possible even in the most wretched
And this is a much different idea than the fancier notion that art is a scam and a rip-off
But you could never explain to someone who uses God's gift to enslave that you have used God's gift to be free
" - Jean enters a waiting limo
It pulls away from the curb
Rene finishes as the limo threads its way through the night-lit, twinkling city
- The  is the young Rasta we saw earlier outside Ballato's driving Bruno and Andy
Jean slumps in the back seat
The driver can't help staring in the rearview mirror
really
admire you
Me
Why
You did it
You made it
'm a painter, too
That's great
Would you check out my studio some time
Sure
'd be glad to
The limo pulls over
Here
Quickly, Jean gets out of the limo
He leaves the door open
The  watches as Jean talks to two
Jean jumps back into the limo
The driver pulls away
In the rearview mirror, he sees Jean separate a bag from a bundle of ten
He rips it open and snorts directly from it
He lays his head back and takes a deep breath
(calm, relieved) What's your name, man
They call me Steve, but  prefer Shenge
Nice to meet you, Shenge
Want a job
'  - An elegant Chinese restaurant on the Upper East Side
The dining room is split level with a mezzanine reserved for celebrities and special friends of the owner
At the podium, the ' approaches
' Good evening
From behind the Maitre'd on the mezzanine we see Bruno waving to Jean
In the dining room on the lower level sit Annina and Rene
Nearby, at another, smaller table, are seated   and , two artists dressed in Victorian attire
Annina beckons him
Rene looks away from him and talks to a
Jean waves to Annina and continues towards Bruno's table
Seated at a large table are Andy, Bruno, Albert Milo, his wife and parents, Henry Geldzahler,   (a young heiress) and  and   and Mary Boone
Dinner's already served
At the large table, everyone watches as Milo makes a portrait of Francesco in a beautiful leatherbound book
It belongs to Mr
Chow, who is nearby at the bar
Hi, Jean
He motions to Mr
Chow to set a chair for Jean between Mary Boone and himself
Jean, everyone loved your show
As Jean is seated, Andy and Jack Milo resume conversation - Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York
Saddle River's in New Jersey
Saddle River, New York
It's in New Jersey
New York
think it's in New Jersey
It's in New York
Oh,  didn't know that
: Jean smiles at Andy's diplomacy
Albert finishes drawing his portrait: it's Francesco with his arm around a headless torso
(to Francesco) You finish it
He pushes the book across the table
Francesco begins to draw
(to Jean) hear your show was sold out already
There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works
Bring him over sometime
have some other stuff to show him
Annina watches from the other table as Jean talks to Mary
Francesco finishes his drawing
Albert takes the book and passes it to Jean
(') Go on, take it
Jean takes it
Mr
Chow watches his book change hands
Jean takes a bowl of moo-shoo pork in front of him and dumps it onto the book
Then he uses a piece of pork to draw a head
Suddenly, there's a shrill, familiar voice
'd like a glass of your best champagne, please
(reading) This is an enormously important season in New York, and to make a false step could have severe repercussions for years
We are no longer collecting art, we're buying individuals
Oh shut up, Rene
Everything's over your head, Andy
Even Mr
Chow's menu
(beat - to Jean) Thanks for not inviting me He leans over everyone and helps himself to some spears of asparagus
Esther Milo, watching
(') 'm starving
You can't buy    advertising like this
This is the most    glamorous dinner you'll have here this    fall
How about some of that imitation    crab
'm not paying for the drawing with crab
It's a present to my friends
It's my birthday
Jean finishes his drawing - a big beautiful head that fills the screen
Rene grabs it from him
He holds it up for everyone to see
Isn't he great
Thanks, Jean
He rips the page from the book
(') He owes me one
Everyone's face drops
Mr
Chow grabs his book
He motions to a couple  - You're too much, Rene
Get this guy out of here
haven't eaten yet
The waiters grab Rene's arms
(') Hands off me, you faggots
'm going
'm going
've kept Diana Vreeland waiting too long, anyway
Wow
That was a nice drawing, too, Jean
Maybe you should do another one
(exhausted) Some other time
Spontaneously, David McDermott climbs onto the tabletop downstairs and sings "Paris Je 'aime
" As he belts it out in a theatrical falsetto, he glides over glasses and plates, executing a leap to another table in mid- song
The restaurant staff and    watch, agape
- '
As David dances, Annina walks over to the table, greeting people and saying goodnight
(to Jean) It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, 'll handle it for you
Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio
Sure
Annina leaves
Jean leans back in his chair, taking in this splendid new world
He pulls out a joint, lights up, inhales with pleasure, closes his eyes and smiles
: "  " (
) had twenty-three one man shows, been in forty three group shows from Zurich to Tokyo
- Note: The following scene is shot in documentary style
(
, ') had over fifty articles written about you, switched galleries - how many times
- 'd in the hottest clubs - Jean looks out the window, yawns and rubs his eyes
He now sports dreadlocks bundled into groups of spikes sticking out of his head
He wears a wrinkled Wesleyan College -shirt, paint- splattered jeans, and no shoes; just out of bed, it would seem
An  - a balding Brit with all the humor of a bank clerk - tries to buddy up with Jean on camera
(') one of the youngest    artists ever to be included in the Whitney    Biennial, also produced a rap record
It's said you're quite the ladies man -    even dated Madonna for a couple months
(takes a breath) All at the ripe old age    of 24
One might ask: is there anything    left for Jean Michel Basquiat to do
Jean and the interviewer face each other in front of one of Jean's paintings
Jean stares at the interviewer, incredulous
(') What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning
(nervous laugh) hate this
Turn that off
Jean walks off camera and disappears into his bedroom
Shenge (the former limo driver, now working as Jean's assistant) assembles stretchers
: "  , 1985" waits in the room
Jean returns
We're running a little late
He signals to the crew that he's beginning
(') (to crew) Ready
He points to some scribbled words on the canvas
(') Can you
decipher this for us
Decipher
Yes
What do they
stand for
They're just words
Yes,  understand - but where do you take them from
Where
Do you ask Miles where he got that note from
Where do you take your words from
(beat) Everywhere
(pointing to a detail) What are they
(smiling mischievously) Leeches
long list of leeches
(looking at some frames Shenge's working on) It looks good like that
Hmmm
And 'Parasites
' (beat) You seem to be a Primal Expressionist
You mean like an ape
He grabs a huge double mouthful of French Fries and washes them down with champagne
(') (chewing, spilling) primate
Well, you said that
(beat - looks at notes) You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting
You like it
Yes, but as a black painter - use a lot of colors - not only black
What
'm not black
You're not
Not what
Not black
No, 'm Haitian-Puerto Rican
The  sounds
He signals for Steve not to answer the door
Yes, yes
Let's talk about that
your roots
Your father is from Haiti, isn't he
(growing weary) Yup
Hmmmm
Interesting
And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home
We don't hang them at home, y'know - just in the streets
see
(beat) And
How do you respond to being called - hmmm
(peruses some notes) - yes, "the pickaninny of the art world
" (smiles - hurt, stunned) Who said that
Why, that's from Time Magazine
No, he said  was the Eddie Murphy of the art world
He said the Eddie Murphy
Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution
Jean walks off camera like he just received a punch in the stomach
The filming of the interview becomes increasingly erratic
(') Let me
just
open something up here
You come from a nice, middle class, respectable home
Your father is an accountant
Why did you at one time live in a cardboard box in Tompkins Square
Jean walks back into frame
(') Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto
Are those the only two possibilities
(cramming a French Fry into his mouth) You wanna French fry
One last thing
Is there any anger in you
Any anger in your work
Should there be
Tell me about it
What are you angry about
Jean drifts off
Mmmm
don't know
don't remember
- Jean and Andy browse through the aisles
Jean piles things into his cart
Jean approaches the specialty counter
Andy continues with the cart
(to ) Can  have some caviar, please
The Counterman selects a miniscule plastic spoon of caviar and begins to put it into a tiny glass jar
(') 'd like to taste it, first
Reluctantly the Counterman gives him a taste with a look like "what's a person who looks like you doing buying caviar
" Jean tastes the caviar and hands him back the spoon
(') Is that the best quality you have
Yeah, it's the best one
'll take the whole tin
It's three thousand dollars
'll take it
(wipes nose with sleeve
) Andy, gimme three thousand dollars
(beat) Just the caviar - 'll get the rest
He hands two one hundred dollar bills for the other items to the counterman, who checks them carefully
(') You check everyone's bills or just mine
: - cheap pharmacy gift shop window
Jean and Andy look in on two yellow furry stuffed ducks which are part of a larger display
When  was little, my brother and  used to have two ducks as pets
We called them the Rodriguez Brothers
They walk into a beauty salon
- Jean and Andy recline on the beautician's armchairs busy themselves with the two of them, simultaneously giving them pedicures and manicures
Jean sets down a magazine
wish they'd quit writing this shit about me
That's good
At least they're interested
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors - anything with a tag on it
(beat) The other day,  just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so  did a drawing and sold it for two bucks
week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing
Should we buy it for five thousand
" Wow
Stop giving them away
(beat) got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons
You wanna do it with me
Yeah - 'd do that
You could teach me
Gee
don't need to
You're a natural
You should sign up with my modeling agent
Jean points to Andy's ankles - they have plastic flea collars on them
Cool
My dog, Archie
woke up with flea bites
Creepy
ran out and bought flea collars
They work really well
Beat
Let's leave this town and go someplace
Some island
Let's go to    the Carnegie Museum
They have the world's    most famous sculptures all in these giant    plaster replicas
It's really great
It's    in Pittsburg
- - They walk out of the beauty salon
Jean sees the back of a girl
She looks a lot like Gina
Ouch
What's wrong
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina
Do you still love her
Yeah
really blew it
still think about her
Well, have you asked her to come back
Jean shakes his head `no,' sorry that he didn't
' () - medium-sized dining room with dark wood paneling and tastefully appointed furnishings
Jean and Gina enter
Gina looks considerably more conservative than previously - more like a student
Jean's dressed well, but looks even more careworn than usual
His hair is tied back with a necktie
He has a couple sores on his face
His skin looks a little puffy
The ' smiles at Jean and bows - ' Mr
Basquiat - what a pleasure to see you again
Hey George, what's up
huge table with
clear their lunch settings
As they spot Jean and Gina entering, they gawk and snicker
George leads them to their table
As they take their seats, Jean notices the suppressed giggles coming from the executives' table
They try to ignore it
George disappears
Jean seems self-conscious about the sores on his face
So are you really friends with Andy
He seems like such a weirdo
He's not
He's out of town and he calls me every day
What's weird about him
Don't you think he's using you
Why does everybody say that
He's the only person  know who doesn't need to use me
George reappears
Would you like to see the wine list
Chateau Latour '64, please
George disappears again
So
Are you ready
start Columbia next fall
Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but - whatever
'm really excited
(beat) And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary
His poems are getting published
How is he
Pretty much the same
Jean's eyebrows go up
Wow
Congratulations
hate that asshole
(beat) Thanks for coming
guess  just wanted to find out how you're - (referring to an extra loud snicker from execs) What's that about
Forget it
George arrives and pours a sip for Jean to taste
He nods
George moves off
Two or three of the executives break out laughing
Jean puts the glass down and looks at them
The other table is clearly making fun of him
That is amazing
What year is it
George
George hurries over
'm sorry, Mr
Basquiat
See that table over there
'd like to pay their bill
Long silence
'm sorry
Gina looks at Jean, confused
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab
Really
Yeah
Very well
He moves off towards the executives
George whispers to the , and nods towards Jean
The executives spread the words amongst themselves
They're horrified
(continuing) Baby,  think about you a lot
'm really sorry about everything
You have to believe me
'm serious
wish, y'know, that we were - don't believe it, Jean - they're picking straws
, obviously the loser, takes a deep breath and heads towards them
Excuse me
On behalf of my friends 'd like to apologize
We're really sorry
wish you niggahs could get it togeth- ahhhhhh
The Executive reaches to shake Jean's hand
Jean puts a hundred dollar bill in his hand
What's this for
The tip
Jean turns back to Gina
The Executive leaves them
George smiles
You don't have to be sorry
There's no one to blame
Jean, you're a real artist thought  was one
You made me realize wasn't
What's his name
Gina balks
Rather than face a disappointment - (') have to go to the bathroom
' () - - looking in the mirror
He looks at himself
He starts to pick at his face
-   - Jean and Albert Milo sit on a banquette huge white painting of Jean's with a dragon's head hangs on one wall to their left
On the opposite wall in back of the bar hangs another huge painting with a lot of heads, mostly black
Lots of  mill about a huge room
- another Gina look-alike walks through the crowd
Jean's eyes follow her momentarily
(re: the paintings) What do you think
like the one with the dragon's heads a lot
But the black one's filled up with too many heads
(beat) 'd take some of them out
(beat) think you're painting too fast wouldn't put in so many heads
Let it breathe a bit
It's always how you would do it
This is my version
You're right
It's your version
You should come over to the studio sometime
Why, so you could humiliate me
No,  wanted to make a painting of you
- Jean rides his bicycle through the park
He's looking up at the birds flying in the trees
The birds
We see the statue in the middle of the park, but we have no idea where we are until we see the Mays Dept
Store sign
The birds circle in flocks, never lighting on the trees
() - Jean presses a buzzer
He's admitted
He carries his bike on his shoulder
- Jean enters a broad, high-ceilinged studio
It's neat
Paintings lie on the floor
Andy's back is turned to him
As Jean gets closer, he sees that Andy's assistant  is peeing on canvas covered with copper pigment
We hear the  of the piss
Frank holds a bottle of beer in his hand
little more to the right, Frank
Good
Now up
You got a little more
Jean notices a bunch of Andy's wigs on a desk
What's with the wigs
'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents
You think those are good presents
Who wants an old wig
Jean makes a grimace
He walks up to the painting Frank's peeing on
Piss painting
wanted to make a few more of these
Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer
It makes a good green
How come you're not peeing on them yourself
don't like beer
Looking down at the painting - If you ever want me to shit on 'em, just ask
You could finger paint
- Jean and Andy collaborate on a large canvas
Andy outlines a Mobil Oil winged horse
Jean paints it out
To the side he paints a penguin with a hat
That was my favorite part
We can do better
It needed more white
Andy watches as Jean lights a joint and continues working on his penguin
Jean, you make me feel worthless
You're so famous
Andy paints an Amoco logo next to the penguin
don't even have any friends anymore besides you
And everyone says "Warhol
That death-warmed over person on drugs
He's just using you
" Gee
You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean
That's why you can't stop taking drugs
You always think people don't like you
Everyone likes you
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work
Jean paints out part of Andy's logo
Bruno called
In    Europe, people are saying you're gonna die    from drugs
They think they can cash in    on your death
When  was poor, everybody doubted  could make it
When  got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up
' Now everyone says `he's killing himself
' So clean up, and then they say `Look
His art's dead
'  don't take drugs, anyway
'm healthy now
Jean obliterates Andy's logo
If you say so
You sleep until 5:00 p
m
You call at four in the morning
You never show up anywhere on time - if you show up
You're painting out everything  do
Andy paints back in part of the horse
That's better
Jean adds some letters on top of Andy's logo
can't even see what's good anymore
Jean Michel obliterates the rest of the logo with some white
Andy steps back and squints as he examines Jean's work
(') Yeah,  see what you mean about the white
It's better
Jean quits painting
After the show we should take a nice long vacation
Maybe go to Hawaii
That's what 'm gonna do
'm going to give up painting and start playing music again
wanna sing
That would be a pity because you're a real painter
Frank arrives
Here's the poster for the show
He presents them with a yellow poster of Jean and Andy facing each other with boxing gloves
- Shenge hands Andy a box
Andy opens the box
Inside is a football helmet with Jean's dreadlocks glued to the outside
: Andy in mirror wearing helmet
: The screen is filled with the cover of the New York Times Magazine
Jean is featured on the cover, without his dreadlocks
- As Shenge opens the door, a  of people spill out
They pour into the loft
The studio is crowded with
(Many of them we recognize from earlier scenes in Mudd Club, Jean's opening, etc)
On the wall there is a portrait of Jean by Andy
The background is a piss painting
Inside, Jean kneels on the floor in the corner of the loft with a bunch of people around him - girls, mostly
Twenty-five copies of the Times Magazine lay stacked on the floor
Crouching on one knee, Jean signs a copy for a
Looking up - Name
Elke
Number
505-0236
walks up - Name
Monica
Number
477-0258
Andy's assistant, Frank, arrives with , 25, a model
Yo, Frank
This is really great
What a nice place
Jean is taken with Christine
(') Have you met Christine
don't think so
He's thrown off his rhythm
Would you sign one of those for me
(seen with Rene at loft party earlier) spots Jean and steps in
Jean, this is Ramellzee
Yo
You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you
Uh-oh
'm here for an interrogation
You've been called a graffiti artist and  wanna know why
All  see are scribble scrabble abstractions
Boom
Boom
As in ordnance
Are your letters armed
What is the prime directive of graffiti culture
Do you know, black man
Jean likes Rammellzee enough to be patient
Toxic grins and rolls his eyes to Jean
Jean watches Christine as they go on
(to Ram, re: Jean) Man,  was up on him years ago on the
You're selling and ending the culture
Not one bit of information
Only to get the money and growl with the power, man
That's ignorant
That ain't ignorant - that's just stupid
(beat - to Christine) Can  get you a bowl of gumbo
Rammellzee yells after him - This interrogation is not over
Jean escorts Christine to the kitchen
Bruno and Andy stand in the crowd
Nearby are two
Albert Milo
Ugh
He's just a pressmonger
That's all these people do
#2 You know,  love Jean's early work
It's really got something
But this collaboration with Andy - maybe they thought it was a joke
mean - whose work is it
Jean's or Andy's
Walking by, Rene responds to this - His early work
He's only twenty-six
Rene walks over to Jean
Hey, Rene
Thanks again for not inviting me
'm only here on business
Rene heads back out into the party
Jean eats gumbo while Christine thumbs through the Times Magazine
Rene responds to something Andy's been telling him in a low voice
(') (loudly) You're asking me
Nigga, please
After the way you treated me
This is the first time 've heard from either of you in months had to crash this party
You treated me like a suede biscuit
Rene don't play that
can't get him off drugs
don't even talk to him any more
(to Bruno) What's a suede biscuit
: CHRISTINELooks up from her magazine
(amused) Hey, what's this
It says right here you're Andy's
"lapdog"
Jean walks away
He passes through the crowd, making his way to the door
He exits
- Drugged, upset, Jean leaves the party
He opens a limo door and looks back at his house
The party continues
The limo drives off
We  on Jean's building
- The limo floats through the streets
Jean stares out the window
Here
Pull over
The limo pulls over
Jean exits
- Jean disappears around the corner
in the process of prying a door panel with crowbars
We see that they're removing one of Jean's  pieces from a wall
We read: " " Jean arrives behind them
What's up
#1 Mind your own fuckin' business
(recognizing his work) That's mine
That ain't yours, man
Some asshole named did this
#3 He's dead
That's what  heard
#2 He ain't dead yet
He's gonna kill himself
That's why all those art fags in Soho are paying more every time we bring one of these in
#1 Stupid
Hardly any of this shit left
The panel is almost pried free without a scratch
#3 This one's damn nice
say we hang onto it if he's almost dead
Jean shoves his way in front with a magic marker and adds a couple words; now it reads: "  " There you go
Now it's worth more
The kids are outraged, thinking Jean's ruined their find
They jump on him
They beat the shit out of him
They're done
Jean lies curled up on the ground, trying to talk
#2 What's he saying
'm
'm
#3 (bending close) He says he's
Kid #1 whacks him in the back once more for good measure
#1 He wish
: It is flat, dead, gray
Ominous and waiting
- Washed in sunlight, a large painting leans against the wall, the words "  " scrawled through its center
Jean lays down, watching
He looks older now, more worn
His face is slightly swollen
His complexion is discolored
Shenge covers a triptych with wide brush strokes of yellow paint
He circles a large, primitive figure of a black man drawn with magic marker in the center
He is careful to leave the figure intact
Paint it out
Out
Yeah
Maybe just his arms
(Shenge paints out the arms) Put some Cerulean Blue there
Jean points to the lower corner
Shenge picks up the phone, which has been  for some time
It's Andy again
Still not here
- In this corner
(not looking) Yeah
Shenge changes the brush and dips it in the can
You want me to put it here
Use your fucking instinct
Shenge shrugs and starts to spread the blue
Jean looks at his work
(') Don't try to make art
Just paint like a housepainter
woman's shout can be heard through the open window
Shenge looks out
It's Maria Portos
What should we do
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve - mean Shenge
Get up
She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it
Wanna bet
If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you
, a raven-haired, sharp-featured beauty in a Chanel suit jacket, blue jeans, and pearls walks into the room
She's with - younger - a millionaire fake hippie from Texas
Maria carries a bag with clogs in it - a present for Jean
She takes them out
(showing him the clogs) These reminded me of you, the clogs found them in Amsterdam
Jean doesn't get up from the floor
(') How are you
Fine
You remember Ellen
(looking around) What are you working on
Basquiat points at the painting
How much is something like that
Jean raises his hand and pumps five fingers three times in the air
Fifteen
Reasonable
Ellen makes a snotty face
It's unfinished
(to Shenge) How 'bout some blue in the corner
Shenge gives Jean a stupefied look
Blue
Where
What's wrong with you today
Shenge is embarrassed by Jean's remark in the company of the two women
(') Don't look at me like that
It hurts my feelings
He points
Unsure, Shenge picks up the brush and paints one of the corners
Maria browses through a stack of paintings leaning against the wall
love these
God
just can't even care anymore
Compare this to a mountain or a tree
Who're y'all trying to kid
That's what think
was just in the Himalayas, and like -  - is this important
No
mean, compared to the rain forest or something
These are just narcissistic jokes
(to Jean) Who are you selling these through now
Jean gets to his feet
He dips a long, thin brush into black paint and nonchalantly crosses out the half figure that Shenge is carefully surrounding with blue
Well, that's better
(to Maria) You can buy direct from me
Look at these - silkscreens
What're you
Andy Warhol Junior
It's like - not even handmade anymore
She's not even worth a response
Jean looks around, numb
- Jean enters the gallery
Cleaned up
Healthier
Bruises healing
He looks like he's been painting
Mary looks up from her desk, surprised to see Jean
Jean Michel
Crawling from the wreckage
need a dealer
You have a bunch of them, don't you
Albert Milo walks in from another room
Hey Jean
(to Mary) It'll never fit
It'll be ok
You better take a look
Why's your door so small
The ceilings are sixteen feet and your door's the size of a mouse hole
Why are your paintings so big
Just go home
'll get it in
(to Jean) You doing anything right now
Naa
Let's get out of here
See ya in an hour
(to Mary) So what do you think
Bruno spoke to me already
We could talk about it
'm here
'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock
'  - Albert shows Jean through a series of large rooms filled with enormous paintings
It looks like the Cairo Museum
They pause before a painting
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan
painted it after Joseph Beuys died
rebirth painting felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me
The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else
Do you ever get sick of it
Of what
The whole thing - painting
No
It's one of the few times  feel good
used to have to go to work and cook every day
That  got sick of
What about the shit they write
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark
read that
The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly
That's your enemy, not your audience
Your audience hasn't even been born yet
It's a lie that art is popular
The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers
'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings
There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them
haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out
As long as 've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs
He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together
But he doesn't care about me
He cares about you
You're the only person he cares about
He's your friend
Fuck that article
You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese
Milo's daughter  (12) calls out from over the balcony
(
) Papa, the 's broken
Will you fix it please
Alright
'll be right up
Albert leaves
Jean looks at some paintings
Stella comes downstairs
(to Jean) Hi
Hi
've seen you before
like your paintings a lot
Your hair was different
You like your dad's paintings
Some of them
Stand still
He draws her
(') See you later
Thanks He walks to the door, leaving the drawing on the floor
Albert returns
Where's Jean
He just left
Albert opens the door to the stairwell looking for Jean
He hears the sound of
He leans over the stairwell
He sees Jean Michel, taking a piss on the landing
He shuts the door quietly
- Jean walks out of the gift shop (seen earlier, next to beautician's) - Jean walks through the middle of the intersection
He carries two yellow, furry toy ducks under his arm
: " 22, 1987" Seeing Bruno at the wheel of a black Mercedes stopped at a light, Jean clowns around like a street vendor who wants to wash his window
Bruno doesn't notice him
It's me - Jean
What's the matter
No snow in Switzerland this year
didn't see you
What do you mean
You haven't heard
Andy's dead
The light changes
Bruno pulls across the street because of the traffic
Jean drops one of the ducks in the street and walks off
The duck lying in the street
- The "  " sign hangs outside Jean's door
- Mary sits in her limo trying to call Jean
- Near darkness
The curtains are drawn
Music plays: `Birds' by Neil Young: "it's over
it's over"
Jean watches a video tape with the sound
The screen fills with Andy's face
We  a series of quick scenes from his life
Jean and the remaining duck are lit by the
- : Held in Jean's hand
It's stalled in mid-stroke
He writes with a magic marker on the heel of two wooden clogs the word: "" There's a loud  at the door
When it stops, the pencil tip resumes its long voyage across the page
: Tom Waits' "Tom Traubert's Blues" '  - Jean buzzes the doorbell
He's wearing the clogs
He's hurting
The intercom comes on
Hello
Gina
Who is it
Jean recognizes Benny's voice
Gina and Benny look out the window into the street
Jean's a block away
- Jean gets out of a cab
He walks up to the entrance
The doors are locked
He rattles them
Inside, an   keeps mopping
Jean pounds harder,  the doors more
Hey, come here
Please
Just for a second
Open the door
The janitor gets nervous
He leaves
He returns a moment later with a large
Open up
Open up
The guard unlocks the door, hoping to settle Jean down
(') My mother's inside
Come back tomorrow
Visiting hours are over
(beat) Don't cause any trouble
'm not here to visit
wanna take her home
The guard gently ushers Jean out through the door
Don't cause any trouble
He locks the door and walks off with the janitor
- Jean, walks around, drifting, stoned
He looks up at the skyline
: Waves crash silently over a surfer
: (
) Willie Mays
: - Jean has been passed out on a sidewalk
: Benny's face
He leans over Jean and helps him up
Willie Mays
Nice to see you
Benny looks at Jean's eyes
Jean stretches, kicking life back into his limbs
(') How's Gina
You guys getting along
Benny looks at him guiltily
She's good
guess it was a long time ago
Come on, let's get out of here
-  - Jean and Benny zoom along in a battered old Army Jeep
Now revived, Jean stands up, waving at people miming General Patton
We  the music of "Summer of Siam
" Sit down
You're gonna fall out
Me fall
Let's get some drugs
Drugs
Medicine, man
Like health food
'm taking care of my health
- mountain of homeopathic medicine and health food on the counter
Benny helps the clerk load it into a box
You starting a hospital
Jean approaches and dumps some more stuff onto the counter
He's chewing something
Just ring it up
don't need a bag
(to Benny) Try this tabouli - it's great
Tabouli spills onto Jean's shirt
-   - Jean and Benny walk along
Benny's arms are full with boxes
Jean walks in front, eating yogurt
He's wearing his Titanic clogs
Benny tries to keep up
(') My mom told me this
Or was it a dream
: - crude stone jail - almost medieval - fairy-tale like
thick wooden plank suspended by chains for a bench
candle on the wall
small, crowned prince (the boy seen in the dream in intro
) looks longingly out the window at rolling green hills
Terraced hillsides, cedar trees, cottages, smoke wafting up from chimneys
Dirt streets
The prince smashes the window
He hits his head on the bars, gripping them tightly
' - The villagers cease their activities as they listen to the
Looking up, they smile, as if warmed to their souls by some unearthly and intangible substance
They look heavenwards
follows their collective gaze skywards
We shoot up, up, into the sky
(
) There was this little prince with a magic crown
An evil warlock kidnapped him, locked him in a cell in a huge tower and took away his voice
There was a window made of bars
The prince would smash his head against the bars hoping that someone would hear the sound and find him
The crown made the most beautiful sound that anyone ever heard
You could hear the ringing for miles
It was so beautiful, that people wanted to grab the air
They never found the prince
He never got out of the room
But the sound he made filled everything up with beauty
(
) It's definitely time to get out of here
- We rush down, down through the sky
Buildings come up at us
We're over Soho
We're back on the ground
Benny and Jean continue walking
We see Jean from behind
He's looking up
Benny stops to readjust his parcels
Jean continues down the street, talking louder
(') Hawaii
Fuck Hawaii
Let's go to Ireland
We'll stop in every bar and have a drink
