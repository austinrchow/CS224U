Written by Spencer Susser & David Michod July 7th, 2008 - small kid,   (13), with a grubby worn cast on his arm, rides his  really fast down a street
He chases a tow truck towing a badly wrecked red Volvo
He struggles to keep up
The truck makes a turn
follows, turning dangerously in front of oncoming traffic
The truck makes another turn
turns with it, running straight into the side of a car pulling out of a driveway
He comes off his bike and is thrown across the hood
He picks himself up, stunned
The driver of the car gets out to see if he's hurt
looks down the street to see the tow truck disappearing in the distance
He hurries back to his bike
He jumps on and continues after the truck
gives chase
He gains on the truck
He can see it pull into a used car lot ahead -
- arrives at the car lot as the    is lowering the car onto the drive
dumps his bike, out of breath
This car has to go back
Huh
This car has to go back to where it came from
Put it back on the truck
What are you talking about, kid
The driver continues working, unhooking the car from the truck
Stop unhooking it
There's been a mistake
was told to bring it here
That's what it says on my work order
Talk to that guy if you've got a problem
The driver nods in the direction of  , who is approaching with 17 year-old   and another man, , in dirty overalls
() 2
: (to tow truck driver) Hey, Bill
Larry shakes the tow truck driver's hand
This car has to go back where it came from
beg your pardon
It was brought here by mistake
Larry smiles at the little out-of-breath kid
And where was it supposed to go
It wasn't supposed to go anywhere
It needs to go back where it came from
The guy who sold it to you made a mistake
( ) What's the deal with this car again, Tony
Tony flips through a stack of papers he's holding
Ah let's see, we bought this car yesterday afternoon from a Paul Forney- That's my dad
It wasn't his to sell
Well, it's his name on the pink slip, son
And that means it's his to sell if he wants
Yeah, but 'm just telling you it was a mistake, , so it needs to go back where it came from
() 3
: (2) The car has now been lowered off the back of the tow truck
Larry moves away from  and approaches the driver
Thanks, Bill
( ) You got that work order there
Tony looks through his papers for the work order
doesn't like being ignored
He moves around to the driver's side of the wrecked car and wrenches open the bashed-in door
He climbs behind the wheel, slams the door shut and locks the door
(') Get out of the car, son
ignores him
Larry doesn't have time for this
(') Dustin, get him outta there, will ya
Dustin moves around to the open driver's side window
Come on dude, get out of the car
turns the key and begins winding the window up
Dustin reaches in trying to unlock the door
(') 'mon
Open it
The window is rising
Dustin grabs at
keeps winding the window
It gets to the top, trapping Dustin's arm
(') Ow, fuck
What the fuck you doing
Open it
Dustin is stuck
Larry, Bill and Tony laugh
Dustin yells at
ignores him, staring straight ahead
The men laugh some more
Dustin's humiliation sets in
(') Put down the fuckin' window
'm serious
Larry goes around to the passenger's side broken window and opens the door
He leans in and easily drags  out of the car
() 4
: (3) 'd get out of here kid, before he works himself loose
's not getting the car back
The men continue laughing at the trapped Dustin
picks up his bike and rides away defeated
/  - sits at the kitchen table with his tiny 85 year-old and his depressed and dishevelled , Paul Forney (45)
Dad has a full shaggy beard and a recently healed wound on his forehead
They eat in silence
There's tension in the air
There's still plenty of applesauce boys
( ) don't get why what  think doesn't matter
It couldn't stay in the front of the house anymore,
'm not having this conversation again
Yeah, why not
It's there everyday and  have to look at it
When do you look at it
When was the last time you got off the couch
It's not healthy
Neither are all the pills you're taking, but  don't tell you not to take them
don't wanna talk about it anymore
() 5
: do
don't
And that's it
fumes
They eat in silence a bit more
drops his fork and leaves the table, angry
It's  dear
He just needs time
It's his first day back tomorrow
Lets try and be patient
Dad is a mess
(') One thing at a time dear
One thing at a time
Yeah,  know, mom
Grandma nods quietly
/  - gives his mouth a once over with a toothbrush
He spits, then sets his toothbrush down on the edge of the sink
/   - stands holding a banana and wearing a backpack in front of the couch where his dad is sleeping
Dad is lying face down, half-covered with a sheet, his leg hanging off the side
There's dirty plates and pill bottles on the coffee table in what is otherwise an old lady's living room
Dad stirs, it's a pathetic sight
taps Dad's leg with his foot
Dad slowly comes to life and notices
Can  have some money so  can buy lunch today
Yeah
Dad sits up on the couch, he looks a total mess
Dad pick up his wallet from the mess of a coffee table and hands  a few dollars
() 6
: (') Hope you have a nice day Teej
exits, leaving Dad sitting there
Dad sets his wallet back down and stares blankly into the room
We hear the door slam in the background
- on his  pedals down the drive and out onto the street
- pedals in the middle of a suburban street
He steers his bike with his broken arm as he tries to peel and eat the banana with the other
He glides down a hill
It's a long hill
He travels fast
Despite the glide and the wind in his hair he's slouching and looks depressed
- rides his bike through an eerily barren unfinished housing development - half-built houses and perfectly sealed wide streets
Up ahead, he can see a small section of unfinished road - a big patch of dirt and rocks
He veers up a driveway to avoid it
He passes the dirt patch and then comes down off the curb back onto the road, trying to keep control of his bike
He hits the road and loses his balance
The handlebars twist and he crashes onto the road
He jumps up and yelps in pain, clutching his elbow
He looks at it
It's badly grazed
He yelps again, angry
He picks up a rock lying in the street and charges towards an unfinished house
He hurls the rock through its front window
Glass crashes down
silent beat passes, and then the front door of the house opens and a late-20s, long-greasy-haired, wiry shirtless guy in filthy black jeans emerges
He has a baby moustache and a cracked front tooth
This is
He makes a determined line toward
The fuck you think you're doing
Before  can back away Hesher grabs him by the back of his - shirt and drags him kicking and squealing towards the house
7
-  - Hesher drags  into the unfinished front room
He slams against an uncoated drywall
Hesher pulls a pair of garden shears from his back pocket and squeezes 's nose between the blades
is terrified
He squirms
The fuck you think you're doing
Nothing
You got five seconds or 'm gonna cut your fuckin' nose off
was just,  was just going to school
,  didn't know anyone was here
Hesher stares intimidatingly at
looks seriously scared
Bullshit
You're gonna fuckin' - Hesher is suddenly startled
His ears prick up like a rabbit
He hits the deck dragging  down with him
Their faces are close together
Hesher makes a very serious finger-to-mouth gesture to 'shhhh'
The  of a car idling outside
Hesher listens
is on his stomach, freaked
looks around the room - a duffel bag, some beer cans, a few porn magazines, a weathered bass guitar and a sleeping bag
car door closes loudly
Hesher peers through the window and sees a   inspecting 's bike in the front yard and then making his way toward the house
Hesher looks at  with serious and considered venom
(') You just fucked me
Hesher snaps into action
With speed and precision he gathers his stuff together
He shoves it all his duffel bag
() 8
: (
) Who's in there
Hesher lights the fuse on a stick of homemade dynamite wrapped in duct tape and throws it through the broken window
He then slips out the back door, leaving  face down on the floor freaked out and confused
(
) (') What the hell- Dirt sprays against the house and pours in through the window
cowers, then hears the guttural roar of a van starting up
He hears the van screech away
(
) (') Hey
Get back here
jumps to his feet and looks out the window
dirty black van screams out onto the road and tears away, spraying dirt and rocks in its wake
The security guard stumbles around, covered in dirt and disoriented
He rushes back to his car and gives chase
lets them get away up the street, then bolts to the front door
- darts for his bike
He picks it up and rides off quickly
- Outside a public high school, kids mill around before class
Lots of noise
rides down a path and clocks Dustin Howard, the kid from the car lot, who stands talking with friends by his car - a shiny 2007
They spot each other quickly looks away (oh shit) and b-lines for the bike rack
/  - opens his locker
He pulls out a clear zip-lock bag with a rotten apple inside
He looks at it a moment then puts it back in the locker
kid puts his hand on 's shoulder
1 Hey,
You're back
Welcome back
Another kid comes over, eating a bagel
() 9
: 2 Hey, Teej
Welcome back, man
nods, despondent, putting books into his backpack
2 (') How you feeling, man
() Fine
2 came by your house a while ago, see if you wanted to come skateboarding or something, but it looked like the place was empty
Have you moved or something
1 Yeah,  tried calling you a bunch of times, but it kept saying there was a new number or something
Yeah, we moved in with my Grandma for a little while
1 Oh , cool
didn't want to call cause  didn't know
(changing the subject) You want some of my bagel
No
Thanks
Awkward beat
doesn't want to make chit-chat
People are already making him feel weird
1 Hey, can  be the first one to sign your cast
Ah, if you want  guess, but 'm getting it off tomorrow, so there's no point really
1 , cool
Well, welcome back, man
() 10
: (2) 2 Yeah, welcome back, dude
The kids steps away, feeling awkward

is in gym class, another roll call
looks up
He notices a guy high up in the bleachers smoking a cigarette and staring at him through long hair
looks concerned
Is this Hesher, the guy with the garden shears
/  - is walking down the hall
He looks over and sees Hesher who's wearing a Misfits "Skull" -shirt, watching him through the crowd
Suddenly  is grabbed and slammed against a locker
It's Dustin Howard and his posse
Dustin towers over him
'up now, punk
You don't look so tough now, do you
() 11
: attempts to walk away
Dustin pushes him against the locker
tries to walk away again
Leave me alone
How about you suck my cock
Dustin slams him again
stays put
(') Huh
Suck my cock
tries to walk
Dustin slams him
(') Suck my cock
tries to leave again, Dustin pushes him again
(') Suck my cock
Yeah, yeah,  heard you
Suck your cock
Then why don't you pull it out
What'd you say, bitch
tries to walk away
Dustin grabs him and throws him down
(') Don't fuckin' talk back to me
squirms trying to free himself, kicking wildly
One of 's kicks catches Dustin
Dustin punches him
crowd quickly gathers
Fight, fight, fight
/ '  - The school  flips through papers in a file
Look,
know you've been through a lot and it's gonna take time to readjust, but as you know, the school can't tolerate this kind of behavior
() () 12
: (') 'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt this time, but you can't be starting fights
didn't start anything
He pushed me
What he did or didn't do isn't important
What's important is what you do, and how you react
Do you understand
Not really
Which part don't you understand
don't understand the part about how it's not important that he pushed me and he punched me and he kicked me and he told me to suck his cock and now 'm the bad guy sitting in the office
The counsellor cuts him off
Hey, hey, hey
do not wanna hear that kind of language in my office
Yeah, but  didn't - Listen, 'm gonna cut you some slack, but you're gonna have to meet me halfway here
shakes his head
He gives up on this conversation
He looks out the window
Hesher is out there - smoking and watching
is suddenly unnerved
(') should really be suspending you, but won't if you can promise me you'll put in a real effort
(noticing  looking ) Are you listening
() 13
: (2) Yeah,
- It's after school
walks out to his bike
It's the last one left on the rack
Only a couple of other kids are still on campus
looks around
He jumps on his bike and quickly rides off
- enters the house, which is quiet except for the sounds of a There are no lights on so it feels dark
He walks past the  room, the  is on
Dad is on his back, fast asleep, mouth wide open
He barely seems alive, until he makes a small whimper
His mouth closes, he swallows, then his mouth drops open again
picks up the remote control from a mess of empty pill bottles on the coffee table and switches off the
walks past the kitchen and drops his backpack
/ '  - walks past his grandma's bedroom
The door is open
He gently knocks
She's sitting up in bed, reading
Hi, pumpkin
Hey
stands in the doorway
Grandma takes off her glasses
How was your day
Pretty much sucked
Why sweetheart
thinks for a moment
don't know
It just sucked
() 14
: Grandma looks at  with an empathetic nod
(') Do you want me to turn on the light for you
Do  look like 'm sitting in darkness here
don't know, maybe, a little
Maybe  need new glasses
She holds her glasses up for closer inspection
(') Actually,  don't even know if these are mine
Whose are they
Geez,  don't know
Well, can you see better with them
Jesus,  don't know
Grandma holds the glasses in different positions
(') You know my mother always told me that 'd damage my eyes if  read by poor light and  always think about that when 'm reading, but 've gotten this far, so why am  still worrying about it
Why am  even reading
There's something more  need to learn
She give this a moment of thought
(') guess there's always something more to learn
() 15
: (2) She seems almost tickled by this
She slips her bookmark in her book and puts it on her bedside table
(') Is is your dad up yet
No
Why, has he been sleeping all day
Well, you know, sometimes people get knocked off course a little when bad things happen
But they come good in the end
/  - sits at the kitchen table alone staring at a cute and happy bunny salt and pepper shakers
He can see in through to the room where Grandma is shaking Dad awake on the couch for dinner and holding a glass of milk for him
Dad lifts himself off the couch
Grandma hands him the glass of milk
Here's some milk to wet your whistle
Thanks mom
Dad shuffles into the kitchen and takes his seat at the table
Dad empties a couple of pills into his palm and downs them with milk
forks his food around his plate
(') Hey Teej
Hey
Take some applesauce, sweetheart
What's the time
It's six o'clock
Have you been sleeping all day
() 16
: just had to lay down for a bit
Dad looks up but doesn't seem to notice 's bruised face
(') How was school
Fine
When are you going back to work
That's a good question
Dad scrapes a mouthful onto his fork, avoiding the good question
moment passes
stares at him
Are you gonna answer it
don't know
'm not ready yet
Dad's eyes are lowered
He stares at his plate
watches him, feeling powerless
'm not ready yet either
They eat in silence
, would you please pass me the salt
passes the bunny salt shaker
(') Did you know that when Albert Einstein interviewed people for a job, he would take them out for lunch and if they put salt on their food before tasting it, he would not give them the job
Grandma looks up at  with a small grin
She sets the salt shaker down
(') 've always liked that
17
'  - sits on the bed in a doctor's office
The  is cutting off his cast with a little buzz saw
The doctor pulls the cast free and inspects 's arm
It is pale and skinny compared to the other
(referring to the smell) Whoa, that's like an eight week old dirty sock
, so how does that feel
You wanna turn your wrist like this for me
The doctor demonstrates
imitates
(') And like this
The doctor twists his wrist in a different direction
does the same
The doctor looks for a pen
(') Any pain or discomfort
don't know
It feels kinda weird, can't tell
It will feel strange for a few days, but should start to feel normal again soon
Alright, lookin' good
s'pose should write you a note for school
The doctor writes the note
While he does so he makes chit chat
(') How's your Dad doing
Not great
don't know
You should probably just ask him yourself
/  - Mrs
Elsberry drones on from the front of the class
() 18
: If we consider that dreams serve a metaphoric function in narrative fiction, as they do in life, what metaphoric function would you suggest the dreams here are serving
sits in the back of the class, by the window
little pebble hits 's desk
It bounces onto the floor looks around to find where it came from - and then another one hits him in the head
He looks out the window
Hesher is right outside the window
He takes the cap off of a large
He holds it up to his nose and takes a long slow inhale
He exhales slow and long, staring hard at
looks around confused
Hesher recaps the marker, throws it hard at  and wanders off
The marker hits , then falls to floor near his feet
He reaches for it
Mrs
Elsberry sees this
(') What are you doing
Please pass that forward
passes the marker forward
Mrs
Elsberry sets the marker on her desk
(') You can collect this after class
She continues back to the chalkboard
(
) (') , so for our protagonist, are these dreams premonitions or desires or even nightmares perhaps
- It's after school
Kids are leaving campus
wheels his bike across the school yard
- rides his bike down the street
Dustin's appears beside him
Dustin is boiling
You're fuckin' dead
() 19
: We see that someone has drawn - in    - a crude picture of a body, sitting on a toilet with a big erect penis
The picture is drawn on the side of Dustin's Mustang door, so his real head lines up with the drawing
It's drawn in perspective so it looks like Dustin's head is attached to the naked defecating body to outsiders
The words '  ' have been scrawled beside the picture
Dustin swerves the car toward , narrowly missing him
cuts into a large super market parking lot, attempting to get away
Dustin accelerates ahead of  and screeches to a halt in front of him, cutting him off, almost hitting him
stumbles and falls off his bike
His bike lands on top of him
Dustin jumps out of his car and starts beating  in the middle of parking lot traffic
struggles just to protect himself, cowering on the ground and covering his head
Dustin tries to wrestle  free of the bike so as to get a clearer shot at him
He drags  by his -shirt, ripping it off in the process
And then a '  - (
) Hey
Dustin ignores the voice
He continues beating
(
) (') Hey
Leave him alone
Dustin ignores again
(') Hey
said stop it
Dustin ignores one last time - a beat passes, then the woman, (mid-20s), appears behind Dustin and jumps onto his back, bear hugging his face
Leave him alone
Dustin shakes erratically, Nicole has a tight grip on him, but eventually Dustin manages to throw her onto the ground
What the fuck are you doing lady
Nicole picks herself up off the ground and holds up her fists like she's ready to fight
She doesn't look very tough
() 20
: (2) What are you doing
Nicole stands defiantly between Dustin and
Dustin looks around at the scene he's created in the street
man steps out of his car
Dustin realizes it's time to go
( ) 'm not finished, you fuck
He gets back into his car, slams the door and speeds off
Nicole watches him go, then helps  up
is shirtless, scrawny, dirty and traumatized
Are you alright
don't know
() Am  bleeding
don't think so
Am
don't know
grabs his -shirt and pulls it back on
He picks his bike up off the ground and hops on
He goes to peddle, but the chain is busted
His peddling goes nowhere
'  - Nicole drives
is in the passenger seat
's bike is crammed in the back
can't believe he called me lady
Do look like a lady to you
don't know,  guess
Thanks
mean do  look old
Well anyway, at least  can say 've been in a fight
She thinks about this for a beat
is silent
() 21
: (') can't believe he called me lady
notices an ice-cream cone sitting in a cup-holder between the seats
think your ice cream's melting
Oh shit
She tries to pick it up, suddenly flustered
It drips everywhere
She doesn't know what to do with it
It's too melted to eat
(') Ah, fuck it
She throws it out the window
(') Hey, so 'm kinda like a hero now, aren't
looks over confused
What
Well actually,  basically just didn't want to have to go home and then spend the rest of the day feeling bad about the fact that  didn't help you and then hear about you on the news being beat to death in the parking lot
So you know, really 'm just -  did it for me
'm just selfish
() And 'm sorry, 'm sorry 'm like that
is silent, he has no idea how to respond to this girl
She spots a gas station
(') Oh, gas station
She quickly makes an illegal turn into oncoming traffic
Cars honk at her
() 22
: (2) (') Whoaaa
sorry, sorry
'  /   - They pull up next to a gas pump
Perfect landing
She gets out of the car
(') You like black or red
Ah,  don't know, black
Black
Really
Are you sure
, red
Nicole walks off
watches her for a beat then his eye wanders over the contents of her messy car
He picks up a white name tag from the coin tray between the seats
It reads: ' - Hi my name is , how can  help you
looks up and sees Nicole heading back to the car
He puts the name tag down as the car door opens and Nicole gets in
She hands him a stick of red licorice covered in green sugar
(') Red it is
'  - Nicole and  are driving
They eat sour licorice
's not enjoying it, but not wanting her to know this
It's super sour isn't it
You don't have to eat it if you don't like it
It's really sour
() 23
: know, that's the point
used to hate this crazy sour stuff,  don't know what happened
just recently acquired a taste for it
don't even really know what's in it, but  pretty much eat it all the time
And 'm sure it's making me fat
just don't want to end up like those fat old ladies you sometimes see, you know, the really fat ones
doesn't know what to make of her
(') don't know why 'm telling you this
Anyway,  was secretly hoping that you loved these - Holding up the licorice, then taking a bite
(') So you could eat 'em for me
But now can see you don't like em' and 'm kinda glad cuz it means more for me guess 'm sort of a hypocrite in a way
She smiles at that
attempts to smile back, but he's so confused he ends up making a strange face
He awkwardly looks away
- Nicole's car pulls up
gets out and notices a dirty black van creeping slowly around the corner toward them
This makes him very nervous
, thanks for the ride
really appreciate it
He hurries to the door
Hey
turns
(') You want your bike
() 24
: notices his bike still in Nicole's back seat
Shit
rushes back
He drags it out of her car
(') Thanks
He wheels it back towards the house
goes around the side of the house to the back door
He knocks on the back door
Grandma appears at the door
Hi,
What you doing around the back
Grandma lets  in
is nervous
/  - just,  dunno
was just dumping my bike
heads for the living room
(') () Hey, Dad
Your Dad's gone to the supermarket, honey
Everything
Ah, yeah,
But  isn't listening
He can't stop thinking about that black van
He exits the kitchen
/   - walks the hall carefully to the front door
He squints through the peephole
The black van is parked directly in front of the house
can't see properly through the hole
He turns, to get a better look through the  room window
25
/   - turns to the living room
There is Hesher standing in the middle of the room with a dirty duffel bag over his shoulder
is petrified
They stand looking at each other for a long moment
Where's the laundry room
My dad'll be home soon
Where's the laundry room
Why
You've got two seconds to tell me where the laundry room is before tear your fuckin' head off and skull fuck you
points to a door off the lounge
It's through there
But why
You can't - my dad's gonna be home soon
Hesher stares at him for a second, then heads for the door
/  - Hesher empties his sack into the washing machine
steps into the room, wary
Hesher ignores him
Hesher strips off his -shirt and jeans and add them to the load
He's now standing in the laundry room wearing underwear only
sees bad burn scars running down Hesher's thighs
Hesher pours laundry detergent liberally into the machine
What are you doing
You can't - Hesher turns on a dime and grabs  by his throat and pins him against the wall
() 26
: swear to god
'll cut your face off
He closes the lid
He wrenches the dial around and clicks 'start'
The machine begins a loud cycle
Hesher exits follows awkwardly
/   - Hesher sits in the middle of the couch and lights a cigarette
You can't smoke in here
Hesher drags deep and blows the smoke out in a long whistle straight into the air above him
(') You can't smoke
Hesher flicks his cigarette, ashing on the floor
(') What are you doing
You can't smoke in here
Hesher looks at him and ashes on the couch
(') Will you please put it out
Can  put it out in your mouth
What
Wait
/  - enters the kitchen
Grandma is crumbing chicken fillets at the counter
She's listening to loud talk radio
goes straight for the cupboards and looks through them
Grandma turns, eyebrows raised
She turns the radio down
'm gonna make a cake
Do you remember my cherry cake story
gets down on his knees and digs his way through the cupboard while Grandma rambles, continuing her chicken crumbing
() 27
: (') used to make a cherry cake all the time and it always came out just wonderful
One time  invited my doctor and his wife and  wanted to make an impression
asked him to come see your dad in a play and he came and  said, 'would you like to come back to the house
' emerges from the cupboard with a bowl
He turns toward the sink and begins to fill it with water
(') And he said, or his wife said, 'yes they'd like to come back
' So earlier that day  made a cherry cake and used a -  didn't know it till afterwards,  used a new product - instead of Crisco,  used Fluffo
They never made it again that Fluffo
Grandma, can  hear the rest of your story later
'm kinda busy
Oh, of course honey
/   - enters, carrying the bowl
Hesher is on the couch, smoking
The  is now on
He flips channels
stands next to Hesher
Hesher looks at him
The front door opens and Dad enters, wearing old sweatpants, a dirty -shirt, and carrying a plastic grocery bag
He stops when he sees the practically naked, greasy-haired guy smoking on the couch (his 'bed')
It's a strange moment
, who's this
After a long uncomfortable silence, Hesher stands and extends his hand
My name's Hesher
Call me Hesher
() 28
: Paul has to rearrange the bags to shake his hand
Hesher sits back down
( ) What's he doing
He's doing laundry
They stand looking at each other
is just plain stressed out
Why is he smoking in the house
don't know
Hesher continues flipping channels
He's not finding anything he wants
Did you tell him he can't
Yes
How come you only have four channels
Hesher gets up off the couch and exits the room
/  - Hesher enters the kitchen
Grandma is still crumbing chicken
He starts going through drawers right next to her
He doesn't acknowledge her
Grandma notices him, but not seemingly his cigarette, his state of undress or his complete stranger-ness
Hello there
Hello, old lady
His cigarette is done
He flicks it into the sink
It sizzles out
He opens another drawer
Dad enters with his grocery bag
() 29
: ( ) Can  help you with something
Hesher shuts the drawer
He's holding a fork
Nope, 'm good
He exits the kitchen
/  - Hesher strides across the back lawn in his underwear
and Dad step out the door and watch him
Hesher reaches a telephone pole and climbs it nimbly like a monkey
At the top, he fiddles around with the fork, banging and wrenching at the cable box
He drops the fork to the ground and begins his descent
Only a couple of feet from the ground, he loses his grip and falls, crashing down into a thick bush at the base of the pole
Motherfucker
and Dad stand staring frozen
Hesher lifts himself up out of the bushes, brushes himself off and heads back to the house
He walks right past them and back inside
/   - Hesher sits back down on the couch and begins to flip through the newly acquired channels
He finds porn and drops the remote down beside him
He sits back and watches girl-on-girl action
and Dad stand just inside the  room, stunned, watching the newly acquired porn
Then a   marking the end of the wash's cycle sounds from the laundry room
Hesher gets up off the couch and heads for it
stunned and silent (bar the porn noise) moment later, follows
() 30
: Dad picks up the remote and switches the  off
/  - Hesher loads his wet laundry into the dryer
's nervous
So, ah, what are you doing now
Hesher slams the dryer door shut and wrenches the dial around
The dryer starts up loud
Hesher pretends he can't hear
Huh
He turns and looks into the garage which is right off the laundry room
He points inside
(') () This your room
(huh
) That's the garage
Hesher walks into the garage with his bag and slams the door leaving  standing in the laundry room with the noisy dryer
/   - sits at the dinner table with Dad and Grandma
From the garage we hear a muffled bass guitar playing loud and heavy
Does your friend want to eat some dinner dear
He's not hungry
Are you sure
Yeah, 'm sure
What's he doing in the garage
() 31
: don't know
said he could practice his guitar in there
That's great honey, it's nice having a bit of music in the house again
Is he a new friend
Yeah, sort of
You know your grandfather played the harmonica for many years
doesn't respond
He eats
Dad looks on perplexed, yet disconnected
/  - is dressed for school, wet hair
He brushes his teeth
We can hear the sound of cartoons in the background
stops brushing and listens a second
He hasn't heard cartoons at this hour in a long time
/   - enters the  room
Dad is lying on the couch
Hesher sits on an armchair eating a bowl of cereal and watching cartoons
stands for a beat and watches them
This is strange
/  - enters the kitchen
Grandma pulls a bottle of orange juice out of the fridge
() Hesher, would you like a glass of orange juice
(
) Ah, yeah
Sure
Morning,
Hi, Grandma
() 32
: goes to the counter
He pours cereal into a bowl
He grabs the milk carton
He pours it into the bowl, but the carton's empty
Oh, 'm sorry, honey
We're out of milk
can cook you up some eggs if you like, dear
No, thanks
don't have time
leans back and looks into the  room at Hesher enjoying his milky cereal
Would you like to come for a walk with me today
can't, Grandma
gotta go to school
No,  mean later
This afternoon
grabs his backpack
don't know
Can you ask me when get home
, honey
/   - The lunch yard is busy
The crowd clears a moment and we find sitting on a bench in the shade, alone and depressed, hidden away from the other kids
He drinks from a can of soda
- rides his bike into the car lot
stands staring at the crashed red Volvo (from the opening scene) that is parked on the lot
He takes a few deep breaths
33
/  - walks up to an open office door and knocks
Inside is He looks up
Yes
need to talk to you
Oh, yeah
What about
enters and sits opposite
want to get the car back
Yeah,  figured that
You made it pretty clear the last time you were here, and  thought  made it pretty clear that  couldn't give it to you
What do  need to do to get it back
The car's not for sale
want to get it back, though
How much do you want for it
Larry takes a breath
He doesn't want to be having this conversation
He counts the obstacles out on his fingers
don't know
We're talking at least eighteen hundred dollars, not including taxes, registration, , or dealer's fees
On top of that, you'd need a driver's license
'm guessing you don't have one of those
You'd need valid car insurance
'm guessing you don't have that either
But even if you did have these things,  still couldn't sell it to you because the car's not street legal
There's a million reasons why  can't sell it to you
() 34
: For a second it seems Larry feels sympathetic toward
(') Look kid,  appreciate your enthusiasm,  really do, but  don't know what to tell you
You can't have the car
End of story
churns all this over in his head
Larry thinks he's made himself clear
He motions to the papers on his desk
(') Do you mind if  get back to it here
/  - walks out of Larry's office, forlorn
He walks across the showroom, head down, mumbling angrily to himself
He is stopped by a hand on his chest
It's Dustin
You're lucky 'm at work right now
- sits on his bike staring at a Ralph's supermarket
'  - Nicole is at the checkout, checking grocery items
She finishes with a customer and  appears next in line, with an ice cream cone
Hi Sir, how are you today
Oh, hey
Hey
How's it goin'
got you a replacement ice cream
Nicole is a little taken aback
Oh my god
That's so sweet, thanks
smiles awkwardly
He hands her the cone
() 35
: paid for it over there
He points to the ice cream counter on the other side of the store
Oh,
She holds the cone, not quite sure what to do with it, not quite sure how to take this kid
(') Thanks
() Sure,
See ya
walks away
See ya
Nicole watches him leave while a line of customers wait to be served
She smiles at the next customer, sharing the moment
(') (to next customer) Hi
She starts checking the customer's items, still holding her melting cone
She looks up out the door
She can see  outside, shaking his head and mumbling to himself
He feels like an idiot
- enters the house
Dad isn't on the couch
He heads for the kitchen
He stops abruptly in the doorway
/  - Hesher and Grandma are at the counter
Grandma is baking an apple pie
Hesher is joyfully eating the apple slices she is preparing for the pie
They don't notice
() 36
: - and his wife said, yes they'd like to come back to the house
' So earlier that day  made a cherry cake and used a new product -  didn't know it till afterwards-  used Fluffo
They never made it again that Fluffo
It was an imitation brand
served the cake and there was silence
And then - Grandma makes a clicking sound with her tongue on the roof of her mouth
(') () You put the cake in your mouth and it stuck to the roof of your mouth
They could hardly swallow it
Hesher finds Grandma's story amusing, he laughs, never losing a beat while eating the delicious apple slices
Grandma notices that  is standing in the doorway
(') ( ) Hi sweetheart
Hesher glances over, he clearly doesn't give a shit about is not impressed with Hesher either
/  - , Grandma, Dad and Hesher all sit at the dinner table
They eat in an awkward silence
Grandma breaks the ice
So who's coming for a walk with me tomorrow morning
Again silence
Clearly no one is jumping at this opportunity
(') can't Grandma
have school tomorrow
Ok, well you're always invited
() 37
: Silence again
The sounds of chewing add to the awkwardness of this dinner
So what
Everyone turns toward Hesher
This is the first thing to come out of his mouth all night
He's looking at
(') So what school
Go on a walk with your Grandma
Grandma lights up
He's right , it'd be very good for you to get some fresh air
Your Grandma goes walking in the morning by herself
You can't get your ass outta bed like an hour earlier
She could get raped
Dad stops chewing
looks at Hesher like he's crazy
(') read about this shit all the time
Grandmas get raped
You ever hear about that guy who killed like 13 old ladies
What
Fuckin' Google it, dude
The Granny Killer, he killed like hella old ladies by strangling them with their dirty panties
(taking a mouthful) Not all of them necessarily got fucked, but they all got penetrated by like the dude's fingers and  don't know, other shit too
That's enough
() 38
: (2) ( ) just think your Grandma asks you to go on a walk, you should go with her so she doesn't get raped
Why would anyone rape me
don't know, they do it, Grandma
There's some sick fucks out there
That's enough
Everyone continues to eat in silence
stares at Hesher who is shovelling food into his mouth
/   - sits alone in the busy yard, nibbling halfheartedly on crackers from his lunch bag
Kid 1 from the locker scene earlier appears beside him
1 Hey, Teej
What are you doing
Come sit with us, we're in our spot
What
Uh, Ok
gets up reluctantly, then notices Hesher walking across the yard towards the bathroom followed by an   with a skateboard
(') 'll meet you there in a second
walks off, following Hesher
Kid 1 watches  walk off toward the bathroom
/  - enters the bathroom
He hears voices coming from a back stall
He walks towards them
In the end stall  finds Hesher finishing a drug deal with the Emo kid
Hesher hands him a bag of pot
The kid hands him money
stands and watches
The kid leaves
() 39
: Hesher shoves the money in his pocket, ignoring
He unzips his fly and turns to urinate in the bowl
What are you doing here
Pissing
What are you doing at my school
'm putting out a fire
notices that he isn't actually urinating in the bowl
He's spraying his pee all over the seat and the lid and the wall and the floor
He finishes and zips up
He turns and shoves past
Hesher looks at his hair in the mirror, then exits
watches him leave, frustrated
He follows him out
/  - sees Hesher disappear through the crowd
From behind,  is grabbed and dragged back into the bathroom
/  - is swung by his backpack across the bathroom
His backpack gets ripped off him and he goes down, sliding across the pissy floor
He looks up
It's Dustin, seriously angry
leaps up and shoves Dustin back
Dustin stumbles backwards and trips over 's bag in the middle of the bathroom floor
Dustin falls and lands on his ass
He flounders embarrassingly
knows he's a dead man
Dustin jumps up and grabs  by the back of his head
He shoves 's face down onto the filthy urinal tray
struggles
You fucked my car, you little prick
Dustin holds 's head down in the tray
He shoves his face into the little yellow urinal deodorizer cake
(') Eat the cake
goes to lift himself up
Dustin punches him and then stands, putting his foot on 's neck, jamming 's head into the tray
He pushes the flusher
The urinal flushes all over 's face
() 40
: (') Fuckin' eat it
Hesher comes back into the bathroom
Dustin turns and looks at him, sensing danger
looks up from the bathroom floor, eyes pleading for help
Hesher walks calmly towards  and Dustin
But instead of saving , he walks straight past them and into the stall where he just completed his drug deal
He grabs his cigarette lighter from the top of toilet tank
He lights a cigarette, takes a long drag, blows the smoke in the air and walks back out again
Dustin watches him go
He puts another boot into
(') It's your birthday
Eat your fuckin' cake
- waits with his bike in the street outside the school
He's beat up, wet and dirty
School's out
Most kids have already left
Dad pulls up in Grandma's maroon Buick
He gets out and opens the back door for 's bike
You ready
don't wanna go
It'll be good for us, Teej
'mon
We'll be late
Dad takes 's bike and starts trying to fit it in the backseat
really don't want to go
don't think anyone ever 'wants to go' to these things
It's supposed to be good for us
That's the whole point
stands watching his Dad struggle with the bike
(') 'mon
Give me a hand here
41
- and Dad sit on beanbags set out in a circle of about 12
Eight of these beanbags have people sitting on them - adults and a few kids
Some drink tea and coffee from little styrofoam cups
The tone is sombre
Dad and  look unsure of themselves
The chairperson of the meeting is , a 42 year-old grief counsellor
, so welcome everyone to the Transformational Grief Group
My name is Meryl
We should start off by going around the circle and introducing ourselves and briefly explaining why we are here
Hi Miss, would you please start us off
heavy set woman, , and her husband, , sit on beanbags looking pale and sad
We are the Bolder family
am Coleen and this is my husband Jack
Our daughter Cynthia was murdered last year
(she chokes a bit) She was the victim of a violent attack that was unfair and sick
She can't go on
Her husband Jack sets his hand on her shoulder
She is able to hold back the tears
(') We are here because we need help
We lost our baby and we are broken
Hi, my name is Jack
As my wife said, we're here hoping for some answers and just some help with the pain
Thank you, Coleen and Jack
Welcome
Weird silence
(') (to Dad and ) Sir
Dad shuffles in his seat, looks around the group
() 42
: Ah,
Sure
My name is Paul Forney
This is my son,
We're here today because we lost my wife, 's mother, a bit more than two months ago now
And ah,  don't know, we're still trying to come to terms with things and, you know, just find some guidance of some kind,  guess, and, ah, yeah, so
Dad finishes mid-sentence, then brief silence
, great
Welcome, Paul
Would you like to introduce yourself, say a few words to the group
Not really
Meryl waits to see if  has anything more to add
He doesn't
That's
(to the person next to ) Nicholas, would you like to introduce yourself to the group
/  - Dad and  pull into the driveway of the Forney house
Hesher's van is parked haphazardly on the lawn
looks at it with venom - a reminder of the afternoon
- bursts through the front door
He walks through the  room to the laundry room
He rips open the door to the garage and flicks on the light
It's empty except for a little pile of Hesher's stuff
He walks back through the living room as Dad walks in through the front door, closing it behind him
heads to the kitchen
/  - enters the kitchen
Grandma is baking
() 43
: Hi, honey
How was your special group
Fine
exits the kitchen
He walks the hall to the bathroom
He turns the handle and enters
/  - Hesher is having a bubble bath, smoking a cigarette, totally calm
immediately lets rip
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
You let that fuck stick my head in a toilet and you don't do anything about it
You stand there and fucking watch him do it
Hesher ignores
He watches him closely
He calmly takes a drag of his cigarette and ashes into the bath
(') You stay in my grandma's house
You're taking a bath in my fucking grandma's bath
Hesher flicks his butt in the bath and pulls the plug
He stays reclined as the water starts gurgling down the drain
Hesher stands
He's totally naked
He doesn't care
waits for him to say something
Anything
Hesher steps out of the bath, dripping wet, naked
(') Say something
shoves him
Hesher, in a flash, grabs  by throat and slams him against the wall
He holds him there for a second, staring at him intensely
() Listen to me
() () 44
: (') 'm gonna put some clothes on, then you're gonna meet me in my van
Hesher lets go of  and walks out of the bathroom naked
'  - and Hesher drive through the dark streets of Fair Oaks
Hesher finishes a cigarette
Wind blows in his hair
The van rattles
The Sex Pistol's 'Anarchy in the ' is blasting
is still angry
Where are we going
Hesher ignores him
(') Where are we going
After a beat,  turns the music down
Touch my stereo again, 'll seriously fucking hurt you
Hesher turns the music back up
is confused
Hesher drives into a gas station and pulls on the handbrake
He lights another cigarette
/  - What are we doing
Hesher gets out of the van and slams the door shut
He goes around the back of the van and opens the back doors
He pulls something out and shuts the doors again
Through the side-view mirror,  can see Hesher filling up a big beat-up plastic gas container
He continues to smoke
'  - Hesher brings the van to a quiet halt across the street from a suburban house
He kills the engine and surveys the area
has no idea where they are
What are we - () 45
: catches himself asking questions, but stops himself mid- sentence
He looks out the window and across the street and sees Dustin Howard's   parked in the drive
(') ( ) What are you doing
Hesher smiles to himself - he's looking forward to this
He opens the van door and climbs out
is in a quiet panic
'  - Hesher opens the van's back doors and grabs the container of gasoline
appears beside him, still panicked
Hey, seriously
What are you doing
Hesher makes his way across the street toward the house and the yellow Mustang
He pours gasoline all over the car
He does this with confidence - he's clearly had some practice
(') (loud whisper - too loud) Come on
This is insane
Let's get out of here
Hesher ignores him and continues dousing the car with gas
The porch light comes on
Someone peels open the front window curtains and looks out
and Hesher drop to the ground behind the Mustang
is terrified
He looks over to Hesher who is smiling, in his element, this is the happiest we have seen him
The curtains close but the porch light stays on
Unfazed, Hesher hops back up and empties the gas can onto the Mustang
Hesher stands a moment, admiring the car, saying a silent goodbye to it perhaps, as he pulls a single bent cigarette from his pocket
He straightens it, then lights it with a match
(') ( ) 'mon, man
Let's just go
Hesher takes one long drag on the cigarette, then calmly flicks the still lit match onto the Mustang
() 46
: Instantly, it erupts in flames
Hesher picks up the gas can and walks calmly back to the van follows still franticly looking back at the car and the house
Hesher gets in the van and throws the gas can into the back
goes to the passenger door
It's locked
He wrestles the handle, panicking
(') Open the door
It's locked
Hesher starts the van and pulls away, leaving  stranded in the street
The front door of the house opens and a woman appears on the porch
Discovering the car in flames, she screams
takes off, running across the street and through a neighbor's yard, down the side of the neighbor's house, with the woman on the porch screaming at him
Hey, get back here
&  - runs
He jumps fences and slips down the sides of houses
He's running fast and breathing hard
He finds his way out onto another dark and quiet street
He stops
He has no idea where he is or where to go
Then -  appear at the end of the street
They bear down on him slowly
stands immobile
He can now see it is Hesher's van, approaching slow and menacing
The van stops about 10 feet from
moment's stand off
Then Hesher sticks his head out the window
Get in
You fucking ditched me
Get in the van, dude
() 47
: doesn't move
He stares
Hesher  the engine
Hesher revs the engine some more
still doesn't move
Hesher
- the headlights of the van bear down on him
Hesher slams on the brakes and the van screeches to a halt inches from 's nose
doesn't flinch
He and Hesher stare at each other through the windshield
Hesher smiles
He's impressed
walks around to the passenger door
'  - climbs in the passenger seat of the van
He's surly
What the fuck's wrong with you
What
What's wrong with you
What's the problem
That's the guy who put you in the toilet
Yeah, but - Hesher suddenly freezes, looks round, motions for  to 'shhh'
() Something's coming
looks around everywhere
What's coming
Then Hesher lets out a
He laughs
He puts the van in gear and drives
He cranks up the music
stares at Hesher for a moment, then looks straight ahead shaking his head

/ '  - wakes in bed, still shell-shocked from the previous night
He sits up and rubs his eyes
/  - stands at the sink and begins to brush his teeth
He hears the
He hears muffled voices outside
/  - exits the bathroom, still brushing and walks the hall toward the voices
Hesher is standing shirtless in the front doorway eating a banana, blocking the view to outside
As  nears the front door, Hesher turns and moves away to reveal Grandma talking to two uniformed police officers
It's for you
Hesher disappears back into the house, smiling at  as he passes
Are you Thomas Forney
(toothbrush in mouth) Yeah
We'd like to ask you some questions
What about
We'd like you to come down to the station with us
What for
(
) What's going on

: turns
His Dad is now sitting up on the couch, blinking in the light
He's in his boxers
His hair's a mess
He's dopey
He's just woken up
Hesher emerges from the kitchen, heading back to the garage, carrying a glass of orange juice
( ) Cops
- 's - is taken
's  are taken
and his Dad sit in an interview room
Dad looks confused, dopey and dishevelled
uniformed police officer enters with a file
He shuts the door and sits
, so we're gonna have to let you go now
We may very well be calling on you again very soon, but in the meantime, let this be a warning to you
Regardless of what evidence we do or don't find, you've come to our attention today
Our attention isn't good
But  didn't do anything
You hearing me here
These are very serious crimes we've been presented with
Let's just say someone had been in that car, and they'd burned - to death
We'd be talking about manslaughter, possibly murder
Have you thought about that
You'd be sitting here with detectives from Homicide right now
These are felony offences we're talking about, son
Serious jail-time offences
nods, his dad looks on
50
'  - 's in the passenger seat
His dad drives
They sit in silence for a little while
Then dad speaks- Did you do it
pauses before answering
Not really
Not really
didn't do it
What does `not really' mean
ignores him, stares out the car window
(') Tell me what `not really' means
It means  didn't do it
No, it doesn't
Why would you say 'not really'
didn't
You did
heard you
said  didn't do it
Yeah, before that
asked if you did it
You said `not really'
can't remember what  said
Why would you do something like that

: Dad pulls the car into the driveway and comes to an abrupt stop
Hesher is sitting in a lawn chair in the middle of the driveway, sunbathing with his shirt off, drinking beer
He has a farmer's tan
jumps out
Dad stares at Hesher from inside the car
Howdy
walks past Hesher without looking at him
/ '  - enters and slams his door shut
sits on his bed
Hesher enters without warning
So what'd the pigs want
What the fuck do you think
Did they give you a cavity search
What
Did any of the cops put their fingers in your butthole
Just fuck off,
What'd they do
They took my fucking finger prints
So what
So what
can get into serious trouble
Oh, is that right
() 52
: Yeah, that's right
They don't take this shit lightly
Oh, they don't
People could have been hurt
If someone was killed it would have been considered murder
Hesher feigns concern
Really
Murder
() That's badass shit
Please just leave me alone
, but first show me your best impression of a dumpling
What
You know, a dumpling, the Chinese little thingies you eat - Hesher holds up his thumb and index finger to show the size of a dumpling
shakes his head, he's not finding this funny
(') Come on, like this - Hesher constricts all the muscles on his face imitating a dumpling, he looks ridiculous
tries to hold back a smile, but Hesher looks so absurd he can't
(') , your turn
shakes his head, fighting a smile
No
() 53
: (2) And Hesher is gone in a flash
/    - is hiding, peering down an aisle, watching Nicole working at the check out scanning groceries
can falls from one of the shelves just in front of him
It startles him
And then another one falls
He steps along the shelf to where the cans fell
He looks through to the next aisle
Nothing
Then a voice from behind him
Do you think she is totally bald or do you think she's more of a landing strip kind of chick or more of a 70's jungle bitch
is startled
Hesher stands behind him, also watching Nicole
What are doing here
You're stalking that chick, dude
No, 'm not
Yeah, you are
've been stalking you for half an hour
You gonna try to fuck her
What
No
Can't fuck her from here, dude
Gotta be way closer
Shut up about it
You wanna poke her clam
Shut up
() 54
: is freaked and embarrassed
He walks away down the aisle
Hesher follows
You wanna poke her clam or what
Please stop saying that
walks ahead fast
He wants out of this conversation
Nicole finishes up, turns her light off and hangs a 'Check Stand Closed' sign
She walks off toward the back of the store stops to be sure to avoid her
You want to poke her clam, dude
Nothing wrong with that
Don't be ashamed about it
Humans have been poking vagina for hundreds of years
Longer even
Hesher says this a little too loud
Nearby shoppers look over
shakes his head, then exits the store
Hesher follows
(') Bro, there's nothing wrong with wanting a little pussy
'  /   - unlocks his bike from a pole
Where you going
Home
'll give you a ride
No thanks

() 55
: (') Come on dude, don't be silly, let's just car pool
clearly doesn't want to ride his bike home, but his is reluctant to go with Hesher
Fine, just don't talk to me
won't say shit
'  /   - and Hesher load 's bike into the back of Hesher's van
Hesher closes the back doors and they get in
'  - Look dude, 'm really sorry about the fire the other night - He waits a beat for  to respond
is still mad, he says nothing
(') That was totally out of control
Foolish and irresponsible actually
looks at Hesher, doubting his sincerity
(') want you to have this - Hesher reaches into the back of the van and picks up a dirty magazine
He flips through some pages and shows  a photo
pushes the magazine away, disgusted
Get that away from me
Dude are you gay
can't work you out
Hesher spots Nicole getting into her car
He drops the magazine on 's lap and fires up the engine
spots Nicole
() 56
: Hey, what are you doing
Hesher puts the car in gear and begins to follow Nicole's car out of the parking lot
(') Stop the car,  want to get out
Shush
opens the door
Hesher grabs his arm
(') You get out of this van, 'll rip your dick off and fuck her for you
Hesher means business
is silent and back on edge
Nicole drives through the parking lot
Hesher follows her out of the lot and into the street
'  /  - Hesher bobs his head in time with a heavy metal track that blasts from the stereo
is ignoring Hesher, looking straight ahead at Nicole's car
Nicole stops at a red light behind another car
Hesher pulls up behind her and starts playing air drums to the track
The light turns green
Nicole hits the gas, running straight into the back of the car in front which hadn't started moving yet
Whoops
's first impulse is to duck
Hesher watches the road
We hear the sounds of an angry  yelling at Nicole
Through the windscreen we see the guy get out of his car, yelling at Nicole
- Nicole is flustered and begins to cry
The driver is inspecting the smashed rear end of his car
'm sorry
didn't - () 57
: You just messed up the back of my car you stupid idiot
You need to pay attention when you're driving a fucking car - (
) think  can help here
Hesher is out of the van approaching on foot, smoking
(') saw the whole thing
The chick here was stopped and you reversed right into her
What
don't know what your fucking problem is, dude
Why would you just reverse into her
That's fuckin' retarded
What are you talking about
'  - lifts himself up again to see what's going on
He sits low, concealing himself, and watches the altercation in the street
- Hesher and the driver face off
The driver is simultaneously bewildered and angry
Are you out of your mind
You better start making like you're gonna pay her for the damage
didn't back into her
don't know what you're talking about
Hesher rips his shirt off, aggressively
You calling me a fucking liar, dude
() 58
: The guy immediately begins backing down
No, , , 'm just saying  don't know what's going on here
You're calling me a fucking liar is what's going on here
Hesher pushes the guy hard
(') Let's go
Look,  don't want any trouble, sir
Fight me cocksucker
Hesher is seriously amping up the street agro
The guy doesn't know what to do
He starts heading back to his car
This is ridiculous - Come back here and find out how ridiculous it is
The guy gets in his car and speeds away, leaving Hesher (shirtless) and Nicole in the street
Hesher stubs his cigarette, now totally relaxed again
(') See you later
Hesher heads back to the van
Nicole watches him not exactly sure what to say
Hesher climbs back into his van
'  - Hesher slams the van door
is slouched way down in his chair out of sight
Hesher gets in and looks ahead
Nicole's car sputters and steam pours from under the hood
Come on man, let's just go
() 59
: Your sexy girlfriend's in trouble
We're not going anywhere
Hesher gets out
ducks
He can't see what's going on
Long seconds pass
And then his door opens
Hesher is standing there next to Nicole
(') You know,
This is now beyond embarrassing for
He can't even think straight
Hey
- and Hesher push Nicole's car off to the side of the road
'  - Hesher drives
Nicole's in the passenger seat shaken by the turn her day has taken
is in the back
Sometimes, you know, a day is bad and then when you think it couldn't get any worse you suddenly discover whole new ways it can get worse
Hesher reaches over her and pulls a joint from the glove compartment
He lights the joint and takes a big toke
He offers it to Nicole
(') No, thanks
Hesher shrugs and takes another big toke then offers it to who also declines
() 60
: This one time  had like four hella drunk chicks in the back of the van, and we were going for it and  had one hand on this one girl's tit and my other hand on this other chick's twat, but there was like still two other girls wanting to get off so like  had my foot rubbing on one girl's asshole while 'm trying to eat the other girl out, and  was going crazy man
It was too much
couldn't work out which chick was which and 'm making one girl cum but then 'm forgetting about the others and my tongue's hurting and my fingers are getting tired and like eventually  was just like 'Fuck this
This is too much' and  just stepped back
just stepped back
And before you know it these girls are all working on each other, you know
They're all fingering each other and eating each other out, you know, and jerk myself off and everyone's a winner, you know
Nicole looks at Hesher like he's crazy
is in the back - he can't believe what's coming out of Hesher's mouth
moment passes
Was that some kind of perverted metaphor for me
About how  should just step back and let things work themselves out
what
He reaches for the stereo and cranks the knob - Metallica's, 'Motorbreath'  through the speakers
As if he were possessed by the music, Hesher veers dangerously off the road onto a dirt patch
He has a crazed look in his eyes
and Nicole grab onto anything they can hold onto
Hesher turns the wheel hard and floors the gas
The van spins in circles spraying dirt in every direction
gets thrown from the back seat onto the ground
Dirt pours into the windows and covers them from head to toe
Hesher corrects the wheel and veers back onto the road again
() 61
: (2) He turns the knob on the radio to an easy listening station
UB40's 'Red Red Wine' plays
car honks as an angry driver passes
What the hell was that
Hesher looks over at Nicole
saw a mouse
What
picks himself up off the van's floor, dusting himself off
(') ( ) Are you
have dirt in my mouth
scrapes his tongue with his fingers
Nicole breaks a little smile
- The black van pulls up curb-side outside a neat suburban home
Hesher gets out and walks, covered in dirt, to the front door of the house
He looks in through the window, knocks, waits
An old man opens the door
They exchange a few words
Hesher heads back to the van and they drive off
Nicole and  seem confused
Who's that guy
Hesher says nothing
They drive three houses down the street and stop again
Hesher gets out
Again he peers in the window, knocks on the door
This time no answer
He heads back to the van
Nicole and  watch him approach from inside
He sticks his head in
We're here
Come on, let's go
We're where
My uncle's house
() 62
: Hesher walks off toward the side gate of the house
Nicole and climb out of the van and follow Hesher
Nicole seems cautious
knows he's on an adventure
Hesher jumps the  , then opens it for the others
What was that back there
What was what
That other house
Wrong house
/  - In the backyard is a swimming pool
Nicole and  stand looking in the pool
It's a nice pool with a diving board
Hesher walks up behind them and pushes them in
Nicole comes up for air
What the fuck
What
You're dirty
Yeah, and now 'm wet
Hesher smiles wide
You're dirty and wet
'm coming in
He throws his -shirt off and does a huge bomb into the pool
(') Now 'm dirty and wet too
He splashes water at her
He dives under the water
Suddenly is pulled under
Nicole can't see them under all the motion
Then  and Hesher come bursting up for air
() 63
: Cut it out
R2
Shut down all the fucken' trash compactors on the detention level
Hesher dives under the water again
Nicole squirms
Hesher has her leg
He doesn't drag her under
He just tugs her leg
She slaps at the water
He tugs her leg again
Pretty soon she's laughing
Hesher's head appears above water momentarily
(') All the fucking trash compactors
(underwater, then up again) on the detention level
He dives again
He pulls her leg
She laughs hard
watches feeling a little left out
Hesher jumps up and climbs out of the pool
He goes to a garden table nearby
(') Oh, shit
More trash coming in
He heaves the table over and into the pool
He grabs a banana lounge
(') Oh shit
He throws it in the pool
Nicole and  have to dive out of the way
They go to the sides of the pool and climb out laughing, while Hesher continues heaving garden furniture, a barbecue and anything else in reach into the water
and Nicole sit on the edge of the pool with their legs dangling in the water
They're fully clothed and soaking wet
He walks off, around the side of the house, looking for more things to break
There is an awkward silent moment between  and Nicole looks down and notices a small army of ants marching along the side of the pool
He manages to get one to crawl onto the his finger
So, how do you know this guy
don't know, he's sort of moved into my grandma's house with us
() 64
: (2) What, like he's renting a room or something
No, not really,  don't know, it's kinda a long story
flicks the ant off of his finger, then another one that's climbing up his arm
Do you realize that the equivalent to you flicking that ant would be like one of us getting hit in the face by a giant wrecking ball at 100 miles an hour and getting thrown into the next yard
stops mid ant flicking
Sorry,
Do you think the other ants are gonna wonder where that ant's gone
Do you think their gonna miss her
doesn't know how to answer
Hesher reappears with a container of lighter fluid and goes to the diving board
He climbs on and squirts the lighter fluid through his lighter, sending streams of flames into the pool
Hesher douses the diving board with lighter fluid and ignites it with his lighter
The diving board erupts into flames
(') Jesus Christ
() Jump in the fi-re
Hesher takes a few steps back then runs toward the board
He springs through the flames into the air
He does a messy sideways flip
(') () 65
: (3) He lands in the pool splashing  and Nicole
He pulls himself out and shakes his hair around like a wet dog
He looks over at the flaming diving board
(') Shit, look at that
Hesher grabs his shirt on his way toward the fence
He doesn't look back
(') got a doctor's appointment
What
Hesher hops over the fence
(
) () It burns when  urinate
Hesher disappears over the fence
We hear his van start and peel away
The flaming diving board pours black toxic smoke into the sky as it crumbles into the pool
Did he just leave us
think we should get out of here
Nicole stands and heads for the gate,  tags behind
They jump the side fence and head out into the street, dripping wet
- & Nicole walk over the crest of a small hill on a tree-lined street eating ice-cream cones
They walk in the middle of the road, still damp
The sun is setting
The light is magical
My shoes are so squishy
steps hard, squirting water out the sides of his wet shoes
Nicole smiles
So, what's his name
Hesher
() 66
: Hesher
Is that a name
don't know
guess
Does he have a last name
don't know
How old is he
don't know
Do you know anything about him
Not really
Beat
That was so lucky you guys were behind me when that guy got all mad about his car
was freaking out
don't really have any insurance right now just can't afford it
There's no way could afford to fix that guy's car
How do people do this stuff
mean, have a job
It's kind of a joke though
've been there for like a year and 'm still only doing like five hours a week
Why aren't they giving me any more hours
Do you think it's because they think  suck
Did you think  sucked when  served you at the checkout
() No
don't even get paid enough to really cover my rent
'm gonna have to start selling shit pretty soon
() 67
: (2) licks his ice cream, then reaches into his pocket
Here,  got two bucks
The sad thing is  could actually use it
- parking ticket sits under the wiper on Nicole's windshield and Nicole approach the car, smiling - and then Nicole sees the ticket
Her face sinks immediately
Oh, no
Please tell me that's not a ticket
She runs the last few steps to the car and rips the ticket from under the wiper
She reads it quick
(') Fuck, fuck, fuck it
She paces a couple of angry circles and then kicks the car's tire
It hurts her foot
She yelps
(') Ah, shit
Fuck it
In a small frenzy, she pulls her keys from her pocket and opens the car door
She gets in and slams the door behind her
She sits behind the wheel and yells, frustrated
stands in the street, uncomfortable, not knowing what to do
He goes to the car and gets in beside her
He sits, still not knowing what to say
She tries to settle herself, but she's still very emotional
(') What have  done to deserve this chain reaction of shit all the time
Sometimes  wonder if  were to die right now, if anyone would care, or even notice
would
She lets out a small disbelieving laugh
() 68
: That's nice of you to say, but  doubt it
would
If you died right now
() 'd notice
thinks a moment
It's a sweet and sour moment
He wants to cheer Nicole up, but he's remembering his Mom at the same time
(') Mainly because 'd be sitting in a car with a dead lady
Nicole sniffs, smiling through her tears
Please don't call me lady
She smiles warmly at
(') Let's get out of here
She puts the key in the ignition and turns it
Nothing
Nicole takes a breath - not wanting to get upset again
She turns to and smiles sadly
(') You wanna steer or push
- enters the house, he leaves his wet shoes and socks at the door
/  - He enters the kitchen
Hesher sits at the table, waiting for his dinner
Grandma is serving food onto plates
sits
Hesher is smiling
Hi
Hey Grandma
() 69
: So did you fuck her
What
No
Dad enters tying the drawstring on his track pants
He looks messy as ever
( ) Where were you today
What
Counselling - 3:30, 'm there by myself
Oh, sorry
forgot
Yeah, that's real nice
This thing is for you just as much as it is for me
waited outside school for 45 minutes
Yeah, well,  told you  don't want to go
Maybe you should let me know before you don't show up next time
did
told you  didn't want to go
told you a hundred times
No you didn't
Yes  did
You're just not listening
No you didn't
What you told me was that you didn't want to go
You didn't tell me that you were just not going to show up
() 70
: (2) What difference does it make
For me a big difference
It means, 'm sitting on a fucking beanbag in a room full of losers by myself
Grandma sets more food on the table
Boys please, 'm not feeling well
Grandma heads back to the kitchen to grab more food
There is silence at the table
( ) Can you pass me my pills
Hesher slides dad's pill bottle over
Hesher puts his finger into the mashed potatoes and wiggles it around
(discreetly, to ) Did you finger her twat
Shut the fuck up
( ) What
Hesher licks the potatoes off his finger
Language
don't wanna hear it
Did you hear what he just said
don't care
If  hear it again, you're going to your room
() 71
: (3) My room
You gonna start punishing me now
Maybe  need to
If it's not the language, then it's your lack of responsibility
or 'm having to escort you down to the police station
Shit, dad
'm really sorry you had your ass dragged off the couch
'm sorry you had to put some fucking underpants on for the first time in months
What
sits and fumes, nostrils flaring
That's enough
Oh, what, soon as 'm right, that's enough
don't want to hear one more word from you
Fine
Fuck this
sweeps his plate off the table
It goes crashing onto the kitchen floor, food everywhere
Grandma walks back into the room, looking worried
Hesher seems riveted, like he's watching the tennis
And then Dad sweeps his plate off the table
Crash, food, mess
He glares back at
That make you feel better
wrenches his chair back and storms off
() 72
: (4) Dad sits a moment
With  gone, his reproach turns to shame
Grandma and Hesher make eye contact with each other
Dad gets up and leaves the kitchen
Hesher shovels some more food into his mouth
Grandma looks concerned
Did  miss something
( ) Not really
Paul came in and said some dumb shit which  got angry about and so  smashed his plate and then Paul smashed his plate too but  got a feeling he smashed his one cuz he couldn't actually think of anything to say cuz he kinda knew  had a point and so now he feels bad about it and so he's gone somewhere
(takes another mouthful) don't know where
Grandma contemplates this
Those boys have been through a lot
This makes Grandma very sad
(') Sometimes  wonder if they're ever gonna smile again Tears well in Grandma's eyes
Grandma is quietly crying
(') just wish there was something more could do
long beat passes
Hesher doesn't know what to say
He pours applesauce on his food
Grandma looks around the kitchen at the mess
She shakes her head, takes a deep breath and starts cleaning up
She picks up bits of broken plate and takes them to the sink
Hesher watches her
This is delicious
() 73
: (5) Thank you, dear
Hesher holds up a piece of bacon covered in applesauce and licks off the sauce
What's green and slimy and smells like bacon
don't know, dear
What's green and slimy and smells like bacon
worm
don't know
'm going to lie down
'm not feeling well
'm very nauseated
Oh,
Grandma exits
Hesher finishes the last few bites of his dinner
He notices Dad's pill bottle
He reaches for them
He unscrews the lid and empties a few into his hand
He swallows the pills
/ '   - Grandma lies in bed on top of her covers
Hesher enters the doorway and knocks lightly
Did you figure it out yet
Figure what out, dear
What's green and slimy and smells like bacon
No, not yet dear
Can you do me a favor
Sure, what
() 74
: Will you please hand me that red tin on the cabinet dear
Hesher enters the room, grabs the tin from on top of the cabinet and hands it to Grandma on the bed
Kermit the frog's finger
What
Think about it
Miss Piggy
Grandma opens her red tin and takes out what looks like a rolled cigarette
(') Woah, what's that
Oh, 'm feeling very nauseated
They're medical cigarettes that help me with the nausea
Will you light a match for me, dear
() Hang on a second
Can  see that
Hesher sniffs the "cigarette"
(') No shit
Hesher sets the "cigarette" down
(') 'll be right back
Hesher dashes out of Grandma's room
After a few moments, he comes back and sits on the edge of the bed
He is holding a glass
The bong has so much resin caked onto the sides, it looks as though a thousand pounds of marijuana have been smoked through it
(') May
() 75
: (2) Hesher takes one of Grandma's medical joints and breaks it in half and loads the bowl of the pipe
What is that
It's a bong
The water filters the smoke
It's probably the most healthy way to smoke weed
Hesher lights up and takes a  hit from the bong
He explains his technique to Grandma while holding the smoke in
(') , so basically cover the hole here with your thumb then suck on the top and once the chamber fills with smoke, take your finger off the hole and suck in
Hesher takes a quick sip of air sucking the smoke deeper into his lungs
(') Then try and hold the smoke in for as long as possible,  bro
Umm,
Grandma takes the bong and has a hit
It's a bit clunky, but she manages to make it work
Ok, lift your finger
Hesher helps her
The smoke shoots into her lungs
Grandma begins to cough
Oh, wow
That was a big one
Yeah, that was good
Hit it again
Grandma has another hit
It goes well
She blows out the smoke
Hesher takes the bong off her and has another  one for himself
He passes the bong back
() 76
: (3) think 'm , dear
Hesher takes the last hit
He dusts off the bowl and sets the water pipe down
They sit for a moment and let the drug sink in
(') Honey, how old are you
Who wants to know
don't know
You seem a little older than
Who
Oh, stop it
Aren't you a little old to be hanging around  all the time
Aren't you
No, 'm his grandmother
Yeah,  guess you have a point
, well  used to have a mouse
No, wait
hang on a minute
used to have a snake
And do you know what snakes eat
Actually, there's no limit to the food items that you can even think of that a snake might eat
Whatever is available in abundance would become the prey for the snakes
Depending on their growth, their diet - Hesher cuts her off
Yeah, ,  well, actually they eat mice
() 77
: (4) They do eat mice
lot of times snakes eat other snakes because they're the right shape - Yeah, , well anyway
used to have a snake and  fed it mice
But one time  fed this little fuckin' mouse to my snake and that mouse was tough
dropped that mouse in the snake's tank and the snake wouldn't go near him, and any time he tried that mouse would just smack him with his little, you know
Hesher looks at his hand, not knowing what mouse hands are called
(') With his little mouse hand
So instead of eating the mouse the snake just curled up crying in the corner and the mouse ruled that fuckin' cage
And this went on for weeks, the snake wouldn't go near him
That tiny mouse used to sit in a little miniature lawn chair scratching his balls and shelling peanuts and this snake was just too scared to go near it
And cuz the snake was scared of that mouse had to feed him other mice, but every time  dropped another mouse in the tank, it'd hide behind the brave mouse
And so eventually the snake starved to death
had a cage full of mice
Grandma is stoned and sleepy and fading out
So is  the mouse
Maybe he is
Well then, what am
You're an old lady
() 78
: (5) No, 'm a grandmother
Yes you are
And you know what grandmother
'm gonna go on a walk with you in the morning
Oh, that's nice
Where are you going
'm not going anywhere
'm going with you
Around the block,  guess
Oh, , well have a nice time
'll see you when you get back
No, 'm going with you
Ohh, , caauuse iii
Grandma has fallen asleep, but mumbles like she is continuing the conversation
Hesher smiles to himself, turns off her lamp and exits the room
/  - Hesher enters
He stands over what's left of the mess on the kitchen floor
He lights up a cigarette off the stove's flame and takes a long, slow drag, as he crouches down and starts picking up pieces of broken plate from the pile
/   - Dad is asleep on the couch
single shaft of bright sunlight lands on his face, causing him to stir
nimbly reaches down to the table, covered with dirty dishes and pill bottles, and quietly picks up his dad's wallet
He removes an  card and places the wallet back where it was
He exits
/  - Close on an  card, sliding into the slot
Fingers type numbers
small stack of twenty dollar bills pours out
() 79
: puts the money in a dirty envelope, pockets it and rides off on his bike
- walks through the showroom to Larry's office
Larry is on the phone
stands and waits
Larry watches him
The kid isn't going anywhere
Yeah, why don't you just have him send them over
Sure
Scott, can you hold on a minute
( ) What do you want
Can  talk to you
'm on the phone here
Can you see that

'm on the phone
Wait outside
'll be with you in a minute
takes a seat outside the office
Larry closes the door
Dustin Howard appears
The fuck are you doing here
came to talk to him
What about
It's none of your business
What do you wanna talk to him about
ignores him
Dustin taps 's leg with his foot
(') What do you want to talk about
() 80
: Just leave me alone
Larry's door opens
Larry emerges from his office
stands
What
got the money
What money
The money for the car
What money for the car
You said if  got eighteen hundred dollars  could have the car back
Are you kidding me
() said, 'even if you had eighteen hundred dollars,  still couldn't sell it to you
' Even if you had five million dollars,  couldn't sell it to you
It's not even here any more anyway, so that's it
flinches
He wasn't expecting this
What
What do you mean- Kid
Leave me alone
feel like 've had this conversation with you too many times already, but  can tell you we won't be having it again because the car's gone
What are you talking about
It's all over
It's gone
It's not here
() 81
: (2) Where's it gone
Kid
It's over
Good bye
Larry steps back into his office and shuts the door
( ) Where's it gone
Dustin smiles
And what makes you think 'm gonna tell you
stares, angry
An awkward moment passes
He storms away, dragging a water cooler down as he leaves
It crashes onto the ground
Water spills everywhere
- angrily winds his way toward the back of the lot
He stops at the spot where his mom's car once was - now just an empty space
/  - Hesher is pouring himself a bowl of Captain Crunch Berries
He pours milk onto the cereal
He does a half-hearted side-to-side stretch, getting ready for his walk
He looks out the window - gray clouds suggest rain
He takes the bowl with him out of the kitchen
/  - Hesher walks the hall, eating his bowl of Crunch Berries
He stops at Grandma's door and looks in
He stops eating and stands strangely still for a moment
/ '  - Inside, we see Grandma's feet sticking out from behind the bed where she lies face down on the ground
Hesher enters the room, cautiously
He stands at the end of the bed
He sets his cereal bowl down, bends and shakes her
No response
Grandma
() 82
: He shakes her again, this time a little harder
Nothing
He stands up, looking at her still body
As he realizes she is not waking up, his breath becomes fast, fighting hard not to get emotional
- Gray clouds fill the sky
We hear distant thunder
On his bike, coasts down the hill of a tree-lined street
He's upset and trying hard to hold it back
/   - drops his bike and enters the house
/   - Dad sits on the couch, his head in his hands
He looks up
Teej
Hesher enters the room
He punches a hold in the wall
He paces angrily back & forth
Dad, holding back tears, gets up off the coach and hugs
What's going on
Teej
Grandma, she's not
she's not waking up
What
She won't wake up
Short fast heavy breathing sets in
What do you mean
runs over to Grandma's room and stops at the door
(') Oh, Jesus
() 83
: He disappears into the room for a second then emerges again in tears, his hands on his face
He heads back to the living room
(') What happened
don't know, she just, she just didn't wake up
is in shock
He sits on the couch next to dad
They are both lost for words
Hesher stands in the corner with his head shoved between the walls
Hesher joins  and Dad on the couch
They are all raging inside, confused, lost and upset
They sit together in silence for a long beat, in the same boat for the first time
Hesher breaks the silence
He kicks the table over as he stands
gotta get the fuck out of here before  hurt someone
He leaves through the front door, leaving it open behind him
gets up in a daze and stands at the doorway looking out
It has started to drizzle
/ '  - stands in the doorway working up the nerve to enter
He enters and leans down to Grandma and tries to lift her onto the bed
She is heavy for him, he struggles
He gets her on top of the bed and looks at her for a moment
breaks into tears
He leans down onto the bed holding Grandma, crying into her chest
/ '  - sits on his bed and looks inside the envelope of cash
He closes it and seals it shut
On the front he writes: '' ' / '  - Close on a small piece of paper with a hand written number
The numbers are dialed on a phone
waits while the phone rings
Answering machine

Um,
Bye
He hangs up the phone and exits
- walks out the front door
Dad is quietly sitting on the front steps wearing a -shirt in the light rain
goes to his bike
What are you doing
( ) don't know
Getting some fresh air, guess
It's starting to rain
Dad reaches out his hand and catches a few drops
Yeah
picks up his bike and rides
We stay with Dad as disappears down the wet street

He rounds a corner onto Nicole's street
He jumps off his bike outside her building and wheels it inside the front fence

'  - climbs the stairs of Nicole's building
As he approaches her apartment door, he hears loud, but muffled music
He knocks on the door
No answer
The music is really loud
He knocks again
No answer
He tries the door handle
It gives
He pushes the door open tentatively
'  - enters the apartment
The music is blasting
He looks around the living area
Clothes are strewn around
He sees Hesher's combat boots, -shirt, jeans
looks seriously troubled
We can faintly hear heavy breathing/moaning coming from the bedroom
walks over to a door
It's an inch ajar
He pushes it open gently
We don't see what he sees, but  stands deathly still, eyes wide, white as a ghost
We hear Nicole giggle
Then - (
) Oh shit
storms away, heading for the front door
He pulls a lamp smashing to the ground on his way out
'  - charges down the stairs
He grabs his bike and heads out into the street
Light rain falls
We see Hesher appear behind him, barefoot and topless, buttoning his jeans
notices Hesher's van parked out the front, he drops his bike and grabs a rusty pipe from a pile of garbage on the sidewalk and heads straight toward the van
Hey, hey
wait
takes a hard swing into the van, smashing the tail light
Nicole runs out into the street, concerned, wearing an oversized sweatshirt and underpants
(') Hey
The fuck are you doing
() 86
: ignores him and takes another swing at the van
Hesher approaches
takes a swing at him with the pipe
Hesher steps back
Nicole gasps, her hand to her mouth
She doesn't know what to say or do
Fuck you
Fuck you fuck you fuck you
Stop hitting my van
Fuck you
( ) And you're a fucking whore
hope you die
And when you do, no one's gonna fuckin' notice

Dude, chill out for a second
swings the pipe at Hesher again
Get the fuck away from me
'll smash you in the face,  swear to God
Back the fuck up
swings again
He's so angry, he's practically foaming at the mouth
(') never want to see you or your ugly fucking face again
That goes for both of you fucking assholes
throws the pipe at Hesher
It hits the road with a loud clang
grabs his bike and rides away furiously
Hesher and Nicole watch  ride away
It begins to rain hard

funeral home truck is parked out the front -    is written on the side
drops his bike and enters the house
/  - Dad sits at the dining room table with a   - a tall, lanky man
He talks in a drawn, soft monotone
Dad doesn't appear to be at all in the mood for this conversation
After the service we have complimentary lemonade in our wake room, but should you wish to upgrade to soda and sandwiches we can arrange that
People typically like to have a light bite after the service
The front door slams
storms past the dining room table
The funeral director pauses and watches him pass
The sound of 's bedroom door slamming shakes the house

gentle knock reveals Dad at his door
Are you

Will you just leave me alone
Dad doesn't know what to say beyond this
He feels as lost as does

sweeps Hesher's belongings off the work bench in the garage
He kicks Hesher's sleeping bag and pillow
weathered bass guitar leans against a little amplifier
kicks the guitar, snapping it in two
Out of breath, he stands in the mess he has created
Something catches his eye
He contemplates this for a beat

storms out, just as Hesher is making his way up the path, his van parked on the street behind him
Hesher reaches out his arm to slow
wanna talk to you
pushes Hesher's arm out of the way
Get your fucking hands away from me told you,  never want to see you again
Hesher, at a loss, watches  grab a brick from the muddy garden and throw it through the passenger side window of his van
Hesher charges
He throws him into the muddy garden and kneels over him holding him by the collar of his hooded sweatshirt
fuckin' told you, leave my van out of this
Hesher lifts  up and slams him back down on the ground, knocking the wind out of him
struggles to get away
Let go of me
Fuckin' let go of me
Dad runs out the front door and pulls Hesher off  by the back of his shirt
What in God's name - Hesher shakes free from Dad's grip and punches him square in the nose
Dad goes down hard
Don't fuckin' touch m- () 89
: Without hesitation,  jumps on Hesher's back, bear hugging his face
They struggle for a beat, until Hesher manages to throw off
He lands on the wet grass like a ragdoll
(') Fuck you both
Motherfuckers
Hesher stands breathing hard, dripping wet from the rain, fists clenched
He turns back to his van, gets in, slams the door and peels away
picks himself up out of the mud, grabs his bike and rides off in the opposite direction
Dad stands holding his bloody nose
He watches Hesher, he watches
He is left confused and bleeding in the pouring rain
'  - It's raining cats and dogs
stands outside Dustin's house, soaking wet with his hoodie pulled over his head, the garden shears in his hand
He walks around the side of the house and looks in the window
'  - From 's  outside, we see Dustin in the kitchen preparing a sandwich, one eye on the
He takes the sandwich to the couch in front of the  and lies down
'  - walks around the back of the house
He tries the handle to the back door
It's locked
sees the dog door
He climbs through the flap, trying to be as quiet as possible
The  is loud inside
'  - treads softly through the kitchen, soaking wet, shears poised
He walks through to the living area
He steps behind the couch out of Dustin's line of sight
Dustin's bare feet hang off the end of the couch
ducks down
He opens the shears and carefully brings them down over Dustin's big toe
He squeezes them shut
Dustin squeals
() 90
: Where's my car
What are you doing
Where's my fucking car
Are you crazy
You make me ask one more time, your toe's coming off
swear to God
It's gone to the wrecker's
What
The wrecking yard
Bullshit
squeezes a little harder
Dustin squeals a little louder
Why would  be lying
Because you're a fucking asshole
Tell me where it is
It's gone to the wrecker's
swear to God
squeezes harder
Dustin squeals
(') 'm not lying
It went to the wrecking yard on Sunrise near Red Bridge, yesterday afternoon
It's there now
thinks, holding Dustin's toe in his grip
() 91
: (2) (') swear to God, man
It's at the wrecking yard on Sunrise
If you're lying, 'm gonna cut off every one of your fingers
doesn't quite know what to do now
He stares at Dustin who looks genuinely frightened
releases the shears and backs away
And the second he does so, Dustin leaps off the couch, grabs  by the throat and slams him down on the living room floor
drops the shears
You finished
Want to tell me something else while you're visiting
Dustin wails into
cowers on the ground
Punches land - comes  through the front window into the living room, raining glass everywhere
Dustin stops punching, stunned, and looks up to see Hesher, dripping wet, step through the big nasty hole he has just made
Hello
What the fuck
Dustin moves to stand
Hesher pounces on him, dragging him along the ground
He grabs the shears and brings them straight up to Dustin's nose
In the same movement, he snaps the shears shut and takes the end of Dustin's nose off
Dustin squeals in pain and scurries backwards, clutching his face, blood leaking between his fingers
stands, stunned
What the fuck is wrong with you
What
Oh my god, my nose
What the fuck is wrong with you
() 92
: (3) just saved you
You cut his nose off
Only a bit, it's just a cut
Dustin is crying now, clutching his face
goes to the kitchen
You just cut his nose off
What are you talking about
runs a rag under the tap and takes it to Dustin
Hesher stands, clutching the shears, confused
Hold this against your face
Dustin moans
Hesher is still confused
(') You gotta stop the bleeding
Oh my god
What's your problem
Dustin holds the rag
stands to face Hesher
want you outta my life
'm serious
never want to see you again
How many times do  have say it
They look at each other a moment
Hesher looks taken aback
He honestly believed he was doing a good thing
leaves, through the front door
Hesher stands over a whimpering Dustin wondering what went wrong
93
- rides his bike over a rickety red bridge
He pulls his bike up outside the tall wire fence of a big dirty wrecking yard - & Auto-Wreckers
It's still raining very hard
is soaking wet
He sits on his bike, looking at mountains of wrecked cars inside
hops off his bike and shoves it behind a dumpster
He gets up on the dumpster and climbs the wrecking yard's fence
&   - roams the stacks, looking for his mother's car
He looks distraught
All around sit stacks of wrecked cars
vicious dog on a chain barks and snarls nearby
stops
He sees his mom's car atop a tall stack of wrecks
He looks at it a moment, contemplating what to do
He moves to the base of the stack and begins to climb
He clambers slowly up the pile in the rain
It's awkward and difficult and more than a little dangerous
Finally he reaches the top
He wrenches open the car door and squeezes behind the wheel
- sits, catching his breath
The rain clatters on the roof of the car
is up high enough to see the lights of the surrounding neighborhood
He sits and contemplates the last few days and months of his life
He closes his eyes
- doorbell rings
runs to the door wearing the bottom half a suit
It's the pizza man
Hi
(yells into house) Pizza's here,  need money
Dad, clean shaven, dressed in a suit, comes to the door and pays
() 94
: (') (yells into the house) , pizza's here
'  (
) ( ) Alright, let's do it
The woman comes down the stairs with her hair nicely done, wearing a fancy pink dress, it's 's
Teej, c'mon sweetheart
We have to go
We're going to be late
What about the pizza
We'll eat it in the car
She begins to do up 's tie
(') ( ) Honey, will you grab the present
Dad picks up a large box off the side table, it's clearly heavy
Holy crap, what is this thing
The three emerge from the house
is wearing a suit and carrying the pizza box, Dad's carrying the heavy present, and Mom's carrying a bouquet of flowers and her purse
Dad stands at the door of a little white car
Clearly the box is too big
(') Ah, slight problem
Mom open the back of her red volvo which is parked right next to the white car
We'll take my car
Dad does a heel spins around the white car and heads towards Mom's red volvo, never losing a beat
Sure thing
95
- Dad's driving, eating a slice of pizza
is in the backseat, looking out the window, also eating pizza
Mom does her make-up in the visor mirror
think we should keep the new one and give them our old one
That's a great idea
'll be sure to let them know that our dirty old microwave is a gift from you
Good
'm not even sure they know who am
Honey, they're my friends
Please
,  just don't understand why they get so many presents
microwave and a bottle of scotch is hardly a lot of presents
And flowers
Mom half-laughs and shakes her head
(mouth full of pizza) Mom can you turn on the radio
Sure honey
How about some oldies
Oldies but goodies
Mom turns on the oldies station
Dion And The Belmont's, " Teenager In Love" plays
Dad sings along
The car hits a bump
Mom smudges her lipstick
() 96
: ( ) Honey
She turns to Dad and we can see her lipstick has gone up onto her cheek
She smiles at Dad
They all smile at this, then - From out of nowhere, the car is - on the passenger's side
The impact is massive
The  is deafening
Smashed glass
The car spins into the oncoming traffic and is hit by a delivery truck
The car flips
More deafening noise
/ &   - wakes in the wrecked car at the wrecking yard
The loud sound of crunching metal continues
is startled and disoriented
He realizes the car is moving
- crane is lifting the car with a huge wrecking yard magnet
As it rises off the stack, it dangles at a precarious angle
- is thrown through the car to be wedged up against the windshield
He panics
He yells
He squirms his way to the window and waves his arm wildly outside, yelling, trying to get the attention of the guys below
The car shifts violently and slides out through the window
&   - is hanging dangerously out of the car, swinging his legs and screaming at the top of his lungs
His voice can barely be heard over the sound of machinery
guy on the ground, , looks up and spots
He frantically looks to get the crane operator's attention
Ricky
( ) Ricky
Kill it, man
Ricky sticks his head out of the crane cab, like he can't hear
What
Kill it
There's someone in the car
() 97
: Mario points
Ricky looks up
Both men can see  dangling
&   - As the car is lowered  jumps the last few feet to the ground
Mario leads him away from the car and the crane
What the hell are you doing
don't know
What were you doing in there
don't know
'm sorry
This car's about to get crushed
If didn't see you, you would be dead
know
What were you thinking, man
doesn't respond, he backs away
Mario watches him walk away, still disbelieving
He turns back to Ricky and gives him the all clear to start her up again
walks to the entrance gate while behind him his mom's car is hoisted high in the air
stops at a dirty vending machine by the gate
He pulls coins from his pocket and slots them in
It spits out a chocolate bar
Moments later  stands with his half-eaten chocolate bar while watching his Mom's car get fed into a giant crushing machine and compacted into scrap
Tears well in his eyes
He feels helpless
- walks in the front door
Dad jumps up from the couch
He has a bandage on his nose and a black eye
He looks distraught, like he's been up all night
Where have you been
() 98
: Sorry
Where have you been
'm sorry
lost track of time
You lost track of time
It's ten in the morning
'm sorry
've been up all night
How is that fair to me
don't know
Dad looks at him, breathing hard
Tears well in his eyes
Dad starts crying, he's falling to bits
Just go to your room
Dad knows he's being pathetic
walks off down the hall
/ '  - stands in front of a mirror trying to correctly tie his neck tie
He makes a sad attempt and leaves it - it looks wrong
There's a knock at 's bedroom door, but the door doesn't open
(
) There's someone at the front door for you
- Nicole stands at the door
is unimpressed with seeing her
He stands in the doorway looking silly with his tie
Hesher's not here
came to see you
() 99
: Why
What do you want
wanted to tell you something
stares at her
(') didn't know if  should come here or not, but  couldn't stop thinking about it
thought maybe if  came you'd still just be really angry at me and hate me, but then  thought if didn't you'd think  didn't care and you'd hate me anyway, so  figured might as well come, just in case, so here  am
Yeah, well what do you want
want to apologize
feel bad about what happened
didn't take your feelings into consideration - Yeah, well, whatever
It doesn't really matter
have to go
Yes it does
It does to me
like you,
We're friends
looks at her, he doesn't really want to be mad at her
(') understand if you don't want to be my friend
didn't mean to hurt your feelings
Sometimes  just
don't know
just wanted to come around and say all that, but maybe you still hate me and so it doesn't matter, but just came round to say that, but 've said it now, so  should just go
So, , bye
Nicole walks off
She gets half way across the lawn before - 'm sorry  broke your lamp
() 100
: (2) Nicole turns
It's
And 'm sorry  called you a fat prostitute
It's
You're not fat
Nicole smiles at this
But 'm a prostitute
dunno
Maybe
They smile at one another
She crosses the lawn back toward
She fixes his tie
She smiles again and then she leaves
'  /    - Dad and  sit in the front seat
They are still angry and not speaking to each other
It is an unpleasant and uncomfortable ride
They both wear a suit and tie
- Dad and  drive into the funeral home parking lot in Grandma's car
few people are milling around
- Dad and  enter the funeral home foyer
They look like they don't know where they're supposed to go
They are greeted by the funeral director from earlier
He talks in a soft monotone whisper
Excuse me, Mr
Forney, may  have a word
He takes Dad aside
() 101
: (') hate to have to do this here, but there's a couple of things  need to discuss with you quickly, if that's Ah, sure
know that we discussed your preferences for some aspects of today's service, including your choice of the cedar casket which the insurance company had covered
Unfortunately we were out of those and instead we've chosen a mahogany casket
Now there is an extra charge for the mahogany which  need to clear with you before we proceed
Is that Dad looks confused
He doesn't know how he's supposed to respond
Ah,  guess
, great, thank you
If you could just sign here
The director hands Dad a fancy pen and holds out a dense order form for him to sign
(') Just at the bottom there
Dad's pen hovers
He doesn't know where he's signing
(') Just here, Mr
Forney, just under that
yes, that's great
Dad signs and hands the pen back
(') Now, just one other thing - we have another service following yours today, we hate to do this, but we're going to have to try to get through yours as quickly as possible
() 102
: (2) The funeral director's cell phone vibrates loudly on his belt
He ignores it
Dad can't
(') don't want you to feel rushed, but we are really under the pump today and just thought  should give you the heads up
Now,  notice, just looking at your order of service
(beat, thinking) Ah, look, let's play it by ear
We should be fine
Dad looks at the funeral director, not quite sure he's hearing him right
The funeral director's phone continues to vibrate
(') Excuse me
The funeral director walks away and answers his phone
- The funeral director stands at the front of the room
He hits play on the in-house stereo - generic classical musak
and Dad take seats next to each other, but they might as well be a hundred miles apart
About ten other people sit
The funeral director hits stop
He stands and approaches the microphone
We are gathered here today to mourn the loss and commemorate the life of Madeleine Frances Forney
(to arriving late comers) Ah, if you could please take your seats as quickly as possible that'd be great
Thank you
(he waits a beat) Madeleine was a beloved wife, mother, grandmother and friend
And now Mrs Agnes Rosowski, a dear friend and neighbor, will say a few quick words
hobbles her way to the microphone
did not know Madeleine long enough, but from the moment  moved into the neighborhood so many years ago, she treated me as though  was part of the family
() () 103
: (') Madeleine always had open arms and welcomed friends as kindly as her own
She had such a kind wonderful heart
While Agnes speaks,  and Dad notice the funeral director, off to the side, whispering business to two of his employees
He makes every attempt to be subtle and discreet about it, but he is clearly struggling with today's workload
(') We shared so many wonderful walks and enjoyed each other's company very much
will miss our walks
will miss our talks and most of all,  will miss Madeleine
will always remember what she told me, life is like walking in the rain, you can either hide and take shelter or you can just get wet
She was dear to me and she will always have a place in my heart
Agnes places her hand on Grandma's coffin and stands for a long silent beat
(') love you, Madeleine
Another drawn out moment of silence
The funeral director takes this opportunity to step to the microphone
, thank you, Agnes
Agnes steps towards her seat
When she sees  she stops
,  think you should say something
The funeral director pauses awkward
Everyone looks at
(') Go on,
gets up reluctantly
He doesn't know what to say
He stands at the microphone and struggles for a long beat, but nothing comes out
Sorry
makes his way off the stage
() 104
: (2) Sound of slow clapping from the back
It's Hesher
His hair looks extra greasy, he's wearing a dirty white Budweiser -shirt and he's holding a tall can of beer under his arm which spills as he claps
He is  drunk
The funeral director tries to wrap it up
, so at this point we should conclude today's service with a moment's silence, after which lemonade will be served in the
Actually, 'd like to add to 's speech
think  know where he was going with that
Hesher stands and makes his way to the front
The funeral director tries politely to protest
'm sorry, sir
Dad stands up in the aisle and tries to stop Hesher
What are you doing here
Up on the stage, funeral home employees begin wheeling Grandma's coffin away
Hey, hey, hey
Hesher pushes past Dad and stops the coffin
(') What are you doing
Get your fuckin' hands off that box
The funeral director walks up to Hesher
'm sorry, sir we really need to- Hesher turns and stands at the microphone
Um
() 105
: (3) The funeral director looks over to Dad, not sure what to do
He lightly puts his hand on Hesher's arm to guide him off stage
'm sorry, sir- Hesher pushes the funeral director's arm away hard
You touch me again, 'll rip your fucking head off and skull fuck you
The funeral director backs off, scared and unsure of what to do
(') Ah,
Listen
know you guys don't want me here and  don't want to fucking be here, but 'm not here for me, 'm fuckin' here for her- Hesher gestures to Grandma's coffin
(') - and 'm not fuckin' here to say goodbye or have my farewell or whatever the fuck you assholes call it - this is not how  want to say goodbye to someone  like - in this shit-hole with these- Hesher points to the funeral director
(') - fuckin' assholes
's dad stands and interrupts
, this is enough- Yeah, well why don't you shut up for a second and listen cause 'm going to say what  want to say and then you'll never see me again
Alright
There is a beat of silence
No one knows what to say or do
() 106
: (4) (') 'm here cause she's been trying to tell you guys something, but you don't want to listen
so 'm gonna fuckin' break it down
Hesher takes a long pull from his beer can
(') pulled the gas tank from an old Chevy and  wanted to fuckin' blow it up, so  did
didn't think about the millions of bits of metal that were gonna fly in every direction
almost killed myself
woke up in a hospital
couldn't remember what happened and then this doctor at the end of my bed said 'son', and  said, 'don't call me son you fuckin' cunt', then he said, 'you blew off your nut'
Some shrapnel had penetrated my left scrotal sack and ripped the furry sucker right off
My left fucking nut was gone, just like that
Hesher makes a magic disappearing arm gesture, spilling a bit of beer on the floor
(') went crazy
assaulted a nurse, a doctor or two,  can't remember
got arrested
got sent to juvie
But all could think about day and night was my missing fuckin' nut
couldn't eat or sleep,  just wanted my fucking nut back
had to get out of there and find it, so  busted out of juvie and went lookin' for it
looked for days, but didn't find shit
The tiny crowd listens, half offended, half intrigued
(') And then one night  was taking a shit and  was just staring down at my balls, looking at my flabby piece of sack where my left nut used to be and then  noticed my right nut, for like the first time
My right nut was just sitting there, totally happy, just hanging out
() () 107
: (5) (') All this time 'd been driving myself crazy thinking about my missing nut and not thinking about the nut  still had all along
And  realized, 've still got a nut
've still got one good nut
God or the Devil or whoever left me with one good nut
At least didn't lose both my nuts
've still got one good nut and it works, and my dick works too
Hesher looks up at  and Dad, sad and imploring, he's made his point
They look back at him stunned
(') You lost your mom
You lost your wife
lost a nut
Hesher takes the last swig of his Budweiser
He sways, drunk
This soaks in with the crowd
(') Fuck this
Hesher throws the can down
He goes to stomp on it
He misses and stumbles, crashing into the microphone podium, knocking it over and falling in a heap with it
He starts puking on the stage
couple of old ladies are horrified
The funeral director motions to his assistants that now is the time to move the coffin out
Hesitantly, they obey
Hesher looks over from the floor
(') Leave her alone
We're not finished yet
() Unfortunately sir, we need to be
They continue to push the coffin away
Hesher lifts himself up and wipes the vomit from his face and steps toward the coffin
The funeral workers back away
told Grandma  was going on a walk with her and 'm gonna do it
Determined, Hesher leans down and unlocks the wheels of the coffin stand
Dad stands, not exactly sure what to do
() 108
: (6) With purpose Hesher pushes the coffin down the stage ramp and down the center aisle of the room, toward the exit
He turns to - (') You promised Grandma you'd go on a walk with her
This is your last chance
Hesher seems overcome with emotion, he continues pushing the coffin toward the exit and out through the doors
and Dad watch him, unsure
After a moment, They follow him to the door
They stand at the doors watching Hesher push the coffin out into the parking lot
is overcome with emotion, his eyes well with tears
He heads across the lot and catches up with Hesher, joining him on the walk
Dad watches for a beat, his eyes well up too, then he does the same
All three are now walking together through the funeral home parking lot with Grandma's coffin
They don't speak
It's a release
Other mourners watch from the doorway
- Hesher wheels Grandma's coffin across the parking lot with and Dad beside him
They seem solemn and strangely dignified in a dishevelled way
Hesher leads them out of the parking lot and into the street
Traffic passes around them
Some cars come to a complete stop
Hesher gets the coffin up onto the sidewalk on the other side of the street and the three continue their silent walk with Grandma
In slow motion the three walk
Dad puts his arm around 's shoulders,  puts his arm around Dad's
And then a cop car cruises beside them slow
The cops inside watch them
Dad looks over
One of the cops smiles
- The cop car pulls up outside the house
The back door opens and Hesher falls out onto the sidewalk, still very drunk
Dad climbs out and steps over Hesher helping him to his feet
cop speaks to them from the open window
() 109
: () You'll get him to bed now, won't you
That's the plan
Hesher squirms and slurs
Get your hands off me, pig
That's the plan
The cop gives them a casual wave as their car pulls away
and Dad help Hesher across the lawn to the front door
We hold on the house for a beat
/  - Close on scissors to beard
Dad stands over the sink cutting away at his beard
Golden sunlight pours in through the windows
moment later he lathers his face up with shaving cream
/ '  - There's a gentle knock at the door
wakes and makes a big stretch
His hair's a mess
Come in
Dad enters, he's clean-shaven now
He looks like a new man
Morning, Teej
Hey
Look at you
know
It feels weird
can feel air on my face
hardly recognize you
() 110
: think Hesher's gone
Gone where
don't know
But  think you should come take a look at this
/  - The garage door is open
The garage is flooded with daylight and no sign of Hesher
and Dad walks across the garage to the open door
At the garage's entrance they stop
Their eyes register something seriously unusual outside
'Master of Puppets' by Metallica punches in
giant red cube of Volvo scrap metal has been placed in the center of the driveway like a huge piece of abstract art
They stand and stare at it, almost in awe
Then from the across the street, we see the object in the driveway and  and Dad on the porch looking at it
We also see the words '
' spray painted on the front of the house in big letters, as yet unseen by  and Dad
Dad puts his arm around 's shoulders
On the beat we  : : Hesher ripping on the guitar; Hesher blowing something up; Hesher cupping a fart and putting it in 's face; Hesher pantsing Dad; Hesher metal saluting Grandma and Grandma saluting him back
Hesher behind the wheel of his van, smoking a cigarette and making a direct line for the setting sun
mouse sits an in a tiny armchair like a human, shelling a peanut
He throws the shell over his shoulder watching the setting sun
