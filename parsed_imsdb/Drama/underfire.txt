" " Screenplay by Clayton Frohman and Ron Shelton Story by Clayton Frohman - soldier carrying an automatic weapon rises up out of the grass and looks around
mortar shell explodes nearby
There are no sound effects
He seems unperturbed
Several more explosions in the field
The soldier motions with his arm and: More small explosions
With a click-click of a camera -- still no fx
As they do, the platoon leader waves his arms again
Through a field of small mortar explosions
With the click-click of a camera
Each carries an enormous load of supplies, and each is ridden by a soldier with a rifle
firing rockets at the soldiers and elephants
tribal mask is painted on the nose of the chopper
The soldiers on the elephants stand up and aim rifles at the chopper and begin firing
against an African sunset

' ' ' - door slams o
s
and the figure of  , 30, appears at the top of some stairs
Sleepy-eyed, he pulls on a multi- pocketed fishing vest over a baggy shirt
He carries a beat up canvas bag over his shoulder
, 40, sleeps at the lobby switchboard desk
Another    sweeps the floor
Price mumbles a 'good morning' and goes to two vintage   vending machines -- one for candy, one for Coca-Cola
He buys two candy bars and a coke, and begins eating his "breakfast" as he crosses the lobby
- , a cab driver, has been sleeping in a chair against the wall
Several street vendors have their wares laid out on the sidewalk against the hotel
Some are shaded by makeshift awnings, some are not
Jimmy rises as Price arrives; there is familiar ritual in their greeting
They cross the street together toward Jimmy's waiting taxi, a hand-painted purple old American car with the words on the door, "New People's Taxi Company" and Jimmy's name in script above it
Price hands a candy bar to Jimmy
'Morning, Jimmy, think you could squeeze me in
Where is you would care to go at once, Mr
Price
Bang-bang
Twenty dollar
Price hands him a wad of bills
You're a thief, Jimmy
Jimmy smiles broadly, nodding, then points to the sky
Booteeful picture, huh, snap-snap
don't do skies
The two men get into the strange cab parked in front of an open marketplace just starting to come alive; the cab drives off
- The taxi arrives, and Price gets out
Price ambles over to stand in the early morning shade against an old building
hand-painted image of Che Guevarra -- with an  painted over it -- is on one wall
Price pulls a joint from his pocket and lights up, taking a hit
The sounds of war machinery soon interrupt the stillness
Price hurries to the corner
Price pulls a handful of colored rags from his pocket and picks out a yellow kerchief, tying it to his arm
Price then steps boldly into the street in front of the approaching convoy
He exchanges shouts with an officer in a jeep, and with a motion is given permission to join
Each truck is filled with perhaps 25 African soldiers in khaki, each holding an automatic rifle
Another jeep follows, towing a World War  cannon
: - (cheerily) Hi, guys
The soldiers look over disinterestedly
Two dozen cases of Coca-Cola are tied to a stretcher among stacks of guns
As Price settles in for the ride, he begins pulling cameras from his bag
Quickly and automatically, rarely looking, he switches lenses, loads film, and prepares his cameras
He has done this a thousand times
-- , rises from among the blacks, and shakily makes his way toward Price
mercenary dressed in a ragged uniform of his own design, carries two machine guns and a
45
He smiles broadly, recognizing Price slaps Price's hands as if they were teammates
'damn, Price, you tuna sucking piece of raw meat -- whatchyou goin' to Zambeze for
Thought 'd get some great shots of your head gettin' blown to smithereens
Smithereens
Be a great fuckin' picture, eh
Be a prize winner
(proudly) Ya think so
(beat; changing tone) Trade ya some greenies for a joint
(beat) gotta have a joint
'm on the wagon, man, sorry
(shrugs) Ahh
Dope-wise, this place sucks
(looks around, leans in confidentially) Lotta fuckin' coons around here, eh
They nod
He laughs obscenely and deeply
thought you were fighting for the Government
am
This is the Government
These are the Rebels
Fuck they are
This is a Government convoy to Calunda
This is the Abou-Deian Revolutionary Front
Pause
You're shitting me
Pause
Finally Oates starts laughing uncontrollably
These guys be pissed if they knew, eh
(Price nods in agreement; Oates suddenly gets serious) This is the dumbest motherfucker ever signed up for
Don't pay shit either
(Price nods in agreement) Nicaragua
That's the spot
Cheap shrimp, lotta rays -- real thin in the spook department too, dig
: '  - The convoy rumbles past a check-point into a small airfield containing a motley collection of -3's and old planes and    watch
Well hell
wonder where the fuckin' Guvmint is
As he speaks, the cab of the truck is rocked with a mortar shell and explodes
Soldiers scramble to safety
Some grab the guns being transported
and start running for safety
Smoke and explosions are everywhere -- they abandon their cargo and run for cover
quickly and instinctively, looking around wildly to "read" the situation
Price dives next to him
, staggering towards Price and Oates
-3 who darts out quickly and drags the injured Rebel to safety
and is firing away
- and start moving toward it through the smoke
They want to rescue the soft drinks
dangerously, waving and shouting as he does
Hold it
Hold it
They don't speak English but stop at his craziness
, and as he does he motions for the soldiers to continue
-- ,
As the soldiers move toward the Coke, Price snaps picture after picture
-     The two soldiers stop short -- several more steps and they would have been killed
Price's intrusion has accidentally saved them
The two soldiers run toward safety, bewildered and scared
- Gradually the airfield comes back to life
Several teams of medics run with stretchers from the hut and begin gathering bodies
Rebel soldiers appear from every conceivable shelter and move across the field
Oates emerges and meets Price on the torn up runway amidst the rubble
They look around at the devastation
Well,  guess we know where the Guvmint is
(cynically) You can walk to work from here
Convenient, ain't it
Oates starts to walk away, then stops and speaks earnestly, as if trying to connect to a real world that doesn't exist
My brother just got married
don't know your brother
Suddenly, the distant roar of a jet
All the soldiers on the field scan the horizon; Price looks up
The air raid siren goes off
and, instead of rockets and bombs, it drops something else: The jet pulls out and disappears
All is quiet again as the million papers flutter in the sky above the airfield
Out of frustration a single soldier fires a couple of shots at the paper
Price grabs a piece of paper out of the air
It is: and turns it over
There is writing on the backside in Spanish and Russian
He looks around
with a handful of the leaflets
What's this
Great shit, eh
Price tries to read the writing on the back as Oates looks at a leaflet familiarly
Gummint offers this house to any Cuban pilot flying Migs for the Rebels who chooses to defect to America with a Russian jet
We know they ain't gonna run off with no planes -- but the Rebs don't -- They're scared
They start thinking about that swimming pool
Damn near smell that chlorine
Starts workin' on 'em, and pretty soon they don't let the Cubies near a Mig
Use their own spook pilots and destroy their own air force in a week
Guaran-fuckin- teed
(proudly) Smartest guys in the world
(afterthought) Hey, you gotta scoop here, eh
You'll be famous
shakes hands with Price who looks at the picture
(dispassionately) Maybe
(looking around) gotta run
have a good one
Oates heads off across the runway as papers continue blowing down out of the sky; Price looks up and speaks to himself
love Africa
: '  - , 40, reads a report over the telephone as she times the call with a stopwatch
photograph of Claire's high-school-aged daughter sits on her dresser
, 50, struggles with his tie and a drink at a dresser in the adjoining room
Their connected rooms are littered with hand washed laundry and the paraphernalia of their trade -- typewriters, tape decks, books, notes, pictures
Their love affairs of three years is ending
(on the phone) "
and so this strange war that features two provincial governments, three rival liberation fronts, and at least twenty-five tribal associations, grinds into its seventh year
" Alex picks up a Melodica, a novelty wind instrument, and tries to court her with "Caravan" as she files her story
Though mildly put off, she maintains her cool throughout the call
He thinks he's Paul Desmond
"
The Battle for the Airfield at Abou Deia is just another chapter in this endless story
From Ndjamena, Chad, this is Claire Stryder
" (beat) No -- you didn't hear any music -- must be the connection
Okay
So long
She hangs up and rises more irritated than angered
Alex, don't play that God damn thing when 'm filing
(beat) We're late
Quickly expressed, her anger passes
It's my party -- we'll be late
You called it a "strange war" and an "endless story
" If you filed that story for me, 'd say you were editorialishing
like to editorialize
You drunk
Alex loves to be melo-dramatic and is quite conscious of his ability to charm
He's also aware that it's worn off with her
Drunk
Only with the memories of making love with you on the plains of Fianga as the first Army of Liberation marched in and opened fire
And freed the Proletariat
Alex raises a drink
Right
'm going to the party without you
She leaves -- he quickly puts on his coat and follows her
: - Christ,  don't want to go to this stupid party
'm bad at false modesty
You're great at it
She straightens his half-tied tie in an act of familiar affection rather than motherliness
Nervousness
She speaks calmly -- this is ground they have already covered
Alex, you're going to make a great anchorman in New York and undoubtedly could be a Pulitzer Prize winning hostess -- but 'm not going with you
You can work out of the East Coast
We'll get a place on Long Island and burn our suitcases
still like suitcases
Every Saturday night we'll have a party
invite all our friends, sit out on the veranda and interview each other
've done all that
haven't
(beat; changes tack) Well, God dammit, 'm getting tired of memorizing who's the president of the
Republic of Maldives
Mamoon Abdul Gayoom
Yeah, he succeeded Mamoon Abdul Gayeem
They both smile slightly as the elevator comes to a stop
The door doesn't open, and the light flickers
And 'm tired of Third World elevators
He bangs the door with his fist
It opens, and they enter a dismal hallway
The sounds of a party come from beyond
Don't leave me
already have
As they approach the door to the party, he speaks with new toughness
Fuck Abou Deia and New York
'm going to Nicaragua with you
No
've heard it's a neat little war with a nice hotel
: - cheer goes up for Alex as he and Claire enter
Party hats, booze, hand-made signs reading "Bon Voyage," etc
Fifteen journalists of varying nationalities cover this backwater war
Though both upset, they act as if everything is normal
summoning Alex who moves through the group with ease, instantly at home
Price holds up a bottle of champagne in toast
Alex, get up here
Alex climbs on a chair next to Price who puts his arm around him
To the man who gave me my first job, and fired me from my first job
and gave me my second job
And fired you from your second job
Just a few words, Alex
Impossible
Can't be done
etc
However miserable, Alex shines in these situations
He raises his hand -- silence
You may be asking yourself what exactly are you doing here in this "strange war, just another chapter in an endless story
that grinds into its seventh year
" Claire slips to the side bar and pours herself a drink, watching Alex and shaking her head with some affection
,   ,     covered with candles
The crowd parts for the cake shaped like the country of Chad
The crowd begins singing "Caravan" in a half-drunken tribute to a man they like and respect
of the party; it is all casual, silly, fun
'      , whip pan to , whip pan to
--  , pan follows her as she moves through the room --  , she picks up another drink and leaves through a side door -- , enjoying his own tribute once he has managed to give in to it
: - Claire's face is also covered with tears as she smokes, wandering idly among clothespinned photos
part of her life is ending -- life with Alex -- but it's not ending neatly
catches her eye
She stops and looks closely -- then laughs in spite of herself at a series of pictures: ; ;     ; --     ;  - ; from the clip and looks at it
, Oh
didn't know you were here
Sure you did
You were taking pictures of me all over the room
Well
yeah
you looked great
Why aren't you partying
In a minute
He notices the picture she's looking at
printed that up for Alex
It wouldn't be the greatest thing you could give him right now
(beat) We just split up
Jesus, 'm sorry
Who left who this time
'm the villain
thought it could be a little cleaner this time -- me in Central America, him in New York
That's pretty clean
But he's decided to go to Nicaragua too
To cover you or the war
To cover everything
Silence
Price moves behind her and gently kisses her on the ear
She smiles quickly and nervously
No
He kisses her on the neck
For godsakes, Russell, listen
The sounds of the party can be heard
He ignores them and moves around her, trying to kiss her on the lips
She puts her hand over his mouth
Price reacts strongly, flaring slightly and withdrawing
don't want to wait for you again
We've been circling each other since the Montreal Olympics
You're a genius of bad timing
(beat) 'm going back to the party
She heads to the door; Price stays
She stops before getting there, hesitates, then pulls the     from the string and returns to Price, handing him the photo
This is a great shot
Thanks
've heard the light in Nicaragua's even better
He doesn't respond
They stand for several moments -- the sounds of the party get louder
She turns and heads to Alex's celebration, leaving Price alone in the darkroom
, stares aimlessly for several moments, then focuses back on his : 1979 -   - :        , gradually   to reveal other magazines, candy, cigars, Nicaraguan toys, all in a corner shop, and finally: through the streets -- a group of middle class Nicaraguan women carry a banner that reads "Our Revolution is in Christ" (in Spanish), followed by three Catholic  in bright robes, followed by a sound truck with
system, followed by hundreds of townspeople carrying banana leaves and religious signs
All are singing a Catholic hymn in a swaying, hypnotic rhythm
Small red and black flags are scattered throughout
runs into the parade and stops
Price sits in the front seat -- his luggage is tied precariously to the roof
The trunk of the cab has been smashed in beyond repair
Price hops out of the cab with his camera bag -- he doesn't know what the parade is about but it looks great
He hands the cabbie some money to stay nearby
Wait here
He runs to join the procession
and almost simultaneously his light meter is out
is surrounded by images:        , , , , changing cameras, occasionally taking a quick light reading; his actions are instinctive and automatic
Suddenly: They wear red and black handkerchiefs, baseball caps, and strange masks
They are chanting: Rafael, Rafael, Rafael
libre o muerte
Rafael
is carried aloft on a stick, draped with red and black scarves
the boys and the painting
Up and down the street they spring into action, running for position with their guns
An ice cream vendor is knocked down, a mother clutches her "angel" daughter, another child is whisked inside a door as the Soldiers break into the procession
""      but realize that the soldiers have cut off their escape
into the parade and are separated from the boys only by a group of Priests
Trapped, the boys panic, but as the  push towards them: and intentionally scuffle with them, allowing the boys just enough time to dart into a house
One of the boys drops the picture of Rafael as he heads in the door
, the route to the door is blocked off, and the boys escape
and shoot it full of holes with their automatic weapons
"" as his image is ripped to shreds with bullets
The singing and the parade march on
: -  - Overlooking Managua is a sub-tropical paradise that seems far removed from a brutal civil war, this one time tourist watering hole serves as home base to the international press
The cab pulls up, and Price gets out
The driver unties his luggage from the roof as     recognize Price and greet him as an old friend
: -  () , 35, at a table as    mingle
man we will come to know as , 40, dressed New York casual, table hops in the b
g
and sneaks over to drop the Time magazine over his shoulder onto the table in front of him
Without looking up, Alex knows Price has arrived
He smiles
Welcome to Managua
They shake hands warmly, and Price sits down
Price points to the cover as a beer is served
You have something to do with this
Well
thought of calling your photographs "Pictures from a Lost War"
'm great at captions -- the New York editors loved it since none of them knew where the hell Chad was anyway -- it legitimized their ignorance, got you a cover, me a feature, and packaged a class struggle in two words
Nifty, eh
Nifty
Russell acknowledges   sitting with Alex
'm Russell Price
'm sorry
this is Isela Cruz
She works for the hotel and helps out as a translator
My pleasure
-  She carries her handbag and some papers -- she stops short seeing Price sitting with Alex
She hesitates, starts toward them, stops, and sits down at the bar at the opposite end of the pool
Price sees her, and she sees Price
They pretend they don't
Price turns to Isela and launches into a stream of broken, chauvinistic Spanish with his usual elegance
(in Spanish) Looks like you guys have a lot of bang-bang down here, eh
Little misunderstanding between the poets and the government
"Misunderstanding
" "Down here" it's called a war
It started in nineteen thirty
Before you were born
My Spanish is a little out of shape -- what'd he say
He said he considers it an honor to be able to photograph our war
Price looks at each of them and decides not to push
Russell's got a way with words
can tell
You're a helluva translator
know
'm much in demand around here
Will you excuse me
If you have any questions, just ask
Alex stands to help Isela from her chair
Price presses on, instinctively and effortlessly
Who is Rafael
It depends who you ask
Alex turns to Isela, who stops as she rises
Rafael
Comandante Rafael
He is either a Marxist dupe of Russia and Cuba
(beat) or the most popular leader of a most popular democratic revolution
(to Price cynically) Take your pick
don't really give a damn
but the guy's got a great face
beat, then Price asks his question almost sexually, as if he thinks he could seduce Isela, Rafael, the whole war
How would he like to be photographed
You'd never find him
Wanta lay odds
You would lose
(beat) You must excuse me
She starts to leave again, and again he stops her
Just one more thing -- is Rafael owned by the
or the
'll figure out the rest
Isela seems to welcome the question
Her tone is less flip, and she focuses hard on Price
Mr
Price
the world is not divided into East and West anymore
It is divided into North and South
By the time you people figure that out -- it will be too late
(beat) Congratulations on your cover
She touches his Time magazine, kisses Alex on the cheek, and floats magically through the pool area
Price frames her with his fingers as if composing a shot
'  Isela kisses another journalist, grabs someone's hand, and lands gracefully at another table
So far this war's got it all over Africa
You're gonna have a ball
' "" blocking out his view of the sexy Isela
Though Alex's tone is gentle, the threat is obvious
Hands off
need an interpreter more than you do right now
Price takes the hint
You still hanging in there with Claire
Alex chooses his words carefully and speaks slowly
'm hanging in there like an interim post-war government waiting for the palace to be overrun
by younger men
Silence and an uneasiness that Alex intended
Price manages a smile
Younger men
Alex smiles disarmingly
, picks up her papers, and heads straight for the two men with a bounce in her step
and she hands a stack of mail to Alex
Hi, Alex
Russell
When did you get in
Just now
She shakes Price's hand in a friendly manner that comes out awkwardly, then races past the moment to address and entertain both men
You're not going to believe this -- just beat you guys and everybody else here to a story
(she teases them) exclusive
eat your heart out
What'd ya get
've just been promised a private interview with Tacho
(impressed) Congratulations
The bastard won't talk to me
Who's Tacho
They turn to Price as if everyone knows who Tacho is
That's President Somoza's nickname
don't know who the players are yet
Want me to order you a hot dog and a program
bit of tension and awkwardness -- Claire quickly takes control and changes the tone
Fellas
No fighting after six at night, all right
Curfew
(beat) 'mon, we've all got something to celebrate
: - Corrugated metal roofs, thatched hut booths, a strange combination of decorative and architectural devices , a large black woman from Nicaragua, sings " Left My Heart in San Francisco" with a mediocre jazz group
is present, and other journalists drop by the table to say hello
, 13, aims an ancient bellows type polaroid at a booth in which Claire sits between Alex and Price
They are holding a pose indefinitely while the boy struggles with the camera
They hold up the   and a couple of beers in celebration, and when he finally snaps the picture -- no flash
The boy puts the camera down disappointedly
(in broken English) Sometimes it doesn't work
The three journalists relax their pose
Let me look
Daisy has just finished "San Francisco" and spots Alex, motioning to him
Ladeez and Gen'mun, hep me get Aaleex ov' here
Daisy applauds lightly for Alex to join them
Alex is equally pleased and embarrassed
There's not many piano bars left where 'm still welcome
Go ahead
If she can't sing in the key of 'm in trouble
Alex excuses himself and joins Daisy on the bandstand
Price and Claire are left alone in the booth as Price hands the repaired camera back to the boy
begins a slow, easy cocktail version of "Stardust," the song of his generation perhaps, and he seems happy, seduced by his own chords
, and this time the camera Price pays for the picture from the boy
At first there is a moment of awkwardness between them
Well
"Well"
you finished your assignment in Chad
Got Africa all wrapped up and pouched to my editor
She smiles and relaxes a bit at the typical Price remark
You're going to love this war, Russell
there's good guys, bad guys, cheap shrimp
(an afterthought) And Alex is still singing in the background
(beat) missed you
We gotta get alone somewhere to talk
as he plays
He sings like a trumpet player -- no voice but great phrasing
He half smiles as he sings, enjoying the song and enjoying making them uncomfortable
Sometimes  wonder why  spend these lonely nights, Dreaming of a song
Jesus
he's doing it on purpose
Alex is one of the world's leading experts on military strategy
They don't really want to talk about Alex though his presence is unavoidable
Price changes gears, gets slightly goofy, and steers the conversation to more comfortable turf
Well, hell,  just got off the boat
gimme the scoop on Nicaragua
Well
about sixty years ago the Marines invaded to protect American business interests and put down a peasant revolt led by a little man who wore a giant cowboy hat -- his name was Augusto Sandino
In nineteen thirty-four he was murdered at a peace conference, and the Somoza family has ruled ever since
No, no, no
don't mean the stuff about the peasants --  mean the real stuff
She knows what he means, but she wants to tease him a bit first
The "real" stuff
you mean a history of class struggle in agrarian societies
No, c'mon
Oh
Okay
well
(beat) Just a couple things
(beat) One -- there's only two kinds of beer available -- Tona and Victoria
Victoria's better
(beat) And two -- if you see Miss Panama hanging around the hotel bar -- hot, hot, hot -- but don't touch
She belongs to Tacho, and if anybody gets caught with her then El Presidente has promised to personally cut off the guy's
(unsure which word to use) Pecker
Yeah
and throw it into Lake Managua
Jesus
And the lake's already polluted
Price is impressed, and yet another new face drops by the booth -- they both recognize and see him coming, a contemporary of Price,  , a scraggly British journalist who heads over to their table holding three beers
(mutters to Claire) Is there anybody here we don't know
No
Regis slides into their booth, happy to see them
'damn, Price
kudos on the African snaps
(shakes hands, a perfunctory kiss on her cheek) Jeez, Claire,  haven't seen you since
Three Mile Island
Yeah
shit
(wistfully) Holiday Inn, right
He nods; they all sip beers and watch Alex sing
: teenage  looks around nervously, then pulls a paper sack from off the shelf, removing a strange mask from it
He pulls the mask over his head
Then from the bag he removes a hand-made zip gun, puts a bullet in it, and darts into the shadows of a nook, waiting
where Regis softly croons a few bars of "Stardust" into Claire's mike
The three of them are having a good time, mildly drunk at best, and uninhibited
: As we hear Alex's gentle rendition of the standard, a moves back into the shadows of the club
Each pulls on a mask, as in the b
g
: The man, somehow out of place, dresses with casual continental style, not overdone but expensive and tasteful -- clearly from another world
He wears a neat hat and moves gracefully
Isela looks stunning, dressed for the evening
The greets them familiarly
Isela casually checks her watch as they enter the club
The masked couple in the shadows check their watches
: As Isela and the man enter, commanding attention without trying
Isela stops at the piano long enough to kiss Alex gently before sitting in the booth with the man
'  the new arrivals have caught their attention -- Price and Alex still clown slightly, and Claire teases them
Jesus
Louis Jordan walks in, and 'm sitting with the Everly Brothers
Before you fall in love -- that's Marcel Jazy
friend of wine, women, and Somoza
They say he's a businessman
(interrupting) He's a businessman in search of a business
he doesn't try very hard to cover up his connections to the ' But look at his moves -- can the light cigarettes like that
What's wrong with the Everly Brothers
'  and sets down three shrimp cocktails and more champagne, as: It opens quickly, and three more    enter quickly
as the waiter speaks with a firm coolness
Please stay at your table, and you won't be hurt
' The dishwasher waves a gun
--   -- The woman carries an automatic rifle and guards the entrance
Almost materialize from thin air, moving silently and without commotion
The music winds down slowly
(Six Guerrillas total) With a few deftly drawn strokes, the    magically appears
The name "" is written under the face, then other names and revolutionary slogans
As this takes place: The middle-aged, well-dressed local sits with his wife and two other men
They freeze in fear, the nightclub freezes, as the  take control of the room swiftly and smoothly
at the table and speaks loudly but without panic
The masked Guerrillas around the room are serious but nervous
(in Spanish) We do not want to waste any ammunition on a head as empty as yours -- but we will
(in Spanish) What is this
(in Spanish) Shut up
Get up
The  refuses
The   takes a hand grenade from his pocket and pulls the pin without hesitation, then holds the grenade in front of him fearlessly, inches away from the Businessman's face
The Businessman rises slowly
The  motions toward the back door of the club
(in Spanish) You are coming with us -- you will not be hurt -- we will trade you for the release of some Nicaraguans who care about Nicaragua
The woman with the gun shoves it into the man's head forcing him to move toward the kitchen door
that fits into the palm of his hand
Neatly, surreptitiously, and calmly -- Price is coolest in any crisis
instinctively, and a tiny red light comes on
He hesitates, afraid to leave the room
The Guerrilla shoves the grenade in his face; the woman sticks the gun into his neck even deeper
--   -- Alex trips over the drum set slightly -- a clanging clash of cymbals startles everyone, and as the drama freezes: , Innocently, the young boy struts out of the kitchen to see what's going on, and as he does the , and: For an instant, everything freezes, and: Daisy Williams, the singer, runs away screaming as the grenade comes to rest near a crowded section of the club
Guerrilla guarding the side door rushes for it, picks it up, and as he does: '   brutal explosion -- the ceiling caves in partially, the musical instruments explode, and: through various doors
The boy photographer lies bloodied
The Guerrilla who picked up the grenade is a barely recognizable corpse
The Businessman is soiled but unhurt
As a broken gas pipe feeds a sudden outburst of fire, the club's patrons panic -- screaming and shoving towards the door as the , and: '       followed quickly by a 35mm camera, quickly clicking off picture after picture of the club amid the flames and panic
The new light makes his job easier
near the body of the boy photographer
He sees the boy's camera lying nearby
Price puts away his light meter and feels the boy's pulse, then puts his ear to the boy's heart -- making sure he is not still alive
: - The chaos of a busy, cramped Telex room
switchboard -- several journalists trying to place phone calls
Press come and go -- coffee, cigarettes, and half-eaten sandwiches
while Price stands to the side of the action eating a sandwich and watching
Established as the senior figure (or one of them) to whom other, younger journalists come for information
, a Time stringer, is slightly distraught on the phone, and interrupts Alex's dealing with others, cupping the phone, to announce: it's Charlie, from New York -- says that a terrorist bombing of a Central American restaurant isn't big enough to hold for the world section
Tell him we have pictures
He knows
Tell him there were pieces of body in the piano, and somebody was singing, " Left My Heart in San Francisco
" (beat) What's he got better than that
He's got the Pope visiting Egypt
Alex grabs the phone in disgust and launches in
Forget the Pope, Charlie
Every week you got the Pope somewhere
This is a very big story down here because it's the first sign of fighting in Managua
(beat) Yeah, well get a map and look up Nicaragua -- ya drive to New Orleans and turn left
While Charlie argues on the other end of the phone, Alex initials papers and performs several jobs at once
Like hell 'm editorializing, the whole thing happened in a roomful of and press
What do you want
(beats) How do  know they were
They wore name tags, what do you think
We're backing a Fascist again -- know that ain't news, but see if you can find an angle
has been floating through the room and, upon hearing the word "fascist," takes offense and approaches Alex
Hey
There's fascists and then there's fascists, right
Be careful how you throw words like that around
Alex ignores Hub though he is slightly pestered by him, and continues on the phone as he initials papers brought to him
We don't have any pictures of Rafael because nobody knows where the son of a bitch is, and anybody crazy enough to go after him
Alex spots Price who is standing nearby, still eating a sandwich, still enjoying the high energy buzz of the room
Alex directs his next line so that Price cannot fail to get the message
Alex plays the moment coolly
is liable to get his nuts shot off
Hub nods seriously, in agreement
Price turns
Alex smiles
Price smiles
Alex hangs up, grumbling, then turns his attention to the persistent Hub Kittle
Yeah, well g'bye
(to Hub) Who the fuck are you
(extending a hand) Hub Kittle
'm with Lewitsky and Knupp -- New York
We have a client down here
Alex is irritated but fascinated
Who
President Somoza
Alex is incredulous that Somoza employs a New York
firm
Hub is professionally used to this reaction -- no panic
know,  know
(beat) But there's an untold story here mean, the man has a point of view too, right
Alex turns to leave; Hub corners him
We got a national anthem contest going on right now, and you guys are ignoring it
Lotta human interest
Alex turns to other business though Hub persists
a young  , 18, is talking to Claire
She seems to be part of the local press
want you to get me copies of the Government inventory lists of all captured Guerrilla weapons
want to know if the guns are Israeli, Belgian, Russian, Cuban
The Guerrillas are not supplied by anybody from the outside
Fine -- give me proof
through the chaos
Su hija, su hija
Your daughter from Los Angeles
Claire sighs at the bad timing but seems delighted to be interrupted by her daughter, and brushes aside a Stringer forcing paperwork upon her
Claire takes the phone into a bare, adjacent hallway for some privacy
Claire talks to her daughter
Hi, baby
How are you
(beat) Has Grandmother spoiled you silly by now
She has
Good
(beats) Yes,  got your letter with the picture of your new boyfriend
He's very good looking
but he's a bit old, isn't he
No
Just how old is he
Price knows this is not his world, and he wanders outside
: - Price bounces along, whistling, "San Francisco
" An occasional Guardia jeep or taxi rumbles past
He strolls up the walkway of a house from which comes a strange, blue glow
- Blue walls, bare bulbs, several pictures on the wall, and an old woman lying in a hammock
Music in the b
g
Price approaches her and hands her a $100 bill -- there is a brief negotiation of the black market value
(in broken Spanish) Cuanto
Quince
Veinte
Diezysiete
She shrugs, declaring the negotiation ended, and leaves the room to change the dollar into cordobas
Price idly studies the pictures on the wall: , ,    , 715TH
mounted to a rifle held threateningly by a Guardia soldier
We haven't heard them enter over the sounds of music and our preoccupation with the pictures
What is this
'm a journalist
No answer
Price pulls a thick passport and press credentials from a pocket, handing them to the Officer in charge
Journalista, journalista
The officer looks at Price's passport photo, studies it briefly and takes the passport
He nods
rifle butt is jammed violently into Price's belly -- he doubles over
The Officer nods, and Price is led away
As the Guard hauls him outside, the   appears in the doorway with a stack of local currency
: - Price is led into a dark cell where another , 50, lies in street clothes on the floor
The Prisoner is spat upon by the Guards and kicked awake
Price cringes
Padre Puta, Padre Puta, Padre Puta
(in Spanish to Price) Here is a Priest for you to confess your sins
The Guards laugh and leave
The Prisoner rises to his feet
Price keeps his distance
The Prisoner looks in bad shape
Cigarillo
Price hands him a cigarette and lights it
long, deep drag
Priest
(the man nods) (in broken Spanish) What are you doing here
(in Spanish) The government accused me of using the church to hide Rebels and guns
(in Spanish) Governments are always wrong, eh
(in Spanish) This time they're right
Who are you
(in Spanish) Un periodista
(in Spanish) Whose side are you on
(in Spanish) don't take sides
take pictures
(in Spanish) No sides
(in Spanish) No
The Prisoner Priest looks at Price with disdain
Periodista Puta, todos periodistas son putas
(All journalists are whores) The Prisoner sits down in the corner ignoring Price who is surprised to be treated so despicably
(quietly) Go home
: Price is led into a lineup of 10 people, all Nicaraguans
The room is narrow and so brightly lit that at first he covers his eyes
Guardia soldier moves up and down the lineup, stopping to point at a prisoner
In the line we recognize the  from the Viking Club
Price speaks to the soldier in a calm, reasoned tone
Mi amigo -- mala interpretacion, eh
Periodista, comprende
Famoso
Time magazine
The soldier whirls at Price in a rage out of all proportion to Price's tone, shouting: (in Spanish) Shut up
Price holds up his hands -- he may be fearless, but he's not stupid
The soldier pulls a knife, then pulls his own tongue from his mouth, and makes motions with the knife as if cutting out his tongue
The message is clear -- Price doesn't speak
The soldier walks up to the Waiter and points
The Waiter is frightened
Through the shadows we see an officer talking with a civilian in a hat
The civilian points to a door
protesting desperately as he goes
The soldier moves to the next prisoner -- he too is led away
This repeats itself until the soldier arrives at price
'
The civilian is in a discussion with the officer -- it is clear that his opinion affects the decisions
For a moment Price doesn't know where he's going to be led
The civilian points to a different door -- it opens -- and Price steps down off the display rack into a room
as Price steps through, the action continues with the other Nicaraguan prisoners
Price looks around quickly, but the Civilian and Officer are gone
He is quickly shown into a bare office
Pictures on the wall of Somoza and the Price's cameras and bag sit on a desk
--     His rumpled elegance is at odds with the brutal surroundings
The door closes
, and Price addresses him at once
Soy un periodista
(in excellent English) Mr
Price
you must accept our deepest apologies for the misunderstanding
Somebody saw you taking photographs of terrorists hooligans in the parade and at the nightclub -- our young officers get carried away
they're always looking for traitors
That film is half way to New York by now
know,  know
It was all a misunderstanding
una mala interpretacion
Your cameras
The Officer reaches for one of Price's cameras and hands it to him, but as he does: --  The Officer would love for Price to get angry
'm sorry
Price smiles barely, and refuses to pop off
Forget it
Price puts his cameras in his bag, and as he is shown from the room he notices a copy of the sitting on the desk
This way
Price is shown to a door, handed over to a soldier, and led outside into the night
: - Claire stands at the main doorway surrounded by , an , and an unidentified  -- she is arguing with them in rapid Spanish, not allowing them to get in a word
(in Spanish) You throw a journalist in jail -- it gets in the papers
You walk all over the same press credentials you pass out
demand to speak to someone in authority or 'll go to Tacho myself
don't understand you -- you're big and strong and handsome but you're not so smart
(beat) You should be trying to seduce us
Senora
and sees her
Claire
They hurry toward each other and embrace briefly
The Guards watch it all curiously
You're okay
'm fine -- what're you doing here
These guys are goons
They love being beaten up by a woman (beat) 've been looking for you all night -- why'd they lock you up
They walk away together
don't know
Taking pictures
The usual
Jazy got me released
Jazy
You think there's a story there
Ahh
stories are all alike
wanta find Rafael
You need help
No
You
No
(beat) When should we start
figure you probably want to do a little research on the history of Marcel Jazy's business connections in the third world countries with influence
Oh
assumed you'd just look him in the eye and say "Gimme a break, for crissakes, Marcel, are you a spy or aren't you
" : - Marcel Jazy stands, drink in hand, looking slightly rumpled in the daylight, slightly older, but more charming and self- effacing than his first impression indicated
His two story Mediterranean style house is in slight disrepair; the gardens are scraggly and overgrown
The pool is empty
Jazy addresses Price and Claire
are you a spy or aren't you, eh
(smiling) Spy is such an odd word, Mr
Price
nobody is a
'spy'
anymore
Russell prefers pictures to words
You don't have to apologize
you're journalists
And you're a businessman
businessman
That sounds good
Okay, 'm a businessman
Why was  arrested, and why did you get me released, and who are you
As he speaks, the questioning comes to a sudden halt as a emerges from the shadows of the house into the light of the courtyard
She is tall, Latin, and besides high heels wears only a shiny, high fashion swimsuit, cut high on the legs
Price, Claire, and Jazy stop to watch as the woman stops to look into the empty pool
No agua
(nodding) No agua
(in Spanish) Oh, Marcel
You told me there would be water in the pool this week
Jazy leans in very coolly to Price and Claire as he pours an extra glass of wine and speaks softly in English again
If she dove in,  assure you she wouldn't notice
He carries the glass of wine to the woman, smiling warmly
(to Miss Panama in Spanish) Sweetheart, the Guerrillas knocked out the pumping station on the road to Masaya, and we must ration water for the time being
Next week maybe things will be better
(in Spanish) Maybe  should go back to Panama
(in Spanish) Maybe you should
Jazy pushes a lounge chair over to her and hands her a glass of wine
The woman unfolds gracefully into a lounge chair in the sun
Very sexy
She reaches for and kisses Jazy's hand affectionately -- he kisses her forehead
She feels better now
Jazy motions for Claire and Price to follow him inside
'  - The pool is visible in b
g
His house, like the pool, is rumpled and slightly sloppy though it betrays the taste of its occupant -- books everywhere, pictures on the wall, nothing cheap or tacky but everything is well worn
You were arrested because the Guardia are clowns who specialize in excess
You were released because  told them to release you
These are not the normal duties of a businessman
He looks at them directly
But they are the normal duties of a
spy, eh
You win, 'm a spy
(smiles) There, are you happy
feel better
He refills their glasses
Now we can relax
You can turn off your little thing
The red light of her recorder is on
She smiles slightly, undisturbed, and turns it off
Oh,  trust you won't say anything to hurt me
In some ways 'm a terrible spy
used to be much better at it, but now it seems everyone knows who  am
have too many girlfriends
like to be photographed
(beat) talk too much
Price and Claire are almost afraid to speak, afraid to interrupt this strange performance
always talk too much
but my girlfriends like that
No matter
(pointing to the swimsuited woman) You know who she is
No
That's Miss Panama
Do you know who that is
Oh, yeah, yes, etc
She's in love with me
've got to get some water in the pool
(beat) And once a week  have lunch with President Somoza to discuss security measures against the Sandinista insurgents, but all he wants to talk about is Miss Panama
he's worried about her
Claire interrupts with a smile
Because he thinks she's seeing another man
Jazy smiles slightly before confirming
and he assigned me to find out who the man is
They all smile at this complication
Price is impressed
Jazy changes the subject with fluent and disturbing ease
We all know the Revolutionaries are going to win, don't we
Silence
They don't know how to respond
They all are slightly entertained and glad for the relief
Unsure what to say next, Price notices a picture on the wall: -  - The same picture we saw on the leaflets in Africa
There's a rumor about this picture
Some people say you're a genius -- that you invented this scheme
It was lots of people's idea
Have you been to Leon
We're going to Masaya
they say the Rebels have hit the cuartel
It's supposed to be nasty there
a lotta people think Rafael's in the South
want to find out
No, no, it's not "nasty" yet
Another week maybe
(beat) You would love Leon
nice cathedral and beautiful light
et un peu de bang-bang
We're not doing a travelogue, you understand
Of course, of course
only  have heard that Comandante Rafael has recently had his unit in the area
(surprised) Rafael is near Leon
Well
it's a rumor, what do  know
The voice of Miss Panama
Estoy desemperado
She's lonely
Don't let us stand in the way
It's my job
(beat) You think  talk too much
He doesn't wait for an answer, but excuses himself and goes out to tend to Miss Panama
as Jazy touches her, whispers, and she waves to Claire and Price
: '   - Early morning
Price lathers up with shaving cream for the first time, cleaning up
As he applies the lather he stops, and slowly draws a face on the mirror with shaving cream until he is staring at: : - turns onto the road to Leon
Price drives, eats, and reads a map
Claire takes the map from him and reads it herself
They seem to enjoy their first moment alone without Alex looking over their shoulder small band-aid is on Price's clean shaven cheek
Did you dream about Miss Panama last night
dreamed about you
Have a good time
Yeah
so'd you
She reaches out and touches his band-aid
And old war injury flaring up
Is the tape on
Of course
was on the deck of the
Pueblo catching some rays when the North Koreans attacked
took a bullet right in the chest, but by luck had an extra roll of high speed ektachrome in this pocket right here
over the heart
And the bullet ricocheted off the film, grazed your cheek, and saved your life
You heard about it
was lucky
marking a series of graves
Immediately the tone in Claire's voice changes, sobered by the reminder of war
Did anyone ever die next to you in combat
Yeah
What did you do
8 at a sixtieth
That's an old joke
My question was serious
So was
(beat) You ever dream about me
Once
How was
Fast
Again their glibness is interrupted by what they came to see
Even as they joke, they watch the landscape with concern
, mostly women and children, some old men, carrying their possessions
Soldiers stand around
'm basically a coward, Russell, hope you understand that
hope we don't get shot
Me too
: The press car pulls up to a stop
Price and Claire get out quickly, hand their credentials to a soldier, and open the trunk and the hood
As the car is searched they look down at the city
from several places in the town
The sound of gunfire
(to soldier in Spanish) thought it was quiet here
(in Spanish) Quiet
Are you sure you want to go down there
Not me
The soldier laughs at the journalists and hands back the credentials
(in Spanish) You must leave the car here
Price speaks in English knowing he can't be understood
(to soldier) You thinking of scoring a Toyota
(in Spanish) No problem -- we leave the car
Price and Claire remove their things from the car, and Price takes the distributor cap as well as the keys
They walk over and look down the road leading into the city under seige
-- it is a most uninviting sight
The plane passes over the town in the distance firing rockets
Now what
Price responds by flashing his light meter in the air, taking a quick, nervous reading
'mon
Be careful
Be careful
Where the fuck we going
Better light
: - Looking around warily as they go, they are the only people entering the town
Claire speaks softly into her tape recorder as they walk in, recording the event without editorializing
June tenth
the evacuation of Leon
a woman carries a pig
signs for the
are everywhere
a body
lies ignored on the sidewalk
They continue walking and soon come to: Price and Claire duck into a doorway, protected in effect by the Government soldiers who wait silently, guns ready, around the corner of a building
We see what they're waiting for
a block away, holding a handgun
Momentarily confused, he begins running toward us, toward the soldiers waiting in ambush
The Guerrilla races quickly to his waiting death, and as he turns the corner right into a dozen Guardia troops: , killing him instantly
unable to watch
down the street toward the Rebel youth's house
Suddenly the intersection is empty
as: with sharpened sticks, a spear gun, and one home-made gun
The Muchachos hesitate briefly, lost, and see Price
motioning for Price to record them
They pose instantly in "tough-guy" posture
and just as quickly they dart away through a bombed out building
and race toward Claire and Price who freeze: Russell
For a moment they aren't sure what this means -- are they in trouble
The Sandinistas shove past the two journalists, pushing open a doorway and disappearing inside
For a moment Price and Claire are alone on the street
and a middle-aged  appears, motioning for them to come inside
'  - The Three Sandinistas, dressed half in khaki, half recycled disco, are pleading with a young man, , 15
#1 (in Spanish) You must come and help us
one more time
(in Spanish) No, please
One of the Sandinistas brings Pedro his rumpled baseball jersey from another room
#2 (in Spanish) For Leon
for Nicaragua
Pedro sees Price and Claire and is more interested in them
He speaks in broken but understandable English
Americans
Journalists
Yes
Pedro lights up, and runs to a shelf where he returns with a baseball he is signing
Ah
put my autograph on this ball
#1 (in Spanish) Pedro
There is no time to waste
Pedro is more interested in the two Americans
When you get back to the United States,  want you to give this ball to Tippy Martinez for me
He is from Nicaragua
Pedro hands Claire the baseball as the Sandinistas plead with Pedro for his help
He is more interested in getting the baseball delivered to Tippy Martinez
Claire accepts the ball graciously, exchanges awkward glances with Price, and puts it in her shoulder bag
#1 (in Spanish) Enrique is dead
Roberto has disappeared
The Guardia has the church, and we need you
(to Claire and Price) You come, eh
(to the Sandinistas) Can they come with us
#2 Come
Everybody come
They go to the door and open it a crack to look out
as Soldiers kick open doors across the street
The Sandinistas go to a corner of the room and push a book shelf out of the way
large hole has been broken in the wall
They climb through the hole into the living room of the next house; the woman pushes the shelf back over the hole with great effort
- family huddles in the corner as the     pulls back a couch and a hanging blanket, revealing another hole knocked in the wall
The Sandinistas, Pedro, Claire and Price scramble through
-     of all the houses on the block, connecting the homes with a secret passageway
The six of them race through the houses, each hole opening and then closing magically
- The Three Sandinistas, Pedro, Claire, and Price emerge , 50, runs the cafe and welcomes them
The  crawl so as not to be seen from the street; they stop long enough to survey the plaza
Half a dozen bodies are scattered across the plaza
Otherwise, it is empty
control the plaza
As we watch, they fire off occasional shots in different directions--there is no way to cross the plaza
" " from the oven, home-made grenades that look like muffins on a tray
Pedro grabs one and pretends to bite into it
The Sandinistas start to laugh and catch themselves as Pedro clowns
Claire and Price aren't sure what the "muffins" are and don't respond; mostly they are on edge
The contact bombs are put in a sack
The woman opens a trap door in the floor, and the six of them climb down a ladder into a tunnel
: - Pedro leads them with a candle through a dark passage under the street
Overhead we hear gunfire
Rats scurry, and water runs through an open sewer
: - tapestry rug is pulled away, and Pedro's head appears
He climbs out and soon all the party is in the church leads them quickly through an immense, nearly
European interior of ornate altars and burning candles
The small party is led to a small corner of the sanctuary where a long, rickety ladder leads up to the roof
as it sways
Pedro follows with his sack of contact bombs
Then Price goes up as the Priest holds the ladder
The American is much larger than the Nicaraguans -- the ladder squeaks and sways, and when he is nearly at the top: as Price reaches the top and is helped to safety
The Priest steadies the ladder now made unsafe and clearly Claire wants to go onto the roof
(in Spanish) No, please
it's not safe
You must come with me
Claire looks at Price -- she wants to go on the roof but the sound of close gunfire settles the dilemma
Claire hurries off to safety with the Priest
: - , , onto a lower level of the cathedral rooftop where a body lies
They are exposed immediately and automatic weapons fire opens up on them -- the Sandinistas flatten against a wall, quickly becoming separated from Price and Pedro
in a move that is equally daring and foolish
The diversion draws fire from the two soldiers
'        as Pedro huddles with him, curious at this strange act
as they hide behind the cupolas
The hidden Third Guerrilla opens fire killing a Guardia soldier, and the other soldier races for the belltower
As he does: , waving to Pedro who slips along a wall with his bag of bombs
and chooses to take refuge halfway in an alcove
As fire from both sides ricochets all over the rooftop, Price switches camera lenses seemingly oblivious to the action
in a protected niche and quickly they are unfolding his bag, setting the "muffin bombs" out on the rooftop
and briefly draw heavier fire from the belltower, as: weighing it briefly in his hand, like a pitcher
He studies the surroundings -- runners on first and third, no outs -- he spits in his left (his pitching hand) and rubs it in casually
Pedro crosses himself, goes into an abbreviated pitching motion, then rears and fires the 'muffin' toward the belltower window, exposing himself as he does
-- another explosion
and a Sandinista drops him with a shot
All is quiet
, looking in and motion to Pedro and Price that all is okay, and as they do: -- they whirl around -- Pedro and Price drop again
lone Guardia soldier fires at them from the other tower
Again all is quiet
and looks in
One of the Guerrillas kicks a couple of them to make sure they are dead
In the corner, one body lies on top of another
Satisfied, the Sandinistas head for the other tower
and the ever-present light meter appears, followed by several quick shots of the bodies
Then Price goes to one of the arched, stone windows
He looks out over the city
--  Late in the afternoon now, the fighting is over for the day
An occasional gunshot
Smoke rises from scattered places throughout the city
There is new rubble
The town is littered with bodies
man walks in front of it, chanting slowly, rhythmically: Hay heridas o muertes aqui
Hay heridas o muertes aqui
(Are there wounded or dead here
) We see a woman drag a body out into the street
The Red Cross man makes small stacks of bodies
He douses the bodies with gasoline and sets the pile aflame
Then continues
Hay heridas o muertes aqui
Price watches
He thinks he hears something, then dismisses it
Something else
voice, almost a whisper
Price
You motherfucker, Price, 'm talking to you
He turns
One of the bodies speaks
Where are those bastards
are they away
Price looks out -- the Sandinistas are on the other side of the roof
This war gets stranger
They're away
body rolls out from under another body
Blood-splattered, smiling, wiping the blood from his face
It is Oates, the mercenary from Africa
He peeks out the window -- the Sandinistas are on the other side of the roof
He whispers
What the fuck are you doing here
What the fuck are you doing here
For a moment they understand that they are there for the same reason -- they make their livings off war
Oates peeks out the window nervously and repeatedly
Awright, awright -- you're lookin' good
how ya like Nicaragua
readies his automatic weapon in case it's needed -- routine
Price doesn't know how to answer
It's beautiful
Oates laughs quickly and softly -- he is tuned into the strangeness of Price's answer
Shitload o' greasers though, eh
, and Oates crawls back under the pile of bodies
, all looks quiet, and they motion to Price
#1 (in Spanish) It's getting late -- come on
: - The Three Sandinistas, Pedro, and Price are hiding in the shadows of the main church entrance
The Sandinistas are carefully peeking around the corner, checking out the plaza
It seems safe
The door opens; the Priest lets Claire out
For a moment she looks around to see who's still alive -- in the shadows Price looks like one of the Guerrillas
They see each other and embrace briefly
You're okay
The Sandinistas seem to relax
The Sandinistas take pride in Pedro and pat his left arm for Price and Claire
#1 San-dee Koufax, no
#2 Si, Koufax
#3 Es mejor que Koufax, eh
They seem to want approval from the Americans
Much better than Koufax
The Sandinistas slap hands, familiar with the American gesture
The Six start walking across the plaza away from the church
In the b
g
we see piles of bodies burning; the Red Cross tends to the wounded locals
Spirits are high as they walk
The tiny red light glows on Claire's recorder
Koufax is okay
but Tippy Martinez, he is the best
he pitches for the Baltimore Orioles, and some day will be the second man from Nicaragua to play in the major leagues
#1 (to Price and Claire) Tippy Martinez had a good fastball, but Pedro has a curveball and a screwball that are better
All five of them agree that Pedro is the best; they slap his valued arm and relax for the first time all day
You will give my autographed baseball to Tippy and tell him in five years will be pitching with him, okay
He better watch out for me, eh
: - and looks down into the plaza
He doesn't smile or joke -- it's all business
He aims the rifle
: - #1 (in Spanish) It's too dangerous to return to Managua at night
You should stay at the house of hammocks
(in Spanish) Gracias
Can they get into trouble for keeping us
No, no
you are not combatants
(would rather talk baseball) The Baltimore team is my team
,  '   in front of us
Sudden panic, rage, confusion -- the Sandinistas whirl and scan the building
into the night
'    to face the church; his action is instinctive, angry, and electric with energy
'      to safety, though there is no safety and the body is lifeless
Her actions are protective and automatic
and move quickly
Two of them fan out to cover the escape
Price screams in the direction of Oates, You bastard
Claire drags the body near a bench under a tree
What about him
#1 (dispassionately) He's dead
The Sandinistas survey the cathedral and streets carefully, warily, upset at their nonchalance
They know the sniper is disappearing into the night, but they continue to look
#1 will talk to Pedro's mother
You must go to the house of the hammocks if you want to be safe
The Three Sandinistas fan out toward the church as it gets dark
, feeling helpless and ineffective
They both look at the body
Price realizes he's holding Pedro's gun and places it down next to the body
Price notices the tiny red light is still glowing on her tape recorder
He points it out to Claire
She turns it off
: - full of hanging hammocks, Claire sits on the floor lit by a low wattage bulb hanging from a cord
In another room through a door Price can be seen with a family in the hammock workshop
Claire talks softly into her recorder
Hello sweetheart, this is your mother
'm in Leon and  miss you
Don't worry about me -- it's not dangerous at all
guess you can't believe what you hear on the news
'll put this this tape in the mail when get back to Managua, but knowing what the mail service is like,  may be home before it arrives
think about you all the time and hope can make it back before you graduate from Jr
High
As she speaks Price bids the family farewell and comes into the room with Claire where he lies down in a hammock
love you and 'll finish this letter when  get back to the hotel
Claire lies down on a mat, exhausted, after turning out the light
Several moments pass before Price speaks
know who shot Pedro
knew somebody was in the tower
Why didn't you tell the guerrillas
don't know
then they would've killed him  guess
didn't want to interfere
It wasn't an easy choice
think  made the wrong one
Silence
You didn't take any pictures when it was over
didn't
(beat) picked up a gun
Jesus
(beat) Is something happening to us
Yes
Silence
They lie for a long time in the dark
light in the house is turned off
Finally: Are you asleep
No
Price gets out of the hammock and lies down next to her
They don't speak
They kiss
She unbuttons his shirt
He unbuttons her blouse
They undress just enough to begin making love softly, quietly
: '  - The first light of dawn strikes Claire's bare torso
'       Price takes a reading, then moves the meter to her neck, another reading
He moves it down her nude body lit beautifully in the vague light, partially covered with a blanket
He scurries across the room, stark naked, with a camera
Price begins photographing her
He moves back to her and gently removes the blanket from the rest of her body
His actions are quiet and easy
He stops frequently to admire her
Claire lies sleeping nude, except for her socks
Price moves around the room -- picture, picture, picture
and pulls the blanket back over her
She opens her eyes and sees Price sitting in a chair several feet away with his camera
'morning
What are you doing
You look beautiful
She realizes what he's been doing
How long have you been doing this
'Bout ten frames
Wait'll you see the pictures -- you look great
Her sense of violation is balanced by this notion
For a moment we sense her attitude can go either way -- outrage or some sense of being flattered, however ill conceived
She chooses the latter
'll bet  look great -- give me the film
After they're printed
'll develop them myself -- give it to me or 'll start taping what you say in your sleep
Price hands her the film and climbs back under the blanket with her
talk in my sleep
Girl's names and -stops
Terrible
They curl up together, holding onto each other
small child crosses the courtyard, peeking at them
rooster crows
Call the office
don't want to go to work today
The peacefulness is shaken by the roar of an engine close by
They look up, jolted out of the moment
The war is back
: - Price's rental car is a smoking wreck
He and Claire arrive and she removes a single, feeble white flag that remains
They study the car briefly and then turn as: past with a truckload of refugees behind
They wave the flag and catch a ride with the refugees
: - Alex comes out a door chatting with somebody, and passes a mini-cam crew, old friends
How was Matagalpa
-  #1 No bang-bang, Alex
none at all
You find anything
-  #2 Half the press corps
small laugh
They continue on
Alex enters Claire's room
' Alex enters
Nobody there
As he turns to leave he sees some pictures in a stack of papers on her desk
He picks one up
:        It's all over and he knows it
He stares at, even admires, the image
He puts it down and turns to leave as: Oh
Oh
(awkwardly) How was Leon
Bloody
Yeah
'll bet
Claire
Alex finally acknowledges that it is over with Claire, but refuses to say it directly
'm tired of Nicaragua
You haven't been here very long
Long enough, lets face it, you were right
everybody was right
About what
My cheekbones
What do you think of 'em
like your cheekbones
Alex, are you all right
This is a face made for television
You decided to go with the network
Alex nods, then seems to hit the end of his own resilience and gets vitriolic
Is he a good fuck
Alex
In a simple monologue Alex goes from outrage to acknowledgment of what he already knew
That's a reasonable question for a reporter to ask, isn't it
(beat) shoulda never come down here, eh
This is the way it's going to be
(beat) 'll make a shitload of money in television for just sitting there
(beat) 'm gonna show up to work at Rockefeller Center every morning and they're gonna hand me the news with my coffee and toast
(beat) shoulda never come down here, eh
This war down here belongs to you guys, okay
'm on tommorrow's plane
Alex
You want to take me to the airport
It's okay
(beat -- resigned) shoulda never come down here
: - cab pulls up
Soldiers stand around everywhere
Price, Claire, Alex, and the Cabbie get out
The cabbie takes his bag
Take this to check in
'll be right there
Price pulls a bottle of wine from his camera bag and sets three styrofoam cups on the cab roof
He hands the cork to Alex and shows him the label
Sniff this sucker, eh
Alex does, and looks at the label
Jesus, where'd you get this
The
Where else
They toast and drink
Hey -- 'll leave you guys alone, eh
No, no, don't be ridiculous
We're grownups, Russell
(non acerbically) Most of us
Awkward smile from Price
You two wanta happy snap
Price makes the motion of taking a picture
They look at him with affection, yet astounded again by his inappropriateness
No happy snaps
Okay, okay
(beat) 'll just
be over here
He wanders away from the car to give them a moment alone, and as he does he pulls the light meter from his pocket, flipping it on and off nervously without looking at it
He wanders idly toward a Guardia soldier
The soldier gets nervous
You're sure about him
For the moment
Alex considers this -- he understands (whether he wants to or not)
-- with , (to soldier) 'm a personal friend of Tacho's
(smiles disarmingly) The soldier stops at Tacho's name
Price turns
, embarrassed, faces the soldier
Don't look, huh
(beat) No mire
The soldier, confused, turns away, and as he does: , Don't get hurt
Ahh, 'm a chicken, don't worry
(beat) Alex, listen to me
Yeah
Within a year you're gonna be one of the "Ten Most Admired Men in America
" Alex is amused, Price is serious
The cabbie comes out and Alex heads into the airport
: '  -    - Daisy and her combo from the Viking Club perform "The Girl From Ipanema" as     and
's sit at long tables in the garden
The pleasantness of the surroundings is countered by the presence of dozens of in the background, guarding the house, etc
Visible at the head table are:     ,
,   , Elsewhere mingling are: , , ,
An elaborate array of food sits on the table
'  - Overlooking the gathering from his private living room, Somoza grants Claire her interview
He close the window to muffle the singing
You're late to your own luncheon, Mr
President -- we can schedule this for another time
Nonsense -- let them wait
We are a stunning couple, eh
My stomach is very flat -- 've been working out
We are a stunning couple
Mr
President, you own one fifth of all the land in Nicaragua, you own the shipping port, the national airlines, the Mercedes dealership
am on a salt free diet
He takes her hand and leads her to two large portraits hanging on a wall -- his parents
Do you always hold hands with reporters
(ignores her) This is my mother and father
They were very special to me
Every Sunday morning  drive out to the cemetery and put flowers on their grave think people should know that
Would you care to comment on the fall of Leon to the rebels
Somoza just smiles unaffected by her questions; she knows the game is undaunted
: - Hub Kittle is bending Price's ear in the crowd
Price seems ammused and watches the anthem contest as he munches food
Listen, Russell, let's grow up
It's very easy to fall in love with the underdog, eh
But there's an upside and downside to this thing -- just wanta remind you
this stuff about a "Revolution of Poets" is crap
But it's great
So what's the upside
Simple
And it could happen
Somoza destroys the terrorist insurgents, rebuilds the country, shitcans the purveyors of excess, stabilizes the cordoba, and is finally beloved as the savior of Nicaragua
(beat) Our pal
Got a smoke
Price gives him a cigaret
What's the downside
The Commies take over the world
It's simple, and Hub is pleased with his presentation moves through the crowd looking quite out of place, finds Hub and hands him a note
Hub reads it, seems delighted, and excuses himself from the table
Excuse me, gentlemen, but the war may be over
Price and Regis look at each other strangely -- what's he talking about
They shrug, Regis bites into a papaya, and Hub hurries inside
Price and Regis watch the singer
: '  - My people love me
My stomach is flat
Did  say that already
No matter
It is flat
There are reports that the Guardia operates a torture chamber at Coyotepe
Somoza ignores the question and reopens the window, flooding the room with the Tony Bennett classic
like this song
Since the earthquake in 1972 destroyed half of Managua, over three hundred million dollars in foreign relief aid have poured into the country, yet nothing has been re-built
It is said that the money has gone into your pocket
love the press,  really do
Some of my best friends are journalists
Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, and Panama are reportedly on the verge of breaking off diplomatic relations with your regime
Would you comment
interrupting the interview
Something has happened
Somoza initially lashes out at them -- the first time we've seen him lose his cool -- then recovers
(in Spanish) am busy
Get out of here at once or 'll put my foot up your ass
The  seems familiar with these tirades and grabs Somoza by the arm, whispering into his ear
Somoza seems delighted with the news and turns to Hub for confirmation
Hub nods
(to Claire) 'm sorry to have to conclude this most pleasant encounter, but something has happened
As Somoza leaves the room with the Officer and Hub, Hub turns to Claire to squeeze in one final
stroke
Did he tell you about his parents in the graveyard, the flowers and all that
(she nods) Good, good
Claire is left alone momentarily in Somoza's room
soldier enters and accompanies her outside to the luncheon
: - As Claire comes outside, there is a flurry of activity at the head table
hastily set up an easel with a large military-topographical map of Nicaragua takes the microphone from the Singers -- the music grinds to an inglorious halt -- and carries it to the head table
Price spots Claire and makes a "What's all this about
" motion
Claire holds out her palms and shrugs -- she doesn't know
All attention is quickly focused on the head table, as: by Hub Kittle and an Officer
He seems suddenly in unusually good spirits
Hub taps the mike -- it works -- he motions for Somoza to come forward
My friends
this gathering was not intended to be a press conference as much as a
"get-together"
but have just been handed a piece of news
Somoza plays the moment with theatrical elan
Rafael is dead
(beat) He has been killed in an ambush in the Cordillera mountains of the Jinotega district
Somoza points to a spot on the map as do his Officer
and several journalists immediately leap to their feet to question him
Mr
President
Mr
President
Please my friends -- no questions press release is being prepared
Somoza hands the mike to an aide who returns it to the music stand
Almost immediately the music begins again
there is some confusion over the announcement
Some journalists hurry off to file the story, others just sit
Price seems alarmed by the announcement, confused
Slightly wired, he listens to Regis and discuss it
They got Rafael
You believe that
Every six months Tacho gives this speech -- maybe they finally lucked out
who is heading back inside
Hub disappears inside, Claire pressing after him
and leans in as if sharing a confidence
the b
g
the luncheon is breaking up
Russell, excuse me
but 've just been put in a rather embarrassing position
(hesitates) Mrs
Somoza would like her picture taken with Miss Panama
In color
Price throws his camera bag over his shoulder, pulls out a camera, and follows Jazy
They walk toward the head table
How the hell could Tacho find Rafael
Russell, please
have my hands full
Mrs
Somoza and Miss Panama are waiting as Price and Jazy arrive
Price is automatically switching camera lenses, but he continues to grill Jazy
Tacho, Tacho
venga, por favor
Price and Jazy exchange glances as Somoza reluctantly joins the portrait
as Price flashes a light meter under their noses, then backs off to take the picture
Is Tacho lying again
They did kill him, didn't they
Everybody smile
Price takes a picture, Somoza wants to leave and Jazy would just as soon have this awkward moment over with, but: One more, please
Una mas, por favor
Reluctantly they pose again, and Price grills Jazy who is trapped
We help each other, right
Could you move your girlfriend into the sun
Jazy moves Miss Panama slightly, returning to Price
What do you need
Is Rafael alive or dead
don't know
(to the posers) Just one more -- thank you
(to Jazy) thought you knew everything
As Somoza holds an interminable pose, Jazy launches into a speech, keeping his voice low enough so Tacho cannot hear
What do  know, eh
Tacho needs a victory very badly
he needs to prove to Jimmy Carter that he is still winning
He thinks Rafael's death is the proof he needs
Carter don't need proof
He just sent twenty-five million in new arms to Tacho
(to posers) 'm sorry
almost got it here
No, no
the arms shipment has been delayed in New Orleans because Jimmy is getting nervous
The State Department's gonna pull the plug on Tacho
Pardon my French -- but whose fucking side are you on
Jazy and Price motion for the posers to move a step over
work for everybody
If there is a transition of power,  facilitate a relationship with the new people
If there is not,  facilitate the status quo
(beat) Either way,  facilitate
Great job
send messages to Jimmy and  tell him that the Revolution is a flood that cannot be stopped but it can be controlled
nobody listens can't even get a little water in my pool
Rough ain't it
Thank you everybody, very nice
Price smiles to Somoza, Mrs
Somoza, and Miss Panama
Somoza hurries off from his uncomfortable position at last
don't think Rafael is dead
'm gonna find him
They say he's very handsome
(beat) It would make a wonderful picture, eh
The two men share a smile
: - rental station wagon covered with press flags races along
Inside the car are the British crew -- Regis drives -- and Price and Claire
: - city of about 50,000 located on the side of a hill
The car pulls slowly into the base of the town into a clearing with assorted vehicles -- Red Cross, La Guardia, Press
The car moves slowly as its occupants survey the town, until it pulls alongside a Red Cross truck that has broken down
Price sticks his head out the window to ask instructions of a
Con permiso -- who controls what today
(in Spanish) The Sandinistas hold the hills, the Guardia has everything else
How do we find the guerillas
(points) Va alli, dos o tres cuartos, doble la esquina al francotirador
What'd he say
Go two or three blocks and turn right at the sniper
Regis and his crew don't like this at all
Price points
You can drop us off
gradual uphill grade -- the press car moves slowly
Guardia are on both sides of the street, as the car stops at the corner, directly beneath the sniper tower
They all look up
Wrong way
We're not looking for the guerillas
Then let us out
The car stops, the door opens, and: , so they climb back in quickly
, "accident
" Lo siento
('m sorry
) The soldier seems sincere, but they don't want to take a chance
Go one more block
, gradually moving among tanquettas patrolling the streets, coming to a barricade which they manuever past as Guardia soldiers look at them strangely
The car turns around -- it has come too far
but the idea doesn't appeal to Regis and he whirls around, panicking slightly, and heads off in the other direction
He just wanted to see credentials, for crissakes, what're doing
You want to drive
We want out
to a squadron leader a couple of blocks away as the car approaches
but it speeds up
-- and Regis panics, hitting the floorboard and the car suddenly screeches around a corner, racing through Matagalpa
The car squeals around corner after corner blindly, into: The windshield is totally destroyed now, and: as the car races
Price and Claire scream at Regis to stop, but it's too late
as Regis tries to see out the back window and Price, out of necessity operates the foot pedal with his hand
The car smokes into an intersection and sees: -- no Guardia are visible, so the car races down the open block and as it comes to an intersection: Several times larger than a tanquetta -- it dwarfs us and everything around it
Its giant gun faces us head on
, and everyone scrambles out
Periodista, periodista, periodista
The mini-cam equipment is dropped as the British crew scrambles to safety against a building
Price and Claire end up on opposite sides of the street
Silence -- the huge and silent tank is deciding what to do
and lowers as the scattered journalists freeze
-- leaving a huge crater and not a trace of the expensive qear
, , nervous and amused
The tiny bomb makes a pitiful explosion, hopelessly ineffective
and the wall of the house crumbles quickly as a family scrambles to the rooftop of a neighboring house
Their house is destroyed in a second
Claire and Price, who turn to see: alongside the homemade local guerillas
This is the first time we've seen the
regular army in their camouflaged khaki dress
and Claire and Price are caught in a cross-fire, pinned to walls on each street side
and looks back: pounding on a door that doesn't open
She tries another -- no luck
She curls up in a doorway making herself as small as possible as bullets rip the wall around her
, Several youthful guerillas are pushing it
Several hundred feet away, it gathers speed toward us
at the wheel props a board under the steering wheel and races to the back as   opens the door as the bus races past Claire toward the tank
where they tumble into the dirt just before: before they get away, as: opening heavy fire on La Guardia
but cannot, and drags the bus with it as it backs down the hill
and huddles with her
She is shaken but unhurt
, moving into Matagalpa as Price and Claire move past several bodies to higher ground
where women serve food to their men
Claire and Price wander through, momentarily disoriented
small boy runs through the street kicking a soccer ball, occasionally avoiding a body
He runs right up to them and speaks
Busca triquitraques
Si
Venga
They follow him up a hill
: -     - and several guerillas are at the door
The boy speaks to one of the guards, and they are admitted
: - , asked to put down their gear, asked for credentials, and led down the hallway of a house that is very American middle class
detains them momentarily before showing them into a room used as a Revolutionary Command office
talking to her Sandinista colleagues
Clearly she commands respect and makes decisions
She finishes and turns to Claire and Price in a very businesslike way, never acknowledging directly that they have met before
You are looking for Rafael
They are somewhat taken aback at her directness and information
Yeah
If it's possible
Do you know why we're here
exactly
Mr
Price doesn't do anything before announcing it first in the bar
(beat) It's a good story
You'll be more famous
-  - An old truck chugs up a series of cutbacks through rough terrain
The truck has no hood, and a  sits on the fender pouring oil from a series of Folgers cans into a funnel stuck permanently into the engine
Underneath, dangling cans catch the oil as it flows through
Price, Claire and sit in the back
rides in front
: - , ,      into increasingly inaccessible terrain
: '  - Heavily guarded but very mobile, the camp consists of perhaps 100 Soldiers, women preparing food, several tents
Price and Claire attract attention as they enter
seeming to take it all in
He's been in many similar camps, countries, wars
Rafael's tent
Price doesn't answer but continues taking it all in, and shouts to them to continue
Venga, companeros
(Come, comrades
) ,     Something has caught him, his sixth sense, a feeling -- he refuses to walk further for the moment
No glibness, just coolness
What is it
Price looks around, speaks quietly
Rafael is dead
Claire looks around quickly
There is no evidence to her
can smell it
don't know
(slightly exasperated) Venga por favor
Alli
They continue into the camp -- now Claire looks around nervously
Price mutters a half laugh, softly and strangely, as they are led to a makeshift table and offered food
In the b
g
Isela enters one of the tents
and Price continues scanning the camp as they talk
What're you talking about
He's dead
know it
Then why did they bring us all the way here to see him
He doesn't know
/      Isela emerges and joins them
The others are:    , , , dressed in camouflaged khaki
after talking with the others
She brings   with her
They sit down
This is Commandante Cinco
They all shake hands
Isela begins at once
Today we took Matagalpa
Leon is about to fall, and Masaya
And next week we could be in Managua but it is still possible to lose
(beat) In the last days of our final offensive the people of Nicaragua must know that Rafael is alive and well
Queremos un fotografia
We need a photograph
(beat) Come with us
' ' The tent is filled with Sandinista officers and soldiers standing and sitting around
'      The shirtless upper torso propped slightly upright, still wearing glasses, the figure of Rafael is distinctly non-heroic
He is slightly overweight, slightly balding, but as he lies there surrounded by his men, the the glow of lanterns, he looks almost alive
Price and Claire look at each other
Usted es un fotografo magnifico
(beat) Queremos que vive
(You are a great photographer
Make him alive
) Price laughs -- the request is ridiculous
(to Claire) Why is he laughing
You're crazy
Cinco steps forward -- his presence commands attention
His delivery is forceful but not emotional
As he begins to speak, Price stops laughing
(in Spanish) We have momentum, but many more lives will be lost
Even Washington is starting to admit that the butcher Somoza is not loved by his people
They have detained twenty-five million dollars in new arms shipments for Somoza at an airfield in Florida until they find out if Rafael is alive or dead
We know about these things
He pauses briefly
If Washington thinks Rafael is dead, they will ship the arms to Somoza
Do you understand
Yeah
(without enthusiasm) Commandante
Soy un periodista
attacks that defense with new vigor
This has nothing to do with journalism -- there is more to the world than journalism
We are going to end this war with you or without you
(beat) People don't really believe in Rafael -- they believe in the idea of Rafael, no
Because for now the idea of Rafael is enough for the people of Nicaragua
When the war is over -- none of this matters
hesitates, his manner devoid of its usual cockiness
don't do things
like this
Enough lives have been lost already
(beat of empathy) It's difficult,  know -- but you must do it
'  and speaks in broken English
In the morning, eh
When there's better light
: '  - Price lies on his back on a table
Claire sits in a chair, a lantern is on the table
His reclining body is not unlike Rafael's
He plays with a camera without looking at it, turning it slowly, removing and replacing a lens
He's never been this calm, this unmoving
Claire, however, moves around the tent like a caged animal -- like Price normally is
She smokes
She's nervous and wired
spend my whole life separating how feel from how  think and what see from what  say -- that's called journalism, isn't it
He nods slightly
It's disciplined
It civilized
It involves distinctions
'm great at distinctions
wish  wasn't so good at them
Sometimes  envy you -- you don't make any -- it's very convenient
(beat) The only time  don't worry about all those things is when 'm with my daughter
Or when you're in bed
Yes
(beat -- changes direction) My job is to find a story, then tell a story -- whatever it is -- because believe that if enough people hear enough stories then somehow, through information alone, we all have a better chance to survive
(beat) believe in information
(beat) That's a very romantic streak  have running through me -- maybe it's a weakness
Information is good -- lack of information is bad
Simple, eh
Not so simple
You're God damn right it's not
(beat) You take that picture you'll take it for all the right reasons -- understand
'm not gonna take it
He fiddles with the cameras
That's fine for you
But do  go back and say  interviewed Rafael
Do  go back and say  missed the biggest story of the war
Or do say Rafael was stone cold dead -- that's the information, isn't it
Or do  say he entertained us all in his inimitably charismatic manner around the ol' revolutionary campfire
(beat) Can we throw up our arms and say we fell in love with the querillas because their cause was
sympathetic
(beat) Journalists don't fall in love
(beat) Which story do you want me to tell
Silence
Do what you want to do
Christ, what the fuck are we doing here
want to be here
(beat) With you
(beat) What do you want
Silence
want this war to end
(beat) 'm not going to tell the world that Rafael is dead
Silence
Claire lies down on the cot
Exhausted but high
Price gets off the table and goes to her
love you
think  love you
Don't think so much
He gets on the cot with her
They kiss deeply, passionately, and begin making love
- as the flap opens on Price's tent and he looks out
He raises his camera and starts taking pictures of: , a face we recognize from earlier in Managua -- -- -- -- -- , wandering over to a large can where he drinks some water
and watches Price head over to a shaded area with his cameras
' Their backs are toward us as he adjusts seating positions and rearranges items that have been provided for the table
He takes a light reading and moves quickly into position
Price raises his camera
: '
, , They sit at a table studying a map, a copy of La Prensa is displayed -- the headlines declare that    and featuring a photo of Somoza at the luncheon as he points to a map of the country
For an instant Rafael looks alive -- : - Price and Claire are sitting on top of a Red Cross truck as it heads through Sebaco
Soldiers from La Guardia are everywhere
As the truck moves through the village, something catches Price's eyes: Two whores and several troops sit against a wall
As the truck passes, Oates waves casually, with emotion
: '     - Red light in the bathroom as Price pulls several photo prints from the bath and plasters them wet against the mirror
, and he looks very much alive
He pulls more shots from the bath:    , ,
He dries them off and hides them with their negatives under a pile of equipment
He picks up the shot of Rafael and leaves
: group of muchachos in masks, baseball caps, and bandanas race through the streets carrying a photo blow-up of Rafael
: ' The newspaper headline sits on Jazy's desk as Jazy studies it unemotionally
We hear Miss Panama's voice: Marcel
He spins on his chair as she glides in modeling a new dress
She spins magically for him -- he blows her a kiss
: - small private plane flies through a canyon, dwarfed by the spectacular landscape
Hub Kittle works the room
- Two   hold a gun to the head of a pilot large sack is crammed into the tiny compartment with them
- The plane flies in low over the town and suddenly: that flutter to the ground
Townspeople, bewildered at first, pick up the papers to see: -- ' to the plane as it disappears into the mountains
: - Journalists are gathered to watch the fighting which is now on the outskirts of Managua
Price stands to the side casually taking pictures of Journalists taking pictures of the war
Hub Kittle floats around providing drinks and
-     on the capitol
Columns of smoke rise throughout the city
- We got the smoke in frame
(moves the camera slightly) We got the smoke
Roll it
with binoculars watching
She accepts a drink from Hub and speaks into her tape deck
Under a steel gray July sky
start again
under a gray steel Managuan sky
scratch it
In an extraordinary development in Managua, President Anastazio Somoza has ordered the Air Force to begin bombing his own capitol, under a sky
fuck it
She fires down the drink and puts down the mike
She picks up the binoculars again and, glancing below, is shocked: -- He starts into the hotel, glances up, and they see each other
Oh my God
Price sees Alex at the same time
Alex waves to both of as he heads into the hotel
Price and Claire look at each other
Claire sits down at a table, stunned to see Alex
Price commandeers a waiter and joins her with a fresh tray of drinks
Scotch, please
(he nods) Double
Price joins her as other journalists jockey for position at the railing
He is equally upset and confused
What's he doing here
have no idea
with a couple journalists, sees Price and Claire and comes over to join them
polite kiss on Claire's cheek, a handshake for Price
moment of awkwardness
Congratulations
On what
On what
The Washington Post, the Times, networks, wire services -- everybody's picked up the picture
It's fabulous
(nervously) Well, yes
it's fabulous
Fabulous
Unsure silence
Why are you back
came back because of Russell
Because of me
Yeah
the whole fucking East Coast is falling in love with Rafael -- they were sure he was dead this time
Somebody wants to do a musical about him and his mug's on every -shirt in Central Park
Alex enjoys the lunatic mixture of politics and popular culture
think he's bigger than Farrah Fawcett
Claire and Price struggle to enjoy this supremely uncomfortable moment
It's not easy to enter the game
Claire attempts to change the subject
You look good
Things're okay
'm happier in New York, sure, things are great
You guys
Terrific
now
'm a little slow here, Alex
what exactly did you come back for
No more games
Alex addresses Price with conviction
It's a great story
(beat) want to talk to Rafael
and you're the only man in the world that can take me to him
Price's and Claire's hearts sink
They look at each other
Alex, despite his reluctance to return to Nicaragua, seems genuinely enthused about the possible story
Before Price or Claire respond, Hub Kittle notices Alex and comes over with a tray of drinks, extending genuine greetings to the Senior Correspondent
Alex
Couldn't stay away, eh
The fresh round of drinks are put on the table
The sound of bombs ripping the capitol are the only thing we hear
: '  - Claire and Price now have adjoining rooms
She is staring out the window as he comes in
The mood is strained
We've got to tell Alex what happened
No way
'll tell him
He deserves to know
We don't owe him anything
We owe him that
(beat) He got you started in this business
he covered for your missed deadlines and made excuses for your unprofessional attitude before the world fell in love with your pictures
(beat) Before kids fresh out of journalism school were rushing off to any war they could to interview bullets and take pictures of bodies -- like Price
(beat) He took care of you before you were hot
Silence
She's hitting home but he doesn't want to acknowledge it
He wouldn't understand
Before Nicaragua you wouldn't understand
'm not sure  exactly understand
(beat) What are we going to do
There is something calculating in Price's tone, this is not the fearless, boyish innocent anymore
'll take Alex to find Rafael -- we'll go to Sebaco on the road to Matagalpa -- the Guardia heavily control the area and they're scared right now -- they'll never let us through
We won't be able to get near Rafael
Alex will understand -- and we'll turn around and drive back without a story
Claire is disturbed at this compounding of the lie
That's a lie
Tell me about lies
Silence
They are co-conspirators and they know it
don't want to tell him either
: - Price's white flagged newly rented press car streaks along, overtaking an ox cart
guardia convoy is going the opposite direction, back toward Managua
Alex looks out of the car with interest--he hasn't been to the front line for several wars
We may not be able to find him, y'know
've got supreme confidence in you
car is on fire by the side of the road
Price flies past; Alex watches curiously
Several people stand around the car
Claire looks good, eh
Everybody looks good in the tropics
Alex isn't sure how to respond to this curious reply
Since  haven't been able to find Isela since coming back, you're going to have to translate for me -- what the hell does that mean
Price is nervous, wired, on edge
Alex
love her
Alex takes this calmly -- it's not exactly new information
And she 'thinks' she loves you
It's past the thinking stage
Alex looks at the passing scenery -- he's in no hurry
'd like to know something -- it probably doesn't matter in the great final scheme of things
but 'm interested
(beat) Did you ever lay a hand on her before she left me
No
That's the truth
Yes
(beat) Alex -- we're friends
There is something desperate in his voice
: - Price and Alex are ordered out of their car by a very unfriendly Guardia soldier
He is ordered to put down his camera bag
The hood and trunk are opened
Venga
They are led to a shed by the roadside,    , where they sit down in an oily, dusty shack
They watch the soldiers: , pulling off door panels, looking for weapons
bet you go through a few rental cars
Don't worry
put this in your name
at the sound of screaming in the distance
volley of gunfire follows
Price moves quickly into an adjoining shed and looks through a crack in the wall: as several bodies are being hauled away
Two soldiers reload their guns
to a figure moving behind a wall --
as Alex calls to him and hurries after -- Price is single- minded
As he moves through the shacks we hear another volley of fire, and Price bursts into a clearing to see: -- --
They look at each other for several beats before anyone speaks
Oates is slightly embarrassed
No pictures, eh
Might look bad
Oates smiles half-way; Price looks around at the bodies
You get paid by the body or by the hour
get paid the same way you do
What the fuck you doin' in Sebaco -- this place's about to blow
ain't it
You didn't have to nail Pedro
Who's Pedro
Alex arrives and tries to pull Price back -- at the same time he sees the bodies and is sickened at the sight
Oh my God
body is carried through and loaded on a truck
Oates's tone is one of explanation rather than defense, very matter- of-fact
There's a motherfucking war goin' on, pal
lotta sad stories
Price mumbles and wanders to the next truck a few feet away, and as he sees it he stops short, speechless
He points: , figures we saw at Rafael's camp, sit in the back of the truck
They are splattered with blood and lifeless
Price is shaken
Why them
Why them
Oates has to look to see who he's talking about, and Price loses his cool
You're a cocksucker
don't suck no dick, man
but Oates responds like an animal
The two men go down in a heap and lash out at each other in the dust
Their fighting is largely ineffective, though very physical, until Oates asserts himself and knocks Price against a wall, breaking free to pick up his automatic rifle that he handles with one hand and shoves it into Price's face
'd prefer not splattering your brains in a dump like this --  got priorities
(to Alex) Guy wants to be a hero, pops, get him outta here before he's a number
(beat) Be a shitty little town to buy it in
(beat) Who are you
Russell, let's get outta here
(to Oates) Fuck you
Guy's got a sense of humor, old man
(beat) Got any dope
Tough place to find decent dope
Why them
Them
'mere
You too
He leads them under an awning nearby where a couple soldiers sit
small table, some weapons, two shallow boxes, food, beer
Oates rummages around to find what he wants, and pulls out: , mostly snapshots, odd sizes, with names written on them
He sifts through them quickly and we see an assortment of photographs of Nicaraguans
He finds what he's looking for and holds up: '       , the picture taken in Rafael's camp, blown up, cropped, and identified
The faces are circled
If your mug shows up in this box
and ya try to make it through Sebaco
owe yer ass
This information hits Price in the gut, and he is seized with fear
Who gives you the pictures
What's this, an interview
ain't that dumb
Price turns, he doesn't want to face it
Off the record
Off the record
some pachuco gives 'em to me
Ain't none of my business, but  heard he gets 'em from a Frog
Oates pulls another picture from a different box and holds it up: Nice, eh
She dead
Not yet
Alex grabs Price and heads back toward the roadblock
Whatya' expect
We're the ones gettin' our butts kicked
: - Price hangs a -turn at the roadblock and heads back to Managua
He drives crazily
Some-motherfucker-took-my-fucking- pictures--don't-fucking-know-what- happened
(beat) Fuck me
Silence
Didn't you ship the film to New York
developed it in my room
(pleads) Jesus Christ, Alex
Silence
The car races
Slow down
(compassionately) It wasn't your fault if somebody stole your stuff
It was
Alex doesn't force the issue, nor does he understand it entirely
What about Rafael
No answer -- the car races back to Managua
Alex stares at Price trying to figure out what is wrong
: '      - which is the usual disaster
Price enters, just returned, and quickly looks for his negatives under the equipment where he had hidden them
Algo no esta aqui
Fotografias
(Something is not here
Photographs
) (in Spanish) Everything's always a mess here
You should be neater
Negativos, negativos
The maid shrugs -- Price is crazy anyway, and: She too looks shaken
He looks up
Commandante Cinco's body was just found on the road to Matagalpa
The maid starts crying
They look at her helplessly as she sobs, 'Cinco, Cinco
' : - cab takes them through the increasingly nervous city
La Guardia troop trucks are everywhere -- things seem more hurried
hunting rifle sits in the cabbie's lap
They get out and knock on Jazy's door
, a development that Price and Claire are aware of
don't think it's Jazy
Still no answer
Oates said it was a Frog
How many Frenchmen you know around here
Jazy ain't 'facilitating' shit
Price is impatient
He looks around nervously -- the Guards are out of view -- and he slides a knife into the latch, jimmying the lock
The door opens slowly -- an alarm goes off
Price and Claire duck inside quickly
Christ
Price, momentarily comfortable with the danger, responds quickly and finds the alarm wire running along the door jamb
and head toward Jazy's
which he pries open and expertly pulls two wires
The alarm stops
Immediately they begin going through drawers and cupboards
She pulls out some harmless snapshots of Miss Panama, replaces them
Are we looking for negs or prints
Anything
They find nothing downstairs
The look up at the sound of distant gunfire
Suddenly: Loud banging at the front door -- La Guardia
- They look around warily, hungrily -- they know something is wrong
we hear the shouting soldiers, banging
Price and Claire look at each other, and the camera bag
Claire points upstairs to Price, to the door for herself
Russell grabs the bag and bounds quickly upstairs
Claire goes to the front door, shaking nervously
Que quiere
(What do you want
) Donde esta senor Jazy
No esta aqui
Que quienes
(Who are you
) (smiles) Una novia suya
( girlfriend of his
) The soldiers look at each other curiously and push open the door to look in the house without entering -- respectful of Jazy
#2 El hombre tiene muchas novias, eh
(The man has many girlfriends, no
) The soldiers laugh and peer into the room
Claire forces the door closed on them, teasing slightly
No, no, no
Afraid to make a mistake with one of Jazy's sweethearts, they don't press the issue
The door closes shut
sighs with frightened relief and hurries upstairs to join Price
'  as she enters
rumpled bed, a spilled wine glass -- a pleasant mess
Russell
(no answer) Russell
door off the bedroom is open -- light spills out
Claire stops cold at what she sees: Hundreds of pictures of all sizes, photographic equipment, an enlarger, cameras and lenses, etc
Pictures of Sandino, newspaper photos, snapshots
'   '  cropped and blown up -- Commandante Cinco, the Priest of Leon, the Businessman, Isela
Photographs of other slain rebel leaders
The pictures include faces that have been circled with names written in -- exactly as in the pictures Oates possessed
They are both stunned
Let's get out of here
and as they get to the front door -- the sound of somebody opening it
They freeze
She smiles and greets them in a friendly, aloof manner, and continues toward the waterless pool
Hola
Price and Claire return the greeting and continue out the door
: '  - As they emerge, Claire tears a white cloth in half and ties it to a stick, handing half to Price who does likewise
An earth mover goes past, a Guardia soldier at the wheel
More soldiers cling to the machine, their guns at the ready
We've got to talk to Alex
They start walking
You think our flags are big enough
Flags held high, they move nervously down the street into the ominous silence of the city
: - Alex, Price, and Claire get out of a cab and approach a large statue of Somoza on horseback, surreally lit by floodlights in the center of a traffic circle
Four Guardia Soldiers are visible on the sidewalk in the b
g
drinking with two women
This is what  want to show you
We drove through three roadblocks a half hour before curfew so you could show me a statue of Tacho
It's not Tacho
It's Mussolini
Tacho went to Italy to commission a statue of himself, he found a warehouse full of Il Duces on horseback, got a great deal on one of 'em -- brought it back and switched heads
(beat) Ya can't tell, can ya
Silence
Alex knows Price too well -- it's a great story but that's not why they're here
What the hell are you talking about
think what he's trying to say -- what we're trying to say -- is that things aren't exactly what they seem to be
Well, they don't "seem" to be that great so  can't wait for this one
(mocks silliness) Hey, here we are
Two guys in the tropics in love with the same dame
bullets flying
Alex
That's not why we're here
Oh yeah
left the country because of him
(points to Price) and  came back because of him
(beat) And now the cutest couple in town has me looking up a horse's ass on a midnight tour of Managua
(points up the statue's ass) What are we doing here
Silence
Claire addresses Alex calmly
Rafael is dead
Silence
Alex isn't quite sure he understood
In the picture he's dead
(shouts) Dead
How the hell
(interrupts quickly) Who cares how
Silence
bit of gallows laughter from Alex as he circles the statue
Price calms and tries to explain
Alex
think  finally saw one too many bodies
(beat) Somoza is a killer
(beat) thought the war would end sooner
(beat) How many reasons do you want
You saw too many bodies
That's a lot of bodies
(beat; to Price) You stupid son of a bitch
(to Claire) Did he talk you into it
No
wanted Rafael to be alive
In some way  understand him doing it,  don't like it but understand
but you
'd do it again
Alex lets it all sink in
These two people about whom he has such passionate feelings have totally exposed themselves to him
You two have, of course, just served me up your balls -- if that's what they're called -- on a platter
(several beats) can bury you both
You're handing me your careers
They don't respond -- he's right
Well, Jesus Christ
this is a motherfucking story, Russell
(long silence) What am  supposed to do with it
Anything you want
Small, tired gallows laughter from Alex
There is a long silence before Alex speaks, aware of the irony
They're holding the lead in the World section for Rafael
It's great stuff, isn't it
We'd go down in a blaze of glory
Oh yeah
(distraught) don't know what to do
(beat) 've gotta take some kind of a story back with me
Maybe Jazy, eh
Oh Jesus
It's a little dangerous looking for Jazy at the moment
(mock heroic) Ah, danger --  love it
You could ask the pointy-shoed little bastard about your pictures
and  could ask him whatever happened to Isela
She's an officer in the Rafael army -- we saw her in Matagalpa
Alex is surprised slightly, but takes pleasure in revealing it
You mean  slept with a Sandinista
Price and Claire exchange glances
Alex is dead serious
guess Rafael is alive, eh
: '  - sweating
siren and distant mortar can be heard outside
Price goes to the window and shuts it -- the room is quieter and hotter
He pounds a broken air conditioning duct
Damn air conditioning
He looks out the window -- it never used to be this complicated
wish  was home
Silence
'mere
She goes to him, lies down, and they embrace
Do you think it's almost over
loud, long burst of automatic weapons fire is heard somewhere outside
Their eyes are open as they hold onto each other
: - sense of foreboding
Heavy road equipment prowls the street looking for Rebel barricades to destroy
Tanquettas and Guardia everywhere
The flag draped press car of Price and Alex drives slowly
Things feel wrong
Guardia barricades are everywhere, forcing them to follow a route they might not choose
The Guardia soldiers at the barricades seem on edge
When Jazy's house is visible in the distance, barricades force them another direction
and the car stops
When the road is clear it creeps into an intersection
They check their position
and they look around further
100 Everything is wrong
Price looks around restlessly
Alex
let's go back
Jazy's probably sitting in the bar laughing at us
Which way's the hotel
don't know
'll ask her
be right back
Just a sec'
take a flag
But Alex is out of the car at once, approaching the woman
Alex motions that "it's not necessary" and talks to the woman
We can't hear, but she points down the block
Price cranks film into place, his actions are automatic and nervous
When he looks up: Walking in the direction she pointed, he motions to Price as if to say, "Just checking this out
" And as he does, looks through the camera
followed by quick blurred pans to other images -- , , ,  -- until it settles on
Two Guardia soldiers come up to him and he holds out his hands as if to say, "'m lost
" --   click, click -- and the whirring sound of a motor drive, another click, click, more whirring -- Price is on automatic pilot
Another soldier orders Alex up against a wall
Nobody sees Price taking pictures -- it happens too quickly
--   click, click, whirring as the images blur and the camera is dropped
The act was random, almost nonchalant
shouting madly
You fucks
You fucks
He stops quickly as they see him, realizing how exposed he is
, realizing the murder was recorded
Fotografia
: and starts it up, racing around the corner as bullets rip into the car
,        He clutches his bleeding arm as he races on
- and Price leaps from it, racing into a maze of ramshackle huts
: ' hastily called press conference
Tacho takes a quick drag on a cigarette and makes the announcement
It is with grave concern that we announce that Alexander Grazier, senior American correspondent, has been murdered at the hands of terrorists
shock wave goes through the room -- hands raised, questions
Mr
Kittle has prepared statements for you
Somoza turns and leaves as Kittle passes out press statements
: ' is on
She's at the typewriter working on a story
, with Spanish language commentary over the image
the story, finally rising and moving in front of the television as a local newsman reads of Alex's death and we see the Somoza press announcement
The phone rings: Claire picks up the phone and listens silently before hanging up
She sits down shakily on the bed and starts crying
: - the passageways between tin shacks, through tiny yards of goats and chickens, through houses as poor that the war has nearly passed them by
Price is hurting, and looks around with fear to see: , fanning out to quickly engulf the barrio
They move quickly
over the barrio and opens up sporadic outbursts of fire to insure nobody will try to flee
and nearly runs right into the Guardia
He hides behind a paper thin wall of flattened beer cans -- the Guardia move past him only inches away
Price starts off in another direction, but Guardia appear -- he is trapped in the barrio
: Journalists are everywhere -- suitcases packed -- trying to get out of the country
The registration desk is chaos
Regis tries to get the attention of the clerk -- so does everyone else
Get my bill and get me a cab, hey, amigo
The clerk is under attack
No cabs
Cabs
No cabs
Regis sees her and tries to give her comfort -- she's beyond that
She wears a jacket and carries her bag -- she's going somewhere
'm sorry, Claire
She pushes him away politely; she is single-minded now
Heard from Russell
Nobody has
Wanta help me find him
Regis looks at her like she's crazy
Claire
it's on the weird side out there
Hub Kittle enters the lobby, sees Claire and volunteers: Jesus Christ, Claire, a human tragedy, what can  say
Claire is nearly in tears, but resists
Fuck off, Hub, get outta my way
: -    '  - Claire stays in her car and watches the house -- no way to get close -- and she continues driving, her route dictated by the same barricades that directed Alex and Price
She passes the dead pig in the street, and make their way slowly around a corner, frightened
Claire gets out of her car and approaches them
(in Spanish) Do you know where the American journalist was killed
They all point down a street
She shows them the polaroid of Price and her
(in Spanish) Have you seen him
They haven't and continue on their way
Claire walks in the direction they pointed -- no street fighting but many Guardia
' : - as soldiers move through the yards looking for him
for Price to dart inside
: - Nothing is said
Price is led into a room, one of many -- but this room is boarded over
There is no escape
Price is in pain, his arm bleeds, he's tiring
(in Spanish) This is the best  can offer
Gracias
He leans against the wall behind the door
He shuts his eyes -- a noise at the door
When he opens them: She hands it to him and leaves, bolting the door
and he waits -- cameras around his neck, gun in hand, bloody, slightly ridiculous, and scared
: - Price's shot up car is not far away, but she's afraid to approach it
She shows the picture of Price to a small boy who doesn't recognize it
and walks toward her
She cannot tell if the act is routine or threatening
He calls out to her
Venga aqui
She hesitates -- Alex is dead, everything is crazy
She starts toward him, then changes her mind, turns, and walks quickly away from him
and darts into a narrow passageway behind a house, where she looks back
He calls for support -- several join him and hurry after her
Panicky, she runs between houses
as Claire emerges from the 'maze' to see: '   and full of holes near the shanty town
Guardia are everywhere
The helicopter gunship is overhead
: - He hears the Guard breaking in, and he cocks his gun
as the Squadron Leader and three soldiers burst in -- the woman stands in the middle of the room and lies
(in Spanish) Nobody is here
Get out
The Sqaudron Leader points to different rooms for each soldier, and they proceed to kick in each door, automatic rifles ready
'
, For a moment he doesn't see Price -- then he whirls and faces the photographer who's so scared he's forgotten to raise his gun
-- The soldier is a fourteen-year-old boy fighting back tears
He, too, is scared to death
Neither is quite sure why he is there -- they just want it to end
as they hear the voice of the Squadron Leader in the other room
Esta alli
(Is he there
) No answer
Esta alli
but as he does, the boy soldier appears in the doorway
No esta aqui
The Leader grunts an order, and the squadron quickly heads to the next house
'      , and the woman enters as soon as the last soldier has gone
Price's brief moment of peace is shattered by the screaming of Guardia troops and the explosions of rocket fire from the gunship
He looks outside
killing several of its own Guardia troops
screams at the gunship and fires a hand gun at the giant chopper
(in Spanish) We are you
We are you
What are you doing
in a panicky scramble to escape their own gunship
, taking advantage of the chaos, and without slowing down, breaks free of the maze of the barrio
'
, past a body and an overturned, smoking car, back into the rubble strewn blocks of the edge of the city
tanquetta comes around a corner and sees Price a block away
Russell
, and races along a wall until they meet, grabbing her on the run -- each is panicky and frightened -- and they duck into very shallow cover, barely safe
What're you doing here
They embrace quickly and tightly, but look around nervously as they do
Price isn't sure if anybody knows about Alex
Alex
The Guardia did it --  got pictures
, visible through shattered holes in the buildings
Guardia squadron passes
in the opposite direction, their path guided somewhat by an overturned bus in an intersection, abandoned barricades and roadblocks, and the rubble of street fighting
: '  - hesitate at the corner and move slowly along, seeing two Sandinistas, dressed half in camouflaged gear, half disco
The   seem to control the street
Price and Claire approach warily
Hola
(the Guerrillas nod; in Spanish) Do you control this area
The Sandinista looks at his comrade, then looks around nervously, frightened, then shrugs
(in Spanish) don't know
Price and Claire continue on down the street and simultaneously noticed something strange: '     They approach carefully and look in a view to the court-yard
Claire sticks her head in the door slowly, and as she does: as quickly seize her and Price, dragging them inside
: '  - , being held by the most forceful and crazed of three young Muchachos
With guns on Jazy, Price, and Claire, there is much confusion as to who's in charge and what exactly they're doing
#1 (in Spanish) Who are you
They are my friends
#2 (in Spanish) Shut up
We kill them all
#3 (in Spanish) No
Only him
The guns are aimed back and forth in confusion -- Price and Claire don't have a chance to respond, and they're not sure what to say
#1 (in Spanish) Him or him or her
The Muchachos begin arguing rapidly among themselves; and as they do, Jazy addresses Price and Claire coolly
Well, here we are, eh
#1 (in Spanish) Assassin
Shut up
The boys are confused -- they think had their family killed
You murder people
"Murder" is a word for criminals have a job to protect the stability of a continent
#3 Pig
Hijo de puta
Please
He is not begging for his life as much as for them to calm down
You got caught by some boys
Yes
Poets too,  imagine
(beat) Is your recorder on
(hesitates) Yes
Good
have a speech to make
The Muchachos don't understand what he's saying, but they stop to listen to his style
The guns remained trained on all three
like you people, but you are sentimental shits
You fall in love with the poets, the poets fall in love with the Marxists, the Marxists fall in love with themselves
The country is destroyed with rhetoric, and in the end we are stuck with tyrants
#1 (in Spanish) Shut up
Jazy turns to the boy who jams the gun into his head and speaks with tired authority
Un minuto, por favor
#2 (to Price and Claire, more calmly) Who are you
(in Spanish) They are journalists
The Muchachos are immediately surprised and delighted, and one of them speaks in excited, broken English
#1 Periodistas
Take this picture
'm going to blow his head off
The Muchachos quickly withdraw their guns from Price and Claire and aim them all at Jazy's head
Somoza
He is a tyrant too, of course
butcher
(beat) But finally that is not the point, you see
If we wish to survive -- we have a choice of tyrants, and for all the right reasons, your poets choose the wrong side
#1 (impatiently) Fotografia
No
Yes
(beat) Your picture of Rafael was brilliant
but  am alive, and better looking
good looking Frenchman with a sympathetic face is murdered in cold blood while fighting for the survival of Europe and America
(beat) You will have another magazine cover
(smiles) Muy complicado, no
#1 (in Spanish) Ready
Now
You picked the wrong side
In fifty years we will know who's right
(beat) Are you going to take the picture as the bullet enters the skull or as it comes out
This wall's a nice color, eh
can move into the sunlight
, her back to the scene
(to Claire) It's just a story
as the Muchachos grow increasingly impatient
Some part of him wants to take the picture
#1 (in Spanish) Shut up
They say that if somebody's holding a gun on you, you should never stop talking
that's the theory -- who knows
toward Claire
Still -- Jazy talks
Maybe it's a good thing that  talk too much
Price grimaces
Claire shuts her eyes
They turn to look at the fallen Jazy as the Three Muchachos, frightened by their own act, race back into the street
For several moments Price and Claire stand, frozen, until the rumbling sound of a helicopter gunship nearby forces them to hurry outside
and look out as a jeep full of Guardia screams past a block away
The neighborhood seems to be changing hands again
Price and Claire slump in the darkness near the doorway; she touches near his wounded arm
You okay
(he nods) Russell
what did Alex do
Nothing
He asked for directions
She shakes her head and leans it against Price's shoulder but the distant popping of guns does not even allow her a moment of mourning
Their heads pop up nervously
We gotta get outta sight -- half the fucking army's looking for me
They're not looking for me
Silence
Let me have the film
(beat; unsure) if  can't get to the hotel 'll come back here
Price doesn't want her to go alone, but he's not that excited about hiding out in the middle of the city either
Aw, Christ
(frustrated) 've wrecked everything else, at least let me take care of you here
Russell
it's more dangerous being with you than being alone
He knows she's right
He loves her, and he's made enough disastrous decisions lately
He hesitates, then pops open his camera and removes the film
Price ties the film into the white flag that hangs from a stick stuck into her belt
Don't get hurt
(affectionately) That's great advice
They kiss, and Claire runs out after a Red Cross truck
Price watches nervously until they turn a corner, out of sight, then goes back inside Jazy's courtyard ' , stops, stares -- he'd forgotten already
The body makes him uneasy, and after several moments he finds a sheet and covers Jazy
Price then sits down and waits nervously, sharing the courtyard with Jazy
: - as it comes around a corner
The truck turns one direction, she wants to go the other way toward the hotel
--         - Guardia troops heavily patrol the ground between Claire and the hotel -- a jeep, a troop carrier, a tanquetta, and fifty foot soldiers
offered by a - who sees that she is afraid of La Guardia
Claire steps behind a walled yard
Moments later: and turns up the hill toward the Guardia and the hotel
Claire's white flag is tied to his handlebars
as the boy pedals into the military zone
The woman offers Claire some food; she declines
: - slowly, in no hurry, past La Guardia troops
Some of them watch him curiously, some ignore him
The white flag flutters as he rides
: - to the block where Price is hiding in Jazy's house
, a dog sniffs at the bodies
Claire looks around -- there is little sign of life
She enters Jazy's house
: '  - and stops
She calls out his name, no answer
Price is gone
She hurries back outside
: '  - , sirens screaming, loaded with Guardia soldiers
Claire steps into the street unsurely, looking every direction
and what remains of their small homes
They come one at a time at first, then in small groups, carrying belongings, pets, chickens, etc
to a woman who comes out of the house next to Jazy's, but the woman shakes her head, not recognizing Price
-       at the homes
and chaotically flees the destruction, gradually finding a direction out of the city
Claire is swept along in the crowds, at first without choice, then finally fleeing for her life with the rest of Managua
As she moves with the crowd, she looks for Price everywhere, without success
: - burn near the edge of the city where dozens have taken temporary refuge
Claire arrives to see: up outside stairs to a rooftop from which glow several bare bulbs
She goes up the stairs to the rooftop
: - under awnings and palm fronds, capable of moving location in minutes
and two temporary orderlies tend to wounded
small black and white television sits on a table and those who are able watch the seige of Managua on television while it goes on around them
Claire looks for Price among the dead or wounded
-- Claire watches for several moments -- smoke, flame, the buzzing sound of planes swooping low, fleeing crowds
She then notices the television
'   '  comes on the  screen, and she pushes closer to see the grim sequence
The explains in Spanish what we see that she turns away, sickened, hurt, guilty, outraged, but unable to break down
She closes her eyes -- her face is covered with tears
The Doctor notices this and speaks softly to her
Journalist
(Claire nods) You knew the man who was killed
(she nods again) Fifty thousand Nicaraguans have died
and now one Yankee
(beat) Perhaps now Americans will be outraged at what is happening here, eh
It takes a while for Claire to respond
Yes
perhaps they will
Noise in the distance from mortars
The Doctor speaks calmly, without bitterness in the voice, but with total conviction
Maybe we should have killed an American journalist fifty years ago
Claire acknowledges the grim truth of the observation with a slight nod, and walks to the railing as: '        over and over again as the Orderlies, Doctor, and patients gather to watch with fascination
, when her eye catches something -- a light in the sky
She watches: --      , momentarily illuminating the hospital, but it continues on, curiously uninterested in the Guerrilla activity
The chopper sweeps above a nearby hill and hovers, then slowly lowers to earth
with interest then descends the stairs
: - of his parents
An Army helicopter lands, lighting the scene, and Miss Panama rushes from the chopper into his arms as the turbulence from the blades raises her dress and musses his hair
Soldiers place the dirt-covered caskets on the roofs of Somoza's two Mercedes, hastily tie them down, and the strange motorcade, flanked by two heavily armed jeeps, drives off into the dark
from a safe distance, not far from the refugee camp
She turns and walks slowly back to the camp
: - Claire sits down against the remains of a wall
The war has overtaken her -- she doesn't know if Price is alive -- and though totally involved, she is at last an observer once again
Claire notices the tiny red light of her recorder is still on
She turns it off, and as the sounds of battle gradually die down, Claire falls asleep -- exhausted
: - as a dog sniffs and licks her face
She awakens with a start -- the dog scurries away
Claire rises and looks around
carrying the wrapped body of her husband through the otherwise quiet streets of Managua
just coming to life, and looks around trying to interpret the eerie silence
tends to her
(in Spanish) Have you seen La Guardia
(in Spanish) No
Is the war over
(in Spanish) don't know
,
Claire looks around nervously
Tanquettas
Tanquettas
--      coming over the hill in the distance
The Refugees look up fearfully and some hide
As the war machinery gets closer, we see that: draped with red and black (
), blue and white (Nicaraguan), and yellow and white (the Vatican) flags
Graffiti of victory covers the tanquettas
, embracing, only gradually realizing what has happened
(in Spanish) Is the war over
Yes
Es bueno
(It is good
) The woman continues with her children, her comment unemotional, and Claire smiles slightly and walks away, through a city awakening slowly to its victory
and shows the driver her picture of Price
The picture means nothing to the driver
Claire continues through the city, looking for Price
: - where chairs and tables float in the pool, the bar is overturned, and the once sumptuous press oasis is a disaster
: - , also a mess, and hesitates before climbing the circular stairs
' , and finds it empty, and typically messy
-- looking out at the jubilant city from which smoke still rises
, holding onto each other without the slightest intention of letting go
: -  - to the lobby
They are cleaned up in fresh clothes; they have survived and the war is over
with Regis' camera crew, who look like they've had a long night, a  ,  , , and   , 38, with    -- all either sit or mill in the b
g
at what they see
Alex
--        with the name, "
Grazier" scrawled in felt pen
Price and Claire stand next to the box silently -- there is nothing to say -- but the silence is interrupted by a familiar voice that is polite, unforced, and sincere
It was the best  would do under the circumstances
The casket,  mean
Awkward silence until they realize that he's sincere
Can you help us ship it home
've already taken care of it
(beat) always liked the guy
can't even get tickets for my own family, but could get you two on the plane if you want
We see the woman and little girls as Hub's family
Yes, please
Tacho's in Miami
shared silence at the lunacy of the moment, interrupted by the tired voice of one of Hub's daughters
' Daddy
(to Price and Claire) am sorry
had a job to do -- that's all -- it put me in some unhappy situations
Hub goes over to take care of his family
: '   -  - Thousands of people have gathered to celebrate in loud and joyous singing, led by a group on the highest cathedral steps, surrounded by Revolutionary leaders waving to the crowds sings a song to Nicaragua, and a song to Rafael
'      is carried in through the crowd to wild cheering and singing
High over the pallbearers' heads it moves through the crowds
watching it all
The celebration is joyously infectious, and for the moment we can forget the bloodshed, forget the problems that lay ahead, forget even the death of Alex
and begins taking pictures of the celebration
with other Guerrilla leaders
with her mike held high, recording the singing of the crowd
of a stand selling refreshments, and especially Rum and Coke mixtures known suddenly and triumphantly as "Nicalibres
" As Price snaps off pictures -- a voice from an American in casual street clothes drinking at the temporary bar
Hey, Pricey
Price looks over to see the smiling Oates
It's all over, eh
We made it like the singing
What're you doing here
Free country
Now it's free, anyway
(raises his drink) Nicalibre
Oates holds up his Kodak Instamatic camera
How 'bout a quickie
(no response) No
Things are heating up in Thailand
thought 'd check it out
(beat) You ain't gonna turn me in, are ya
Am  gonna see ya in Thailand
We could be friends
Price keeps walking, into the crowd, where he finds Claire
Oates orders another Nicalibre, and beats his foot to the music
We've got a plane to catch
Did you get enough pictures
No answer -- a final complicated question from Claire -- they smile
Price waves for a cab which pulls over
They get in the cab and drive away
