6 Written by Don DeLillo Revised Draft May 18, 2004 -  - 1                                                                 1 , a drama critic, asleep on his bed
He wears a sleep mask
The bed is a mattress on a makeshift platform
Papers strewn on the floor
An exercise bike
desk with and old manual typewriter, reference works, periodicals, Styrofoam cups
cast-off sofa with pants, shirts, sweater, underwear and socks tossed haphazardly on the cushions and arms
counter that sets apart the kitchen area
portable  set on the counter
The remains of dinner for one
row of stacked cardboard boxes with mail spilling out on the floor
Boxes are labeled in crayon:
coffee table with a candle nub in a saucer and six gleaming rounds of ammunition scattered next to a Llama Comanche
357 Magnum with a checkered walnut stock -- overall length, nine and a quarter inches
Port--San toilet, about seven feet high, orange, scarred and dented -- scavenged from a construction site
snapshot on the bedside table
It's a blurry picture of Steven holding a cat
Steven wears a peaked cap, and a shadow falls across his face
Next to the picture is a clock radio, which comes on with a buzz as the clock shows nine
begins to speak -- (
) (softly) Traffic flowing smoothly on the Deegan right now but if you're lucky enough to have a ticket for tonight's game, be sure to leave early because it's going to be bumper to bumper
Steven does not stir
2 teven's loft is in an old squat building on 47th Street near Twelfth Avenue
The structure looks abandoned
Graffiti everywhere
Entranceway filled with debris

(
) Another day of traffic
Traffic everywhere  look
Cars stop and move and stop again
People sit at the wheel thinking their thoughts
- - The shimmering glass facade of the United Nations Plaza Apartments at 48th Street and First Avenue
man visible at a window on one of the high floors, a cup of coffee in his hand
(
) Day in, day out
Red light, green light
Traffic on the major arteries and traffic in the little veins
From his  we see the traffic below creeping along, nearly at a standstill
(
) Cars, vans, taxis, trucks, limos, Mopeds, bikes and buses
Emergency vehicles screaming and wailing
Birth and death, walk and don't walk
The man takes a sip of coffee
(
) Traffic yesterday, today and tomorrow
Bumper to bumper, soul to soul
This is Lone Eagle over and out
47TH     - 4                                                                 4 The same man -- the playwright Nicky Rogan with his hand in the air, hailing a cab
He is forty-five, vigorous, wearing well-made sporty clothes
In a corner of the screen -- 25, 1986 5                                                                 5 Stalled in traffic
used to drive a taxi

Where you're going, mister
Nicky glances at the driver's name plate used to drive a taxi
used to be head of neurosurgery
Big hospital in
This hospital, 'm not kidding
Very big
opened thousands of brains
What did you find
Big mess every time
loved my taxi
Went twelve hours nonstop
Stopped only to pee peed under the Manhattan bridge
Peed many times in parks and playgrounds
6                                                                    6 47th Street and Third Avenue
man is dancing with a life- size cloth doll
His tape player is on the sidewalk, playing and instrumental version of "Beautiful Dreamer" and there is a cigar box for donations
few people look on from a distance
The man wearing an old cutaway, with running shoes, and the doll has long red tresses and wears a frilly gown
Nicky emerges from a taxi at the corner and walks rapidly past the dancing man
Nicky crosses the courtyard to Buchanan Apartments
7                                                                    7 reaching for the door
Joanna is fifty-ish, handsome, stylishly dressed

They are in the hallway clutching each other, stumbling
The walls on either side are hung with expensive art
They grapple past the living room
Fleeting look at the paintings by Longo and Fischl, a poster by the Guerilla Girls
he edge of the bedroom
Nicky is crawling into the room and Joanna is hanging on to him, being dragged
They are fully dressed except for one of Joanna's shoes
The bedroom
Lichtenstein, a Hockney, a silk-screen of Joanna by Andy Warhol
Jeff Koons piece
Nicky and Joanna roll on the floor until they are halfway under the bed
9                                                                   9 Muffled sounds from the bedroom
We track to: The maid's room
The maid is smoking a cigarette and reading New York magazine
The cover is partly obscured by her hand but we can see a blurry black-and-white photo of a man hurrying along a street with a newspaper over his face, shielding himself from the camera
Over the photo, three words visible:    --  second line of type is too small to be legible
-- 10                                                              10 Nicky and Joanna are undressing after the fact, very slowly and distractedly
Joanna stands by a chair near the window
Nicky is on the other side of the bed and he alternates between standing and sitting as he takes off his clothes
Last night
Alan Albright called me a handsome woman
Second time he's done that
Son of a bitch
hear Alan's sick
Alan's very sick
He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution
You know about Adele
What about her
She's dying
She died
talked to her two days ago
Apparently it didn't help
You know about Peter, of course
Our Peter
Peter Redmond
They found out why he can't remember his lines
There's something living in his brain
parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie
Can he get through it
They're watching him closely
There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon
To bolster his confidence
And that's not all
've got bigger problems, Joanna
Personal problems
That's not all, Nicky
've been backing your plays for fifteen years
And 've never been more depressed
About what
teven Schwimmer
The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan
6
(hiding his concern) Look
All  want is a haircut
'm not worried about this guy
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic
There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening
What
The Red Sox You mean the World Series thought the Red Sox were winning
Three games to two
But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making
've been carrying this franchise on my back since  was six years old
It can't be all that personal
Joanna enters the walk-in closet to finish undressing and get a nightdress
If you have a team you've followed all your life, and they raise your hopes and crush them, and lift them and crush them, do you want me to tell you what it's like
It's like feeling your childhood die over and over mean Nicky, really, no
7
Nicky follows her into the closet, still in his shirt and boxer shorts
'm proud of this play
It's so different from anything you've done
This is how we've managed to last
We're able to surprise each other
In and out of bed
Because we're completely mismatched
We don't even like each other, do we
Nicky walks out of the closet, takes off his shirt, gets into bed
used to tell myself
Talent is more erotic when it's wasted
Will see you tonight
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918
You expect me to miss that for an opening night
Joanna emerges from the closet in her nightdress and gets into bed
It makes me so mad
Steven Schwimmer ready to strike
The exterminating angel
It's all worked out
They'll lose tonight
Then they'll lose tomorrow
see it with stunning clarity
8
It's your best play, Nicky
They'll lose because they're my team
He will absolutely hate it
11                                                              11 ' Steven is just waking up
The radio plays soft music
He reaches over and hits the off button, then activates the cassette player
He struggles out of bed and Sufi music begins to fill the room
He stands at the foot of the bed, a man in his mid-twenties, hollow-chested, slightly potbellied, wearing rumpled pajama bottoms and a Mostly Mozart -shirt
He does not remove the sleep mask
The music has a sensuous, driving beat
Voices begin to chant
Steven holds his arms parallel to the floor
Slowly he begins to turn, clockwise
The beat picks up and he whirls more quickly, his mouth coming open
Now he begins to whirl about the room
The chanting grows in intensity
Although he is blindfolded, Steve deftly avoids running into furniture and other objects
Steven stops whirling at the precise moment the music stops playing
He is back at the foot of the bed, arms stretched wide
12                                                              12 Creeping along
Nicky leaning toward the driver
wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil
ate and drove
had one of those big checkered cabs
You are going where
Crosstown
9
Very bad today
Driver's nameplate -- cleaned out the ashtrays religiously
am sitting here five years in traffic
It is one continuous traffic since  arrive
Why must it be
taxi pulls up alongside
Nicky notices the young woman in the rear seat
It is his daughter Laurel
He opens his window
Laurel, stay there
(to his driver) Keep the meter running
And try to stay abreast
Nicky leaves his taxi and gets into Laurel's
13                                                                13 Nicky pushes in next to her
Laurel is eighteen, slightly overweight, with a pleasant and expressive face
She is carrying books in a nylon haversack
never see you anymore
Where are you all day
go to college
thought you knew
Do you want to get some coffee
don't drink coffee, Daddy
And this is not what we should be talking about
10
What do you want to talk about
'll talk about anything
What's this
Nicky lifts a small radio and headset out of her bag
'm seeing your play tonight, remember
Why do you need a radio
So at the intermission  can listen to the ball game
Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer
That's completely crazy
Is it
Don't talk like that
How prominent
What are you implying
She's doing like those Iranians
` divorce thee
divorce thee divorce thee' (indicating driver) And he hears it the same time hear it
What happened to family secrets
Driver's nameplate --- Mother is totally, you know, upset
Abulhassas, we'll be getting out here
11
Nicky pays the driver
14                                                                14 Nicky stands alongside the first taxi and pays his original driver
Laurel reluctantly exits the second taxi
15                                                                15 47th Street between First and Second Avenue
Nicky and Laurel enter the coffee shop they are greeted by the owner, a hefty Greek named
Nicky, you don't come in for a while
Everything's okay
Hello George
You're so healthy and thick-bodied  want to punch you in the chest
This is my daughter Laurel
Just to hear the sound it makes
saw your picture in the paper
Two papers
That means they're getting ready to kill me
That's not what  hear
have four, five actors working here
`His best play since "Yessiree Bob" 'm telling you, they say it
He doesn't want to hear it
He leads them toward a booth
- 16                                                                16 Nicky is launched into a full breakfast
Laurel has a tea bag in a cup -- no water
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent
12
Because they get outstanding settlements
And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back
just had breakfast with her
She didn't say a word about this
young waiter recognizes Nicky and unobtrusively points him out to another waiter
Because you refuse to believe she's serious
You've always refused
Don't be so steely-eyed
It's that course you're taking in criminology
Oh please
Not now
(beat) She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name
Finally
Now and forever
Do you think that's too much to ask
For a wife of nineteen years
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior
It's making you obsessive
She is kicking you out
Your mother and  have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently
Believe me, know this
That's right, nineteen years
And what about the days and minutes
Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child
We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways
Lillian isn't only my wife
She's my best friend
Nicky shrugs
13
Bullshit, Daddy
-     - 17                                                                17 Nicky and Laurel stand on a short line at the cash register, each holding a check
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person
She's embarrassed to tell me
So why don't you tell me
Don't call her Mother all the time
It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving
What happened to Mom
didn't turn her into Mother
You did
This person and  are a thing of the total past
promise you
Nicky takes Laurel's check away from her, intending to pay himself
Laurel snatches it back
Know what Mother said to me
Daddy's demons are so intense he doesn't even know he's lying

The Bank of India, Banco di Napoli, Bear Stearns, the Bank of New York, The Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover
sense of real institutions looming over the busy street
The bank names engraved on bronze markers, carved in granite, incised on glass
Street level
glimpse of the bronze statue called "Taxi on Park Avenue" -- a man with and attache case and raincoat, hailing a cab
The real people hailing cabs, well-dressed men and women striding along with briefcases -- purposeful, successful

It's life, it's taxis
People trying to make contacts, make deals, meet their lovers
Taxis are sexy
You can't have Manhattan without taxis
was proud of my taxi
kept my taxi clean
Nicky shifts his gaze
He sees Elliot Litvak slinking across the street, looking faintly unclean and shows a trace of a smile
He watches Elliot enter the lobby of the Chemical Bank
20                                                             20 Elliot is at a cash machine, making an elaborate transaction
Nicky appears, approaching the adjacent machine
Elliot sees him
Nicky
was thinking about you went to the preview last night
don't want to hear about it
Nicky attends to his own transaction
(whispering) lovely piece of theater
Small but important
Shut up, Elliot
Quietly effective
Nicky takes his cash and begins to move away
We don't appreciate what they've built for us
We're artists who are too dumb to see that this is the peak moment of Western culture
You're an artist
'm a craftsman
15
Press a button and they give us money
Ride with me
We need a haircut
21                                                             21 Stalled between Park and Madison
The driver has opened the door and is standing just outside the cab, trying to determine the cause of delay
(whispering) How is Lillian
haven't seen her
She wants a divorce
Don't talk like that
It's over, finished and done with
That sounds so final
But are we really surprised
'm completely stunned
don't want this to happen
But didn't we know it would happen
Don't needle me, Elliot
Tell me how bad you feel
We're suppose to feel bad together
This is what friends do
(whispering) Joanna Bourne
So rich and crisp
This woman lets you touch her body
You put your hands on her personal parts
Nicky hits Elliot -- a token blow to the arm
Elliot thinks about it, then hits back
16
They swat each other, half kiddingly, each of them leaning away from the other to prevent being hit in the face
22                                                                22 whitish brown mist is building the west
There is a sense of scurrying people

We must abandon
What do you mean, we must abandon
Ruptured steam pipe
Ruptured steam pipe
Asbestos lining
Do not inhale
We must abandon
Contaminated substance
Very dangerous
Shooting mud
Do not inhale
We must abandon
Ruptured steam pipe
Very dangerous
Asbestos lining

Driver's name plate -- Nicky pays him
24                                                             24 The driver flees eastward
Nicky and Elliot run across Madison Avenue
snowstorm of asbestos is shooting out of a man hole cover west of Fifth Avenue, reducing visibility to near zero
Cars and people are white shadows
The two men, with collars raised and hands over heads hurry into a restaurant on 47th Street between Madison and Fifth
- 5                                                             25 small narrow room
Handsome wall paintings -- a Tuscan hill town
Very slow day
Nicky and Elliot sitting with a carafe of wine, a bottle of mineral water and some bread sticks
Glancing at menus intermittently
'm trying to think
When did you start looking so terrible
You look awful
can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute
You used to love life
You don't exude this any more
What do  exude
Suffering
You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer
Tonight
What's tonight
18
Shit
They don't have any carrot soup
You mean because What's-His-Name
You will suffer because he is in the theater
And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears
It's just a review
It is just a review
Do not inhale
Very dangerous
What's the fuss
don't get it
That's what  said eighteen months ago
What happened eighteen months ago
Before his Broadway days
He reviewed the one-act  did at the Fulton Fish Market
We did this play at four , outdoors in the rain
One performance
For the fish handlers
And he was there
Steven Schwimmer
memorized every word of this review
That's awful
recite it to myself with masochistic relish
19
year and a half later
You're still brooding
patron approaches the table and stares at Nicky with a fixed grin of crazed recognition
Yessirree Bob
Yessisree Bob
Nicky's jaw becomes set and he pours himself a glass of wine as the man backs off
You don't know about obscure writers, Nicky
How we have our anger to nurture and love
Our murderous fantasies for any amount of fame, money , power and sex
The waitress comes by
She is Paisley Porter, attractive, in her mid-twenties
Guys ready to order
Paisley Porter
didn't know you were waiting tables
Elliot
(to Nicky) This is a great young out-of-work actress
Elliot Litvak
Have you been ill
And Mr
Rogan
How nice
What's good
We have a very nice pasta today
Alla Putanesca

Nicky is eating compulsively -- in contrast to Elliot, who sips his mineral water, dabs his mouth with a napkin, looks around the restaurant between bites
When Nicky is finished with his food, he begins picking among the items on Elliot's plate
Elliot uses his fork to deflect Nicky's fork and the two men have a brief duel with utensils, fencing silently but intently, using knives and spoons to vary action
7                                                                27 The asbestos mist still clings
Men in protective suits and masks move slowly, like moon walkers
Halted traffic, abandoned cars
Mud covering the sidewalks and shop windows
gauzy stillness, dreamlike
' 28                                                                28 Stillness
slow whirling 360-degree shot
The kitchen area is empty
The door of the portable toilet is open and no one is inside
The makeshift wardrobe is empty except for four or five hangers with shirts and jackets
There is no one at the desk or exercise bike
sound, faint but persistent, like an intake of air
The bathroom
The toilet bowl has been ripped out and taken away, leaving a hole in the floor
Brownish water drips from the tap into the wash basin, which is indelibly stained
The drip makes a two-part sound and it matches the rhythm of the intake of air
One-two
Pause
One-two
The bathtub has been sprayed by a graffiti artist
Multi-colored swirls and arabesques
teven is sitting on a mat in the tub, arms in the air and folded so that his fists are close to his ears
He is in lotus position, breathing in serious meditation -- a deep intake of breath followed by a softer expulsion, matching the beat of the dripping faucet
He is still wearing the sleep mask

Nicky's table has been absorbed by this cluster and he sits reading the sports section in a tabloid and having an espresso with his cigar
Elliot, Paisley and actor-waiter stand at the small bar in conversation
Next to Nicky, two kitchen workers talk about the ball game
got a good feeling about tonight We got Ojeda going
He pitched beautiful last time out
Plus Darryl's due for a big game
hate the Mets
How come
When the Mets lose, they just lose
It's a flat feeling
But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game
Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate
Paisley walks across the room toward the kitchen
Nicky pauses to watch her, then resumes speaking
You can analyze a Red Sox defeat day and night for a month and still uncover layers of complex feelings - - feelings you didn't know you were capable of
The pain has a memory all of it's own
30                                                                30 The parking lot is empty
The stands are empty
few members of the crew move the batting cage into place for batting practice

Uniforms hang on the doors of the lockers in preparation for tonight's game
We see the 3    names Henderson, Stanley, Buckner

Intensely claustrophobic
Elliot at the urinal
Nicky at the hand-dryer
An actor-waiter standing between them at the sink
(quoting Steven Schwimmer) `One thing saves Elliot Litvak's work from complete mediocrity, and this is his lack of ambition
' It gets funnier
(zipping up) It gets funnier
See, Nicky
They chart the laughs
This from a critic who lives like a fallen monk
Whose address is a carefully guarded secret
critic who has to disguise himself
What do you mean
To go to the theater
Wears  don't know what
Make-up, padding
Why
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business
He has to disguise himself, Nicky
For his own safety and peace of mind
23
The waiter squeezes past and leaves
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca
What was it like
said, `'m dead'
He killed me
- 33                                                             33 Elliot standing near the front window, in a shaft of sunlight, examining a white after-dinner candy
He puts it in his pocket for later
aisley eating lunch at the end of the long table, looking up to see Nicky approach with liqueur and a glass on wine
He sits opposite her, placing the wineglass in front of her
You've worked with Elliot
was in the fish-market play
What happened to him
There was a review
think  remember
So does Elliot
Not one of Steven's finer moments
Oh
You know him
little
And he has finer moments now and then
24
He has -- something
funny little quality  find -- Endearing
Engaging
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike
little drastic maybe
Say it again

You know what

Nicky carries the tabloid he'd been reading -- the "Daily News"
Elliot and Nicky stand at the door and watch the whitish mist that continues to linger
Is it safe
Do we care
think we Nought to wait
say we go
You say we go

Do not inhale
'm not ready

Nicky holds the newspaper over his face for protection
Each man has an arm in the air, trying to hail a taxi
They are standing near a trash receptacle that carries an advertisement for "New York Magazine"
It is a reproduction of the cover that we'd glimpsed earlier in Joanna's apartment when her maid was reading the magazine furtive man shielding his face with the newspaper -- and a headline about a Phantom
Nicky and Elliot do not see the receptacle
bus comes down the street with a large horizontal ad covering its right side
It is the same ad -- five of them actually, five "New York Magazine" covers side by side
Elliot is trying to hail a cab and doesn't notice the ad
As the bus bears down, Nicky steps out of the way, removing the newspaper from his face and getting a clear look at the five photos on the side of the bus -- a man concealing his face with a newspaper
Nicky reads the text under the logo of "New York Magazine"
Learning to hate Steven Schwimmer Nicky stares after the bus
Another bus comes along, carrying the same ad
Nicky watches darkly

The driver is speaking Chinese into his two-way radio
Squawky replies from the dispatcher in machine gun Chinese
The man has taken over my mind
He's not only out there
He's in my head and  can't get rid of him can't write a word without imagining his response
'm paralyzed as an artist
don't have the problems that artists have
You've been saying that for years
What
(mockingly) `'m just a professional
dues- playing member of a guild
' Because you're afraid, Nicky
That's the darkest part of you
You don't think you're good enough
Nicky lowers the newspaper
Driver's nameplate: 38                                                                38 About a dozen people gathered together including several diamond merchants in their beards, black suits and fur hats
They are watching the man in the cutaway dancing with his cloth doll
Someone places a donation in the cigar box
From the tape player: "Dancing in the Dark
" Elliot ends up near the Gotham Book Mart, on the north side of the street
Nicky looks right past him into the bookstore window
He sees something that interests him
Where are you going
27
Don't wait Efor me
What about the haircut
39                                                               39 Nicky walks along the main aisle, looking at a woman standing in the poetry nook
Only a few people in the shop
He enters the back room and gets a glimpse of a woman walking through the opposite doorway back into the main room
He squeezes past a browser and looks through the doorway
Someone is just leaving the shop
He walks to the rear of the store, where the office is located
The door is open, the room is empty
He re-enters the main room and sees a woman seated on the top step of the stairway that leads to the basement stacks
Her back is to Nicky and she is reading a book
He approaches slowly and then squats by the doorway to get a closer look at her
She turns
It is Paisley Porter

You keep slipping away
How do you do that
was one of those silent, listening children
Glued to the shadows
was all noise
Played the radio loud
Battled constantly with my brother and sister
Here  am, world
hear good things about the new play
28
So do
Over and over
Peter Redmond is an actor  admire enormously
Would you like to meet him
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue
'm trying to prolong our afternoon
In case you haven't noticed
The fact is,  have to get going
Is it true
Is what true
He wears a disguise
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy
No friends
No phone
But you're his friend
Sort of
Sometimes
You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you
Look
understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play

can't take this anymore
He forgets simple lines
He forgets where to stand
We tell him and tell him and tell him
know he's a sweet man
love Peter
It's not his fault
But 've never worked in a show where the leading man has 4              parasites in his brain

He surveys the set, a working class kitchen, behind it a backdrop of dark streets and looming tennaments portly well-dressed man appears, moving along the row toward Nicky
This is  , the producer
aybe we ought to postpone the opening
Joanna loves this play
She has sunk tons of money
She is completely Ncommitted
appreciate that, Sidney
But our leading man can't remember his lines
And his understudy can't carry the play
Nicky looks out at the rehearsal in progress on stage
The director,   and the actor (50)confer, move about gesturing and blocking
had lunch with Joanna
She said she told you about Peter
You weren't concerned, she said
hat was this morning
30
So what happened since
You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews
Nicky looks across the theatre
Paisley Porter sits alone, tenth row center, watching rehearsal with rapt attention
'm not worried about this kid
Well  am
Worried sick
Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer
He's here to announce the death of civilization
He kills a play every time he farts
Postpone
We have every right
Too late
All the elements are in place
Delay the opening and we lose the theater
've had three straight washouts, Sidney

Jack and Renee approach
feel shaky about one line in particular
If  can get past this line
think  can handle the last long speech
Which line, Peter
The Son says to the Father, This could be it
And the Father replies
That's the line  can't ever, for the life of me remember
just can't get it
It's the same line
The Father simply repeats what the Son says to him
33
This could be it
This could be it
know it sounds easy
But something happens between the time hear the line and the time 'm suppose to Jrepeat it
This could be it
(long pause) This could be it

Do you think he can do it
don't know
He's a very sweet man
Where are you going now
Home
Someone waiting for you
No one's waiting

There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid
Is that our Steven
If 'm sleeping with him, and haven't said  am, then so what
(quietly) So everything
That's so what
So begin to hate him
So  want to do him grave harm
But you don't even know me
How can you care what  do with whom
know you both
Enough
How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things
Yes
Never mind

Come on, Paisley
Our Steven not only disguises himself

He goes to the theater armed

He feels he has to defend himself if necessary

Steven emerges and goes to the stacked cardboard boxes against the wall
His hate mail
He is wearing a bath towel like a prayer shawl over his sweat clothes
He drags one of the boxes to the ratty armchair
He sits in the chair by the filthy window that looks west toward the early-setting sun
He takes a letter from the box, opens it, reads it, lets it fall to the floor
Takes another letter, opens it -- There is a knock at the door
Steven tenses, does not move
Another knock
He moves warily toward the door
(
) Steven, it's me
Will you open please
36
Steven releases the dead-bolt lock and opens the door
You've come to me
wanted to believe you would one day
haven't come to you
But you're here
So you must have come to me

Paisley nervously prowls the loft
In other words  never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews
Steven, it's so unfair
Of course it's unfair
The truth is always unfair
Why do you think live this way
Hiding out
Stealing electricity from a lamp post
Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society
can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox
They'd come after me in packs
Not if you stopped hurting people
Write the truth gently
The truth is never gentle
Listen to me carefully
Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams
Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin
It hurts and maims
reaching down to clutch a fistful of letters) Look how they hate me for telling the truth
It's an education, Paisley

Cries of revenge

One past and one future

And  thought, at last, she's here, she wants me

Paisley moves towards the door
Stay
Teach me to be compassionate
'm going home to my machine

He crosses the street toward her
hen Paisley sees him, she seems to freeze

Nicky walking slowly backwards, arm raised, trying to hail a cab
It is getting dark
He glances left, sees a large two- panel poster in front of the theater
One half is a black-and- white photo -- a younger Nicky Rogan, in a tuxedo, holding an award in his raised hand
The other half is all type -- The new Nicky ogan He sees someone enter the theater lobby
It is his daughter Laurel
He follows, catching up to her at the end of a short line of people at the ticket window
Laurel
Tickets are all set double-checked
38
Thanks, Daddy
But  just need one
Mother's not going
Opening night
know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition
Laurel reaches the window and speaks to the clerk
Rogan, Laurel
You also have a Rogan, Lillian
She won't need it
Sell it
Take it yourself
Take a date
don't have a date
don't want a date
They leave the window with Laurel's ticket
And you blame me
It's because we never talk
Let's talk
have a class
'm late
Can we talk later
Will you be at the party
'm not sure
She is out the door, hurrying across the street
Nicky stands under the marquee, calling out to her
'll find you
After the show

Nicky comes on Sunday's

Nicky stands by the boxlike refrigerator, drinking a beer
This is the kitchen that is the centerpiece of the theatre set
The new play is Nicky's young life
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is
How did we do it
Five people in these little rooms
Get yourself something to eat
Nicky takes some eggs out of the refrigerator
We must have been heroic
Five's not so many
There were families with seven kids grandmother

Lillian says it once a week
`Why doesn't he come live with us
' You know the answer to that
do know the answer to that
Why don't we watch the ball game later
We'll go to Mannion's
They're only gonna lose

Of course they're gonna lose
We'll watch them lose
What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand
The Red Sox are your problem never understood about you and the Red Sox
Everybody rooted for the Yankees
Nicky is scrambling the eggs
Remember 1949
Last two games of the season
Against the Yankees
The Sox lost on Saturday
Then they lost on Sunday
First  cried for twenty-four hours
Then  had fist- fights the rest of the week
It's one thing for kids
You get older, you Nhave other things
It's all connected, Pop
It's one life
Baseball is memory
How do fathers and sons show their love
They go to a ball game together
Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember
But the son is suppose to stop crying

Nicky sees his father's glasses on a shelf above the stove
He puts them on the table
You'll need these
Tonight
For the play
Don't make me sit through one of your plays
43
Hey, Pop
know you don't like the commotion of opening night
But especially want you to see this play
It's new territory for me
And for you too
have to know what you think
Since when did that matter
Let's not start that again
My back is killing me
Where's your elastic brace
can't find it
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble
lost it
lose everything
'll go get you another one
You have to wear it
Nicky takes a roll off the counter, makes a sandwich for his scrambled eggs, takes a bite and heads for the door
Be right back
Take a good look at me
Michael puts on his glasses
So  know who 'm letting in
Nicky leaves the apartment

Michael sits at the end of the sofa, weary
Nicky is taking an athletic bandage -- about four feet long and three inches wide -- out of the package
He sits in a chair that is set perpendicular to Michael's end of the sofa, so that Nicky is looking at his father in profile
`Why doesn't he come live with us
' Because everything is here
know, Pop
'm lucky they don't knock down the building
It could happen anytime
And everything worth remembering is right here
think the building's okay
At least for the time being
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here
You wanted to get out so fast  thought you were running a marathon
Normal boy's ambition
like coming back
You know that
You tell your friends your father used to work the docks
Callused hands
But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand
Nicky is gradually unbuttoning his father's shirt so that he can wrap the bandage around the old man's chest and back
45
was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes
Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big
But 'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly
That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight
There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart
And that's us
Who we were and where we come from
So what are you going to do about it
What do you want me to do
Show him who we are
Nicky takes off the shirt
Michael struggles out of his -shirt and we see that he is wearing the elastic bandage he thought he had lost
He is sitting with his head tilted up, eyes closed, and is unaware that he is wearing the bandage
Nicky takes the new bandage, winds it tightly and puts it back in the box
His father has gone to sleep

Elliot pulls up a customer's chair and sits with his back to the mirror, more or less facing Nicky
The barber, an elderly hawk-eyed man named Dodgie, begins his preparations for Nicky's haircut
He carries a gun
46
Then you should carry a gun
He places the sheet over Nicky's upper body and fastens it at the neck
used to carry a gun when  drove a cab
Where is it
gave it away
thought, 'm a writer now
That was a big mistake
You should never be without a gun
In this city
If he carries a gun, you have to carry a gun
We're making too much of this
No, we're not
'm not a lonely spooky writer like you
Nursing a hundred grudges
'm a man who loves life
We're talking about something deeper than grudges
How do we respond to personal attack
In this city
And you don't carry a gun
How do we maintain our dignity and self-respect
47
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse
The man is out there ruining lives
It's your best play, Nicky
He'll hate it
He'll kill it
He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief
What happens to your apartment on the East River
Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow
Dodgie goes to the cabinet on which the cash register sits
He opens the cabinet door, slides out a drawer and removes some hand towels
There is something there he wants Nicky to see
An old pockmarked revolver
Nicky sees the gun
We were thinking of putting in a pool

What
There are things that speak to us from the past

About an hour and a half ago
saw her come out of a place
She said she was visiting a friend
But she wouldn't tell me who
Had to be him
She was very evasive
Nicky gets out of the chair
Dodgie removes the sheet for him and Elliot smooths down his clothes and hair, like a pair of grooms attending a warrior
Nicky goes to the cabinet, gets the gun
He returns to the chair
'm enjoying this more every minute

Elliot takes an after-dinner candy out of his pocket -- the candy he pocketed in the Italian restaurant after lunch
He blows the lint off and eats it

Put your face in the mirror

Everybody else does
Why not you
You're Frankie Lazzaro
The gangster from Rhode Island
Oh yeah

Matthew, look at him
When  lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere
He was bigger than ten movie stars
(to Nicky) Where's your white Lincoln limo
Nicky is delighted at the mistake and alters his voice slightly, using a gangsterish inflection
(to Matthew) Some little kid stole the hubcaps
The most charming gangster in New England
Where are we going, Mr
Lazzaro
Call me Frankie
And it looks like we're going nowhere
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway
How come you got the kid with you
Matthew's my grandson
grandmother
God bless you
He does bless me, each and every day
Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so  pick him up at school
We stop for a meal usually around this time
He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people
But we never had a famous mobster before
It's the kid's lucky day
This is one charming crook
If shooting people is charming

Now that's a complicated subject
That's a simple subject
Look, we're stuck here front and back
It's dinnertime for you, game time for me
Let's park the cab and go to Mannion's
What do you say, Matthew
We'll drink beer and talk baseball

The place is crowded, a neighborhood tavern
Near the door: Nicky embracing the owner, a beefy man named Georgie
People coming and going

What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you

Raucous noise
waiter with a tray of food standing transfixed, watching the game
Nicky is now sitting next to Matthew and they are watching the game
What's it like to shoot somebody
respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi
But let's put a lid on the questions
Go on, tell him
Tell the truth
Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy
Somebody's flesh who was innocent once
It's complicated
It's a whole life
person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere
There are strong forces at work

He has finished his dinner and is eating from Toyota's plate finishing and watching the game
You're a family man, Frankie
Wife and daughter
My father's still alive

(cont'd) He outlives me, starting tonight
Because the Mets just tied the score
It was only a matter of time, wasn't it
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do
don't know Toyota
What does he do
And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him
Despite who he is and what he does for a living
We're always saying we want to take control of our lives
You don't want to take control
You want to lose control

Nicky is standing again but he's not looking at the  screen this time
His gaze is directed at someone who has just entered the tavern

Moving soundlessly in slow motion, Buckner fields the bouncing ball and heads toward the bag
He beats Wilson to the base by an eyelash and the inning ends with the teams tied at 5-5
Frozen moment: Buckner holding his glove hand aloft, the ball securely gripped
In the drama of the moment, Buckner seems to be crying out a word or name, but his face is twisted with tension and exertion and we can't make out what he is saying

She turns off the radio, removes the headset and rises

She appears to be the only person in the theater
She moves trudgingly up the aisle toward the exit
At the head of the aisle she is startled by a figure standing in dimness
It is Steven Schwimmer

Al three men in the stall, wrestling
Nicky has one foot in the bowl as someone's elbow strikes the handles and the toilet flushes
'    -    -   103 103 The crowd is slowly breaking up
few people still clustered near the  sets, which are showing replays
Nicky is standing alone near a small set at the back on the room
His clothing torn and stained
One shoe and pants leg dripping wet
bruise on his forehead
He is watching a replay
Wilson hits the ball
It bounces twice, then goes under Buckner's glove
Knight scores from the third with the winning run
6-5 victory for the Mets
The main light in the tavern goes out
The  sets keep replaying Buckner's error
Regular speed, slow motion, color, black and white
74
Nicky stands in the darkness, brooding
104                                                               104 The condemned building where Steven Schwimmer lives
The street is deserted
105                                                               105 ' Steven and Laurel on the sofa
He is unbuttoning her blouse
Two sources of light
candle on the coffee table
The small set on the counter -- showing a newscast, with sound turned off
Why won't you tell me your name
It's only our first date
Steven undoes the last button
'm willing to tell you my name
Names are incredibly intimate
We barely know each other
Trust me on this
She decides she will trust him
They kiss softly
You have to tell me what you thought of the play
First you tell me
Brilliantly moving
She begins to remove his jacket
What else
Packs an emotional wallop
What else
75
flat-out hit
Together they get his jacket off
Are you majoring in theater criticism
Laurel sees the shoulder holster and gun
Criminology
They kiss passionately
If you're wondering about the firearm
Yes
This building is not secure
They are all over the sofa, working on the removal of Steven's shirt
106                                                            106 Nicky makes his way past the debris
The front door is gone, the inner door smashed and battered -- door knobs gone and locking mechanism ripped out
He starts up the stairs past a dead or sleeping body
107                                                            107 On the sofa, Laurel is straddling Steven, whose shirt is almost completely off, exposing his bulletproof vest
Laurel is blouseless and barefoot, with her unzipped skirt still on and her bra dangling from one shoulder
have this thing where  have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know,  can feel completely free to be myself
76
We're strangers in the night
The last thing we want is honesty
What do we want
Mystery
Deception
Deception isn't something personally consider sexy
What's sexy
Knowing who a person is
Down deep
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking
You won't even tell me your name
What's shocking about a name
Steven maneuvers himself into a sitting position so that he and Laurel face each other at equal height and at close quarters
Even if the truth requires a certain adjustment
Steven begins removing the cosmetic putty around his naturally shallow chin
He uses Laurel's hair clip to scrape his jaw clean
Then he peels off his fake mustache
And borrows Laurel's dangling bra cup to wipe the bronzing agent off his face
108                                                            108 Nicky stands with his back to Steven's door
His gun is out
He holds it up near his face, muzzle pointed up
He looks at the gun as if it had feelings and personality, and he speaks to it as to a sympathetic friend
used to go to the movies all the time
() 77
(cont'd) saw a hundred situations like this
man and a gun -- and a locked door
Lee Marvin or Steve McQueen
And  used to say to Lillian because we went to a hundred movies that we saw together or that  saw because she had seen them, and 'd say, `Watch him kick in the door with one kick,' And it might be Steve McQueen or Jeff Chandler, holding the gun up like this, and he would turn and kick the door and it would fly open at once, and  would say to Lillian, `How completely phony
Whoever made this movie has no idea how hard it is to kick in an actual door in real life
'  still love Lillian
But it's not easy to kick in a door
knew they would lose and they lost, so what are we so upset about
They lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow
It's written on the wind
09                                                            109 Laurel is on her feet, backing away slightly
Steven removed his shoes and stands in his stocking feet, noticeably shorter than he'd been earlier
He begins to unstrap the bulletproof vest, causing Laurel to retreat further
110                                                            110 These wives named Lillian
used to say to her, `You don't kick a door once or twice and expect it to open
It's only in the movies a man can kick in a door with such amazing ease
Because a real door requires a tremendous and prolonged pounding before it finally gives way
' He's a great player
how could that ball go through his legs
Nicky turns, steps back and kicks the door
It opens at once
78
111                                                              111 Steven and Laurel are briefly immobilized by shock as the door comes flying open
Nicky moves toward the candle-lit couple
Laurel realizes who he is and stands by the sofa
She zips her skirt
Nicky is trying to understand what he sees, then he gets it
(quiet) Laurel
Nicky holds his gun hand aloft, repeating the image of Bill Buckner with the baseball in his glove -- Nicky's hallucination
Then Nicky issues a cry, a sound from the time before humans acquired language
It is the audible anguish of his life, from the fetus onward
We hear what he is saying in overlapping echoes and we realize he is crying out a name
We recognize the look on his face and the formation of syllables on his lips as elements we'd seen earlier -- on Buckner's face when he shouted something as he made the "third out" of the tenth inning
Ste-vennnn Schwim-merrrr
Laurel reacts with horror to the revelation of Steven's identity
She rearranges her bra
Nicky stumbles, drops his gun
It goes off
Steven flees toward the shadows at the back of the loft, his hand moving toward the gun in his shoulder holster
Nicky picks up his gun and begins to stalk him
Steven fires twice striking a nearby lamp
The room is dark now
Lit only by the blue glow of the
The  sports roundup, which has been showing football highlights, has switched to baseball -- highlights of the Red Sox-Mets
Nicky reaches Laurel
79
(crying out) This is my daughterrrrr
Steven is wide-eyed at the news
don't think he knew, Daddy
Nicky sees the photo of Steven and his cat
He shoots twice, blows it away
Daddy, 'm sorry
But he was so beautiful
trusted him
When saw what he really looks like -- voice from shadows: () Am  really so deeply repugnant
Yes
Go home, Laurel
Tell your mother will be late
Nicky walks toward Steven's voice, toward the shadows
You're going to die
You're a dead man
You're dead
He notices Laurel following behind him
Look
'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men
But you're only eighteen
We can still turn it around
Except  won't have a father anymore
'll see you all the time
'll get a place right nearby
One room
No distractions
We'll talk
80
He shouts into the darkness
'
Laurel puts her hand on his shoulder
What will we talk about
Everything
Nicky sees one of the New York Magazine ads, Steven Schwimmer's face mounted on the cardboard
He fires three times, wiping out Schwimmer's eyes
Will  believe you when you tell me something
There's nothing left for me to lie about
Nicky starts into the darkness only to see Steven emerge from the shadows, his gun lowered
Oddly, he seems distracted by something on another part of the room
He is looking at the set on the counter
Nicky watches him approach the kitchen area
He follows, gun raised
Steven sits on a stool to watch
Nicky approaches warily, his gun aimed at Steven's head, which is blue-lit by the  screen
You're dead
see you on a morgue slab drained of all fluids
Laurel follows at a distance to see what they're so interested in
Nicky puts the gun muzzle flush against Steven's temple
see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor
81
(whispering) Daddy, wait
Steven is watching slow-motion footage of Bill Buckner missing the slow roller
Then they lost
Why does it matter
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow
It's all over
Why do you care
They're my team
No
They're not your team
They're my team
Nicky cocks the hammer
They're my team, too
grew up on Boyleston Street
Right by Fenway Park
went to fifty or sixty games a year
All by myself
was one of those kids with scabby elbows
called out to the players
`Look over here
Hi, 'm Steven
My parents are divorced
' went to college in Boston so could be near the Red Sox
took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game
My wife is from Boston
Lillian Ziegler
The Red Sox were my world surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one
82
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game
Answer carefully
This is important
You could have gone to the theater last night
There was no game last night
Because  can't bear to watch
When they lose,  die inside
It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies
wait for the scores
still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second
can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning
've done it too many times
And can't do it anymore
Nicky lowers the gun
was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first
That's when  knew the Red Sox were my team
Pity and terror
When  traveled through Asia this summer,  went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so  could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores
drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates
What about my play
Yes
And no more evasive tactics
It's your best play, Nicky
See, Daddy
83
've seen it twice
went back tonight to be sure
It's a brave and honest piece of work
What else
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand
You're out of bullets
Nicky points the gun at the palm of his own left hand and pulls the trigger
click
See, Daddy
And Peter Redmond helped immensely
These pauses were exquisitely timed
He made us wait and wait
He built a gorgeous tension and suspense
We worked very hard on the pauses
Nicky places it on the counter
called Sports Phone from Lhasa, Tibet
Freezing in my little rented Fiat
Sheep on a hillside
Rocky debris dating back millions and millions of years, from the time the Himalayas thrust up when the plates of India and Asia collided
Red Sox 3, White Sox 2
moment in the history of the world
Nicky takes Steven's head and moves it tenderly against his chest
When Nicky releases the head, he has Steven's toupee in his hand
He looks at it briefly, then hands it to Laurel
84
48TH 112                                                               112 yellow taxi comes speeding past, moving eastward on 48th Street
We see it from various perspectives and elevations
It is a large checkered cab, the only thing moving in the night
Steam comes billowing from funnel vents
The taxi catches every light just before it turns red
113                                                               113 Nicky is driving, his face showing intense satisfaction
Laurel sits next to him
Driver's name plate --- The driver sits in the middle of the rear seat, looking somewhat nervous
Faster, Daddy
48TH 114                                                               114 The taxi crosses Park Avenue, speeding past the bronze statue of a man hailing a cab
It approaches First Avenue, where a road divider bisects the thoroughfare
Nicky swings into a sharp turns, barely averting contact with the divider, and stops abruptly
Three doors open
On the empty street, Nicky hands the driver a wad of bills
Then he and Laurel step over the divider
He puts his arm around her shoulders and they cross the avenue to the glass tower where they live
The sun begins to climb out of the East River
