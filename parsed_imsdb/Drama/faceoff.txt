/ Written by Mike Werb & Michael Colleary Revised 9/10/96 : - of a pig chasing a lion chasing a dinosaur chasing an elephant
Noah's Ark going round
and round
and round
- Disjointed   as the wheel of fate and fortune goes around until we   to reveal: (30) rising winged Pegasus
On the adjacent unicorn is his son  (5)
Clutching a balloon, Matty waves at his dad
happy moment, like so many certain to follow -- until we realize we are watching them
'   - ' wait until the child clears his aim -- Archer is the target
They round the bend and disappear
Loses his grip on the unicorn
Archer reaches over and pulls him into his lap
They happily ride together
As the horses sweep back
exposing Archer
Now we see the sniper
is cool, efficient, aggressive, sexual
His finger closes around the trigger
into Archer's back
Bleeding
he drops off his horse
and sinks to the deck of the carousel
His eyes desperately searching
searching
searching
until he sees -- Matthew lies on his back -- still
Slowly, Archer reaches out and takes Matthew's hand
and now we see for the first time
Blood red
as bleeding father touches bleeding son
the winged Pegasus flying by -- now in full color and     Matthew's red balloon
floating away
'   a   : Gazing out the window as dawn breaks over the city below is Jon Archer
older
unshaven
fatigued
his eyes reveal a man in the grip of obsession
sweeps by, as if marking time itself
Smoky, spiritual
dominated by a gleaming, golden cross
priest kneels before it -- deep in prayer
The glimmering cross comes
but it's just a light-reflection
off the casing of a large bomb
This is no chapel
but an atrium
Somewhere
And as the "priest" rubs out his cigarette we see it's Castor Troy -- carefully installing this complex device
sweeps by
pockets his  badge, then holsters his gun
sets the bomb timer -- then replaces a wall panel in front of it
Totally hidden
- ' is on a computer screen
His criminal dossier scrolls by endlessly:  bombings, assassinations, mercenary kidnappings, terrorism-for-hire
Rookie agent  studies the details carefully
Other agents -- including  and  scan computer grid- maps, man phones, etc
amid the take-out cartons and coffee cups
These people are on high alert
Any follow-up from
Intelligence
No, sir, nothing yet
Get them on the phone -- now
What about
and our airport teams
We've had everything from psychics to satellites on this
Even if Castor was here
he must have slipped the net by now
He's here
And we're going to keep looking until we find him
silence descends on the chastised team
As they go back to work, veteran agent   takes Archer aside
Jon, these people have been working round the clock -- you gotta cut them some slack
Archer considers his best friend's advice -- then
'll cut them some slack when cut myself some slack
Archer marches out -- slamming the door behind him
-  () Castor quietly shuts the security door behind him
An Hispanic voice startles him
What are you doing
(in perfect Spanish) Thank goodness,  feel like Icarus in the labyrinth -- where's the men's room
(in Spanish) This area is off limits, Padre
(re:  security door) How did you get in that room
Realizing the  is already too suspicious, Castor puts a priestly arm around him -- and leads him down the hall
Okay
have a confession to make, but you aren't gonna like it
was planting a bomb
Bomb
You know -- boom -- (patting his neck) Oh, never mind
The Janitor suddenly twitches, his eyes rolls up in his head
As he gasps his last -- Castor heaves him down a stairwell
Now we see the needle-thin custom stiletto in Castor's hand
Castor kicks the Janitor's mop and bucket down the stairs -- making everything look like an accident
-   -  () The children's church choir -- 200 strong -- sing "Behold the Lamb of God
"  Clergy and lay persons listen reverently
"Father" Castor strolls by the singers -- casually heading for the exit
As he passes the risers, a teenage girl drops her sheet music at his feet
Returning it -- he whispers in her ear -- so close he's practically licking it
've never enjoyed 'The Messiah
' But your voice makes even a hack like Handel seem like a genius
He pats her behind and leaves
Although a little shaken, she's also drawn by Castor's sexual magnetism
-  () The marquee proclaims:     18th- 21st:
Castor exits -- politely holding the door for a beat cop
'  -  () The office is a monument to obsession:  photographs, clues, newsclips, totems of Castor Troy surround a pacing Archer
(on phone) don't have time to get a warrant from some hung-over judge
Just give me the go-ahead, Victor, and  promise -- as soon as this is over -- you can brand my butt with the Fourth Amendment
The instant Archer hangs up -- the
(
) Sir, your wife's on line one
on two
Tell her to hang on -- As Archer punches up line two -- Tito bursts in
jet was chartered at Anderson Airfield
Guess who just showed up to pay for it
Pollux Troy
Scramble the Reaction Team -- we're moving out
And get one of our people on that plane
But there's still no sign of Castor
Where one brother goes, the other's sure to follow
They rush our
the hold button on line 1 still blinking
-  - sleek Cadillac pulls in
stopping next to a Land Rover
-- a muscular, crystal-eyed jar-head -- gets out of the Caddy
An instant later --   -- emerges from the Rover
They are identical twins
The men scan the airport carefully, then open the rear doors of their respective vehicles
Castor emerges from the Caddy -- Armani clad
Exiting the Rover is Castor's younger brother -- skittish, brilliant, paranoid -- a human hummingbird
You're 26 minutes late
The casing didn't fit -- right knew that cheap-shit Dietrich would rip us off
Oh, God --
What
forgot to turn the damn thing on
You're kidding, right
(to the twins) He's kidding
(grabs Castor by throat) are you fucking kidding
Castor hugs Pollux lovingly
Pollux squirms like a kid
Bro -- everything went fine
hate when you call me bro
Pollux heads for the jet
Castor hands Lunt a wad of cash
Thanks for babysitting
Anything else
'll contact you when we get the rest of the money
(turns to leave) Oh, and stat away from downtown
The inversion layer's going to be pretty thick around the 18th
The twins nod
then take off
Castor heads for the jet
- Castor hustles in -- exhorting the
Let's go, let's go
As the   start to , Castor sinks into his seat
very sexy   appears and hands him a Scotch
He downs it, looking her over salaciously
Would you like anything else
Hell, yes
(pulls her into lap) It's the only way to fly
She smiles, not minding, until the jet suddenly slows its taxi down the runway
Castor yanks open the door
What's wrong
squat car creeps   -- blocking the runway
/
-  - Behind the wheel is Jon Archer
Beside him is Tito
It's Archer
(gun to Pilot's head) Go, dammit
Suddenly the gun is  from Castor's hand
he turns around to see
the Flight Attendant behind them -- holding a smoking pistol
This is Agent
Throttle down, captain
But Castor elbows the throttle up
The jet lurches forward, throwing Winters off balance
Pollux tackles her as the jet picks up speed
- Archer slams the vehicle into gear
Get out
You're not playing chicken with two tons of aluminum
Get out
Tito obeys as Archer peels out
The   at the jet
The jet picks up speed, trying to get aloft
The humvee is aimed right at it
Archer's eyes narrow
as two hunks of metal bear down
The machines are seconds apart when -- Archer looks up to see
Winters' face pressed up against the cockpit window, Castor holding a gun to her head
Archer cuts the wheel -- just avoiding the jet
The Hummer skids to a stop as Federal back-up arrives -- but too late
Archer watches an  chopper -- landing in a swirl of dust
As the jet picks up speed
the hatch opens
Castor blasts Winters in the side and tosses her onto the tarmac
Castor smiles at Pollux, sensing freedom, until
-:  Something  the jet -- from above
Castor leans out the hatch and sees
The chopper on top of them -- Archer at the controls
Eye-contact -- years of hatred pass between these men
Castor  at him from the open hatch
The chopper's left windscreen spiderwebs
Archer jerks and weaves -- dodging the
The chopper pulls away
The jet finally lifts off
when
The chopper settles on the jet -- slamming at its tail
Tito reacts to this madness -- as the chopper plays a deadly game of leap-frog with the jet
The end of the runway is coming up fast
Archer crushes the jet's horizontal elevator flap
can't budge the jet's jammed yoke
Thwarted, he powers back the throttle
Thrust reverse
What are you doing
The horizontal elevator's smashed
We can't lift off
the Pilot -- then takes the controls
He struggles to maneuver the jet
Suddenly
biplane descends right at them -- about to land
pulls up just as the  swerves radically to avoid the biplane and  into the hangar
plows through the  , the -  off
The   right into the hangar -- finally stopping at the wings
lands
Archer steps out calmly -- like a cop about to write a traffic ticket
He hurries to join more agents rushing into the hangar ahead of him
- The jet hatch pops open -- Castor leaps from it,
Two  agents drop -- riddled
Pollux appears at the hatch -- an  sharpshooter , grazing Pollux's shoulder
Staggered, Pollux falls -- Castor catches him before he hits the floor -- simultaneously  the sharpshooter
Castor drags Pollux back into the smoke-filled hangar
Archer arrives and quickly checks the dead agents, his anger building
He signals Tito and the others to spread out
maze of airplane debris and heavy machinery
Led by Archer, the  agents pick their way through it
snaps alert -- did he see something
Advancing carefully, he comes up on
Castor -- staunching Pollux's shoulder wound
Pollux sees the agent -- and
Loomis hits the floor -- his bleeding ear is shredded
Suddenly a forklift charges down on Castor and Pollux
Tito is at the wheel
Castor  -- forcing Tito to dive off
The forklift careens on -- driving apart the brothers
The forklift upends a stack of heavy crates -- pinning Pollux
Castor tries to free his trapped brother
Forget it -- Go
Go
He slaps his Glock into Pollux's hand
Wherever they put you, 'll find a way to get you out
Pollux starts  -- covering Castor as he runs through a tunnel which leads to an adjoining hangar
Suddenly Wanda presses her machine-pistol into Pollux's head
As Pollux raises his gun -- Tito grabs his hand
-- not unless you want that 200 splattered all over the floor
(as Archer approaches) We got him now, Jon
That's what you always say
Seal it off
'm going in
Archer moves away from the group and enters the tunnel
as Archer and Castor begin their cat-and-mouse dance
Sensing Archer, Castor pauses by an old landing gear
He draws a fresh pistol from his ankle holster and moves on
Archer pauses at the landing gear
his own stealthy movements mirroring Castor's
Castor waits behind a stack of steel drums
his gaze trying to penetrate the darkness
He  his fingers
The sound  as he tries to draw Archer in
Archer reacts to the sound and  back -- answering the challenge
As the deadly beat between them continues -- Archer spins away just as Castor from the gloom
one step ahead
as necessary: Jon, 'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun
And how much will your 'fun' net you this time
Half-blind  send Castor spinning
moment later, Archer pursues
He fits a new into his pistol
What's it to you
declare it
Here  am, back in the States for less than a week -- You're under arrest
Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent -- 've got something going down on the eighteenth
it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaoh
'll give it up -- but my brother and  have to walk
No discussion -- no deals
What're you gonna do with me locked up
You'll drive your wife and kid nuts
bet your daughter is just about ripe by now
What's her name, Janie
Enraged, Archer steps boldly forward -- trying to draw his enemy out
Silence -- then Archer senses
Castor is behind him
He  -- Archer dives away
The   -- driving Archer back between two huge turbine engines
As Archer reloads, he stares at the control panel switches
Castor moves in for the kill when he hears a final - Except it isn't a finger snap
it's two switches
The    on
Unable to fight the churning tornado-force wind
Castor's blasted across the hangar
slamming hard into the far wall
The   and Archer emerges -- joined by Tito
Tell me he didn't get away again
Then Tito follows Archer's gaze to Castor's lifeless body
Still as death -- somehow his mocking smile survives
- Heavily-manacled, an extremely agitated Pollux is herded into a  van by Buzz and Wanda
Where's my brother
want to see my brother
The van takes off -- passing an imposing older man, flanked by two bodyguards
Bullying through the media, Assistant  Director   scans the devastation
Approaching Archer, he watches as Castor's body is loaded on the ambulance
sheet covers Castor's lifeless face
The oversight committee would've roasted us for this one -- thank God it paid off
Damn fine work
Real fine, Victor
Especially the casualties
Archer contemplates the slain agents -- their three bodies laid out in a row -- waiting to be zip-locked
Lazarro reacts grimly as a reporter snaps a photo of the bodies
Instinctively, the two men close ranks
Archer grabs the Nikon, ejects the film, then shoves the camera back
Classified information
No photographs
Lazarro puts a caring arm around Archer's shoulder and leads him away from the media
and the carnage
You okay, Jon
(off Archer's nod) Then go home
Tell Eve
'  ( ) - renovated Craftsman
Sipping a carton of milk, Archer pulls into the driveway
He sits, gathering his thoughts
'  - Archer enters and sees his wife
Handsome, intelligent
Hi
(no response) What's wrong
She nods toward the
is there -- a sullen and hard fifteen-year-old
There are cigarette cartons on the table
She complimented for her '' in history with an '' in shoplifting
Archer marches into the kitchen -- noting the crate of Marlboros
Jamie matter-of-factly pours herself coffee
Nice stunt, Jamie
You break the law and 'm expected to ignore it
That's right -- it's all about you
Don't even ask me what happened
Archer looks to Eve for help
Eve shakes her head -- nope
Okay
What happened
Like you'd ever fucking believe me
She bolts
In anticipation, Eve calmly opens the door as Jamie rushes out, then closes it behind her
Well, you tried
You failed miserably, but you tried
Why won't she even talk to me
Maybe because you taught her never to speak to strangers
(immediately regrets it) 'm sorry
that wasn't fair
Eve kisses his cheek -- then gathers up her doctor gear
've got patients waiting
Try again, Jon
She hates you -- but she needs you
Eve
Something in Archer's expression makes her stop
Jon -- what is it
But he's too overcome
He starts to speak -- but can't
Is it -- him
It's
it's over
Emotions avalanche across his face until he finally looks up
Eve pulls him close -- a sheltering embrace for them both
'm going to make everything up to you and Jamie
'll put in for a desk job
We'll go away, get counseling -- anything you want
This time,  mean it
- Freshly dressed, Archer heads down the hall
He pauses at the door to Jamie's room when he sees -- Jamie
Fully clothed, she's fast asleep on her bed cluttered with clothes and assorted girl-stuff
Her face peaceful
Archer looks around her room
sees the stuffed animals collecting dust
replaced by makeup, jewelry, beefcake Calvin Klein ads and band posters, etc
Archer's startled to see a lacey bustier
his little girl is growing up fast
And he's missing it
He pulls the blanket up over her and quietly slips out
The instant he leaves, Jamie kicks the blankets off
- Dominated by the  seal
Archer steps to the check point
Print, please
Archer presses his thumb to a scan-pad -- and is cleared
- Efficient as a beehive -- agents, cryptologists, support staff buzz at their routines
Archer strides through -- drawing congratulatory nods and "thumbs up" signs
Archer's team is there
Applauding
Proud
Uneasy with plaudits, he disperses the disappointed agents
Much appreciated
Now let's get back to work, okay
(to Buzz) Is that stick ever gonna fall out of his ass
Archer's well-built secretary --   -- hands him his messages
She's holding a bottle of Dom Perignon
The
sent this over
What should  do with it
Send it back and tell them to stop wasting the taxpayers' money
Anything else, Miss Brewster
No, sir
He enters his office
Kimberly sighs and turns to Wanda
Four years -- and he still calls me 'Miss Brewster
' '  - Sitting at his computer -- Archer scrolls through Castor's file
He grimly contemplates face-after-face of Troy's victims -- finally pausing on a photo of his son Matthew
Burying his feeling, he types " " over Castor's image
Archer starts to press "enter" when Tito comes in
How's Loomis
He needs some surgery, but he's going to be okay
That's the good news
Go on
Brodie and Miller from Special Ops need to see you
don't have time for those cloak and dagger guys
Big   and athletic female   stroll in
You better make time, Jon
(hefts a disc) We found this in the jet wreckage -- among Pollux Troy's effects
Archer accedes as Miller pops in the disk
The computer screen displays a  schematic of the bomb
Archer studies it carefully -- unease growing
Porcelain casing
Thermal cloak
Undetectable payload
Powerful enough to flatten ten city blocks
'Worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs
' (to Tito) Get Pollux Troy
Now
: Wired to a complex machine -- Pollux seems to have his frustrated interrogators on the run
'  - Archer, Lazarro, Tito, Brodie, Miller and other officials watch the monitor
Pollux remains implacable (
) (on screen) That bomb was just a crossword puzzle to me
a mental exercise
never built it
Lazarro shuts down the monitor
turns to Archer
He's lying
He's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph
Pollux is a manipulative psychopath
He can control his heartbeat, his sweat glands, his blood pressure
Jon,  trust your instincts, always have
But
wants more evidence
And frankly, so do
You'll get all the evidence you need when ten thousand people die
We'll get a team right on it
But we can't evacuate the city on what amounts to a hunch
Archer looks at the gathered brass
He knows it's hopeless
That bomb has been built, it's out there somewhere and it's going to detonate
-   - Words etched in the granite wall read: Archer watches as a workman engraves the last of the three new stars among so many others -- each one honoring the dead
Didn't Castor give any clue where the bomb might be
Only one person knows -- his brother Pollux
And he'll keep his mouth shut until it blows
We could plant an agent in his cell -- get him to spill the location
Pollux is way too paranoid
The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is Castor himself
And dead men can't talk
Brodie and Miller exchange a knowing look
There might be a way around that
- ' Tubes and hoses are plugged into every orifice
- Archer stares at the body
he can't believe it
Why are you keeping him alive
(gets no answer) As long as he's breathing, he's dangerous
Relax, he's a turnip
Miller grinds out her cigarette on Castor's leg
Of course, Castor just lies there like a vegetable
We can arrange for you to enter Erewhon Prison -- as Castor Troy
What are you talking about
Archer turns as
(50s) enters the room
think 'd better answer that question
(offers hand) Malcolm Hoag
run the Physiological Camouflage Unit for Special Ops
know who you are
But you don't know what he can do
Physical augmentation; enhancement surgery
He can disguise a compromised agent or alter the likeness -- even the voice -- of a government witness
Let me show you how it's done
(leading him out) think you'll recognize our patient
'   - Loomis lies still as a surgeon carefully scrapes away charred flesh around his burned ear
The doctor turns to a -- - Laser-beams attack an organic soup with incredible precision
The light forces a chemical reaction -- and out of the soup -- an ear begins to form
It rises from the liquid, now fully-formed
The surgeon takes the ear and fits it in place on Loomis's head
He starts suturing
- Archer, Hoag, Brodie and Miller watch the operation -- video-enhanced by the two huge screens on the far walls
With our new generation of anti- inflammatories, healing is accelerated from weeks to days
By his next paycheck, he won't even remember which ear he lost
(a beat) Your situation, however, would be a little less permanent
-- and a lot more classified
Hoag holds up a face-sized organic shell made up of yellow cartilage pieces and tendons, etc
Archer pulls it over his face -- like a gauze mask
"tendon" falls off
This'll fool Pollux
That is a state-of-the-art morpho- genetic template
The inside can be built to match the exact shape of your skull; the outside -- exactly like Castor's
Then we fit his face right on top -- -- and you become him
You're talking about removing the guy's face
Borrowing, Jon
The procedure's completely reversible
One way or the other -- the mission ends on the eighteenth
Archer turns the shell over and over and over in his hands
You know Castor better than anyone
You've lived and breathed him for years -- hell, you even look a little like him
Archer shoves the template back at Hoag
Find yourself another lab-rat
If you don't do this -- Castor will beat us again
He'll beat you again
Archer pushes his way past them -- and marches out
don't think that went very well
Trust us, Doc
he'll jerk around
Then he'll be back
- Archer enters
sizes up
His stylish garb doesn't completely hide his criminal roots
Archer sits down calmly
He looks at his watch
'm in a hurry, Dietrich
So you've only got ten seconds to go through your usual litany of lies, empty threats, and moronic denials
Then 'm coming over there -- If you're in such a fucking hurry -- why are you wasting your time with me
'm just an art dealer
You're a dealer, all right: technical secrets, munitions
explosives
You've never proven any of that
And when my bitchy, never-been- laid femi-nazi lawyer gets here, she's going to
Time's up
Archer topples the wooden table and tears a leg from the top
Brandishing it -- he stalks the startled thug
- Lazarro blanches as an obsessed Archer repeatedly slams the table leg against the wall -- above Dietrich's head
The only ticking bomb  see is inside his head
He's getting worse, Tito
Don't worry, sir
It's all an act
But as Lazarro leaves -- we see Tito's worried, too
Archer has a terrified Dietrich backed into the corner
Okay
Castor called me but blew him off
swear  never saw him
And  don't know anything about any bomb
-    - Archer emerges
eyes blazing
Let him go, but  want him watched
Who's next
Just Dietrich's sister
In another booth, a careworn but striking woman sits with a little boy on her lap
She gently helps him Crayola a book
This is   (30) and her son  (5)
- Archer hovers over Sasha -- her maternal warmth replaced by an icy hatred
Tito and the child are gone
When was the last time you saw Castor Troy
Who cares
He's dead
Answer the question
Look, 'm clean
teach kids now -- Sasha -- you are a felon, on probation for harboring Castor Troy
So it's in your best interest to cooperate
(as she's silent) Would you like your son put in a foster home
Sasha's eyes flash, her body coils -- but she keeps control
No, but 'm sure you'd love it -- you sick bastard
(unmoved) When was the last time you saw Castor Troy
She stares at him with equal amounts of pity and hatred
haven't seen him for years
- Archer watches as Adam leaves Dietrich and jumps into Sasha's arms
She hugs him protectively
Adam sees Archer watching them -- and smiles
Archer doesn't smile back
- ' : - Archer slowly circles Castor's muscular, hairy, tattooed body
Although on life support -- his signature smirk remains
What about Lazarro
No way -- the red tape alone would take a month
This is a black-bag operation -- completely off the books
If you need him, Tito can help you prepare
But you know the drill: You can't tell anyone -- not the Director, not your wife
nobody
Archer's face shows he doesn't like it -- then he nods
'm in
- Archer slowly gets out of his car
Trudging toward the front door, he picks up a basketball and takes a shot
His form is terrible -- he misses by a mile
- Archer passes Jamie's room
Loud   from within
He pauses to knock, thinks again, then heads down the hall
- Eve is in bed
Archer comes in quietly and sits beside her -- studying her peaceful, sleeping face
She stirs
was dreaming
Something good
'm not sure
you were flying this weird old stunt plane
doing flips
walking on the wings
was watching from the ground -- when you fell
You had a parachute, but you wouldn't open it
Did you catch me
No
How come
don't know
(nuzzles him) Maybe because you've never needed my help
Come on, you made that up, didn't you
Maybe  did
(teasing) maybe  didn't
They kiss affectionately
Passion building, Eve runs her hands over his body -- until her fingers touch a round scar on his chest
Archer freezes -- mid-caress
It's all right, Jon
After all these years,  still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive
And you wouldn't be
No response
The pain hidden in his silence chills Eve
Things will get better now that you're home
Everything will be better -- now that
that man is finally out of our lives
Eve
He starts to say the words
He wants, needs to share the truth with her
But he can't
Instead -- If  had to do something to find some closure
should do it, shouldn't
No matter how crazy
Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again
One last time
And while 'm gone,  want you and Jamie to go to your mother's
It's important
You said you'd be here
You promised
What could be more important than that
can't tell you
except only can do it
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave
Okay, go on
Go
Fury erupting, Eve pushes Archer out of the bed
- Archer enters a child's room -- neat and tidy, like a museum exhibit
starfield of glow-letters twinkles faintly
He lies down on the bed and toys with his wedding band -- staring up at the words the stars form
"
" : -   - - The blinking  of the bomb timer continues to count down
/
'56 /  -  - Tito drives into the Hoag compound
Archer's beside him, juggling Castor's dossier: documents, photos, etc
Jon, this is goddam insane
You can't do it
Archer says nothing
it's too late for debate
Tito parks
The men get out and head for the lab
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux
Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24- hour hard-on
He's nothing like you -- Don't worry
If Hoag can do half what he claims, 'll get Pollux to talk
Archer reaches for the door -- Tito stops him
It's not that simple, Jon
Becoming another person -- especially him -- nobody can come all the way back from that
not even you
Archer considers his friend's words
He toys with, then removes, his wedding bang
Keep this for me
As Tito takes the ring -- a caring, but concerned look passes between the two friends
- Two huge video screens are dominated by the -images of Archer and Castor
As Hoag briefs the team, the - images glow to reflect the physical characteristic Hoag refers to
Let's walk through it, Jon
Your blood types are different, but we can't do anything about that
Otherwise, nature is cooperating nicely
The height difference is negligible -- within 1/2 an inch
Eye color -- almost a perfect match
Penis size, flaccid, essentially the same -- Substantial
From the observation booth above -- Miller (flanked by Tito and Brodie) raises his eyebrow
On the video screens, the images morph to signify the physical augmentations
Hairline will be adjusted with laser-shears
micro-plugs for the body hair
the teeth will be bonded to match Castor's
Hoag eyes Castor's inert, tight body -- then turns to Archer -- prodding his love handles like a livestock inspector
How about an abdominoplasty
Abdomino -- what
tummy tuck
On the house
Do it
( huge video screen enlargements of Archer and Castor's body parts as necessary): Globules of adipose tissue are siphoned off Archer's obliques
At the same time
Hoag recreates the "Great Sphinx" tattoo on Archer's thigh
We    his leg, then   to reveal
Archer and Tito
The   on his leg becomes a as he walks across the rooftop -- like himself
Tito demonstrated the proper "Castor gait": dangerously casual, like a panther
Hoag reproduces Castor's fingerprints
then layers them over Archer's fingers
Archer practices Castor's icy, killer glare
Tito hands him a lit cigarette
Archer brings the cigarette to his lips -- then coughs harshly
But he keeps trying
Castor smiles
then smirks and laughs
to reveal Archer studying surveillance footage of Castor on a monitor-screen -- mimicking him
Archer fusses with his new hair, trying to cover the thin spots
Giving  up, he zips up his sweatshirt -- getting the zipper caught in his new chest hair
-  - Tito tosses a pistol
Archer catches it with his right hand
But to Archer's surprise, Tito frowns
Nice catch
But you used the wrong hand
He takes the pistol away -- and slaps it in Archer's left hand
Then Tito shoves him -- challengingly
Shoot me
(as Archer doesn't move) Shoot me
Tito pulls the gun against his own forehead
You want to be Castor Troy
If you hesitate for a breath, you're finished
Now -- shoot me
Kill me
Archer holds the gun unsteadily
Tito is disgusted
You can't do it
because Castor is tougher than you
The  goes off -- the slug tears past Tito's head
Shocked, he touches his left ear, making sure it's still there
Then Tito looks at Archer -- and sees the determination
'  - Clear and calm
God's night
Someone's God anyway
- Hoag leads Archer to a full-length mirror
Let's see if  missed anything before  get my hands really dirty
Archer removes the robe
He's amazed to see: His own head on Castor's body:  a flat stomach, hairy chest, tattoos, thinning hair, etc
Hoag touches Archer's scar
You realize this has to be removed
(as Archer slowly nods) Then here we go, Commander
Through the Looking Glass
- Unconscious, Archer is wheeled into the surgical bay, Castor beside him
Hoag turns to the video technician
Make sure you get everything -- 'll need to study the tape before the reverse surgery
Hoag lowers an aerated Plexiglas mask over Archer's face
Interwoven with integrated laser circuitry -- this Derma- Induction-Device (
) attaches via suction
Hoag sights through the optical memory, squeezes the trigger
cobalt beam cuts around the face -- cleanly slicing it
Then Hoag lifts Archer's face -- off of his skull
Brodie and Miller watch from above
Tito stumbles into the nearby bathroom to throw up
Hoag inspects Archer's face, then turns to his nurse
Vault it
Hoag turns to perform the same procedure on Castor
Castor's consistent  reading suddenly spikes radically -- for a moment, it almost seems to stabilize
Hoag glances over -- too late -- the spikes have disappeared
But the     Castor's ear -- and we sense that, somehow, his auditory nerves might be functioning
: - head swathed in gauze
The bandages start to fall away
Tito, Miller and Brodie wait as Hoag removes the gauze
The patient looks into a mirror
Jon Archer has become Castor Troy
he touches his new face
Archer stares
the cold reality chilling his blood
Archer buckles -- unprepared emotionally for what he's done to himself
For a moment, he seems to teeter on madness
Jon -- are you all right
Archer can't respond
he's somewhere the others can't comprehend
Finally he emerges
shaken, but in control
enters
Instinctively, he grabs for his holster
Okay
'm okay
(realizes) But my voice
still sound like me
implanted a micro-chip onto your larynx
Hoag   an
Archer repeats Castor's words as Hoag adjusts the chip with a wavelength box
(
) Okay, 've got a               Okay, 've got a confession to make, but        confession to make, but you aren't gonna like          you aren't gonna like it
(etc
)                   it
(etc
) After a few repetitions, Archer's voice matches perfectly
Archer yawns, squints and furrows his brow -- testing every muscle
He stares into the mirror -- into the eyes of his most hated enemy -- now his eyes
Archer slowly turns to
Castor
Motionless, swathed, dead to the world -- but something about Castor's smile -- that mocking smile
Now what
We're down to 72 hours
Let's call Lazarro
Castor Troy just came out of his coma
- Armed agents take their positions around a helipad jet-black helicopter drops from the sky like an angry wasp
- As Lazarro watches -- Tito escorts out a heavily-manacled "Castor
"  Two armed agents leap from the chopper and take charge of "Castor
"  He follows them pliantly, until -- Watch this hard-case -- he'll bite your nuts off if he gets the chance
Archer gets the message
He starts to resist the agents and must be muscled into the chopper
He's manacled down
Eye contact between Archer and Tito -- both aware of this very real point of departure
The It lifts off like a twister and  away
-   - The watching team breaks up, wanders back to work
What a week for Archer to go on a training op
Maybe we should try to contact him
Forget it
He's knee-deep in Georgia swamp by now
They pass Brodie and Miller, who watch the chopper disappear over the horizon
So far so good
-  - The agent re-checks Archer's chains
Don't forget --  ordered a kosher meal
The agent smashes his elbow into Archer's gut
The second agent presses an  against Archer's leg
Archer spasms against the drug -- then sags unconscious
- Archer wakes up as a torrent of delousing spray hits him
guard holds a water cannon on the newest inmate
Archer lies gasping on the steel floor, protecting his face
The spray stops -- when head guard "" enters
You are now an Erewhon inmate -- a citizen of nowhere
Human rights zealots, the Geneva convention and the
police have no authority here
You have no right
(slaps on latex gloves) When  say your ass belongs to me --  mean it
Bend over
Archer's face reflects the degradation as he bends over and exposes all to the cavity-searching Guard
Satisfied, Walton lets Archer dress
Another guard places a pair of odd-looking steel boots before Archer
Step into them
Archer inspects the lock-down boots
Hinged steel collars hook over the shoe and encase the ankle
The soles are gridded steel with magnetic inserts
Don't sniff 'em, you perv
Just step into them
Archer obeys
guard squats down and locks the steel collars over Archer's shoes
He tries to move -- but can't
They're too tight
So's a noose
Now keep your mouth shut
Walton  Archer with his - -
The prison's one big magnetic field
The boots'll tell us where you are -- every second of the day
(into comm-link) 201 to Population
Walton presses his thumb into a standard  scan-pad
It forms a print -- positively identifying the guard
The heavy blast-door automatically opens
've got fifty bucks says you're dead by dinner
Don't disappoint me
Walton prods Archer toward the door
To Archer's surprise -- he can now move
- The inmates eat
Silence descends as Archer enters -- intensifying the constant  of the
Huge Dubov does a slow burn on seeing "Castor
" Scanning the room for Pollux -- Archer takes a seat next to a ,   with a French accent
Hey, Castor -- remember me
Fabrice Voisine
sure,  -- (catches himself) --  believe Jon Archer busted you for poisoning five members of the the Canadian parliament
( ) Those scumbags should never have voted against the Quebecois
(a beat) We heard you got wasted
Archer sees the other inmates sizing him up
Do  look wasted -- asshole
Voisine shakes his head "no" -- then his eyes widen as
Dubov leaps onto Archer and starts pummeling him
They slide across the table -- spilling everyone's lunch
(into comm-unit) Central
have a disturbance in population
Go to lock down -- (into comm-unit) Hold that lock down
Walton watches as Dubov throws Archer across the room
Archer staggers to his feet -- and sees the encircling inmates and guards looking at him -- unimpressed
Especially his "brother" Pollux -- who watches uncertainly
Dubov attacks again -- but Archer is ready
He grabs Dubov's fist -- just before it hits his face
Never -- in -- the -- face
Holding Dubov's fist firmly, Archer kicks Dubov repeatedly in the groin
Metal boot meeting soft flesh
Dubov staggers back -- hurt
Archer moves in for the kill, savoring it
Walton looks skyward
Lock 'em down
: - The prison's nerve center -- with video-feeds and monitors designed to keep problems and privacy to a minimum
The two deputies react to Walton's call
Identifying Archer and Dubov's signature-blips -- they throw the appropriate switches and
The magnetic boots lock both inmates to the floor
Dubov flails hopelessly -- but Archer's just out of reach
Crack
Walton punches Archer in the diaphragm
What
He started it
Walton smashes Archer harder -- he hits the floor
When  get out of here -- You'll what
'm going to have you fired
His statement is so ludicrous, Walton laughs
Everyone does
From the inmates' reactions, Archer knows he's been accepted
(to Dubov) That's two strikes, Dubov
One more and you know where you're going
(to the others) Back to your 'suites' -- or no dinner
As Archer drops into the line of cons -- he spots Pollux waiting for him
Girding himself for this first encounter -- he's got a plan
Hey, bro
-- Pollux
Of course it's Pollux, what the fuck's wrong with you
Archer stares -- feigning confusion until Walton prods him forward
Pollux watches his "brother" go -- very concerned
'  - Archer lies on his cot -- staring at the ceiling
Isolated, lonely, he realizes how easy it would be to go insane here
- An insanely starry night
Van Gogh's night
The night he cut off his ear, anyway
- Castor's body lies inert
His life-support away
Until the  spikes
Once -- twice -- three times
Brain wave activity increases -- and stabilizes
Castor's fingers twitch
Then his fist clenches -- hard
Castor's head is swathed in gauze
But his eyes pop open
Reflexively, Castor wrenches from the bed -- tearing out the tubes and wires that tether him to life support
He goes down -- in agony -- groaning
He struggles to his feet -- staggering through the lab -- until he catches the reflection of his bandaged face in the window
He quickly unwraps the gauze
The discarded bandages fall at his feet
we don't see what  sees -- but we hear him
then
then  -- the only moment Castor ever loses his cool
Finally composing himself -- Castor's hand grips the phone and he dials
Lars
okay, Lunt, then
(rifling desk documents) Something really fucked-up happened
'm in trouble
so listen very carefully
-  () up
At gunpoint, Lars and Lunt manhandle Hoag into the lab
- Lars and Lunt hustle Hoag in
The lab is on
The screens run -- scrolling through the video log of Archer's surgery
Hoag sees his terrified assistants -- bound with duct tape
What's this about
What do you want
Lars shoves Hoag into a towering figure
we Hoag's glasses
And  the  we see
Hoag reacts in horror at the raw muscle, cartilage and bone
The man lifts a cigarette to his lips
then exhales
What do you think  want
-  - huge wall-screen plays gentle nature scenes
Below -- the inmates engage in their exercise hour
Voisine stares at the screen -- while Pollux carefully watches his "brother" play basketball
Archer tosses up an air-ball to the jeers of other inmates
You realize, of course, that magnetic humming is designed to drive us insane
If we all don't get brain tumors first
And that same cloying Bambi tape -- over and over
It's like they're begging us to riot
Where the fuck are we, anyway
(the game ends) Gotta go
Pollux trots over to Archer -- passes him his cigarette
He studies Archer as he takes a drag -- and nearly gags
'm worried about you
Why
Your jumpshot has no arc
You used to swagger
now you swish
You're gumming that butt like a Catholic school girl
(notices) And why do you keep picking at your finger
Pollux has caught Archer reflexively tugging at his phantom wedding ring
Archer immediately stops
He takes a drag and holds it -- then exhales right in Pollux's face
was in a coma
Pollux sticks his finger under Archer's eye and pulls down like a vet examining a sick dog
Archer pushes him off
My reflexes, my senses, my memory
everything's jumbled can't even tell you why Dubov jumped me yesterday
You Pollinated his wife the day he was arrested
How could forget that
've forgotten plenty
Look around -- we've screwed over half the freaks in here
What's gonna happen to us if they think 've lost it
Pollux contemplates the other inmates -- circling, sizing up the brothers like hungry sharks
Instinctively, Pollux moves closer to Archer for protection
need you to play big brother for once -- till  can fill in a few blanks
Think you can handle that
Pollux nods grimly -- then Archer pulls up his sleeve, exposing the pyramid tattoo
know  got this on my tenth birthday
just can't remember why
Man -- that was the worst day of our lives
Archer feigns a "struggle" with his memory
He lights a new butt with the old -- chain-style
then "remembers
" Oh, God -- Mom -'d at County General
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass
You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution
(a beat) Remember what you swore to me at the funeral
Uh -- to kill the doctors
After that
You promised you'd always take care of me
And  bet  kept that promise
Only one you've never broken
Pollux curls into Archer -- in need of comfort
Archer puts an affectionate arm around Pollux -- springing the trap
Screw the past
We've got the future to look forward to
(a beat) We still have tomorrow
No shit
five million bucks
now those Red Militia crackpots get to keep it
That's not the worst part
What's worse than losing five million bucks
Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows
What you built was a work of art
It belongs in the Smithsonian
Pollux beams with pride -- Archer hangs on every word
Yeah -- well
the
Convention Center will have to do
Thanks, Pollux
'Thanks'
guess they really did fuck you up
Then Archer smiles -- like Jon Archer
Without knowing exactly why -- a wave of ill-ease overtakes Pollux
'  - Archer paces impatiently
as the door rolls open
Walton is looking at him with cool respect
You have a visitor
Archer smiles to himself -- pleased at Brodie's timeliness
- Archer's boots lock down -- as the guillotine door rises
But his confidence evaporates into unspeakable horror
Because he finds himself staring into the blue eyes of -- Jon Archer
This man has Archer's face -- his real face
What's the matter
Don't you like the new me
Archer studies the image of his former self -- trying to understand
Then he recognizes the smirk on the face, the mocking twinkle in the eyes and he says what he cannot say
-- Castor
Not anymore
It can't be
It's impossible
believe the phrase Dr
Hoag used was 'titanically remote'
Who knows
Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out
Or maybe God really is on my side after all
(starts pacing) By the way,  know you don't get the papers in here
Continuing to circle, he displays the current  Times: "    -- Malcolm Hoag Dead" Terrible tragedy
Hoag was such a genius -- but selfish with his artistry actually had to torture his assistants to convince him to perform the same surgery on me
You killed them
Of course  killed them, you dumb fuck
Hoag, his staff
Hoag's body -- on the floor of the burning lab
Two more burned bodies adjoin Hoag's
Miller and Brodie -- Brodie and Miller -- dead in a mangled car wreck
even paid a visit to your buddy Tito
He doesn't know anything about this
Come on, Jon
think  know you better than that
only wish you could have been there to see the look on his face -- Tito
he smiles, then recoils in shock as Castor lifts a pistol and shoots him
then he picks up Archer's wedding band off the counter
() Archer stares -- thunderstruck -- at the wedding band now on Castor's finger
-- then again,  guess you were there
(a beat) torched every shred of evidence that proves who you are
So swallow this -- you are going to be in here for the rest of your life
Castor, don't do this -- No discussion, Jon -- no deals
Now if you'll excuse me, 've got an important government job to abuse, and a beautiful wife to fuck
Excuse me --  mean 'make love to
' Archer freaks out
He screams, flails -- unable to reach Castor
Castor opens the door and guards rush in -- clubbing Archer and shocking him senseless
Sorry, sir
It's quite all right
You never know what to expect from a psychopathic criminal
- The guards dump Archer into his cell
Better be nice, Castor
You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone
Pollux is -- what
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence
He's been released
Walton, you have to listen to me -- right now
Or what
You'll have me fired
(pushes a button) You're confined until  say otherwise
The steel panels shut - silencing Archer's pleading voice
'  -  - Sipping a beer, Castor cruises past the suburban bliss: men on hammocks; women chatting; kids playing tag
(sickened) Jesus, what a life
Castor tries to catch a street address and rolls past
' Dressed for work, Eve watches blandly as the car goes by
moment later, it backs up and parks
Hiding the beer can, Castor forces a sheepish smile -- and gets out
She doesn't smile back
suppose it was only a matter of time before you forgot where we lived
Sorry -- the job's been murder lately
Castor looks her over -- she's much sexier than he expected
So what happened to your 'important' assignment
What do you know about it
know exactly what you always tell me:  Absolutely nothing
It didn't work out the way everyone thought it would
Where are you off to
've got surgery
Surgery -- are you okay
Then he spots her medical bag
Oops
Don't try to charm me -- 'm still angry
There're leftovers in the fridge
Have fun at work
Castor kisses her good-bye -- on the mouth
What is with you
Don't  usually kiss my wife
No
Castor reacts as she gets in the car and pulls out
'  - Castor steps inside, looks around
What a dump
- Castor sifts through Christmas cards from holidays past, studying the ones with photos
He's memorizing -- matching names to faces -- Wanda's, Buzz's, Lazarro's, etc
Something else catches his eye
He finds a floral notebook -- Eve's diary -- and pages through it
Then, he reads: '
"Date-night" has been a typical failure
we haven't made love in almost two months
' What a loser
Castor hears a voice
Glancing across the hall, he sees
As she walks back and forth in her room, talking on the phone -- and wearing only panties and a cropped -shirt
Castor steps closer -- enjoying the view
The plot thickens
'  - Jamie stamps out her cigarette
--  got your -mail, Karl
That poem was really sweet -- (spots Castor at door) Hang on a sec
She slams it -- but he gets his foot inside
'll call you back
(to Castor) You're not respecting my boundaries
'm coming in, Janie
Castor pushes menacingly into the room
'Janie'
Castor spots her correct name embroidered on a pillow
He gazes seductively -- unnerving Jamie as he steps toward her
don't think you heard me
Jamie
You have something want
He reaches for her -- and right past her
He picks up a pack of cigarettes from the desk
Clarissa left those here
(shrugs and lights up) won't tell mom if you don't
When did you start smoking
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here -- (blows a perfect smoke ring) Daddy's a new man
Jamie stares, astonished, as Castor goes out
- ' Fists bloody, voice hoarse, Archer pounds at the cell door
Exhausted, he finally stops -- staring at the face of his enemy in the mirrored door -- the enemy who now has total command of his life
-   - Castor dons his stern "Archer" face as the gate guard checks his thumbprint
He's cleared and waved in
- Buzz and Wanda watch Pollux through the two-way mirror
He's gorging himself on a big lunch
Castor arrives
Listen, sir
we just want you to know
We're all really sorry about Tito
Yeah, well, shit happens
Buzz and Wanda exchange a glance
To them, "Archer" is just avoiding his feelings again
How's our star witness
He hasn't told us a damn thing except what kind of mustard he likes on his tongue sandwiches
If that bomb is out there -- we're almost out of time
(
) Archer
Lazarro stomps toward them
furious
Buzz and Wanda quickly excuse themselves
You made a deal with Pollux Troy
He's 'a manipulative psychopath
' Your own words, Jon
Just let me do my job, Victor
The job 've been protecting for the last eight years
From now on, you go strictly by the book
Everything gets cleared by me
Understand
Lazarro stomps off
Castor watches him go, wheels turning
- Castor enters -- shutting down the mikes
and the blinds
You're supposed to be snitching -- making me look good
'Look good'
(drops food in disgust) Seeing that face --  want to vomit
'm the one who has to look at this butt-ugly mug every time pass a mirror
Look at my eyes, my chin, my perfect nose -- gone
(considers his reflection) Archer took my life, so 'm taking his
Bro, 'm going straight
Sounds like they took your brain, too
Imagine Dillinger as
Edgar Hoover
Carlos the Jackal running Interpol
Kaddafi heading the Mossad
Think of the secrets we could sell
Pollux listens carefully -- mind clicking like an abacus
The drug agents we could expose
The movie stars we could blackmail
That's just the bottom of the food chain
Pollux -- what would happen if somebody planted a bomb on Air Force One
that somebody would get rich
And,  suppose, the nation would be pretty pissed-off
Pissed-off, vulnerable
looking for someone to step in, take charge, give them hope again
What if that someone was an
hero
true Boy Scout and family man -- with a spotless past
Imagine where that guy could land -- if the timing's right
It's an audacious dream, Caz
But Jon Archer is hardly a household name
Not yet he isn't
But after you 'confess' -- you'll be a free man
And 'll be on my way
- Police   into position
Squads of police evacuate throngs of people
- - - -   - down to less than two minutes
Working as a unit, the   carefully remove the bomb's casing
Inside, the complex guts glow evilly
The men are tense, cautious -- and way out of their league
Jesus
Any suggestions
Yeah
run Castor pushes up his blast visor
He looks grim
It's protected by a vibration detector
One touch and
Evacuate your team, Captain
Sir, you can't disarm it -- Just go
The bomb squad hustles out
Waiting until he's alone, Castor pulls a radio device from his pocket and hits its switch
The bomb's glow dies instantly
- stops at 26 seconds
Not satisfied, Castor starts it up again -- running the timer down to four seconds
That's better
- "" - The inmates eat lunch
Walton enters -- prodding a beaten Jon Archer ahead of him
special privilege today:   -- by order of Agent Jon Archer of the
Jeers from the inmates as the big screen changes from the nature loop to
- "Sweating," Castor lumbers out, carrying the disarmed bomb
(
) That was the scene at the
Convention Center, where an
agent is being hailed as a hero
Agent Jon Archer disarmed a powerful bomb just seconds before it was set to explode
Let's get the latest from Valerie Rice
- Castor basks in the attention of the gathered media
The apparent target was a group of Supreme Court justices -- due to speak here today
(thrusting microphone) Mr
Archer, do you have any idea who planted it
That's classified
But if he's listening  have a message for him: (directly into camera) Nice try
Now you know who's really in charge
- Watching the , Archer's enraged, frustrated
Then his eyes focus
he watches closely as -- guard uses his "thumbprint " to get through the security door
Archer's eyes fall on the thumbprint scan pad
-  - Castor gets a "thumbs up" from some co-workers, others smile -- but they know better than to applaud
Don't you guys watch
Where's the parade
They look at each other -- afraid
But proud rookie Loomis starts clapping, so everyone else joins in rousing applause
-- Loomis, Buzz, uh -- Wanda
all of you, thanks from the bottom of my heart
Thanks for enduring all those years  was an insufferable boor
From now on -- consider me reborn
Stop the presses -- Jon Archer found a personality
Wild applause
interrupted by an excited Kim
Sir
the White House is calling
Castor acts startled
as if at a loss
Then he struts toward his office -- pausing only to give Kim a playful swat on the rump
She's stunned
'  - Castor surveys his new domain
He settles into Archer's big leather chair
sees a framed photo of Archer and family
He apes Archer's dumb posed smile
Jon, your career is finally taking of
(picks up phone) Archer
Sure 'll hold
Waiting, he picks up a handbook:  You and the : Primer for New Employees
Then
Mr
President, what an honor
Castor pumps a "whacking off" gesture with his hand
'  - Castor, carrying grocery bags, comes into the back yard where Jamie practices free throws
He watches her miss
How about a game of horse
Don't make me beat your butt again, Dad
It's harmful to my developing psyche
Afraid you'll lose
Castor crisply sinks a free-throw
Jamie glares, takes the ball -- and tosses an air-ball
'
' Jamie sneers at him
He buries another one
Try putting a higher arc on the ball
and square your shoulders to the basket
Begrudgingly, she listens -- and sinks a clean shot
Pleased, she nods
pulls into the driveway
Gotta go
Karl's here
Jamie trots over to greet  (17) -- a clean-cut preppie
Opening the car door dor her, Karl waves, smiling at Castor
Castor studies Karl carefully, not liking what he sees
'  - tired Eve opens the door
It's pitch black inside
As she fumbles for the light switch
flares as Castor lights a candle
The dining room table is set for a candlelight dinner
He smiles warmly at her confusion
Don't tell me you forgot
Eve -- it's date night
- Eve looks up from her pasta
After an awkward silence
Why do  feel like 'm on a blind date
It's important to keep some mystery
so things stay
unpredictable
Eve studies him as he pours her more wine
Her smile slowly fades as she realizes what's going on
'Unpredictable'
You're about as unpredictable as the tide
(detached) How long are you going to be gone this time
Gone
Isn't that what all this is about
The wine, cooking me dinner -- your next assignment
'm not going anywhere
You always say that -- then you leave
bet  deserved that
bet Jon Archer is the most inattentive, sexless spouse on Earth
Jon, that's not true -- Of course it's true, but 'm trying to change
'm here because  want to be alone with you
want to see the candle- light dance in your beautiful -- Uh-oh
Castor can't tell the color of Eve's eyes
He leans in "romantically" -- but we know the real reason
-- brown eyes
He smells her hair, then her shoulders, her skin
She's aroused, but wary
So Castor goes in for the kill
wanted it all to be just right
when  told you about my promotion
Your what
Well,  don't have it yet
But Lazarro's getting old -- he won't be around forever
And 'm getting the itch to move up
Jon
that's wonderful
So you see, 'm not going anywhere
Unless it's upstairs with you
- Castor carries Eve into the shower and spins on the water
He rips her blouse open -- on her like a vulture to carrion
As they drop to the floor of the stall -- water filling up around them -- Castor licks her ear and whispers
baby, it's like 'm having you for the first time
Dirty water runs down a floor drain
to: -  - Desolate, Archer mops down the rec area
Don't they ever let us take off these boots
Not unless you're sent to the 'Clinic
' You mean if  get sick
They don't give two fucks about your health
The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment
Dubov just got sent down -- and look at Wainwright -- Voisine gestures to a dazed inmate nearby -- -- who sits in a corner -- gnawing at his knuckles
Toughest bastard  ever saw -- after you, of course
Now he's a fucking drool case
What did he do
He hit a guard
Archer sees Walton hovering nearby
Archer heads for him
Looking for trouble, Castor
As a matter of fact -- yes
Crack
Archer decks Walton
-  - Walton and a guard herd Archer toward a steel door
"" - Archer is dumped on the floor
He sees he's lying in a puddle of something
He looks up -- and recoils
'  - is strapped to a vertical gurney -- post-procedure
His limbs are stiff, his eyes blank as a mako shark's
But his feet are bare -- bootless
- Where's the mop, he puked all over the place
An assistant unstraps Dubov and drops him on a gurney
- (mopping up) -- next time, bring them in before dinner
Archer cases the place:  Above is a catwalk
leading out
Walton muscles Archer into the gurney
The Med-Tech smirks
- Oh happy day -- Castor Troy
The Med-Tech wheels the  head-gear cart into place: twin needle-like  ready to fit into ' ears
single blue static spark jumps from the bolts
Walton roughly wedges Archer's head into the head gear, shoving the chewed-up bite strap into Archer's mouth
Bite hard, scumbag, 'cause you'll be gumming baby food from here on out
- Get his boots, Sergeant
Walton unlocks Archer's first boot and pulls it off
As the Med-Tech starts to fasten Archer's arm -- Walton unlocks and pulls off the second boot
Archer's feet are free
Crack
He yanks his foot up hard -- Walton reels back, stunned
One arm still restrained, Archer backrolls in the gurney and kicks the head-gear cart away -- knocking it into the Med-Tech who collapses onto it, hitting "Test" -- The - , catching the Med-Tech through the shoulder -- he drops to the floor, his synapses shot
Seeing that Archer is still restrained by the arm -- the assistant darts out of the room
As Archer pulls free -- Walton looms over him -- gun poised
Then -- wham
Dubov wallops Walton -- using his boots as brass knuckles
The head guard collapses
Dubov smiles dumbly at Archer -- all trace of vendetta now obliterated
Archer nods gratefully -- they're on the same team
at least for now
Suddenly the
Archer sees guards charging the room
He tries closing the door -- but the guards arrive
Dubov lumbers over and puts his massive weight into it -- and slams the door shut
, guards  at the now-locked door
Archer quickly frisks Walton -- coming up with a cigarette lighter
he pockets it
Scanning around -- Archer leaps onto a mounted, hinged lamp
it swings against the wall
Archer uses it to reach the catwalk above
Dubov -- come on
Dubov obeys and follows Archer up onto the catwalk
groggy Walton muscles open the door from inside
Guards pour in
Walton grabs an - and opens chase Archer and Dubov as they flee through the catwalk door
Two guards watch Archer and Dubov disappear off the clinic's monitor
They grab their shock-sticks and rush for the door
The door opens -- revealing Dubov and Archer
Perfectly in synch -- they double cold-cock the startled guards
Archer grabs a shock-stick -- and fuses the door shut
He yanks out wires and shatters the computers
Dubov mimics the behavior -- ripping out an entire console -- and revealing a narrow cable duct
Flames explode -- shorting the circuitry -- the -- the magnetic power monitor shows a dangerous surge
Chaos
Guards scatter as the huge diamond-vision and inmates are flung like rag-dolls by their short-circuiting boots
Anything metallic flies into the magnetic domes
As the men back through the cable duct -- Archer struggles to replace the heavy console
The  is  open
Walton enters to find
no one
Then his eyes light on the console -- slightly askew
Archer and Dubov rush down the tight corridor -- and around the bend
The corridor ends in a
/ Lined with tools, toilets, sinks, a rack of old lock-down boots
They race through the far door
Archer and Dubov find themselves in a multi-level labyrinth
hundred feet high -- criss-crossed with catwalks, staircases and high walls
resound -- ,    -- they seem to be coming from all around them
Over the magnetic  -- Archer notices loose screws and other metal debris stuck to the sheer wall
He pulls one screw away -- and lets it fly back into the polarized wall
Archer gets an idea -- and looks back the way they came
: Archer and Dubov scale the face -- using the old metal boots
They climb higher and higher as
Guards criss-cross the catwalks and staircases below and around them -- oblivious
Archer and Dubov almost reach the next level when
There
the wall around them -- just as Archer and Dubov reach the next catwalk
Archer spots the emergency exit security door at the far end
But four guards descend on them -- and block their way
Fist fight as Archer and Dubov take on the attacking guards
Archer heaves one down the stairs -- into more guards
Dubov drops another over the catwalk
They continue their desperate race for the door -- reaching the landing
As   around them -- hulking Dubov rips away a floor panel
He uses it as a shield as Archer sparks up Walton's lighter
As   into the shield -- Archer places the flame to his thumb
and peels off the skin mold
He presses his thumb to the door's keypad
To his horror, its  reads "print unreadable
" Walton and guards movie in,  at closer and closer range
Dubov staggers under the
The shield is repeatedly punctured -- and is quickly disintegrating
Archer licks his thumb, tries again
Finally it reads "Clearance Confirmed"
the door slides open
Let's go
Dubov heaves the shield at the encroaching guards -- but as he turns to follow
Walton  him away
Archer reaches to pull Dubov through, but the riddled inmate ignores the helping hand
Pulling the door shut, he collapses in front of it -- blocking it momentarily
Archer hesitates for a moment
but that's all he has
he keeps going
up the winding staircase-catwalk -- higher and higher -- a step ahead of the onrushing guards
As   around him -- Archer reaches the top
He ignores a sign which reads
He charges straight up a ladder and plows right through -- : - Archer's blinded -- it's daytime in the real world
sea gull flies across his face -- as we  the bird
,   to reveal: The prison's in the middle of the goddamn ocean, in what appears to be just an abandoned, rusty oil rig platform
Archer rushes over to a transport chopper
Archer searches for the keys
No go
He throws switches
Nothing works
Guards pour out of the hatch --
Archer leaps from the chopper and jumps over the side to the platform's -- He lands hard on the slanted, corrugated shed roof and rolls to the ground
He grabs a high-pressure hose -- and cranks the pressure valve -- as the pursuing guards close in
Archer  the guards with the   -- knocking Walton and others into the sea
Archer upends a stack of oil barrels -- which roll into more guards
Archer spots: pulling a Zodiac dinghy -- heading out to sea
Archer jumps up a stack of pipes to the south rail -- where the end of a crane's hook is tagged back
Under -- Archer frees the hook, which swings away from the platform
Hanging on to the hook, it swings him out over the ocean
At the apex -- le lets go and plummets down into
He pulls himself into the  and frees it from the tug

Archer senses something
He looks up and
Whoosh
Something swoops down -- but it's just a pelican
He  with the  -- which finally
Archer grabs the oars -- about to start rowing when -- Another swoop
This time it's the prison chopper
Archer spots a string of buoys dotting the harbor
An idea
The chopper settles over the Zodiac
Wind and water swirl around Archer
Walton, drenched but obviously rescued, has archer in his sights
He starts to  his

The chopper does a final circle of the wreckage

Archer has crawled up into the hollow buoy -- sucking air
-  - Eve's asleep
Castor, dressed, looks down at her like Cortez at Montezuma -- triumphant, with overwhelming power
- Heading for the car, Castor is about to light up when -- Last night,  thought -- this isn't my husband
He pockets the smoke
Eve is there, dressed somberly
Then  woke up in the middle of the night -- and found you passed out in the study
couldn't sleep -- you roll around a lot
(jingles car keys) Anyway, 'm late
Jon, you know what day it is know it's difficult for you, but we still have to go
Can't we skip it just this once
gotta 'protect and serve', you know
'Protect and serve' later
You're going
Okay, if you insist
But -- you drive
He climbs into the front seat beside her
/
-  - pastoral, hilly area near the coast
So who's this Karl creep Jamie's been seeing
He's a little old for her, isn't he
don't know
they're about the same ages we were when we met
(smiles) Remember the all-night dentist
Sure, how could  forget
(changes subject) By the way, you never said anything about last night
He moves closer, stroking her hair as his  sounds
Aren't you going to get that
He turns his beeper off, then touches her lips with his finger
Without knowing exactly why, Eve tenses up
Jon -- this is hardly the time or place
Castor looks around in surprise because he sees she's driving into -- They drive through the gates -- passing a church marked "
'---
"  Nearby, the
'  - It's beautiful here, striking and sad
Now on foot, Castor follows Eve up a bluff, through a phalanx of graves -- with no idea where she's leading him
Finally she stops at a crucifix-topped headstone
Castor joins her and reads the etched marble stone: Matthew Archer, Age 5 Beloved Son & Brother We Cherish You Always Stunned, Castor watches as Eve kneels beside the marker
Happy birthday, Matty
She places a few child's toys on the marker
a shark
a little bulldozer
a spaceship
Overwhelmed with grief, she collapses into Castor
He took our baby, Jon
He took our little boy
- ' He stares at the grave of the boy he killed -- the boy whose mother is weeping into his chest
The ever-present smirk is long gone as Castor stiffly returns Eve's embrace -- maybe, just maybe, feeling the victim's pain
Stop crying
stop crying
stop
- Shaking off his funk, Castor arrives at the office
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off
What happened
Castor's dead
He's -- what
Somehow he escaped from Erewhon
But a prison chopper mowed him down just off Long Beach Harbor
Where's the body
It hasn't been recovered yet
'It hasn't been recovered yet
' You people have no idea who you're dealing with
(beat) want everyone on this, reports on the half hour, and all leads get routed through my office
Buzz, alert the
Even if he is alive, Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city
He's alive -- and he's already here
Move
- Something bobs up in the surf
Archer is thrashed ashore by the breakers
he crawls gasping onto the sand
He takes a few breaths -- then staggers up onto the beach
'  - Archer's heart sinks as he sees the yellow police cordon taped across Tito's front door
Some teenage cholos notice him -- so Archer keeps right on going
'  - rear window is forced open -- Archer pulls himself in
In the dim light, he sees the bullet hole on the wall
then the blood stains within the forensics chalk marks
He buckles and has to sit down
Taking a deep breath, he picks up the phone and dials
Dr
Archer please
It's an emergency
(listens) -- Her husband
Archer waits
He pinches his throat -- trying to dislodge the vocal implant
His voice scrambles into garbled static
Hello, Eve --  know this sounds crazy, but -- (reverting back) Dammit
-  - deftly stitches up a gash above little 's (8) eye
How did this happen, sweetie
' She fell off her Big-Wheel
Something about his too-quick response rankles Eve
She eyes the yuppy Dad with suspicion -- then notes some bruises on the child's arm
enters
Dr
Archer -- your husband's on three
Get Child Services down here -- and don't let her father leave
(goes to wall-phone) Jon
Hello
Archer and Eve as necessary
Eve, listen carefully
The man you think is your husband -- isn't
Who is this
Please, just listen
Take Jamie and go to your mother's in Santa Fe
Don't tell him where you're going -- just go
Whoever you are -- don't call again
Archer sags in futility
snaps him back to reality
Archer goes to the window and carefully peers out
squad     -- then continues on its way
need to speak to Director Lazarro immediately
have information about Castor Troy
Waiting
Archer rifles the room
finding car keys
a baggy jacket
Then
: This is Jon Archer
Who's calling
Archer pauses
hearing his own voice speaking to him
Well, if you're Jon Archer guess this must be Castor Troy
've gotta hand it to you, Jon
You're doing a damn respectable job of being me
But let's face it, we both liked it better the way it was
So before the cops blow your brains out -- why not tell me where you are
If you were really me, you'd know -- no discussion, no deals
Archer hangs up == leaving Castor stewing
- The automatic door lifts -- revealing Tito's old Buick
The big -8  as Archer pulls out
He doesn't get far as
menacing  block his way
# 1 Where are you going
#2 Ten bucks he's the guy who popped Tito
The Cholos surround the Buick
Archer's cornered like an animal as the angry teens pound on the windows
Archer  the  -- scattering all except Cholo #1 who jumps on the hood
Archer  the  -- sending the guy flying
He lands hard, but is only shaken up
As Archer roars off, Cholo #1 pulls out his cell phone
#1 9-1-1
want to report a stolen car and don't put me on hold

-  - Archer drives on -- listening to
(
) the escapee is considered extremely dangerous
If you have any information concerning the whereabouts of Castor Troy
He  it  as he sees in the distance: and  vehicles are parked in front
No way he's getting near there
In his rearview mirror Archer spots a cop car approaching
He quickly turns a corner as the cop slowly cruises by
No, Jon
you have to think like Castor
Where would he go
Archer gets an idea
But as he drives on -- the cop car backs up -- and reappears
- Dietrich locks up his chic art gallery
He gets in his Lexus and drives out of the parking lot
/
-  -  - Dietrich slows down to check out the forensics team swarming all over Tito's parked Buick
Dietrich quickly averts his face as he spots
"Jon Archer" inspecting Tito's Buick
Jon Archer
some poor schmuck's in big trouble
Yeah -- me
With surprising speed, Dietrich yanks a pistol from someplace and jerks around -- Archer -- hunkered down in the back seat -- stares into the barrel of Dietrich's pistol
Jesus Christ, Castor
Drive
And punch up your cellular --  need you to make some calls
You're gonna get me busted
You're already busted, Dietrich
It's just a matter of time before they pick you up
Dietrich snakes the car past the crime scene and speeds off
Man, when you came to me about that bomb --  knew  should have blown you off
but that's my fucking curse --  just can't say no to a friend
You can't say no to money
That's my other curse
-  -  () Cars pull up in front of a gentrified loft amid the low- rent streets
Emerging from them are several thugs -- including Aldo, Fitch and their sexy girl friends,  and Cindee
'  -  - Archer splashes water on his face -- then stops and listens as the
He screws up his courage
You're Castor Troy
This is your old crew -- you don't take shit and you don't take no for an answer
'   - The thugs admire the loft -- dominated by an enormous, in-progress mural and stunning glass-bricked floor
Helluva place, Dietrich
So what's the big surprise
Archer emerges
The men are stunned -- the women beam
Are you crazy
You're going to bring the Feds down on all of us
Archer doesn't want you, he wants me
But 'm going to get him first -- with your help
Archer's a damn celebrity now -- he's untouchable -- and you're radioactive
He turns to leave
Archer wheels him around and smashes him into the wall
Aldo goes for his gun, but Archer's too quick -- he strips him of it
The four bodyguards draw their weapons -- and surround Archer
You wanna face-off with Castor Troy
Come on, then
Come on
'Cause 've had a real bad day
Four against one -- and everyone's sweating but Archer
One-by-one, the bodyguards back off
Archer points the gun at Aldo -- then smiles and hands it back
You're all forgetting who the real enemy is
(to Aldo) Six months ago, Jon Archer hauled you in for questioning
He rattled you so bad -- you shit your Armani suit right there in the interrogation room
Aldo blanches -- how did Castor know that
Fitch laughs
You laugh, Fitch -- the way Archer laughed at your last arraignment, when you got down on your knees and tried to blow your way to freedom
Stunned, Fitch cringes as everybody cracks up
We all have a reason to hate Jon Archer
We all want to see him dead -- And nobody's untouchable if we say he's not
The thugs exchange a glance
reading each other
considering
It's all worked out
Caz has Archer's routine down cold
We start with your basic kidnapping
Then -- a little surgery
Surgery
'm going to rearrange his face in a way you won't believe
You're an evil bitch, Caz
But you've got balls of titanium
Count us in
Archer sighs with relief -- pleased with his performance
Come on -- let's drink to it
- Dietrich cracks it open -- powder sifts into a big high- ball glass filled with mescal
he hands it to Archer
How about one of your famous toasts, Caz
They all look expectantly at Archer
he's at a loss
To old jobs, new jobs and -- uh -- blow jobs
Silence -- then they crack up
Reluctantly, Archer swallows the tumbler of mescal
he fights back the urge to puke
Enough business, Caz
Let's dance
Sorry
don't
She drags him onto the glass floor
Cindee puts on some as Archer's head begins to spin
The girls start "dancing," grinding Archer between their taut bodies
He tries to avoid it, but Livia kisses him -- hot, moist
Remember the Charger's game, Caz
The owners box
We did it four times
Sure  remember
Once a quarter, right
Archer's eyes fall on the series of abstract paintings
The twisted renderings make his head spin worse
as he starts to hallucinate
surrounded by enemies -- he struggles to regain control of his battered psyche
Caz
Are you okay
He pulls away and stumbles down the stairs -- toward the kitchen
When even Castor Troy can't handle a tab of Quantrex
(raises his glass) That, dear friends, is the first sorry whiff of old age
- Archer has his mouth under the tap -- drinking greedily
Woozy, he takes a breath
and notices a reflection in the window above the sink
Archer turns to see -- Sasha
-- Sasha Hassler
Age 35
Met Castor Troy in Austin, Texas, at Pearl Jam reunion
(catches himself) Uh, how you doing, baby
She responds by slapping him -- hard
What the hell are you doing here
You're supposed to be dead
He wobbles, then falls flat on his face
Out cold
'  -  - Castor's chain-smoking, looking out over the city -- wondering where Archer might be hiding
But something breaks his rumination
He sees -- pulls up to the curb
The   from within  , but no one emerges
-  ( ) Curious, Castor approaches the car, keeping a safe distance
He can see Jamie inside, struggling with Karl
No
Karl, please
He "shushes" Jamie -- but doesn't stop pawing her
My father -- he's got a gun -- he'll -- he'll -- (pulls open belt) That wimp won't do shit
The passenger   inward
Castor drags Karl out by his hair
Jamie scrambles out and flees toward the house as
Who are you to call Jon Archer a wimp
Castor heaves Karl into the  -- - it
Somehow the kid finds his feet and stumbles behind the wheel
The Beemer lurches away
- Castor enters to find Jamie, still shaken up
What are you -- stupid
That's just like you
Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him
Did it look like  was siding with him
Did it
(she falls silent) You want to play with scummy organ grinders, you better be prepared
Do you have protection
You mean like
condoms
mean like
protection
With a fluid motion, Castor expertly  open a well- oiled  and hands it to an astonished Jamie
For me
Next time -- slip it in low, then twist it -- so the wound doesn't close
She hugs him tight -- taking Castor by surprise
But he responds momentarily
About to pat her rump -- something makes him stop
Go on, get out of here
Jamie kisses him and heads up stairs
After she's gone
No wonder he spent all his time chasing me
Who can deal with this family shit
The
He rushes to the den and picks it up
Jon Archer
(immediately alert) Where is he
-   - Using night-vision goggles, Pollux watches Sasha close her drapes
Visible in the b
g
on the sofa -- is Archer
(into cell phone) --  thought he might visit some old friends of yours
And bro, if didn't know better -- 'd swear this guy likes being you
'  - Archer wakens
Sasha is tugging off his pants
Uh -- can't we just talk
Talk
The only talk  ever heard from you was 'take it off,' 'sit on it,' ''ll pay you tomorrow
' She pulls out some fresh clothes -- and dumps them on him
Take off the rest of those rags and get dressed
Then get out
Not until  finish my business with your brother
told him to keep those creeps away -- but you're just too big an attraction
(calming herself) Look, if the
finds out you've been here -- 'll lose my son
So please, just go
For the first time, Archer sees not a hardened felon -- but a frightened, protective mother
And he realizes the effect his own relentless obsession has had on her
know 've done some things that made your life harder
How would you
You walked out and never looked back
enters, heading for his toys -- his presence cooling Sasha's deep-seated anger
Archer finishes dressing
'm not the same person you remember
And for what it's worth, 'm sorry
Her harsh look softens imperceptively -- like that of a woman trying to hate someone she still loves
Not a bad fit
They should
They're yours
Nice-looking kid, too Of course he is
Sasha fidgets, struggling with a deep inner turmoil
Then
Adam, come here
want you to meet your father
Archer's face pales over in shock
'  - Their silhouettes are visible against the shades
- Castor, Buzz, Wanda and Loomis peer at the silhouettes
(into cellular) We've got him sighted
Okay, Pollux, pull out
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother
've never been more certain of anything
Get everyone in position
Remember -- shoot to kill
Before Buzz can object, Castor's eyes say "don't argue
" You heard the man -- let's saddle up
'  - Playing with his toys, Adam does not see Archer's icy gaze
How old is he
Five
No one knows you're his father
thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you
Bang
Bang
Bang
Startled, they turn to see Adam pointing a toy gun at them
Upset, she takes it from his hands
You know Mommy doesn't like you playing with these things
She kicks the toy aside and lifts Adam -- offering him to Archer
Awkwardly, Archer takes the boy
Archer's emotions avalanche as his grip tightens -- his big hands dwarfing the little boy's body
You're not holding him right
Caz
Archer isn't hearing Sasha
He's lost in his own memory
the sound of a
a '
a
Then Adam smiles -- perhaps the way Matthew once smiled
It pulls something up from inside Archer -- something strong
He regains control, dumping the child into Sasha's arms
He's not my son
Yes, he is --
Then something alerts Archer -- maybe the fleeting shadows that blot out the window-light for the barest second
Get down

Cindee and Fitch are caught in flagrante delicto on the floor as the kitchen is decimated by
' Coughing, Archer crawls through the roiling smoke toward the door
He's almost out when
Adam
Her wail of fear freezes Archer
He looks back -- and sees Adam in the eye of the firestorm
Archer's face betrays his conflict
child -- but his worst enemy's child
the  around Adam
Getting closer
Archer moves -- he crawls toward Adam
Just then -- a  agent rappels in through one of the shattered windows, his weapon poised
Archer kicks him hard, pitching him back through the window
Archer grabs Adam -- curling him into his body
Thinking fast, he soaks his discarded -shirt into a toppled flower vase -- then places it over Adam's face
Protecting him
He rushes to Sasha
Together, they barrel through the soft, paper wall and tear out an escape route
out the window, Fitch is riddled from outside by an agent as he  through the

Aldo's bodyguard falls, riddled, off the upper level
as one agent lands, Archer knocks his gun to the floor
They grapple
As the agent reaches for it -- Adam appears and kicks the gun away
Just like Mommy
scoops up the kicked weapon -- and cold-cocks another rappelling agent
Then she , cutting a third rappelling agent's rope
he drops hard to the floor -- unconscious
Still grappling, Archer rips off the agent's gas-mask
Buzz
Buzz's eyes reveal only hatred
He reaches for his knife
Archer hesitates, then heaves Buzz through the glass door
He pushes Adam upstairs as more agents pour in the front door
Dietrich
The painting
Dietrich sees the canvas mural above the breached front door -- and understands
He opens , cutting loose the mural
It collapses, billowing -- and enshrouds the attacking agents -- and buying time
Let's go
Archer and Sasha flee up the stairs
Sasha sees Adam huddled in the middle of the glass floor -- the shadows of agents moving below
Adam
An agent aims his shotgun at the glass floor -- at the "target" kneeling on top of it
Archer dives and grabs the boy as the up
He rolls through a shower of glass -- but comes up with Adam safely
Agents and thugs  blindly upward and downward through the floor -- desperate to hit their targets
Agents open  from the girders supporting the roof -- cutting down Fitch's last bodyguard
They're like cockroaches
Dietrich and Livia toss   into the loft -- covering their escape
Dietrich leads them to the very back of the loft
He pulls open a hidden door
If we make it, we'll meet up at my Malibu place
You remember it, Caz
Off Kanan Road --  know it
Archer hands Adam over to Sasha
She hugs her little boy -- then embraces Archer tightly
Hanging on -- near tears -- because she knows this may be the last time
Thank you, Caz
thank you
Get the boy out of here
Livia and the remaining bodyguard hustle Archer out -- - -10 poised, Livia and the bodyguard rush Archer through the deserted rotunda --
His escorts drop
Castor rushes down the staircase --  at Archer
Unarmed, Archer instantly disappears behind one of the eight columns
The columns are separated by mirrored- panels
Cat-and-mouse as Castor slips in and out between column and mirror
He spots Archer dead-ahead and  away
The   into a thousand pieces
(
) That's about a thousand years bad luck
Castor whirls, spots Archer again and
Another Sensing Archer behind him -- Castor turns and again -- this time  away his Then Archer leaps through a shattered mirror frame -- and onto Castor
They battle for control of the pistol
It's too late, Jon
Your kid loves me
And your wife's an animal
Even  can't keep up with her
They're so close Castor's whispering right in Archer's ear
Tonight 'm going to make her come like Niagara Falls -- to celebrate your death
Castor licks Archer's ear salaciously
Enraged, Archer tears the pistol from his grip and turns it on Castor
He's got Castor dead to rights -- suddenly the world around him
Archer staggers away as -- Loomis enters --  his -16 as Archer dives for a doorway
Loomis  the -16's grenade launcher
The   -- the doorway bursts into flames -- but Archer has made it through
Loomis tries to help up Castor -- who pushes him off angrily
Castor can't follow through the flames
- Archer slams out of the interior stairwell -- but force him to take cover behind the cupola
Pollux  at him from the other side
Archer   -- driving Pollux back
Stand-off
Remember me
Your 'baby brother'
Trying to get the drop, Pollux carefully crawls onto the top of the cupola
You tricked me into telling you things  never told anyone
Archer hears movement above him as Pollux reaches the crown
Now take it to your grave
Archer  his  -- into the glass cupola -- and the  beneath Pollux's feet
The cupola disintegrates beneath his weight
He plunges down into -- Castor watches in horror as Pollux pancakes onto the floor at his feet
Pollux
Pollux is almost gone
Castor looks up and sees -- Peering down into the rotunda
-- Ducks the bullets as he disappears
Castor desperately holds Pollux -- to no avail
Pollux slips away
and dies
He turns to Loomis
Get a medic -- now
Forget him, sir
It's only Pollux Troy
Castor snaps
Without hesitation, he jerks up his and  a  right in the middle of Loomis's forehead
Castor looks at the dead kid -- his rage barely abated as -- Buzz and Wanda arrive on the scene and see Loomis's body
What happened
What the fuck do you think happened
Castor Troy just shot him
(beat) What are you waiting for
Go
After Buzz and Wanda take off -- Castor gathers Pollux up in his arms -- totally devastated
- Dazed, Castor approaches his office
Kim proudly holds a copy of Time magazine
His photo is on the cover
Sir -- you're on the cover of Time
They're calling you 'An Authentic American Hero
' He just pushes by her and goes into his office
- '  - Alone -- Castor picks up the framed photo of Eve and Jamie -- staring at it with unbridled hatred
Fury rising, he crumples the frame -- and the photo -- in his clenching grip
He hurls it into other Archer family memorabilia -- shattering more photos and souvenirs
Only then does Castor notice Lazarro standing in the doorway
For how long -- he can't be sure
What is it
Lazarro shuts the door behind him
We were friends once, Jon, so feel  owe it to you -- to tell you face-to-face
(a beat) don't care how much hype you're getting -- you're through
After that massacre last night, 'm ordering a full inquiry into your recent erratic -- and deeply suspect -- behavior
Me -- 'erratic'
Victor, what are you talking about
Castor casually closes the blinds between the offices
You start meeting with Brodie and Miller
Then they die mysteriously
Your best friend is murdered -- and you don't seem to give a shit
Suddenly you're smoking, drinking, acting like a man with something to hide
(beat) Maybe you've been bought -- maybe you've lost your mind
But promise
'm going to find out
Eye to eye
Castor knows he can't finesse this one
Okay, Vic,  have a confession to make
But you aren't gonna like it
(wraps arm around neck) 'm Castor Troy
--  don't understand
Castor suddenly jabs his fist into Lazarro's chest
He pleads for mercy as Castor pounds and pounds away at his heart -- until it finally seizes up
Lazarro twitches in a death throe, then slumps to the ground
Now you understand
He punches up the intercom button
Cancel my four o'clock
(beat) And send for the paramedics
Victor Lazarro's having a heart attack
Castor fixes himself a shot of mescal
He checks his watch -- as if counting -- then kneels beside Lazarro's body
The door flies open -- and two medics rush in
They see Castor vigorously pumping Lazarro's chest -- "applying" The medics gently nudge Castor aside
One medic takes Lazarro's pulse, then shakes his head
- Castor peers down over the city
trying to collect himself
He lights up a smoke
planning his next move
His meditation is broken as a police chopper circles above
: -   - choppers circle
squad cars prowl
cops and agents set up roadblocks
The city is being sealed off
-  - Skirting a roadblock, Archer appears to be coming undone
wobbly, wild-eyed
he suddenly picks up a trash can and carries it down the street in front of his face
Pedestrians gawk at this madman
What's he doing
Archer finally stops in front of a sporting goods store
He swings the trash can
The store's An
Passersby stare at Archer for a moment -- stunned
Then several youths leap into the window and start pulling merchandise out of the store
Mayhem as others join in
clerks rush out to do battle
An  squad car hauls up onto the curb
cop leaps out and chases as the looters scatter
The driver stands at his door, radio in hand
Sensing something, he turns
just as Archer grabs the canister of Comply-Gas from the cop's belt
Archer sprays him in the face
The cop gags and sags
Archer quickly slips behind the wheel
Inside:  Archer hits a switch -- the car's tinted windows darken automatically, obscuring him from the outside
He the  --  away
- Archer slows the squad car
Up ahead:  Parked cop cars block both lanes of the main road -- a roadblock checkpoint for all traffic
Archer pulls off the road, out of sight
He flips open the portacomp and starts to type rapidly
- '   to life
All units

Proceed at once to Parthenia Street Terminal
That's Parthenia at Nordhoff

Once the armada is gone, he pulls out and heads west

He peers out from behind the garage

Archer approaches the bird feeder
Quietly, he sticks his hand inside -- and searches for the key
Just when he grabs it -- - -- an annoying hovers over Archer
The cop looks over -- but Archer is gone
All Lars sees is the bird

Wanda is shocked to see him
Commander, what are you doing here
Where should  be
(looks around) Where's everyone else
Backing you up
Didn't you track Castor to the Parthenia Street Terminal
What
You radioed in your personal security code
Nobody knows that code but you
Obviously someone else knows it
Get everybody back to their posts -- now
- Archer tiptoes through the house -- listening
He sees Cop #2 sitting at the dining room table, cleaning his pistol
He slips upstairs -- toward the sound of -- Archer walks in and steps toward the bathroom -- passing the bed
He stops
On top of the rumpled covers:  Eve's nightgown and a pair of Castor's black briefs
Overwhelmed, he sits down -- not noticing the water has stopped
Eve steps in from the bathroom
Eve
The look of horror on her face snaps him back to reality
She runs, but Archer grabs her
She struggles -- fighting and kicking him -- but somehow he keeps her mouth covered
'm not going to hurt you
Just don't scream, okay
(no response) Okay
Terrified -- she finally nods and he eases off her
know you -- you're the one who called
You're Castor Troy
You killed my son -- --  called, but 'm not Castor
'm your husband
Archer holds onto her as she struggles again
Now, you're going to listen
The last time we saw each other -- was in this room
We had a fight after  told you  had to go away
(a beat) My assignment -- Jon Archer's assignment -- was to enter a federal prison as Castor Troy
Eve is startled by this intimate information but she reveals nothing
approach the house, the cops are returning
She keeps an eye on the door
Playing for time
How did he expect to do that
An
surgeon gave me Castor's face
He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything
But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission
But not before he was transformed into me
The back   open
voice booms out
(
) Dr
Archer, are you okay
If you need hard evidence, get it
Your husband's blood type is negative
Castor's is
Archer glances at the balcony -- as   up the stairs
Eve is about to answer -- or scream
But then
Remember the parachute dream
'm falling, Eve
'm falling
The blood drains from her face as
Archer slips over the balcony and disappears
- Eve is at the computer -- dazed and disoriented
She snaps alert on hearing the front   -- Castor is giving orders to the cops guarding the house
(
) want you guys here around-the- clock
And stay off the lawn
Eve feigns interest in her laptop as Castor enters
She tenses as he starts massaging her back
You're all in knots
Maybe another date night will help you relax
Not tonight
'm way behind in my Continuing Ed
He studies Eve, then grasps her firmly by the shoulders
You think 've been acting strange
Like a completely different person
-- Yes
Okay,  have a confession to make
But you aren't going to like it
Castor wraps his hands around her slender neck
(cont'd) read your diary
've been trying to change -- trying to be more like the man you want me to be
Eve reacts to the explanation
There is a logic to it
And to prove it, 'm taking you and Jamie away on a trip -- right after the memorial service
What memorial service
Victor Lazarro had a heart seizure
right in my office
It was horrible
Oh, my God
Castor pours it on -- feigning immense grief
First Tito
now Victor
(holds her tight) please don't tell me 'm going to lose you, too
(returns the embrace) Of course not
'  - Castor slumbers fitfully
Suddenly, his shoulder twitches, rousing him
He looks up to find Eve reading beside him
What was that
What was what
Something bit me
Probably a mosquito -- 'll close the window
Eve rubs Castor's shoulder blade until he falls asleep
She gets up, closes the window, then goes into the bathroom
- Eve takes a breath, then produces a lancet from her pocket
She squeezes the lancet -- and a drop of blood splashes into a glass vial -- Castor's blood
- As Eve gets the key in her car door -- a hand grabs her
She stifles a scream -- then sees
the two
Sorry, Dr
Archer
Where are you going at this hour
There's been an emergency at the hospital
One of us will have to escort you
Fine
(a beat) But please don't wake my husband
he's exhausted
- Nothing happening here at 4
Nothing indeed
The bored Cop keeps watch outside -- as Eve hustles in
- '  - Eve paces anxiously as the    away
Please be -neg
Please
The
It reads "Male -- Type
" She buries her face in her hands -- completely stunned
(
) Thanks for believing me
Archer emerges from the darkness of her office -- but Eve pulls a pistol -- aiming it with calm authority
What are you doing
Where did you get that gun
took it from my fake husband
Why point it at me
'm the real thing
don't know that
Maybe Jon's already dead
What more proof do you need
Tell me
tell me about the all- night dentist
As Archer speaks -- Eve searches his eyes for the truth
took a date out for chicken and ribs -- not knowing she was a vegetarian
When the night couldn't get worse, she broke her tooth on a pebble that got into her three-bean salad Somehow she and  had fun driving around looking for an all-night dentist
(a beat) And even though it must have hurt -- you still kissed me
Eve slowly puts the gun down, fighting off tears
Christ, Jon
How could you put us in this position
Do you know -- do you know what he did to me
Whatever happened, whatever he did --  know it's my fault and  know can never make it up to you -- She pulls herself together -- regaining her composure
But you're damn well going to try
(a beat) First -- how are we going to get you out of this
-   - Castor wakes up and finds Eve gone
His eyes narrow as he touches the mosquito bite -- the one that isn't there
- '  - Eve sifts through the supply cabinet and finds a yellow vial
This will knock him out for hours
Good
What's his schedule tomorrow
He doesn't tell me anymore than you ever did
All  know is -- tomorrow we're going to Victor's memorial service
Victor
Tito
they both died thinking  killed them
And in a way
did
Jon -- you can't think about that now
Archer takes a breath -- and pulls himself together
-- What happens after the memorial
He's taking Jamie and me away
And neither of you will be coming back
Where's the service
Saint Mary's-By-The-Sea
Archer reacts
the irony's not lost on him
What are you going to do
Hit him with a trank dart
Once he's unconscious -- 'll try to get to Buzz and Wanda before the security team gets to me
What else can  do
Think up a good excuse
don't want you or Jamie anywhere near that service
can cover for Jamie
But if 'm not there, he'll suspect something
(as Archer considers) The second you make your move, all hell's going to break loose
If 'm there beside him --  can take charge
'm his wife, remember
(a beat) There's no way around it -- for once, you need me
Archer looks into her eyes -- the regrets flooding over
've always needed you
They embrace
soaking up each other's warmth
Jon -- what are the odds
Terrible
But it's the best we can do with what we have
(a beat) If it doesn't happen, take Jamie and don't look back
It'll happen
-- they break their embrace
Do doctors travel in packs
Only when we're golfing
- Castor and the twins round the bend -- just in time to see the door to the burn ward close
- Eve quickly wraps gauze around a patient's head -- when Castor and his boys rush in, guns leveled
Jon
What are you doing here
That's what you're going to explain to me
Didn't the police tell you
There was an emergency
Lars starts pulling at the patient's bandages
Jon -- stop it
Mr
Alandro is very ill
Not as ill as he's going to be
He blanches as Lars reveals a scarred burn victim -- Mr
Alandro
Eve is livid as she attends to the patient
Sorry
But what's a guy to think when his wife runs off in the middle of the night
It's my fault
should've woken you up before  left
(kisses him) Now please let me get back to work
They leave
Eve wipes his ugly taste from her mouth
- Castor gets into his car as he confabs with the twins
Stay here
Watch her like a hawk
Think she knows
Who cares
She's going to be dead by tonight anyway
They're all going to be dead
The wife, the kid
and the father
-   - Archer waits as Sasha appears with a long case
In the b
g
, Adam plays on the Ranch House porch with Dietrich
How's the boy
His ears are still ringing -- but he'll be okay
Archer opens the case
Inside is a sniper rifle
The truck's all gassed up
Look, Caz, there'll be
agents all over that place
Maybe can talk my brother into helping us
'Us'
No, Sasha -- believe me, this isn't your fight
He turns to leave -- but her look draws him back
He kisses her -- not passionately, but nobly
Thanks
She watches him as he walks off toward the truck
'  - Dressed in staid black, Eve joins Castor at the limo
Where's Jamie
That's what 'd like to know
She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off
Castor's eyes narrow -- trying to read Eve
Don't act so stunned, Jon
You know how hard it is to get that girl into a dress
'll deal with her later
Good
Because  am fed up
'--- - crucifix gleams in the sun
and anchoring the crucifix is
a headstone
Like so many others -- except this headstone is Matthew Archer's
And hidden behind it is -- Jon Archer
He finishes assembling the sniper rifle
For a moment he acknowledges Matthew's grave
the regrets giving way to determination
He looks down from his vantage point onto -- - - At the foot of the cemetery knoll
Rows of chairs
white flowers
mourners
yacht is docked at the breakwater
: ' peers down through scope -- seeing
Castor and Eve as they emerge from their limo
Eve glances around, searching for Archer
She comes eye- to-eye with Lars -- who is watching her every move
Archer  Castor and Eve as they sit in the front row
The ceremony begins
We are here to celebrate the life of Victor Lazarro
We all know him as a man who dedicated himself to defending this great nation -- first, as a highly decorated admiral -- then, as west coast director of the
But not all of you know what a deeply spiritual man he was
It was his wish that his Requiem Mass be performed in Latin
(a beat) In Nomine Patris, et Filii et Spiritus Sancti
Amen
The  begins to recite a beautiful and somber mass
fills the trank-dart with sedative
continues the solemn ritual
Domine, de morte aeterna, in die illa tremenda quando caeli movendi sunt et terra
checks her watch
barely lifting her eyes away
Castor absently pats her knee
She's forced to return focus to the service
chambers the dart, twists a knob on the range-finder, and carefully peers over the crucifix
Archer   the mourners -- and  Castor
As the cross-hairs neatly cube his head
We've come full circle from Matthew's death:  with Archer the sniper and Castor the target
The Priest's emotional reciting of the rites climaxes
Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine
Amen
- Archer's finger wraps around -- he starts to squeeze
- crosses behind Castor, blocking Archer's shot
Archer's finger freezes -- as the figure turns -- hair tumbling away from her face
It's Jamie
Eve stiffens as Jamie sits down
Thanks anyway, Mom -- (slides her $50) But  wanted to be here for you
and Dad
Castor reads the panic on Eve's face, but says nothing
He simply takes Jamie's hand, intertwining his fingers in hers
The honor guard steps forward, shouldering their rifles, commencing their 21-  as -- steadies himself, re-aims the sniper rifle
He hears  behind him
Someone's coming and fast
but this is his only chance
Off-balance, Archer squeezes -- The  - explodes from the barrel
Screaming toward Castor's neck -- but it goes just wide
It sinks harmlessly into the grass -- unnoticed during the 21-
Archer is cracked across the head
He slumps down, unconscious, as a silenced gun barrel gently enters his ear
As the saluting   in the b
g
-- we don't know when, or if, this pistol fires
- The honor guard presents the urn to Mrs
Lazarro
Fearful, Eve chances a glance around -- wondering what's gone wrong
The admiral's family will now take his ashes to the sea
As Mrs
Lazarro and her grown children proceed to the docked yacht, Castor touches his ear-phone
getting a message
His eyes alight on a boathouse
adjacent to the service
(into headset) Lars -- take Jamie, bring the car around, then meet us at that boathouse
Guests head for their cars
Eve seizes the moment and steps over to Wanda and Buzz
Wanda --  need to talk to you
(reads her face) Sure
what's wrong
But then Eve looks past Wanda -- and sees Lars looking at her -- tightening his "friendly" grip on Jamie's shoulder
Never mind -- Come on, baby
've got a surprise for you
Wanda and Buzz watch as they head up toward the boathouse
- Dim, deserted
Filled with boat parts, tools, etc
Castor hustles Eve inside and locks the door behind him
Lunt is there -- standing over a beaten Archer
Eve gasps
Look who we caught creeping around -- Castor Troy
Why is he here
Before  turn him in,  thought we'd pay him back for everything he's put us through
Castor starts kicking Archer
Over and over in the gut
Come on, baby
Join the fun -- Eve can't stand it
She charges Castor -- but he immediately subdues her
Too bad
Part of me was hoping you didn't know
He throws her down beside Archer
She clings to him
Did you really think it would be that easy, you dumb fucks
(to Eve) Sorry, baby
Castor Troy is about to murder you and our daughter
but  promise you won't die unavenged
This is between you and me
Leave them out of this
It was between you and me
Even your little boy -- that wasn't supposed to happen
But you couldn't let it go
No father could
Appealing to my sense of 'family' won't work, Jon
thought you knew me better than that Archer plays for time -- looking for some edge
He sees a crate filled with block-and-tackle amid the shop's tools
know some things that even you don't know, Caz
You have a son
've met him
His name is Adam
imagine 've got a dozen kids -- so what
(cocks pistol) No more head games
First your wife dies
Then your daughter
Then you
Castor smiles as the   open
Just one big happy family
But it's not Jamie and Lars
Three people emerge from the shadows, machine pistols poised
Dietrich -- Aldo -- Sasha
That's right, Archer
Now drop 'em
No options
Castor and Lunt drop their weapons
-   - Lars and Jamie pull up in the car
Lars listens to his headset -- knows something is wrong
Don't fucking move
- Sasha's at Archer's side
Caz -- are you okay
You're making a mistake
'm Castor -- he's Archer
Sasha, baby -- just give me a minute to explain
That's pathetic, Archer
But then, your terrible sense of humor is legendary
(cocks ) It's pay-back time
Aldo aims at Castor when
He's blown apart
Lars charges in --
Archer grabs a block-and-tackle as -- Lunt dives for Aldo's fallen machine-pistol
Archer swings the block-and-tackle -- whacking Lunt across the head
Castor scoops up his pistol but Eve kicks him hard in the balls
He doubles over
Archer snatches away the
Staggered -- Lunt is quickly riddled by Dietrich
Castor and Lars  at the now-scattering intruders -- driving them back amid the shot's tools and drums
Find Jamie
Eve crawls through the  toward the exit
- Among the last to leave -- Buzz and Wanda snap alert
Over the  of the  -- did Wanda hear something
- Eve rushes to the car -- it's empty
Jamie is gone
Jamie
Jamie
the  behind her
- During the   -- we  the deaths of Dietrich, Lars and Sasha : - ' being scattered at sea
Castor and Lars  Sasha
She drops
Archer back -- killing Lars and driving Castor back
Archer leans beside the mortally-wounded Sasha
Help Adam
don't let him end up like us
She dies in his arms
Wounded, Dietrich crawls over
Seeing his sister, Dietrich rises in horror
Sasha --
Castor wastes Dietrich
Archer back -- driving Castor outside
Archer pursues
- Eve runs smack into Wanda and Buzz -- they're on the run
We heard gunshots -- Wanda, 've got to tell you something
Something crazy
-   - Archer emerges into the maze of dry-docked boats
Silently checking his clip, he discards the empty gun
Castor moves stealthily through the narrow paths
Hearing a  behind him -- Castor  -- blowing apart an under-repair hull
He advances toward the boat, gun ready, when Archer appears behind him and follows -- one step, two steps -- until -- Castor stops -- then whirls as Archer leaps
The men collapse hard
Castor's pistol clatters across the yard toward the docked boat
Archer and Castor brutally strangle each other -- digging their fingers deep into their throats
They throttle each other so hard, Archer's larynx vocal chip is dislodged
His  ,  with garbled
Give up, Castor
People are going to find out
Not if  kill you first
They scramble for the gun -- but a hand reaches out from the docked boat and picks it up
Archer and Castor stop dead in their tracks because -- Jamie appears, holding the pistol
Give it here, Jamie
No, Jamie
Don't do it
Everybody gawks -- because Archer and Castor are now
Both speaking in Archer's true voice
And nobody is more confused than Jamie
Listen to my voice, Jamie
'm your father
It's a trick, Jamie
'm your father
Jamie swings the gun back and forth -- baffled
Shoot him, Jamie
Jamie
Shoot him
Jamie
Archer reels -- as a slug grazes his shoulder
Castor snatches the  from Jamie's hand
You dunce
No kid of mine would miss so badly
He aims the gun at Archer's head
(
) Hold it
Wanda and Buzz have burst onto the terrace -- their guns leveled
Eve and more agents are right behind
Just saving the taxpayers the cost of a trial
So take a hike
You're both under arrest until a test proves who's who
'm ordering you to back off
Several agents waver -- unsure
But not Wanda and Buzz
Put the gun down -- -- Now
(beat) Can't blame me for trying
He grabs a shocked Jamie -- shoving the gun under her chin
Archer struggles to his feet as -- Castor -- using Jamie as a shield -- backs out the gate to the garden
Archer follows -- cautiously
Say goodbye to Daddy -- Jamie whips out the switchblade -- sinks it into Castor's thigh and twists
She dives away
wildly, Castor staggers back through the gate
(
) You ungrateful delinquent
As Castor turns and staggers away -- he runs smack into a confused security agent
Give me your weapon -- now
The agent hands over his  -- and Castor  him
Archer and Eve make sure Jamie's okay
(to Archer) Who are you
Will someone please tell me what's going on
Archer rushes to the gate and hauls it open
limps away from the boatyard, towards the slips -- alive with sunbathers and yachters
- Castor hustles along until he finds what he's looking for -- Twin Cigarette  -- racing boats -- being   by their suntanned crews
He jumps into one of the boats
Hey --
Without even looking, Castor  the guy dead
In a flash -- Castor  up the
He sees -- ' Archer running down the dock toward the adjoining boat
-- peppering the dock
Archer knocks the boat owner to safety -- as the behind him
Archer rolls into the boat -- Castor's hit
slug grazes his shoulder
He grabs the -- taking off
the second  -- in pursuit
Castor back --  Archer's
speeds toward him -- causing a near-miss
Running parallel, Archer and Castor  at at point-blank range
Their boats smash and pound each other
police boat closes in on them
Castor  at the police -- obliterating both crew and boat
The  ' rear  into Archer's craft
Archer's  plows up and through the other
Momentum carries Archer across -- and back into the water
The boat lands right next to Castor's
Archer and Castor resume their battering
approaching a -- pulling a barge
Castor forces Archer into its path
At the last moment
Archer leaps onto the bow of Castor's boat as -- -
Archer's boat crashes into the  which swerves wildly -- trying to throw Archer off
Archer can only watch as Castor reaches for another clip
But the boat hits a wave
Castor loses the gun -- which skids away
Archer slips, his head hanging over the side
Castor tries to ram Archer, but he pulls himself up just in time
Castor grabs the anchor -- swings it
It sinks into the deck beside Archer -- but the chain is around his neck
As Castor tries to strangle him -- Archer headbutts Castor, who reels -- snagging his leg around the chain
Castor falls back -- plunging toward the water
Archer tries to hold Castor up
as the boat speeds toward -- Archer yanks Castor back onto the deck as the the pier pilings
But as they slug it out
The  careens off a piling -- and straight for the shipyard
with a shoreline obstruction -- The  , stern over bow
Archer and Castor go flying
onto the beach
- Archer and Castor lie dazed
then stir
Castor sees the pistol lying half-buried
he reaches for it
But -- Archer gets it first
He aims it at Castor as they rise
You won't shoot me, Jon
'm unarmed
Okay,  have a confession to make
but you aren't gonna like it
You're right,  won't shoot you
Not in the face anyway
-- Archer  Castor in the chest
He jerks and reels -- dropping to his knees
He looks at Archer in total disbelief
Then he sinks to the ground and lies still
Exhausted, Archer lets the empty gun drop
Then he turns and sees an  chopper heading his way
Relieved, he turns back to Castor, but -- Castor's body is gone
Castor is crawling toward the flipped boat's spinning stabilizing screw
Archer  -- hitting Castor in the leg
He buckles
but keeps going
Archer leaps on him -- they struggle as Castor tries to bury his face on the spinning blade
It'll never be over, Jon
every time you look in the mirror
you'll see my face
They struggle as the propeller blade
gets closer, closer -- slicing into "Archer's" cheek
At the last instant
Archer reaches the anchor-chain
He wraps it around the screw -- stopping the whirling blades
Castor finally sinks to the ground -- and no longer moves
Archer takes Castor's hand -- trying to tug off his wedding ring
Just when he almost has it off -- Castor suddenly grabs Archer's wrist and holds it tight
Eye contact between the two men
Castor smirks, his grasp slackening
as he finally fades away
Archer lets Castor's hand drop, then slides the ring on his own finger
The chopper lands
Buzz and Wanda rush over
You okay, Archer
What did you call me
He called you 'Archer' -- sir
Archer finally realizes -- they actually mean him
He smiles -- Jon Archer's long lost smile
- med-teams strap Archer onto a gurney
Castor's inert body is beside him
Hang on, Jon
they're bringing in their top surgical team from (re:  Castor) How is he
No life signs at all
He's a turnip
That's what they always say
He passes out as the  medics load him onto the med- evac chopper
Wanda prevents Eve from climbing aboard
'm sorry, Eve
You can't come
(to Buzz) Take her home
But he's my husband
But he works for us
Wanda gets on the med-evac chopper; it lifts off, leaving a furious Eve and a confused Jamie behind
Will Dad be Dad again
hope so, honey
And you guys say my life is screwed up
In the swirl of dust, they watch the chopper fly away
'  - Maybe days, maybe weeks later -- no way to tell
Eve is at the dining room table, catching up on medical reports
Sensing something, she looks up and sees a silhouette at the front screen door -- a man's silhouette
(
) Hello, Eve
Pulse pounding, Eve frantically pushes open the door to glimpse the face of the man with Archer's voice
It's Jon Archer
Eve stares -- then touches his face carefully, tenderly -- around the tiny residual scar
Then, she pulls him tight -- holding on for dear life
(
) Dad
Jamie is there
Archer smiles -- gently, almost sadly -- with a softness and genuineness that Castor Troy could never feel, could never fake
She rushes to him
The whole family hangs on, hugging and kissing -- for the first time ever, really together
'm sorry  shot you, Dad
Am grounded
Archer smiles and holds her tighter
But as they draw Archer inside, he hesitates
have something to ask you -- to ask both of you
He steps aside -- revealing Castor's son
This is Adam
He needs a place to live
just for a little while
Eve looks at Archer -- she sees what this means to him and, what the hell, there's plenty of time now to talk
'  -   - As the family heads inside, the door closes, shutting us out
: '   - Archer gives Adam an old teddy bear -- rocking the child until he finally drifts off into dreamland
'  - Archer watches Jamie sleep
He draws the comforter over her -- she stirs, and pulls it in tighter
- Eve gets undressed
waiting for Archer
How was your first day back
No reply
Eve hears
She approaches Archer, who's bent over the sink, washing his face
Jon
Archer stands up -- revealing Castor's face in the bathroom mirror
Eve chokes back a scream
Archer turns and faces her -- with his true face
He sees her terrified expression, turns back to the mirror -- and sees his own face looking at him
But he understands
He embraces Eve
holds her tight
She responds, happy to have him home again
We   his familiar smile and
