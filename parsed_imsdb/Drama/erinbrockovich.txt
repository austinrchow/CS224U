"Erin Brockovich", early draft, by Susannah Grant True Story by Susannah Grant February 1, 1998 ,   - Palms sway
the sun washes everything in yellow
cars motor down either side of the landscaped median
the calls of mockingbirds mingle with the   of car alarms
, a  - down the sidewalk, past the foot traffic of Southern Californians: flip-flops, Doc Marten's, Rollerblades, Nikes
then, in the middle of this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of   - struts out of a shop
So high it hurts to look at them
As the shoes leave frame, we   and see they're leaving a 99-cent store
As the Pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are connected to a pair of  ,
Eveready legs -- they just keep going and going
They saunter past two  on a lunch break
The men pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful woman
In fact, everyone this woman passes lets their eyes rest on her a microsecond longer than usual
- Two  note the  - skimming the tops of her thighs
-   spots the ,   tucked into a ,
-  -  glimpses the   of the ,   -
It isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the block that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is so goggle-eyed
Eye-catching is an understatement
All those folks who say Barbie's proportions are unrealistic have obviously never met
- side street
No pedestrians, just parked cars flaps under the wiper of an old Hyundai
Fuck
Even when she talks dirty, there's a heartland goodness to her voice
Like Kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze
As she grabs the ticket from the windshield, her sunglasses accidentally  to the ground
Shit
When she picks them up, a fingernail snags on the pavement
God damn it
She tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in
The Hyundai starts it up, signals
Then, just as it pulls slowly out into the street, a  barrels around the corner, accelerating out of the turn, and rams into the side of Erin's car, sending it  into the median
It into a foot-thick lightpost
And stops
&  - boring building on a boring block in the Valley, surrounded by strip malls
Definitely not where the power lawyers work
(
) Morning, Mr
Masry
How you doing today
& ,  - Generic
Cottage cheese ceilings, motel art
sign over the reception desk reads:  & ,
, senior partner, slumps by , his chipper receptionist, with a cup of coffee in his hand
He's in his mid-50's, compact and -- even though it's only 9  -- already rumpled
Don't ask that on Mondays, Rosalind
Whatever passion he once had for the personal injury law that is his career has long since dissipated
He trundles off toward his office
& ,  '  - Ed's secretary  -- 50's, jaded, hates her job, but what can you do
-- is on the phone when Ed rounds the corner
She puts the call on hold, turns to Ed
Tony Marvin
Oh, Jesus
Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time
His dry cleaners
You want him
What do you think
What's this
He grabs a gift-wrapped bottle off her desk, reads the card
Tequila
From your drug dealer friend
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client
He's a low-life
Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there
Ed peers into his office
It's a mess -- papers everywhere, unopened mail
Standing in the middle of the room is Erin, in a teensy, leopard-print mini-dress
As she jiggles a spike-heeled foot, everything about her shimmies gloriously
Except her head, which is held in place by a neck brace
Whoa
(to Brenda) Remind me
Erin Brockovich
Car accident
Not her fault, she says
(sarcastic) And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think
You shouldn't judge, Brenda
Right
Lap-dancers are people too
As Ed heads into his office, Brenda picks up the phone
can't find him, Tony
We'll have to call you back
& , '  - Not an office that exudes authority, and Ed's blustery entrance only adds to the sense of chaos
Erin -- hi
Sorry you had to wait
Here, sit down, sit down
He clears a stack of papers off a chair
Thanks a lot
(as she sits) tell you,  never thought just standing would take it out of me, but ever since that shithead hit me, it feels like my whole body's put together wrong
Ed gives her a look of pro-forma sympathy
Jesus, you poor thing
(he sits) Well, listen, you came to the right place
Whoever did this to you made one hell of a mistake, and you and me, we're gonna make him pay for it
He takes out a pad and paper, gets ready to write
Why don't you tell me what happened
: - Erin is on the stand, wearing the most conservative thing she owns: a red, form-fitting mini dress, telling her story to Ed, who's questioning her
was pulling out real slow, and out of nowhere, his Jaguar comes racing around the corner like a bat outta hell
She glances at the defendant's table, where a  sits nobly in surgical scrubs
His  and two beautiful are behind him
frigging Norman Rockwell painting
: They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck
didn't have insurance, so 'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now
: couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids
: Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months
: just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen
Just wanna take good care of my kids
You know
(oh so moved) Yeah
know
- Erin is still on the stand
But now the doctor's lawyer is questioning her
Seventeen thousand in debt
Whew
Is your ex-husband helping out
Which one
(feigning shock) There's more than one
Yeah
There's two
Why
Erin looks over at the jury
The personification of conservative family values
Oh, shit
: (getting defensive) not like a career, cause  had my babies
But  woulda worked, for sure, if  didn't have this neck thing
Erin sees a juror staring judgmentally at her short hem
Erin gives it a tug, pulling it down a stitch
(sarcastic) Right
No doubt
Erin sees a few jurors share dubious glances
Great
: The defendant's lawyers is on the offensive
Erin's starting to feel the case slipping away
So
You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon
(pointed) What's your point
Ed shakes his head slightly to her -- don't get mad
Broke, three kids, no job
doctor in a Jaguar must've looked like a pretty good meal ticket
Erin sees jurors nodding almost imperceptibly in agreement
She's on a sinking ship
What
Hey -- he hit me So you say
He came tearing around the corner, out of control -- An  doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control -- (erupting) That asshole smashed in my fucking neck
- The door to the courtroom flies open and Erin comes out, furious
Ed follows her as she heads for the elevator
Open and shut
Open and fucking shut If you hadn't used profanity -- Oh, please, it was long over by then
God damn, he made me look like some cheap -- told you the questions might get a little personal -- Bullshit
You told me 'd get half a million dollars
You told me 'd be set
Ed notices her ranting is starting to draw attention
Okay -- let's try and settle down here
Settle down got 74 bucks to my name, Mr
Masry
can't afford to settle down
Beat
'm sorry, Erin
Yeah
Well, fuck you
Sorry doesn't feed my kids
Erin turns away from him and heads for the stairway
'  - shitty little house in a shitty part of Northbridge
The Hyundai with a bashed-in side pulls up to the curb
Erin gets out, takes the mail from her mailbox, then heads over to the equally grim house next door and rings the bell
Hispanic woman in her 60's opens the door, holding a white baby
This is
Hi, Erin
You're back so soon
How was it
She hands Erin the baby
It's , Erin's 9-month old
Erin avoids the question by focusing on her baby
Hi, sweetie
Were you a good girl
Where are Matt and Katie
Outside with the sprinkler
So it's good
The truth is too depressing to share
It'll be fine, yeah
Ai, bueno
Because  didn't want to tell you before, with your worries -- What
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me
'm going to move in with her
You're moving away
When
Next week
(stunned) Wow, that's soon -- know
But it's good for me
Now  can help my daughter take care of my grandkids
And it's good for you, too
Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh
Not the old lady next door
Oh, God
In Erin's arms, Beth starts to
'  - Erin carries Beth up to her house
As she nears her door, she steps on a
It crunches under her sole
Ugh
Insult added to injury
She heads up to the house, dragging her shoe, wiping off the bug guts
' ,  /  - Just as dull inside
Salvation Army furniture
lot of beige
Erin's two older kids,  (7) and  (5) are at the table
Beth is in a baby seat
Erin spoons some Mac & Cheese onto their plates, trying to hide her worry
don't like this part, it's all crusty
like the crust
Erin switches the plates
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up
How come you're not eating
Cause there isn't enough food
Mamma's gonna eat later
From her baby seat on the table, Beth  some more
Thick, sick-sounding coughs
Erin looks at her
Don't go getting sick on me, baby
Okay
'  - The shower and sink are both on full, filling the room with Erin is seated with ,  Beth on her lap, trying to steam the illness out of her
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart
promise
But her face doesn't look like she believes it
- Matt and Katie are messing around with a gumball machine
,  - Erin is holding Beth, wandering the aisles
She stops at the medicines, thinks for a long moment, then, hating herself, glances to make sure no one's looking, and picks up a bottle
,    - As a  steps away from the register, Erin steps up with the bottle in her hand and smiles at the -
Hi, remember me
was in yesterday
Bought a whole mess of stuff
Round about five
- Honey, it's a zoo here at five
'm lucky if  even see a face, much less remember it
Oh, shoot, yeah,  guess that'd be tough
Well, listen,  meant to buy my baby here some medicine, and by the time  got home, realized 'd bought the adult stuff by mistake
And now, wouldn't you know, can't find the receipt
was wondering -- could  maybe exchange it anyway
' ,  - Erin feeds Beth her medicine, feeling miserable about it
Just remember
No matter what your Mamma does, lying and stealing is real bad don't ever wanna hear you doing something like that
On the table beside her sit the classifieds
Row after row of want ads circled, then -'d out in red crawls across the edge of the paper
Cause there's no excuse for it, you hear me
No excuse at all
& , '  - Midday
Ed enters with a cup of coffee in his hand
As he heads to his desk, he trips on a box of files
Coffee sloshes out of his cup, onto his shirt
Damn it
(calling out) Brenda
She pops her head in
Yeah
He grabs a tissue, swabs his shirt, then kicks at the box
What the hell is this doing here
It's those files you asked for
didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor
Jesus
Look at me
What do  have this afternoon
Nothing you can't show up for with a stain
As Ed checks his reflection in the glass wall of his office, he notices, on the other side: , standing in the middle of the secretaries' area, in a miniskirt and leather bustier, talking to , the firm's mentally challenged office boy
Mario heads away from her
What's she doing here
Who
Ed goes to his office door and waves Mario over
Hey -- Mario -- what's she doing here
She works here
Ed looks back at her -- what the hell
& ,   - The support staff -- mostly middle-aged women -- are all stealing glances at Erin
Ed comes up to her, all friendly
Erin
How's it going
Up close, the wear and tear of worry show on her face
You never called me back
left messages
You did
Wow, sorry about that
(beat) Listen, Mario's a little not so bright
He seems to think that you said -- There's two things  can't stand, Mr
Masry
Being ignored, and being lied to
You did both
Glances skitter between the secretaries -- get a load of this
Ed lowers his voice
never lied
may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but -- You said things would be fine, and they're not
'm sorry about that
Really
But -- don't need pity
need a paycheck
And 've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn
So  figure, since you're the one who said  was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me
Ed sees everyone watching him, listening
'd love to help, Erin, but 'm sorry, have a full staff right now, so -- He starts to escort her out, but she stays put
Bullshit
If you had a full staff, you'd have time to return your damn phone calls
She's backing him into a corner here
He shifts gears
Okay, look
If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does
Send in a rEsumE, make an -- 'm not everyone else, Mr
Masry
'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on
trusted you
With my kids' well-being
Now, 'm smart, and 'm hard- working, and 'll do anything
But if you think 'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming
Ed glances around the room
Not a whole lot of options here
He looks back at Erin
No benefits
& ,   - tight office lined with file cabinets and shelves
, the humorless file clerk, is showing Erin around
what we do in here is keep track of all the case files
That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that
We file 'em all here, alphabetically -- Oh, hell
(beat) 'm dyslexic
That's a joke, right
Erin shakes her head, no
Great, thinks Anna
& ,   - As Anna shows Erin around the office, they pass , the bitter office manager, and Brenda, at the coffee area
Just last week, he told my sister we weren't hiring
What's your sister look like
& , '  - Ed is packing up his office
Erin sticks her head in
Mr
Masry
He turns, sees her
Yeah
was wondering -- could you tell me who 'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck
Just -- for the weekend
Jane's the office manager
She handles payroll and petty cash
But she leaves early on Fridays
Oh
Okay
That's okay
Ed looks at her a moment, sees that it's far from okay
Oh, for Christ's sake
He takes out his wallet, looks in
All  have is hundreds
don't wanna take your money, Mr
Masry
Bullshit, you don't
He slaps a hundred in her hand and leaves
When he's gone, she looks at the bill -- her life raft -- and gives it a great big kiss
'  - Erin is at the door, taking Beth from the , a shabby, unkempt-looking woman in her 40's
Katie and Matt pull on their backpacks and troop out of the sitter's house
- Erin is leaving the store, carrying Beth in one arm and a bag of groceries in the other
Katie and Matt are each carrying a bag of groceries as well
They are all singing and moving with the jaunty step of the newly carefree
Katie spots a flower display outside the store
Mommy, can  get a flower
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch
' ,   '  - small room with Salvation Army furniture is propped in a Ragu jar on Katie's bedside table
Matt and Katie are asleep in bed
Erin looks down at them, smiles, then kisses them good-night
' ,  - Erin comes out of the bedroom and softly closes the door
But just as the handle clicks into place, the house is filled with the   of a ,  and
It sounds as if it's gonna drive through the wall
'  - Erin steps out onto her front stoop and looks over at what used to be Mrs
Morales's house
few  are parked on the lawn;    are drinking beer on the stoop; and one asshole is on his bike,
Hey
But of course he can't hear her
She walks over to him, stands right in his line of vision
He sees her and kills the engine
Everything about is tough -- his denim, his leather, his bike, his long hair
Everything but his eyes, which twinkle like Santa's
Well, hello to you, darlin'
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise
Just introducing myself to the neighbors
Well, 'm the neighbors
There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up
The guys on the porch chuckle
Erin turns and starts back to her house
George hops off his bike and follows her
Ooh, now, see, if 'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, 'da done this different
Let's start over
My name's George
What's yours
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine
Now, don't be like that
Tell you what
How about if  take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness
Erin shakes her head in disbelief and keeps walking
Come on
Gimme your number, 'll call you up proper and ask you out and everything
She stops at her porch, turns to him
You want my number
do
Which number do you want, George
You got more than one
Shit, yeah
got numbers coming out of my ears
Like, for instance, ten
Ten
Sure
That's one of my numbers
It's how many months old my little girl is
You got a little girl
Yeah
Sexy, huh
And here's another: five
That's how old my other daughter is
Seven is my son's age
Two is how many times been married and divorced
You getting all this
16 is the number of dollars in my bank account
454-3943 is my phone number
And with all the other numbers  gave you, 'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it
She turns and heads inside
He calls out after her: How the hell do you know your bank balance right off the top of your head like that
See, that impresses me
& ,   - Morning
Erin walks in, wearing her usual garb
She passes the coffee area, where Jane, Brenda, and Anna are milling
Brenda sees her, gives Anna a nudge
They both check out her short hem
Anna nudges Jane, who looks as well
Erin glances over just in time to see all three of them staring at her judgementally
She stops in her tracks and stares back
'all got something you wanna discuss
The women go back to stirring their coffees
Erin walks on
& , '  - Ed is walking into his office with a coffee cup in his hand when he trips over the same box of files again
Damn it
(calling out) Brenda
(no answer) & ,   - Erin is alone, filing as she talks on the phone
How long's she been crying like that
Well, she's got that tooth coming in -- Ed appears in the door, carrying the box of files
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on -- (sees Ed) gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- 'll check back in a bit
(hangs up) Sorry
My kid -- Where's Anna
Out to lunch with the girls
Oh
Huh
(beat) Well, look,  got this file  need valued
Real estate thing
lady has some property next to a & plant that & wants to buy
need to know what to ask for it
He plunks the box of files on her desk
She stares at it, with no idea of how to go about that
Oh
Okay
He sees her staring at the box
You do know how to do that, don't you
Yeah
got it
No problem
Good
Ed heads out, but pauses before leaving
You're a girl
Excuse me
How come you're not at lunch with the girls
You're a girl
guess 'm not the right kind
& ,   - Erin is at her desk, staring bewildered at the files from the box Ed gave her, which are now spread across her desktop
She sees Anna packing up her things, to leave
Anna
With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause 'm a little confused about how exactly we do that
(exasperated) Erin, you've been here three weeks
If you don't know how to do your job by now,  am not about to do it for you
'  - Katie and Matt are running up to the house
Erin follows, toting Beth under one arm and the box of documents under the other
She steps on another water bug
Ugh
As she wipes the bug guts off the bottom of her shoe: (
) Hey, neighbor, wanna beer
She spots George on his stoop, with a six-pack beside him
No
'mon
bought 'em for you, to make up for that night
Return 'em
Maybe you'll get your money back
He gets up and follows her to her house
Now, why're you giving me such a hard time
'm just trying to be a good neighbor
Erin turns to him
The kids are waiting at the door
had a good neighbor, George
She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free
Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that
You need help with your kids
could probably do that
George reaches out and grabs the box from under her arm
'm not gonna leave my kids with you
Why not
Cause  don't even know you
Yeah, and whose fault is that
He's got a point there
After a beat: What, you got so many friends in this world, you don't have use for one more
' ,   - George is on the floor with Matt and Katie, playing War
Katie points to the Harley emblem on his leather jacket
What's that stand for
That's for Harley Davidson
The best damn motorcycle ever made
Erin comes in from the kitchen
And if  catch either of you anywhere near one, 'll knock you silly
Go on to bed, now -- 'll come tuck you in in a minute
They get up
Night
/ Night
and head into bed
George starts cleaning up the cards
Great kids
Erin bends down to help him
Yeah
'm probably ruining them
How
'm never here
gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat
was serious before, you know
If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something --  don't have a job now, so 'm around in the afternoons
Great
Another deadbeat
'm not a deadbeat
work when  need to
Yeah
And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund
do construction, which pays real good
And  make it last by living cheap
(with a little laugh) hope that's not supposed to impress me
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you
It's been a while
Maybe 'm just out of practice
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, don't mind taking you up on it
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids
Cause  like kids
like hanging out with them
Right
She starts cleaning up the cards
do
like how they keep it all simple, you know
They don't get all complicated about life, like grown-ups do
bicycle and an ice cream cone -- boom, done, they're happy
Erin thinks about the offer
You're around every afternoon
Yup
Usually working on my bike
(she's tempted) No big deal
If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady
Tempting
Erin looks him over
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know
(with a laugh) Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we
' , '  - The wee hours
Erin's in a t-shirt, sitting on her mattress on the floor
The paperwork from the box is now spread all over the floor around her
She's reading a letter
It's from &, to Donna and Peter Irving
We see the phrases, "purchase your house
", "fair market value
" It's a list of comparable house sales in the area
Owner, cost; owner, cost
Every house is in the $65,000 range
From another room, she hears the sound of
Still reading the file, Erin gets up and goes into: ' , '  - Still reading, Erin gets Beth out of her crib
Beth quiets
' , '  - Erin lies down on the mattress and rests Beth on her chest
She sets down the file she was reading and picks up another
It contains a letter from a Dr
Howard Reeves
The first paragraph contains the phrase "
medical examination of Donna and Peter Irving
" Toward the end of the letter, there are two columns
One is headed: " "
The other: "  "
Under that head appear the following: "lymphocytes, -lymphocytes, natural killer cells,  Helpers, T8 suppresser cells"
Erin stares at it, confused
& ,   - Erin is talking to Jane, who's pouring herself coffee
It was in this real estate file 'm valuing
And -- see,  know they're the medical records from the people selling the house -- but it talks about things like lymphocytes and T8 suppressers
Erin sees Ed pass behind Jane
She lowers her voice, so he won't see her asking for help
mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- 'm just a little unclear on what those things are
thought maybe you'd know
What do  look like, Erin
library
And Jane walks away with her coffee
- Large
Looming
Very establishment
Through the windows, we see Erin at the desk, talking to a
She has the file in her hands
Over this: (
) Masry & Vititoe, can  help you
(
) Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin
Brockovich
From the file room
was wondering if you could tell Mr
Masry that 'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office
The librarian gives her directions to somewhere else
- Smaller, but still establishment
Erin's Hyundai pulls into the parking lot
- Erin is at the reference desk, eating a candy bar while she talks to the
He checks something on the computer
couple of -   pass her, double- taking
They don't see many like her around here
,  - long, academic hallway lit by fluorescents
Erin gets off an elevator and heads down the hall
She finds a door with a nameplate that reads "Jim Paulsen, Epidemiology" and
The door opens and
appears
He's a classic scientist: unruly hair, thick glasses
Nothing like Erin has ever shown up at his door
He reels at the sight of her
Dr
Paulsen
Yes
Hi, 'm Erin Brockovich
was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about --  guess they call it epidemiology
-- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it
(suspicious) Is this a joke
Did Baxter put you up to this
Who's Baxter
He did, didn't he
Baxter , another scientist, leans out of a door down the hall
Yeah
Baxter and Erin look at each other
No recognition, of course
Paulsen is immediately embarrassed
Oh
Oh
No one put me up to anything
was just hoping  could ask you a couple questions
(mortified) Of course
Oh, gosh, of course -- '  - Orderly chaos
Dr
Paulsen, still recovering, has Erin's file in his hands
Erin is sitting across from him
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, 'd say that these two people here -- what are their names
Shanna and Ashley
Right,  guess those are the kids -- They've both got some immune system problem
Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong
And these guys -- Donna and Peter -- Their parents, 'm pretty sure
Well, from what this stuff says, 'd say they both have some form of cancer
Wow
That's more serious than Erin was expecting
' ,  - on the kitchen counter
The Irvings' phone number is written on the front
(
) Whoa, whoa
Easy, easy, easy -- to see Erin, phone to her ear, grabbing a carton of juice from Matt and Katie, who are fighting over it at the table
Just as she takes it from them, the phone picks up
'  (
) Hi
You've reached the Irvings
Leave a message and we'll get back to you just as soon as we can
Bye-bye
Erin thinks a bit, then hangs up and looks at the file
Scrawled on the cover is the Irvings' address, in Hinkley, California
- The beat-up old Hyundai heads east out of blares from its speakers
,  - This is a dry, desolate part of California
No downtown, no community
Just tract after tract of arid farmland, with small, bland, unprotected ranch home cropping up out of the landscape like occasional tombstones
beat-up old sign on the road reads: ",
: " but the  corner where the number would be has broken off
As a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields, Erin turns onto Community Boulevard, the main road that cuts through Hinkley
'  - Erin looks around
The house she's passing has been razed
heap of lumber and wires in the middle of the property
As she checks the piece of paper with Donna's address, she drives by the &  , a massive gray structure of pipes, chimneys and ladders, set way back from the road
Erin passes it without noticing it
She stops at an intersection
The house on the corner has been boarded up with plywood
Erin notices it -- depressing -- then turns the corner onto Donna's street
'  - generic ranch home standing all alone in the middle of nothing
There's a pool out back and a chain link fence hugging the property
No landscaping
Dull, but clean few     wait by the door
The Hyundai pulls into the driveway and stops
Erin gets out
As she heads up to the door, her spike heels sink into the dirt
She rings the bell
It has a melody chime
opens the door
She's 35, petite, with a scrappy, high-strung manner
She's wearing tight jeans, and her dark curls are piled on top of her head
Hi
Donna Irving
Yes
'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe
(a little surprised) You're a lawyer
Hell, no
hate lawyers
just work for them
You got a minute
' ,   - The house is furnished with little money, but lots of care
Erin's on a plaid couch, in a sea of needlepoint pillows
Out back, two , ages 9 and 11, are playing in a pool
This is a real nice place you got here
(
) Well it oughta be, with all the work  put into it
She comes out from the kitchen with a tray of iced tea
added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand
Yeah
should learn to do stuff like that
They make the place feel real homey
Donna corrects the positioning on a couple of pillows
Thank you
think so too
That's why 'm being such a stickler on this house price thing
don't mean to be a pain in &'s backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but  look around here and think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it
And  don't just mean pay for the house; 'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over
Right
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains
Honest to God,  don't know if have the energy
You know, 've been sick
Me and Peter both have
Yeah, 'm real glad you brought that up was going through your file here, and  ran into these medical records
They kinda surprised me -- This would be the perfect opportunity for many to get self- pitying
But not Donna
Life's handed her a shitload of lemons, and darned if she hasn't made a shitload of lemonade
know
They're more than a bit unusual
See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease
That's a kind of cancer -- Yeah, 'm real sorry to hear that
Thank you
It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know
And then while that's going on,  end up having to have a hysterectomy
Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts
All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you
'll say
Holy moley
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, 'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly,  just don't see the point
Yeah,  can see that
(beat) guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff
Donna tops off their iced teas
Are you kidding
With how our lives are, if start subdividing files, 'll be sunk just kept all & correspondence in one place
Right, but -- 'm sorry,  don't see why you were corresponding with & about it in the first place
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit
They did
You bet
Paid for a check-up for the whole family
And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either
They just took care of it
Just like that
We never even saw a bill
Wow
Why would they do that
Cause of the chromium
The what
The chromium
Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off
,  - , with " " scrawled on it
(
) & came around a few years ago, told us they put chromium in our well by mistake
And since we shouldn't have to drink it if we don't want to, they gave us free spring water and offered to buy our house
to see Donna pulling the box down into the room
What's chromium
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick -- thought the same thing, right off the bat
That's why we went to see the doctor
But hunh-uh
Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other
She rifles through the box
This is the info they gave us
You'll see if you look through it, chromium's good for you
When  saw what they charged for it at the health-food stores,  about fainted
She hands Erin a printed fact sheet
Erin scans it
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick
Not around here
This is a rough part of the world
Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck
(beat) It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this
Heck, even our dogs up and die
'  - Erin's driving away from Donna's house
street lamp throws light on the box of chromium documents in the passenger seat
She gets to an intersection and looks across the street at the massive
Six stories high, lit up like a Christmas tree, with all sizes of  criss-crossing the outside and    sticking up out of it
Far more massive than anything else in town, it looms over the horizon like the Capitol in
or St
Peter's in Rome
Erin takes a long look at the compressor station, then turns onto Community Boulevard and drives away
' ,  - Erin is holding Beth, making her a bottle, when she hears coming from outside
She follows them
'  - Erin opens the door to find George attaching bars to her windows
What're you doing
Better safe than sorry
She shakes her head, amused by his persistence
You want some coffee, George
' ,  - George follows Erin in
'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too
This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know
Thanks for reminding me
guess we get what we pay for, huh
Erin pours him some coffee, hands it to him
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this
What do you mean
George settles in, helps himself to sugar
was talking to this lady -- she and her husband both got cancer, and she thinks it's cause they live in a bad neighborhood
You think that's possible
That living in a bad neighborhood could give you cancer
George laughs a little at the thought
Man,  hope not
You got enough damn problems
But Erin's still mulling it over
, '  - Erin clips down the block in short-shorts and high-heeled boots
Up ahead a few of ---  are out on a stoop, drinking their breakfast
Erin approaches them
Hi, y'all -- how you doing today
1 Hangin' in, baby
How about yourself
'm okay, 'm just fine
was wondering -- could  maybe ask you a couple questions
She settles down on the stoop with them for a chat
'  - Dr
Paulsen and Erin are sitting, talking
He's thrilled to have her back in his office
and when  realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley,  thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too
So  went and asked
(surprised) You did
Erin digs a pad of paper out of her bag
Uh-huh
Spent the last few days knocking on doors
And you know what
They're not
(reads from the pad) mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff
And their pets are fine
So don't know --  just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise
Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at
Paulsen reaches for a notepad, scrawls on it
,  - Paulsen is seeing Erin out of his office
gotta say, Erin -- first time  saw you, did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study
Don't go telling anyone
It'll ruin my reputation
- Erin towers over   as she walks across campus with him
He's the grittier variety of scientist: Patagonia, Birkenstocks, bushy beard
He's as dry as dust, and as much as Dr
Paulsen responded to Erin, Frankel barely notices her
What kind of chromium is it
There's more than one kind
Yes
There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body
There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful
Harmful, like -- how
What would you get
With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer
He rattles it off coolly
Just facts
Erin's stunned
So that stuff -- it kills people
Oh, yeah
Definitely
Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic
Bad, bad stuff
Well, how do  find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley
Have you been to the water board
Hunh-uh
What's that
Every county has one
They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction
You should be able to find something there
County water board
All righty, thanks
Good luck
(beat) Oh --  wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if  were you
His line continues over: - Erin's Hyundai pulls up and stops in a cloud of dust
(
) Incriminating records have a way of disappearing when people smell trouble
Erin hops out, checks her reflection in the side-view mirror, then heads into the building
- Drab, government-issue
, the bored desk clerk is thumbing his way through  &
Just as he stops to stare at a motor oil ad in which a buxom blonde is straddling the hood of a car, the huge door opens and Erin enters
Whew
God damn , that's a heavy door
Ross looks up
It's like the girl from the ad walked right off the page
He jumps up, to help her with the door
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there
Thank you very much
Aren't you a gentleman
Mr
Ross
Ross
Real pleased to meet you
'm Erin
She smiles
He can't believe his luck
Erin
Cool
What can  do for you, Erin
Well, believe it or not,  am on the prowl for some water records
(with a laugh) You come to the right place
(laughing along) guess  did
You just tell me what you want to look at and 'll be glad to dig 'em out for you
wish  knew
It's for my boss
He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places
The easiest thing would probably be if  just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself
Would that be okay
Heck, yeah
Come on back
Just gonna need you to sign in here -- He hands her a pen
He reads over her shoulder as she signs her name -- Erin Pattee Brockovich
Pattee
That your middle name
Nope
Maiden
(disappointed) You're married
Not anymore
She smiles and winks at him, then goes around the counter with him and looks at the stacks and stacks of files
Well
Here goes nothing
She heads down an aisle, reading the spines of the files
They're all town names -- Barstow, Victorville, Oro Grande, Helendale -- in no particular order
Finally, Erin spots one that says Hinkley
She pulls it down
are pages and pages of Xeroxed memoranda, letters, charts, graphs, handwritten notes
All shoved in willy-nilly
' ,   - George is watching a football game on
He's just put dinners on the floor in front of the Matt and Katie
Our mom gives us sandwiches on Fridays
That's a sandwich
No, it's not
Sure it is
Here, 'll show you
He picks up Matt's chicken, tears it in two
Most people think a sandwich's gotta have bread on the outside
Not true
Chicken is a perfectly good outside for a sandwich
then places the broccoli neatly between the halves
See
Katie and Matthew look at it, then up at George, and smile
This guy just might be all right, after all
- It's gotten dark
Erin's Hyundai's still there
- Erin is on the floor, her legs stretched out in front of her
She has a bunch of files open and spread across the floor
The one in her hand has caught her attention
It's a memo titled "-   " from the water board to &
Erin is concentrating hard on it, reading laboriously to herself
(
) "
On December 7, 1987, the discharger notified the regional board and the San Bernardino County Environmental Health Services of the discovery of 0
58 ppm of hexavalent chromium in an on-site ground water monitoring well
" (beat) hexavalent
& ,  - to see it is on top of a stack of papers that Erin is carrying as she enters the office
She has an efficient air about her -- a sense of purpose
& ,   - Erin swoops in, ready to work, only to find her desk cleared off
She turns to Anna, who's already hard at work
Where's my stuff
Anna looks up
Where've you been
What the fuck did you do with my stuff
Don't use language with me -- But Erin's out the door before Anna can finish her sentence
& , '  - is at her desk
Erin barrels in
Someone stole my stuff
Nice to see you, Erin
We've missed you
had photos of my kids, plus a mug -- Jane reaches under her desk for a box, looks through it
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose
Here
What's going on
There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them
Here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay
She hands her the box
Erin doesn't take it
've been working
Shit, that's all 've been doing
Ask Mr
Masry
He knows
& , '  - Ed's at his desk, dialing the phone when Erin barrels in
You said to fire me
He sets down the receiver
Erin, you've been gone for a week
left a message
've been dealing with that real estate thing
was gonna write up a whole damn report and -- That's not how we work here
You don't just leave a message and take off
Jane follows her in, still carrying the box of stuff
What am  supposed to do, check in every two seconds
Yes
It's called accountability
am not talking to you, bitch
Excuse me Okay, enough -- (beat) Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, don't think this is the right place for you
So what 'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf
Find you something else, okay
Don't bother
She turns to Jane, takes her box, and heads out
Come on, 'm trying to help here
Bullshit
You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed
Fuck if 'll help you do that
And she leaves
& ,  '  - As Erin heads for the door, pleased glances fly from secretary to secretary
Erin reaches the door, but can't open it with the box in her arms
She turns to the room
don't suppose any one of you cunts could open the fucking door for me
'  - Erin's Hyundai rumbles to a stop in front of the house
Erin shoves open the creaky, reluctant door, lifts her box of stuff off the seat, and gets out
As she walks around the car and toward the house, she runs into the
He hands her a packet of mail
Here ya go, Miz Brockovich
Erin looks at the top of the stack
It's the electric bill
' ,   - Erin enters, puts down the box and stares at the mail
Bills, bills, and more bills
As she throws them on the table, she sees George coming out of the kitchen
What are you doing here
Fixing a leak under your sink
She heads into the kitchen, weary and irritated
didn't ask you to do that
Damn it, George,  don't ask you to do things like that
' ,  - Erin enters, sees all the cleaning stuff from under the sink is spread around the kitchen floor
tool box lies open
Great
'm gonna clean it up
Erin gets down on her knees and starts putting things away
Relax, Erin, 'll do it -- 'm not -- Before he can finish, a huge   runs onto Erin's hand
Ugh -- Jesus -- She jumps and brushes it off
Yeah -- you had a whole family of those things hanging out back there
She takes off her shoe and smacks at the bug, missing it
Damn it -- The bug skitters away from her, along the floorboard
Erin chases it, smacking at it repeatedly, missing it every time
Don't worry about it, 'll get it later
But Erin keeps after it, corralling all her frustrations into killing that one bug
Come here, you little motherfucker -- The bug crawls up onto the table, zipping behind the salt, the pepper, the napkin holder
Erin keeps after it, the table harder and harder with each  of her shoe
Hey, whoa -- relax -- The salt and pepper skid off the table
The napkins fly from their holder
Just as Erin's about to nail the bug, it slips into a crack in the wall and disappears
Erin hurls her shoe at the crack
It  into the wall
As Erin stands there staring at the wall, her breath starts to come heavily -- those deep breaths that precede tears
She slowly slides down into a chair, defeat overcoming her
(almost a whisper) God damn it
She looks around at her for-shit kitchen and starts to cry
What kind of person lives like this
Huh
What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats
It's a simple thing
Everybody gets them
All we gotta do is call an exterminator
can't call an exterminator
can't afford one
God,  can't even afford my phone (beat) got fired
What
But you been working so hard -- Doesn't matter
Doesn't make one bit of difference
(then, fragile) Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me
How'd  end up so
so nothing George picks a napkin up off the floor, hands it to her
You're not nothing, Erin
Well, 'm sure as hell not what  thought was gonna be
was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect
mean, hell --  was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes
Did  tell you that
You live next door to a real live beauty queen
(wipes her nose) still got the tiara
kept it cause thought it meant something
thought it meant  was gonna do something great with my life
thought it proved  was gonna grow up to be someone
You are someone
No 'm not
Look at me
'm not
You're someone to me
(beat) You're someone real special to me
He takes a step toward her and kneels in front of her, very close
He takes her shoe from her hand and puts it back on her foot
Then he takes her hands in his and kisses them
'm no good, George
make people miserable
But he kisses her anyway
And for the first time in so long, she feels like something other than a failure
He pulls her into him, and she lets herself be pulled
' , '  - Erin and George are in bed, naked, curled around each other
Man
Even your earlobes are beautiful
He kisses one
Don't be too nice to me, okay
It makes me nervous
& , '  - Ed is at his desk
The
And
And
Brenda
(no answer) Nothing
Ed growls in frustration, then gets the phone
Yeah, Ed Masry here
She doesn't work here anymore
Who's this
' ,  - , where Beth is bobbing in her baby chair
On one side of her is a heap of bills with " " and " " stamped on them
On the other, the well- thumbed  , with circles and 's all over it
The  rings
Erin swoops in and picks up Beth
Come on, baby
Maybe that's Ed McMahon
' ,   - Erin carries Beth over to the front door, spies through the peephole, and sees Ed standing there
She opens the door
What are you doing here
got an interesting call this afternoon
It was from a Dr
Frankel
Oh, yeah
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is
05 parts per million
And that at the rate you mentioned,
58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about
The Irvings
Well, that was nice of him
Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax
Look, 'm sorry
You were gone
just assumed you were off having fun
Now, why in the hell would you assume that
don't know
Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun
Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people
Ed takes a beat, copping to the charge
So what's the story on this thing
This cancer stuff
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back got a lot of bills to pay
He glares at her
Realizes he has no choice
Fine
' ,   - Erin has let Ed in
They're sitting
But, & told her about the chromium
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause  talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad
So what made you think it was
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong
What medical records
The ones in the box of files
(off Ed's blank look) The box of files
The one from your office
didn't see any medical records in there
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh
(to herself) And you fired me Jesus
Ed thinks for a moment
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you
Course  did
Lemme see it, will you
Before getting it for him, she looks at him, weighs her odds
want a raise
And benefits
Including dental
Look, Erin, this is not the way  do business, this extortion nonsense
Erin doesn't budge
Okay
5% raise, and -- Ten
(off his look) There's a lot of other places  could work
ten percent raise and benefits
But that's it
'm drawing the line
She goes to her box of stuff from the office and digs out the document for him
He scans it
This is the only thing you found
So far
But that place is a pig sty wouldn't be surprised if there's more
Find out
10  - Erin's Hyundai zips along the freeway
"Funky Town" is blaring from the tinny stereo
Over it: (
) hate this music
- Erin's driving
Matthew's in the front seat
Katie and Beth (in a car seat) are in the back
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town
It's impossible
Well  hate it
hate it too
hate this trip
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure
We're going someplace you never been before
'm gonna hate it
Me too
She glances at them, frowns a little
You know what 'm realizing for the first time
You kids are a couple of downers mean, you are the real thing -- a couple of honest-to-God depresso-types
(small smile) Who in the heck raised you, anyway
Some kind of moron
Katie smiles a little
She likes this side of her mom
Yeah
real moron
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo,  bet
(also smiling) Yeah
Thank God we got you away from her, huh
By now they're all smiling
Funky Town plays on
&   - The Hyundai is parked at the entrance to the station, by a row of dead trees
Erin is standing beside a sign that says "Private Property
No Trespassing", taking pictures of the massive structure in the distance
Matthew, Katie, and Beth are drawing in the dirt with sticks
Stay out of the road
'll be right back
She wanders up the drive, onto & property, moving around the plant, taking pictures of it from every possible angle
As she wanders over a big, flat, dry field to the side of the plant, she glances over her shoulder to check on her kids and notices the trail she made in the dirt has a greenish hue
She looks at the dirt right her feet
Kicks the ground
Below the surface, the dirt turns from brown to green
Erin notes this, then looks back at her kids playing in the dirt
Worry comes over her face
She heads back to them
- The kids are waiting at the car
Erin comes out of the store with a bottle of water and uses it to rinse off their hands
- The sound of a
The Hyundai's parked in front
(
) 'm hungry
- Erin is at the Xerox machine, copying a file while she tries to calm Beth
There's a stack of files on the nearby table
Matthew and Katie are flopping around on the floor
We'll go eat in a minute
Settle down
Whining, fussing
Ross goes over to her
You know what, Erin
got nothing but time here
Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner
Ross -- you are an absolute angel
She hands Ross the
& , '  - Ed comes in in the morning, and without pausing, hands Brenda a copy of the   , with a Post-it on the top
Fax these to this number, okay
All of 'em
All of them
He continues into his office and closes the door
Brenda types in the number
The recipient's
comes up on the : &
,   - Another copy of those , now in Donna's hands
She's on her couch with Erin, reading them
Outside, Donna's two daughters are playing in the pool
She reads the last page and looks up at Erin, bewildered
An on-site monitoring well
That means -- It was right up on the & property over there
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous
Yeah
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay
The guys from & told me
They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine
know
But the toxicologist  been talking to
He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure
And everything you all have is on that list
Donna resists this idea hard
No
Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said
He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by &
Donna sits quietly, trying to make sense of this
The only sound is the  and  from the pool out back
Then, gradually, Donna realizes what it is she's hearing -- her kids playing in toxic water
She jumps up
and runs out to the pool
Erin follows her
'  - From the door, Erin watches Donna run to the edge of the pool in a frantic response to this news
, , How come
, ' ,
Erin watches compassionately as Donna flails to get her kids out of the contaminated water
& , '  - It's morning
Ed is checking the lie of his tie in his reflection in the window
Erin is on his couch, high-heeled legs stretched out in front of her
& , '  - Jane is delivering paychecks
When Brenda gets to her desk, Jane tips her head toward Ed's office, as if to say, check it out
Brenda peers in and sees Erin
What's she doing here
He hired her back
With a raise
What
Why Well, let's see
It's not cause she's smart, and it's not cause she's professional
That leaves
Brenda's stunned
Takes a beat
Makes assumptions
And dumb old me thought working hard and being loyal was the way to get ahead
'  - Ed is still checking his reflection
'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- 'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- & claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting
So you think we got 'em scared
It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice
Brenda pops her head in, ignores Erin
David Baum from & is at reception
Erin feels the chill Brenda's sending her way
Nice to see you again, too, Brenda
Brenda leaves without acknowledging Erin
& ,   - Ed and Erin come out and see   waiting at reception
Forget law school, this kid looks like he's just out of twelfth grade
Not a hair on his chin
His suit and shoes look brand new
Not to question your judgment or anything, Mr
Masry, but -- that doesn't exactly look like sitting up and taking notice to me
& ,   - Ed and Erin are seated across the table from Baum
To say this kid lacks authority is a gross understatement
He doesn't talk; he squeaks
in the interest of putting this whole thing to rest, & is willing to offer the Irvings 250,000 dollars for their home
Ed laughs a little in disbelief
250,000
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr
Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price
What about in terms of medical expenses
250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors
understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies
But that's not &'s fault
You're kidding, right
(Baum doesn't answer) Look at these readings for Christ's sake
&'s own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions
Ed shoves them across the table
Baum doesn't look at them
Everything the Irvings have had is a proven reaction to exposure to hexavalent chromium
They've had
He stalls a moment
Erin jumps in
-- breast cysts, uterine cancer, Hodgkin's disease, immune deficiencies, asthma, chronic nosebleeds
Despite their persuasiveness, Baum parrots what is obviously the party line: million things could have caused those problems
Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle
Our offer is final and more than fair
Wait a minute --  thought we were negotiating here
250,000 is all 'm authorized to offer
Ed looks across at this pissant little kid
(to himself) Jesus Christ
(he stands, to leave) will present your offer to my clients doubt they'll accept it
As Ed starts out: Mr
Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here
& is a 28- billion dollar corporation
(containing his anger) Thanks
'll keep it in mind
And Ed leaves the conference room
Erin follows him out
& ,   - Erin follows Ed as he stomps back to his office
At least they made an offer
That wasn't an offer
million would've been an offer
When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you
don't get why they'd do that
Because they can
You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal
They can afford to waste all the time in the world
And you can't
What, you think 'm made of money
Behind them, Baum steps out of the conference room
Hey, you know where  can get a cab
My plane leaves Burbank in forty-five minutes
Ed turns and looks at him
He gets a tiny smile
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them  said Mario should take you to the airport
Hey, excellent
Thanks
Baum heads out to the reception area
Mr
Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom
They'll be driving around the valley for hours
(gleeful) Yeah
Isn't that a shame
She watches him go into his office, impressed
Big smile
Well 'll be God damned
& ,  '  - End of the day
Most everyone has left
Erin is at her new work space near Ed's office
She's poring over a fat file of documents
wanders by with her coat on
You've been reading for hours
'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that  look at the word "dog" and see "god"
Hey, just so long as you see Him
Rosalind turns on Erin's desk lamp and heads out
Outside the big glass office doors, Rosalind stops to talk to a lost-looking    -30's
These are  and He's a security guard uniform, with an envelope under his arm
Rosalind points to Erin
The Browns enter the office and approach her
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich
Yeah
Who are you
'm Tom Brown
This is my wife Mandy
We used to live across the street from the Irvings
& bought our house last year
'  - photos of chickens, each with a twisted, limp neck
It's called wry neck
It's when they're born without any muscles in the neck
to see Erin looking at them with Tom and Mandy
Wow
How many were born like this
Twelve, maybe thirteen
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too
It sure could, yeah
Thanks a lot
She tucks them into a file, as if that's it
There's something else, too
What
Well
Mandy here's had nine miscarriages
Are you kidding
My God -- know
It's an awful lot
'm surprised Donna didn't say anything
She doesn't know
No one does
It's not something you want to talk about, you know
figured it musta been something  did, like when  smoked marijuana, maybe
Or took birth control pills
But then Donna told me you thought this chromium might be to blame for her problems, so  figured
' ,   '  - Matt and Katie are in bed, with the light off
Erin comes in, quietly, in clothes from work
Hey
You guys still awake
They're awake and pissed
Come on, now
No faking
George told me he just shut out the light a few seconds ago
They still don't answer
She comes in and sits on a bed
Look,  know you're mad
But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and  gotta deal with them
Now  don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes
It happens all the time
That's not true; we had dinner together just last night
You were reading the whole time
He's got a point there
Erin feels like shit
'm sorry, pumpkins
'll try a whole lot harder to be around, okay
promise
' ,  - The room is dark
Erin enters and flops down onto the bed, exhausted
George is lying on the bed next to her
If it's any consolation, love you
10,   - Dry, flat California
Ed's big old Mercedes is toodling down the freeway, at an overly safe, almost-geriatric speed
'  - Frank Sinatra is playing on the stereo
Ed is swaying in time
This is his kind of music
He smiles, looks at Erin
It's Sinatra's world, we just live in it
Whatever
Erin glances at the speedometer
Oy
So slow
His car phone rings
He picks it up
Hello
(his voice softens) Hi, babys
Baby's fine
Yes,  did did, too, you just didn't feel it
He starts swerving across the lane markers Ed doesn't notice
Erin's getting nervous
You think  could leave without kissing my babys
Okay, here you go
He kisses into the phone
Swerves
car barely misses them
Erin's eyes widen
Not fun at all
Bye-bye
bye-bye
no, you
Okay, together
Bye-bye
He finally hangs up, smiling to himself
Erin clears her throat
Um -- you mind pulling over
Just -- for a second
- The Mercedes pulls to a stop on the shoulder
Erin gets out, walks around to the driver's side
Opens the door
First of all, don't talk baby talk to your wife in front of me
It really undermines your authority
And second,  know you're my boss and all, but you are the worst fucking driver 've ever seen
Move over or quit
He moves over
She gets in, turns off the Sinatra
They pull back out onto the freeway in silence
'  - The Mercedes and a truck are parked out front
(
) There's something about this whole thing don't quite understand, Mr
Masry
' ,   - Donna and Pete Irving, and Mandy and Roy Brown are all seated, sipping iced tea
While they talk, Erin hands them all information packets on chromium
Ed is standing in front of them, a little stiff
If & messed with our water, why would they bother saying anything about it to us
Why not just keep quiet about it
To establish a statute of limitations
See, in a case like this, you only have a year from the time you first learn about the problem to file suit
So & figures, we'll let the cat out of the bag -- tell the people the water's not perfect; if we can ride out the year with no one suing, we'll be in the clear forever
But it was more than a year ago that they told us -- It's okay
We're not suing
All we're doing is using this information to get you a real nice purchase price on your house, and get you two -- (to the Browns) -- a comparable retroactive bonus added to your sale price
This way, and & can still look good to their shareholders, cause they're not involved in an ugly lawsuit; all they're doing is buying a little property
Roy looks up from his retainer agreement
It doesn't say here how much this whole thing's gonna cost us
My fee's forty percent of whatever you get awarded
Erin watches them look around at each other, stunned by the figure
Boy, do  know how you feel
First time heard that number,  said you got to be kidding me
Forty God damn percent
Erin -- 'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward
Erin -- Erin's enjoying Ed's discomfort almost too much to stop
But just almost
She shifts gears
Then  asked him how much he makes if didn't get anything
They look at Ed
Well
Then  don't get anything either
And  realized, he's taking a chance too
When they hear this, and realize he's in it with them, they all reach for their pens and sign
They hand the agreements over to Erin, who takes them across the room to Ed
He stuffs them in his briefcase and closes it up
That's that
All right, then
Let's hit the road
Boy
Cold as ice
Erin stares at him, stunned by his brusque manner, then leans in to him, close
(whispering) Mr
Masry, if you don't mind my saying, you got a lot to learn about being friendly
These people just hired you as their lawyer
The least you could do is make a little pleasant conversation
She gives him a stern look, then turns toward the women
Donna, let me help you clean all this up
She picks up a tray of iced tea and cookies and heads to the kitchen
Donna and Mandy follow, leaving Ed alone with Pete and Roy
He stands there, awkwardly
Then, finally: So, what's, uh
what's new
'  - Erin and Donna are putting away the cleaned glasses
Mandy is scanning the chromium pamphlet Erin gave her
You know that thing it says in here about rashes
Uh-huh
Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other
just figured it was something in the genes
And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that
Erin listens, interested
,  - Another day
, 40's and gruff, is in the barn, tossing hay around
(
) Excuse me
Are you Mr
Linwood
He sees Erin picking her way toward him in her high-heels
Yeah
'm Erin Brockovich
work at the law firm that represents your former neighbors the Browns
They suggested  give you a call
She steps in a cow patty
Laughs at herself good-naturedly
Boy howdy, did  ever wear the wrong shoes
'  - that reads:  , hanging on the side of a small, paint-chipped house
Erin is at the door talking to  , 65, who's wearing a big cross at her breast
and Mr
Linwood seemed to think that your husband had been sick as well
Yes, Mr
DeSoto has lung cancer
Never smoked a day in his life, neither
'  - Erin is talking to  and   -- 30's
Solid, family folks
But Laura's left brow and cheekbone look swollen and misshapen, and she's trying to hide the fact that she's in a lot of pain
Mrs
DeSoto said she wasn't sure exactly what it was that you had -- She's not alone on that one
Well, they know what it is -- it's called fibrous dysplasia -- The bones start growing again
Gives her headaches like you wouldn't believe
-- they just don't know what caused it
'  - Erin is talking to
Their daughter , 10, is sitting on the couch, wrapped in a blanket
then Mike Ambrosino remembered seeing you folks at the hospital from time to time too, so  thought 'd just stop by
(to Annabelle) You must be Annabelle
Uh-huh
Whew, are you ever a beauty
mean, you must drive those boys crazy
Annabelle smiles a little
' , '  - Late night
George rolls over -- Erin's side of the bed is empty
He checks the clock, then gets up and heads into: ' ,  - He peers around and spots her, sitting in the little kid's chair in Matthew and Katie's room
Erin is holding Beth, watching Matt and Katie sleep
Erin hears the floor creak as George steps into the doorway
Tell me something, George
What kind of God lets a beautiful little 10-year-old girl get brain cancer
Isn't He supposed to be in charge of stuff like that
Make sure it doesn't happen
(beat) swear, any other job, He'd be fired
- Ed and Erin are walking down the street, take-out coffee cups in their hands
Ed is sipping his, but Erin is in too much of a lather to drink hers
Hunh-uh
Absolutely not
That's crazy -- why not
Because  said no
Look -- the only reason &'s even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute
We add plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem -- against a massive utility
No, thank you
They go into their office building
- Erin and Ed are riding up
Okay, so here's what 'll do
'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- 'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard
It's not about working hard -- Bullshit
-- It's about being realistic
Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever
They're a huge corporation
They'd completely bury us in paperwork
'm just one guy with a shitty little
firm
-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it
The doors open
Ed gets off
Erin follows
,  - Erin's dogging Ed down the hall, to the office
And this shit is bad news, Mr
Masry
Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your , too
That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids -- know how  works, Erin -- He gets to the Masry & Vititoe doors
Opens them
&  - Erin tails Ed back to his office
We can get these people
With a little effort,  really think we can nail their asses to the wall
Oh, you do
With all your legal expertise, you believe that
Okay, fine
don't know shit about shit
But  know the difference -- He shuts his office door on her
--
'  - Ed goes over to his desk, sits down
He sees a stack of messages there, starts flipping through them
Then he stops
Damn it
He shoves the messages aside and puts his head in his hands
He sits like that for a moment,  to himself
Then he pushes himself up and heads over to his door
When he opens it, he finds Erin still standing there, exactly where he left her, arms crossed
She hasn't budged
How many families we talking about here
Four more
Eleven people
So far
You think there's more
Well --  found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967
hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then
Ed pauses, groans again, realizing what decision he's making
This is a whole different ball game, Erin
much bigger deal
Kinda like David and what's-his-name
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family
(heavy sigh) Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- 'll do it
'll take it on
She smiles victoriously
You're doing the right thing, Mr
Masry
Yeah, yeah
Remind me of that when 'm filing for bankruptcy
He heads back to his desk
Erin follows him into his office
Course, gathering evidence -- now, that's a big job
hell of a lot bigger than just filing
'm gonna be working a lot harder now, taking on a lot more responsibility
He gives her a look
Knows what's coming
What now
Another raise wouldn't hurt
And with all the time 'm gonna be spending on the road, 'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't
''  - as Erin tries to program numbers into its speed dial to see she is reading from the phone's manual as she enters Toys '' Us with George, Matthew, Katie and Beth
You each can pick out four things
But nothing huge
Look at the price
Nothing crazy
Matthew and Katie fan out into the store
Erin keeps messing with the phone
You can buy 'em all the toys you want, but come Monday, when you split again, they're still gonna be pissed
Erin looks over at him, weary
George,  am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off
Could you please not give me a hard time about it
One toy per kid is doing something nice
Four is
something else
Well, hell,  guess that's it, then, huh
They're scarred for life
They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now
'm just saying -- (with intensity) know what you're saying, and  don't wanna hear it
am doing the best  can
And she walks away from him
,   - Erin, in high heels and miniskirt, is straddling a ditch, scooping clumps of gunky moss from the ditch into plastic containers
Over this: (
) Dr
Frankel, it's Erin Brockovich
Tell me something: if  wanna find as much evidence of hexavalent chromium contamination as possibly can, what should  do
As Erin labels the containers, her heels slide down the side of the ditch, and she lands smack in it, knee-deep in gunk
,   - Erin, now completely dirty, is climbing over a fence marked "No Trespassing"
Her arms are full of more containers
(
) Well, what you have to remember is, if you have hex chrom in the water, you have it in anything that lived off the water
She adds them to a growing collection of containers in the trunk of her car
,       - Another day
This time it's
Erin minces her way down to the deep end of the pool in her spike heels
(
) What 'd do is start a collection
Anything that existed in water, on water, under water She gets to the deep end and scoops up a Ziploc full of rancid pool water and seals it
(
) anything that had water flow over or under it
Erin spots a few dead frogs in the water
She picks one up by the leg, and seals it in a plastic bag as well
- With a sample cup held in her teeth, Erin hauls herself up over the well's concrete wall, then, with her back against one side of the well and her feet against the other, starts shimmying down the well
(
) anything that had water pass through it
she winces at the algae and gook that's clinging to her as she descends to the water level
When she's low enough, she takes the sample cup from her teeth and scoops up the water
& , '  - Erin's at her desk, bending over her notebook in a miniskirt, adding reports to the  binder
(
) collect 'em, label 'em, then bring 'em to me
'll analyze 'em, see what we got
: We catch a few words: "water sample
", "soil sample
", "frog sample
", "
traces of hexavalent
" Brenda looks at Erin and sees her hem rising in the back
For God's sake, Erin,  can see your panties
Erin turns to Brenda, relishing the chance to irritate her
Liar
'm not wearing any
Ed, in his office, laughs
He's starting to like this gal
'  - It's a hot night
George is playing on the floor with the kids
Erin is behind them on the couch, laboriously reading a book labeled, simply,
The phone
Erin picks it up
Hello
(
) Is this the Erin Pattee Brockovich that's been snooping around the water board
His voice is flat, creepy
Not friendly
Yes
Who's this
Erin stares at the phone, freaked
' ,   - George watches Erin double-checking the locks on the door
'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George
Come on, Erin
job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger
'm not in danger
have a dead bolt
Remember
She goes to the living room, double-checks the window locks in there
George follows
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here
No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant & fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them
But you know what
They're wrong
She heads into the bedrooms
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin
There's a lot of jobs out there
(off-hand) How would you know
George reacts, a little stung
He follows her into: '  - Matt and Katie are asleep
Erin is checking their windows
George comes in
They whisper
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean
Nothing
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so
didn't say that
Cause  can get a job
will
And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again
Would that make you happy
Keep your voice down
know what they can sleep through, Erin probably know it better than you
She gives him a glare, then leaves the room
- Erin is reaching up to a high shelf for a dusty old box of files
Out of the corner of her eye, she sees Ross passing
Hey, Ross
Tell me something
Does & pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart
(a bad liar) don't know what you're talking about
The fuck you don't
No one calls me Pattee
That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you
(beat) People are dying, Ross
You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it
wanna know how the hell you sleep at night
Ross is speechless
He just stands there
Erin drags the box to the floor and goes to work
- Erin's car is parked in front
- comes rumbling up the road
When its lights hit Erin's car, it slows, then pulls over
The driver flicks on his  to get a better look at the car
The truck sits there for a bit, a dark presence
Then, as the headlights of another car appear down the road, the truck goes back in gear, pulls out and drives off
'  - pile of documents is strapped into the passenger seat
An empty coffee cup rolls around the floor
Erin's driving, exhausted
She yawns as she dials her phone
(
) Hello
between Erin in her car, and George in bed
'm so tired 'm about to drive off the road
Keep me awake, willya
What do you want, a joke
No, no jokes,  gotta pee
Just tell me about your day
What went on back there
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here
Beth started talking
What
(beat) Beth
My Beth
Yeah
We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball
" Erin says nothing, just stares out at the empty highway, feeling all hollowed-out
'd never seen that before -- someone's first word
Pretty intense
Erin just nods
Keeps staring straight ahead as a tear rolls down her cheek
& ,   '  - as Erin hands them to Ed
As he takes them from her, he notices a crematory urn on Erin's desk
Is that what  think it is
She lived on the plume
You never know
Ed laughs and hands the documents to Brenda without looking at her
She grumpily takes them over to the fax machine
as Brenda types in the number
The recipient's name comes up again: &
- Open pits, pony rides, watermelon
George is watching Katie and Matt being led around on ponies, an activity that stopped being fun hours ago
Now they're just hot and tired
, Ed is talking to an   as they sign retainer agreements
, Erin, holding Beth, is looking at pictures of a swimming pool with
The water is green
This was the community pool
1 Yeah, that & built
The whole time we thought it was algae that made it so green
Erin's trunk is open
She and Ed are clipping new clusters of retainer agreements into the "" binder
Erin and Ed are passing out informational pamphlets
She sticks one in a hand before noticing that it's George's
'm bored, and so are the kids
Just a few more minutes, then we can go
(as he heads off) Take her, will you
George drops the pamphlet and takes Beth from Erin
He heads over to Matt and Katie, sitting glumly on a log
As he steps away, a hand reaches down and grabs the flier he dropped
It belongs to a
He's in his 50's, strong and sinewy
Military-style dark glasses obscure his eyes
He scans the pamphlet, then watches Erin working the crowd
Watches her carefully
He slides the pamphlet into his inside pocket, and heads back his car -- the -  that idled in front of the Water Board
Erin is heading over to George and the kids, ready to leave, when Donna comes up to her, with  -  in tow
Erin, this here's Frank Melendez
He works over at the compressor station -- Erin stops in her tracks, very interested
Erin and Frank are on a bench, talking
Out of the corner of her eye, she sees her car drive off
George's hand sticks out the driver's side and flips her the bird
She watches him disappear, then, hiding her rage, turns back to Frank
'm sorry
What were you saying
The barbecue is winding down
Ed is heading for his Mercedes
Erin storms up beside him, mad as all get-out
need a ride
'  - Ed is driving
He glances over at Erin, fuming in the passenger seat
After a beat: You wanna talk about -- No Another beat
Then Erin's cel phone rings
She digs into her bag, pulling it out as fast as she can
Answers
What , asshole
There's a pause
Then Mike Ambrosino's voice comes over the line, very strained: (
) Um, Erin
This is Mike
Ambrosino
' ,  - The curtains are drawn; everything is dark
Ed and Erin are at the door, talking to Mike, who looks drawn and tired
She was about to take a handful of these -- He shows them a bottle of prescription pills
It's a morphine thing -- for pain -- Erin nods, then leaves Ed with Mike and heads toward: ' ,  - Erin opens the door
Very dark, very quiet
Laura is lying in bed
Erin goes over to her
They speak in whispers
'm embarrassed
That's okay
understand
It's just -- the pain
It's only getting worse
can't be a good wife
can't be a good mother
'm real sorry, Laura
Erin sits down on the chair next to the bed
Takes a beat
Know what  always thought  wanted outta life, Erin
Jaguar
Jaguar's a darn pretty car
thought if  could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine
(beat) don't even know how much they cost
lot
But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one
Laura shakes her head
Wouldn't mean the same thing
Erin watches her sadly
&   - , industrial plant
Erin and Frank Melendez walk through, him in coveralls, her in a teensy sun dress
Both in hard-hats
He's giving her a tour
- George, in his leather and denim, is walking down the sidewalk
As we , we see he's pushing a
He stops at a crosswalk, waiting for the light to change
In the stroller, Beth starts to whine
George reaches in his pocket, finds her pacifier
As he's leaning down to give it to her, he hears a  coming down the street behind him
The roar grows
He stands, looks has pulled up next to him
He looks at them
They look at him, then at the stroller
George feels ridiculous
When the light changes, the bikers   and pull out
George just stands there and watches them go
&  - His office is all about Hinkley
map of the plume area and a diagram of the plant cover one wall; photos of the plant cover the credenza; piles of documents litter every surface; Erin is up at the map, eating Chinese food
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive
Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds
don't remember seeing any ponds up there
She bites into a forkful of food, keeps talking
They covered 'em over
And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock
And that's what caused the contamination
It didn't help, but no
The real problem's on the bottom
She reaches for a document, reads from it
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground
But guess what -- They skipped that step
guess it was a little too inconvenient
So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please
Jesus
(beat) don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk
In response to the insinuation, Erin gives him a glare
For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them
That was his job
No shit
No -- Suddenly, her eyes pop out of her head -- Hot
Hot
Hot
Tears spring to her eyes
She fans furiously at her mouth
Ed finds the tequila from the client and hands it to her
She takes a swig
There's a nanosecond of relief
until the tequila hits
Her eyes redden
She spews and gasps
You
asshole Ed chuckles
& , '  - The tequila's been dipped into
Ed and Erin are each lying on a couch, staring at documents
Late-night working
Erin -- lemme tell you something
If 'da put three researchers on this,  wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here
This is some damn good work
Yeah
Then gimme another raise
Hey,  got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus haven't billed a minute of my time since started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like 'm rich or something
He gets up, grabs his trash can, and moves around the room with it, cleaning up all the Chinese food cartons
Don't give me that
You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr
40 percent
We got those & fuckers by the balls here
We've got the & fuckers in Hinkley by the balls
But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate & fuckers in San Francisco
What do you mean
& corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley
Oh, they knew
They had to know
Show me the document that proves that
She doesn't have one
Then they didn't know
And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages
And punitive damages is where the money is
Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more work on this thing, the more  realize what a crock of shit this legal system is
Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and we're the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things
That's just not right
Beat
Ed smiles
like this case
Really
It makes me sick
Me too
That's why  like it
It's been a long time since  had a case  cared about
You didn't care about my case
would now
He gives her a long look
Hey
like working with you
Well, good, Ed
like working with you too
They both smile a little awkwardly
Take a beat
Then: When'd you start calling me Ed
&  - The Christmas party
The office is decorated; someone is Santa
Erin and George enter, all dressed up
& ,  - Erin's giving George a guided tour
As they head down the hall, every desk is decorated and has a present on it 'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here
Cause it's my office party
If you had an office, 'd go to your party
& ,   '  - It's dark
The door to Erin's area opens
And here, ta-daa, is my desk
She flicks on the lights
Brenda's desk is decorated and as a present on it
Erin's is empty
Which one
(it's obvious) Maybe they didn't think you were coming
Erin shakes her head
She's surprised by how hurt she is
(quietly) God damn
work so hard
The least they could do
George looks over at her, sees her eyes glisten a little
He goes over to her, wraps his arms around her
Hey
Fuck 'em, babe
Who needs 'em, huh
He kisses her
She leans into him
He kisses her some more
(quietly) See
All we need is each other
She kisses back
She's gonna let him take care of her
Some more kisses, heating up
He slides her onto her empty desk
Good thing there isn't a present there, huh
That mighta hurt
She laughs a little
He slides his hands up her skirt
She pulls him into her, tugging his shirt out of his pants
,  - Ed is coming down the hall with his wife,
Joey is much younger than Ed, and very pretty
'll show you what we did back here -- '  - Erin and George, in a rapidly-heating-up clinch on her desk, hear the voices
Erin pulls away
That's Ed
Lock the door
No,  wanna say hi
He pulls her back into him, not wanting to move
We'll say hi later
Lock it
But Erin pulls away
Come on, George, it's a party
He watches her straighten her dress and take a step away from him
It's just one step, but it feels a hell a lot farther
- Erin and Ed are at the reception desk, talking and laughing
, Joey and George are standing together, awkwardly
Your wife's real pretty
She's not my wife
' ,   '  - Matthew lies awake in his bed, listening to George and Erin fight
(
) It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while -- (
) What do you want to talk about instead
Your day
That's a fascinating subject
' , '  - Erin and George are fighting while they get ready for bed
Fuck you
Just cause  don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit  am -- That is not what 'm -- Bull shit , Erin
Bullshit
The fight is interrupted by the sound of
Great
Excellent
Thank you very much
She leaves the room
'  - Beth is wailing in her crib
Erin comes in in her nightshirt and lifts Beth out
Then, more to herself than to Beth: It's okay, baby
It'll be okay
She runs her hand over Beth's head, then slides down the wall and crumples onto the floor
As she curls around Beth, Erin starts to
Deep, raspy coughs from way down low
&  - Late, late at night
The plant is silent
The property seems empty, until we notice Pete Irving standing alone inside the gates, staring up at the station
After a beat, he picks up a rock and hurls it at the plant
It misses
Not that it would do anything if it hit
He reaches for another, throws it
Then another, and another
He hurls rock after rock at the gigantic plant
Then, overwhelmed by his impotence, he lets out a
' , '  - Donna's sitting quietly in bed
Erin is sitting on the edge of the bed
'd got so used to having 'em come up benign,  guess  just didn't expect it
She looks down her shirt front
Sure wish  had longer to get used to the idea
(beat) You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman
Sure you are
You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire
Donna smiles a little
Then her face crumbles
We're gonna get them, aren't we, Erin
You gotta promise me we're gonna get them
& , as  are faxed once again to the &
, on another day
, on another day
& , '  - Ed is once again checking the lie of his tie in a window
Erin is popping some aspirin, trying to kill a headache that has brought with it a healthy dose of intolerance
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, 'm gonna be real pissed off
From their tone of voice on the phone, 'd say they're taking us more seriously
Yeah,  heard that one before
Brenda leans her head in
Mr
Sanchez, Mr
Webster, Mr
Buda, and Ms
Cooper, from & are here
& ,   - Talk about moving up the food chain
,
,
, and
mill slowly about the reception area like sharks
They all ooze importance
& ,   '  - Erin, Ed and Brenda are staring out at them
Jesus
They look like the Secret Service
They're trying to intimidate us
(then, to Brenda) Tell them to wait in the conference room
& ,   - Sanchez, Webster, Buda, and Cooper are seated
The door opens and Ed enters, legal pad under his arm
Followed by Erin, legal pad under her arm
Followed by Anna (looking professional in Brenda's suit coat), legal pad under her arm
Followed by Mario (in a suit produced from who knows where), legal pad under his arm
If you didn't know better, you'd assume it was a team of lawyers as well
Counselors -- Counselors
Ed and Erin sit down and get to work
Mario and Anna, clearly told to just follow along, sit down a moment later
& ,   - Mario and Anna are sitting mutely in their seats beside Ed and Erin, firing blank looks across the table
Let's be honest, here
Two million dollars is more money than these people have ever dreamed of
Erin has no patience for this today
Oh, see, now that pisses me off
First of all -- we got more'n a hundred plaintiffs
They may not be sophisticated, but they do know how to divide, and two million dollars isn't shit when it's split between them
Mario and Anna exchange a look
This is getting interesting
Erin -- But there's no stopping her
And second of all -- these people don't dream about being rich
They dream about being able to watch their kids swim in a pool without worrying they'll have to have a hysterectomy at age 20, like Rosa Diaz -- a client of ours -- or have their spine deteriorate like Stan Bloom
Another client of ours
So before you come back here with another lame-ass offer,  want you to think real hard about what your spine is worth, Mr
Buda -- or what you'd expect someone to pay you for your uterus, Miss Sanchez -- then you take out your calculator and multiply that number by a hundred
Anything less than that is a waste of our time
And she gets up and storms out of the meeting
& ,   - Erin drinks a big swig of coffee and pops a few more aspirin
Beyond her, the & lawyers are filing out of the office
Anna wanders over to Erin, a little uncomfortable
Um, Erin
(Erin turns) Listen
Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world
(beat) sometimes you're not half-bad
'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you
& , '  - Erin's at her desk, which is completely buried in documents and files
She's visibly exhausted, struggling to focus on the page, and  while she works
Ed calls to her
Hey
new plaintiff called, wants to meet you
told him we'd be out there Thursday
'you get his name
(no answer) Course not
Jesus, Ed -- He said he'd be at the gas station at six
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh
- Erin is sitting out front, swigging cough syrup from the bottle
She checks her watch: 6:30
The comes out, locks up, and turns out the lights
This is the only station in town, right
Yup
He gets in his car and drives off
Erin sits down again
Looks down the road in both directions
Nothing
Then she spots, behind some bushes across the street, a glint of chrome
She shields her eyes against the sunset and sees: the -  parked behind some shrubbery
Erin looks around, realizes she's alone
As she looks back at the truck, the  of a cigarette brightens in the cab
She realizes she's being watched
The driver's door opens
Erin bolts for her car, scrambling to find her keys
She jumps in, locks her doors, and tries to start her car, but it won't turn over
Panic
The Man in the Dark Glasses has gotten out and is heading toward her car
Erin looks around again
Not a soul
She tries the engine again
And again
Just as he gets to her car, the engine engages
Erin peels out of the gas station
'  - Erin drives down the road, hyperventilating, trying to focus on the road
She looks in the rear-view mirror -- nothing
She reaches the train tracks
train is passing
She has to stop
As she's waiting, the glint of headlights bounce off her rear view mirror
Truck lights, coming her way
Fuck
She looks at the train -- still passing -- then back at the headlights closing in on her
The train, the headlights, the train, the headlights
Finally, when the headlights are right behind her, the last train car zips by
Erin peels out, bounding her rickety car over the tracks
The truck follows
- The Hyundai zips down the road
And behind it, the truck
- She looks out at the landscape around her
It's black
No other cars on the road
She starts to panic, accelerates
- The Hyundai going faster
The truck still following
- Erin comes up on a stop sign
She runs it
So does the truck
little later, she makes a turn and sees In the parking lot, like a lifeboat, sits Ed's Mercedes
She pulls into the drive and jumps out of her car
- Ed is eating ribs when Erin bursts through the door
She rushes over to him, near tears with fear and exhaustion
Someone's following me
What
Who
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till  was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles
Jesus, 'm shaking
Get me a beer
Ed gets up and heads toward the door
(to the counter guy) Beer, please
As Ed looks out the door, Erin collapses onto a bench
What kind of truck
don't know
Big
Dark
He's gone
(back to the table) Did you get a license plate
Or a make
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, didn't have time to check those things -- was just asking
Are you all right
Yeah
Yeah, 'm
fine
Ed looks at her
She looks terrible
Shaky, tired, drawn
Jesus, you look like shit
When was the last time you had a decent night's sleep
- Crappy and pink
Ed's Mercedes pulls into the parking lot
Erin's Hyundai follows
Ed stops, gets out
- Ed swings by Erin's open car window
Don't worry
'm getting two rooms
- Erin and Ed amble down the porch, checking door numbers, each rattling a key
They find their adjacent rooms and stop
Erin leans against the wall, too weak to stand
Lock the door every which way you can
And if there's anything -- funny sound, whatever -- pound on the wall
'll come right over
She nods a little
Then before she goes into her room: think you should know -- there's very few people in the world who don't piss me off 90 percent of the time
(beat) You're one of 'em
It's as tender as she gets, and he's moved by it
They look at each other
Maybe even considering
But after a long beat, she reaches for her door again
Moment over
'm triple locking my door, so don't even think of trying to take advantage
She smiles, goes inside
He watches her close her door behind her before going inside himself
' ,   - George is sitting alone on the stoop, drinking a beer
Music is coming from his house next door
He stares out into the street with a lot on his mind
' ,  - Katie and Matt are making a mess of breakfast
Beth is on the floor, grinding cereal into the linoleum
(
) Hello
Erin enters, having just gotten home, and sees the mayhem
What are you doing Where's George
don't know
George
She heads out
' , '  - George is sitting on the bed when Erin enters
Jesus, George, they're turning the kitchen into a hellhole
You know you can't leave them alone like that
He doesn't answer
Doesn't move
She notices this
What's going on
What are you doing
Thinking
About what
He's very calm
He holds out a small jewelry box
About this
What's that
It's a pair of earrings
saw 'em in the mall one day, and  thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes
So  bought 'em
And  said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, 'll surprise her with 'em
(beat) Know how long ago that was
Six months
In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me
That's a long time
'm sorry
'm just working so hard -- know
But still
Six months
(he stands) think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend
Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but 'm sure as shit not one of 'em
can't leave my job, George
Yeah, you can
You could just quit
People do it all the time
can't
Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me
mean it
For the first time in my life,  got people respecting me
Up in Hinkley,  walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what got to say
never had that
Ever
Don't ask me to give it up
need it
More than you need me
need it
He nods, then stands, to leave
Maybe you didn't like who you were before, Erin, but  did
That's who  fell in love with
Only then does she see the packed duffel bag in the corner
You already packed up your stuff
pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be
He picks it up and walks out the door, tossing the earring box on the bed as he goes
'  - Erin is at her window, looking out at the street below
George is strapping a couple of bags onto the back of his bike
He gets on the bike, starts it up, and drives away
- Erin is driving, looking weary
Her kids are in the car
Matthew turns on the radio
Erin reaches over and turns it off
Matthew turns it back on
Erin glares at him, turns it off
On/off/on/off
test of wills
Finally, when Matthew turns it on one more time, Erin turns it off, yanks the knob off the stereo and throws it out the window
&    - The Hyundai pulls into the lot
- Erin parks the car, unclips her seat belt
Wait here
She gets out
& ,   - Business as usual
Erin comes in, goes straight to her desk
& , '  - Erin flips through her "in" box, looking for something in particular
Doesn't find it
Grrr
She heads off to: & , '  - Jane is at her desk when Erin comes in
Where's my paycheck
Have you been logging on
What
moved payroll onto the computer
It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night
(seething) Now how'm  supposed to do that when 'm not in here most mornings and nights
You're clever
'm sure you'll think of something
Erin glares at her
don't believe this -- then turns and storms out of Jane's office
& , '  - Ed is on the phone when Erin barges in, rage in her eyes
want my fucking money -- (into phone) 'm sorry, 'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here -- (puts the call on hold, then, to Erin) Do you mind
(seething) Yeah,  mind
You bet your ass  mind
Clearly, she's in a dander he's going to have to deal with
Oh, Jesus
You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or -- It's my paycheck
Which  earned
Which deserve
Which  shouldn't have to beg for
That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me
Erin, you're a big girl
If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself
don't have time to deal with -- Fuck you
Make time
Cause  bust my ass for you
watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you
And what do you do for me
Huh
You see the way 'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once
Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work 'm doing
Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee 've ever had
Is that what you want
want my paycheck
By the end of the day
Ed sighs
Realizes he's going to have to take this on
'll see what  can do
You might want to think real hard about the amount, too
My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause  still don't make enough to afford good child care
Makes me think about looking around for a job where 'm appreciated, for shit's sake
She storms out
' ,  - Erin is standing at the sink, visibly exhausted, trying to do the dinner dishes with one arm and comfort Beth, who's , with the other
Matthew comes in
Can  play roller hockey
We'll see
When
The
Erin goes to get it
Matthew follows ' ,   - Matthew is dogging Erin on this
Beth is still crying
Randy's mom said yes right away
(snapping) Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house
Erin opens the door
is there
Erin Brockovich
Yeah
Package from Masry & Vititoe
He hands her a manila envelope
She signs for the package, then tears into it as the Messenger heads away
and a    fall out
She looks at the check
It's made out for $5,000
note attached reads " -
" Erin looks up and sees  -   parked on the curb
She looks at the keys in her hand
Chevy keys
Whoa
& ,   - Erin drives up in the Blazer, pulls into a parking space
& ,   - It's dark
Ed's seated at a table, alone
Erin walks by the door, then spots him and stops in the doorway
Believe it or not,  would've been satisfied with just the check
Ed turns, sees her
Well, you go threatening to leave,  can't take any chances
You're the only person around who understands what 'm doing
Things come up,  gotta know  got someone to turn to
She sits, reading him
What kind of things come up
Things like the head counsel for & calling me with an offer
(beat) 20 million, plus attorney's fees
Take it or leave it
Whoa
No shit
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff
So what are you thinking
'm thinking
wish someone else had to make this decision
(beat) 50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten
Ever
But
but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills
And it's less than pocket change for &
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial
Maybe
but maybe not
We still don't have anything linking this to & corporate
Plus, there's the statute problem
Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money
It's eight million dollars, Erin
Eight million dollars
Beat
That's a fucking fortune, Ed
And you know 'm the last person on Earth to walk away from a big payday
But you and me didn't get into this to get rich
We did it cause we both have this voice in our heads saying, do the right thing; get these plaintiffs what they deserve -- the right to live and die in some kind of comfort and peace
If 50,000 isn't gonna buy that, then we gotta say no
(beat) Trust me
If you don't do the right thing for these people, getting that 6 million dollars is gonna feel like shit
He nods to himself, and looks up at her, his mind made up
knew  put up with your bullshit for a reason
'   - It's raining
They're driving through the tall buildings of Century City
Ed is full of nervous excitement
This guy, Erin -- he's got more toxic tort experience than anyone else in California
He's huge
And he said yes to me on the first phone call, right off the bat
(points to a building) That's it
The big one
They've got the top three floors
,  & ,  - It feels more like the lobby of a five-star hotel than an office
Erin and Ed step off the elevator
Erin gawks
Holy shit
Who do they represent, God
Don't joke
They might
So do me a favor and behave yourself for once
(to receptionist) Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter
As Ed turns to check his reflection, a   comes through the reception area
Erin watches him pass, then, still miffed, calls out to him
Scuse me, sir, you got a real nice ass, you know that
The lawyer double-takes on her, then retreats into the office
Erin turns to Ed, smiles
Oh, 'm sorry
Was that not what you meant by behaving myself
,  &    - , 38, junior partner, comes out to greet them
She's everything Erin isn't: conservative, restrained, unemotional
And about as sexy as a station wagon
Ed
Good to see you again
Theresa, hey -- this is Erin Brockovich
,  &   - Theresa leads Ed and Erin down a long hall of teak desks
The sound of their footfalls is swallowed up by the plush carpeting
Occasional  and  glance at Erin
She feels their stares
,  & ,  '  - Potter is sitting behind his giant desk when Theresa leads Ed and Erin in
Kurt, Ed Masry's here
And this is Erin Brockovich, Ed's assistant
Erin, this is Kurt Potter
(to Ed, with a wink) Well
Now  know what you meant when you called her your secret weapon
Erin gives Ed another look
What the fuck
Ed gives her a firm look back
Behave
,  & ,   - Potter, Ed, Erin, Theresa and few   are sitting around the table
As the conversation ping-pongs between Ed and Potter, Potter completely ignores Erin
When'd they file the demur
Yesterday
What's a demur
It's & saying to the judge that we don't have a case
Their lawyers go -- How many counts
Sixty-nine
We've got good answers to all of 'em
Counts
Reasons & thinks it shouldn't go to -- Who's the judge
Corey
Good
Why good
He's got a reputation for doing all his -- How long's he gonna take
Erin's starting to steam at Potter
Theresa sees it brewing, tries to intercede
You know what
Why don't  take Erin down the hall, so we can start in on this stuff
Erin notices all her files in stacks against the wall
Hey -- those are my files -- Yeah, we had them couriered over
And listen, good work
They're a great start
We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research
Okay, these people are starting to piss her off
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it
There are no holes in my research
No offense
There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask
Don't talk to me like 'm an idiot, okay may not have a law degree, but 've spent 18 months on this case, and  know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will
Erin
You don't even have phone numbers for some of them
Whose number do you need
Everyone's
This is a lawsuit
We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs
said, whose number do you need You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart
Erin just stares at her
Theresa sighs, reluctantly glances down at a file
Annabelle Daniels
Annabelle Daniels
714-454-9346
As Theresa starts to write it down: 10 years old, 11 in May
Lived on the plume since birth
Wanted to be a synchronized swimmer, so she spent every minute she could in the & pool
She had a tumor in her brain stem detected last November, had an operation on Thanksgiving, shrunk it with radiation after that
Her parents are Rita and Ted
Ted's got Chron's disease, and Rita has chronic headaches and nausea and underwent a hysterectomy last fall
Ted grew up in Hinkley
His brother Robbie and his wife May and their five kids Robbie, Jr
, Martha, Ed, Rose, and Peter lived on the plume too
Their number's 454-9445
You want their diseases
Beat
Erin glares at Theresa, indignant
Okay, look --  think we got off on the wrong foot here -- That's all you got, lady
Two wrong feet
In fucking ugly shoes
- It's still raining
Erin is following Ed to the car
He's furious
She insulted me
Bullshit
It was a misunderstanding
But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect -- Why the fuck should  respect her
Ed stops in his tracks, furious
He glares at her
Because that's how people treat each other Not in my world
Gee,  wonder why
On that, he gets in his car, slams the door, and drives off, leaving her standing alone in the pouring rain
Hey
You're my ride
,  & ,  - Potter and Ed are walking down the hallway, mid-conversation
follow them with files
've also been thinking about the team
Responsibilities, who should cover what -- Right
think we should makes some changes
'  - Bob Linwood is in his barn, mucking it out
Theresa is at the edge of the property, trying unsuccessfully to get his attention by yelling and waving her arms
In her expensive shoes, she's stopped short of the cow patty minefield
,  & ,   - as a hand fills in a phone number
Erin seated with a , rattling off facts and numbers from memory
She's seized by a
- Theresa still hasn't gotten Linwood's attention
Finally, rather than ruin her shoes, she picks up a stone and tosses it at the barn
It hits the window and

Ed comes out of his office and hands Brenda a
Brenda types in the number
The recipient's
comes up again, only this time it says: , ,

On the way, she passes
Inside, Erin is still dictating to the
She's shivery with fever now
The floor around her is littered with tissues
'  - Theresa is talking to Rita and Ted Daniels
Annabelle is curled up on the sofa, wrapped up in a blanket
Rita and Ted notice that Theresa doesn't even look at Annabelle
' ,  - Erin is lying in bed, home sick, talking on the phone
She's talking over the noise of , her 20-something Eastern European nanny, vacuuming the hall
know she isn't real warm, but they say she's a real good lawyer
'  - Ted Daniels is on the phone
Rita is next to him
That may be
But  don't want her coming to the house again
She's kinda stuck-up, and she upsets Annabelle
Now,  hate to say this, but when she left today, Rita asked if we should get a new lawyer
Ted, no -- don't do that
If you don't like Theresa, you don't have to work with her
Me and Ed are still here for you
called Ed two days ago, Erin, and he still hasn't called me back
& , '  - The phone rings
Brenda picks up
Ed Masry's office
Sorry, he can't be interrupted
Erin at home, still in bed, so irritated
Don't be a pain in the ass, okay, Brenda
Just put him on
(with finality) said, he can't be interrupted
Erin hangs up
Then, with a groan, she pulls her weary body out of bed
& ,  - Erin drags herself into the office
Hey, Erin,  thought you were taking a sick day
So did
She heads toward Ed's office, but stops when she sees a meeting in progress in the conference room
Ed is on the side of the table facing her, flanked by Potter and Theresa
On the other side of the table, are
What's going on in there
Some meeting
With & people
& -- Are you sure
Yup
They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane
Erin feels this like a sock in the gut
She stares at the meeting, stunned
& ,   - This band of & lawyers is the oldest and most impressive of all
Ed, Potter, and Theresa are listening to the most senior & lawyer,
, talk
we would enter into binding arbitration -- judge, no jury -- with a settlement to be between 50 and 400 million dollars
Ed and Potter hear this and think about it
Any preconditions on the settlements
The plaintiffs have to agree to it unanimously
And they're barred from ever discussing their settlement with anyone
50-400 million dollars isn't a whole hell of a lot of money for your company, Mr
Corbin
50-400 million dollars is a great deal of money for your plaintiffs, Mr
Masry
As Ed mulls this, he sees, beyond Mr
Corbin, staring at him from the other side of the glass wall, her face cold with hurt and anger
Could  -- just take a brief break here for a moment
'll be right back
He gets up and goes out into: & ,   - Ed comes out
Erin's so angry she can barely breathe
If you tell me to relax, 'm gonna kick your fucking head off -- Erin, it's just a meeting
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" -- Look, you said you weren't feeling great thought you should rest
Bullshit
You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you
Okay, look
It's an important meeting
Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers -- Kurt thought
What about you
Do you think anymore
He resists being dragged into an knock-down, drag-out fight
Look, this is serious now
They're talking serious money -- And, what, 'm not serious
You're emotional
You're erratic
You say any God damn thing that comes into your head
And 'm not saying that's bad
That can be great; that can be a lot of fun -- "Fun
"  Jesus, " fun "   kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun
" Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't -- Not personal That's my work in there, Ed
My sweat, my labor, my time
If that's not personal,  don't know what is
She starts to  and , but fights it
(weakened) How dare you take that away from me
No one's taking anything -- Bullshit
You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me
After all 've done for you, that's the thanks  get
By now the entire office is watching
As are the lawyers in the conference room
Don't give me that
You've gotten plenty
You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks
Perks
Jesus -- perks Erin reaches into her bag, pulls out her cel phone
If this piece of shit is supposed to take the place of your respect, you can take it and shove it up your ass
She throws it at him and storms away
The phone hits the glass wall of the conference room,  it
Ed just stands there, with the lawyers staring at him through the splintered glass wall
&    - Erin gets to her car
As she opens the door, the She fumbles with her keychain, trying to turn it off, but she's too sick and upset to figure it out
With the siren still blaring, she kicks at the car in rage
'  - Erin's driving home
As she turns onto her street, her headlights wash across the sidewalk and illuminate a small boy, wearing a backpack, walking the other way
Holy shit -- She looks over her shoulder, but the sidewalk is too dark
She pulls a -turn in the middle of the street
Erin scans the sidewalk, finally sees him again
Holy shit, is right
It's Matthew, wandering the streets at night
Matthew -- She pulls ahead of Matthew and bumps up onto the sidewalk, blocking his path
When he sees her car, he turns and runs the other way
Erin leaps out and follows him
Matthew
She catches up and collars him
God damn it, Matthew
What the hell are you doing out here
'm gonna go live with George
'  - is playing
is on the phone
The receiver is yanked from her hand
She turns to see Erin hovering over her, barely containing herself
If you leave here real fast,  might not kill you
' ,   '  - Matthew's in his bed, facing the wall
Erin sitting on the foot of his bed, near tears
Katie's watching from her bed
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay
Whatever you want, we'll work it out
promise
You always say that
Then you go to work and forget you promised
never forget, honey
try, real hard
It's just, for some reason,  don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys,  end up falling short
You never fall short for the work people guess maybe you just love them more
Oh, God, sweetheart, no
There's nothing on Earth  love more than you
Nothing
(beat) promise
She lays her hand on his shoulder, but he shrugs it off and inches away from her
' ,  - Erin comes out of the bedroom
As she turns to close the door, she collapses to the floor in a heap
Out cold
- busy Southland
George bursts through the doors with Katie, Matthew and Beth in tow
He goes up to the desk
'm looking for Erin Brockovich
They brought her in in an ambulance
- The kids are waiting
George is talking to a
Meningitis
What the hell is meningitis
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain
Jesus
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case
'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now
How does someone get meningitis
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or
or lemme guess -- toxic waste
'   - Matt and Katie sit on the cheap plastic chairs outside the room
Katie is holding Beth, who's sleeping
(
) They can stay at my place till you go home
'   - Erin's in bed, hooked up to an , looking exhausted
All untouched food tray is beside her bed
George is standing across the room from her, arms crossed tight across his chest, keeping his distance
They said that'd be tomorrow
They just wanna keep an eye on me another night
Fine
'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon
moment of thick silence
Thank you
(giving nothing) Mm-hm
As she watches him reach for his motorcycle helmet, to leave, she's hit with a wave of regret
George, hang on
(he pauses) Look
'm sorry
just -- There's a  at the door, and Ed enters
George looks at him
Not interested in her apologies
'll drop 'em by tomorrow
And Erin watches George leave the room, then turns to Ed
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy
'm not gonna fire you
(beat) wanted to
But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit
(serious) You embarrassed me, Erin
know
'm sorry
(beat) Do  get to hear what happened anyway
'   - Ed has taken off his coat and pulled a chair up next to Erin's bed
He's eating the pudding off her tray
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely
Uh-huh
And if you had to guess
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, 'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that
Still a lot of money
So why would & offer it
Because
They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial
Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of -- Wait, what do you mean, ten years
Five years, maybe, for a trial
Double that for the appeal
(confused) 'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be ten years before these plaintiffs see their money
Hey, that's not so bad
Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime
So in legal terms, ten years is -- Fuck legal terms
We're talking about human beings here
Sick people
whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years
They need their money now
(beat) We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed
We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to -- know We're having a meeting, it's all set up -- When
Where
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse
Okay, good
think  should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than -- You're not gonna be there
The fuck 'm not
don't care what the doctor says -- This isn't doctor's orders
It's mine
'm saying you can't come
Why not
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you
He thinks you're a loose cannon
Fuck Kurt
Erin -- No, 'm serious
You know what Kurt Potter is
He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place
He's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when & offered 20 million
He doesn't work like us, Ed
There's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing
But his mind's made up
He stands to leave
Don't come, Erin
mean it
If you do, 'm gonna have to fire you
(beat) Just
concentrate on getting well
- The parking lot is empty, except for three Mercedes
Ed, Potter, and Theresa are in the doorway, going over their notes
pulls into the lot
' ,   - Katie and Matt are watching
Beth is playing near them
Behind them, Erin is lying on the couch, under a blanket, distractedly trying to watch
She checks her watch
- The lot is filling with more cars and trucks; headlights criss-cross each other as people pull in from all directions
'  - Erin's sitting up now, jiggling her knee, unable to sit still
She checks her watch again
6:30
She can't take it
She throws off the blanket and gets up
Come on, kids, we're going for a ride
- As people stream in, they are each handed a release form with a space for a signature on the bottom
- It's sweltering
The room, packed with plaintiffs, hums with horse flies and tension
People are fanning themselves with the release forms
Potter's addressing them from a raised platform
Ed, Theresa, and Andrew are seated behind him
Binding arbitration isn't all that different from a trial
It's overseen by a judge
Evidence is presented in much the same way
- One more car pulls into the lot
It's Erin's Chevy
'  - Erin unbuckles her seat belt
Stay in the car, babies,  won't be long
- Erin gets out of the car, looks around, then goes over to a window and looks in at the packed meeting
(
) And then a jury decides
(
) No, sorry,  should have mentioned that
There's no jury in binding arbitration
No jury, and no appeal
She climbs up on an old wagon for a better view
(
) No appeal
So what are our options if we don't like the result
(
) Well -- you have none
The judge's decision is final
But  really don't anticipate that as a problem
- Now, in addition to the stifling heat, the large room is thick with mistrust
People are shifting in their seats, whispering to each other
You don't even know what it's gonna be; how do you know we're gonna like it
Agreeing  ripple through the crowd
As  said before, it will definitely be somewhere between 50 and 400 million dollars
Which
There's a big difference there
wouldn't want to speculate at this point
Ed -- what do you think it'll be
Potter turns around and looks at Ed seated behind him
think
Kurt's right
We shouldn't speculate
So then, what, that mystery number's divided up at the whim of some judge -- Judges don't make decisions based on whim, ma'am
They make them based on precedent and evidence
The  of discontent has overtaken the room
More whispering, more movement
- Erin watches the meeting fall apart
It's driving her crazy
Fucking idiot -- - Potter sees he's losing them, too
Tries to gain control
Look
Everyone
Is this a big decision
Absolutely
But  do believe that if you put a little faith in the system, you'll be quite pleased with the outcome
Ted Daniels gets up from his seat
Mr
Potter, if you knew me from Adam, you'd know that being pleased isn't an option for me anymore
Now don't take this personally, sir, but 've never seen you before in my life
'm not about to put my faith in anything just cause you tell me to
He drops his agreement form, unsigned, then takes Rita's hand and heads for the door
- Meeting's over
The plaintiffs stream out of the firehouse
Cars start up, headlights flick on
People pull away
- Everyone has left
Erin enters and looks around
The floor is littered with rejected, unsigned release forms
She thinks for a moment, then gets an idea
She picks up a release form, and leaves the firehouse
- Everything's closed, except the ' store at the far end
Erin's truck pulls into the parking lot
' - is at the register, painting with Wite-Out on a blue piece of paper
Erin enters, dragging her kids
Can  have one of those counter thingies, please
The Employee gives it to her
Erin crosses to the copiers
She slips the release form into one, then taps in the number of copies: 635
Presses "
"  The machine  to life
- Erin's Chevy pulls into the parking lot
(
) don't want to stay here
It smells
- Erin is entering the crappy motel room with her kids
We got no choice
'm not gonna make it home tonight
Now go wash up and climb into bed
As the kids wander toward the bathroom, Erin picks up the phone and dials
,
(
) Hello
Hi
It's me
(silence) got a favor to ask you
(
) don't do favors for you anymore
It's not for me; it's for my kids
You're the only one  trust them with
- Very early
Erin is visible in the motel office, talking to the clerk, when George's motorcycle pulls into the lot
She turns around and sees him pulling up next to her Chevy
'   - Erin comes up to him, hands him a key
got you your own room
He takes it, glances toward the motel room
They up
Hunh-uh
Not yet
(awkward beat) Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay
Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere
She hands him a wad of cash
How long's this whole thing gonna take
don't know
Few days
(beat) Thanks for helping me
appreciate it
He nods
She gets into her car
Before closing the door, she turns back to him
And  miss you
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find
She sees how mad she's made him
Takes a beat
treated you real bad, George
know that
But, my problem was --  never been with anyone who deserved better than that
You're the first nice guy who ever liked me
George softens, shifts
He steps toward the truck and gently closes her door, so he's standing close to her
just
didn't know how to handle it
That's all
He thinks about this
Finally: Think you could learn
(with a smile) You know me
pick things up real fast
He smiles back at her, nods, then tenderly brushes a piece of hair out of her eyes
You shouldn't be driving around, you know
You're sick
Yeah, but 'm gonna get better
lot of these folks aren't
He nods, understanding
Then he taps the side of her truck and turns toward the motel room
She puts the truck in gear and pulls out
,   - Erin's Chevy is bombing down the road
' ,   - There are two boxes there -- one full of unsigned release forms, the other empty
'   - Donna's gardening out front, her head wrapped in a scarf to cover her chemo-thinning hair, when Erin's Chevy pulls into the driveway
Erin gets out, goes to the back of the truck, gets two of the release forms, then heads over to Donna
' ,   - Erin is sitting with Pete and Donna
don't know, Erin -- the way he was talking to us, telling us everything was gonna be fine --  just didn't trust him
And after all we been through -- no jury, no appeal
It just makes me nervous
understand all that
And  don't wanna force you into anything
If you don't want to sign, that's fine
But why don't we talk it over a little, cause 'd sure hate for you to turn this down for the wrong reasons
'  - The door opens
Erin emerges, holding two signed agreements
Donna is letting her out
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna
For what
Well,  was gonna head over to the Browns now
was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion
' ,   - Erin, Donna, Mandy, and Tom are seated on the sofas
Mandy signs an agreement
Hands the pen to Tom, who also signs
'  - From outside, we see Erin at the kitchen table with Donna and Bob and Ruth Linwood, who are listening intently
'  - Erin and Donna are leaving, saying good-bye to Mary DeSoto
Erin has a signed release form in her hand
'  - blares
The two boxes
The formerly empty one now has a small stack of signed release forms in it
The top one has Bob Linwood's signature
Erin is driving, eating a hamburger, and going over her list of plaintiffs
- People are going about their shopping
Rita Daniels is stopped, talking with
thought so, too, but Erin says a trial's gonna take years '  - The signed stack has grown; the unsigned stack has shrunk
Erin drops five more agreements into the "signed" box
'   - In the wee hours
While her kids sleep, Erin sits at the cheap motel room table, going through her forms, organizing, alphabetizing
'   - , fast asleep at the table, her face pressed against the linoleum
There's some  in the room, Erin stirs and looks around to see George behind her, diapering Beth, while Matt and Katie put their shoes on
What time is it
Real early
We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast
Erin forces herself awake
No,  need my car -- We'll just be a minute
Get a little more sleep
He picks up Beth, takes Katie's hand, and calls across the room to Matthew
'mon, pal
Leave that alone, we gotta go
Erin turns to see Matthew holding one of her release forms
Oh, baby, please don't play with that, okay
got 'em all organized
Just put it back
But he's reading it
And something has caught his attention
He looks up at Erin
This girl's the same age as me
Erin gently takes the form away from Matthew, wanting to shield him from the harsh realities of this case
That's right, sweetheart
She replaces the form on top of the stack
She's one of the sick people
Yeah
She is
(beat) But you know what
That's why 'm helping her
So she can get some medicine to make her feel better
Matthew mulls this over a bit more
How come her own mom isn't helping her
Cause her own mom's real sick, too
Matthew thinks real hard about this, then heads over to the door, where George, Beth, and Katie are waiting for him
Before he leaves, though, he turns back to Erin
Maybe we'll bring you back some breakfast
You want eggs
She looks at the group of them, feels their shift toward acceptance
Smiles, moved
Eggs'd be great, baby
Eggs'd be perfect
'  - Erin's driving along a dusty Hinkley road, eating cold eggs out of a take-out container with her fingers
- Morning
are arriving at work
Erin's truck pulls up
She grabs some release forms from the truck and wanders up to the men
Hey, y'all
How you all doing today
'  - She tosses eight more agreements in the signed stack
- Morning drop-off time
Erin is handing out release forms zo a  of  who just dropped off their kids
- Erin is leaning on the hood of her truck, going down her list of plaintiffs, checking off the ones who have already signed
- Another day
Erin has set up shop here and is at a table with about  , all reading agreements enters
Erin spots him
Mike
been looking all over for you
Come here,  wanna talk to you
'  - The signed stack is getting bigger
'  - And bigger
'  - And still bigger
- '
bunch more forms get thrown onto the signed stack, which is now much higher than the unsigned
(
) 'm gonna head out to Barstow and talk to some folks out there tonight
Erin talking on a nearby pay phone
(
) Promise you'll turn around if you get tired
will
Bye
She hangs up
As she turns to get into her car, she finds herself face-to-face with the Man in the Dark Glasses
Jesus
He's just standing there, a foot away, blocking her exit
She recognizes his truck as the one that chased her
Okay, what're you gonna do
You gonna kill me
Dump my body in a ditch somewhere
Or maybe you just wanna inject me with some poison too -- why change tactics at this stage of the game
(beat) Get outta my way, you make me sick
She pushes past him
But he grabs her by the arm
He's a big guy; it's a strong grab
Now she's scared
For a moment, he does nothing
Just looks at her
Then: If & made someone destroy a whole lot of documents -- would that matter to you
Erin takes a beat, realizing she completely misread him
She gently pulls her arm away
Well
guess that depends on what the documents were
(she takes a beat) 'm sorry --  didn't get your name
Embry
Charles Embry
- Erin and Embry are the only patrons
Erin's eating a burger
Embry has a beer
He's talking quietly, not looking at her
was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse
We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there
Did he say why
Nope
And  didn't ask
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind
So yeah,  took a look
And
There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation schedules, the like
(beat) But then there were a few memos about the holding ponds
The water in them
They had readings from test wells, stuff like that
Erin tries to hide her excitement at this information
And you were told to destroy those
That's right
Destruction of evidence
Pretty big deal
Erin plays it down
Wipes her mouth with her napkin, takes a sip of beer
Course as it turns out, 'm not a very good employee
What do you mean
Well
There were a few documents that somehow didn't get around to shredding
(beat) That  kept instead
Erin stops, mid-bite
'  - He's dug out an inch-high stack of documents
Erin looks them over, stunned
Embry is standing apart from her, hands shoved deep in his pockets
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things
At the time,  thought,  got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college
can't afford to lose my job
told myself  was being honorable
(beat) But there's nothing honorable in what  did
(beat) Maybe that's why they picked me for the job
Maybe they knew what kind of man  was
& ,   - Rosalind is at the desk
Anna, Brenda, and Jane are helping themselves to coffee
Erin enters, with a big box in her arms and a whole lot of attitude
Hey, Ros, where are they
In the conference -- But Erin's spotted them and headed off before Rosalind can finish
Anna, Brenda and Jane notice the purpose in her gait
They watch her with interest
& ,   - The table is covered with boxes of documents: the anticipated slew of paper that & is sending them
Ed, Kurt, Theresa, Andrew and    are sifting through them
Erin breezes in like sunshine
Morning
Erin
What are you -- (ignoring Ed) You know what, Mr
Potter
completely forgot your birthday this year
And seeing as how you've been so good to me,  think that is a terrible oversight
So what been doing over the last few days is 've been putting together a present for you
She plunks the box down on the table
Potter opens the top of the box
Looks in
635
They all signed
Every single one
, Anna, Brenda and Jane appear, wondering what's up
huge smile of appreciation slowly spreads across Ed's face
Ho - ly - shit
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed
got a little something for you, too
Erin hands Ed a manila envelope
He opens it
Internal & documents, all about the contamination
The one  like best says, and 'm paraphrasing here, but it says yes, the water's poisonous, but it'd be better for all involved if this matter wasn't discussed with the neighbors
It's to the Hinkley station, from & Headquarters
Stamped received, March, 1966
Potter and Theresa reel
Ed shakes his head in disbelief
Where did -- how did you do this
Well, what with me not having any brains or legal expertise,  just went on up there and performed sexual favors
635 blow jobs in five days
Whew, am  ever tired
And she struts out of the room, leaving everyone slack-jawed
The    of her heels carry her away
&  ,  - Erin comes out of the office, flushed with success, and heads down the hall
She presses the elevator button
The doors open
As she steps on, Ed comes out of the office
Hey
Erin puts her hand in the door, keeping it from closing
He stares at her, in awe
don't know what to say
Say you were wrong
was wrong
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself
did
Both
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if  didn't up and quit over all this
The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin
The luckiest son of a bitch in history
He looks down the hall at her, standing so tall and proud in the elevator
He walks toward her, stops right outside the elevator
But  know you're not gonna quit on me
How do you know that
(with a smile) Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing
Give him another chance
Of course she will
She releases her hand so he won't see her smiling
Ed watches the doors close
: - One of those days when the bay sparkles like a glitter ball
Erin's Chevy moves up the
music emanates from it
'  - Erin's at the wheel
Time has passed -- her hair's a little different
She's singing along with "Funky Town
" - Erin gets out of her new truck, looks, sees the Irvings in a little cluster
Donna's under an umbrella
Pete is slathering on sunscreen
The two girls zip out toward the water
Erin waves
Pete and Donna spot her, wave back
- Donna is standing at the edge of the water, watching her girls boogie board in
Erin comes up behind her
How you feeling today
Donna turns, sees her
Smiles
It's a good day
feel good
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop
Erin sits down on a rock
The judge came up with a number
number for the whole group, or for us
Both
Donna sits down next to her
He's making them pay the maximum
Tears of vindication spring to Donna's eyes
Oh, my God
And he's making them give five million of it to you all
Five million dollars
Five million dollars
She reels
After a breathless beat: don't even know how much money that is
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough
Donna wipes the tears off her face, then watches the light flickering off her girls playing in the surf
can put them in a good school
Any school you want
And get someone to help around the house
Yup
Oh my God
Oh my God
Donna is overwhelmed
Erin pulls her close
Oh, my God
& '    - Now this is where the hot lawyers work
gleaming testament to power
& '   - Boxes everywhere
They just moved in
Everyone is unpacking at his or her desk
Rosalind is manning the new phones
Masry & Vititoe, can  -- shoot
She lost them
Her reaction indicates this isn't the first time
The front doors open and Erin enters
Hey, Ros
Nice view, huh
Yeah, 'm gonna start sleeping here
(into phone) Masry & Vititoe, can  -- damn it
(calling out) Does anyone know anything about these phones
Erin heads on down a hall to: '   - beautiful corner office
Ed is unpacking when Erin enters
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone
You see your office
Yeah
Yours is nicer
Oh, okay
Here it comes
Here what comes
The extortion, the threats
wasn't gonna -- " can always find someplace else to work
Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera
" Ed,  swear, 'm not -- Okay, fine
Fine You backed me into a corner again
You're holding me hostage
He reaches into his breast pocket, pulls out a check
Hands it to her
What is that
Take it
Erin does
Looks at it
Her eyes bug out
Two million dollars
The firm took in sixty
That's three percent
Seemed like a fair bonus to me
She stares at it, speechless
He goes back to unpacking Oh, now  suppose you're gonna say it's not enough
Well, tough, Erin
Too goddamn bad
Cause this is absolutely, positively where  draw the line
