"Ed Wood", by Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski by Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski Directed by Tim Burton November 20, 1992 : - We move through a spooky shrouded parlor, as a storm rages outside
roars, and lightning flashes in the giant windows
in the center of the room lies an oak coffin
Suddenly the lid starts to creak open
hand crawls past the edge
and then the lid slams up
Famed psychic pops out
Criswell, 40, peers at us intently, his gleaming eyes framed under his striking pale blonde hair
He intones, with absolute conviction: Greetings, my friend
You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable
that is why you are here
So now, for the first time, we are bringing you the full story of what happened
(extremely serious) We are giving you all the evidence, based only on the secret testimony of the miserable souls who survived this terrifying ordeal
The incidents, the places, my friend, we cannot keep this a secret any longer
Can your hearts stand the shocking facts of the true story of Edward
Wood, Junior
Lightning
We drift down past the dark clouds
through the torrential rain
and end up
: - We've landed in Hollywood, 1952
We're outside a teeny, grungy playhouse
The cracked marquee proclaims "' ,'
,
" Pacing nervously in the rain is  , 30, our hero
Larger-than-life charismatic, confident, Errol Flynn-style handsome, Ed is a human magnet
He's a classically flawed optimist: Sweet and well-intentioned, yet doomed by his demons within
The doors open, and Ed's pal  "" , 45, hurries out
Bunny is a wealthy, theatrical fop wearing a string of pearls
[ 2 ] Suddenly the rest of the cast runs up, frantically upset
In a flowing white dress is  , 23, a sharp, hungry- for-a-career ingenue
She's near tears
Eddie, my dove just flew out the window
She goes on in two minutes
What are we gonna do
They all look to Ed, awaiting a response
He thinks a second, then excitedly  his hands
Dolores, give me your shoes
What
The ghost can be barefoot
Give me your shoes She hands Ed her white shoes
He snatches one, grabs a pair of scissors, and starts  up the shoe
Everyone is baffled
He keeps cutting the shoe
and it slowly takes on the shape of a dove
Ed then grabs some pipe cleaners, works them into a shape, and sprints into the dressing room
He takes some green eye shadow and excitedly smears it on the pipe cleaners
Ed then hurries back out, jams the green pipe cleaners into the cut-up shoe
and it looks like a dove with an olive branch in its mouth
The cast is flabbergasted
Wow
The soldiers suddenly look up
#1 Hey,  think  see something
Dolores floats down onto the stage, holding out the dove
offer you mortals the bird of peace, so that you may change your ways and end all this destruction
: - Ed and his gang celebrate opening night in a dirty 24-hour diner
They're noisily slugging down drinks, in a big red booth
What a show
Everyone was terrific
Paul, your second-act monologue actually gave me chills, He grins at Actor #1, aka  , a young eager beaver who's loyal like a dog
Aw thanks, Eddie
Actor #2, aka  , a friendly, simple-minded lug, runs up waving a newspaper
got the early edition
It was just dropped off at the newsstand
(he smiles at everyone) This is the big moment
Ed opens the paper to the entertainment page
-
Ed turns to a column, "The Theatrical Life, By Victor Crowley
"  Under this is a photograph of an old man with an ascot
Everybody excitedly crowds around and starts reading moment
and then their faces drop
Clearly, this is a disastrous review
Their faces get sadder, and sadder
and then they finish
melancholy beat, until -- What does that old queen know
He wasn't even there
(he knocks back a drink) Sending a copy boy to do his dirty work
Well fuck him Do  really have a face like a horse
What does "ostentatious" mean
Ed calmly waves his arms for attention
He tries to smile
Hey
Hey, it's not that bad
You just can't concentrate on the negative
He's got some nice things to say
(he scans the review) See, "The soldier costumes are very realistic
"  That's positive
Everyone kind of stares at their drinks, depressed
Ed launches into an upbeat speech
Hell, 've seen a lot worse reviews
've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes
Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got terrible notices
But it was a huge hit
Lines around the block
So don't take it too seriously
We're all doin' great work
You really think so
Absolutely
It's just the beginning
promise this: If we stick together, one day 'll make every single one of you famous
He smiles at everyone at the table
They all believe what he says, and there is a hushed moment of dream-filled hope
: '  - Ed and Dolores lie in bed, in the dark
He stares vulnerably at her
Honey, what if 'm wrong
What if just don't have it
Ed, it was only one review
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane
"  'm already 30
Ed, you're still young
This is the part of your life when you're supposed to be struggling
know
But sometimes  get scared this is as good as it's gonna get
Dolores kisses Ed affectionately
Things'll change for us
Nobody stays on the fringe forever
She gets out of bed
We see her tiny apartment is drab and crumbling
Dolores turns on the shower, then walks to the closet
She looks inside
God, where's my pink sweater
can never find my clothes anymore
- He rolls over in bed, away from her
: - on Ed reading "The Hollywood Reporter
"     in suspenders suddenly strides up
Hey big shot, get off your ass
They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building
Sure thing, Mr
Kravitz
Ed jumps up
We , revealing he's in a giant greenhouse, packed with rows of potted plants and shrubs
Ed grabs a small palm tree and hurries out
- Ed strolls across the busy movie lot, lugging the palm
He passes a soundstage and notices the stage door open a crack
Ed glances around, then puts down the palm and hurries in
o big-budget foreign legion movie is shooting, with a huge cast and crew
giant desert set has been erected, with camels and real sand dunes
Ed is blown away
Whoa, look at all this sand
This is real sand
My God, where'd they get all this sand
sees him
Hey,
This is a closed set
Ed is caught
He hurries out
o Ed continues across the lot, carrying his palm tree
An sticks his head out an office window
Hey, Eddie
Come in here
got some great new stuff to show you
Ed puts down the plant again and runs in
o The old guy is proudly showing Ed   on a moviola
The footage is totally random: Giant explosions, buffalos stampeding, tanks, an octopus swimming, etc
Ed is dazzled
This is fantastic
What are you gonna do with it all
Eh, probably file it away and never see it again
It's such a waste If  had half a chance,  could make an entire movie out of this stock footage
(getting inspired) See, the story opens with these mysterious explosions
Nobody knows what's causing them, but it's upsetting all the buffalo
So the military is called in to solve the mystery
Ya forgot the octopus
No, 'm saving that for the big underwater climax
The old guy cackles
- Ed finally carries the tree into the Laemmle Building
- Young  in June Cleaver hairdos are giggling
#1 They say he was a girl trapped in a man's body
#2 'll bet it hurt when they snipped his thing off
All the girls shriek in horror
Ed walks in and puts down his plant
What are you ladies gabbin' about
#1 You know that Christine Jorgensen freak
He/she/it's in "Variety
" Some producer is making a biopic
(startled) -really
didn't see the story
#1 Ah, it was buried in the back
The guy's a real smallotime operator
She holds up her "Variety
"  Ed hurriedly takes it
: - The story headline says "BOYoTOoCHICK
"  We , revealing we're now in '  - Ed holds the newspaper while he paces around his apartment
The place has threadbare carpet, faded wallpaper, and an electric burner for a kitchen
handful of mangy  run around
Tacked-up are movie posters for "," "," and "
" Dolores talks on the phone, while Ed silently coaches her
(on phone) Yes, 've got Mr
Edward Wood on the line
Could you please hold
Ed gives her a thumbs up -- perfect
He confidently takes the phone
(on phone) Hello, Mr
Weiss
heard about your new project and was curious if you signed a director
Oh -- you haven't
Well, if we could get together,  could explain why 'm more qualified to direct this than anyone else in town
(beat) Uh, 'd rather not go into it over the phone
Alright
Great
l'll see you then
Ed hangs up and  excitedly
He kisses Dolores
She pulls away
Eddie,  don't understand
Why are you the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story
(nervous, he lies) Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air
had to say something to get in the door
: -  - Ed walks jauntily along, wearing a snappy suit
He reaches a door that says "  o George Weiss, President
" Ed fixes his hair, checks his clothes, then enters
o It's a crowded root, piled with paperwork and files
Film cans are stacked everywhere, and framed oneosheets for " ," " " and " " litter the cracked walls
Sitting behind the messy desk is  , 60, a rug merchant turned exploitation film producer
He juggles a large sandwich and angrily barks into the phone
(on phone) Look, when  said you could have the western territories,  didn't mean all eleven states meant California, Oregon, and uh, what's that one above it
Washington
Oh really
Well screw you
Georgie slams down the phone
He smiles warmly at Ed
Can  help you
Yes, 'm Ed Wood
'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed
It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more
Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before  had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky
(disappointed) So you're not gonna make the movie
No, of  'm gonna make the movie
've already preosold Alabama and Oklahoma
Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff
So we'll just make it without that she-male
We'll fictitionalize it
Georgie bites into his sandwich
Ed is dazed
Is there a script
Fuck no
But there's a poster
Georgie pulls out artwork of a hermaphrodite: Man on the left side, woman on the right
The lettering screams, " " It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa
(mustering up his courage) Well, Mr
Weiss, 'm your guy work fast, and 'm a deal:  write direct
And 'm good
just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism
Hmm
There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing
You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications
" Ed takes a measured piuse
This is his big revelation
Well, Mr
Weiss, 've never told anyone what 'm about to tell you
but  really want this job
(he gulps) like to dress in women's clothing
Are you a fruit
No, no, not at all love women
Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them
So you're not a fruit
Nah, 'm all man
even fought in WW2
(beat) 'Course, was wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform
You gotta be kiddin' me
Confidentially,  even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties
'll tell ya,  wasn't scared of being killed, but  was terrified of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret
Georgie sits back
It's a hell of a story
And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie
Yeah
know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you
My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out
Georgie shrugs
Ed, you seem like a nice kid, but look around you
(he gestures at the posters) don't hire directors with burning desires to tell their stories make movies like "Chained Girls
" need someone with experience who can shoot a film in four days that'll make me a profit
(beat) 'm sorry
That's all that matters
: o Ed sits morosely in a scuzzy bar, three empty shot glasses in front of him
ambles over
Are you gonna get something else
Ed glumly empties his pocket
All he has is change
Ed sighs, and staggers out
- Ed shuffles down the street, his head hanging low restaurant door opens, and an exits
Whitebread Dad, Mom, Son, and Daughter stride out in their starched clean clothes
They march obliviously past Ed
He watches them go, then continues
Ed reaches a building, " ," and glances in the window
pause, then he does a doubletake
The showroom is filled with sample coffins
Lying inside one is
- He is flabbergasted
- Lugosi slowly sits up inside the coffin
Bela is an aged 70- year-old man, once a great star, now a faded memory trying to hang on to his nobility
Quite frail and tired, he is still a master of the grand gesture
An   steps up
Bela speaks, in a thick Hungarian  which gives him an Old World elegance
Too constrictive
This is the most uncomfortable coffin  have ever been in
Gee, Mr
Lugosi, 've never had any complaints before
The selection is quite shoddy
You are wasting my time
Mildly annoyed, Bela climbs out
He straightens his cloak and walks to the exit -- where be bumps into nervous Ed
Excuse me, Mr
Lugosi
(irritated) told you,  don't want any of your goddamn coffins
No
don't work here
Huh
Bela peers at Ed, then glances confusedly over his shoulder at the salesman
Oh
Bela looks back at anxious Ed
Who are you
What do you want
don't want anything
'm just a really big, big fan
've seen all your movies
Ha
Bela strides out
- Bela hurries along
Ed chases after him
Why were you buying a coffin
Because 'm planning on dying soon
(concerned) Really
Yes
'm embarking on another bus- andotruck tour of "Dracula
" Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable
Bela pulls out a large smelly cigar and lights it
You know,  saw you perform "Dracula
"  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938
Eh, that was a terrible production
Renfield was a drunk
thought it was great
You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie
Thank you
waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside
apologize
When  play Dracula, put myself into a trance
It takes me much time to re-emerge
approaches
Oh, there's my bus
(he checks his pockets) Shit, where's my transfer
Don't you bave a car
refuse to drive in this country
Too many madmen
The bus pulls up, and the doors open
Ed is worried he's about to lose his new friend
He gets an idea
: 1948   - Ed drives anxiously
Bela sits next to him, filling the car with smoke from his big cigar
Boy, Mr
Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life
When is your next picture coming out
have no next picture
Ah, you gotta be jokin'
great man like you
'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up
Back in the old days, yes
But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela
Bela puffs on his oversized cigar
But you're a big star
No more
haven't worked in four years
This town, it chews you up, then spits you out
'm just an ex-bogeyman
(he points) Make a right
'  - Ed drives past pumping oil wells and into a seedy neighborhood
They reach a tiny, well-manicured house
Ed and Bela get out
(bitter) They don't want the classic horror films anymore
Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense
The old ones were much spookier
They had castles, full moons
They were mythic They had a poetry to them
(he lowers his voice) And you know what else
The women prefer the traditional monsters
The women The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them
Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth
The blood
The blood is horror
never thought of that
Take my word for it
You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula
" Bela's eyes twinkle
He reaches his front door and unlocks it
it's awful
Squalid, dark, with skulls and strange voodoo objects scattered about
Up front hangs a large photograph of shockingly young Bela, handsome and regal
Ed is stunned by this dismal place, but doesn't say anything
Within,  start  crazily
Ugh, what a mess
(beat) My wife of twenty years left me last month
'm not much of a housekeeper
The dogs  louder
Shh
'm coming
will feed you
Well
guess  should go
Perhaps we could get together again
(he shakes his hand) Certainly
But now the children of the night are calling me
Bela smiles and steps inside
The door closes
: '  - Dolores is in her 1950's kitchenette, making a green jello mold
Ed bursts in, euphoric
Sweetie, you won't believe it
've got the most incredible news
(excited) You got the job
Huh
(confused) Oh, uh, no,  didn't get the job
But something better happened
Better than not getting a job
Yeah
met a movie star
Somebody really big Who
Robert Taylor
(annoyed) No
horror movie star
Boris Karloff
Close
The other one
You met Basil Rathbone
Oh, the hell with you
met thought he was dead
Ed's eyes pop
No
He's very alive
Well
sort of
He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi
And he's really nice
Boy,  can't even remember the last time he was in a picture
It's a shame
He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore
So did you get his autograph
Ed calms down
He smiles beatifically
No
It wasn't like that at all
It was just the two of us, and we were talkin'
and he treated me like -- a friend
: - Ed is back in the plant department, arguing with his boss
He's a bum No he's not
Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years
"Dracula"
"The Raven"
"The Black Cat"
Yeah
Well now he's a junkie
He don't deserve to work
That's not true -- He's so great, you hire him
(defensive) Well, uh, if  could  would
The guy takes a mocking face and struts out
Ed glares
: '  - It's Halloween night
in trick-or-treating costumes parade up and down the streets
Through Bela's window, we see him and Ed watching  -- a small fuzzy screen in a huge console
'  - , one of Bela's old '30s horror films plays
Bela's evil character is hypnotizing somebody: His eyes stare the famous stare, then his hand does the famous hypnotic gesture
They are entranced
The men drink beers in silence
Bela's lie at his feet
The old movie suddenly stops, and  appears on the screen
Vampira, 25, is the sexy "Creature Feature" hostess, a pale ghoul slipped into a tight black dress
She leers in front of a corny fog-shrouded set
There is a pumpkin, a broomstick, and a sign reading "Happy Halloween
" (on ) Ooo
Those eyes
He gives me the willies
The only thing scarier than him is this guy  dated last week: Charlie from Pittsburgh
Boy, talk about the living dead
Ed is disgruntled
Ugh
hate the way she interrupts the pictures
She doesn't show 'em the proper respect
(glued to the ) think she's a honey
Look at those jugs
Ed
Bela waves his arm and starts doing his hypnotic hand gesture at the
Vampira
You will come under my spell
You will be my slave of love
(fascinated by Bela's hand) Hey Bela, how do you do that
You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian
(back at the ) Vampira, look at me
Stare into my eyes
Ed joins Bela in this activity
The two of them wave their arms spookily at the
Bela becomes fatigued
am getting tired
need to take my medicine
Do you want me to get it for you
No thank you, Eddie
'll be alright
Bela smiles
He gets up, shuffles across the room, and steps behind a curtain Ed is puzzled
Bela's thin arm appears and draws the curtain tight
We hear mysterious , drawers opening and closing, and then silence
Ed sits, waiting
Behind the curtain, something
We hear a muffled "Shit
" Ed is getting worried
But then the curtain whips open, and Bela bounds out, grinning
He's a bundle of energy
feel better now
The doorbell
Kids  "Trick or treat
"  Bela jumps up gleefully
Children
love children
Bela puts on his famous cape, then gets a pair of fangs and sticks them in his mouth
Little kids in Lone Ranger and Howdy Doody costumes giggle expectantly
Suddenly the door flies open, and standing there is Count Dracula
The real Count Dracula
The kids and run
Bela chuckles
Every kid is gone
except one
Aren't you scared, little boy
'm going to drink your blood
Ehh, you're not a real vampire
You can't turn into a bat, and those teeth don't frighten me
Suddenly Ed lurches out, menacingly
Well how about these teeth Ed    out of his head and thrusts them at the kid
The boy  in terror and races away
Bela is wowed
Hey, how'd you do that
Ed smiles impishly, then sticks the teeth back in his mouth
Dentures
lost my pearlies in the war
: - Ed and Bela run toward us, Bela's cape flapping in the wind
Ed takes a swig from Bela's flask
They're a bit tipsy
Are you sure this is okay
Don't worry
do it every Halloween
- The moonlight shines down on a rickety old cemetery
The wind blows hauntingly, and tombstones gleam in the blackness
Ed and Bela reach the locked gates
They glance at each other, then start to climb over
Ed helps Bela
They jump down, and Ed peers nervously
Now what
Bela looks like a child on Christmas morning
He takes another swig, then starts running giddily
He disappears into the cemetery
am
Bela darts happily through the graves
His cape flies behind him
am the
Ed's eyes light up
He starts chasing after Bela
Bela's heart is racing
He zig-zags past ancient crypts
Gargoyles peer down
The wind howls through the skeletal trees, silhouetted against the cloudy sky
Ed runs through the shadows, trying to catch up
Bela flaps his cape up and down
We almost think he's going to fly
Ed races up, then quietly stops
He eagerly watches Bela, practically expecting him to turn into a bat
It's a magical, crazed moment
am DRACUlA
will
Bela laughs, then lies down on the grass
Ed slowly walks over and lies next to Bela
They're happy, eyes alert, on top of the world
Ed peers in wonder at his new friend
: - Ed sits across from Georgie
Ed's very excited
So what's the big news you couldn't tell me over the phone
again
Ed gulps excitedly
He has a spiel all planned out
Mr
Weiss,  was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit
And realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful
(he thinks) Tits
No
Better than tits -- a star Georgie shakes his head
Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick
don't make major motion pictures
make crap
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something
Yeah
Crap with a star
(impassioned) No
It would be something better
Something impressive The biggest moneymaker you've ever had
Fine, maybe you're right
But it doesn't friggin' matter
can't afford a star, so  don't even know what we're talking about
Ed grins
What if  told you you could have a star for $1000
(skeptical) Who
Ed opens his valise and whips out an 8x10
Lugosi
Yeah
Lugosi Isn't he dead
(annoyed) No, he's not dead
He lives in Baldwin Hills
met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture
picture
(sheepishly) Uh, yeah
Our picture
Georgie mulls this over
He's interested
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick
Because he's my friend Georgie stares carefully at Ed, then finally smiles
Alright, fine
You can direct it
want a script in three days, and we start shooting a week from Monday
- He leaps up euphorically
He eagerly pumps Georgie's hand
Thank you
Bless you, Mr
Weiss
promise  won't let you down
: '  - on a
Ed's hands whirl across the portable typewriter, frantically feeding in pages as fast as be can type
We
Ed sits on the bed, typing
He's a blur of activity, juggling a cigarette, coffee, and a telephone, while he writes
(on phone) But Bunny, you're perfect for this job
You're so good at organizing
His adrenalin is pumping
Ed pours some booze into his coffee
You know these people
need all the transsexuals and transvestites you can get
(he sucks on his cigarette) No,  don't care if they're not actors
want realism
want this film to tell the truth 've waited my whole life for this shot, and 'm not gonna blow it
There's a  at the door
Ed carries the phone on a long cord and answers it
Bela hurries in, smiling broadly
Eddie, you got a new movie for me
Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture
You'll love your character
(back into the phone) Bunny, Bela's here
Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites
need transvestites Ed hangs up and resumes typing
Bela is puzzled
Eddie, what kind of movie is this
Well, It's about how people have two personalities
The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside
(delighted) Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde
Ah, 've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde
'm looking forward to this production
Ed stops typing
He pours Bela a drink
Ehh, your part's a little different
You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything
don't understand
Well
you control everyone's fate
You're like the puppetmaster
(getting it) Ah, so  pull the strings
Yeah
You pull the strings -- (he suddenly gets a look) "Pull the strings"
hey, that's pretty good
Ed quickly starts typing again
: '  - Ed and Dolores sit at a card table, finishing up dinner
The dogs eat scraps below them
Wipe off your hands
've got a little surprise for you
(he smiles nervously) finished my script
Ed anxiously pulls out a pile of pages
Dolores looks in awe at the cover: "'  ' By Edward
Wood, Jr"" Ed, 'm so proud
'll read it as soon as  get home
(apprehensive) Well, 'd really like to know what you think
Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it
'll Wait
There's an uneasy moment between them
She senses something funny
Dolores takes the script and goes into the bedroom
The door closes
Ed starts pacing
: - Dolores reads the script
She finishes the last page, then looks up
She is very shaken
Dolores stands
She grabs the door and opens it
Ed stands somberly in drag He's in a pantsuit, heels, and pink angora sweater
Dolores is totally rattled
She struggles for a response
So that's where my sweater's been
Ed silently nods
How long have you been doing this
Since  was a kid
My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing
It just kinda became a habit
Jesus Christ
And you never told me
This is my way of telling you -- (furious) What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see
What kind of sick mind would operate like that
Ed is terribly hurt
Dolores shakes tht script
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character
It's obviously 'm so embarrassed
This is our life (quiet) Of course it is
And that's why you should play the part
Oh
You got nerve, buddy
He calmly points at the script
It's a damn good role
That's not the issue (she suddenly stops) Ugh
How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that
It takes me comfortable
Oh, just like in the script
Ed smiles serenely
Exactly
(he takes her hand) So what do ya say
Do you wanna break up
or do you wanna do the movie with me
Dolores sighs
: - The hallway is filled with eager
It's a very festive atmosphere, and Bunny tries to create some order
Inside the busy office, Paul types, and Conrad cranks a mimeograph machine
It's good to have a job
Now  can get my phone reconnected
In a corner, Georgie angrily waves the script at Ed
thought this was gonna be a sex- change film
(defensive) There's still a sex-change -- Yeah
Five pages right before it ends
The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters
don't think he's a schmuck
And what's with this new title
My poster says "   "
So change the poster
Trust me, you'll be better off
This is a story that's gonna grab people
(he goes into a pitch) It's about this guy
He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses
Should he tell her
Should he not tell her
He's torn
George, this is
Georgie throws up his hands Fine, shoot whatever baloney you want
give up
Just make sure it's seven reels long : - We are on location for Ed's first film
of a dozen unpacks the camera and reflectors from their cars
Ed's voice rises above the hubbub
(
) Excuse me, could  have everyone's attention
Could you gather around
've got something to say
The crew members put down their things and gather in a circle
In the middle, we reveal Ed, in complete drag
Dress, nylons, pumps, lovely blonde wig
he's quite a sight
Like an eager Scoutmaster, he addresses his troops
Everybody, we're about to embark on quite a journey
Four days of hard work
but when it's over, we'll have a picture that'll entertain, enlighten, and maybe even move millions of people
glance at each other
Now the only way we're gonna achieve all this is if we stay on schedule
Day one --  -- we'll start easy
We have eighteen silent scenes that can be shot quickly: Cars parking, Patrick's suicide, me strolling as a man, me strolling as a woman, etc
(beat) After lunch, we'll bring in the Inspector and the Doctor
The Doctor is very important to the plot, so we might have to spend time on retakes
But it's worth it
Scene totals for the first day is thirty-four
(he catches a breath) Day Two, we'll be a little busier -- Veteran  , an old guy with thick glasses, speaks
Excuse me Eddie,  don't mean to interrupt
but 'm gettin' a little worried about those clouds
He points up
Everybody looks at the sky
The clouds are gray
Ed nods in agreement
Good thinkin' We'll talk about Days Three and Four later
Now let's get that first shot off
It's Scene 17, Glenda looking in the window
disperses
Ed quickly runs in his heels over to the burly make-up man,
Okay, do  need any touch-up
- 'm telling ya, eyelashes are the way to go
(irritated) Harry, we've discussed this a million times
don't want to look like a girl
want to look like myself
- (disgruntled) Fine
Then you look beautiful Harry humorlessly powders Ed's nose
Ed turns away and suddenly  into a giant megaphone
,
(nonchalant) Rolling
Ed chucks the megaphone and runs crazily past the camera and behind a building
' And --
pause, and then Ed, in character as Glenda , calm and dignified, steps out and walks down the sidewalk
Ed stops at a store window
He's totally in shadow
grip grimaces
He   a light Ed lights up
He looks in the window, admires a dress on display, then silently walks out of frame
beat
Ed
And,
'
Don't you want a second take, for protection
(exhilarated) What's to protect
It was perfect
Suddenly a police car turns the corner
Cops
We don't have a permit
Everyone grabs equipment and takes off
: - The company is now shooting inside a dinky soundstage
There are dirty mattresses tacked on the walls
They prep Bela's set:  fishnet-draped armchair in front of a flat
Ed is perched high in his director's chair, back in men's clothes
The set doesn't look right
It looks too
empty
Clutter it up
Put a skeleton in the corner
And what's that thing over there
don't know
Well it looks good
Let's use it
Georgie hurriedly strides over
He holds the script
Ed
What's with these revised pages
scene in a smelting factory
buffalo stampede
Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio Beach What's going on here can't afford to film this nonsense
Don't worry
We're not gonna film any of it
Then how's it gonna get in the picture know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free
This movie's gonna look like a million bucks
Georgie nods
Oh, okay
Mr
Lugosi has arrived
Ed jumps excitedly
Oh my God
(he ) Mr
Lugosi is here
Now everyone, when he walks on the stage (nobody is listening; so Ed uses his ) Now everyone, when he walks on the stage, treat him normal
know Bela Lugosi is a world-famous star, and you're all a little excited, but we're professionals
So if you treat him with respect, everything will be alright
The door swings open, and Bela strides in, looking dapper
He glances at the teensy stage, and his face falls imperceptibly
Ed runs up, bounding with enthusiasm
Bela
It's so great to see you
(he glances at his watch) And eight o'clock on the dot
Right on time
am always on time
Of course
Well, we got a big day planned for you
First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there
Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment -- (he leans in and ) Uh, Eddie, do you have my money
Huh
Oh yeah, of course
Ed and Bela step over to a corner
From a distance, Ed pulls a wad of money from his pocket and peels off a few bills for Bela
The crew watches, fascinated
: Bela is seated in the ratty armchair on the set
Harry does his make-up
Harry glances at Bela's arm, and it is full of Harry grimaces, but doesn't say anything
Conrad eagerly scurries up
Mr
Lugosi,  know you're very busy, but could  have your autograph
(cordial) Of course
Conrad hands him a scrap of paper
Bela signs it
You know which movie of yours  love, Mr
Lugosi
"The Invisible Ray
" You were great as Karloff's sidekick
Bela's face suddenly hardens
He snaps
"Sidekick"
""
Bela insanely  up the autograph
Fuck you
Karloff doesn't deserve to smell my shit
That limey cocksucker can rot in hell, for all care
Ed panickedly runs up
What happened
Jesus, Connie, what did you do
(upset, close to crying) Nothin'
told him he was great
How dare that asshole bring up Karloff
You think it takes talent to play Frankenstein
It's just make-up and grunting
Ed is frozen in fear
He glances across the stage
Georgie is flabbergasted
He points urgently at his watch
Ed nods
He motions to Conrad: Get out of here
Conrad runs away
Ed leans in to Bela
You're right, Bela
Now Dracula, that's a part that takes acting
Of course
Dracula requires presence It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand -- Bela waves his outstretched arm
Ed tries to calm him
Look, you seem a little agitated
Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk
and then we'll come back and shoot the scene
am ready now
Roll the camera
The crew is baffled
Ed shrugs at them
Um, okay
roll camera (unsure) Rolling
Sound
Speed
Mark
Scene Thirty-One
The Assistant  the slate in front of Bela, then runs
And
action
It's dead quiet
Nobody knows what's about to happen
And
he suddenly assumes character
Like the consumate pro he is
Bela gets a wicked, sinister leer, then starts intoning threateningly: (as the ) "Beware
Beware
Beware, of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep
He eats little boys
Puppy dog tails
Big fat snails
Beware
Take care
Beware
" - He is blown away
He quietly mumbles in amazement
Brilliant
: - Dolores studies her script, as the crew lights a flimsy kitchen set
Ed strolls past, nonchalantly removing a ladies' wig and earrings
She stares in disbelief
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people
Hon', nobody's bothered but you
(he gestures) Look around -- they couldn't care less
Ed, this isn't the real world
You've surrounded yourself with Say it a little louder
don't think Bela heard you in his trailer
Dolores quiets down
She feels bad
Dolores
need your help
: - scene is being shot, on camera
Ed (as Glen) and Dolores (as Barbara) stare into each other's eyes
He's dressed normal, and she wears a fuzzy angora sweater
(as ) "My mind's in a muddle
thought could stop wearing these things
tried, honestly  tried
" (as ) (tentative) "Glen,  don't fully understand this
But maybe together -- we can work it out
" She stands up, dramatically takes off her angora sweater, and gives it to Ed
He holds it meaningfully, then smiles proudly
Music swells
and  and
Ed and Dolores hug
: - On a , we see the black-and-white image of Dolores taking off her angora and giving it to Ed
Ed and Georgie are hunched over, watching the movie
Ed smiles proudly
And we fade out
"The End
" (the film runs out) What do you think
Georgie peers at his watch
He shakes his bead
think it's fifty-seven minutes long
Yeah
Whatever
So did you like it
(like a lecturing teacher) Ed, what was the one thing  asked you to do
Make it seven reels long 've got contracts with my exhibitors
If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it
Gee,  used every frame of film we shot
Maybe they won't notice
They'll notice
(beat) Look, why don't you let me take over from here
can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots
Um,  guess -- Good
And one more thing
think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea
Why
did all those things
Hell, even built the props
And you did a bang-up job, too
But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag
Trust me
It's a career killer
Ed is quite upset
But 'm proud
wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"
Yeah
Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he
Ed is beaten
: - It's the cast and crew screening
The eager two-dozen people are packed into a tiny screening room
The lights dim, and the movie starts
fanfare, and then: "Bela Lugosi in   " Everyone  excitedly
Bela smiles
Credits continue: "Featuring Daniel Davis and Dolores Fuller" The audience is audibly baffled
Bunny  out
Daniel Who Dolores leans in to Ed
Ed, who is Daniel Davis
(sour) Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses
: -, Dolores looks tenderly at Ed
(on screen) "Glen
Is it another woman
" Ed as Glen nervously ponders his response
But suddenly --   in
The movie cuts to buffalo stampeding Bela's angry face is superimposed over this
(on screen) "Pull the string
Pull the string
" People are impressed by this technique
Bela nods in approval
- Out of nowhere,    starts, and the movie abruptly cuts to   -
bare-chested man whips a bound woman
woman dominates another tied to a large stick
brunette violently rips off her dress and does a hoochie-coochie dance
The crowd is stunned
didn't shoot that
Ed looks back at Georgie, who's wearing a big satisfied grin
Georgie, what's with the stag footage
You said you were cutting in establishing shots did
established some tits and ass
Ed rolls his eyes
He turns back to the movie
- Everybody is , with a raucous party
People are boozing it up
plays
Ed dances with Dolores
Paul smokes a joint
Conrad falls over a table and breaks a lamp
Bela dances happily with a cute young
Wasn't  something
Did you see how  command the screen
Ed's giddy buddies stumble over with foaming glasses of beer
Ed, it was superb
great show
little strange
but great -- especially my scenes
Just like  always promised
Now you're among the immortals
You're movie stars
(he raises his glass) Here's to Ed
For making us into something
It's a warm moment
They all  their glasses
Dolores kisses Ed
: - We're outside a cute little Spanish bungalow house
Ed and Dolores are moving in
They lug furniture from a rented truck
From today on, our lives are different
We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did
don't know
It's so much money
Who cares
We're on a
These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab
But Ed, we're not even married
And you don't have a job
But you do
And anyway, 've got tons of new scripts
And now that have a track record, studios are bound to hire me
She just stares
Ed shrugs, semi-reassuringly
Look on the bright side
If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do
Toss us out on our ass
Exactly
- The house is moved in
Ed's unkempt dogs run about
Pumped-up Ed sits on the bed typing fiendishly fast while wearing an angora sweater
cigarette dangles from his mouth, and a bottle of booze lays in his lap
Bela sits quietly nearby
How 'bout a western
People love westerns
But,  don't like horses
Do  have to get on one
Eh, forget it
What else is big
(his face lights up) Teenagers
Jailbait pics
Yeah
You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks -- Who do  play
Uh, a cop
You play the father
He's angry He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his daughter behave this way
(cautious, not to offend) Well
can't  play the romantic part
'm tired of always being the bad guy
You know, back in Hungary, played Romeo
would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl
Ed considers this
Sure
Romance, that's great
To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures
Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another
(he smiles) That's good
could use the money
But we need to start off with a bang
Something we know the audience will want to see
Mmm
What was your biggest hit
(he thinks) Hmm
my biggest hit
That would probably be "Dracula
" Of course
Ed crabs a pen and excitedly scrawls out the word "
" Bela frowns
Those bastards at Universal
made so much money for them, and now can't get the time of day
So let's make another "Dracula
" Let's make "The Return of Dracula"
We can't
Those sons-a-bitches control the rights
They do
Shoot
There must be a way to get around that
Ed's mind is working
He holds out the paper and stares at it
Suddenly, he grins
He grabs the pen and makes a period after the "
"  It now says "
" Ha-ha
Dr
Acula
Dracula
No
Doctor Acula You can still wear the cape, have the fangs
but you're a doctor
Not a count
Ah
This is very exciting
(inspired) gotta type this up, while it's still fresh
Ed rips the paper from his typewriter, puts in a blank page, and starts typing
: - We're outside the imposing gates of
The lion logo is overhead
Ed drives up in his dirty Nash Rambler convertible
He wears his nicest suit
Ed peers nervously at the
Excuse me, 'm here to see Mr
Feldman
The Guard stares suspiciously at Ed
His filthy car is leaking oil
What's your name
Edward
Wood, Junior
The man frowns
He looks through his files -- then finds a parking slip with Ed's name
He is surprised
Oh
Eh, he's in the Executive Building
You can park in the reserved section
Ed smiles
- The room is very posh, with fancy paneling and marble floors
Ed sits nervously under posters for " " and " "  Film cans labled "Glen Or Glenda" rest in his lap
Sir, Mr
Feldman will see you now
She hits an electric button
large oak door swings open
Behind a giant desk is
, a glib, thin over- caffeinated man
He jumps up, smiling
Mr
Ward, it's a delight to meet you
(shaking his hand) It's Wood
Ed Wood
Wood
Ward
Wood
(puzzled, he glances at his appointment book) Hey, what do you know
It is Wood
Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one
Right
Ed shrugs
Feldman grins
So what are you bringing me
Looks like you got some film cans
Well, Mr
Feldman, some people have resumes to show
've got my own movie
Really
Well good for you
just made this picture, over at Screen Classics
It opens next week
Screen Classics
Hmm, don't know them
Nobody in town has seen it, so 'm givin' you first crack at my talents
can't wait to take a look
(he claps his hands) So what's up next
Ed leans in
Well, Mr
Feldman,  don't believe in thinking small
So 've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"
and "Doctor Acula"
Doctor Acula
don't get it
Dr
Acula Ed writes it out, "
," then waves it in Feldman's face
Feldman nods
Oh, "Dr
Acula
"   get it
(beat) don't like it
But Bela Lugosi's in it
Lugosi's washed-up
What else you got
Ed grimaces
Lugosi was 90% of his pitch
He vamps
Well
've got another project wasn't gonna tell you about
Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part
The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller
The title is "Bride Of The Atom
" Ah
Atomic Age stuff, huh
like it
(he smiles) 'll tell you what, Mr
Ward
Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and  will take a look at your little opus
Maybe we can do business together
Ed is elated
- Feldman and his fellow   sit in a plush screening room
They are viewing "Glen Or Glenda
" -, Ed is in drag
within the movie speaks: (
) "Give this man satin undies, a dress, and a sweater
and he's the happiest man in the world
He can work better, think better, even play better -- and be more of a credit to his community and his government
" They are stupefied
Yikes
#1 What the hell is this
#2 Is this an actual movie
#1 It can't be
#2 It's fuckin' ridiculous
Feldman squints at the screen
Wait a minute That guy in the dress -- he's the one  met with today
This must be a big -
(he ) It's probably another one of Billy Wellman's practical jokes
Everybody suddenly starts  with laughter
: - Ed zooms up and chipperly jumps from his car
He buys a "Los Angeles Herald-Express," eagerly opens it to the entertainment pages
and then gets a confused look
Ed quickly starts rifling through the pages -- something is wrong
- Ed angrily shouts into the phone
Georgie, what happened
thought "Glen Or Glenda" was opening next week
Where's the ads
An -   of Georgie on the phone appears
(pissed-off) "Where's the ads"
The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri
You schmuck, it ain't gonna play
Why not
Because  can't sell it to save my life
You made a goddamn feathered fish
Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick
Nobody knows
'm beggin' people to book it
(insulted) Maybe it needs special handling
Screw you, Wood
even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She
" " Led Two Lives"
It '
Nobody wants to see the piece of shit
You can't talk that way about my movie
"Your movie"
wish it was your movie
wish  hadn't blown every dime  ever made into this stinkbomb
If  ever see you again, 'll kill you
Georgie  down the phone
His split screen  off, leaving Ed standing alone
Ed stares at the phone, then quietly hangs it up
: - throws another  at the mat
The crowd  raucously
We're at the Saturday Night Wrestling Matches
In the stands are Ed, Dolores, Bunny, and Bunny's new "
"  Seated around them are hollering truckers and ex-Marines
Bunny giggles and nudges gloomy Ed
So guess where 'm going next weekend
don't know
Where
Mexico
And guess what 'm going to do there
(not enjoying this game) dunno
Lie on the beach
'm getting my first series of hormone shots
And once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and
Ed is astonished
Jesus
Are you serious
Yes
've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize 've got to take action
,
The truckers nearby stare
Dolores covers her face
Ssh
Will you keep it down
The crowd suddenly  and jumps up
favorite wrestler has entered the ring, massive  , 50
Tor is an incredible sight:  bald, lumbering behemoth
(amplified) Now entering the ring, in the gold trunks, 350 bone-crunching pounds of pure strength, the "Swedish Angel"
Tor Johnson
The crowd goes apeshit
The stands are going to collapse from the
Ed's eyes are the size of saucers
My God, look at that guy
He's a mountain
The bell
Tor quickly grabs his , a man in a blue mask, and throws him at the ground
Then Tor jumps onto his stomach, easily picks him up, and heaves him at the ropes
People
Ed is flabbergasted
've never seen anything like him
And once 'm a woman, Jean-Claude and are getting married -- (eyes glued to the ring) Ssh
He's so big
He's a monster Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie
He screams maniacally in Swedish
Tor lifts the Opponent over his head and tosses him into the stands
Three rows of chairs get knocked over
: '  - tiny miniature European car pulls up
Tor Johnson is squeezed inside -- ludicrously oversized for this vehicle
Tor carefully wedges himself out and enters the bar
'  - This rowdy bar is packed with burly
Tor walks in, and men cheerily yell out: "Hey, Tor
" "Hi, Tor
"  Tor grins
In person, he actually seems a jolly, outgoing fellow
Ed waves from the corner Mr
Johnson, over here
Tor smiles and lumbers over Glad you could fit me in your schedule
(in a hoarse  ) Da pleasure be mine
They shake hands
Ed's hands look like a baby's in Tor's giant mitts
Tor tries to sit in the booth
But he can't fit
Could we moovf to table
Oh, of course
Ed jumps up
They move to a large table
Now Tor is happy
He starts shoveling beer nuts into his mouth
So, Mr
Johnson -- Tor
Tor
Have you ever thought about becoming an actor
(he ) Mm, not good-lookink enough
think you're quite handsome
No
With hair, yah
But  must shave head for wrestlink
It scare da crowds
Dey like that
Ed smiles
Well,  think you'd be a sensation in pictures
But what bout accent
Some people tink  haf too much accent
Nah, that doesn't matter
It's a visual medium
saunters over
Tor, what can  get ya
'll haf eight beers
(nonchalant, to Ed) And you
Uhh, 'll have just one
She walks off
Tor shakes the now-empty nut bowl
And more nuts
Ed tries to grab Tor's attention
So anyway, 've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo
"  He's tough
brute
But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl
(he laughs merrily) like
When do movie shoot
Hopefully, very soon
'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr
Feldman at
: '  - Ed and Dolores are asleep
Suddenly the phone
Ed fumbles for it and groggily answers
Wood Productions
We hear Bela's weak
(on phone) Eddie
help me
Bela
(on phone) Eddie
please come over -- The phone hangs up
Ed is very alarmed
'  - The wind is blowing
Ed's Nash roars up, and he jumps out, a coat over his pajamas
He runs up and  on Bela's door
Bela
Ed tries the door
It's unlocked
'  - Ed steps into the dark room, and is stunned by what he sees: Bela is slumped on the floor, pasty white, eyes glazed rubber tube is tied on his arm, and a   lies next to him
The dogs crouch behind him, whimpering, despondent, Bela looks up through half-opened eyes
Eddie
my friend
Aghast, Ed runs over
Bela, what happened
didn't feel well
Let me take you to the hospital
No hospital
Just take me to the couch
Ed nods
He picks up the old man and carries him across the room to the couch
The large portrait of Bela, young and robust, peers down
Should  call a doctor
Nah
This happens all the time
Ed puts a pillow under Bela's head
Is there anything  can get you
Water
blanket
Goulash
(distressed) don't know how to make goulash
Ed sits next to him
An awkward pause
What's in the needle
Morphine, with a demerol chaser
(he starts crying) Eddie, 'm so broke
don't know what 'm gonna do
Don't worry
'll do something
: - Ed stands outside , talking into a phone at the guard gate
(on phone) Mr
Feldman
haven't been able to get through, so  just showed up
Yeah, out front
So, are we gonna be working together
(his face slowly falls) Really Worst film you ever saw
(beat) Well, my next one will be better
(beat) Hello
'  - Dolores tries to cheer up gloomy Ed
He's wearing angora
'm no good
Ed, it's just one man's opinion
Bela needs a job
can't even get a film going
(listless) But of course can't --  made the worst movie of all time
That's ridiculous
Ed sighs
All  wanna do is tell stories
The things  find interesting
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material
Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself
Ed looks up
- Ed sits opposite a
The movie is called "Bride Of The Atom"
'  - Ed continues, pitching to three  in white coats
It will star Bela Lugosi
Each of you would put up $20,000
- Ed stands at a busy intersection
He  into a phone
Yes, that's right
The Bela Lugosi
He's still alive
(beat) Huh
Is he available Friday night
Gee,  suppose so
Why
cut : - We're backstage at a '5Os variety show
It's exciting live : Showgirls, techies, and cast members dart about in a state of hyped-up tumult
- Bela and Ed sit in his dressing room, running lines
Bela is in his Count outfit: Cape, jet black hair, red lips, etc
They both read off
"Greetings
am the Count
" "Greetings
am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure
" Audience laughs
Applause
"Say, that's a funny place to sleep
" "It is my home
" "Oh, tract housing, huh
"  Laugh
"You need a new real estate agent
" "Beg to differ
This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --" Ed interrupts
No Bela, that's "incorporates
"  Look, just say "This casket has
" (upset) Ach
How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue
This live television is madness
An  knocks and sticks her head in
Five minutes, Mr
Lugosi
- Ed and Bela stand in the wings
Onstage is the  , a cheesy comedian
He is doing a routine with Criswell, the famed psychic who opened this movie
Criswell wears a tux and a turban and is acting mysterious
And then what's gonna happen
In 1960, the automobile will have retractable wings, so it can fly
Sounds like a heck of a way to beat traffic
Audience
Criswell rubs his temples enigmatically
By 1970, Man will have colonized Mars
Millions of people will live there
Ed is mesmerized
Wow
Ain't that something
- We're out in the audience
The curtain rises on a  : Shadows, cobwebs, and a coffin in the center
The Host walks onstage, to huge
He's playing his "Slick" character, a befuddled moron in a funny hat
The Host shines a flashlight around, and then the coffin opens
Bela sits up
There's more Greetings
am the Count
Greetings
am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure
The audience
Then
Say, that's a funny place to sleep
It is my home
Oh, tract housing, huh
(he starts -) guess  shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank
What a dump
Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy shower still don't know where to hang the towels
The audience  with laughter
Bela is totally lost
He seems incredibly confused
Uh, beg to differ
"Beg to differ
"  Hey, 'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank
(terrified, groping) Uh, Greetings
am the Count
Ed covers his face in embarrassment
: - The Host angrily storms past
told you we should've gotten Karloff
He exits
door opens, and Ed and Bela quietly step out
Bela, don't worry
You're better than all this crap
(distraught) never said  could ad-lib
Forget about it
We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again
They shuffle away
until Criswell and his snazzy burst around a corner
Even in person, Criswell is ethereal and quite self-important
He is delighted to see Bela
Mr
Lugosi It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you
Allow me to introduce myself
am
(morose) It's a pleasure
Ah, cheer up
Don't lose heart over what happened tonight
(he points at his temple) predict that your next project will be an outstanding success
Wow
And who may you be
Edward Wood, Sir
Ah
The director of "Glen Or Glenda
" (startled) -how'd you know
'm Criswell
know all
Criswell winks
: - Latin horns blast onstage of this hopping '5Os nightclub
Cigarette girls roam about
Seated at a front table is Ed, Bela, and Criswell's group
Everyone's plastered and laughing
Criswell shouts above the din at a
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis
Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine
No
never drink -- wine
The whole table
Bela cheers up
Ed turns to Criswell
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970
How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980
guessed
don't understand
made it up
It's horseshit
Ed's jaw drops
There's no such thing as a psychic
People believe my folderol because wear a turban and a black tuxedo
It's that easy
Eddie, we're in show biz
It's all about razzle-dazzle
Appearances
If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything
Criswell smiles knowingly
Ed nods at this profound wisdom
: - We're outside the legendary hat-shaped restaurant
large Eldorado pulls up, and a   and his step out and approach the
Excuse me
We're here for the Wood party
Ah, that would be in the Venetian Room, sir
The couple raise their eyebrows
They're impressed
- large banner says "    -  ' " In a private back room, Ed is throwing a
All his riff-raff friends are dressed in tuxedos and gowns, strutting about with flutes of champagne like they're extras in "The Great Gatsby
" Bewildered   wander around
Ed shmoozes them
We're gonna have the most terrifying monster ever seen on film
ghastly creature created from an atomic mutation
' don't like scary movies
go more for ones with love stories
(without dropping a beat) Well that's what this movie is a heartbreaking romance
It's about a young reporter, Janet Lawton, in love with a young cop, Dick Craig
Conrad and Paul sit in a corner
Conrad has a shoe off and is scratching his foot
Ed alarmedly runs over
What do you think you're doin'
These shoes are itchy
You can't sit You gotta walk around, with good posture
You want these people to think we have class
Otherwise they'll never invest in our movie
Two   have their hands around Tor's giant arm
Bernie, get a load of this guy
(proud of his size) Biceps 22
Chest 62
Stomach 54
Whew
You're quite a specimen
(beat) And you're gonna be in the picture
Yes
play Lobo
An excited   shakes Bela's hand
Mr
Lugosi,  can't believe 'm meeting you in person
This is one of the most exciting moments of my life
Thank you
And you are
Charlie Johnson

Criswell struts in the b

, talking to someone
predict "Bride Of The Atom" will be the biggest moneymaker of all time
In the f

, Ed introduces Dolores to a
And this is lovely starlet Dolores Fuller, who will play Janet Lawton
And how much will this picture cost
In a normal studio it would be half-a-million, with all their wasteful overhead and fancy offices
But because we're more efficient, we can bring it in for seventy grand
Hmm
Well 'll consider it
- Ed and his buddies wave goodbye to the departing backers
Goodbye
Goodbye
(to Ed) So how'd we do
(faking a big smile, but to Bela) We didn't make a dime
hands the car keys to the Conservative Backer
That's twenty-five cents, sir
The man glances at his Wife
She shrugs
gave all my money to the babysitter
The man grimaces
He checks his pockets, pulls out a handful of , and counts them out
: '  - Ed sits in a chaise lounge by the pool, studying papers and drinking shots of whiskey
He's in a woman's pantsuit and fuzzy slippers
Dolores marches out
Ed, the landlord called again
He wants his money
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production
Ed, the landlord doesn't care
That's the problem
Nobody cares about my movie
'm tryin' so hard, don't know what else to do
Don't get angry at me
Maybe you just need a day job
(upset) Dolores, don't you understand
'm a director now
made "Glen Or Glenda
"  Directing is my day job
(irate) All  know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes
Suddenly Paul hesitantly steps through the back gate
Uh, yoo-hoo
Excuse me
Sorry to interrupt, but  got some big news
(dour) Yeah
Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East
She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded
And here's the kicker: She's very interested in the picture business
- He slowly smiles
It's like sun breaking through rain clouds
: - We're at a fancy outdoor brunch
Ed is shaking hands with pretty  , 25, a pale brunette in a classy dress
Pleased to meet you
'm Loretta King
understand you just moved here
Yes
Hollywood is oh so exciting
walks over, with a water pitcher
Water, Ma'am
(suddenly freaking out) No
No water
'm terribly allergic to them
The waiter is bewildered
He hurries away
Ed leans in
So my associate Mr
Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture
Perhaps a small amount of money
(she smiles) How much do one of your motion pictures cost
For this one, we need $60,000
That's all
That seems very reasonable for an entire picture
Ed perks up
She's a live one
Ed pulls a script from his briefcase and hands it to her
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay
Oh my, this is very interesting
(she skims the pages) Say
do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts
(very enthused) Oh, of course
There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk
Hmm
Those sound kind of small
(stopping at a page) Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton
'd sure like to play her
Ed blanches
-Janet Lawton
Yes, Janet Layton is clearly the part to play
She's got some real meaty scenes
Can't you just see me in that part
- He is aghast
What a stomach-churning decision
He stares at Loretta, then slowly croaks a response
Uh
yeah
(beat) You'd be perfect
: '  - We  dishes being violently thrown
Dolores  inside
(o
s
) You bastard
You two-timing, dress-wearing son-of-a-
- Dolores is crying and screaming angrily
Ed ducks the objects she hurls at him
It was the only way  could get the movie made
Who do you think's been paying the rent
Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work
'm sorry
What did you want me to say
wanted you to say, "No
wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores
" But there's plenty of other parts
Like what (nervous) The secretary
Or the file clerk
Dolores is stunned
She hurls a pot at Ed
It slams him in the head
: - The sets are being erected for "Bride Of The Atom"
The crew hurries about the small stage, as Ed energetically supervises
He has a large band-aid on his head
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive
Like one of those mad scientist movies
want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes
You mean a Tesla coil
If you say so
Tor lumbers over, in his ripped Lobo outfit
His face has fake gashed-up scars
Tor holds the script
Edvard
haf question 'bout script
My vife Greta, she read
And she no like
Really
Was the third act too intense
(trying to be polite) No
She tink Lobo is waste of my time
Lobo don't talk
But Tor, it's a starring part
You're second billed
Bela, he talk
Loretta, she talk
But Tor, he no talk
Ed thinks
He quickly puts a spin on this
Tor, dialogue is overrated
You look at the classic film actors, who are they
Fairbanks
Chaplin
They didn't talk
They did it all with their face
(still bothered) But Greta say -- Loretta walks over, holding two dresses
Eddie, which dress do you like better
don't know
(he yells o
s
) Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one
Cameraman Bill is standing at the camera
He squints
Which one is the red one
(confused) What do you mean
mean  can't see the difference
'm color-blind
(beat) But  like the dark gray one
: The crew is shooting on a spooky castle foyer set
Bela enters, wearing a lab coat costume
As he slowly crosses, the old man rubs his hands fiendishly
Ed  live direction through a megaphone
Okay, you're Dr
Eric Vornoff
You're upset
You've worked so hard on this experisent, and you don't want to see it fail
(Bela stops, to "emote") No, you're not that upset
You want to keep moving
You wanna cross the room
(Bela exits) Okay,
Ed claps his hands triumphantly
Alright, let's go immediately to Scene 52
Tor, are you in place
' Yah
Okay,
Behind the window, Conrad pours a watering can
And roll camera
Tor enters, but can barely squeeze his bulk through the door
Finally he enters
Ed  through the segaphone
Okay, you're Lobo
You're upset
You've worked so hard helping Dr
Vornoff on this experiment, and you don't want to see it fail
(Tor stops, to "emote") No, you're not that upset
You want to keep moving
You wanna cross the room
(Tor exits) Okay,
Bela talks to Tor
At Universal, they shot two scenes a day
Eddie can knock off twenty or thirty
He's incredible
Cameraman Bill leans in to Ed
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take
Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway
No, it's fine
It's real
In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day
: - They are back on the completed lab set
Beyond the bunsen burners and beakers is a kitchenette in the corner
Wow, this lab looks great
Except why is there a stove and refrigerator
We couldn't afford any more props
If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner
Nah, it'll work
Where's Bela
Bela is asleep on a couch
Ed nudges him
Bela, are you ready
(he groggily wakes up) Mmph
Where am
You're shooting "Bride Of The Atom
" Scene 85
Bela nods
He stands up, then grimaces in pain
So he pulls two    from his pocket and swallows them
Ed walks Bela onto the lab set
You'll be sitting on the right
(he glares at the sparking Tesla coils) 'm not getting near that goddamn thing
One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu
" Okay
Then you'll be sitting on the left Ed turns to Tor and Loretta
She wears a wedding gown
Here's the scene
Loretta, you're in a trance
You glide in and get on the operating table
Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down
But you have an angora fetish
and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you
Okey-dokey
: - The scene begins
(as ) "Now we are ready for the girl
" Bela does his patented hypnotic arm wave
He actually has a powerful intensity
Loretta staggers in, eyes glazed
Like a zombie, she climbs onto the operating table
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty
lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit
" (he breaks character) Damn
Eddie, 'm sorry  can't remember all this
'm an old man
It's too long
That's fine, Bela
We're still rolling
Just say "Dear, you're lovely
" (he snaps back into character) "Dear, you're lovely
" (he turns to Tor) "Strap her to the table
" Tor starts to tie Loretta down, then gets distracted by a piece of angora hooked to his waist
He rubs it lovingly, calmed, then suddenly refuses
Bela is furious
"Do as  command you
" Bela pulls out an oversized  and starts  Tor
Tor screams in agony
"'ll teach you to disobey me
" Bela chases Tor around the set,  him
And,
Impeccable
He dances about happily
love being movie star
Tor jubilantly hugs Loretta
She grimaces
Ow
Not so hard, Tor
strides over to Ed
Hey, Wood
Your check bounced
Okay, 'll get you the money later
No
need it
Ed nods grimly
He grabs Loretta and takes her aside
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you
(he smiles) Yeah
Exactly
There's a pause
They stare at each other
kinda need it now
(baffled) What are you looking at me like that for
already gave you my three hundred
Yeah
Well  need the other sixty-thousand
What other sixty-thousand
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me
You misunderstood
gave you everything  have in the world: Three-hundred dollars
- He looks like he s going to throw up
Oh my God
: - The large stage door  shut
Ed's disoriented cast and crew stand in the street
Bela, Tor, and Loretta are still in costume
Ed looks totally dazed
He blinks in the bright sunlight
: - We're back at the Brown Derby, for another backers party
The same banner is hanging: "    --  ' " The whole crowd is there, dressed up
Bela sits in the corner, knocking back a drink
Here we go again
Paul whispers to Bunny
So is Dolores coming
(very catty) can't imagine why
wouldn't put up with a boyfriend who sold me out for three-hundred dollars
Ed stands with a circle of
He has an edge of desperation we've never seen before
lemme tell you, you can't lose
It's scary
And if you don't like that, it's romantic
Bela Lugosi portrays Dr
Vornoff, and lovely ingenue Loretta King is reporter Janet Lawton
Hmm
Lugosi looks pretty old
(he squints across the room) Which role is Vampira playing
Vampira (bewildered) Why do you ask
Well  see her standing over there
The guy points
Ed turns and looks and Vampira is standing in the next room She's at a different party
Well
she's playing -- (beat) Could you excuse me one moment
Ed dashes from the room
Vampira is drinking with a bunch of artsy-fartsy types
She's in street clothes, but clearly recognizable
Ed runs up
Excuse me, Miss Vampira
Yes
(sweaty) You don't know me, but my name is Ed Wood
'm a film producer
'm currently in production on a science-fiction piece, with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson
And  saw you here, and thought: Kismet
Vampira stares, totally uncomprehending
don't understand
Do you want my autograph
No
think my film is perfect for you
You want me to show it on my program
Well  got nothing to do with that
You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven -- (unyielding) No
don't want you to show the movie,  want you to be in it See, maybe  should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down
So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money
Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers
Vampire glances at her friends
They uncomfortably turn away
Uh, look, 'm with some friends, and we're about to eat -- (begging) Please
It'll only take a minute
You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers
There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard
(pissed off) Look buddy, 'm a big star
've got real offers from real studios don't need to blow some dentist for a part
So forget it
The backers glance into the next room
Ed is in front of Vampira, begging on his hands and knees
(to another backer) 'm getting a bad feeling about this
Let's get out of here
The backers pick up their coats
Through the doorway, Ed sees this
He jumps up and frantically runs back in
Where are you guys going
You can't leave
(running out) Goodbye, Mr
Wood
(insane) You can't go
You haven't seen the storyboards
The backers run out of the room
They're gone
Ed shouts after them
Fine
If you don't have the balls to roll the dice, then don't want your stinking money
No response
Please, come back
: '  - Ed and Dolores are being evicted
Their belongings are scattered in front
They bitterly carry furniture out of the house
Ed stumbles and slurs his speech
He is drunk Goddamn landlord
told you this was gonna happen
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party,  would've gotten the money
That's moronic
Why would a bit player impress a backer
(he starts yelling) Look, how many times can  say 'm sorry
blew it
thought she was rich
That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend
didn't dump you Get it through your skull --  just recast the part
Ed drops the furniture
He flops onto the sidewalk
You're a fuckin' mess
So
Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay
'm going to my mother's
Does she have room for me
Dolores shakes her head
think you should stay with one of your friends
: - Ed and Bela stroll through a parking lot
Ed is sobered up and remorseful
Bela wears a beret and smokes a huge cigar
Bela,  don't know what 'm doin' anymore
Stop worrying
This is going to raise your spirits
They reach the strange entrance to an avant-garde, Eastern based quasi-religious temple
Bela puts out his cigar, and they enter the oversized doors
- Sphinxes and Bodhisatvas peer down from the marble walls service is in progress
wiry, enigmatic  speaks
Thou eternal sun, who has covered the consciousness with thy golden disc, do thou remove the veil so that  may see the truth within
Bela leads Ed to a seat, stepping past men in fezzes and odd elderly women in fur coats
As the lecture continues, Ed in bafflement
What is this place
This is the Philosophical Research Society
refuge for free thinkers
've been coming here for twenty years
for the truth which is within thee is within me
And  am Truth
Most people in this country, they know nothing, about Eastern mysticism
They are afraid of it
(beat) But  am open-minded
It gives me hope
We have the wisdom to govern and the divine right to inherit the earth in good condition
We have the power to build worlds
Ed leans in to Bela
Was  wrong to cast Loretta
Bad decisions are easy to live with
Forget
Just keep looking forward
But was it a bad decision
At the time,  thought her money would save the movie
Eddie, you screwed up
(he nods) Yeah,  did
: The lecture is over
The speaker shakes hands with people
Bela leads Ed along
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know
where right or wrong will never be answered
(beat) Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me
The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture
Really
It was a very impressive offer
Fancy offices, a big home
'd be treated like a king
So why didn't you do it
didn't know if it was a trick
They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag
(pause) am Hungary's most famous emigrant
they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave
But maybe not
Correct
So instead,  stayed here, waiting for my comeback
Always hoping
the next film, the next film
that would be the one
They reach the exit
Ed stops in the huge doorway
Your next film
That will be the one
Bela smiles sweetly
: - We're in a noisy meat-packing plant
in blood-stained aprons slam cleavers into hunks of beef
Ed walks down an aisle with
McCOY, a wealthy Texan meat man
Old Man McCoy is a tough-talking, tobacco-chewing, straight shooter
and then Dr
Vornoff falls in the pit, and his own octopus attacks and eats him
The End
McCOY Whew
That's quite a story
So you made the movie, and now you want to make it again
(gently correcting him) No
We shot ten minutes of the movie, and now we're looking for completion funds
McCOY Son, you're too vague
come from the world of business
need to know what  get for my investment
Movies are very popular
You could make a lot of money
McCOY Yeah, but most of 'em flop, don't they
What am  tangibly guaranteed
Well
you get "Executive Producer" credit
McCOY That don't mean diddley
(he suddenly  angrily) You're cutting 'em McCoy grabs a  from a worker and slams it into a chop
Mr
McCoy, how can  make you happy
McCOY Cut to the chase, heh
That's good
That's very good
McCoy  his tobacco
McCOY Okay, two things
Number one:  want the movie to end with a big explosion
Sky full of smoke
But the story ends with Dr
Vornoff falling in the pit -- McCOY Not anymore
And number two: 've got a son
He's a little slow -- but a good boy
And something tells me he'd make a hell of a leading man
Under Ed's cheery frozen smile, his face clearly falls
: - We're at a  wrestling match
Tor Johnson is in the middle of a screaming, four-man tag-team event
Tor  his opponent to the ground; then tags with his partner and goes to the corner
Suddenly a   runs up, dragging a telephone on a very long cord
Tor, you got a phone call
Heh
They said it was an emergency
He hands sweaty Tor the phone
Tor speaks into it
Hallo
' Tor, this is Ed
Glad  could find you
got the money, and we resume shooting tomorrow morning
But 'm in Utah
' Then you'll have to drive all night
'm counting on you, big guy
Breakfast is at seven
Ed hangs up
Tor is flabbergasted
: - "Bride Of The Atom" is back in production
Ed's stock company is reunited
People drink coffee and gossip
This is unbelievable
woulda bet a million bucks that Ed wouldn't finish this picture
It ain't finished yet
Anything could happen
The stage door opens and standing there, in silhouette, is Dolores Everybody quiets
People glance nervously at Loretta
Uh-oh
Stay out of scratching distance
Ed runs over
Dolores is beautifully made-up, and wearing a furry angora sweater
Ed speaks, awkwardly
Honey, you made it
wasn't sure you got my message
(icy) Of course 'm here
Today is the file clerk's big scene
That's right
see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here
(she looks around) Say, who's the lug
In a corner, standing by himself, is dumb  McCOY, Old Man McCoy's worthless son
He's a good-looking, moody hunk
Tony is practicing his lines from a script, but he's terribly stiff
"Now Janet,  want you straying away -- oops -- staying away from the old Willows Place
" Ed shrugs
That's Tony McCoy
He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig
Oh really
How much money did he put up
None
(beat) But his dad gave me fifty grand
(snide) Wood Productions
The mark of quality
Hey, the movie's getting made That's the main thing
Dolores shakes her head contemptuously
Then she strides off
Ed stands alone, feeling bad
: The set is a one-wall "office hallway":  doorway and a water cooler
Loretta sits in a make-up chair, as Harry works on her
(
) Hey Harry -- long time no see
Harry turns, surprised
Dolores stands behind him
There's a thick tension
He smiles anxiously
- Hi Dolores
Oh, you're Dolores
've heard so much about you
'm Loretta King
(she chipperly jumps up) Here, take the chair
(bitchy) Don't be silly -- let Harry finish
You still need more work
No, 'm done
All  needed was a touch-up
Mm, that mole still shows
Loretta frowns
Ed quickly steps in
Ladies
You both look fine
Why don't we talk about the scene
(beat) Okay
Janet Lawton has discovered that Dr
Vornoff bought the old Willows estate
So now she wants to prove that all the monster stories are true
Dolores nods sourly
She s in a trouble-making mood
Eddie, what's my motivation
(thrown off) Oh
Er
well you're the file clerk
You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet
But what's our relationship
Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance
(annoyed) Dolores,  got five days to shoot this movie
Quit kidding around
: - We're watching
Projected  , a camera assistant claps the slate
We hear Ed yell: "Action
" Loretta hurries down the hallway
Dolores sees her run past and shouts out
(as File Clerk) "Janet, the boss has been looking for you
" (as Janet Lawton) "Thanks
" Loretta runs out
Dolores just stands there
We  Ed: "
" Dolores turns deadpan to the camera
Of course it was
The  runs out
The screening room lights come up on the crew
Ed sits in gloomy haze
Suddenly, there's loud  from the back of the room
Bravo
Bravo
Magnifico
(he smiles) Cris, you made it
Thanks a lot
My pleasure
'm always happy to assist in a little larceny
: - g pink Cadillac convertible races down the Ed and Criswell are in front, and Tor, Conrad and Paul to the back
My head is cold
You know how much this car cost me
Ten thousand dollars
Miss Mae West herself sold it to me
She said, Cris, you belong in a pink Cadillac
Criswell turns to Ed
Incidentally, you promise you're not going to scratch my car
(cocky) told you, the octopus is made of rubber
This is a piece o' cake
- The five men climb over a fence
They're breaking into Republic Studios
Paul is panicked
Ed, you said you were getting permission
Uh,  couldn't reach the guy
he was in meetings all day
But this'll be great,  promise
Ed smiles at Conrad
Conrad shrugs
Tor struggles
'm no good at climbink
Tor gives up, and simply  through the locked gate
Everyone is amazed
Tor laughs
'm good at bashink
Hey, keep it down
My publicist will throttle me if we get caught
They all sneak across the shadowy lot
Remnants of old scary sets tower over them
They reach a stage door
Ed tries it -- but it's locked
Oh
thought they kept this open
pause
Everyone looks at Tor
He grins
Lobo will fix
Tor grabs the heavy door and easily  the lock
- This place is the mythic eclectic prop room
Guillotines, rocketships, a stuffed vulture
strange mysterious props from untold movies loom everywhere in the darkness
It's a place of wonderment and fear
The men stare in awe
Wow
This place gives se the creeps
Let's get the hell out of here
Not so fast
First we have to get it down
Ed gestures above
Everyone glances straight up
giant  is lashed to the ceiling
: Conrad and Criswell are way up on the catwalk, holding onto dangling Paul by his belt
Paul leans way out, reaching for the octopus
He shouts nervously
You're sure this is gonna work
(
) Yes
You're sure (
) Standing straight below is Tor
The Swede has his arms outstretched, waiting
Ed supervises a good distance away
He motions to Paul
Paul gulps, then unties the octopus
It drops incredibly fast
The thing must weigh half a ton
Tor's eyes widen
And the octopus smashes straight on top of him
Tor is gone from sight
One of the eight tentacles snaps off
Criswell moans
Oh my God
We killed him
Ed runs to the octopus and looks for Tor underneath
Tor
Are you okay
beat
And then the octopus flips over
Tor sits up, battered but smiling
Bedder than wrestlink
- The five men hurry across the lot, carrying the hubongous octopus on their shoulders
Suddenly, a  shines on them
Hey
What are you doing
The men jump with fear
They break into a fast waddling run
Thank God Tor broke the fence
The team runs through the busted gate and escapes
- The Cadillac  away
The octopus flops on top of the five men
: - The movie crew is setting up for a big night shoot
Lights and generators are sprawled across this isolated area
Tony McCoy perches goofily on his own personalized chair
He runs lines by himself
"Now Janet,  want you staying away from the old Willows Place
" The octopus lays in a dried-up riverbed
There's only about an inch of water
Ed yells at Conrad
You don't understand
The octopus is supposed to live in a lake This is kind of a stream-- It has to be
Ed storms away
Conrad scratches his head
Bela sits inertly in the back of an open car
He weakly hails over Ed
Eddie, 'm so tired
don't know if  can handle a night shoot
Nonsense
You look great -- (suddenly he catches himself; he speaks more sincerely) Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap
We'll film around you for a while
Thanks, buddy
Ed smiles warmly, then walks off
Bela stares after him, then absent-mindedly searches through his pockets
Finally, he finds what he's looking for -- a rubber tube
Bela looks to make sure no one's around, then ties the tube around his upper arm
- Crew members have dammed up the end of the river, and Bunny fills it with a hose
There is now a foot of water Ed stands at the shore, admiring it
Hey
This is looking good
(he turns to Paul) Paul, where's the octopus motor
What octopus motor
You know, to make the legs move -- (defensive) Hey, don't blame me
You didn't say anything about no motor when  was up on that ceiling
Bela stumbles up, with a dazed smile
Let's shoot this fucker
Where do go
You'll be fighting with the octopus
Out there (he points at the water) What happened to the stream
This'll look a lot better
We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater
Oh, for Christ's sake
Bela rolls up his pants and wades out, into the water
He screams
Goddamn, it's cold
Once you're in it, it warms up
Fuck you
You come out here
(beat) Hey, toss me that
crew member throws Bela a bottle of Jack Daniels
Bela pops the cap and chugs half the bottle in one swig
He licks his lips, then climbs onto the octopus
Okay
How do we turn this thing on
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor
So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you
Bela stares, deadpan
Do you know  turned down "Frankenstein"
Huh
After  did "Dracula," the studio offered me "Frankenstein"
But turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough
It was too degrading for a big star like me
The crew glances at Ed
Bela, 've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight
Don't let me slow you down
Alright
Let's put it on film
Bela takes another swig of
, then throws it off-camera
Bela starts flailing around the octopus legs and  in horror
This image is truly ridiculous
Ed is pleased
Some crew members nod: Pretty good
And
Everybody cheers
Then suddenly the dam walls
The water rushes from the lake and floods the park below
: - Crew members straggle in for the final shoot
Everybody looks bleary-eyed from last night
Ed stands cheerily at the entrance, greeting them
'mon
Just one more day
Just have some coffee, you'll feel better
Tony staggers up
Mr
Wood,  only got one hour of sleep
Yeah
Well  got no sleep, and feel great
Ed sees Bela slowly shuffling along
Ed runs over to him
Bela
just wanna thank you again for last night
(exhausted) That's fine, Eddie
All in the line of duty
No
Seriously
want you to know how much  appreciate what you've done for me
great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning
Well, there aren't too many other fellas 'd do it for
(he smiles, then pulls out a script page) wrote something special for you
got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made
and so wrote you a new final speech
Ed hands him the paper
Bela starts reading it, as Ed watches anxiously
Bela is very touched
(still reading) Eddie, this is quite a scene
know it's a lot to give you at the last second
Bela looks up
These lines -- 'll have no problem remembering
: - They are shooting
Ed watches off-camera, as Bela acts a somber scene with an actor playing  , a threatening European
"Our government wants you to return
to continue your experiments there
Where you can have everything at your disposal
" (as ) "My dear Professor Strowski, twenty years ago  was banned from my home land
was classed as a madman -- a charlatan -- outlawed in the world of science which previously honored me as a genius
" (he gets very subdued) "Now here in this forsaken jungle hell,  have proven that  am alright
" "Yes, the authorities have learned how correct your findings were
So am here -- sent to bring you home
" (impassioned) "Home
have no home
Hunted
despised
living like an animal -- the jungle is my home
But will show the world that  can be its master
shall perfect my own race of people -- a race of atomic supermen that will conquer the world
" It's an incredible performance of crowning tragedy
Bela is totally drained
- He is very moved
He whispers, barely audible
Cut
It's a wrap
: - The wrap party is being thrown in the meat packing plant
People laugh and shout and carry on
Tor pours booze in the punch
&  plays
Old Man McCoy dances with Loretta
Bunny dances with a young stud
Dolores stands by herself
Bela and Criswell are giggling
So you sleep in coffins
Yes
There is nothing more comfortable
can't believe this
sleep in coffins
No
My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit
They  beers
- Outside, Vampira and two   walk up
They peer at a tin sign
#1 "McCoy Meat Packing"
Are you sure there's a party here
(holding an ) Yeah,  got this invitation
It's a "Bride Of The Atom" party, whatever that means
They open the large steel door, and  is the wild bash
Across the room, Paul and Conrad chat
"Glen Or Glenda," now that was a hell of a picture
Well, this new one's gonna be a hundred times better
Is that possible
Dolores overhears this
She stares in disbelief
Someone changes the record
Brassy   begins
door opens, and Ed struts out, in full gaudy drag
Everybody turns
They start  and
Ed grins, and starts into a wacky bump-and-grind
Go, baby, go
Bunny runs up and sticks a dollar bill between Ed's fake tits
People  hysterically
Dolores is appalled
Ed shimmies to the music, blowing kisses all around
He sees Vampira and waves
Vampira's jaw drops in recognition
don't believe it
It's him Ed sashays up to Bela and dances a few steps with him
The music is building to a climax
Ed hurries off to center stage -- and as the  , he does a final swing of his hips, then suddenly yanks out his teeth
This brings down the house
Everyone  their feet and crazily
- Everyone, except Dolores
Suddenly, she explodes
You people are
Take a look around -- you're all
The room quiets
Dolores has snapped
You're wasting your lives making Nobody cares
These movies are
(beat) can't take it any longer
The group is shocked
Nobody speaks
Dolores runs out of the party
Ed just stands, dumbstruck
Then he chases after her, in his high heels and dress
- Dolores runs across the parking lot, in tears
Ed catches up with her
Dolores, wait
Ed, it's over
need a normal life
(hurt) Did you really mean those things you said
Dolores stops
'm tired of living on the fringe
But you used to say -- Ed
just stuck it out so you could finish your movie
(pause) Now that it's done, so am
She turns and walks away
Ed is crushed
He stands motionless, in his dress, in the dark
: '   - Ed's new home is a single apartment, still filled with moving boxes
Half-eaten plates of food are scattered about
Ed lies asleep in bed, unshaven, in the middle of the day
The phone
Ed awakens and woozily answers it
Yeah
(on phone) Ed, dit  wake you
It's two in avternoon
No,  was just doin' a little work
(on phone) Bullchit
You been like dis too many days
want to cheer you up
'  - Ed drives his Nash though a tract Valley neighborhood and reaches Tor's little house
Ed gets out, still looking groggy
He walks up the tulip-lined path and rings the
Clanging   bong inside
The door flies open, and Tor appears, beaming
Edvard, you come
Tor gives Ed a back-breaking hug
'  - Ed steps in
The house is filled with cuckoo clocks and little Swedish knick-knacks
Tor gestures proudly
'm so happy you visit
Meet my family
Greta, Karl, and Connie
lumber out
Tor has the largest family we've ever seen
Not fat -- but big-boned is Tor's gigantic Swedish wife, and  and  are their two elephantine children
They  greetings: "Hallo
" "Welcome
" "Is a pleasure
" Ed cannot believe what he's seeing
- Everyone noisily eats dinner
The table looks like a Smorgasbord
Entire hams, turkeys, a full case of beer, incredible quantities are being shoveled in
Tor empties a beer in one gulp, then opens another
Pass the meatballs
This strudel is delicious, Mama
Ed is stupefied
He picks at a little dainty serving
Hey
You're not eatink
Uh,  don't have much of an appetite lately
The food will make you feel bedder
Look at me -- 'm da happiest guy know
All the Johnsons
'd be happy too, if  had such a great family
Don't worry
You just haven't met right woman yet
(beat) Oopsy
That cabbage goes right through me
Tor stands and hurries from the room
Ed awkwardly makes conversation
Greta, your husband is a terrific actor
You should come down and visit the set
don't think so
No, it's really no problem at all
(steely) do not approve of what you do with my husband Tor
He is not a monster
These horror pictures are humiliating
Ed has no response
Suddenly --
There's a loud o
s
, falling porcelain, then Tor   in Swedish
(
) Earl and Connie begin giggling
Ed is totally baffled
Tor runs out, angrily holding a
It is split in two
Look, it happened again
Ed is boggle-eyed
This house is sadness
Tor,  should be getting home
Nonsense
You must try our hot glug
: It's very late
Tor and Ed sit in the living room, drinking from a steaming pot of hot stilled wine
They are smashed
My friend, you tink Greta is first woman  ever see
No
Many duds, before  find her
But  thought me and Dolores had something
Forget her
Move on
good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish
Tor finishes his glug, and then his eyes roll back into his head, and he falls off the couch
He starts
Ed stares at Tor, then gets up
Ed turns off the lights and goes home
: '  - Ed smokes a cigarette and watches
Vampira is doing her shtick
(on ) Ooo
That was so scary, it gave me goosebumps
(someone  os
; she pretends to be angry) No, dummy
didn't say "goose," said "goosebumps
"  Ugh
Well, be sure to join me next week, for " '
"  Until then
pleasant nightmares
Vampira blows a kiss, then disappears into the mist abruptly comes on
He stares at the , then picks up the phone
: - Vampira is walking off stage
She removes her black wig
God, we need some better jokes on this show
carries over a phone
Vampira, you got a phone call
At this hour
(she takes the phone) Hello
' Vampira
Hi, this is Ed Wood
Who
' Ed Wood
You came to my party directed "Bride Of The Atom"
Oh
Yeah
You
Ed pauses, nervously
' Well,  was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner
You mean like a date
thought you were a fag
' No, uh, 'm just a transvestite
Isn't that the same thing
' No, no
like girls
So how 'bout Friday
(uncomfortable) Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type
(beat) But keep in touch
Let me know when your movie opens
: - Click
The phone hangs up
Poor Ed just stands there, forlorn
: - Ed shuffles down the street, Mr
Lonely Guy, feeling sorry for himself
He glances in a coffee shop, and sees a sweet young woman inside
Her name is  McCARTY
She wears a bow in her hair, Mary Jane shoes, and a fuzzy white angora sweater
Ed's eyes widen
- Innocent Norma sits by herself, eating
' Excuse me
Is that angora
Norma looks up
Standing over her is Ed, smiling
Why
yes
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing
suppose
It's very expensive
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas
What are you, an angora wholesaler
No,  work in pictures
'm a director-actor-writer-producer
(she laughs) Ah, c'mon
Nobody does all that
Two people do
Orson Welles and me
Wow
You know, you're a very attractive girl
Norma blushes
My goodness, you're embarrassing me
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth
(he smoothly sits down) Mind if  order some hotcakes
: '  - Criswell and Paul drive at night
They're dressed-up plays on the radio
So who's the surprise for
dunno
Ed was real mysterious
All he'd say was it's a surprise party
Isn't that like him
(beat) And isn't that like us -- that we show up anyway
They pull up to a
They're at a studio
Excuse me
We're here for the Wood party
They've rented Stage 12
Drive straight back
- There is another rambunctious party in progress
Crepe paper streamers hang down
Bela approaches Tor
So what are we doing here
Nobody knows
But there's a lotta booze
Suddenly Ed steps into the middle of the room
He's extremely handsome in his tuxedo, and beaming happily
Excuse me
Could everyone please quiet down
(the room quiets) First of all,  want to thank you, all my good friends, for being here tonight
And second, if you're wondering what the big surprise is
well,  '
The crowd is stunned
Many people  their glasses
Ed proudly pulls out Norma
She's in a wedding gown
Everybody, this is Norma They're bewildered
Bela
Who the fuck is she
never heard of her
Ed walks over
He hugs Bela
And Bela,  want you to be the best man
Bela smiles -- trying to hide his total confusion
: The wedding is in progress
The crowd is seated performs the ceremony with Ed and Norma
Norma, do you promise to love, honor, and cherish
Everybody is
didn't even know he had a girlfriend
(he taps him on the shoulder) hear she's an actress who gave him money
Nah,  heard she's his childhood sweetheart from Poughkeepsie
predict it's Dolores in a mask
The Minister is speaking to Ed
in sickness and in health, till death do you part
do
(he smiles) Then  now pronounce you man and wife
Ed kisses Norma
The crowd doesn't applaud
They're too baffled by this whole event
: Everyone's drinking and dancing
Ed proudly introduces Norma to his buddies
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma
Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma
Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma
(he can't resist) So how long have you known Eddie
(sweetly) Since Tuesday
Criswell grabs Ed and pulls him aside
Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing
Yeah
It seems a little crazy, but sometimes you just know She's perfect for me
Outside, a car
Oop, that's our cue
(to Norma) Honey, we gotta go
, Ed and Norma run out the door
The crowd hurries after them
Ed and Norma jump into his Nash
It says "Just Married" and is festooned with dangling tin cans
The car screeches away
The cans  , then slowly fade into the distance
: - We're at a desert roadside motel, the San Bernardino Arms "Vacancy" light flashes
- Ed excitedly carries Norma over the threshold
He throws her onto the bed, and they start ardently making out
Eddie, 'm just a small-town girl
've never done this before
(kissing her) Don't worry, 'll teach you
He helps her remove her wedding dress
She is very shy
Be understanding
don't know anything
Ed removes his jacket, then gestures to his shirt
Norma nervously starts unbuttoning it
Ed bites his lip in anticipation
Norma opens the shirt
and inside, Ed is wearing a bra Norma is horrified
What the heck is
Honey,  have a little secret to share with you
: - There's a loud woman's
Then the door slams open, and Norma runs hysterically out, clutching her dress about her
Stay away from me
You're perverted
Ed runs out after her
Please, be compassionate
'm your husband
No you're not
This marriage was never consummated
'm getting an annulment
: - Ed drives sadly through the streets, alone
His car still says "Just Married," and the tin cans  behind him
: '  - Ed's car pulls up
Ed stumbles out, yanks off the tin cans, and throws them in someone's trash
Ed despondently approaches Bela's
Inside, a light glows, and the dogs
Ed is relieved
Bela's awake
He  on the door
Bela, let me in
Bela, it's Eddie
He keeps
Finally the door opens -- and Bela stands there, shakily waving a gun Bela is doped up, glassy-eyed, and disturbingly haggard
Why are you here
Shit
Bela, what's with the gun
Why aren't you on your honeymoon
Where's Myrna
Norma
She changed her mind
She doesn't wanna marry me
(beat) Can you put down the gun
Bela weakly lowers the gun
' Ed walks in, in a near-stupor
Needles and drug paraphernalia are scattered about What are you doing
was thinking about killing myself
Jesus Christ, what an evening
(he looks around) What happened
(near tears) Eddie,  received a letter from the government
They're cutting off my unemployment
That's all 've got
Without it,  can't pay the rent
Don't you have any savings
'm obsolete
have nothing to live for
Tonight,  should die
(distraught) And you should come with me
Frail Bela points the gun at Ed
Ed is terrified
Buddy,  don't know if that's such a good idea
It'll be wonderful
We'll be at peace
In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work
Bela, 'm on your side
'mon, give me the gun
(he cautiously steps forward) If you give me the gun, 'll make you a drink
What are you drinking
Formaldehyde
Ed stares in anguish
Straight up or on the rocks
Bela drops the gun
He starts weeping
Ed walks over and hugs the shaking old man
Don't worry
'm sorry, Eddie
'm so sorry
Don't worry
Everything's gonna be all right
: - Ed's car pulls up at the South Metropolitan State Hospital
It's a grim, unwelcoming edifice
Ed helps weak Bela from the car
They look at each other, then Ed gingerly leads Bela in
- The lobby is clammy and dim
Ed and Bela reach the desk looks up, startled
My goodness, you gave me the willies
You look like that Dracula guy
(very somber) My name is Bela Lugosi
wish to commit myself
For what reason
have been a drug addict for twenty years
need help
The nurse nods
She takes Bela's arm and leads him away
Bela glances at Ed, then steps through a wide door
As it swings shut, we see a  walk over and shake Bela's hand
Ed stares at the door, dazed by all that's happened
He sits down in a chair, exhausted
Ed's eyes slowly close, and he falls asleep
: - Ed is still asleep, but now sunlight beats in
Ed stirs and wakes up
He groggily looks around, and sitting across from him is a woman, knitting
This is  ', 26, solid, reflective, with a dry sense of humor
Ed peers at her
Hello
Hello
(beat) You're sleeping in a tuxedo
got married last night
Oh
Congratulations
The marriage already ended
Oh
My condolences
Ed watches her knit
What are you making
Booties for my father
He gets cold in this hospital
How long's he been here
This is my thirteenth pair
Ed nods
He spots the Doctor walk by
Excuse me
(he runs to the Doctor) Doctor
'm with Mr
Lugosi
How is he
Well
there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man
Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone
Will he be okay
We'll do our best
: - We are outside Bela's room
He can be glimpsed inside, strapped to the bed and  in pain
He is going through painful withdrawal and shakes horribly
: - Ed strides into the hospital, wearing different clothes, and carrying a box of chocolates
He waves at the nurse
Hi, Lillian
(she smiles) Hi, Ed
Boy, he's got a lot of visitors today
He does
Ed is puzzled
He hurries back
- crowd of   and  overflow Bela's room
Ed is astonished
What's going on here
Excuse me
Decrepit Bela is propped up in his bed, as the mob of reporters throw questions at hit and  shots: "Bela, how long have you been a junkie
" "Bela, look this way
" Ed angrily pushes through
Everybody out
This is a hospital
Get out of here
Ed forces them out, then  the door
What happened
(in a hoarse whisper) Isn't it wonderful
After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi
(surprised) Bela, they're parasites
They just want to exploit you
Fine
Let them
There is no such thing as bad press
man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page
First celebrity to ever check into rehab
(he smiles feebly) When  get out of here,  will be healthy
Strong
will be primed for my comeback
Bela starts  heavily
Ed stares sadly
: - Ed sits tensely in the lobby, holding vigil
Kathy 'Hara walks by
Oh, it's you again
Oh, hi
You look beat
am
How's your father
He's better
Thank you for asking
(pause) How's your friend
Not good
Kathy reaches in her purse and pulls out two black booties
Well,  made him some booties to cheer him up
(beat) They're black -- to match his cape
She smiles
Ed slowly smiles in response
But this isn't his normal slick smile
It's gentler
Sincere
Would you maybe like to get a coffee
: - Ed and the Doctor stand in a doorway, talking
We thought Mr
Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild
Isn't he
No
They say his eligibility ran out years ago
Look, he doesn't have any money
but 'll give you everything 've got
have a few hundred dollars
The Doctor shakes his head grimly
That won't even begin to cover it
He's going to have to leave
'   - Bela lies sleeping in bed, pasty and pale of his hospital stay are tacked up
Ed anxiously tiptoes in
He quietly speaks
Bela, wake up
Bela stirs lethargically
Ed puts on a fake smile
've got some good news
The doctor says you're all better
You can come home
(so weak, he's barely audible) Really
don't feel so great
No, you look good
And the tests came back fine
(a poignant pause) 'mon
Ed gingerly helps Bela up
- Bela slowly gets into Ed's car
Eddie,  wanna make another picture
When are we gonna make another picture
Soon, Bela
Soon
: - Ed is desperately trying to cut a deal with the
Please,  just need it for one afternoon
Ed, if  cut a deal for you,  gotta cut one for everybody
This is different
It'll mean so much to me
All  need is a camera and a tripod
No lights, no sound
Nothin' fancy
And that's it
And one roll of film
The old guy gives Ed a tough look
: '  - Bela is dressed in his Sunday finest, standing in front of his little house
He wears a cloak and a wide-brimmed hat
This is so exciting
Another production
Out on the lawn
is just Ed
With the camera
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew
No, this is just the second unit
We'll do the main footage later
Oh
So what is the scene about
(improvising) Uh
you're a very important and respected man
You're leaving your house
and you're in a hurry to a big social event
Bela nods
He mulls this over
Okay
But what if 'm not in too big a hurry
What if  take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life
To smell a flower
(he smiles) That's great
Let's do a take
Bela goes in the front door
Ed gets behind the camera, then turns it
Okay, roll camera
Rolling
Scene One, Take One
(pause) And
There's a moment
And then Bela slowly steps outside, calm, dignified, walking with a cane
He looks about -- and then something catches his eye
He leans down and picks a flower
Bela smells the flower, then abruptly drops it
He starts crying
pause, and then he composes himself
The old man slowly shuffles out of frame
Ed peers emotionally from behind the camera
And, cut
Eddie, how was
(quiet) Perfect
Bela is pleased
Good
(beat) Now what about my close up
: - Ed's Nash convertible pulls up outside a neat little duplex in a nice neighborhood
Ed is dressed up for a date
He checks his hair nervously in the mirror, revealing an anxious boyishness we've never seen before
Ed carries a bouquet of flowers to the front door
He rings the bell
Kathy opens the door
She looks very pretty in a full skirt with a crinolin
Oh, flowers
didn't know you were so traditional
(a little embarrassed) just picked them up on the way over
They're very nice
(she smiles sweetly) Let me get my coat
- Ed and Kathy are at a tattered traveling carnival
Rattling steel rides and flashing lights spin about them
They stroll through the crowds eating cotton candy
Kathy wears one of Ed's flowers on her dress
So have you always lived in
No
'm from back east
You know, All-American small town
everybody knew everybody,  was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office
Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners
- Ed and Kathy ride through the old mechanical spook house
Did you find it boring
Nah, 'cause  had my comic books
And  read pulp magazines
And listened to the radio dramas
wooden  jumps out at them
They ignore it
Oh
loved those shows
"Inner Sanctum"
"The Shadow" -- (getting excited) Yeah
Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"
And then every Saturday, 'd go to the little movie theater down the street
even started ushering there
creaky  flies overhead
You're not gonna believe the first picture  ever saw
Your friend's
What do you mean
"Dracula
" Ed freaks out
That's
That's the first picture ever saw
Mechanical  drop down and flap around them
That is incredible
(beat) You know,  had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie
had to sleep with the lights on for a month
(he smiles) But  never missed a Lugosi picture after that
few years ago,  actually saw him do "Dracula" live
thought he was much scarier in person
- He starts at Kathy in wonder
He is overcome
Their car  through the tin exit doors
- Ed and Kathy's little car comes to a stop
He gets very serious
Kathy, 'm about to tell you something 've never told any girl on a first date
But  think it's important that you know
(beat) like to wear women's clothes
Huh
like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps
it's just something  do
And  can't believe 'm telling you, but  really like you, and  don't want it getting in the way down the road
Kathy is amazed
She contemplates all this
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls
No
love sex with girls
Oh
Okay
(surprised) Okay
Kathy slyly grins
Okay
Ed grins back
moment
: '  - Ed is on the telephone
We - with Vampira
(on phone) Vampira
Hi, it's Ed Wood
(on phone) Ed,  told you, don't wanna go out
No, don't worry,  moved on
was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster
" (confused) Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"
It's the same film
But the distributor wanted a punchier title
'mon
It's gonna be a big event -- we're going all out
Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming
You'll have fun
Vampira rolls her eyes
: - Hundreds of  and  enter a dilapidated second-run theater
banner says "'Bride Of The Monster' World Premiere
Celebrities In Person
" - An antique limousine  drives down a dingy street
Ed drives
Tor, ill Bela, Vampira, and Criswell are crammed in with him, along with bewildered Kathy
Everyone is dressed in gaudy "scary" outfits
Tor wears his frightening
My eyes are killink me
Don't worry
We're almost there
(still hoarse) Eddie, where are we
We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago
predict we're lost
(to Bela) Hey
You wanna watch the hands
Bela sheepishly removes his hand from her thigh
Sorry
(he looks around, baffled) Has anyone ever been to Downey
- The audience is so restless, they're practically rioting
They angrily
fat patronizing  steps on stage
Children, if you don't calm down, there won't be the entertainment
It was supposed to start an hour ago
- Tempers are flaring
My eyes are burnink
Hey look
There's the theater
Where
can't see nothink
- The hearse pulls up
runs over
Thank God, you're here
They're tearing the place apart
The gang awkwardly steps out of the hearse
Tor gets out and blindly walks straight into a lamp post
He yelps
Ow
Bela moves slowly, very feeble
Vampira smooths out her slinky black dress, then puts her arm around Bela to help him
'mon
This way
- Criswell points Tor in the right direction, and the group stumbles in
Ed escorts excited Kathy
've never been to a premiere before
The Usher opens the auditorium doors
It's
People are screaming and shouting
Kids jump up and down, on top of the chairs
Bela, Tor, Vaspira, and Criswell are alarmed
The lights dim on and off
Scratchy   blasts over the sound system
Wow
Go knock 'em dead
Criswell pushes blind Tor towards the stage
Tor sticks out his arms and scarily staggers down the aisle
Criswell nervously follows
Vampira escorts Bela
The crowd
They pelt our gang with popcorn
Tor  like a monster
Kids  and jeer
In back, Ed speaks in a frightening manner into a : (amplified) Ooooo
At the stroke of midnight, the witching hour, the ghouls arise from the dead Tor slips in some butter
He tumbles and falls
'  cackles
' It's the blind leading the blind
Tor staggers to his feet
All disoriented, he starts walking the wrong direction and falls over a chair
People
Criswell quickly helps his up
Dis is a nightmare
It's show biz
Criswell pushes Tor in the right direction
Some roughnecks knock down Criswell and snatch his wallet
jumps on his chair, ripping the stuffing out of the seat
He throws the fibers in the air, and they float over Bela and Vampira
What is that
think they're getting ready to burn this place down
runs up and grabs Vampira's breasts
Hey Vampira, how 'bout a little love
Fuck off
She impulsively swings her arm and  the kid
The Manager pleads to the mob
Children, please
Be calm
Somebody throws a bottle and  him in the head
He goes down
The lights suddenly go off
Some girls
Ed's panicked
He grabs Kathy and runs down to his friends
'mon
We're getting the hell out of here
Ed rounds up Bela, Tor, Criswell, and Vampira
The crowd  louder
Blind Tor is totally confused
What is happening
We're escaping
The group runs up the aisle and leaves
As the doors close, "Bride Of The Monster" starts unspooling on the screen
- The gang frantically runs out, scared for their lives
They look over
Some   are stripping the hearse
We're gonna die
The theater doors  open
The angry mob pours out
Ed spins wildly around
and sees a cab approaching
Stop
Kathy runs frenziedly into the street and throws herself at the cab
It screeches to a halt
Everybody sprints over and jumps in
The cab  away
- All of them are breathing heavily
They watch in the rear window as they drive away from the rampage
nervous silence
Until Bela speaks
Now that was a premiere
All of them
: - Bela and Ed stroll down the street, in high spirits
Bela smokes a big fat cigar
Last night was quite a romp
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits
envied him
(he chuckles) Hell,  envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that
Yeah, she's really somethin'
know none of my wives would've
Ed laughs
Bela puffs his cigar
Eddie,  want to thank you
These last few days have been a good time
just wish you coulda seen the movie
No problem
know it by heart
Bela stops walking
And in a ,  , he suddenly launches into his impassioned, climactic speech from "Bride Of The Monster
" "Home
have no home
Hunted
despised
living like an animal -- the jungle is my home
But will show the world that  can be its master
shall perfect my own race of people
a race of atomic supermen that will conquer the world
" Ed is touched
few people around them
Bela's face lights up, proud
An awed   hands him a pen and paper
Mr
Lugosi, could  have your autograph
Certainly
Boy, that was incredible
You're just as good an actor as you always were
Bela puffs out his chest majestically
Better
(beat) 'm seventy-four, but  don't know it
If the brain is young, then the spirit is still vigorous
like a young man
Bela turns and smiles wanly at Ed
Ed smiles back
: '  - Ed and Kathy stand in his kitchen, making dinner
She sticks her finger in a pot
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious
Thanks
It's actually the only thing know how to make
(he motions) Hey, can you grab that strainer
She holds a strainer
Ed pours the spaghetti over it
Suddenly the  rings
Ed groans
Ugh
Always at the wrong time
(he  the phone) Hello
He listens
And then, he gets a very somber expression
Oh no
Ed   the phone
He looks pained
What was that
(quiet) Bela died
: - It's Bela's funeral
Ed sits crying in the front row, with Kathy at his side
All Bela's friends are there
They're very subdued
Bela lies inside, made up in his full Dracula outfit
His hair is died black, and he wears the famous cape
- On a grassy hill, Bela is laid to rest
The small crowd of mourners stands silhouetted against the dark gray clouds
The coffin is lowered into the ground
Ed stands at the front, silently watching
few   snap pictures
#1 Whose crazy idea was it to bury him in the cape
#2 heard it was in the will
It was how he wanted to be remembered
: - Ed is alone in a darkened screening room, depressed
Playing on the  is the last footage of Bela: Bela stumbles around in front of his house and smells the flower
Ed drinks out of a flask
The film runs out
comes over a loudspeaker
Do you want me to run it again
Ed silently nods
: '  - Ed's apartment has gone to hell
Ed is in a robe, unshaven and clutching a bottle of whiskey
Newspapers are everywhere
Bela's and Ed's dogs eat out of the trash
Kathy tries to straighten things up
Ed stares listlessly
'd seen him in a coffin so many times,  expected him to jump out
Ed, you've got to snap out of this
Bela's dead -- you're not might as well be
made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see
(beat) blew it
All he wanted was a comeback
that last glory
Well you tried -- (angry) was a fuckin'
let people recut the movies, cast their relatives
(beat) let Bela down
: '   - new Studebaker pulls up
bumper sticker says " " man in a plain brown suit steps out
This is , 50, Ed's santironious southern Christian landlord
Reynolds assertively bangs on Ed's front door
Mr
Wood
(
) Hruphh
Mr
Wood, this is Mr
Reynolds, your landlord
Could you please open up
The door opens a crack
Bleary Ed peers out
Yeah
Mr
Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check
(he sloppily lies) 'm real sorry
My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account
'mon in, 'll write you another one
- Ed motions Reynolds in
Reynolds peers unsurely at the tornado inside
Then he notices a framed one-sheet for " "  Reynolds admires it
Hmm, so you're in the picture business
(rummaging for a check) You could say that -- 'm interested in the picture business
My associates and  wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles
But unfortunately, we don't have enough money
(distracted) Raising money is tough
Oh
Our church has the money for one film
We just don't have it for all twelve
- His eyes suddenly pop
The color comes back to his fact
plan is quickly boiling over inside Ed's head
He starts feverishly pacing around
Okay -- you know what you do
You produce a film in a commercially proven genre
And after it's a hit, you take the profits from that , and make the twelve Apostles' movies
Would that work
Absolutely
You see this script
Ed randomly grabs a script off the messy floor, then glances down, to see which one he picked up
It says "Graverobbers From Outer Space
" "Graverobbers From Outer Space"
It's money in the bank Graverobbers from what From outer space
It's science- fiction
Very big with the kids
If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a religious films
(beat) And pay my back rent from the profits
Reynolds scratches his head
don't know
this is all a lot to absorb
It's a guaranteed blockbuster
Um,  understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars
(in a frenzy) Yeah, well we've  a big star
Bela Lugosi
(mystified) Lugosi Didn't be pass on
Ed grins maniacally
He grabs a   of 35mm film
Yes, but 've got the last footage he ever shot
Just, it doesn't look like very much
It's plenty
It's the acorn that will grow a great oak
'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film" beat
Reynolds stares, intrigued
: '  - The place is cleaned-up
Ed shouts excitedly into the phone
Bunny
We're making another film
Yeah --  got the Baptist Church of Beverly Hills to put up the cash
Paul sticks his head in
Ed,  got the Lugosi lookalikes outside
Great
Bring 'em in
Bunny,  gotta run
Ed hangs up
Paul leads in
They look nothing like Bela
One is a  , one is a   , and one is
Ed inspects them
Too tall
too short
(he glances at the Chinese guy) And this guy doesn't work at all
Well  was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu
" That was Karloff
(beat) Paul, you gotta try harder
don't want this film to be haif-assed
This time, we go for the quality
Paul turns to go
And by the way, keep Sunday free
The producers want all of us to get baptized
: '  - Kathy reads a newspaper while knitting an angora sweater
Ed is typing deliriously fast -- in one of his artistic fevers
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right
The left
It's more natural
(he squints at his script) Hey, 've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb
What would that be made of
Uh, atomic energy
No
They're beyond that
They're smarter than the humans
What's more advanced
Dynamite -- No,
What's the biggest energy
The sun
(ecstatic) Yes
Solar energy
Oh that's gonna seem so scientific
(he resumes ) This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film
No compromises Kathy suddenly jumps up, shocked
Oh my God
Look at this
She runs over and shows Ed the newspaper
- small headline says "
"  Underneath is the story: "Channel 7 has fired popular horror hostess Vampira, after learning of her suspected communist leanings
" They're astonished
Those assholes
The poor girl's out of a job
Yeah
(he looks up) should give her a call
: - Ed and Kathy sit with a shaken-up Vampira
'm really sorry
It's terrible
People won't even return my calls
It's like  don't exist
know what that's like
(he pulls out his ) Anyway,  brought a copy of the script
You would play the "Ghoul's Wife
" (she grimaces) The Ghoul's Wife God,  can't believe 'm doing this
You should feel lucky
Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people
(he laughs) Hell, if  did,  wouldn't have any friends
Vampira smiles uncomfortably
Look
would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie
You don't wanna be noticed
Exactly
Hey, how 'bout this -- what if  don't have any lines
'll do the part mute
Kathy suddenly sees someone
Look, it's Dr
Tom
(she ) Hey, Dr
Tom
Who's Dr
Tom
My chiropractor
, a tall, slender 35-year-old chiropractor, strides over
He smiles
Kathy, how are you
You're looking in alignment today
Actually, my neck's a little funny
Dr
Mason grabs Kathy's neck and  it loudly
Ed stares at the Doctor in astonishment
Ed is riveted
Wait a second
Don't move
Ed excitedly jumps up, takes his , and covers the Doctor's face from the nose down
It's uncanny What's uncanny
: - Services are in progress
Edward Reynolds leads a singing an emotional
Ed, Tor, Criswell, Paul, Conrad, Vampira, Kathy, Bunny, and Dr
Tom Mason sit in back
They're all wearing white robes and arguing about the doctor
He look nutink like Bela
He's kinds got his ears
You're stupid
No, cover up his face
Kathy lifts Dr
Mason's robe over his bewildered face
Ah
Now  see it
(goofily imitating Bela) " want to suck your blood
" Everybody  up
Ed waves his arms
We want these Baptists to like us
Like bad kids, they quiet down
Ingenuous Southern speaks up front
Brothers and Sisters, we've reached a special part of the service
The baptism of our new members
(beat) If the congregation will oblige, we'd like to adjourn and reconvene at Emma DuBois's back yard
- The straight-laced, devout  is gathered around a large
Reverend Lemon, Reynolds, and our misfits stand in the shallow end, in their white robes
Criswell whispers to Vampira
Why couldn't we do this in the church
Because "Brother Tori couldn't fit in the sacred tub
: Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior
do
Reynolds  Ed in the water
Do you reject Satan and all his works
(hiding a smirk) do
Reynolds  Bunny
Do you repent for all your sins
do
Tor winks slyly at Criswell
Reynolds  Tor
But Tor slips from Reynolds' grasp and sinks to the bottom of the pool
Oh my God,  dropped him -- Tor lies on the bottom, staring lifeinsly
(mischievous) don't think he's coming up
Lord no
The man's drowning
(scared) What do we do
Help
The whole Congregation starts
Men and women in their Sunday finest leap into the pool and start tugging on Tor
But nobody can budge the big whale
(near tears) Dear Jesus, please forgive us
He suddenly rises, Poseidon-like, from the pool
Tor spits out water, then lets out a hearty
Tor make good joke
The Baptists aren't amused
: - bus drives along
Every  stares at something up front -- Vampira, in her slinky black outfit She reads a "Grave Robbers From Outer Space" script
- The bus stops in a scary, run-down neighborhood
Vampira off and warily looks around
This can't be the right address
She nervously walks down a dingy alley
Vampira gets to an unmarked grimy door, gulps, then slowly opens it
- And inside is the "Grave Robbers From Outer Space" famous The film is in production
Packed into a stinking little studio are a few scrawny twigs, branches, and flimsy cardboard tombstones set against a black drop
Tot struts about gregariously, in his "Inspector Clay" suit
He chats up the
am so happy
Finally  am star wit dialogue memorized every wordt
Eddie will be so proud
The Baptists chase Ed around
They wave the script
Before we start shooting, Mr
Wood, we have a few questions -- The script refers on numerous occasions to graverobbing
Now we find the concept of digging up consecrated ground highly offensive
It's blasphemy
(very annoyed) What are you talking about
It's the premise of the movie
It's even the title, for Christ's sake
(shocked) Mr
Wood
Yes, about that title, it strikes us as very inflammatory
Why don't we change it to " Plan Nine From Outer Space"
Ed shakes his head
That's ridiculous
: They're filming the  arriving at the pitch-black cemetery
There's a prop police car, and an assistant blows fog in
And,
Tor steps onto the set (as Inspector Clay) "Medicul eksaminer been aroundt yet
" "Just left
The morgue wagon oughta be along most any time
" "You get statement frumk vitnesses
" "Yeah, but they're pretty scared
" "Findink mess like dis oughta make anyone frightened
Have one of da boyz take dem back to town
You take jarge
" Everybody grices, trying to understand Tor
The shakes her head
The Baptists angrily pull Ed aside
What'd you give him all the lines for
He's unintelligible
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk
Ihad to give somebody the dialogue
That's not an answer
: - As Inspector Clay, Tor wanders around the "cemtery," waving his flashlight and nervously fingering his gun
Ed grins at the Baptists
See, no talking
Isn't he good
(he grabs his ) (o
s
) Now
, The door of a large paper-mache crypt creeps open
Dr
Tom uncertainly steps out, impersonating Bela
He holds the cape over his face and stalks Tor
Ed is pleased as punch
He whispers to the Baptists
Isn't it wonderful
Bela lives
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid
No, he would've loved it
Bela's returned from the grave -- like Dracula
(he grabs the ) Vampira steps out, walking in a trance
Tor is now cornered
He fruitlessly  his gun, but bullets can't stop zombies
Vampira and Dr
Tom kill him
Tor screams
: - Paul and Conrad are scared cops exploring the cemetery
(as a cop) "Let's go down and find out whose grave it is
" (as a cop) "Why do  always get hooked up with these spook details
Monsters
Graves
Bodies
" ,
Off-stage, a grip on a ladder pans a 10K
The  crosses the actors
They look up in horror, then clumsily fall down
rickety fake tombstone tips over
And
(freaking out) "Perfect"
Mr
Wood, do you know anything about the art of film production
like to think so
That cardboard headstone tipped over
This graveyard is obviously phony
People won't notice
Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture
Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"
How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night
Ed suddenly flips out
He's livid
'
Haven't you ever heard of "suspension of disbelief"
walks up
He smiles at the Baptists, Reverend, 'm here
(baffled) Who's he This is our choir director
He's gonna play the young hero
(furious) Are you IN5ANE
'm the director
make the casting decisions around here
thought this was a group effort
Ed spastically storms away
- Ed bursts in
He paces about, hysterically traumatized
They're driving me crazy
These Baptists are stupid, stupid,
Ed glances at a clothing rack -- and sees an
Ed is taken aback
He slowly removes it from the hanger and rubs it against his face
His breathing slows
Mmm
need to calm
Take deep breaths
(he rubs the angora) Ohh, it's so smooth
- The dressing room door flies open
Ed slowly struts out, in the sweater, pantsuit, and pumps He is calmed and at ease
The stage quiets
People are staring
Okay, everyone
Let's set up for Scene 112
Move the crypt stage left and get ready with Tor's make-up effect
The crew resumes working
But the Baptists charge up, aghast
Mr
Wood
What do you think you're doing 'm directing
Not like , you're not
Remove that get-up immediately
You shame our Lord
Ed throws up his hands
That's it
give up
: - Ed frantically marches out of the building
He's still in his ladies' outfit
Ed sees a cab and  loudly
The cab pulls over
Ed jumps in
Take me to the nearest bar
: &  - The place is quiet, mid-morning
Frazzled Ed enters and sits at the bar
Imperial whiskey, straight up
The bartender nonchalantly pours a shot
Ed takes the drink
He quietly sips his booze and reflects upon his day
Ed glances around
And then, suddenly -- his eyes widen
Sitting at a table is
The portly, world-famous filmmaker sits alone, eating lunch with one hand and drawing with the other
Ed is thunderstruck
Oh my God
It's Orson Welles
Ed nervously stands
He starts to step forward -- when he catches his own reflection in a mirror
He's still in drag
Oh shit
Ed rolls his eyes
He runs his hand through his hair, then slowly approaches Orson Welles
Ed is terrified
Excuse me, Sir
(he casually looks up) Yes
Uh, uh, 'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan
and  just wanted to meet you
(he extends his hand) My pleasure
'm Orson Welles
Oh
Um, 'm Ed Wood
(he smiles anxiously) So, what are you working on now
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote
" So 'm trying to finish a promo for something else
But  can't find the soundtrack -- (he shrugs) think  left it in Malta
Ed is astonished
can't believe it
These sound like my problems
It's the damn money men
You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods
And then they all think they're a director
Ain't that the truth
've even bad producers recut my movies -- Ugh,  hate when that happens
(on a roll) And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even matter if they're right for the part
Tell me about it
'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a Mexican Ed shakes his head
He's discouraged
Mr
Welles, is it all worth it
It is when it works
(solemn) You know the one film of mine  can stand to watch
"Kane
"  The studio hated it
but they didn't get to touch a frame
(he smiles warmly) Ed, visions are worth fighting for
Why spend your life making someone else's dreams
- He has seen God
Wow
: - Ed bursts onto the stage, a changed man
Re-energized, he confidently grabs the Baptists
Mr
Reynolds
Yes
We are gonna finish this film just the way  want it Because you can't compromise an artist's vision
(flustered) -but it's our money -- And you're gonna make a bundle
This movie's gonna be famous
But only if you  , and let me do it my way
Reynolds and Rev
Lemon are speechiess
- He beams, turns and   into the soundstage
' : " 9" : Tor plays a zombie rising from the dead
He wears the scary white contact lenses
Tor's so big, he has trouble lifting himself from the grave
Ed and his stock footage buddy watch a moviola
Okay,  want that tank
And  want that bomb
Harry paints Bunny's face , like a Martian
Ed yells
The aliens should look like people
- 'm tellin' ya, aliens are always green
Not in my movie , they're not
Bunny's make-up is now normal
He wears an alien suit
enters and salutes with a bizarre crossing gesture
"What plan will we follow
" "Plan Nine
" "Plan Nine
" (he consults his papers) "Ah yes
Plan Nine deals with the resurrection of the dead
" Tor staggers up to Paul Marco and  him
- Ed smiles at the Baptists
Maybe you guys were right
"Plan Nine" is a good title
Ed shoots the famous flying saucers
Paul holds a paper plate and Conrad lights it on fire
The "saucer" soars on fishing line over a little miniature town
Dr
Tom glides in, his cape over his face
woman
Ed stands in front of a masonite board and two chairs
An actor playing the   walks up
Where's the cockpit set
You're standing in it
(he yells off) Alright, bring in the shower curtain
shower curtain gets lowered into the doorway
car zooms by
Kathy drives, as Ed shoots handheld out the back window
Th Hammy Alien argues with the humans
"So what if we develop this solarnite bomb
We'd be even a stronger nation
" "Stronger
You see
You see
Your stupid minds
Stupid
" "That's all 'm taking from you
" He  the alien
brawl breaks out
Criswell lectures behind a desk, with mysterious lighting "Perhaps on your way home, someone will pass you in the dark, and you will never know it
For they will be from outer space
" The famous shot: Tor and Vampira walk in a trance through foggy cemetery
Off-stage, Ed stands with the crew
He shouts gleefully
More fog
More fog
(he beams) And
'
: - It's pouring rain
Standing in the drench is Ed
He's wearing a tux, and fighting with his open convertible top
The Rambler is filled with water
Kathy stands under an awning
She wears a pretty gown
can't get it to go up
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere
(he gives up) 'mon
Let's just go
Ed impulsively opens the car door
Water pours out
Kathy scurries out and jumps in the wet car with him
- The rain is gushing down
The marquee proclaims " :  9
" People hurry in
Ed and Kathy roar up in the open convertible, totally soaked
He jumps out, opens her door, and they run inside
- The theater is packed
All the gang, and their friends and families, are gathered
Criswell stands on-stage, speaking into a mike
You are about to see en extraordinary motion picture
But before it begins,  think we ought to give a hand to the man without whom we wouldn't be here tonight
Eddie, take a bow
The crowd  in applause
Everybody goes crazy -- even the Baptists
People  "Speech
Speech
" Ed smiles proudly
Kathy kisses him
Ed runs down front, hugs Criswell, then takes the microphone
Thanks a million
just wanna say
this film is for Bela
The lights dim
: The title " 9   " is projected onto the screen
As random  from the film play out, we drift over the happy faces of our friends watching
Paul and Conrad stare, enthralled
Tor laughs as he sees himself
Vampira giggles
Bunny nudges her playfully
Criswell mouths his own lines
Bela appears, in his little suit
In the last footage he ever shot, he shuffles around in front of his house, then tenderly smells the flower
He watches, entranced
Then he smiles to himself
This is the one
know 'll be remembered for this film
: - The  crowd is in high spirits
People congratulate Ed and pat him on the back
"It was great
"  "It's your best one yet
"  "Bela would've loved it
" Ed drifts through the crowd, basking in the glory
It's like a wonderful dream
- The rain comes down in sheets
The doors burst open, and Ed and Kathy run out
Ed, 'm so happy for you
Let's get married
(startled) Huh
Right now Let's drive to Vegas
But it's pouring
And the car top is stuck
(he gives his killer grin) So
It's only a five-hour drive
And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert
Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner
promise
Kathy stares in disbelief
Then she smiles
They kiss
Ed and Kathy jump into the open convertible
The engine starts, and they drive away, disappearing into the pouring rain
moment
And then, we move up, up, into the black clouds
Lightning across the sky
: We slowly   from the sky, move through a window
and we're back inside - Criswell is sitting inside his coffin
He stares at us
My friend, you have just seen the story of Edward
Wood, Junior
Stranger than fact
and yet every incident based on sworn testimony
(his eyes gleam) man
life
Can you prove it didn't happen
beat, to ponder this
And then Criswell slowly lies back in his coffin, and the lid mysteriously closes over him
