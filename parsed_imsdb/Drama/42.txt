Gentlemen,  have a plan

Sukeforth and Parrott exchange a look
plan's always good, Mr
Rickey
And you always got one
My wife says 'm too old, That my health isn't up to it
My son says that every one in baseball will be against me
But 'm going to do it
Parrott looks to Sukeforth who keeps his eyes on Rickey
Do what, Mr
Rickey
'm going to bring a Negro ballplayer to the Brooklyn Dodgers
With all due respect, sir, have you lost your mind
Imagine the abuse you'll take from the newspapers alone
Never mind how it'll play on Flatbush
Please, Mr

The Catcher looks over at Scott who chuckles

The Catcher gets back down in his squat

Jack does a slow burn, then suddenly strides toward the attendant

Take that hose out of the tank

Between the army and now baseball 've been away a lot

Considering all that,  say  think so
Do you love her
Rachel
( ) Don't you know
Yes, sir, very much
Marry her

Rickey stands, walks to a window
Jack looks at Sukeforth who raises a hand as if to say: Give it a chance
(') Baseball's a hard life; a man needs a good woman by his side
You don't want the only person waiting for you at home to be a catcher
Sukeforth chuckles at that
Rickey fingers open a slat on the blind and peers out
Jack looks hard at him
Coach Sukeforth here said you were starting a new Negro League
That doesn't make sense to me
It doesn't, huh
Are you calling us liars, Jack
What's this about, Mr
Rickey
This is about baseball
Rickey opens the shade
Sunlight floods in
Rickey follows it to the chalkboard, to the list of players under Montreal
(') see you starting in the spring with our affiliate in Montreal
If you make it there, we'll try you down here with the Dodgers
The white Brooklyn Dodgers
Jack looks to Sukeforth who nods: Yes, you heard right
4-07-12 9
(') 'll pay you $600 a month and a $3,500 bonus when you sign the contract
Is that agreeable
Believe it or not that's a lot of money to Jack on this day in time
This is all becoming a bit overwhelming
Yes, sir
That's fine
There is one condition
have a pile of scouting reports
know you can hit behind the runner, that you can read a pitch
The question is can you control your temper
My temper
Yes your temper
Are you deaf
Rickey furious, the avuncular old man gone
Jack sits there, fists now balled
Rickey to Sukeforth like he's not there: (') He looks proud
Willful
He'll need to be
Rickey looks back to Jack who is as angry as he is confused
want to win
want ballplayers who can win
Are you one of them
Yes
black man in white baseball
Imagine the reaction
The vitriol
Rickey strides forward, gets in his face
(') The Dodgers check into a hotel decent good hotel
You're worn out from the road and some clerk won't give you the pen to sign in
( ) We got no room, boy, not even down in the coal bin where you belong

Jack looks like he wants to tear Rickey apart
(') The team stops at a restaurant
The waiter won't take your order
(adopts a new voice) Didn't you see the sign on the door
No animals allowed
() What are you going to do then
Fight him
Ruin all my plans
Answer me, you black sonofabitch
( ) Do you want a ballplayer who doesn't have the guts to fight back
Is that what you want
want one who has the guts not to fight back
There are people who will not like this
They will do anything to get you to react
If you echo a curse with a curse, they will only hear yours
Follow a blow with a blow and they will say a Negro lost his temper; that the Negro does not belong
Your enemy will be out in force, but you can not meet him on his own low ground
We win with hitting, running and fielding, nothing else
We win if the world is convinced of two things: that you are a fine gentlemen and a great ballplayer
Like our Savior, you must have the guts to turn the other cheek
Jack considers Rickey
Rickey looks worn out
(') Can you do it
Jack poised at what will be his Rubicon

Who's the best shortstop you ever saw
Rabbit Tavener
Rabbit Tavener
And you call yourself a sports writer
3-14-12 13
Yes, a sentimental one
'm from Detroit
He was the Tiger shortstop when  was a boy
How about you
Who's your best
Pop Lloyd
Not Honus Wagner
Wagner is number two
And Rabbit Tavener would not break my top 25
Where do you suppose Jackie Robinson will end up on that list
He won't break it
He doesn't have a shortstop's arm
Robinson belongs on second base
Alright then, where would he rate at second
If he was playing now he'd be the best second baseman in the majors
High praise
He'll have to be the best in the minor leagues first
What are you saying, Mr
Rickey
'm saying it's going to be a very interesting spring training
lot of players are coming back from the war and with gas rationing over, we can train down in Florida again
Daytona Beach
( ) You're aware in the past six months a black boy was lynched in Madison, Florida and a black man down in Live Oaks
Those towns may as well be a million miles from Daytona

Live Oaks is 150 actually
spoke to the Daytona mayor
He assures me there'll be no trouble
But Rickey doesn't sound so sure
They consider each other
(') Mr
Smith, are you a Communist
'm a Democrat
Why do you ask
have a business proposition
What's your salary at the Courier
Fifty dollars a week
will pay you an additional fifty dollars a week plus expenses if you will attend spring training with Jackie Robinson
You will watch over him, help him to avoid the harm that could come if he were to do or say anything out of turn
You will act as his chauffeur, you will secure accommodations for him wherever the team may be, help him find restaurants, etc
What's in it for me
Besides the fifty dollars and a whole lot of aggravation
Unprecedented access for any reportage you feel appropriate
What do you say, Mr
Smith
say yes, sir
If a Negro is good enough to stop a Nazi bullet in France; he's good enough to stop a line drive at Yankee Stadium
Ebbets Field actually, but yes, agree

It's the cue for most of the batting and fielding and chatter among the Dodgers, Royals and Saints to come to a stop
Higbe forgets Bragan is throwing him a ball
It clocks him in the chest
Reese and Stanky passing a medicine ball
That's him, huh
Take a wild guess
Flash bulbs go off in Jack's face
Questions like punches
Shouts of a Jackie' and then
Jackie, do you think you can make it with these white boys
Jack looks off to where Smith watches, back to the reporter
See the questions slow
He answers with measure
Sure,  had no problem with white men in the service or at
What'll you do if one of these pitchers throws at your head
(thinks a beat) 'll duck
That gets some laughs
Jack, what's your natural position
've been playing shortstop
Are you after Pee Wee Reese's job
5-9-12 27A
Jack looks over to where Reese watches with Stanky
Reese plays for Brooklyn
'm worried about making Montreal
Is this about politics
It's about getting paid
Jack doing beautifully
Smith breathes a sigh of relief
4-24-12 28
In a Montreal uniform, Hopper's too old to be a ballplayer
He stands with Dixie Walker the Dodger right fielder
( ) Well, when Mr
Rickey picks one, he sure picks a black one
He's fine with me, so long as you keep him up in Montreal
Here comes the old man to save him
They watch as Rickey pulls Jack from the press
He leads Jack directly toward Hopper
As Walker excuses himself
Good luck, Hop
Clay, 'd like you to meet Jackie Robinson
Jackie, Clay Hopper, manager of the Montreal Royals
Hopper shakes his hand as they exchange greetings
We ain't doing much today
Just throwing the ball around and hitting a few
Why don't you toss a few with those fellas over there
( ) Hey, Jorgensen
kid in a Montreal uniform looks over
Meet Jackie Robinson
: 37
-    -  37 The end of the day
Buses leave by team, the Dodgers and the farm clubs
White faces look down as they pass a tired Jack, who walks through the lot toward Wendell Smith and his Buick
Higbe and Bragan call out from the door of the Dodger bus
Hey, Rook
Did you hear about the redneck shortstop
5-9-12 29
He thought the last two words of the National Anthem were Play Ball
Jack forces a smile, but the joke comes off a bit harsh
And they seem like they're laughing at him as
How about the shortstop making all the errors, tried to kill himself by jumping out on the highway
bus just missed him
Drove right between his legs
As the bus passes by, Jack sees the impassive faces of Dixie Walker, Reiser, Stanky, Pee Wee Reese and finally 20-year-old Branca
Branca smiles, offers an awkward little wave
Between his legs, good one
He must've read a joke book
If he can read
Jack just gets in the car
Smith sighs, drum rolls the hood of the Buick
Hi, Wendell, how are you
Well, looks like  got a long drive to Sanford
: 38
-    -  -   38 comes out the screen door carrying a tray of tall drinks
He sets them on a table, watches and waits as Smith and Jack get out of the Buick, start up the steps
Jackie, 'm Ray Brock
Welcome to Sanford Florida
The day belongs to decent minded people
They shake hands
Brock looks to Smith, obviously knows him
Wendell, good to see you
( ) My wife's inside cooking
You know what she asked me this morning
She asked me, what do you serve when a hero's coming for dinner
3-14-12 30
Jack's humble, embarrassed, doesn't know what to say
'm just a ballplayer, Mr
Brock
Tell that to all the little colored boys playing baseball in Florida today
You're a hero to them
The look on Jack's face says that's a heavy burden
(') Sit down, have something to drink
My special rum and coke
No thank you, sir,  don't drink
ballplayer who doesn't drink
That's a new one on me
'll have one
'm a stereotypical reporter through and through
Mr
Brock, do you have a desk
'd like to get a letter to my wife
Of course, this way
As Mr
Brock leads Jack ahead, Smith sips his drink

Jack's playing second
They watch him closely as they talk
He's getting by on a quick release, but his arm's too weak for short
Second base is his spot
agree
And 'll state another obvious, Clay,  need the players to act like gentlemen around him
Uh huh
4-24-12 31
The  on first takes a lead
To treat him as they would any other teammate
Uh huh
To be natural, to impose no restrictions on themselves
To all work together in harmony
The hit & run is on
The man on first runs on the pitch as a    shoots for the gap between 1st and 2nd
Robinson turns himself inside out to dive on his belly and catch it before it hits the ground
He spins himself around, pivots on a knee to throw the runner out before he can get back to first
Rickey is astounded
That was superhuman
() Superhuman
Don't get carried away, Mr
Rickey, that's still a Nigger out there
Rickey takes a moment to process
It's Hopper's light admonishing tone that really halts him
Finally
Clay,  realize that attitude is part of your heritage; that you practically nursed race prejudice at your mother's breast, so  will let it pass
But  will add this: you can manage Robinson fairly and correctly or you can be unemployed
They both look over as Jack comes off the field toward them
Attaboy, Jackie

Okay as far as  can see

Who is it you're looking for

The air suddenly alive with danger
He's asleep
Maybe you better come back in the morning
ain't comin' back
Other fellas is comin'
They ain't too happy about him stayin' here in Sanford
Playin' ball with white boys
(a long beat) Skedaddle, that's what 'd do
If'n they get here, and he's still here, there's gonna be trouble

Smith leaves the room
Hold on Jack, despair as he listens

To Smith it looks like something else

The white men look over at the two black men
One steps over, motions: roll down the window
wonder what he wants
To run us out of town
What are you talking about
The man close now
As Jack cranks down the window, Smith floors it
The Buick  away,  around a coming the other way
What the hell, Wendell
Man came by while you were asleep
( ) Told us more men were coming
Maybe those boys
Mr
Rickey said to get you to Daytona Beach a-s-a-p
Why didn't you say so
Mr
Rickey was afraid you wouldn't leave, that you would fight
As it becomes clear, Jack starts to
What the hell are you laughing at

Rickey pops a  in his mouth, confides to someone alongside him we don't see
've spoken to the mayor
've explained how much money we'll spend in Daytona
But still, when this fine young Negro man steps on that field today, he and the Dodgers will technically be breaking the law
law which says white and black players cannot enjoy the same field at the same time

Good evening
have something very important to talk with you about tonight

The start of applause
Rickey motions for it to stop
4-24-12 48
He may stay there or he may be brought to Brooklyn
But if Jackie does come up to the Dodgers, the biggest threat to his success, the one enemy most likely to ruin that success, is the Negro people themselves
There is shocked silence in the room
Rickey notices a group of  watching from a raised running track, soldiers on: say it as cruelly as  can to make you all realize the weight of responsibility that is not only on myself and the Dodgers, but on Negroes everywhere
For on the day Jackie enters the National League, if he does,  have no doubt every one of you will form parades and welcoming committees
You'll strut
You'll wear badges
You'll hold Jackie Robinson days and Jackie Robinson nights
You'll get drunk, fight and be arrested
This is too much
People are slackjawed
Rickey powers on
You'll wine and dine him until he is fat and futile
You'll symbolize his importance into a national comedy and yes, a tragedy
So let me tell you this
(pounds his fist) If any group or segment of Negro society uses the advancement of Jackie Robinson in baseball as a triumph of race over race,  will regret the day  ever signed him to a contract, and  will personally see that baseball is never so abused and misrepresented again
Is he done

mean it ain't gonna happen
The Dodgers are never gonna demand Robinson be brought up from Montreal
Ball players are conservative
team full of tough war veterans
Immigrants' sons
Boys from impoverished parts of the country
It - ain't - gonna - happen
You really believe they won't accept him
Once they see how he plays, how he can help them win
'm not saying they won't accept him: 'm saying they won't ask for him
'm saying Robinson's good medicine, but they're not gonna like the taste
'm saying bend over, boys, and get ready, this one might hurt a little
( ) Boy, this is good fish

Why do you think Rickey's got us playing spring games in Panama
() 4-07-12 53
(') He wants to get us used to Negro crowds
He wants more of them than us
He's hoping it'll get us more comfortable being around Robinson
Higbe clears his throat, reads what he's written: We, the undersigned Brooklyn Dodgers will not play ball on the same field as Jackie Robinson
Higbe signs it
He hands the pen to Bragan who adds his own name
Casey signs with a flourish
Casey holds out the pen to Walker who doesn't take it right away
An odd beat
If you wanna make your mark, Dixie, we can witness it
Everyone laughs; it loosens Walker up enough to sign

Eddie Stanky sits in a chair stripped to the waist, soaking his right elbow in a
What's goin' on
Got a petition goin' on, Stank
To keep Robinson up in Montreal where he belongs
Oh
Did Pee Wee sign it
Ain't asked him yet
What difference does it make
None, just wonderin'
4-07-12 54
Stanky looks to Walker who looks away
(') (re: his right arm) Can't sign now
'm indisposed
Could  catch up with you later
: 77    77 Standing in the door to his room
Looking out at the glum faces of Higbe, Bragan, Casey and Walker
Look, it's like this
got a wife, a baby, and  got no money
don't want to step in anything
( ) Skip me, Dix, 'm not interested
What if they put him at shortstop
() If he's man enough to take my job, suppose he deserves it
(laughs out loud) The hell he does
He does not have the ice water in his veins for big league baseball
So let him show what he's got
Robinson can play or he can't
It'll all take care of itself

From Pennsylvania no less
Give me the pen

Finally, the phone rings
He answers
Yes, Mr
Rickey
' Have our friends in the press gone to sleep yet

Rickey

Good night, Leo

Rickey

Durocher stands in a hotel bathrobe, arms crossed as his  and  file in
Bleary-eyed, half- dressed, they're all here, all wondering what this is about
Suddenly, Durocher grabs the handle of an industrial-sized and heaves it across the room
--
Wake up, ladies
Wake the Hell up
(a stunned beat) It's come to my attention that some of you fellas don't want to play with Robinson
That you even got a petition drawn up that you're all gonna sign
Well boys, you know what you can do with your petition
'mon, Leo
Come on what
6-25-12 55A
Ball players gotta live together, shower together, it's not right to force him on us
Besides,  own a hardware store back home and  -- 4-19-12 56
Screw your hardware store, Dix
And if you don't like it, screw you
Mr
Rickey'll be happy to make other arrangements for you
Durocher suddenly marches to Higbe, looks like he's going to belt him
As Higbe gulps, Durocher turns to the team
don't care if he's yellow or black or has stripes like a zebra, if Robinson can help us win, and everything 've seen says he can, then he's gonna play on this ball club
Like it, lump it, make your mind up to it because he's coming
And think about this when your heads hit the pillow, he's only the first, boys, only the first
More are coming right behind him
They have talent and they wanna play
He lets that sink a moment
Yes, sir, they're gonna come diving and scratching
So 'd forget your petition and worry about the field
Because unless you fellas pay a little more attention to your work, they are going to run you right out of the ball park

What do you want me to do with this
Play first base
've never played first base in my life, Coach
Well, it's like this
Brooklyn's got a solid second baseman

The short hops are wicked
Jack rolls his catches over to a little   who chucks them down to his brother who tosses them back to Sukeforth
As Jack struggles
El es muy malo
Mr
Rickey said he wants you playing conspicuous baseball
() To be so good the Dodgers'll demand you on the team
() So  thought about it awhile and then  looked up conspicuous in the dictionary
() It means to attract notice or attention
Jack dives, spears a liner
Sukeforth tilts back his cap

Bragan, most of your teammates have recanted on this petition nonsense
Are you really here to tell me you don't want to play with Robinson
Yes, Sir
My friends back in Birmingham would never forgive me
And your friends here in Brooklyn
(Bragan just shrugs) Then  will accommodate you
If you give me your word that you will try your very best for this team until  can work out a trade
That gets Bragan's goat
He jumps up, really mad
Do you think  would quit on anyone
don't quit
Only on yourself apparently
You can go, Bragan

He pivots to turn the double-play even as Dixie Walker barrels in low
All Jackie's focus on the task at hand as he throws while Walker submarines him
He lands in a heap tangled up together
They both look back to see the result of the play
As Robinson smiles and Walker scowls, we know
' Send Dixie in

received your letter, Dixie
() Recently, the thought has occurred to me that a change of ball clubs would benefit both the Brooklyn Baseball Club and myself
( ) This is about Robinson
'm keeping my reasons private
Hope you can respect that, sir
realize, Dixie, that you have a Southern upbringing, that you would have to subordinate your feelings for the welfare of this venture for one would deeply appreciate it
think we can all learn something
What  have, Mr
Rickey, is a hardware store back home
It's called Dixie Walker's
Folks don't come because  have the lowest prices, they come because it's called Dixie Walker's
Understand
And  make as much money owning that store as  do playing for you
Is that what you're you afraid of
(he doesn't answer) Bragan's a third-stringer, but you bat clean-up
You're popular in Brooklyn
Children look up to you
You got my letter; can  go

Looking for a cab, he sees Smith waiting
Smith offers a salute

Do  have to entertain you
More silence, then
You ever wonder why  sit out in right field with my typewriter on my knees
Does that ever cross your mind
Jack stares out the passenger window, not in the mood
As he looks up at some of the taller buildings they pass
It's because Negro reporters aren't allowed in the press box
Jack doesn't answer, doesn't look over
Finally Smith starts talking to himself
Pretending to be Jack

Cooked for him for years, but never once broke bread with him

Play baseball out on the lawn with Mr
Ford's grandchildren
We all had a real good time
But it was understood, if they got tired of playing ball and moved inside to the bowling alley or swimming pool, was not invited or allowed
The grass was as far as  got
So guess what
You're not the only one with something at stake here
(after a beat) If  start talking, will you stop
'd be happy to
Smith stops at a red light

You've been there for me through this more than anyone besides Rae and Mr
Rickey

How do you mean
don't like needing someone to be there for me
don't like needing anyone but myself

You are a hard case, Jack Robinson
Is it okay if  keep driving you or should  let you out so you can walk
Jack bursts out laughing
So does Smith
You remember the last time we were at a red light
Down in Florida
New York City now, baby
We've come a long way
And we got a long way to go
The light turns green
Off they go

'  -  -  93 Rickey reads to Parrott from the New York Sun
Branch Rickey cannot afford to upset team chemistry and so the only thing keeping Robinson off the Dodgers now, plainly, is the attitude of the players
: Brooklyn
April 9, 1947
If it softens at the sight of Jackie's skills, he'll join the club some time between April 10 and April 15
Otherwise, Robinson will spend the year back in Montreal
(throws paper down) For the love of Pete, he batted 625 in the exhibition games against them, us, them -- Against us

Rickey flummoxed as the phone  from the outer office
Maybe you could have Durocher hold a press conference
Demand that he get Robinson on his team

Durocher
Of course, he's my ace in the hole

Rickey switches the phone from one ear to the other

Yes
He was seen in Havana with known gamblers
Anyone who sets foot in Havana is seen with known gamblers
It's not just one thing, it's an accumulation
received notice today from the Catholic Youth Organization
Vowing a ban on baseball unless Durocher is punished for his moral looseness
You're joking
It's this business with the actress in California
She's recently divorced and Durocher is the cause
They may even be illegally married

Now 'm sure you're joking
Happy checks his nails, returns his hand to the

You're chopping off my right hand

Chapman a hothead during his playing days with the Yankees

He leans forward, unsure
What's he saying
126   126 Chapman joined by two of his
Go home, Nigger
Go back to Africa
Phillie pitcher   looks in
Jack has to try to concentrate on the pitch
Here it comes
fastball well inside
Jack hits the deck to keep from getting beaned
Bojangles
You sure can dance, snowflake
On first, mouth hanging open
Almost forgets to take a lead
It's an instant Rorschach test
Shotton and the players look stricken
Even Walker doesn't quite know what to make of it
No one enjoys it, but Higbe
walk closer to listen
The fans range from horrified to some mildly pleased
Rachel looks stricken

fastball inside
He leaps back again
This one was even closer to hitting him
As Jack glares at Dutch
Ball two
' Hey, black boy
Hey, shoe shine

Jack doesn't want to look over, but he is compelled
The bench players flanking Chapman look furious, but Chapman is doing this with a sick sort of glee
You like white girls
Huh
Which one of them Dodger boys' wives are you climbing on tonight
Chapman looks toward
They don't like that one
(') Oh,  think  got it
Dixie, believe  know
Grips the bat
Watches for the next pitch with bloody mindedness
He hacks at it, lofts a routine fly into left
He's about halfway down to first when the left fielder catches it and Jack can mercifully return to the dugout
127  127 Rickey watches as he disappears inside
Finally exhales
128  128 Jack sits down
No one says anything to him
No one comes near him as he stares ahead, trapped in a kind of void
The closest player to him is Bobby Bragan
Bragan finally manages to glance over at him, then looks quickly away
: 129  129 As the Dodgers take the field, Jack heads to first
Almost wincing, wondering if it's going to start again
(under her breath) Look at me, baby
Look at me
Finally, Jack glances up to her
She offers her eyes: 'm with you
He looks away
Her witnessing makes it worse

Hey, Nigger lips
Party's over, jungle bunny
Hey, Pee Wee
Dixie
What's this Nigger doing for you all to let him drink from the same water fountain as you
hope it's worth it
Waiting for the pitch
Takes a mighty swing --  a towering - between home plate and the mound
Dutch watches his catcher Seminick settle under it
Waiting
Hey, is that a home run
Yeah
If you're playing in an elevator shaft
Jack veers off the first baseline
Heads for the dugout
You don't belong
Look in a mirror
This is a white man's game
Get it through your thick monkey skull
Jack stops short looks at him
Chapman stands his ground
Stands, watches
Praying this doesn't go south
As Jack finally continues on, Rickey closes his eyes in relief
Sick for her husband

Jack stalks down past the team
No one looks at him
Bragan is ashamed
Dixie tries to look disinterested
Stanky and Reese exchange a helpless glance as Jack continues into: 132   132 Like a bull on his way to slaughter, he revolts
-
He proceeds to turn his bat into
Concrete chips, wood flies
Jack drops the handle of the bat, pounds his fists
Heaving for breath, framed by the empty tunnel
Raw, electric, ungovernable
All the anger on display, the fury
Jack looks up to see Rickey standing there, watching, afraid to get too much closer
To hell with this
The next white son of a bitch who opens his mouth, 'll smash his goddamn teeth in
Rickey stands there until finally, opening his mouth
You can't, Jackie
You know it
'm supposed to let this go on
These men have to live with -- have to live with myself, too
And right now 'm living a sermon out there
'm through with it
Jack is at the end of his rope
All Rickey has are words
You don't matter right now, Jack
You're in this thing
You don't have the right to pull out from the backing of people who believe in you, respect you and who need you
Is that so
If you fight, they won't say Chapman forced you to; they'll just say that you're over your head
That you belong where you are
() 3-14-12 80
(') That every downtrodden man who wants more from life is over his head
Jack's either going to explode or break into tears
Do you know what it's like, having someone do this to you
No
You do
You're the one living the sermon
In the wilderness
Forty days
All of it
Only you
And not a damn thing  can do about it
Of course there is
You can stand up and hit
You can get on base and you can score
You can win this game for us
We need you as well
Everyone needs you
(a beat; exhausted) You're medicine, Jack
Rickey reaches out, touches the wall to stay standing
Jack just breathes as familiar sounds reverb down the tunnel
They're taking the field
Who's playing first
Jack considers him
Everything hangs in the balance
Then: 'm gonna need a new bat
As Jack heads back down the tunnel for the field

Hey, black Nigger
know you can hear me
If you were a white boy, you know where you'd be right now
On a bus headed down to Newport News cuz you can't play for shit
Here comes the pitch
Jack nonchalantly sticks his bat out, pokes a soft hit past second
nothing hit, but he's standing on first
And he looks, well, ferocious in fact
As Pete Reiser steps up into the batter's box
Jack stares at Dutch Leonard
Assassin's eyes as he takes an insolent, in-your-face lead off first
Dutch fires to first
Jack dives back safe
Back on his feet, he spits out a piece of grit he picked up sliding back on his belly
Not bothering to dust himself off, he's turning into something elemental before our eyes
135   135 Up in the booth
Two strikes now to Reiser as Leonard looks in
Robinson with another big lead off first
He's as restless as a cat with a hot foot

Steal it, sweetheart
Take it

Jack on the run as Reiser swings and misses - - and Seminick comes up throwing
Jack slides into second, the throw high, ends up in center
Half a dozen Dodgers impulsively on their feet and waving him on as Jack gets to his feet and motors into
The throw well late
Phillies third baseman  throws the ball back to Dutch
Handley then looks to Jack
'm sorry
want you to know what goes on here, it don't go for me
Jack barely nods, but he heard

Dutch looking to third, nodding distracted at a sign, looking back to third before
Hermanski cracks a single to left

You fellas are making too big a deal out of this

One to nothing
Do you think you were a little hard on Robinson
We treat him the same way we do Hank Greenburg except we call Hank a kike instead of a coon
When we play exhibitions against the Yankees, we call DiMaggio the Wop
They laugh at it
No harm, it's forgotten after the game ends
Chapman tosses away his beer can
Don't you think this was maybe one foot over the line
Hey
Let's get the chips off our shoulders and play ball

Parrott is hurt
Did  say something funny
When  first told you about Jackie, you were against it
Now all of a sudden you're worrying about him
How do you suppose that happened
Well, any decent minded person -- Sympathy, Harold, is a Greek word
It means to suffer
sympathize with you means  suffer with you
This Philadelphia manager has done me a service
service
Is there an echo in here
Yes, he's creating sympathy on Jackie's behalf
Philadelphia by the way is Greek for brotherly love
The intercom
' Bob Bragan to see you, Mr
Rickey

Rickey pretends to review papers as Bragan enters, his hat literally in his hand
Rickey lets him stand there a moment
What do you want, Bragan

'd like not to be traded, sir, if it isn't too late

They watch Jack crack one high off the Schaefer Beer sign
used to think Jack was conceited
5-9-12 93
Is that so
It was the very first thing noticed about him
How did you two meet
saw him at a  football game
Even in uniform with a helmet on, his vanity was awful
It was the way he held his hands on his hips
hated him
( ) And on campus he always wore crisp white shirts and 'd think his skin is so dark, why would he do that
Then  got to know him, his pride and confidence, and  realized he was showing off his color
was wrong
He wasn't conceited; he was proud
Always, of who and what he is
'd never met another man like that
What about you
How did you meet your wife
Trying to catch her in a race
She was the fastest girl in town
Beautiful legs
finally caught up; we've been together ever since
They sit a moment
Below: Jack nails another one
wanted to apologize to you
For what
Everything
can't apologize to him
He and  both knew what we were getting into
But you newlywed, trying to blossom a marriage under all this pressure
Don't worry about me
Or us
We know who we are
Crack
Jack hits another

Your husband has humbled me
When this all began  thought  was changing the world and that Jackie was my instrument
Can you imagine
wish  could help him, but 'm just a spectator
You help him plenty
Believe me
They watch him rip into another pitch
Is he able to get things off his chest
So he doesn't burn up
Yes
have to let him have that silence at first, let him come to me
But he opens up eventually
Good
It's too much to carry inside
Does he have any friends on the team
(she gives him a look) They're spectators, too
They do admire him though
Rachel looks out to where Reese and Stanky play catch
Do you think so
Even the worst of us recognizes courage
Moral courage especially
have to think they see it
Jackie's a man on trial
He's responding with glory and grace
No one can take their eyes off him
He's had himself on trial since the day  met him
No man is harder on himself or gets to himself worse than Jack
But  hope his team- mates know, they're on trial too
suppose we all are
You're an astute woman, Mrs
Robinson

What can  do for you, Pee Wee
Well, Mr
Rickey, it's like this, the series in Cincinnati next week
It's an important road trip, we're only three games out of first
Yes, sir
You know, 'm from Kentucky
Cincinnati's nearly a home game for you
got this letter, sir
guess some people aren't too happy about me playing with Robinson
Rickey is not liking where this is going; he motions for the letter, scans it, reads the highlights

Watch yourself
We will get you, carpetbagger
(holds it out) Typical stuff
Reese takes the letter back, a little hurt
It's not typical to me
How many of these letters have you gotten, Pee Wee

Ain't that enough
Rickey looks Reese over a moment
Pushing back his chair he steps over to a filing cabinet

He looks to Reese

'll tell you what they aren't, they aren't letters from the Jackie Robinson fan club
Here -- He thrusts a sheaf of it into Reese's hands
As Reese flips through the stack of hate, reads: Get out of baseball, or your baby boy will die
( ) Quit baseball or your Nigger wife will be
Reese trails off, won't say it out loud
Skips to another
(') Get out of the game or be killed
He looks at one more, reacts to the vitriol, but does not utter it
Reese looks back at Rickey, shocked
(') Does Jackie know
Of course he knows
And the
They're taking a threat in Cincinnati pretty seriously
So excuse me if 'm not too shocked at you being called a carpetbagger
You should be proud of it
We'd just like to play ball, Mr
Rickey
That's all we want to do
understand
bet Jackie just wants to play ball
bet he wishes he wasn't leading the league in hit by pitch
