Ron Bass Third Draft Rewrite February 23, 1999 Previous Drafts By: Laura Jones Beth Henley , ,   - Glaring fluorescence, trash overflowing with cheap detergent boxes, empty Coke machine flashing all lights orange
Only two dryers are humming
It's very late
Keep  to
a wiry, gimlet-eyed , furtively removing crumpled newspapers from a dryer
She flattens and folds them meticulously, her glance darting angrily everywhere
Top secret mission
a natty little black man
has spread a late supper on a neat cloth atop a dryer
Small cold fowl
Brie, baguette, olives
Bottle of red
An air of competence, of indomitable upbeatness
He ignores the spy-dressed-as-bag-lady as if she were normal
More curious about
a hulking, rumpled figure scrutinizing Help Wanted ads as if cramming for life's midterm exam
Thoughtful
Circles one, slowly
Set out on 's dryer are one Snickers bar and four empty snickers wrappers
His version of cold supper
He reaches for the candy, but seeing it's the last one, he
rises
Goes to the candy machine
Drops in his 65 cents, hits the button
The Snickers starts to fall, but gets caught in the mechanism at the last moment
Quoyle blinks dully
One more retelling of the story of his life
He  the machine half- heartedly
Nope
Shakes it with his shambling strength
Nada
the coin return button
Hat trick
He empties his pocket
Studies the results
Not enough
And without so much as a sigh
he ambles back to his dryer
Starts to unwrap the last Snickers
Partridge taking this all in
But Mata Hari of the Neat Newspapers goes to the candy machine,  it violently
Out fall the Snickers and the 65 cents
She scoops up both, turns in a single motion to
death at the enemy
Quoyle opens his mouth to comment
But
Doesn't
Resumes unwrapping his supper, as
his dryer
He pops it open
Stares in
Blinks
Suddenly  a tangle of graying shirts out onto the grimy floor to reveal they have been
streaky  by a cheap pen, quietly melting amid the pile
This slips beneath even Quoyle's expectation level
The big, soft face is pitifully, yes, even adorably, devastated
(a murmur) Ruined
And to the bystander
This seems a comment on more than shirts
(softly) Nah
Rub the ink with hot salt and talcum powder
Quoyle's head  around
As if he thought he was alone
(
) If you're shocked when someone aims kindness your way
That oughta tell you somethin' about yourself
Watches the little guy's undemanding smile
(
, just staring) Then again
If you're that kinda guy
It don't
And put a cuppa bleach in, next time through
As Quoyle gazes at his benefactor, the woman sneaks up, his Help Wanted ads
Races them over to her dryer
As the boys watch, she shoves them in, starts the machine with Quoyle's coins, and glares fiercely back at us
mother bear protecting her cubs
Partridge chuckles
Holds out his hand
Partridge
Quoyle glances at the little man's cold fowl supper
Uh
No thanks
It's my name
Oh
- Shabby one-floor newspaper
Old equipment, listless personnel, stale you can smell from here
Only guy working is Partridge, who is laying out the front page, and glances up to see across the floor
Quoyle enter in his best suit
It is also his worst suit
Partridge points to the only enclosed office, and gives his buddy a hearty thumbs-up
Quoyle nods, his smile a rictus, his eyes a glaze of panic
We see now that he is chewing, somehow
On the way into the office, he snags a doughnut from a paper plate by the coffee
Enters
'  - , managing editor, looks up from a reverie with a startled expression
He wears really thick glasses which his eyes, giving him a frightening aspect
Quoyle
You're early
From the rear, we see Quoyle can barely squeeze himself into the chair
don't like that
All the change  out of Quoyle's pockets, and  onto the wood floor,  interminably, as Quoyle fidgets
Partridge says you're not as dumb as you look
now to see Quoyle's face
The neat moustache of powdered sugar
(
) How could  be
And takes a healthy bite from what's left of the doughnut
Anyway, that's why 'm takin' a chance on you
Partridge said he'd re-write whatever of your stuff
Stay late
Quoyle nods, dumbly
Knows this
We're a family paper
Upbeat stories with a community slant
Self-help stuff: Are You a Break- fast Alcoholic
Guide to Getting Dumped
like that
Quoyle nods bigger
Like he gets it
Punch shoves an antique tape recorder across the table
City Planning Board meeting at two- thirty
Three hunnerd words max
Sink or swim
on Quoyle's eyes
Recalling
:
- Quoyle as a fat kid in a baggy bathing suit, being savagely pummeled by his vicious
(
) think my brother said that once
Being pulled off the sniveling Quoyle by a rough hairy man with dead eyes
(
) Maybe it was my father
Quoyle's  hauls him off the deck, and in a single motion, him  the pool
Sink or swim, pig-butt
Watches the  with mild contempt
Turns away before Quoyle simply  beneath the surface
(
) 'm not a water person
- The empty room a haven of dust motes floating in sickly fluor- escence
Quoyle sits across the desk, gazing with endearing fearfulness as Partridge turns page after page
See, three hunnerd words would be, like, one page
This is
oh, fifteen, sixteen
So we should cut it
Partridge does glance up on that
Gonna have to
Or you could tie me in a sack, throw me in the river
Tell the police you thought it was oddly-wrapped lard
Might be quicker
Nobody smiles
Nobody has to
Quoyle pulls a big glass jar from a paper sack
Sets it on the desk
Does your wife like special pickles
They're fine with cold cuts
Partridge looks at the cornichons
They look expensive
Come by for supper, tomorrow
We'll find out
to
'   - Sausages on the , interesting colors and sizes
huge hand delicately places cut-up pieces of quail on the grill
It is Quoyle, trusted, paying attention
, a slim black woman with fiery eyes and an enticing smile, hands him a glass of white wine, and
goes to slip her arm around Partridge
He watches Quoyle's concentration approvingly
Shares a smile with his sexy wife
And raps a knife on his glass
Announcement
Quoyle looks up with innocent eyes
Which makes Partridge hesitate
We
Got you this
Mercalia takes out the package
Wrapped in tissue, a neat ribbon
She hands it to Quoyle, and leans up to kiss his cheek
Quoyle looks down at it, dumbfounded
silence
It's
an anniversary present
Anniversary of our friendship
Quoyle smiles
Sweet and slightly confused
Seven and a half month anniversary
He starts to unwrap
Well
Why wait
a wristwatch
nice one
He is overwhelmed, but still uncomprehending
It's because we're happy
About something
And steals a glance at her husband
( grin) You're havin' a baby
That stops Partridge's face
No more stalling
Mercalia and me are movin'
To California
Friday night
Quoyle so pole-axed he can't even lose the smile
It just turns stupid and transparent
His friend swallows
You know she's been learnin' to drive a rig
She got the Oakland to New Orleans run
'm gonna make her smoked duck sandwiches for the road
can edit copy anywhere
Quoyle nodding slowly, smile still there
Yep
guess y'can
Partridge sees that it's a death blow
Mercalia looks at her feet
Love's all that counts
It's the engine of life
As if parting advice
As if Quoyle should file that away
So Quoyle nods some more
As if he will
We'll just
Stay in touch
On this, Quoyle's smile deserts him
So Partridge reaches out his hand
Quoyle paralyzed, then takes it
their handclasp, and  to
- a slender feminine hand
Buried in Quoyle's
(
) Petal Bear, Mr
Quoyle
up to see her
Tiny, twitchy, moist ringlets
gray-eyed predator
She looks around at the milling suits and their name tags
As if they were alternatives
Do you hate this shit, or what
Quoyle transfixed by her slight form in its loose but clingy wrapping
The smile that sees him again and flickers
What do you think
You want to marry me, don't you
Don't you
No answer
She laughs, as if at some off-color response
Runs hot fingers up his arm, leaning to his face
Buy me a drink somewhere, it's seven-thirty
think 'm going to fuck you by ten
What do you think of that
Quoyle
Blinks
She laughs again
Bright, like whiskey music
You are quite
The raconteur
'  - Petal naked in near-darkness, moves with authority toward the massive lumpy creature nearly overflowing his bed
Draws the covers back
Stares
Christ
won the lottery
Climbs on, the lithe move of a leopardess
Feeding time
(
) It was pretty much like that for a month
Petal  in silhouette, with great, violent swoops
on his face, his eyes
Lovelight
(
) Somewhere in there
We got married
- Horrible place
Smoke and bodies
Quoyle alone, carrying his sloshing beer, apologies unheard, toward
(
) After that,  had to follow her to see her
the back of Petal, talking to a big guy in a shiny suit
(
) Which  know was wrong of me
Closer
Close enough to hear
What do you think
You want to marry me, don't you
on Quoyle's face
The lovelight has never left
It shines through the shock
As if in apology
(
) She didn't know she was pregnant

- One-year-old  is  in a rickety crib festooned with mobiles and bright toys
Quoyle  in
He reaches to lift her
, starts running around the faded little parlor making cheerful airplane noises, as he  and  the shrieking kid, until he
stops
Sniffs
Oh
Gives her a kiss, which doesn't put a dent in the screaming, and flops her down on the diaper table
She is screaming
He is fumbling with the diaper, the Baby Wipes, getting a wad of ten or so at once
When
the phone rings
He runs off
Runs back, lifts Bunny, diaper dangling from the tape stuck to her skin, and  up the phone, hoping with everything in him that it's
(
) Hey
How do you make an Alabama Slammer
He takes a breath
Can hear the noise of a rowdy spot
Country juke box
Uh
Where are y
(
) Alabama
Hence, the question
Bunny
Has stopped screaming
Come home
'll make you one
(
) That's a swell idea
Now go look on top of the fridge, where  keep the Mr
Boston
'll wait
What should he do
He sets Bunny carefully on the floor
She starts screaming again, and he  her quick, cuddles her off, leaving the phone on the floor
back in with the Mr
Boston, a bag of pork rinds, and a pacifier
Something for everyone
As he flips the pages, he murmurs into the phone
You okay
Except for being thirsty
She laughs, almost friendly
He smiles
Ever hopeful

) 'm busy, 'll see y

(
) Got it
The  of her disconnect
He glances down at Bunny, working the pacifier
Murmurs to the receiver
Me too
'll tell Bunny you miss her
Hang up the phone
Kiss a baby
Eat a pork rind
Slow
As he gazes down on Bunny, we   her face, and to
'  - , an  of Bunny, now six years old, asleep in the flickering blue light of a nearly-mute
Apparently she was watching Sportscenter
the darkened shoebox room
Toys everywhere, in a clutter
pile of used Barbies, limbs jutting in all directions, waiting for a mass grave
to Bunny, to see
she sleeps in her father's lap
His chin resting on her head, an industrial-size bag of cookies handy
Somewhere, a door
Quoyle gently lays Bunny on her bed, and lurches the hall, to see Petal disappearing into her bedroom, and he hurries to stop the door before it slams in his face
When she turns, she is wasted, feral, and somehow as sexy as ever
Her laser glare
What the fuck do you want
There's
Cold chicken
Really
She tears off her jacket, revealing that she has left her shirt somewhere and is down to her bra
She stalks toward him
Straight to the doorway
He flinches
Find yourself
girlfriend
With what you got down there, you'll do fine
Quoyle swallows
Shakes his head
Only thing can work, here
Is divorce
No
No
Tears of shock pool in his eyes
(
) knew we had our problems
But never thought 'd hear that word
She shivers with disgust
Walks around in a frustrated circle
Back to his face
Are you sure
What does a girl have to do
And now
the tears are on his face
She flashes her hardest look
And yet
her slender fingers reach out
Wipe his face, not as roughly as she might have intended
Your funeral, pussy
And  the door, quietly, but firmly
In his face
He stares at it
His lips part
But no sound comes
Instead, he walks the few steps to Bunny's room, to find her
wide awake
Sitting on the edge of her bed
No question, she heard it all
So Quoyle smiles
He reaches to the top of her battered armoire
His eyes damp but dancing for his daughter
Pulls down
a box of chocolates
Their stash
He sits on the floor
Opens the lid, like buried treasure
She comes to cuddle in his lap
He feeds her one
She feeds him one
They've done this before
As they chew
(
) knew if  could take it
In the end
It would all work out
- Everyone trooping back from lunch, twos and threes
Quoyle last, alone, still stuffing down a snack cake as he heads for the coffee pot
There's one answering machine for everybody here, glowing a red number 2
Someone hits it, and everybody shuts up a beat, to see if they got lucky
(
) Lila, it's Daniel
Ten-thirty
Bring the
You know
doesn't even bother to blush
shrug is plenty
(
) Quoyle, this is your father
Calling you
Dicky's machine is full
Your home one's broke
Well
It's time for your mother and  to go
Quoyle listening
Go
(
) Instructions about the undertaker
The cremation
On the dining room table
Oh
Go
Eyes are sneaking over now
Lots of them
(
) You'll have to make your own way
did
Nobody gave me nuthin'
Other men woulda give up, turned to bums
sweated, wheeled barrows of sand, went without so you and yer brother could have advantages
Not that you did much with your chances
Everybody just openly staring now
Quoyle's snack cake and coffee frozen in mid-air
(
) Hasn't been much of a life
Tell Dicky and my sister Agnis Hamm
Her number's on the dining room ta
(
) That was your final message
Quoyle nods
Sounded that way
Despite the hateful coarseness of this message, Quoyle is deeply moved
Lips pursed inward to stem tears
In the silence
(trying) Were they sick, or something
Quoyle stares into distance
Somewhere, feet shuffle
Brain tumor and liver cancer
(afterthought) One apiece
(sad for him) That's rough
He nods, it is that
Wanders       on over to his desk
They're still watching, but he doesn't seem      to notice
Turns his ratty Rolodex with solemn slowness
Not to       dishonor the moment
Finds the number, dials
Winces at the       harshness of the voice he hears
Then
Dicky
It's Mom and Poppa
They
He can't say any more
Turns out, he doesn't need to
(
, snorts) Jeez, they did it
never thought he'd find the fucking guts
Quoyle licks his lips
His eyes puddling now
So
For the funeral,  thou
(
) You think 'd go pay that prick respects
You got me confused with you
Quoyle shakes his head once
That confused he isn't
(quietly) Well
Mom'll be there, too
Silence
(
) Hey, Barfbag
They leave us anything, y'think
Don't see how
Big mortgage
Spent their savings on the doctors
hadda send some grocery mon
(
) Well, see, that's why he did it
mean, think how it felt
Taking from you
they are watching him replace the receiver in its cradle
Think
Stumble slightly, as he makes his way toward
'  - Punch looks up, startled at Quoyle's entrance
His oversized glasses seem to magnify his eyes more than ever
Sorry, Ed
gotta drive down to my parents' place
'll be back, Friday
full beat
Take yer time

Quoyle's eyes sharpen
In what sense do you m
As in canned
Oh
Once again, life slips beneath even Quoyle's expectations
(a little dazed) Uh
Would next week be better
(sighs) got the summer interns comin' next week
They're free and they're smart
Gotta do somethin' to fight this slump
But don't worry
Don't
Yer not the only one
(beat) Eventually
beat
Should  finish the sawmill piece
'  - Quoyle enters carrying a spray of violets
Springer turned up loud
He goes to the parlor to find
, the babysitter, smoking and swigging a Pepsi
She is mean-ugly with flesh hanging beneath her arms
She stares at him, the flowers
(dry) Mr
Quoyle
You shouldn't have
(taking her literally) They're for Petal, Mrs
Moosup
got something to tell her
Well, that may take awhile
Uh-oh
She came in at one, packed like crazy
Said she was movin' to Florida with the guy in the red Geo
You know the one
He knows the one
She says you gotta pay my wages for the sittin'
Seven weeks, comes to $3080
'Preciate a check right n
He is heading toward the hall
Don't bother
She took Bunny with her
That stops him
Cold
He turns
That's the last thing she'd ev
She was real clear about my check
It's no fun workin' if you don't get paid
He  out,  the hall,  Bunny's room
closet open
Empty
No more tangled pile of Barbies
He surveys the wreckage of his life
(
) At least she took her toys
Wanted her to be happy
He staggers out of the room, down the hall
(
) Mr
Quoyle
ain't got all day, here
into the kitchen
Lifts the receiver
Thinks
Dials
(quietly) Yes
need to report a kidnapping
And straightens his spine
Just a little
Quoyle
-----
no, , then -
Yeh, it's my kid
He's still holding the violets
He notices this
Sets them down, almost tenderly, in the sink
'  - Quoyle alone in absolute darkness
Bumping around the house
There's a large bag of something in one hand, maybe  & Ms
But he's not eating
Just murmuring to himself
Who knows
Who knows
' ' ,  - Quoyle moving in his parents' cluttered parlor like a man underwater
room as drab, as neglected, as Brooklyn through the window
He stands at a shelf now, staring at a row of framed photos
Lifts one
a  of 15, bundled for winter, stands by a frozen pond
Stocky, sullen, something unpleasant in the narrow eyes
Next to him, not touching, a , big for 12
Rawboned, husky
Flat gaze, like something's dead or hidden
Quoyle walks to the table
cardboard box has been filled with mementos
slip of paper:  , a telephone number
The phone is  now
Quoyle staring at the paper
Finally, lifts the phone, breathes an absent greeting, and
(
) Is this Mr
Guy Quoyle
(weary) He's not here
(
) This is Lt
Amos Figg of the Mockingburg, New York Police
Could you have him call me when he ret
He's passed on
He's dead
(beat) You said Mockingb
(
) We're a small town upstate
'm actually trying to reach his son
He allegedly went down to his parents' place two days ago
Quoyle blinks
Not in the mood
Are you a detective, Lieutenant
(
) Yes sir
Well, as you've probably deduced, am his son
Cause 'm at his place
As alleged
Silence
(
) There's no need for that tone, sir
'm calling with urgent news
And says no more
We can feel Quoyle's heart beating from here
Which is
(
, hesitant) You want the good news
Or the bad news
Ominous
Would be an understatement
The good
Please
(
) Your daughter Bunny was sold by your wife to a child pornographer
For $9000
Quoyle's heart
Has stopped
(
) But she's fine
We got her
And the doc says she wasn't touched
Yet
If you catch my drift
a dingy kitchen, scuzzier than we could even have guessed
Bunny in her underpants sliding merrily on a floor made slippery with dish detergent
past the video camera on its tripod to the  at the window, also in his underpants, screaming into a cordless phone
And
to Quoyle
His heart must have started again, because he is able to say
That's
The good n
(
) Well
Compared
a riverbank somewhere high above swiftly-flowing water
Police and bystanders gathered
winch reaching its chain into the depths
(
) Your wife was in a red Geo which went through a guardrail over the Chesapeake Bay Bridge
Here comes part of the Geo
Streaming water and mud
(
) They were doin' 97 in a fog
The car was cut in half by the impact with the rail
Her male companion's body floated up downstream
to the horrified husband
Waiting in silence
And Petal
(
) May never find the body
But she was mercifully killed on impact, without a doubt
They found her shoes under the dash and her
trousers for some reas
That don't mean for sure she w
(
) and her purse
With the nine large
Oh
Tears finally force their way through the shock
As he realizes
(a murmur) Yeh
If she was alive
Don't guess she'd a left that
- Quoyle moving his bulk  down a corridor, a uniformed  almost skipping alongside to keep up, watching Quoyle like a hawk all the way to
the threadbare common room
Kids playing, arguing, sleeping, staring at an antique
Quoyle goes  them all, cop doggedly in his wake, and sinks to his knees beside
can't do this
Bunny on the ratty sofa, legs dangling, holding out a vintage Gameboy
She wears clean clothes, freshly-washed hair, and a comfortable smile
(very soft) Me neither
And kisses her, lightly, on the lips
(softer still) Hi
She kisses him back, much harder, on the mouth
The lopsided grin of a practicing imp
Hi, too
That for me
We hadn't seen them, hidden beside his leg
bunch of
He gives them to her
Like her best beau
Where's our candy
In the store
That way, you've got the whole selection
And then
Give us a minute
Bunny doesn't understand
mean him
to the cop, staring down on them from point-blank range
He doesn't move
Quoyle looks up, with an easy smile that says he'd just as soon tear all the arms and legs off, and sweat the consequences later
The cop backs well off
He can take a hint
Petal went to Florida
She'll be back soon
He looks in her eyes
Shakes his head
No
She had an accident
So do you
He nods,  do
Tenderly pulls a strand of her hair aside
There was a car crash, sweetie
And they found
you know, the body
Of her friend
Nestor
That's right
His big hand has wrapped around one of hers
She doesn't seem to mind
Their faces so close
Petal can't come back, she's dead
You know dead
Like the turtle
She drills his eyes
Calm as a moose
We found the turtle
And they found Nestor
Did you find Petal
He shakes his head
You never do
But she always comes back
And leans her forehead
To rest against his
Don't worry
'  - Quoyle stumbling toward the front door, drawing his robe around him
Squinting through the peephole
the door, to reveal
Nephew, 'm your Aunt
Agnis Hamm
Tall and rawboned and 60
rugged, maybe even handsome face, set with ice-blue eyes
Calm, slightly scary eyes, that drift to his robe
You sick
It's nine o'clock
He is completely off-balance here
Uh
No, Bunny and  like to
uh, early to bed, earl
Losin' your wife, your folks, and your job'd depress anybody
It's a wonder you don't sleep all day
Not that she seems to approve
Not at all
His eyes now drift to the large, well-used  dangling from her powerful hands
Thought 'd stay a day or two
Give you some relief with th
And stops
The mouth doesn't smile
But the eyes crinkle slightly toward
Bunny
Who has crept out in her jammies
Hugging a sack of Pepperidge Farm cookies like it was a teddy
(to Bunny) You like blue dogs named Warren
The little girl nods
As if she certainly does
got one in the car
- In the far corner of the room, Bunny plays with , a sweet, ugly dog
Toothless and, undeniably, blue
(
) never knew her, really
See him now, sipping his tea
Wallowing in the detritus of his emotions
But she was driven by terrible forces, no one could understand
She was a locked door
Even to me
Agnis in the good chair
Teacup on her ample lap
Assessing a photo on the end table, Petal's arctic eyes, rigidly seductive pose
The snapshot enshrined by a neighboring votive rose in its jelly jar glass
So she wasn't just a bitch in high heels
Quoyle's eyes cut instinctively toward his daughter, her innocence protected by distance and absorption with Warren's passivity
Don't stress
She mighta heard worse from her momma
'm only guessin'
Some people probably thought Petal was bad clear through
People
Are a cynical lot
think she just couldn't get enough love
Agnis' unblinking eyes
think the evidence
Is on your side
The eyes study him
Dissect him, even
'm headed north, Nephew, to where our family comes from, in Newfoundland
Thought 'd never go back
But the older y'get
Clucks her tongue
There's a pull
Becomes an ache
As if where your people started held a purpose for you
Like you're a piece in a puzzle
Not a smile
But something
softening of timbre, a flicker behind the eye
lookin' for where y'fit
Lifts her cup
You, too
Takes a sip
His eyes have narrowed in a burlesque of suspicion
In what sense do you m
You need to come, Nephew
Just like that
Nothin' here but hurt
You got to start fresh, everythin's gone
Hmmn
The trip'll clear your head
Be educational for the squirt
Teach ya the world's still spinnin' outside this toxic slice o'Hades
And who knows
Tilts her head
Who knows
They must have a newspaper up there
Somebody's gotta write it
He just stares
The blankest of the blank
Tell the truth, 'd appreciate the company
You two are pretty much my family
His face softens
Hadn't thought of it that way
And seeing this
pot o'coffee would hit the spot
Drop o'whiskey would fit nice in it
She waits
He rises
And when he does
Which one's my brother
He blinks
She looks at two  on the mantle
Uh
There's Mom
And that's Poppa
The name of the funeral home tastefully stenciled
He clears his throat
Those are temporary
Coffee
And maybe a sweet
Quoyle nods, glad to serve
Heads off to the kitchen
Agnis looks at Bunny and Warren
She needs to go outside
know why
She runs out, the dog trotting after
Alone now
Agnis pulls something from her large carpetbag purse
It is an oversized
She stands
Crosses to
her brother's urn
She removes the lid
Turns the huge Ziploc upside down to  the urn
Then, in one deft movement
the urn, a cascade of ash tumbling into the Ziploc
Seals it
Sets it to one side
Then, from her purse
another ziploc already filled with replacement ashes
She pours just enough into the urn
That should do it
Stashes the rest back in her purse
Turns now to lift
the Ziploc with her brother's remains
Stares at it
Think Hamlet with Yorrick's skull
What say, Guy
The dumpster
beat
Eyes flat and neutral
Just a thought
- world of fog and reflected high beams
Big rig pulls over, and Petal climbs up and in, her short red dress fluttering about her thighs
The truck is roaring heedlessly through dense cloud
The  is gross and bald, snot suspended from his nostrils
He lets go of the wheel to run his hairy hands  Petal's dress, while through the shotgun window, we see
Quoyle  along outside, like a superhero
Except he is shocked bug-eyed by the tableau
The disgusting driver buries his face in Petal's hair, she throws her head back laughing, and the driver becomes Quoyle's , Quoyle silently  outside the window, and  cut to
, --  - Quoyle    blinking awake on the deck of a pitching ferry
Fog and cliff    and the raw Atlantic
And  alongside, an amazing number of
the gulls and terns seeming to stare Quoyle in    the eye as they glide past
Maybe they prompted his dream
(
) They draft off our air currents, it's quite premeditated
She stands at the rail
Smoking, despite the wind
They actually know the ferry schedule
Show up on time better'n the Newfies
He smiles a seasick smile
Lurches from his bolted-down chair to join her
She nods back toward
Bunny through the glass window, snuggled with Warren, feeding the dog french fries
image of m'sister, Feeny
She's married to a falconer in Arabia, now
Has to wear a black thing over her face
Like the falcon
She stares in his eyes
Yes, like the falcon
They are growing on each other in a companionable way
Nice
To be with family
He smiles
It is nice
'Specially big shots
Who can land a job with one phone call
His smile changes color
quiet pride in the modest
Well, that was my friend Partridge
Made the call
And it's just an interview
When Quoyle looks back in at Bunny, he sees she is staring off at something with full attention
He follows her gaze to
a honey-haired  with her small  snuggled in her lap
She is feeding him an ice cream bar with evident tenderness
And though the child's face is blissfully vacant, she murmurs to him with serious intent
,    - Quoyle driving a winding, rutted road, high above the coastline
Cracked cliffs in volcanic glazes
Long-abandoned settlements jutting from raw granite
Icebergs on the horizon above the rumpled, creased fabric of a brilliant blue sea
Beside him
On the map, here
Quoyle Point
Named after us
You
It all seems at once awe-inspiring, frighteningly lonely
And hostile as hell
'  - The car pulls up in a shroud of mist
Our family climbs out, stares into what seems the center of a dense cloud, until
the fog
And like a ghost, a   appears
Then, disappears
Then,  again
This time, to stay
(bottomless pride) was born here
The green makes me hurl
(Warren whimpers) Her, too
The cloud lifts further, and we see the house stands alone on a rocky point
The bay roils far below
Half the window panes are gone
Holes in the roof, paint flaking everywhere
Lonely and scary as any haunted house
Empty 44 years
And look at that roofline, straight as a ruler
Quoyle looks at her
Looks at the house
Looks at her
Take it easy
Floor mighta fallen into the cellar
(laughs) Not likely
There is no cellar
No foundation, neither
She takes Bunny's squirming hand and starts toward the house, as if crossing Jordan
(calling back) The whole thing's lashed with cable, to iron rings set in the rock
He just stands there
Sees the cables now, the rings
(calling out) Uh
Why would they do th
(calling back) Long story
Apparently a private one, too
Keeps walking
- Inside the dank, corroding place
We can feel all 44 years of abandonment
The door  open
Quoyle with his tire iron steps aside, and
Agnis drags Bunny inside
The wind shrieking low through openings like proper spirits
Even this bold child is frightened
So Agnis leans to murmur
Up those stairs, Aunt Pinkie slept
So fat she couldn't get down to her chamber pot
Wanna see if she's still there
Asked as a serious question
Bunny nods
Let's
upstairs now
Agnis marching through like MacArthur reclaiming the Philippines
Room after rough-hewn spacious room, light spiking through a thousand roof holes in assorted shapes
Well
Too late to drive that road back 'round the bay
We'll camp in here tonight
Be right as rain
Quoyle looks down to his daughter
Who nods, as if that were a perfectly natural suggestion
Which one's Petal's room
'll sleep there
- on Bunny's sleeping face
her closed eyes, and to
a , unearthly tendrils of  drifting past in moonglow wisps
Suddenly, a  appears, an animal
White
Wolf, or more likely, dog
It stares in at us, is fleetingly joined by a grizzled  ghost, eyes  crazy, and
gone in mist
to
of Quoyle and Bunny, each rolled over onto one side, asleep in their sleeping bags
His arm across her protectively
Hers across Warren, who sleeps curled to her chest
up to
the window
Only the shimmer of cloud-like mist
to
Bunny's eyes
wide open
- on Quoyle, stirring at the end of sleep
His eyes flutter open
beat
He is alone
sits
front hallway, Quoyle's bulk  toward us, boots in his hand
The front door ajar
And at the threshold, in a decorous semi-circle, six naked Barbies
Legs spread wide for balance
Each staring out the doorway, to where
Bunny sits on the cold ground
Making some craft project with great care
Quoyle can breathe again, she's safe
Ambles out, crouches beside her
Close
She keeps working
Almost eerie concentration
He sees now that she is weaving a loop of dandelion stems, connected by aluminum pop tops
He leans down
Kisses her head
Is that a belt or a crown
No answer
That concerns him
The intensity of her focus
He notices now, the soda and beer cans with their tops popped
Lined up in a row
He lifts one, liquid sloshes out
They're full
Sodas get flat withou
This is important
She won't look up
He glances back to the doorway
That why the Barbies are watching
They're being nice and patient
They must be chilly, tho
Should get their clo
They look better this way
They have great bodies
He looks back
Well
Maybe so
Holds up one of the heavy boots he's carrying
It has a thick blue shoelace
The other
Has none
Sticks that one in front of her face
She looks up to him
Tugs on the shoelace, which she now wears as a necklace
need it
look good in blue
(smiles) Well
look good in shoes
sees now what she has tugged from inside her shirt
The shoelace necklace holds a dull metal  as a pendant
He blinks
was lookin' for that all over our old place
The landlady s
need it
He takes that in
The urgency of it
She is staring in his eyes
So he grins
You had quite the heavy morning
Take the rest of the day off
She doesn't smile back
Returns to her work
He looks out by the cliff, to see Agnis staring across the bay, Warren sitting at her side
He pulls on his boots
Gets to his feet
Be right back, and we'll start talking breakf
(not looking up) Watch out for the dog
He looks across the ground toward old Warren
Yeh, her farts are pretty scary
mean
The white one
Now their eyes meet
Matter-of-fact
The White Dog with the big teeth and the red eyes
The Skinny Ghost owns him
They came last night
He draws a breath
didn't dream 'em, don't say did
He thinks this over
was gonna say
'll keep my eyes peeled
And makes a funny gesture, like peeling his eyeballs
She goes back to work
His eyes linger
Then, he heads off toward the cliff
When he gets there
(staring across the bay) 'll get us a carpenter
Fix the place up in no time
We'll find a rooming house til th
Be cheaper to build a new one
On the Riviera, even
Now she looks at him
Her flat, bottomless eyes
Only  weren't born
On the Riviera
-kay
That's settled
He nods, humbly, dumbly
She points off across the water
An actual
Flour Sack Cove
What time's your interview at that paper
Ten o'clock
Ten o'clock
The drive's a bitch
We'll buy us a boat
He tries a smile
Unavoidably lame
'm not
water person
(dead straight) boat
That's the ticket
His grin hardens
Just enough to say that on this issue, maybe even she can't push him
He turns around
Starts back toward his daughter
not a water person
- Quoyle driving alone in his best suit
Which is also his worst suit
Which is also the suit he wore to interview Ed Punch, years ago
Hard rain
Potholes
Around a curve, to see ahead
of a tall , holding the hand of a  as they walk in their slickers through the downpour
As he passes them, they  and
the woman is Petal
The child is Bunny
They both stick their tongues out at him
Past now
Looking in the rear-view
The woman is lovely and no longer Petal
The child is a , with a slack face and warm smile
Surprisingly, the same mother and son that Bunny watched on the ferry
(
) Someone found a pretty wife
Still staring in the mirror
The receding figures small against the rain
(
) Someone always does
- Quoyle pulls up to a ramshackle place, its sign: over a painted quacking duck
As he climbs out, he hears from inside
door opens, and
a crab-Iike figure scuttles out, jumps in a Toyota truck, turns the key
Kills the engine
He looks out at Quoyle standing in what's left of the rain
Climbs back out
Rasps
As you can see, sometimes y'can't get away
'm Tert
Card, the bloody so-called managing editor, copyeditor, rewrite man, mechanicals, ad makeup department, mail and distribution chief, and snow shoveler
More of a leering rictus than an actual smile
is aging, balding, potbellied over a once-rawboned frame
His face looks like cottage cheese clawed with a fork
He scratches his balls with a rough-hewn hand
He is never happy
And you are either a big advertiser come to buy a four-page spread to push your warehouse of left-footed Japanese boots
Or
You
Are the breathlessly-awaited Quoyle
That'd be me
The second one
Card rakes his privates once more, and offers the same hand in dubious greeting
Quoyle takes it
Have to do without the Ultimate Cheese, y'will
Himself, Mr
Jack Buggit, is up at the house having charms said over his scrawny chest to clear out that impressive accumulation of phlegm he's been hawking all week
Claps a mirthless hand on Quoyle's back, leading him into
- newsroom
Makes the Mockingburg Record look like the Washington Post
Only two employees at their vintage desks
Card points as he bellows
Now, there's Billy Pretty
He's something of a landmark and an old fish dog
is wizened and wiry, pushing 70
tiny, energetic creature with well-weathered hide, watering crystal-blue eyes, and a slanted smile
He waves a bony hand
Billy does the Home News page
Poems, baby photos, household tips, and a gossip column, under the byline of Junior Sugg, that is pretty much straight libel
Billy nods
That pretty much covers it
In short
He writes the only stuff anybody actually reads
Little salute from the Managing Editor
If Card likes anybody, he likes Billy
And he doesn't
Now this miserable ugly Brit, is Beaufield Nutbeem
Imagines he's the foreign news chief
Steals every story off that foul shortwave radio and rewrites it in Limey prose
(smiling) Which bloody Card rewrites in a mystical tongue most charitably referenced as an unacquireable taste
is 50 and gangly
Buttery hair swept behind ample ears
thin moustache, a bounteous bowtie, a ratty pullover
He opens a file folder
Gives Quoyle a piercing, meaningful glance
Mine: 'Burmese sawmill owners and the Rangoon Development Corporation met in Tokyo Tuesday to consider a joint approach to marketing tropical hardwoods
' Got it
Turns the page
Card's rewrite: 'Burnoosed sawbill awnings and the Ranger Devotional Competition met Wednesday near Tokyo to mark up local hairwood
' stunned
Silence
It's shorter, and  got Tokyo right
If misspelled
Now what's funnier, Quoyle
My writing style, or the fantasy that any Newfie would read that moosepuckey in the first pIa
(to Nutbeem) How'd the meeting go
Did they agree on a joint marketing approach
The beginning
Of a beautiful friendship
(gentle smile) Still in progress, old bean
One can only hope
Card, who likes no one
Doesn't like Quoyle, too
There's your miserable desk, Quoyle
We've got no idea what yer s'posed to do
But Mr
Jack Buggit will drop by someday and enlighten us all
Til then
And he turns away
Through the swinging door
Quiet
Except for Nutbeem's chuckle
- Quoyle pulls up beside the ancestral home
Agnis stands at the back of a rented truck, sorting through materials in the payload
Across a stretch of ground, Bunny is earnestly pretend-reading a book to Warren, who lies listlessly before her
Quoyle comes up behind Agnis
He carries a newspaper and an excited air
Listen to this
'Well, we see the postman has landed in jail for 45 days for throwing the mail in Killick-Claw Harbor
He said he had too much to deliver, and folks could just take a dip and help themselves
' He looks up, eager for her reaction
She is still sorting through bolts of thick cloth, spools of heavy thread, odd mechanical devices
This is great stuff
' snowmobile mishap has taken the life of 78-year- old Rick Puff, who was on his way home from what the Widow Puff calls a 'screech-in and a carouse,' when his machine fell through the ice
well- known accordion player, Mr
Puff had served four years in the 1970s for sexual assault on his daughters
Bet they aren't crying, either
' This Billy Pretty can really write
(absently) passes as colorful
He looks into the truck
Sees all the stuff
She surveys his puzzlement
Nephew, we can't fix up the house proper on a journalist's wages
So  have un-retired
Oh
Absorbs that
From what
Upholstery
Been sought after for 33 years, wherever 've lived
This should be the real test, huh
Quoyle nods
Could be that
The sudden sound of footsteps above them, makes him look up sharply, to see
a fit young  in a toolbelt climbing down a ladder from the roof
The muscles of a stud, the shy smile of a boy, he waves a greeting and  down the last six feet to the ground
This is Dennis Buggit, master carpenter
offers a hand, and a smile that says he's expecting to like you
Makes the sentiment contagious
Only til  get my lobster license
'm a fisherman in my soul
strong handshake
On both sides
It's a Newfie thing, the compulsion to fish
'hear yesterday's tragedy 'bout the Newfie who went ice fishin'
Quoyle hasn't
Brought home 200 pounds of ice
His wife fried it
They both drowned
Quoyle laughs good and honest
Dennis likes that
With me workin', we'll need day care for Bunny after school
Turns out Dennis and his wife send their little girl to this wonderful saintly woman
How's that for us livin' a charmed life
Quoyle nods, if a bit cautious
Dennis squints out across the bay
Agnis says yer buyin' a boat
Sooner's prob'ly better'n lat
(quiet smile) 'm not buyin'
No boat
Sounds pretty sure of that
Punctures the amiable ambiance with a shard of silence
Well, course we're buy
(to Dennis) Buggit, huh
Any kin to my boss on the Gammy Bird
The silence
Just got thunderous
full beat
(low) Oh, yeh
He's m'dad
Even the eyes glance down
What is that
In the wake of it
(cheerful) Gonna chat up yer daughter, or just ignore her as usual
Quoyle nods
Better do that
Dennis sends a shy smile, as if apologizing for the awkwardness
Quoyle holds up a finger, be right back, and
heads on over to where Bunny is reading to Warren
Warren threw up in your sleeping bag
She's got a stomach problem
Quoyle takes a breath to answer, but stops
He's caught a whiff
(
) Headline
Dog Fart Fells Freelance Reporter
Promising Career Nipped in Bud
It's called cancer
Oh
Quoyle holds his face together, as Bunny strokes the limp Warren
Then, he crouches down
strokes Warren, too
Good dog
- Quoyle enters
Billy Pretty's on the phone, hand cupped over the receiver, like it's top secret
Nutbeem's tuning his ancient shortwave with a butter knife through the hole where a knob ought to be
And as Quoyle sets down his sack lunch and thermos, as he peels off his parka, he's staring straight into the eyes of
Tert Card across the way
Wearing a wicked and mysterious smile
As Quoyle's butt lowers toward his chair
(
) Ouoyle  a foot
Looks from Card to Billy to Nutbeem
What's going on
(
) '
,   , '
around
Through the glass of the only private office, sits a rumpled codger with a bullhorn
, has his rubber boots up on the desk, scale-spattered overalls over his compact, sinewy body
His hair is wisps and shocks, and his face is strewn with stubble split by a leprechaun's grin around a stained hand-rolled ciggie
(into bullhorn) ' '
Tell the truth
Jack  him in, with great energetic loops
The grin more rowdy than his boy's
But the charm is there and more so
Quoyle goes
(
) Hold onto yer danglies, little sister
closes the door behind him
Jack's eyes are crinkly blue
They study Quoyle good
And right in his face
(into bullhorn) - Based on my
test, huh
Where'd rate
(sets the bullhorn down) Advanced squirrel
This ties you with me, an'  own the place
Holds out a brown fisherman's hand
Quoyle takes it
Pleased t'meetcha, Billy says yer workin' out
wink
Tert Card says he's keepin' an eye on ya
Since he's a self-servin' liar, helluva ad salesman tho, it means he's jealous
And Nutbeem
Lifts the bullhorn
(into bullhorn) ' (
, through glass) Jack's grin grows a twinkle
Soft spot for the Brit
Nutbeem's obsessed with actual news
Makes up for it by manning the sexual abuse desk
Can't keep up with the volume there, we're runnin' three, four a week
Leans forward
Like he's dishing the lowdown
Card's in charge
Ya hear this and that 'bout his typos, but typos is part of Gammy Bird
Everyone gets a laugh, and gets to figger 'em out
Better'n a crossword
Stabs out his cigarette
Pulls a new one from a damp little box
An' Billy
Well, Billy's a writer and a fisherman
Me, 'm just a fisherman
Offers the box
Quoyle shakes him off
Fishin' and the sea is all  am
My pap the same
My boy
So he said
Waitin' for his license
Ah
Jack's smile doesn't actually fade
But the eyes flicker, and Quoyle is sorry he opened his yap
Naw, my boy's passed
Went to sea and there he rests
Bless his bones
His glance goes to a photo
Jack and a strapping blond son
Not Dennis, that's for sure
Somehow, we are suddenly down to business
Want two things from ya, Quoyle
First
You cover every local car wreck, take pictures
Front-page photo every week, whether we have a wreck or not, an' we always do
When we don't, we dip into Card's file, he's got some beauties
half a red Geo being fished out of the water
Petal's lifeless torso hanging backwards out the door, arms gracefully extended like a ballerina or Olympic diver
Over this
(
) Knack to this
If there's a dark patch on the ground, it reads blood, whether it's motor oil or Diet Coke
Gloves, hat, lyin' in the road
to Jack
Canny and keen
He knows this stuff
somethin' that humanizes, makes ya feel
That's what a wreck is
It's always saying, 'There but for the grace of God
' Do ya follow
Quoyle follows
Plus
We're starting a feature on the shipping news
What ships come in, what goes out
Whatever's of interest
Throwin' it to you, son
Chance to shine
beat
Mr
Buggit
'm not
Well, a water person
Ah
Jack takes this in
The smile returns
Chance
To shine
If you catch my drift
Quoyle shuts up
One peculiarity
'm no joke, son, and  don't tolerate jokes about Newfies
Or them that does
to
'  - on Dennis, holding a half-eaten squidburger in two hands
Oblivious to sawdust, smoke and stench, he is charmingly, engagingly, smashed
So this Newfie comes to Toronto
Cabbie says, take ya to meet girls for a good time
Boy says, okay, but  only want a Newfie girl
His audience is Quoyle and Nutbeem
Each holds a squidburger of his own, tentacles dangling
Quoyle has his next one handy by his beer
Right section of the party district, he finds a girl, they have sex, she says that's a hunnerd dollars
He says fine, tips her another hunnerd
She says, wow, can y'come back t'morrow
Quoyle takes a humongus
Tentacles now dripping from his jaws
Rapt
Hypnotized
Next two nights, same thing
Finally she says,  never met so sweet a guy, where ya from
He says, Misky Bay, Newfoundland
She says, really
Me, too
Quoyle hanging on the punch
He says,  know
Yer ma asked me t'give ya six hunnerd dollars
Quoyle  his laughter, dislodging a tentacled morsel or two
Nutbeem has to look away, as Quoyle retrieves the chunks, stuffs 'em back in his mouth
Yer the model Newfie, , but fer th'boat
Why doncha buy Nutbeem's
Drunken, devilish smile
Quoyle turns, innocent questioning eyes
You got a boat
built a Chinese junk
Sailed it up from Brazil
Missed Manhattan by a mile or so, got stranded here when shipwrecked by Gaze Island
So casual and falsely modest, Quoyle's eyes are big
Almost finished my repairs
Be leaving soon
As paleontologists define the term
Studies Quoyle's amazement
Confides
She's ugly
And the only thing 've ever loved
Dennis rises
Belches
Yer story tugs at me bladder
And off he lurches to correct the situation
Once he's gone
Him and Jack
Tell it
Their eyes meet
The Brit sighs
Jack Buggit's psychic, start with that
He's got the gift
Specially about the sea
Thinking
Should he tell it
Quoyle makes a rolling hand motion, hurry it up
Older brother Jesson, everyone's favorite, even Dennis'
Goes to sea like his dad
One day, rest of the family's sitting by the radio, and Jack goes white
That's right
Stands up
Says, Jesson's gone
Walks out of the house
Grief too big for walls to hold it
Sets down the burger
Runs a finger down the frost on his beer mug
So Dennis is forbidden the sea
But being free, Newfie, and 21, he goes anyway
And that's enough t
Death storm
Monster wave cracks her steel hull amidships, one inch crack from starboard to port
Men go in the water
Dennis lost
After a week
week
They come to Jack, call off the search
He stands like a stone
Then turns, sharp, the way he does
Says only, 'He's alive
And  know where
' Man's a witch
Went to sea, alone, in just a skiff
Finds him
Can you guess the odds
Finds him
Finds him
Both arms broke, 99% dead
Leans
Close
Boy comes to
Jack says if you ever step in a boat again, 'll drown ya m'self
And you know what the kid said
Quoyle glances over
Dennis wobbling his way back through the tables
Say it fast
Says fishin' licenses are all spoken for, 'd appreciate you givin' me yours
Jack looked in his eyes
They never spoke ag
What's bein' blabbed here
(not missing a beat) Quoyle says you got a nice ass
Quoyle's right
He raises his beer
To my ass
'll drink to that
And, by God
They do
'  - Quoyle and Bunny climb out of the wagon
small house, its grassy yard strewn with a phantasmagoria of painted wood figures, galloping horses, dogs balanced on wheels, a row of chrome hubcaps on sticks
zoo of the mind
To one side, a table piled with crafts, ignored by
fifteen   running in all directions, like bundled, unbridled banshees
Looks like fun
Two harried  are trying to cope with the chaos
And there, under a tree
the honey-haired  Quoyle had seen on the ferry
And in the rain
She is on her knees, tying the shoes of her vacant-faced He trips and sprawls, but he is laughing
The woman smiles tenderly and tousles his brown-straw hair
Quoyle gets up his courage
Walks Bunny over to them
As we arrive, the woman looks up
(really nervous) Hullo
It's our first day, and was wond
What's wrong with him
Quoyle freezes
She means, of course, the blankly-staring boy
Hey, how 'bout we ask what's wrong with you
There's nothing wr
(to Bunny, softly) Sure, there is
This is Herry, and he has Down's Syndrome
It means he learns things very slowly
Oh
smiles at Bunny
Suddenly, wonderfully
(to Herry) Know how to be a dog
She  to all fours and starts  like a terrier
Herry with delight
Tumbles down to the grass and does his impression of a Chihuahua on speed
(to the woman) He looks fast to me
Maybe he's cured
Maybe
The kids waddle off in their canine personas
Alone with the woman now, Quoyle is near-catatonic
Come on, brain
Which one of those women is in charge here
The woman looks at him
Clear cornflower eyes
As comfortable in silence as he is agonized
Then, she squints out at the other women, desperately running ragged after the kids
Neither of 'em
They're just moms
Oh
Well, my lord, whoever runs the place should be giving this a little more attention
She looks back at him, blankly
You think
mean, children need structure
No one's even guarding that craft table, they could be running around with scissors and get hurt
The woman's eyes bottomless, unreadable
The silence excruciating for poor Quoyle
He clears his throat
Um
write for the newspa
But she stands
The grace and quickness of a jungle cat
Well
'd better get to work, see
Providing structure and all
Brushes off her skirt
He is in the dawning panic of beginning to realize
'm Wavey Prowse, and this is my place
Pardon our antiquated emphasis on individuality and the freedom to have fun
Heads off with a loose-limbed stride
Spins back around
Oh, yeh
Running with sharp objects
We save for Tuesdays
Got it
He gawks like a stupid animal
Nods, got it
She's already gone
- Quoyle and Billy Pretty stroll the teak deck of a massive, elegantly-outfitted
The wiry little fellow keeps his smile to his eyes
Well, she don't wear a ring, cause she lost her husband at sea
Just after the boy was born
Oh
Quoyle nods, blandly
As if it is a matter of no real concern Well,  was just
sharpenin' those observation skills
First tool of a quality reporter
Keep walking
She has wonderful
Posture
(has to smile) Yer know,  never notic
(
) Look up ahead to the bow, where a rolling bar has been set up
is mixing drinks
He has a florid face and striking white hair
Dapper, arrogant, a guy with more money than he's worked for
As we approach
Ever seen anything like her
Quoyle looks to the sour-faced middle-aged lady, who glances disdainfully at us above her gimlet
used to be pretty and rich
She's still rich
(politely) No sir, your wife is very lovl
mean
The ship
Oh
Billy keeps a straight face
Silver  her eyes
It was built for Hitler
You've heard of Hitler
Up here in Canada
Oh, yessir
He was in all the papers
Way back
Silver snorts a laugh
Melville wonders if that was irony
Looking at Quoyle, he doubts that's possible
Finest botterjacht ever built in Holland
Flat-bottomed, she can go right up on shore in a storm
Incredibly heavy, forty tons of oak
Not unlike the barges of Henry and Elizabeth
(helpful) We heard a them, too
Tell them what happened
In Hurricane Bob
He looks at his wife
Clear in a glance they hate each other's guts
Go on, she nods
Tell it
Pounded twelve beach houses
Expensive ones
To rubble
Drunk and mean
And smarter than he is
Now tell them
Who let our insurance lapse
Silence
Took six very expensive lawyers to weasel us out of it
An inch from bankruptcy
She winks
Moral of the story
When you marry a tour guide
Confine his authority to mixing the drinks
Same again, dear
And holds out her glass
Billy looks out to sea
Like he hasn't heard this
(cheerful) So
What brings you folks up from Long Island
beat
While husband and wife glare at each other
My dining salon needs refitting
And the best custom yacht upholsterer in the Northern Hemisphere just moved here
was forced
To follow
She turns to Quoyle
Who just gapes at her
Open-mouthed
(softly) Oh
My
God
- Quoyle enters, impressed by the progress of the renovation
Windows are in, walls patched, floor sanded, lights are working
Through the place into
the kitchen, which is in surprisingly usable shape
Agnis sits alone at a butcher block table with a set of ledgers spread before her
large mug of tea
bottle of Bushmill's Irish
You are a woman of mystery, Aunt
Mystery and surprise
(still working) Silver Melville says you was out there
Be nice in yer story, she's payin' for a piece of this house
Silence
You said upholstery
Never said yacht uphol
never said not
Ask better questions, you got a chance fer better answers
Got my shop set up in Killick-Claw, now
Looks up
Sees he's dazzled by how she moves right along
Two good workers
Mrs
Mavis Bangs is an old plow horse like m'self
But Dawn
She winks
Dawn's young and on the sexy side
You oughta drop by and say hullo
He absorbs that
How fast can he change the subject
Where's Bunny
Agnis looks at him
Reaches for the Bushmill's
Upstairs, in what will soon become her room
She'll be all right
What does that mean
She pours some whiskey into her tea cup
Little early in the day f
Warren died today
That's what that means
Drinks the whiskey
Stares straight in his eyes
Sees his sorrow
The honesty in
Poor old girl
Agnis deciding
Whether to tell him
used to live with someone named Warren
Died of cancer, after nine years together
Dearest soul on this earth
Quoyle shocked
What can he say
His empathy so naked, so real, even Agnis has to soften her voice
Went from the funeral, and bought that dog
Named her Warren
Just so  could say the name a hunnerd times a day
Women are foolish, huh
never thought so
good moment for them
It holds a beat
Bunny wants to bury the dog with me
But  told her 'd rather do it alone
Quoyle nods
Rises slowly
He'd better go to her
Some advice about the child
Another sip
Don't get down on her level, the way you do
She'll never respect you
'  - Bunny sits on the floor in dim light, wearing an enormous blue sweatshirt
Obviously dad's
Her naked Barbies sit in a semi- circle watching her braid a meticulous loop out of the paper and foil from chewing gum wrappers
Quoyle enters, and sits close beside her
Watches in silence, as she works
(not looking up) Warren died today
She's not coming back
No tears
Just a hollow sound in her voice
That's the difference
He knows what she means
Strokes her hair
Another necklace, huh
Can help
You can watch
Okay
He looks at the Barbies
Do  have to take my clothes off
She looks up at him
Straight to his eyes
You look better with 'em on
Goes back to work
He watches her
You know
You do look good in blue
- Quoyle driving the wagon, Dennis at his side
Up ahead on the road, two figures
Herry holds tight to his mom's hand
Quoyle pulls over, and they stop
Wavey squints at him, against the sun
Give you folks a lift
That extra beat before she says
We're enjoyin' the walk, thank you
Doesn't smile
Doesn't look angry either
Just comfortable
Well
My aunt can't bring Bunny to the daycare, she's got her shop now
But  worked it out with my boss
So 'll be bringin' her come next week
No reaction
If that's all right
Love to have her
'm sorry, Mr
Quoyle, about the other time
Women can be moody, you know
And temperamental
Now she smiles
One-tenth power
Still a dazzler
Only the best ones
Did she like that
Hard to tell
She looks around him
Good afternoon, Dennis
Give our respects to Beety and Marty
He waves, will do
She takes Herry's hand, starts off down the road
Quoyle sits and watches
Excellent posture
Quoyle looks over
His pal shrugs
People talk
- Rear  of Agnis, walking over stones to the edge of the sea, carrying something in her arms
Walking to meet the sun, as it gives its last to the shimmering water
to see
she carries her old dog
On a clean sheet
Rests the burden gently down
The incoming tide laps over
The sheet billows in it
She takes a step back
You were a good girl, Warren, no trouble a'tall
Surf rolls out
Swims back in
Flows around her friend
- An outhouse stands unobtrusively near the edge of the cliff
See Agnis alone, approaching
Something in her hand
As she reaches the outhouse, we see it is
the ziploc bag
With her brother's ashes
She gazes back at the house now
Then, at the bag
(cold, low) Hope ya like
What we done with the place
She opens the door, enters
Stares down into the deep hole
Unzips the bag, and
the ashes   the hole
Watch them in -, falling free
Hear the rustle of Agnis lifting her skirts, and
on Agnis' face
Staring out at the sea through a small crack in the outhouse wall
the splatter as she voids herself
(a murmur) Welcome home
'  - Daycare in progress
The comfy parlor has been given over to the kids
wall of Polaroids of each child faces a map of Newfoundland with drawings of moose, caribou, and lobster
Little Herry sits alone in a doorway, watching with big eyes as
Quoyle, Bunny astride his back,  around the parlor on all fours,  like a crazed boar
The kids are squealing, delighted, making excited little runs at him, swatting him with throw pillows and rolled-up sweaters
Thrill of the hunt
Wavey comes through the doorway, drying her hands, just behind where her boy sits
Quoyle doesn't see her, he's thrashing and bellowing, lost in the game
She watches, for a long beat
Then leans down to Herry
(a whisper) Go on
Get the pig
Herry grins like the devil
Dashes off to   the prey, knocking them sprawling
Kids  on
Wavey's unseen smile
The start of something
'  - on Quoyle
He is happily washing a mountain of dishes and cups
So the Newfie drills another hole in the ice, aways off from the first one
Once again, the voice booms, to see Wavey beside him
She's drying what he washes
So he moves way down the ice
Drills another hole
Voice comes again,  ,
They don't look at each other
Poker-faced, just alike, working side by side
The Newfie looks around
Still nobody
Hollers,
'
Voice comes back,
He can't help but snort out a chuckle of his own
Sneaks a look over at her, and she
laughs out loud
Healthy
Sexy, even
But from the delay, he guesses
Heard it before, huh
She looks over at him
Her eyes dance a little
Sometimes, passion in performance
Beats the element of surprise
And he is lost in those eyes
Knows it's showing
Glances away to where
Bunny sits in a corner
Reading to a rapt Herry
You guys hungry
Shhh
'm teaching Herry to read
Just like  did Warren
Is he learnin'
Bunny looks over at him
He is so dumb
First is the teaching part
The learning comes later
Herry nods
Later
And out of the blue
Wavey
Now are the berries ready to pick
Quoyle looks over to the woman
But instead of Wavey, he sees , staring at him with slow predatory heat
Want to pick my berries, do you
Should  climb right up on this sink
And then, once more she is
Almost
Almost ready
You know, it's all about timing
Quoyle
Takes note
- Quoyle alone in the office, pretending to peck away at a story
Actually, he's looking
through the window
Where Jack Buggit, Tert Card, Billy Pretty and Nutbeem are all circling around a small, roughly-made boat, attached to its rented trailer
They are talking to each other in learned tones
Talmudic chat
And
in they come
First through the door
That's yer boat
Said it was
One question remains
Why
Is that
Yer boat
Uh-oh
He looks from one face to another
Even Billy is irritated
Nutbeem gazes down, embarrassed for him
Well
boat's a boa
It's a shit boat
Best thing, get rid of it some dark night
Quoyle can't believe this
Hot shame burns
Go hire Alvin Yark to build ya a sweet little rodney
This thing's a wallowing cockeyed bastard that'll sink in a bathtub
And standing in the doorway, the scariest sight of all
The boss
Just shaking his head
(sadly) You don't have the sense God gave a doughnut, do ya
The word from Sinai on Quoyle's worth
pity
'm goin' fishin'
Out the door with a
Quoyle stares hopelessly after him
Don't jump off a bridge over it
Anyone can make a brainless, asinine, devastatingly revealing blunder
(actually means this) Thanks
What in th' furry pit of Newfie hell
Is this
Holds up some sheets of paper
Photos of the Melvilles' botterjacht
Reads
Hitler's Barge
That goes with the shipping news
Profile of a vessel in port
What about the car accident
That's the one  didn't do
Mrs
Diddolate sprained her wrist
Period
Card still reading
So you didn't do the one Jack told yer to do, and you did one he don't know yer did
Silence
Pretty mu
This copy
Is worse
Than yer boat
He looks up
Equal parts disgust and delight
Jack even sniffs this, he cuts you up fer lobster bait
've half a mind to run it
Quoyle straightens his spine
Run it
Strides off for the door
Turns back
As for the part about you havin' half a mind
No comment
Out the door
harder than Jack's
- Quoyle stumbling toward his wagon with vacant eyes
(
) Headline
Reporter Disembowels Self With Rusty Joke
- Quoyle in a carpenter's belt, climbing very carefully from a ladder onto the roof
His vertigo apparent as he keeps to his hands and knees, trying to fight the compulsion to look down
Gives in to it, peering from the corner of his eye down the cliff, the rocks, the sea so far below
Not a good 1dea
Comes to the shingles
Eases his way into a fearful crouch
Okay
Starts hammering
And rehearsing
Jack,  completely understand, would fire me, too
Nodding, in time to the hammer strokes
In a heartbeat
Hammers , speaking in rhythm
You give me a chance, and what happens
buy the wrong boat, write the wrong story,  am the lowest form of alleged life
In fact, your comment
Stops
was an insult to the doughnut
Hear now what the hammering had masked
Someone is reaching the top of the ladder, climbing onto the roof
Bunny
Somehow she has managed to climb while carrying a sandwich on a plate
And an open bottle of soda
He stares at her, uncomprehending
Egg salad and Nehi grape
She sets them down
Stands  on the steep pitch
(shocked stupid) Baby
They're mine but 'll share
As the plate and bottle slip neatly  the roof and, after a noticeable beat, shatter softly far below
Bunny's turn to be shocked
She's contemplating going after them
'
Okay, that was a little loud
It has also scared the kid out of her wits
Quoyle regrets this
Starts scooching awkwardly down the slope, inches at a time
(too casual) We're gonna play Wait For Daddy
Can you play that
She's just staring over the side
Hypnotized by the sight
He's slipping toward her
Toward the edge
And if you don't move
Until get there
Then
Closer, reaching toward her back
then you win
her arm, she , violently , but he her to him
Holds her to his heart
Holds her
He is breathing like a freight train
That
Was so easy
- Jack Buggit enters with energy
Looks around
Billy's typing, Nutbeem's reading
Quoyle is cleaning out his desk, pulling things off his little shelf to pack away
Goofy photo of Bunny
Ceramic child-made three-legged turtle
Tiny padded box with what looks to be carefully-preserved empty eggshells
Jack heads toward him
Did ya see the Hitler's barge piece, Jocko
saw it
And heard from some who'd done the same
(to Quoyle) Good
Neatness
Quoyle turns
Pretty much all his possessions are in a big cardboard box
Jack peers into it
Reorganize
Start over
Good thinking
But he's smiling
Like he's got the point
Thing about the barge piece just thought it'd perk up th
Got six phone calls 'bout that piece
Six
That'd be like half a million calls in Toronto
Grasps Quoyle around the back of the neck
People liked it, old son
Crowd went down to the dock t'see the thing, but it'd already pulled out
Quoyle stares, slack-faced into the elfin eyes
Course you don't know anything about boats, but that's entertaining, too
So go ahead with it
That's the kinda stuff  want, see
Just now, Card's jaw is scraping his boot tops
From now on, you write a column every week
The Shipping News
Gonna order you a computer and everything
And y'know the beauty part
Quoyle doesn't
don't have to tell Card all over again, cause he's already eavesdroppin'
So 'm free to take m'leave
Goin' fishin'
Ah
You've an instinct for character and idiosyncrasy, old son
wink
He heads toward the door
And never looking at him
Zip yer fly, Card
Card looks down
He zips up, as the door slams
Billy Pretty sends Quoyle a thumbs-up, without turning
Nutbeem clasps his hands above his head, like a winning prizefighter
Quoyle slides a sheet of paper into his typewriter
Stares at it
(
) Thirty-eight years
First time anybody said you done it right
'  - woman looks up from her stitching
She is solidly built, pushing 60, Emily Dickinson hair
cheerful, calmly butch way about her
Trustworthy eyes
Nephew, this is Mavis Bangs
real professional
Mavis holds out a hearty hand
Agnis is showing him the shop cutting table, two sewing stations
Billowing sailcloth hung over the windows
Racks of leathers and fabrics
And this is Dawn Budgel
She's a vegetarian
Dawn, once described by Agnis as young and on the sexy side, is that
Red lipstick and nails
Her eyes float up in a way that suggests reflexive sensuality
Agnis nods to her, and the girl reaches a slender pale hand
Agnis is always saying such
things about you
It's nice to fit a man
With the name
And as she releases his hand, her eyes flick to Agnis
Some conspiracy there
Quoyle follows his aunt back to the big cutting table
just, uh, came to see if you'd heard abou
Silver Melville
Snuck off in the night, they did
Not a penny paid for all we done
Shows him sheets of baby blue leather
We'd installed the banquettes in her salon
Three of the chairs done and delivered, three to go
Points to them
neat row by the makeshift kitchenette
That's
That's just terrible
But Agnis is thinking
Strange
Leavin' the chairs
And as he glances off, he sees Dawn across the way
Her skirt hiked up, as if she were adjusting a stocking
She isn't wearing any
- Billowy clouds frame a languid , silver and sleek, darting this way and that
Graceful, in command of the currents
(
) See her now, seated atop a grassy slope
It is she who holds the string, and her boy is way down at the bottom of the hill with Bunny
Blue jumper billowing, the girl is teaching him how to make necklaces from wildflowers and garbage bag twisty-ties
Herry and the naked Barbies watch with great attention
The learning will come later
On this he looks up
Serious
'
slightly to reveal that Quoyle has been sitting right beside her all along
He holds the string of a big, glum kite that hangs motionless in space with barely a flutter
As she watches the kids, he stares at her, fixedly deciding whether to ask
(barely audible) Do you think Bunny's
Strange
Wavey looks over
Sees that he's worried half to death
In New York
They said she had a
personality disorder
(softly) And it was named Petal
Do you understand that
All these hallucin
The White Dog
Sometimes with the Skinny Ghost
Kids do things like that, it's called imagination
Like the necklaces
The necklaces, yeh
thought that frightens him
You know how many she makes
She does
It's a skill, she's proud of it
And she brings her dolls along
And she looks good in blue
And she wears a key for a good luck charm
Her kind smile
No big deal
And she's saving her mother a room
Did she tell you that
Wavey's slow nod
She talks to her at night
can hear through the door
Very quiet now
The wind
The kites
You know how kids think
You have all those books
The ones  read to teach Herry
They don't make me an exp
(blurting) Just
Is she okay
That was naked
He swallows
mean
If you had to guess
Too serious a subject
Too good a woman
For an easy lie
That child is the only friend my son ever had
So she's strange, you bet
She swallows, too
Her eyes are damp
love that little girl
And  will see to it
That she's all right
Hold the look
And  don't have to guess about it
- Quoyle , huffing, through a bog with every color of berries imaginable
Around another bend in the path
Stops
Hands on his knees
Listens
Nothing
Shit
'  , ' More nothing
He trudges back the way he came
Peeks around a bend to see
Bunny is teaching Berry to pick gooseberries
This time, the learning has started
They are being very careful
If you pick enough, we can sell 'em for a thousand dollars
And give it to Aunt Agnis to make up for those Staties who didn't pay h
(means business) Then don't
Slow us
Down
Quoyle  his hands across his mouth
Sorry
He tiptoes off
Rounds a bend
Walking faster now
Around another bend
And stops
Hold on his face to take his view of
Petal, kneeling in a flimsy sundress, picking berries
Barefoot, her skirt hiked up, stained with berry juice
And when she turns to him
she is still Petal
Her face is beautiful, and filled with tender desire
She looks at him the way he has always dreamed she would
He goes to
kneel beside her
Touch her waist
And now she is
another woman
His hand is on Wavey's waist, and it comes slowly away
But her eyes are locked to his
Making her choice
(very soft) Look
like you
Even in kindness, he can smell rejection
He starts to back away, but she takes his hand
Holds it
want us
To be friends, okay
He nods, dumbly
Of course
Okay
And friends
Need
To understand each other
(so sorry) understand
Believe m
My husband drowned
Herry was
Hard for her
He quiets
He was two months old
And Herold took the boat out
Overnight
To fish for haddock
Do you understand
Because  liked
Haddock
Silence
It's four years
She stares in his eyes
And it's yesterday
No smile
Now, did  blow it
Or can you still be my friend
beat
Quoyle nods, sure
'll be your friend
But what she sees is a lifetime of being Quoyle washing past his eyes
It makes her murmur
What
What are you thinking
And from his heart
'm thinking 'm sorry
For everything
He stands up
him stumble off
on her
- grassy place above an empty sea
The rest of the world far away
Two figures climb the gentle hill
How're you doin' with the Tall and Quiet Woman
Cindy Crawford and me is doin' fine
meant Wavey Prowse
Oh
My dad used to say there's four women in every man's life
The Stouthearted Woman
Oh, that'd be Agnis
the Maid in the Meadow
(has to think) Bunny  guess
Weavin' a daisy-chain necklace
the Tall and Quiet Woman
Well
She does have that posture goin'
and the Demon Lover
On this
Quoyle's smile fades
He looks away
They've reached a fence where blunt pickets enclose crosses and wooden markers, many fallen on the ground
(wistful) Me dad said that
Billy finds the right marker
Sets his satchel onto the grass
Kneels
His old fingers clear debris from painted words: 1897 - 1944
, That's me poor father
Thirteen was when he died
He hears the thread of feeling in his simple words
And says no more
Withdraws two cans of paint from his bag
One white, one black
Two brushes
Lays them out carefully, for this task is sacred
Every time  wonder
Is this the last coat
Pries the lid off the tin of black
And when he sees Quoyle's eyes
Well, there's no one else to do it, y'see
(straight back) There is now
An easy smile
Stating the obvious
There's me
The old man's face just stops
The eyes sharpen
Into a question
Well, you said
There's no one else
As if that were enough
Hey
If you wanna rest next to him
'll paint yours at the same time
No extra trouble
Billy stares at him
Stares at him
Clears his throat, gruffly
Then better get Alvin Yark
'build yer a real boat
So yer'll be around
- Quoyle exits the house, pulling on his jacket, and
stops
Something laid across his threshold
long piece of has been placed there
tied evenly along its length
He glances back up to the second floor, thinking Bunny
Looks at the thing again
Neat work
Odd
Slips it in his pocket
- Quoyle now making his way down a steep primitive trail through lush vegetation
The green house is far above him
The shimmering bay now just below
This way down as treacherous as it is wondrous, and Quoyle  in the tangle and wet, half-slides through wild angelica stalks and patches of dogberry, suddenly
his balance,  roughly down a stretch, rolling, grasping a spruce trunk
Pulling himself to his feet, he hears
Looks up, just as
a   appears through the bushes
Red eyes
Lips curled back
frozen second of mutual indecision, and Quoyle
and falls on his butt
The dog
, bounding down a path we hadn't noticed
Toward an upright
Who steps into sun just long enough to become
a , grizzled and scrawny and quick
Gone in a flash
Like a skinny ghost
And there, on his butt
Quoyle laughs softly
How 'bout that
Murmurs
Attaway, girl
You're smarter'n all of us
As he climbs to his feet, he sees the rocky beach just below
Squints, as if at something that doesn't belong
We see it now
a , washed up onto a tangle of rocks, just offshore
Quoyle wading into the water
Up to his knees, slips, sinks to his waist
Stays upright
Snatches the suitcase from its perch
Brings it back to shore, holding it high
Already, he is making the face of someone smelling something he'd rather not
He sets it down
The face is worse
His curiosity running the show, he unhooks the latch
and stops
Because he's staring inside
Suddenly, he and  back, his leg  the case, and out tumbles onto the wet ground
the head
Of Bayonet Melville
'  - Three guys
Three beers
Five squidburgers (Quoyle likes his backups ready and waiting)
'know none a that impresses Jack Buggit
He's not one fer blatant ambition
Quoyle thinks better of his answer
Chomps a bite instead
Even if you don't recognize 'Human Head Packed in Satchel' as the most compelling piece ever to appear in
(snorts) Even if
takes his hand from his greasy burger
Scratches his crotch below the table
triple increase in ad revenue
Does get
The man's attention
And winks at the silent hero
Weren't even double if yer figger it right
(to Quoyle) Point is
real reporter woulda named the obvious suspect
More obvious
Than the wife
Yer aunt, ya thick Statie lardface dumbass
Quoyle
And Nutbeem
Just look at each other
She gets stiffed by the guy, after basin' her new shop on that revenue
And she ain't one ta fool with
Capable a anything, that woman
(angry now) Okay, where's the wife
Agnis kill her too
Okay, where's this week's shipping news
Or you gonna rest on yer Crisco-coated laurels
Quoyle viciously  into his squidburger
Uh-oh
The way he's chewin', he ain't a fat boy t'be trifled with
(quietly) His piece
Is about oil tankers
Card blinks
Looks at Quoyle with, dare we say, new respect
Hope fer ya yet
Now that's news, the McGonigle oil field
Petrodollars, a golden flood a jobs
That's th'future a this god-forsaken ice rock
Civilization
Scratches his crotch savagely
To honor civilization
That's why those with half a brain already put our money where our mouths is
Puts his squidburger
Where his mouth is
Nutbeem clarifies for Quoyle
Two shares
Of Mobil

Bunny sits at the little table, a large mixing bowl filled with popcorn before her, little Herry at her side
They are watching Freakazoid on a tiny
Bunny shovels in a mouthful of popcorn
Then makes a sage, if unintelligible, comment about the show to Herry
Still chewing, she takes another huge handful of popcorn
Herry opens his mouth like a baby bird
Bunny stuffs the snack in
It's a stare-and-chew, side by side
Just alike
cozy parlor
Quoyle sits in a Barca-lounger with a huge bowl of chips in his lap
He is watching hockey on a modest , the action is fierce
Stuffs his mouth full of chips, yet somehow manages to say
so there they were, this goofy old codger and his dog, big as life
to see Wavey now
Curled on the sofa, under a lap robe
She is knitting something in a heavy oxblood-colored wool
He watches her work
(softly) That'd be old Nolan
He's actually your uncle, last of the crazy Quoyles
should have realized
Keeps her eyes on her work
Sad, really
Lives like a hermit in a run-down shack
No one to look after h
Here  was worried about Bunny night and day, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with her
silence
Which makes him uneasy
Her only problem is her dad worries too mu
(not looking up) You are a loving and wonderful father
You're not the problem
She meant to reassure him
Instead
So what is th
Nice to see you
Looks up with smoky eyes
after all this time
Oh
Well
've been workin' longer hours
So Dennis and Beety were kind enough to bring Bunny to the daycare
Fed her a lotta meals, too
They're real friends
Quoyle's smile tries to sell the innocence of his absence
(very quiet) thought you forgot
That 'm your friend, too
No smile from her
She wants him to know she was hurt
He shakes his head, serious now
No,  didn't forget
You want another sandwich
There's roast pork
He holds up what's left of his four-decker
This is plenty
Takes a huge bite to show how much he likes it
You said
You'd read me your article
He did, he nods
But just now he's scared to
And so she smiles
Which traps him
He pulls out a single sheet of paper
Clears his throat
Nobody Hangs a Picture of an Oil Tanker
That's the header
She nods
Likes that
He gestures, go back to your knitting
So she smiles, slyly
And commences to knit
(reads) There's a 1904 photo hung in the library
Eight schooners heading out to fishing grounds, sails spread it like white wings
Beautiful
Beyond compare
This means something to him
Hear it in his voice
(reads) More common today is the low black profile of oil tankers
Like the ruptured Golden Goose, which last week bled 14,000 tons of crude onto seabirds, fish and boats at Cape Despond
He stops
As if revisiting that little thought in his mind
(reads) There will be more and more tankers
They will grow old and corroded, and their tanks will split
They have already done to fishing
What their spill has done to fish
He sneaks a glance
She has never looked up
(reads) Nobody hangs a picture of an oil tanker
On their wall
Silence
full one
Well
Whatcha think
She reflects
think when Card sees it, he'll split a gut
think he'll sit up nights thinking of cheap shots to pay you back
think he'll never stop until you're fired
Quoyle keeps nodding at each point
Yep
Yep
think  haven't been so proud
Of a friend
Since  don't know when
Quoyle's heart explodes in his chest
And shines in his eyes
There is a long silence
(softly) Maybe another sandwich
There's roast pork
He swallows
He just doesn't want to cry from happiness
Well, sure
- on Card
Who is  the single page in half
Then again
And again
And again
See Quoyle now, standing at the desk like a statue
Billy and Nutbeem at their stations, watching as Card
flutters the pieces down onto his desk
Like falling snow
Oh, 'll run it
Just easier t'copy edit
When yer can move th'pieces around
hush
frozen tableau in this room
Run it
Like  wrote it
How does this suit yer, Quoyle
'll do my job
You do yers, which means a four-vehicle pile-up south a Killick-Claw
And don't ferget the camera
He slides the battered camera across the desk
They glare at each other a full beat
Card belches, softly
Quoyle takes the camera, heads for the door
fergot somethin'
Quoyle turns
Card doesn't
You pinko Greepeace sack a quivering pigfat
Thinks
Did  leave out moosebutt-ugly
(nods to himself) You may go
on him
Making a neat little pile of the torn pieces
(
) Like  wrote it
Across the room, Nutbeem stands
Takes his cigarettes
Passing Card's desk, on the way out
Tough love
Impressive
Card shoots Billy a challenging look
You got something to say
hope you get him fired
Do you
So  can watch him beat yer to jelly
Just turns around
Flicks  his computer
Back to work
- Bunny jumping out of the wagon, running to the house
As Quoyle locks his car
(
) Why'd you leave the house open
He looks up
She is pushing the front door with one finger
It swings
Can  keep the necklace
and lifts a long piece of
There are  neatly tied along its length
Quoyle stares
Stares
(calm) Sweetie
Come sit in the car
- Quoyle climbing the stairs in fading light
He carries a tire iron
Stops midway
Listens to the silence
' , Up, up, to the top
Looking down the empty hall to see
knotted twine
At every door
- Quoyle enters, haggard and distracted
The place is lit, but empty
toilet
From the loo, appears
'tell me
Yer fancy it
Nodding toward something behind Quoyle
Turning, we see that hanging over Card's desk is an oversized framed photo of: - '
Quoyle stares blankly
Like  said
Nobody hangs those
Card just goes to the fresh stack of newspapers on his desk
Hands one toward Quoyle
Yer column's front page stuff
Only now, it's more like a caption, is all
photo of the same tanker
That hangs on Card's wall
(reads) More than 3000 tankers proudly ride the world's seas
Even the biggest take advantage of Newfoundland's deep- water ports and refineries
Spelled everthin' perfect
So as not t'embarrass yer
(reading) Oil and Newfoundland go together like ham and eggs, and like ham and eggs they'll nourish us in the coming years
Even put yer name on it
(finishes reading) Let's all hang a picture of an oil tanker
On our wall
Stares at the paper
In his hand
Man a yer principles
unnerstan' resignation is th'only honorable course
Quoyle looks up
Card flinches back
But all that comes is
How can a man resign
To nobody
Drops the paper on the floor
Steps on it, on his way toward the door
If yer off to see Jack Buggit, yer'll hafta swim some
Quoyle turns back
Yer can whine an' beg t'him
But runs his paper, every inch of it, every dirty time-eatin' job which he would have t'do without me
wink
An' if yer think he's gonna choose you over fishin'
yer not as smart as even you look
The cackle of the guy holding the straight flush
Me an' Jack
Has a sym-bi-otic relationship
Yer can look that up
Quoyle puts his hand on the door
know the word, Card
It means you two deserve each other
Out the door
It closes behind him
Card alone, crosses his arms in glee

hand reaches down toward a raspberry swirl, thinks better of it, moves thoughtfully along the selection to pluck a maple glaze, and bring it to
Quoyle's mouth
The box rests beside the cardboard carton into which Quoyle is packing his things
Nutbeem sits on the edge of the desk, nibbling a cruller
Billy is bringing three mugs of coffee
Looks like a going-away party
Through the glass of the only private office
Jack Buggit is talking
Card is not
Card stands now, strides to the door, flings it
Nutbeem taps Quoyle's shoulder with his pastry
They look to
So
This is what Jack and  think
He's looking straight in Quoyle's eyes
Defiant as ever
We wanna run Quoyle's oil spill piece b'cause controversy sells papers and papers sells ads
Sounds reasonable to me
Lives to needle this guy
Card keeps his laser gaze on Quoyle
And we're gonna let Quoyle have his head on these columns, up to 500 words
So he'll get his confidence up
Well, let's not go overboard
He's rather green doncha thi
But we wanna expand his responsi- bilities to boat crashes
There's maybe four a week
He'll need a raise
And need to be represented in the negotia
And
The oil tanker picture
Stays
Nutbeem's eyes
He mimes catching an arrow shot through his chest
Falls  the desk
(to Quoyle) All that clear
Quoyle looks him in the eyes
Starts putting his things back in his desk
One more thing
Hear the
(never looks up) Jack's gone fishing
- The sky threatens black
Quoyle picks his way across the rocks to his ungainly, much-maligned boat, as it bobs against the weathered dock
He crouches, and as he begins to untie it, his gaze drifts out toward the nearby point, and
something catches his eye
boulder in the shape of a great dog
And as he stares, there is something below it
Something in a cove protected from intrusion by a jagged ring of menacing rocks
it is a  in a yellow suit
His head under the surface as if looking for fish
Arms and legs spread out like a starfish, the body slides in and out of a small cave
Tugged by the sea like a top on a string
Quoyle stares in frozen shock
(
) Headline
Reporter Becomes Magnet For Dead Men
No way in past the pounding surf, the savage rocks
So Quoyle turns sharply
Squints across the bay
(
) What was my panic
He was already dead
Maybe  thought, in some dim way
into his boat,  the engine over
it in overdrive toward the town across the bay
(
) if it wasn't too late for him
It wouldn't be for Petal
out, toward the black sky
Racing to open sea where the chop  drastically
Closer
Closer
(
) Once  was past the shelter of the lee shore, and into the real wind
realized my mistake
clear of the point's protection, the wind  the tiny craft, swells coming
The boat , then  with cruel speed
Quoyle tries to swing the boat around, the propeller , the bow  violently,  down, the stern , the hull filling, swerving broadside just as the oncoming sea  with all its force, and the little boat
rolls , Quoyle suddenly  under water, limbs flailing in all directions
(
) Headline
Reporter Becomes Anchor Man
Quoyle's dad  him into the public pool, the youngster  like an anvil in a profusion of bubbles, and to Quoyle, struggling madly somehow to the surface, toward the overturned boat,  the stilled propeller shaft, which causes the bow to lift, the next wave turning the boat upright,  it with water, and it  forever, as Quoyle
once more beneath the surface, watching the boat into darkness below him
(
) Stupid
Stupid to drown with Bunny so young
No life jacket, no floating oar
No sense
Back to the surface,  for air
And then, daintily rowing a small boat, unaffected by the waves, her filmy dress rippling in light breeze
Look, it floats
Just like you
Is the lilting smile cruel
Or only the irony that conveys intimacy, even affection
Maybe it's filled with fat
And
In her place, bobs a red
plastic beer cooler
He  for it,  the handles, resting his chest on its top
The waves , mountainous now, and he rises and falls with them
He has been swept a mile from the nearest shore
a winch pulling part of the Geo, streaming mud, from swiftly flowing water
Police and bystanders gathered
(
) And  wondered
Am  going where she's gone
to the bay
barely-conscious Quoyle still clings somehow to the plastic cooler
But hours have passed
Light is fading
(
) and will  see her
He turns
And there she is
Beaming at him from the bow of her little rowboat, a smile ambiguous in the growing dusk
It could be love
From behind her a light , giving Petal the aspect of an angel
She drops a wink
away
And the light becomes
the  from a fishing boat
Quoyle squints his swollen eyes, as strong hands  him from his box
From the sea
voice warbles, distorted by wind and Quoyle's diminished consciousness
Jesus Cockadoodle Christ
knowed somebody was out here
Quoyle's teeth are chattering so hard, his body shivering so painfully, Buggit hauls him over the rail and lays him down on a wriggling mound of fish
Thank god fer yer figure, me old son
thin man woulda froze
Quoyle burrows into the fish, like nestling in a down comforter
Jack covers him with a heavy tarp
Crouches down close
Good
Yer lost th'boat
- Dim light
Quoyle stirs beneath the billowing down coverlet
His eyes flutter
Open
Where
(
, very soft) It's all right
You're in heaven
His head  around
She's sitting just beside the bed in half- shadow
Her oxblood knitting across her lap
Actually
It's just my bed
Now he sees the cigarette
Actually, it's not
just wanted to see your eyes bug out like that
Now he sees the smile
You don't smoke
His voice was a croak
So he  his throat with a massive and disgusting effort
It is gross and funny, and she smiles again
Only when 'm worried
don't worry much
He rolls over, to see her better
They are very close
You don't have to, 'm all right
'm in heaven
'm not worried
About you
Oh
As he draws a breath to ask
You're in the boys' room at Jack's house
Wonder how long since Dennis slept here
She glances to the nightstand
Beneath the dim lamp
picture of Jack and blond son Jesson
Guess what they're doing
Mrs
Buggit called, knew Bunny was still with me
The kids are camped out in the parlor
beat
Nice
You sittin' up with me
longer one
'okay
Someday you'll do somethin' nice for me
He nods
He will
Who you worried ab
You didn't find a second dead man
Just the rest of the first one
Ah
He nods
Well, that figures
asked
Who you worried about
On this, she stubs out her cigarette
Takes another from the pack
You said Bunny talks to Petal at night
You ever listen
He shakes his head
Not really
Wouldn't be right
Well, 'm not that nice a person
a match
She plays Petal
Talks to the Barbies, like Petal talking to her
Brings her cigarette
To the flame
She says she's sorry she left them
It was just to see if they could be good girls
And they were
And
and she loves them
His eyes at once rapt and suffering
She watches that
The Barbies look better naked, Bunny looks good in blue, guess who said that
Draws on her smoke
So we talked
Just before Petal left her with that
stranger
Bunny had snapped her mom's bead necklace
That's why she's making more
Do you understand
When she's made enough
She'll be forgiven
Tears are pooling in his eyes
Hers, too
She keeps going
She saves Petal a room at the house, but she's also got the key to the old place
In case her mom would rather go there
thin stream of air escapes from his lips
And she talked about it
Just like that
Sure,  lied
said nice things about her mother
Bitter smile
See, there's only one problem
Petal isn't gone
Quoyle thinking
Madly
What can he do
So we're patient
And we wait, and we're good to her
(beat) And
Maybe
Time
She stares back
Unease to match his own
Maybe time
'   - wiry wisp of an aged elf,   is shaping the center beam of what will become a tidy boat
Its wooden skeleton across two sawhorses in his spacious workshop
(sings softly to himself) Oh, the Gandy Goose, it ain't no use
It ain't no use, the Gandy Goose
Quoyle, Wavey and Dennis stand in a row
Watching the little artisan shave wood as if his tools were his hands
(keeps singing, as if alone) The Gandy Goose, she ain't no uuuuse
Cause all her nuts'n bolts is loose
Wavey can't help but smile
She really likes the old duck
(never turning) See, 'm already buildin' yers in me mind
The singin' helps that
But
Gotta take a walk in the woods, find a spruce with jest th' right curve fer yer stem
And says no more
Keeps working
They are like acolytes at the feet of a guru who never bothers even to glance their way
Well, hurry up
Thirty, forty years 'll be rarin' to get back out on the water
Everyone smiles
Except the guru
Gotta build her solid
Who knows, mebbe Jack Buggit'll give his fishin' license to his boy
So next time, won't be nobody to pull yer out
(real quiet) Jack Buggit's boy is drowned
Everyone looks
Except the guru
(cheery) Dennis
'hear the one about the Newfie who lived ferever
beat
No sir
His kid never got a fishin' license
Now he turns
maritime Yoda, squinting to discern if his message is received
What we wait fer
She's like the main stem
Gives us our shape, doncha see
He runs his hand along the backbone of the boat he's building
Death's one shape
Fergiveness is another
Crinkly old eyes, laser bright
Dennis isn't angry
Just resolved
Thing 'bout waitin' on fergiveness
Mixes up who's waitin' on who
No smile, no spin
Just the truth
Death is simpler
An' a lot shorter wait
In the silence
door opens
(
) Mr
Quoyle
sprightly bird-like woman
Wears apology and concern
The school is callin'
It's about yer daughter
' The  is spare, dressed for England, her voice authoritarian by its pace, exaggerated diction, and lack of volume
not only pushed Mrs
Lumball
Not only pushed her very hard
Seated in a semi-circle around the desk of power
Quoyle, stricken, respectful
Wavey, already pissed off at the principal
And Bunny,her hat and coat on, arms folded, face crimson and set
She knocked
Her down
Do you understand the severity of this, Mr
Quoyle
And
Refuses to explain her act
Or
Apologize
Is that right, young lady
Under the circumstances
We have no choice but to suspend
Bunny looks down
Glaring an evil spell of death at her own kneecaps
(quietly) think Bunny and
Should take a walk
And stands
Uh
Wavey
If it's all the same to you
- Quoyle and Bunny alone, hand-in-hand, walking slow where they once picked berries
Nobody's talking
When you gonna ask
(calm) When you're in the mood
Apparently, that hasn't happened yet
More walking
She musta done something
Really bad
Said like he means it
Which he does
And Bunny, squinting up, sees that
the crime
Playground filled with kids
Bunny and girlfriends on the jungle gym
Bunny the best, a natural jock
large, sour, doughy, and betrayed by life, stands with her silver whistle in the midst of chaos
Her thoughts on a higher plane
(
) She's the worst one of all
Little Herry Prowse comes to tug at the teacher's wool coat
He is holding his crotch and jumping up and down
This does not require an advanced credential to interpret
(
) Herry told her he had to pee
But the way he talks
He could just say 'eeee,' like that
Mrs
Lumbull looks down
From her face as she responds, she has already devoted, over time, more professional attention to this troublemaker than should be asked of any dedicated educator
(
) She told him that recess was almost over, an' she wasn't gonna make a trip special, an' he could hold it
Herry, seemingly, disagrees
Still holding his crotch, he jumps up and down with greater agitation
She grabs him, rather roughly, by the arm
Marches him over to
(
) She made him stand against the wall
and walks off, pointedly ignoring him from ten feet away
He screams, pumping his fists in frustration
Grabs himself, suddenly
Whether or not we can see the dampness spread, we can see his humiliation all too clearly
As his tears come
a figure  into frame from behind Mrs
Lumbull
Hunched over like a linebacker, full speed ahead,  herself into the back of the large woman's knees
Her feet go , and the rest of her goes
like the proverbial amount of bricks
Herry's tears stop fast
Watching the woman shriek, and keep shrieking
Makes him laugh
the berry path
They are sitting on a fallen log
See, a good dad would say hitting is always wrong
You coulda hurt her bad
guess you know that
She wasn't hurt for real
Just screamed like a baby
Quoyle pulls out a single Snickers bar
Wish 'd seen it
It really sounds funny
Petal'll think so, too
He looks at her
Nods, probably will
Peels the candy bar free of its wrapper
Well, there won't be any trouble at school
' take care of that
How
He breaks the candy bar in half
Tho not quite equally
Because the best thing about people
Is they can forgive each other heard that this morning
That teacher
Is gonna forgive me
He nods
Oh, yeh
That
And she won't want the story printed in the paper
Oh
Well
don't wanna forgive her
Me neither
He holds out the two pieces of candy
She takes them both
the bigger one in his mouth
As he chews
had to do it
'Cept for Wavey, 'm the only family Herry's got
She nibbles at her own piece
Like the ghost
Who's not a ghost
Hmmn
The one who ties the knots
You're the only family he's got
Right
Her father doesn't react
He's even stopped chewing
You said
And slowly
Quoyle nods
said
'  - Quoyle picks his way down to the battered boat shed, hidden at the foot of his cliff
He carries a big carton, which we see has made the journey slow and awkward
Across the gravel now, to
the door
the fire crackling, see the smoke curling
Takes a breath
Knocks softly
Then
No answer
Juggle the box, lift the latch
Enter
'  - The old man and the dog huddled together at the fire
They look over with red eyes
Just alike
Only one growls
Quoyle finds a smile, a soft voice
Uncle
My daughter Bunny and
We got you some hot bread
And some meat
Some dried fish
Some squash and vegetables
a cake
some warm clothes
Nolan is listening
Sharp-eared, sharp-eyed
What trick is this
So Quoyle sets the carton down in the squalor
Takes out a loaf of fresh bread
One step forward
Lay it down
Good faith offering
And
Nolan scuttles to it
Like a wary crab
He tears off a chunk of bread
Nibbles
He likes it
And as he eats
(softly) You tied those knots, huh
At my house
crouches down to the old man's size
Almost close enough to touch
Ain't yer house, it's th' Ouoyle house
He's found the meat
Ripped off a chunk
See,  am Qu
Old ones
Got run outta Omaloor Bay a hunnerd years ago
Dragged that house across th' ice
On spruce runners
Stuffs some into his face
Like this, even better
Hadda lash it to th' rock
She'll tell yer
She
Course she never come t'see me
That's obvious why
And as Quoyle draws a breath to ask
Your Aunt Agnis Hamm, me son
That's cause she can't face me
knows she killed 'im
moment
Of stone silence
Him
That baby she was carryin'
What was she t'do
She wuz only 12
An' it was her own brother what done 'er
Quoyle's wide-eyed shock
(numb) Her own
a tiny frozen pond
Long ago
girl of 12, rawboned, husky, skating alone
We've seen her, in the photo at Quoyle's dad's house
And as she skates, she looks up to see
a boy of 15, stocky, sullen
He was in the same photo
Only now, he steps onto the ice
Unbuttons his pants
Begins to slide toward her on the soles of his fishing boots
She looks around
Snow banked on all sides of the pond
Nowhere to run on her skates
(
) Her brother, me son
She only had th' one
The girl, breathless, skating this way and that
The boy closing in, cutting off her angle
deadly endgame
There are no words
And
he is  her
Pulling her  to the ice in -
No sound but their hot breath, the grunt of the struggle, and to
Course no one alive knows no more
So her an' me
(winks) Our
Little
Secret
'  , - - Agnis and Mavis are showing Wavey their new shop
It is big and bright with more elaborate fittings, the amount of work piled up carries the scent of success
Quoyle trails behind, as Agnis dotes on Wavey like a prize new daughter-in-law
When she turns, she sees her nephew staring
What
My hem crooked
As if was wearin' a hem
He was staring pretty intently
Realizes that
Naw,  just come from seein' your cousin Nolan
Guess  was thinkin' about him
She holds his gaze with her own
Is she wondering
Mr
Quoyle
What do you think of my dress
Everybody turns on that one
Mavis cuts her alter ego Agnis a look
Can you believe this slut
wore it just for you
She actually looks pretty good in it
Wavey noticing that
Watching Quoyle say
That was more consideration
Than deserve
Polite banter
Or outright flirting
Hard to tell if it's Wavey or Agnis who disapproves more
Dawn ignores them
Did your aunt tell you about all the money
Agnis just blinks
Can scarcely believe she heard that
Agnis told us it came from Macau
(quietly) Hush yoursel
from Silver Melville
And it was more than she expected
And we shipped the chairs off to her
' know, the three remaining
really frozen beat
(casual, to Agnis) Uh
Why would she send you more tha
(to Dawn) Do you have enough attention now, young lady
Yes, Ma'am,  think so
Mavis echoes Agnis' glare
(really casual) Macau, huh
So
That where y'sent th' chairs
Agnis turns
Sizes him up
It's flatterin' you showin' me how you've turned into such a competent reporter and all
But even if remembered where  sent 'em couldn't tell ya
Puts her fingers to her lips
Leans closer, to confide something he is obviously unaware of
Professional ethics
'  - on Wavey, cooking flapjacks
Talking to them
Only you
Could do this
And she's not pleased
You fed him
You gave him clothes
You're the first human ever was kind to him
She scoops them expertly into a stack
Accordingly
You're sick with guilt
Serves them to
You sure you're not a complex guy
Quoyle, who nods absently
About the one thing he is sure of
Just now, he's examining the prodigious status of her oxblood knitting
Still attached to the needles, it looks too broad for a muffler
(decides) Horse blanket
(ah
) That's what that is
beat
Another
So if y'called around
Musta found somepla
(quietly) One decent golden age home
It's in St
John's
You can maybe afford it, tho God knows why you should
She pushes the flapjacks closer to him,  down the fork, eat
She's exasperated
Thinks he's wasting his money
can't put him there, til  go down to St
John's
See it's all right
Great
Let's not be rash
Come with me
And everything
Sorta
Stops
mean, the kids could stay with Dennis and Beety
Or Agnis, or
meaningful beat
Why
Would
Do that
She looks deep in his eyes
Hard to guess the answer she wants to hear
He clears his throat
Looks down
Well
Remember when you said
Someday, 'd do something nice for you
And when he looks to her, she is
(Wavey's voice) And this is it
witheringly sexy smile
Hey
Overnight trip to St
John's
All expenses paid
Petal arches a delicate brow
(Wavey's voice) Overnight
He blinks
And sees
What's wrong with a weekend
With a playful smile
Of her own
- ,
' - Not London, but it might as well be
Wavey and Quoyle atop a red double-decker bus, wind whipping their hair
She is watching the big city flow past, drinking every inch of it
He's watching her
- Wavey carries an armload of little girl's tights and corduroy pants, picking through a bin of barrettes
Quoyle appears with a fistful of neckties
Holds them up hopefully to his chest one at a time, each more breathtakingly godawful than the last
Well
She with disgust
Lifts from her shopping bag a nice conser- vative one she's already picked for him
He , just as she did
They share the trace of a grin, just alike
He walks off
Wavey trying on furry hats in a full-length mirror, as Quoyle keeps feeding her an endless supply from a double armful
She pouts and poses like a runway model, basically frowning that the hats aren't working
He's staring at her as if nothing else exists in the universe
She knows it
Wavey alone at a cash register
The checker is ringing up a selection of lacy bras and panties
Suddenly, Wavey looks up to see Quoyle at the register one aisle over, staring fixedly at her purchases
Seeing she's noticed him, he holds up a huge pair of loud boxer shorts he's buying, and  them at her
She laughs and waves her bras right back
Civilians watching think they're in love
/
' - / Quoyle and Wavey stroll the grounds of Nolan's future retirement home
It is twilight, and the modest place looks pleasant and welcoming
Quoyle listens earnestly, as the director points things out
Wavey watching Quoyle, her gaze not so disapproving after all
on Quoyle with a bowling ball, poised, glaring our way
Here he comes
Stumbles
Lets go
to see the ball rolling, rolling real slow
Quoyle turns his back, strides away with confidence like he doesn't even have to watch, this is too easy
Wavey points, look
He turns in time to see two pins fall
Pumps his fist
- It's late
It's dim
It's as romantic as urban Newfoundland will ever get
Our couple nursing beers at the corner table of a passably stylish bar
Piano playing show tunes, but soft
He pulls from his pocket
a travel brochure
Slightly drunk, completely merry, almost wicked smile
Now, listen to this for t'morrow
After  sign the papers at the home
She's already grinning
Feels so comfortable
(reads) The answer to your annual outing
Rainbow trout fishing in four ponds
You pay for what you catch
Prizes in the ponds
If it drizzles or gets chilly, heated and lighted building available, right next to the ponds, with soft drinks, candy bars, ice cream and chips
His subtle smile
guy could get used to this irony stuff
Or we could sleep in
innocent, natural
At some primal level, his panic begins
just feel so guilty about all your expenses
Two separate rooms
Both so big
Hey, it's my treat
You agreed
She nods
She did
Still
Seems like we could figure out
Something
Even Quoyle
Has the message
He looks down at his beer, as he thinks about what he should say
Turns the glass in his fingers
friend told me once
Love is the only thing that counts
He nods
Almost to himself
(a murmur) It's the engine of life
He looks up
Her eyes are waiting
So when you told me how you think about your husband
really understood, becau
That's what  wanted us to talk abou
because real love
Just comes once
And everything
Stops
See, you know some of the stories about Petal
Some of the bad things
What you don't know
But she's looking in his eyes
And so, she does
(just above a whisper) is how much you love her
That's what it is
Even tho
She never loved you
beat
Sorta
Because of it
He sighs
The most miserable and the most honest he has ever been
All at once
See, love
Isn't about what's good for you
Isn't about what you wish it was
Isn't about what
would make you happy
His eyes are swimming
Can she possibly hear this
Love
Is about want
What you really want
And you can't change that
Even if it's poison
Silence
The piano plays something gay and stupid
So that's why it's great
To have a real friend
When you're
Lonely
The last word was a tough one
It makes her nod
She stares in his eyes for the longest time
And when she speaks, he can scarely hear her voice
know you have to stay tomorrow
To sign the papers
But
But
One word
And even a stupid guy
Gets it all
should be heading back
Before Herry
Misses me
Too much
Wow
He nods, dumbly
Watching his worst nightmare unfold before his eyes
And 'm not feeling so well
What  get for mixing vodka and beer, huh
She gets to her feet
She does seem a little unsteady
So 'll grab a taxi
You stay and finish
Listen to the music
Is that all right
cou
But he stops
Because she's shaken her head once
Don't
And don't worry
'm still your friend
Her voice chokes a little on that
She shakes her head, half- grinning at how foolish she feels
She smiles at him now
Like she means it
And leaves
Without another word
(
) She did stay my friend
In her way
Even tho, for awhile, we didn't see each other a lot
He wants to cry
He wants to be sick
He doesn't know what he wants
Fumbles in his pocket for some wadded-up bills
(
) Funny
How one little talk
Can change everything
'  - The boys, the beers, the squidburgers
The usual
Tell me about it
Just get the aunt's house fixed perfect, and gotta move
Move
Three hours to drive from the Point, with all the ice
Alvin won't have my boat ready til New Years
Agnis can stay over her shop
Bunny and have to find a room in town
Stay with us
My kid follows yours around, they'll bunk t'gether
And we gotta fluffy couch that's more'n you deserve
good friend
Quoyle is touched
Hopin' you'd offer, almost worth it just t'inconvenience ya
Unfortunately, 'm too fond a yer wife
(casual) Take my trailer
Timing's perfect
The way he said that
They both turn
shrug
It's two years
My boat's ready
If  stay any longer, 'll begin to like it here
Wouldn't want that
Very silent at this table
Against the din of the place
Is he serious
(softly) 'm throwing myself a farewell party on Saturday
Departure to follow Sunday
Regrets, soon after, no doubt
And smiles
Serious as a heart attack
long beat
(a murmur) Be careful
Careful
Last friend left me
Turned into a truck driver
So much feeling behind his eyes
Nutbeem can only say
Well
With that warning
And return the feeling
With his own
/
'  - Quoyle  under the weight of cases of beer and cheap rum pulled from the back of his wagon
Plenty more to go
Staggers into
Nutbeem's   tiny, threadbare trailer
Every conceivable surface under stacks   of plastic-wrapped party platters of cold cuts, cheese and red-eyed   olives
Nutbeem is jamming beers into tubs of ice
Quoyle peers   into the teensy closet that is the only bathroom
What's the barrel for
it now
Half a sawed-off empty , with  stenciled in orange, fills the shower stall
'm British
bathe
Quoyle sends him a blank look
Perfect for th' chips
He gestures to thirty bags of potato chips, filling the kitchenette
It's coated with two kinds of scum
Soap
And mine
Works
We forgot to buy dip
- out a window at the line of  still arriving
We are immersed in the ungodly   of an all-gentleman's Newfie soiree, music pushed beyond the level of distortion, assorted grunts, squeals, unintelligible words, things breaking
As we struggle to look around
every square inch is    crammed tight with semi-conscious drunks
Tert Card and some boys    circle the potato chip barrel, which has become a handy urinal
Near the door, Dennis holding forth, arm tight around Quoyle who    listens, listens, chuckles
Then Quoyle fights his way
of the trailer, to cold night air where the party is wilder, given the elbow room
Quoyle steps  the supine form o Billy Pretty, who is singing to himself
Finds Jack Buggit with a beer in one hand a rum in the other
Wraps a drunken arm around Jack's neck
Starts to talk in his ear
Jack looks suspicious breaks out a few feet away
They don't notice
Closing in, to hear

Grins
That's pretty funny

This
Is even funnier

' Funniest yet
Jack is chuckling already

But Jack stares him dead in the eyes

At which point Jack   laughing fit to wet his pants

An idea that wins
Soused Nutbeem's eyes open bug-wide, as he is borne in a tidal wave of mayhem toward the docks
Whatever he is shrieking may well prove ineffective
And rather suddenly
Quoyle is left alone
Among the conscious, that is
'  - Knitted wool, the color of oxblood, lies across a timeworn leather ottoman
In front of it, little Herry dances a shuffle-foot jig of his own design
The music seeps from a venerable accordian, played earnestly by his serious mom, nodding and tapping her foot to the time of his steps
There is a feeling of empowerment and release in Herry
His grin splits his round face
His eyes say that his heart is dancing
through the window, past the porch, across the front yard
To a figure
By the fence
He stands motionless
Except his foot is tapping, very slightly, to the time of the music
We can't tell how much Quoyle sees
But his eyes say that his heart is drowning
'  - As Quoyle shuffles up, we see Nutbeem's trailer has been turned completely  onto its side
Walls are crushed and splintered
It's a train wreck
Sitting on the cinder blocks that once supported it, Nutbeem, and Dennis swig beers
(cheery) You're looking dishy,
Feeling that and more
What's the situation
Nutbeem hands him a beer
One
You're moving in with Dennis, no matter how fond you are of his wife
Quoyle looks sadly at the trailer
Realizing it was his place that got trashed
(laughs) And the boat
Omigod
'm some disgusted
With the human race
'da never made it, anyway
Storms would have blown me to bits
You boys saved my life
Yes, you did
The boys look at each other
Humiliated by his generosity
've gathered my savings, and am flying to Brazil
Where water is swimming pool green
And  grill yellowtail steaks with lime and garlic, watercress and Tobasco
Touch of curry
What
Quoyle is looking at him somewhat strangely
(light) collect friends who cook
Just can't keep 'em
Maybe too light not to be obvious
Billy looks from Quoyle to the trailer
And back
It's too bad
Which seems to cover everything
'  - Quoyle alone with Jack in open water
Pulling on a slicker, gloves, picking up a knife
Jack is pronging cod onto the deck
Hands might as well be movin' while we chat
Always hated th' sight a grown men around a table workin' nuthin' but their jaws
And so, together, they begin to clean a small mountain of cod
Editorial meetin', y'say
'Bout what
Well, Tert Card's gone, fer one thing
Doesn't look up
Yar,  know, he never said g'bye
Well, don't get all weepy-eyed about it, old son
Try t'be a man
Quoyle will
They called him from St
John's, he tells me
Wants him to help put out th' newsletter fer them oil rig suppliers
Yup
Believe it
He was sassy an' he was smug
Oh, there's a waitin' list, he assures me
They only skims th' cream
Well, don't get all weepy-eyed abou
Truth t'tell
was a wee help
'hind the scenes, doncha know
Keeps working
(quietly) Sometimes
Enough is enough
No arguments arise
Well, Billy'll do a helluva job
(nods) right where he is
Too old a fish t'swim faster'n be wants
Gotta find someone a little dumber t'take on a shit job like this
Uh-oh
You don't mean
Spot 'm in, Christmas and all
Might have to offer th'mess
To you
Quoyle swallows
Arguably the proudest moment of his life
Course
'd need a raise
Jack looks at him for the first time
real twinkle behind
'know
Yer do have the sense God gave a doughnut
(genuinely touched) ' try to live up to that
Said with such sincerity, Jack can only nod
Good
Any other outrageous demands
Seein' as yer got me over a barrel
Here's your one chance
And before he can stop his mouth
Well, your son
The mirth dies in his host's eyes
Like a 60-watt bulb in a brownout
Quoyle swallows the rest
You were sayin'
Quoyle sucks it up
His whole life would be changed
If he could come upon
fishing license
Jack's eyes
Flat and cold as the cod he's gutting
Well, there's only one a those issued per family
So how exactly would he do that
This is not
Going well
dangerous silence
Even doughnuts, y'know
Can push their luck
'  - The day care contingent more organized today
Sort of
Bunny leading a spirited round of red-light/green-light, as
Quoyle enters with a big cardboard box full of presents
As he shrugs off his coat, he looks at the Christmas tree, its winking lights
The decorations that seem to be everywhere, many handmade by these children
He watches Bunny call out 'Red Light
', only to have Herry ignore it and tackle her anyway
Mixed emotions, to be sure
feeling of family he can at least visit, yet will never be his own
The sad edge catches up with him, so he strolls on into
the kitchen
Wavey baking, what else
She smiles to see him
friend's smile
(Southern belle) Why, Mistuh Quoyle
You shouldn't have
He smiles back
Takes her in for a telling beat, before
Uh
didn't
Most of these are for Herry
Even better
There's two
Are yours
They are on top
Personally wrapped in his slightly bulging, fine-motor-control-challenged, personal style
Be sets them on the counter
You prob'ly want to wait for Christmas
Meaning, please don't
So she wipes her hands on her apron
Lets him see her eyes dance just a flicker
Oh, 'm much too excited
Delicately unwraps the first
Lifts out a  , finely painted with an assortment of
She holds it in her hands, at once admiring and wistful
Wondering if there's a message about their moment together while berry-picking
It's from a museum catalogue
But it's not real
It's a copy
(still gazing at it) It is my favorite teapot
simple pronouncement
She opens the second, flat and narrow
It is a
Actually, kind of stunning
She blinks, taken back by the beauty and perhaps the expense
It's nice for your eyes
thought
She doesn't sayanything
Lets it dangle from her fingers, catch the light
It's for everyday
You don't have to save it for special
She looks to him
Her eyes are shining maybe more than she wants
Her voice perhaps softer than she even intends
Oh, 'll save this, all right
Covers
With only a slightly more than friendly smile
And 'll think of you
When put lot on
He can only nod
He'd like that
She holds up one finger, wait a second
And hurries off
So he waits
Looking at her kitchen
Feeling his feelings
She is back, with two boxes
Sets them down
Nods, go ahead
one is heavy and square
He opens it to find a - He looks at her, smiles in his childlike way
Opens the case, which reveals
two leather-bound
One a dictionary
The other a thesaurus
He is obviously moved
(a murmur) You must have me mistaken
For a writer
And when he looks up
don't make mistakes
About that kind of thing
He stares at her long enough to make her nod toward the other package
Big and flat, but not heavy at all
He lifts the lid, and pulls out
a huge comfy
In oxblood wool
He is completely stunned to realize
(so pleased) Well, you can't be surprised
You've seen me knitting it for months
It was so big,  thought it was a tea cozy for your car
But if it's for me, it has to be bigger, huh
Put it on, put it on
So he slips it over his head
Big enough and then some
This worries her
She plucks at it
Well
You'll grow into it
You kiddin'
After the holidays, we'll have to stretch it
He's just beaming
Hugs himself to show how warm it is
The silence is companionable
Then
Not used to a woman
Giving me presents
She raises a brow
Can scarcely believe that
One Christmas with Petal,  gave her eleven things
And  wrapped them
And watched her open them up
She holds her friendly smile
But her eyes have changed
Slightly
She didn't have anything for me
Like every year
But this one time, she said, 'Wait a minute
' Wait a minute
She ran to the kitchen
heard the fridge open
She came back
With her hands hidden behind her
Then, she held out
Even his voice
Betrays the longing
Two brown eggs
She gave them to me from her own hands
They were cold
He smiles, self-conscious
Must sound really stupid
But they meant a lot to me
Silence
soft
Well
It's the thought that counts
He nods
He's glad she understands
broke 'em, careful
Made her an omelette with 'em
And  saved the shells
In a little box
She can't help but show her surprise at that
Oh, yeh
They're on a shelf behind my desk
At the paper
He looks worried now
Shouldn't have brought this up
And seeing this
know how it is
To hold onto something good
In the middle of all the bad
He nods
But feels truly awkward now
So
Well
gotta collect Bunny
Beety's gonna have supper waiting
Right
She nods
She understands this, too
Thank you
Thank you, very much
Takes her teapot and her bracelet
Holds them
gentle barrier
Her hands now too full for a hug
Well
Merry Christmas
With a wonderful smile
Merry Christmas
With one of her own
- Quoyle enters a packed auditorium, festooned for Christ's birthday with every trimming imaginable
Rough fishermen in black jackets they wear once a year, women in finery, schoolkids at their well- scrubbed best, antsy with anticipation
The  is audible, palpable
No Broadway opening could hope for this level of eagerness
As Quoyle comes down the aisle, we see faces we know
Boys from Nutbeem's party
Billy Pretty with Jack and Mrs
Buggit
Alvin Yark and his bird-like wife
The old-timer who sold Quoyle his boat
Mavis Bangs with an empty seat next to her, must be saved for Agnis
All the kids from daycare
Still, Quoyle searching for the face he doesn't find
And finally
to the third row, where Dennis and Beety have saved him a seat
Beety gives him a peck on the cheek, and he smiles, settling in, nervous as hell, just as
the school principal, still dressed for England, walks to the mike at center stage
Holds up her hands like the disciplinarian she prides herself on being, and they quiet pretty fast
Your friends and neighbors, and most of all, your children
Have worked hard to bring you the best pageant ever
applause, whistling, stamping
She is frustrated for a moment
Then, waves cheerily against the din, shouting
And  off-stage, as we   a
the Big Ugly Guy who led the raid on poor Nutbeem's boat stands in a threadworn suit bulging with his bulk, singing   in the sweetest tenor one could dream of
an audience, rapt, motionless
Pavarotti never had more respect
Bunny and Marty walk timidly to the front of the stage
Marty dressed in Christmas reds and greens
Bunny all in blue, which does look good on her
Kids   their names
The place falls quiet
And the girls begin to sing a plaintive West African in small brave voices that sometimes harmonize
It is unexpected and breathtakingly courageous
Two dads in the third row have tears flooding their eyes
(gruff whisper) Not bad, my kid, eh
(gruffer whisper) 'll say
She's as good as mine
Agnis Hamm walks out alone onto the stage, wearing a brown jersey, tweed skirt, yellow stockings and red slippers
She has an odd look on her face, all serious and curious
The laughter and calls die away to silence
Suddenly, one of her feet  at the stage, her arms become , and with a  and she metamorphoses into a   protecting an egg
The house comes  with laughter and  applause
Quoyle glances back at Mavis Bangs who puts her fingers between her teeth and in pure delight
Wavey Prowse walks onto the rear of the stage, in a long black smock, carrying her accordion
She turns to the wings, nods, and out comes little Herry clacking across the stage in tap shoes beat of silence
Mom calls out: , , , rolls into a savage hornpipe and Herry commences the  Quoyle once glimpsed through a window
Three hundred  coming  down in perfect rhythm and lift Herry into a joyous bouncing, rattling performance that builds in intensity until the finish
He runs to the edge of the stage, bows  from the waist, stands beaming in their applause
Then  offstage, his mom following with dignity, and we go with her into the wings
Once there, Wavey slips  of the smock, revealing to the dimness of the wings, that she is wearing dancer's tights over drop-dead legs
close-fitting tunic covered with sequins and glass bugles, crystal diamonds, and dozens more glittering baubles that send a shimmer of prisms with her every breath
Herry hands her a top hat, a cane, and
she  back onto the stage, her lithe body strutting and glinting
hush of stupefaction falls, only to be washed away by  and , the kind of which have not been heard since Gypsy Rose Lee startled her first roomful of rubes
In the bedlam
she  the top hat on one finger,  it up in a double somersault, catching it square on her head
She leans on her cane And when at last they quiet
We all know Billy Pretty's ways
Never save fifty cents, if you can save a dollar
She winks
They laugh
Billy laughing loudest
Well, last Feb'ry, Billy wants t'get his grandfather clock repaired
Calls old Leander Mesher
Local call
No charge
Twirls the cane recklessly
In the third row, a goggle-eyed Quoyle couldn't blink if he tried
Well, says Leander, the big cost is pickup and delivery
Got t'charge fifty dollars, each way
Two strong boys
Gasoline
Air in the tires
That's right
There's no cost for air in yer tires
, says Bill
Get wi' th'times, he's told
Tis called inflation
her eyebrows, Groucho-style
They are busting their guts laughing
Connoisseurs of wit
Billy lives at the top of the hill, Leander at the bot tom, doncha know
So Billy gets a rope,  the grandfather  on his back
And muttering the words fifty bucks
She puts her toe out,  wildly, windmilling her arms, pantomiming as she bends double under the phantom clock
Mite slick
Four feet thick a ice
Tears are streaming from a hundred eyes and more
Meanwhile, at the bottom, Auntie Fizzard, 91 years young, sets out in her non-slip galoshes and her cane with the rubber tip
Didn't yer, dearie
Bows to the old gal in the front row, who is scarlet-faced in hysterics, as all around her applaud
Wavey becomes her, inching along, casting fierce glances right and left to warn the world
Meanwhile, at the top
She is Billy once more, beneath his burden, her long legs stutter- stepping to one side, then the other, slipping, skidding, the howling all around her threatening to shatter walls, and
he goes, clock-side down, and '
Miming the wild ride as they
eight blocks, , missing everything like a miracle, zeroing in on
She becomes Auntie Fizzard once more, shuffling, looking left, right, and suddenly up -
'er inta the snow bank
Nods sadly
Leaning on her cane
When at last they quiet
Just two galoshes stickin' outta the snow
She digs 'er way out
Brushes herself off
Looks at him sprawled like a turtle on his back, tied to his massive burden
She says
She says
Levels a dead-eyed killer gaze
' '
The place comes  like a house of cards
Bedlam surrounds Quoyle who sits still as a stone
Too dazzled to breathe
-
Lonely stretch of wooded road, middle of nowhere
Light snow just starting to fall
truck pulls up beneath a tree
Out climbs
Wavey
Looking grim, walking slow
Crosses the road to a weathered diner
The woman who only smokes when she's worried, pulls out a pack of Camels
Looks through the diner's frosted window
a lone customer sits nursing his coffee
He is 40, lean, very attractive
Dark hard eyes, set into worries of their own
Wavey lights up
Watches in silence until
the man looks up
Their eyes meet through the glass
Hold
And on his faint smile
She turns her back
Starts up the road
he is walking beside her now
Snow drifting lazy, her smoke curling up
He watches her anger, how cold and quiet and closed
Smiles at her profile
shoulda come last night
Seen the show
She can't even believe he said that
Never looking at him
Woulda been a thrill for the Christians among' em
They think you're dead
Keep walking
His smile is gentle
Well, then we got good news for th
So does your son
beat
Even better news for him
(low) You think so
Breaking the words off
He's watching her profile
(very soft) can't undo the hurt 've done
Unless you let me
Gauging the feeling behind the bitterness
There's a million reasons to send me away
Good ones
And only two reasons not to
Is she even listening
He lets the silence hang
love you
And you love me
She stops walking
Flips her cigarette off into the snow
Turns now
Looks into his face
And sighs
- Rear  of Agnis, crouching in the lightly falling snow
At the edge of the sea
The spot where she once sent her dog to rest
footfalls crunching slowly across the rocks
bulky figure comes into frame
Crouches down beside her
Close
She stares at the gray horizon
(softly) Mavis Bangs
Told me where you'd be
No answer
But she hears him all right
We get so little mention in the wires
Thought you'd like to see
He hands the folded print-out to her
Head in the suitcase
The mystery's solved
She looks briefly at his eyes
Takes it
Starts to read
Silver Melville was captured in Moored with a cruise steward
The boy was twenty, a looker, wearing Armani clothes
Driving a nice Lexus
Agnis keeps reading
Says she did it all for love
She nods at that
Folds the paper neatly, as if conveying respect
Hands it back
She'd call me, time to time
Husband was a pig
More women should do what she done
Her situation
He looks in her eyes
And decides to say
Some women
Shoulda done it to their brother
The look holds
She sees the compassion in his eyes
Knows he's so on her side
She clears her throat
(softly) Cousin Nolan
Hafta pay him a visit
They share a look
He glances at the sea
Beautiful spot
Mavis said you buried Warren here
Called it an anniversary
She stares deep and unblinking into his eyes
She will tell him
Of a loss
But not the dog
held moment
What makes us do that, nephew
Give ourselves away to someone
So we can't eat or think or breathe without 'em
(just above a whisper) don't know
We just do
Silence
And
Wonderful, ain't it
And now she smiles
Something we have rarely seen
Irene Warren died
The mornin' after a Christmas
We get one true love in life, nephew
She was mine
He's not surprised
And that, in turn, does not really surprise her
Don't mean we can't give love again
And get some back
For some, it does
(straight back) Not for me
Strong with that
Sure
And if that ruffles some small town feathers
His smile in return
Very real
'know what the feathers around here need th' most
good ruffling, say
He sounds pretty sure himself
Their look ho1ds
'know what  need th' most
She doesn't
really big breakfast
She nods, one last time
Sounds like a plan
- Quoyle alone with his cut-and-paste, making up the front page layout
Moonlight on fallen snow through the window
Late enough, quiet enough, to hear
the vehicle drive up, the engine turn off
The footfalls to the door, which swings open
The last person he'd expect to see
Especially with a bottle
Of Cuervo Gold
They stare at each other
Only he smiles
Hey
Congratulations
She shoots him a quizzical look
We see the edge right off, even if he doesn't
Last night
On the stage
You were
Shakes his head with innocent admiration
She puts the bottle on his desk
It was easy
just kept thinkin'
How would Petal do it
He hears it now, right enough
The anger, the Cuervo
She stalks on over to the coffee counter, only a bit wobbly
Plucks up two styrofoam cups
We're friends, right
Friends drink together
Back to his desk
Shrugs her coat off onto the floor
Pullover and jeans, she looks terrific
Hikes her butt up onto the edge of his desk
asked a quest
(quiet) 'll drink with you
If you're not done yet
Her soft throaty laugh
He hasn't seen her this way
Can't decide if it's more scary or exciting
Not drunk enough yet to talk about Petal
Which we always seem to do
Opens the bottle
About four fingers are gone
Let's talk about me
Which we don't
Pours herself another two
Thinks before she says
Growin' up, all  wanted from this place was out
Imagine
Give up all this
Pours two fingers for him
Stretches her body to slide the cup across the desk
The Cuervo sloshes
ran off to Toronto, went to school
Wanted to be a social worker
For kids
She's looking at her cup now
Not at him
Came back one summer
Fell for Herold Prowse
That
Was that
Takes a swallow
Closes her eyes
Did you know  was a liar
Opens her eyes
Straight into his
Did you
Herold liked other women
But you know how that is
Sure you do
(whispers) He didn't die
Not that he didn't deserve to
Quoyle blinks
perfect stunned ox gape
See, 'm a good liar
Drains her cup
He ran off to Seattle with some bitch
When his damaged son was two months old
And nobody knew
An ice-cold wink
Like  said
It's four years ago
And it's yesterday
Pours herself another
Savors the memory
So  took his boat out
sunk it
And told my little story
Grieving widow
Shrugs a drunken, careless shrug
was leaving, of course
Why humiliate myself on the wayout
Yes
(softer) But a funny thing happened
On my way out
Her eyes are deeper now
And for a beat, the anger slips away
All these funny, odd little folks
They put their hearts around me
So  wouldn't be alone
Having lost the man  loved
Silence
real one
And since  knew, to my shame, that is exactly what  had lost
let go of the will to leave
did
did
Decided to let my child grow up
Around folks better than his mom
Stares in his eyes
You're quite the talker
(quiet) take pride in that
So she smiles
But the bitterness is there in it
Well, this morning
The man loved
Came back
And the world
Ceases to spin
One man's world, at least
She watches that
Assesses it
Told me he knew
loved him still
Sips at her second drink
Slides the rest of it down
Okay
Now 'm drunk enough
To talk about Petal
Her eyes ask
Are you
You're thinking we're kindred souls, you and me
In love with our nightmares
Shakes her head
Uh-uh
You don't love your Petal
You hate
Her cheating
Guts
Means those words as an opening blow
Jacks or better
Here comes the hole card
You have to think it's love
Because if it's not, you're dead inside
So you keep that flame a flickering
Cos it's all you'll ever have
Pure contempt
And honesty
You see
You're a good liar, too
Lifts the cap
Screws it back on the bottle
Where's the damn eggshells
That's all  came to see
And from his prison of shock and shame
He points to a shelf
She is  his desk, like a panther
the tiny padded box with its treasure
it high to smash it, and
stops
To see the panic
In his eyes
It brings tears
Pooling in hers
And she sets the treasure down, with the tenderness that decency requires
Can you guess how  know about Petal
He cannot
Because you and
Are kindred souls
After all
And that
Is what she came to say
So  told my husband
To fuck himself
And the ego he rode in on
She crosses the floor
Scoops up her coat
Walks, just a little wobbly, to the door
Sighs
Thanks for the mirror
Nods
Means that
If  don't see you
Happy New Year
And leaves
The door closes quietly
Quoyle looks from it
To the eggshells
And back
'  - Dennis and his wife  bundled together asleep, as a ferocious storm  around the house
Quoyle awake on the sofa in Dennis' parlor
Clutching his blankets around him
Eyes jumping with every  of the marauding wind
Mind racing with thoughts of Wavey
And eggshells
Bunny asleep with Dennis' daughter
The room seems to vibrate under the violence of the weather's assault
on Bunny now, and
her eyes
strange intent in them
knowledge
She slips from Marty's bed in her thin blue nightdress
Through the house in the dark, as the wind  its warning
Into the par- lor where her father sleeps, as the wind suddenly , and
her straight  the chimney and out  the heart of the storm
like a loosened kite out across the black water
Out and out, as gray light rises, to
Quoyle Point, where she is blown  against a granite boulder just in front of the Green House, which  and pleads against the wind, its steel cables , and suddenly from within the house, lights come
the   is in a window
No longer snarling and menacing, but whining pitifully, begging to be saved
And on the second floor
alone, wild-eyed with terror
She is dressed all in blue, and her daisy-chain necklace flies about her throat as she against the glass, her eyes staring directly  her daughter, who can only scream soundlessly against the gale as the house
begins to come , the first cable  and about with the fierce destructiveness of unleashed power, then the , and , and with Petal still visible,  in horror, windows  everywhere else like flash bulbs, the house
slides , along the rocks, toward the cliff, Bunny screeching as it goes  the edge,  down toward the sea, and Bunny
sits   in bed, a single  as her dad is , holding her tight
She is soaked with sweat
But her eyes are not wild
They are filled with the knowing
(a whisper) Daddy
The Green House is gone
He smooths her hair
The wind bellows in rage
Little Marty somehow sleeps on, undisturbed, beside her
(a whisper) didn't dream it
Don't say  did
- They climb from the station wagon into cold, clear sunlight
Stare in wonder at the naked rock
The snapped, spent, cables
Only shards of wood and glass leaving a hapless trail toward the cliff
Bunny  toward the debris, and through it
To a tangle of bushes near the cliff
He walks to a broken cable
Crouches
His eyes running over the space
Where his ancestor's home once stood
And then
He turns
(calls out) What you got there
We see now
Bunny has unearthed a huge wooden crate from its hiding place
Too engrossed in counting its contents to respond
As he comes over
(not looking up) Petal's things
She is counting her treasure trove of
More than any sound mind could imagine
Yet, in their infinite variety, somehow wonderful
testimonial to the power of love
think they're all here
She looks up
Sees him staring so fixedly at them
(alerted) What's wrong
They're beautiful
never saw 'em
All together
Oh
The kid doesn't smile
She decides whether to ask him
Will she be proud to wear 'em
He looks in her eyes
His heart breaks behind his smile
Well
Any woman would
'  - Steel gray morning
The sea is more than a little rough, as Jack lays out his lobster traps
Two other boats, not too close by, appear and disappear in mist
He is checking the lines, knotting hefty weights onto the traps to take them down
(sings to himself) Oh, th' Gandy Goose she ain't no uuuuse Cos all her nuts'n bolts is
Stops
Halfway to lowering the next trap over the side
(mutters) Sweet Jesus
'm turnin' inta Alvin Cockadoodle Yark
As it nears the water line, Jack's cat   suddenly down  the trap
Jack blinks
What is this
Suicide attempt
Tries to let go of the trap and grab the cat in one motion, but the cat   to the boat, Jack  out of his way,  in the coiled line which  as the trap goes
, the line  Jack's leg and  him flailing the side in one startling heartbeat
Almost comic to watch
But then
It is very quiet
Air bubbles appear at the surface
In a few seconds
The water is unbroken
The boat bobs silently in the swells
'   - Quoyle and Alvin inspect Quoyle's newly-finished boat
It is a beauty, to be sure, and the old builder watches Quoyle lovingly running his hand across the smooth gunnel
Alvin doesn't smile
That's not his style
Gotta paint the name
What'll it be
'The Tall And Quiet Woman'
Quoyle glances over
The old boy's eyes are dancing
You knew Billy's dad
Ever'body knows ever'body
But Billy's pap didn't invent the Four Women in a Man's Life
Quoyle nods
Guess not
Well
Which one is Bunny,  wonder
The Maid in the Meadow, mebbe
But Yoda is just staring at him
And quietly
Doncha know
They're all the same woman
That's the point
His pupil blinks
Like a crystal bullet of clarity his brain
The Maid in the Meadow, that's her innocence and play
The Stouthearted Woman, is when you need to lean on her
For some reason he could never name
Tears are pooling in eyes
The Tall and Quiet Woman
That's the silent partner who always walks 'longside, so's yer never alone
Quoyle is nodding, now
It all seems so right
And the Demon Lover
That's just the frostin' on th' cake
soft knocking at the door
When y'find the woman who's all four
That's when y'got yer one true love
The bird-like woman enters
The old man nods toward her
like m'Gertie
But she isn't alone
man enters behind her
It is Dennis Buggit
And there are tears on his face
He brings a dreadful silence with him, because the face is an open grave
My dad went over the side this mornin'
Tangled in th' sling- stone line
sob escapes from this strong man's throat
He ignores it
No one knows what to say
If you could write a memorial t' him
Fer t'morrow's Gammy Bird
'd be real grateful
'  - The road is jammed with parked cars and trucks and vans and wagons Folks still streaming toward the brightly-lit house
Ever'body knows ever'body
'  - Every room is filled with folks who wear their best
There is eating and chatter and even some pockets of laughter, as we move through the crowd
As if some have taken hold of a wake's well- meaning purpose
Others stand dazed, still wearing their pain and confusion
There are children here, some hold a parent's hand, some giggle with each other
Snapshot of a community
Struggling to cope
Quoyle and Bunny enter, holding hands, looking around
As they cross the room
two figures step into their path
Two women holding hands, their bodies close together
Their feeling for each other open for all to see
One is Agnis
And the other
Isn't Mavis Bangs
Happy New Year, Mr
Quoyle
'm sorry  missed you at the pageant
Slightly startled, Quoyle can't help but smile, despite the solemn occasion
At the proud look on his aunt's face
was in the wings, a course
Wasn't our girl somethin'
Our girl, a course, is Agnis
Who nearly blushes at the compliment
say, y'have t'love a woman
Who's in touch with her inner chicken
Well, who could argue with that
Dawn leans up, kisses Quoyle on the cheek
And with surprising softness
Nephew
You okay
He's okay
He's not sleeping in the box
Her great aunt looks at this child
Bends to plant an unexpected kiss on the top of Bunny's head
The kid squirms, tugs her dad firmly off, as he sends a parting wave
Into the parlor now
Quieter here, as the new arrivals thread past Jack Buggit in his open coffin, resting on black-draped sawhorses
Dennis and his mom stand by Jack, a hand and a word for each
And moving into the line
Remember what  told you
His words a murmur
Hers are bolder
If he's not sleeping
Why do they call it a awake
He thinks
As if it is a worthwhile question
We're the ones have to be awake
To how much we love him
Nods to himself
Yes
And how we should be good to each other
While we have the chance
He looks down
They are almost there
You think
She is thinking
Keeping the thoughts to herself
At the coffin now, he lifts her up to see
Jack lies motionless, a wax figure of himself
Serene behind violet eyelids
He looks like he's sleeping
Dennis looks over
His stolid, grim face releases a smile for his friend
That's cos he's peaceful
No worries, anymore
No troubles
He sets her down
Clasps Mrs
Buggit's hand
And from his pocket
found this in Jack's drawer at the paper
don't know if it's somethin' special
An enameled wreath with the initial , backed by a long, sharp pin She tears up again, just to see it
Oh, it's his lodge pin
We were lookin' all over
She smiles bravely as she takes it
Leans up to kiss his cheek
(a whisper) Dennis showed me what y'wrote fer th' paper
Did Jack proud
So they look at each other
Dennis clears his throat, looks away
And then, Quoyle is leading Bunny off
You hungry
There's sandwi
Petal's peaceful, too
Just a statement of fact
To no one in particular
Dad squeezes her hand
Manages
You bet
You can count on tha
But she lets go
Scampers to a corner of the room
To Herry Prowse
And his mom
So Quoyle starts toward her, his heart in his throat
And when Wavey looks up
She is glad to see him
As he reaches her
She holds up her wrist
Dangling from it, her turquoise bracelet She wore her best for Jack
Quoyle stands very close
One last thing from his pocket
New Year's present
small box
Wrapped as careful as he could
She looks to his eyes, really
Oh, yeh
It's a Quoyle tradition
Well, in that case
She takes it into her slender fingers
Undoes the ribbon, the paper
Lifts the lid to see, resting in tissue
eggshells
Crushed almost to powder
Her heart comes straight to her eyes, even before the whispered
Thanks
For the mirror
And across the room, Mrs
Buggit leans with trembling hands to fix the Lodge pin to Jack's lapel
Shaking as she is, the hand lurches, the big pin goes , and
a rattling
Rolls across this room
The world falls silent
Jack's wife grabs her son's arm, and their eyes bug out, staring into the box
'
And  to help hs gurgling father free his shoulders from the coffin's wedge
sudden , there are , there is even and , complete chaos
And in the bedlam, a tug on Quoyle's coat
See
He woke up
- Sunlit day of crystal perfection
The majesty of ice and towering rock and shimmering water
scale so majestic, any cynic would be hard put to deny God's hand
And gliding into
a tiny skiff
On its maiden run
We  to see
painted on its side
One woman is rowing just now, doing all the work
Her son sleeps in the bow
And in the middle of the little boat
father and daughter
Are unpacking the picnic lunch
There is a lot of food
This could take awhile
That's a funny thing to say
For the first thing he said
What
''m keepin' m'damn lobster license'
Yeh
That
Maybe he just said it
To make your Uncle Dennis laugh so hard
You think
She keeps unpacking
Her face quiet and serious
Her thoughts her own
(very softly) It's not fair, is it
That Jack woke up
And Petal didn't
And since he's said her thought aloud
She tells him
Well
The world's not fair
You said
She's not looking up
But he knows she's listening
That's something the world is always teaching us
And sometimes, the learning comes later
That gets through
Both adults can see it
(a murmur) You taught me that
Eyes resolutely down, she nods
Remembers
You know
What we wait for
It's like the main stem of this boat
It gives us our shape
Her brow furrows
Doesn't understand that
See,  know why you saved a place for Petal
All this time
On this
She looks up
Her dad is smiling from his eyes
Cos 'm the daddy
And you learn how to do
By watching me
And
You just watched
Better than knew
Still holding Bunny's eyes
He beckons to the woman rowing
'mere, a second
So Wavey sets down her oars
Slides over
And Quoyle whispers to his daughter
Watch this
He leans his face
To Wavey's mouth
kiss so tender, even a child can't turn away
The moment lingers
And when it ends
'm thanking your daddy
For all my presents
There was only two
Wavey looks at this girl
More than two
Everything  need
Except
Except
She gathers all the courage it takes to say
Except a necklace
And waits
We can feel her heart pounding in her throat
Bunny stares back with eyes no one could read
And then
got a box of 'em
You could pick one
hush over this bay
woman stunned and grateful
Then you'd have everything you need
Well, that seems true
So, the woman nods
Her eyes flutter down
In the silence, she unwraps a sandwich
(a murmur) You want the cheese
No
Okay, then
She hands that one to Quoyle
And as she and Bunny look for another, we
and , an   swirling above the shimmering bay
The boat so far below us
The people tiny specks
They could be anyone
Anyone at all
