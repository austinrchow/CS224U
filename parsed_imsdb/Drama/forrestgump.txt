Hello
My name's Forrest Gump
He opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse
You want a chocolate
The nurse shakes her head, a bit apprehensive about this strange man next to her
could eat about a million and a half of these
My momma always said, "Life was like a box of chocolates
You never know what you're gonna get
" Forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's shoes
Those must be comfortable shoes
'll bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing
wish  had shoes like that
My feet hurt
Momma always says there's an awful lot you could tell about a person by their shoes
Where they're going
Where they've been
The black woman stares at Forrest as he looks down at his own shoes
've worn lots of shoes
bet if think about it real hard  could remember my first pair of shoes
Forrest closes his eyes tightly
Momma said they'd take my anywhere

All right, Forrest, you can open your eyes now
Let's take a little walk around
The doctor sets Forrest down on its feet
Forrest walks around stiffly
Forrest's mother,
, watches him as he clanks around the room awkwardly
How do those feel
His legs are strong, Mrs
Gump
As strong as 've ever seen
But his back is as crooked as a politician
Forrest walks foreground past the doctor and Mrs
Gump
But we're gonna straighten him right up now, won't we, Forrest

The photo turns into live action as the General dons a hooded sheet over his head
The General is in full Ku Klux Klan garb, including his horse
The General rides off, followed by a large group of Klan members dressed in full uniform
(
) She said we was related to him in some way
And, what he did was, he started up this club called the Ku Klux Klan
They'd all dress up in their robes and their bedsheets and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something
They'd even put bedsheets on their horses and ride around
And anyway, that's how  got my name
Forrest Gump
Mrs
Gump and Forrest walk across the street
(
) Momma said that the Forrest part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that, well, just don't make no sense
Forrest stops suddenly as his brace gets stuck
Forrest's brace is caught in a gutter grate
Mrs

Haven't you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before
Mrs
Gump and Forrest walk along the sidewalk past the two old men
Mrs
Gump holds tightly onto Forrest's hand

Something like that
Mrs
Gump and Forrest walk along the Gump Boarding House driveway
(
) Since it was just me and Momma and we had all these empty rooms, Momma decided to let those rooms out
Mostly to people passing through
Like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, place like that
That's how me and Mommy got money
Mommy was a real smart lady
Remember what  told you, Forrest
You're no different than anybody else is
Mrs
Gump heads Forrest to the porch
She bends down to look Forrest in the eye

" Forrest is right here
The state requires a minimum
of eighty to attend public school, Mrs
Gump
He's gonna have to go to a special school
Now, he'll be just fine
What does normal mean, anyway
He might be a bit on the slow side, but my boy Forrest is going to get the same opportunities as everyone else
He's not going to some special school to learn to how to re-tread tires
We're talking about five little points here
There must be something can be done
Forrest sits outside the principal's office
We're a progressive school system
We don't want to see anybody left behind

Loud organic male grunts are heard coming from inside the house

Forrest is sitting on the porch
Well, your momma sure does care about your schooling, son
Mm-mm-mm
The principal wipes the sweat from his neck, then looks back at Forrest
You don't say much, do you
Forrest grunts, imitating him
The principal, embarrassed, turns and walks away

Gump reads from the book "Curious George" as Forrest sits on the bed and listens
Finally, he had to try it
It looked easy, but, oh, what happened
First there
Momma, what's vacation mean

) Hello, 'm Forrest
-  (1966) Forrest steps onto the army bus
Rain pours outside as the army bus driver yells at Forrest
Forrest Gump
Nobody gives a hunk of shit who you are, fuzzball
You're not even a lowlife scum sucking maggot
Get your faggoty ass on the bus
You're in the Army now
Forrest is about to sit on the first available seat, but the recruit sitting there refuses Forrest
#1 This seat's taken
Forrest tries to sit on the next seat, but the 2nd recruit slides over, blocking him
#2 It's taken
Forrest steps forward, looking much like he did on his first bus ride to school years ago
(
) At first, it seemed like  made a mistake
large black recruit with a strange look on his face, much like Forrest's, looks up from his seat
His name is
(
) seeing how it was my induction day and  was already gettin' yelled at
Bubba moves his case over, making room for Forrest to sit down
You can sit down
if you want to
(
) didn't know who  might meet or what they might ask
Bubba hands Forrest a handkerchief
You ever been on a real shrimp boat
No, but  been on a real big boat
'm talkin' about a shrimp catchin' boat
've been workin' on shrimp boats all my life
started out my uncle's boat, that's my mother's brother, when  was about maybe nine
was just lookin' into buyin' a boat of my own and got drafted
My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue
Bubba and Forrest shake hands
People call me Bubba
Just like one of them redneck boys

Matter of fact, 'm goin' into the shrimpin' business for myself after  get out the Army
Okay
- is in Forrest's face as Forrest stands in line with the other recruits
Gump
What's your sole purpose in this Army
To do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant
Godamnit, Gump
You're a goddamned genius
That's the most outstanding answer 've ever heard
You must have a godamned
of a hundred and sixty
You are godamned gifted, Private Gump
The Drill Sergeant moves down the line to the next man
Listen up, people
(
) Now, for some reason,  fit in the Army like one of them round pegs
It's not really hard
You just make your bed real neat and remember to stand up straight
That is one very intelligent individual
You lock your scuzzy bodies up behind that private and do exactly what he does and you will go far in this man's army
(
) And always answer every question with "Yes, Drill Sergeant
" Is that clear
& Yes, Drill Sergeant
The recruits are sitting at the base of their bunks assembling their rifles
Bubba speaks to Forrest
What you do is you just drag your nets across the bottom
On a good day, you can catch over a hundred pounds of shrimp
If everything goes all right, two men shrimpin' ten hours, less what you spends on gas, you can
Forrest finishes assembling his rifle as the other recruits are still working on theirs
Done, Drill Sergeant
Gump
The Drill Sergeant rushes up to Forrest
Why did you put that weapon together so quickly, Gump
You told me to, Drill Sergeant
The Drill Sergeant looks at his stop watch
Jesus Christ
This is a new company record
If it wouldn't be a waste of such a damn fine enlisted man, 'd recommended you for
, Private Gump
You are gonna be a General some day, Gump
Now, disassemble your weapon and continue
The Drill Sergeant walks away as Forrest begins to disassemble his rifle
After the Drill Sergeant walks past Bubba, Bubba looks up at Forrest
Bubba continues talking about shrimp in his slow southern drawl
Anyway, like  was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea
You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it
There, uh, shrimp kabobs, shrimp creole
Bubba and Forrest shine their boots
shrimp gumbo, panfried, deep fried, stir fried
There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp
Bubba and Forrest are on their hands and knees as they scrub the floor with toothbrushes
shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich
that's, that's about it
Bubba lies in his bunk and looks up quietly
(
) Nighttime in the Army is a lovely time
Forrest lies in his bunk and looks up
(
) We'd lay there in our bunks, and 'd miss my momma
And 'd miss Jenny
young private tosses a Playboy magazine onto Forrest
Hey, Gump
Get a load of the tits on her
Forrest pick up the magazine and turns the page, revealing Jenny as she poses with a school sweater on, and that's all
The pictorial is titled: "Girls of the South
" Forrest looks up with shock
He cranes his head up for a closer look
(
) Turns out, Jenny had gotten into some trouble over
some photos of her in her college sweater
And she was thrown out of school
"My baby does the hanky-panky
" /  -  (1966) Forrest, in his army uniform, steps into the foyer of the club
(
) But that wasn't a bad thing
Because a man who owns a theater in Memphis, Tennessee, saw those photo and offered Jenny a job singing in a show
The first chance  got,  took the bus up to Memphis to see her perform in that show
steps out onto the stage
That was Amber, Amber Flame
Give her a big hand, guys
Good job, Amber
And now, for your listening and viewing pleasure, direct from Hollywood, California, our very own beatnik beauty, let's give a big round of applause to the luscious Bobbie Dylan
Bobbie
Bobbie
The emcee walks back off the stage and the curtain opens, revealing Jenny as she sits on a stool on the stage
She holds a guitar up and begins to play
She is topless
(sings) "Yes, and how many seas must the white dove said, before she sleeps in the sand
" (
) Her dream had come true
She was a folk singer
(sings) "Yes, how many times must the cannonballs fly before they're forever banned
" #1 You gotta lose the guitar, darling
#2 Hey, come on, baby
Shake it up
Shake it up now
#3 Hey, somebody ought to get her a harmonica
The men laugh
(sings) "The answer, my friend is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in
# skin, honey
This isn't Captain Kangaroo
Yeah
Come on
Man #5 reaches up and tries to stick some money in Jenny's shoe
#5 : Hey, honey,  got something here for you
Jenny kicks his hand
He yells angrily as he sits back down, then tosses his drink on her
#5 Goddamnit
Hey
Hey
Stupid jerk
'm singing a song here
Polly, get out here
# Hey, show us some stuff, honey
Shut up
Oh, shut up
Forrest walks up to Man #5 and grabs him and tosses him down on the ground
Man #4 tries to grab Forrest, but Forrest shoves him down too
Forrest, what are you doing here
What are you doing
Forrest climbs up onto the stage and picks Jenny up, guitar and all, and carries her
Come on
What are you doing
Forrest, let me down
Jenny struggles and frees herself from Forrest
Forrest steps back in surprise
Jenny shoves the guitar at Forrest
Jenny walks off as Forrest holds the guitar
He follows after her
- Forrest follows Jenny over a bridge outside the night club
You can't keep doing this, Forrest
You can't keep tryin' to rescue me all the time
They was tryin' to grab you
lot of people try to grab me
Just -- you can't keep doing this all the time
can't help it
love you
Forrest, you don't know what love is
Jenny turns and looks over the bridge
You remember that time we prayed, Forrest
We prayed for God to turn me into a bird so  could fly far, far away
Yes,  do
You think  can fly off this bridge
What do you mean, Jenny
Nothing
Jenny turns and looks at the light of an approaching vehicle
She steps into the street
gotta get outta here
Jenny runs and flags down the approaching vehicle
But wait
Jenny
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay
You just stay away from me, please
pickup truck pulls over as Jenny looks at the driver
Can  have a ride
Where you going
don't care
Get in the truck
So bye-bye, Jenny
They sendin' me to Vietnam
It's this whole other country
Jenny walks toward Forrest
She looks at the driver
Just hang on a minute
Jenny walks up to Forrest
Listen, you promise me something, okay
Just if you're ever in trouble, don't try to be brave, you just run, okay
Just run away
Okay
Jenny, 'll write you all the time
Jenny takes a last look at Forrest, then climbs into the truck
Forrest watches Jenny in the pickup as it drives away
(
) And just like that
/  / - Forrest, dressed in his uniform, sits on a log and looks out at a river
(
) she was gone
Mrs
Gump walks toward Forrest and sits down next to him on the log
Forrest leans down, placing his head on his mother's shoulder
You come back safe to me, do ya hear
/  -  (1967) The shadow of a helicopter over the rice field below soldier is manning a gun from inside the helicopter
The solider looks left, Forrest and Bubba ride in the helicopter
/4TH The helicopter circles overhead, then lands at the firebase
"Some folks are born made to wave the flag
Ooh, they're red, white and blue
And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief," ohh, they point the cannon at you all
It ain't me
It ain't me
ain't no Senator's son, no
It ain't me
It ain't me
" Bubba and Forrest jump out of the helicopter with their gear/ They walk and look around oddly
(
) Now, they told us that Vietnam was gonna be very different from the United Sates of America
The soldier places a case of beer on a large stack of cases
He takes two beers out and walks away
In the background, soldiers are barbecuing steaks and drinking beer
(
) Except for all the beer cans and the barbecue, it was
'know,  bet there's shrimp all in these waters
They tell me these Vietnams is good shrimp
You know, after we win this war, and we take over everything we can get American shrimpers to come on here and shrimp these waters
We'll just shrimp all the time, man
So much shrimp, why, you wouldn't believe it
Lieutenant   steps out of a tent
Shirtless, he holds a roll of toilet paper in his hand
You must be my
's
Morning', sir
Ho
Get your hands down
Do not salute me
There are goddamned snipers all around this area who would love to grease an officer
'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor
Welcome to Fourth Platoon
Lt
Dan looks at Bubba
What's wrong with your lips
was born with big gums, sir
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire
Where you boys from in the world
& Alabama, sir
You twins
Forrest and Bubba look at each other oddly, they don't get the joke
No, we are not relations, sir
Look, it's pretty basic here
Lt
Dan starts to walk
Bubba and Forrest grab their gear and follow him
You stick with me, you learn from the guys who been in country awhile, you'll be right
There is one item of
gear that can be the difference between a live grunt and a dead grunt
Lt
Dan stops and looks at the boys
Socks, cushion, sole,
green
Try and keep your feet dry when we're out humpin'
want you boys to remember to change your socks wherever we stop
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet right off his legs
Lt
Dan steps over to a large black soldier named Sergeant Sims
Goddamnit, where is that sling-rope  told you to order
put in requisitions at Battalion
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well you call those sonabitches again, call them again and again and again
don't care how much it takes
(
) Lt
Dan sure knew his stuff
felt real lucky he was my lieutenant
He was from a long, great military tradition
Somebody in his family had fought and died in every single American war
/   -  (1778) distant relative of Lt
Dan's, wearing a revolutionary war uniform, falls dead in the snow
/   -  (1863) Another relative, wearing a civil war uniform and bearing a striking resemblance to Lt
Dan, falls down dead
/   -  (1944) Another relative, wearing a World War , falls down dead on the beach at Normandy
/ / -  (1967) Goddamnit, kick some ass
'm on it, Lieutenant
Get on it
Lt
Dan steps back up to Bubba and Forrest
(
) guess you could say he had a lot to live up to
Lt
Dan walks along the walkway and Bubba and Forrest follow
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh
Well, 've been through there
Little Rock's a fine town
Now, go shake down your gear, see the platoon sergeant, draw what you need for the field
Lt
Dan steps inside the latrine, still holding the roll of toilet paper
If you boys are hungry, we got steaks burnin' right here
Lt
Dan sits down out of sight in the latrine, then stands up, looking at the boys
Two standing orders in this platoon
One, take good care of your feet
Two, try not to do anything stupid, like gettin' yourself killed
Lt
Dan sits back down out of sight in the latrine
Bubba and Forrest look at each other
sure hope  don't let him down
- Forrest, Bubba, and other soldiers in the Fourth Platoon walk across the rice field
Some Vietnamese rice farmers are working as the soldiers walk past
(
) got to see a lot of countryside
We would take these real long walks
/  - Forrest's unit walks along a dirt road
And we were always lookin' for this guy named Charlie
can't get no relief
Suddenly Lt
Dan holds up his fist, a signal for the unit to stop
He motions for them to get down
Hold it up
Hold up, boys
Forrest gets down and looks around
(
) It wasn't always fun
Lt
Dan always gettin' these funny feelings about a rock or a trail, or the road, so he'd tell you to get down, shut up
Get down
Shut up
(
) So we did
Lt
Dan motions for the lead soldier to get down
Lt
Dan crouches down
Lt
Dan looks at the soldiers and points to his eyes
He lies down on the dirt road and crawls
(
) Now,  don't know much about anything, but  think some of American's best young men served in this war
There was Dallas, from Phoenix
Cleveland, he was from Detroit
Hey, Tex
Hey, Tex
Man, what the hell's going on
Tex holds up his hand, motioning that he doesn't know
(
) And Tex was, well,  don't remember where Tex come from
Ah, nothin'
Fourth Platoon, on your feet
Still got ten clicks to go to that river
Forrest stands up and begins to walk with the platoon
All right, move out
Comin' out
Look alive out there
(
) The good thing about Vietnam is there was always someplace to go
(
) Fire in the hole
/   - Lt
Dan walks away as Forrest rushes over, aims two pistols in the hole, then climbs inside
(
) And there was always something to do
Mount 'em up
Spread out
Cover his back
- The platoon walks through a rice paddy, waits deep in water
It begins to rain
(
) One day it started raining, and it didn't quit for four months
The rain pours down on Forrest and Bubba as they sit in a foxhole
(
) We been through every kind of rain there is
Little bitty stingin' rain
- The platoon walks through the jungle as rain pours down on them
(
) and big ol' fat rain
- The platoon shelters themselves as they walk through the wind and rain
(
) Rain that flew in sideways
- Forrest and other soldiers walk chest-deep through a river
The rain splatters back up from the river, hitting the soldiers
Forrest holds his hand up to protect his face
(
) And sometimes rain even seemed to come straight up from underneath
- The rain pours down on the men of the platoon as they sit in a camp
Bubba sits down next to Forrest
(
) Shoot, it even rained at night
Bubba leans his back up against Forrest's back
Hey Forrest
Hey Bubba
'm gonna lean up against you, you just lean right back against me
This way, we don't have to sleep with our heads in the mud
You know why we a good partnership, Forrest
'Cause we be watchin' out for one another
Like brothers and stuff
Hey, Forrest, there's somethin' 've been thinkin' about
got a very important question to ask you
How would you like to go into the shrimpin' business with me
Okay
Man,  tell you what,  got it all figured out, too
So many pounds of shrimp to pay off the boat, so many pounds for gas, we can just live right on the boat
We ain't got to pay no rent
'll be the captain; we can just work it together
Split everything right down the middle
Man, 'm tellin' you, fifty-fifty
And, hey, Forrest, all the shrimp you can get
That's a fine idea
(
) Bubba did have a fine idea
- Some soldiers patrol the area
Forrest lies in a pup tent and writes a litter as the rain pours down
He uses his flashlight to see
(
) even wrote Jenny and told her all about it
sent her letters
Not every day, but almost
told her what  was doin' and asked her what she was doing, and  told her how thought about her always
' '  - Jenny steps out of the trailer with a backpack and a guitar
She hugs a hippie guy, then jumps into the back of a Volkswagen bus with another guy
(
) And how  was looking forward to getting a letter from her just as soon as she had the time 'd always let her know that  was okay
- Forrest writes a letter in his tent
(
) Then 'd sign each letter, "Love, Forrest Gump
" - The Fourth Platoon makes their way through the jungle and rain
"There's something happenin' here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there, telling' me  got to beware
" (
) This one day, we was out walking, like always, and then, just like that, somebody turned off the rain and the sun come out
Forrest looks up as the sun suddenly appears
Forrest's platoon is attacked
bullet kills the soldier standing next to Forrest
Bombs explode all around as the soldiers scramble to the ground
Take cover
Forrest crawls over a berm as bullets fly overhead and explode all around him
Forrest rolls over and pulls his pack off Lt
Dan lies next to Forrest
Get that pig up here, goddammit
Forrest, you okay
Two soldiers with a machine gun fire into the jungle
Lt
Dan shouts into the radio
Forrest begins firing his weapon into the jungle
Strongarm, please be advised
Two soldiers pull a wounded soldier into the jungle
Medic, we got a man down
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over
Roger, Strongarm, be advised we have incoming from the treeline at point blue plus two

The machine gunner fires into the treeline
Another soldier helps him with the ammunition
The machine gun jams
Misfire
Misfire
Goddammit, Mac
Get that pig unfucked and get it in the treeline
rocket explodes on the machine gunner and the other soldier, killing them
Forrest looks down and covers his head as rockets explodes all around him
(into radio) Ah, Jesus

Pull back
Pull back
Forrest
Run
Run, Forrest
Pull back

The soldiers run through the jungle as bullets explode all around
soldier is blown up by a rocket
soldier runs through the jungle
Forrest runs past the soldier
Medic
Medic
Jesus, can  get a medic
(
) ran and ran, just like Jenny told me to
Rockets explode in the jungle as Forrest runs out toward a clearing
(
) ran so far and so fast that pretty soon  was all by myself, which was a bad thing
Bubba
Forrest turns around, then runs back into the jungle
(
) Bubba was my best good friend
had to make sure he was okay
Rockets explode in the jungle
Forrest runs back into the jungle to look for Bubba
1ST Any friendlies out there
2ND Yeah, 've got three over there
1ST Where the hell are you
Forrest stops and aims his weapon
He looks around, scared
Bubba
Something moves
Forrest turns and looks, then rushes over
(
) And on my way back to find Bubba, well, there was this boy laying on the ground
Tex
Tex lies on the ground, his face distorted with pain
Okay
Forrest reaches down and picks up Tex from the ground
Forrest pulls Tex up over his shoulder, then runs
(
) couldn't just let him lay there all alone, scared the way he was, so grabbed him up and run him out of there
Forrest carries Tex out of the jungle and into the clearing
He sets Tex down on the bank of a river, and runs back into the jungle
(
) And every time  went back looking for Bubba, somebody else was saying, "Help me, Forrest
Help me
" Forrest drops another wounded soldier down at the bank of the river next to Tex, and then runs back toward the jungle
Forrest grabs the third wounded soldier up from the ground and turns him over
It is
Can't hear
Can't hear
Dallas is dropped off at the bank next to the other wounded soldiers
Forrest turns to go back to the jungle
2ND No sweat, man
Just lay back
You're gonna be okay
You're gonna be okay
(
) started to get scared that  might never find Bubba
(over radio) You're danger close for crack air, over
Forrest trips over something and falls to the ground
He looks up to find two bloody legs
It is Lt
Dan, who is wounded
He speaks into the radio
(into radio) Roger, Strongarm,  know my position is danger close
We got Charlie all over this area

Over

Over
Forrest tries to pick up Lt
Dan, who tries to push Forrest away
Goddammit
What are you doing
Leave me here
Get away
Just leave me here
Get out
Forrest pulls Lt
Dan over his shoulder and runs through the jungle
Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6
This is Strongarm, be advised, your fast movers are inbound at this time, over
(
) Then it felt like something just jumped up and bit me
Forrest falls down
Ah, something bit me
Forrest gets up as Lt
Dan yells
Lt
Dan fires his pistol at the unseen enemy as Forrest pulls him away
You dink son-of-a-bitch

Forget about me
Get yourself out
Did you hear what  said
Goddammit, pull me down
Get your ass out of here

What the hell do you think you're going
To get Bubba

They're gonna nape the whole area
Forrest gets up and runs as Lt
Dan yells after him

Forrest runs through the jungle searching for Bubba
Forrest slows down and looks around carefully
Forrest
Bubba
Bubba looks up as he lies on the ground

Bubba holds a palm frond over his wound
Forrest removes the frond to look at the wound
Bubba's chest has been blown open
Oh, Bubba, no
Naw, 'm gonna be all right
Forrest looks around as he hear the voices of the enemy
Come on

Forrest carries Bubba through the jungle
The sound of approaching planes fills the air
'm okay, Forrest

Forrest walks along a wooden pier
Forrest pays an old black shrimper a large wad of cash
Tell me something
Are you stupid or something
Stupid is as stupid does, sir
' Forrest stands at the grave
Well, that's what's left after me saying, "When  was in China on the All-America Ping-Pong Team,  just loved playing ping-pong with my Flex- -Ping-Pong Paddle
" Which everybody knows it isn't true, but Momma says it's just a little white lie so it wouldn't hurt nobody
So, anyway, 'm putting all that on gas, ropes and new nets and a brand-new shrimpin' boat
- Forrest steers his shrimping boat
The boat is old and rusty
Forrest unleashes his nets as his catch of the day drops to the deck
It is a bunch of garbage and shells
Forrest picks up one shrimp
(
) Now, Bubba had told me everything he knows about shrimpin', but you know what  found out
Shrimpin' is tough
Forrest pulls a couple of shrimp out of a bucket
only caught five
couple of more, you can have yourself a cocktail
The old shrimper begins to walk away, then stops and looks at Forrest
Hey, you ever think about namin' this old boat
(
) 'd never named a boat before, but there was only one  could think of
Forrest paints a name on the side of his boat
The name is "Jenny
" (
) The most beautiful name in the wide world
Disco lights flash and people dance
guy asks a girl to dance
Okay
Jenny sits at a table with some other people
She is snorting cocaine
(
) Now,  hadn't heard from Jenny in a long while
But
- Forrest stands at the helm as the boat glides across the water
(
) But  thought about her a lot
And hoped that whatever she was doing made her happy

He reaches over and touches Jenny
She is pale with dark lines under her eyes
Jenny smears some lines of cocaine on a mirror
She looks at herself in the mirror
Jenny steps out onto the high-rise balcony
She steps up on a table and stands on the edge of the balcony
busy street lies many stories below
Jenny looks down to the intersection below
She slips over the edge, regains her balance, turns and looks back at the intersection below, and begins to get down from the edge
Jenny grabs a hold of the ledge and carefully climbs down
She sits down on a chair
Jenny rocks back and forth as she cries
She looks up at the sky
/'  - The moon shines above in the sky
Forrest lies in a hammock on his boat
(
) thought about Jenny all the time
' /  - Forrest stands at the helm of his boat and slowly glides by the docks

Dan
He smiles, surprised
Hi
Forrest leaps off of his moving boat and into the water
The boat continues as Forrest clumsily swims
Lt
Dan sits in his wheelchair at the edge of the dock
Forrest flails his arms as he swims up to the dock
Lt
Dan waits for Forrest, smoking a cigar
Forrest climbs up a ladder onto the dock
Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing here
Well,  thought 'd try out my sea legs
Well, you ain't got no legs, Lieutenant Dan
Well, well, Captain Forrest Gump had to see this for myself
And told you if you were ever a shrimp boat captain, that 'd be your first mate
Well, here  am
am a man of my word
Okay
Forrest shakes Lt
Dan's hand
Yeah, but don't you be thinking that 'm gonna be calling you sir
No, sir
Forrest's boat glides, crushing a dock
Forrest and Lt
Dan look at it
That's my boat

So, take a left
Take a left

Dan is sitting in the rigging
Which way
Over there
They're over there
Get, get on the wheel and take a left
Okay
Gump, what are you doing
Take a left
Left
That's where we're gonna find those shrimp, my boy
That's where we'll find 'em
Forrest empties the net
Their "catch" is debris that falls to the deck
Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan
Okay, so  was wrong
Well, how we gonna find them
Well, maybe you should just pray for shrimp
- The all-black gospel choir sings and claps their hands
(
) So  went to church every Sunday
Lt
Dan is sitting in his chair at the back of the church
He takes swigs from a liquor bottle
(
) Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too
Though  think he left the praying up to me
- catch of junk is dumped onto the deck
Lt
Dan lowers himself from the rigging
No shrimp
Where the hell's this God of yours
The wind begins to blow strong
(
) It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that, 'cause right then, God showed up
- Water sprays on deck during a hurricane
Lt
Dan on the rigging, shouts and shakes his fist as he is pelted by wind and rain
You'll never sink this boat
(
) Now me,  was scared
But Lieutenant Dan, he was mad
Come on
You call this a storm
Forrest slides back and forth as he attempts to steer the boat
Blow, you son-of-a-bitch
Blow
It's time for a showdown
You and me
'm right here
Come and get me

Yes, sir
We've got more money than Davy Crocket
Boy, 've heard some whoppers in my time, but that tops them all
We was sitting next to a millionaire
The man laughs as he walks away
Well,  thought it was a very lovely story
And you tell it so well
With such enthusiasm
Would you like to see what Lieutenant Dan looks like
Well, yes,  would

That's him right there
The elderly woman looks at the magazine and at Forrest with surprise
And let me tell you something about Lieutenant Dan

Louise and others are on the front porch
Where's Momma
She's upstairs
- ' Forrest opens the door, the doctor stands next to Mrs
Gump in bed
Hi, Forrest
'll see you tomorrow
Oh, all right
The doctor looks down at Forrest's legs
We sure got you straightened out, didn't we, boy
The doctor leaves and closes the door
Forrest takes off his hat and steps over to her
What's the matter, Momma
'm dyin', Forrest
Come on in, sit down over here
Why are you dyin', Momma
It's my time
It's just my time
Oh, now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart
Death is just a part of life
It's something we're all destined to do
didn't know it, but  was destined to be your momma
did the best could
You did good, Momma
Well,  happened to believe you make your own destiny
You have to do the best with what God gave you
What's my destiny, Momma
You're gonna have to figure that out for yourself
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest
You never know what you're gonna get
(
) Momma always had a way of explaining things so  could understand them
will miss you, Forrest
(
) She had got the cancer and died on a Tuesday
bought her a new hat with little flowers on it
- The elderly woman and Forrest sit
The woman is crying and wipes her eyes with a hankie
And that's all  have to say about that

Forrest looks at the elderly woman
Didn't you say you were waiting for the Number Seven bus
There'll be another one along shortly

(
) So,  never went back to work for Lieutenant Dan
Forrest takes out a letter and opens it
(
) Though he did take care of my Bubba- Gump money
He got me invested in some kind of fruit company
And so then  got a call from him saying we don't have to worry about money no more
And  said, "That's good
One less thing
" -  The choir and members are singing

She is surrounded by her many children
She looks at the check and faints
And you know what

Smells wonderful
Forrest rides the mower
(
) And 'cause  was godzillionaire and liked doing it so much

- Jenny walks across the lawn to Forrest
(
) And then, she was there
Hello, Forrest
Hello, Jenny
(
) Jenny came back and stayed with me
Jenny lies asleep in bed
(
) Maybe it was because she had nowhere else to go
Or maybe it was because she was so tired, because she went to bed and slept and slept like she hadn't slept in years
It was wonderful having her home
- Forrest and Jenny walking
(
) Every day we'd take a walk, and 'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree
And she'd listen about ping-pong and shrimpin' boats and Momma makin' a trip to heaven
did all the talkin'
Jenny most of the time was real quiet
big ol' gobs of rain and little bitty stinging rain and rain
Jenny's old house stands at the end of the dirt road
It appears to be deserted
Jenny walks toward the house and stops
She stares at the house
Forrest walks toward Jenny
Jenny suddenly heaves a rock angrily at the house
She throws other things at the house
How could you do this
She breaks a window
Jenny collapses to the ground and sobs
Forrest knees down next to her
(
) Sometimes  guess there just aren't enough rocks
- Jenny and Forrest sit on a limb together
(
) never really knew why she came back, but  didn't care

Forrest runs down the drive away from his house
(
) That day, for no particular reason, decided to go for a little run
Forrest runs to the end of the drive, then turns right and runs down the highway
(
) So  ran to the end of the road, and when  got there,  thought maybe 'd run to the end of town
- The three men sit as they watch the television
Forrest runs through the main street of town
President Carter, suffering from heat exhaustion fell into the arms of security agents

) And when  got there

And  figured since run this far, maybe 'd just run across the great
Forrest runs by a sign that reads "Mississippi welcomes you
The Magnolia State
" (
) state of Alabama
And that's what did  ran clear across Alabama
- For no particular reason,  just kept on going
ran clear to the ocean
- The sign reads "Santa Monica yacht harbor sports fishing - boating - cafes

(
) And when  got there,  figured since 'd gone this far,  might as well turn around, just keep on going
Forrest runs to a pier at the Atlantic Ocean
(
) When  got to another ocean,  figured since 've gone this far,  might as well just turn back, keep right on going
Forrest runs across the pier
lighthouse stands at the end of the pier
(
) When  got tired,  slept
When got hungry,  ate
- When  had to go, you know,  went
And so, you just ran
Yeah
Forrest is running along the highway
Forrest runs down a road between field of wheat
Mountain river
Forrest runs across a cobble-stone bridge
The Rocky Mountains are behind him in distance
Forrest runs through some meadowland
Split rail fences line the road
(
) 'd think a lot about Momma and Bubba, and Lieutenant Dan, but most of all, thought about Jenny
thought about her a lot

The  shows Forrest runs across a bridge that reads "Mississippi River
" 'll be damned
Forrest
Sir, why are you running
1ST Why are you running
2ND Are you doing this for world peace
3RD Are you doing this for women's right
Or for the environment
Or for animals
3RD Or for nuclear arms
(
) They just couldn't believe that somebody would do all that running for no particular reason
2ND Why are you doing this
just felt like running
- just left like running
Forrest runs as a   runs up to him
It's you
can't believe it's really you
- Now, for some reason what  was doing seemed to make sense to people
The young man jobs behind Forrest
mean, it was like an alarm went off in my head, you know
said, here's a guy that's got his act together
Here's somebody who's got it, all figured out
Here's somebody who has the answer
'll follow you anywhere, Mr
Gump
(
) So,  got company
Forrest runs up a slope on a high mountain road
group of people are jogging behind him
(
) And after that  got more company
And then
large group jogs behind Forrest across the desert road
(
) even more people joined in
Somebody later told me
- it gave people hope
Now
Now, don't know anything about that, but
Forrest and his followers job through a small town
man runs up and talks to Forrest
(
) Some of those people asked me if could help them out
Hey, man, hey, listen
was wondering if you might help me, huh
Listen, 'm in the bumper sticker business and 've been trying to think up a good slogan
And since you have been such a big inspiration to the people around here,  thought you might be able to help me jump into
Whoa
Man, you just ran through a big pile of dogshit
The hippie jumps over the "dogshit" as he runs along Forrest
It happens
What, shit
Sometimes
The hippie stops to ponder this profound thought
(
) And some years later  heard that fella did come up with a bumper sticker slogan
bumper sticker reads "Shit Happens
" (
) and he make a lot of money off of it
The truck with the bumper sticker drives into an intersection
It collides with a car
Forrest runs, followed by his group, as a man runs up to him
(
) Another time  was running along, somebody who had lost all his money in the -shirt business, and he wanted to put my face on a -shirt, but he couldn't draw that well and he didn't have a camera
- think it would be really fortunate for me if  could get your name on these, oh, your face and name on these -shirts
It would be wonderful
truck splashes mud onto Forrest as it goes by
The man hands Forrest a yellow -shirt to use as a rag to wipe the mud off
- Here, use this one
Nobody likes that color anyway
Forrest wipes his face on the towel and hands it back to the man
Have a nice day
The man looks at the -shirt
He holds it up displaying the "Happy Face
" (
) And some years later  found out that that man did come up with a idea for a -shirt and he made a lot of money off of it
Forrest runs with a group that follows behind him
(
) Anyway, like  was saying,  had a lot of company
My Momma always said you got to put the past behind you before you can move on
And  think that's what my running was all about
had run for three years, two months, fourteen days, and sixteen hours
Forrest stops running
The group stops behind him
Forrest stands and looks as the group waits expectantly
Forrest turns and look
Quiet
Quiet, he's gonna say something
'm pretty tired
think 'll go home now
Forrest walks toward the group
The group parts for Forrest as he walks down the middle of the road
Now what are we supposed to do
(
) And just like that, my running days was over

Oh, thank you, Miss, Miss Louise

) One day, out of the blue clear sky, got a letter from Jenny

She saw me on , running, 'm supposed to go on the Number Nine bus to Richmond Street and get off and go one block left to 1-9-4-7 Henry Street, Apartment 4
The elderly woman looks at the letter
Why, you don't need to take a bus
Henry Street is just five or six blocks down that way
Down that way
Down that way
Forrest hastily grabs his suitcase and letter as he stands
It was nice talking' to you

'm not supposed to, so 'll just leave it here for you
Forrest places the letter down at the grave marker, next to fresh flowers
The name on the envelope reads: "Mom
" Forrest steps back and looks down at the grave
Jenny,  don't know if Momma was right or if, if it's Lieutenant Dan
don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but ,  think maybe it's both
Maybe both is happening at the same time
miss you, Jenny
If there's anything you need,  won't be far away
As Forrest walks away, a flock of birds flies overhead and lands in the tree
Forrest turns and watches
- Forrest walks with Forrest Jr
for the bus
The bus drives toward them
Here's your bus
Okay
Forrest pulls "Curious George" out of Forrest Jr
's backpack
Hey,  know this
'm gonna show that for show-and- tell because grandma used to read it to you
Forrest looks at the book
The feather from the beginning of the movie drops out of the book, unnoticed
My favorite book
The bus comes to a stop
The door opens
Well
Forrest puts the book back into Forrest Jr
's backpack and hands it to him
okay
Hey, there you go
Forrest Jr
walks toward the bus
Forrest stands up
Hey, Forrest
Don't
wanted to tell you  love you
love you too, Daddy
'll be right here when you get back
Forrest Jr
looks into the bus and at the bus driver
It is the same bus driver, only older now, who drove Forrest to school when he was a young boy
You understand this is the bus to school now, don't you
Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris and 'm Forrest Gump
Forrest Jr
looks over and waves to his father
Forrest nods approvingly
Forrest Jr
gets on the bus
The bus pulls away
Forrest stands next to the mailbox
Forrest sits down
The camera cranes down, revealing the feather as it lies at Forrest's feet
gust of wind picks the feather up
The feather floats up into the air
Forrest sits at the side of the road
The feather floats higher into the air
The feather soars up into the sky and travels up and down, then covers the camera lens
