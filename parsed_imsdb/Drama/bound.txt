Written by Larry & Andy Wachowski : Inside a closet
It is a large closet with double doors, a crisp line of light cutting down through the center of the darkness
As we begin to descend, voices echo in our head
(
) had this image of you, inside of me, like a part of me
We move past a shelf filled with hatboxes and handbags
It is a woman's closet
(
) You planned this whole thing, didn't you
(
) Where's the fucking money
We glide over the tightly packed hangers, close enough to feel the different fabrics and descend past the dresses to the racks of high heels
(
) We make our own choices, we pay our own prices
(
) All part of the business
(
) All part of the business
(
) What choice
We slide along the delicate taper of a stiletto heel and reach the bottom of the closet, where we find a pair of black Dr
Martens boots that are tied together with a white rope
(
) want out
We move up the boots and we see it is a woman who is bound, lying motionless on the floor of the closet, the rope coiling tightly around her wrists
The crack at the bottom of the door lights her face
She is gagged and unconscious, a trickle of blood running down her forehead
Her name is
(
) Like a part of me
: - Leaning against the back of the elevator is Corky, a very butch-looking woman with short hair and a black leather jacket
She is a lesbian and wants people to know it
As the doors begin to slide shut, a woman yells
Wait
Hold the elevator
Corky pushes the "open" button
couple steps into the elevator
His name is , a middle-aged Italian, wearing an expensive suit and sunglasses
She is ; a piece of sexual candy that would melt in your mouth
She hears it again, a guttural sound
Thanks again for this opportunity, Mr
Bianchinni
Goodbye
She hangs up the phone and walks toward the wall
As she gets closer, we hear a bed rocking, tapping against the wall
The man's breathing grows more and more labored until finally it swells -- : - The whining motor of a high-powered drain-rod
The spiral cable whips wildly, spiraling deeper into the tub drain, black goo splattering everywhere
The machine is so loud Corky almost cannot hear someone pounding on the apartment door
Killing the motor, she stands and goes to the door
Behind the door is Violet, wearing jeans, a white -shirt and cowboy boots
Hi
My name is Violet
We sort of met in the elevator -- Yeah, sure
'm Corky
heard you working in here and just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee
She is holding two cups of coffee: one black, one with cream
Sure
Come on in
Give me a minute
Violet steps inside as Corky goes back to the bathroom to wash off the drain dreck
What happened to Rajeev
Corky calls from the bathroom, scrubbing her hands vigorously
Who
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building
Oh, he went home to India, but as far as  know he'll be back
She wipes her hands on her overalls, returning to the main room
So this is temporary for you
Pretty much
One day at a time
Violet hands her the cup of black coffee
guessed you were straight black
Good guess
They both sip from the piping hot mugs
Mmmm
thanks,  needed this
My pleasure
but to be honest, did have a slightly ulterior motive here
was wondering if  could ask a small favor
favor
Yeah, see, 'm kind of a night person, so  was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools
Oh, 'm sorry -- No, it isn't your fault
The walls here are just so thin
Are they really
Yes, it really causes problems
Sometimes it's like you're in the same room
But if it's too much trouble,  understand
No, no trouble
There's other work to do
You're doing everything yourself
Yeah
That is so amazing
'm in awe of people who can fix things
My dad was like that
We never had anything new
Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work
His hands were magic
She looks at Corky's hands cupped around the mug
Yeah
bet your car is twenty years old
Corky smiles
Truck
Truck
Of course
'63 Chevy
knew it
So, how do you know the owner, Mr
Bianchinni
don't, really
was referred to him
Oh, really
Corky suddenly feels she has revealed something
Do you know him
No, but Caesar does
He likes him
Says he's a good Italian
Caesar is your husband
Oh no, no
'm not the marrying kind
Smiling, she says nothing else
should be going
You can drop the cup off anytime
Thanks
My pleasure
watches her leave
- dirty bar hidden away on a dark street, its cracked, moon- white sign the only evidence it exists
Corky's truck swings into a space in front of a couple of large motorcycles
She flips her collar and heads for the door
- The smell of leather and cigarette smoke fills Corky's nose as she crosses to the bar
Well, well
Corky sits as the fat bartender waddles over
Been awhile, Cork
Five years, two months, sixteen days
How you doing, Sue
Corky puts a cigarette in her mouth and lights it
Like shit
Now that we're all caught up, how about a drink
Sue opens the refrigerator and pulls out two Old Styles
Thanks
They click the bottles together and drink
You got a job yet
Yeah
Some plumbing, painting and shit
Sue laughs
mean a --
real job
Not for me, Sue
'm straight and narrow
'm just here to get laid or drunk and hopefully both
Corky gets off the stool
Thanks for the beer
Looking around, she sees a woman alone at one of the back tables
Through the smoky din, she bears a slight resemblance to Violet
The woman is dressed all in black, including a leather jacket
Smiling, Corky slides into the chair beside her
There is no one smoother
Hi
Hello
You know
that outfit would look great on my bedroom floor
The woman smiles just as someone taps Corky on the shoulder
She turns and is face-to-face with a large bull of a woman in a heavy leather Chicago Police jacket
She is more wide than fat
Hey, Jesse
What's happening here
Nothing
yet
Who's this
Her coat opens as she puts her hands on her hips
service revolver is clipped to her belt
She squints at Corky, her head nodding in recognition
Wait,  know you
don't think so
didn't know you were out
Corky smiles at the woman in black
When you get tired of Cagney and Lacey, come find me
She heads for the exit
- The neighborhood would be politely described as "rough
" Corky's truck does not stand out parked alone on the littered street
'  - It is a hole but it is home
Corky is lying on her futon staring up at the ceiling, a beer resting on her stomach; a folk singer quietly croons from the radio
We see the ceiling, a circle of light hovering over the small desk lamp
We move in on the spot, which slowly fills up the screen until there is nothing but the white light
Suddenly a wet paint roller loaded with white paint cuts a swath across the ceiling
: - Corky is painting the ceiling
The folk ballad has become an angry Riot Grrrl anthem
She is working hard, the roller sucking back and forth
Sweat covers her face
Dropping the roller down, she reloads it in the tray when the phone rings
She stops and answers it
Hello
Oh, hi, Mr
Bianchinni
yes, everything is going fine got the tub drain all cleaned out
She listens for a moment
What apartment
She glances at the main wall
All right, all right,  guess  could take a look
Yeah, you're welcome, goodbye
She hangs up and looks again at the wall, feeling
curious
- Corky knocks and after a moment Violet opens the door
She seems surprised
Oh no
Shit
didn't know he would call you
God, you must think |'m a total nuisance
Not exactly
'm sorry,  usually would call Rajeev, but  didn't know what to do so  called Mr
Bianchinni
He said you lost something
Yeah, come on in
She steps back and Corky walks inside
'  - Violet leads her through the apartment
It is expensively furnished with very masculine tastes; a lot of gray and black leather
was doing some dishes and just as pulled the stopper my earring fell in
Corky looks at her blankly
It's one of my favorites
That's why  got upset
know it probably seems ridiculous to you
An eyebrow goes up
'm sorry, look, forget it shouldn't have called
told Bianchinni  would take a look
Is it that sink
Violet nods
She opens the sink cabinet and pulls out a pair of channel locks from her back pocket
The teeth of the channel locks open and bite onto the pressure nut
Do you have a pot or a bucket
Sure
She hands one down to her
Corky slides it under the curved pipe
As she works, Corky feels herself staring at Violet, at the hem of her dress curving tightly around her thighs
Water begins to trickle into the pan
The nut slides loose and Corky tips the trap
Water splashes into the pan with a soft metal "tink
" Did you find it
Corky fishes into gray water and pulls out the earring
Violet screams, a huge smile on her face, half-falling as she tries to hug Corky
can't believe it
You did it
Corky leans back under and replaces the trap
Thank you so much
You have to let me pay you something -- No
Mr
Bianchinni asked me to do it
did it
Corky checks the drain by running the water
If you won't take money, how about a drink
It's getting late
You can't work all night
Corky eyes her for a moment
Okay, one drink
What do you want
beer
beer
Of course
She smiles and turns to the bar
Sit down
Corky sits on the black leather couch and Violet returns with two bottles of Heineken
Corky sneers
Thanks again
They clink the bottles and swig
You seem uncomfortable
Do  make you nervous, Corky
No
She looks at Violet, then takes another long pull on the bottle
Thirsty, maybe
Violet smiles, her eyes again talking for her
Curious, maybe
Curious
That's funny, 'm feeling a bit curious myself right now
Violet notices the tattoo on Corky's arm
That's a great tattoo
She reaches over and touches it
Beautiful labrys
Corky is a bit suprised that she knows what it is
She nods, rubbing it as if trying to hide it
Are you surprised that  know what it is
Maybe
have a tattoo, would you like to see it
She moves closer, sliding over the leather cushions as she opens the front of her dress
woman in upstate New York did it for me
She is not wearing a bra
Here
Do you like it
Set against the soft white skin of her breast is a bright green-stemmed violet
It took her all day to do it
She promised me it wouldn't hurt, but it was sore for a long time after couldn't even touch it
Corky looks up from Violet's breast to her dark eyes
But now  love the way it feels
She runs her fingers softly over the slightly scarred skin
Here, touch it
Corky feels the blood pounding in her ears as Violet takes her hand and places it on her breast
What are you doing
Violet looks at her
Isn't it obvious
'm trying to seduce you
Why
Because  want to
've wanted to since  first saw you in the elevator
Corky watches her, trying to figure her out even as her thumb presses into Violet's nipple
Inhaling sharply, Violet closes her eyes; she can feel Corky staring at her
You don't believe me
But  can prove it to you
She takes Corky's wrist and begins pulling her hand down her body
You can't believe me because of what you see
She forces Corky's hand between her legs, up under her dress
But you can believe what you feel
Violet opens her eyes, a wanton smile on her lips
You see
've been thinking about you all day
Corky's forearm flexes and Violet moans
With both hands, Violet takes hold of Corky's forearm
You planned this whole thing
Violet's head swims; she is unable to breathe
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you
If  say yes, will you take your hand away
No
yes
Now it is Corky who smiles
Violet shivers, her thighs rubbing, her hips thrusting against Corky's hand
Please, Corky
please
Her eyes barely open
kiss me
In a single motion, Corky takes hold of the back of her neck and covers Violet's open mouth with her own
With her hand still stuffed between Violet's legs, Corky lays her back onto the couch as the kiss becomes more -- More desperate, more hungry until -- We hear the front door unlock and open
Violet
Violet's eyes pop open and she pushes Corky back
Violet, you home
They scramble to compose themselves
Yeah
In here,
He comes around the corner and in the dim light sees the two figures sitting close on the couch
What's this
He mistakes Corky for a man
What the fuck is this
Violet stands as Caesar barrels toward the couch
didn't expect -- What the fuck is going on
Corky stands and turns, Caesar suddenly realizing that she is a woman
Oh, shit
Caesar, this is Corky
Corky, Caesar
'm sorry, Christ,  thought
it's fucking dark in here
He reaches to the wall for the lights
She is working for Bianchinni
Caesar extends his hand
Oh, right, right
Don mentioned that to me
Hi, welcome to the family
Corky shakes his hand
You're helping Rajeev
No
Rajeev's in India
She's doing the work herself
No shit
Bianchinni hired you
You know he's a good friend of mine
|Family, really
That's what Violet said
He looks at her as if he knows something
So, you just got out
Jesus, Caesar
What
It ain't no big fuckin' deal
know who Don hires
Did you know he did time himself
Corky shakes her head
Thirteen fucking years
See, there ain't no secrets here
Corky doesn't like this man
How many'd you do
Five
He whistles
Not bad
What for
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar
You're right
You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to just hope you understand you're among good people here
He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thick fold of money and peels several hundreds
Corky stares at it
Come on, come on
if you understand what 'm talking about you're going to take the money
if you don't, 'm going to have to worry about you
Corky takes it
Caesar smiles
Good
hate to worry
got ulcers
should be going
What
How about a drink
My brushes,  have to clean my brushes
Thanks, though
Another time
Sure
- Close on the paintbrush, Corky's fingers pushing through and separating the black bristles under the running water
When the brush is clean, she flicks it dry and resets the edge
She goes to the sink to wash her hands when she stops, noticing her left hand
It is the hand that was between Violet's legs
She is about to smell her finger when she sees herself in the mirror
What are you doing
She drops her hand
What am  doing
'm fucking up, that's what 'm doing
She scrubs her hands clean
- It is late, the area burnished with amber street light
Corky walks from the building to her truck
She climbs inside and slides the key into the ignition, when suddenly the passenger door opens and -- Violet gets in
Stunned, Corky stares at her
had to see you
Look,  don't think this is a good idea
wanted to apologize
Don't apologize, please
can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex
Violet smiles
'm not apologizing for what  did -- She slides across the seat
'm apologizing for what  didn't do
She kisses Corky, and if Corky is trying to resist, we can't tell
The windshield is beginning to steam when Violet, panting, breaks the kiss
Do you have a bed somewhere
Unable to speak, Corky reaches over and starts the engine
'  - The sex
There is nothing flower-scented or out-of-focus about it
It is sweaty, slippery, body-grinding, bed-squeaking lesbian sex -- Pungent and potent -- And when it is over, neither woman can move
Finally, Corky's eyes flutter open
can see again
Violet smiles
Slowly, Corky gets up and goes to the fridge
She grabs a beer and presses it to her sweating forebead
After a moment, she lowers it, gently pressing the cold can elsewhere
Eyes closed, she lets out a long "Ahh
" Violet hears the sizzle-pop of the beer as Corky returns to the bed
She holds the beer to Violet's lips and tilts the can, watching Violet's throat as she drinks
Violet's eyes open
needed that
Tell me about it
Corky hands her the beer as Violet sits up a bit
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he
You have to ask
No
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore
Caesar calls it "The |Business
" How did you meet him
They took over a club  was working at
Caesar started managing it
He's a launderer
Basically
How long have you been with him
Almost five years
Five years is a long time
Yes, it is
Corky stares at her beer
She knows what Violet is thinking
The redistribution of wealth
What
Isn't that what you wanted to know
What  did time for
The redistribution of wealth
That's what  tell someone when 'm trying to get them in my bed
'm already in your bed
My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught
She was always more honest than me
Corky sips her beer
started stealing when  was little
We were piss-poor, which is not an excuse, just a fact
It isn't like her to talk about this, especially with someone she just met
The first time  remember so vividly
bunch of us kids were at Waxman's Drugstore, when Mr
Waxman, who was a mean old prick, always worrying about us robbing him, dropped a roll of quarters
We can almost hear the coins tinkling on the tile floor
can still hear that sound, those quarters, because right then something clicked inside of me
Some instinct took over and as everyone, including Waxman, dove down,  reached up and emptied the cash register
Violet smiles
She likes this woman
gave most of the money to my mom
told her  found it at the trainyard
She was so happy she cried, calling me her lucky charm
Fifteen years later,  guess my luck ran out
Sbe swallows that with beer
Sometimes  tell myself that  didn't have a choice, that stealing was surviving
Usually  can admit that's bullshit
did it because it was a way out
It was easy and  was good at it, real good
She glances at Violet
don't usually talk this much guess  have been rehabilitated
Violet laughs
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to
guess  wanted to
'm glad you did
So am
Corky gets out of her truck carrying her tools
Grinning like someone who has been well-laid, she whistles off to work
- Between the main doors she sees a man
His name is and he is an overdressed accountant
He is very nervous, talking to someone through the intercom
know he's gone
Please
have to talk to you
Fiddling with her keys, Corky recognizes the voice that answers him
(
) What do you want, Shelly
Shelly glances over his shoulder at Corky, answering in a hushed voice
have to leave
Tonight
For a moment the intercom is silent
Then the door buzzes and Shelly pushes inside
Corky follows him to the elevator
- Corky glares at Shelly and begins pumping the trigger of her circular saw
Shelly hides behind his sunglasses, watching the elevator numbers go up
The doors open and he scurries out
- She watches him enter Caesar's apartment, her smile now completely gone
- It is later
Through the wall we listen to the same sound as before of two people making love
We drop down and find Corky's brush, still wet with paint, abandoned in her tray
- Her face glistening with sweat, Violet climaxes, letting the orgasm spread through her like melting butter
had this image of you, inside of me
She flattens her palms against the soft cradle of her pelvis
Like a part of me
As she opens her eyes, we see that her lover is Corky
Violet watches as she gets off the bed and begins to get dressed
You are so beautiful
Corky does not answer as she yanks her pants on
Violet sits up
She can feel that something is wrong
What's wrong
Nothing
Violet pulls the sheet around her
Yes there is
felt it this morning when  brought you the coffee
Shit, here we go
You didn't want to see me, did you
If there is one thing  can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading
What are you afraid of
'm not afraid of anything
don't understand -
know
You can't understand, because we're different, Violet
We're different
We're not that different, Corky
How can you sit in that bed and say that
Because it's the truth
Let me guess
This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside
That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me
Oh no, she's nothing like you
She's a lot smarter than you
Is that what her daddy tells her
know what  am
don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder
What are you saying
That you don't have sex with men
don't
For Christ's sake, Violet
heard you
Thin walls, remember
What you heard wasn't sex
What the fuck was it
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when  have sex, 'm not really having sex
Not real sex
But they're wrong
know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex
What was it then
Work
That knocks Corky back
You made certain choices in your life that you paid for
You said you made them because you were good at something and it was easy
Do you think you're the only one that's good at something
Violet stare pins Corky to the wall
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices
think we're more alike than you want to admit
What about that guy this morning
You mean Shelly
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic
No
Shelly knows what  am
He saw me in a bar with another woman
suppose he just wants to watch
That's all Violet can take
Fuck it
think you better leave
think so, too
Violet turns away
Try not to steal anything on the way out
That stings but Corky walks out without looking back
- It is dark now
Corky is standing above the paint tray that has skinned over
She picks up the brush
It is dry with paint
Shit
She throws the brush across the room
'   - green-and-white street sign juts in the foreground of Caesar's upscale apartment building
The sign reads: "
" - The rusty Chevy glides to a stop in a parking space near the service entrance
In its payload is a boxed bathroom vanity and sink
Corky climbs out of the cab and into the back, unhooking the bungee cords that hold down the boxes
She looks up as a black Lincoln Town Car screeches into a spot not far from her truck
-  get out, leading a fourth, Shelly
He is the only one who seems to notice Corky
They enter the building, the door closing behind them
- Corky's legs jut out from the old wicker vanity as she finishes detaching its anchors and pipe work
She stands, giving it a yank and pulling it away from the wall, when voices begin to filter in from the next-door apartment
She listens - a rising string of warbling sobs drowned out by an angry voice
Shut the fuck up
You piece of shit
We hear a scream
You're going to tell us
You're going to fuckin' tell us
just a matter of fuckin' time
Each sentence is punctuated with grunts and thuds
Where is it
Where the fuck is it
We begin to close in on Corky as she listens to each thud, watching something that disturbs her
You shit
You piece of shit
With each thud the water in the toilet shimmers like a struck cymbal
As we move closer, the sound swells until -- : ' Where blood splatters the toilet, heavy drops hitting the water and spreading like inverted mushroom clouds
Did that hurt
News flash, fucko: 'm just getting started
The angry voice belongs to
Shelly is kneeling in front of the toilet, hands tied behind his back with electrical wire
Johnnie Marzzone is a flashy young man in Armani slacks, silk shirt and silver-tipped cowboy boots
His tie is tucked in, as if torture were a fine-dining experience
Caesar and two other men are crammed in the small bathroom
You got nerve trying to fuck us
Nobody fucks me
Nobody fucks my father
Nobody
Nobody
Shelly screams as Jobnnie repeatedly rams his face into the toilet
Whoa, whoa
Come on, he's making too much noise
You hear that, bitch
Be quiet
Here, put this in his mouth
Caesar hands a towel to Johnnie, who stuffs it into Shelly's mouth
'  - Like Corky, Violet can hear the beating
She is trying to block it out but cannot
Standing at the bar, she runs the blender, grinding ice cubes, trying to drown out the sounds of the bathroom
The bathroom door opens
Prick
can go all night
All night
Caesar steps out, shutting the door, masking the sounds behind him
Violet moves toward him
Caesar, 'm leaving
What
Oh, come on,  didn't use one of the good towels
The door opens again as someone else steps out
Caesar, 'm serious
This is too much
have to get out of here
Why
'Cause you know him
She nods
You women are so fucking sensitive
He takes hold of her
But  don't want you to go
like you here
You know this isn't easy for me, either
He embraces her
Over his shoulder she sees in the hallway, staring at her
He is an older man, hair graying, built like a fireplug
Sinewy mass strains at his Brooks Brothers suit
Now why don't you go watch some or something
Are you okay, Violet
Mickey, why is Johnnie here
You know how  feel about that fucking psycho
Mickey continues to stare at Violet, who looks up at him with her big doe eyes
Caesar, didn't  tell you to get something
Sure, Mickey
Sure
He goes to the kitchen
Mickey moves closer to Violet, lifting her chin the way a father would do to his little girl
You shouldn't have to see this
Why don't you get out of here
Go for a walk
Caesar wants me to stay
Don't worry about Caesar
'll handle Caesar
You just get out of here, okay
She smiles
Thanks, Mickey
Caesar returns from the kitchen
He is holding a pair of tin snips
Mickey takes them
Thanks,
Now let's end this thing
Violet watches them return to the bathroom
- Mickey takes off his coat and hands it to a large man named He slaps Johnnie on the back
Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay
Johnnie hits Shelly once more
Prick
Johnnie checks his hair in the mirror, carefully
Then he begins putting on the rings he had removed for the beating
Mickey kneels down next to Shelly's ear and motions to Lou, who lifts Shelly's bound arms
Shelly, 'm going to ask you ten times
You understand
Ten times
Mickey grabs Shelly's pinky finger, putting it between the metal blades
One
Where is our money
Shelly whimpers, red-faced and sobbing
There is a sick crunch and Shelly howls into his gag as his pinky finger bounces to the floor amid the expensive leather footwear
Aw
Christ
We hear Caesar retrieve a tissue and his hand enters the frame, scooping up the pinky
He plunks the severed finger into the toilet and it sinks to the bottom
Caesar drops the toilet seat down and flushes
-   - Corky can't stand it anymore
She throws her tools down, leaves the bathroom and finds -- Violet waiting in the main room
Both women stand apart in silence
Violet seems on the verge of saying something but doesn't know how to start
Her lip begins to quiver; her eyes search the room, returning to Corky each time
The violence in the next room can still be heard
Violet
Are you all right
Almost unnoticeably, Violet shakes her bead
Corky puts her arm around her
Come on
Let's go
- It is the kind of bar businessmen drink at in the afternoon
Dark wood and padded leather
The bartender, joking with a cluster of men, does not notice Corky as she moves up to the bar
Excuse me
The bartender glances over
Draft beer and a
Corky eyes the men, who stare into their drinks
The bartender says nothing as he puts the drinks in front of her
Corky heads for her table, ignoring the whispers and snickers
Corky and Violet, the only women in the room, sit close together at a far corner table
Violet's voice is hushed
Shelly was skimming from the business
He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out
He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him
Even though he knew about you
Yes
He was in love with you, right
That's what he told himself
But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar
He wanted what Caesar had
That's how they are
understand them
She glances around the room; a man at the bar smiles at her
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar
He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out
Sounds like he wanted to get caught
Maybe he did
He would brag to me all the time
He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him
Not like  do
Two men sit down near them, laughing
Caesar lives for these moments
He tells me it's just the business, but know it's more than that
He likes it
The violence
'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars
He says they remind him who he his
They're all like that
Except maybe Mickey
Mickey
He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be
|But Mickey doesn't like it like they do
suppose that's why he's good at it
Violet stares at her glass, at the melting ice
used to be able to block it out
would tell myself that  wasn't really there so nothing really mattered
But  can't do it anymore
She downs the last of her drink
've been making the same mistake Shelly made
But now  know what | want
She turns to Corky
want out
want a new life see what 've been waiting for, but need you, Corky
For what
You made a choice once
Do you think you would make that same choice again
What choice
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register
Corky stares at her, knowing where this is going
She glances around the crowded bar
Not here
- Corky's truck sits in a gravel parking lot
'  - Through the back window of the truck, Violet and Corky are silhouettes against the street light
Caesar is going to get the money and bring -- How much money
Shelly said it was over two million dollars
Corky quietly swallows that pill
It begins to rain
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Do you have any idea what you are saying
You are asking me to help you fuck the mob
Violet nods
These people are serious, Violet
If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly
They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules
You fuck them, you've got to do it right
That's why  need your help
You said you were good
am, but
She knows Violet is challenging her
All right, let's say for the moment that  believe everything you are saying
You think 'm lying
didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are
It would have been easy to set Shelly up
You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment
Violet stares, her face poker-blank
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me
Is that what you think
'm just making a point
You have no idea what you're asking
How much trust two people need to do something like this
She moves closer to Violet, the sound of the rain beating against the metal cab
For me, stealing is a lot like sex
Two people that want the same thing sit in a room and they talk, they start to plan and it's like flirting, a kind of foreplay, because the more they talk about it, the wetter they get
She stops
The difference is,  can have sex with someone  just met, someone hardly know, but to steal  need to know someone like  know myself
Do you think you know me like that
think
They are close enough to kiss
We're going to find out
Corky pulls back
But first,  want to see this money
'  - Violet springs from the couch as the front door crashes open, Caesar charging in
He is doubled over, clutching something to his stomach
He rushes to the kitchen, dumping a bloody bundle into the double sink
There is blood everywhere, smeared up and down Caesar's front
Oh my God
Violet takes a step toward him, unsure of what has happened
Don't worry
It ain't mine
He pulls a bottle of whiskey and a glass from the cupboard
Caesar, what happened
It was unbelievable
Un-fucking- believable
He pours himeslf a shot, belting it back
Goddammit, look at this shirt
It's ruined
He begins unbuttoning the bloody shirt
It started when Shelly took us to the money
tell you, Mickey Malnato knows his shit, he does
Shelly takes us right there
He throws down another shot
So Shelly's down on his knees and he's pulling out this bag of money from a safe in the floor and 'm staring at it like "holy fuck
" mean, look at it -- He tears open the bloody bag, wet money bricks spilling out
And all  can think is how the fuck did he do this when - Bang
Johnnie caps him
Blood sprays everywhere, all over the money
We've no idea if this is even all of it
Caesar is exasperated
And right then  go through the roof and - Boom
belt the dumb fuck as hard as  can
didn't care whose son he was,  just wanted to hit him again
Knock some sense into that dumb son of a bitch
He looks at the pile of bloody money
Just look at this mess  got to deal with
What are you going to do with it
told them to run it through the cycles
But  guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up
Searching through a sink cabinet, he can't find what he needs
Where the hell's the laundry detergent
Ummm
in the linen closet
Caesar walks down the ball to the bathroom
Violet's eyes do not move from the pile of money
Corky seems to come from nowhere
She whispers
Come to my place in the morning
Early, okay
Violet nods
- Corky's hands twitch, and then flex against the ropes that bind them
reflex echoes through her body, muscles spasm and limbs jerk against their bonds
As if in a dream, she struggles, trying to get free, fighting toward the edge of consciousness until -- She seems to succumb, slipping back into stillness
We move toward her face, her closed eyes as we again hear the voices in her head
(
) You're having second thoughts
'  - Violet is on the bed, Corky at the window
no
She turns to Violet
You said he washed the money
Yeah
Then what
Exactly
He hung it up
What
To let it dry
She begins to focus on the memory
It was unreal
Moving in on her face
: Benjamin Franklin's face on a hundred-dollar bill
'  - Franklin's face rotates as we pull back, seeing rows of bills carefully paper-clipped to lines of string
(
) Hundreds, paper-clipped everywhere like leaves
Eyes filled with green, Violet turns inside the laundry lines of money until she sees Caesar
Wearing his undershirt, he is across the room standing at the ironing board, ironing every single bill
He seems to have one eye on her, one eye on his work
(
) Then one by one, he ironed all of it
He sprays starch across several bills and presses the steaming iron to them
(
) Did he sleep
- Violet is in bed, unable to sleep, listening to the machine- shuffle of Caesar's bill counter
(
) No
But neither did
We move past her, floating toward the wall
(
) All night long  listened to that sound
- We drift across Caesar's desk, past bricks of bound bills, as Caesar folds the paper tape around another stack
(
) What sound
He hits the counter again and we hear the sound, now very loud as hundreds blur by, fluttering beneath us
(
) The sound of money
The sound rolls into thunder -- '  - That seems to shake the apartment
And where is it now
In his office
saw it this morning
- Violet cautiously enters the office with a cup of coffee
Working furiously at the computer, Caesar jumps when he sees her, bloodshot eyes animal-wide
He checks his watch as she sets the coffee in front of him
need to go to the store
He nods automatically, back in his work, as she sees the briefcase filled with perfect rows of hundreds
(
) It's in a case, on his desk
(
) Does the case lock
We see the open top with its silver flip-over locks
'  - Violet is trying to remember
Yes
Good
Corky begins to pace, ordering the information in her head
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie
Johnnie
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other
Like each other
They hate each other
Why
It started way before  was around
think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot
But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father
Who is Gino
Violet suddenly feels that she has made a mistake
Gino Marzzone
Marzzone
As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family
That's his brother
shit
Corky covers her mouth
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money
Yeah
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone
Yeah
Sweet Jesus
Eyes wide, she paces, pulling at her lip, mumbling
Suddenly she freezes as it clicks into place
She looks at Violet
It's perfect
She's pacing again
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment
It's a big deal, isn't it
That means Caesar will be ready
He doesn't want to look like an idiot
Gino has been there before
Yeah, twice
What happened
Not much, really
Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment
|The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear
Something occurs to Corky
Does Johnnie hit on you
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels
Has Caesar ever seen him
He does it right in front of him
It's getting better and better
Keep going
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much
He gets right to the point
Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left
What did Gino drink
Scotch, Glenlivet
remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it
Corky smiles, the wheels rolling
All right
She turns from the window and gets onto the bed
have an idea to make this work
'  - Violet is getting dressed, lining her lips with lip-pencil
(
) You'll go back and get ready, take your time, make it real
As she works on her face, we see the room behind her and the discarded dresses scattered about
(
) The more attractive you are, the more believable it will be
'  - Corky breaks her thought-train
What time did you say they would be there
The plane is in at seven, so 'd say about eight
Any bodyguards
Gino travels with a big man named Roy
Caesar calls him the driver
Fine
- Caesar again checks his watch
(
) At some point Caesar is going to quit
'd guess sometime around six, making sure he's got time to get ready
The watch reads 6:10
Caesar rubs his eyes, his temples
- Violet is at the bar in a sexy dress and high heels
Un-fucking-believable, what this guy did
Shelly is one smart-ass mothefucker,  mean, he was one smart- ass motherfucker
He laughs as Violet smiles, handing him an enormous drink
(
) As soon as he is done, you'll be right there to put a big drink in his hand
He takes the drink
(
) We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again
Poor boy, has to work so hard
She gives him a woman's sympathy pout; he knows what it, loves it anyway
Smiling, he slides his hand down over her ass
You look good enough to eat
She smiles and waits for the kiss she knows is coming
'  - Both women are starting to feel it, to believe it
Where will you be
Waiting in the apartment next door
Corky sits on the floor of the dark apartment
She has taken off her boots, which are beside her
(
) Waiting for what
Through the wall we can hear the shower
(
) For the shower
That will be our signal
Corky opens a thin box filled with needle-thin lock picks
She selects several and slips them into her multi-pierced ears like earrings
(
) When he's done with his shower, you will go to the bar
- In slow motion, Caesar drops the shower plunger and water chokes from the faucet
- Behind the bar, Violet pulls out the bottle of Glenlivet
(
) You'll get out the Scotch that Gino drinks
Violet steps out from the bar, her eyes on the bedroom, when the bottle slips from her hands
We watch it slowly fall -- (
) And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands
-- and shatter against the hardwood floor
(
) An accident
Shit
Oh shit
Caesar yells from the bathroom
(
) What happened
- Hearing Caesar, Corky gets up, moving quietly toward the door
(
) What the fuck was it
Violet
- Caesar enters, a towel wrapped around him, hair still dripping
, what
You can't hear me
Violet looks terribly upset as she begins to clean up
Caesar, it slipped
was trying to get ready
Caesar realizing what happened
Oh, fucking Christ
You gotta be kidding me
He rushes at her
Fuck
Fuck
How did you
Awwww goddammit
'm sorry
It was an accident
She stands up
Don't worry, 'll get some more
There's no time
Don't be silly, Caesar
It'll take five minutes
She turns him back toward the bedroom
'll clean this up and be back before you're even dressed
- Violet opens her door, stepping into the hall where Corky is waiting
(
) When you open the door, 'll be there
They pass each other in silence, Violet stepping out as Corky slips in
(
) What if he sees you
(
) He won't
- Caesar is working intensely on his fingernails
We glide over a set of gleaming metal manicure tools
We see his hand as he delicately applies a coat of clear polish to a nail
Through the open door, we see Corky moving almost casually across the living room
'  - Corky is looking for something
You can't know for certain that he won't see you
Trust me, Violet
She finds a black duffel bag from one of her tool buckets
'm just asking, what if
If he does
Corky slips her hand in between the mattress and box spring, pulling out a gun
Then  won't have a choice, will
She tosses the gun on the bed
- The black case is lying on the desk, locked shut
Corky moves around the desk, dropping down behind it
(
) When 'm inside,  will get the money
From her earlobe, she chooses the right pick, sliding out the silver tool
It takes only a second and the first lock pops open
She is working on the other lock when the door is pushed open and Caesar walks in
Corky drops down, grasping for her gun -- As Caesar, wearing only underwear, enters
He blows on the drying polish on his fingernails before delicately selecting a suit from his closet
The gun ready, Corky, pressed against the desk, waits until he leaves
She lets her breath out, then pops the second lock, unzips the black duffel bag and quickly empties the case, filling the bag with fat money bricks
(
) 'm going to need something
Finished, she zips up the bag and looks about
(
) to fill the case
Sbe sees a stack of newspapers hidden near the desk
(
) Yeah, you should hide it near the desk before you leave
She fills the case, then closes it
(
) At that point -- She thumbs the locks shut and they snap, unnaturally loud, into place
'  - They are both on the bed
There is no going back
When  get the Scotch, how do  know you won't take off
The same way 'll know that you went to Scotch
Trust
Their faces are close, eyes still trying to read each other
still don't see how 'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment
Everyone will think did it
Not Caesar
Why
Because of what you are going to tell him
You have to make it as real as you can
The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan
'  - The door bursts open
Violet enters quickly, carrying a bottle in a thin brown bag
(
) If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to
Shit, 'm sorry
Caesar wanders out, tightening his tie
She looks at her watch
They were early
What are you talking about
They just left, didn't they
What are you, drunk
He smiles, grabbing the bottle from her
You mean they weren't up here
No
They're still on their way
That doesn't make any sense
Why
Because  just saw Johnnie downstairs
Caesar turns
What
was getting out of the car when saw him in the Mercedes
It couldn't have been
It was him
'm positive
It's impossible
Caesar,  know Johnnie
It was him
screamed when  saw him
couldn't believe  missed them
knew you were going to be upset so  thought 'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch
honked a couple of times but he didn't stop
She watches him, her words caving in around him
But Gino's plane doesn't get in for another half-hour
Violet thinks
Actually,  didn't see Gino in the car
His eyes dart
His forehead beads with sweat
He turns toward the office
'  - Violet is staring at Corky's mouth
If Caesar hates Johnnie like you say, then the second he opens the case he'll know, in his gut, that Johnnie just fucked him
He'll realize that he has no choice
He can't touch Gino or Johnnie
There's only one way out
She pauses
He'll have to run
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money
You'll be clean and we'll be rich
- Caesar stands over the desk, afraid to open the case
'  - Jesus, that's beautiful
Thank you
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass
It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart
She looks dead at Violet
had a partner and she fucked me
won't
think we're going to find out
- The key turns and the locks pop
When Caesar sees the newspaper, the whole world begins to spin
Caesar
His chest collapses onto itself while his hands ball into fists
No no no no
She moves around the side of the desk and sees the newspaper
Oh God
He slams the case shut, his head hanging down
After a moment he looks at her, like a little boy about to cry
've been set up
He seems ready to scream but can't say anything
Johnnie
The name is like water hitting hot oil
That fuck
That rat-fuck
Little shit rat-fuck
He starts punching the desk, each blow harder than the last
- Corky can hear him pounding
She looks down and smiles
Between her legs is the open bag stuffed with money
'  - Caesar is choking on his own rage
Why
Why would Johnnie do this
Jesus Christ, Violet
Open your fucking eyes
Johnnie hates me like hate him
He starts to pound his fists against his own head
hate that little fuck
hate him
hate him
should've done him
But you know he did it
So what
So fucking what
Use your head, Violet
The money is gone
Gino is coming here to get it
You think he's going to believe me if  tell him his piss-hole son stole it
Is that what you think
don't
You know what  think think 'm a dead man
'm one in the brain
That's what  think
Caesar, what are we going to do
He grabs hold of his chair, using it to support himself know what he wants me to do
He wants me out of here
He wants me to run
She watches him, his body rocking against the chair
If  run, then everyone will think took the money and he walks away with two million clean
The words squeeze out like tears
God,  can see him right now driving to get Gino
can hear him laughing, fucking laughing, laughing at me
He swings the swivel chair over his head and smashes it down on the desk
Again and again
Laughing at me
Laughing at me
The chair falls and he stands alone, covering his face to hide his tears
She goes to hold him
Don't touch me
He backs into the corner of the room
Just leave me alone
got to think
Violet watches him trying to wipe the tears and sweat from his face
Got to think this through
Caesar, maybe we should run -- Violet, please
mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late -- Goddammit, Violet
Would you just leave me the fuck alone
Please
Leave
Now
All right, Caesar
- Violet enters, closing the door quietly behind her
She looks at the wall, then goes to the bed and picks up the phone
As she dials, we move along the phone cord, following it down to the jack in the wall
- We move out from another jack, following a different cord
Corky is sitting with her back to the wall
The black phone beside her barely rings once before she answers
She waits, saying nothing
(
) It's me
What happened
Violet whispers, her hand cupped over the mouthpiece
He totally freaked
've never seen him like this
He's out of his fucking mind
(
) That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie
Believes it
Jesus, it's driving him crazy
He wants to kill him don't know, Corky,  don't know what he is going to do
'm getting nervous, really nervous
- It's all right, Violet
It's working
All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does
(
) What if he doesn't run
That means he probably will kill Johnnie
(
) Oh, Christ,  got to get out of here
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it
You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out
- okay, all right
(
) We're almost there, Violet
just hang on
Violet hears him
He's coming
She hangs up quickly just as Caesar bursts in
got it
know what  got to do
got to get the money
The money
The money's gone
No
Johnnie's got it
All  got to do is get it back
But it could be anywhere
He didn't have that much time
He had to pick up Gino
bet you he's got it with him
bet it's in the car
- Corky presses against the wall, trying to hear
'  - Caesar is pacing
He didn't see you, did he
No
See, right now he doesn't know that know, that's why he put the paper in the case
He wants me to hand the case to Gino
Then there is no doubt it was me
Gino will put a bullet in me himself
But it ain't going to happen
won't let it
Johnnie ain't going to fuck me
Not like this
No way
This is insane
She throws open her closet
What are you doing
She grabs a suitcase from under the bed
'm leaving
This is crazy
don't want to be involved
don't want anything to do with this shit
She starts yanking the dresses from the closet
You can't leave
The hell  can't
need you
Bullshit
You don't need me
You've never needed me
can't help you
Understand
have to get out
Violet,  won't let you leave
She turns and sees that he is holding a gun
If you're not with me, Violet, then have to assume you're against me
Caesar, this is crazy
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't
Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident
Maybe you didn't
Now it is her turn to feel the world spin
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out
You don't, you can't believe that 've seen the way he looks at you
He's always wanted you
Maybe two million dollars finally bought you
She slaps him hard
He stares at her
'm sorry, Violet, but it has to be this way
He moves past her, picks up the dresses and returns them to the closet
hope you understand
want to trust you,  want to believe you, but  don't have any other choice
He shuts the closet
- Caesar is at the bar, drinking the Scotch
The gun in front of him
Across the room, Violet sits, staring holes through him
They wait in silence
You sure you don't want a drink
Violet says nothing
- In the dark, Corky sits, her face, her posture very similar to Violet's
She is concentrating, her mind somewhere else, when the door buzzer sounds
She turns her head and hears Caesar faintly answering the intercom
Corky stands just as -- '  - Violet stands
Caesar faces her for a moment, then shoves the gun into his belt behind his back
- Corky watches through the door peep as three men pass by
'  - There is a knock and Caesar opens the door
is an old Italian whose face is a mask of irritated indifference
, his enormous driver, is behind him
Caesar smiles, greeting them in Italian with open arms
Johnnie is the last inside
He has tape over his broken nose
He smiles and hugs Caesar
You shouldn't have hit me
You want to get into this now
No, no, Caesar
Not now
He smiles again, patting him on the shoulder, then throwing a fake punch
Caesar sees Gino with his bright Italian smile, flattering Violet, kissing her
Hey, Caesar
You take care of this girl, or  find out
You are as radiant as ever, Violet
As he bends to kiss her hand, she sees Caesar watching them
Glenlivet, right, Gino
'll have whatever Violet's drinking
'm not drinking
Then neither will
This makes Violet very uncomfortable
No, 'll have a Tanqueray and tonic
Caesar, make that two TNTs
Caesar's hand shakes as he pours Gino's Scotch
- Pacing in her socks, Corky tries to think through several possible situations
She stops, staring at the bag of money
The idea of its sitting out in the open suddenly bothers her
'  - Caesar hands Violet and Johnnie a drink
He stares at her
She stares back
Salud, eh
Roy, Violet, Pop, Caesar
Caesar watches Johnnie, suspecting everything he does
Johnnie reaches into his pocket and takes out a cellular phone
No, Johnnie
No goddamned phones
Not now
Pop
Caesar, come here
Sit
We talk now
You too, Johnnie
Each man sits on either side of Gino
Caesar, look at me
Johnnie tell me what happened
Caesar, you gotta do me a favor, a personal favor
For me, eh
You gotta start respecting Johnnie the way you respect me
You understand
Good
Caesar sees Johnnie smiling at him, but when Gino turns, the smile disappears
And you, Johnnie
You gonna stop acting stupid
You gotta earn this respect that Caesar's gonna give
You understand
Good
Done
Now, where's my money
- Corky drops a hefty bag, knotted tight, into an open five- gallon bucket of paint
As she picks up a paint stick, we see a second bag beside another bucket
She pushes the first bag down until it disappears, enveloped by the milk-white liquid
'  - Caesar puts the briefcase onto the coffee table
Gino looks up at Caesar, very serious, with his hand on the case
We know how this was done, eh
Yeah,  know
He looks dead at Johnnie
It won't happen again, eh
Caesar shakes his head
Good
Gino throws down the last of the Scotch
Done
We go now
Jesus Christ, Pop
You got two hours until your plane leaves
Gino checks his watch, shouting in Italian
Johnnie shouts back until Gino throws up his hands, refusing to listen
Caesar
He gestures to his empty glass, then folds his arms, leaning back
Caesar gets the bottle
So Caesar, what did it total out at
Two point one seventy-six
Johnnie whistles as Caesar pours Gino another Scotch
Unbelievable
Can you believe that, Violet
Hey, Johnnie
In Italian tells him to shut up
Come on, Pop, all  want to know is one thing
Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it bet it wasn't a big deal
Was it, Caesar
What's that, Johnnie
The money  bet it was nothing to get it clean, after you made such a fucking big deal
Johnnie, what did  say
Pop, this is important to me
It's a simple question
if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it
Where is this going, Johnnie
Just admit it, Caesar
Admit what
That you overreacted
That you lost it
Not me
It was your mistake
Caesar sees it so clearly now
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way,  can play it this way
You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case
Caesar
Shut up, Violet
This is between me and Johnnie
He pushes the case toward him
You want to do this now, let's do it
Open the case
Open the fucking case
Johnnie stares at him, feeling that something is very wrong
That's right,  know
fucking know
Know what
Open the case
All right
Where's the key
You don't need a key
He tries but it's locked
How the fuck can  open it
The same way you did before
What are you talking about
Caesar smiles and tosses the key onto the table
There you go, Johnnie
He reaches for the key
Caesar stands up and gives Violet his drink
Get me another
He can see the fear on her face as she goes to the bar
Time drips
The key turns
One lock pops
Then the other
Tbe case opens like a scream and Johnnie sees the newspaper
What the
Before anybody can move, Caesar whips around with his gun
Roy jumps off his stool, his drink crashing to the floor
Don't
Don't fucking move
Nobody can believe what is happening
Caesar
What is this
Ask Johnnie
Ask your rat-fuck son
What the fuck
Caesar levels the gun
You don't think 'll do it, do you
think you're fucking crazy
Where is it
Where's what
The money
Caesar,  don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun -- He stands up
Sit down
He does
Caesar
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and  can prove it
Violet
She doesn't know what to say
Tell them
Tell them
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says
This isn't happening
Boom
Caesar blows a hole in the couch right between Johnnie's legs
Johnnie screams
The next one blows off your dick
You're a dead man
fucking dead man
Where is it
Enough
Gino jumps up
No, Gino
You aim a gun at me
Do you know who  am
am Gino Marzzone
You understand
He starts walking toward Caesar
Roy moves around for a good angle
Sit down, Gino
No, Caesar, gimme the gun
Stay away
He backs up as Gino walks straight to him
We're family, Caesar
No
Gimme the gun
can't
can't
Give it to me
He reaches up and takes bold of the barrel
Caesar looks resigned as he shuts his eyes
Good man
Close on Gino's hand holding the gun barrel as -- Caesar fires
From behind the gun we watch Gino's grip yanked free, time melting away as he falls, blood bubbling from his chest, his eyes wide in disbelief
His body hits the floor and the room erupts
Roy dives, drawing his gun as Caesar continues to fire, pumping the trigger
Violet drops behind the bar as Jobnnie screams, falling towards his father
Blood spurts from Roy as two bullets hit, his gun clattering and sliding across the floor
Johnnie lunges at Caesar as Caesar turns and fires, hitting Johnnie everywhere; blood and meat spray and speckle everything around him
- The gun continues to fire as Corky clutches the phone, whispering
This is an emergency
'  - Crunched down behind the bar, Violet listens to the only sound, repeating in the unnatural quiet: Click
Click
Click
Rising, she peers over the edge of the bar
Caesar is standing in the aftermath
His gun is still aimed at Johnnie as he pulls the trigger over and over
The bodies are still, blood silently pooling around them
Blinking the sweat from his eyes, Caesar sees Violet
had to do it, Violet
You saw it
had no choice
It was Johnnie
That lying fuck
He made me do it
He looks down at Jobnnie, hate rising like bile
You lying rat-fuck
You think you can set me up
Is that what you think
You stupid fuck
Kicking the body, be causes a series of sickening wet noises
'm a dead man
'm a dead man
Guess again, fuck-face
Who's dead
Who's the dead lying rat-fuck
Take another guess, take another fucking guess
He stops, panting, unable to catch his breath
Violet is afraid to even look at him
Blood creeps along the edge of the floorboards
Caesar tries to clear his head, mopping the sweat from his face
He bends down and starts searching Johnnie's pockets
He finds his keys
What are you doing
Lost in thought, he goes to Gino
Throwing open the coat, he sees the airplane ticket
There is a bullet hole in it
He checks the times and then his watch
maybe three hours
Caesar, what are you going to do
What do you think we're going to do
We have to find the money
What
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone
No  didn't
Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here
Then they never showed up
What happened to them
don't know
We may never know, but 'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family
He smiles
All part of the business
He picks up Roy's gun and stuffs it in his belt
We just got to find the money
Once we do, everything is going to be all right
In the distance, the wail of a police siren can be heard
- Through the window they see a squad car, lights blaring, roll up in front of the building
'  - Oh, no
He turns back to the carnage
Fuck
Caesar, what are we going to do
They're just cops
Stall them as long as you can
Caesar flies into action
Grunting, he hauls Gino's body up, drags it to the bathroom and throws it into the tub
He returns for Johnnie's body
- Standing near the bathroom, Corky hears the metal echo of the tub
Looking at her tub, she imagines what he is doing
Through the wall, she hears the door buzzer
'  - The buzzer sounds again as Violet sees him lift Roy's body
Answer it
He heads back to the bathroom, dropping Roy onto the other two
The three bloody bodies fill the tub
We see Johnnie's arm hanging over the edge as Caesar snaps the shower curtain around, hiding them
Hello
#1 (
) This is the police, ma'am
She cuts them off using the intercom
The police
Over her shoulder she sees Caesar moving the furniture, clearing the area around the heavy bloodstains
#1 (
) We had a report of gunfire, so if you could -- Gunfire
Is this a joke
Violet sees Caesar hurry to his office
#1 (
) No joke, ma'am
Please open the door
How do  know you are cops
- Caesar seizes the beautiful oriental rug in his office and yanks it up, overturning furniture
Dragging it out, he slams the door behind him
- Violet looks at Caesar, who is working with the calm, single- minded focus of a machine
#1 (
) Ma'am, you have to open the door
All right
She buzzes them in as Caesar throws the rug like someone making a bed, letting it fall to the floor and cover most of the blood
- The cops are waiting for the elevator
After a moment, the door slides open
'  - Violet moves away from the intercom as Caesar begins arranging the furniture on the rug
Get me a wet towel
His words push her to the bathroom
- Stuffing a towel into the sink, she turns on the water
She does not even look at the shower curtain
- The elevator opens and the cops step out
'  - Caesar grabs the television remote, hits "on" and jacks the volume until it is obviously loud
Violet returns and he snatches the towel from her
As the two cops walk down the hall, they hear the television
They look at each other, already knowing what happened
'  - Like a maniac, Caesar wipes at any blood still visible until there is a knock on the door
He grabs Violet by the arm
If you're thinking about doing something stupid, remember  just killed Gino Marzzone
You understand what that means
She nods
They're just cops
There is another knock, much louder
Violet goes to the door as Caesar rips off his blood-soaked jacket and shirt
He drops down behind the bar Leaving the chain on, Violet opens the door
Tbe cops smile
#1 See
We're for real
'm sorry, it's just you hear stories
#1 You did the right thing
Crouching, Caesar wipes vigorously at the blood on his hands and face
Violet opens the door
Caesar crams the bloody wad under the bar sink
Just as the cops enter the living room, Caesar stands, looking comfortable in no shirt, with ice cubes in his hands
Hey, hey, Chicago's finest
He plunks the ice into a glass and walks from behind the bar How's it going tonight, fellas
#1 Pretty good, sir
Caesar turns his head
Huh
'm sorry,  can only hear in this ear
Tbe cops look at each other again
Wiping his wet hand on his pants, Caesar shakes hands with each of them
'm Caesar and this here is my Violet
They smile at Violet as Caesar puts his arm around her
Violet said something about gunshots
Violet sees the gun wedged in the back of his belt
#2 Yes, sir, a neighbor in the building called in
#1 think we know what happened
#2 It was probably just the television
The television
He looks at Violet
Honey, why didn't you say something
Turn it off
Violet walks across the rug and turns off the
Fuck, this happened before
It's this shitty ear
Born with it
The batteries wore out in my aid
'm sorry
#1 It's all right, sir
#2 No big deal
Hey, can  get you guys a beer
#1 Not on duty, sorry
Oh, right
#2 But, uh, would you mind if  used your bathroom
Caesar's face tightens
Yeah, why not
It's right there
#2 Thanks
He heads for the john
Violet watches Caesar back up to the bar, moving behind it
'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay
#1 Go right ahead, sir
Cop #2 enters, walking right past the shower curtain
We hear his sigh as he starts to piss
- Cop #1 walks onto the rug, looking around, turning to Violet
#1 This is a beautiful place
thank you
She stares at his shoes on the rug
Watching everything, Caesar takes a sip of his drink
He slips his gun out and holds it at his side
- There is a bulge in the shower curtain where we imagine Johnnie's arm is hanging
Slowly we slide down to the bottom edge of the plastic curtain, where a drip of blood forms and -- Plips into a small red spot on the white tile floor
- Close on the heel of the cop's black shoe, where we can almost see the blood seeping up through the oriental rug
#1 Is this a condo
Violet nods
Everyone turns when Cop #2 busts out of the bathroom
#2 Okay, let's roll
Cop #1 walks across the rug to the hardwood floor
He turns to Caesar
#1 Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around
Good idea
- Corky hears the cop say goodbye to Violet
The door closes
She isn't sure what she should do
Over her shoulder, she notes the bucket of paint
She lets the cops leave
'  - Caesar puts on a new shirt, the gun stuffed in his pants
Let's go
- Corky rises at the sound of Caesar's door closing
We track her along the wall to the foyer as she follows the faint sounds of Caesar and Violet's footsteps
- As they pass by, Violet looks up to the door of the empty apartment, straight at the peephole
Corky is pressed against the door, eye at the peephole
She sees that Violet is afraid as the two women seem to speak to each other with their eyes
shit
- Caesar is on his knees, searching under the seats of Johnnie's Mercedes
Unable to find the money, he is ready to snap
From the main doors, Corky slips out of the building
Hiding behind a column, she sees Violet and Caesar across the lot
Corky moves behind the parked cars, the gun squeezed in her hand
Violet edges away, on the verge of running, looking toward the busy street
Standing, Caesar pounds on the car
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Caesar, someone could see us out here
Ignoring her, be tries to think
Get in
Still too far from them to do anytbing, Corky sees Caesar slam the trunk
Get in
It's got to be at his house
That's the only other place it could be
Violet looks around the lot, looking for some way out
Violet
Now
Corky can only watch as Violet gets in and the car rips away
- Alone, Corky stands over the bucket of paint
She kicks it with her boot-toe
Two million dollars, Cork
Two million dollars
She sighs, wondering how long she can make herself wait
'  - The  is parked in front
'  - Close on Caesar, as he rakes his sweaty hair back, his face knotted in torment
Okay,  come in
He turns as if he just came in through the front door
We see Johnnie's home has been laid to waste
The furniture is broken, cushions split open, pictures shattered, holes punched in the drywall -- even the carpeting has been torn up
Caesar doesn't look much better
've got the money
Huddled in a corner, Violet watches him
can't wait to see the look on Caesar's face when he finds out
Caesar moves from the front door, trying to get into Johnnie's head
Now  don't have much time
He takes a couple of steps into the room
Got to put it someplace safe
He looks at a closet
It's gutted, searched 10 times already
put it
couple more uneasy steps and he looks at a large over-turned rolltop desk
got it
He starts looking around the room as if he is seeing for the first time that it is destroyed
He is near the breaking point
His voice cracks
There is nowhere else to look
Where did  put it
He explodes
terra cotta lamp sails across the room
Where's my fucking money
Fucking cocksuckers
Where the fuck is it
He smashes his forehead into the wall, denting the drywall
Ow
He holds his head, sinking to the ground
She sits next to him, putting a hand lightly on his shoulder
It's not here, Caesar
Where, then
don't know
it could be anywhere
We don't even know if he was alone
Please, Caesar, we don't have much time
Let's get out of here
He knows what he has to do
Digging through the debris, he finds the phone
What are you doing
We're going to need some time
Who are you going to call
Already dialing, he does not answer Caesar
Ceaar takes a deep breath, mustering composure
(
) Yeah
Hey, Mickey
Oh, God
(
) Caesar
What the fuck time is it
Mick,  know it's late, but there is a problem
They haven't shown up yet
(
) What
They ain't there
No
don't know where they are even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer
(
) Okay
Let me call around
'll see what  can do
Don't go anywhere, okay
Okay, sure, Mick
(
) Caesar, you still got the money
Caesar looks at Violet
Yeah, Mick
've got the money
'm staring right at it
(
) Good
Sit tight
'll call you
He hangs up
'  - Caesar drags himself in
Violet closes the door behind them
Caesar moves into the room where it happened
He is dizzy and confused and does not want to be here
Violet turns him around
'll start packing
You know what you have to do
She turns him toward the bathroom
He nods
can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan
need plastic bags
tape and rope
Just hurry
Nodding, he heads for the kitchen
- Violet enters and goes straight for the phone
She looks at the blank wall as she dials
Please, Corky
The phone rings
When Corky answers, Violet almost collapses with relief
Oh, thank God
'm still here
was so afraid you
You don't quit on me, Violet, and won't quit on you
- box of Hefty bags tucked under his arm, a coil of clothesline in his hand, Caesar searches through several cabinets
- Violet glances at the door
Corky, it worked
He's going to run
He needs to take care of the bodies to buy himself time, but as soon as he leaves, it's over
- Corky falls against the wall
(
) just a little longer and it's ours
- Mumbling to himself, Caesar walks out of the kitchen, heading for the bedroom
- Violet reaches out and touches the wall, as if she were touching Corky
Corky,  have to tell you something - Corky turns to the wall
know, Violet
know
Her fingers gently touch the wall as we travel up and over, where we see they are actually touching the wall in the exact same place
It's why 'm still here
- Suddenly, Violet hears Caesar
(
) Violet
As he opens the door, she slams down the phone
- The line cuts off
- Fear and panic paralyze Violet as Caesar drops everything, grabbing for his gun
Who was that
He levels the gun at her
Who the fuck was that
She stands and be rushes at her, grabbing her by the throat
Was that Mickey
Did you call Mickey
Did you
She shakes her head and he throws her on the bed
The gun aimed at her, he picks up the phone and -- Hits the redial
- Unsure of what happened, Corky hears the phone ring and answers it on reflex
Listening, she waits
- Caesar listens, waiting as long as he can
Mickey
Is that you
- Corky hangs up, jumping away from the wall
- Caesar hits the redial again
- Panicking, Corkydoesn't answer it, but as it rings very loud in the empty apartment, she realizes her mistake
- Turning slowly toward the wall, Caesar hears the phone ringing in the empty apartment
- Corky rips the plug out of the wall
- The line goes dead
Who is that
Who is over there
Tell me
She tries to get away, but he grabs her and slaps her to the ground
Corky hears Violet scream and that does it
Gun in hand, she flies at the door
- The door to the empty apartment slams shut and Caesar, hearing it, starts to run -- But Violet reaches out, catching his ankle, sending him crashing to the dresser
Run
Just run
- The door to Caesar's apartment is locked
Corky falls to one knee, whipping two lock picks from her earlobe
- Caesar raises the gun to pistol-whip Violet and she screams
- Working the lock, Corky hears Violet's scream cut off
She feels the tumblers click, and rotates the cylinder
shadow stirs under the crack of the door as she hears something that sounds like footsteps
Corky freezes
Corky presses down low against the door beneath the peephole
She can almost feel Caesar beyond the door, but grits her teeth and turns the doorknob
- The door cracks open and Corky slips in, gun-first
As she moves into the room, we see Caesar behind her
He puts his gun to her head
Drop the fucking gun or die
Corky hesitates
Drop it
She does
Turn around
Rising from her crouch, she turns and he recognizes her
You
Holy fucking Christ
You gotta be kidding me
He starts to laugh when she strikes -- Knocking the gun, she punches him, slamming him back against the door as -- She twists, diving, grabbing her gun, just as -- He steps and kicks her full in the face
- Still unconscious, Corky's head jerks, reacting to the kick
We see the dried blood caked to her check where his kick split the skin
She is again swimming toward consciousness
We hear water splash, her face flinching as we move closer, the sounds and voices echoing
(
) Wake up
Come on, you fucking dyke
We hear Caesar slapping her
(
) Wake up
- Corky's face is dripping with water as her eyes slowly blink open
Coming into focus is Caesar, standing over her with an empty glass in one hand
Good
Except for the gag, she is bound as we have seen her bound in the closet
Caesar yanks out his gun and puts it to her head
know everything now so  don't want to hear any " don't know" bullshit, you understand
She sees Violet on the bed, also bound hand and foot
God,  should have seen this coming
The second  met you,  knew it
Everyone knows your kind can't be trusted
Fucking queers make me sick
The gun digs into her cheek
But you tried to fuck the wrong guy
And  swear to you that 'm going to kill you for it
He thumbs back the hammer
Where is the money
Don't tell him -- Shut up, Violet
He can't kill you -- He aims the gun at Violet
Violet
Not until he has the money
He fires and she jumps as the bullet punches through the wall behind her
His point made, he puts the gun back to Corky's head
Now, where the fuck is my money
Lick me
Where is it
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face
Blood temperature rising again, Caesar pulls the gun back and slaps her with it
Stupid cunt
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think -- Don't try to tell me what to do
You need the money just like we do
Shut up, Violet
Let us go and we'll make a deal
He rushes at her, grabbing a fistful of her hair
Shut the fuck up
He looks at Corky
What did you do to her
This isn't my Violet
He looks at her as if unable to recognize her What did she do to you
Everything you couldn't
He shoves her down
You ungrateful bitch
You had nothing before  met you
You were nothing
He stomps around the room
Who gave you this place
This apartment
He throws open the closet
Who gave us all of this
did gave you everything
gave you this life
made you, Violet saved you
He seems to believe what he is saying
saved you
Ha
What a load of crap
Look at yourself, Caesar
You're a thug
|You launder money for the mob
You rent women like you rented this apartment
He doesn't want to hear this
Saved me
You don't even know me
You used me, Caesar, just like used you
All part of the business
You betrayed me
You murdered Gino
had to
You made me
Bullshit, you killed him
Not me
You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you
Shut up
He slaps her
Okay, you want business, 'll give you the fucking business
He leans closer
'm going to make you beg just like Shelly did
Just like Shelly
He storms out of the room
Corky looks up at Violet
'm sorry, Corky
Don't be sorry
Help me
She pulls at the ropes as Violet slides off the bed
- Caesar throws open the broom closet and grabs the clippers that Mickey used to cut off Shelly's finger
- The two women are back-to-back, fingers working at each other's knots when Caesar bursts into the room
Oh, no no no
Grabbing Corky by the boots, he drags her and flips her so that she can now see Violet
He drops down onto Violet putting the clippers in front of her face
Hey, Violet, you remember these
Her eyes widen with terror
She starts to scream when he stuffs a towel in her mouth
Laying against Violet, he turns to Corky
'm going to start with her so you'll get a good idea what's coming
He takes hold of Violet's pinky finger, stretching it out
'm going to ask you where the money is
Every time you don't give me an answer, 'm going to cut off one finger
No
When  reach ten, then 'll start with you
He puts the finger between the blades
Where is the money
Corky sees Violet thrashing helplessly
She has no choice
Her mouth opens as -- The door buzzer rings
Caesar is distracted, trying to think who it could be
Mickey
He sees the phone, where he dropped it, lying off the hook
The door buzzer rings again, more insistently
Corky sees him momentarily unnerved
He looks back at her
said where -- He starts to cut and Corky screams -- No
'll tell you
He stops, the door buzzing continuously
It's over there in the empty apartment
As she speaks, the sound of the door buzzer changes
put it inside one of the paint drums
He is not looking at her; listening, he realizes that Mickey is buzzing the other apartments
stands as the buzzing stops
He pulls out his gun and aims it at Corky
promised  would kill you
He cocks it
You can't kill me yet
Why
could be lying
His hand start to shake with ftustration
He is beginning to hate this woman more than he ever hated Johnnie
Taking a deep breath, he eases back the hammer
You're going to wish to God you hadn't done that
He kicks her again, snapping her head back
After he leaves, Violet looks over and sees Corky lying unconscious
- Caesar tries to open the door to the empty apartment but it is locked
Fuck
At the end of the hall, the elevator "dings
" Just as the door opens, Caesar jumps back into his apartment
'  - Son of a bitch
His mind a racing blur, he locks the door and runs back to the bedroom
- With another towel, he gags Corky and drags her into the closet
In her pocket, he finds the key
He closes the doors, then hangs up the phone
Grunting, he hauls Violet up over his shoulder -- When there is a knock on the door
- Carrying Violet, he hurries to the kitchen, where he throws Corky's gun into the freezer
Mickey is banging on the door as Caesar heads for the bathroom
Dropping Violet onto the floor, he reaches behind the curtain and turns on the shower
Mickey will get in
know he will
We hear the water hitting the bodies while Caesar starts tearing off his clothes
Violet
can kill you right now if that's what you want
If you want to live, then you have to help me
need you to make Mickey believe that everything is normal
He picks up his gun
Tell me, do you want to live
She stares hard at him and his gun, then nods
Good girl
- We move toward the door as the lock clicks open
- Violet's hands are untied
She pulls off the gag and the ropes at her feet
Naked, Caesar sticks his head under the shower spray, wetting everything
Still dripping, Caesar walks into the room, a towel wrapped around his waist, another towel in his hand
Mickey and Lou are standing in the middle of the room
Caesar jumps
Jesus Christ
Caesar holds his chest, laying it on a bit thick
Holy fuck, Mickey
You scared the shit outta me
He sees they both are holding their guns
What is this
what are you two doing, sneaking in here with your peckers in your hands
You gonna do me, Mick
Is that it
Mickey smiles, putting his gun away
No, Cease
There was no answer
thought  heard someone knocking
was buzzing,  was knocking, but guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower
Yeah, it was Violet's idea
was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax
That Violet is one nice lady
Wish someone would help me relax
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink
Sit down, Lou
Behind the bar, he sets down the towel be was holding and we see the gun hidden inside it
- Violet watches through a sliver of open door, her mind already working
- Caesar is making the drinks
We was worried about you, Cease
Me
Why
We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad
Caesar hands him a drink
started thinking maybe it's about the money so  call you, but all get is the busy signal
figure the phone is off the hook, that's why  come rushing over here
Oh Christ, the phone
That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, 'd probably do the same thing
Mickey smiles as he sips his drink
- Violet stands and goes to the shower curtain
She reaches in and turns off the water
Steadying herself, she pulls back the curtain, exposing the wet, bloody bodies
- Mickey is looking at the furniture
Cease, can  ask you something
Yeah
Why'd you move all the furniture around
The knot in Caesar's stomach tightens
Let me guess
That was Violet's idea, too
He laughs, and Lou laughs with him
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right
You know women, Mick
Sure, Cease
They make us do stupid things, don't they
Caesar smiles feebly
- Violet has pulled up Johnnie's body and is digging through his coat pockets, searching for something
- Mickey sees the briefcase still on the coffee table
Is that the money
Yeah, that's it
Caesar puts his hand inside the towel as Mickey walks across the rug
That fucking Shelly
gotta hand it to the guy, but Jesus, if  were him  would have bailed a long time ago
mean, how much money does a man need
Talking to Lou, be picks up the case and walks back, somehwo moving right between the wet spots
remember  was just staring at all this goddamn money, Shelly down on his knees, and the next thing  know, Johnnie just blows his head off
He slaps the case up onto the bar
What a fucking mess
Johnnie's laughing his ass off and that's when Caesar lost it and - Boom
He coldcocked him
Fucking coldcocks Johnnie Marzzone
He thumbs the latches but the case is still locked
Hey, Caesar, where's the key
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom
Fuck it,  don't need the key
Caesar takes the smallest breath
didn't need a key to get in here, did
He pulls out a lock-pick and starts working the lock
The muscles in Caesar's forearm bulge as he tightly squeezes his gun
He is slipping toward that same desperate choice
He is going to attack when -- Across the room, the phone rings
Everyone looks at it
Who the hell could that be
The phone is near the couch
Caesar doesn't want to let go of the gun
The phone continues to ring
You gonna answer it
- Violet has Johnnie's cellular phone
Watching through the cracked door, Violet sees Caesar cross to answer the phone
(
) Hello
Hello, Caesar
This is Gino
Caesar looks toward the bathroom
(
) What
You're blowing your only chance
Act like 'm Gino
- Caesar's eyes light up
Holy shit,  don't believe it
We've been going crazy over here, Gino
(
) Good boy
Mickey jumps up
It's Gino
It's Gino
Where in the hell is he
- We were in a car accident -- (
) They were in a car accident
But everybody is all right
- They're all fine
Just bruises and shit
(
) Now you listen to me, asshole, know your gun is behind the bar
Un-fucking-believable
called those highway patrol dumb fucks
Ssh
can't hear Gino
(
) We make a deal or  come out and hand this phone to Mickey
'm listening
- Violet has her robe over her dress, wrapping her hair in a towel, making sure the bruise on her forehead is hidden
want what's mine, half the money
We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies
No one
Say yes,  understand
(
) Yes,  understand
Tell them 'm at St
Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until  come out
(
) Sure, Gino, sure
- Out of the corner of his eye, he watches Violet come out of the bathroom
St
Mary's off the Kennedy, sure
Okay, Gino
Mickey sees Violet
Mickey
What are you doing here
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie
They were in a car accident
Oh my God
Was anyone hurt
think everything is okay
Caesar hangs up
They're at St
Mary's in the waiting room
Mick is already on the way
can't fit them all in my car so give me your keys
You drive my car, Lou
Caesar sees Violet walking toward the kitchen
Sure, Mickey, sure
Violet
She stops, looking straight at the freezer
Go grab my car keys from my pants in the bathroom
She turns to him
Please, help us out, Mickey wants to get going
She turns to the bathroom
They might want to go straight to the airport and back to Miami, so better take this
He grabs the briefcase
You got the key
Oh yeah
Violet
- Where Corky remains bound, still unconscious
We hear the name echo in her head
(
) Violet
Suddenly, her eyes blink open
(
) Violet
Her eyes blink again as she tries to focus
- Violet hands Mickey the keys for the car and the case
Thanks,
He kisses her on the cheek
Call me as soon as you get him
Leave your phone on the hook
Mickey and Lou leave
Violet is staring at Caesar, standing near the door
In his right hand he is holding the other towel
He smiles
Now that's teamwork
should have let him kill you
You know he would have done you, too
knew  couldn't trust you
He drops the towel, raising the gun
said 'd let you live and  will
He smiles again
Maybe
- Corky is wide awake, thrashing-mad, biting her gag, struggling to get free
- Caesar pulls his pants on
Time to find out if the dyke was stupid enough to lie
Caesar drags Violet througb the front door
- The closet doors burst open as Corky fights her way out
- Caesar sees the buckets of paint
He rips the lid from the nearest and kicks it over
Paint spills out across the floor
- Suddenly Corky stops; something has caught her eye
We drop down, focusing on what she is staring at -- The clippers
- He kicks over the second bucket and the bag tumbles out with the rushing flow of paint
Yes
He turns to Violet, who is already running out the door
No
- Violet turns down the hall, bare feet beating against the floor
Caesar slices out of the room behind her
Violet
He aims the gun as she hurls her self into the emergency door
Fuck
- She flies, hands on the rail, spiraling down each flight as he charges after her
Goddammit, Violet
Stop
Now
- Straining, Corky's fingers curl around the handle of the clippers
- Violet smashes through the door, but instead of turning to the main doors, she runs straight for the elevators
She pounds the button and waits
Come on
Come on, please
She hears Caesar coming just as the elevator opens
Caesar crashes out of the stair door, running toward the exit
When he doesn't see Violet, he turns to the sound of the elevator -- And catches a glimpse of her as the doors close
Oh, you bitch
You fucking bitch
Taking a really deep breath, he throws open the door to the stairs
- Violet takes Johnnie's cellular phone from the robe pocket and dials a number
Mickey answers on the car phone
Mickey
Oh God, Mickey
(
) Violet
Whispering, she acts terrified
He made me help him, Mickey, God, was so afraid
It was Caesar, all Caesar
You have to help me
He's coming - Oh God
She hangs up, eyes blazing
- Sweat pouring off him, Caesar climbs the stairs
- The elevator opens, Violet bolts out
She runs down the hall, past the empty apartment, back to her door
Corky
- She rushes to the bedroom, where she finds the coils of cut rope
Corky
She looks at the wall separating the apartment
- Caesar half-falls out of the stair door, drenched with sweat
Gun ready, Caesar throws open the door
Spread out like a pond of milk is the spilled paint, but -- The money is gone
Leading away from the white pool are boot prints and the drip trail of the plastic bag
The tracks lead to the bathroom
Caesar kicks open the bathroom door and finds the bag of money next to Corky's empty boots
Over his shoulder we see Corky already swinging a massive pipe wrench
At the last second he is able to duck, falling to the ground as -- The doorjamb splinters with a terrible metal crunch
Before he can recover and shoot, she brings the wrench down on his arm
He screams as the gun hits the floor
She kicks it, sending it skidding, hydroplaning across the paint pool to the other side, leaving a jet trail of white swirls and spirals on the wood floor
They fight, Corky raining blows onto his back and flailing arm until -- He catches her foot, flipping her as he clambers up
Scrambling across the paint, slipping, crawling for the gun when -- Violet bursts in, pointing the gun from the freezer
Stop
Caesar, on hands and knees, looks at her, then at his gun still out of reach
It's over, Caesar
called Mickey
He's on his way
Violet stands for long time, the gun trained carefully on him as he rises from the floor
Panting, Caesar watches her like a mad dog
Get out of here, Caesar
If you want to live you had better start running
He smiles
All these years and you still don't know me, Violet
She glances down and sees the paint-covered gun
But  know you
He turns to the gun
Caesar, don't
What are you going to do,
Shoot me
Kill me in cold blood
don't think so
'll tell you why
If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago
If  was you,  would have killed me the minute  brought the money home
But you didn't and know why, because you don't want to kill me
Do you,
Do you
No,  know you don't
Caesar, you don't know shit
Violet fires -- The bullet hits Caesar in the shoulder, knocking him off balance
Another doubles him over as blood speckles the pool of paint
She empties the gun into him
His body arcs back, falling, splashing into the paint
Caesar's blood bubbles out bright red against the glistening white
: '  - It is empty and clean
In the bedroom, only a few hangers are left dangling in the open closet
- Mickey is standing with Violet, next to his Lincoln Town Car
will never understand it, Mickey
You didn't even call the police
told you, the family doesn't want the police around
We want to take care of it ourselves and we will
'll find him
swear  will
know you will
Sure you're going to be okay mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands
Thanks, Mickey, but  need to get out, you know
Get away from all of this
Mickey nods
But thanks
Thanks for everything
She hugs him and he kisses her
Then he gets in his car
Violet watches him drive away and knows that she is free
' Corky sitting on stoop, patient, like a rock
She looks up as she hears high heels, and smiles at -- Violet standing there, new outfit
Corky stands in front of her
Hey
Hey
How'd it go
'm here, aren't
Corky nods
guess we should get out of here
Violet nods
Corky digs out alarm keys, aims, fires
Violet turns, looks
New truck
Violet turns to Corky, eyebrow cocked
Thought we might need a getaway car
Smiles, they get in
Corky admires truck
You know what the difference is between us, Violet
No
Me neither
Lean for kiss, as dolly in
Guns engine
