Written by Lucy Alibar & Benh Zeitlin Based on the stage play "Juicy and Delicious" by Lucy Alibar '  - An abandoned looking trailer sits on top of two 15-foot-tall oil drums
Distant thunder trembles through the peeling metal panels
The structure is in such disrepair, that surely no one lives here
But then, a light goes on
'  - tiny hand sculpts the mud on top of a crawfish hole placed on the floor
We pan up to reveal a little girl examining a baby chicken that appears to be dead
This is , an unkempt and seemingly uncared for six-year-old with a gaze of unmistakable wisdom
Hushpuppy places the chick on the crawfish hole, like a queen on her throne and the chick twitches to life, cheeps twice
Hushpuppy's esoteric science experiment is interrupted by Her eyes stand to attention
: - An eerie, harsh wind whips hay and dust through over a giant slumbering pot-belly pig
Hushpuppy, donned in boys' underpants and a child-sized wife- beater, tip-toes behind the epic creature
She studies it, wonderful, is this the source of the thunder
With the utmost delicacy, she lays a hand on the pig's belly
We hear his
: '  - series of glimpses of Hushpuppy's scientific method
She chases geese, chickens, ducks, dogs around the property- a cross between an abandoned farm and salvage yard
Hushpuppy grabs a baby chick and puts it to her ear She listens with focused wonder and intensity
(
) All the time, everywhere, everything's organs be beatin' and squirtin' and talkin' to each other in ways  can't understand
Mosta the time they probably just sayin' "'m hungry," or " gotta poop," but sometimes they talkin' in codes
Hushpuppy's eyes dart up as a '  yells- '  (
) Get up, get out of here
We hear a  as a cat is flung across the room
window made from a gas station sign opens in a Robinson Crusoe style tree house patched together from storm debris and discarded appliances
wild man with severe features, a frazz of unkempt hair, and brawler's scars opens a window made from a metal sign
This is   , known to all as  (39)
Get your pants on, man
Wink kills a beer and sends it out the hole in the wall into a basketball hoop attached to a fishing net that stretched 15 feet down to the ground
The net is overflowing with beer cans
'  - Hushpuppy obediently climbs a series of increasingly bigger and bigger oil drums that function like a ladder, up to the door of her house
- We now see Wink in his morning ritual
He opens a cooler with a butchered chicken inside it and tosses the bird on the grill
He goes to the front porch and pours down a bag of dog food
He pulls a clothesline that leads to Hushpuppy's trailer Feed up time
Feed up
Hushpuppy, now wearing pants and a slightly more proper - shirt, comes running down the oil barrels to her house
She echoes her Daddy
Feed up time
Feed up
- Hushpuppy devours the whole roast chicken with her hands, getting right in there like it was a candy apple
It looks really yummy
Pigs, dogs, chickens, and cats are chowing down all around her
hatch opens above her and we realize we're in the bottom of the Shacko
Wink sticks his head through the hatch and throws corn to the chickens
Share with the dogs
Hushpuppy rips off a piece of chicken and flings it to a filthy chihuahua with no hair on the back half of its body
This is , in spite of her circumstances, quite a handsome young pup
-   - , we see Hushpuppy and Wink drift through the marsh
They ride in a severed truck bed floating on top of oil drums
motor is strapped to the back
sign on the boat reads "The Turck", Hushpuppy's spelling of "Truck"
They look out to where the water goes all the way to a monolithic, 20 foot wall stretching infinitely into the distance
This levee, the first piece of modern construction we've seen, encloses the civilized world, protecting it from rising water
The Bathtub is on the wrong side of wall
Wink stares out at the distant factories behind the wall with a peaceful and confident disdain
Hushuppy matches his relaxed defiant expression
Ain't that ugly over there
He takes a long pull on his beer
(') We live in the prettiest place on earth
Hushpuppy looks over the wall to the Dry Side
It's an endless sprawl of oil processing power plants without a tree or bird in sight
This is the engine that runs the Northern world
(
) Daddy says, up above the levee, on the dry side, they're afraid of the water like a bunch of babies
They built the wall that cuts us off
- We fly over marsh and water, coming upon a tiny crop of shanties on an island perched at the very bottom of the land
(
) They think we all gonna drown down here
But we ain't goin' nowhere
: - - - Hushpuppy letting out a   in a mass of people
They stand on a long and crumbling road surrounded on both sides by water
The rag tag band of revelers charge forward and
Hushpuppy kisses her hand and smacks the town sign
"Isle de Charles Doucet" is crossed out and someone has graffitied "The Bathtub
" Each party-goer repeats Hushpuppy's kiss and smack in wild, ritualistic fashion
(
) The Bathtub's got more holidays than the whole rest of the world
- The townspeople charge in a rousing parade
Everyone drags trails of beer cans, boat parts, anything they can tie to themselves that makes a lot of noise
They are the hard faces of fishermen and their feisty wives, downtrodden but with a sense of fortitude among them, a community of heart, spirit, passion, and reckless abandon
We see none of the separations that we're used to in modern society
There is no evidence of politics, religion, class, race or any other divisive ideology
The Bathtub is a place of true and honest unity
Megaphones sticking out a gutted mini-van broadcast the Cajun band playing inside
Fiddle, saw, guitar, and double-bass players struggle to hold onto their instruments and the truck bounces them down a dirt road
They drive under a banner reading "Welcome to the Bathtub Storm Season
" Wink and Hushpuppy rattle along on a float made from the front end of a pickup truck
Over the front cabin rears a giants sculpture of a horse-head made out of wooden spikes, metal plates, and heavy chains
Carnival-dressed maniacs clamber on top
Wink hollers and waves to people
He fires jets of beer into the mouths of the crowd
Hushpuppy dances on the back of the float
Though she's the tiniest member of this very adult parade, she's right in the thick of everything
No one is checking
Ds Here
(
) Daddy always saying, that up in the dry world, they got none of what we got
- The town dances around the band in a clearing in the woods
Everyone is bouncing to the music, smiling and joking with one another
(
) They only got holidays once a year
Six babies, each with a racing number pinned to their diaper, are placed by their enthusiastic mammas at a starting-line on a track marked by two adjacent crowds of onlookers
Bets are flying between the spectators as if they're about to watch a cock-fight
(
) All babies to the race
Come up to the starting line
The baby race is about to begin
Hushpuppy dances in the cheering crowd, swigging a bottle of something she probably shouldn't have
fires, and the babies make a crawl for it
Most of them are paralysed in tears or bewilderment, but one brave soul toddles towards victory
(
) They got fish stuck in plastic wrappers, they got their babies stuck in carriages, and chickens on sticks and all that kind of stuff
Hushpuppy looks up at Wink who is dancing with his best friend  (60), a slack jawed, white haired, pinked nosed, handsome devil
baby crosses the finish line, ahead of the rest, victorious
The crowd goes wild
- Wink opens his trawl net and dumps a massive catch into a picking pan
There's food to feed a hundred in the haul
No one is a bit fazed though, this is just your average night fishing in the Bathtub
Shrimp, crabs, and small leaping fish struggle over one another for dear life
Hushpuppy helps him sort the catch
Winks's hands move with virtuosic ease, separating the crabs from the shrimp
She studies Wink's every move and tries to measure up to her Dad's proficiency
He doesn't demonstrate or explain anything, but we sense there is a system of education in place here
Hushpuppy focuses in on a tiny fish, wriggling and sucking it's last breaths of air
(
) One day, the storm's gonna blow, the ground's gonna sink, and the water's gonna rise up so high, there ain't gonna be no Bathtub, just a whole bunch of water
She pick up a crab, pets its belly
The  of the party fades down around her as she listens to its
'   - Explosions everywhere as Bathtubers rampage blasting fireworks down the street instead of into the air
Men dressed as women, women dressed as men, in some kind of reckless esoteric ritual
The  kicks in hard with a tinge of ominous forboding
We sense that in spite of the ecstatic energy, the unbridled joy, that a cloud hangs over this community
The people are parting like it's there last day on earth, and we feel viscerally, that it could be
Hushpuppy runs in the thick of it behind Wink waving a fountain sparkler
Wink trips and falls
Wink lies on his back on the ground
He sees his daughter watching him, holding the huge sparkler, and they both laugh with sheer joy
Hushpuppy stops over him and points a bottle rocket in his face, the fuse burning
He nods his approval
They watch the fuse burn down to the last moment
She turns it upward, and they watch her rocket join a sky filled with pluming mortars
Hushpuppy looks at the light flickering across Wink's faces
He's momentarily peaceful, admiring the spectacular display
Hushpuppy smiles at him with pride
He doesn't see her
They run off into the crowd, which is pulsating at the pinnacle of mayhem
The   shifts gears into a of the Bathtub
Throw your fist in the air
These are the survivors, those who fight for their joy and their history to the last man
(
) But me and my Daddy, we stay right here
We who the earth is for
Hushpuppy runs right at us with detonating fireworks in both hands, engulfed by light
She swings them toward camera and the screen is engulfed in an inferno of sparks
white out
Black letters slam down
- abruptly as a basket of crawfish is slammed in front of camera
The crawfish squirming and struggling for life engulfs the screen
' Meat
fearsome, uncompromising leader, sexy like a lady bullfighter, peeks at Hushpuppy over a mass of squirming crawfish
This is   (36)
She points to three students, pushing their heads with her finger, each time announcing: The twelve students follow her through a maze of creatures caged in mason jars, basins, and boxes with breathing holes- her educational tools
(') Every animal is made out of meat
am meat, ya'll asses meat
Everything is part of the buffet of the universe
Miss Bathsheba rolls up the leg of her skirt
(') This here, is an Aurochs
Riding her thigh, is tattooed a scene much like a cave painting in Lascaux
In thick black ink, it depicts a battle between early men wielding spears, and giant bull-like animals bearing down over them
(') fierce, mean creature that roamed the earth back when we all lived in caves
They would gobble the cave- babies down right in front of their cave-parents
And the cavemen couldn't do nothing about it, because they were too poor, too stupid, too small
Who here thinks the Cavemen were sitting around crying like a buncha pussies
Children stare blankly, no one raises their hand
Hushpuppy watches a heroic crawfish crest the basket, fall to the floor, and make a run for it
Miss Bathsheba snatches up the rogue crawdad and flings it back into the vat
(') 'all better think about that
Cause any day now, the fabric of the universe is coming unraveled
The ice caps gonna melt, the water's gonna rise, and everything south of the levee's going under
She points to a map showing a ragged coastline
On the wrong side of a giant line marked "levee" is an island labeled "The Bathtub
" (') Ain't gonna be no Bathtub, just a whole bunch of water
'all better learn to survive
mysterious   fills the air
Hushpuppy stares into a wall poster of an ice cliff reading:
(
) Way back in the day, the Aurochs was king of the world
- to the  of an ice cliff, but now it's real
10 We   to overwhelming white light accompanied by intermittent   that build in frequency and volume
(
) If it wasn't for giant snowballs, and the iced age
wouldn't even be Hushpuppy,  would just be breakfast
The light dims in intensity to reveal, frozen deep inside the ice wall, barely visible- a fanged, hairy, bloated, stone aged creature, the same as on Miss Bathsheba's leg
This is an Aurochs
/
- Hushpuppy climbs a metal ladder made from a railing, up to Wink's shanty in the trees
Windell, her dirty Chihuahua, follows behind
Daddy
Feed-up time
Feed-up
Hushpuppy bangs on the door of the shacko
(') Daddy
Nothing
She goes inside
The house is empty
She checks the Shacko for food
Nothing
'  - Several hours later, Hushpuppy stands on a metal bin looking into the distance
Like some sort of animal call, she
11 '  - Hushpuppy draws a picture of Wink on a foldout mattress
(
) Kids that got no Mamma, no Daddy and nobody
They got to live in the woods, and eat grass, and steal underpants
Hushpuppy lays down next to her drawing of Wink
- Windell, the Chihuahua and the potbelly pig awake to greet the day
Hushpuppy peers into the ground floor of the shacko
Daddy
Daddy
No response
(
) (') If Daddy don't get home soon, it's gonna be time for me to start eating my pets
- Kids walk home with their parents after a day at the Schoolboat, which we now see is big a yellow houseboat floating on the bayou
Hushpuppy waits alone, no one has come to get her
Miss Bathsheba locks up the door and heads for her small motor boat tied off on the side of the school
You need a ride, boo
My Daddy's coming to pick me up
How about food or something, you hungry
12 Hushpuppy shakes her head `no'
Miss Bathsheba's doesn't totally believe her, but she's not the type to coddle either
(') Alright, well suit yourself
Miss Bathsheba motors away
Hushpuppy waits until she's out of sight and starts walking
'  - Playing don't-touch-the-floor, Hushpuppy navigates her house
The room has with holes in the walls blocked with old clothes and paper towels
Homemade toys fill every surface
This is the domain of a child at loose ends
Hushpuppy leaps over her bed- a nook piled with clothes- and plugs in the Christmas lights
(
) Everything we still got from Mamma, we keep in my house
We push in on a shrine to her mother: red basketball jersey
An apron
sawed-off shotgun child's drawing of a beautiful lady
(
) (') Daddy says, the first time she looked at me, it made her heart beat so big, that she thought it would blow up
That's why she swam away
Hushpuppy takes the jersey down
She puts it over a chair in the dining area
Hushpuppy gets a can of cat food
pot
Water in a bowl
Her actions have a sad sense of routine to them- she's been left alone before, and has her own self-invented system for feeding herself
She opens a can of cat food, takes it out with her hand and throws it in a pot
She licks the remnants off her finger
13 ' Hi my sweet baby
Hi momma
, Hushpuppy's imaginary, invisible mamma, is speaking from the basketball jersey chair
Marietta functions like an imaginary friend- Hushpuppy is the only one who can see her
Hushpuppy takes the pot, puts it on the stove
' Hushpuppy what you doing there
You being good like  taught you
Yes, mamma
Hushpuppy turns on the gas
Hushpuppy goes through her safety precautions: oven mitts, a helmet, she flips the table and hides behind it
She aims the stove lighter: a flame thrower made from a cigarette lighter and a can of spray deodorant
spray of flames ignites the stove in a
: Hushpuppy behind the bubbling stove
She ties on an apron and sways to the music
She is dressing like her mom
Marietta's Voice sings to her
' You're good, you make me happy / you're good, you make me happy
That's pretty Mamma
' You're pretty Hushpuppy
Hushpuppy stares into the floating islands of cat food frying in fat, which in her  is a surreal churning vision, like the bubbling lava at the center of the earth
She's  out of her vision by a   being flung across the yard
14 (
) Get out of my way you fat animal
Hushpuppy jumps down from the stove, grabs a bowl of water, and runs to greet Wink, '  - She clambers down the oil drum ladder spilling her water everywhere in her excitement
Daddy
Daddy, Daddy
Wink doesn't turn to acknowledge her as he trudges across the field toward his Shacko
He's wearing a hospital patient's smock and no shoes, it seems he checked himself out
(') learned lots of stuff while you gone
If  drink all this here can burp like a man
Hushpuppy gulps down water, all of it
Wink keeps walking
Hushpuppy  like a man, but he doesn't turn around
Hushpuppy stops to examine the situation
Something's not right here
(') How come you wearing a dress
Hushpuppy tugs his patient's smock and he shrugs her off violently
Leave me alone, Man
She sees his hospital
bracelet still on
You wearing a bracelet too
Go in your house, you wouldn't understand
wanna come in your house
15 Hushpuppy whacks Wink's butt
(') Wink fakes like he's gonna smack her
Hushpuppy tears off
Wink storms into the Shacko in the Backo
'  - Hushpuppy stomps inside
Her cat food is burning, with steam jetting up to the ceiling
She thinks about it for a moment, and turns the burner up
Smoke billows
Hushpuppy grabs her basketball jersey off the chair and jumps over the breakfront counter
Behind her Hushpuppy ducks down, panicking
She check over the median
The stove is on engulfed in flames
Hushpuppy scrambles under a cardboard box
/
'  - The walls of the box are decorated with years of her drawings
In here she feels a strange safety
The and   feel distant and muffled
She draws a hieroglyphic of herself sad and crying on an island with a sun and a palm tree
She peeks out as Wink runs into the house, which is filled with black smoke, flickering flames
(
) (panicking from inside) Hushpuppy
Boss lady
Hushpuppy where you at
Hushpuppy drops the box closed
Smoke billows into the box, filling it up
16 (
) If Daddy kill me,  ain't gonna be forgotten, 'm recording my story for the scientists of the future
Hushpuppy draws a bigger figure giving her a hug as Wink's panicked fury intensifies outside
(
) Where are you Boss
(
) In a million years, when kids go to school, they gonna know that once there was Hushpuppy and she lived with her Daddy in the Bathtub
Wink pulls Hushpuppy's drawings off the walls, he flings them out the door to safety
Hushpuppy coughs
Wink has heard
He looks toward the box
Hushpuppy and makes a runs for it, flying out the door
(') Don't you run away from me swear to  Hushpuppy
'  - Hushpuppy runs out of Wink's compound into the woods, Wink on her trail
In the background, the house is a towering inferno
'  - They run deeper into the swamp
'm tearing off
You ain't tearing off nothin', 'll bust your ass
17 'm tearing off just like my Momma
Come on
Wink tried to yank her toward home and Hushpuppy refuses
She digs her heels in
(') See what happens
See what happens to you
Hushpuppy hooks her leg around a tree and holds on
Wink slaps Hushpuppy and she falls face down
He looks away, disgusted with himself
(') See what you making me do
You're killing me
He reaches down and tries to pick her up
(') Get up and now come on
Hushpuppy jumps up on her own
hope you do die
And after you die,  come to your grave and eat birthday cake all by myself
Hushpuppy punches Wink in the heart and suddenly , as if all the insects in the forest have hushed
All at once, we hear-- , beating until there is a  , an earsplitting  of glacial ice
Hushpuppy turns toward the sound
When she turns back Wink's face has transformed, wrenches with fear and pain
Wink keels over clutching his arm
Hushpuppy stares, her breath accelerating
Wink's eyes roll back in his head, he begins to seizure
18 rings out
The  builds to a She covers her ears
/  - Fissures appear like lightning through the massive ice cliff from the opening of the movie
Hushpuppy runs from the sound, hands over her ears
We with shots of falling glaciers
The universe is coming unravelled
An ice shelf  into the ocean in a  , a wave rolls toward camera
- The wave, now just a tiny ripple, hits Hushpuppy's feet
Suddenly, the water level rises around her
It overtakes her knees and keeps going
Hushpuppy backs up to shore, terrified
Hushpuppy calls out to a distant beacon flashing on the horizon
Momma
Momma
think broke something
- Hushpuppy runs out of the woods toward school in a total panic
In front of the school parents pile their children into a pickup trucks and vans
Miss Bathsheba
Miss Bathsheba
My Daddy fell down
Miss Bathsheba takes Hushpuppy's hands as she tries to catch her breath to speak
Clutched in her hand is the hospital bracelet that Wink had been wearing
Bathsheba turns over the diagnostic bracelet and reads it, her eyes widen in recognition and alarm
19 - Hushpuppy watches Miss Bathsheba frantically pull herbs and roots from her containers of medicinal oddities and pack it into a large medicine jar
It's gonna be  baby
Bathsheba hands Hushpuppy the medicine jar
(') Ok, Hushpuppy, here's what  need you to do
You take this medicine and run as fast as you can
Go
- We see glimpses of nature protecting itself from the impending disaster
Flowers curl up, insects horde food underground,  sounds fill the air
Black birds, and bats, and all manner of flying creatures fill the sky
They're all getting the hell out of dodge
Hushpuppy, quaking with fear, runs through a menacing swamp clutching her medicine jar
The rising winds swirl the marsh grass all around her
Hushpuppy runs to the spot where Wink collapsed
He's gone
Hushpuppy looks around the swamp, unable to understand
(
) Daddy could have turned into a tree, or a bug
There wasn't any way to know
Hushpuppy hides her medicine jar in her storage unit- a leather flap laid over the hollow of an oak tree
The hollow is filled with trinkets and objects she's collected over the years
Hushpuppy flinches as a shrieking animal calls out
She looks up to see a leaf covered in writhing caterpillars
One of them has been skewered by a beetle and is fighting for it's life
20 (
) The whole universe depends on everything fitting together just right
If one piece busts, even the smallest piece, the entire universe will get busted
- Blocks of glaciers roll out of the avalanche and away from Antarctica like floating ice cubes
Embedded in each cube, is an Aurochs
single ice cube takes over the frame and the mammoth dead Aurochs' eye stares right at us
Its jaw wide, its fangs bared, the ferocious beast appears to have fossilized mid- pounce
We drift upwards into the cloud cover
As we rise above the white canopy, the spiral of a hurricane forms
- under
We follow behind a little boy running down the road with an alarm bell as the people of the Bathtub mobilize in a frenzied evacuation
The storm's coming
The storm's coming
'  - Hushpuppy sulks out of the woods, feeling sorry for herself
She looks up and freezes like she's seen a ghost
Wink hobbles down the road, looking shell-shocked
The traffic on the road moves in one direction: out
Wink walks back into town in the opposite direction
In Hushpuppy's  Wink arrives at Lady Jo's bar where a band of drunken sweethearts are in their regular positions
They are watching the evacuation go by like it's a Veteran's Day parade
They giggle and hurl good-natured curses out to a family making their way to safety
21 Look at these assholes running around all over the damn place
'est la vie assholes
know y'all with me
'all doin' the storm
Lady Jo's ain't never closed honey
That's what 'm talking about
Walrus my big man, you staying
Wrong number buddy
'm outta here as soon as  finish my beer
Wink dismisses him with a wave of his hand
You ain't goin nowhere
This ain't no sneeze comin' out the gulf
'm gone brother
'll see you tomorrow Walrus
Lookit there, Winston's with me
is passed out on the stairs
(') What you doing about the storm Winston
Without opening his eyes, Winston raises an umbrella over his head
Wink laughs
Hey
It's Hushpuppy
Hushpuppy
Hushpuppy's here
They burst into a round of drunken applause
22 Hushpuppy
Where you been
What happened to y- Shut-up
He lifts her up by the britches and carries her away
(') You don't talk
/
-   - Through the bus window, Hushpuppy watches Wink prepare for the storm as branches and debris fly by him
He  to himself and drinks
He ties the Turck onto the house
Hushpuppy looks to where her animals lurch and freeze, run around in circles, pant heavily
They feel it coming
Rain drops start to spatter the window and Wink trips and falls trying to catch a fleeing chicken
/
- 2ND  - Now, the full force of the storm  and  the shutters
Rain screams against the corrugated metal roof
Wink tapes padding over all sharp corners and plastic wraps the furniture
He's Hushpuppy-proofing everything
He runs a piece of duct tape across the floor
This side is still Wink's house
No toys, and no girl stuff over here
Wink pushes charred toys from Hushpuppy's house across the line
(') So if  want to come over that side and smack you in the face, that's against the rules
So there's a plus for you
23 Hushpuppy is not able to see the bright side here
(') Now come on down here and get in the boat, man
He points to a trunk on the floor
Hushpuppy hops down and gets in
Wink sits on his air mattress
(') If the water get real high, we gonna float to the top and we gonna bust through the roof and we gonna ride away, okay
Wink puts a pair of mismatching water wings on her
(') You never  take these off
'm your Daddy, and you do what tell you to do, because it's my job to keep you from dying, ok
So sit back and just listen to me
Close your eyes and go to sleep
Hushpuppy watches Wink pretending to sleep
The scares the bejesus out of him again
She looks to the ceiling where water is starting to pour in steadily
Looks back at Wink who is sneaking a sip from his liquor bottle
He resumes his phony sleep
strong gust of wind  the entire room and he springs out of bed
(') Why you starin' at me like that can't sleep with you starin' at me like that
Wink paces the floor
(') Listen
You need to understand, you're a kid and 'm a man
She doesn't understand
24 (') What, you scared
Hushpuppy nods
and Wink is the one who flinches
(') Don't be scared, no storm can't beat no Doucet
'm gonna show you
You watch
But he can see she's still scared
(') 'm'll show you
We Doucets we're not scared of no damn storm
Wink grabs a bottle of moonshine and climbs down the hatch in the floor into the storm
Hushpuppy runs to the window and peeks out
The frenzy of the hurricane propels Wink at full sprint through the 100  winds
He tears his clothes off and guzzles moonshine as branches fall all around him
(') Look at me
Look at me Hushpuppy
Watch me kick butt
Wink fires his shotgun at the heavens
(') Hell yea
'm right here
'm right here  ain't going nowhere
shakes the house so hard a ceiling beam down
Hushpuppy runs to her bed as if it might keep her safe
Windell, swinging from a basket tied to the ceiling, , panicking herself
Mamma
: 25 - Still in the rainstorm, a glacial cube , flopping a mammoth body onto the shoreline
It's chest heaves and a   is heard
The animal begins to roll over
Her dinosaur size hoof plants in the mud as she lifts herself up
We stare over the muscular haunch of her body as she stares into the distance
The massive creature turns, testing her limbs after thousands of years of sleep
She looks up to the storm and lets loose a
We sit close on one of her black eyes
There is something dangerously sad in her cold gaze
Her head moves from the frame as she starts forward on her journey
- Silence
The storm has passed
The camera flies high over the Bathtub
The tops of houses poke out from the massive water like lily-pads in a pond
-  - slab of metal stares at us, surrounded by water
Something under the metal   and an axe dislodges a roof panel
The axe twists and leverages off the slab
Wink hefts Hushpuppy on top of the roof
Then Windell
Dishevelled and hung-over, he pulls himself up too
The three survivors stare in stunned silence at their new world
-  - Wink slowly navigates the Turck in through the flooded landscape where their town had once been
Neither he nor Hushpuppy can say a word
Everything is submerged
Every organism is dead or has fled
The quiet is overwhelming
26 (
) For every animal that didn't have a Dad to put it in a boat, the end of the world already happened
They're all down below, trying to breathe through water
They pass abandoned house, after abandoned house, the ones on stilts have water up to the porches
Trees are bashed through roofs, walls are blown through, bathrooms exposed
'  -  - Wink uses a pole to open a door
Yo Winston
No one answers
They push off
'  -  -   - Wink enters an intact house with water up to the porch
(
) Edison
Ow-Wee
Wink leans against the door frame
From his  we see Hushpuppy on the Turck
She picks a leaf and eats it
Wink shakes his head in dismay, realizing all too clearly his girl is not ready for survival
-   - The Turck passes through a net of Spanish moss into the belly of a swamp
Some day when 'm gone, you gonna be the last man in the bathtub
You have to learn how to feed your house
Wink goes to the edge of the turck and sticks his hand in the water
27 (') Now, stick your left hand in this water, stick it in there
Hushpuppy puts her right hand in the water
(') Ok, what you do is you hold your hand steady and you just wait for your fish to come
You gotta ball your fist up, this is your punching hand
Ball your fist up in case you have to whack it when they come up
Wink pulls a Catfish out with his bare hand
(') Whooo lord, look what we got
gotcha
Say " gotcha
" gotcha
Wink slams the fish down on the floor of the Turck and pins it
Yea
Hold him down
Now, you hold it down like this, and whack him good with your fist
Wink pins the fish and punches it in the face
(') Go ahead whack him
You whack him good
Hold him like that and whack him
Hushpuppy pins the fish
She tries to whack it and it cuts her
She hides her cut hand from Wink
You
That's all a part of it
28 Hushpuppy winces in pain
(') You wanna try it again
Hushpuppy shakes her head no, trying not to cry
(') Come on
One more time
'  -  - Hushpuppy has enclosed herself under a table with a tablecloth on it
She's drawing on the floor with charcoal
Something alive hits the roof and scurries across
We hear the entire house , or was it a distant
Daddy
Wink's hacking cough, which has gotten worse since last we heard it, fills the room
Hushpuppy tries to shake him awake
Hushpuppy looks through the gap in his shirt
On Wink's chest, surrounding his heart, a corroded spider web of purple bruises shows through the skin, like varicose veins covering his entire heart
Hushpuppy's eyes go wide with horror
'  - The beacon pulses on the distant horizon
Mamma
Is that you
The beacon does not respond
(') 've broken everything
29 - cloud of dust circulates particles
The Haze is blinding
distant  grows
Dark shapes tear through the haze in a deafening stampede
(
) Strong animals, they know when your hearts are weak
That makes them hungry and they start coming
We see one at first, then more join rank around it
The Aurochs are charging in a pack
They are a biblical terror; the horsemen of the apocalypse
'  - The turck moves through the cypress forest, signs are strewn everywhere pointing to Lady Jo's bar
It appears abandoned
Suddenly, the door  open
Walrus winces at the sunlight and pops a beer
He steps out the door and  into the water
Holy bowlegged Sarah
Hey partner
Hey Walrus
Wink pulls in the Turck and paddles to rescue the thrashing drunkard
They leverage Walrus aboard and lay him out on deck
(gauging his surroundings) musta passed out
Wink starts chuckling silently
His chuckle builds to a laugh
'  -  - They enter the bar, empty bottles, half eaten crabs, and general party debris are littered everywhere
30 Little Jo is sprawled on the floor under a table
Is she dead or just wasted
Little Jo
She awakes with a start and bangs her head on the table
Wink
Wink and Walrus run to help her up
(') ( ) You don't touch me you filthy bastard
( ) Wink, you get me
They both lift her
(') Goin' on all night `bout how tonight's the last night on earth we gotta make it count
Talkin' dirty right in front of Peter
Sorry Peter
Peter  enters from the Bathroom
Peter , my man
knew you wasn't gonna leave me man
Peter  speaks in his polite, level-headed, soft sweet voice
Oh no, oh no
(re: Peter ) That is one classic dude right there
Peter , you are a titan
Glad you stayed man
31 Wink jiggles Peter 's ample belly
Peter  giggles with glee
Wink puts one arm around Walrus and the other around Peter
He smiles to Hushpuppy
She laughs too, the first smile in quite some days
'  - The Bathtub crew are lolling in the later party stages
There is a rooster on the table looking like the most sober creature in the room by far
If  had wings,  know  could have flown in that bad boy
But  would have probably bounced off a tree, or
Hushpuppy lays on the table in pile of empty crab shells
Hushpuppy
Did  ever tell you the story of your conception
The bar crowd chuckles
(') When me and Hushpuppy's Mamma first met we was so shy, we used to sit around, and drink beer, and smile at each other
One day we was so shy we just napped
Wink's voice   as Hushpuppy's fantasy takes over
She closes her eyes
'  - Wink, younger and prettier, naps in an uncharacteristically colorful lawn chair
,   wakes him up
There in the yard, crawling slow and lazy, is a massive 15- foot alligator, breathing the heavy, slutty way alligators breathe
32 topless woman steps in front
Sweat beading on her perfect shoulder blades, down her perfect, back ending in a pair of boys' underpants- just like Hushpuppy's
Throughout Hushpuppy's vision, we never see Marietta's face, it's always covered, shot from the back, or out of frame
Marietta cocks the shotgun with one hand, Terminator 2 style
Lowers it on the gator
Wink sits up in  - her panties, and her long naked legs are covered with gator blood
She turns to Wink, her head
on her eye
She winks
'  - We follow behind Marietta's supple curves as she walks into the kitchen
Her white slip is almost see through
almost
(
) Back when Daddy used to talk about Mamma, he'd say she was so pretty she never even had to turn on the stove
She runs her fingers along the counter and the burners one by one as she passes
(
) She just walk into a room and water start to boil
Water starts to bubbles like a spontaneous volcanic eruption
Marietta reaches into the frigidaire, and pulls out two ice- cold beers
Ice melts down the bottles
She opens them on the counter, flawlessly
She walks over to Wink
Stands there
hot mess
Wink's voice
33 (
) Your Momma battered that gator up, and set it to fry
: '  - Wink tips his drink
and Hushpuppy popped into the universe maybe four minutes later
He empties the glass, sufficiently drunk now
(') got it under control
Wink looks away, lost in his own fantasy
'  - Over Marietta's shoulder, beads of sweat form along the strap of her slip
Good Lord
Wink looks, and meets her eyes
The gaze of a proud and smitten man
Grits fall through the chimney vent, into the boiling water
Dancing like all the invisible particles of the universe
'  - Hushpuppy stares hard, her face locked in pride and determination
Filling with all the strength and heroism of her long-lost mother
She's ready to snap into action
-   - drops and we move in a semi-montage through Hushpuppy's search for survivors
Hushpuppy rows the Turck through the flooded Bathtub by herself
In the distance she sees a lone horse
It stands on an tiny island of land, the last high ground in an endless stretch of water
34 The horse holds Hushpuppy's gaze
She hears it's strong, resilient
They are one and the same
-   - Hushpuppy approaches Schoolboat, which has weathered the storm relatively intact
Miss Bathsheba
- Hushpuppy opens the door
We hear  and  inside school
It's three little girls left behind in the storm , a tall, wild-haired leader; , a tiny thing in a giant man's tee shirt, and -, the muscle of this girl gang, looking very meek in her desperate condition
The girls are huddled against each other, terrified, hungry, and alone
'  - Miss Bathsheba, shell-shocked but steadfast, steers the boat toward the bar, the four girls now safely in her care
From the inside we hear , , and '  -  - Wink pours a mountain of crab and shrimp at a great communal table, assembled from many different tables
Come on lets go
Time to eat
Come on children, feed up time
He sends a feast sliding across the floor under the table, where Joy, -Lou, and Lizard dig in
Wink has decorated the bar with all the waterlogged relics of the Bathtub
35 The room is a shrine of people's chairs, umbrellas, clothing
We're late in the game, and the party has descended into utter debauchery
Jean raises a glass
To the last of the food
To the last of the water
You ain't drinkin' no water
Miss Bathsheba pour shots and toasts
Yea, tastes like more, alright
Hushpuppy struggles to peel her shrimps, sitting on top of the table
(
) For the ones we'd never find, we make a funeral the Bathtub way, with no crying allowed
Drunken Wink is giving drunken Walrus a bath as he eats
When the water goes down, 'm gonna French kiss the dirt
Water's not goin' down man
Nah, that's my beautiful place under there
Man you know they got plenty of salt coming into that water, everything beautiful is gone
Trees are gonna dies first, then the animals, then the fish
got it under control
36 Hushpuppy picks up a crab
She tries to pound it open, tries yanking on a leg
She can't shell it
Come on Hushpuppy, come over here lemme show you how
Hushpuppy sits down next to Jean, a good pupil
(') Here baby
You hold like this, then you turn it over like that
Hushpuppy follows instruction in deep concentration, but a bit tentative
We see Wink look away from Walrus and Jo's bawdy humor extravaganza and focus in on Hushpuppy
His disdain is palpable for this froufrou shelling technique
(') Don't be scared of it now
Now, you take this knife, and you pop this off
Jean holds Hushpuppy's hand and guides a knife to open the belly of the crab
(') Atta girl
Hushpuppy-- Wink  the table
And the party falls suddenly silent
Wink pushes the utensil away
He grabs a crab, opens it in three virtuosic hand motions
Grease and spice explode everywhere and Wink sucks the face of the crab clean
It is beautiful to watch
He slams a fresh crab in front of Hushpuppy
(') Beast it
Hushpuppy looks to Miss Bathsheba for guidance
You heard your Daddy
Beast it
37 Hushpuppy pulls on the crab shell with all her might
She doesn't have the power
( ) The kids jump out from under the table and chant
Hushpuppy is turning blue, her eyes bulge with effort
Hushpuppy opens the crab claw and sucks down the meat
Everyone goes wild with applause
The kids too
Hushpuppy stands up, ascending to the top of the table
She lets loose a   and flexes her muscles, deadly triumphant
Little Jo gets so excited she starts dancing on the table
She  and jitterbugs wildly
Walrus gets up to join her
Jean gets up and dances too
All the kids get up
Wink glows with pride
Miss Bathsheba smiles
Yea
You see what kinda family we got
We got feeling
-  - kicks in as we  through the transformation of the Schoolboat into a ramshackle Ark
(
) It wasn't no time to sit around crying like a bunch of pussies
The survivors whittle sticks into spears, bend metal debris into spikes
(
) We was gonna build a camp right on top of the Bathtub
38 Jean Battiste, cackling wildly, hauls a thrashing goat onto a floating animal pen
Chicken coops, snake cages, a pig pen are stacking precariously
We got enough animals to eat until the water goes down
Rafts are lashed to the sides of the school
Every floating structure left in town is hauled in and added to the Ark
Peter  ties on a floating vegetable garden
In  we see what looks like a small village of floating structures forming
- Miss Bathsheba puts Lizard's head in her lap, Lizard is playing as if she's unconscious after hyperventilating
(teaching a lesson) Come here, like this
She takes Hushpuppy's hand and places it on Lizard's chest
She moves her hand in a circular motion
(') Like this
Tee-Lou get some water
Tee-Lou runs to get a handful of water
(') Quick little circles
Good for the heart
Joy Strong
Joy turns her back
Miss Bathsheba shakes her head
Tee-Lou returns and pours water on Lizard's head, cooling her
(') This is most important thing  can ever teach y'all
You got to take care of people that's smaller and sweeter than you are
Hushpuppy registers this advice, takes it to heart
She rubs Lizard's chest with delicacy and affection
39 Lizard's breathing returns to normal, and she sits up peacefully
Hushpuppy is awestruck
Bathsheba gets to her feet
(') That's better
- Hushpuppy watches Wink sleeping
His breathing has gotten worse
She tiptoes up with her red basketball jersey and lays it down on Wink, tucking him in just right
is heard
Cutting off suddenly as we
: - quiet town, not unlike the Bathtub, but with tangled power- lines, electrical towers, and layered hills
stone flies from behind a house and bounces down the street, denting the silence
Slowly, the peaceful morning transitions into  , a distant
Suddenly the house in the foreground explodes to smithereens and the head of an Aurochs drives through it
Without breaking step, Aurochs maraud the village, trampling it into oblivion
We settle close on an Aurochs eye, emotionless and relentless in its calm
-  - Wink, Hushpuppy, and the Bathtub crew pole the Turck through a lake blanketed with carcasses, pushing through the dead fish, dead porpoises, dead alligator garfish like they were lily pads
There is no wind, only dense wet heat searing on the faces of the characters
The once green foliage has gone brown and thirsty
40 Two weeks later, everything started to die
(to the water) Come on fishes, where y'at
Wink empties his net- nothing but a pile of carcasses
He tips it back into the water
Wink pulls himself to the edge and sticks his head under to look for fish
Hushpuppy looks at him with an air of doubt for the first time
Wink looks ridiculous, a dead fish drifts off his head
() You wanna leave the Bathtub, Walrus
( ) Nah
Wink pulls his head back up
heard that
Hushpuppy fidgets guiltily
(') Nobody's leaving the Bathtub
You don't know nothing
Wink lowers his net back in the water
(') ( ) This water gonna kill us here
We gotta do something `bout this ain't starvin' to death while them people go grocery shopping up there
-  - The kids sleep on Miss Bathsheba in a big pile on the floor
41 Hushpuppy wakes hearing  and a  behind her
Peter  is uncapping a shotgun shell and pouring black powder into a small jar
She looks out the window where Jean Battiste is unhooking a propane container from Miss Bathsheba's burner
He opens her chest freezer and hefts out a 12-foot garfish, dropping the container in the water
Shit
Wink sneaks up and whispers to Hushpuppy
Boss, Daddy's gotta take care of something
Hushpuppy is instantly concerned, she's heard this line before, and it always leads to trouble
(') 'm gonna fix everything back how it was
Everything gonna go right back
Hell yeah, we gonna win
Wink pounds his chest in solidarity
Hushpuppy matches his pound, but without confidence
(') Boss, anything go wrong, Walrus is Daddy
Wink and Hushpuppy look Walrus-- the face of doddering drunken bewilderment
goat licks him
Hushpuppy is not comforted
(') You're gonna be the king of the Bathtub,  promise that
Wink can see he's getting nowhere
42 (') Just sit here 'll be right back
The   wakes Miss Bathsheba up
She scans the room, noticing the three missing people
(an unconvincing lie) think they be gone
- really can't say where
Walrus, don't make me slap your ass
They go to the levee
Walrus is intimidated into silence
(') You so much as piss on that wall, you know what them people gonna do
They gonna smoke us out and stick us in a damn shelter
Hushpuppy watches Miss Bathsheba go for her boat keys
(
) Daddy says, brave men don't run from their home
Hushpuppy scurries out the side window, escaping outside before Miss Bathsheba sees her
- Wink, Jean Battiste, and Peter  keep their heads above water as they float under the tarp behind the truck bed
Peter is wearing a life jacket and still has his top hat on
() Peter , don't hold onto me, hold onto the boat
You gonna be fine
Jean Battiste duct tapes fireworks around the bomb: a propane tank with an igniter made from a battery and a pouch of black powder
He inserts the bomb into the stomach cavity of a giant garfish carcass
43 Wink shoves two propane tanks inside the belly of the garfish
He hands a rope attached to the igniter to Peter
(') Peter , you hold the trip-line
(Soft and sweet) Ok then
Just don't pull `til  say
Ok then
You can do it
have complete faith in you
Ok
Jean Battiste is hesitant
Wink gives Jean Battiste a confident nod
Lock and load
Jean Battiste carefully unravels the string that leads to the fuse
He shoves the igniter down the mouth of the garfish
,    - The Turck pulls into an enclosed segment of the levee, Wink bobs out from under the Turck and latches a pre-made tether running out of the garfish to a handle on the wall
He bobs back under the boat
- Hushpuppy dives under the fishing net on a motor boat just before Miss Bathsheba charges outside and keys the ignition
Hushpuppy peeks out and the boat roars to life and rips across the water
44 (
) The entire universe depends on everything fitting together just right
If you can fix the broken piece, it can all go right back
/  - Peter  hand me the- He looks, Peter  has both hands on the Turck
(') Peter you didn't drop the trip- line
No  did not
Peter  thinks a moment
(') Oh, yes  did
Oh, Peter
'm sorry
Wink dunks under water
- Wink surfaces in front of the igniter rope
As he grabs the rope, Bathsheba's snake catcher snares his hand and pulls his arm against the side of her Jon boat
Here's how we do with wild animals
Get off me woman
'm trying to save the Bathtub Hushpuppy watches the struggle in hiding
45 Bathsheba wrenches the rope out of Wink's hand and chucks it
The igniter rope lands in front of Hushpuppy under the net pile
She grabs it
She reels it in
Get in the Boat
'm hauling you're ass back home, little boy
Jean Battiste swims out of hiding
Wink
Jean Battiste, get the trip line
Suddenly, Hushpuppy pops out from under the nets, holding the rope taught
She stumbles and almost sets if off by accident
Hushpuppy
She got it
Pull
Pull
No
Hushpuppy
Hushpuppy, contemplates in an eerie peace
The screaming chorus  and she is alone in her quiet, eyes darting between Bathsheba and Wink
Courage and certainly clench inside her her
You listen to your Daddy
She pulls the rope
- The trip-line releases the detonator
-   - The levee
Shattered wood and cement fire towards camera
46 Debris propels Hushpuppy backwards
Her quiet resumes as she lands on the deck of the boat in slow motion
She watches in a daze as smoke, water, and flaming dust cycles above her
All the beauty of the universe
-   - Water recedes in the Bathtub, revealing the tragic, mud- soaked remnants of their paradise
Hushpuppy slogs through the muck, each step going two feet down into the stinking filth
The crew trudges behind her in silence
- The blow-up crew crests a hill and sees the remains of the ark sprawled across an open field
Wink's and Hushpuppy's eyes well up as they beholds the state of their island
The water has drained
Everything is dead
More striking than the ripped-up houses, the land surrounding the island has disappeared
Trees are gone
Shards of marsh that had been attached float in the distance
What was a dense, green landscape is barren
The Bathtub is a scorched hell
- - - Hushpuppy picks through the rubble of the Shacko in the Backo
She finds their grill, and a window made from a dryer door and brings them to Wink
The Shacko has crash landed under the stilts of a house that's been entirely washed away
Wink has done some work reassembling the walls and broken parts into a semi- functional enclosure
- - - Hushpuppy find nails and brings them to Wink, who leans wall panels against the stilts from the previous house
47 He hammers nails wearily
His strength is sapped
He out bile
(
) It didn't matter that the water was gone
Sometimes, you can break something so bad, that it can't get put back together
/
-   - Hushpuppy climbs the stairs of the original house to get to the top of the Shacko
She looks down through the hole in the floor
In her  Wink climbs into bed, he painfully takes his shirt off
The bruise on his chest has extended all the way across his stomach
Hushpuppy looks out on the water for some sign that Marietta's still with her
The light shining on the water is off
She sees nothing but dead trees and a defunct oil rig
Mamma
Nothing
(') Mamma where you at
As if in response, we hear a
This is a mandatory evacuation area, you can no longer live here
Everyone in this area, has to leave
repeat
- Hushpuppy wades through the muck in what used to be a lush forest, now reduced to toothpick trees and mud
She finds her storage unit in the tree hollow, and lifts out the medicine jar
48 (
) When you're small, you gotta fix what you can
-   - She pours the crushed up roots into Wink's mouth, careful not to disturb him
Wink dooesn't move
Hushpuppy gently folds in the orange fungus
Quiet, quiet-- Wink spews up an explosive cloud of medicine
(') God damn
Wink grabs her medicine jar and threatens her with it
(') What you doing
He smashes it against the wall
(') What the hell's wrong with you
Hushpuppy is so upset she doesn't know what to do
She screams in anger
Raaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh
Raging, Hushpuppy breaks everything she can get her hands on, ruining everything Wink's reassembled, tipping shelves, pans, walls
She grabs a fishing pole and starts bashing Wink's grill over and over
You wanna throw things
Come on
can do that too
You want to play that game
Let's throw stuff
Wink joins in, breaking stuff too, channeling all his anger into the destruction
Wink throws himself into the wall
It breaks off and dumps a series of shelves all over the floor
49 Hushpuppy can't believe it
Suddenly it's cathartic, they start throwing objects at each other and laughing
(') Come on
Come on
Wink pegs her in the face with a stuffed animal and she grins
Hushpuppy throws a pillow
(') Hushpuppy throws a shoe
(') Hushpuppy and Wink destroy everything in the house
Something goes off in Wink chest
He grabs his heart and collapses on the floor
Hushpuppy realizes something's not right
She throws a life- jacket at her father
Wink continues to force a smile at her
Hushpuppy won't return the smile
Man
You think  don't know
Hushpuppy's bottom lip starts quivering
Wink's smiles disappears
Hey
No crying
Don't you cry man
Don't you cry
He threatens her with a shoe
Hushpuppy hides behind an overturned chest
(') Don't cry damn it
Wink hangs his head and catches his breath against the wall
50 (') Shit
He pull himself to his feet and grabs a bottle of moonshine
He sets up two cups on the table
(') Come on get a drink
Wink pours Hushpuppy a shot
Hushpuppy sips
Winces
Looks suspiciously at her father
Sips again
Wink takes one straight from the bottle
(') This counts as 'm sorry for a whole buncha things
Lord
You gonna be gone
What
No
You gonna leave me alone
ain't gon' leave nothing
Cause if you be gone,  be gone too
Hushpuppy, that is not how it works
will
Sometimes in the bed start shaking and can't stop got what you got
No man
That's just a side effect of being a stupid little girl
51 ain't gonna be dead
No
You
No
You gonna live a hundred years more
You know what, show me the guns
Hushpuppy shoves Wink
(') Show me them guns man
Wink clears everything off the table with one sweep
(') Show me the guns
Guns
guns
guns
guns
guns
Hushpuppy flexes her biceps
She begins to chant, fierce and -- Guns
Guns
Guns
Guns
() Guns man, give to me
Guns

Wink holds up his hand to arm-wrestle
They  in tandem as Hushpuppy pins him hard
(') Ooooo, Hushpuppy you the man
Who the man

Who the man

Wink is overcome with love
It's too much for him to bear
(') Fuck this table
In a violent euphoria, Wink grabs the table and hurls it across the room
This scares Hushpuppy
She stares silently at her wild animal father, longing for something more than rage
Wink takes a step toward like he's going to comfort her, then stops, turning back
(') gotta lay down hear
gotta be strong
Don't be scared
Wink lays down in the corner
Hushpuppy doesn't go to bed, she just stands there
(') What
Hushpuppy waits, not backing down
(') ( ) Come here
Hushpuppy goes to Wink
(') Lay down
Wink pats his heart for her to put her head down on it

Hushpuppy opens her eyes, still tucked in Wink's arm
Through the wall she sees  - men
They are out of place like aliens exiting their space ship

He instinctively pulls him and Hushpuppy behind the over-turned table and grabs a broken chair leg to defend them with

) (from outside the door) This is a mandatory evacuation area
Everyone in this region has to leave
Wink hurls the chair leg at the intruders as they try to enter
54 We ain't going nowhere
Hushpuppy grabs a chair leg as well
It's a standoff
'  -   - Three evacuation workers ram the door of Little Jo's house
Little Jo greets the intruders brandishing a cutting knife and civil war era pistol
You gonna have to shoot me cause 'm not going
2 Ma'am we're not gonna shoot you

She spits
They get closer

The Muscle grabs her by the weapons and in the struggle, slam her to the ground
It's horrible

Get your hands off of her

Stressed, amateur looking doctors from the real world move in and out of the glass doors
makeshift sign reads "Open Arms Processing Center
" -  - The interior of the refugee camp is violently, fluorescent- lit and painted white in an attempt to maintain a facade of sterility
Hushpuppy stares at the strange and modern ceiling like they've descended from another planet
(
) It didn't look like a prison, it looked like a fish tank with no water
The Bathtub residents walk through the gymnasium which has been converted into a holding tank/hospital for refugees
Student doctors are examining, treating, feeding people
The abandoned souls, the sick, and the old are lined up waiting for assistance
-  - processed egg patty jiggles weirdly as it hits Hushpuppy's tray
Don't eat that

Mr
Doucet, can  have a word with you, we found something in your test
It's- Whoa whoa whoa, not in front of my kid
Stay, Hushpuppy

Maloney puts up his hands in peace and Wink shoves him through one of the curtains and is assaulted by a flood of orderlies

You keep your hands off her

Hushpuppy is snatched as she fights to come to his rescue
Daddy
They tackle Wink to the ground
He goes limp as he falls

He is sedated and being pushed in a wheelchair
He looks through an open door
In Wink's - Joy, Tee-Lou, Lizard, and the rest of Bathsheba's original school class play in a room with a She tickles Hushpuppy, who has been given new clothes and looks like a normal little girl for the first time
Her boots and boys underpants have been traded for a delicate blue dress
The image is jarring

don't want your hug
The Babysitter squeezes Hushpuppy
Hushpuppy tries to squirm away
Hushpuppy, that's not how nice girls act
Say "'m sorry ma'am
" Hey
Say it
Say it or you're going to corner time
Hushpuppy's eyes meet Wink's and she freezes at his horrifying appearance
Wink grabs a sofa trying to stop the wheelchair as it rolls by
His fingers slips off, too weak to hold on
He tries to scream and nothing but a   comes out of his mouth
He tries to pull the tubes out of his arm
(gently moving Wink's hand ) There there, sir
Hushpuppy stares in shock as Wink is wheeled away
- '  - Hushpuppy watches in hiding as a hand covered in a rubber glove changes the bandage on a surgical scar; it looks infected and mishandled
The same hand puts pills in Wink's mouth
-   - Hushpuppy stands over an old man on an artificial respirator
She's creeps closer, examining him
She puts her head on his chest
His heart is beating

) When an animal gets sick here, they plug it into the wall
She whispers in his ear
58 They're coming for you

(
) Daddy says, if he ever got so old he couldn't drink beer, or catch catfish, that  had to put him in a boat, and set him on fire, so no one could come plug him into the wall

She sees two orderlies force pills into Wink's mouth
He's regaining his strength and is able to hold them off momentarily before submitting, and going limp
Hushpuppy bolts, unable to take it
We stay in the room as the orderlies walk away
Wink peeks to make sure they're gone, then spits his pills on the floor
Wink stares at the ceiling for a long beat
Then, with a burst of energy he grabs his morphine drip and topples himself onto the floor
He pulls his wires out

Walrus comes running down the hall, pushing Peter  on a gurney
Wink looks bewildered, the rest of the team seems to have their own plan afoot

Go home
Everybody get up
Don't you want to go home
Lets go
These people don't care about you
Little Jo fights off an orderly with a syringe
You live in this hell hole

-   - Wink runs the kids toward the bus, they pass two busses labeled for Salt Lake City, Des Moines
Wink helps Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard get on
Then Hushpuppy
Suddenly Wink's hand slips out of Hushpuppy's
He steps away from the evacuating bus
Hushpuppy turns and the bus door slams between them
(from outside the door) Make sure you put her somewhere good ok
Wink sags
He's giving her away
He turns to leave
(banging on the door) ain't running
No
60 Wink walks away from the bus, his chest heaving, his face clutched in the horror of what he's done
Behind him, the bus pulls forward, then veers violently
Hushpuppy charges the driver clawing at her face, punching and kicking
(') Let me go
The driver pulls the break and Hushpuppy bangs the doors open
She charges Wink from behind, gives him a diving shove
He topples over

Hushpuppy stares him down, accusing
Daddy's dying
Hushpuppy's chest heaves up and down
(') My blood is eating itself
You know what that means
61 Don't be sayin' about dying
Everybody's Daddy dies
Not my Daddy
Yes, your Daddy
Her defiance is broken and the information starts to sink in
It hurts Wink as much as it hurts her
(') didn't want you to watch that, ok
You understand
Wink doubles over hacking
He  horribly
Hushpuppy looks down and sees blood spotting the grass, dripping from his mouth
The Bathtub gangs charges out the door
Across the parking lot they go in a spree of euphoria, coming to a halt around Wink
Hushpuppy is trying to drag his limp body across the parking lot
Come on
Come on
Little Jo hold Hushpuppy away from him
Walrus, get me home
- The Bathtub crew carries Wink through the entrance to town
His arms slug over Walrus and Jean Battiste, he's barely able to help walk
We sense from the weary faces and silent eyes that it's been a long journey home
62 /
- They drag Wink through the Shacko entrance
Everyone goes in except Hushpuppy who stops outside the door as they lay him down in convulsions
She stays and tries to watch
Wink tries to say something to Walrus and can't
Blood bubbles out of his mouth
Wink catches Hushpuppy's eye then looks away as fast as he can
Reeling, but steady, Hushpuppy backs out the door
- Hushpuppy walks down the road in an almost eerie state of calm
She takes in the remnants of rusting houses and flipped boats, her lifeless ghost town
(
) Everybody looses the thing that made them, it's even how it's supposed to be in nature
- Now with her three friends, she tip-toes past several humongous footprints up to a gruesome fox carcass
Something gigantic has ripped open its stomach and gutted it
She leans over, unafraid, trying to understand it's meaning
Flies swarm and nibble, their movement almost elegant
Seen in close up, the gory mess has a strange beauty to it
(
) The brave men stay and watch it happen
They don't run
springs her upright, she looks around for the source of the sound
Is it an Aurochs
She looks towards the muddy bayou
The   sounds again and the entire body of water quivers with the impact
- The beacon blinks out on the water
63 Hushpuppy stares towards it
The children are gathered behind her
Something has changed in her eyes
The eerie calm has given way to a hardened determination
Though unclear to us, her internal path of action is certain
She takes a deep breath, and lets out a
She runs straight into the water with her girl gang charging behind her
- Joy, Tee-Lou, Lizard, and Hushpuppy swim through open water, pulling each other forward
They head in the direction of the beacon
Come on
Keep going
They try to kick toward the light but are getting nowhere, the current pulls them backwards
We hear a   and they look to where an with a cabin that towers into the sky like a giraffe head, appears through the mist
-  '  - The girls climb aboard, lifting each other onto the deck
They look up to the sound of  on the upper deck
Hushpuppy looks up to see   (60) - big, timeless looking man with a salt and pepper moustache, saunters up to the rail
He stares down, examining these runts with an air of suspicion
'm going by my Mamma
He smiles broadly, as if this was the secret password
Him and Hushpuppy stare at each other and immediately there is understanding
Two lost souls in the wilderness
That's a good place to go
64 -  '  - Hushpuppy sits adjacent to the Sergeant in the tug's elevated wheelhouse
They are two stories up, and the white walls create a glow that makes us feel like we're almost in another dimension
Which way are we going
Don't matter baby, this boat'll take you exactly where you need to be
It's just that type of boat
Hushpuppy and Sergeant Major share an ease unlike anyone else we've seen Hushpuppy interacted with
The speak like an old teacher with his favorite disciple
They let their silences last
(') You want a chicken biscuit
Hushpuppy shakes her head `no'
(') They're good for you
deep, far away melancholy settles over him
He munches on a chicken biscuit, then tosses the wrapper on the floor
The wheelhouse is wall to wall with chicken biscuit wrappers
(') been eating these all my life keep the wrappers in the boat, `cause they remind me who  was when  ate each one
The smell make me feel cohesive
wanna be cohesive
Oh you will be,  got no doubt in my mind
They let this thought settle, then Hushpuppy turns her swivel chair back toward the water 65 The beacon appears through the mist
Hushpuppy's eyes go wide
As they approach, another boat comes into view
half- sunken barge that looks as though its been rusting in the same position for a century
As we move in we see a lit up sign: "Elysian Fields Floating Catfish Shack " /
-  - Hushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard disembark onto the barge with Sergeant Major following behind
They circle around a hatch in the floor with light pulsing out of it
Far-away echoes up from the bowels of the ship
They look to each other in wonder
-   - Hushpuppy descends a ladder into a glimmering wonderland
Christmas lights swallow the ceiling, and a light smoke facade encompasses everything
We feel like we're looking at a portal into the past, a Belloq-esque turned New Orleans Jazz parlor
The regulars are all oil-workers wooing their ladies of the night
There is a stage with a  and two singers, karaokeing along with "Until the Real Thing Comes Along" by Fats Waller
The hyperactive  , the matriarch of this establishment, comes a'hoppin'
Holy crap you have toddlers
Good afternoon, Miss Frankie
Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit
How you, Sergeant Major
You need some grits
Yes ma'am
66 Holy Sugar, they are so precious
'all just as cute as a tub of puppies
Women descend on the kids who recoil, not knowing what to do with all this affection
Joy Strong puts up her fists
Hushpuppy pushes through the crowd nonplussed by the flurry of doting ladies
They are not who she is looking for
They are not who she is looking for
She scans pictures of strippers through the ages pasted up all over the ceiling, each of them with a bra hung on it, none of them right
Bar patrons nod and tip their glasses to her as she passes, ladies smile and return to their drinks, drunk flirtatious dancers giggle at her, but she remains unfazed
She reaches two swinging doors that lead to the kitchen
Hushpuppy stops
Sniffs
Heaven
: in Hushpuppy's , smoke curls through the swinging doors, the light illuminating the dust particles
It's a magic kitchen
Her  tilts down to the floor where a pair of well-pedicured feet in flip-flops walks towards the swinging doors
They open
Hushpuppy holds her breath
gorgeous  (35) wearing a baseball cap and an apron comes out the double doors
She wipes some sweat off her brow
She watches the band and kills a bottle of ice-cold beer
The Cook looks down
Sees Hushpuppy
You need something baby
Hushpuppy nods, holding her breath
She still can't speak
(') Well whatchu want
You alone
Hushpuppy shrugs
She's too stunned, too shy to speak
67 The Cook takes stock of the helpless creature in front of her
Like a butcher shop owner with a pesky hungry puppy, she submits to Hushpuppy's longing gaze
(') Get in here, 'm'll show you a magic trick
Hushpuppy follows her into the magic kitchen, knocking her head against the swinging doors on her way in
- With the smooth fanfare of a circus performer, The Cook lifts an egg, opens a beer bottle with her teeth,  the cap at the egg and it cracks over the grits
Hushpuppy's face is joy beyond all measure
She watches the Cook's flying hands, she prepares everything in a single motion, it's like a dance
She slaps a fresh alligator tail on the table and begins sawing through the scales
Lemme tell you somethin', when you're a child people tell you that everything's gonna be all hunky- dory and all that bullshit, but 'm here to tell you that it's not
So get that out your head right now
She removes the knife from the gator and aims it at Hushpuppy like its a pointer
(') Life's some big old feast, yeah, but you
You ain't nothin' but a stupid little waitress
She scales a gator, strips the bones, dredges, fries
(') Everything you got on your platter gonna fall on the floor and ain't nobody gonna be there to pick it up for you
Someday it's all gonna be on you
68 She stirs the grits
Grits on plate
Gator on plate
Plate in front of Hushpuppy
Lemon is squeezed all over everything
(') So smile, girl
Hushpuppy tries to crack a grin
She barely remembers how to smile and it comes out all wrong
The Cook shakes her head, opens another beer on her teeth, and heads for the pantry
(') Nobody likes a pity-party-having- ass-woman
Hushpuppy stays behind staring into the floating particles of dust in the incandescent light-- stars of the universe
The golden bubbling fry pot-- lava of the molten core
-  - Four perfect gator nuggets are placed next to a sumptuous dollop of grits
The gator's magic
Hushpuppy looks up from her food-hypnosis
(') (encouraging a smile) Awwwwwwwww
real smile emerges across Hushpuppy's face
(') Mmm-hmm
-   - Magic soars as the couples rock back and forth on the dance floor
Strippers cradle their dates
It's all very sweet and tender
This seems to be the
of this strip club, slow-dance not pole-dance
The kids are each dancing with a stripper, glowing with love
They are orphans in a heaven of mothers
69 We float back to Hushpuppy, the camera dances with her and the Cook
The Cook squeezes Hushpuppy and spins her
Each time we catch their face their eyes are wetter and wetter
You can take care of me
Me and Daddy
After a long beat
The Cook shakes her head `no
' don't know nothing bout your Daddy,  can't take care of nobody but myself
This sinks into Hushpuppy
(') You can stay if you want
Hushpuppy considers this for a moment, squeezes the Cook
This is my favorite thing
know
far-away look has come over her
Her mind is somewhere else
(
) can count all the time 've been lifted
'  -    - We look up at a face that's slowly coming into focus- it's Wink, younger and healthier
(
) can count all the times 've been lifted on two fingers
70 He is the first sight of the slimy newborn baby girl tucked in his arm
Baby Hushpuppy stares up at him as he carries her
'  (
) Wink
Bring my baby here
They need to wash her off
Naw, that waits
Baby Hushpuppy's huge-eyed, warped facial expression ogles Wink
She coos
(') ( ) Alright fatso, breathe some air
They pass through a doorway and sun washes over Baby Hushpuppy
She smiles and smiles at the world
-  - Back in reality Hushpuppy gathers herself
She's suddenly not hugging back, just being held
need to go home
() No
Hushpuppy cups her hand to the Cook's ear and whispers something inaudible
The Cook squeezes her tight, seeming on the verge of adopting her
But she can't
She spins Hushpuppy around and around, then puts her down withouth meeting her gaze
Hushpuppy watches her disappear into the crowd of swaying couples
All goes quiet, and we sit behind Hushpuppy's head, a sea of light like a crown around her
Decisively, with the force of a charging general, Hushpuppy turns and runs toward camera
71 - to Hushpuppy leading Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard across a ridge dotted with Dead Oak trees, she's come back to the Bathtub
-  - The camera moves over the water, past the dead oaks
We turn the corner past a stretch of marsh, and come upon the Aurochs, four of them, now suddenly and viscerally in the landscape of the Bathtub, swimming steadily toward solid land
- The Bathtub crew sits by Wink's bed
His eyes are open, but everyone is silently waiting for the inevitable
- The children crest the ridge
The  of Aurochs hoofs is suddenly and violently audible
Hushpuppy turns
She catches a glimpses of something massive moving behind the distant oaks
The kids turn and hustle down the ridge
Hushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard hustle down hill with increased urgency
The   is growing louder
Behind Hushpuppy the dark shapes of the Aurochs crest the ridge in a deafening
Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard scream and sprint out in front of Hushpuppy
Hushpuppy walks steadily forward, refusing to run
Her face locked with determination, she is unafraid
Her eyes shoot toward the shacko
- Wink, with all his strength looks toward Hushpuppy, their eyes meet
72 In Wink's , Hushpuppy stops dead on the bridge, waiting for her fate, staring toward her father
- The Aurochs bear down on Hushpuppy from behind, their footsteps rattling the frame
They grow inconceivably large, the camera has to tilt to hold the frame
Hushpuppy balls her fists and stands her ground
Suddenly, she turns
The Aurochs
Then, inches away from Hushpuppy, she stops
She , blowing Hushpuppy's hair back
Hushpuppy doesn't flinch
The Aurochs stares face to face with Hushpuppy
Sniffs
- Wink is frozen in wonder, unable to believe his eyes
- Hushpuppy raises her chin in confident defiance
Now in full profile, we see the Aurochs towering 15-feet tall, she takes a step forwards, sniffs again
low , or is it a purr
The Aurochs lowers her head with respect
Her eyes well with emotion, recognizing one of her own ferocious warrior
The Aurochs steps back, takes a knee, and with a that rattles the very earth, she lays down
Her three companions follow suit, their fat tummies settling into an almost joyful, lazy, repass
strange calm has settled over Hushpuppy
Almost a smile, but more of a peace and an affection for her equal
They're both children in their way
You're my friend, kind of
73 Mother Aurochs grunts, a sentence only Hushpuppy can understand
(') gotta take care of mine
With weary and clumsy steps, the Aurochs stand and retreat
- Hushpuppy approaches the shacko
It's like walking the plank, but she's unafraid, at one with her destiny
The Bathtub crew look on her in awe
They part ways to let her pass
She reaches the door, steeling her reserve
Hushpuppy opens the door
- Wink is curled up on Hushpuppy's bed-- very, very thin
His eyes are closed
His chest heaves up and down in short violent breaths
Hushpuppy stands and stares
Wink looks at Hushpuppy in reverence
He knows it's the last time
Wink motions for her to come closer
Hushpuppy inches toward him
It takes all of her might
She sits on his bed
Hushpuppy takes her to-go container from Elysian Fields out of a paper bag and pops it
She unwraps a gator nugget, dips it in hot sauce, and holds it out for Wink to take a bite
Hushpuppy watches as Wink chews weakly
She eats one herself
Wink and Hushpuppy draw it out
They don't want it to end
It takes a full minute for him to swallow the first bite, and she paces herself to finish when he does
( ) Real good
74 Wink's chest heaves up and down, harder and harder
tear rolls down his face
(') ( ) No crying, you hear
She holds them back, being tough for her Daddy
No crying
Hushpuppy's face hardens, and even as the tears fall, we see a strength and composure that only Wink could have put there
She falls into his arms and he embraces her
Hushpuppy squeezes Wink
She does not let go
She stays strong
Wink's hand trembles on her back
She holds him as his deep, warm, heartbeat slows, slows, and stops
His weight slumps over her
She keeps on holding him, but she knows
- Steadfast, Hushpuppy holds a torch on the edge of the Bathtub
The Turck, piled with branches, floats in front of her
She lowers the flame and lights a cloth covering Wink's body aflame
She pushes the funeral pyre out into the current
We watch the boat flames drift into the foreground, covering Hushpuppy face with flames
She looks into them in all her grief and wisdom
The group begins a funeral prayer, playing quiet in the background as Hushpuppy contemplates the pyre
As  stand by the bayou, Everyone else joins him
ship at my side starts her motors and sails for the gulf
watch her until she disappears
"There
() 75 (') She's gone
" Gone where
Gone from my eyes, that's all
She's just as big as when she left me
And somewhere else, other voices are calling out, "Here she comes
" And that is dying
They raise their drinks to the sky and shout in unison
(') Hushpuppy gazes into the sparks leaping off the top of the fire are foregrounded in front of Hushpuppy, particles of Wink jumping into the sky
, droning low, and building into an funeral dirge
(
) When  relax behind my eyes  see everything that made me flying around in invisible pieces
When look too hard it goes away, but when it all goes quiet,  see they are right here
The Turck almost disappears over the horizon
The  take a hopeful turn, the melancholy of the dirge mixing with the anthem of the Bathtub
(
) see that 'm a little piece of a big, big universe, and that makes things right
Hushpuppy stands tiny on the ledge of the Earth, framed in front of an expanse of endless water
- - - The Bathtub gang marches across the marsh road
Hands touch the town sign, saying goodbye
(
) When  die, the scientists of the future, they gonna find it all
They gonna know, once there was a Hushpuppy, and she lived with her Daddy in the Bathtub
76 We   to reveal that the water is rising and washing over the road
Our heroes are marching on the final sliver of land
The camera flies backwards, and our view of the road disappears into mist and churning waves
They appear to be walking on water
Hushpuppy leads them forward, into the future
