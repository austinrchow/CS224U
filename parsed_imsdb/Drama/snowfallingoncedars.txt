"Snow Falling on Cedars", early, by Ronald Bass Ronald Bass First Draft Screenplay March 3, 1997 ,    - Fog
Penetrated only by sound
The  of sea at a drifting hull
Tendrils of mist part, revealing
a face
Strong and blond and handsome
:   15, 1954 from below, we watch  , high on the cross spar of his mast
He has pulled a  of  from his rubber overalls, and is  a  in the cloud of mist, as the tiny, meticulously neat cabin
Empty, silent
tin on the counter's edge
The battery well open, revealing two large  in place
to
the deck of this sturdy stern-picker
The fishing net stretched from the huge  into the sea
Keep  to the bow, where
Carl stands with his kerosene lantern and his air horn, watching as another  comes slowly out of the mist
The silhouette of a , holding a long fishing
As fragments of fog part, we  on the figure's face, to see
his eyes
They are Asian

,    - Blinding sun
Our boat bobs lifeless on placid water
As , two figures slowly reel in the massive net is painfully thin, unimposing, methodical
Only the eyes reflect his disquiet
His young deputy,  , cuts anxious looks between his mentor and the sea
As the net brings silvered salmon across the gunnel,  to
the cabin
Tidy as before
Only two things have changed
on the tin coffee cup, which now lies  on the floor
above the open battery well, where a third now stands next to the wheel
to
the stern, as the raveling net  from the water's surface
the face of Carl Heine
Turned to the sun

As  , tilt up to the coroner,  , gazing down
shading of regret behind the professional mask

Whaley's hand pulls the  of  from Carl's pocket
examines the open, empty   at Carl's belt
Carl's wrist, its  stopped at 1:47
Whaley bends over Carl's body, presses on his solar plexus, watching pink  rise from Carl's mouth and nose
And then
He sees something more
His fingers gently pull back the hair from above Carl's left ear, to reveal
a skull wound
The bone caved in
Four inches across
- Snow falling on cedars
:   6
The heavens descend softly onto our island
Exquisite, silent, hypnotic
An epic snowfall inspiring awe at our frailness against the limitless scope of nature
As  , a series of cars pirouetting, skating on their tires, past an abandoned school bus, where kids throw snowballs at is windows
Fisk's Hardware Center, its endless queue of orderly citizens waiting stoically for their snow shovels and kerosene
the harbor, with its moored fleet of tiny fishing vessels blanketed as if by volcanic ash, a pair of teenage lovers building a snowman at the edge of a dock, she pushes the boy into the water, and he rises laughing, steam rising from his clothes
undulating strawberry fields of pure white, untouched and flawless as the Sahara
Finally, to a public building, cars gathering as best they can, people streaming up snow-laden steps to the entrance, and as we them,   to
- on impassive
They are Asian
We have seen them before
to see
Early 30's, dark blue suit, clean shirt
He sits ramrod straight, utterly motionless, expressionless, the eye of a storm of movement in
the assembling
packed gallery of buzzing locals, the scent of anticipation
bank of  and , cosmopolitan in attire, bearing themselves as jaded dignitaries from the civilized world
As we  their ranks
(
) It was the first murder trial on the island in thirty-one years
we look over the right shoulder of  , early 30's, dark, a rugged, somber man jotting notes on a pad which rests on his right leg
(
) Our only newspaper was the San Piedro Review, a four-page weekly that  operated alone
He glances blandly at his nonchalant colleagues
(
) What,  wondered, could the Seattle boys know of the hearts of these people
To the
Truck farmers, grocers, fishermen, in sober neckties
waitress, a secretary, fisher wives in Sunday dresses
(
) Neighbors, sitting in judgement
On their neighbor
To the neighbor
The ramrod-still defendant
(
) Kabuo Miaymoto sat with the rigid grace of a Samurai warrior
As if detached from his own trial
Ishmael writing on the pad balanced precariously on his knee, until
(
) Did he know how dangerous his demeanor could be
With this jury
it falls with a  of pages
He reaches with his right hand, replaces the pad on his thigh
Around him,  are being swung to the ready
Ishmael looks to see
a slender  of refined beauty, entering the courtroom
few flashes , and Ishmael's right hand retrieves a venerable box camera from beneath his seat, as his notepad falls once more, unheeded
(
) Hatsue Miyamoto had been without her husband for 77 days
Ishmael pivots, and we understand his struggle with the notepad
For he is forced to rest his camera on the stump of his amputated left arm, its empty sleeve pinned at the elbow
(
) He was in jail
When his baby son learned to walk
Through his , we see  take her place in the first row
And sensing her presence, her husband turns
Their eyes meet
string of
But none from Ishmael
He hesitates
As if considering whether he will violate this woman's privacy
The camera lowers
on his face
- to Hatsue's face
Staring, impassive, empty to see that she sits alone on a wooden bench by the courtroom door
Her hands rest delicately on the purse in her lap
Her demeanor as removed from this place as is her husband's
(
) Earlier,  noticed her in the corridor
to see him alone, in shadow
It is more than a notice
Ishmael stares with fixed intensity at the motionless woman, as she gathers her thoughts
moment of decision
He approaches
Stops, respectfully, at a distance which will not invade her personal space
And softer than we might have imagined
Are you all right
She turns her head only slightly
It is enough
Her voice quiet and firm at once
Go away, Ishmael
There is no anger
Only directness and resolve
Please don't be like th
(softer) Go away
- the back of the courtroom
Twenty-four citizens of Japanese ancestry fill the last row, dressed in their most formal clothes
Shades of Atticus Finch
As one, the Japanese-Americans watch
the prosecutor,  , a crisp, even dapper man
There is a quickness about the eyes, a tendency to sharpness of manner, that he works carefully against
four inch gash, skull crushed, and your thought was, what
, tall and gray and rawboned, leans on his elbows, his eyelids droop slightly, a deceptive masking of keen attention
(
) That he
fell
Hit his head on the gunnel going over
The witness is Sheriff Moran
He answers as if this were a sincere question
As if he had never heard it before
Well, Carl was six-four, went 235
He was a grizzly bear and an able seaman
Ishmael watching
Thinking on that
(
) For him to just
go over
Crush his skull like that on the way in
on Ishmael
- Teenage  in football uniforms
They ride with their helmets in their laps
(
) He was a mountain, all right
Anchored the line for us little fellers
on Carl and Ishmael at 18, riding together
Ishmael, dark and rugged even then, is scarcely little
But dwarfed by the blond giant at his side, who glares out the window, at
Chambers
'see the geese
snow geese landing in low flooded wheat
The grace of it holds both boys
Picture'd be nice
In your pa's paper
Ishmael nods absently
They stare, side-by-side
Lucky  got the camera in my helmet
They never look at each other
They never smile
But you can almost hear one in
Careful, Chambers
That was almost a joke
- Hooks now stands with his polished shoe up on the witness podium
Like chatting with the Sheriff across the back fence
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound
Nossir
'd gone to tell the wid
to tell Mrs
Heine
And his glance inevitably goes to the first row behind the prosecutor's table
Taking the glances of the jury with it
is pretty and blonde and full-bodied in her modest black dress
Composure and dignity
Against her grief
- Moran climbs from his vehicle, as Carl's young  dash around the corner of the house
Seeing the Sheriff, they stop cold
Silent, shirtless, barefoot
Hey there, men
Is your mother home a-tall
He spits his Juicy Fruit into a wrapper
And as the younger boy nods across the distance
(
) Sheriff Moran, hullo
She has appeared in the doorway, smiling, spittle-marked baby's diaper across her shoulder
And he smiles back
Tells the boys
You go on and play, now
But they don't
So he follows into her entryway, closing the door behind him
And at the foot of her curving staircase
What can  do for you, Sheriff, Carl's not home y
That's
Too quick
He stops himself
And she sees that
It's why 'm here
'm afraid have some
very bad news to tell you, the
worst
kind of news
She looks at him, uncomprehending, the smile only beginning to fade, before
Carl died last night
In a fishing accident
In White Sand Bay
She only blinks
As if translating the words from a foreign language
No, Carl's fine, h
We found him, Mrs
Heine
Tangled in his net
And with these words, a slack, blank look crosses her face, and she stumbles back one step, sitting down  on the bottom stair of her curved staircase
He doesn't know what to do
She digs her elbows into her lap, and begins to rock, very slowly, wringing the diaper in her hands
Her face is more terrible than tears
It is frightened
She murmurs to herself, so that we can barely hear
told him this could happen
- on Hooks, nodding
As if, slowly, digesting something in his mind
So, no
immediate suspicion, no
general talk of enmity between the two
These are fishermen, Alvin
They don't talk at all to each other and less to me
Specially gossip
- Ishmael walking down the sunlit wharf
Purpose in his stride
(
) gill-netter works through black nights with only himself to talk to
And learns to be silent
They were lonely men and products of geography
Up ahead, the Susan Marie has been brought to dock
Moran stands chatting with a knot of six or seven
(
) men who, on occasion, realized that they wished to speak, but couldn't
As he arrives, Moran smiles a thin greeting
Not happy to see him
Of course, neither is anyone else
Figure you'da heard by now
Ishmael shakes his head in silent helplessness
, a sunburned, big-bellied, tattooed gill-netter, clamps on his damp cigar butt
You go fishing, it happens
(to Moran) You see Susan Marie
did
Boy
Three kids
What's she going to do
(disgusted) Well, what can she do
Jesus Christ
Excuse me, Gjovaag
don't need to excuse nothin'
Fuck you anyhow, Chambers
Everybody laughs
It is all good-natured, sort of
(
) Like the Sheriff,  did not work the sea, and could never merit trust
Or respect
Sheriff's been askin' which boats followed Carl out last night
(quickly) Only to see if somebody talked to him out th
So who talked to him
Out there
Staring
At each other
Eye contact holds during
(heavy Danish) So far, we figured the guys who went to Ship Channel Bank, was Jim Ferry, Hardwell, Moulton, Miyamoto
(spits) Japs
All right, look, if you see these boys
Never saw you so hard-ass, Art
Ain't this just an accident
Moran finds his eyes drifting to Ishmael's
Which are right there, waiting
Moran looks away
Course it is, but a man's dead, William
got to write my report
Ishmael and Moran, walking alone back up the wharf
The Sheriff is worried
Finally
'm not gonna see some article about an investigation, am
(quietly) You want me to lie
No,  wanna be off the damn record, that's what  want
No answer
They keep walking
mean, if there is a killer, why would you want him all alerted
Silence
Silence
And slowly
Let's say
someday need some cooperation from you on this thing
Do  get it
And looks over
Like the guy holding all the aces
- Moran fidgets on the stand
(
) No sign of a struggle, you say
him now
, attorney for Kabuo Miyamoto, stands beside his impassive client
Nels is 79, blind in his left eye, a little shaky
His body is winding down
Well, the coffee cup was layin' right in the middle of the floor, like said
And with a fella so neat as Carl, that did seem peculiar
And Nels begins to walk toward him
Limping, as he comes
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him
that leaves only a single overturned cup in its wake
(
) Objection, asking the witness to speculate
My gosh, Alvin, was  supposed to object every time you did that
real
Friendly smile
(wearily) That's quite enough horseplay, Nels, why don't you act your age
If  did that Your Honor, 'd be dead
Some gentle laughter
Judge Fielding doesn't even bother to look annoyed
Any more homely loveable tricks, and you'll be worse than that
Proceed, gentlemen
There's an objection, Your
And it's overruled, answer the question
If you can recall it
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin
And forgot the cup
Right
In the middle
Of the floor
Maybe
Nels nods to himself, as if considering that
So that the jury will do the same
think you testified all the lights were on
Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog
And yet you started the engine right up
With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge
Did that strike you odd
Didn't think about it at the time
So no, it didn't strike me odd
Does it now
little
Yes
You have to wonder
You have to wonder
And lets that sit
Scratches his neck
You found three batteries, you say
-6 and -8 in the well
And a spare -8 on the cabin floor
Correct
It is
Now  did some measuring down at the chandlery
-6 is one inch wider than a -8
It would be too large for the deceased's well
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting
You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the -6
But he had a spare -6, you said
Right there
Why not use that
It was dead
We had it tested
Maybe the -6 was the spare and he had to use it
Ah
Maybe he carried a spare that was too large to fit
So he'd have to bang out the flange to squeeze it in
No answer to that
The silence rests
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on defendant's boat
Two -6's
That's the kind his well was fitted for
No spare
No
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with no spare battery, hmmn
Apparently
'm curious
The -6 that was refitted into the deceased's well
Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's
beat
believe so
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net
Stops
Thinking
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in
don't think so
You don't
Think so
He was heavy, but we were real careful
But  don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere
You don't
Remember And clears his throat
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds
is it possible Possible that he struck his head after death
Possible
Possible
But not darn likely
(turns to jury) No further questions
And limps back to the defendant's table
Where Kabuo Miyamoto sits watching him
- Horace Whaley, the county coroner, folds his stork-like limbs uncomfortably
Searching for the appearance of ease
so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head
He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him
'  And  said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here
' Shakes his head, with a wry, disgusted smile
Did you say more
said that if  was playing Sherlock Holmes
'd maybe look for a
Japanese person
With a bloody gun- butt
right-handed fella, to be precise
And why
Is that
Slight shrug
Well,  was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war
saw those kendo wounds, many times
Looked exactly like this one
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is
Japanese stick-fighting
They're trained as kids, y'know
To kill with sticks
And the prosecutor's eyes drift to the defendant
So that the jury's will do the same
on Kabuo's regal bearing
His neutral mask
(
) No further questions
- Mist of early light
Two dark figures, little more than silhouettes, measuring each other with their lethal bokken staffs
We may think of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, for one is a full- grown man
The other, eight years old
Dialogue plays in subtitled
Hips, stomach, cut Stomach muscles tighten as stroke advances
And  a fearsome blow, which the child  with startling proficiency
We can see 's stony face, now
If he is impressed by his son, he does not show it
Elbow soft, or there is no follow- through
You cut your bokken off from the power of your body, unl
The boy  fiercely, the man parrying each stroke with blinding ease
Hips sink more
Less weight on the heels, so tha
The father has sent a blow in mid-word,  the child like a doll
The boy  up, snatching his bokken into ready position
(very quiet) Zenshin
Is constant awareness
Of dang
The child has unleashed a blow at the left side of his father's
It has been blocked
The staffs rest against each other, just above Zenhichi's ear
There is no anger in either warrior
That we can see
Elbow soft
little better
father and son sit on the ground, eating a small meal
The sun has risen, angling light across the undulating fields
They are alone in beauty
long silence
Dialogue in subtitled You can be good with the bokken
If you begin to concentrate
Eyes on his food
As if alone, as if speaking to himself
The boy darting glances, unseen, at his father's profile
You must choose now, Kabuo
At eight years
If you want this
(boldly) want it
The father keeps eating
Never turns
Then speak quietly
So you may be heard
- Whaley stares down the end of his needle-nose
The air of disdain of a man playing chess with an unworthy opponent
(
) So this
foam you found in the lungs
How does it get there
As  testified
It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration
believe  said that
(slightly confused) But a drowned person can't breathe
Of course not
The foam means that he went in breathing
Ah
That's why the autopsy report identifies drowning as the cause of death
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard
Well
Your report says death by drowning which means he went into the water alive and breathing
And the report is accurate
(bristles) Of course it's accurate, but
Of course, it is
Now as to the head injury
You say made by an object narrow and flat
That is your inference , correct
(really pissed) It's my job to infer, that's what coroners do
You get hit with a crowbar, or a ball-peen hammer, or fall off a motorcycle, the injuries look different, that's my area of expertise
Nels nods
He can be quiet now
The witness distracted from volunteering the opinions Nels did not wish for
In your motorcycle example
Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled against an object
Rather than the reverse, yes
Obviously
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around
Or would both look the same
The same
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have
If the head was moving fast enough, but  don't see how it could be
Is it possible
Sure, anything's poss
Is it fair to say that you do not know for certain which it was
already said that, b
And that you can't say for certain whether the head injury was sustained before or after death
Whaley thinks
For certain, no
But you are certain that he died by drowning
For the third time, yes
Nels nods
Whaley is beyond frustrated
Can  say something, here
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand
The report says 'recent origin'
How recent
As much as 24 hours before death
Absolutely not
Probably one or two hours
Four at the most
pause
Are you absol
Yes , 'm sure
Nels nods
Silence
Thank you, Horace
No more questions
Horace wants to say more
Doesn't immediately move
We'll take our luncheon recess
Reconvene at
2 o'clock sharp
The gavel  onto the block
Judge Fielding stands to leave, and the  begins to usher the jury from its box
Abel Martinson, the deputy, stands near as Kabuo rises
As he puts his hand gently on Kabuo's arm, the defendant turns smoothly
to face a woman
Standing at the rail
And beneath the courtroom buzz
How are the kids
The voice so colloquially American, we are taken back
Having envisioned Kabuo as a silent Samurai
They need their father
The look holds
Abel increasingly uneasy
Well
Just a few more days
(coughs) Look, Art's gonna want me t
(ignoring him) You look beautiful
Abel grasps his arm
look terrible
Don't sit so straight like Tojo's soldier
The jury will be afraid of you
He thinks about that
Abel tugs him
Okay, 'll hide under the table from now on
That make you happy
And for the first time
He smiles
And seems suddenly very American indeed
She stares back, her heart in her eyes
Abel tugs harder, but he can't budge the defendant
'm not going until you smile
But she doesn't
So his fades
One last look
And he lets Abel lead him away
on her
Watching him go
- Stars above a desert
Wind gusts
barbed wire, rows of dark barracks blurred by swirling dust, to
a fragile tar paper structure, its 'walls' rippling pre- cariously
And inside, to see that it is
- a makeshift sanctuary
Candles, offerings of fruit
young together before a Buddhist
Kabuo and Hatsue
Becoming one
- cramped, ramshackle room
Dust blowing through gaps in the flimsy beams
Kerosene light
hangs the last of the woolen army blankets to divide the room in half, as her four youngest  watch
We   the blankets to the other side, to see
the newlyweds
Standing at a window in their wedding clothes
Kissing
Slow and full
Until she whispers into his ear
They'll hear everything
And her young husband turns
Speaks to the curtain
(loud) There must be something good on the radio
She giggles
His hands trace her body
(louder) Wouldn't some music be nice
And in a moment
The  begins
Glenn Miller
song that sent our boys off to war
And our young American prisoners
begin to undress each other
Her slender fingers find the buttons of his shirt, deftly undoing it, as he kisses her face
He unclasps her dress
And as it falls from her shoulders, falls to the floor, we   her eyes, and
her  of
a beach
Two 10-year-old  floating on the water
Clinging to a wooden box, with a glass bottom for fish-watching
The girl is Asian
The boy is not
Ishmael
See the yellow one
And the boy wriggles around, leans over the box, as if seeking a better view
And  the girl
Full on her startled mouth
the newlyweds
On their cot now
Close together
Naked and hungry for each other
(loud) Can the music be louder , please
We can't hear so good in here
The girl laughs soundlessly
And as the music , he has slid his body above hers
whisper
Have you ever done this
whisper back, sure and strong
Never
You're my only
And as he enters her
As she holds him close with all her strength
Her lips breathe into his ear
so right
- Hatsue watching her husband disappear through a door to see across the way
man stares at her
(
) Course, we grew up together
- Hatsue at 12, sits with an   who guides her silently, exquisitely, through the ritual of the tea ceremony
(
) Her mom had this Mrs
Shigemura come on Wednesdays
Teach her how to be Japanese
The woman turns the cup in her hands
One-quarter turn
Bows slightly, as she presents the tea
(
) Dances, calligraphy
Doing her hair
How to sit without moving
- Hatsue and Ishmael, both 12, are sprawled on the ground, sheltered in the hollowed-out base of a cedar tree
They watch the rain as it pummels the woods around them
She is speaking, carefully, thoughtfully
He listens with complete attention
(
) She would tell me stories of this woman and her lessons
As if complaining, or at least ex- plaining her world
He shifts his position, his body brushing against hers, which makes him reflexively pull away
She seems not to notice
(
) But  always fantasized
The lessons were for me
- Hatsue sits at a bedroom mirror
Mrs
Shigemura watching analytically, as Hatsue weaves her hair into a thick plait
No
You must never look at a man directly
This is part of grace
The girl smiles a small sour smile
Speaks quietly
don't think the boys on this island
Are impressed
By grace
The old woman studies her without irritation
Hakujin know nothing of life, Hatsue
Apparently, the girl has heard this before
This is why they fear death
Because life here is separate from Being
The girl takes a long pin
Begins carefully to fasten her hair
Breaking eye contact with the mirror
It is why they have no soul
Is the girl even listening
The old woman's voice never rises
Remains patient
Life embraces death, includes it
This truth brings tranquility
You must see yourself
as a leaf
On a great tree
No irony in the girl's voice
No disrespect
The old woman reads the young face in the mirror
The pin
Could be better placed
- on 12-year-old Ishmael
Neutral eyes
Eating an apple horrific  surrounds us
The clash of metal on metal
(
) My lessons came from my father
They were different
Or seemed so, at the time
See   now, at the printing press, an enormous lime green contraption, with rollers and conveyor pulleys in a cast- iron housing
The shrieking of metal and gears recalls an ancient locomotive
(
) He operated the Review alone, with an integrity and passion for principle that made him a figure of respect
If slightly larger than life
Arthur is a large, rugged man, with round gun-metal rimmed spectacles and garters on his shirtsleeves
He wears the soft, perpetual smile of an Oxford Don, as he gracefully ducks in and out of the machine, inspecting plates and printing cylinders
(
) He never spoke of wanting me to succeed him
And, in truth, it was the last job on earth  thought 'd ever want
The boy rises now
Sets his apple carefully aside
And under his father's supervision, takes his place operating the press
His arms inches from the fearful clatter of the rollers
(
) When  was five, he casually mentioned that if his sleeve got caught in the press, he'd be instantly popped open like a child's balloon, and splattered across the walls
Watch Ishmael running the monster, coolly, efficiently, with complete concentration
(
) Even his bones would disappear, to be discovered later on the floor, as strips of white confetti
Arthur turns away, lest his son feel a lack of confidence
Picks up the boy's apple
crisp
(
) Which, of course, made me certain that life would have no meaning until could run that teakettle
,   - Arthur and Ishmael, now 17, strolling Main Street in the midst of what seems a festive carnival
(
) He was, for better or worse, the only God in my life
guess it's our nature to resent those we know we can never measure up to
They are passing modest parade floats, booths with food and games
genial crowd of farmers, fishermen, families, both races heedlessly mingling
community
Arthur unselfconsciously slips his arm over the shoulder of his tall son
(
) which keeps us from accepting the warmth
The way we should
Up ahead, a crowd has gathered at the steps of the courthouse
Something's up
(
) Every summer, after harvest, the Strawberry Festival was Dad's favor- ite story to cover
Good news was his preference
Making him an oddity among journalists
As we approach, we see a ceremony begin at the top of the courthouse steps
(
) Highlight was crowning the Strawberry Princess
Always a Japanese girl, sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice to the concept of racial harmony
We are there now
Arthur pulling down the same box camera Ishmael would use years later
Focusing up at the , as he places the crown on the radiant young girl
(
) Senior Year
It was Hatsue
And as the applause ripples through the crowd
As the Strawberry Princess acknowledges her subjects, her eye falls on
Ishmael
She drops him a wink
And a special wave
(
) She winked at me
In public
Which was unusual
- Two 14-year-olds alone on a beach
Digging for clams in the mud
(
) had kissed her once, when we were ten
Looking at fish through a glass-bottomed box
It was just an impulse, and no big deal
Ishmael pulls back from the deep hole, to make room for Hatsue to reach down
We can see her fingers explore the shell of the dug-in geoduck clam
He's still got a good grip
We need to dig more
(
) At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me
As if all of our times alone together
in the hollow cedar, everywhere
were a secret
They are digging now, together
Carefully
(
) told myself that was good
That it made our friendship special
And didn't mean she was ashamed of it
Necessarily
Easy
Slow is best
Gently, she begins to dislodge the clam from its lair
(
) thought about her
Sometimes, all the time
knew  was unhappy
But  knew if  told her
She lifts it clear
And as she admires its size and roughness with her fingertips
As she washes it in the shallows
He watches her movements
(
) It might be a mistake
could never correct
(quietly) like you
The words make her turn
Not startled, exactly
Alerted
But neutral, without affect
Do you know what  mean, Hatsue
've always liked you
There is no answer
He leans slightly closer, and she looks down
This is the moment
Afraid and driven, he moves slowly to her face
And puts his mouth against hers
She lets him and, encouraged, he pushes harder, making Hatsue
lose her balance, and planting a hand beneath the water to support herself, eyes closed too tightly, she kisses Ishmael for a long moment, before
leaping up, snatching her clam pail and running  down the beach like a deer
He stands slowly
To watch her go
(
) knew in my heart that we would love each other forever
His face is slack and unsmiling, but he is helpless with happiness
Contemplating this truth
(
) The way she kissed me
She knew it, too
- Ishmael crouching at the edge of the farm, in near-darkness
(
) She avoided me for a week
Across the distance, the screen door opens, light slips across the porch
Hatsue appears with a wicker basket, to take the laundry from the line
(
) So this way,  could see her without
bothering anyone
He watches, rapt, as she unpins and folds the clothes, clenching the clothespins in her teeth
Then reeling the line again, elegant hand over elegant hand
(
) was certain everything would work out
She corrals the long sweep of her hair, knotting it deftly, before heading inside
(
) And frightened
- Children working fields in sunlight
Kneeling in the rows
Hatsue with a half-dozen Japanese girls, her hair loose, her face lightly sheened with sweat
She works with efficiency and grace, filling her flat
Three rows away
Ishmael watches
The fear not far beneath the surface of his quiet, dark features
(
) By two weeks,  knew  had made the defining mistake of my life
Hatsue's gaze drifts slightly in this direction, and Ishmael looks rapidly at his work
Cheeks burning, certain she is watching
Which she is not
(
) 'd ruined everything
end of day
The young pickers turning in their flats as a gentle rain begins
Hatsue counts her money, slips it into her pocket, and
runs lightly off, into the growing rain
Ishmael sees
Stricken to his soul with longing
And indecision
- Hatsue, drenched, alone with her thoughts in the protection of the hollow cedar
The rain is driving now, and she glances up
At something we don't see
And watches it
Finally
You followed me, huh
to see him
Rain pelting off his poor soaked form
She is waiting for an answer
So
Sorry
It sort of
happened, just
followed you
'm sorry
She pulls her hair behind her ears
movement which stretches her body
'm all wet
She starts refastening her hair now, looking away
He comes inside, crouches as respectfully far from her as he can
Which is close
He watches her, watches her, and
'm sorry  kissed you on the beach
No reaction
As if she hasn't heard
Now his heart is beating straight through his chest
Let's just forget about it
Forget it happened
She picks up her damp straw hat
And, eyes down, tracing a finger around its brim
Don't be sorry
'm not sorry about it
His heart bursts within him
And he struggles to keep it from his face
Even though she isn't watching
Me neither
She turns her face to him, and offers a small smile
It is genuine, and therefore dazzling to the boy
She lies back on the ground
Her eyes so unafraid and direct
Do you think this is wrong
He swallows
Staring at her lying there so comfortably
(
) The best part was that there was a 'this'
To debate the wrongness of
Your friends would
Your dad would kill me with a machete
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael
He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword
Ah
Better
They are both grinning now
My mom
Would be the problem
Why
We're only talking
Her eyes flicker
The synapse that a woman can offer a man
(softly) Sure
And touches his hand
With her fingertips
The barest whisper
can't hear you
Thus invited, he leans down over Hatsue
Kisses her mouth with all the tenderness in him
This time, her eyes close gently
And her body arches slightly, into his
(
) We kissed for half an hour, that first time
And  knew there would never be another day like it
Rain  now
curtain of water, sealing them from the world
(
) No matter how long  lived
- on Ishmael, once more in the row of reporters
Absently kneading the stump of his amputated arm
The way some men drum their fingers
(
) you were acquainted with the defendant and his family
is a linebacker in a dress
Stout and German and wary
She is 57, and pulls her hem down tight below her knees
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land
Lived in a picker's cabin at first
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then
They fished t'gether
Went to school
Carl Junior treated him like a white person
Like any friend
Said not with pride, but regret
But the dispute began
With the father, yes
- Etta twenty years younger, watches stoically from the parlor window, as her husband   strools the strawberry fields with Kabuo's father Zenhichi
Carl is a huge rawboned man, and puffs a pipe as Zenhichi stops, sweeps his arms this way and that
Etta knows trouble when she sees it
- Etta pours her husband's coffee
It is very quiet
Don't sell, Carl
You'll regret it
Only seven acres, and the worst seven, at that
They're decent folks
They got five hunnerd to put down now Don't go wavin' new church clothes at me
We're not such paupers as sell to Japs, are we
For what, a pouch of fancy pipe tobacco
She walks about the kitchen with her arms folded
Too upset to be still
They work hard, live clean, don't spend nothin'
Even kind to the Indjuns
People is people, comes down to it
Etta turns sharply
Glares at the big man
He just blinks blandly, puffs his pipe
She can see this ship has sailed
You wear the pants, doncha
Go ahead, sell our land to a Jap and see what comes of it
- Hooks pacing, slow and calm
This part needs to be clear
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not own land
So
Carl held it for 'em
Called it a lease
They make payments every June and December
Why
If they could never take title
Their kids was born here
So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty
last payment gets made, and he could own it
She folds her hands
Looks Kabuo square in the eye
But they missed their last two payments
So that was that
- Carl Sr
and Zenhichi sit at the table
There is coffee
But it is untouched
Etta watches by the stove
(
) March 1942, orders came down
Japs had eight days before the Army was gonna cart 'em off
Carl lights his pipe
Compassion in his broad weathered face
(softly) Eight days
It ain't right
We must leave everything
If you like, you can work our fields, sell berries, keep the money
Otherwise, they just rot
(
) Japs are shrewd
Offer berries he can't use
Soften us up about those two payments still to come
And sure enough, Zenhichi produces a neat stack of bills
Puts them on the table
Today,  have $120 toward next paym
Absolutely not, Zenhichi
'm not gonna take your savings at a time like this
The small man spreads the bills out
On the table
Please, you take
Then,  send more from where 'm going
If not enough, you still have seven acres strawber
Thought you was givin ' us those
And everything
Stops
Didn't you come in here givin' them away
Now you want $130, after our labor and fertilizer
Is that what you come here hopin' on
Zenhichi keeps his anger within
His face is stone
(
) spit on him, and he's pretending it didn't happen that way
How could anyone trust people like that
You want more coffee
No, thank you
Take money, please
But Carl is staring at his wife
She stares right back
Carl turns, slides the money toward Zenhichi
Etta's been rude to you, and apologize for that
You keep this money, and those payments will work out fine
Somewhere down the road
- Silence
Palpable
Two figures sit at opposite ends of this darkening room, each under a lamp
Carl Sr
is reading the paper
His face is stone
Etta at a small writing desk strewn with bills and ledgers
Her face is angry
screen door opens
Slams shut
Big footfalls coming
No one looks up
Look at this
He stands in the doorway
bamboo fishing road in his giant hand
Kabuo loaned it to me
Til he gets back
And his parents stare back him
It's great for sea-run cutthroat
The ferrules are smooth, silk wrapped
Take that back
And do it now
The big young face is stunned, hurt
told Kabuo 'd take ca
Those Japs owe us
don't want nothin' confusing that
The boy looks to his father
Who says nothing
said now, boy
Supper's in forty minutes
Crestfallen, defeated, the boy backs away
Hear his footfalls
The screen door  hard
And Carl Sr
looks at his wife
No sound, until
We ain't right together
The words are flat and straight
Etta stoic
You and me
We just ain't right
- Hooks settles back
His butt on the edge of the prosecutor's table
The soul of patience and clarity
You said neither of the last two payments were made
But your husband told defendant's father that he could pay them
what, 'down the road'
And straight back
Road ended October 1944, when my husband passed away
She nods
That's all there was to it
sold all the land to our neighbor, Ole Jurgensen
Got a fair price, this time
And Straightens her spine
To deliver the clincher
Sent all their equity back to those Japs down in California
Which didn't have to do
Specially since my boy was out in the Pacific, gettin' shot at by Japs at the time
Hooks pauses
As if drinking this in
Now defendant's father had also died by that point
Where was the defendant
When you sent his family their equity
In the war
Europe,  believe
They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they
Kabuo watching the woman
Eyes as hard as her own
And when he came home
Did he write you about this
Or phone, perhaps
Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean
Wanted to talk to my son
' ,   - Kabuo stands at the open door
No one is inviting him inside
He's over the ocean, fighting the Japs
They're just about licked
(quietly) Just about
And there it sits
When Mr
Heine passed away, couldn't farm the place myself, could
You're gonna have to talk to Ole abou
just did
He didn't know we were one payment away
You didn't tell him Mr
Heine promised my fath
was s'posed to tell him there's some illegal contract muddling things up
You folks didn't make your pay- ments
In America, bank comes in and repossesses your land
didn't do anything wrong
Kabuo stands
Calm, unblinking
Nothing illegal
Wrong is a different mat
Get out of here
You sold our land out from under us, Mrs
Heine
You took advantage of the fact that we were gone
You
The door has closed in his face
And Kabuo stands there
As if deciding
Whether to break it down
- Hooks standing at the jury box now
Looking at them, as he asks
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'
Well
Every time  see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes
Givin' me his mean face
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto
Watch out for him
Did he see some danger from defen
Objection
Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind
All right
What did your son say to that effect
She looks up
As if trying to recall
He said he wished Kabuo would forget about his seven acres, and stop lookin' at us cross-eyed
Hooks stares at the jury
Holds the moment
Your witness
And goes slowly back to his seat
Nels waits until his opponent is seated
Then, rises
Just three questions
The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500
Tried to
Defaulted on their payments
Second question
What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre
thousand
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it
If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500
Is that your third question
It is
You done your math right
The old man wears a thin, cold smile
You, too
No further questions
on Kabuo
As he watches Etta rise heavily from the box
- Mist of moments before dawn
As tendrils part, there is enough light to see
eyes
They are Asian
They are razor-keen
to reveal
Kabuo alone in
gear and helmet
Rifle up high, sweat on his face, moving soundlessly, turning in a circle as he goes, until
he stops
heartbeat of silence
Then
the  of automatic tracer  through trees, as he and   in a single motion, until
Silence
His heart is pounding
He waits
Waits
Weapon at the ready, he pushes  the dense foliage to see
the 15-year-old German , splayed on the forest floor, his chest torn and bloodied
Kabuo's gaze  with the boy's
The young soldier's empty left hand reaches out in a a plea, and as Kabuo steps forward, the boy's right hand comes suddenly
view, metal  in motion, as Kabuo
the boy  with staccato rifle  that  the already-lifeless body like an electric jolt
And falling from the kid's hand, not a pistol, but
No expression on Kabuo's face
None at all
He moves on
- wobbles slightly in the witness box, hands resting on the cane planted unsteadily between his frail legs
His eyes leak water, his beard is wispy and unkempt
Were those his exact words
(shaky) He say Mrs
Heine robbed him
Mr
Heine never woulda let no such ting like that hap
Robbed
He was angry
Oh, yeh
He said someday he would get his land back
Hooks nodding
Nodding
Mr
Jurgensen
Did he offer to buy the seven acres from you
Oh, yeh
But this is nine year ago,  had my healt,  wasn't wantin' to sell
And then your stroke came this summer
And you put your property on the market,  believe you said September 7
Which, remember, is eight days before Carl Heine died
And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy
Carl Heine came
Hooks pauses
Lets that sink in
But Carl was a fisherman
And successful at it
He said he didn't want that life no more
He'd been saving to buy a farm
He was sorry  got sick
But pretty excited to get back his father's place
The old man's head bobs
Recalling
Liesel and me
Was happy for him
Hooks smiles
As if he would be happy, too
Anyone would be
And later, that same day
Only eight days before Carl Heine died
Did another prospective buyer appear
- Ole sits in a wicker chair at a wicker table
His wife  is setting out cold drinks
But their visitor stands rigid, disbelieving
'm sorry to tell you, we took his earnest money, he shook Ole's hand
Come November, he'll sell his boat, and take over the farm
Kabuo is thunderstruck
But your sign
We din't have no time to take it down
He just come ten o'clock
Kabuo nods
His voice is soft, but his eyes are steel
It's my fault
should have come earlier
He looks so odd, perhaps he's ill
Liesel looks concerned
If you want t'buy them seven acres
Carl Heine's the only fella can sell 'em
- The witness box is empty
The snow outside the windows is falling in darkness
And Judge Lew Fielding is leaning his frame toward the jurors
apologize for keeping you folks from your families in a storm like this
do hope you'll be reasonably comfortable in the hotel tonight
And one more thing
He smiles softly
This Court takes judicial notice of the fact that tomorrow is the 13th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor
Slight pause
To make sure they are listening
Which has no relationship to this trial
Which is why  mention it
Gavel  down
10 o'clock tomorrow, folks
Stay warm
- Hatsue walks briskly down the crowded hallway, her eyes searching the benches lining the corridor ahead
Her view obscured by the crowd hurrying to fight the storm
Suddenly
she stops
Because there
On a bench
Sits Ishmael
Next to him, a round Japanese-American baby boy of 11 months
Before him, squat the boy's sisters, eight and four
All are watching Ishmael
manipulating a
It rolls across his knuckles and back again, with amazing dexterity
Then, he snatches it into his palm
Holds up his fist
All little eyes are glued
The fist
opens
It is
There are
Know where it is
They don't
It's in my other hand
The four-year-old
Her big sister socks her
And Mom steps in
The man looks up, with the sweetest smile
Your mother went to the bathroom
She said  could show them a trick
-- ' Hatsue is not smiling
Nor is she angry
Even awkward comes to her in a graceful way
She scoops up her son
Thank you for your help
(to the girls) Let's go find obaasan
And without even glancing at him, she heads off at a brisk pace
The girls following
The four-year-old turning back to wave once
And then they are gone
- Kabuo stands outside the open steel door of his tiny cell, as Abel Martinson clumsily unfastens the manacles
cot, a toilet without a seat, a bare bulb hanging from a wire
No windows to the outside world
Only the small barred one in the cell door
As the manacles fall away
Abel removes two objects from his pocket
This is from Nels,  can't see the harm
Don't tell Art, okay
Hands him two
Snickers
And a Baby Ruth
Kabuo looks at them
In spite of himself
Kabuo smiles
Remembering
- Kabuo sits in jailhouse overalls on the edge of his cot
Motion- less
On a private journey of the mind
The door  open
This here is Nels Gudmundsson, he's your attorney
Kabuo looks over
That flat, unsmiling gaze
The old man has a folded chessboard and a Havana cigar box under his arm
Their eyes lock, as if the Sheriff weren't even here
And Moran leaves, closing the door with respectful quiet
Nels doesn't smile, doesn't speak
Opens the chessboard on the cot
Opens the cigar box filled with chess pieces, two cigars, a Snickers and a Baby Ruth
He puts the candy bars by Kabuo's pillow, a silent gift
Begins to set up the chessboard
What makes you think  play
Your daddy played
asked, down at the Japanese Community Center
You smoke cigars
And offers one up, rough and black
'm not sure
better check down at the Center
Kabuo smiles only with his eyes
Nels nods, maybe you better
Lights his own cigar
Puts the matches and the other cigar at Kabuo's side
White or black
You mean, do  like to take the offensive
Or hang back and wait
That seems answer enough for Nels
He turns the board around to where he has white, and makes the first move
Nice
When two fellas understand each other
Kabuo picks up the cigar
a match
white
Kabuo moves a black bishop
Nels' eyes shoot around the table
He reaches and   Kabuo's black king
Kabuo blinks, studies the board silently
Then smiles
He unwraps the Snickers bar
Breaks it in half
Hands one piece across to his lawyer
, different days, Nels in different suits, chess pieces in different positions, each time Nels reaching to topple Kabuo's king
The last time
Kabuo has to study the board for a beat
Shakes his head
You must think  like losing
think you like learning
And leans his old bones back against the hard wall
Me, too
That's why  come
Pulls out two cigars
Kabuo looks at them
Bet there's a few things you could teach me
Kendo, for one
Sure
could take a fishing gaff and split your head open
Right above your left ear
No smile
Steady gaze
You wouldn't even see it move
You're wonderin'
how come never ask
If you did it
Hands one cigar
Across the chessboard
Now, you've told me you killed four men
In Germany
So  know you are the kind of man who can kill
When there's a reason
(very quiet) Guess  am
Takes the cigar
Rolls it between his thumb and forefinger
You feel guilty
That you took their lives
That's in your eyes
a match
(softly) Jury sees what  see
More often than not
Reaches stiffly
Kabuo bends toward him
Accepts the flame
Takes a puff
Prosecutor thinks
What was your reason
To kill Carl Heine
Kabuo says not a word
Well, there is the land itself
Raise your children where you were raised
Sleep with your wife at night, 'stead of bein' alone on the sea
Brings the match to his own cigar
Careful
Expert
There's fairness and honor
You were cheated by that old bitch
Boy, she is something
(simply) She's not alone
Worlds within those words
(a murmur) None of us are
And in those
And prejudice, like you say
Your people locked in a concentration camp
You go off to fight for our country's freedom
Come back to this
Shakes his head
But Mr
Hooks has missed the one reason
One reason
You coulda done it
flicker
Behind the defendant's eyes
read you Etta Heine's deposition
So  could watch your mind
Like do when you move your rook, or when move mine
smile now
Very kind
Very sad
And you weren't thinking about her
Or about land
Or about you
No, you weren't
And in the gentlest voice
No, someone cheats you, you can rise above that
You're a family man
You put them ahead of you, hmmn
He sighs
But
Wasn't you she dishonored
And the old watering eyes are rock steady now
Your father was a strong and tireless man
Honest to a fault
Kind, and humble as well
There is a silence
And then
(real quiet) Nice
When two fellas
Understand each other
They let that sit
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye
And at you with the oth
Mr
Gudmundsson, we know what that jury is looking at
He won't let hs eyes lie to this man
Your father needs you
To return to your family
Silence
So every time you think about showing that jury strength
Or honor or composure
Or dignity
should show them an American
Nels sees the rage
It breaks his heart
It makes him feel old and helpless
Show them an innocent man
What he stares at now
Is a neutral mask
As powerful and opaque as the voice is quiet
Shame you couldn't play chess with my dad, sir
He'd kick your ass
'  - Through glass, snow is tumbling in endless cascades, the world dwarfed by a descending heaven

Neat stacks of books on the floor, catching the overflow of shelves crammed full

Finishes clipping the fingernails of his only hand
And looks out
At the magic of white

Italy
Somewhere
Far from the things that upset her
later, they lie so quietly
Her head nestled in the crook of his arm, he gently plays with her hair
Her face so still, so thoughtful and grave

Ah
Her dark eyes flicker
(dry) Kind of magical, the way you know how to comfort a girl
She cuts the irony by sending her fingertips to stroke his

- Hatsue sits with the Japanese kids
Ishmael with his friends
The bus filled with stone-faced teenagers listening to the , who brandishes his newspaper at the Japanese side of the bus
not just Pearl, they're attackin' all over the Pacific, the whole fleet 's destroyed
The 's in Seattle right now
And pauses
His eyes moving from one Japanese face to the next
Are you listening
arresting Jap traitors, the spies and everything
There'll be a blackout tonight, so keep your radios off
So the Japs don't pick up no signals
You get the message
Stares them down
Until, from across the bus
(
) Hey, Mr
Lamberson, over here
The driver's eyes snap around
The tall boy is waiting
have a radio, too
Don't you want to be sure got the message
Ishmael sees the anger
He's not afraid of it
Just checking
- The horrid  of the great rattletrap press, Arthur Chambers ducking nimbly among the rollers
(
) It was a special edition, an extra
My father wrote, 'These people are our neighbors, they have sent their sons to the United States Army
' Print flying onto paper as it rolls through the green metal gauntlet
(
) 'They are no more an enemy than our fellow islanders of German or Italian descent
' Belary-eyed Ishmael, pulling finished copies from the bin
As he stacks them for delivery, he reads aloud, above the  of metal
(sleepy and loud) ,    , Big yawn
It's really late
He turns, and sees
his father
Staring at him
(
) guess courage never inspires the young
Until the danger of it bites their butt
- They walk slowly up the path
An arm around each other's waist, their bodies brushing as they go
My father can't get our money from the bank
We have a few dol
It'll be over soon
can get you money
She stops
By a weathered fence, covered in vines
It's growing dark
It's not going to get better, okay
She sighs
He moves close, looks so grave
They arrested Mr
Shirazaki, because his farm is near a navy transmitter
And his family can't leave their house
What can he say
It's just Pearl Harbor
People are a little crazy, right n
Look at my face
It's the face of the people who did that
My father hardly speaks English
We're in bad trouble, you have to see that
He reaches
Touches this face that he loves with all his heart
Forces up a smile
Maybe we can fix your eyes
She leans up
her eyes in a goofy expression
Then kisses his mouth
When she pulls back
Don't let this hurt us, okay
Whatever happens
And she studies this boy
Knowing more than he can ever understand
And chooses to whisper
It won't
You'll see
- Hatsue and her older daughter are setting the farmhouse table, as snow drifts down beyond the window
Plates and flatware
Glasses and napkins
Slowly, in silence, as if a ritual bonding mother and daughter
She glances to the next room
her mother Fujiko plays with the babies
Her father  reads the paper
Smoking his pipe
And Hatsue is motionless for a moment
Watching him
- on Hatsue at 18, staring with silent anger greater than her fear
(
shaky) We are loyal
to see the room
Hatsue and her sisters side by side, staring at the table
On it rests a shotgun, four boxes of shells, a ceremonial sword
An  , a small man in a dark suit, is tagging each item
He wears a light, perpetual, insincere smile
Everyone on the island has these things
Fujiko at her husband's side
She is quietly indignant
He is frightened
(overly casual) Well, they'll hold this stuff for a little bit, then ship it back to you
It's nothing to worry about
And walks over to the tansu, a chest of drawers, and begins to remove items
You folks have been real polite, and we'll be outta your hair in just a second
a silk kimono with gold brocaded sash
That's very nice
From the old country, it appears
Very high class
And lays it on another table
Next to a bamboo flute, a stack of shakuhachi sheet music
These are real nice things
They'll take special care of 'em
Hisao sees his wife's sudden alarm
And, as respectfully as he can manage
The flute is precious
The kimono, the music
Must you take th
oh yeh, any old country stuff, we have to take
And sees on the sofa, an open album
Strolls over
This is only my daughter's scrapbook
For her memories
So he picks it up
Doesn't see Hatsue stiffen with repulsion, as he wanders, thumbing through it, toward the hallway
(calling out) Wilson
Don't go pawing through the underwear
And chuckles
He knows they appreciate a joke
It means there's nothing to be afraid of
Stops turning pages now
Looks up, his eyes moving until they find Hatsue
Strawberry Princess, huh
You musta been flattered by that
Looks just like y
The soft slamming of a screen door
Another , large and shambling in his too-small suit, is carrying a crate
And a telling look
#2 (quiet triumph) Dynamite
Twenty-four sticks
And the crate  onto the table
Just beside the kimono
Lifts out two sticks and holds them high
Proof
You must believe
This for tree stumps
For clearing land
The small man's smile fades now
First time
And his eyes fix Hisao before he speaks
As if reading his mind
Maybe
Maybe
But this is still bad, y'see
Fujiko slips her hand into her husband's
To give him strength
It's illegal contraband, you were s'posed to turn this stuff in
We, uh
Slight shrug
We gotta arrest you
Have to take you to Seattle
Fujiko's breath catches
One of the daughters whimpers
The silence hangs thick and frightening
The bigger agent unhooks a pair of handcuffs from his belt, but
Naw, you don't need those
Mister Eee-ma-da-san here is a class act, a real gentleman
The younger girls are crying now, clinging to their sisters
The agent regrets this
Please, reconsider
He has done no bad th
Well, nobody knows that yet, do they
So, best for an honest man to clear his name for godd and all
Ain't that right
Only a few questions in Seattle, okay
Few questions, few answers, the whole thing is over
He puts his hand on Hisao's arm
Not roughly, but much firmer than the ease of his voice
Simple as that
- Eight pages of a letter, carefully written in Kanji characters, folded neatly on a table
(
) Why do  read you this distres- sing letter
From your father
From this hakujin
work camp, it is called
In Montana
to see mother and five daughters around the table
Even the youngest girls somber, attentive
As if they have aged these past few weeks
Because you need to know the darkness
In the hearts of the hakuj
(blurts) Not all of them
The silent wake of her outburst, her interruption, lingers
Her mother studies her
The whites are enslaved by their egos, Hatsue
Each believes his aloneness is everything
We seek union wi
the ones seeking union with the Greater Life bombed Pearl Harbor
They are not humble
am not part of them, 'm part of here Her voice so loud, so insistent
Her sisters are afraid for her
To have shown such disrespect
They look down at their hands
Or away, as if not hearing
(quietly, slowly) see this
This lack of purity is a mist around your soul
see it every day, it haunts your face in unguarded moments
The room is still as the grave
The mother's eyes burn silently
see it in your eagerness to leave here
And walk the woods
In the afternoon
What does she know
Hatsue's heart pounding
And to her surprise, her mother's voice softens
If you lose your true self, Hatsue
True self
The stern warning, the unrelenting judgement, has become a plea
There is no way back
'  - Ishmael washing his supper plate
His fork and knife
His coffee mug
His skillet
Hard labor with one hand
And as he works, he looks at
the window above his sink
Darkness and moonlit snow
And his own reflection
on his face in the glass, and to
- Arthur Chambers
Weary
Worn behind the smile of knowing ease, as he sips coffee from a mug of his own
His boy sits across from him in the silent press room
Feet up, reading their paper
Its headline, See, you bring it on yourself
23 ladies honored by the , you single out three names
And they're all Japanese
That isn't journalism
(quietly) Because
Ishmael has heard this gently prodding word all his life
He sighs
Because journalism
Is just the facts
Which facts
You can't print them all
Journalism is balance
Finding the facts folks need to know
The boy looks dryly at his father
the page with the back of his hand
Hence
The letters
Arthur closes his eyes
Recites from memory
'Seems like you're favoring the Japs, Art
Writin' all about their patriotism and loyalty with nothin' 'bout the treachery

'Your newspaper is an insult to all white Americans

Even sadder
The calls are better

- They lie so close
Their bodies touching, not moving
Their faces inches apart, so that every word is a murmur
You're like me
You've learned to be devious
He's never seen her this fragile, this scared
He knows he has to be strong for her
It's not devious, it's what we have to do
You're leaving tomorrow
He unties her hair
So gently
Tries to keep his smile calm, steady
You write to my house, and put Kenny Yamashita's name on the return address
It's no big deal
He brings his face to her hair
Kisses it
You smell like cedar
Her eyes are wide
They move over his face
murmured
So do you
It's your smell 'll miss as much as anything
He looks in her eyes
And words come from his heart, before he can stop them
Let's get married, okay
Her eyes fill with tears
Are they from happiness
want to marry you
Is that okay
Her face so still
One tear falls, and he kisses it
(a whisper) Just say yes
No answer
Not knowing what to say, she winds an arm behind his head, and brings him nearer
His mouth opens into hers, with more force, more of his heart, than he has ever given
Deep and tender
His hands reach beneath her dress
peel her panties down her thighs
(
) When something that means your whole life
Is the last time ever
And suddenly, he is  her, drawing her legs up around him
(
) God should tell you
Or it's not fair
Her head tilts back, her eyes squeeze closed
And as he enters her
(whispers) Please say yes
her hands  his upper arms
And push away
(softly) No
And he blinks
As if waking from a dream
Everything has stopped
Her face is strong and yet overflowing with regret
No
No
It isn't right
So he draws away
Stunned, uncomprehending
Watching with blank eyes, as she stares up at him
Then, with dignity and tenderness, he helps her dress, his eyes awkwardly away from hers
It felt right to me
It felt like getting married
She draws her legs up
Kneeling now, putting her hands on his face
But no words come
No words
Until
'll write you
And  him fiercely, and  up before he can grab her, off like a deer, while he
kneels
His mouth open
Like a silent scream
- An army truck pulls up behind several others in cold morning air
Hesitantly, looking in all directions, Fujiko, Hatsue, and her four sisters climb from the truck, to see
(
) On Monday, March 30, 1942, the United States Army graciously transported the Imada women to the docks
a ferry, the , stands waiting
Soldiers are dis- tributing tags for luggage and coats
The evacuees, mostly women, stand in the cold, trying to smile bravely for each other
And lined against the railing
(
) Lifelong neighbors came to watch
Curiosity masked as kindness
a cluster of white islanders gawking as their Japanese neighbors file toward the ferry
middle-aged woman waves to Fujiko, who casts her eyes down, refusing to acknowledge the greeting
And just as they reach the gangway
Hatsue sees Ishmael, who stands at an unobtrusive distance, among a group of students
She pauses
Her eyes hold his for a heartbeat
(
) with some exceptions
The wisp of a smile
And she is gone
- Hatsue comes alone onto the white-blanketed porch
Snow is no longer falling
She takes out a cigarette, lights it impassively
The mannerisms make her seem fully American, despite the porcelain impenetrability of her Asian exterior
She closes her eyes, and
draws deep on the smoke
The act seems to cause her pain
When the eyes open, they are frightened, unguarded
Nowhere to turn
The next puff looks desperate, and she  the cigarette out onto the snow
Jams her hands in the pockets of her parka, stamps her feet against the cold, the helplessness
And looks out
strawberry fields, endless and white, shimmering in filtered moonlight, become
- a moonlit
the barbed wire, the distant barracks, the desolation
Come to
two women walking alone
The younger one glancing at her mother as they go
Fujiko's eyes unreadable, stare implacably ahead
The barracks, everything, in distance behind them
You think we're far enough away now
No sarcasm in the voice
She lets the words carry her irony
Her mother stops
Looks at her so directly, so strong
Even her tough-minded daughter flinches slightly
Mom, whatever this is, they don't keep war secrets this carefully
Fujiko thinks that over
Nods
Secrets are hard to keep
She goes over to a large, flat rock
Sits down
Pulls two sheets of paper from her coat
And waits
As her daughter comes and crouches at her feet
Fujiko clears her throat
This letter
Was opened
By mistake
And watches
As the shard of fear penetrates her daughter's mask
Silence
Then
(reads) 'My love
still go to our cedar tree in the afternoons every day
shut my eyes, waiting
' Hatsue has turned to stone
To ice
Wind blows
(reads) ' smell your smell
And  dream of you
And  ache for you to come home
So  can hold you and feel you near

Turns to the second
(reads) 'After all these years that we've been together,  find you're a part of me
Without you,  have nothing
All my love, forever

Her eyes calm, quiet
The neighborhood boy

The look holds
And holds

Anger only at the edges
Like finely-honed steel
How can  ever hope
For your forgiveness
The wind swirls a cloud of dust between them
They seem not to notice
have written this letter to the boy's parents
She pulls out a single page
Hands it down to her daughter
Hatsue's eyes move quickly over the words
Attraction is no crime, certainly among children
The dishonor lies in the concealment
From your families
Watches her daughter reading
And quietly
know that you know this
know you have suffered
Even if the hakujin could not
Silence
Hatsue's eyes cast down
She folds the page
There will be no further letters
No contact of any k
And stops
Because Hatsue is  the page in two
She looks up
Into her mother's shock
One more letter
will write it
You may read it, and send it for me
Her mother's anger fades
Into interest
deceived more than you deceived this sweet boy
And myself
It was never love
Never love
The mother's face changes
There is understanding, acceptance
Even pride
will work hard
To earn your forgiveness
sigh
sadness deep, beyond her years
can never hope for his
- Mother and daughter enter their crude quarters
They find Hatsue's sisters sitting on the wooden floor, watching
a team of young , working with tools and pieces of lumber
One is building shelves, two others, a chest of drawers
Their leader kneels tacking scraps of tin over the knotholes on the floor
One girl beams at her mother
These boys are buildings us a mansion
The leader grins and rises
Bows slightly to Fujiko
He is, of course
'm Kabuo Miyamoto, Mrs
Imada
The woman smiles
Bows slightly in return
We are in your debt, Miyamoto-san
How are your parents, your family
My father is sick with the camp food
The rest of us are fine
Don't speak of dept, please, we just want to help
And glances
To the eldest daughter
In the doorway
Hi, Hatsue, remember me
She looks back, without expression
There is much on her mind
His smile is handsome, easy
was a senior when you were a junior
But 've seen you around
She tosses her hair free of the parka
Gathers it in her hands
Saying only
Hello
Can't win a smile, but he doesn't seem to mind
Nice to see you
- Ishmael steps from the building onto the rear porch
He draws from his coat a black
Box of matches
The cigar goes into his mouth
With amazing dexterity
he slips a single match from the box, turns his face to the wall, and still palming the box,  a match on the buckle of his belt, bringing it smoothly to the cigar for a few critical puffs before the match dies
He turns toward
the fields
Stretching treeless, endless, seemingly to the horizon
Bathed in filtered moonlight, they become
- the shimmering Pacific
We are with Ishmael in an  landing craft, as his platoon enters Tarawa lagoon
Bobbing past two firing in waves at the beach
Ishmael and his platoon mates watch with adrenaline-fueled fear as amphibious tractors draw fire on the sand, one exploding in flame

Gasping, puking, shivering with cold and fright
They have no gear, no weapons
One of them is Ishmael
He looks back to

) Eric Bledsoe was bleeding to death
Thirty yards away
Bullets  everywhere,  up the sand
The young man twitching, pleading
(crying) Oh, shit, please , please help me you guys, come on, help me, fucking help me,
And flat against the seawall, three men watch
Not daring to look at each other

) knew nothing could save him
Hell, didn't have so much as a band-aid

For not giving up my life to try
- Ishmael and his companions have been joined by others
Sixty or so men mill in the shadow of the seawall
The beach is littered with dead marines and wounded, calling for help
As Ishmael glances up, a  leaps  the seawall, cigarette dangling from his mouth
You pussies are the kinda chickenshits deserve to have your balls chewed off real slow when this is over
Stands with his hands on his hips
The men below him properly mesmerized
Any man who won't follow me over this wall is a cornhole-fucker with a half-inch hard-on wh
The words   by the shell that   his spine, his shirt front as he  forward  upon the sand
No one looks
No one speaks
It never happened

) wanted to live
And  didn't know why
- Ishmael has a carbine now and a field machete
to reveal 300  all down the wall, a striking force assembled from the survivors of multiple landings
(
) Some colonel came down the beach
Any man who didn't go over the wall at 2100 would be court-martialed, disgraced and imprisoned
Every man lining up now, rifles at the ready
(
) The captain who followed said shot on sight
They seem more resigned, or is it stunned numb, than terrified
There is no interaction
Each man dealing with his own insides
And suddenly
squad leaders go   , the firing , and three hundred marines  into the teeth of it, mortar and machine- gun  lighting the sky from the row of battered palm trees, Ishmael , the man next to him goes , Ishmael instinctively, and a shot

For a long while
'  - on a dark blue suit
Clean shirt
Hanging on a hook against the green wall
the bars in the cell door's tiny window
All is dark out there, and silent
Here
the bare bulb glows
Its light throws shadows of castles and horses across the chessboard
Kabuo cross-legged on the floor, alone
His back erect
His eyes calm
Stare at the pieces
- Kabuo at 19 sits on the earth
By a shovel
By a lantern
This place is shielded by trees
across the ground to
his father
Slowly, reverently, placing objects into burlap sacks, beside a shallow hole in the earth
Wooden swords, hakama pants, a bokken, scrolls written with care
Dialogue plays in subtitled
Your great-grandfather was a samurai, a magnificent soldier
The father never looks at the son
Only at his work
He killed himself
On the battlefield
At Kumamoto
The boy knows this
Yet his entire being is focused on every word
He went to battle with a sword
Against rifles, mind you
Knowing what honor required
An elegant
Its curved blade gleaming in the lantern light
He was angry
To the point of being crazy, yes
But he knew what honor
Required
separate sack, just for this
Folded with respect
Honor can require loyalty
Revenge
Death
It goes into the ground
With the others
He seems nearly overcome now
By some emotion that sweeps through him
Prompting the boy to murmur
These are safe, father
The hakujin will never f
(quietly) it is the only scale
Meaning, be still
So the boy is still
Only scale
In which our worth
Is weighed
The man gazes into the hole
At his treasures
Every life ends
And if it ends dishonored
It is as if
And turns to his son
To complete the words
(in English) we have never lived
There is love
There is strength
There is no more to say
- Sheriff Moran sits in the witness box, blade-thin and fidgeting ever so slightly
Uncomfortable in the limelight
In his hands are four pieces of
Well, this one here comes off Miyamoto's boat
Matches all his others, worn equal and so on
But this one here
Holds it up for Hooks
So the jury can see
comes off third cleat from the stern, port side
And it's brand new
Unlike the rest
And the next one
From Carl Heine's boat
All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops
Not bowlined like Miyamoto's
And the last
Found on Carl's boat, too
Starboard side, second cleat from the stern
But it doesn't match Carl's lines
It matches Miyamoto's
perfect
Ah
Hooks nods
Significant
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat
With that last one
Would those cleats have lined up
You bet
And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat
And replaced it later with the new one
That's your inference
Pretty darn clear
see
Hooks begins to pace
Toward the jury
And when you visited defendant on his boat
The evening after Carl Heine's death
Did it seem pretty darn clear to him
- Kabuo kneeling at the battery well of his boat
He is sliding a new  into place
Beside its older companion
He bolts it down
Starts his engine
He is visibly tense
As he steps onto the deck, he sees
two figures at the pilings
Sheriff Moran makes a cutting motion across his throat, as Abel moves to grasp the mooring line
Cut your engine, we're coming aboard
Kabuo doesn't move
The tension has fled beneath the surface
His face now a mask
What for, Sheriff
We have a warrant
To search your boat
He holds it up
Abel looks uneasy, as if expecting anything
Well, what are you looking f
(calmly) murder weapon
We think you might be responsible for the death of Carl Heine
Kabuo blinks
As if hearing a foreign language
Words that do not compute
Sheriff, if somebody killed Carl, it sure as hell wasn't me
Moran steps from the dock  the boat, Abel awkwardly following
Then let's get this over with, so you can get to fishin'
Now, cut yor engine
And walks ahead into the cabin, shining his flashlight across everything
Kabuo follows, killing the engine
And in the sudden silence, Moran's beam finds
the still-open battery well
You always run with the well open
was checking the cables
Moran's light moves over the batteries
-6s, huh
And says no more
Runs his beam once more around the cabin
We'll come back, let's take a look at the stern
Off he goes
Kabuo's glance goes to the open well
Then follows, noticing Abel Martinson prowling around the bow
But in the stern, Moran is shining his light
Third cleat
Port side
See you replaced a mooring line, lately
This one's new
Naw,  had that around for a while
Sure you did
Help me with this hold cover, willya
So Kabuo slides the cover away
They peer in
There's nothin' to see
need to get out there fi
(
) Art
Looka this
He has the fishing
Three-and-a-half feet long
Steel hook at one end
Hands it to Moran
There's blood on it
Fish blood,  gaff fish with that
Moran carefully examines the object
You gaff with the hook end
Blood's on the butt
Where your hand goes
Sure
Blood gets all over your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman
Moran takes out a handkerchief
Holds the gaff with it
Gonna have this tested
Now you go home, okay
Wait til you hear from me
Kabuo's heart is racing
Sheriff,  can't afford not to fish toni
Look, no way 'm lettin' you out there
In a half hour you could be in Canada
Kabuo's face has gone dead
Which makes it seem somehow fierce, almost threatening
And the sheriff is watching that
'm sorry, son
But you're under arrest
- Moran still on the stand
The ropes are gone now
His hands interlock across his narrow thighs
(
) Now your testimony was interrupted yesterday, when that power line set fire to your mother-in-law's farmhouse
Art looks really irritated
(
) How is your mother-in-law
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking
(
) And her farmhouse
The damage was considerable
But she's insured
Thanks, again
See Nels now
Avuncular as hell
Bemused by Moran's annoyance
Well, just to put it back in our minds, could you repeat what you told us
About the type of batteries you found
One Carl's boat
Moran sighs
Tries to be patient
One -6 and one -8 in the well
And a dead -8 on the deck
Which you inferred was replaced by the -6, which must have been a spare
What else could it be
Even though a -6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in
(beat) Which makes it a peculiar choice
For a spare
You said that
That was your testimony
Everybody laughs
Including Nels
(chuckling) guess 'm a pretty smart feller, after all
And what were the type batteries you found on defendant's boat
(bland) -6s
Like  sa
No further questions
- sits in his expensive suit, a giant of a man whose towering frame ill fits the witness box
His eyes are small and blue, and carry the weight of superiority with practiced ease
(
) So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all
It was human yes
Type  positive
Carl Heine's type
Nels nodding
Seemingly unconcerned by this fact
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his
No, but as  say, the type is rare
Ten percent of Caucasian males
And the blood could not have belonged to defendant
Seeing that his type is  negative
That's obvious
You scraped the dried blood from the butt of the gaff
Where a fella's hand goes
And what did you see under your microscope, besides the  positive blood and the wood scrapings
And the witness stops
curious question
But Nels is waiting
With an expectant smile
Bits of blood and wood
What else would there be
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair
None
Well, if the blood got onto the gaff by crushing a man's skull
'm a hemotologist, sir,  was asked only t
(gently persistent) would that seem logical don't know
You don't
Nels lifts the gaff off the table
Looks at it
The coroner testified that Carl Heine had a cut
fresh cut
Probably one or two hours old
And grasps the butt end
Of the gaff
On the palm
Of his right hand
Walks, dragging one leg just slightly, toward the box
And holding the butt of the gaff toward him
With no bone or scalp or hair present
Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull
'm a hemotologist, not a detective
or from the cut on his hand
Which is more probable
Whitman won't be badgered
His smile carries only a trace of coldness
It is not my function
To weigh those probabilities
Nels looks him over
You're right
And turns his back
Walks away
that's the jury's job
- Hooks in pin-stripe serge today
Pommaded hair, glossy wing-tips
He is crisp
Now this regiment you were training, the 442nd, this was all Nisei boys
First Sergeant   wears his green dress uniform, splashed with decorations
Thick and powerful, no neck, razor cut
The eyes are alive
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat
It was my specialty, sir,  trained several thousand over the years
So
Wide cross-section of men to evaluate
And the day that the defendant volunteered for this
demonstration
Did you find him eager
More than eager
He was out to make a point
Hooks finds that interesting
Begins to pace
And what point
Was that
,  ,  - The squad of Nisei recruits, one hundred young Asian faces, surround Sgt
Maples
He paces before them, holding up a wooden staff, looking in their eyes
Anyone
And Kabup steps forward
Bows slightly
Then salutes
Maples stares
Hard
You don't salute me, you don't call me 'sir', soldier, 'm an enlisted man
Kabuo stares back
Blank
And nobody bows in this man's Army, you're in America, son
Not Japan
'm sorry, sir, force of habit
No more 'sir'
That's the last of that
Tosses Kabuo a wooden staff and a helmet
little hard
As Kabuo slips the helmet on
The exercise is avoiding thrusts
Now, first y
(quietly) Ready, sergeant
Cut off in mid-word, Maples glares back
Are you sharply, but Kabuo moves just enough to slip the blow by no more than an inch
Their eyes lock
Suddenly, Maples unleashes
a  series of  at blinding , and Kabuo
them all effortlessly, scarcely seeming to move
As a man might toy with a child
Maples studies the face for any trace of mockery
And sees nothing at all
out, only to have Kabuo
Maples' staff from his grasp, with a move so quick as to be nearly invisible
Maples clearly  by the display
(quietly) Excuse me
He bends, picks up Maples' staff, hands it to him
And bows
Slightly
The sergeant is hot
He looks into the faces of this Nisei regiment, searching for a single smirk
There is none
Are you ready for some simulated combat, soldier
For combat
Sergeant
And Maples  with surprising speed, to be  off his feet in a , lying  on the earth, his head  to the ground by the tip of Kabuo's staff
hush
Kabuo withdraws his staff
Retrieves Maples'
(just above a whisper) Your weapon, sergeant
And bows
- Maples smiling easily
Like a guy telling the story in a bar
Well, what then, sergeant
What else
had the boy teach me kendo
Including
the importance of the bow
Everyone laughs
Maples the loudest
Hooks smiles like a regular Joe
And your evaluation of the defendant
Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff
So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle
Oh, in a heartbeat
And the smiles are gone
All around
Able and willing
Like few men 've ever seen
- Hooks sits against the prosecution table
His demeanor gentle, respectful
His voice soft
So the plan was for your husband to fish through the prime season
Then, in November, sell the boat
And you would move onto the farm
In the box, the widow sits in lovely dignity
Blonde and alabaster and modest, in her black dress of mourning
That was his plan, yes
In the press row, the boys are attentive
An angle they know they can sell
Ishmael among them, watching with neutral eyes
(
) Whatever she said, she was Hooks' star witness
The jury, especially the men, would not betray this fine lady with a not guilty verdict
How could they face her
Hooks walks slowly toward her
As if she were a precious object, deserving of reverence
Can you think back for me to the morning of September 8
The day after your husband purchased the farm
One week before his death
Can you recall that morning
can
- bright bathroom, filled with , filtering the sunlight toward the opaque shower door,  the sound of rushing water
And of breathing
it to
Susan Marie and her husband
Her arms are wound about his neck
Her legs wrapped around his body, feet locked behind the small of his back
Carl holds her high with his strong hands, so he can lick her breasts to the rhythm of the slow, slow thrusts
Her wet blonde hair is pasted across her face, and her eyes are closed
The intensity holds us
- on a paint brush
It rests across the lid of a can of wood stain
See now
Susan Marie kneeling by the table she is refinishing
But her hands, her body, are motionless
Her eyes stare out the window
across the yard
Her towering husband walks beside a smaller man
Carl is doing the talking
Kabuo's face is stone
- Susan Marie sits quietly in a rocker, nursing her baby
Her hands tenderly stroke the feeding infant
But her eyes are attentive
Concerned
(
) What could tell him
There's my mother to think about
You know what she'd say
Susan Marie knows
What Etta would say
(
) said 'd think it over, talk with you
Did he go away angry
See Carl now, pacing his own parlor like a caged bear
Agitated in a way we could not have expected
He kept talkin' about those seven acres belonged to his father, and how honorable and decent his father was
His meaning was pretty clear
And  didn't much like it
You had a scrap
Nursing her baby
Calm, direct
couldn't
talk to him
Look, Kabuo's a Jap
And  don't hate Japs, but  don't like 'em neither
It's hard to explain if you weren't in the war, you know
He's not a Jap
You don't mean that
You and he were friends
And Carl turns
Looks at her
full beat
We were kids
He looks helpless
Frustrated
He doesn't want his anger to spill onto her
He leaves the room
Without a word
on her

Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h

(
) Well, he didn't say 'no', did he
Didn't say no hope existed
Not in those words
(
) So the defendant was encouraged to hope
Or could have been
She thinks about this
guess so
Nels is nodding
Nodding
guess you'd have to guess
Not having been there with them
Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate
Carl never lied
Of course not
But it was emotional
friend's plea set against his mother's attitude
And then
As if it had just occurred to him
Those 'dirty looks'
Defendant ever aim one of those at you
He had no reason to
Carl ever say he got one
can't speak for him
You can speak for what he said Just like you did for Mr
Hooks

Heine

That's all he said
She arches her throat
And we can't ask him anymore
' ,   - Ishmael driving an aged DeSoto through the blanketed strawberry fields of Center Valley
(
) My father had bought the DeSoto fifteen years before
Driving it reminded me of him
Which considered a neutral fact
He turns the wheel, using a cherry wood knob, specially mounted for his convenience
(
) Actually, it was pleasant
Following the curve, fields are pure white to the horizon
(
) Snow made all the fields into one
The notion that one man might kill another for a small patch, made no sense
Up ahead, a Willys station wagon has run into a ditch
middle aged Japanese man is working at a rear wheel with a shovel
(
) But  knew such things occurred
Having been to war and all
The man is Hisao Imada, and we can now see his eldest daughter working with a shovel behind the car
Ishmael pulls up behind them
And gets out
He crunches over to where Hisao works
May  give you folks a lift
Hatsue has come around the car now, pulling her snowflaked hair from her eyes
(
) didn't look at her
thought that would be best
Her eyes on Ishmael's profile, Hatsue goes to her father's side
Murmurs to him in Japanese
WHen he answers, she turns to face Ishmael
My father is grateful for your kindness
But he will free his car, shortly
Ishmael smiles softly
This car isn't going anywhere
He goes to Hatsue, reaching gently for her shovel
Okay, 'll help
,    - Ishmael drives with Hisao beside him
know it's caused you trouble
But don't you think the snow is beautiful, coming down
His eyes flick to Hatsue in the rearview mirror
She stares out the side window, concentrating on the world
Two strands of wet hair pasted against her cheek
Yes, very beautiful
Suddenly, her eyes  to meet Ishmael's in the mirror
His dart away
Hers hold
This trial is unfair
You should write about that in your newspaper
He keeps driving
And he keeps his eyes on the road
(calmly) What should  say
Just that
This trial is wrong they are calling a good man a killer
It is only about prejudice, and that is unfair
He thinks
As he drives
Hisao Imada silent beside him
We all expect the world to be fair
As if we have some right t
don't mean everyone
Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them
Or run a newspaper
And his eyes come up
Meet hers in the mirror
Maybe should write a column
What do you think
She studies his face
What do you think
No smile
On either side
think people
Should be fair
His eyes on the road now
The farmhouse seen through the drifting screen of white
Will you write that
Her voice is soft
The difference is palpable
might just
His voice is kindness and friendship

Ishmael's hand in his pocket
Trudging toward it
- Ishmael being led into a cramped room, stacked floor to ceiling with wooden crates, file cabinets, duffel bags
Our host is , a young Coast Guard radioman nearly six foot six, with a huge Adam's apple, and kinky black hair
He gestures around the room at all the records
Voila
You have the night watch
On the radio
Since September
Last guys got transferred
Ishmael looks around
There is a lot of stuff
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em
Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet
Nobody ever looks
Just take up space
Ishmael nods
Guess so
All kinds of radio transmissions
Fisherman in trouble, and such
Innocent question
Random example
All kinds
Make yourself at home
And leaves
Ishmael looks at the task before him
Then, out the window
Dark now
His reflection stares back
As troubled as he is
'  - Ishmael at 24, carrying milk and crackers down the aisle of a grocery store, the empty sleeve of his mackinaw pinned up at the elbow
He turns the corner to see
three people in line at the register
The second is Hatsue
An infant carried at her shoulder
(
) 'd been back two months
It was the first time 'd seen her
He joins the line
The  glances his way, then looks awkwardly down
This makes the others turn
And Hatsue's eyes
Meet his
Hello
The voice, the face, are cool and formal
There is no anger, no unkindness
Only the absence of warmth
Ishmael nods
His face hard, stricken
His heart pounds in his throat
(
) couldn't say anything
just stood there, hating her
'm sorry about your arm
Kabuo and Are very sor
The Japs did it
No one knows where to look
Down, away, anything
But Hatsue never blinks
They shot it off
At Tarawa
She holds her ground, her eyes soften, somehow
Somewhere between compassion and pity
Her slender fingers stroke the baby at her shoulder
'm sorry, 'm sorry  said that
All the feeling comes to his eyes
Everything he will never tell her
murmur
'm sorry about everything
All of it
He drops his milk and crackers on the counter
And walks away
- Ishmael sits alone
Beyond the glass, a  sweeps the sea, the snow-covered shore
But Ishmael stares at a folder
Open in his lap
(
) September 16
At 1:42
, the dead of night
The
West Corona, a Greek-owned freighter, was lost
In heavy fog
His finger
Traces a line of the report
(
) They radioed to the lighthouse
They would have to dogleg, bisecting Ship Channel Bank
And Seaman Philip Milholland wrote that down
In his report
Ishmael closes his eyes
(
) Carl Heine drowned
In Ship Channel Bank
And his watch stopped
At 1:47
He looks out through the glass
As if he could watch it happen
(
) huge freighter plowing through
Throwing a wake big enough to fling any man overboard
And Ishmael removes the page from the file
Slowly, he folds it into quarters
Slides it into his coat pocket
(calls out) Seaman
And closes the file
Slips it back into the cabinet
Levant appears, vaguely irritated by the summons
So Ishmael smiles
Sorry, nothing important
How long you have this detail
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16
Ishmael's face
Just to clarify
You mean, early morning the 16th
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th
We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland
Oh
Ishmael nods
They got transferred that day
Out to Cape Flattery
(
) Some seaman's loast report
Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever
No one knows
Ishmael rises, stiffly
Starts to pull on his coat
You get what you come for
And Ishmael looks at the youngster
little oddly
Admits
Guess 'm not completely sure
What that was
'  - Ishmael at 24, crouched among trees
Above a sunlit stretch of beach
(
) left the grocery, and wrote a letter
apologizes from my heart
should never have said that word to her
never would again
on his face
Eyes gazing down
At something
(
) It sat in my desk for two weeks
Before  threw it away
He sighs
Rises slowly
(
) knew her car
And sometimes when 'd see it, 'd
drive that way
At a distance
See Hatsue down on the beach
Alone, raking for steamer clams
Her baby beside her on a blanket, beneath an umbrella
Ishmael walks down to the sand
Crosses to where she works
And squats down
At a respectful distance
Can  talk to you
She must have seen who was coming
Because the words do not startle her
Or slow her work
'm married, Ishmael
It isn't right for us to be alone
People will t
There's no one here, and 've got to talk to you
Her back is to him
She is motionless
Don't you owe me that
And she turns
Her eyes go first to her sleeping child
Then she walks over, and sinks to the sand
Just before him
Near enough to touch
She looks in his eyes
And waits
'm like a dying person
The words just came out
His eyes move over her face
His aching for her is naked, beyond his ability to cope
don't sleep
tell myself this can't go on, but it goes on anyway
He seems at the edge of insanity
Or tears
did a terrible thing, Ishmael
knew what you felt
And what didn't
Sadness in her voice
But strength as well
And  never found the courage to tell you
His eyes swim with tears
He chokes them back, he has to
You'll think this is crazy, but all want is to hold you
Just once
And smell your hair
She absorbs this
No sign of repulsion or anger
Her eyes seem wise
And very sad
You have to hear this,  can never touch you, Ishmael
Not once, not ever
There's no half- way
As much as  know it hurts you, you have to let this go
Look, want to forget you,  do
think if you hold me, just this once,  can walk away and never speak to you again
She just keeps looking at him
There is a bravery to her steady gaze
Her calm resolve
Please
As one human being to another, just because 'm miserable and don't know where to turn need to be in your arms
If it's just for thirty seconds
His pleading look holds her for a moment
In the silence
hurt for you
Whether you'll ever believe that or not
Feeling behind her eyes
First time she lets it show
feel sick sometimes, with the guilt of what 've done to you
And  can't make it right
She rises slowly
Brushes the sand from her skirt
To hold you would be wrong and deceitful
You're going to have to live without holding me, that is the truth of the way things are
She takes one step back
Things end
They do
Get on with your life
And turns away
She gathers her baby in her arms
Takes her blanket, her umbrella, her rake and her pail
He watches, never moving, as she gathers her things
Gathers them as if he wasn't there
And with her back turned
Get on with your life
She walks slowly away
Her baby cries

She is not yet 60 code of fairness and self-reliance is written on the fine-boned features
(
) drove from the lighthouse to my mother's place
brought her some groceries
Beyond the window, snow falls more heavily than ever
Silent
Spellbinding
Your father thought that heavy snow was God's kindness
Despite the hardship, it brought us beauty
Ishmael at the rustic table
Watching her back
and reminded us
Of our place in things
Softer
Not bitter, but regretful that
You don't believe in God anymore
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma
We just don't pretend we know
She begins ladling the soup into big porcelain bowls
We don't know God, we feel Him
You felt Him as a child
remember
And turns
Looks at him
That's a long time ago
What a child feels
that's different
She studies him silently for a moment
Then brings the bowls to the table
Spend the night, will you
Don't go back out into all that snow
Sets them down
(
) felt Milholland's report in my pocket
And wondered why  wasn't telling her
Telling someone
What 'd found
You've been busy with that trial, suppose
Such a travesty
She takes her seat
As he watches her
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese
Seattle boys think he's guilty
They say the evidence is rock solid
She begins to eat
Eyes on her bowl
They're not his neighbor, like you are
He is a husband, a father, he risked his life for their country
The same as you
Those aren't the facts that matter
She looks up
Straight to his eyes
Well, folks are pretty cold
And folks who believe in nothing else
they're cold, too
No mistaking her meaning
He swallows
Uneasy as always, in the path of her disapproval
've tried to understand your unhappiness, all these years
Having gone to war, losing your arm
The directness of her gaze
He can't turn from that
But other boys came back
And pushed on
They found girls, and married, had babies
He doesn't flinch
His voice too quiet with
Someday 'll get lucky, too
Too quiet to conceal the hurt
She thinks it is hurt she has caused
It changes her tone to a plea
Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took him years to get over it
Nightmares, tears, b
but he found you
Their eyes locked
It isn't the war, Ishmael
All those years growing up
You never had a real girl of your own
And now he looks down
He sees that his fist is tight around the handle of his spoon
And  know you have it in you to love
know that much wish  knew more
His fingers open, and the spoon clatters softly on the wood
'll stay tonight
Thanks for asking
- Ishmael wanders through a silent room
bed, a dresser
Work table and lamp
room denuded of all decoration, all possessions, all sign of life
(
) came back from the war to this room
stayed a few months
Until my father passed
'  - Ishmael at 24, the left sleeve of his dark suit of mourning pinned at the elbow
The diggers are filling a grave in distance
Mourners mingle, some casting glances back at Ishmael
Keeping their distance out of awkwardness rationalized as respect
One man comes to him
is aging and frail
But his voice is clear
The Japanese people of the island are saddened by this loss
Your father was a man of great fairness and compassion for others
He stands at a respectful distance
Ishmael clears his throat
He nods, thank you
No words to say
So the small man adds
friend to us
And to all people
Silence
They are a tableau of stone
Finally
Well
And no more
The man takes a step back
We know you will follow in his footsteps
And honor his legacy
Which changes Ishmael's face
To something harder
(
) thought it then
And often since
balance, he's said
Finding the facts
That folks needed to know
- Ishmael stands at an open closet
Cardboard boxes have been set aside
One has been searched for treasure
The page is in his hand
Only slightly discolored by age
(
) Dear Ishmael
These things are very difficult to say
can't think of anything more painful than writing this letter
He closes his eyes
(a murmur) Think of reading it
(
) don't love you, Ishmael
There is no more honest way to say it
He carries the letter to the twin bed
Where he slept alone
Thinking of her
(
) Whenever we were together,  knew it
loved you and  didn't love you at the same moment
He sinks slowly
As if beneath the letter's weight
(
) The last time
At the cedar tree
knew we could never be right together
And that soon  would have to tell you
His eyes are dry
The letter has used up his tears long ago
(
) This is the last time  will write to you
am not yours anymore
He sets the letter on the bed beside him
(
) wish you the very best
Your heart is large and you are gentle and kind
know you will do great things in the world
He reaches now to his inside coat pocket
Withdrawing
(
) must say good-bye to you now
Our lives will move on
The best we can
a page
Folded in quarters
Sets it near the letter
(
) Milholland's report was like her letter
Something no one else
Would ever read
He stares at them
Side by side
(
) Thing about having only one hand
It's hard to tear pages up
And wasn't carrying a match
He lies back
Across the bed
(
) So  thought of my father
The man who would have taken this report to Judge Fielding
Tears stand in his eyes
(
) But every reporter
Chooses his own balance
FInds the facts that matter
Shuts the eyes
Against them
Against everything
(
) After all, the freighter was only a theory
It proved nothing at all
There were other facts
That mattered
We  on his face
The tightness of the muscles
(
) Tomorrow  would write a column
About prejudice
And she would be grateful
For my large
and gentle
heart
The eyes open, they are blank
Staring
(
) Her husband would be judged
And she would be alone
at the future
(
) Alone
The past looks different
- Hatsue Miyamoto in the witness box
Graceful, erect, her porcelain beauty accessible, eager to cooperate
Humble
Hopeful
Is the word  would use
And Nels seems slightly surprised
But Carl didn't say yes
He didn't say no
That was Kabuo's point
Given how Carl's mother felt, Carl was still willing to consider selling to us
It was a good sign
Nels considers that
Well, in the week that followed, the week before Carl's death
did your husband pursue him
No
Kabuo did not wish to beg, he respected Carl's right to reflect
He was sure Carl would do the honorable thing
(right back) And did he
She nods
Only once
Her eyes bright
The night of the 15th, Kabuo helped Carl at sea
With his dead battery
Nels raises his eyebrows
To give the point its weight
Right there, on the boat, they agreed
$8400 for the seven acres, $800 down
They shook on it
Kabuo was so excited when he came home
Nels lets that sit
And sit
And when did you first learn
That Carl had drowned
The slightest pause
As if hesitant to confess
One o'clock, that afternoon, from a clerk at Petersen's
(turning to Hooks) Your witness
And Alvin Hooks rises
Perches on the edge of the prosecutor's table
And looks at the witness with fairness and suspicion
Your husband came home agitated, after his encounter with the deceased
No impatience across her perfect features
Only earnestness will do
said 'excited'
Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed
You were
overjoyed yourself, to hear the news
Happy for him
And relieved
So, then, you
and your husband
must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news
Yes
(calm, respectful) No
Really
Didn't call your mother, your sisters, about starting a new life
Your husband never tells his brothers that the family honor is vindicated
Hatsue shifts in her chair
Smooths her skirt
We hear how Carl
passed away
Only a few hours later
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock
Closer to eight
So, five hours
Plenty of time for a call
He was 'excited', you say
In the sense of being 'overjoyed'
She nods, he was
We are
cautious people
You would say conservative
There would be time for celebrating with others when a paper was signed
Hooks pouts
He allows himself that
You thought the deceased might
break his promise
Of course not
We're just not quick to run and boast
In case something went wrong
And then, something did
Carl Heine was found dead
With his head crushed
She weathers that last part
As if taking no notice
Yes, and then, what was there to call about
Everything was up in the air
Up in the air
Was that your reaction
And he rises
Tastefully indignant
would suggest that more happened than a land sale evaporating man died , Mrs
Miyamoto
husband and father of small children had his skull bashed in
(quiet dignity) If you mean to imply that we were callous about Carl's death, that is wrong and insulting
see
Well, did you come forward to tell Sheriff Moran what you knew
The encounter in the fog, the
dead battery, was it
Silence
We discussed that
And decided not to
Why not
She looks at him with the directness we've seen before
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about
Her eyes cut to Nels
He smiles, to blunt the harm she's done by looking to him for support
Her gaze goes down now
And then
back up
Straight to Hooks
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr
Hooks
Even though they should be
They're about what people believe is true
So you hid the truth
Deliberately
We were afraid
Silence seemed better
To come forward seemed like a mistake
Well, it seems to me
(gently) Objection
Mr
Hooks can give his view in his summation
Doesn't it seem to you , Mrs
Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful
Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation
It seems human
To me
Oh
Hooks raises his brows
suppose that you mean this excuses concealing the truth
Then why ahouls any of us believe you now
And in the silence
Question withdrawn, you may step down
You're implying th
said
No further questions
Anger flashes across her eyes
Her face colors
She draws a breath
That's enough, Mrs
Miyamoto, not another word
Step down, please
She looks to Nels in her desperation and regret for making things worse
he chuckles and waves
It's quite all right
She sits for a frozen moment
And as she rises
The boys in the reporter's row are scribbling furiously
All but one
- folds his blunt, thick hands across his belly
Nearly 50, sporting a walrus moustache and the watery, dull eyes of an alcoholic, he is a man ready to make the most of his fifteen minutes of fame
(
) Thirty years fishing alone
Ever had an occasion to board another man's boat except in an emergency
Maybe to socialize or some such
(ready for this) Never
Only boarded some fella's boat five, six times in thirty- one years
Dead engine, broken hip, only in need
(
) Now, Mister Gi
Unwritten rule of the sea
We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves
Ask anybody
Nels is wandering over to the jury box
Now if you wanted to kill a man
Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff
It's a joke
Maneuver up to Carl's boat
Tie your lines fast
Come aboard
All against Carl's will
It's the stupidest suggestion ever heard of
'm sorry about that
It wasn't mine in the first place
Gentle laughter
Even some on the jury
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense
Couldn't get on the boat
'd just shoot the feller
Then tie up, throw him inta th' drink
And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding
More laughter
Hooks at his table
Simply smiles
Now the sheriff believed that the -6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare
Even though it was too large f
No sense to have any at all
, even the right size
It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car
Nobody does
Nobody
No way
Boat has two batteries
Lose one you run off the other til morning
Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work
So how would he signal for help
Compressed air horn, most likely
Hope to God some man hears you in that fog
All right, what if the defendant heard So Carl let him aboard, to help
And then the fishing gaff
Gillanders grins
Wide
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him
Well, what if
Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in advance That Carl loses two batteries
Must happen once ever' 20 years or so
Another chuckle or two from the gallery
Thank you, Mr
Gillanders
Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here
Specially for Mr
Hooks
And looks at the prosecutor
Who rises, easily
most polite fuck-you smile
Hooks strolls now
Slow and steady
Straight to the witness box
Rests his hands on the rail
Leans in
What if the defendant follows Carl
And pretends his own batteries are dead
Would Carl tie up and help
And the smile on Gillander's face
Stops
Cold
Is the word you're groping for
'yes', perha
(
) Alvin
Rephrase
Do you agree that he might tie up to the defendant's bo
So why's the -6 in Carl's well
Who's to say
Maybe it was just a spare, after all
Or maybe the defendant left it, as a potential alibi
In case somebody saw him in Ship Channel Bank
(beat) In case we put two and two together, knowing of the hostility
Between the families
Gillanders
Actually thinking about that
My question is
Could Carl have tied up to help the defendant
beat
cleared throat
It coulda happened
And if  start to say it's doubtful, you'd probl'y say 'no further questions', right
Once more, laughter
Enough to bring the gavel
Right about that
And right that it 'coulda happened'
Turns his back, walks away
Thanks for your help
Hope the witness box wasn't too warm for your comfort
All eyes follow the prosecutor, as he sits
Except for the defendant
His stare forward
Recalling
'  - Kabuo seated on the concrete floor of his cell, leaning back against the wall
Leaving the cot
For his guest
But the toughest scenario
Is the one Hooks will never raise
Kabuo watching
Quiet
Takes a breath
And what's that
That you came upon Carl by accident
Like you said
Gave him the battery
Like you said
Asked him about the seven acres
Like you said
The hardest
Straightest
Look
Only
He said no
Silence
And something
happened
That you'd never planned
Because you're not a cold-blooded killer
Nobody flinches
Nobody blinks
'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh
Like a soldier
Like a samurai
You won't hear that from Hooks
Because the charge is first -degree murder, which requires premeditation
He can't change the charge
Do you understand
So if the jury thinks you did kill
but only in the heat of anger
They have to acquit
Do you
And you couldn't
Be
Re-tried
Kabuo's face is stone
warrior's mask
You want me to say that
want you
To tell the truth
There is no kindly smile tonight
No candy bars
You think that is the truth
told your wife
Trials aren't always so much about actual truth
As about what folks believe is true
That's sad
And it's real
And what do you believe
Nels sighs
Cocks his head just to one side
question first
Why do you want to know
(straight back) Because you're my friend
The old man thinks about that
Studies his client
believe you are a good man
Who belongs with his family
And then the feeling comes
To the watery eyes
And  believe
You didn't do it
- Fog
The sound of water
Lapping at the hull of a boat
The mist drfits, revealing
Eyes
They are blue
The heavy brows above them dark gold, matted and damp
(
) My batteries are drawed down, both of 'em
ALternator belts were loose
to see him
With his keroses lantern and his air horn
(
) No sweat
We'll pull one a mine, get ya started
to see him now, leaning on his gaff
Squinting up
At the top of Carl's mast
We follow his gaze to see
(
) You lashed up a lantern
'Gainst a fog like this
See it now
as the helpless boat bobs in the night
(
) Lantern and a air horn
That's all  got, without my juice
'  - on a battery well
One battery sits in place, one spot is empty
And
The butt end of a fishing gaff  against the metal flange
Again
Again
And as the next blow is , the huge hand
slips, and the soft metal  Carl's flesh across his palm
He stops
Then  away, twice more
We   to see
two batteries lie above the well
Carl sucks the blood from his cut
Then lifts Kabuo's -6 into place
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge
Keep it tonight
We'll catch fish
'll see ya back on the docks
Kabuo takes his gaff
Heedless of Carl's blood on the butt end
Carl looks up, still crouching above his well
(quietly) Hold on
You know as well as do, we got somethin' to talk about
No response from Kabuo
He stands above the larger man
Silent, neutral
Waiting
Seven acres
'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em
Just curious, is all
What are you sellin' 'em for
Why don't we start there
Which makes the big man smile
Just a little
Did  say  was selling
But if  was, 'd have to figure you want 'em real bad
Oughta charge a sall fortune, maybe
slight shrug
Of giant shoulders
Then again
Maybe you'd want your battery back
Kabuo doesn't grin back
His face shows nothing at all
The battery's in, that's done with
Besides, you'd do the same for m
might do the same
have to warn you 'bout that, chief
'm not screwed together like  used to be
Kabuo's face remains impassive
Patient
And the big man squints up into it
Holding a handkerchief to his injured hand
Hell, 'm sorry, okay
About the whole damn mess
If 'd a been around, my mother wouldn't a pulled it off that way
He is sorry
And with that, Kabuo's face eases
Becomes like Carl's own
(grins) was out there at sea
Fightin' you Jap sons-a-bitches
(no grin) 'm an American
Did  call you a Nazi, you big Nazi bastard
(softly) Not that  recall
killed men who looked just like you, pig-fed German bastards
And their blood don't wash off so easy
Still no smile
Carl staring up
So don't talk to me about Japs, you big Nazi son of a bitch
Carl laughs
And Kabuo chuckles, right along with him
Having kept his poker face the longer
am a bastard
'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch
And  still got your bamboo fishing rod
Oh, yeh
Hid it from my mom
Caught a mess a sea runs
Damn thing's still in my closet
(very softly) You can have it
The hell with it
The look between them now
Is very wonderful
In the subtlety of its connection
$1200 an acre, that's what  paid Ole, won't take a dime less
You got no choice on that
Didn't say  was buyin' did
What you want down
Just bein' curious, is all
The handkerchief comes away from Carl's palm
And rising, his hand extends toward the smaller man
thousand down
We'll sign papers t'morrow
The hands grip
And they hold
And the length of this clasp, and the straightness of their gaze, and the silence of the moment
Wash years away
Eight hundred
And it's a deal
- on eyes
They are Asian
Unblinking
(
) For the life of me, sir,  cannot imagine why you kept this story from the sheriff
to see Kabuo in the witness box
Ramrod straight
Face composed
As my wife testified, we were considering it
Actually, she said you had decided
Decided not not come forward
(quietly) was thinking about it
Every minute
Except even when Sheriff Moran arrested you
You said nothing about seeing Carl
Turns to the jury
Openly bewildered
At that point, you were already under suspicion
The battery story explained things
If the story was true
and not simply something you thought up later
Turns back
To the defendant
Why
Didn't you
Tell it
No reaction from the defendant
Nothing anyone can see
Sheriff said right off,  was under suspicion
didn't have a lawyer
But even after you had an attorney
You still claimed to know nothing Claimed not to have seen Carl
Am  correct
beat
Yes
Initially
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir
You'd been arrested, you had a lawyer, and you still claimed ignorance
Silence
should have told everything right away
know that now, and  regret it
Should have told 'everything'
Meaning, you should have told the truth We can just discern the anger
At the edge of Kabuo's steady gaze
Silence
Nothing to say
(quietly) didn't know that was a question
It sounded like a speech
And Hooks smiles
Loving it
Walks toward the witness, stalking him
My apologies
Do you regret not telling the truth
have told the truth
You mean, this morning
The new story, the battery story
That one is the truth
That's a question, sir
(even quieter) Yes
And  told it long before this morning
see
Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found
Before your arrest
slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news
We talked for a few hours
left at six and went straight to my boat
Didn't go anywhere else
No errands, no purchases
Just straight to the boat
That's the truth
Yes
Hooks leans over the box
Ever so slightly invading Kabuo's space
Well, the sheriff found two batteries in your well
If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible
had a spare battery in my shed
brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up
Ah
see
Conveniently, in your shed
Only you didn't mention that a moment ago
Why does this battery story change every time a new question is raised
Kabuo looks at him, evenly
You asked if  went straight to the boat
did
With the battery
Hooks steps back
Looks the witness over
You're a hard man to trust, sir
You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f
(
) Objection
You know better than that, Mr
Hooks
Either ask questions that count for something, or sit down and be done with it
Silence
The judge staring hard
Hooks never flinching
Shame on you
Hooks turns his eyes to Kabuo
Stares him down, so the jury can watch Kabuo's implacable stare in return
And softly
apologize to the court, for letting my feelings get the better of me
Turns away
No other questions
We'll go to summation
As he returns to his table
As Kabuo steps down from the box
We
reporters' row
The boys are writing as fast as their hands can move
Only Ishmael is not writing at all
He stares at the pad resting on hsi right knee
We  to see
One word circled
The word 'lantern'
- Alvin Hooks stalks the jury box now
Prowls before them along the rail
As their eyes follow
believing that Etta Heine's son would never sell him the land
Land that in his mind, filtered through ancient rules of behavior handed down from his ancestors' culture, belonged to his family by right
Stops
To make sure they understand
His only choice to get the land would be to eliminate Carl Heine
So that Ole Jurgensen would need a new buyer
Pacing again, hand trailing along the rail
In his mind
Seen through codes of revenge difficult for us to fathom, this was also the only way to avenge what he felt to be the grievous dishonor brought to his father, his family
Raises his finger
This must be heard
to a thousand years of ancestry, in a foreign land we still find an enigma
Despite our recent bitter experience with its ways
And stops once more
Places his hands on the rail
Thus believing cold-blooded murder to be justified he trailed Carl Heine
could hear his engine in the fog
and sounded his own horn, claiming distress
Straightens up
Shakes his head, ever so slightly
As Carl pulled alongside: 'Please, Carl,' the defendant must have said
' am sorry for what has come between us, but adrift here in the fog, plead for your help
' Imagine
Imagine that
And so this good man tied his boat fast, while his enemy leaps aboard, striking the treacherous blow he was trained to strike by his father's hand
Counting off the facts
One finger at a time
The feud over these seven acres had festered for eight years He argued with Carl about buying the land one week before Carl was killed
Carl's skull was crushed, and his blood is on a murder weapon with which the defendant is a deadly expert Spreads his arms
Wide
And after a series of lies The defendant at last admits he was there Alone on the boat
In the fog
Carl Heine's blood on his fishing gaff
hush
murmur
My lord
My lord
Looking into the eyes now
Of each man
Each woman
Look clearly at the defendant
See the truth self-evident in him
And in the facts of this case
And turns
So that they will follow his eyes to Kabuo's stone- hard gaze
Look into his eyes, ladies and gentlemen, consider his face
And ask yourself what your duty is as citizens of this community
- the jury, slowly, as they hear
(
) not a single witness has testified to anything that could suggest pre- meditated murder
Not in the days before Carl Heine's death
or at any time
has anyone described a murderous rage toward the deceased
Nels stands very still
Hands resting on the rail
As calm and quiet as his adversary had been dramatic
Etta Heine had cheated his family
He had asked his childhood friend Carl to sell him the land
And Carl was considering it
Leans forward
Just a little
There is no evidence of anger at Carl, much less rage , much less murderous rage
No reason for premeditation and no evidence of it
Anywhere
He picks out a housewife
The youngest
Smiles sadly, wisely
As her grandfather might
And yet the state is required to prove these things
Beyond reasonable
Doubt
His eyes widen
Can you seriously think there is no reasonable doubt
Why is Kabuo's -6 battery in Carl's well, if Carl was helping him Why
Why isn't the blood on the gaff more consistent with Carl's hand wound than a skull fracture
Given the absence of bone or brain tissue
And now
he begins to pace, limping slightly, eyes down
What Mr
Hooks asks you to believe is that no proof is needed
Against a man who bombed Pearl Harbor
Slow
Eyes on his feet
Look at his face, the prosecutor said
Presuming that you will see an enemy there
Treacherous by nature, by a thousand years of something or other
He stops
Looks at them
An argument  find as despicable as it is dishonest and twisted and insulting to us all
Mr
Miyamoto is a much -decorated hero of the United States Army
For God's sake
The feeling wells in te old man
It bleeds through the very quietness of his voice
If someone said you should convict Carl Heine
Or his lovely widow
Of murder
Without proof
Because their ancestry is the same as Hitler's
You would spit in his eye
Yes, you would
And every decent American
Would applaud you
He leans his elbows on their rail
As if confiding to them across their backyard fence
Now Kabuo Miyamoto did one thing wrong
He was afraid to trust us, at first
Afraid that he would be crucified by prejudice
As Mr
Hooks is urging you to do
Silence
Well, we sent him
And his wife
And thousands of Americans to concentration camps
They lost homes, belongings, everything
We did that, folks
Can we now be unforgiving about his uncertainty
His mistrust
Looking in their eyes
As if waiting for an answer
They shift their weight, fidget beneath his gaze
You may think this is a small trial
In a small place
Well, it isn't
He straightens his spine
Winces slightly, with the pain of it
Every once in awhile
Somewhere in the world
Humanity goes on trial
And integrity
And decency
Every once in awhile, common folks get called on to give the report card for the human race
The eyes are watering
But the voice gains strength
Now here in America
We relish those chances
Give us that one, we say
That's why we built this country in the first place
One step back
Just above a whisper
Be Americans
Make your children proud
- on handcuffs  into place
Sheriff Moran checks their snugness about Kabuo's wrists, as the crowd mills through the courtroom in the wake of adjournment
Grasping Kabuo's arm, Moran begins leading him toward a small doorway just at the rear of the witness box
But
someone is there
In the doorway
And Moran's grip tightens as they approach
'm awful sorry, Ma'am, but you know  c
What are you afraid of, Sheriff
The edge on that, the ballsy undertone, throws him a little
Am  going to slip him a weapon for a mad escape
Perhaps a kendo staff hidden in my dress
There's rules
Well, please break them, then
won't keep you a moment
And she reaches past him
To take her husband's hands
She looks in his eyes, as if they are alone
love you
And tomorrow, when make our bed
'm setting out your pillow
Tears just flood her eyes
Sudden, unbidden
She holds tight to her smile
And to his hands
(whispers) You better be there
He smiles
lovely, easy, cowboy-American smile
Only if you ask me nice
from the gallery
One man watches
Watches as a woman brings manicled hands to her lips
And walks quickly away
toward us
Straight toward us, in fact
And when she stands before us, her hands mangle her purse
The eyes are hollow, flint- edged
Did you write that column
did
But the jury won't s
It's not for the
They only get to convict him
She arches her throat
As if facing a firing squad
It's the judge who decides
If he'll hang
He reaches
His fingertips find her shoulder
She does not resist his touch
(gently) None of that is gonna ha
You don't think he did this
His hand comes away
From his heart
know he didn't
She nods
Nods
Her eyes filling
Moving over his face
Come to supper, tonight
My mother would be proud to have you with us
He hears the emotion in her voice
He swallows hard
can't
No,  can't
Tell your mom
want a rain check
'  - Kabuo sits on the cot, the way we have always seen him
Alone in his mind
Footfalls
Kabuo oblivious, far away
The door open
You have a visitor, son
Turns to the visitor
You said three minutes
Won't take two
And Moran leaves
The door  shut
They are alone
Only one man smiling
Please, sit down
But the tall man doesn't
Doesn't move
She told me you're writing a column
We're very grateful
Ishmael nods, awkwardly
Acknowledging this
She
Said you two go way back
Ishmael stares into Kabuo's earnest smile
That's nice
You said there was a lantern in his hand
When you found him in the fog
Kabuo blinks
The man's tone is formal
As if the offer of friendliness is somehow rejected
And another one
Lashed to the mast
Kabuo's own smile has faded
The mask has returned
That's right
Two
Lanterns
And Kabuo grins
In spite of himself
If  did the math right
Ishmael leans back
Against the door
It's the sheriff's math
'm wondering about
'  - Blackness
The sound of wind
Of water lapping at wood
of a key, springing a lock
The  of a large  sliding away
door  open, and from the sound of it, a large one
Gray light seeps in
(
) Blackmail
That's all it is
See them now
Three  framed in thr barn's open doorway
Against the night sky
(
) call it keeping your promise
We said if  ever needed some cooperation from you
soft , and the  go on
Such as they are
few bare bulbs strung across the rafters of this towering ramshackle enclosure
50-year-old mildewed barn, built of creosoted timbers
This is a place for overhauling boats, with sea doors facing the harbor
Two  are tied to wide-elbowed piers
We've seen them before
You threatened me, Chambers, pure and simple
And what idiot's gonna believe some cock and bull story that  made a deal to keep stuff outta your paper
Not that anybody reads your paper
Abel Martenson leads the way
Along soaking planks
Same idiots who'll believe you cracked this case
When  tell 'em you did
Moran snorts
Points up to the cross spar, high on the mast of the first boat
See, no lantern
(respectfully) Sheriff
That's Miyamoto's boat
Oh
Moran swings his gaze up to the second boat
(quiet triumph) No lantern there, neither
Sure enough
No lantern on the cross spar
They keep walking
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place
It's public record
If the public cares enough to read it
They step across the gunnel
Onto Carl Heine's boat
Flashlights working against the dim, eerie glow of distant bulbs, they enter Carl's cabin
Neat as a pin
Ishmael scans the floor
You said there was a coffee c
(sorry) picked it up
And points to the cup
Sitting on the counter
It's the only thing  moved, swear
It was right there
The sheriff glares at the boy
You wanna see that in the papers Don't ever touch something at a cri
And stops
Because Ishmael's gaze has gone to a kerosene lantern
In the corner
One lantern
Like the inventory says
Sorry to disappoint you
But Ishmael is out the door
Shining his flashlight
Up the mast
Actually
was hoping you got it right
What's that, up there
And they all squint up
Shining their lights together
Along the cross spar
Nothin'
Bits of string
That's what it looks like
Many of them
Pieces of twine aren't nothing
And he steps to the base of the mast
Puts the flashlight in his pocket
Wraps his arm around the shaft of wood
Here now, what are you fixin' to do
Have a look
At nothing
And wrapping his legs around the mast, he hoists himself up
You can't go up there, touch things
With all his strength
Ishmael begins to climb
(grunting) Trial's over, Sheriff, it's with the jury now
Supporting himself with his legs, he struggles upward
You gonna climb that with one arm
You're right
better use two
Up he goes, inching his way, Abel shining his flashlight
Moran swings his beam up, too
There's lots of 'em, Art, look
And Moran is looking
Saying nothing
Now, Ishmael is there
dozen or more, all figure eights
All cut clean through on an angle
And look at that streak of rust, across the mast
His light playing on it
Bracing his full weight with his legs, Ishmael fingers the scraps of rope
It's on the twine, too
But it's not r
Don't prove there was two lanterns
Coulda been the one in the cabin
Still supporting  himself with his legs, Ishmael pulls out his flashlight
There's a stretch of ground between guessin' and provin', Sheriff
'll give you that
shines it  on the deck
Along the gunnel
Just below the mast
And as we watch the circle of light move
(
) What do you think you're lookin' at now
Still moving
And in the silence, an absent
(
) Not what 'm looking at
It's what 'm looking for
- Eleven citizens around a walnut table
Eleven
Glaring at the twelfth
Well
guess it comes down to a feeling, don't it
If feel uncertain,  feel a doubt Isn't that it
And the boat builder smiles amicably, rubs his gray beard
No other smiles
Anywhere
Alex, nobody ain't ever sure about nothin'
It's un reasonable to be so stubborn that you think you're smarter than eleven folks who all agree The man sat there and admitted he lied , Mr
Van Ness
Now why isn't that enough for you
We're not tryin' him for lying
Lots of us told lies, one time or another
Prob'ly none of us murdered anybody
But what drives a man to lie
Means he's hiding somethin'
Not necessarily that he killed Carl
'm not sayin' you're wrong, just that  have my doubts
Look, if you changed chairs right now, cos you doubted that maybe a chunk of the moon was gonna fall through the roof, that wouldn't be reasonable doubt
Folks turn to Burke
What the hell are you talking about
(laughs) Okay, you win that one
Now can we all go to bed
McQUEEN The mooring line
Doesn't that tell you something
think it does
Miyamoto was on Carl's boat, or vice-versa
Not much doubt about th
McQUEEN And Carl's blood on the gaff
There's a chance it came from his hand
There's a chance of everything
But you add a chance from here and a chance from there, the world ain't made a coincidences only
Everyone agrees
Almost everyone
Look, if he gave Carl a battery like he said, he'd only a had one left
Not two
He explained that
He replaced it
McQUEEN Only he threw that part in when he got cornered
But first time around, he never mentioned it
Alex, stop arguin' just to argue
You can see what really happened, same as us
Isn't that what we're supposed to do is tell the actual truth
My God, Carl died, here
So  don't care Carl died, unless 'm ready to reach for the hangman's rope
You oughta stop tryin' to bully me into hurrying
Little anger in that
It brings a silence
Been six hours
You sayin' there's a way to go slower
'  - Nels in a ratty, frayed old robe, pouring hot water from a kettle into mismatched cups
His hair is wispy and wild, his eyes puffy
He  horrible
his throat
Well
It's imaginative
And drops tea bags into the cups with a splash
'll give you that
Lisps over to the cluttered table
Where his guest is waiting
It's the way it happened,  know it is
No, you don't
Nels sits
Slowly
Ishmael removes his bag
Sips his tea
That report
About the freighter
You didn't find that tonight, did you
No answer
Ishmael keeps sipping
Holding eye contact
You went right to the cell
Then to the boat
Then here
How long did you know about the freighter
(just above a whisper) One day
Nels' turn
To sip his tea
This tastes horrible, hmmn
You're wondering why  held it
'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones
in the middle of the night
And he smiles
wonderful smile
Your daddy
Was quite a feller
Yes, he was
Another sip
He's looking down
And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday
He's proud of the man you are tonight
That's what counts
To my father
Everything counts
Nels watches the pain in that
What if  told you he once said to me
don't matter the road we take
Just so we get there
(smiles) Then you'd be lying
Doesn't make me wrong
- The jury once more in the jury box
their faces
The faces we saw last night
(
) All right, let's say that twine had been there to lash a lantern
That it had come from the shuttle of twine found in the deceased's pocket
Edith Twardzik
Burke Latham
Alexander Van Ness
(
) Now to re-open a trial that had gone to jury
new evidence should be pretty important
See Ishmael
Quiet, intense
On the witness stand
(
) Tell us why that lantern would be so significant
Well
It shows the prosecutor was wrong
It was Carl's boat that was dead in the water
Or he'd never have put up the lantern
Nels thinks about that
So the jury will, too
Now you believe there were two lanterns when defendant arrived
One in Carl's hand
The second lashed to the mast
That's what Mr
Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie
He couldn't know that it would help his case
Well, why does it
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast
Was never found
So we have to ask
slight shurg
Stating the obvious
where did it go
And then
Maybe it went
Where Carl went
Over the side
Objection
Speculation
Nels smiles his grandfather smile
Your Honor, all of this is speculation
Including Mr
Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call
Tht was summation, Your
(gently) Overruled, Alvin
Let's hear this, hmmn
Nels Gudmundsson nods to himself
Takes a stroll over to the jury box
No limp today
Something has put some spring in his step
So how does this fit with what you told us at the start
The freighter that plowed through Ship Channel Bank
And turns
Leaning his scrawny butt against the jury's rail
He'll watch this with them now
That's when he fell
Fell
Ishmael settles in
Here we go
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left
Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing
But at some point, he thinks of the lantern
Still lashed to the mast
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there
So he climbs up
To cut it down
Just as the freighter comes through
Isn't that quite a coincidence
Coincidences happen
You run a yellow light just as a car comes out of nowhere
Split-second tragedy happens every day
Or maybe
Maybe
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working
Same report Milholland heard
And that makes him get the lantern fast
Before the freighter's wake can bang it around
But you could be wrong
He could have climbed up earlier
Then where's the lantern
And where's the knife
The knife
What knife
As if he really has forgotten
As if he wants to know
Coroner found an empty knife sheath on Carl's belt
But they never found the knife
He's nodding
Yes, that's right
He climbs up
His hand wound still bleeding
That's the blood  found on the mast
And the twine
Nels' eyes are rapt
His mouth is shut
No way he interrupts this roll
He cuts the lantern free, the freighter's wake hits , the boat rolls hard , his bloody hand slips tracing blood along the mast
hush
He falls
The lantern, the knife, go into the water
Same as Carl
The words hang there
And inside the cabin, a coffee cup falls off the counter
Shakes his head
But there's no one around
To pick it up
Nels ponders
Puts his hand to his chin
Still a coincidence
Timing and all
The freighter started through at 1:42
The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it
At 1:47
to the defendant
Ramrod straight, nothing revealed in his face
And to his wife
Elegant, erect
Her eyes flooded with tears
Still and all
Carl was a strong swimmer, he m
He hit his head
On the way in
Silence
You think so
The sheriff and the deputy and inspected the deck closely
We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel
Just below the mast
Well, anything coulda caused that
Ishmael nods
No smile at all
Anything
That had a blond hair
And Nels is walking now
Toward the prosecutor's table
Pulling a small cellophane bag from hisinside pocket
Request introduction of Exhibit 18
One single blond hair
Which Sheriff Moran dug out of that fracture
Below the mast
Of Carl Heine's boat
Lays the bag on the table
Just in front of Hooks
Turns to the judge
We will call Sheriff Moran, who will confirm this
And Coroner Whaley to testify that the damage to the gunnel is of a size and nature not inconsistent with the deceased's skull fracture
Turns to the prosecutor
But for now
Your witness
And just strolls on over to his seat
Looks in his client's eyes
How 'bout them apples
Kabuo loves this old guy
And right here, he lets a little of that show
Across the way, the prosector is rising
He smiles
Friendly, almost amused
have to start reading your paper more closely
You're quite a storyteller
(straight back) Thank you
Coming from the man who wrote, 'But here, adrift in the fog, plead for your help'
that's quite a compliment
There is a ripple of laughter
But no smile on Ishmael's features
His game face is on
Come and get me, sucker
And Hooks does come, one step at a time
Straight to the box
Everything had to happen just right
For your little story to fly
mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a lot of reasons
'm sorry, was there a question in there
No love lost
And no pretense about it
Hatsue Miyamoto sits with her hand in her mother's
Watching these men battle for her husband's life
Well, the freighter
The twine
The blood
The knife
The cup
The watch
The second battery
The phantom lantern
The fishing gaff
The cracked gunnel
The skull wound
The blond hair
That's eleven things
Twelve
Hooks smiles
stand corrected, sir
And you have a neat explanation for every one of them
Hooks nods
Yes, you do
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork
What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts
My expertise
Is that 'm a journalist
Right at his eyes
And journalism
Is balance
Finding the facts folks need to know
The words ring with quiet, heartfelt conviction, that others cannot fully appreciate
Then putting them together
So truth is revealed
But isn't the truth that there are several other ways to explain each of these twelve pieces
Oh, yes
And the prosecutor stops
Confused for an instant by this confession
Until
But no other way
To explain them all
heart-stopping hush
As everyone, as Hooks himself, sees the cehckmate
And since they all happened
This is the only explanation that's the truth
The prosecutor looks like he's been slapped
Like every act of will is necessary to maintain composure
To find the easy, untroubled smile
Your line of work
You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth
Like you couldn't believe
Service returned
Hooks leans in
Well, the defendant is a liar
He's confessed that much
And his explanation is
he was afraid
And leans in some more
Afraid that the good folks of this jury
Would be too stupid to understand
Too prejudiced to be fair
Shakes his head
You buy that
(gently) think he was greedy
And once more
The prosecutor can only blink
Can only move toward the trap
Greedy
He didn't want to lose any more
No smile
No smile as the trap springs shut
He'd lost a lot in the war, you see
had sent him away
To a concentration camp
But a nice one
Far less brutal than the Nazis
Because 'm a civilized person
He stops
Lets Hooks clear his throat
asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h
That's how journalists
Answer questions
Turns to Judge Fielding
With all respect
May  answer the question, Your Honor
Anout the defendant's motivation to lie
wouldn't miss it for the world, son
Now, you say you sent the defendant to Manzanar
didn't say
did it alone
And things get real quiet
So there he was
His father lost his health there, finally died
They lost more than Etta Heine's seven acres
They lost their liberty, their dignity
Their ideals about this country
So much feeling in this
He has to stop
Swallow hard
They lost their trust in us
We had treated them worse than animals
How would we now see tham
As human beings
Tells the jury
Straight to their faces
This man lost a lot in the war
He didn't want now to lose his babies
Or the woman who loves him
Another level of quiet
He turns to the prosecutor
And my expertise in this, sir
Is that  lost a lot in the war myself
Words coming from someplace very deep
And the fact that  am the only witness
Who placed his right hand upon the Holy Bible
Is the least of it, sir
assure you of that
Silence
Well, sir
hate to spoil the soliloquy,  truly do
But the fact is
you are not on trial here
Nor is Judge Fielding, or myself
Nor the good people of this jury
For events that took place twelve years ago
No sir
And  wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful
At a tactic that insults their intelligence
That's curious
was appealing to their intelligence
Were you, sir
Can you prove one word of all your fancy story
No, sir,  can't
Not beyond a reasonable doubt
And he smiles
First time
It's fortunate that the man who needs to prove his fancy story
Beyond a reasonable doubt
Is someone else
There is laughter in the room, so welcome is any chance to relieve the tension
The gavel
'm sorry, Mr
Hooks
apologize for my tone
This is not a contest
Between you and me
Shakes his head
No, it isn't
For it is not
As Mr
Gudmundsson so wisely put it
small trial
In a small place
His eyes are damp now
Strangely enough, after all this
He is at last on the brink of losing control
Because
lost more in that war than anyone will ever know
So did a lot of folks
And what we got back in return
His voice breaks slightly
But it rings with dignity on
was a country
Where a man was innocent
Until we proved him guilty
And the voice drops
To just above a whisper
Whether we all got cheated
We're about to find out
- on Hatsue Miyamoto, speaking earnestly, her eyes down, her purse in her lap, her slender hands expressing the intensity of her feelings as she makes her point, and we
to reveal that she is on a corridor bench, surrounded by a half dozen , who are crouching, standing, scribbling away
Two  pop flashes that she does not seem to notice, as she continues with refined determination, and we
, down the hallway to the  of a man who sits alone, unnoticed
There is an unopened pack of cigarettes in his only hand, turning absently in long, strong fingers that crinkle the pristine cellophane
His eyes are fixed to hatsue, holding court at a distance
Fixed, as if no other sight could ever command this level of attention
(
) All things considered
Hearing the voice, Ishmael looks down
Uneasy to have been caught staring so intently
you were adequate
No smile accompanies the irony
For that would be condescending
could make a few quibbles, but am loathe to hurt your feelings
The old man sits
Very slowly
Cigarette
'll take two
One for later
Ishmael tries to tear the cellophane without success
Nels seems not even to notice
(quietly) She is simply
Beautiful
Ishmael's eyes cut to him
little quickly
Confides
've always thought so
There it sits
His fingers claw absently at the cellophane
Nels makes no move to intervene
If  whistle
Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'
You're the story today
You ever been strangled by a single hand
Naw, 've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes
Comfortable together
In this hour of discomfort
Ishmael brings the corner of the pack to his teeth, and tears the cellophane away
Better take three
Fingers nimbly shred the seal, open the pack
Maybe they'll keep us waiting
Shake the tips free
Holds the pack forward
(very quiet) Maybe they won't
The way he said that
Subtly ominous
Ishmael watching Nels' face, as the old man takes two cigarettes
Prejudice is like any obsession
Tucks one in his pocket
And his eyes slide, unmistakably, to Hatsue
There's a reason why we can't let go
Even when we want to
Ishmael is stone still
Nels just gazing at Hatsue
Until
reason
(simply) We don't want to
Looks back to Ishmael
Very straight
Hate or love
It works the same
In the silence
Your client's wife ever mention
We go way ba
(softly) Her mother
May have said something
There it is
Kindness in this old man's face
He brings the other cigarette to his lips
And Ishmael takes out the match box
Never breaking eye contact
We don't let go, you s
It's a rare thing
Takes a turning point
Expertly, Ishmael's fingers withdaw a match
You gave this jury three chances
To turn
Palming the box, Ishmael  the match
On his belt buckle
No other way to explain it all That was one
caught some of 'em fluttering, waking up, on that
Reaches the flame toward the old man
Second
You sent him to Manzanar, and you didn't do it alone liked that one, they didn't
No surprise
Nels leans to the flame
Sucks it in
Savors a drag
Last
You gave your arm
To buy this woman back her husband
Are they gonna cheat you out of that
(
, calling out) ' '
Everywhere, the buzz , there is motion an expectation
But Nels doesn't seem to notice
Some let go, some don't
Where did you
Asked so casually
Ishmael turns
Hatsue is standing now, surrounded by people, her mother grasping her arm
(a murmur) Hooks called her deceitful
And  knew she wasn't
He's watching her
Across the way
So intently
She was an honest person
Doing the best she could
We follow her approach toward the courtroom door
She has not yet turned to us
(
) The prosecutor, the judge, cut her off
She was desperate
Her husband helpless
was helpless
Nels rises
With great effort
You couldn't let her
Be helpless
Ishmael's eyes still fixed to Hatsue, grim-faced, listening to her mother's murmurings, as she
disappears through the door
Never having looked our way
When this verdict is read
She may look for your face
And Ishmael's eyes come up
Because the voice commands it
Here's what she needs to see:  This is nothing
We win it on appeal
The old man is stern and strong
He wants a promise
It'll be there
- The hush of a hundred silences
We can feel the air crackle in the stillness
Judge Fielding is leafing through papers
No one coughs, no one blinks
(clears his throat) Mister foreman, has the jury reached a verdict
He looks up
Across the distance, Harold Jensen rises in the jury box
We have, Your Honor
And holds out a slip of paper
Little more than a scrap
Folded once
Will the bailiff please bring the verdict to the bench
The bailiff does so, walking crisply to minimize his moment in the limelight
He hands the slip to the judge, who unfolds it, and
stops
Staring for a hung instant
As if seeing something unexpected
he folds it again, rather carefully, thoughtfully, and as he hands it back to the bailiff
(softly) Will the defendant please rise
Kabuo and Nels rise together
But it is only into the defendant's eyes that the judge stares
No expression in the face of either man
But something passes, all the same
As the bailiff crosses to return the verdict to the foreman, we every pair of eyes in the room are on the foreman, now opening the slip of paper
Every pair
But one
(
) Will the foreman please read the verdict aloud
One reporter stares across the grain of all other sight lines
Toward a woman who does not see him
In case she needs his eyes
To be waiting
(reads) We the jury, find the defendant, Kabuo Kenji Miyamoto, to be not guilty of the cri
sharp , and the defendant's mother-in-law covers her mouth in embarrassment
(continues) of the crime with which he has been char
breaks out from the back row of the gallery, where citizens of Japanese ancestry have forgotten custom and decorum, as has
a woman who comes  of her seat, tears on her face, not even realizing she is standing, Hatsue clings to the railing that separates her from her husband
Throughout the gallery, now
some of the citizens assembled add their applause
Others look awkward, not knowing how to react
The gavel lies untouched, unnoticed, by a jurist who has no problem with anything that is taking place right now
Saying only to the jury
This is your verdict, so say you all
As they assent
This Court thanks you for the good work you have done under difficult circumstances
Reaches  to the gavel, turns to the defendant
Go home, son
God bless
the gavel on its block
The defendant is  of his chair, and with one strong grip of gratitude to the frail shoulder of his counsel, he is
the rail, through the  of flashbulbs, she is  his arms, the embrace so  on both sides, everyone crowding around them
An old man's eyes sweep the gallery, looking for someone
Only to find
Ishmael's back
As he disappears through the door
- The Miyamotos holding court, surrounded by nearly twenty reporters and photographers, and countless looky-loo's of all persuasions
Hatsue's face is flushed and intense, unsmiling, she seems scarcely to have caught her breath
She holds tight to her husband's hand, as he
carries his baby son in the other arm, his 8-year-old daughter leaning against him, her 4-year-old sister standing on the bench beside her mom
Kabuo submits to questions with a boyish grin of humility and friendliness
An American family
Photogenic as hell
#1 And how about the jury
You had confidence they'd see justice done
Kabuo glances to his lawyer, wanna field this one
But Nels sends it back with a twinkle
Oh, sure
These are our neighbors, you know
They've got good hearts
We could see they were following the evidence real close
At his side, Hatsue seems to be scanning the jumble of faces
We're just grateful to every one of them
looking for something she doesn't find
#2 And you ma'am
You felt the same as your husband,  expect
Her eyes move to the eager young man
She reflects for a beat
Honestly, no
Which catches everyone
little short
(quietly) felt my husband would be found guilty
Unless proven innocent
No apologies for the truth
That's not her way
And Mr
Chambers did that
vending machine stands in silence
The eerie strobing glow of defective neon
as
Ishmael thinks it over
Drops in his dime
Pulls the plunger, to watch a Snickers fall
Scoops the candy from the tray, pins it between his body and the machine
tears the wrapper
to the reporters
The crowd of onlookers has grown
#3 can we get some background on your handsome family
understand you two were childhood sweethearts
And brings his Parker pen to his notepad
His subject smiles easily
Well, no sir, not exactly
We met in the Manzanar camp, you see, so guess that was the most beautiful place 've ever been
There is gentle laughter
And as Kabuo looks up, he sees something in the rear of the crowd
Something we do not
And softly
No, her first love was another fella
Which brings Hatsue's eyes up, following his gaze
And there, in the back
man watches
Eating a candy bar
(
) was the lucky one
No one sees their eyes lock
It is only an instant
It is enough
#4 It all sounds very romantic, ma'am
Falling in love under those circumstances
And as she looks to the reporter, Ishmael begins to walk away
He went off to the Army, right from Manzanar
And that last night, we danced alone in the desert
And somehow, Ishmael catches the eye of Hatsue's 4-year-old daughter
So he pulls a coin from his pocket
(
) told him
If you don't come back alive, 'll kill you
Ishmael  the coin across his knuckles
And the child responds
With her mother's smile
- Alone on the steps where the Strawberry Princess once winked at him
Snow has begun to fall, soft and altogether beautiful
He squints up
(
) God's kindness, my father said
Despite the hardship
it reminds us
Of our place in things
Our place in things
He slides a black cigar between his teeth
(
) What the hell
Did he mean by that
He has the match box
Manipulating it with the dexterity we've come to know
(
) Things fall on us,  suppose
From the sky
the match on his belt buckle
(
) Wars
Freighters plowing through
Cupping it expertly in a single motion, he brings the flame to the cigar
single puff
(
) And we seem
helpless
Until we understand
One more
Savors it
The sky
The thought
(
) Accident rules every corner of the universe
Down the steps
Snow swirling between us
Gone
(
) Except the chambers
Of the human heart
