Written by Karen Walton July 15th, 1996 -- The house is dark
The moon is almost full
dog barks
melancholy voice, worn for its age, narrates: (/o) Ever try bein' different
An, don't mean jus' thinkin' about it, either
Ginger an' me - mean
The house numbers read 669
The 9 slips: the number now reads 666
('//) Ginger an'
Went for different
Big time
There's a light on in a basement window
We creep up to it, crushing the tulip
borders on the way
The window is propped open with a sneaker: it looks like somebody's foot is caught in it
Music plays inside- '   - Gyrating in her underwear to bad-girl grunge, (15) straddles   (also 15 and in underwear) on one of the twin single beds
Both girls have cigarettes lolling on their lower lips
Both girls have pierced eyebrows, pierced noses and streaked hair
Brigitte has blue nail polish on
Ginger has breasts
Brigitte
Quit dickin' around
Jus' do it
Brigitte reluctantly stops her thrashing and douses a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol
Without looking up from her   comic, Ginger hauls her own shirt up to expose her navel
Brigitte swabs Ginger's navel with the wet cotton ball
Her eyes drift to Ginger's chest, then back to what she's doing
(/) Ginger's ten months older than me
we're seriously tight
Share everything
Everything
Around them, many candles burn
There's a dead bolt on the door
An attached full bath
The floors are thick with paranormal books
The walls are covered in images of 's and horror flicks
framed photo of Kurt Cobain with Courtney Love has a place of honor
There's an old Polaroid of the girls at five in Halloween costumes; Lill Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf
Ginger is the wolf
Brigitte produces an enormous darning needle
It glints
she levels it at Ginger's navel, her hand shaking
Ready
(without looking up) Uh-huh
can't
Ginger gives Brigitte a look over the top of her comic
Brigitte takes a deep breath, and lines the needle up again
Brigitte swallows hard and applies pressure
The needle pierces Ginger's skin
Her stomach muscles flinch
You said it wouldn't hurt
Jus' hurry up
The needle has stopped moving half-way through the skin
Uh-oh
Brigitte wiggles the needle
Blood wells up around it
Um
think it's stuck
Oh man
There's blood
Ginger lowers her comic
she takes one look at the needle half-
in, half-out of her belly button - and cracks up
snot funny, Ginger
Laughing her head off, Ginger gives the needle a good tug from her end
The skin tugs with it, resisting
Ali, gawd, gross
Ginger yanks the needle, hard
This time it moves
got it,  got it
Ginger grits her teeth
The needle begins a slow progress
It's goin', it's goin'- gimme the ring Brigitte grabs at a tiny silver ring on the bed spread but knocks it to the floor
Brigitte scrambles after it
Ginger yanks the needle
Bee
'mon
Brigitte finds the ring and hands it to Ginger
Ginger sets the ring on the end of the needle, looping it not-so-neatly through
Oh, groo-oo-o-ss
The bloody needle pops clear
Ginger grinds on the ring to close it
Ginger wipes her bloody hands on the bed
Brigitte is taking deep, gulping breaths
Bee
Feeb
'okay
Yeah
think so
() Yeah,  think not
If you din't say it hurt, 'd a been fine
Ginger beams at her new piercing
Pretty cool, unh
The flesh around the navel is hot pink and bruising
Brigitte grins too
very cool
Now 'll do you
Brigitte bravely hangs onto to her smile
(/) We do everything together
But, at fifteen
chick can change
Ya know
[3A
You got no idea
- It's a beautiful autumn day in suburbia
Birds sing
The terrier next door () barks and barks
pierced navel is stretched taught, filling with blood
Ginger's limp body is bent backward over a low fence
Blood is flowing from where she's been speared through her chest: Ginger's impaled on a white picket
(/) Don't get me wrong
It's not like we were all happy or nothin' to begin with
Brigitte takes a long, ponderous drag on her cigarette as - unmoved - she takes in Ginger's mortal wound
Brigitte eyes the identical homes and gardens that stretch on to the horizon
(/) The suburb of Bailey Downs
Basically a well lit black hole
The Kingdom of cul du sac
That's French for Dead End
Brigitte flicks her smoke into a pile of neatly raked leaves
It smolders then goes out
She scowls
(/) You had a gram of personality out here
Life bit the big one
truck with    on its side pulls up a few houses over
Brigitte watches a shirtless sun-bronzed Adonis -  -- climb out of the cab
(/) Of course 'm generalizing
tarty teenage girl -  - bounds up to Sam and gives him a big wet one
(/0) No 'm not
The fuck, Bee
Take a picture already
Brigitte raises a 35mm still camera to her eye and frames her sister's corpse in the viewfinder
: snap
slide of Ginger - dead on a white picket fence - smashes on
The   are superimposed on each of the slide images: snap
Ginger sliced up with an electric knife in the kitchen, Snap
Ginger drowned in a bubble bath, Snap
Ginger hanged by nylons in the laundry room, Snap
Ginger mangled under the front tires of a mini van
:
- The Fitzgerald sisters stand over a slide projector in art class, just finishing the slide show from the credit sequence
An empty frame of blinding white light snaps onto the collapsible screen at the front of the room
The homely   looks very concerned as she hits the lights
The other  a-- all about fifteen, middle-class and raging conformists -- sit in stunned silence
As Brigitte and Ginger return to their side-by-side seats, (/) We were always considered freaks
For as long as  can remember, there was Us
And there was Them
Like from kindergarten
Very -um

What does it mean for you
Brigitte shrugs and squirms
Means there's more to life than -- well, li

The Fitzgeralds look expectantly at row after row of blank faces
Brigitte shakes her head
(/) Attempts at communication wore futile
McCARDY- a good-looking high school Casanova - looks Ginger over appraisingly
Ginger ignores him
(/) Some of Them did seem to wanna reach Ginger
Brigitte glances from Ginger's breasts to her own flat chest
Brigitte takes a deep breath
(/) But nobody wanned to reach me
The bell goes
(/) (a tad defensive) Like  cared
- clog the halls
Judging by the herd, Bailey High is not big on individual identity, or at least its outward expression
Ginger and Brigitte slip down the crowded corridors, sticking out like sore thumbs
Ginger holds her forehead
Gawd, People
They hurt my brain
They didn't even get it
They're retards
They're cretins
They're bone-heads
't'hey' re somnambulists
They're leems
They're the goddamn walkin'-/ The girls stop before their locker
folded up piece of loose leaf has been crushed into it, its end sticking out
() Another one
Ginger opens the locker
She unfolds the paper
There's a big fat joint inside, and a note that says: ,  555- 4636
Ginger pockets the joint, crumples the paper into a ball and tosses it at a near-by trash can
She misses
The girls head down the hall
Somebody leaves you all
these jays an, yer not even curious to call
Ginger offers her a sucker and has one herself
No pe
scoops up the wad of loose leaf with great resentment and jams it into the trash
Brigitte and Ginger pass a   practically dry- humping,  applying make-up to one another, and snapping each other with their sports cups
Jason and his fellow jock-pals , , and  are scoping babes
Ginger bends to tie her boot lace and a collective groan swells from the guys
See
She's weird, but hot
Anybody poled Fitzy yet
Brigitte gives them a disgusted look
Not that one
The cute one
Brigitte's face falls
Ginger gives them a Death Stare
The boys try flirty smiles
(to Brigitte) Sad
Must be hard to think with yer brains slappin' around yer thighs like that all day
Brigitte laughs
Ginger pulls her on, past a sign:
(/) We didn't do guys
Guys were too gross
Everyone at Bailey High was just too incredibly gross
Ginger applies her boot to a swinging door and they enter, '   - The Fitzgeralds stop dead
They take in a menagerie of 90210- wanna-be  changing for gym class
The background chat is all sex and mascara
There is only one free spot: next to Trina and her The Trinas slide into a-size-too-small shorts while parading hefty chests
The Trina acts like she owns the goddamn planet
(/) The only thing worse than most teenage boys are most teenage girls
Trinas are the limit
Ginger digs at her lower abdomen painfully
feel sick
Me too
No,
mean really
Gingler opens a locker and tears off her clothes
Other girls glance at her navel piercing with disgust
Brigitte is very self-conscious: she steps almost inside the locker, hiding behind the door while she changes into the revolting school gym outfit
She eyes the buxom bubble heads with contempt, as (/) There was really only one Trina, but they were all the same
Trina finds the Fitzgeralds' open locker door a nuisance
She pushes it out of her way, hard enough to whack Brigitte in the head on the other side
() Ooops
Sorry
Ginger gives Trina a very dirty look
Brigitte tries to rub her sore head while clutching her uniform to cover her chest
Trina and her posse cackle as they prance out, their butt cheeks waggling
The sisters continue changing
1 0 (to Brigitte) ' okay's her
Like to feed her ground glass with tacks for desert
Then make her puke it back up and swallow it again until she's like shredded to a bazillion pieces from the inside out
Ginger grips her sides painfully and bends double
, what's the matter
got gas
Maybe 'll try an, cut one right in her face out there
They slap hands, laughing
They look down at their gym outfits, which are  unflattering
Brigitte and Ginger exchange identical looks of agony
- The twenty or so participants in this all-girl gym class stand ready at centre field in lacrosse padding and helmets
Brigitte and Ginger stand apart from the others, sharing a smoke
Brigitte looks scared
Ginger looks ill
(/) After two weeks a' high school
, ya come to the conclusion it's all about agony
Take Phys

- an aging former-traffic cop - hucks the players sticks with nets on one end
Sykes is given to screaming
Field lacrosse is no pussy-assed tea party, ya get  there, get a  on your target and want   want
The Trinas giggle at Sykes
Ginger bends forward, holding her sides
1 1 Shake a leg, Fitzgeralds
An, butt out, you gotta death wish
Feel really sick, Mz
Sykes
Cigarettes'll do that for you
Move
Ginger flicks the smoke at Sykes' turned back
It falls short, of course
The sisters trudge to their places on the field
Ginger is on the offensive line
Brigitte is in goal
(/) Phys
Ed
is not optional at Bailey High
Sykes blows the whistle
fast-moving, hard-hitting lacrosse scrimmage begins
- : Ginger gets caught in the crunch of sticks and bodies, pushed, kicked, and punished by the Trinas, who are having 'fun'
- : Brigitte visibly cowers as a tangle of marauding, ball-whacking bodies descend on her
She takes a number of direct hits from the hard rubber ball
on a powerful press for a goal, Trina slams into Brigitte so hard Brigitte flies right out of the net area
And skids face-first
into a mangled dog's body
The whistle blows and play stops
Ginger lopes over, breathless, gripping her sore stomach
(/) been waiting for this
There'd been a lot of dead dogs around lately, but this was my personal first
Brigitte slowly climbs out of the mucky canine remains to her knees
She's covered in doggie guts and maggots
Oh,  ----

Even Sykes struggles with a gag reflex on seeing Brigitte' s mess
Brigitte fingers the dog's remains with a look of fascination
(/) 'Kay, here's the weird thing about me

Live things make me sick, they're all warm and snotty and shitty and pissy

What crap
All , ladies, settle
This is no joke
You have information about the dog deaths you do (by rote) Tell a teacher, Principal Fardor, or the police
Teen cult my ass
Look Ginge', something went for its throat - it's not cut, it's chewed
Brigitte looks up in time to see Ginger's eyes roll back in her head
Ginger faints
The class inhales as one

Sykes and the class stampede up
Sykes pushes Brigitte out of the way
(/0) Ginger's no pussy
She doesn't faint
might faint
Like, if this pooch were only -dead, could faint
Brigitte stumbles over the dog carcass
She hugs herself
'   -- Brigitte sits in her bloodied uniform, chewing her nails
- a Mrs
Doubtfi
re-type who chirps more than speaks - is examining Ginger
The fainting' s worrisome you don't diet do you dear
No
Hm
Anemia's very common at your age
Eat more red meat, try an iron vitamin supplement
If it happens again, straight to a proper doctor, all righty
Brigitte looks relieved
Now as for 'the headache, cramps, lower back pain
'm guessing your period is due
haven't got a, um, period
Never
Flow old are you
Fifteen
our mother says we're late bloomers
1 4 Well judging by your troubles, 'd say you can expect to blossom any time now
Brigitte pulls a face
Ferry produces numerous samples of feminine hygiene products and heaps them onto Ginger
Are you familiar with all these
Ginger shrugs
Now what suits one girl might not be comfortable for another
The proper form of protection is a personal choice, and may have a lot to do with your menstrual flow, which naturally changes during the time you'll have your little miracle of nature
It could start thick and syrupy, move to a straight-forward basic bright red bleeding and then perhaps a deep brownish to blackish slime, signaling the end of the flow
Twenty-eight days later or there abouts, it'll start all over again and continue every month until menopause, in about thirty years' time
Nurse Ferry produces a pocket calendar with a tampon or pad advertisement for every month
(') Here's a little calendar to keep track, count from the day it starts twenty-eight days
That'll be your next time
You have any questions, come see me again
(to Brigitte) You too sweetheart, be your turn shortly,  expect
Brigitte Looks horrified
1 5 / - (/) Here's a dirty word
Inevitability
That fate fully intended us to be typical in any way, sooner or later, was so insulting
Ginger and Brigitte trudge homeward looking completely depressed
Brigitte flips through the feminine hygiene calendar
Ginger watches the pavement beneath her feet
(reading a panty- liner ad) "Some days it's all you need
"-
What does that mean
So you pulled a Quincy on that dog, unh
Hunh
Ginger grabs the calendar and sticks it in her pocket
Quincy, that guy with the stiffs on cable
Alls  remember is you goin', "Teen cult my ass"
Oh
Right
Well,  dunno
Brigitte shrugs
She gives Ginger a funny look
Why are you looking at me like that
Do  look - different
No
Can you tell 'm going to-
No
Really
Ginger squints at her, unconvinced
- /July 22, 1996 1 6 Wham
Total adultness
How can have a miracle of nature an, not be old enough to drive
fiurih
The fuck
Ginger kicks a kiddie toy hard into a yard
Brigitte doesn't have an answer to this
- Their house looks like a set in a home show
The girls take it in from the front drive with expressions of complete weariness
Next door, Norman the terrier barks at them
Hey
If  start simpin' around tampon dispensers and moanin' over cramps, or even think about buying somethin' that says Baby Powder Fresh
You'll
shoot me, right
'i"' of course
They exchange grins
Out by sixteen or dead in this scene
Ginger raises her hand and Brigitte smacks it hard
As they mount the drive, Ginger picks up a stone and hucks it at Norman, who's still barking
She misses
(/) If we failed to get a life by Ginger's sixteenth birthday
we were s'posed to gas ourselves in the garage
For smart girls, we could be pretty dumb
we prob'ly never woulda done it, but we seemed to need a deadline
- The Fitzgerald family are having their evening meal
Their parents,  (see Men's Section, Seers catalogue) and 1 7 (see Martha Stewart's Idea of Living), are liberal, middle class folks in their early forties
Ginger looks bored
Brigitte eats like a pig
How was school today
Fine
(/) The nicest thing  could say about Henry and Pamela was also the meanest thing  could say
Didn't you have a presentation
How'd it go
Fine
Pamela and Henry exchange irritatingly patient smiles
(/) They were easily satisfied
rogue's gallery on the wall depicts Henry and Pamela's transformation over the years from angry young Ban The Bomb- types into middle-class mundane
Made an appointment for you girls at my gynecologist
Next Thursday
Henry studies his plate
Ginger almost imperceptibly shakes her head at Brigitte
Brigitte nods, understanding
why
You know why
we're not going to a gynecologist
What did  say about that tone of voice
You are going to the gynecologist

Right
Briggitte apes Henry's next line back to Ginger
Mmmm

The problem must be on your side, Henry
Pamela
This is not my fault
No one's at fault here
when did your sister start
1 9 've told you,  really have no idea
Oddly enough, we never discussed it

Anybody going to tell me what happened to my fence
From under the table, Henry produces the bloodied, sawed-off picket stained bloody from Ginger's impaling
Brigitte holds her full mouth open so Ginger can see its masticated contents
Ginger cracks up laughing
Henry and Pamela sigh
'  - Norman the terrier barks - - constantl Brigitte grimaces at the cartoon-style diagrams of How To Insert  Tampon
She carefully unwraps one and sets it in a glass of water
She times its expansion on her watch
Why din't you jus' tell her you're going to get it
20 Ginger is dissecting the gift joint from their locker
she sniffs its contents
Can't take her 'attention'
She grosses me out
Can't believe she's our mother
Brigitte puts a fresh tampon up her nose and lifts a Polaroid camera at arms' length from her face
Yeah, but now we have to see this doctor
You can jus' say you got it, but 'm screwed
The Polaroid spits out the front
Brigitte sticks another tampon in her free nostril, and one in each ear as, Did  get you out of Home Ec
Did  get you out of ballet classes
So 'll get you out of this, right
You better, gawd the idea Brigitte takes a Polaroid of herself with a tampon sticking out of every visible orifice
Ginger slides the grass into a pre-rolled fresh casing and sticks it in her mouth
said  will,  will
This jay's fine
Let us smoke, sister
Ginger cranks the stereo and throws on a coat
She double- takes Brigitte' s tampon face
are you doing
(sticking tampons under her upper lip) Look - a walrus
Hardee-har
Har
21 Ginger steps up on the bed and swings the ground-level window open
'  - Norman the terrier's incessant barking goes on in the distance
The moon is full tonight
plastic child's playhouse sits in their next door neighbors' back yard
cloud of blue smoke emanates from its doors and windows
There is an occasional
from within, and the whir of the Polaroid's motor

Brigitte tokes and passes the jay to Ginger
How'l1 you know when you finally get it any ways
Prob'ly feel like peein' your pants
Disgusting
Well 'm not too excited

Wish  was an unsolved mystery
Brigitte reflects on this heavy thought, nodding - stoned
Hey
You smell somethin' gross
- /July 15, 1996 22 '  - The girls sniff around the playhouse
Ginger steps on something that makes an evil squeeshy sound
She skids and ends up on her ass
This is so not my day
Brigitte helps her to her feet
Ginger shakes what she slipped on off her shoe
It's a long, ropy intestine
She drags her shoe to get the blood and goo of it
Nice
Dog shit
(thrilled to recognize the smell) That isn't shit
it's death
line of blood and gore trails across the grass to a back lane
Brigitte follows it
Ginger looks around for something on the ground
Great
Lost the jay
Great
- Ginger joins Brigitte, who's squatted before another dog's body
This one's a fresh kill
Ack, it's still warm, gross
Brigitte takes its picture
with the Polaroid, which is strung around her neck
Why every dog but the mutt next door to us
Hey, we could take it home
Try like, an autopsy
Like, crack the case
Nah
Let's put ' im in there so he won't
Lraumatize the kiddies
23 Ginger indicates a construction dumpster on the end of the lane
Disappointed, Bee rolls down her sleeves to cover her hands
Ginger does the same and they shovel the body onto their arms
They trot the dog over to the dumpster
Brigitte sulks
What
We never do what  wanna do
Oh, c' mon
Would stink up the whole room
They hoist the dog up and dump it in the dumpster
It's hind end sticks out
Brigitte climbs into the dumpster, dragging it all the way in
Dusting herself off, Ginger notices some blood on her thigh
Nice
Ginger wipes at the blood with her hand
More appears
She lifts up the hem of her skirt
Her face falls
She looks around
She slips her fingers up to her crotch
Her hand comes out bloody
Bee
got the curse
Brigitte stops rooting garbage over the dog
Serious
Ginger wiggles her wet fingers at her
We gotta go home
Eeew, 'kay
Brigitte catches her kilt on a nail sticking out of a plank in the trash
Something is crunching through the leaves toward them
Ginger peers out into the darkness
24 Hurry upt 'm stuck3 few homes down, a garage's motion-sensitive security lamp trips on
Ginger squints, blinded
Bee
: Brigitte contorts to deal with the nail
Brigitte tears her hem free and jumps down
The light snaps off
(indicating the opposite direction) Let's go this way
Brigitte dips a hand back into the dumpster for the plank with the nail
Off Ginger's look, Brigitte shrugs
They start walking down the lane
The greenery behind them starts swelling again
The leaves crunch, faster
Brigitte and Ginger look at one another, and walk faster
The lane empties behind a deserted strip mall
- Whatever is behind them knocks an empty trash can over
Brigitte grabs Ginger's arm, scared
This is stupid
We're getting farther from home
Ginger is pissed off now
she turns to confront their stalker
(to the darkness) All right you ass-/ She's cut cold by a roaring blur of speeding fur and teeth and claws:  takes Ginger down hard
We cannot see it as a whole, we can't make out what it is
It's big, heavy, and raging
Immense jaws snap vicious teeth, going for Ginger's jugular
Brigitte drops her plank

Brigitte grabs and kicks at the creature
Ginger raises her arms and covers her head, screeching and kicking
The thing grabs Ginger by the scruff and shakes the living daylights out of her

Brigitte snatches up the plank with the nails
Brigitte brings it down hard on the thing, screaming
She smacks it once, twice
The plank pops a shot off the camera: horrible set of jaws and one golden eye are caught for a split second in the light
The third hit evokes a yelp and the thing backs off, snarling
Brigitte quakes with the board raised, ready
The thing skitters before her as she screams
Ginger scrambles to her foot and grabs Bee with bloodied hands
Go-go-go-go-go-go
Brigitte drops the plank and they run like hell
for a main thorough-way ahead
It pursues them
- - The late-night traffic is light but consistent
The thing is still, coming
At a dead run Brigitte and Ginger sail between moving cars
The thing burns behind them
The girls are barely missed by an approaching truck
There is a long blast of a horn
Then a sickening thud
Brakes squeal incto a stop as a horrible dragging/ scrain fills the night air
The girls crash to the sidewalk, spilling over top of one another
They glance over their shoulders, even as they disappear into a new residential stretch
The    truck sits at a right angle in the road, it's front end smashed
26 Sam slowly opens the cab door
He staggers to the bloody grill, clearly shaken
He looks under the truck, and follows a wet trail of gore back behind it to the mangled furry mass about twenty feet back
He takes it in, stunned
Then Sam vomits
- Brigitte scrambles through the window and helps Ginger through after her
They're bloody, sweaty and tearful
They slump shaking, side by side on Ginger's bed, catching their breath
Brigitte notices the rivulets of blood trickling down Ginger's arms
Ginger's shirt is soaking with growing red stains
Ginger, shit
Ginger looks at herself
Ginger starts to cry
The fuck was that, Bee
- Brigitte flings open the vanity and collects various first aid items: gauze, tape, band-aids, iodine
She snags a washcloth and wets it at the tap
(/) couldn't remember Ginger crying, ever
Brigitte flies out to, - where Ginger is painfully pealing off her shirt, shaking and sobbing
Brigitte offers Ginger the wet cloth, but Ginger's helpless
27 Ginger, sshhh, don't, 'kay
Don't cry
Carefully, Brigitte begins to dab at Ginger's arms with it, wiping off the blood
Ginger flinches
The damage is gradually revealed: massive claw marks, deep scratches, and puncture wounds -
Brigitte's eyes fill with tears
Okay, this is really bad

Not tellin' anybody
Bee
Nobody
Get in shit for bein' out, smokin' up - don't tell
What if you get, sick

Bce
Fine
won't tell
Brigitte starts tearing off strips of gauze and taping it on thick
Oblivious, Ginger fumbles for a smoke
She can't get the lighter to work
Wanted to kill me
could tell

was so scared, thought you were -/ Me too
Don't say it

Brigitte lights her smoke for her
Ginger takes a drag and passes it back to Brigitte
Fuck
You okay
Brigitte resumes her first aid
28 Yeah, 'm okay
Why
Why me
It was crazy, it was like rabid or somethin' -- Shit, look at the size of these bites
'm okay, 'm okay, 'm okay
Right
It's okay
Brigitte doesn't look convinced
Brigitte snaps the port of an internal vacuum system open and reaches into the tube
She withdraws a sample-size of Jack Daniels

It's really gross

Yeah, sure
Ginger's only half-bandaged up
she staggers to the bathroom and shuts the door
Brigitte eyes the Polaroid camera: a picture sits ready to be dispensed
She pulls it free
We do not see the photo
Brigitte's eyes bug out as she examines it
The toilet flushes in the bathroom and Brigitte pushes the photo under the pillow on her bed
Shaking her head
(/0) It was blurry
It was really outta focus, so
Ya couldn't it was really anything
Ginger emerges pulling uncomfortably at her crotch
she climbs painfully onto her bed, and collapses
That booze - straight to my head, man
You really okay

You saved me

Her pen hovers over the date: Halloween, arid the next full moon
The first day was a full moon
Brigitte slowly circles them both
Ginger wears long sleeves to hide her bandages, and shades
She's looking  up and down as they pass
Ginger's stomach is growling
An untouched sandwich sits on her lap
Gonna eat that
Ginger shakes her head as she picks at her bandages
Brigitte helps herself
Mmm
Sad, but Pamela's egg salad is her best thing
Like that she can do
(no response) Like, when she puts the baby onions in
(no response) And she gobs on it and adds those hard little pieces of Ginger pulls at her own crotch
31 Hell-o 1
Sorry
Pads suck, so ya know
Should eat something
Thanks Pamela, 'm aware
Off Brigitte's insulted look, dunno, 'm all blaaahh,  got this, like  can taste what want, but nothin's it
Ya know
Brigitte stops in mid-chew
craving
Yeah
crave
Ya know
Brigitte chews very slowly as she stares at Ginger
Ginger squints at Jason and his pals across the yard
McCardy's a stoner right
Yeah -
'mon,  wanna feel better
You joke
Ginger heads off toward the boys - without waiting
Brigitte is in mid-,mouthful, and has to scramble to catch up
/  - Jason and his pals' butcho conversation sputters as Ginger strides up like a cat in heat
Brigitte stumbles up behind her, keeping her distance
- /July 15, 1998 32 Uh - hi
Hey
So
Nice day, blah blah blah
Got any smoke
What
Smoke
Grass, weed, dope, green, bud, Nancy
Sh-sure
Wanna share
- Brigitte hesitates before a rusted-out old boogie van, it's rear door open and waiting
Blue smoke billows out
of the interior
Brigitte looks confused
(/) was all like, so who are you, an' what have you done with my sister, right
Brigitte climbs in
- Ginger, Jason, Tim, Frank and Jeremy sit toking a gagger
The guys are giddy with lust
Brigitte is huddled in a corner, attempting invisibility
Jason hands Ginger the joint, making sure their fingers touch
Hey
thought your slide show in art was cool
Oh yeah/Unh-huh/Very cool
Yeah
33 Jason and Ginger exchange a coy smile that makes Brigitte toke really hard on her pass
Brigitte passes the dube to Tim, who winks at her
Brigitte sneers and looks at her watch
She makes a pained face at Ginger, but is ignored
This home-grown
Yeah
This guy we know
Learned hydrophonics in the pen, man
HydroPONics
Yeah, whatever
Brigitte gapes at Ginger, who does not respond
Brigitte hides beneath her hair and presses even further into a corner
She starts quietly ripping up the corner of the old shag rug
There is a codified knock on the vain door
Brigitte jumps
speak of the devil
Enter
The back doors open and Sam (the tree planter) stands in silhouette, backlit by the day
His battered county truck waits behind him
He has a pit bull with him -
Sam the Man
Hey Morely
Sam and Morely hop in and close the doors
Brigitte is frozen at the sight of Sam up so close
Whoa dude
What happened to your truck
Shit
Had an accident on the 403
It was weird it
/ Morely stomps into Brigitte's lap, sniffing her crotch
34 (to Brigitte) Sorry about him, he's an ass hole
Morely
My girlfriend's, she won't leave him at home alone any more
Ya know, dog killers
Morely, no
Sit
Brigitte's mouth is hanging open
Morely slobbers all over her hands
(/) know,  look like an asshole
Ginger's perma-smug smile fades as she makes eye contact with Morely
Morel growls at her
Sam is about to resume his accident story when, Watcha got for us
Sam produces several baggies of grass
Morely's hackles rise
Brigitte looks from the dog to Ginger, Ginger squirms
New harvest, see whatcha think
(to Morely) What's your problem
Never seen a pretty girl before
Ginger sneers at Morely and Morely bares his teeth
// (digging out cash) Thanks, man
Morely bursts out barking and charges at Ginger
Mayhem as the guys try to contain the dog in the small space
Jason uses the opportunity to shield Ginger for a free body press
Brigitte gets banged and shoved
Ginger kicks and screams at the dog, her boot connects squarely with his snout
Morely keels back, and Sam snaps him up
Sorry, he's not really like this
'm really sorry
Jus' get'im out
35 'm really - well, see you guys
And in another flash of daylight, Sam and Morely are gone
Brigitte looks longingly at the closed door
The stone has set in, and everyone but Brigitte giggles as they settle
Brigitte takes in the Lesser Mortals like they're lepers
You okay
Yeah
Just hate dogs
They give one another this corny smile
Brigitte bugs her eyes at Ginger
Ginger rises reluctantly
Well
Thanks for the smoke
Maybe we could --/ Ginger places a finger to her lips, then makes a finger gun and shoots him
'll letcha know
Ginger grins ear-to-ear, elbowing Brigitte
Ginger kicks the van doors open and saunters out
Brigitte :Follows, trying not to laugh
- Brigitte stands stoned out of her bean in the girls' washroom
She imitates Ginger's cavalier farewell from the last scene
'll letcha, 'll jus' let-choo know
Bud
So Ginger
Wanna tell me about you and like, the planet yer currently visiting
No answer
Brigitte squints at the tampon dispenser next to her
She tries to work it without putting money in
She smacks her dry lips
Brigitte bends over the sink and drinks from the tap
- /July 15, 1996 36 (/) Bee-
Brigitte doesn't hear her over the roar of the tap in her face
It shuts off automatically over her gaping mouth
Brigitte puts her finger up the spout and almost gets it stuck
Bee
() Yeah
Com'ere-
Brigitte shuffles to the wrong door, opens it and finds it empty
She giggles and moves to the next one
That smoke fucked me _up
_ up
Brigitte finds Ginger with her shirt and all, the bandages peeled off
she is dabbing at herself with wads of toilet paper
The scratches and bites are oozing a clear gelatinous goo, under which a fine film of dark hairs have sprouted
Brigitte steps into the stall agape
The door hits her on the way in
- Ginger and Brigitte stand nose to nose in the stall
Brigitte has not fully closed the door
Ginger is just as stoned as Brigitte
Geez that's not right
1 didn't think
What's the sticky stuff
dunno
- /July 15, 1996 37 Brigitte carefully rubs a finger over the fuzzy hair in the wounds
Oooh
Tickly
got it on my tits too, look
Weird
Does it hurt
No, it's itchy
can't have a hairy chest Bee, that's fucked
Yeah, like forget that tattoo you wanned
This sucks
Quito badly
The idiocy of the looks of awe on the other's face makes them both crack up
() This isn't funny
(laughing hard) know, but okay
what  think
(she counts on her ) Attacked
On a full moon
Now, yer hairy
() 'm not Harry, 'm Ginger
(snorting too) Stop, 'm serious
Think about it
Ginger stops laughing long enough to let the suggestion settle
38 That's so stupid
They both burst into gales again
There is a sound outside the stall, as - The Trinas prance in to powder their noses
The Trina grabs the first stall door -- Brigitte and Ginger's
Brigitte and Ginger stand frozen like the proverbial deer in headlights
Trina does not see Ginger's transformation
But Ginger Is just doing her top up
Eeeew
Trina backs away, her hands to her mouth
Gawd: They're lesbos
Feeeewww
Brigitte smacks her forehead
Ginger steps out and leers at Trina, licking her lips in a grotesque mock-lust
The Trinas shrink back against the farthest wall
Yeah, who's next
'm still sticky
Brigitte's jaw drops
Ginger turns to leave and the Trinas, start to relax
Ginger whips around again: (barking like a dog) Rrr-uf, ruf, rr-of-rufrf () Ginger gives the Trinas a good dead-eyed stave, and walks out
Brigitte stumbles out after her
39 - Today's assignment is hacking up little pig feti
(/) 'Course Trina din't waste any time
Trina stares Brigitte down as she folds up a note and passes it to a classmate
It is read and passed on by every kid in the room during this scene
Brigitte holds her scalpel over the over their piggy - hesitating
Ginger's attention is riveted on the little carcass
They're all looking at us
So
Ginger looks up at Jason, who is reading the note
Jason smiles at Ginger and destroys the note
Trina seethes
Ginger grabs the knife from Brigitte
she makes a deep incision in the pig's belly
So
You're growing fur an, acting like a nut, is so
Ginger spies two girls giggling at her
Using both hands Ginger cracks the carcass
wide open like a clam
Ginger digs in, gouging out the pig's parts with her bare hands
Ginger breaks into a sweat, her breathing gets heavy
Brigitte cautiously looks around at their classmates
she moves to shield Ginger from prying eyes
Um
Ginger-
hold on, 'm goi
n' for the brain
Ginger has begun scraping away at the pig's cranium with her finger nails
sickening creak, snap, and the brain is exposed
Ginger - unconsciously - licks her fingers as she admires its frontal lobe
40 Brigitte fights a ralph
Can't believe you did that
Hunh
What
Before Brigitte can answer, Ginger lifts the brain out on her finger tips, gently pushes Brigitte out of her way and
Whap
The brain lands squarely on Trina's head
Trina screams
Ha-ha
Bull's eye
Ginger Fitzgerald
Hall,
What, it slipped
As Ginger stomps out with the teacher
Brigitte and Trina gape at one another
'   - (/) That week, Ginger was all over the map
She was the goddamn schizo poster girl
She forgot the gyno guy
couldn't believe she forgot
She promised
Brigitte is dying a thousand deaths on the examining table with her feet in stirrups
The  is examining her
stands next to him, smiling benignly as she passes him the contraption used to take a pap smear
Brigitte is almost in tears
: Same moment in the examination procedure, but now Ginger is in the stirrups
And the doctor is shocked at his findings
What the -
41 - Brigitte gives Ginger a pout as they both shift uncomfortably in their seats
The doctor is gulping cups of water from the water cooler, his hand shaking
He talks to Pamela like the girls aren't even there
've never seen anything like it
She's not built like a normal girl
've sent samples to the lab
But this is very, unusual
Brigitte pokes Ginger in the ribs
Ginger doesn't like this, and pushes Brigitte so hard she almost falls off her chair
Girls, please
'  - The window is open
Norman the terrier yams
Ginger is in a tank shirt which reveals her hair growth is spreading
Brigitte is sitting at
the desk with a pile of monster books
What're you, nuts
got a skin thing, whatever
If you just gotta skin thing why does it get worse everytime yer being a bitch
Why's the gyno say you're a monster inside
He din't say that
Just listen to these symptoms
'm takin' a shower
42 Ginger slams the bathroom door shut
Brigitte consults her books, and the feminine hygiene calendar 10 days are ticked off
Norman the terrier barks on
(/0) () "The key to his survival is a constant diet of fresh warm- blooded victims
His appetite is insatiable, and grows with each kill
But his appetite is also the key to his own demise, '   - / Ginger is in the shower
she runs shaking hands over her body
Ginger hears Norman's barking as super-amplified
Its persistence is making her mental
(/0 - ') "
for eventually the blood- lust over-takes human reason, overtakes oven the instinct for self-preservation, and he will risk all for the excitement of the euphoric high of his murders
" Ginger shaves the delicate area around her ankles
She cuts herself and freaks
Ginger snaps the Lady Bic in half and throws the pieces hard against the shower wall
Fuck fuck fuck There are two other broken razors in the stall, stuffed with hairs
Blood mixes with the water and swirls around her toes
'  - The doq is still barkin
outside
Brigitte closes her book
(/0) But see all the books and movies an' shit said it had to be a full moon, that it'd be all at once
An, ya know, not one word about chick werewolves on the rag
Typical
43 Ginger flings open the door, tears to the window, hauls herself out and is gone
Brigitte is after her in a heart beat
- Ginger is over the fence with ease
Norman barks more, harder
- / Brigitte can't vault the fence
She clambers up a shared tree at the fence line to see
Ginger tries to grab the dog but he dances around her, barking like crazy
She grabs his snout with her bare hands and he bites her hard
Sonnovabitch
Now livid, Ginger takes up a dead tree branch
Up in the tree, Brigitte hides her face in her hands
Ginger (:racks the stick over the dog's head
The yelping stops but Ginger keeps hitting
Blood splatters over her face
And Ginger tastes it
Ginger drops her stick
She drags the body into the hedge next to the fence
Brigitte lowers her hands from her eyes
Ginger is directly below her, concealed from the house by the shrubs
Ginger falls to her knees before the corpse
She lifts a rattling hand to touch him
She lowers her face to the bloody mess
She's sweating, vibrating, physically resisting an irresistible drive
Ginger's tongue slips between her lips
And Ginger licks Morely's body
Oh
No
-ginger -
Ginger begins to eat the dead dog
The feed
quickly becomes a ravenous frenzy
Above her, Brigitte leans over the branch she's barely balancing on, hyperventilating
Vomit sails down from Brigitte's perch
- /July 15, 1996 44 The porch light comes on behind Ginger
Shit
Brigitte scrambles down the tree and yanks Ginger off the dog
Ginger's face is smeared in blood
Ginger's stunned, and reels dizzily
They crouch, waiting
Their  opens the screen door, shaking a box of dog biscuits
Dore-maan
Tweat-time
Hunh
The neighbor steps into the yard
Approaches the hedge
Stops right before them - they can see a pair of slippers twitching in the grass
Then they disappear, the porch light switches off, the screen door shuts
'  - Brigitte sits staring into space
Ginger is showering in the attached bath
(/) () Ho-ow much is that daw-gy in the window
Arf-Arf
(/) Ever been too sick to be sick
Like the bottom of your stomach is wrapped over the top of your head
There is a knock at the door
Brigitte checks the dead bolt is on
Yeah
(/) Who's showering so late
Ginger
(/) Why
45 she's dirty
Brigitte throws up her hands: what an idiotic conversation
(01S) Dirty
How'd she get/ 'm tryin' to study, here
(01S) oh, all right then
Brigitte slumps against the door
The showers stops
Ginger appears in a towel, pink and clean and freshly furry in places
She's in a really good mood
She takes one look at Brigitte's face of doom and tries to be serious
couldn't help it
Really
Guess you were right
Ginger finds and lights a smoke
You know what's really weird
Weirder than liked it
liked it a lot feel all fucki
n' goofy now
Like,  dunno
Like
happy
Brigitte shakes her head over and over
feel like  just got off the Planet Smasher ride at WarWorid, okay
It rules
Ginger leaps to the stereo and blasts on some tunes
She flails around the room wildly
Ginger grabs Brigitte by the arms and makes her dance too
Ginger spins and spins Brigitte, who fights it but laughs
46 (/) So she'd killed Norman
1 never seen anyone bliss out like that
wanted to be so blissed, jus' once
There is repeated pounding on their door
Brigitte still entangled in Ginger, hits the music off
(/) Little late for that, girls
/ (Bite me:)/Sorry; They stand in each other's arms listening to Pamela mount the stairs
Ginger shoves Brigitte backward onto her bed
Ginger piles on top of her, playfully pinning her down
want more
Brigitte squirms fitfully
No, it's too gross
You'll get caught
Not if you help
Bee
'm starving
Brigitte looks into her sister's beaming face
Jus' keep watch
Look, 'm gonna be somethin' totally else
Tell me you don't so dig it
Tell me you don't wanna see what happens
Brigitte groans
(/) Straight up
Crazy's contagious
Trust me
47 &  - Bailey Downs sleeps soundly as the hunt begins
The moon is a sliver of its former self
Ginger cocks her head at the sound of a dog barking
She lifts her nose into the wind and sniffs
Ginger is prowls like a wild cat through yards and service lanes, as study in much less stealth, Brigitte stumbles, trips and slips after Ginger
Splits her sweats climbing fences
Loses a shoe over garage roofs, gets caught in automated lawn sprinklers, falls into hidden cellar window troughs, as series of dogs perk their ears and snarl from their dog houses, chains, and porch perches
Low whistles and smoochy sounds lure the dogs into bushes, behind cars, around fences
Strings of dogs' chains strain tight, then slacken
Ginger - wild-eyed, bloody-mouthed, and euphoric - tosses collars at Brigitte
Brigitte misses most of the tosses
She picks up the collars and fingers these souvenirs with disgust
: - decked out for hockey practice waddles into his yard with a full dog food dish
His feet squish along his pet's entrails
He finds his dog's body and drops the dish with a clatter on the cement patio
-m-mMOMI
: Days get ticked off on the feminine hygiene calendar
(Vb0) We became the Beast of Bailey Downs
We got good
The moon vanishes, then reappears in as a First Quarter, as Brigitte's getting the hang of things, she practices expert surveillance from car roofs, throws stones to trip motion- sensitive lamps, starts moving like a super spy, taking crime-scene style Polaroids of their victims, as 48 Ginger's kills get quicker, she gets wilder, more daring, more ruthless, and
Brigitte gets cooler, confident, collected
She's mapping out attack routes and leading the frothing Ginger to the big scores, like dog kennels
(/) The more we did, the crazier she got
- Under a swelling moon Brigitte and Ginger tear around in the dark, screaming and laughing and rough-housing
: '  - Brigitte shoves a fist-full of collars under their mattresses
: On the field, Ginger climbs up on the goal post and walks carefully across the narrow beam
: (/) The crazier she got, the more she needed me
liked that part
In their room, Brigitte helps Ginger shave her back
Ginger trims her elongating nails
Brigitte plucks hairs from Ginger's palms
Ginger brushes her teeth and a piece of tooth comes off - she has a little fang
: on the field both Brigitte and Ginger hang upside down from the goal post by their knees
Brigitte is wearing a dog collar as a necklace
They are laughing their heads off and trying to pull each other's shirts down to expose each other's breasts
- /July 15, 1996 49 '  - Ginger holds her mattress up while Brigitte stuffs handfuls of the collars underneath
They collapse, exhausted
Ginger crawls on her hands and knees to the toilet in the - Ginger drinks out of the toilet like a dog
'  - / Ginger burps loudly and crawls back to join her sister, who offers her a cigarette
Pig
You love it
Brigitte examines the feminine hygiene calendar
In it, a cartoon of a female egg is personified with a heels and sunglasses, strutting across the date
trey, look yer ovulating
Ginger rubs her belly
'm still hungry, Bee
How can you - you've done every dog we can It's not enough
want somethin'
need more
- All the kids lounging on the grounds double-take the Fitzgerald girls' entrance this morning
Ginger is babe-alicious in a hot tiny tee, boots, shades and very short shorts
She projects unbearably untouchable
Brigitte flanks her without the wardrobe, but the attitude is there
- Jason gapes as Ginger heads toward him with an unlit smoke between her pointy teeth
She leaves an inch between his chest and her breasts
Got a light, Jace'
Jason and his pals all fumble for lighters and five little flames appear before her smoke
She lights her smoke on Jason's, and exhaling looks him up and down
The boys flames go out, all at once
My sister would like one also
obediently, they all light up for Brigitte
Brigitte falters before the attention
At Ginger's nod, Brigitte lights up too
(O1S) Slut
Ginger turns to see Trina and the Clones sizing her up
Excuse me
Ginger seems to tower over the Trinas today
Trina can't match the menace
Ginger exhales smoke in Trinals face and climbs the steps into the school
Brigitte double-takes Ginger's back
Ginger's spine is protruding sharply through her shirt
Trina leers at Brigitte
Better watch your back, Fitzenstein
Brigitte snorts and follows Ginger in
(under her breath) Like 'm scared
- Ginger chews her nails like a dog does when cleaning them
Brigitte and the rest of the class watch an holding a reward poster at the front of the room
51 we need your cooperation
If you know anything about the so- called Beast of Bailey Downs, call in
You can be anonymous
(/) Ha
As if they weren't already
(') But your pets aren't safe until the perpetrator is caught
Ginger sighs loudly and Brigitte prods her
- The girls' gym class is prepping for lacrosse again
The Trinas square off across the half-way mark from Ginger
Mz
Sykes blows her whistle
The scrimmage begins
Trina whips the Indian rubber ball right into Ginger's face
Ginger drops her stick and launches herself at Trina
Play stops with the whistle, but Ginger and Trina are just going at it
Ginger's winning
Trina bites Ginger's sore arm and Ginger rakes her nails over Trina's neck
Ginger draws blood
Mz
Sykes breaks it up by dragging Ginger off Trina
Sykes tends to Triria, who bawls
Ginger wipes her bloody hand over her mouth
Ginger
Ginger's rolling the taste of Trina's blood around in her mouth
Mmnun
You can't do that, That's human blood
Feel anything
Brigitte and Ginger stare at one another
Ginger first shakes her head
, but then nods
Ginger looks around and whispers - /July 15, 1996 52 It's sick but - 'm all like horny
Brigitte makes a sour face
Fitzgerald, bench
What, she started it
Brigitte watches Ginger march to the sidelines, throwing off her gear as she goes
Pick that stuff up
Ginger gives Sykes the finger without looking back
Brigitte groans
- Brigitte waits outside a door marked
Trina struggles by with the help of her clones
Trina sports a big ugly bandage on her neck, knees and an arm in a sling
She shoots Brigitte a Death Stare
Yer bitch sister's dead, freak
(under her breath) Fuck off
Jason lopes up
He indicates the guidance office door
Ginger in there again
Brigitte ignores him
Cool
Um
Look, Belinda
Brigitte
Right, right

Think you could ask her for me
53 Brigitte' s face clouds
Hey

Brigitte seethes
Fuck
Never mind, 'll ask her myself
(under his breath) Freak
Jason takes a post on the opposite Brigitte to wait
Brigitte glares at him
- The grossly over-weight guidance councilor,
, is perched on the edge of his fake wood desk, holding their death slides (from the credit sequence) up to the fluorescent light
His arm pits are stained with sweat
Ginger slumps in a chair before him
There is a fish bowl full of condoms on his desk
Ginger picks one out, unwrapping it, examining it as he talks
Look, you keep getting sent here
We might as well be friendly
don't do friendly, Mr
Wayne
Hey
know where you're coming from
was a kid once too
Really
So was
Weird
Ginger fakes an eye-lash batting smile
She winds the condom over her erect fingers
Okay, you aren't a kid
You're a young adult
With some issues
Let's explore them
- /July 15, 1996 54 Ginger rubs the condom's lubricant between her two free fingers, intrigued by the texture
Hey

Your plays for attention are a cry for help, aren't they
Uh, no
Is it a problem at home
With your parents
They think 'm cute
Mr
Wayne sighs
Maybe  ought to split you and your sister up
Aw, c'mon Mr
Wa-ayne
Divide aii' conquer
That's so old
Hey
You're antisocial, antagonistic, and now violent
The point of high school is you learn to develop a place for yourselves in society
/ 'Long as you like it
As long as you're at this school young lady,  better like it
Ginger gives him a cold, dead stare
consider this your final warning
see you outta line again, and we're talking expulsion
And don't look at me like that, missy
55 - Ginger slams the Guidance office door on her way out
Fuckin' guidance my ass
She pounds her fist into a locker and makes a dent
Brigitte cringes
Ginger admires the damage
Holy
Ginger notices Jason and visibly brightens
Hey
Hey
whatcha doin' now
Nothin' special
Wanna go for a ride
Sure
'mon Bee
Jason and Brigitte's faces darken simultaneously
Ginger, we should get home
No we shouldn't
Brigitte drags Ginger aside
Ginger notes Brigitte's hand squeezing her arm with a dangerous look
Twenty minutes ago you coulda killed somebody
Is this really a good time to start dating don't think so
Ginger shakes Brigitte's hand off
Well,  do
56 Why
Why
Look, grow up a little an' maybe you'll get it What
Forget it, 'm goin'
'll draw ya a picture later, 'kay
Ginger takes Jason's hand and pulls him off to the exit
Jason gives Brigitte  a smug look over his shoulder
Brigitte stands alone in the hall, gaping after them

Well, he rammed iue with this beam, right in my stomach
Accidentally
Brigitte wanders over the emptying school

She looks small and alone

('-/0) But all the air came outta my lungs at once an,  kept tryin' to breathe but  couldn't forgot all about that
Till like right now
Brigitte consults the hygiene calendar
Ginger's ending the third week of checked-off days

Crickets sing
The moon is rising

They're making out
Ginger is enjoying herself
Ginger bites his lip
Ginger draws blood
Ouch
whoa
Can't believe you never had a boyfriend
Ginger licks his blood from her own lips and freezes dead cold
Jason dives back at her for more
Ginger looks both aroused and unnerved by her arousal
Ginger's stomach growls
Ginger pushes Jason off of her

It's getting late
It's only six o'clock
Jason presses himself on her again
Ginger shoves him off, hard
1-have-to-go
Oh
Now you get all moody on me
Hey_ You got no idea

(/) Chicks, yer all the same
Ginger stops in her tracks
She shakes her head and continues away
(/) Cock tease
- Brigitte shuffles along the curb, the picture of dejection
She slows to watch Sam loading some enormous tree branches into the back of his truck, packing up for the night: lie has 58 been cutting back an enormous tree in someone's front yard
when Sam glances her way, Brigitte picks up her pace without looking back
- Trina wears a radio headset that pounds post-disco dance mix as she jogs
Morely dashes in and out of the surrounding greenery
He dashes in once more, and does not reappear
Trina looks back expectantly
She runs in place, waiting for him
She heads back, looking for him
Ginger pops out of the brush before Trina
Gingers face smeared with blood from Mo
rely
Ginger grins insanely
Ginger wiggles Morely's collar
Trina clicks off her head set
Hi
- Brigitte descends the stairs to her room
Music blasts from the basement
(/) Brigitte
Tell your sister to turn that stereo down
'  -- Brigitte lets herself in
The music is now deafening
Trina is bound in a chair at the end of her bed, screaming her head off
Her screams are buried by the music
Brigitte slams and locks the door behind her
(yelling over noise) Stop screaming or 'll rip your permed head right off you neck
An' ya know what
can do that
Now open wide Ginger force-feeds Trina something on a spoon
Trina screams with her mouth full, trying to spit it back out
Ginger offers Trina a glass of milk
Chaser
No
-/July 15, 1996 59 Blood trickles out of the corners of Trinas mouth as she chews while bawling
Ginger sets the glass of milk on the desk
Ginger  are you doing-
Ginger grins and shows Bee a bowl of crushed glass and tacks
Jus' like you said, Bee
' perfect
Brigitte grabs the bowl away: glass shards and tacks rain around them
Are you crazy
Hey
'm Join' this for you
As the sisters argue, Trina rocks the chair back and forth, trying to free herself
Oh no, no way
No
Yer still burnt over Jason
No, Ginger, 'm burnt 'cause you don't see like jail in yer future
You don't get how hugely fucked this is
you
Trina lurches back hard and rocks forward
Trina struggles to get her toes to meet the floor
She lurches back for more momentum
You sayin' 'm stupid
'm sayin' she
Will tell on you
This is someone who will tell
Trina throws herself forward again and her toes connect firmly with the floor - just as her temple connects with a sickening  on the sharp corner of the desk
The milk glass dumps on top of her
60 Brigitte and Ginger look at her
Trina hangs there in the chair at this strange angle for a moment, dripping milk
Then Trina and the chair keel to the floor
Trina is still
Brigitte turns the music off and creeps up to Trina
Blood trickles out of Trina's ear and swirls into the milky glass mess at her mouth
Her open eyes stare at nothing
She's dead
Ha-ha
Ginger grabs her own right arm (most damaged by the original attack) and shudders with pain
Ow
Ow
Owchee-wow-ow
Brigitte takes Trina in from head to toe
Brigitte checks Trina for a pulse
Brigitte snaps her hand back as though it were burned
tremor wracks Brigitte's body and she convulses
Brigitte runs to the bathroom
, Brigitte throws up
Meanwhile Ginger raises her afflicted hand
The hand is nowsomething clearly on the way to being a wolfen paw
The nails are black, curling claws
Oblivious, Brigitte climbs back into bed and covers her face with a pillow
My life is basically over
Bee
Awestruck, they both watch as Ginger extends and retracts her: new set of claws
There is a knock at the door
The girls look at one another in mute horror
Ginger addresses the door
What
(/) Are you two fighting
-- No
-/July 15
1996 61 (/) come on then
Dinner's ready
Brigitte and Ginger hop up and down in a brief freak fit
(/) Coming
- Ginger has her new paw curled up in an over-sized sweat jacket sleeve
Brigitte stares at the stew before them with grave distaste
Pamela has a number of used tissues around her - she's been crying
The gynecologist called
Pamela grasps Ginger's gnarly arm and squeezes it through her sleeve
Brigitte and Ginger look at Pamela's hand
There's something wrong, Ginger
He wants to do an ultra-sound
Pamela, don't scare her
How could the cells not be human cells
we'll send you to somebody else
'm sure your father's right
'm just upset
How are you feeling, do you feel
all right
Um
sure
Fine
(lowering her voice) No unusual discharge or anything like that
Henry, Brigitte and Ginger groan
worry, all right
've made another appointment with a new doctor
Early next month was the earliest he could see you
okay
62 okay
They all begin eating in silence
Except Brigitte who gags as Henry squirts ketchup all over his stew
'  - Trina's body is wrapped in a bedspread and stuffed in a kid's wagon
Brigitte is keeping a look out looking pale and sickened
Grass and dirt spray out of the playhouse
Ginger is digging up the ground inside doggie style
She emerges, shaking the turf out of her new paw
They struggle to get Trina inside, but she's already too stiff to bend up
Told you
Rigor mortis
Knew we shoulda skipped dinner
Can we do it my way now
Brigitte hesitates, her anxieties rising
So is this it
You doin' people now
She won't fit unless You know what  mean
Just say
din't kill her
But were you gonna
There is a long pause
Ginger tries to laugh it off with, No
'm not doing people
No
Brigitte takes a deep breath, nodding
She acts belief
63 'Kay
Hurry up
Ginger drags a section of the body into the playhouse with her
Disgusting gnashing and tearing, bones snapping and other sounds of devouring are heard from within
Brigitte keeps watch
Tears appear in her eyes
The body is dragged another foot into the playhouse
Ginger is eating Trina to make her fit in the grave
(/) Trina was dead
Trina was dinner
This was
An' kept wonderin' what Sam was doin' right then
couldn't help it, he jus' kept poppin' into my head, like
-  - Brigitte lifts the lid of a large freezer Its light illuminates the brown paper parcels Ginger sets inside, next to the frozen waffles and veggies
The parcels are labeled -bone, -thigh, -breast
(/0) What Ginger couldn't finish we froze, 'cause the less we left for whoever would find Trina, the better
Watch a lot of crime , so
Brigitte's sizing Ginger up behind her back
Ginger finishes loading the freezer
Brigitte drops the lid
'  -- The room is dark
Ginger is asleep
Brigitte is in bed with her back turned to Ginger's bed
Brigitte has a penlight on a collection of open monster books
She is examining a sketch of a plant with yellow flowers
64 (/) () "The Beast was usually finally eliminated with a bullet, the cost of breaking the curse the human life that bore it
,, oh man
"However many believed wolfs bane (see Diagram, right) had the power not only to protect the innocent, but calmed those afflicted to a restored sense of reason and self- control
" (/) What:cha Join'
Brigitte nearly jumps into orbit, slamming her book shut as Ginger appears over her shoulder
Hm
Big Book of Monsters, hunh
Thought they were useless
They are
Couldn't sleep
So
Rrigitte gives Ginger a nervous smile
Ginger smiles back
Her fangs show
'  - Their alarm clock goes off reading 8:00
Ginger's paw comes down hard on it, cracking the plastic casing
Brigitte is already up
She sweeps up the glass mess from the night before
Ginger rolls out of bed, steps over Brigitte and stumbles to the bathroom
Ginger steps on tacks and doesn't even react
Man, 'm not getting enough sleep
Ginger closes the bathroom door
Brigitte leaps to the door, looping one end of a noosed extension cord around the handle
The other end is tied to the door handle of the bedroom door
Brigitte checks to ensure the latter is bolted shut
65 -, the toilet flushes
-, Ginger tries to open the door
She can't
(/) The fuck -
Beef Brigitte watches the vibrating length of cord hold the door firmly in place
Ginger bangs hard on the door
Ginger, don't be pissed
Open the fuckin' door you feeb
No
Ginger pounds on the door with great violence
( '
Want Pamela dc h, e
The pounding Sto2s
We have to stop it Ginge'
If we can
`ll be back before dark
Brigitte tears the page with the plant out of her book and leaves by the window
(/) Told Pammy Ginger wasn't feeling well
Just to get her checkin' regular on
her, keep the pressure on Ginger to be cool
- Brigitte steps off a county bus at the drive
There's a police car parked next to the Sam's truck
She looks back to the bus, but the doors swing shut and it pulls away
Brigitte smoothes her hair, takes a deep breath, and over- acts innocent as she walks up
66 - Brigitte can hear male voices as she minces down the leafy aisles
(/) It's in your best interests to be cooperative
(/) My lawyer's co-operative,  just know my rights
don't know where she is, 'm very concerned
That's it, unless you got a warrant
She ends up backing into a  behind some palms
Shhh-it
mean, sorry
(to cop) You can see  got customers, so if that's all
Okay
Sure
For now
The cop gives Sam a final Dirty Harry squint and leaves
Sam collects himself with difficulty
So does Brigitte
if you skipped school lookin' to score,  don't keep nothin' here at work, sweetheart
din't
mean  skipped, but-/ Hey
From Mccardy's van, right
You know my girlfriend
Trina Sinclair
Rinda
You seen her today
-
/July 15, 1996 67 Not today
Fuck
She's missing
Oh
-sorry
Yeah, well
Cops think  know where she is
don't
Sam looks Brigitte right in the eye
Brigitte is caught up in him for a second
Sorry, what do you care right
What do you need
Um
Lookin' for this
She holds out the torn page
Sam takes it
Aconitum lycoctonum
Sorry
Brigitte yanks her own hair hard
Sam smiles
Tryin' to kill somebody
(off her look) Well, you know it's poisonous, right
Wolfs bane
Deadly
Be like stocking hemlock an, shit
No,  thought it did something else
Doesn't matter
Anyways they're perennials - only flowers in spring
Brigitte turns to leave, hot with frustration, huinilliation
Sam watches her stamp toward the door
Hey
Ranunculaceae come in about a hundred species
've gotta cousin, monkshood
Not so toxic
If you're interested
66 Brigitte stops and considers him
Don't know if it'd help
-- They sit together amidst beautiful plants and flowers
Sam
picks a tiny purple flower from a bed of young plants and hands it to Brigitte
'called monkshood 'cause people used to think it kept 'em pure from dirty thoughts
Seriously
() Make my life easier
Sam laughs
Surprised by this, Brigitte smiles and hides under her hair
(/) This is awful
but the whole time was with him there
din't even think how 'd just put pieces of his girlfriend in the deep freeze, like, at all
'  - Ginger pulls with all
her might to get the door open a few inches
The door knobs on both doors are straining
Something starts to crack
With ferocious effort, Ginger contorts herself through two inches of space
The cracking is coming from Ginger as she squeezes her body bizarre-ly out of joint, as a contortionist might
Once through, she snaps and clicks her distended bones back in place
She gasps for breath
Her face is distorted with murderous fury
There is a knock on the bedroom door
(/) Ginger, feeling any better
Ginger climbs noiselessly out of the window
69 (/s) Ginger
You sleeping
God, hate this lock,  know it's- privacy but what if you were in trouble in there for god's sake
- Brigitte stands at her on locker, tying a rubber band around stalks of the monkshood
There is a goofy half-smile on her face, and she's humming
(/) The book said dry it out before using it
figured 'd keep Ginger locked up - feeding her Trina - till it was ready
she hangs the monkshood upside down in the locker
The buzzer goes as she slams the door shut
- Ginger stalks past the neighbor's yard with the playhouse where Trina is buried
- new puppy romps
He sniffs around the edge of the playhouse
He smells something
He starts to whine and dig
- Ginger stomps the deserted halls, with their class schedule in hand
Classes are in session
fat silhouette appears-at the end of the corridor
Fitzgerald
Tardy
My office Ginger faces him with a dreadful expression
70 - Brigitte slumps in her seat doodling
The  officer is back, speaking to the class
The poster this time has a class photo of Trina
If any of you have seen Trina please let us know
She went for a run this morning and has not returned or contacted her family or friends
- Ginger stands imposingly over Mr
Wayne in his chair
Sit down, Ginger
can't stay
: said, sit
An'  said
/ (cutting her off) You are expelled
This is not your personal playground, this is a school
Oh dear
--    / Ginger's good hand lifts the telephone receiver on Mr
Wayne's desk
With her wolfen paw she dials
In the background we see blood splattered over the walls
71 (/) (imitating Pamela) Hello, main office
This is Mrs
Fitzgerald
would you page my daughter Brigitte please
'm waiting to meet her in the guidance office
Thank you so much
- Brigitte catches herself writing Sam's name on her binder
She scribbles it out, looking very guilty
(/) Would Brigitte Fitzgerald please report to guidance
Brigitte Fitzgerald
Brigitte freezes
The cop, the teacher, the whole class look at her
Brigitte scoops up her stuff
-- Brigitte reaches the door and finds it locked
The door opens a crack and Ginger's transformed arm grabs Brig
iLLe, hauling her inside
The door slams shut and locks
- Don't ever fuck with me like that again
You
got out
Brigitte gapes at all the blood
Ginger is very agitated
He asked for it
Was gonna expel me
So
Backing away, Brigitte trips over Mr
Wayne's foot sticking out from under the desk
What do we do, Bee
What do we do
72 Brigitte sinks into a chair looking completely traumatized
Ginger hops about - charged by the kill
'mon we need a fuckin' plan here
The school bell goes off
Brigitte snaps out of her daze, reaches up and hits the light switch off
They now sit in virtual darkness
Last bell
wait till everyone goes
We'll stuff him someplace
Clean this up
guess
The sound of the full halls around them seems very loud now
Bee, gotta a smoke
Brigitte hands her a smoke
Sorry about this
Whatever
Don't be mad, ' kay
'm not mad
- The school is deserted
The lock pops on the Guidance door and Brigitte and Ginger peer out
Nobody
Stay here
Lock the door
'll knock once
Ginger nods
Brigitte slips out and creeps down the corridor
Ginger shuts the door
Then Ginger whips it open again
Shut the door, Ginger
73 Bee
Thanks
Brigitte blinks at her, then continues to skulk away
The office door shuts and the lock locking reverbs after her
- Brigitte walks fast, looking for a place for the body
She looks inside full garbage cans and sizes them up
Too small
She looks up at a loose ceiling panel
She jumps a few times trying to reach it
Too high
She gets an idea
Brigitte jogs past the sign directing us to gym
- pushes his cart toward the guidance office
He stops at another door, produces keys, and lets himself in
He returns with a trash can and empties into his bin
He replaces the can, closes the door and locks it
- Ginger, gnaws on Mr
Wayne's arm but really isn't enjoying it
She stops in mid-chew and listens
The janitor's footsteps approach: his cart wheels squeak - The janitor wheels up to the guidance office
He slides this key in the lock
- Ginger grips the door knob as best she can with her one good hand, her feet braced against the wall on either side
74 On the other side, the janitor tugs, and tugs again
Ginger's getting madder the more he persists
The janitor gives the door one last wrench and it flies open
- Brigitte wheels a large cloth cart full of basket balls around a corner
The janitor crawls toward her, his hands lifted to her for help, blood spurting from his slashed throat
He tries to cry out, but only makes a gurgling whistle, the air in his Qi s passing through blood
Ginger walks behind him as he crawls
Ginger applies her boot to his ass and makes him slip face first in his own gore
Ginger giggles
Ginger looks up and sees Brigitte gaping in utter revulsion at her
For a split second, Ginger stops cold
Ginger seems to falter before her sister's horror
Then, without breaking their locked gaze, without even seeming conscious she's doing it - Ginger steps on the man's fingers and breaks them with a series of snaps
Brigitte tries to pry her eyes away, but can't
Still staring at Brigitte, Ginger extends her claws
Ginger shakes her head, as if to say  can't help it
Ginger pounces on the man
Brigitte turns her face to the wall
The lanitor makes a final horrible noise
The halls fall silent
:
- as Brigitte stuffs Mr
Wayne into the gym basket and covers him with balls, Ginger runs madly up and down the halls screeching and whooping, slamming her monster arm into the lockers bashing them in
as Brigitte pushes the janitor's body into a ground level air Ginger breaks the fire extinguisher out of it's case and unleashes foam into the halls
-/July 15, 1996 75 Brigitte mops up the janitor's blood with his own cart stuff
The Guidance office is already clean
Ginger lifts the fire extinguisher over her head
She starts running with it toward through the frosted glass window of the main office with a triumphant war whoop
Brigitte steps between Ginger and her target
Move
Just stop
Enough, Ginger
Please
Please
Ginger throws the canister any way, forcing Brigitte to dive out of the way
Glass rains down over
Brigitte
Brigitte lifts her head in time to see Ginger burn down the hall looking for more mischief
Brigitte curls into a fetal position, burying her face in her lap and rocks herself
Brigitte sobs
- we hear Ginger cont
inuing her ram a e else where in the school
Brigitte wanders up to the janitor's cart, looking like a plane crash survivor - dazed and wretched
Brigitte picks up a bottle of cleaning fluid
She sniffs it
She closes her eyes and tips it back
She washes it around in her mouth and lifts her chin to swallow
She spews it into the air, the taste making her heave instinctively
she dry heaves a couple of times
She throws the bottle at the wall
- Exhausted, Brigitte trails Ginger who is tired too, and heading for the exit
They stop dead at the doors
- truck's headlights pin them in full view
Ginger rolls her sleeve down over her paw
Brigitte swoons as if she might black out on the spot
The truck's engine cuts and the doors slowly open
Well, well well
-/Jufy 15, 1996 76 Jason and his pals climb out of the van
They hold beer bottles: they have come here to drink
The fair sisters Fitzgerald
Hey

Tim cracks the door and takes a look inside
Holy shit - they trashed the place
The guys gawk: they are very impressed

You won't tell
Oh  might
No you won't
Ginger -

Jason gets the eager nod from his gang
Okay, let's go

So it's up to you
You stay quiet, you score

He extends his hand to shake on it
Linger shakes it awkwardly with her good hand
Brigitte thumps her head against the wall
'  - Ginger leans on the bathroom door, which is shut
78 'mon Bee
'  - Brigitte is sitting on the closed seat of the toilet trying to pull her hair out
Shut up, leave me alone
(/) It's not that big a deal
(/) How can you say that
Two people are dead because of you
Us
They pissed me off
Brigitte opens the bathroom door
Oh
Then they we asking for it
What about Jason an' them
Gonna kill 'em all when yer done, Ginger
'Cause you have to take yer clothes  for that shit, they wanna  yer  for that shit, you gonna let like five guys live to tell how they fucked the Beast a' Bailey Downs
That could annoy you too
Ginger prods a claw into Brigitte's chest, pinning her in place
Think yer sooo smart
think yer sooo jealous
Yeah, 'm jealous yer turning into a nympho
'm so jealous yer killing people who did never did nothing to you
Yeah Ginger
Sure
Oh, wow
79 Brigitte takes a deep breath, swallows hard
don't wanna do this any more
Ginger's claw pricks Brigitte's skin
Brigitte cringes
Blood appears around the claw
What
'm sorry, but
Brigitte writhes in pain as Ginger's claw slices in deeper
Ginger
This is me
Ginger retracts the claw, and Brigitte grabs the wound
Ginger hurls Brigitte against the wall
Ginger throws herself on top of Brigitte
Ginger raises her killing claw to Bri g
iLt
e' s neck
Who needs you
Brigitte is helpless and looks terrified
Ginger's face is contorted with intensity, with madness
Ginger's drooling drip of gob drops onto Brigitte's face
(very small, ) Ginger
Ginger lifts Brigitte by the shirt-front and searches her eyes
Ginger drops Brigitte to the floor and grabs her coat
Brigitte grabs Ginger's leg
Don't, please
Brigitte struggles to hang on, to rise from the floor; Ginger's really hurt her
Maybe we can stop it
Lemme try
Ginger kicks free
80 An' spoil my fun
'll skin you alive first
Brigitte struggles to a point between Ginger and the window
You're fucked without me
They'll catch you
Wake up
No, you wake up
Nobody'll live to catch me
Yer a two-faced lil' chicken shit
Your problem, Brigitte
don't need ya don't
So stay away from me or 'll kill you  swear 'll have you for breakfast
Brigitte backs out of Ginger's way
Ginger steps up i
o the window and climbs through
Brigitte rubs her throat, trying hard to keep breathing
Brigitte dashes to her own bed and drags an Adidas gym bag from under it
Brigitte starts grabbing clothes off the floor and jamming them into the bag
(/) was like, okay
Fuck you too
She'd be sorry
And 'd be like, dunno - somewheres' totally else goin' not my problem
Right
- Brigitte trudges up to the bus stop next to the fence of the playhouse yard with her full Adidas bag
Light streams from inside the yard, multi-coloured, strobing
It looks like a  has landed on the other side of the fence
She peers through the slats
She sees the playhouse, lit up like a Christmas tree
She sees gloved hands and police uniforms
Then sliding past, the long - almost endless - shape on a stretcher being drawn out of the playhouse: they've found Trina's body
The bus appears, approaching from way down the road
81 Brigitte looks from it to the crime scene
The crime scene photographer's
pops in Brigitte's face - blinding her for a second
Brigitte rubs her eyes
She shakes her head hard
The bus is indicating, slowing to pull over
Brigitte opens her eyes
The bus is almost here
Brigitte grips her Adidas bag
(/) But you can't break up with blood
You can't divorce yer sister
You jus' can't
The bus passes, obscuring Brigitte from view as its body fills frame
when its tail lights pass, Brigitte is far down the street, running like a champion in the direction she came from
'  - Brigitte carefully unlocks the bedroom door and slowly opens it
The room is dark and just as she left it
Ginger's hed has not been slept in, and she is no where to be seen
(/) 'd get the monkshood from my locker at school the next morning
Brigitte creeps to the bathroom and snaps the light on
Empty
(/) 'd find Ginger, 'd find out if the stuff even worked
Brigitte locks the window shut
She locks the bedroom door and pushes a bureau of drawers in front of it
(/) could deal with whatever, as long as  tried
If it was the last thing she ever saw me do, it was gonna be me goin' fer somethin' by myself
The real Ginger woulda dug that large
Brigitte turns on the bedside lamp and fishes a baseball bat out of the closet
82 (/) would try to save my sister when the sun came up
You know, if the sun came up
Brigitte climbs into bed, snuggling the bat in with her
She lights a smoke
She finds the feminine hygiene calendar on the bedside table next to the photo of the girls as kids at Halloween, taken many years before
The calendar tells us it is about to be Friday
Friday is the full moon
Friday is Halloween
'  - The lamp is still on
The ash tray is full of butts
Brigitte stirs in her sleep
Ginger stands at the end of Brigitte's bed, staring at her
Brigitte snaps to, gripping the bat
Ginger snorts, and climbs into her own bed
Brigitte swings her gaze to the window
It is still shut and locked
The bureau is still in front of the door
Brigitte holds her hat tightly and watches her sister's back in the next bed, terrified
- Brigitte jogs up to the school
The yard is full of students
Teachers are marshaling them into lines and seating them on the grass
Brigitte plows through
Ginger rides past, piggy-backed by Jason
Ginger completely ignores Brigitte
Brigitte looks very worried
Ginger Fitzgerald is such a slut
/No kidding
/The bitch
You hear about Trina Sinclair
/Dug her up in somebody's back yard
/oh that's so sad
/ Poor Trina, Ga-awd
As Brigitte gets closer to the building, she finds police cars and cops at the main entrance
83 Shit
is speaking with the  constable who has been visiting classes
Fardor holds a hanky over his face
That stench near the staff offices, what is that you think
Brigitte hedges up the steps toward the door
couldn't say, sir
Now is there anyone you suggest we talk to
Anyone with something against the school
Brigitte slips past the two men
For god's sake look around you
got 350 angry young people bored blind
Helluva day for my goddamn cleaning staff to be late
Brigitte stops at the threshold
The hell you goin'
left something in my locker
Find your homeroom and wait
School's outta bounds until we call you in
Get
Brigitte backs down the steps, looking like she just took a good slap
She turns to confront the mass confusion around her
Brigitte spots Ginger dancing on the roof of a car in the lot now, surrounded by boys
Brigitte spots Sam's truck near-by
- Sam is sit in his truck, slumped over the wheel
He holds an almost-gone bottle of rye
Brigitte runs up
84 Sam is crying
He doesn't see Brigitte arrive at his window, so she turns to tip-toe away
Sam looks up
His eyes tell us he's stoned
Hey
Wolfs bane
Wanna drink
Brigitte stops and turns to face him
Sam dries his face on his sleeve and pops his passenger door
Brigitte looks around and slides in
Ginger is watching Brigitte out of the corner of her eye
'  - showed up to see Trina
But she's 'm goin' strange in the head
Brigitte doesn't know what to say, so she offers his a smoke
He takes it
Why
Why would ya do a thing like that
Brigitte examine his
face for an implication
There isn't one
What's unny is  dumped her that night
Feel bad about it now
Truth is, she was a pain in the ass
sound like a jerk, right
No
Really
Yeah well, while she was - disappearin', 'm off have a time at the Highway Home with my buddy Georgio
Drinkin', dealin' - an, now she's Sam is over-come again
Brigitte raises a hand to touch him, chickens out, and then scores on the second attempt
He rolls right into her arms
85 For a brief moment, Brigitte has her nose in his hair, her cheek on his shoulder, her hands on his back
He's crying, and she fights her own tears
Sorry, this is strange
don't even
Last time  saw her she was so mad at me
An' we did have some times, we did
Makes me sick what her last thought a' me musta been though
Their eyes meet, their faces are inches apart
Brigitte kisses him, very softly and very quickly and then pulls out
Sam looks shocked
Brigitte looks more shocked

She is staring at Brigitte and Sam in his truck
Her face darkens

Ginger's most maniacal laugh drifts over to them
Brigitte sees her dancing sexily on the roof of a car with a whole crowd of leering boys

Brigitte makes her way toward Ginger

Brigitte physically fights with herself not to yell out
She runs a few steps toward Sam
Brigitte looks back at Ginger, who drills her with an evil warning glare
The cops shove Sam into the back of a cruiser
They roar off
Brigitte stands alone, apart from the crowd
The cruisers' flashing lights disappear down the street
Brigitte turns to face Ginger, mustering her own first menacing look
Ginger accepts a cigarette offered by one of her boys
(/) They closed the school that day
So  never got to my locker
So never got the monkshood thought, this is it

Brigitte stands in the front room window, which is decorated with a Happy Halloween paper sign and plastic bats
Brigitte's watching Henry put Styrofoam tombstones in the front yard

Brigitte pokes at her food
Ginger eats like a fiend, with sunglasses on
Her monster arm has been wrapped in gauze from tip to elbow

Brigitte slides into her regular chair and props her hands on her wrists in an attitude of complete distraction
What's your sister up to
Brigitte looks at Henry as he works on a little witch
She said she had a lot of work to do on her costume
Should we dress up, you think
Henry grimaces
He sifts through the dried plants before them
Brigitte double-takes the pile
- oh, Henry
You're no fun at all
91 Brigitte sits bolt up right in her seat
What is this stuff
Just weeds, old cuttings from the yard
No,  stuff
Brigitte plucks out a handful of dried plant with tiny purple flowers
Oh,  had that around the dahlias
Man at the greenhouse said it'd keep the cats out
Seemed to do the job
It's got a funny name - nun's robe, priest hat, something Monkshood
That's right
Do we have a budding botanist in the family
Pun intended
Pamela giggles as does Henry
Brigitte grabs a fistful of monkshood and races for the door
Hey, we need that
Brigitte
But Brigitte is gone
That was my accent colour
- The half-finished basement has a rec room which Pamela has decked out in an infantile version of ghoulish for the party
Punch sits ready next to case-lot pop and Tupperware brimming with snacks
- /July 15
1996 92 Brigitte walks through to the door with a sign,
Brigitte unlocks the door and slips the monkshood up her shirt
- Candles are burning all over
Ginger's bed is turned down, ready
Brigitte walks in on Jason climbing through the open window
Hey
Must be the place, right
Brigitte sneers at him
He holds a half-gone bottle of schnapps, a dress shirt and his Good Jeans on
The toilet flushes in the john
Brigitte knocks on the door
WHAT1 McCardy's here
The bathroom door unlocks but
remains closed
Git in here an, gimme a hand
Brigitte casts an uncertain look at Jason
'mon ladies, there's six other guys sitting in the shrub waiting
Brigitte's face darkens
She slips into the bathroom and shuts the door
(/) Do you think some people deserve to die
- Brigitte does not tryo to hide her fear of being in a confined space with Ginger
There are razors and whiskers all over the floor
shaving cream every where
Ginger is red- faced, sweating and hostile
93 Don't say a fuckin' word
Ginger lowers the towel she's wearing enough to show the bump on her butt is now a twitching tail
Brigitte gasps
Take this gauze and tie it flat
Ginger, you can't Brigitte takes the roll of gauze
She grabs the tail between her fingers and coils it up with utter disgust
Brigitte's hands tremble
- / Jason sits on the edge of Ginger's bed and bounces up and down a bit
Between his legs we glimpse a dog tag hanging between the mattresses
- Brigitte tapes the gauze in place
Ginger throws a robe on and grabs the door
Now get outta my life
Brigitte grits her teeth
gotta get ready for the party
Then wait here till 'm done
What, through all fifty a' them
Oh, don't tempt me
Ginger takes a deep breath before she opens the bathroom door
Her breath is ragged
She smoothes her hair and chews her lip
She's nervous
Ginger opens the door and closes it behind her
- /July 22, 1996 94 Brigitte hears, (/) It's really dark in here
(01S) 'm shy
Lay down
Brigitte puts the toilet seat down and sits on it
Brigitte lights a smoke
Brigitte withdraws the monkshood from under her shirt and has a good scratch where it was itching her
- are the sounds of slurp kisses and Jason's moans
fly unzips
Clothes fall with soft plunks to the floor
Bed springs creak
Plastic condom wrappers crinkle and then the - of one being fitted on pretty roughly
Somewhere above them the door bell starts ringing
From a vanity cupboard she pulls a Zombie face-painting kit and sets it next to the monkshood
-- Cars are streaming down the street in both directions
Groups of    flock down the walks, over lawns, and que up to get into the Fitzgerald party
On their front porch, Pamela and Henry meet and greet the young men, awed by their numbers
(to Pamela) Notice any girls
Pamela shrugs
'  - / Brigitte - now in -face - rubs the monkshood between her fingers, crumbling it into a neat pile on the counter
- from the bedroom, the sounds of Ginger having rough sex continue
Brigitte peels a centimeter of paper off the end of an unlit smoke and wiggles the cigarette, creating a second pile of tobacco
She reaches into the radiator vent and withdraws a package of rolling papers
'  - ;/ - /July 15
1996 95 One  in a skeleton costume creeps along the shrubs toward the Fitzgerald sisters' bedroom window
He stumbles over a demon, a Frankenstein and a mummy
They curse one another
'  - -, from the rec room part noise grows as things get under way outside
Ginger waves good-bye to Jason as she undoes Frank's shirt buttons
The bathroom door is now inching open a crack
'  - On the counter at the sink, all evidence of Brigitte's project with the monkshood are gone
Brigitte peers out the cracked door and then looks away, fighting an urge to watch in spite of being grossed out
The sounds of sex drift in from the bedroom
She catches sight of herself in the mirror
As a
She tugs her shirt tight over her breasts
Nothing to see
She smoothes her shirt with her hands, then moves her palms down over her waist, her hips
Over her crotch
Brigitte's fingers skip under her skirt
Brigitte's face tells us she's searching for something under there
She's trying this out
But nothing's happening
She frowns
She draws her hands out of her skirt and quickly washes her hands in the sink
She checks her watch and sighs
- Brigitte creeps out of the bathroom on all fours
Above her, Ginger's feet and some guy's writhe on the bed
Brigitte reaches up to the bedroom door knob
She opens it and crawls out
- The rec room is packed with over-grown ghouls
Pamela is trying to play it cool from her perch behind the punch bowl, as she marvels at the costumes and all these kids she's never even
met before
96 Henry has a group of boys cornered with a college football story
Brigitte leans against the wall watching the party and looking at her watch
(/) In English  heard about this chick who used a man's name to get her books read
She went by George but she was really Mary Ann
Goes, "It's never too late to be what you might have been
" was jus' there thinkin', is that true
Was it too late to be an unsolved Mystery
Alls  had to do was walk away
(/) Brigitte
Brigitte looks up to see a cheap plastic Frankenstein mask looking down at her
Its owner flips it up: it's Sam
Brigitte's eyes snap wide open in shock
They let me go
No evidence: someone called in this tip
(/) So  decided to stay
Hey, you gotta get outta here -/ Ginger emerges from the bedroom like a reigning diva, and the room stops dead
Brigitte drops her glass of punch
Ginger has come out as herself, as an almost full-blown werewolf
She wears a Lill Red Riding Hood cape jobbie and a plastic mask
She's the best looking monster you ever laid eyes on
Down her belly she has six perfect nipples showing and everything
The room bursts into a_cheerinq round of applause
'  '   ' That make-up is amazing
97 ' ' Ginger, it looks totally real
(to Pamela) Told you
She's a arts-type, for chrissakes, look at that
She's very good, isn't she
(to Brigitte) Wow, yer sister's gone to town
Yeah, she's gone all right
Hey
can you do me a favor
Sure
Can you give somethin' to Ginger for me
Jus' - we're Navin' a fight, but  got this thing for her
Yeah, what
Brigitte shows him what appears to be a joint
Sam takes it
Don't tell her  gave it to you
Jus' act like it's from you
She won't take it if it's from me
Oh, okay
An, don't like, go any wheres with her
Okay
Jus' come right back, 'kay
Gonna miss me Bee
Brigitte smiles, embarrassed and freaking at the exact same time
Be right back
- /July 15
1996 98 Across the densely crowded room, Sam whispers in Ginger's ear
Ginger smiles and nods and palms something he passes her
Ginger glances at Brigitte, who tries to pretend she's not watching
when Brigitte checks again, Ginger is leading Sam by the hand toward her bedroom
Sam looks over his shoulder and lifts a finger - one second - back at Brigitte
The bedroom door shuts behind them
Brigitte leaps toward the bedroom
Someone catches her arm and holds her back
one minute young lady,  could use a little help here
Let go of me,  have to get Ginger
have to get two more veggie trays down those stairs think your sister' 11 be fine for two minutes
Pamela is already marching Brigitte up the stairs
Brigitte strains to get back
Looking between her mother and her closed bedroom door, desperately
- Pamela snags Brigitte again as Brigitte dumps the veggie tray and tries to get to the bedroom
All these boys came to see you two, least you can do is stop hiding in your room
Honestly, you act like someone'd forced this party down your throat
Now go be nice
Pamela stands between Brigitte and the bedroom door, her arms folded
Mother
You don't understand
Yes-- do
was shy too at your age
Mingle
99 Brigitte backs away with such a dirty look on her face
She turns to confront the eager painted faces around her - all desperate for some female attention
Brigitte has  want to scream written all over her face
- / Sam pushes Ginger away from him
Ginger has Brigitte's gift joint smoldering between her finger tips
Ginger is pretty out of it, she totters
okay, cut it out now
This dope's fucked
Makin' me blaarrggh
'mon
'll do ya
No thanks
Told yer sister 'd be right back
What's up your ass
Don't get mean, s'nothin' personal
happen to think Brigitte's pretty cool
and -/ Leave my baby sister alone
Do me, don't hurt her
won't hurt her
Now be a good girl and finish up your joint
oh
Well fuck you
Ginger takes a big toke as she paces between Sam and the door
Suddenly she's coughing uncontrollably, rubbing her eyes, wailing in pain
Burning
What is this
Sam makes a move toward her and Ginger blindly lashes out at him
Ginger hurls Sam into the bed
Sam's flight path knocks the mattress askew: dozens and dozens of dog collars pour out over him
Sam fingers one in particular
100 Morely -
- Brigitte sits on the stairs to the main floor cornered by a guy dressed as a cow
(/) Something was definitely fucked
Brigitte eyes Pamela, who is slowly being distracted by horny young men who will now dance with anybody, even Pamela
Do you think this is a faggy costume for a guy
You can just say
dunno  been gettin' funny looks
What, like we aren't advanced enough that a guy can show up completely in the spirit of the thing with an udder, an' not get treated like a freakin' fruit
Brigitte looks at her watch
Pamela is dragged off into the throng by a band of juveniles singing Do The Hustle
Brigitte makes her move at last
snob
Brigitte makes a badly-faked would-be casual bee-line for their bedroom door
Brigitte wiggles the knob
It's locked
'  - Brigitte (still a zombie) unlocks the door and peers in
The light is on in the bathroom, the door is ajar
The shower is running
There are a few candles burning in corners
otherwise the room is dark
Brigitte steps inside, closing the door on the party behind her
She grabs a flashlight and turns it on
The walls are splattered with blood
There is gore on the floor
Brigitte plucks the monkshead joint from a pool of bloody goo - it is soaked
Useless
- /July 22, 1996 101 On the bed, Sam lays with his shirt off and his fly open
His face is mutilated
He's missing an eye
Brigitte creeps toward him
Sam groans
Brigitte leaps back
she tries to speak, but her voice isn't working
Her face transforms from horror to fury
Then she heads to bathroom door
- You bitch
Brigitte discovers Ginger sitting in the tub floor under the running shower, weeping
Her eyes are swollen
Ginger is now covered in coarse hair
The water around her is full of blood
There is a kitchen knife next to her
Ginger's stoned numb on the monkshood dose
She's groggy and weak
oh fuck
Ginger is squeezing her now full tail at its base, where the blood is oozing between her f
inger
s
Ginger has tried - and tailed - to euL her tail off
Oh no
Oh no
Fuck, fuck
Ginger doesn't move
Ginger looks so pathetic, it's heart- breaking
Brigitte snatches the knife away and shuts off the water
Nobody'll want me now any ways
Sc
Brigitte takes in the cut, the rest of the monstrosity her sister has become
don't wanna do this any more
Brigitte yanks Ginger out of the tub and grabs a towel, frantic
Press this on the cut
Ginger
Move, c'mon
- /July 22, 1996 1 02 Ginger does as she's told
Brigitte digs out gauze and tape packages
They're both almost empty - they've used it all up
Brigitte throws them on the floor
missed you Bee
'm sorry
Brigitte searches Ginger's face
Ginge'
That you in there
Ginger cracks an uncertain, pained smile
Brigitte does too, an exact replica, in fact
Ya feeb
Brigitte gently turns Ginger around to try and deal with her tail
Ginger is woozy and weak from blood loss
okay
can't clean this one up
We have to go
Like Go, go
Can you do it
'm so woozy
Brigitte glances out into the bedroom
Um
Ever bite something you din't kill
No
(misinterpreting the question - hopeful) Wanna be one with me
Ah
No
Sam
Isn't dead
Oooh nooo
Don't worry
Keep pressing
'll be right back
'  - '' 1 03 Sam is fingering his wounds, half-conscious, drooling bile and blood
Brigitte (still a zombie) looms up behind him with her baseball bat
She fishes in his pants' pocket and withdraws a set of keys
Hey
Sorry
really did think you were
Like
Not bad
So you know, whatever
Any ways
'm really sorry -  have to
Sam moans as his good eye rolls up at her
Brigitte blinks away tears and looks away, collecting herself
Brigitte raises the bat over her head and swings it down as - The party is rocking along
Pamela knocks on their door
Girls
You in there
You're not being very sociable
There's no answer
She tries the knob, and is surprised to find it unlocked
She opens the door
She turns on the lights
Pamela takes in the bloody muck everywhere
The room is deserted
No Sam
No sisters Fitzgerald
Just gore
Pamela swoons and drops like a deadweight to the floor
Henry rushes up, looking in over his wife's body
The boys in costume crowd in behind him
Pamela, honey, it's just a prank, you know how they
(he fingers some ) Holy mother of - it's warm
Where are my kids
Ginger went in here with Sam McDonald a while back
Sam McDonald
104 Yeah, you know
The guy they thought was the Beast, but they let 'im go
Henry steps into the room
He spots a bloody trail up to the open ground-level window
- Tires squeal in the street and the county regreening truck lurches out of its parking spot
- Brigitte (still a zombie) throws the truck into gear with an amateur's hand
Her Adidas bag and her jar of two dollar bills is on the seat next to her
Ginger is just seen through the grate between the cab and the dark back of the truck
(/) Plans, plans arc good
'Course hardly had one
Adrenaline though, adrenaline is pretty speedy shit
Ginger
Don't eat the body okay
got this idea, an' we'll need Sam
Brigitte floors it and the truck blasts down their cul du sac to the main road
/ - The truck speeds down the street a tad erratical ly
Sirens rise around it
- Brigitte slows, looking left, right and in the side mirrors trying to see where the sirens are coming from
Fuck, fuck fuck,
105 Then suddenly, four cop cars blast past them in the opposite direction
Heading back to the Fitzgerald house
Ha
All rightie then
Brigitte drives on
What she cannot see behind her in the grate are the glimpses of Ginger in the flickering lights of the passing street lamps
Her final spurt of transformation is taking place: Her face is filling in with fur
Her eyes glow golden, yellow, wolfen
Her face pulls into a wet snout
long pink tongue lolls out between glistening white fangs
- The truck rolls to the crest of the hill over Bailey Downs - the sight of the bush party
The moon is immense up here
You could almost touch it
- Brigitte eases the truck to the edge of the hill
The lights of the homes below them creep into view
okay, Ginger
They'll think that Sam took us from our room, right
'Cause of his record an, the arrest, right
We're gonna make this look like he did, any ways
He got us, maybe killed us, took our bodies to do some unspeakable thingy
But then
Sam killed himself
You follow
Ginger doesn't answer
106 So boom, diversion
Meanwhile you an, me hit the highway
we can hitch, get you cleaned up
By the time the find out we weren't in Sam's clutches at all, we could be any wheres
Yeah
Whatcha think
Ginger doesn't answer
It'll work
( hope
) Brigitte puts the brake on but does not cut the engine
/ - Brigitte climbs out of the cab
She moves to the back doors of the truck, and opens them
In the inky darkness inside, she hears heavy panting
Ginger
'mon, we got move
Shove Sam down here
Brigitte climbs up into the truck, reaching for something on its floor
Brigitte f itids Sam's prone feet
An animal/Ginger launches out at her, knocking her back, out, clear of the truck
Ginger isn't Ginger any more - what we can glimpse in the darkness is an attack by a creature much like the one that bit Ginger
And it's attacking Brigitte
Brigitte flails, kicks and punches at it
She breaks free and clambers at the tool rack on the inside panel of the truck
She grabs a shovel as the creature comes snarling up at her
Stop
mean it
It lunges at her again and Brigitte clocks it
It slides, dazed, off the back of the truck to the ground
: Brigitte drags Sam's body into the front seat
She sets her Adidas bag on the gas pedal
She releases the brake
The truck rolls forward
off the top of the hill
Brigitte watches as it crashes down, down, rolling and twisting into the suburb below
It lands in a heap and bursts into flames
107 Nice one
Brigitte returns to where It/Ginger was last seen on the ground
The shovel and blanket are there
bloody pool trails off into the woods
Brigitte hefts the shovel warily, shoulders the blanket, and follows the wetness shining in the moonlight
/ - Fuck Ginger
Leave a fuckin' trail much
Could leave everybody a fuckin' map
Tense seconds pass as she searches through the scrub and trees, shovel ready
we can hear panting and growling
won't hurt you if you don't hurt me
'Kay
Ginge'
'Kay
Brigitte spots something ahead and lowers the shovel as she approaches it
It/Ginger cowers in the brush, collapsed
Her head and tail are bleeding
Brigitte drops to her knees nest to her sister, frantic with grief
Oh no
Ginger
didn't mean It/Ginger is gasping, fading
Her eyes start rolling back in her head
Brigitte's hand is shaking as it reaches out but can't touch her
Ginger licks Brigitte's fingers, slowly
Brigitte buries her face in Ginger's ruff, moaning
You can't, you can't, we're out
You can't, don't don't do this to me
Not now
Look, look it's all taken care of
we're Unsolved Mysteries
- - The sunrise has the sky this bloody red
108 Brigitte drags Ginger a few feet past a sign next to the road:
(/) We made it out
There was this road
An' the space between here and where ever
did it
Brigitte opens the blanket
Ginger has returned to human form
Because Ginger is dead
- In a small grove of trees, Brigitte pushes the last pile of dirt over Ginger's shallow grave
Brigitte wipes her caked hands off in the dewy grass
Beneath the dirt and dried blood, she finds puncture wounds
Brigitte looks
She rolls her eyes wearily
Brigitte stands and heads to the side of the road
semi appears on the horizon, coming her way
Brigitte lifts her thumb
The semi's turn indicator comes on as it slows and veers to arrive before her
as: Excerpts from an episode of the television program roll
It tells the story of the mysterious disappearance of two teenage girls - sisters - who disappeared under strange circumstances in the normally quiet suburb of Bailey Downs
Brigitte and Ginger -- re-enact the summarized events of their flight from justice
The cops figured out their faked deaths, of course
Henry and Pamela have reportedly denied comment
It is seen from the community's perspective as two delusional young women gone totally wrong, a grotesque tragedy of youth wasted by mental illness
No one can explain though the non-human blood trails leaving the scene of their last crime
At the segment's close and the credits roll
out, we see the traditional high school photos of Brigitte and Ginger
