'  -  1 (14) sits fully-clothed on top of his made bed
He is a wiry young man with a few blonde hairs on his upper lip struggling desperately to be a mustache
His room, cluttered with junk, is dark, quiet and tiny backpack and an oversized Walkie-Talkie sit next to him
The silence is cut by a  from the Walkie
Ellis quickly grabs it
'm comin' out now
He crams the Walkie into his backpack and slings it over his shoulder
On his feet, he slides open a window at the foot of his bed
He's out in one motion
2
-  2 Ellis skirts alongside the exterior wall of his room on a two- foot-wide section of decking
He lives on a  anchored just off the bank of the Arkansas River
The "boat" is really the combination of a double wide trailer and a vinyl-sided shack fused together atop large flotilla
Ellis scurries to the mobile home section of the boat
He slips past a barbecue grill and settles underneath a lighted window
come from inside
Slowly, Ellis gets on his toes to peer through the window
3
'  -  3 (41) takes a jug of milk out of the refrigerator
(52) sits at a small table reading a newspaper
The mobile home kitchenette is no larger than Ellis' room
just want to have a conversation
just want to talk about it
Mary Lee sits down across from Senior, who doesn't look up from his paper
Her eyes narrow and she extends a finger toward him
(') If you don't look up from that goddamn paper
She stops before completing the thought
After a moment, Senior lowers his paper
He stares across the table at his wife
He looks at her with true disdain
2
His eyes trace down her face and robe before finally settling on his cup of coffee
He picks up the cup, takes a sip, and sets it back on the table
He raises the paper up
Mary Lee's eyes soften
She bites the inside of her cheek to keep from crying
Her eyes move to the kitchen window
4
'  -  4 Ellis quickly ducks and mouths the word "shit
" He slips under the window toward a metal carport that covers a boat, fish cleaning station, and industrial ice machine
The entire houseboat is anchored to the shore by two thick ropes tied to opposite ends of the flotilla
The ropes extend upward into the tops of enormous pine trees
Ellis sprints across a simple, wood-planked bridge to shore
His houseboat is one of several in a row along the riverbank
5
'  -  5 Ellis scurries into the treeline and arrives at a dirt path
Waiting for him there is (14), a scrawny kid with slicked back blonde hair wearing a  -shirt
He sits atop a smallish dirt bike
Ellis hops on the back
What the shit man
Suck it
Drive
The bike spits up mud as they peel out down the trail
6
-  6 From a distance, the single headlight of the dirt bike snakes up and down, in and out of trees along the riverbank
, The sound of the engine rips through fog and trees illuminated by the straining headlight
7
-  7 The boys emerge from behind a sand covered hill
Now on foot, they are silhouetted against a light blue, morning sky
How old is she
Junior
3
At a collection of trees growing out of the water, the boys move branches away from a tarp covered boat
She's got nice titties
You talk to her
Nah
You're gonna have to talk to her
know
Remind me when we get back to my house, Galen's got a book on that
Neckbone takes a spot up front in the small, flat-bottom boat
Ellis, a foot on the bank and one in the boat, launches them out into the water
8
-  8 chunk of Neckbone's greased back hair bobs in the wind as they cruise down river
Ellis steers a small 15 horsepower motor
An orange sun is coming up now
Neckbone's eyes lock on what's in front of them
Ellis kills the motor
Neckbone stands up, a serious look on his face
Shit
Ellis raises up behind him
He takes a deep breath, nods
(') Your dad'd kill us he knew we went out there
'm not worried about my dad killin' us
sprawls out in front of them
It's enormous
Their boat drifts at the mouth of the Arkansas, a small river by comparison
The Mississippi is a swirling mess of brown water and yellow foam six football fields wide
What if it sinks
4
It ain't gonna sink
We gotta move if we're gonna make it back
Set your watch
We'll need a good fifteen minutes
Neckbone sets an alarm on his fat plastic wristwatch
They take their seats
Ellis cranks the motor
The small boat slowly chugs out onto the massive river
9
-  9 The boat lurches through the murky, rushing water
Neckbone has both hands firmly planted on the boat's edges
Ellis tries to handle the motor which has little impact against this current
The tail end of the boat swings to the right
Ellis flinches and grabs an edge to steady himself
The front of the boat bobs toward an  in the middle of the river
Neck turns to Ellis and points
10
-  10 The boys splash down in ankle deep water
They take hold of the front of the boat and drag it onto the muddy shore
Neckbone jogs to a tree line in the center of the island
Ellis snatches up his backpack and follows
11
-  11 The island, only 60 some yards in diameter, is separated by a clump of tall trees that form a wooded area in its center
The trees make it so you can't see from one side of the island to the other
Galen thinks it's been here awhile
Thinks the last flood did it
Ellis follows as Neckbone winds through the trees
They stop at a deep creek that cuts across the island
Neckbone looks to his right, then his left
Sees what he's looking for
(') It's down there
fallen tree trunk that straddles the creek
Ellis starts across
5
(') Hold it
Neckbone picks a large stone up off the ground
(') Look
Eight feet below the tree trunk, a nest of water moccasins curl around in the creek
Neckbone drops the stone on top of them
The snakes fan out
(') Little shits
Their mud-caked high-tops stomp across the trunk
12
-  12 The boys stop near the base of a large tree and stare up
Ellis cranes his neck back
Awestruck
So there it is
Yeah, there it is
26 Foot Long  sits nestled in the tree limbs above
13
-   13 The boys scale up the tree from low lying branches
Ellis, hands on the edge of the boat, gets a leg over the side and pulls himself onto the deck
He reaches down and helps to drag Neckbone on board
They get to their feet, steadying themselves on the wooden deck
It's solid
They take in their new vantage point
It came down from up there
Ellis points to higher limbs that have long been broken off
Neckbone walks to the back of the boat and hangs his head over
He finds a gaping hole of gutted wood
Motor broke off
Ellis isn't concerned with the motor
His eyes are locked on a covered cabin at the front of the boat
Who else knows about this
6
Just me and Galen
What's he think
He don't care about it
Good
Ellis walks to the cabin
He pushes a vinyl door open
(') 'Cause this boat's ours
Ellis has to duck down to go inside
Neckbone follows
14
-  14 Ellis, stooping over, makes his way into the tiny cabin room
Yellow floral curtains, stained with age, cover a row of windows that wrap around the top of the cabin
These provide an odd glow in an otherwise dark, wood paneled space
There is a bench with rotted out cushions to the left
To the right, a mold-covered sink and mirror
Neckbone peers over Ellis' shoulder at the front of the cabin room
small booth sits to the right across from a miniature toilet partially shielded by an open door
It's got its own shitbox Neckbone slides back a portion of floral curtain and light streams in
He starts opening small closets and drawers
Ellis plops down on the rotted bench cushions
This is perfect
Ho-Lee-Shit
Neckbone stares in an open drawer
He removes a stack of Playboys from the 1980's
Ellis smiles at him
He leans back and props his foot against the sink cabinet across from him
This is home
Neckbone opens the first Playboy
It disintegrates
(') Aw shit
7
As he scrambles to gather the fallen pages, Ellis notices a dried   next to his foot
He lowers his shoe from the cabinet leaving a smaller, muddy print of his own
He leans in to examine the larger print
The impression of a has been left in the heel
(') Her tits are so small
Ellis reaches out and traces his finger in the groove of the cross marking
His eyes narrow as he re-surveys the cabin
On the table across from the toilet, he notices several empty cans of Beanie Weenie
In the booth, he sees a grocery bag
Ellis slowly raises up and goes over to it
Neck
Look at that beave
You gotta see this
Ellis reaches out for the plastic bag
His fingers pull back the edges to reveal its contents: one can of unopened Beanie Weenie and half a loaf of
Neck
Ellis reaches for the bread and gives it a squeeze
It's Ellis freezes
What
Someone's here
What
Ellis holds the loaf of bread up to Neckbone
Someone's livin' here
Neckbone sees the grocery bag
His eyes widen
The boys are stone frozen
They listen for other sounds
Silence
Both boys flinch at the sharp sounds
Neckbone's hand flies to cover the alarm on his wristwatch
8
Shit
We gotta go
can't be late
15
-   15 They drop out of the tree and hit the ground running
16
/ -   16 The boys' feet rush across the tree trunk bridging the creek
17
-   17 They launch out of the treeline and sprint to their boat
Neckbone grabs the side and starts pushing the boat to the water
Ellis slings his backpack in and joins him
Suddenly, Ellis straightens up, leaving Neckbone to struggle
What are you doing
Ellis stares at a muddy boot print, cross in the heel, stamped in the center of their boat
He looks back to the treeline, then down the shore
He looks to his feet
The boys' shoe prints make chaotic patterns in the mud
Larger boot prints lead off down the shoreline
(') What is it
() saw that same boot print up in the tree
It has a cross in the heel
Somebody's been in our boat
Shit
Let's go
Ellis begins following the boot prints around the shoreline
(') We gotta go if you wanna make it back
( ) Your dad's gonna kick our ass
It'll take twice as long goin' up river
Hold it
9
Ellis stops and points ahead of them
(') Up there
They stop
Neckbone takes the lead, walking up to the last boot print
They appear to vanish
Where the hell'd he go
don't know
Neckbone turns and freezes
has appeared in the distance behind Ellis
He stands between the boys and their boat
Ellis notices the look on Neckbone's face and turns
He flinches at the sight of the Man
(38) stands near the boys' boat holding a pink, child's fishing pole with cartoon characters on it
He stares back at them and casts his fishing line into the water
Shit
You know that guy
've never seen him before
Shit
Mud, not taking his eyes off the boys, slowly reels in his line
His hair is a wild mop that leads to two weeks of growth on his face
With a cigarette clinched, he cracks a smile revealing a He holds a hand in the air as if to wave
(') Shit
Neckbone slowly raises his hand up to wave back
Mud wears jeans and cowboy boots
His filthy button-up shirt looks like it hasn't left his body in years
He breaks his stare with the boys
Continuing to reel in his line, he walks over to them
What you say
The boys don't respond
Mud walks past them and casts again
10
(') Helluva thing
What's that
Mud takes the cigarette from his mouth
tattoo of a snake's head covers the top of his right hand
Two large cotton blossoms spill out of its jaws
Boat in the trees
It's a helluva thing
Mud continues walking down the shoreline, reeling in his bait
The boys follow, tentatively
You talkin' 'bout our boat
'm talkin' about my boat
We found it
You found it with me livin' in it
Possession is nine tenths of the law
So
Don't tell me you boys are from Mississippi
No
They watch as he grabs the bait at the end of his line and spits on it
Then, tucking the pole under his arm, he ties a lock of his hair into a knot
He finishes this process with another cast
(') You got crosses in your heels
Nails
Shaped liked crosses
What for
11
Ward off evil spirits
man called an Indian but was Meskin said they were Seven-league boots worn by the seventh son of a seventh son
Told me it'd turn me into a werewolf but that's a lie
don't know nothin' about that
Ellis, confused, won't take his eyes off the man
(') They just good luck, but so far they ain't been workin' too well
(missing tooth smile) What's your name
Mud seems easy to smile, which softens his otherwise coarse look
His words spill from the mouth rapidly, without much thought for punctuation
Neckbone, emboldened by these facts, steps forward to answer
'm Neckbone, he's Ellis, and mister you may be stone ass crazy but  know you're not the owner of that boat, not for nine tenths of nothin'
Neckbone
That's a real handle son
Where ya'll from
What do you care where we're from
DeWitt
Neckbone looks at Ellis, frustrated by his friend
Arkansas boys
Ya'll had me worried for a second
Mud, pleased by this news, tucks the fishing pole under his arm and holds out a hand to shake
Ellis stares at the hand, unsure
He takes it reluctantly
We s'posed to know you
doubt it
grew up `round here, but 've been gone awhile
12
Where around here
Different places
Spent a lot of time back up near the White
You know Shelly's Oxbow
Neckbone can't believe his friend is offering this up
Ellis
We gotta go
know it
Guy named Tom Blankenship used to live back in there
He still does
His boat's cross from mine
Mud smiles
Ain't that somethin'
In one motion, Mud flicks his cigarette away and grabs a pack out of his shirt pocket
(') like you two
You remind me of me
And seeing how you boys are from Arkansas and we know some people and sounds like we all from the same place 'd say we can make a deal here about somethin'
deal for what
Food
Food for a boat
This guy's a bum Ellis
Come on
Mud's smile vanishes
Neckbone begins to walk off but begrudgingly stops when Ellis starts back in
Why don't you go get your own food
13
would if  could, but  told somebody 'd meet `em here
So 'm stuck for now and what  got's runnin' low
Neckbone walks back and pulls Ellis by the arm
He's a bum Ellis, let's go
Mud lays a serious look down on Neckbone
'm no bum
got money
You can call me a hobo `cause a hobo'll work for his living and you can call me homeless `cause that's true for now, but if you call me a bum again 'll have to teach you somethin' about respect that your daddy never did
Neckbone's confidence recedes
Ellis stands his ground
When they show up, you'll leave
Mud begins fishing again
Yeah
And when you leave, that boat's ours
Yeah
Ellis studies Mud's face, clothes, tattoos
He's thinking about it
Mud pauses from fishing to make eye contact
(') 'm in a tight spot
just need a little help
We gotta go
With that, Ellis turns to leave
The boys walk briskly back to their boat
Ellis looks over his shoulder to see Mud making another cast with his fishing pole
18
-   18 Ellis motors them away from the island
14
You get his name
No
Ellis looks back
Mud has disappeared
19
'  -  19 Senior heaves an enormous, white cooler into the bed of his weathered pick-up truck
The truck is parked at an angle on a concrete boat ramp next to their houseboat
The bed of the truck is jam-packed with six of the big, white coolers
The  of a dirt bike rattles through the trees
Senior looks up, wiping his brow with a handkerchief
Ellis leaps out of the treeline and runs to the pick-up
His hands hit his knees, out of breath
'm sorry
Where you been
Neck and  got caught up helpin' Galen
You're s'posed to be helpin' me had to load this myself
know, 'm sorry
Just get in the back
Can't be later than we are
Yessir
Senior flips up the tailgate
Ellis hops up the wheel well and into the bed of the truck
He steadies himself on one of the coolers as his father pulls away
/ - : 15
20 -Ellis looks around as he rides in the bed of the pick-up 20 truck
He's propped up on a cooler against the back window
The truck works its way down a two-lane highway
A20 -Driving, they pass a marina junkyard filled with old boats A20 and sailing paraphernalia
B20 -Downtown Dewitt
gas station
Clinic
Rows of red B20 brick buildings, some abandoned, a small furniture store
C20 -Parked, Ellis fills a grocery sack up with Ziplock bags fullC20 of white fish and ice out of the coolers
-He hops out of the truck and runs the sack of fish to the front door of a house
An elderly black man waits there
21
- -  21 Ellis sits in the bed of the truck eating a chili dog
Senior is up front wolfing down a cheeseburger
of  are gathered around a  of parked cars in the corner of the lot
They meander between the vehicles, smoking, gossiping, passing around a bottle of Boone's Farm
Ellis watches them
(16) appears in the middle of the Group laughing with her
She's pretty and physically more mature looking than Ellis
He watches as a   takes his ballcap off and puts it on May Pearl's head
She sniffs the cap, gags and tosses it back at him
Her friends laugh
Let's go son
Ellis crumples the wrapper to his finished hotdog and jumps down from the bed of the truck
22 /
' /-  -  -  22 Ellis rides up front with his father
Senior is a reserved man, older than Ellis' mother by several years
He's got thinning hair under the cap that only leaves his head when he sleeps
He reaches into his shirt pocket and fishes out a fold of cash
He slips out a five dollar bill and hands it to Ellis
It's s'posed to be ten
16
It's ten you do your share loaded this mornin'
That makes it five
Ellis begrudgingly stuffs the five in his jeans
You drop me at Neck's
Senior checks his pants pockets, feels around under his seat
Hadn't you seen enougha him today
Said he had something for me
You see anymore Ding Dongs over there
Ellis checks under his seat and pulls out a half-empty box of Ding Dongs
Hands one over to his father who rips the package with his teeth
What'd Momma wanna talk to you about
What
This mornin', what'd she wanna talk with you about
You spy on me in my own house
wasn't spyin', just heard ya'll
That's your mother's business
Senior makes this his answer, eats the Ding Dong
23
'  -  23 Neckbone sits on the front steps of his trailer reading a comic book
The muffled sound of the Beach Boys' "Help Me Rhonda" plays off a record inside
Senior's truck pulls away as Ellis walks up the entrance to the trailer park
17
came by for that book
What book
You said Galen had a book might help me out
Aw, yeah
We gotta give it a minute
You hear that music
Yeah
That means he's doin' it
That's his doin' it song
Ellis takes a seat next to Neckbone
They listen to the song, slightly craning their necks to pick up on any other sounds
There are none
You know who it is
Whoever's drivin' that white Dodge
Neckbone motions to a beat up Dodge Shadow in the yard
You tell Galen 'bout this morning
Nah
You tell anybody
No
That guy was crazy
Maybe
don't know
think he just needed some help
Well he can swim his ass off that island and get some
think 'm gonna go back, take him some food
18
Why
Suddenly, the music from inside stops
Footsteps approaching and the trailer door flies open, almost hitting the boys
(28) bursts out down the steps, straight to her car
She wears tight jean-shorts and is buttoning a white shirt
She stops and turns back to the boys
You're Neckbone right
Yeah
You look like a good enough kid word of advice, don't grow up to be like your shit heel uncle
The boys can't take their eyes off her cleavage revealed under her half-buttoned shirt
necklace with three misshapen pearls hangs from her neck
(') Hey
She snaps the boys' attention up to her eyes
(') You hear me
You treat a woman like a princess
Got it
Yeah
The trailer door opens and (36) emerges
He's a big, lumbering guy wearing a full-body wet suit pulled halfway down
faded mermaid tattooed in the middle of his chest
Come on baby
'
The Girl yanks off the necklace and hurls it at Galen
He brushes fingers through his thick mustache
That's uncalled for
He walks out to her
She heads for the Dodge Shadow
19
(') ( ) lot of people are comfortable with that kind of thing in the bedroom
Some people aren't
We know that about you now
Ellis sees one of the misshapen pearls at his feet
He picks it up and holds it to the sun
Pearls
Galen finds 'em in some of the mussel shells
Most of 'em ain't worth dick, but he likes to make necklaces for the girls
Come on, let's get that book
Neckbone walks into the trailer
Ellis stands up and retrieves the other two pearls out of the dirt
He crams them in his pocket and follows Neckbone inside
24
'  -  24 The trailer is decorated in the filth of a true bachelor pad
Neckbone makes his way to a bedroom
He tosses clothes and trash around to get to what he's looking for
cardboard box
He pulls the box onto the bed and sifts through
don't want you goin' back out there by yourself
That river's scary enough with two people, and don't trust that guy
( ) Here it is
He takes out a hardback book
The slip reads, "The Confident Confidant, communicating with the opposite sex
" (') Galen said this really turned things around for him
Thanks
Ellis flips delicately through the manual
25
'  -  25 Galen watches as the Girl's Dodge Shadow pulls away
The boys step out of the trailer
You really going back out there
20
think it's the right thing to do
Well
'll be over in the mornin' then
Galen, his thumbs tucked under his armpits, walks back to the trailer
He passes the boys and notices the self-help book in Ellis' hands
( ) That's a good book
Be sure you do the worksheets in the back
Let's get some dinner Neck
Galen's gone inside
'll call 'fore  come
All right
Neckbone follows his uncle into the trailer
Ellis flips through his new book as he heads out of the trailer park
26
'  -  26 By the time Ellis makes it to his houseboat, the sun has disappeared behind the horizon
He crosses the make-shift plank and enters through a screen door by the carport
27
'  -  -  -  27 Mary Lee flinches when she sees Ellis come through the door
Her face is flushed
Senior stands toe to toe with her
They stare at Ellis, who has paused in the doorway
He doesn't say anything, just looks curiously at his parents
Senior storms past Ellis and is out the door
Ellis steps further into the den
Mary Lee tries to straighten herself, patting down her hair and dabbing at her eyes with the back of her hand
You okay momma
Yes
21
She walks into the kitchen keeping Ellis at her back
She turns on the sink and begins scrubbing at a dish
(') Do you need me to fix you somethin'
Have you eaten
'm all right
Mary Lee shuts off the water and lets the dish rest in the sink
She turns to Ellis
'm gonna turn in
Okay momma
Mary Lee slips past him and enters her bedroom
The door closes and Ellis is left alone in the den
It's quiet
He waits, looking at the door his mother just closed
Ellis walks into the kitchen and eases open a cabinet door
Checking over his shoulder, he zips his backpack open and fills it with
28
'  -  28 Hands pump the stock of a high-powered pellet gun
(67), white hair cut high and tight wearing a short-sleeve button up, takes careful aim with the pellet gun
Tom sits in a lawn chair atop the roof of his houseboat
He squeezes his left eye shut
snake's head pokes out of the water about 15 yards off his boat
The head makes for a target no bigger than a thumb
Tom's left eye snaps open and he fires
The pellet rips through the snake's head
Its body floats to the surface
Tom takes account of his shot as he pumps the air rifle
He scans the water for more targets
29
'  -  29 Ellis watches Tom Blankenship from across the bayou
Tom's boat sits directly opposite Ellis', separated by 30 yards of muddy brown water
Ellis leans against a post under the carport
His backpack resting at his feet, he holds the Walkie-Talkie in his hand
Senior works behind him washing utensils in the outdoor sink
22
What do you know about Tom Blankenship
What
Senior doesn't turn around from his work at the sink
Mr
Blankenship, what do you know about him
Why
don't know
He looks lonely over there
Some people move to this river to work on it, and some move here to be left alone
Senior makes his way to the ice machine and begins scooping ice into a large white cooler
Mary Lee emerges from the houseboat dressed for work, a secretarial job
Senior stops what he's doing to watch her
She walks over to Ellis
Let's sit down for dinner tonight okay
Will you make it home by seven
Yes ma'am
She walks off the boat without a glance in Senior's direction
He trails her with his eyes before going back to digging in the ice
A29 Ellis looks back at Tom
The Walkie  out several A29 loud
Ellis crams it in his backpack and runs off the boat
(') Bye Dad
Senior holds a hand up but never looks up from his work
23
30
-  30 Water laps at the shore of the island
Ellis and Neckbone drag their boat onto the muddy bank
Where you think he's at
guess we should try the boat
They head for the treeline
31
-  31 The boys emerge from the woods, their attention focused up to the boat hovering in the tree some twenty feet above them
Ellis notices the remnants of a fire on the ground
log pushed up next to it for a seat
Ellis kicks at the ash
Looks like he made camp
(looking up to the boat) You think he's up there
(
) didn't know if ya'll'd come back
The boys spin around
They survey the woods but no one's there
Their eyes drift up to find Mud sitting in a tree, his legs dangle off a branch
What're you doin'
Mud bounds down, stepping from limb to trunk to the ground
It's an agile move
try to never sleep in the same place twice
What you got there
Mud motions with his head to the backpack in Ellis' hand
Ellis holds it out to him
brought you some food
Mud looks at the backpack, but doesn't move
(') Go on
24
Mud takes the backpack and walks over to the ashes of his campfire
He squats with his back to the boys and unzips the bag
Hunkered down, Mud's shirttail rides up over the lip of his jeans revealing a  at his backside
Ellis sees this and motions to Neckbone
The boys stand their ground, cautious
owe you boys
Keeping the bag in hand, Mud takes a seat on the stump behind him
He pulls out a selection of canned food; pumpkin pie filling, evaporated milk, green beans
He grabs the beans
(') was gonna try runnin' a trot line today
See how far that'd get me
Mud removes a good-sized folding knife from his pocket and makes short order of the can lid
He tips the can up letting the beans fall into his mouth
Juice flows down his cheeks
(') ( ) 'd been rationin' what had
green bean never tasted so good
The can is quickly emptied, juice running down Mud's chin
He straightens his back, choking down the final swallow
He sees the boys staring at him and catches himself
(') appreciate it
Yeah
What you got that pistol for
Mud wipes off his chin, realizing the boys have been studying him
He closes the knife and tucks it in his pocket
For protection
Mud gets up, heads for a duffel bag tucked under a nearby tree
The boys pivot, keeping Mud in front of them
Mud notices
(') Ya'll don't have to be afraid of me
have two ways to protect myself out here
This shirt, and this pistol
() 25
(') There are fierce powers at work in the world boys
Good, evil, poor luck, best luck
Men have to take advantage where they can
Mud removes a spool of fishing line and a small plastic tackle box
He scoops up the duffel bag and heads into the woods
(') Ya'll comin'
32 Neckbone looks to Ellis, who walks after Mud into the 32 trees
Who's this guy you're waitin' on
'm not waitin' for a guy
'm waitin' on my girlfriend
Juniper
Is she hot
She's beautiful
() Bullshit
Best lookin' girl 've ever seen
Hands down
Blonde hair
Long legs
She's like a dream you don't want to wake up from
She's got birds tattooed on her hands, here
Mud stops, points to the area on the top of his right hand, between his thumb and pointer finger
(') Nightingales
Good luck birds
That a good luck snake
No it is not
hate snakes
That's because God made them for us to fear
() 26
(') It's a thing we knew to be afraid of before we even got into this world
33 They emerge from the woods onto the downstream coast of 33 the island
It looks different than the other shoreline
large swath of red clay angles sharply into the water
(') Cherokee would wrap snake skin around their pregnant women's bellies
Induce labor, scare the child out
Here
He fetches a length of rope out of the duffel bag and tosses it to Neckbone
(') Set that `round your bed at night
Snake won't cross braided rope
Thanks
(nods to Mud's tattoo) So what's that for then
Mud walks to a tree branch that has grown out over the bank, nearly resting in the water
He sets a trot line from it
reminder
Don't get bit
was 10, swimmin' `bout a mile up from here
Me and Juniper
Sonofabitch swam right up under me, bit me just below the armpit
June got me out, got me to a clinic
Doctor said shoulda been dead in twenty minutes
Took us an hour just to get back to town
What'd they do
Gave me antivenom
For a cotton mouth
See here
Mud shows the tattoo on top of his right hand
He points out the two cotton blossoms bulging from the snake's mouth
(') Problem with antivenom is they can only give it to you once
It's made from horse blood
Your body would reject it a second time
The cure ends up being more dangerous than the poison
27
What happens if you get bit again
die, or just sweat it out
Neckbone, not buying it, looks at Ellis and taps his watch
We gotta go help Neck's uncle
All right
You never said your name
Mud
You can call me Mud
Mud

Neckbone tosses the braided rope back
It lands at his feet
Here you go, Mud
think you need that worse than  do

The boys disappear back into the trees

In theory

' /    -  35 Ellis and Neckbone sit on the tailgate of Galen's truck
The Gary's Electric sign hangs behind them
Neckbone focuses on a carburetor in his hand
Ellis stares across the street at the Piggly Wiggly parking lot where the roving  of  have collected for the afternoon
The Teenagers are up to their typical gossip and minor offenses
Ellis has zeroed in on May Pearl again
You start datin'  bet her dad'll give you a free pick-up truck
don't care about that
Ellis watches as the same Skinny Kid from before tries to flirt with her
She's not having it
He pops her bra strap before landing the final straw, a smack on her ass
She turns and swats at him
Seeing this, Ellis is on his feet and crossing the street
What's goin' on
Ellis doesn't turn back
Neckbone reluctantly sets the carburetor down and follows
36
-  36 Stop it
She shoves the Skinny Kid, but he continues laughing
(
) Hey
Ellis taps the Kid on the shoulder
As he turns, Ellis him in the face
The Kid, completely taken off guard, stumbles and trips to the ground
Some older, tougher looking  see this and begin laughing at him
29
Holy shit Pryor, get off your ass
Pryor collects himself and gets off the ground
Ego bruised, he walks off mumbling
The Older Kids keep riding him
May Pearl sizes up Ellis
You didn't have to do that
He was messin' with you
Do  know you
'm Ellis
That's Neck
Neckbone waves by wagging a finger in the air
(') We went to Junior High with you, before you went to High School
How old are you
Fourteen
Fourteen
You know you just punched a Senior
So
You think you're pretty tough
Ellis shrugs, not wanting to deny it
(') 'm May Pearl
know
What else do you know
Nothin'
She smiles
30
Something catches Neckbone's attention
He cranes his neck forward to get a better look
Son of a bitch
Ellis
Ellis breaks away from his conversation with May Pearl
What
Look
Neckbone nods to a cheap motel called the located on the opposite side of the Piggly Wiggly parking lot
(35), a truly beautiful woman squeezed into tight jeans and a low cut top, makes her way from the motel parking lot to the Piggly Wiggly
She passes in front of the cluster of Teenagers
All of the boys have taken note
Some cat calls from the crowd
Juniper, without facing the Teenagers, gives them the finger
(') You ever seen that girl before
No
Did you see her hands
Hello
Ellis catches himself and turns back to May Pearl
Sorry
We know a guy we think might know that girl
Oh
(17) of May Pearl's calls out to her
May Pearl
Let's go
Okay
guess 'll see you
30A
If you can find my phone number, you should call it
31
can find it
May Pearl walks over to her friend
Ellis watches her go, but then remembers Juniper
He turns to Neckbone
(') Where'd she go
Into the Piggly Wiggly
She came from the motel
'm gonna go see if it's her
gotta go check on Galen
We'll pick you up out front
Ellis heads for the Piggly Wiggly
Neckbone calls after him
(') What'd she say
Wants me to call her
Shit
37
-  37 Ellis walks past the grocery aisles looking for the girl
He spots her by the potato chips
He tucks behind a display of stacked cans and watches
Juniper reaches for a bag of chips, birds tattooed on her hand
Ellis smiles
It's her, and she really is beautiful
She turns down the aisle, coming right for him
He pretends to peruse the canned food and notices that it's a big display of Beanie Weenie
He grabs two handfuls as she passes
Ellis takes the cans to an open register
As a  scans and bags his items, he cranes his neck looking for her
She's disappeared into another section of the store
Ellis pays in crumpled cash
horn
He sees Galen's truck idling out front
He grabs the bag and runs out
38
' /    -  38 Neckbone waits at the open passenger door
Was it her
32
It's her
saw the tattoos
He wasn't lyin'
( ) No he wasn't
39
'  -  39 By the time Ellis makes it back home, the sun has gone from the sky
He crosses the makeshift plank to board his house
(
) Home for dinner
Ellis is startled by his father's voice
Senior sits in a lawn chair under the eaves of the carport
He's hidden in shadow, save for a red glow from the tip of his cigarette
What you hidin' for
ain't hidin'
He notices Senior tip back a pint of liquor and set it at his feet
Ellis opens the screen door leading inside
(') Come over here
Ellis lets the door fall shut and skulks over to a beam that supports the carport
He leans into it
(') You know  love you
Yessir
know
work you hard 'cause life is work
You know that
Yessir
Your Mamma's been talkin' 'bout movin' in town
What's that mean
33
She seems set on it
Wants to separate
She may ask me for a divorce
This hits Ellis like a ton of bricks
He rights himself
What's that mean for me
It means enjoy the river son
Enjoy it while you live on it, 'cause this way a life isn't long for this world
Game and fish's 'bout made certain of that
But you and me can still live out here
Game and fish can't take your boat
Not while you're still in it
The houseboat's in your mother's name
Her daddy give it to her not me
If she wants to leave it, Game and Fish has ever' right to take this boat apart board by board
But that ain't right
You work outta here
We got the ice machine, the traps
What are we supposed to do
Like  said, this is your mother's business
ain't no townie
ain't livin' like that
Senior takes a slow pull off the bottle
Ellis' mind races
've let you down
man should be in charge of his own affairs, but haven't worked it like that
But ya'll are married
Ya'll are s'posed to love each other
don't know about that anymore
34
Ellis is speechless
After a moment, he turns to go inside
(') Ellis
He stops and turns back to his father
Senior tries to express a sentiment he doesn't have the words for
Ellis continues inside
40
'  -  -  40 Mary Lee sits hunched at the made dinner table
She runs her finger around the rim of a half empty glass of iced tea
It's a full spread with fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and a salad
The table is set for two
She's been waiting
Ellis lets the front door slam shut behind him
She sits up
You're late
Ellis doesn't speak, he doesn't look at her
He enters his room and shuts the door
He's heard the news and she knows it
Mary Lee's face drops
41
'  -  41 Ellis slings his backpack down, pacing the small room
He stops and leans his forehead against the door
The sound of his Mother clearing the table seeps through
He kicks the door, cracking its shitty composite wood
His face flushed and his breathing heavy, he slides to a seat
On the verge of hyperventilating, he stares out the dark bedroom window trying to get control of his breathing
Ellis looks at his backpack
It has spilled open revealing a can of Beanie Weenie
Ellis studies the can
He looks back to the window
His breathing settles
Quickly, he scoops up the backpack and heads out the window
42
-  42 It's pitch black
The only light comes from the moon's reflection off the surface of the water
Ellis, eyes wide, navigates the small boat through choppy black water
35
43
-  43 Ellis struggles to pull the boat onto shore
Leaving it half in the water, Ellis looks around
No sign of Mud
He sizes up the dark woods
He removes a flashlight from his backpack and shines it down the shorelines
Still nothing
Ellis follows the beam of light into the woods
44
-  44 Ellis stands at the creek that cuts through the island
He can make out a campfire glowing through trees in the distance
behind him
He swings the light around
Nothing but trees
Ellis takes a deep breath
Finding the log to cross, he shines his light down into the creek
The nest of snakes show their backs
45
-  45 campfire burns at the base of the tree
The firelight illuminates the belly of the boat that rests 20 feet above
Ellis, his flashlight off, crouches behind a tree and watches the campsite
There is no one there
He looks into the black forest behind him, thinks of going back
twig snaps in the distance and he's back on guard
Ellis nervously scans the woods before finally stepping into the light of the campfire
The  of a gun's hammer drawing back  behind him
Ellis freezes
Mud emerges from the trees, a
45 extended toward Ellis' back
Ellis
Ellis, still frozen, slowly turns to him
Mud huffs out a laugh and drops the pistol to his side
(') What're you doin' out here
Ellis slowly raises the backpack in his hand
got you some Beanie Weenie
Mud tucks the pistol into his jeans and accepts the backpack
36
appreciate that, but  didn't expect you out here at night
Mud takes a seat on the log and transfers the cans into his own duffel bag
He holds up a can of the Beanie Weenie
(') Look at that
You really know how to do somebody right
didn't wanna say anything before, but it's hard to make a meal out of pumpkin pie filling
That's all my mom had
'm not complainin'
Can  get one of those
They're yours to begin with
Ellis sits as Mud hands him a can
They eat
missed my dinner
That's good right
( ) You been out here too long
Mud laughs
Finishing the can, he takes a half-smoked cigarette from his shirt pocket
He pulls a twig from the fire for a light
(') The girl you're waitin' on, she's your girlfriend
Juniper
Yeah
How'd you meet her
We grew up together
Do you love her
37
do
The first time  saw her was on this river
Just up from here
She saved my life
From the snake bite
That's right
was younger than you are now, but when  came to in the hospital and she was there, it was like the world split open, came back together new
Everything changed
knew from then on 'd do anything for her
Why aren't ya'll married
've asked
Several times
Marriage just doesn't work for some people
Ellis thinks on this
My dad says my parents may be gettin' a divorce
'm sorry to hear that
If it happens, and my mom moves us off the river, they say the government can come take our boat away
Who says that
Everybody
They passed a law so you can't sell your boat
Can't rent it
If the owner leaves, they got you
Game and Fish want `em off the river
've never been one to trust the government on matters of personal property, but if your parents love each other, there's always a chance
() 38
(') People just sometimes forget why they fell in love in the first place
Ellis watches Mud toke the cigarette nub
He's really getting all he can from it
saw Juniper today
What
didn't talk to her, but she had the birds tattooed on her hand like you said
You were right
She's pretty
Mud stands, surprised by the news
He walks to the other side of the fire so his back is to the boy
Where'd you see her
At the Piggly Wiggly
think she's stayin' at a motel by there
The Executive Inn
Mud looks at Ellis through the fire
He takes a drag and smiles at the boy
The hole from his missing tooth shows
That's good news
Real good news
Mud paces, slowly
He's thinking
Does she know you're out here
No
We picked another place to meet
Couple days from now
Mud walks back to the log and sits
You wanna go tonight
can give you a ride up river
Mud looks at Ellis, nodding
Tomorrow
'll go tomorrow
39
You need me to come get you
Naw
can manage
Hell  got out here didn't
Ellis smiles
They sit in silence
Ellis stares up at the boat hanging over them, its peeling hull lit by the firelight
Mud pinches the ash from the end of his cigarette, places the stub back in his shirt pocket
Noticing Ellis, Mud tilts his head back to take in the boat
(') It's a helluva thing
Mud pauses, his mind working on something
(') Helluva thing
The two sit by the campfire staring up at the suspended boat
46
'  -  46 Mary Lee knocks on her way into the bedroom
Time to get up
She begins picking clothes off the floor
Ellis, in bed, raises up on his elbows
He's tired from a late night
It's Saturday
'm going to Wal-Mart
need you to come with me
() Mom
Come on
She pulls the covers off of him
47 /
' / -  47 The two ride in an awkward silence
40
Ellis stares at the farmland passing by outside as Mary Lee steers the compact Toyota down a four-lane interstate
Ellis  know what your father told you last night
That's not what wanted
wanted to sit you down and talk about it
What do you wanna talk about
You want to leave and that means they can tear up our house
've spent my whole life on that boat
don't think it's too much to ask for your
Mary Lee is interrupted by a line of traffic backed up in front of her
She slows to a stop
(') Oh no
hope no one's hurt
There are flashing police lights up ahead
Ellis tries to see what's going on but can't make anything out past the line of cars
They inch forward
(') 'm just saying there are two sides to this
haven't made up my mind about anything because  want you to be involved in my decision, but need a change Ellis
deserve one
As they approach the flashing lights, they see three State Trooper vehicles parked to funnel traffic down to one lane
The   stop each car, checking the trunks
(') think they're searching people
Trooper signals Mary Lee to pull up to a stop
Two other Troopers approach her vehicle
The first begins looking in her back windows as the second leans down to speak to her
She lowers her window
Can you open the trunk please ma'am
Of course
41
Mary Lee pulls the lever by her knee, and the second Trooper walks around the back of the car
Have you picked up or seen any hitchhikers today ma'am
No sir
The Trooper produces a flier with a color photo on it
Have you seen this man
No sir
The Trooper leans over and holds the paper out to Ellis
Son, have you seen this man
Ellis looks at the photo
It's of Mud
He looks exactly the same as he did last night, down to the shirt
In the photo, Mud's smiling, revealing his missing tooth
No
We've had reports that he's in this area
If you see him, call 9-1-1 immediately
We will officer
The Trooper pulls his head from the window
What'd he do
The Trooper bends back down and looks at Ellis
(') ( ) What'd he do
Move along please
Mary Lee pulls forward and speeds back up on the interstate
My lord
(rolls up her window) () 42
(') How would you feel about moving into town with me
( ) Please don't tell your father this, but 've been looking at a couple of places
know it would be a big adjustment for you, but it might end up being something you like
You know living on the river isn't exactly everyone's idea of the good life
Ellis
He looks at her
(') Are you even listening to me
48
'  -  48 Ellis busts through the door, grabs his backpack and is gone
49
-  49 Ellis is off the houseboat and running up the bank
He heads down the dirt path, grabbing the Walkie Talkie out of his backpack
(into the Walkie) Neck
Neck, pick up
50
-  50 Ellis removes branches and readies the flat bottom boat to launch
The sound of Neckbone's bike arrives before he does
Neckbone crests the sand covered slope
He dismounts and starts to chain the bike up to a tree trunk
So what's the big deal
My mom and  were headed to Wal- Mart on 165
There was a roadblock with state troopers
They searched our car and showed us a picture of Mud
They're lookin' for him
knew it
told you that crazy sonofabitch was trouble
Did they say what he did
No
43
So'd you tell `em where he is
No
That's why  called you
We gotta warn him
What
He's goin' to get Juniper today went out there last night and told him where we saw her
He needs to know people are lookin' for him
You think he doesn't know that already
Jesus Ellis, why do you think he's on that island
You don't even know what he's wanted for
Ellis climbs in the boat and Neckbone yanks his shoulder
(') Ellis
'm serious
We don't know who this guy is
He loves her Neck
He told me
don't give a shit who he loves
Ellis starts the motor and waits for his friend
He's not dangerous
Reluctantly, Neckbone throws his leg into the boat
It sounds like a shitload of state troopers think different
51
-  51 Ellis and Neckbone emerge from the woods at Mud's campsite
They scan nearby tree limbs
No tellin' where the hell he's been sleepin'
He may already be gone
44
(
) Hey
The boys look straight up
Mud leans over the edge of the boat above them
(') Up here
Mud drops them a rope with knots tied in it
Ellis starts inching his way up
Neckbone begrudgingly follows
52
-  52 Ellis pulls himself over the edge of the boat
He finds Mud sitting in the swivel chair behind the steering wheel
He writes in an open spiral notebook with a black Sharpie
What are you doin'
'm gonna have to go back on our deal for the boat
don't feel good about it, but  don't see any other way outta what 'm into
Neckbone makes his way on board
Mud has pulled a panel off the steering column
Exposed wires dangle
So you know about the state troopers
He looks up from his notebook
What state troopers
The ones spreadin' your picture all over the place
Stoppin' cars on 165 searchin' for your ass
Mud factors this in and then goes back to writing
didn't know about that, but it doesn't surprise me
There plenty of folks lookin' for me right now
Why
shot a man
Killed him
45
Mud stands and walks to the back of the boat
The boys' eyes follow him cautiously
Mud lifts a hatch at the back that would typically house the batteries and engine wiring
There's nothing left but a hole into the trees
He makes a note
(') 'm sorry  didn't tell ya'll sooner, but  was hopin' to be gone before anything came of it
Didn't want you involved
Mud turns to really face them for the first time
(') Ya'll have been real good to me
You're the only friends  got out here
If the state troopers have 165 blocked, they'll have others blocked too
won't get anywhere in a car
want to try takin' this boat down, see if we can get it in the water
Ellis and Neckbone stand their ground
They don't say anything
Mud walks back to the steering column
He drops to his knees and fiddles with the wires
(') With a boat like this  can make it to the gulf in two days
could get anywhere from there
But 'd need a boat at least this big to make it on open water
It's got no title, no owner, nobody lookin' for it
It's my best shot
Who'd you kill
It was a bad piece of business
Ya'll don't need to hear about it
need to hear about it
Mud sits up
He looks at Ellis, deciding how much to tell
Juniper made a mistake
She hooked up with a guy
He was no good
His name was Hutchins
Family owns a chain of restaurants down in Texas
46
Where were you
was around, but me and Juniper were on the outs
She met this Hutchins, he sold her on some lies
Got her pregnant
That's when he started showin' who he really was
He dropped June down a flight of stairs after whoopin' her half to death
She lost the baby
He made it so the doctors think she can't have children anymore
There're things you can get away with in this world and things you can't tracked him down at a motel just outside of San Antonio
He was there with another woman
That's where it happened
Mud's done with his story
He goes back to the wiring
(') understand if you can't help me anymore, but  need this boat
And need to get it in the water fast
After a moment, he sits up and wipes sweat from his forehead
(') 've made a list
Things we'll need
What do ya'll think
Ellis takes time to consider everything
He looks at Neckbone, who has a disgruntled look on his face
You did it for her
To protect her
Yeah
Ellis nods
Mud looks over at Neckbone, who still has the disgruntled look on his face
(') What do you think
think you want us to run around, stickin' our necks out, gettin' everything you need, just so you can take our boat
47
That's about it
Mud removes a cigarette butt and sparks it with a lighter
What do we get out of it
What do you want
Neckbone looks to Ellis, judging his bargaining position
What about that pistol
Mud eyes the boy, pulling on the nub of cigarette
only got two things out here worth anything
This shirt
Mud pulls the pistol from the back of his jeans
Neckbone tenses, but relaxes when Mud splays it out on an open palm
(') And this pistol
can't give you the shirt `cause  need it for protection, but if you help me get this boat in the water, the pistol's yours
Neckbone squinches his face in thought, sizing up this trade
What kind is it
forty five
guess we could work a deal like that
Neckbone steps forward to grab the pistol, but Mud puts it back in his jeans
We get this thing floatin' first
Neckbone looks over at Ellis, who shrugs
All right then
48
Mud smiles, flashing his missing tooth
He spits in his palm and holds it out to Neckbone
Neckbone, not sure about taking the spit hand, reluctantly shakes
Mud rips a page from the notebook and hands it to Ellis
Ya'll scrounge what you can off this list, but if we're gonna get this done right we'll need more help
Can you fetch Tom for me
Tom Blankenship
Mud has smoked down to the filter
He crushes the butt into his palm and puts it back in his shirt pocket
was hopin' to let that old assassin stay put, but we'll need him to get things ya'll can't
Can you find him
know where he lives, but 've never spoke to him
Just tell him my name
He'll know you're serious
Ellis folds the list up
He and Neckbone start down the rope as Mud goes back to the wiring
(') Boys
( ) Thanks
Ellis nods
Don't lose my pistol
They continue down the rope
Mud continues his work
53
'  -  53 Ellis steers to the southern mouth of Shelly's Oxbow, the bend in the river that holds he and Tom Blankenship's houseboats, among others
He grounds the boat just shy of entering the Oxbow and steps over Neckbone to hop onto the bank
49
You comin'
'll watch the boat
Ellis scans the woods that populate the patch of land wedged between the river and this short tributary
(') Ellis
What
Be careful
Galen always said that old man's crazy
Neckbone keeps his seat as Ellis darts into the woods 54
'  -  54 Ellis prowls around the small pine trees and bushes
He pauses, seeing the entrance to Tom Blankenship's boat
Something moves on the houseboat
Ellis hunkers down behind a bush
He sees Tom wrapping cable onto a metal spool
Ellis is nervous
He checks over his shoulder, nothing but woods
When he looks back to the boat, Tom is gone
In a crouch, Ellis moves closer
Taking a deep breath, Ellis steps out from the cover of the pine trees and heads up a walkway that leads onboard
(
) Why you huntin' me
Ellis flinches
He turns to find Tom Blankenship standing at the edge of the boat
(') You deaf boy
said why're you huntin' me
ain't huntin you
What's your business here
came to find you
got a message for you
50
You're Senior's boy
Yessir
What you got to say he can't tell me himself
Tom, rusty on pleasantries, brushes past Ellis as he heads inside the boat
It ain't from him
Ellis, not wanting to follow further, shouts from the planks
(') There is a silence
Then footsteps
Tom reappears
Mud sent you
Yessir
What do you know about it
He asked me to come get you
Tom straightens his back
He looks into the woods, searching for something he may have missed
Your daddy know this
No sir
Mud needs your help
Tom's mind churns on a series of facts unknown to the boy
Where is he
55
-  55 Neckbone bounces in the boat as it shifts in the choppy Mississippi water
His eyes are locked on the back of Tom's head
Tom rides stone faced in the front
Neckbone turns back to Ellis and raises his eyebrows as if to ask, "What's going on
"
Ellis shrugs
51
56
-  56 Ellis runs the boat on shore
Tom splashes into the ankle deep water and helps the boys drag it onto the bank
Ellis takes the lead, walking ahead and scanning the treeline
Mud steps out, just past the shadow of the woods
Ellis turns to Tom and points
There he is
Tom spits onto the muddy bank and makes his way toward Mud
Ellis and Neckbone stay by the boat and watch
, Mud watches Tom approaching
He corrects his posture and feebly attempts to smooth some wrinkles from his shirt
Tom stops in front of him, his eyes pinched in the sun
Mud
Sir
They stare at each other for a long moment
Neither one flinching
, At this distance, the boys can't hear what is being said, but they try and size up the situation through body language
You think that's his dad
don't know
, Where is she
In town
Got here yesterday
Tom lowers his head
Frustrated
Why you out here like this
, 52
The boys see Mud take a seat on a nearby stump
He's explaining something
Tom listens, standing over him
They don't look like family
Ellis watches Mud as he gestures and speaks
He seems different
Younger
Mud stops talking
Tom scratches a hand through his white crew cut
He begins pointing a finger at Mud
His face is flushed and the sound of his voice carries to the boys, though still unintelligible
(') He's really givin' it to him
, Mud's head hangs as Tom shouts at him
You've spent your whole life followin' that girl
She's run you halfway cross the country and back, and for what
For this, left out on an island beggin' for help murderer
thief
ain't no thief
What would you call it then
Don't even mention draggin' those boys into this
Do you have any idea what you're doin'
Waits for a response, but Mud gives none
(') 'm ashamed of you
Mud looks up at him
(') Don't expect help from me
There's none to be given
, They see Tom turn his back on Mud and head toward the boat
Mud doesn't protest; he doesn't move
Tom brushes past Ellis
53
(') 'm ready
Tom shoves the boat back into the water
Neckbone helps him
Ellis looks back at Mud, who still hasn't moved from his stump
He goes to him
Tom sees this and stops pushing
(') ( ) Dammit
, Ellis stops a good six feet back from where Mud sits
You all right
Mud raises his head
Looks like we're on our own
He stands and takes a folded piece of paper from his shirt
(') didn't want you bein' the one to do this, but  can't see a way around it
need to get this letter to Juniper
Could you take it to her for me
Yeah
You have to be careful
You can't just walk up and knock on her door, you hear me
You have to watch yourself
can handle it
Ellis steps forward and Mud hands over the note
Ellis takes it and walks back to the others
, Tom stares at Ellis as he climbs on board
Tom looks back at Mud, who is watching him
He gives the boat a final shove before pulling himself in
They motor away
Tom doesn't look back
54
57
/'  -  -  57 You Mud's daddy
Mud didn't have no daddy
No mother  ever knew of
He was livin' in the woods when  met him
Younger than you are now
Tom doesn't offer anymore
Neckbone thinks on his answer
Ellis kills the engine near the mouth of Shelly's Oxbow
Tom jumps down into the knee deep river and wades onto shore
He turns back to the boys
(') Ya'll need to watch yourselves

Neckbone reads Mud's letter to Juniper
Ellis reaches the bank where they stash their boat
He shuts off the motor and let's them drift
Neckbone folds the letter back up and turns to face Ellis
What do you think
He loves her
You can tell that much
You gonna take it to her

Neckbone thinks about this seriously, shakes his head

Cars and Trucks  and zip by them
Their speed is topped out at about 15 miles per hour
Mostly a result of the small 3X4 metal trailer they are towing behind the bike
One of Senior's white fish coolers sits in the trailer

Neckbone straddles the dirt bike
handful of cars are parked at the motel; an old Honda, a pick-up, and a
say we start at the top, work our way down
All right
They each grab an end of the cooler and carry it across the lot toward a flight of stairs
61    , 61 The boys set the cooler down in front of the first room on the corner
Ellis checks over his shoulder, nothing strange
Ellis knocks
They wait
No answer
They pick the cooler up and walk to the next door
Knock
After a moment, a   in his late sixties opens the door wearing boxers and an undershirt
What you want
We're sellin' fish
You wanna buy some
Fish
He looks at the two boys like they are insane
(') don't want no damn fish
56
He slams the door
They drag the cooler to the next door
As Ellis holds up his fist to knock, they hear a woman shouting a few doors down
(
) Ellis heads for the room
Neckbone drags the cooler after him
Ellis reaches the motel room door, which has been left ajar
He places his hand on it and lets it fall open

She's crumpled up in a ball at the end of the bed
Carver swats open-handed at her head
Grabs the top of her hair
(') You hear me bitch
Tell me another lie
Ellis rushes Carver with his shoulder as if he were breaking down a door
Carver is knocked off balance
He trips over the edge of the bed and crashes into the motel room wall
Carver, slightly stunned, gets to his feet and in two broad steps lands a man-sized punch across Ellis' face
It's hard
Ellis melts
He grabs the boy up by the scruff of his shirt
(') Who are you
Who the hell are you
Did he send you
Carver removes a piece of paper from his pocket
It's a photo copied picture of Mud, different than the State Trooper's
Carver crams the photo in the boy's face
(') You know this man
Look at him
Do you know him
Blood trickles from a cut under Ellis' eye
He stutters under the shaking force of Carver's hands
don't

57
Neckbone is yelling at the top of his lungs, almost in a girl's pitch
Carver turns to him
The cooler is open behind them and Neckbone holds up two Ziplock bags of fish
(') We're just selling fish
Carver sizes things up
It takes a moment, but he settles
He snorts out a laugh and drops Ellis on the ground
Carver turns his attention back to Juniper, who is huddled up in the corner of the motel
Carver walks over to her
Opening a good-sized knife, he gets down in her face and holds the blade uncomfortably close to her cheek
know you know where he is
And swear to God 'll cut through every one a you to find him
She flinches
Standing, Carver folds up his knife
(') We know you came here for him, and we know he's too stupid to leave you behind
So when he pops his head out of whatever shithole he's staying in, 'll be there
You tell him that
Carver turns, stepping over Ellis on his way out
(') And you need to mind your business boy
Neckbone moves from the doorway to let him pass
Carver is gone
Neckbone shuts the door and fastens the security latch
He kneels down to check on his friend
You all right
Yeah
He popped your eye
Ellis holds the back of his hand up to his eye which has begun to swell
The cut trickles blood over his cheekbone
Juniper moves to the sink
Ellis sits up, staring at her back
58
She opens an ice bucket and wraps a handful of cubes in a towel
She turns and walks over to them, her eyes cast down
She kneels in front of Ellis, making eye contact for the first time
She touches his chin, gently pivoting it to see the wound
Her eyes are glassy
Thank you
He stares back at her
He can't take his eyes off her
She holds the iced towel to his cheek
He doesn't even flinch
(') 'm so sorry
Tears form and run down her cheeks
(') Here
She takes his hand and places it against the towel
She gets to her feet and pulls a pocket book from a bag in the corner
(') How much is your fish
'll buy the cooler full
Ellis motions Neckbone to the cooler
Neckbone goes over and crams his hand into the ice
He removes a Ziplock bag containing the note that Mud sent
Neckbone hands it to Ellis
Taking the note, he sets his ice down and walks over to Juniper
Mud sent us to give this to you
Juniper is stunned
She looks at the bag, then at the boys
You've met Mud
Ellis nods
Neckbone speaks up from the back
Yeah we met him
Juniper takes the bag
She removes the letter and takes a seat on the edge of the bed to read it
Ellis watches her eyes move along the paper
She smiles, which makes Ellis smile
After a moment, she folds it up
He tells me to hold tight
59
Yeah, we read it
Juniper raises her eyebrows at Neckbone
Well do you know how long `hold tight' is
think it's a couple days
He wants to get a boat for ya'll
God
Juniper shakes her head and goes to the sink
She pulls a lighter from her jeans pocket and torches Mud's note
(') Tell him 'll wait
Running water over the ashes, she turns back to them
(') But  don't want ya'll involved
Tell him what  said and make that it
don't want you gettin' in any trouble
We won't
What do you call that
She motions to his swelling eye
Ellis shrugs
We'll be all right
Keep your door locked
We'll be in touch
Ellis heads to the door as Neckbone gathers up the cooler
Wait
Ellis turns back
(') What's your name
'm Ellis
That's Neckbone
60
Juniper walks up to Ellis and puts her hands on his shoulders
She has to bend slightly to do it, but she kisses him just above his swollen eye
Thank you Ellis
Ellis stares at her, infatuated
We gotta go
Ellis turns and grabs one end of the cooler
Neckbone slaps back the security latch and opens the door with his free hand
They walk out

It's quiet
He sees a note on the counter next to a can of soup
It reads, "'ve gone to a movie
Warm up some soup for dinner
Love, Mom"
Ellis picks up the can, not thrilled
He goes to the fridge and grabs a sack of peas from the freezer
Holding the peas against his eye he takes a seat at the counter and flips through a phone book
He finds what he needs and dials a corded phone
He waits

Hey, it's Ellis

Mud's face turns dark
Ellis rushed him
Got smacked for it

Looked like a cowboy

Mud slings the rope to the ground and kicks it
His face is flushed
It's the first time the boys have seen him angry

Mud takes a deep breath, tries to cool down
It takes a moment, then something occurs to him
He eyes Ellis with a look of genuine gratitude

Ellis nods
Mud picks up the rope

Brother of the man  shot
If he's here, then more are comin'

Mud gathers the supplies and heads to the treeline
The boys, with their hands full, follow him
Bounty hunters
Carver's rotten, but his daddy's the one to be scared of
He'll spend all the money he has to see me dead
If it was up to me 'd put the whole family down same as the other
Not a decent man between `em
Mud stops and turns to lay a serious look on them

Ellis, can you climb up that trunk and get these hung
Yeah
Take a foot of line and tie `em off with a bowline knot
You know it
'm not stupid
Ellis takes the pulley and scales the trunk without hesitation
Mud tosses his pocket knife to Neckbone
Neck, start cuttin' line
Three fifteen foot sections
Count a foot long as your arm
Mud begins threading the pulleys with rope
As Neckbone cuts rope, he sees the pistol stuck in the back of Mud's pants
What's so special `bout that shirt you'd lose your pistol for it
It's got a wolf's eye sewn in the sleeve
More protection than a bullet ever gave
Tom swears by it
He said he wasn't your daddy
Tom's the closest thing  ever knew to a father
never met my parents
It's hard not knowin' the ones you came from
My uncle Galen tells me things about `em
He's the one that takes care of me
Tom did that for me
65
Ellis drops down to the deck and grabs another pulley
What'd you mean when you called Tom an assassin
Tom's had lives you'd never know about
Grew up up North

For a long time he was a paid killer for the
Lived in Cuba in `63
He's probably killed more people than you've met

Neckbone and Ellis stand on the ground staring up at him

Well if you're gonna do it do it
Mud takes a deep breath and yanks the cord
Angled on one of the main branches holding up the boat, Mud begins cutting
Ellis and Neckbone step further and further back as they watch the chainsaw work through the thick limb
Suddenly, the chainsaw stops

The huge branch , tumbling off lower limbs before crashing to the ground
Mud holds onto the trunk for dear life
The branch now rests on the ground,

How long have you known Mud
Few days
Well that's long enough to know he's full of shit
So it's not true

In Mud's world, that makes me an assassin
Not exactly true, right
Yeah  guess
Tom notices the boy's disappointment
71
You think he's a bad ass don't you
don't know
You know why he's stuck out on that island
Yeah
() He shot somebody
He tell you why he shot that man
Because he hurt Juniper
Right
The real reason Mud's in the trouble he's got is because of her
He's been in love with that girl since he was your age
They used to run all around here and it was the same back then
He'd follow that girl wherever she led him
Problem is she don't care about nobody but herself
've told him as much
She'd bed down with the meanest snake she could find, then when things went bad she'd go runnin' to Mud
Mud would take her back, then go find whatever unlucky sonofabitch last put a hand on her and beat `em `til they knew to never touch her again
And this time  guess he thought a beating wasn't good enough
Had to shoot that fella
don't know for sure, but 'd put money on Juniper knowin' he'd do it
And  have a suspicion she might of even told him to
Either way, those two are set for failure
Only chance Mud has is to cut her loose

Ellis and Neckbone stand by the trailer looking less than thrilled
It's covered in junk and debris
You touch her breast
little
That's great man
Thanks
Ellis walks up and knocks a stack of bricks off the trailer
(') We could take it apart
Bring it out piece by piece
It's welded
We'd just tear it up
What if we float it out
With what
Come on
Neckbone walks to the trailer
Ellis follows
B85
'  -  B85 The boys open the front door and are met by a
Jesus
They squint and shield their eyes
The light shuts off as quickly as it came on
Galen stands in front of them wearing his wet suit
The bar with the flood lights attached sits across his shoulders
The boys rub their eyeballs, seeing spots
Galen shuffles over to the couch holding a marine battery connected to the lights
He labors to take a seat
What do you think
79A
That's real good Galen
( ) Gimme a minute
Neckbone, still blinking, goes back to his room
Ellis notices Galen staring at him
Galen pats the couch
Come `ere Ellis
Ellis takes a seat on the other end of the couch
Galen pats the spot next to him
Ellis scoots over, uncomfortable
(') ( ) You see that ceiling fan
Yeah
found it in the river
Works great
Best ceiling fan 've ever owned
This river brings a lotta trash down it
Some a that trash is worth a lotta money, some of it's not
You gotta know what's worth keepin' and what's worth lettin' go
You know the difference
think so
Neck looks up to you
Don't get my nephew into anything you can't get him out of
Galen forces a stare with Ellis, who nods
Neckbone enters as Galen begins to remove his light rig
(') Help Me Rhonda's just about a guy needing to get a piece to get over a girl that put one over on him
So you get your heart broke, don't walk around with a shit look on your face
Get back in there
Get your tip wet
You hear me
What
You know what 'm sayin'
79B
Ellis doesn't
Galen moves to an electric guitar leaning by a small amp in the corner
(') Ya'll wanna hang out
Alan's comin' over
We're gonna pump it up
We got stuff to do
Whatever
The boys exit as Galen turns on the amp
C85
'  -  C85 Galen pumps it up inside as Neckbone and Ellis walk to the boat trailer
Neckbone pulls a handful of long zip ties from his back pocket
What were ya'll talkin' about
don't know
86
-  86 Mud's knife slices through a plastic zip tie
King
That's what they call him
rests atop , 55- affixed with plastic zip ties
The make-shift raft is half on shore with the back still floating in the water
The boys watch as Mud walks around the trailer cutting off the zip ties
The barrels kick out from underneath the trailer as this happens
(') He's their father
You didn't go near him did you
No
Good
That left-handed sonofabitch is the devil himself
If he's here, then it's time
We need to get Juniper out here
79C
We still need a motor
There's a motor in the scrap yard might work
need one that runs
Mud moves to the front of the boat trailer and begins dragging it fully onto the bank
It's heavy
can get it runnin'
Tell him Ellis
It's true
He built his own dirt bike
All right then
Give it a shot
don't know
That motor's worth somethin'
It's not like this other junk
80
It's been there for months
Nobody's even gonna know it's gone
Ellis hesitates
He looks to Mud
We do need a motor
Ellis thinks on it as Mud takes a deep breath and grabs the trailer again
87
-  87 The supermarket is busy
Ellis stands at a pay phone out front as Neckbone kicks a vending machine nearby
Ellis looks at Juniper's motel
He scans the Piggly Wiggly parking lot and spots Carver's black Lincoln
Ellis picks up the phone and deposits some change
He dials
wanna talk to room 212
88 /
'  /  -  88 Juniper watches  (o
s) at the foot of the bed
The phone rings
She snaps up, hits mute and grabs it
Hello
, Juniper
Ellis
It's me
Thank god
've been goin' crazy in this room
Is Mud okay
Yeah
It's time to take you out to him
Now
Tomorrow
We'll come get you
81
What's goin' on
He's got a plan for ya'll to get away
Be ready tomorrow at five
Neckbone'll be waitin' at the back of the motel with a dirt bike
They're watching my room
'll take care of that
Just be ready at five
Wait
Just wait
don't know about alla this
don't even know what he thinks we're gonna do
Where are we even gonna go
This is Mud
This is what Mud does
Ellis hears her crying through the phone
It's okay
He's got the boat
We helped him fix it up
It's a good plan
Just be ready
Why are you even doing this
What do you mean
Why are you helping us
Cause ya'll love each other
Juniper searches for a comment
Ellis, looking out over the parking lot, sees May Pearl getting out of a car with her  and
(') 'll see you tomorrow
Wait
Dial Tone
Juniper holds the phone, worried
82
89
-  89 Ellis turns and watches May Pearl push a cart in the parking lot with her family
Neckbone bangs at the Coke machine
How'd it go
We're good
90 /
' /    -  90 Carver sits behind the wheel of his Lincoln
The man with the mustache, James, sits in the passenger seat next to him
Carver notices Ellis and Neckbone standing in front of the Piggly Wiggly
He climbs out
, Gimme a quarter
This shit took mine
Ellis watches May Pearl entering the grocery store
He calls out with a wave
Without stopping, May Pearl, along with her Sister and Mother, all turn
May Pearl sees him, but doesn't wave back
She continues inside
Ellis looks confused, then embarrassed
Neckbone notices
It's all right man
She's with her family
Come on
wanna get that motor before dark
They head to the dirt bike
(
) Hey there
Ellis turns to see Carver approaching
(') You remember me don't you
Ellis nods
Carver notes the healing bruise on Ellis' face
(') 'm sure sorry about that
Ya'll caught me at a real bad time
83
Ellis climbs on the bike
Carver walks over to them
(') Hold on now
One second
don't want ya'll thinkin' 'm a bad guy
Ya'll were just trying to do a job, and  got in your way
Carver removes a roll of twenties and peels off two
(') Let's just say  bought that whole batch of fish ya'll were sellin'
Would forty cover it
That'd bout do it
We don't want your money
Carver steps in close to the boys
bet ya'll really get around this town
Probably know every hole and ditch
Have ya'll come across the man whose picture  showed you
No
Carver removes a flier with Mud's picture and holds it out
You sure about that
Take a look with your good eye
'm sure
What about that girl in the motel
The pretty one
Ya'll talk to her some more
No
Carver smiles
He tucks the flier and the forty dollars into Ellis' hand
There's a number on there
Ya'll let me know if you do
84
Neckbone cranks the engine and backs the bike up with his feet
They pull away
Moving, Ellis looks back to see Carver watching them
91
'  -  91 Neckbone pulls back a loose section of chain-link fence surrounding the marine junkyard
Ellis crouches through
, Ellis and Neckbone creep through piles of starboard and boat parts
They stop at a party barge with only one pontoon
At its rear hangs a big rusted motor, 200 horsepower
Neckbone quickly disassembles its attachment
The motor pops loose leaving the boys to strain against its heavy weight
They ease it to the ground
Jesus that's heavy
The boys get on either side of the motor and begin half- dragging it back to the fence line
, (10) dangles her feet off a loading platform and bites at an ice cream sandwich
She watches Neckbone and Ellis from a distance
92
'  -  92 Ellis walks onto the houseboat as the sound of Neckbone's bike fades in the trees
He stops, noticing a sitting on the water's edge of the boat
He goes over to it
He opens the sack and takes a quick inventory
loaf of bread, potted meats, a bottle of Jack Daniels, a roll of cash, and an Arkansas boat tag
Ellis looks around, no one
He looks over to Tom's boat
It's dark
Ellis scoops up the sack and heads inside
93
-   93 The digital wristwatch changes from "4:59" to "5:00"
Neckbone sits on his bike parked near the vending machines at the Piggly Wiggly
Ellis, on the payphone, scans the parking lot
No sign of Carver's Lincoln
No other Bounty Hunters
Where are those bastards
85
don't know
( ) She's not answerin'
What do you wanna do
Take your bike around the side
'll check her room
We'll just have to hope no one sees us
Neckbone cranks the bike and speeds toward the motel
Ellis looks to the motel, then the parking lot
94
-   94 , Ellis cautiously heads up the stairs
He eyes the parking lot at the Piggly Wiggly but still sees no sign of Carver's men
He moves quickly toward Juniper's door
Checking over his shoulder, he knocks
No answer
He knocks again
Nothing
He peeks through the window
No lights
No movement
95    , 95 Neckbone gets off his bike and slips to the corner of the building
As he peeks his head out, Ellis nearly knocks him over on his way downstairs
They both flinch
Shit
Was she there
Nothin'
Ellis notices the front office (') Come on
96
/  -  96 The  (29) doesn't look up from his issue of Lowrider as Ellis and Neckbone enter
Scuse me, sir
Yeah
86
We're lookin' for the girl in room 212
You seen her
've seen her
You see her today
Yeah, she came down askin' for directions to the nearest bar told her to head out to a place on 61
Ellis digests this
They turn to leave
(') Wait a second, are ya'll the little bastards tryin' to sell fish to the guests
They're already out the door
97
-  97 Ellis and Neckbone pull into the gravel lot in front of a roadside bar
The cinder block building sits by itself just off the highway
Cars and motorcycles fill the lot
You think this is it
It's gotta be
98
-  98 The small bar is loud and crowded
Shoulder to shoulder bump against one another as  blares
Neckbone and Ellis press through the crowd searching for Juniper
They are a good foot shorter than anyone else
Ellis notices a man at the bar
It's Miller, the bounty hunter from King's motel
He's staring at something across the room
Ellis follows his line of sight
The crowd weaves in front of him, but then he sees her
Juniper leans against a pool table at the far end of the bar
(32) whispers in her ear and kisses her neck
She throws her head back, laughing
Ellis watches in disbelief
Nearby, the (46) fills a customer's shot glass
The two underage kids catch his attention
87
Ellis' face is frozen, locked on Juniper
Neckbone places a hand on his shoulder
Juniper's eyes drift toward the boys
She makes eye contact with Ellis, and her smile vanishes
The Guy keeps whispering in her ear
Juniper straightens her back slightly
Ellis can't take his eyes off her
Juniper stares back at him, but doesn't make a move
After a moment, Juniper's eyes fall to the floor
She turns her head back to the Guy
The crowd fills back in and the image is out of Ellis' reach
(
) What the hell are ya'll doin'
The Bartender swoops in, grabbing them both by the backs of their necks and shoving them toward the door
Ellis strains against the thick hand
He tries to get another look at Juniper, but it's too crowded
99
-  -  99 The Bartender flings Ellis and Neckbone into the parking lot
Neckbone slides on the loose gravel
Ya'll stay outta here
Ellis just stands staring at the front door
The Bartender makes a swatting motion toward them
(') Neckbone gathers his friend and leads him away
Thanks a lot asshole
( ) Come on man
They head over to Neckbone's dirt bike
He pulls out the key and climbs on
Ellis hesitates
(') 'll take you home
We're gonna have to tell Mud
Neckbone drops his head, nods reluctantly
88
100
-  100 The boys struggle to pull the heavy motor out of their boat
It hits the shoreline with a thud
They lean over it, sucking air
Just leave it
Mud'll have to help get it
What're you gonna tell him
'll just tell him the truth
101
/  -  101 Mud stands at the back of the boat, which now rests on the boat trailer near the water
His face is clean shaven and his hair is wetted back
His shirt, still filthy, is tucked into his pants
He whistles and works by the light of a small fire nearby
Ellis steps out from behind a tree
He's holding the grocery sack that was left on his houseboat
Mud, hearing the voice, quickly puts down his tools and turns to the woods
He smooths his clothes down
What you say there
Ellis appears out of the dark, followed by Neckbone
Mud's eyes search the treeline for Juniper
(') What you say Ellis
Ellis can't look him in the eye
We got that motor
Is Juniper okay
Yeah
Where is she
89
She didn't meet up with us
What happened
Was it Carver
It wasn't Carver
Mud straightens up, prepares for the news
What's goin' on Ellis
She was supposed to meet us on the side of the motel
She never showed up
We went asking for her
The motel clerk told us she went to a bar out on 61
What
We tracked her down
She was there with another guy
() They were together
Mud's face drops
He walks to the fire and shakes a cooking pot resting in the coals
The pot bubbles with roof tar
She probably thought Carver was on to her
She knew the plan Mud
She just didn't show up
What was she doin' with the other guy
Ellis hesitates, not wanting to say
Mud pushes
(') What were they doin' Ellis
They were playin' pool
Drinkin'
He was close up on her
They were laughin'
He kissed her on the neck
Mud nods
90
And that's how it is
He takes the pot of roofing tar over to the boat and begins pasting some of the newly replaced boards with a flat stick
What do you want us to do
Just go home Ellis
Ellis looks at Neckbone, then sets the grocery sack on the ground
Tom left this for you
They slowly retreat into the woods and disappear
Mud turns back to the campfire and shoves the pot into the ashes
His eyes, soft and red, reflect the flame
102
-  102 Ellis and Neckbone motor away from the island in the flat bottom boat
They look back at the shore
You think it's all right to leave him alone
doubt it
Neckbone sees Ellis' concern
(') 'll sleep over at your house tonight
We can check on him first thing tomorrow
Ellis nods
As they head further up river, the island grows smaller, silhouetted by the moonlight
103
'  -  103 Neckbone snores, sprawled out on top of a sleeping bag on the floor
Ellis sits up in bed with something on his mind
He gets up and steps gingerly over Neckbone to exit the room
104
'  -  -  104 The house is silent
Ellis slips into the kitchen and picks up the phone receiver mounted on the cabinet
91
He pulls the cord out to stand with his face in the corner
He dials, waits, and speaks softly into the receiver
Hello
Is May Pearl there
This is Ellis
called yesterday, you give her my message
My name is Ellis
'm her boyfriend
Oh, she's asleep
said she's asleep
The front door flies open
Senior storms headlong toward Ellis
He shouts
Ellis turns as Senior yanks the phone by the cord
It snaps out of Ellis' hand and smashes apart on the floor
Ellis flinches at the sight of his father flying at him
(') What the hell have you been doing
'
Senior grabs Ellis by the arms and shoves him against the den wall
Mary Lee comes running from her room
She slaps at her husband's arms and back
He swats her away
You tell her
You tell her what you've been up to
don't know what you're sayin'
Take your hands off him Senior
Senior keeps Ellis pinned to the wall with his left hand
He opens up and addresses Mary Lee with his right
Crawford said a boat motor went missin' from his stock yard
Said his daughter saw this one and his friend haulin' it off
This makes Mary Lee pause
(') Now you tell me right now, did you steal that motor
92
We didn't steal it
Lie to me again
We thought it was junk
We didn't think it was worth anything
Ellis
cool anger rushes over Senior's face
He releases Ellis and takes a step back
You tell me  raised a thief
'm not a thief
You take property that's not yours
Property that belongs to another man
That junk is his livelihood
'm ashamed of you
Ellis drops his head
His face flushed
Senior
(to Mary Lee) Shut your mouth
You think you can take things and not have him see it
Neither one of you has any respect for a man's livelihood life that puts clothes on your back and food in your stomach
Don't you blame this on me
One doesn't have a thing to do with the other and you know it
Don't tell me what  know
If you can steal a man's life out from under him in front of your son and think he won't take a lesson from it than you're even dumber than you look
Stop it dad
93
Senior volleys a finger at Ellis
She's raisin' you a snake like herself, and you can curl up with her `fore  give a damn
You just remember this when you watch them rip this house apart board by board
You Hear Me
Mary Lee slaps Senior hard
He turns to her, saying nothing
You're a man who's never had the strength to support his own life
never asked you for a thing, and 've never took a thing from you that  couldn't provide for on my own
If they do tear my home apart the only joy 'll have in my heart is knowin' that they'll be tearing you out of my life for good
She wipes her eyes and turns her attention to Ellis
(') Ellis
You'll return that motor from where you found it and you'll apologize in person to the man you took it from
won't hear about anything like this again
Mary Lee walks to the front door
She collects her purse and keys and exits quietly
Senior and Ellis stand in silence, which feels even more uncomfortable than the shouting
Ellis finally speaks
can't take that motor back
But 'll pay him for it
'll pay him what he wants for it
Senior, stoic, pivots his body away from the boy
don't care what you do Ellis
Senior retreats to the bedroom
Ellis is left alone in the wake
He looks to his room
The door opens slightly and Neckbone takes a step out
Neckbone doesn't say anything
He just bites at his lip, sympathy for his friend
94
105
-  105 Charred hunks of driftwood smolder in a ruined pile on the sand
They constitute the remains of a large bonfire
Neckbone and Ellis stare at the ash
What the hell's all this
It's a bonfire
guess he didn't care about bein' seen
Ellis kicks at one of the burned logs
He bends down and finds the bottle of Jack Daniels, smashed
He had something else on his mind
Come on
Ellis leads Neckbone into the treeline
106
/ -  106 Mud's yellow shirt hangs, partially ripped, from a tree branch
Ellis pulls it off the limb
Concerned, they head deeper into the woods, over the fallen tree trunk that bridges the creek
107
-  107 The boys watch Mud through the trees at a distance
He's crouched on the deck of the boat fiddling with wiring
Mud, giving no sign he sees the boys, yells out to them
What are ya'll hidin' for
Mud drops the wiring and scales down to the bank
They emerge from the woods
Ellis carries the yellow shirt
We found your shirt
Ellis tosses it to him
Mud tosses it back
Keep it
don't need it anymore
Mud goes to the motor at the rear to tinker with more wires
95
We saw what's left of your bonfire
( ) Somebody could've seen you
guess
You do some drinkin' last night
did a lot of drinkin' last night
Mud stops and walks over to address the boys
His face is pale and his manner is curt
(') Neck 'm gonna need you here to get the motor runnin'
Ellis  need you to do something else for me
Mud removes a folded note from his back pocket
(') need you to take this to Juniper
Okay Mud
Ellis takes the letter
Mud goes back to the boat motor
He motions to Neckbone to join him
Let's go
You still takin' Juniper
had a dream last night
saw Juniper laying in a field with another man
They were making love
walked out into the field
Walked toward `em
was so angry the tips of my ears were burnin'
That's how  knew  was gonna kill this man
But when  got up close enough,  saw that the man she was with had tattoos on his back, just like mine
moved in closer and the guy turns his head back toward me
Hair for hair, dead truth, the guy she was with was me
Mud ducks back under the motor
Ellis looks at Neckbone, worried
96
(') 'll finish the boat, but 'd be surprised if  live long enough to sail on it
vision of yourself is a sure sign of death
Neck can you grab me a socket wrench
Neckbone and Ellis walk to the toolbox sitting nearby
They crouch by it, speaking quietly
You be all right
Yeah
What about you
He'll be okay
Can  borrow your bike
Neckbone fishes the key out of his pocket
Hesitates
Don't tump it
Ellis nods
Neckbone walks over to Mud with the toolbox
Letter in hand, Ellis gives a final look toward Mud's labor and walks back into the woods
On his way, he stops to hang Mud's shirt on a tree branch
108
-  108 Ellis rides in the flat bottom boat alone
He stares at the letter in his hand
109
-  109 Ellis sits on the dirt bike
He scans the parking lot
No black Lincoln
His eyes stop on a green pick-up
Miller, sits inside
Ellis looks around and finds a pay phone nearby
He gets off the bike and walks toward it
Ellis removes the flier Carver gave him
He dials a phone number copied at the bottom
(into the phone) Hello
saw the guy you're lookin' for
Yeah, he's crazy lookin'
Saw him at the Wal-mart outside of Gillet
He was buyin' some beanie weenie
'bout five minutes ago
97
Ellis hangs up the phone
He walks back over to the bike, climbs on and waits
After a moment, he watches as Miller's green pick-up pulls out of the Piggly Wiggly parking lot and races away
Ellis cranks the bike
110
/'  -  110 Ellis, at a slight crouch, keeps his eyes on the Piggly Wiggly parking lot
The green pick-up is nowhere in sight
At Juniper's door, he knocks twice, softly
The door swings opens
Juniper stands there, holding a lit cigarette
was wonderin' when 'd see you
Ellis checks over his shoulder and walks inside 111
/'  -  111 The bed is unmade and the room is a bit of a mess
Ellis keeps his head down
Juniper closes the door and takes a seat on the edge of the bed
She grabs the remote control and mutes the television
'm sorry about last night didn't plan on
Before she can finish Ellis has fished the letter out of his pocket and holds it out to her
'm supposed to give this to you
Juniper takes the letter
Okay
Ellis goes to the door
He pulls the bedroom curtain back slightly to check the parking lot
The coast is clear
(') Did you read it
No
gotta go
Ellis
He turns to her
98
(') 'm sorry
All you had to do was be there
couldn't
Then why'd you even come here
came here to leave with him really did
But now
now  guess just came to say goodbye
His eyes fall to the floor
(') You don't know us Ellis
We've been headin' this way for a long time
know he'd do anything for you
She puts her cigarette out in a Coke can on the floor
You really believe that
Ellis nods
Juniper speaks to him gently, almost smiling
It's a look of resignation
(') Mud's a born liar
That's what makes him so likable
He makes people feel good about themselves
He's a romantic
don't think he means to hurt people
But when people get close to him, that's what happens
Ellis watches her as she goes to the sink and wets the end of a towel
She dabs her eyes at the mirror
(') do love him Ellis
But  can't spend the rest of my life runnin' with him
may not know what kind of life  want, but  know that's not it
Her back to him, Ellis watches as she unfolds the letter and begins reading
He angles himself to see her face in the mirror
He watches her eyes scanning the words
No emotion
99
She finishes, folds the letter back up, then turns to him
(') Tell him  understand
What's it say
It says it's over
Tell him 've packed my things
Tell him 've gone
She takes a deep breath and smiles at him
(') Bye Ellis
Ellis turns and walks out
112
/'  -  112 Ellis, dejected, no longer bothers to look over his shoulder
He walks to the staircase but stops there
Feeling the need to say something more, he goes back to her room
He puts his knuckle flat on the door but hesitates
He leans over and looks through the window
The sliver in the curtain gives him a glimpse
Juniper is curled up on the end of the bed
She is sobbing
Ellis watches longer than he should before pulling his head away from the window
Ellis heads back downstairs
113
/ - -  113 Ellis, riding the dirtbike, looks to his left into the Sonic Drive-In parking lot
The high school kids have gathered there again
He notices a rust colored Ford coup
The driver, an older kid named (18), sits beside May Pearl laughing
Ellis steers into traffic and crosses the street
He pulls onto a patch of grass at the edge of the Sonic parking lot
In one motion, Ellis tumps the bike on its side and makes a b- line for the coup
, Kyle's hand is on May Pearl's knee
100
So what'd she say
She said she didn't like him that much
told her  thought he was all right
Ellis appears with his elbows in the driver's side window
He sticks his head so far in the door that Kyle has to lean back in his seat to make room
May Pearl is surprised
Kyle snorts out a laugh
You get my phone calls
What
've been callin' you
(motions with his head) Who's this guy
Get your head outta my car kid
Ellis takes his right elbow and quickly knocks Kyle in the mouth
It splits his upper lip
Kyle grabs his face
(') Shit
Ellis
called you twice yesterday
Your sister didn't tell you
Kyle slings the door open knocking Ellis to the pavement
From the ground, Ellis can see that Kyle is big and considerably tougher than the skinny kid he punched before
Kyle's friends from other cars take notice and begin to converge on them
Ellis makes a move for Kyle's legs but is kicked back to the pavement
Kyle straddles him on the ground and punches him
Another punch to Ellis' face
May Pearl is out of the car and yelling
Kyle
Stop it Kyle
101
May Pearl pulls Kyle by the collar
By his own will, he raises off of Ellis, keeping an eye on him
streak of blood stretches from Ellis' nose to his ear
He gets to his feet, dazed
Ellis wipes at his nose and sees May Pearl shove Kyle
Kyle smiles and turns to his friends, who laugh
The  that has collected consists of older high school guys and girls
Ellis steps toward May Pearl and is met with a shove too
(') What the hell are you doin' here Ellis
What
You can't just run up and punch people 'm with
'm sorry,  just wanted to know why you hadn't called me back
Why would  call you back Ellis
Because you're my girlfriend
The crowd is watching
'm not your girlfriend
We went on one date
One
We kissed
That doesn't matter
Yeah but
But what Ellis
What did you expect
love you
102
You're fourteen
Don't
Wait
We can make this work
We can figure it out love you
What
Ellis is losing it
His eyes are red
He looks at the crowd of kids
There are smiles and some snickering
May Pearl is speechless
She just stares at him
Ellis turns and walks back to the dirt bike
May Pearl's girlfriends gather around her
She shakes her head, dumbstruck
Ellis lifts the bike off the ground
He looks back at May Pearl who appears to be shrugging off the whole affair in front of her friends
Ellis speeds off
114
' / -  114 fire snaps and pops on the riverbank next to Ellis' houseboat
Ellis drags a piece of particle board from a trash pile nearby
He drops the board onto the fire and stands back to watch the blaze
Neckbone's bike leans on a tree behind him
Senior's truck rattles to a stop in the gravel just down the bank
He jumps out of the cab exasperated by the fire his son has started by their home
What the hell are you doin'
Ellis says nothing
He doesn't move
Senior, continuing to yell, runs and drags a hose up from the houseboat
(') Ellis dammit
What the hell's wrong with you
The fire hisses as Senior turns the hose on it
(') Ellis
Look at me
Ellis finally looks up at his father
phone  from inside the houseboat
Senior holds the hose in front of him
(') Take it
