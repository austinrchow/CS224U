Written by Joel Hopkins Sound of a piano being played
Sparse but beautiful
: - , mid-60's, sits at a piano in a scruffy recording room, tinkering
We hold on his slightly sad, intense gaze
Just then a shaft of crude light illuminates him, accompanied by a knocking sound
From behind a studio window, , a young rocker type in his 20's beckons
Harvey closes the piano lid
- Johnnie, unpacking his lunch and turning on various buttons, sits at a mixing desk
In front of him are 2 large monitors
Harvey joins him
Put my score up first
They don't want to hear it, Harvey
know, but  want to hear it
Put it up
'm backed up already, Harvey
(interrupting) Johnnie, you were the one that was late
Just put it up
Johnnie reluctantly presses various buttons
`cheesy' commercial for a washing detergent plays
It is accompanied by a jolly classical score
Harvey looks on forlornly at his work
As it comes to an end with a flourish, Harvey lowers his head
Beat
Johnnie glances at him
Listen, Harvey
Marvin wants me to present my ideas while your away
Harvey looks up, confused
Huh
2
Look, 'm not doing myself any favours here, Harvey
But, 'd watch your back
We hold on Harvey's tired, pensive face
/  - Harvey hurriedly exits the studio, catching up with a man walking to his car
Marvin
Hey, Marvin
Hey, Harvey
Shouldn't you be in London
Yeah, 'm heading there now
What's going on
Huh
Johnnie said something about you wanting him to present on Monday
Oh yeah, No,  was just thinking that, what with you being in London - you should stay a while
What
There's no need to rush back
Enjoy your daughter's wedding
What
Well, Johnnie can do it
mean, he can pitch the Samuelson account
3
No, 'm coming back
Those are my connections
They have been for years
know but
they've got new people running things over there think they're after something
(beat) different
want to come back
should be there in person
`There in person'
Harvey, nobody cares
have to stand behind my music
They're demos
- They're already pressed
No one needs to be there
They're not looking for you, they're not looking for me
They just need a fucking track
(beat/sighs) Harvey, you haven't booked a top line in 8 months
You got me doing triangle chimes for Christ's sake - give me something to compose
That's what 'm trying to tell you
It's not about composition
It's different now
Silence
Harvey looks at Marvin
(') What
Beat
'm back on Monday, Marvin
'm coming back
4
Beat
(sighs) You got to land this one, Harvey
What are you saying
(beat) Say it
'm saying there are no more chances, Harvey
(beat) Enjoy London
And with that Marvin gets in and drives   off, leaving Harvey standing alone in the car park
We hold   on his face - he's tired
He looks about him, then down at   his raincoat draped over his arm
He lifts it and drapes it   over the other arm
Sound of interior airborne plane
The seat-belt `ping' chimes
: - Harvey, seated in a crowded economy cabin, looks down from the now extinguished seat-belt light
He looks a little hot
Reaching up to turn on the air, he knocks his tray - knocking his drink into his lap
Shit
An attractive middle-aged woman, seated next to him, looks over
(') (to a passing Stewardess) Miss
'm sorry
've spilt my drink
'll get you some napkins
5
(to his neighbour) Why's it always me
The woman, perhaps wary of the length of the flight, smiles noncommittally
The Stewardess returns
Shall  take that
Thanks
And could  get another
whiskey, wasn't it
Yes
`Jamesons', no ice
The Stewardess heads off
Harvey mops himself up
He places the small mass of wet towels on his tray and sighs
Glancing out the window, he then turns to the woman
(') holiday
The woman looks over
No
Business
Harvey nods
(') (feeling obliged) Yourself
My daughter's getting married
Congratulations
(smiles) Thank you
(beat) She's marrying an American
But for some reason we've all got to go over to London
(smiling) told her we had a perfectly good wedding system here
() 6
(') (beat/expecting more of a response) They both work there, you see
The woman smiles again, then looks up as the Stewardess returns with Harvey's drink
(') Thank you
Harvey is about to continue speaking when the woman interrupts
'm really sorry but  have a meeting in the morning and  must try and get some sleep
No
Of course
'm sorry
It's just, 'll be useless - unless get some sleep
Sure
The woman covers herself in a blanket and turns out her light, turning herself away from Harvey
We hold on Harvey from a distance, spotlit in a sea of darkness
Sound of a commercial London Radio Station
`phone-in' competition takes place
: - radio hangs from a mail trolley
, mid 40's, dressed in a green uniform, turns into the path of a suburban house
She passes a postman - who nods his head
Morning Kate
Looking lovely as ever
If  was younger
7
Careful Paddy
(pointing to her cheek) Blushing
Is she up
Oh yes
Kate smiles before unlocking the front door
- Kate comes through the door, picking up a small pile of mail off the floor
(calling out) Mum
It's me - your daughter
- Kate puts the mail on a kitchen table
Just then , Kate's mum, enters in her dressing gown
Hello, my daughter
They kiss
(') Have a cup of tea with me
can't, 'm running late
Maggie seems to ignore this piece of information and heads to the kettle
Filling it up, she peers out the back window
He's at it again
(looking through her bag) Who
At what
The neighbour
Barbecuing or something
We see her  of her neighbour busying himself in his back garden
Smoke rises from a small garden shed
8
(') heard he's from Poland
(pulling a small package from her bag) So maybe Polish people like to barbecue a lot
'm leaving your prescription on the table
(beat) You know, you don't have to keep taking these - the Doctor said
like to
It makes me feel better
(beat) Its 8 o'clock in the morning
Who barbecues at 8
(looking at her watch) 've got to go
'll call you later
Kate's mum sighs and turns away from the window
Of course
Don't worry about me
'll be Ok
(beat) Have you got that date thing tonight
don't know, maybe
(kisses her mother) Bye Mum
`Time and tide', Kate, as your father liked to say
Beat
Was that from his terrace in the South of France
Kate winces
Kate's mum looks hurt
(') 'm sorry
That was mean
(beat/takes a breath) () 9
(') Look, 'll call you later
(kisses her mum again) love you
As Kate leaves, Maggie watches her go
She sighs, before returning her attention back to the window
: The Neighbour enters his smoking shed and closes the door
- busy High St
Kate moves amongst the throng boarding a bus
- Close up on Kate's face gently swaying
She stands reading a paperback, oblivious to the crowded bus around her
- Kate sits reading on a speeding train
/   - The Heathrow Express comes into the station
Kate disembarks
3 /  - Kate arrives at a booth
sign reads: ` - Public Statistics Agency'
West Indian woman, dressed in the same green uniform, stands waiting
She holds a newspaper, folded open at the crossword
Aggie
Morning darling
Kate goes behind the counter and turns on a light
As the booth illuminates, Kate unlocks a door behind and goes in
Without looking up from her crossword, Aggie follows
/   - Kate places her bag in a locker and takes out a pair of heels
Sitting down to put them on, Aggie enters
10
Four across
filmy layer on the surface of a liquid
Kate thinks for a beat
Scum
Aggie giggles to herself and writes it in
Kate stands just as another co-worker hurries in
Sorry
Sorry
She kisses Kate on the cheek and opens her locker
(') Thank God you're my boss
Without looking up, Aggie `tuts' and shakes her head
Oonagh decides to ignore
(') Are we still on for tonight
Matt's definitely bringing Simon
No
Please
Only if you guys swear you won't leave if it's not going well
No way
Promise
Promise
Seven down
Another word for `souvenir'
Kate thinks for a beat
11
Memento
Aggie laughs and scribbles it in
Oonagh rolls her eyes
Aggie, why do you bother
You just get Kate to give you all the answers
Aggie `tuts' again and waves Oonagh away
Kate hands Oonagh a clip-board and the two of them head out
- As luggage spews out, a dishevelled Harvey looks on
He sees his case and awkwardly pulling it from the belt, heads off
- Oonagh and Kate stand next to each other, interviewing returning travellers
Kate interviews an elderly couple
It's clear she's good at her job
So you spent the whole 2 weeks in the Toronto area
Yes
Our daughter lives there, see
Ah
(filling in a form) So not a business trip then
Oh, no
Unless you count grand- children as work
(smiles) Some might
Harvey comes through a set of sliding double doors, wheeling his case behind him
12
- Kate finishes up the interview with the elderly couple, and turns to see an approaching Harvey in the distance
She registers his attempts to steer a wide berth of her, but matches his movements, bringing him to a stop
Sorry,  couldn't just ask you a few very quick questions, could
'm sorry, but 'm in a bit of a hurry
It won't take a moment
(starting to walk on) Look, 'm sorry, but 'm tired, you know
Yes
do
Beat
Kate's directness, brings Harvey to a stop
He turns to look at Kate
She smiles
Beat
'm sorry
Harvey continues on, glancing back once more as he walks away
Kate turns to Oonagh and shrugs, before returning her attention back to the sea of arrivals
3 - Taxi pulls away from the Terminal
- Harvey sits in the back with his phone to his ear
Hi Suzie, it's your Dad
've made it in one piece
'm in a Taxi on my way to the Hotel
guess i'll see you all there
Can't wait
Love you
13
Harvey hangs up
He dials another number
(') Hi, it's Harvey, Harvey Shine here
Just wanted to confirm Mike for Monday
'm in London at the moment, but reachable on my cell
Which is
Well you've probably got it on file, but just in case, 917
Well you may have to dial an international code first, 'm not sure
Anyway, it's 917 749 7558
That's 917 74
sharp `beep' cuts him off
Harvey hangs up and looks out the window
Cranes loom on the horizon
He yawns
- The Taxi pulls into the forecourt of a mid-market West End London Hotel
Harvey gets out and pays the driver
- Harvey approaches the front desk
Hi
'm with the wedding party
There should be a room for me
Harvey Shine
The Concierge taps into his computer
Yes
have a double room for you
Good
Has everyone else checked in
'm not sure, sir
My daughter
Susan Shine
Or maybe she's already going by Wright
Susan Wright
The Concierge taps some more
No, sir
No one of that name
14
Do you have a Mrs Pearce
More tapping
No, sir
The Concierge looks at Harvey
Beat
Harvey shrugs
'll go up
- Harvey enters the room
He places his case on the bed, takes off his jacket and goes to the window
roller blind is pulled down
Harvey tugs on the cord, to no avail at first
Then suddenly it whips up, causing Harvey to duck backwards as the flailing cord almost takes his eye out
Warily, Harvey steps forward and looks down at the busy street below
He goes to open the window but it is stuck
He tries again - but it won't budge
He looks around the room, then up at the now fully contracted blind
Tentatively he reaches up and pulls the cord to lower the blind a little
It slowly starts to unravel and unravel
and unravel, until it hits the bottom of the window sill with a gentle thud
Harvey stands in semi-darkness
Just then, to his relief, his phone rings
He hurries over to the bed and retrieves it
Hello
(beat) Suzie
Hi darling
Yes, 'm here
Where are you - where is everyone
(listens/Harvey's face drops a little) Oh
see
No,  didn't realise thought the plan was for everyone to stay together
Noticeably dejected, Harvey sits down on the bed
(') No its
fine
just wasn't sure
(beat) () 15
(') So your mother has rented a house for you all
(beat) see
No, no, don't be silly
'm a big boy
It's fine
Harvey looks around the bland room
(') Home from home
(beat) Yes, 've got the address
So, 'll see you there
(beat) love you too
Bye
Harvey hangs up
- Kate, dressed for the evening, hurries along a street
Her phone rings
Mum
- Kate's mum stands not far from her back window
What are you wearing
- Dungarees
- Oh, you're not
- They're completely in again, haven't you heard
16
- (lifting back the curtain) Oh, you're just being silly
:  now bare chested Neighbour at work in his garden
Smoke rising from his shed
(') Now don't be nervous
Just be yourself
- (smiling) Ok, mum
Thanks for the advice
- Oh, listen
've been thinking about Greece for our holiday
- (frowns) Ok, Let's talk about it later
(beat) love you too
Kate hangs up and crosses a busy road
- Kate's mum continues to spy
: The Neighbour bends down out of sight
On rising again, he sees Maggie at the window and waves
Maggie flinches, before dropping the curtain
- Kate comes through the door
Oonagh sits on her own at a booth
Kate joins her
17
Sorry i'm late
Don't tell me
(makes the gesture of a telephone) your mother
She's worrying about her new neighbour
Says he barbecues a lot
Very suspicious
(smiles) know
got you the same as me
(off Kate's gaze) They're at the bar
He seems very nice
Just then two guys approach from the bar
Hey Kate
Hi Matt
Matt embraces Kate, then turns to his friend
Kate, this is Simon
Hi
Simon shakes Kate's hand
Kate blushes ever so slightly
Hi
(beat) You work with Matt
Yes
If you can call it work
18
(laughs a little too eagerly) Right
Awkward pause
Come on, i'm feeling small down here
Sit
They all sit down
- Close up of Harvey's face under shower
- Harvey puts on a cream linen jacket, that matches a pair of slacks
He looks at himself in a full length mirror
He looks good
There is a knock at the door, just as his phone rings
(
) Room service
Harvey opens the door, as he answers his phone
Just over by the bed
Thank you
Hello
young African man wheels in a trolley with a pot of tea and some biscuits
Shall  open this for you
He heads towards the window
Harvey turns
Careful
Too late
The blind wips up - toggle hitting the young man in the eye
(') Are you Ok
The porter, covering his eye, nods, backing towards the door
19
Oh, yes
Yes, fine
Are you sure
Here
Harvey wedges a fiver into his free hand as he retreats rapidly
The door closes
Beat
Harvey returns the phone to his ear
(') Hello
No answer
He sits down on the bed and pours some tea
Just then his phone rings again
He reaches for it, knocking the trolley and the tea onto himself
(') Fuck
Grabbing a tea towel, he dabs his trousers
- From a distance, across a crowded Friday night bar, we watch our gang chat
It seems to be going well
Laughter hangs in the air
- cab pulls up in front of a posh looking restaurant
Harvey steps out, dressed in the same cream jacket, but now sporting a pair of dark trousers
He looks like a bad lounge act
The cab pulls away as Harvey turns towards the restaurant
- Harvey enters
Three young men stand to one side, chatting animatedly
On seeing Harvey, one of them looks up
Harvey
Scott
You made it
20
Yes
Scott turns to his friends
This is Susan's father, Harvey
Harvey Shine
(beat) Harvey, this is my best man, Josh Stillman and Pete Turner
Hi
Hi
How are you Harvey
(glancing at Harvey's attire) Its great to see you
Good thanks
Great
(sensing his gaze) How are you holding up
Great
(turning to his friends) Can't wait to marry your daughter, really
Laughter
No
(beat) Is she
She's through there
She'll be thrilled you're here
'll go and find her
Just then Harvey's phone rings
Sorry
Harvey turns away and answers
21
(') Yes
(listens) No, no, that's not right
booked Mike
It's important
spoke to him about it two weeks ago booked him
(getting flustered) Have you told him its Harvey
It's really important
(suddenly conscious of Scott's friends standing nearby) Just
Just get him to call me, Ok
Harvey hangs up
And putting on his `positive' face turns back to Scott's friends
(') Sorry
(beat) Always something
Sure
(beat) What's your field, Harvey
Oh, 'm a
(beat) work in the music industry
Wow
Doing what
'm a composer
(beat) Sort of
Cool
What kind of stuff
Oh, you know, for
commercials, that sort of thing
(beat) Mostly background stuff, that sort of thing

22
Slightly awkward pause
Sounds profitable
It can be
(wanting to change subject) You guys work with Scott
/ Yes
Oil, right
Futures, yes
Well, 'm sure that's pretty profitable too
The guys smile a little too readily
Sometimes, yes
Harvey tries to smile back
Well, 'd better find my daughter
Absolutely
Good to meet you, Harvey
See you in there
As Harvey moves off into the adjacent room, the guys watch him go
/    - Kate and Oonagh wait in line for the bathroom
So
He seems nice
23
Nice
Nice like good
Or nice like dull
Nice like how old is he
Oonagh smiles
Old enough
Your age
ish
He can't be, he's looks like a baby
Alright, my age
But Matt says he's very mature
Oh right
Did Matt offer that up - or was that in response to you two discussing my approaching barrenness
Kate
Just then Kate's phone rings
(') Don't answer it
have to
She's on her own
(beat) She gets lonely
Just tell her you're busy
Kate nods and indicates that the loo is free
Oonagh goes in, as Kate answers her phone
Mum
/  - Harvey enters the room
He sees his daughter, standing off to one side, with Scott, talking to some friends
24
She looks beautiful
He takes a moment to just watch her
As she turns in slight slow motion, she smiles on seeing her father and joins him
Hi Dad
Suz
(beat) You look beautiful
Thank you
Slightly awkward pause
Give us a hug then, as they say in this country
They embrace
Beat
Off Susan's look
(') know,  look ridiculous
No
You look
Like a bad lounge act
Susan smiles at her Father
Beat
(') spilt something on my trousers
(beat) 've been doing that a lot recently
Harvey looks over at Scott in the distance, sharing a laugh with his buddies
Dad
Long way to come to see two American kids get married
Susan looks at her father, a little irked
Sorry for the inconvenience, Dad
25
Harvey looks at his daughter
Sorry
Beat
Have you seen mum yet
No
They're here
Yes
They're over by our table
Harvey looks over
(') Please Daddy
What
(beat) 'll be good
Just then, they are approached by Scott guiding some friends over to say hello
Look who i've got
Susan's girlfriends shriek with delight as they approach
Susan turns to greet them
'll speak to you later Suz
You enjoy your friends
As Susan greets her friends, Harvey retreats
- Kate rejoins the others
Oonagh and Matt are standing
Matt has his jacket on
(to Kate) We've gotta go
Problem at home
Baby-sitter just rang
Nothing serious
() 26
(') (beat) But you guys stay
Kate makes eyes at Oonagh, who shrugs innocently
Oonagh goes to kiss Kate, while Matt says goodbye to Simon
(') (under breath) Enjoy yourself - you miserable cow
And turn off that phone
(beat) Are you working tomorrow
Yes
Half-day
'll see you Tuesday
Oonagh kisses Kate and heads off with Matt, leaving Kate standing slightly awkwardly next to a seated Simon
Looks like we've been set up
Yes
(beat) Sorry
No
It's not your fault
mean, 'm fine with it
mean, 'm happy to meet new people
Yes, me too
Why don't you sit down
Yes
Kate sits down
So you're Oonagh's boss
Yes
(beat) Sorry, 'm saying `yes' a lot
27
Yes
(smiles) You are
They share a smile
(') Do you want another drink
Ye
(smiles) Sure
can get them
No, it's fine
What do you fancy
'll have another white wine
Anything dry
Simon heads off to the bar
Kate watches him go
She allows herself a smile
/  - Harvey stands at the bar and downs a whiskey
Picking up another glass, he turns away, and with drink in hand, approaches a group of people standing around a table
As he nears, a distinguished older man with a healthy main of white hair sees him and momentarily touches the arm of the woman standing next to him
She turns around to see Harvey approaching
Harvey
Jean
Harvey turns his gaze to the white haired man and nods
(') Brian
Harvey
Good to see you
There is a palpable sense of tension in the air
28
(deliberately only directed to Jean) So our baby girl is really getting married
Who would've thought
Yes
Harvey you remember the Watsons
Barry and Jill
Harvey turns to a couple, standing nearby
(slight sarcastic tone) Of course  do
Hell, its been a while
guess, not since Jean and split up
Hi Harvey
You look well
Thank you, Jill
You're looking well too
Both of you
guess you guys stayed in touch with Jean
Awkward Beat
Barry and  work together now
No kidding
Insurance
No
(beat) Property, now
small portfolio down in Florida
Real Estate
That's great
(beat) That's really great
Awkward silence
29
Well  think we should sit
know Susan wanted us all seated before they joined us
Sure
Good idea
Everyone begins to take their assigned seats
Harvey is on the inside close to the middle
It's a bit tight and involves people getting up to make way
Harvey gets to his seat and is just about to sit when his phone rings
Brian and Jean share a look
Taking it out of his pocket Harvey looks at the incoming number
(') Sorry,  have to take this
(picks up) Can you hold a minute
Harvey makes his way back along the table, causing people to stand again
(') Sorry
Sorry
Harvey walks away from the table
- Kate sits waiting
Simon has finally been served and turns from the bar with drinks in hand
As he does a young woman, standing with a small party of two other girls and a guy, greets him
Kate looks on
It's obvious from Simon's reaction that they know each other well
Just then Kate's phone rings again
She looks at the number and thinks about ignoring it, but in the end, reluctantly picks up
Mum
You've got to stop calling
(beat) What
can't hear
Hold on
Kate gets up and moves towards the back-room
- Harvey stands on the phone
30
(getting more and more flustered) It'll take two hours max
No longer
(listens) Have you told him its Harvey
Look, we go back
He'll tell you
Just have him call me
- Harvey returns to the table
Everyone is seated
Sorry
He notices his name place has been moved to the end
(') (smiling/to Jean) Did you move me darling
No, Harvey
didn't touch it
Dad
moved you
thought it might be easier in case you needed to get out
Ok, sweetheart
Harvey takes the last remaining seat
Brian stands
Shall we have a quick toast to get things going
(beat) 'm going to save my big speech for tomorrow
(laughter) Dear Susan and Dear Scott,  just want to take us all back to that wonderful holiday we all had in Rome together last year and wish you `Salute'
Salute
31
Jean and  love you both so much
And we're so happy that Scott is going to part of our clan now
And so  say many, many, happy, happy years ahead
Salute
Salute
My turn
Everyone turns to Harvey as he stands to make a speech
Just then his phone rings on vibrate
(') Sorry
Harvey scrambles to turn it off, as Jean rolls her eyes
(') Sorry,  thought it was off
(flustered he finally manages to stop it buzzing) Um, uh
(beat) To Susan and Scott
great couple
(beat) Cheers
Momentary awkward silence
Cheers
Harvey sits
Let's eat
Yes
Everyone tucks in
Harvey sits slightly blushing at the end of the table, knowing he's blown it
32
- Kate hangs up and returns to the main room, to find that Simon has been joined at their table by the young group
Kate bolsters herself before returning to the table
Hi
Hey
Kate
(beat) Sorry, i bumped into these guys and couldn't shake them
(turning to his friends) Everyone this is Kate
Kate holds up her hand, before blushing a little
Hi
Kate this is Andrew, Melissa, Gwen, and Elinor
Hi
Kate sits down
Sorry,  hope we're not barging in on your evening
Kate shakes her head
(') It was Simon's idea
How do you guys know each other, anyway
Kate glances at Simon
We don't really
We just met
Melissa looks at Simon and grins
blind date
33
No
(beat) We met through friends
see
think we should leave you guys alone
(a little too abruptly) No
(beat) Don't
Stay
It's fine
Slightly awkward pause, broken by Andrew
Hey does anyone know the cricket score
England were all out by tea, when last checked
Bloody hell
Cricket
Don't get it
What
Men in white
Oh,  do
Kate looks on as the girls laugh
- Harvey sits at the end of the table, looking on, as everyone talks animatedly around him
He eats his food and drinks plenty of wine
Up near the middle Scott shares a joke with Brian
Just then Susan, who has been talking to the best man, turns and catches her father's eye
He smiles at her and raises a glass
Susan smiles back before returning her attention back to her neighbour
- Kate sits among the group
She too seems to be detached from the proceedings
34
heard that they did it in her bedroom, while she was away
It was her flat
Yep
He has his own, but was basically living at hers
Ouch
That is evil
As the conversation continues in this vein, Kate glances at Simon
He seems more at ease in this company
- The meal is drawing to a close
People have gotten up and are circulating around the table and nearby
- Harvey stands at the bar
He downs a drink
Jean approaches
Harvey
Hello Jean
(to barman) Can  get a glass of water please
The Barman obliges
(') You Ok
(Downing another drink) Fine
Beat
35
Go easy Harvey
(getting quite loaded) Why, Jean
Are you worried i'm going to embarrass you again
No Harvey, 'm worried you're going to embarrass yourself
(beat) And more importantly Susan
This weekend's just about her and Scott
Nothing else
Oh, you're good Jean
You're really good
You've always known how to make me feel shit, haven't you
(beat) You've always been so good at that
've had cause to practice
Beat
Tell me, Jean
Were you ever proud of me
Yes
Sometimes
(beat) But you never listened
The parties Jean
The fuckin' parties, where  would hear you - dressing up what  did for a living - film composer this, film composer that - trying to make it more palatable for your friends
'm a
(cutting him off) Don't Harvey
Beat
36
What is it you see in Brian
Jean looks into Harvey's eyes
Long beat
He doesn't talk about himself
(beat) He talks about me
Harvey stares back, momentarily transfixed, before turning away dismissive
(') Go home Harvey
Go to bed and see your daughter get married tomorrow
Jean walks away
Harvey stands at the bar
Susan comes into the room
She approaches
Hi Dad
Hey Suz
Are you alright
(upbeat) Yeah
'm great
How are you doing
Enjoying yourself
Yeah
Beat
He seems a good guy, Scott
You'll be alright
Yeah, he is
(beat) 'm sorry,  haven't had much time to talk to you
No Sweetheart, it's your weekend
It's no problem
You just enjoy yourself

(beat) Well, not great, but
fine
You know the usual
Triangle chimes
Susan smiles
Are you still doing your own stuff
You should
bit
Not so much
Beat
Harvey looks away, then back
(') Listen Suz, 'm really sorry about having to leave early
It's just bad timing
There's a sudden rush at work, you know, a couple of big jobs in at once
Sure
It just can't be helped
But 'll be there at the ceremony, at the really important bit
'll be there to give you away
(beat) And then 'm sure Brian or your mother will talk at the reception
You know me, 've never been very good at speech
(interrupting) Dad
Yeah, Suz
Listen, 've been thinking
(beat) () 38
(') Brian has been a really big part of my life now for some time
And
(long beat) And 'm going to ask him to give me away tomorrow
Silence
(') 'm sorry, Dad
The colour drains from Harvey's ruddy face
But Suz
Dad, 've hardly seen you in the past five years
That's not true
Dad, it is
Maybe a quick coffee here, or a telephone call there but no, you haven't been part of my life
And
(beat) And Brian has
Beat
(') You having to leave early this weekend
don't know, it just seems typical
(flash of irritation) It's work darling
It pays for things
(beat/sighs) Sorry
Look,
(interrupting) 'm sorry Dad, but it's what 've decided
Harvey momentarily turns away from his daughter, to compose himself, before turning back
39
Sure
(beat) understand, Suz
Harvey leans in and kisses his daughter on the forehead
(') You go and be with your friends
Go and enjoy yourself
(pulls out his phone) gotta make some stupid calls
You know
Go and enjoy yourself, Sweetheart
'll see you tomorrow
Susan reluctantly walks away as Harvey lifts the phone to his ear
We hold on his face
With Susan gone he lowers the phone
He looks frightened
'  - Harvey enters the rest-room and heads to a bank of basins
He turns on a tap and bends down - drinking profusely
He splashes his face then rises and begins to dry it with some paper towels
You fuckin' asshole
Harvey suddenly bends over as though he'd been punched hard in the stomach
He rises, red in the face, holding his nose, desperately trying to hold it in
But he can't - Harvey sobs huge heaving muffled cries
Just then, someone enters
Head down, Harvey lunges for the door and exits
- Harvey stumbles out of the restaurant and into a waiting cab
The cab pulls away
- Kate sits surrounded by laughter
Simon's attention is firmly fixed on his friends
Kate's humiliation is magnified as we slowly move into her face
Sorry
40
Kate gets up and walks away
Everyone momentarily stops chatting and looks to Simon, who shrugs
- Kate enters a cubicle
She sits down to have a pee
We hold on her sad face
She suddenly grimaces, before holding firm
But not before a tear has been expelled and rolls down her cheek
She swats it away
- We hold on Harvey's sad face as it gently bobs in the back of a moving cab
- Kate exits the pub, just as a cab pulls up
As Harvey exits one side, Kate gets into the other, as the cab pulls away again
: - Bride and Groom stand at the head of the room, saying their vows
Harvey stands near the back, looking on
As the ceremony is concluded the audience spontaneously burst into applause
Harvey looks around the room, then back at his daughter, as she smiles giddily at her husband
Harvey slips out the door
- Carrying his case, Harvey hails a Taxi and gets in
3 - Kate, back in green, stands next to a young couple asking them questions about their travel arrangements
41
- The Taxi comes to a stop in `classic' mid-day London traffic
- Harvey glances at his watch, then out at the mass of cars in front of them
His phone rings
He picks up
Hello
The line goes dead
Harvey puts his phone away
He glances out the window again as the Taxi crawls forward, before again coming to a stop
Harvey leans forward
(') Is there another way we could try
The driver, looking a little irked, glances at Harvey in his mirror
It's going to be bad everywhere
Your president's in town
It's causing chaos
Harvey rubs his neck and glances again at his watch
- Kate eats a snack, while reading a book
Her phone suddenly rings
She sighs quietly before slowly picking it up
Mum
/  3 - Taxi pulls up
Harvey gets out, pays the driver and hurries into the Terminal
3 / -  - The counter is mobbed
long queue snakes away from it
Harvey hurries to the front, where a male Steward is attending to another passenger
42
'm sorry but, 'm on the 4
30 to Hey pal, we're all in hurry
Just hand luggage, can i go straight to the gate
Sir, 'm dealing with a passenger, you'll have to wait
Please
've gotta make that flight
Sir, everyone is in a hurry
You'll just have to wait
Harvey sees another Steward momentarily free, and turns to her
Miss, i'm on the 4
30 to
Can you check me in
#2 'm afraid that flight's now closed
But it's not yet 4
just have hand luggage
It doesn't take off for another 40 minutes
#2 'm sorry sir, but we have to close the gate 45 minutes prior to departure
But  just have hand luggage
Please
've got to get on that flight
#2 'm sorry sir, there's nothing can do
43
Harvey looks around
When's the next flight
#2 There's one at 8
30
But      know that's full
can put you     on stand- by, but  doubt you'll get     on
(beat) The earliest  can get you     on for sure, is tomorrow morning,     10
30
(shouts) Jesus
People look over
#2 Sir, 'm sorry, but you have to stay calm
Harvey looks about him
3 - Harvey sits holding his phone
He dials a number, lifting the phone to his ear
He gets voice-mail
Marvin
It's Harvey
Listen, there's been a mess up, the traffic was crazy
'm going to have to reschedule the pitch slightly
Frank can set up
'll email him the cue numbers - he knows what to do
And then 'll be there lunch- time at the latest
'll come straight from the airport
'll try you again shortly
Harvey hangs up and stares at the phone
Beat
He looks up and around the Terminal
young child has a tantrum nearby
Suddenly his phone rings
(') Hello
got your message
44
The traffic was insane
But listen
(interrupting) The traffic, Harvey
Jesus
Beat
Marvin sighs
(') Listen, Harvey
Stay in London
Enjoy your daughter's wedding
We'll talk when you get back
It's fine, 'll be there lunch- time
It's no problem
Steve knows what  need
Mike's coming in
It's all set u
(interrupting) Harvey
Silence
(') It's over
(beat/sighs) It's out of my hands Harvey
have people to answer to
We just can't afford the space
(beat) We're letting you go
Letting me go
Can't afford the space
Marvin, 'll be there lunch- time
Beat
'm sorry Harvey
(beat/sighs) Call me when you get back
The line goes dead
Harvey closes his phone
Beat
He stares ahead into space, then stands and walks away
45
- Kate closes up the booth
3 /   (/) - Kate sits at a table near the bar, drinking a glass of wine and reading her book
She glances up as a man enters
Harvey takes a seat at the bar
Jamesons, no ice
The Barman serves Harvey
Harvey immediately downs it
(') Another
(beat) Please
The Barman refills his glass
Again Harvey knocks it back
Kate glances up from her book
(') Another, please
The Barman glances at Harvey
(') What
Sorry
Harvey reaches for the now full glass
But knocks it, spilling it into his lap
Shit
Kate looks up again, along with the few other patrons in the bar
Harvey registers their gaze
(') Sorry
Vulgar American
Kate smiles, before returning to her book
Harvey dabs his trousers with some napkins
46
(') (to himself) know, we don't raise our voices in this country
It's not done
Harvey puts the sodden napkins down onto the bar
He looks at himself in the mirror behind the bar and rubs his chest
He sighs and glances around the room
He sees Kate and recognizes her
(') (to Kate) 'm sorry
Kate looks up
Beat
For what
For yesterday
was rude
You tried to ask me some questions
Kate nods
(') You were just trying to do your job and  was rude
don't really remember, but 'm sure you were
Most people are
Kate returns to her book
Beat
Good book
Kate looks up
It probably would be, if i could finish it
(holds up his hands) get it
Beat
Harvey downs another shot
Kate looks up again
That'll help
47
(looks over) Sorry
said, that'll help
Beat
Believe me, it will
Right
Beat
reckon it'll help as much as that trashy novel and a glass of chardonnay
Beat
-kay
Harvey winces, lowering his head into his hand
Putting some money onto the bar, he turns and joins Kate, taking a seat at an adjacent table
'm really sorry
That was out of line
(looks up) What
Go away and stop apologizing
It's just that i've had a really shitty day
(looking back at her book) Join the club
No
mean really shitty
Yours may have been shitty, but mine was shittier
Beat
Finally, Kate looks up again at this strange man
48
How shitty
missed my flight
lost my job
And my daughter who got married in London today asked her step father rather than me to give her away
Kate looks at Harvey sympathetically for a moment
Not bad
(beat) But what can  do for you
(beat) Make it worse, maybe
Let me make it up to you
(beat) Would you let me buy you lunch
What time is it - tea time
'll buy you tea
Kate blushes ever so slightly
That's very sweet of you, but don't know you
And
you don't know me
Exactly
That's why we should have lunch - tea
Kate can't help but smile
Beat
Thank you, but
no
She indicates her book
Because you've got your book
And it's a good replacement for humans
Kate smiles and nods
Just then her phone rings
(') If that's for me 'm in the shower
49
Kate smiles as she takes out her phone and looks at the incoming number
She is about to answer, when she stops herself
(') Aren't you going to answer that
She thinks for a moment, before putting the phone back
No
Should  take that as a hopeful sign
Kate can't help but smile
If it is, you could just give me a little wider smile
Kate can't help but smile wider
- Kate's mum pulls the phone away from her ear, perplexed by the lack of response
Her eyes wander to the window
Drawing back the curtain, she looks out
: The Neighbour, now sporting a white apron, busies himself as usual
He suddenly bends down and heaves what would best be described as a body bag onto his shoulder
As he stumbles under the weight, he carries it into the shed
Kate's mum turns away ashen
- Harvey and Kate remain seated at adjacent tables
Muzak plays in the background
They are now virtually the sole patrons of Chez Gerard
Kate eats a salad and reads her book
Just then, Harvey's food arrives
Beat
Look we are having lunch together
(looks up and smiles) No
We're having lunch next to each other
50
Ah
(beat/suddenly holds out his hand) 'm Harvey
Harvey Shine
(takes it) Kate
Kate Walker
Kate can't help but smile at Harvey's persistence
Beat
She puts down her book
(') So why aren't you at the wedding
Harvey, momentarily taken aback by the directness of Kate's question, is about to answer, when the sound of a vacuum cleaner erupts
Harvey and Kate look over to see a cleaner vacuuming the floor nearby
Ah, that's better
knew something was missing
(shouting over the din) had to get back for a work thing
(over the din) work thing
For the job you just lost
Beat
(over din) Yes
(over din) see
(beat) So, this job you lost
You liked it
(over din) Yes
(beat) No
Not really
They've beaten it out of me
But its what i do - did
51
(over din) Which is - was
(shouts) 'm a composer
(stops himself) write jingles
The vacuuming stops
They both look over, then back
Wow
That's about the normal response
Anything  would of heard
Yes
Uh
Uh
(long beat) Well, maybe,  mean it maybe before your time
(smiles) No, go on
Harvey smiles a little sheepishly
(singsong voice) You can take the Salem out of the country - but you can't take the country out of Salem
Beat
No
It's a cigarette
Oh really
Forget it
52
Ok
The vacuuming starts up again
They look over then back
(') (over din) Did you always want to write jingles or was there something more
Harvey laughs
(') What
No,  just love the way you
you just cut through it
'll take that as a compliment
You should
(beat) was going to be a Jazz pianist
Were you good
Beat
No
Not enough
Harvey looks away
'm sorry,  can be nosey
tend to blurt stuff out
Breaking from his reverie
No
like it
like it
(beat/over din) Alot
Vacuuming stops
Beat
Kate looks away
53
(') It's a relief to find someone in this country who actually says what they feel
Oh, haven't you heard
What
That's all changed
We're a nation changed
Ever since Diana, we've unlocked ourselves
Everything's flowing out
(beat) You guys showed us the way
Just as we're trying to adopt your stiff upper lip
Kate smiles
(') What is a stiff upper lip, exactly
Harvey tries to physicalize it
No,  think, it's more this
Kate stretches her top lip
see
(copies her) How's that
(top lip stretched) Yeah you're getting there
Stretch it out further
Let me see again
No, now you're doing a bulldog
Like this
54
No, now you look like you don't have any teeth
(beat) Are they your own
What
Your teeth
The front ones
My dad had a front one that you could just take out
Really
As they sit there, lips stretched, nattering away, we start to pull back
Accompanied by a simple piano score we look on as they appear to us, momentarily, like an ordinary couple
- Harvey and Kate exit the restaurant
They stand opposite each other in the quietening Terminal
Thank you
enjoyed myself
Yes
So did
Slightly awkward pause
Kate glances at her watch
should get going
have a class
class
(a bit sheepish) Yes
writing class
(beat) Twice a week
Just something  do
(changing the subject) () 55
(') take the Heathrow Express
What about you
Harvey hadn't really thought
don't know
guess 'll stay in a Hotel near here
My flight's in the morning
Beat
Well
it's been a pleasure
Harvey Shine
Yes
Yes it has
They shake hands, smiling
Just then Kate's phone rings again
(') There's your phone again
Yes
(beat) Sorry
'd better go
Kate turns and leaves
Harvey watches her go
/    - Harvey picks up a hotel phone
'd like a room please
(beat) One night
- Kate waits on the platform as a train glides into the station
- Kate stands in a crowded middle section
mild commotion ensues down the other end of the carriage as somebody squeezes aboard at the last
56
'  (
) Sorry
Excuse me
Kate looks up to see Harvey making his way down the crowded carriage
Sorry
People reluctantly make way for Harvey and his case
He finally arrives next to Kate as the train jolts forward
Momentarily losing his balance, Harvey steadies himself on a businessman's shoulder
Kate leans forward to help, as the businessman turns slightly irritated
(') Sorry
(turning to Kate) Hi
(a little sheepish) thought i might as well stay in town
More fun than a hotel next to a runway, right
Kate nods
Harvey smiles a little sheepishly as the train speeds off
- The train speeds past on its way into London
- Harvey and Kate stand next to each other, gently swaying, in the crowded carriage
The businessman standing next to Harvey, talks loudly on his phone about his day's conquest
Harvey and Kate share a look
In a Keatonesque performance, Harvey, keeping his body rigid, slowly leans further and further away from the man, making Kate smile
- The train pulls into the station
We watch as Harvey and Kate alight with the crowd
57
- They come to a stop outside
It's still light
beautiful fall afternoon
Taxi's are over there
They'll take you to wherever you need to go
Harvey looks towards the Taxi rank
(') So,  guess it's goodbye again
Yes
(looks up at the evening sky/beat) So,  couldn't walk you to your class, could
(beat) Carry your books
(beat) Stand near the curb so you don't get splashed
Kate smiles
Sure
Is that a yes
Yes
(beat) Why not
- Montage: Accompanied by a wonderfully romantic little ditty, we watch from a distance as Harvey and Kate navigate the buzzing streets of central London
All is alive and well
Harvey drops his suitcase off at the same hotel he was staying in before
As they wander through the city, foreign students mingle, policemen chat, and office workers linger
London is at its best
58
- The sky glows a pale orange as Harvey and Kate walk and talk along the South Bank
Yours is a beautiful city, Kate
Kate looks at Harvey a moment, then smiles
(') What
Its just a funny way of saying it
Quite old fashioned
Really
But i like it
(beat) Yours is glorious country, Honeychurch
Harvey looks at Kate quizzically
(') It's a line from a book
`Room with a View'
Harvey shakes his head
'm afraid 'm not much of a reader
(beat) Too fidgety,  guess
Kate looks at Harvey
(') You think less of me
No, we're just quite different, that's all
Is that bad
59
(thinks about it) No
Just then Kate's phone rings again
Both our phones ring a lot
We have that in common
(smiles) Ah
They come to a stop as Kate takes out her phone and looks at the handset display
(') Sorry
should probably take this
Harvey nods
(') Mum
(beat) 've been busy
(beat) No, 'm out
Yes with someone
No someone else
(beat) Yes
(looks at Harvey) a man
Harvey smiles
We hear Maggie's warble continue as Kate listens
Beat
(') You did, did you
(beat) An actual body
Harvey looks at Kate
Kate shakes her head
Maggie continues
(') Mum
Listen
'll come over tomorrow and we can check it out together
(beat) have to go now
Just get an early night and i'll see you tomorrow
(beat) love you too
60
Kate hangs up
(') Sorry
(beat) My mother
She worries about you
And herself
(beat) She's convinced she's living next to Poland's answer to Ted Bundy
see
They start walking again
She means well
She's just had a tough run
(long beat) My Father ran off to France with his secretary
Then mum got cancer, about four years ago now
She's fully recovered
But won't admit it
(beat) She's basically bored
And my continued `situation' as she calls it, being single, is her major distraction
Her pastime if you will
see
Yes, my rotting eggs are her raison d'etre
(grimaces/turns to Harvey) Sorry
No
talk too much
61
No
like it
Do you
Yes
Kate comes to a stop and looks at Harvey
Hmm
(beat) Well, here we are
My class
Harvey looks up at a grey municipal building
How long is the class
An hour
Can  wait
(beat) Sorry -  promise 'm not `Bundyish'
(smiles) It's getting cold
You don't want to wait
Yes  do
(smiling and backing towards the building) Careful,  might get the wrong impression
Harvey shrugs
What can you do
62
- Maggie, very tentatively, lifts her curtain again
No sign of the `Killer'
Suddenly the doorbell rings
- As Maggie, slowly approaches the front door, the doorbell rings again
She slowly leans in and peers through the peep- hole
: The Neighbour looms large
He holds in his arms a large `something' wrapped in paper
Maggie pulls her head away
Beat
She looks again
: The Neighbour bends down out of sight and then rises again, turning to leave
Maggie watches him go
- The door slowly opens
Maggie looks around then notices the `thing' wrapped in paper on the ground
She quickly picks it up and takes it inside
- As daylight fades, Harvey sits waiting
Through a large ground floor window, he watches Kate, as her class wraps up
As she comes out, he gets up and joins her
How did it go
Oh, the usual
(beat) Lovely mild-mannered Mike read us the latest installment from his Physcho-Sexual Thriller, and we all tried to look at him in the same way after
Harvey smiles
(') Shall we keep walking
Yes
63
- Harvey and Kate walk under Waterloo bridge past the second hand bookstalls
man plays a saxophone melancholically
Do you ever wish you could try a different life
(beat) Just for a day
Just to see what it would be like
What would yours be
(looks down at her uniform) Well, no green, that's for sure
Harvey smiles
(') (beat/thinks) It would take place in Spain little house inland
And what would you do there
Oh
don't know
(beat) Write the great novel
(beat) think 've got one inside me
We're not talking high art
Just a bloody good holiday read
Beat
Ok
So this house in Spain would have a little cabana looking out over the plains for you to write in
(smiling) Yes
64
And a little stream running by, to bathe in
(smiling) Sure
'm there
(beat) Sorry, that's if you're receiving guests
Kate smiles, coming to a stop
Sure, you can visit Harvey Shine
Why, thank you Kate Walker
Just then a sort of Skiffle come Rockabilly busking act starts up
Two girls and a guy
They're great
Harvey and Kate stand amongst the crowd watching
The South Bank is at its vibrant best
- With the sound of the Skiffle act still playing in the distant background, Harvey and Kate take a seat on some steps over-looking the river
As darkness descends, street-lamps reflect off the water
They sit in silence
Then
What happened Harvey
(beat) Between you and your daughter
Beat
Harvey shakes his head
don't know
(beat) Somewhere along the way  lost her
lost my family
(beat) just woke up one morning and realised i didn't belong
Beat
65
(') 'd always had this mean little feeling in my stomach, that they were a bit embarrassed by me
(beat) If you saw them now, with Brian, Susan's step-father
You'd see, they make more sense
They look right together
Beat
Harvey looks out over the Thames
(') 've not been a great father
Kate looks at Harvey's sad profile
Beat
She thinks for a moment
The reception
It's still going on
(looks at his watch) guess
Where
Harvey looks up
The Grovesnor
Why
Kate looks at Harvey
You must go
What
What the hell are you doing here
You must go
Harvey shakes his head
She doesn't need me
66
Stop feeling so sorry for yourself
She's your daughter, you're her father
Go
Harvey shakes his head again
Kate is not about to give up
(') Harvey, it would be unforgivable not to go
Beat
(') Harvey
Wait
'm thinking
(beat) Only if you come with me
What
Please, come with me
As my
bodyguard
(smiles) As my friend
Kate momentarily blushes, then shakes her head
Harvey, firstly, i'm not about to go to anyone's wedding in a green polyester work suit
Secondly it's not right
We'll find you a dress
If we find you a dress, will you come
No
Please
No
Please
67
No
- Music/Montage: The song is the same as that played by the buskers
It's a fast, fun Rockabilly Skiffle thingy
We watch as Harvey and Kate buy a dress
(Handheld/Double speed)
- Taxi pulls up and out step Harvey and Kate
Kate looks fantastic on Harvey's arm as they walk up the front steps
- reception is in full swing
- The doors close behind Harvey and Kate as they enter an elevator
- Harvey and Kate stand side by side in silence
They both smile a little anxiously - almost like teenagers
/  - There is a loud `ping' as the   elevator doors open onto a hallway
Harvey and Kate step   forward
Down the hall, through some double doors we hear the   familiar din of a buzzing reception
Harvey momentarily   falters
Come on
Kate encourages Harvey forward
- The doors open and Harvey and Kate enter
Heads turn
Jean looks up and sees Harvey with Kate
She shakes her head
Susan sees Harvey and gets up
She joins him
68
Hey
Hi
didn't go
'm glad
Off Susan's look, Harvey turns to Kate
This is Kate
friend
(sheepish) Hi
Congratulations
You look fantastic
Thank you
Slightly awkward pause
'm really sorry to gate-crash
Your father sort of insisted
No, it's fine
'm sure
(looks around) there's room
Susan looks back at the full top table
You get back
Don't worry about us, we'll find a place
Yes
No
(stops a passing waiter) Could you find them a seat please
Sure
69
Pete, acting as Master of Ceremonies, stands and clinks his glass for attention
'd better go
() And now for the best man's speech
Except we seem to be missing the bride
(laughter) Oh, no, here she is
Susan heads back and resumes her seat at top table
The best man takes the mic
Scott
What can  say
/ The waiter leads Harvey and Kate to a table
'm afraid this is the only place left
The waiter shows them to a few empty seats at the children's table
That's fine
Harvey and Kate take their seats
The kids stare at them
Hi
brace clad, large girl in a white frilly dress speaks
Are you Uncle Harvey
Yes
guess
've heard about you
70
Oh
(beat) You're not Miriam's kid are you
Yes
Wow
You've
got big
mean grown up
'm fourteen
Wow
Kate feels someone's eyes on her and turns to her left to find a smartly dressed young boy of about eight, staring up at her with his mouth open
Kate nods her head
Hello
The boy remains silent, keeping his gormless gaze fixed on Kate
(') Now you're not to dominate the conversation tonight
(turning back to Harvey) Chatterbox to my left
Harvey smiles
/   - So without further ado, 'd like to propose a toast to Susan for making my friend Scott complete
The audience whoop and clap
Scott gives his best man a hug
Pete stands
() And now ladies and Gentlemen
It is the turn of the Father of the Bride to say a few words
() 71
() (') And tonight that task will be carried out by the very charming and distinguished Brian
More clapping as Brian stands
Kate glances at Harvey, who blushes
Well, that's quite some speech Josh
Quite something to follow
But  shall try
Harvey suddenly stands and clears his throat
Um
Excuse me
Nobody really hears
He picks up his glass and a spoon and begins to tap it
People stir and turn to Harvey
Brian comes to a stop
Jean looks on furious
Silence
(') Sorry Brian
Sorry to interrupt
Everyone stares at Harvey
Silence
(') But you see  can't just sit hear and watch somebody else give my baby girl away
Susan's my daughter and 'm her father
Not the best, by far, but her father all the same
waiter brings Harvey a microphone
(') Thanks
It's arrival slightly throws him
(') Um
should have prepared something but
guess it reminds me of a joke
Harvey continually knocks the mic against his chest, causing terrible feedback
(') Sorry
Um
Then Harvey drops the mic
Jean stands up
72
For God's sake Harvey, don't make a scene
Silence
Harvey stares out at the party
They all stare back at him
He glances down at Kate who smiles back
Harvey lifts the microphone up off the table and raises it to his lips
No Jean
want to make a scene
You know
'm tired of being embarrassed
(beat) If we can't make a scene on the day of our daughter's wedding, then when can we
want to make a scene
want to shout
wanna tell the world how lucky it is to have our Suzie in it
Yeah
wanna tell Scott, how damn lucky he is
Hear, hear
People start to clap
(smiling) And also if he ever hurts her, know people in north of London
Laughter
(') Seriously though
Scott,  swear you have found in Susan a bright and passionate person
And a loyal friend
Hear, hear
And  can see from the way she looks at you
From the way she is with you, that she is
(beat) () 73
(') happy
(beat) And  thank you and welcome you to the family
Harvey and Scott share a look
The room applauds loudly
(') And finally, if  can linger a moment longer
would like to turn it back over to Brian, with a note of
gratitude
(beat) Thank you for being there for my baby girl
Thank you for being there, when  wasn't
Beat
Brian nods to Harvey, before standing and raising his glass
If you would all please join Harvey and , in a toast
(beat) To Susan and Scott
Susan and Scott
Everyone claps loudly
Susan shares a gentle smile with her Father
Harvey sits and looks at Kate anxiously
Kate smiles and nods
Well done
Really
She indicates to the rest of the table
Harvey turns to their now animated young neighbours, who all sit clapping
/  - () Ladies and Gentlemen, the first dance
The  strike up as Susan and Scott take to the dance floor
They dance a slow dance
Harvey and Kate sit watching
74
After a while Susan, looks over for her Father
Harvey hesitates, before Kate encourages him up
She plucks a flower from the table display and places it in his lapel
Harvey joins Susan and Scott on the dance-floor
Shaking Scott's hand, he leads Susan into a dance
Thanks for coming back Dad
Beat
Thanks for having me back
Kate looks on, as Harvey dances happily with his daughter
Feeling something, she turns to find the eight year old's head slumped against her shoulder as he sleeps soundly
Kate smiles at her lot
Back on the dance-floor, Harvey encourages Brian to take over the dance with Susan
Harvey turns away and is joined by Uncle Fred and gang
They all chat animatedly
Uncle Fred pushes Harvey into a dance with his wife
`Boogie' strikes up
Kate looks on as Harvey dances and reunites with his extended family
She sees the delight in his face
She looks around at all the happy faces
It's time perhaps to let the family celebrate alone
Extricating herself from the sleeping boy, she pushes two chairs together and makes a bed for him
Covering him in a jacket, she glances back at the dance-floor before turning to leave
Back on the dance-floor, a `Boogie' is in full swing
Harvey caught up in the fun, energetically swings Aunt Maddie around
He suddenly catches himself and turns to his table to look for Kate, but finds it empty save for a row of dozing children
Harvey makes his excuses and turns away, looking for Kate amongst the crowded room
- Kate retrieves her coat and makes her way down the hall towards the bank of elevators
75
- Harvey hurries to the exit
- On turning into the hall, he sees Kate standing in the distance
Just then, she steps forward and out of sight
Harvey runs
/   - Kate stands in the empty elevator, waiting for the doors to close
She stares at her feet
Just then we hear a burst of a piano being played
It stops
Kate looks up to see, across the hallway, in an empty conference room, Harvey seated at a grand piano
He smiles a showman's smile before giving it another `old school' burst
He stops again
Kate smiles
Just then the doors begin to close
Kate reaches forward and presses a button - opening them
Harvey starts up again - but this time he plays something sincere - beautiful
Kate listens before slowly stepping out of the elevator
She walks towards him, joining him at the piano
- Harvey slides along the seat and indicates for Kate to join him
She does so and listens as Harvey plays beautifully
He's good
He finally brings the piece to an end
Wow
Harvey blushes
(') One of yours
Harvey smiles at Kate
76
You are very kind
But
no
(beat) Shearing doing Rogers
Ah
(beat) Well
you play it very well
(bows his head a little/with a smile) Well, thank you Ms
Walker
You're most welcome, Mr Shine
They share a little smile
Beat
Me thinks you were leaving
Indeed  was, Sire
Why
Beat
Because you looked happy
Harvey looks quizzically at Kate
Beat
(') You should be with your family, Harvey
But, you know, maybe  want to be with you
(beat/sings) You make me happy - when skies are grey
Kate smiles
Careful, Harvey
'm blushing
Beat
77
Thank you
For what
For making me come here
Beat
You're welcome
They share a look, before both looking away
Beat
Can
What
Can
Just then a vacuum cleaner sounds
They both look up - as a cleaning lady vacuums the floor nearby
Beat
(') Hey kid, they're playing our song
Kate smiles
Yes
In the background we hear clapping and cheering coming from the reception
funky number starts up
Harvey takes Kate's hand
(excited) Come on
want you to meet people
want them to meet you
Harvey leads a slightly reluctant Kate back down the hall towards the reception
- The band let rip on a funky tune
The congregation fill the dance-floor
78
Harvey leads Kate back into the room and heads straight for the dance-floor
As they pass relatives along the way, Harvey introduces them to Kate
Much hugging and kissing ensues
Harvey and Kate dance a boogie
Uncle Fred and Aunt Maddie join them
Uncle Fred steals Kate from Harvey and twirls her off
: Fun and Frolics on the dance-floor
Harvey is at the center of it all
He initiates a Horah
Congo line
Russian dancing
Kate's face says it all - she's having a ball
The sleeping kid, sleeps
/  - Close up on the
() Ladies and Gentlemen
The bride and groom are about to leave
Please join me outside to send them off in style
- Harvey and Kate join the rest of the congregation outside on the steps of the hotel
Harvey looks on as his daughter and son-in-law head to an awaiting car
Susan stops and throws the bouquet behind her
It is caught by Aunt Maddie, who in turn throws it and it is caught by Harvey's `all grown up' niece
She blushes profusely revealing an impressive set of braces on her teenage teeth
Susan kisses her mother and Brian goodbye
And is about to get into the car when she stops and hurries over to Harvey
Bye Dad
Bye Suz
Bye Susan
She hugs him tightly
Pulling away she turns to Kate
Be gentle with him
Kate nods as Susan turns to leave
(to Kate) Sorry
79
Kate smiles
As the car pulls away, everyone   cheers
Harvey looks on
His eyes momentarily lock onto his   ex-wife's
They share a conciliatory look
As Harvey watches   his daughter's car disappear down the street, Kate looks at   him
He turns back
Beat
You Ok
Yes
Yes,  am
Beat
Harvey looks around
(') You wanna get out of here
Sure
- / Harvey and Kate walk
The streets are quiet
There is already a hint of dawn in the sky
Rubbish trucks manoeuvre
- They turn into the courtyard of Sommerset House and take a seat on some chairs
The sky lightens
don't think 've stayed up all night since  was a student
They stare out over the courtyard
Silence
Harvey looks at Kate for a beat
You got sad
Why
Kate looks back at Harvey and tries to read him
She looks down at her lap, then up, out over the courtyard
Oh,  don't know
My uniform's green
The sun begins to creep above the buildings
Harvey and Kate look out across the courtyard
80
(') was pregnant once
(beat) didn't have it
Didn't give it a moment's thought
(beat) That's what smart girls did
Beat
(') do sometimes wonder what they'd be like today
(beat) Whether they'd be smart
Funny
Serious
(beat) don't know, it's silly
Harvey looks at Kate in the morning light
Kate blushes and looks away
(') don't know why i just told you that
No
(beat) 'm glad
Harvey looks away, then back
(') Meet me here, tomorrow
What
Exactly here, at these chairs
At noon
Kate smiles, determinedly trying to keep it light
What about your flight, Harvey
don't want to leave
(beat) Guess why
81
Why
wanna be with you
Kate's blush deepens, she looks away and laughs
Shut up, Harvey
It's true
Kate glances at Harvey, trying see the truth in his eyes
You say that now, but wait until tomorrow
Today is tomorrow
Harvey we know nothing about each other
You're
Old
bit older, yes
(beat) can be mean
Really mean
So can
No
Truly cantankerous
So can
Kate can't help but smile
Beat
She glances towards the street
(standing) should be going
82
know enough to know, 'll be here
Waiting, at this chair
Kate looks at Harvey, then again towards the street
Sure, Harvey
Noon
mean it
(beat) 'll be here
Kate smiles a little smile
She suddenly believes him
Ok
She steps backwards
Wait
Harvey gets up and joins her
They look at each other
Harvey suddenly leans in and kisses Kate
(') (pulling away/can't help smiling) Sorry
Kate smiles
Harvey Shine
Can  have something until tomorrow
Kate reaches for her purse and pulls out a photo
She gives it to Harvey
(stepping backwards) must go
She turns and leaves, hurrying to catch a bus
Harvey stands holding an old library card
He looks down
On it is a faded photo of toothy young girl, no older than eleven
Harvey looks up and smiles
83
- Kate takes a seat on the top deck of a bus
Taking a moment to catch her breath, she looks out the window
Turning back, she allows herself a smile
: - Harvey, with a croissant lodged in his mouth and a cup of coffee in hand, buys a morning paper
He turns and crosses the road, skipping up the steps of his hotel
- Harvey enters, and waving to a slightly bemused concierge, heads to the bank of elevators
Morning
'm afraid they're both out of order, Sir
Harvey glances at the sign, then over to the stairwell
guess i'll walk, then
- Harvey, a man, seemingly impatient to start a `new life', runs up the steps
Surprised at first by his agility, he begins to slow
He stops to catch his breath
Suddenly his spare hand holds tight onto the bannister
Unsteady Harvey sits down
Close up on Harvey's face, confused
He tries to stand but again is forced back down
He begins to place his coffee on the stair next to him, but suddenly shudders, grabbing his shoulder
The coffee topples, spilling down the steps
Shit
Frightened and confused, Harvey sits alone in the stairwell
84
Just then, a door opens and the African porter from before, comes through, carrying a tray
He sees Harvey
Sir, are you Ok
Harvey looks up in a daze, then shakes his head
- Kate, with a skip in her step, walks through the bustling mid- day streets of London
She stops off and buys a bag of cherries from a `Fruit & Veg' vendor
- As the porter and concierge talk to a medic, Harvey sits in the back of an ambulance
The door is closed
- Kate sits waiting, expectantly, on the same chairs they had sat on earlier
She applies some lipstick
- Harvey sits attached to various monitors and such, surrounded by doctors and nurses
He looks agitated and confused
've got to go
've got to be somewhere
Sir,  need you to stay calm
It looks to me like Arrhythmia - an irregular heart-beat
Yes,
', that's what 've been trying to tell the nurse
've had it since  was a kid
take Primax
guess i've been forgetting to take it recently
've been under alot of stress, that's all
85
Well Ok, then we probably know where we're at
But  need to check all possibilities
- As time passes, we watch as Kate's expression slowly turns from expectant to resigned
- know it's Arrhythmia
Please, have to be there
Sir, 'm 99% sure it is
But my job is to make sure it's not that 1% wouldn't be doing my job if didn't check out absolutely everything
(beat) Nurse, we'll do an , followed by Bloods
And can you arranfe a monitored bed for him for tonight
As another pad is attached to his chest, Harvey looks beaten
- Kate looks on as some kids play in the fountain nearby
She self-consciously smooths a fold in her skirt, then looks at her watch
Beat
She looks down at the brown paper bag of cherries
Suddenly a resigned smile flashes across her face - she's been here before  nothing new
Kate gets up and leaves
We watch her walk away
Sound of a vacuum cleaner
: - Open on a close up of Kate's face - it says it all
Kate vacuums her mother's floor
She turns it off and unplugs it
86
Coiling up the cord, Kate puts the vacuum cleaner into a cupboard under the stairs
(calling out) Ok mum, that's me, 'm done
Maggie comes out of the kitchen
Why don't you stay and have some lunch
can't, 've got to go
(beat) Not to pry or anything but why is there a large smoked ham under the stairs
Oh, that, yes
It's, um
The neighbour gave it to me
The polish neighbour
(beat) So probably not a mass murderer
Probably not
Kate smiles
(') Are you sure you're going to be alright
Of course  will
'll be fine
Men, who needs them
Remember we've got Greece to look forward to
Resigned, Kate hugs her mum
Yeah
Kate leaves
87
- Kate exits her mother's house and passes Paddy the Postman
Morning Kate
Morning Paddy
Looking lovely as ever
(resigned) Thank you
Kate walks off down the street
/   - Harvey stands at a counter in a busy reception area
He has his phone lodged in the crook of his neck
In front of him, lies an open phone directory
It's some sort of Statistics Agency
(listens) Yes
That sounds right
Yes, based out at Heathrow
(listens) Thank you
Hold on
(turns to a receptionist) Miss, could  borrow, your pen
The receptionist obliges as Harvey scribbles down a number on an old envelope
(') Thanks, thanks alot
/
- phone rings behind the counter
Oonagh picks up
, Heathrow branch
(beat) Hold on
() 88
(') (calling out) Kate it's for you
Some guy called Harvey
Kate, stands nearby, holding a clipboard, about to head out onto the floor
She looks at Oonagh
She thinks for a beat, then shakes her head, silently gesturing she not there
Oonagh, a little perplexed goes back on the phone
(') Um, 'm sorry
She's not here
/   - Harvey, phone to ear, thinks for a beat
He knows she's there
Please
It's important
Beat
Hold on
- Oonagh pulls the phone away and gestures again to Kate
Kate shakes her head
Beat
Oonagh reluctantly lifts the phone to her ear
'm sorry, she's busy
(beat) She won't come
Oonagh hangs up, looking at Kate
Kate shrugs defensively before turning to go
We hold on Kate's `confused' face as she walks away
/   - Harvey, having hung up, lowers the phone from his ear
He looks around the room
Seated across the way an old man stares back at him
receptionist arrives with some forms
If  could just get you to sign these, you'll be all done
Harvey signs a form
89
(') And there
(beat) And that's it
Harvey glances at the receptionist - she is roughly Kate's age
Just then his phone rings
He picks up hopefully
Hello
Hey Harvey, it's Marvin
Where are you
(turns from the counter) Oh, 'm still in London, Marvin
Well you get yourself back here my friend
've got some great news
You were right
The Samuelson account
None of the kids could handle it
They couldn't nail it
They ended up picking one of your old tunes
They want you to come back and update it
(beat) We need you back, Harvey
Your old room's here waiting for you
(beat) Harvey
Harvey looks around the room at the lonely figures, waiting
young boy fidgets
Next to him sits a young man, lost in thought
Well, that's great Marvin
Yeah
Yeah, `it's great'
mean, look,  know when to eat humble pie
So look, hey, when can you get back here
(beat) Harvey
Harvey glances back at the old man
The old man continues to stare back
Beat
Something changes in Harvey
90
'm not coming back
What
'm quitting Marvin
What you mean you quit
Harvey, fuck you man, you need us
No, you know,  don't
As you said, it's my `last chance'
(beat) Look,  gotta go
Harvey hangs up
smile breaks across his face
- Harvey exits the Hospital
(calling out) Taxi
taxi pulls up
(') Heathrow please
As quick as you can
Harvey gets in as the Taxi speeds away
/
- Aggie, manning the booth, attends to some passengers
- Taxi pulls up
Harvey hurries out
/
- Harvey approaches the booth
91
Excuse me, 'm looking for a Kate
Kate Walker
Aggie eyes Harvey, a little warily
Who wants to know
friend
(beat) More than a friend
Aggie tuts and calls behind her
There's a man here looking for Kate, says he's `more than a friend
' (
) More than a friend
Oonagh comes out from the office, eyeing Harvey suspiciously
(') You're the American
(long beat) She likes you
can tell
(beat) Now, don't you go messing her around
Don't you hurt her
wouldn't
won't
Beat
Oonagh continues to eye Harvey
Finally
She's not here
Oh
She's left for the day
(beat) But you might find her at her class
(looks at her watch) think it starts around now
Down on the Southbank
At the National
92
Yes,  know
Oh you do, do you
(beat) Well, go on
Go get her
Thank you
Harvey turns and hurries away
Oonagh and Aggie share a smile
- The blood oozes from his wound like dark chocolate on a warm summer's day
Kate sits listening in a daze, as `mild-mannered Mike' unleashes his latest
- Harvey alights from the Taxi, paying the driver
He runs
- Everyone gathers their things as the class wraps
- Harvey hurries towards the Southbank
- Kate comes down from the upper terrace of the National, saying her good-byes to her classmates
In her hand she holds a book
As she turns she sees Harvey coming to a stop in the distance
She momentarily falters before approaching
Hey
Hey
93
You're still here - still in London
Yeah
(beat) Kate,  just wanted to apologise and explain
No, you don't have to - explain - it's fine - No, but  do - don't need to hear - it's fine, seriously
But  want to
(comes out) had to go to Hospital
Oh, God
Why
No, it's nothing, 'm fine,  just forgot to take my pills
have this condition, 've had it since was a kid - it's an irregular heart- beat sort of thing
Arrythmia
Yes
How do you know what it is
(smiling a little sheepish) My
My father has it
(smiling) Well, young men get it too
Kate can't help but smile
Beat
94
(' (') Kate, 'm so sorry  wasn't there
Beat
Kate takes a breath, and gives him the practical response she's gone over in her head
Harvey,  like you,  really do
And  had a lovely time - it was great
But, you know,  don't really do fountains at noon
(beat) live in Willesden
And you live - in - White Plains
Exactly
And we're not teenagers, so - you know, monday morning and life kicks in, all that jobs and family and brown envelopes with bills in - it was a lovely day and won't forget it, but it's not exactly real life
It is
It can be
No, Harvey, it's not
Beat
Kate,  want this
want you
button is pushed in Kate
But it's not just about you, is it
(beat) You don't know anything about me
Look at me
It's pathetic expected you not to show for God's sake
think  even wanted you not to be there, it's easier that way
(beat) You - you just dive in wherever, deep end, whoosh
But, 'm not your bloody swimming pool Harvey
(starting to break) () 95
(') And  am not going to do it, 'm not going to do it because it will hurt
Not right now, maybe, but soon - there will be a "it's not quite working is it" or a " need some space" or whatever it is and it'll end and it'll hurt and won't do it,  won't and
Oh fuck,  don't want to cry
don't want this
Kate turns and walks away, standing by the balustrade, looking down at the river below
Harvey watches
She takes a seat on a bench
Harvey gives her, her space
Then slowly he approaches, leaning against a tree nearby
Long beat
(') think it's actually easier for me to be disappointed
think 'm actually angry at you for trying to take that away
Long beat
Just then Kate's phone rings
She reaches into her bag and takes it out
She stares at the phone, thinking for a beat, before answering
(') (firmly) Mum,  love you, but not now
She hangs up
Long beat
Should  take that as a hopeful sign
Kate can't help but smile
(') If you just give me a little wider smile
(smiling/laughing) Oh, shut up, Harvey
Beat
Kate collecting herself, looks up at Harvey
(') So how's this going to work, Mr Shine
Beat
96
have absolutely no idea
(beat) But it will
(beat) promise you that
Kate stares at Harvey for the longest while
Then
Shall we walk
Beat
Harvey nods
Yes
Kate gathers up her things, stands and joins Harvey
They begin to walk
After a short while Kate stops, puts her hand on Harvey's shoulder and takes off her shoes
That's better
Harvey glances down at Kate's feet, then up at her
think you're my kinda girl
Harvey and Kate smile
And as they walk away from us we hear
(') Why don't you ask me those questions
Which ones
You know, from the airport
When wouldn't stop
Oh, the questionnaire
(beat) Ok
Name
Harvey Shine
97
Place of residence
Beat
'm in transition
We watch as Harvey and Kate disappear into the sea of London
