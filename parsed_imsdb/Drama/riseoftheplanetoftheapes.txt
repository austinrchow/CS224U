Stevens looks around at the board members - they're lost
In the past, it's been impossible to target specific areas, both because of the Blood Brain Barrier - Jacobs stands, interrupting Will
What Dr
Rodman has done is to invent a virus that can, for the first time, cross the membrane that protects the brain and deliver a genetic, therapeutic, payload

(trying to sell) This 'payload' would directly affect the areas of memory, higher function - and, of course, the motherlode: intelligence
The board members stare, trying to comprehend

With an elbow prompting from Jacobs, Will takes a from his jacket pocket and awkwardly holds it up for dramatic effect

He hurries over to him
Are they gone
Long gone
Will knows the answer, but has to ask anyway
Did they say anything before they left
mean, about Phase 2
Look around you, for Christ sakes
We'll be lucky if we don't go to jail
Will's gutted - devastated
But we're so close
You think you're the only one who's got something at stake here

Tiny mice that can't hurt anybody
Will finds to his dismay that he's got nothing to say

Show you something, boss

Rodman
The least you could do is give me a moment of your time
Will's shoulders sag with exhaustion
It's been a long, devastating day
of course
- The cages are empty, the doors open
Will notes used on the table, filled body bags lined up on the floor
It's a creepy, horrible scene
They're all gone
'm sorry, Franklin
Genuinely sorry
What's he got to do to get the hell out of there
Franklin ignores him, steps inside Bright Eyes' cage
He moves to the very back and pulls aside a blanket
At first Will doesn't understand what he's looking at
The lighting's dim and the thing's so small
But then      ' Will stares at it for a long moment, his brain overloaded

He's got to be put down like the others
Tell you what, Doc

So you be my guest
Franklin hands the   to Will
It's quiet
Will can hear the baby's  breath
He enters the cage kneels beside it, regards his tiny body, his little hands
Will readies the needle, brings it close to the chimp's belly
but there's no way he can go through with this
Angrily Will tosses the needle aside
Turns to Franklin, who watches from outside the cage
Two days

Neither makes a sound

As Will drags Caesar off, the apes in the enclosure climb higher in the tree to watch
Suddenly they - Caesar stands at the vent watching the neighborhood walk home from school
One  walks with a blonde teenage , books clutched to her chest
Caesar watches the Boy flirt with her
The girl smiles, flirts back
One of the younger Kids runs by, bopping the Boy on the head

Will and Jacobs stand behind him, reading the number results on a monitor
Will's obviously discouraged
The drug's not staying ahead of the disease
36
But we're still making progress, right
Will tries to tamp down the frustration he's sure is written all over his face
Sure
At this pace we'll get to trials by the time Hell freezes over
Jacobs - embarrassed in front of the Tech - pulls him aside
This isn't graduate school - there's a procedure we have to adhere to
It'll take forever

Jacobs looks at Will
He's known him a long time
How's your father
Haven't seen him in a while
This isn't about him
He's worse, isn't he
Will wants to tell Jacobs the truth - he's tempted to tell him about Caesar, about Walter's treatment - but he can't
() He's fine
It's a familiar, baleful  that continues over the following
'  - Will sits in front of the computer, looking at a file crammed with MPEGs of Caesar doing puzzles and games

(into computer mic) Caesar continues to maintain a high level of cognition
But Walter's disease has caught up to the neurogenesis treatment
Nearly all initial improvement has been erased
Will stops recording

Caesar passes him, heads for Will's study
'  - Caesar enters, finds Will at the desk, head in hands
Will senses his presence
Looks up

What do you mean
Who
With effort, Will pulls himself from his own thoughts and tries to understand what Caesar wants from him
(') Who
Caesar is an ape
() chimpanzee
No "what"
"Who"
Will is taken aback - beginning to realize the intellectual leap Caesar's taken
Are you asking about your identity
That's abstract thought, Caesar
Caesar couldn't care less about 'abstract thought

Caesar's getting worked up - he wants out of the car

Will grows concerned
No
This is a bad place for you, Caesar

Walter, standing in the middle of the room, confused
As if he's not sure where he is
Abruptly he turns and heads across the room
and - Walter pauses on the porch, blinking in the sun
The street ahead of him is quiet
No one around
Walter wanders down the front path
When he arrives at the sidewalk he keeps on going,

He's immediately startled by a  , the  of , and a car fishtailing out of control
The car  into a nearby tree
- Hearing the , Caesar jumps to his feet, rushes to the vent
He sees Hunsiker emerge from the smashed car, unhurt
Caesar watches as Hunsiker inspects the ruined front fender, then turns to  at someone
That's when Walter comes into Caesar's view
He's in the street, afraid, disoriented - while Hunsiker rages, jabbing a threatening finger towards Walter's chest
In a flash Caesar's down the attic stairs
- Walter backs up as Hunsiker approaches, still jabbing the menacing finger
Look at the front of my car you stupid, stupid old man
You should be locked up
Your son's going to pay for that damage - No time for anybody to react
The chimpanzee to the ground
Caesar
Straddling Hunsiker, teeth bared, Caesar pounds him with his fists
Help
Get him off - Caesar
no
Stop
Walter grabs Caesar by the shoulders, tries to pull him back
But Caesar's too carried away by his rage - he shrugs the old man off his back
Then he grabs one of Hunsiker's hands and ""
41
Aaaaaaaah
Walter struggles to his feet and grabs Caesar again '
Caesar
Caesar hesitates
Blood dripping down his chin, he looks over his shoulder and meets Walter's eyes
(') Please stop
Hunsiker uses the distraction
He scrabbles to his feet and sprints for his house
- ' He races after Hunsiker , stunning him
'  - Just as Hunsiker's about to reach his front door, Caesar flies from behind - his feet hitting the door - and lands to block Hunsiker's entrance
White with terror, Hunsiker - clutching his bleeding hand to his chest - takes off running down the sidewalk
- Hunsiker runs for his life
He looks over his shoulder - Caesar's galloping behind, in hot pursuit
He tries to speed up - can't go any faster
Again he glances over his shoulder - Caesar's closing in
Breath coming hard, Hunsiker sprints, scrambles, desperate to escape
He looks over his shoulder-but this time '  ,
Unsure where to go, half-stumbling, Hunsiker keeps running
Then,   , ,
Hunsiker backs up, changes direction, runs across the street
42
Enjoying the chase, taking his time, Caesar grabs a tree branch and swings from tree to tree
with one giant jump, he makes it to the top of a tree across the street, tracking Hunsiker like prey
Hunsiker's running out of steam
Caesar swings down in front of him and  him in the chest, sending him flying
Calmly he stands over Hunsiker, who cowers
Please no
Caesar pounds his chest,  in triumph
But then he sees something across the street that abruptly pulls him out of his euphoria:  - ,  - He looks down at Hunsiker, cringing

When this doesn't work, he tries prying them open with his teeth

Will spots Jacobs,'lunching with his Blackberry, in a corner
He heads for him
Jacobs looks up, sees will coming
Will slides into the seat across from him
You've been gone a week

Too sick to return my calls
You know it was a funny thing, but was watching the news and they started talking about a seven-year- old chimpanzee that went nuts - and all of a sudden, there you were on the
seven year old chimp, raised since birth
The cafeteria gets a little awkward as Jacobs raises his voice
Neither man cares
He's the son of chimp 4
And he's smart
Off-the-charts smart
Because of the 112

Without a single negative side-effect
Aside from biting off a man's finger

Jacobs is stunned
That's the effect Will was after

You're out of your mind
Like a chess player, Will lets the unasked question sit there
And Jacobs is undeniably, voraciously curious
Don't you want to know if it worked
Jacobs can't resist
Did it
It was miraculous
Unquestionable adult neurogenesis - development of fresh nerve tissue
() It brought my father back
But Jacobs is confused
You told me he was failing
It's just like with the mice
Alzheimer's is a progressive disease, you need to keep it at bay a - you need boosters

Will can see Jacobs turning this over in his mind - the possibilities
The money
Why have you waited so long to tell me this

'Him'

Jacobs looks at his old friend, wondering about his sanity
We've discovered a safe treatment
It's the payday you've been waiting for

It takes Jacobs a moment before he gets outraged
You're giving me conditions could have you arrested for what you've done
But you won't - you need me to build the drug
Here's what need:  want you to get Caesar back

Eyes on Caesar, Rocket discards the ball like a piece of trash
His look is insolent, an unmistakable challenge

Rocket blocks his path, reaches out and pulls at Caesar's sleeve, as if to examine the material
Caesar jerks his arm away
Rocket bares his teeth, raises his arms
Caesar considers the options - should he run
