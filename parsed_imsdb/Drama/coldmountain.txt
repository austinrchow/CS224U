: shrouded in a blue mist like a Chinese water color
Below them, close to a small town,  , armed with vicious sticks and stripped to the waist, come charging in a muscular, steaming pack
Their opponents, also swinging sticks, attach the pack
ball, barely round, made of leather, emerges, smacked forwards by , who hurtles after it and collides with a stick swung by , a young and lithe American Indian
Inman falls, clutching his nose
The ball bobbles on the ground in front of him
He grabs it and gets to his feet, the blood pouring from his nose
His team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge
pulled by an impressive horse, comes down towards the town
It has to pass across the temporary field of play, parting the teams
Some of the contestants grab their shirts to restore propriety as the Cabriolet and its two exotic passengers passes by
The driver is a man in his early fifties, dressed in the severe garb of a minister,
And next to him, a self- conscious girl in the spotless elaborate, architectural skirts of the period, is his daughter,
Inman, using his shirt to staunch his battered nose, looks at Ada, astonished by her
An angel in this wild place
Now Swimmer stops chanting and begins, more hesitantly, to translate into English: (
) You will be lonely
You will howl like a dog as you walk alone
You will carry dog shit cupped in your hands
You will be smeared with dog shit
Your spirit will wane and dwindle to blue, the colour of despair
As the Cabriolet passes,  takes the ball an with a whoop starts to run towards the opposing goal
The game resumes
Ada looks back as the men swarm into each other, sticks and fists flailing
turns on a huge barbecue
The battered teams eating, drinking hard liquor, rehearsing victory and defeat, illuminated by a roaring bonfire
Swimmer is sewing up a gash in Inmans cheek as he continues to translate: This is your path
There is no other
That's a curse you can use on the Yankee before battle
And that works
You have to say it in Cherokee
You said it to me in Cherokee
During this, Monroe and Ada have arrived, escorted by , a local woman, middle-aged, kindly, and her husband, , a glorious curmudgeon
The Monroes are introduced to various locals
Inamn watches them, on the other side of the crowd
The Reverend Monroe, his daughter Ada
Up from Charleston, bringing God's word to you heathens
Is Esco's preferred introduction
Building a church
Inman watches Ada, moves his head to keep her in view as Swimmer stitches, and winces with pain
So keep your head still
Sally collects plates for the Monroes
Hands them to Ada and her father, who wait, patiently, for silverware
Esco takes a plate, picks up a skewer of meat, bites on it
Monroe pluckily follows suit
(to Swimmer) Anyway, there won't be any war
And if there is, they say it won't last a week

30TH, 1864 The pastoral lush green Virginia surfaces from its hole
Peace and beauty
second  shakes itself from the ground, darts into open ground to confront the , Massive wooden barricades in the shape of crosses, rows of 's, define the two lines
The Federals have been laying siege for months
So early and it's already hot
The trees are an oasis of green in a world of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches
, the men are rousing, boiling water for coffee or to shave, smoking, stiff from night
There's a large gun emplacement and some men still sleep against the stub-nosed cannon
Another  is disturbed from its hole
Ears pricked up to a distant rumbling
dark hole
Some evil place
scraping sound
Shapes burrowing forwards at a crouch
silent purpose
Young , freshly recruited, approaches a group of men, like him Highlanders from Company  of the 25th North Carolina Regiment
He doles out breakfast
Inman, loading his heavy LeMats pistol, its nine rounds, is not hungry
Oakley serves another, , last seen in the scrum at Cold Mountain
Oakley keeps his head low as he serves
Don't worry, son
Those Yankee boys keep store hours
They ain't open yet
Shadows and shapes
rumbles along the tunnel
It reaches a kneeling figure, who rolls it forwards
relay team
At the end of the tunnel, where it widens, a man, naked to the waist, crouches, stacking the barrels
, scared up, darts along the trench
Rourke sees it, beckons to another Cold Mountain boy, Butcher
That's fresh breakfast
Shoot him
'm not firing, start the damn war off
Butcher chases after the rabbit, Rourke in raucous support
The crouching man has wrapped   around the last barrel, and now retreats, paying out the wire as he does so, as each man in the tunnel crawls backwards behind him
Rourke weaves through the gun emplacements, laughing
That's my rabbit
Great sport
Inman, fifty yards away, looks over, amused, goes back to his gun
The fuze wire is lit
It fizzes towards the barrels
Rourke is running '      , the earth swelling
135  , 90  , 30
, , Pandemonium
The Confederates are in complete disarray
The Federals pour forwards across   , through the peaceful oasis of trees, roaring the roar of attack
They flood towards the crater, hundreds of them, charging into a dense and impenetrable
'        ' , arriving at an insurmountable wall of mud
The Confederates regroup
Orders are yelled
Chaos developing into battle
The Confederates begin firing into the crater
Guns and mortar wheel round and empty into what is becoming a terrible death trap
Inman gets to his feet
Oakley with him, and rushes through the smoke to the pit, emptying his LeMats into the crater
:    from the Union join the attack
Bodies falling on bodies as the Federals charge in and pack their comrades even tighter
The Confederates make a pincer movement outside the Crater, forcing all the Federals in
It's Medieval
No escape
jump into the pit to engage the Federals
Hand to hand fighting
Too close for rifles, just bayonets, and guns swung like clubs and Inman sliding down into that hell, tiring the nine rounds, then the shotgun charge, which does a terrible damage
Primitive
Unutterable carnage
Men killing each other in embraces, soldier crushed against soldier, desperate to survive, to kill, to live
An oozing layer cake of bodies, dead and frantically alive, drowning in slick
loses his rifle and picks up a magazine case, clubbing his opponent, then slips onto him and is stuck with a bayonet, the pain of which makes him squeal
He's a warrior, punching and stabbing and firing
coldly efficient killer
He's grabbed from behind and crushed, a hand gouging at his face, an almighty struggle
He falls and lands on top of Oakley, and he and his Federal opponent fight to the death with the wounded boy as their pillow
The slaughter continues over and around them, the sound, the sound of hell and madness
The boy has his arm around Inman, like lovers
: The Confederates run after the retreating Union soldiers, firing, cavalry riding them down
Inman stands, the boy's blood all over him, exhausted and appalled
The crater, behind him, an abattoir of men
The victors are yelling, pumped mad with adrenaline
Butcher comes alongside Inman
That was something
That's hell and we've been there
Kicked old Nick's asshole
sits up as Butcher celebrates
Butcher runs over, but can't find a charge for his musket
He looks around in the stack of corpses, pulling out weapons, tries one: not loaded, throws it down, tries another: not loaded
The wounded man can't get up, tries to drag himself like a crab away from Butcher
Inman yells at him, appalled
You got a charge
He picks up another musket
It fires
The wounded Federal slumps back, dead
The dead being piled up for burial, divided into allegiance
Wounded prisoners able to walk are led away
great deal of casual looting
Of boots, of equipment, of personal items
Inman sees a soldier in the crater, lining up wounded Federals, putting their heads in a row , ,    , Inman turns away, sees another Rebel, extravagantly costumed, a strange  head protruding from his knapsack
This is He's bent over a dead Federal, examining his mouth
He reaches behind his back and roots around in the knapsack, producing    , '
He's yanking away when connects with his head and knocks him to the ground
Startled, he looks up to see Inman hovering over him
That's gold in his mouth he got no need for
(shrugs) We take his boots
He examines his fiddle for damage
Some orderlies pass, lifting  away on a gurney
Oakley's pale as a maiden, the life leaking from him
Inman walks a way with him
Oakley looks up, desperate to be brave
got a few
You saw
saw
know you don't recognise me
'm Mo Oakley's boy
(Inman finds this incredible) It's okay
was thirteen when you all left
Am  going to die
Inman flicks his eyes to the Orderly, whose look confirms the boy's wounds are certainly mortal
Inman sits on the ground beside Oakley's cot
Around them, the wounded are certainly dying, makeshift care, oil lights, groans
'd like to hear some music while go
Inman walks around the campfires
He hears some fiddle music
It's Stobrod
Stobrod sees Inman
Inman stares, his expression an instruction, the turns and walks away
Stobrod stands over Oakley
Consults with Inman
What about Bonaparte's Retreat
That's one  play
Play me something sweet
Like a girl's waiting for me
Stobrod looks at Inman, confused
Play me something like there's nothing to fear from a merciful Lord
(to Stobrod) You heard him
(nervous) only know a couple of tunes
Like when you're thirsty up at Bishop's Creek and the water is so cool
Inman glares at Stobrod
And Stobrod starts to play
Hesitant, then with gathering confidence, improvising, increasingly expansive, as if he's as surprised as everyone else
Oakley's lips move
whisper
Inman leans in
'm reaching Cold Mountain before you
Stobrod plays
It's wrenching
Oakley stills
Inman abruptly puts his hand on the neck of the fiddle, stopping Stobrod
The boy is dead
Inman gets to his feet and walks away
dozen men in the tent
Inman has a , its cover gone, rolled up and tied with a leather strap
His bookmark is of a solemn young woman
He unwraps the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next to his bedroll
An  comes into the tent, approaches Inman, who makes a stand
Don't get up, soldier
You are mentioned tonight in my report
You are a credit to the Highlands, to North Carolina and to the Cause
(tight) Do you have news, sir, on my application for transfer
know
bloody day
It's what our General said: Good thing war is so terrible else a man might end up liking it too much
Sir
It was my understanding the medical corps was desperate for volunteers
Right now, soldier, it's me who is in need of volunteers
There's a dozen Yankees in that stand of trees between us
Stuck there from the retreat
Come daylight they can shoot us down for sport
beautiful night
Lots of stars
Inman and three others, including Butcher, slide over the top of the trench, far to one side of the stand of trees
The plan is to cast a wide arc that will bring them around back of the trees, closer to the enemy side than their own
The four men slither over the ground
They pause
Inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses
He slithers over them
They work their way towards the trees They are dozing
Only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the Confederate lines, the others have their backs to the enemy, sitting against the trunks, grabbing a few minute's sleep
As the four rebels approach, still crawling, one of the Federals opens his eyes, sees the attack, shifts for his rifle
,  , killing him and two others, while Butcher throws himself at another
The exchanges are brief and savage and one of Inman's party and all of the Federals lay dead
Then the rebels break from the trees
goes up, then another, both from the Confederate trenches Shots follow, from both sides, aimed at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own lines
As they get close, voices cry out, rippling down the trench, joining their own admonitions: Don't shoot, Hold your fire, they're our boys, Hold your fire
They're almost home
Butcher is laughing, whooping
Then just as suddenly he falls, wounded
Inman stops, turns back, runs to him
Inman collects Butcher, drags him, carries him
They're fifty yards from their lines
He goes down like a tree, blood pouring from his neck
Lying on the ground, he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly fade to black, all sound fading with them
,
3 swings across the view of the Blue Ridge
Men are swarming over the roof of an unfinished , below which appears the small town of
Among the workers, armed with nails and hammer, knees clutching a rafter, is Inman, fresh and a whole lifetime younger
Rourke and Butcher are also there hammering, building, kidding around and Oakley, barely a teenager
Below them, women are setting up a lunch for the workers, amongst them
She has the circumspect air of the blue stocking, uncomfortably aware of the dirt beneath her hem, the men's radar for her every move
Inman watches her as Sally Swanger approaches
(to Ada, as Monroe moves off) Ada, how are you settling in
Are you liking the farm
Very much
It's beautiful country
So listen -- if you would say hello to one of these fools, 'll get a field cleared this weekend
Anyone
Like a forfeit
(pointing at Inman who immediately looks away) No
Him in particular, up in the rafters
Been pressing me all morning
, the men are preoccupied with talk of secession from the Union
(hammering) call this nail: Northern Aggression
(hammering) call this nail: a free nigger
Show some respect -- these nails are making a church
(hammering) call this nail: respect the church
Ada comes over, carrying a tray of lemonade glasses
Calls up to Inman
Hello
Inman swings down
He feels the other men staring, burning a hole in his head
'm Ada Monroe
'm Inman
Inman
Inman
Inman
Repeating a thing doesn't improve it
(shrugs) People call me Inman
If you were to take a glass of lemonade your friends might stop staring
Inman
They're not my friends
He drops down to ground level, takes the lemonade, scowls at the other guys
They're breaking for lunch and as they make their way to the trestle tables -- they enjoy jostling Inman
Thank you
And what do you do
work wood
Got a piece of land
Mostly work wood
Clear fields
(uncomfortable) can clear a field
So, was there something in particular you wished to say to me
(thinks about it) Not that comes to me
(hands back the glass) 'll say thank you for the lemonade
And he turns and joins the other men gathering round the tables for lunch
Ada watches him, intrigued
Rourke and co
approach  , a known sympathizer with the North, to give him a bad time
Esco loves the Yankees
prefer a Yankee to a halfwit
Inman arrives just as Rourke points a warning finger at Esco
He pushes the finger down to get by
Esco continues: What is it you think you'd be fighting for
The South
And what's that when it's at home
Esco's sons,   , who're working at the other end of the building, have now arrived at the table
Pop, you causing trouble
No
That means yes
You cut the wood, you carry the water for good old King Cotton
Now you want to fight for him
Somebody has to explain it to me
(to Rourke and the others) Don't even try
The others are desperate to tease Inman
How's the lemonade
Sweet
Ada, at the lemonade stand again, watches them laughing at Inman, who keeps his head fixed on the table
,   , carried, someone with a cloth to his neck, which is soaked through with blood
They start to run with him, heading for the field hospital, worried that he will die before the wound can be staunched, cauterized
Throughout,    , discordant notes jangling: -- from  , lashed to a cart, as it bounces along the lane, passing the Swanger Farm
Sally comes out to look
It's Ada riding next to one of the farmhands, a second boy keeping watch over the piano
Sally goes over
That's a fine looking thing
've been missing it
Thank you, by the way
(from Ada's quizzical look) Inman's down in the bottom field, clearing his debt
Oh dear
And then he had nothing to say
He was happy
Really
Are men so different in Charleston
Men
don't know
don't even know what a woman should be like
In Charleston  was called a thistle, twice, by two different men
Both of them -- they were hunting for a simile, what was  like -- and thistle came right to them
If you're saying you might like him, why not go down and say hello
, Inman's working in the field, stripped to his undershirt, hot work, wielding a scythe
He hears something and looks up at the edge of the lane,     , which is still strapped to the cart
She briefly raises a hand to Inman, then nods to the farmhand who sets them on their way again
Inman smiles, waves back, watching as the cart rumbles off down the track
It's pouting with rain
, Men and women crowd into the parlour, in best clothes, celebrating the completion of the Chapel
Inman is outside on the porch, his coat soaked, water pouring off his hat
He looks at Ada
She finishes
Monroe steps in front of the applause, smiling
His words of thanks leak through the window to Inman, who stands, watching, listening
, Monroe circulates, with Ada
He nods at a group of men, who congregate in one part, not mingling
Their leader, , might be a minister himself, favouring a black dress coat, a black crow in the corner, eyes flashing
Ada doesn't know them
Esco comes by
Monroe puts a hand on his arm
Esco, our friends there -- (indicating Teague and co
) -- they helped build the Chapel
That's Teague and his boys
'd recommend you kick them out except a man don't kick a snake
One time the Teague family owned the whole of Cold Mountain
My farm, your farm, all belonged to his grand-daddy
Teague wanted this place bad
You got it
He's here sniffing out an advantage
There's no advantage here, but to celebrate a job well done
Cheers -- (he raises his glass) -- and thank you
And Teague raises his glass across the room
Ada appears at the door opening it onto the porch
She's carrying a tray with drinks
Acknowledges Inman
Were you planning to come inside
'm wetter than a fish
There's a good fire going
'm all right
Somebody said you were enlisting
(no response) Are you
If there's a war we'll all fight
(unimpressed) If there's a mountain we'll all climb, if there's an ocean we'll all drown
Call a thing a war makes it a challenge to some men
Did you get a picture made
Say again
tintype, with your gun and your courage on display
You're laughing at me
don't know you
You're always carrying a tray
'm taking a drink over to the negroes in the barn
(takes the tray) 'll do that
can't get much wetter
He goes into the night rain
She watches him
beautiful day, the farm peaceful
Inman walks up the path to the farmhouse, its borders flowering and pretty, a slave woman weeding
He knocks on the door
Monroe answers
Mr
Inman
Reverend
What can  do for you
Inman hovers, awkward
Ada appears, awkward
have some sheet music
Belonged to my father
No use to me
Ada comes forward, takes the package
You must come in
should probably get along
Mr
Inman is more comfortable outdoors
Perhaps we might take a walk
splendid idea
Monroe and Inman and Ada touring the farm
It's a biggish property, over three hundred acres
And well-tended by the dozen slave farmhands who work it, some of whom are dotted about in the landscape
Rolling mountains dominate the view
(expansive) want to get sheep into this field
big field doesn't look right without sheep
You're a lucky fellow, Mr
Inman, you've had this view all your life
think so
It's a special view
dragged my poor daughter to Cold Mountain from Charleston because of my Doctors -- they say my heart is weak -- so the air's meant to do me good
But it's the view  think heals
Ada walking behind, comes alongside the two men, threading her arm into her father's but, by so doing, also arriving next to Inman
have to get on my visits
Can offer you a ride back into town
Inman looks at Ada
No word
, From the window Ada watches the Cabriolet head towards town
At the piano, she unwraps the leather lace from the package of music
Inside the first book of music, there's a with his LeMats, a typical Confederate pose
Some of the music has left its imprint on the picture, the notes like a melody over Inman's face
Ada picks them out on the piano
The ebullient sound of Shape Singing
noisy choir letting rip -- ,   ,  20TH, 1861 --     ,    : Monroe conducts, sings
Inman is there, as is Ada
He fixes on her neck, the way the hair falls
The door bursts open
Young , apologetic nod to Monroe, sits at the back, then leans forward, as the singing continues, to say something to Rourke, who says something to Butcher, the news spreading like wildfire
Rourke gets up, leaves
Butcher gets up next, follows
Another man
Another
Depleting the male voices, until only women and some of the older men are singing and one side of the church is practically empty
Inman, remains, fixed on Ada
Who does not look round
, Those left in the congregation now spill out into what has become a melee as the    goes up
Enormous excitement, particularly among the boys, who now seem curiously attractive to the girls
Inman blinks out into the sun, Ada finds him
They're awkward as they watch other sweethearts embracing
Well, you have your war
, their horses clearing a path amongst the celebrating crowd
Teague reins in his horse and rides it up against Esco Swanger
Those who follow Lincoln, or preach abolition, best keep one eye open when they're sleeping, Old Bogey Man might get you
Inman steps between Esco and Teague, holding the reins of Teague's horse, easy and dangerous
Are you the law all of a sudden
Teague produces a document, which he waves in the air
That's right, son
Home Guard for Haywood County
'm the law from today
You all go fight now
We'll watch your sweethearts
And he spurs on his horse, his fellow Home Guard falling in behind, riding on over the ridge
Inman walks to Ada
You might be safer back in Charleston
But then who'll be waiting for you
She puts a hand on his arm for a second
They both want to get to the point of declaration but don't know how
They stand, people noisy around them, those about to leave, those about to be left
'm going to walk back inside the Chapel
And he does so, making his meaning clear for her to follow
, Inman walks inside
Stands with his back to the door
It opens and closes
Inman turns
It's Monroe
Did you want a quiet word
Now the door opens again and it's Ada
She's dismayed to see her father
Just some quiet
Of course Ada
He indicates they should both leave
Inman sits at a bench
Monroe and Ada come into town in their cabriolet
They pass under banners proclaiming the Confederate cause: Old Rip's Awake
Watch out Yankees
The trap draws up by the Cold Mountain General Store
Monroe lets Ada down
(of his appointment) 'll daresay Dr
'Brien'll want to do a test or two
And then there'll be a coffee or two, a brandy or two
Monroe smiles in acknowledgement, gets back in the trap
Ada heads into the store
, wearing pants and a vest
His room is like a monk's cell
Nothing in it
Inman's trunk is packed
He's polishing his boots, in his bare feet
One hand inside the boot, the other blacking it
There's a knock at the door
He opens it
It's Ada
He abruptly closes the door on her
, Ada waits outside
She's not sure what's happening
Then Inman opens the door
He's buttoning his shirt
His boots are on, one conspicuously dirty, one highly polished
Somebody walks up the stairs, carrying a jug and bowl
They separate as the man passes them
They're tender, awkward
found you this book
William Bartram
They tell me it's good think he writes about these parts, the author, so
Inman takes it
She has something else
Wrapped in paper
And this
(hands it to him) 'm not smiling in it
don't know how to do that, hold a smile, so now 'm solemn
Ada
What
, pressing into her, his arm circling her waist
Below them the sound of a
It's the and brings Rourke and Butcher racing down the stairs
Inman pulls away from Ada as the boys hurtle for the front door
Let's go
Rourke, Butcher, and then Inman appear in the doorway of the Rooming House, and then fall in with the motley crew of Volunteers The town is out to wish them well, parents, younger brothers, sweethearts walking alongside their brave men
Ada comes to the door of the Rooming House
Inman looks back and sees her, but almost immediately loses her in the crowd ,   , -- , -- with the seriously injured snakes past the back of the Confederate lines -- its suburbs of supplies, arriving and departing troops -- and into peaceful country ,
It's a cauldron, and those able smash through the wooden walls to make a breathing hole
Some have their heads thrust out like crated poultry
, neck bandaged, its ugly seepage making a bloody necklace
The light plays black and white through the boarded sides of the boxcar, flashing on Inman's face as he drifts in and out of consciousness
He focuses and sees the strange head of '
Stobrod is serenading him, accompanied by an angel-faced and extremely heavy child-man, , whose grin of delight seems permanent even in this claustrophobic, grim world
Inman is panicked, puts a hand to push the fiddle away
His voice is a croak, spoiled
'm not dying
(to Pangle) What'd he say
Says he ain't about to die
(to Inman) Truth to tell they say you are, Soldier
We'll meet again, in the better world
He changes his tune, and the tempo, finding a foot-slapping rhythm, the two musicians grinning at each other
Inman lapses back into unconsciousness
The rhythm becomes a hammering sound
, --         '  into the wooden porch of the Chapel, where it joins many other portraits of those lost to the war
Monroe presides
One of the slaves from Black Cove holds the ladder for the bereaved father
Other families wait, with their own daguerreotype to mount
It's a memorial service without bodies
Riders approach
Home Guard
Teague brings his horse up alongside Monroe at the Chapel door, tips his hat in condolence to the bereaved families
With him is a young, intensely beautiful and flamboyant rider, , his hair long, a single fingernail bizarrely overgrown
Somehow sinister
My condolences to you all
(he considers the slave) Keep an eye on the negro
They want what the white man got -- all of you watch out your brave boys give their lives to war and meantime your slaves carry murder, rape and arson to your firesides
The only slaves within twenty miles labor on my farm
They're good Christians and 'll vouchsafe for them
Cold Mountain at its loveliest
The  with Monroe and his daughter heads towards the farm
At a bend they meet a couple of riders, , from Teague's Home Guard, riding furiously past them
Monroe reins in the trap and lets them thunder past before continuing on their way home
Monroe is intrigued by Ada, as if he's never looked at her before
What
You're looking -- at this moment, don't know why -- you're looking exactly like your mother
Every time you see the doctor you get melancholy
He listens to my heart and  get emotional
He gives you alcohol and you get emotional
She squeezes his arm
We commiserate about the folly of this terrible war
(they ride in silence) Do you worry when there's no word from him
(no response) From Mr
Inman
Yes
But then 've tried counting the number of words which passed between Mr
Inman and me
(looking ahead, seeing smoke) Is that a bonfire
So close to the barns
Then they see     turn off the road as their cabriolet approaches, running away into the fields
What's going on
(shouting at the disappearing slaves) Hey
Stop there
Hey
Monroe gets out of the cabriolet and runs into the fields after the retreating family, who are carrying bundles, chairs, personal items, all loaded up
Ada has already taken the reins and has driven up to the house Monroe catches one of the women, remonstrates with her
She's upset, distressed, one of her sons comes back, pushes Monroe to the ground
They hurry away
Monroe gets up, hurries to the fire
, Monroe spies it as he catches up with Ada
Dear God
No, Daddy, it's not real
The figure swings round
'  , (appalled) What is wrong with us all
Ada turns and runs off
'll get help
(shouting over her shoulder) Keep away from the flames
Monroe stands and considers the flames
Ada turns back once more to see him -- a small man silhouetted against the blaze
, lies; bandaged, eyes closed, in , co-opted as one ward of a Confederate hospital
Rows of beds, the wounded and the dying, are lodged between some vestiges of the room's former glory
, conscious of their duty to the cause, are brought through by an exhausted doctor, who's lost all his grace
The windows are open, but it's still insufferably hot, the muslin curtains barely moving
Most of these men will be dead by the morning or, if they're stubborn, by nightfall
have other men outside in the quadrangle waiting for the beds
The women try to process this, the attitude
So, any kind word will be a blessing
One woman is overpowered by the stench, gags
It's the heat
'm sorry
They rot
The women begin to approach the beds
Don't pray
If they're not God fearing you can stir up a hornet's nest
, nervous, decent, sits next to
His mouth is moving
She doesn't know what he's saying
'm sorry, you want water
She bends to him again
His voice is a faint croak
Pigeon River
Little East Fork
The Doctor is on his exit, stops at the bed
'm sorry
don't know what he's saying
They ramble
Names of loved ones
(listening to Inman) Pigeon River
Is that a place
Cold Mountain
The Doctor shrugs, not a detective, moves on, stops at the man in the next bed
Has a brief look, calls to a nurse
This man is dead
Monroe and Ada are outside, a picnic at the summer table, autumn leaves blowing up around them
Nearby the charred skeleton of the barn
Ada gets up, clears away
Thank you
(staying her for grace) For your Providence, Oh lord, we thank you
Amen
That was the last of the ham
It was delicious
have to learn how to cook
was going to say something in Chapel
Perhaps some of the womenfolk will volunteer
can't have people coming here and cooking for me
It's my fault
should have raised you less like a companion and more like a young woman
'm sorry
'm not sorry, but  don't know how we'll get through another winter
Will you play me something
Something peaceful while  look over my sermon
Ada takes the dishes away
He gets out his papers, his pen and ink
, Chopin's Prelude in  Minor
Outside in the garden, Monroe has adjourned to his striped campaign chair, and is hunched over his notes
The door of the parlour is open and the music floats over to him as he works
Ada plays
appear at the window
Then the steady drumming of a summer shower
(still playing) Daddy, bring the tablecloth in with you
She plays some more
Monroe hasn't come in
The rain splashes on to the window
Daddy, come inside before you drown
After a few more bars, she stops playing and, curious, goes to the door
She stands at the doorway
' , , his hand dropped and visible to Ada as, with dread, she approaches
, ,
He's like a fish, his face shining with the rain, and glass eyed
She leans in to him, her head to his heart, then runs, oblivious to the rain, her dress already drenched, runs down the lane
(
) Dear Mr
Inman
, '  as he drifts in and out of consciousness
Mrs
Morgan, the hospital volunteer, sits by Inman's bed
She holds '  , badly weather damaged, the pages stuck together, the writing blurred where the ink has run
It's come to you by way of Virginia
There are various dates, which she decodes
It's not too recent -- written this past winter
'm afraid  can't read who it's from
Dear Mr
Inman, Ada is writing at her father's desk
lonely room
(
) -- 'm still waiting, as  promised would, but  find myself alone and at the end of my wits -- , Mrs
Morgan reads to Inman, trying to decipher the letter: -- at the end of my wits, so now say to you, plain as  can, come back to me
Come back to me is my request
(can't read the next bit) Then something  can't read, something, come back to me
Inman is very still
Then, eyes glinting with determination, gives a
(
) By order of Zebulon Vance, Governor of this great state of North Carolina: any soldier turned deserter is guilty of treason and shall be hunted down like a dog
Ada walks down the hill from the Chapel
There is an absence of young people, but the older folk are gathered round the General Store where a   is reading from a document
-- Any man takes in a deserter is likewise guilty of treason
The Official is flanked by Teague, Bosey and the twins, puffed up with self-importance
Ada has to walk around him to enter the store
The Home Guard is powered to enter any place it sees fit, without notice or constraint
Names of all deserters will be posted in every town, published in every newspaper
, The Official continues outside as Ada enters
Ada approaches Mrs Castlereagh, the owner
Is there a letter for me
Nothing -- we're getting no post through at all -- although if you slip out back the material you ordered has arrived
They go to the back of the store, to a screened-off area
Mrs
Castlereagh hands her over a packet of material
There's another, more furtive, transaction to take place
Mrs Castlereagh hands over a second parcel as if it were narcotics
Ada tears at the wrapping
It's a parcel of books
If folks knew  was taking deliveries from the North
know
Thank you so much
The sooner we lose this war the better
Already one boy gone, another with his leg took off at the knee
That's enough
What do you hear
All  know is they say not one boy in ten from these mountains is coming home again and most of them are deserters
, Ada emerges, almost collides with Teague
She wriggles past him, tries to make her package invisible
- '
solitary  jogs his horse through the frost, towards Black Cove farm
Ada is working at a handpump, failing to coax water from the well
She's wrapped in blankets
The farm is somewhat unkempt and so is she
The hem of her skirt is frayed
She rips at it tearing off a strip of material, which she binds around the handle in an attempt to thaw the mechanism
Then she looks up to see the horseman approaching
It's Teague
Ada immediately heads inside the house
Teague arrives at the house, takes a brace of  from his saddlebag
He heads for the gate
The gate needs oiling, the path is overgrown, he looks at the pump handle, the abandoned pitcher
Ada opens the door, pinning her hair
It's taken me too long, but 've come to pay my respects
Thank you
(hands over the rabbits) reckoned you might need fattening up
Ada takes them
She is very queasy with these dead animals
This house must bring bad luck
Killed my granddaddy to lose it, then my daddy died on account of not having it, then your daddy died on account of getting it
We should burn it down
Didn't somebody try
Lot to manage without help
Need a hand with that pump
No
'm happy to volunteer
But not to volunteer for the war
The war
wanted to go
But you know: too old, too literate
Plus got no spleen
Lost it from a horse's kick
You've got no spleen
That's the thing about an organ
You don't know you need it till you lost it
(suddenly busy with a bayonet) want to clear this path
can just as soon do it and talk as stand around and talk
Then you can say men beat a path to your door
'd really prefer it if you didn't do that
Would you rather  did my job
(scything at the path) See if there's any material  should confiscate
For the war effort
was raised in the good manners of the South where a gentleman doesn't enter a house with a woman alone
(now he's at the pump) Good manners didn't quite make it to these mountains
If it don't yield meat, or you can't sit on it, or suck on it
(he gets the pump going, water pours out) And you're sleeping all right
These cold dark nights
'm sleeping fine
It's going to be a long hard winter
He turns and stops at the gate, runs his hands through his hair and uses the grease to ease the hinge
Then steps up onto his horse, and rides away
Ada watches him
Shudders
Ada comes into the kitchen
weak oil-lamp reveals , partially covered on a plate, flies buzzing around them, a little liquid leaking from them
Ada takes a knife and contemplates skinning gutting them
Suddenly she gathers them up and runs out
The wind howls
She covers the little hole with soil and stones
Pumps out water to wash her hands
Thinks she hears a noise, listens, alert to any unfamiliar sounds, then hurries back to the house
Ada comes inside, she closes the door
Locks it
Puts a chair against it
Goes upstairs, to her bedroom
Ada enters her bedroom
It's a chaos of books, clothes, dishes
She closes the door, sets another chair against it
Then drags her armchair up against that, books and papers spilling onto the floor
She props up Inman's portrait, on, the chair, as if he were guarding her
Sits on the bed and, desolate, begins to write: , (
) Should  imagine you are dead and, that it is to your spirit  am writing
No word from you in all this time
If you receive this please know  am here and warring, too, with a faint heart
Some of those convalescing swim or are helped to paddle in the healing sea
There are rudimentary wheelchairs
Inman, a long way from home, is amongst those sitting in one of these, very still, grey and sick -- but alive
He pulls at the dressing on his neck, exposing the still raw and livid wound to the sea air
Inman has his Bartram, his bookmark is the battered and foxed picture of Ada, which he considers, before continuing to read
Behind him        , and behind them the Mansion which has become the hospital
series of bells, of shouts, and the slaves stop working, prepare for the long walk home, congregating, then forming a line, herded by the foremen
Inman eases his position to bend over and dip his bandage in the seawater
He brings the wet bandage to his neck, considers the ocean, his fellow ragtag of wounded, the slaves, the great fields, the Mansion
The whole meaning of this war around him
, -- , The men return to the Hospital which he roasts over a small fire
'   -- , --  tintype of  is added to the Chapel's votives, hammered in alongside Rourke and Butcher
There are fifty or more images now, the paint flaking around them
The exterior of the Chapel, three years on, has taken on the burden of recording history
There is no minister, no services, just the votives, daguerreotypes or simply the names of those missing in action, accompanied by tiny vases of wildflowers
The town shrouded in mist, and quiet
, like a Grimm's fairy tale of a deserted house
The fields are overgrown with weeds, the gardens abandoned
The chickens have deserted the henhouse and are wandering around the outbuildings, scuffing at the packed dirt
Sally and Esco come up the overgrown path, avoiding the chickens, and knock at the door
Ada
Ada, It's Sally
They're seen from ground level, through a boxwood, as their feet patrol the ground, turn away from the door, and then retreat, their voices drifting away
Ada is there, crouching in her hidey-hole, a blanket on the ground, her book
She wants to reveal herself, but is too embarrassed
Will you look at the state of this place
Poor soul
She's got nobody and nothing and three hundred acres of misery
During this a , black and gold, struts into the boxwood
As the rooster approaches, Ada shudders, tries to shoo it away without alerting her presence
Ada peers through the boxwood as Sally and Esco close the gate and recede
The rooster comes at her again
She rises up, kicking out at it, while he flares his wings, spurs flaying at her
Ada runs from the boxwood, tormented by the triumphant rooster, which continues to fly and scratch, driving her into the house
' Ada dabs at the scratches, her dress rolled down to the waist to reveal her arms and shoulders
Now she shucks off the dress completely and tries to find a clean replacement
There isn't one, so she hunts through the overflowing laundry basket for something less dirty
' , Ada enters her father's room, wearing undergarments
Everything as he left it and, in contrast to the rest of the house, extremely tidy
She opens a wardrobe, finds one of his coats, puts it on
It's much too big, and she rolls up the sleeves, catches her pinched face and disheveled face in a swivel mirror
She turns the mirror away and the image swings into -- , -- the figure of Inman walking, frail, grey
kind of lurching walk, as if his balance isn't guaranteed
He gets close to the gate and interests a Guard, on the lookout for would-be deserters
which he roasts over a small fire
He's always singing
Inman approaches
When Inman speaks, his voice is a croak
Getting better all the time
Seems that way
wouldn't hurry
War's almost done
Where'd you take your wound
Before  was born
Never saw a thing in this world, not a tree a gun or a woman
Though  put my hand on all three
Couple of things  felt back there 'd sure liked to have had a long look at
He's shoveling some peanuts into a twist of paper
What would you give for that
To have your eyeballs back for ten minutes
Ten minutes
Wouldn't give an Indian head cent
fear it might turn me hateful
That's sure what seeing's done to me
That ain't the way  meant it
You said ten minutes
It's having a thing and then the loss 'm talking about
Then we don't agree
There's not much  wouldn't give for ten minutes of someplace
Someplace or someone
Same difference
You watch yourself
They're shooting men who take themselves a walk
, Inman and a bunch of other walking wounded make their way, under supervision, towards the town
The grandeur of the approach, the carriages
The sorry state of the soldiers
, ,
Underneath the tables, boots -- laced together, origins various
The charitable womenfolk are helping match clothes to recovering soldiers, some of whom are still on crutches, or in wheelchairs
Inman finds a black dresscoat, some pants, a pair of boots
He accumulates a little pile
On his way out, shakes his hand and gives him an apple from the barrel
, Inman emerges from the Courthouse and joins the line for a shave at the makeshift barbershop set up outside the Courthouse
Two barbers, two chairs
, - , , ,
Next
Inman settles in the seat
The Barber contemplates his scraggy beard, the livid, scabbed wound on his neck
(nervous) 'll cut your hair, but  ain't about to shave you
That thing opens up, your head's liable to falloff
, It is almost dawn
The window by Inman's bed is a frame giving onto the still dark world
The Night Guard passes by on its patrol of the perimeter
- He gets his hat, pushes his book into his knapsack and, with one step up, , Inman, his footprints in the sand, as he hurries along by the edge of the ocean, away from the hospital
-- as Ada walks, the wind kicking up around her, past the Swanger place
She's bent and curiously dressed in her father's coat
(
) Ada
Sally Swanger calls out from the field
She's concerned at Ada's gaunt, ragged appearance
Ada waits for her approach
You're skinny as a whippet, girl -- you're coming indoors with me
can't
'm not --  need to clean some clothes
Great God, you ever looked at my husband
can't get him to wear decent Church clothes Christmas morning
Hang on to me, the wind'll blow you over
And she folds her arm into Ada's
They walk up the lane
Ada eats
Esco across from her contemplating her evident appetite, the oversized man's jacket
Sally ladles more food onto Ada's plate
Don't go back to that dark house
There's a bed here, least till our boys get home
That your daddy's coat
was saying to Sally,  wasn't expecting to be visiting, so
Don't suit you
He starts to chuckle, then Ada, too, then Sally
can't get up to your place this week
(of Sally) She's mad at me -- don't expect - -- more than  can do to keep this place half-managed
'm ready-to stop,  tell you
just want to sit on my porch with Sal, watch my boys in the field, holler good job
every hour or so
What about your people in Charleston
There are no people
And no money
My father had some bonds and investments
They're worthless now, of course, the war has
they're not worth anything
(they look at each other) love it here
In spite of everything
And waiting on a feller
look from Sally
Look down our well
(Sally's disgusted with him) She should
Look down our well with a mirror, you'll see the future
'what they say
(to Sally) You do it
Don't make that face
know it ain't rightly Christian, but it's what folks do, like when they dangle a needle over the belly to see if you're carrying a boy or a girl
What kind of mirror
, -- ,
' , , Ada is bent backwards over the well, a hand mirror glinting down into the blackness
The reflection is elusive against the bright evening sky, the sun almost set, and low
See anything
don't know
tried many a time, never saw a dickybird
The image is clearer
The trees sharpen, the figure walking, the steep incline of the corridor, all fiercely black and white as if it were a carpet of snow and black hieroglyphs of trees, and crows flying
The trick of the glass and the watery disc of the well surface
buzzing in Ada's ears, something like a distant music
Then the figure seems to suddenly pitch forwards, but at that moment, Ada -- canted over, getting dizzy has to move and the image flies away, replaced with the sky, the flash of the setting sun
You all right
Ada's faint
She sits up, blank, a little shaken
(
) Yesterday  found myself crouched over a well like a mad woman, which suppose  have become Inman walks along an expanse of marshland
Great cranes fly heavily over him
(
) -- and staring down into its secrets, thought  saw you there, walking back to me -- Ada is writing in her father's campaign chair, a blanket wrapped around her, a rake propped next to her
(
) -- or wished  did
(
) That cow wants milking
Ada looks up from her writing with a start
She covers her letter, guiltily, instinctively
In front of her, at the gate, is   ,  , She is barefoot, and dressed in a hand-dye_ shift of blue
Her name is
If that letter ain't urgent, the cow is -- is what 'm saying
don't know you
Old Lady Swanger says you need some help
Here  am
Ada is instantly defensive, intimidated
need help,  need,  do need help, but  need a laborer -- there's plowing and rough work and --  think there's been a misunderstanding
What's the rake for
The rake
Ain't for gardening, that's for sure
Number one -- you got a horse  can plow all day
'm a worker
Number two there's no man better than me cause there's no man around who ain't old or full of mischief
know your plight
My plight
Am  hard to hear cause you keep repeating everything
'm not looking for money, never cared for it and now it ain't worth nothing
expect to board and eat at the same table
'm not a servant
Do you get my meaning
You're not a servant
People'll have to empty their own night jars, that's my point
Right
And 'm not planning to work while you watch neither
Right
Is that a yes or a no
(looks at Ruby) Yes
There's half the day yet
Let's make a start
My name's Ruby
know your name
The rake: there's a rooster devil, 'm sure of it
He's Lucifer himself
go near him he's at me with his spurs
despise a flogging rooster
Where is he
Ada gets up, nods to the corner of the yard
Ruby goes over
The Rooster gathers himself up for a new opponent
Let's put him in a pot
Inman's walking on a track which passes through cornfields, the crop high and thick around him
He stops, hearing something
Riders
He wades into the field, seeking cover in the tall crop, lying in the dirt
Horses appear ,     : , ,
They have dogs, which sniff and growl, intrigued by the fields, called back by the Home Guard
Inman waits until they're well out of sight ,   , ,  ,  , He walks to the road, paying no heed to them
They assemble, paying no heed to him and move off in the opposite direction
Inman turns, looks at them
Hey
(they stop, turn) 'd pay a dollar for an egg
piece of cheese
They look at him, then continue on their way
' , Ada wakes up to persistent knocking
Ada
Ada
You up
Yes
(opening her eyes) It's still dark
Tell the cows that
It's late
, Ada enters blearily, clutching her novel
Ruby already busy
have to eat something
Then you have to get up earlier
(at Ada's book) What's that
novel
(heading outside) You want to carry a book carry one you can write in -- Ruby emerges, followed by Ada, chewing on a tomato
-- we got our own story
Called Black Cove Farm: a catastrophe
She looks back at Ada for a reaction
can spell it, too
-a-t-a-s-t-r-o- phe
Learned the same place you did, in the schoolroom
That's one of the first words they taught me
Ruby Thewes, you are a ca-t-a-s-t-r-o-p-h- e
They're heading for the stable
, Ruby's already pitching hay
Turns to Ada
You mucking out
Ada half-asleep, obedient, stunned by this energy
Three years  was in school before my daddy -- saying God rest his soul is like wishing him what he had in life, cause he lived to rest, he was born tired -- before my daddy decided there was better use for my backside than have it sat all day in front of a blackboard
, Ruby dictates a list to Ada as they bustle along
Number One -- layout a winter garden for cool season crops: turnips, onions, cabbage, greens
Ada scribbles, walks, scribbles
, Ruby up a ladder, inspecting the roof
Number Two: patch the shingles on the barn roof
Do we have a maul and froe
(writing, holding the ladder) Maul
-a-u-l
have no idea
, Ruby cleans out leaves and detritus from the stone channel, allowing the stream to flow free and cool
Number three: clay crocks for preserves
Tomatoes
Beans
Jams
, Ruby doing her version of soil analysis, scrunching the earth, tasting it, spitting it out
Ada makes a face
Clear and turn this field
No harm done letting it go fallow, now we'll do well
, Ruby looks up
Ada catches up with her
Number fifteen Sixteen
Number sixteen: let's get a martin colony going in the Gourd House
Keep away crows
You got one thing in abundance on this farm and that's crows
What's a Gourd House
, Ruby, delighted, contemplates the bounty of apples
There's survival
On them trees
(turns to an exhausted Ada) You got a cider press or would that be wishing on a blessing
Actually, yes,  think we do
Ruby whoops, jogs away
Ada, exhausted takes a bite of an apple, watches her
, ,      , the way itself broken and precarious, bad country to meet an enemy
Inman sees   in the distance, a torch flicking in and out of view, like a star to follow
He stops, narrows his eyes to focus on the view, listening hard
He pulls out the Lemats
,   ,    , The horse has a burden -- a sack or wrapped bundle draped over either side of the saddle
The attempts to heave the bundle onto his shoulders
He can't, and the bundle slips to the ground, cover falling enough to glimpse an arm, a head
The man tries again to lift her
He's clearly upset, despairing, his hat comes off to reveal long, dandy's hair, all extravagant curls
He staggers with the weight of the girl, heading for the lip of the deep gorge
He kisses the girl again and again, cheeks, mouth, mumbling to her
He's at the edge now and can just let her go '
Don't let go
Just back up, nice and steady, do this all in reverse, you're going to end up with her draped back over your animal
Don't pull that trigger
am a man of God
've killed several of them
mean  am God's minister
What part of God's business is throwing a woman down a gorge
slave woman, can you see that in this light
She's black as a bucket of tar
He's retreating, on his way back to the horse
Is she dead
Drugged her
Like you would a butterfly
And  care for her, that's the heartbreak of it
He has the girl back on the horse
Inman brings the torch up to his face
It's tear-stained
She's got my bastard in her belly
What kind of pistol is that  never saw the like of it
Inman leads the horse, with Veasey ahead of him, hands tied behind his back, desperate for a reprieve
'm begging you
It's better you blowout my brains than return me to this place
Where does she live
In our house
She sleeps in our kitchen
You don't know me, friend, but the good Lord punished me with want
am all appetite
That's all do all day is want: food, the female parts
Shut your mouth
don't want a sermon every time  ask a question
They're in the town's main drag now
There's a Chapel and next to it, a small house
This your place
Dear God of misery
You're going to put her back where she sleeps
do that the Members will lynch me
Consorting with a nigger, adultery, siring a bastard while serving as their preacher
We're a strict congregation we've churched men for picking up a fiddle on the sabbath
So you reckoned to kill her
Disgusted, Inman approaches the front door of the house
There's a back door
Have pity
And he leads Inman down a side path
Veasey comes in, now carrying the girl
Inman comes behind, the gun trained on Veasey as he sets her down by the fire
(whispering) Thank you
was going to do a grievous wrong
He looks longing at the girl as he puts the blanket around her shoulders
He turns to Inman
You tasted dark meat
Sweet as liquorice
think  should go back up to my wife
She wakes at the slightest noise
Inman is incredulous that he thinks he can just go to bed
You find me some paper and a pen
, Inman is pinning a sheet of paper above Veasey's head
It's covered in handwriting
dog barks
You're not entitled to judge me
You're nothing but an outlier, plain as daylight
Inman has pulled a handkerchief from Veasey's jacket
He stuffs it into his mouth, cutting this diatribe short
And then he walks away leaving Veasey tied to the tree, cursing through the handkerchief
' , Ada asleep
Ruby enters, shattering the calm
Morning
Pigs: you have any loose in the woods
No
What
No
We bought our hams
There's a world more to a hog than the two hams
Lard, for example, we'll need plenty -- She picks up some discarded laundry, contemplates the overflowing laundry basket
The catastrophe of Ada Monroe's laundry
(marching out) can feel you shutting your eyes
Ada and Ruby working with the horse to make the beginnings of
As they struggle with a heavy rail, Ruby is testing Ada
What's this wood
don't know
Locust
Where's North
North is, North is -- Name me three herbs growing wild on this farm
(frustrated with Ruby and with herself) can't
can't
All right
can talk about farming in Latin
Will that do
can read French
know Harmony and Counterpoint
know my Bible
can name the principal rivers of Europe, but don't ask me to name one stream in this county
can embroider, but  can't darn,  can arrange cut flowers, but  can't grow them
If a thing has a function, if  might do something with it, it wasn't considered suitable
Why
Ruby, you could ask why
about pretty much everything to do with me
They manage to get the first line of rail set down
This fence is about the first thing 've ever done that'll produce an actual result
So you never wrapped your legs around this Inman
An old-fashioned look from Ada
Inman finds himself in
He moves warily, his beard longer, his figure gaunt, his clothes weathering to a uniform smudge of charcoal
He hears     ,
He picks up his pace, skirts round the swampy lake
Inman comes to the bank of a
The water, as the light begins to go, is the color of mud, with bubbles, belching to the surface, full of ugly prominent
Inman is almost jogging now, an ear tracking his still distant pursuers
The river is too wide to contemplate swimming and now it begins to curve left, forcing him -- against his judgment, to circle back
He approaches
sign: Ferry $5
Yell Loud
On the far bank there's     above the highwater mark
Inman calls out, reluctantly, his voice still a kind of growl
Then again
steps out of the cabin and waves before jumping into a small canoe
The canoe heads against the current, the rower's back bent with the effort
As the canoe approaches, Inman sees that the ferryman is, in fact,   , not eighteen
She doesn't look at him
He produces five dollars
She eyes the bill with contempt
For five dollars  wouldn't give a parched man a dipper of this riverwater
Sign says ferry, five dollars
This look like a ferry
My Daddy's dead, or gone off to the Federals, don't matter which
'm the way across now
What's the name of this thing
Nothing but the mighty Cape Fear River, is all
dog barks in the distance
Getting closer
Inman turns to the sound
The Ferrygirl is well aware of her leverage
Nobody crosses this water unless they're running from someplace
Some cross one way, some the other: makes no difference, they're all running
You want to wait for your friends
can give you thirty dollars script
Let's go
(
) Hey
Hey
Wait
Inman is astonished to see  stumble out of the trees
His head is shaved, his face bruised and swollen, his clothes castoffs and ill-fitting, cinched at the waist with rope
He stumbles towards Inman, urging him to get on with the journey
Keep going
We're both in trouble
He gets straight into the canoe
No
Get out
It's Homeguard
Made me tell them all about you
should have shot you when  had the chance
Shouts, more barking
Inman jumps in the canoe, and they're off
The Ferrygirl turns the boat around, rows them away from the jetty with the grace of someone doing something for the thousandth time
'm not looking for revenge, by the way
For what you did to me
No, 'm a Pilgrim now, like you, traveling the road, paying our dues, relying on the kindness of strangers
You're nothing like me and the last thing  want right now is a conversation
(to Ferrygirl) You recall Job in the scriptures will give free utterance to my complaint
will speak in the bitterness of my soul
That's our friend here
(to Inman) They cut off my hair
Which was hard
was vain about my hair
(to Ferrygirl) had good curls
But  deserved it
'm the Reverend Veasey
Have  seen you in church
Inman sits, scouring the bank for sign of his pursuers
The sun is sinking fast
'm saving for a cowhide, and when get it  aim to get a saddle made, and when  get me a saddle 'll save for a horse, and when  got a horse 'll throw on the saddle, and then you won't see my sorry ass round this swamp again
She has no love for the river
Another gurgle of viscous bubbles around the canoe
What's that
Catfish
'gator
Keep your hand in the boat
Already looks like some critter chewed his neck
(she looks at Inman) Thirty more dollars, we can go to the cabin
'll pull this dress over my head
(excited) Have we got thirty dollars
sharp sound, a tiny thwack of ball on meat
The Ferrygirl and falls into the water
Veasey grabs out at the oar, but it goes, too
The girl sinks quickly,    to the side of her head
Inman, on his knees and stretching, can't help her
Then a second noise as appears in the canoe, just at waterlevel
Water pours into the canoe
Dogs bark, and now are visible at the jetty
One of them has a sniper's rifle and is loading for a third shot
Inman can see him sighting the rifle
They lie flat in the canoe
is gouged out
Now the boat is almost full of water
Veasey spits out a foul mouthful , Veasey surfaces from under it, clutching the wood as a raft, but the canoe        and he sinks
Veasey hauls him to the surface and, surprisingly strong, holds him with one fist, the boat with the other, lets the current take them, pulling them under, then up, under, then up, but clinging on, as the rifle continues to deliver its assault, another shot into the boat, another into the water near to Veasey's arm
'  comes by them, carried by the river, the dress billowing out almost covering her head
The sun has gone, the light fading, the canoe sliding downriver away from their aggressors
In the moonlight, the canoe drifts into the muddy bank and Veasey drags a half-drowned Inman to land, both of them retching with the vile river water
eases into the river not ten feet from where they lie, lungs heaving
They get up
Veasey to his feet, Inman to his knees
You okay
Inman nods, coughs
And Veasey    at Inman's head, knocking him back into the mud
Jesus, god
figure that righteous, given our history
Otherwise 'd bear a grudge on our journey
There's nowhere 'm going with you except to Hellfire
' Ada, her hair plaited in a new and simpler configuration, is working on Ruby's hair, while Ruby experiments with some earrings
pile of Ada's jewelry on the bed beside them
Agricola poetis viam non monstrat
Which means
The farmer does not point out the road to a poet
Which means
Should be the other way round Which means,  suppose, which means the poet should know where he's going
(of Ada's hairdressing) It's no wonder you're helpless and hopeless if it takes this long to fix your hair
(of the Latin) Say some more
Terra mutata non mutat mores
(can't believe she knows all these phrases by heart) It's appalling what's in my head
It's appalling what's in my head
No, it means:  change of place does not change a character
Well that's surely true even in English
You can keep those earrings
We can't keep anything
have to keep the bangles
They were my mother's
Well that's all
The rest is for trading
Else they can bury you in your finery
(of her hair) You're done
There's a small mirror on a stand
It has Inman's picture stuck in it
She picks it up, removing the tintype, and holding it up for Ruby to see her hairstyle
Good God
Okay
She takes the mirror and shows Ada her simple plait
like it
Takes two minutes
That's what like
She puts the earrings back in the pile
How much do you love that piano
jangles down the rutted lane on the back of Mr
Roy's cart
Ada watches,    of sheep milling around her in the path
Ruby is dragging a big sow towards the yard
Ada picks up one of two sacks and staggers towards the house
, Ada arrives in the kitchen
They've got it under control now, scrubbed and orderly
She puts the sack down next to another one
Her hands are calloused, the finger nails cracked and ruined, stripes of earth under them
Ruby comes in, struggling with the last sack, pleased
We're careful we'll get through the winter now
made old man Roy give me ten of those sheep on account of said they were so small put together they were no bigger than six proper sheep
My father always wanted sheep on this land
'm sorry you had to lose your piano
cut off my hair once, for money
My daddy got two dollars for it
Made a wig for a rich feller in Raleigh
They're working as they talk, taking the sacks into the larder, putting out stuff for the evening meal
Stobrod called himself a musician -- my daddy -- he could play six tune on a fiddle
Got himself shot dead at Petersburg
was like his goat or some creature tethered to a post
He left me once, up the mountains was eight
He was gone over two weeks
Oh Ruby
(defiant) was all right
He'd walk forty miles for liquor and not forty inches for kindness
And your mother
Never met her
We're the same in that regard
He said she was -- he told me a thousand stories -- she was a wolf or an indian or a donkey
Don't say much for him, except you know he'd be fast to work up a sweat on a tree if he thought there was pleasure in it
There's a pause
Ruby not easy with her emotions
Abruptly she jumps up
There's cows to milk
, Inman stands in the river, hoping to catch a fish, trying to concentrate
Veasey presides, complaining
Used to be as regular as morning prayers
Matter of fact  could set my watch by my bowels
That beeswax you fed me, day before yesterday, it stops a man up
Open my gut now they'd find turds stacked up like little black twigs
On a parallel track across the river,
impossible to say whether Home Guard or a Federal Raiding Party
Inman splashes out of the water, pushes Veasey down, silencing him
The riders pass
Veasey spots something shining in the grass, picks it up
'   -
Hey
Look at this
(flexing it) This is a good saw
(getting up) It's not yours
You take it, you make us another enemy
You're a Christian -- don' t you know your commandments
You'll find the good Lord very flexible on the subject of property
We could do a lot with this saw
Inman is vexed, walks away
Veasey follows, experimenting with the saw's music when flexed
Inman stalks on
Inman way ahead, full of purpose
Veasey still has the saw, trots to catch up
Why you in such a hurry the whole time
(no answer) Hurry or slow the destination is always the same
It's only the journey that is different
That's either in the Good Book or  made it up
Inman suddenly stops, scowling, puts up a hand, listens
Inman carefully scouts the track then, with great caution, edges towards the river bank
labours in the water
He's contemplating which has slipped into the ford and died
The man is wet and exasperated
Good day to you
The man turns, his spirit evidently lifted by the prospect of help
His name is
He's working on roping the animal
My old bull, wandered off and died in this here creek
Fouled up our water is how  found it
Veasey is immediately an authority on bull removal
This is a tricky one
The three men contemplate the carcass, swatting away the swarms of flies
Junior offers a swig from a jug of liquor
Inman refuses, Veasey takes a long pull, shudders happily
The name for the Bull's member is a tassel
learned that and never forgot it
Reckon  need a train of mules
(walking away) 'm getting an idea
My saw is the remedy
Let's saw up some wood and make levers
Then what
Lever him out
This'll work
He walks into the wood
Where you two sports heading
(inscrutable) don't know where he's heading
'm going down the road
And  got a good way to go before nightfall
(acknowledging his attitude) Charitable of you to make a stop
Ain't for me to be curious
(emerges from the woods) How do you work this damn thing
(to Veasey) Give me that saw
(to Junior) Come on
He takes the saw, walks to the bull, gets on one side, indicates Junior should go to the other
Let's do this in chapters
And they begin to    '
, and they're in
The stomach opens and its contents gush into the creek
Veasey is disgusted, draws back
The two other men haul up the rest of the animal onto the banks
They're exhausted
You might want to leave off that water for a day or two
There'll be a tang, 'd imagine
' Junior, Inman and Veasey come around a bend and there's It's in such poor repair that one end has slipped from the stones which serve as it's foundation and Junior roots up another hidden jug of liquor, which he drinks from, then hands to Veasey
There's my place
Hope you can stomach a yard chock-full of females
Brought my woman home, she showed up with her three so-called sisters and their brats
The noise in that place is something awful
It's why  go hunting
(considering the wild camber) Looks a bit crooked
It is on a bit of a tilt
Them females
They all roll down one end each night
-- Roll me over
-- In the clover One good fart -- that'll tip over
They guffaw, delighted in the alcohol haze
Veasey suddenly exclaims, hand in the air, rushes into the bushes
Oh God of my God
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
What's up
The Israelites
The tribes of Israel are about to flee from the banks of Egypt
Hallelujah
(explaining to Junior) He's got a shit coming on
It's overdue
(bewildered) And he's a Preacher
Like a Christian
Like a Christian
Good God
' The three men arrive at the yard , one after the other each of them in simple shifts which seem to emphasis their voluptuousness, or so it seems to Veasey
They freely stare
These two boys is stopping for supper
They're on the road to Atonement
The women consider the men, then disappear back inside
Atonement is not a place
So what is it when it's at home
Those are fine examples of the female
Take them all and leave the saw
Be a sight more use
(reappearing) If they want to get in a tub there's an hour before food
They love to scrub a man
(to Shyla) Put the water on the boil
(back to the men) It's my liquor, gets their titties swinging
(excited) God damn
(to Inman) was right about sheep droppings those stools -- like rock hard
Quite astonishing
' No real furniture
Veasey is shaving
Inman stows his knapsack behind the woodburning stove, on which a big kettle of boiling water steams away
Then he gets in the tub, his back to the door
Shyla comes in, brings the kettle over to the tub, pours in the steaming water
She appraises Inman
It's intensely sexual
That's battered flesh
(of his neck wound) could work a finger in there
He's a hero
Took that wound at Petersburg
He doesn't know what  am
(uncomfortable with her stare) Thanks
(to Veasey) He's shy, ain't he
Wait up a few minutes, 'll be in that tub, then we'll see who's a shy one
want to poke my thumb in his holes
second woman comes to the door
Dolly
Lila says supper's up
' , , ' , spoons out stew from a vast pot
The table crammed with customers -- her three sisters, the three men, the herd of dogs and filthy children
Nobody speaks
Each time Lila bends over to spoon out of the pot, her cleavage strains against the flimsy fabric of her dress
Veasey's mesmerized
Inman is also getting drunk, his eyes increasingly glazed
When Lila makes to sit down next to Junior, he slides a hand up her dress, exposing a naked buttock, which he strokes and pinches as he pulls away
Hey
Junior grins, looks over at Inman, then nudges Veasey
He's gone now
Look
His eyes have gone
(vaguely, drunk) What
Dolly
'me
Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae
That's a poem
That's a poem
He begins to recite, has a verse in his mind
Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae (but he can' t summon it) Da-da da-da da-da dae
(vague) there's a poem there
'm leaving soon as 'm full
Really
Goodbye
Got a bunch of traps needs visiting
'll be back tomorrow, before dark
You'll still be here
That's my fervent prayer
My house is your house
(suddenly) Like to wash their hands and pray
Say again
Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae
That's Job
Don't say much but even liquored up there's a preacher in him
Inman gets up suddenly, sways
'll say my goodbyes, got miles and miles to go before sunset
(head spinning) 'll just quickly lie down
And he stumbles over to the fire where he instantly curls up
'm heading for that smokehouse and 'm ready to be washed clean of my dirt
He gets up, wanders out of the door
Junior's eyes glint
He jerks his head towards the girls then in the direction of the smokehouse
You go tend to him
(to Lila) 'll be seeing you
He picks up his gun and leaves Dolly gathering up the children and herding them out
Come on you -- get
Shyla stays, Mae having gone off after Veasey
Lila waits until the children have gone
They consider Inman supine by the fire
He's mine
You can go rub yourself off on the Preacher
(of Inman) Gonna make him hug me till  grunt
Lila shepherds Shyla out, shuts the door, swigs from the jug, walks over to Inman, then turns to the big table and pushes pots and plates way down to one end to make a playing field
Then she bends over the prostrate Inman
Hey
Inman stirs, glazed
(kneeling down to him) You want to see what Mamma's got for you
Inman is drunk, doesn't think he's awake
She takes her breast to his mouth, and Inman suckles
Then she puts his hands under the dress which rides up as his hands move between her legs
She's naked
That's good
Ain't that sweet
,  , , You just get on and ride me all the way to China
He doesn't move, except to sway, eyes glazed
She turns
You shy
You need a hand
(goes to his buttons) Let's have a look see what we can muster
She's kneeling now, her dress hunched up around her middle, working the front of Inman's pants
He's in a swoon, surrendering to her, getting aroused, his hand cupping her head
,      ' '
As Lila turns, Junior   violently in the head, knocking her over
You little bitch
Look at you
Cover yourself up
' Inman falls back
Junior goes to the door and whistles
, ' Lila enters the smokehouse, hand to her bruised head
' ,    , He considers Lila, beams: had a special prayer you'd come visit
,
' Veasey led out, a   waiting -- a bedraggled collection of prisoners, slaves, deserters -- and now
Veasey is joined to the line
It starts to rain
Ruby and Ada at the door of the Swanger house
They both wear Monroe's clothes by now, like two little men
' ,
Ruby hammers at the door, a little impatient
Sally Swanger opens it, has to decode who it is under the clothes, the hats
Ada Monroe and Ruby Thewes
Look at you both
Look at us both what
Like a coupla scarecrows after a thunderstorm
We need a scarecrow, birds eating up half our winter garden
Sally's right
We should both stop toiling and stand a while with our arms stretch out
'll volunteer
We got something for you
For all your kindness
Coffee
And a pie
That's real coffee
It ain't hickory and dirt
(taking the gifts) Thank you both
(of the pie) Ruby,  look forward to this
We all do
Esco and me
(grinning at Ada) She made it
made it
Good God in Heaven
(by way of recommendation) 'm still alive
Sally's strangely awkward, lingering at the door, staring at the gifts
We'll be getting along
(nodding) know Esco's going to be real sorry he missed you
You all take care
They all kiss, then the girls walk back down the path
Ruby is vexed
That strike you as odd
What
Stood at her front door
Sally
Number one --  know that woman all my life
never stood outside her house -- she'd invite a wolf inside if it knocked on the door
Perhaps,  don't know, perhaps she was busy
Number two -- Old Man Swanger was inside that house:  could smell his pipe burning
Number three -- look at these fields
What about them
She contemplated the stubble fields they're passing
We came by here a week ago, they were waist high in hay
The Home Guard ride, bent under their oilskins, as the rain tips down
Between the horses, unprotected and drenched, their prisoners trudge along the muddy path
Inman and Veasey among them
Veasey has grown some beard
, lies where he falls, not moving
There's a domino effect and so Inman falls on top of him
He picks himself up, then tries to pull up the older man
He doesn't move
He's dead
The horses plough on
Inman shouts to , the leader
This man's dead
Nobody pays any attention
He has to drag the body
'
More days have gone by and taken their toll on the prisoners, Veasey and Inman are haggard and filthy and reduced
The Home Guards stop for food, a wash, a break, chain the prisoners to a horse rail
Citizens go by, Veasey knows them all
Some of them spit contemptuously at the Deserters
None of them recognise Veasey
Am  so altered that they don't see me
Somebody walks by with a young child
Veasey looks at Inman
christened that child
The child stops, looks without recognizing, is tugged away from the chain gang by his mother
One of the other prisoners, , leans in to Inman, his voice low
'm looking to get out of this
They drag us back to fight -- we're just target practice for the Federal boys
You run, we're all running with you, the lame and the stupid, of which we number both
Either way we're fucked
Run or don't run
Just give me some warning so  can tell the guard -- 'm not getting shot again for some cause  don't believe in
,
One of the women is pregnant
Veasey studies the group, sees the pregnant woman, recognizes her
(mesmerized) That's Rebecca
That's Rebecca
(he hisses) Rebecca
In daylight it's apparent that Rebecca is a real beauty
She turns at the sound of her name, stops, is confused
She sees Veasey and approaches, appalled at his condition
Mas
Is it well with you
(Rebecca nods) 've been repenting for what  did
've walked the road of atonement
Your curls is all gone
Hey
(holding his head, to Rebecca) God Bless you
Rebecca, reluctant, rejoins the other slaves, walks away with them, but then turns back to look at Veasey
She clearly cares about him
And seeing her has somehow broken his heart
He turns away from Inman, towards Sheffield
'm with you
got a baby coming
, horses on either side of them, steep banks forming a  for the railroad Brown rides up to the prisoners, herds them off the track
The train approaches quite slowly -- the boxcars full of wounded soldiers
Some of the Home Guard dismount, take out pipes
The prisoners wait, one of them sits down
Sheffield says something to Veasey, who casually yanks up the sitting prisoner
Inman suddenly understands what's going to happen
The train is almost on them
No
But it's too late ,      , their reluctance tempered by the possibility of being crushed by the oncoming train
, stumbling and chaotic, the chains yanking tight, then loose, the tight causing a collapse, the loose a recovery
They run alongside the train, blocking themselves from the fire of the Guard, Sheffield screaming tactics -- and then, as the train starts to pull past them, they run up the bank, now all as a unit scrambling to the steep summit
Then they have sight of the escaping prisoners silhouetted at the top of the bank like a line of paper dolls stretched out along the ridge
Sheffield's yelling with adrenaline, Veasey joins in, elated
One of the guards raises a rifle, steadies himself on his horse,
He catches Veasey, who crumples, spinning round and falling down the bank, until Inman uses all his strength and practically lifts him in the air
The chain recovers and works back up the bank
But then    catches another prisoner and this time the effect is catastrophic -- The Home Guard approach, firing randomly at the bodies as they tumble into the ditch by the side of the track
Until all movement ceases
Inman has a wound to his head which bleeds profusely, almost completely covering his face
Brown arrives, considers the carnage
Get these sacks of shit under the ground
, Ada's milking
It's barely daylight
She's slowly becoming a country girl
Ruby appears in the doorway
Someone's been in the corncrib
You sure
It's a coon or possum
Scratched out a fist hole in the side
This place
'm telling you -- we grow, others eat
'll go into town, take the last of the cider and trade for a trap
' , Ada is in Monroe's bedroom, looks out as Ruby goes off to town, jugs of cider swung either side of the horse
Ada goes over to Monroe's closet, pulls out some clothes
, Ada buttons Monroe's dress coat and completes the she's spent the day making, save for the hat, which she now fixes on, pushing in a hat pin to secure it
She's made a stern black thing and steps back to consider it
Horsemen come riding along the lane
It's Teague and his men
He doesn't stop but raises his hat to Ada
, Ada looks out at the Winter Garden
From that distance it really does look like her father out in the field, arms outstretched as if waiting for her to run to him
She finds it unbearable, her tears coming, runs out into the fields, attacks the scarecrow, pulling off the hat, the clothes
misty drizzle
snuffles around in the freshly turned dirt:  hand, pale and wet, protrudes from the thin layer of earth covering the bodies of the murdered Chain Gang
, breaking the surface
Inman wedged under three or four corpses -- their limbs and chains wrapped around him, has regained consciousness
He coughs, can't breathe properly, tries to work himself some air, spitting out dirt
He makes a noise to distract the goat, rattling the chains
Inman rears up, the bodies slithering off him, but even then the animal only retreats a yard or two
, Inman feels a surprising loss and tenderness
He heaves again, groaning with the pain of new and old wounds
, Ruby rides back from town along the river
An ugly looking trap tied over the horses and three or four bulging sacks
By an abandoned mill she sees the Home Guard under the trees
She slows up
What you looking to catch
What
With that trap
We got some critter stealing our corn
Still but the two of you up there, is it
You know it
When we get a cold night, camped out, trying to keep the rule of law, protecting girls like you from Federals and deserters, that's a thought warms us (to his men) ain't it
-- the two of you up there on my Grand-daddy's farm, dressed in men's clothes
Warms us right up
What you got in the sacks
(to the men) Looks like human heads
Eh
Looks like a bunch of heads
We got competition
Ruby rides on
She rides around the bend -- she's not far from the Swanger farm
Goats, their bells tinkling, munch around the tracks
One of them turns at a noise -- a   --  , It's Inman, inching along the embankment, the chain of dead bodies in tow, a macabre tug of war
He considers the goats, they consider him
He rears up and finds himself
Sally is pinning out white sheets, they're filling out like sails in the afternoon wind
Ruby rides up
Sally seems a little vexed to see her
She walks down to the gate
Ruby
'm not stopping, Sally
'm not snooping neither
Just you should know Teague and his boys are lurking down by Pigeon River, the old mill
(after a beat) You tell Ada that was a good pie
Ruby rides off
Sally watches, then goes inside the house, her energy changing immediately, as if she might faint
' secret place, in the heart of a forest
There's the answering sound of  , a chorus of them
Inman is dragged into view on a makeshift litter
Goats appear, they herd around the figure dragging the litter
'   , silver haired, her face a leather map, her clothes leather, everything about her like old leather
She and Inman round a bend and there's Maddy's house -- , long grown into the ground and plaited with vines and creepers
Inman tries to sit up
An old whiskered butts up against Inman, knocks him down
Maddy pays no attention to the struggle, heads inside her caravan
Mind that Billy, he's the jealous kind
She emerges, with a bowl of water, rags, washes his face, pushing back his hair to look at his wound, puts a finger to the gash on his neck professional in her appraisal
Inman is barely conscious, he groans, trying to defend himself
Pay no attention to me
What happened to your head
Fighting
And your neck
Different fighting
You're the color of a cadaver
'll fix you
can fix you up
(speaking of his spirit) Mister -- you could fix me 'd be in your everlasting debt
Debts, fighting -- them words don't mean much round here
For the record, 'm a female of the species
, Ruby rides up to the farm
She rides past the winter garden, admires   --    , the same outfit she once wore to visit Inman, the same dress, same hat
Ruby grins as Ada comes over from the field
The hat's a nice touch
Ruby gets off the horse, and they start unloading sacks
You're quiet
cried for my Daddy
dressed up the scarecrow in his suit and he came back, his arms out, said you never cried enough, you never cried enough
Well now you did
Then  thought, it's not my Daddy, it's my sweetheart
saw him once that way, when  looked down Sally's well
So  dressed the scarecrow in the dress  wore the day he left
In case his spirit flies over looking out for me
(of the vicious looking trap) That looks terrible
Ruby opens the sacks
Cabbages
bargained like Lucifer
We can make all kinds of good eating
Such as
Cabbage
Slaw, sauerkraut, cabbage soup, fried cabbage, stuffed cabbage
'
Esco's out in the field, labouring away, but with his shotgun by him
Teague stops alongside the field, the rail between him and Esco
Esco stops working, picks up his shotgun and goes over
Teague has four men with him
and , the twins, huge, and with the appearance of having less than one brain between the two of them, , a reluctant-looking man, funereal in his bearing, and
Afternoon
The riders slowly fan out, almost as if choreographed
Don't spread out
Why they spreading out
'm not spreading out
'm sitting here
Esco comes over the rail fence, his gun loose in his hands
Never knew a man worked in his field with a shotgun
There's a war on
Got to watch out for the Bogey Man
He starts to fish out a tobacco pouch
Esco's gun swings up
Teague shows him the leather pouch, shrugs, starts to make a cigarette
From inside the house, Sally watches everything
Her view impaired by the sheets
Mo dismounts
Ambles past Esco, looks behind the sheets
, the shotgun rigid and pointing
Get off my land
Mo examines his breeches for a dust mark, wipes it off, retreating in a turkey walk of examining and dusting
Your boys come back
Ain't seen my boys in four years
They're fighting other boys, not old men and women
(to his men) He means us
He's referring there to us
(to Esco) So you won't care if we take a look around
What  gotta give you
chicken lamb
(shrugs) Sure
Right then
Thing is -- you got one barrel and there's five of us
Not a fair fight
,
Bogey Man
Bogey Man
Esco is momentarily distracted and, in that instant, Mo kicks out at him, knocking the gun from his hands, which fires into the air, a shocking sound
Ruby and Ada digging a trench by the smokehouse, laying in the pale heads of cabbage
They hear the distant shot
What's that
They stop
Listen
Look at each other, start running
Jo sets on Esco, knocking him-backwards into a sheet, where it gets twisted, while Jo kicks and punches, little spots of blood staining the sheet with each blow ,     , , stain grows out from the blade, huge and spreading
Teague walks to Esco
You're harbouring deserters
can confiscate every animal on this farm, every plate, every sheet, every little pellet of chicken shit --  can confiscate your old lady's asshole, so don't offer me a bird
Sally runs out, screaming
She tries to pull out the sabre
(sharply) Hey
Mo backs away
Sally is screaming
She watches, helpless, as Esco dies in front of her, the sheet growing a darker red
You got your bait
Set it on the hook
, ,      , '
, emerge from their hiding places, unable to bear the sound of their mother's screams
They're carrying an axe, a pitchfork, mad for revenge
He's very graceful, his hair flying, his hands out, one finger nail extremely long, his boots stamping down on the fence
, '
She can't scream any longer, because the noose has practically strangled her
The rope's tied off to Bosie's horse, which yanks on the noose with every slight movement
Sally is prostrate in the dirt
Her two boys come running from the barn
, , , '
Ada and Ruby, riding together on the horse, arrive at the Swangers
The noose around her neck has been tied off to the post so that she can't move
There's a bloody sheet draped over the edge of the well
Blood on the ground
Ruby heaves at the fence
can't get this damn thing off her
(at the well, looking down) Dear Lord in heaven
Ada,  can't get this off her
Ada runs over
They struggle, can't lift it
Sally's lips are moving
What darling
What
She bends down, listens to her
Looks up at Ada
She's saying don't bother
Wait
She grabs a thick log off the stack, staggers back and in a second they've inserted it into the fence and levered it up and away from Sally's hands
They fall back onto the dirt
Ruby cradles Sally
Ada nods towards the well
There's someone down there
think it's Esco
Ruby looks over at the well, then at Ada
This world won't stand long
God won't let it stand this way long
' An exotic interior, many crocks and jars, bunches of herbs, wrapped papers of dried things, like a woodland apothecary store
Inman wakes up
He finds himself in a small cot, wrapped in blankets, a poultice at his neck
He doesn't know where he is or how long he's been there
' Maddy's sitting on a stool
There's a circle of stones where her fire lives and she sets the tinder to it
Inman emerges from the caravan
He's pale and unsteady
How long have  been sleeping
Not long enough
can't stop here
'm a deserter
They find me here things could be bad for you
What they going to do
Cut short my young life
Sit down before you fall down
She calls over a little goat
It ambles over affectionately and nuzzles into her hand
She strokes it and scratches under the chin
The creature gets increasingly tranquil
How long you been up here
What year are we
'63
Last time  checked it was '64
'd say twenty six years
Twenty six years
could move on anytime
've seen most of the world anyway, Richmond in the North, south almost to Charleston
You're going somewhere or you are somewhere, what's the difference
She's still stroking the goat
It looks as if it's asleep
've learned a person can survive off pretty much of a goat
can't abide a chicken, but a goat gives you company and milk and cheese and then, when you need it, good meat
In a single motion she has a knife in her hand and has , putting the bowl underneath its neck to catch the blood, still stroking the goat, which blinks as if it were only surprised and not dying
So you've been fighting
(as if he might break) could be at killing for days sometimes, in the hand to hand, my feet against the feet of my enemy and  always killed him and he never killed me
He gave it a try, to look at you
guess he did
See  think there's a plan
There's a design
For each and every one of us
During this she's shucked the skin off the goat with the authority of someone who's done this a thousand times
You look at nature, a bird flies somewhere, picks up a seed, shits the seed out, a plant grows
Bird's got a job, seed's got a job
And the goat is now thin and pink, eyes bulging, a piece of meat
' woodburning stove with a single cooking plate -- on which pieces of the goat meat, sprinkled with herbs, are sizzling in a pan
, Maddy watches him, adds another mound of meat to his plate
Inman nods in thanks, but -- doesn't look up
She opens a jar and takes out a handful of dried poppy heads, puts them near the stove, then dips into another jar and pulls out what look like old cheroot stubs
Take one of these now with your food
Inman is circumspect, views the stub lozenge with suspicion
Swallow it
If you die 'll give you your money back
Inman puts it in his mouth, gags at the taste of it
She hands him a beaker with milk to wash it down
Our minds aren't made to hold on to the particulars of pain, the way we do bliss
She starts steaming the poppies
It's true
What is
What you remember
What's her name
Ada
(At the food) -- Sometimes  think 'm crazy when 'm just hungry -- (another mouthful) Ada Monroe
And is she waiting for you
She was
don't know
Or if she'd know me
'm like the boy who goes out in winter for firewood comes back in the spring with a whistle
Maddy pricks open the poppies and collects their opium, then hands Inman the liquid
Now drink this
It visits the pain
And you'll sleep
He drinks the laudanum she's made
've had to put myself in the way of people's kindness
hope you found it
She dips a cloth in the steaming water, unbuttons his shirt
She has a crock of what looks like treacle and vaseline
She smears this salve over the neck wound and into his scalp
Inman surrenders to the drug
The passenger pigeons fly south, the berries ripen
Whether  see them or not, whether a man dies, or a war is won
That's the laudanum getting to you
That's good
Say something more
(she kneels to his leg) Raise that up for me
He obliges
She grimaces at the state of it, where the chain has chewed into the flesh
Gets to work
She gave me a book
Ada Monroe
Man by the name of Bartram
Wrote about his travels
carried that book through every battle
left it someplace, got to get it back
Sometimes just reading the name of a place near home -- Sorell Cove, Fire Scale Ridge -- was enough to bring me to tears
Thing is 've been thinking -- those places belonged to people before us, to the Indian -- and he had a different name
What did he call Sorell Cove
How can a name not even the real name break your heart
It's her, she's the place 'm heading
And  hardly know her
So how can a person who's maybe not even a real person --  don't know what 'm talking about --  have to close my eyes
He slides off the stool and lays on the floor
Maddy goes over to her cot and pulls off a blanket which she drapes over him
, Ada in the henhouse, collecting eggs, is confident now among the birds
She emerges to find Ruby walking out of the backdoor with the shotgun and a determined look
It's a man
What is
Raiding our corn
Got him in the trap
That's him yelping
You're not going to shoot him
don't want him to shoot me
(of the gun) Can you fire this thing
(making it clear she can't) Yes
They head towards the corn crib, bundled up against the cold
, perfectly caught in the art of stealing, his head forced away from view
Ruby hands Ada the gun and approaches, warily
Listen up -- you got a barrel trained on your rear-end
Get me out of this dang thing
My fist's about to drop off
You got a weapon
No ma'am
'm begging you
'm already on my knees, otherwise 'd get down on them
(suddenly recognises the voice) Unbelievable
Stobrod Thewes
Ruby
God damn
What
(to Ada, disgusted) That's my daddy
She walks up to him and , strip of fabric, homemade bandage, being wrapped around Stobrod's badly gashed hand
Ada is tending to him
Ruby is cooking at the range, not remotely warm towards her prodigal father, who looks rather comfortable
Stobrod looks at her
Just so's you know --  can eat while she's doing this -- in case you're holding off
Just so's you know -- you're not eating inside
Number One -- they hang people round here for taking in deserters
Number two -- even if they gave out prizes -- you'd still eat outside
You're scarred
'm what
Your heart
Scarred
did wrong to you
You'd be scarred
You'd be really scarred if  hadn't wrapped them trap teeth in sacking
Which was her idea
hurt you
Good God
wrote fifty tunes with you in mind
Ruby this, Ruby that, Ruby with the eyes that sparkle
Hey
Let's agree: you beat me, you abandoned me, you ignored me, you beat me some more -- all of that is better than Ruby with the eyes that sparkle
'm changed
People change
War changes people something terrible
(to Ada) Ruby's told you -- 've no doubt -- wasn't always the best
You were an asshole
can't disagree with that
was
Get him out of here
Music's changed me
'm full of music, darling
wish 'd brung my fiddle Hey Ruby
Got a new fiddle -- it's got a little snake's rattle in the body -- took it off a dead federal in Virginia
That's a beautiful fiddle
It's full of tunes, Ruby
Don't know if it's from that little rattle locked up in it, or from something untied my heart
Ruby walks over with a crock, wrapped in a cloth
You're all set
(sincerely) Bless you both
He goes to the door
Ain't you got a proper coat
Darling, 'm fine
And you just say the word,  won't come back neither
don't want to put either you or your mistress here in any bother
'm not Ruby's employer
Oh, okay, who is
Nobody
(Stobrod digests this) 'll make up food for you, you come Sundays before it's light, 'll leave it behind the Old Frazier Mill
Do you know who really needs a coat, darling, is my partner, fat boy name of Pangle
We're hiding up in the caves and he feels the cold like a thin man, but ain't no coat'll fit him
(leaving) love you, Ruby
In case the sky falls on our head
You're a good girl
And he's gone
Ruby scowls
He is so full of manure, that man, we could lay him on the dirt and grow another one just like him
So that's Stobrod Thewes
It is and that's the last you'll see of him
' ,
Maddy is loading up Inman for his journey
She hands him a bulging goatskin satchel
That's medicine and goatmeat
You're sick of both
have a deal to thank you for
She hands him an ancient flintlock pistol
And that's just for show, or -- if you can get close enough -- a wild turkey
She turns, abruptly, mingles in with her goats
Inman nods, knows that she doesn't want a fuss, although he wants to make one, and turns himself, heads away from the caravan
calls
And again
is hunting
He creeps through this clearing, eyes peeled for the turkey, gun at the ready
His dog growls, and he puts a hand over its mouth
He listens
Another call
Junior moves, without sound, in its direction, stops for several seconds under a tree, listening
He looks up ' Inman drags Junior's corpse in to the yard
The dogs whine and slobber over the body
Inman goes straight into the Smoke House
' Inman reaches behind the stove and retrieves his bag
He checks for the LeMats, for the Bartram, opens it, locating the tintype of Ada, which he considers, as the dogs howl outside, joined with another wailing
' Inman emerges with his bag, LeMats at the ready
The women are all keening over the corpse, as it a saint had passed away
Dogs, women all howling
chicken bobs in, investigates the glob of blood on Junior's skull
Inman walks away, doesn't look at the women, who don't look at him
' , Ruby wakes up
Looks out of the window
Ada, also woken, comes into Ruby's room ,
Ruby opens the window, scowling
Stobrod beams, stops playing, holds up the food, points at Pangle in his new coat
Pangle waves
Get on back where you came from
Stobrod and Pangle smile and hurry away
Inman, increasingly a stick figure in the landscape, wasted and fragile, trudges along through fallen leaves
He still limps from the leg irons
No shelter anywhere
He unwraps a paper containing some scraps of goat meat and corn bread
He walks and eats, fishes out a lozenge, tries to swallow it, washes it down with a drink from his flask
Opens the crock of salve and rubs the treacly grease into his neck and ankle
The path splits
He doesn't know which way to go,   repeatedly caws off to the left and, taking it as a sign, Inman goes in that direction
(
) My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath ' , Ada in the bed, reading to Ruby from Wuthering Heights
-- a source of little visible delight, But necessary
She ain't gonna marry Linton, is she
She said -- whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same
You can't say that and then marry Linton
We'll find out
Okay
Tomorrow
'm not waiting until tomorrow
Ruby, 'm falling asleep
She lies back in her bed
Ruby takes the book, lies across the bottom of the bed, as Ada goes to sleep
Little visible delight, but necessary
like that
Inman shelters under a huge tree, whose split trunk provides a mean shelter
He inserts himself into the cleft of it, a black thing in a black tree, like a troll
He stands, shivers, sodden, desolate
' Its lights coming through square windows like a chinese lantern
Inman considers it, the risk versus the shelter
The sleet still pelts down on him and he decides to approach
Closer he can hear a sound coming from the house
' ' , Inman knocks hard on the door
The light from the lamp goes out, although the fire still gives the room a clear glow
'm one man alone
'm a Confederate soldier on furlough
have no bad intention
need shelter and food
Can  at least sleep in the corn crib -- just for some shelter
'll be on my way come morning
No answer
Inman accepts this as a rebuttal, and trudges back towards the road
(
) 've got a rifle
Inman turns
gap in the door appears, the figure barely seen
Fair enough
The baby's crying behind her
There's some beans and corn pone, all  got
You better come in
' Inman enters the cabin
It's a single room
big fire
The baby on the bed, a rudimentary crib unoccupied next to it
The woman is already at the little stove
She turns to him
She's painfully beautiful
But sad and fragile
Inman, despite himself, is mesmerized
Thank you
'm alone here, as you can see, with my baby
need to believe you mean no harm
Inman takes out his gun
She starts, terrified
No,  mean to give it to you
He turns it handle forwards and offers it to her
don't want it
had my way they'd take metal altogether out of this world
Every blade, every gun
Is your baby sick
He cries
don't know
He cries a lot
My man is dead
He took his wound at Fredericksburg
Never saw his boy
She never once looks at him
Her eyes on the floor or the food or the baby
'm sorry
It's pretty much what you'll get if you knock on any door of this war
Man dead, woman left
She hands him a plate of steaming beans
An onion perched on top
It's mean food but it's hot
She goes over to the bed and picks up her baby and starts the same business of walking him, singing the while, an odd lament
Inman eats, looks at her, at the child and the fire
He picks up the onion, bites into it
Sara looks across
(ashamed of his hunger) There's no hunting on the road, just cress and -- He takes another bite
Sara picks up the baby
need to feed this man, if you could look away
Inman, embarrassed, turns his back to her
He sits finishing the food while she puts the baby to her breast, slipping the shoulder from her dress
While the baby feeds
Used to have a cow, few goats
Raiders took them
Made me kill our own dog on the porch
That poor creature watched over me
Nothing left now save a hog and couple of chickens to live off till spring
'll have to kill that hog and make sense of the flesh and divisions which is something never did
could do that for you in the morning
'm not asking
It's what 'd gladly do for you for what you're gladly doing for me
'm Inman by the way
That's my name
'm Sara
My baby's Ethan
Glad to know you both
' Sara walks ahead of Inman
She carries a pile of clothing, a pair of boots
It's still wretched outside, she hugs the house, the porch barely offering shelter
, with a bowl of steaming water and a small towel over his arm
She hands him the clothes
You look about his size
He was another man straight up and down
There's a palpable attraction between them, so that every exchange seems to contain a promise, a sexual charge
don't even have a blanket
got a blanket
'll leave you the lamp
By the dim light, Inman peels off his clothes, sets to work with the bar of soap and the cloth to scrub himself clean
He can be seen from the window and finds himself turning away to pull off his pants
' Sara sits at the cot, still singing to the baby, then gets up, goes to the window, sees Inman dressing, walks to the door, lets it open a little, but not so as she can be seen
They fit
(
) Pretty much
These boots are good boots
'll say good night
(
) Good night
' Inman settles down into the corncrib
He's cold and everything is damp and lumpy and uncomfortable
He pulls his thin blanket around him
The wind is howling
He levers himself up, looks at the house with its warm invitation, can almost feel Sara in there
He reluctantly settles down again
, Will you come inside
She stands in a shift, a blanket over her shoulders
Her body under the cotton very clear to him
She turns and goes back inside
' Inman comes in
Sara is sitting on her bed
Long silence
Could you do something for me
Do you think you could lie here, next to me, and not need to go further
don't know
'll try
He sits on the bed as she slips under the covers, and then removes the boots, his shirt, gets under the covers
There's an electric space between them
Then Sara begins to cry, pulls his arm to open up so that she can be folded into him
,
'll go
'll go, shall
don't want you to
They lie, staring up at the ceiling, her tears falling , Stobrod is playing the fiddle, his bowing hand still lightly taped and a fingerless mitten covering it
They're in the abandoned Mill, a derelict space, which has been cheered up with some rudimentary Christmas decorations
Ada, Ruby and Sally Swanger, her hair now almost completely white
Some token presents
Pangle is picking at a banjo, his grin infectious, and a third player, , with a harmonica
As they play: (of Sally) She don't speak
She can't speak
told you
(smiles at Sally) Is she feeble then
No
(to Sally) Don't mind him
(to Ruby) Hey Ruby: what about this
He starts the tune of Wayfaring Stranger
Ruby groans
Don't make that face -- you listen: c'mon Georgia
And he starts up again, but this time
He's like a pale angel and sings with a soft, true voice
Ruby finds herself taken by this boy's voice and by Stobrod's extraordinary invention as he takes the tune off on a wild journey
Ruby sits next to Ada, fiddles with her bracelets, slips one from Ada's wrist and slides it over her own
, They're all outside now, shaking hands
There's snow in the air
Don't sleep here
We won't
It's bitter, they could stop one night
They stop one night, they'll want to stop two
This coat's warm
What about next Sunday
That'll be the New Year
It's gonna be a better one
Maybe
The war's over in a month
He said that a month ago
(shaking Stobrod's hand in goodnight) It started off being over in a month
Miss Ada
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Pangle
Georgia
'Night
'Night now
The three women walk down the lane, the three men watch
That's my Ruby
She's an original
You think the Good Lord would forgive an old cold fool if he changed his mind
Ada said it herself it was bitter
The three women head towards Sally's house
What kind of name's Georgia
It's where he comes from, it's not his name
know that's meant to be the ugliest state under the heavens
Why do you care what his name is
(a funny look, then) What's that cluster of Stars
Orion
What about them shaped like a wishbone
That's Taurus the bull, and that's Gemini and that's Orion's big dog, Canis Major
Listen to her, Sal
She's turned into a highland girl
could always name the stars, Ruby, that was never my problem
They all three have linked arms
Ada imitates Stobrod
love you darling
In case that big old sky falls on our heads
And love you, too
Sal
It's sad, Sal
It's a c-a-t-a-s-t-r- o-p-h-e
' , Ada at the window as, outside,
, Stobrod opens the door of the Mill
The   dissuade him from venturing further
He goes back inside
(
) No sense setting off in snow
,      , ' Sara, dressed, agitated -- the baby already complaining -- is urgently shaking Inman
Hissing at him: Get out of here, quick
Inman surfaces from deep sleep
Federals are coming
They find you here it'll go bad on all of us
Inman is up, grabbing clothes, boots, his gun
can try and fight them
No, my baby
Please no
Just get
She pulls up the window in back of the cabin
Inman throws things out into the freezing morning
He has his pants on, but is otherwise naked
He swings over the window and down onto the frosty ground
' Inman picks up his stuff and, at a crouch, runs for cover to the wood which borders the property
He can hear horses and a commotion at the front of Sara's cabin, but doesn't look round until he's sheltered by the trees
, a raiding party, have dismounted and are already wrangling with Sara
Inman watches, pulling on his shirt, shivering, then his boots
Sara is standing in front of the hogpen, as if to protect the animal, but one of the soldiers, , barges her to one side, toppling her, and opens the gate, starts herding the hog out into the yard
second soldier, , emerges from the cabin, carrying Ethan
Sara starts up, struggles with him, is again knocked down
Then Sara starts to scream
Inman is dressed
Boots on
He looks back at the yard
The men sitting, smoking, prepared to wait, their breath coming out in gusts in the freezing air
Flakes of snow fall
We got all day
My baby's sick
Cover him up
He's shaking
Have some pity
third Federal, , chases after the chickens, gathers them up
got nothing
swear
Nym gets close to her, putting his rifle to her chest
That ain't necessarily so
Yes
Take me inside
Let's all go inside
Take my baby inside and then we'll do whatever you want
Nym unties her
Pistol has a rope around the hog and now leads it towards the horses
(screaming) There's nothing
You take that hog 'm as good as dead
Cover up my boy
She's wailing, an unbearable ululation
, , ' The door is kicked open
Nym pushes Sara inside, kicks the door shut,
' Bardolph, a chicken in his arms, goes over to the baby
This is ready to get a fit going
It's shuddering
It's gone blue
(to Nym) How long does he want
Hey
Leave some for the rest of us
Pistol heads towards the cabin
As he approaches the door, Bardolph rearranges the blankets to, cover the baby
Pistol opens the door
Nym is on top of Sara
Pistol laughs, enters, and is clubbed down by Inman, who steps out onto the porch, while       ,
Bardolph looks up to see Inman walking towards him
Bardolph has left his weapon by the fence
Move away from the baby
Bardolph obeys, terrified
Sara runs out, collects Ethan, gives a little moan of anguish, runs back inside the cabin
Don't shoot
Take off your boots
(Bardolph does so) Take off your pants, and your shirt
Don't shoot me, please
We're starving
We haven't eaten
You'd better get running before you catch your death of cold
(nods, terrified) Thanks, thank you
will
,
Behind Inman, Sara stands with a rifle
' '    , , There's a sense of ritual and order: the chapters of transforming the hog into food
Sara is inside the cabin, the door open onto the yard
She holds the baby by the fireplace, swaddled up tight
She tries to put him to her breast, but he won't feed
She puts Ethan back in his crib, comes outside
Now Inman is butchering the hog, chopping down either side of the spine to make two sides of meat
Now Sara is holding up a sheet of hog fat, as if it were a lace shawl
Now she's rendering the fat into lard
Now Inman's salting the two hams
Now Sara's washing the intestine
She sings all the while --  dreamed that my bower was full of red swine and my bride bed full of blood -- they don't really converse
Inman continues to work
Sara goes back inside to Ethan's crib
Inman glances back, but can hardly bear to, her anxiety so palpable She looks at it
She takes it up in her arms
Kisses its forehead
Makes a strange stifling noise
Inman doesn't look at her
She comes out again, shovels some of the food into a plate, serves it up to Inman, gently touching him as she does so
Then serves out food for herself
Inman starts to eat
Good
Inman nods
She collects up the knapsacks, including Inman's, and goes back inside the house with them
Inman squats, eating, glancing back towards the cabin
There's the sudden shocking report of a revolver
Inman, knowing what it is, goes slowly towards the house and its two dead bodies
His own face is a rictus, the eyes thin slits
If he gave into his grief it would never cease
' From the house, the silhouette of Inman working outside in the day's dying light, snow falling around him
He's digging a grave
Inside the house,  , the small body wrapped in a blanket, the other wrapped in the bed's patchwork quilt
, Still snowing
Ruby trudges past Ada who is digging out a couple of heads of the buried cabbages
Do you think he's dead
Who
(shrugs) This snow
Isn't it supposed to fall with bad news
Bad news is girls get working
'm going to round up the animals
(squints up at the snow) This'll settle
She walks past
Ada stares into the distance where -- the snow falls down on Inman
He's hardly visible in its gusting waves
Just a thin black question mark, hunched over the elements, moving slowly forwards
, It's left a carpet on the ground
Stobrod, Pangle and Georgia emerge from the Old Mill as they set off up the hill towards the mountain
Inman comes sliding down a crumbling slate hill and onto the path
He cornea to a place where the path suddenly drops away to reveal a view of the geography
And there, finally, in the distance, Inman can see the blue ridge
Somewhere in there is home, is Ada
He goes on
Pangle walks too close to Stobrod and steps on the back of his boot which promptly detaches itself from Stobrod's foot
Stobrod turns -- and with a raised finger -- pushes Pangle
,  ,
around the Stobrod party's footprints
Bosie swings acrobatically over his horse, to hang over the tracks, then up again into his saddle, looks at Teague
The Home Guard plod slowly forward in the direction of the tracks
, , fringed by poplars
Stobrod is making a fire
Pangle appears with an armful of firewood, his big grin a fixture
Then Georgia appears
He's carrying   , frozen and covered with snow
What d'you reckon
Think we could eat this
You cook something long enough you can eat anything
(prodding it) It's frozen
How long it been there for
You hungry
Yeah
Not very long
Teague examines the snow's imprinted silhouette of Pangle
, , Georgia joins in the chorus
Stobrod pulls one of the hickory stick skewers out of the fire, blows on the, meat, smells, smells again, looks at Georgia, takes a bite
Chews
Edible
Pangle takes another stick, burns his fingers
Ow
(takes a bite from his skewer) Don't taste much like venison
It's good
think it's good
The three men are asleep
The fire still burning
They're lying like petals of a flower around it
Suddenly Georgia sits bolt upright, grimaces, gets up stumbles away from the fire, toward a stand of trees, from which come the vivid sounds of violent nausea
, , his head in the snow, when he       approaching the sleeping Stobrod and Pangle
Georgia has to vomit again
, Teague rides up to the fire, the other riders with him -- Mo, Jo, Bosie, Grayling
Stobrod wakes, sits up, Pangle sleeps
Evening
Hope we didn't disturb you
You're all right
Name's Teague
Do  know you
Thewes
Teague slides off his horse, approaches the fire
You a deserter
-- don't mind if just warm up at your fire
(of the sleeping Pangle) That your wife
Who
That's a he
He your wife
We're musicians
He picks the banjo, got a fiddle
(to his men) Look pretty romantic by the fire
Don't they
(to Stobrod) Your boyfriend's got a nice bit of flesh on him
Close your eyes slip inside that shirt get two good handfuls -- dark enough 'd be willing
'm just kidding
(to his men) Tell him, 'm just kidding
He's just kidding
, Georgia squints through the trees
Doesn't know what to do
, Did you answer my question -- about your military status
Discharged
Took a wound at Petersburg
Oh, so like a hero's discharge
guess
And your boyfriend
The military wouldn't take him
He can't fight
He's simple
He's got a mind no bigger'n a pickled walnut
'm sorry -- he's fat, he's simple and got titties -- but you're insisting he ain't a woman
God damn
Don't that sausage smell outstanding
(he's very nervous) Miqhty outstanding
Mighty outstanding
There's a new phrase
Mighty outstanding
Listen, don't tell me -- you left your papers somewhere
Which papers
Your hero's discharge
For mighty outstanding valour
They're, they're, they're at my house
(enjoying himself) And where, where, where is your house
Down the mountain
But you're up the mountain
Hunting
Drinking
On honeymoon
(to his men) 'm pretty fucking funny tonight
Is he going to play
(to Stobrod) You gonna play that fiddle
Sure
Sure
(kicks Pangle) Hey, wake up
Pangle surfaces, blinks, grins at everybody
Evening, Mrs
(looking around) Where's Georgia
(interested) Where's Georgia
In the trees, Georgia ducks, retches
He don't know what he's saying
We were talking about Georgia early on -- maybe heading down there
Georgia's like my armpit
Worse, it's like yours
(to Pangle) Want some sausage
Thanks
You is Home Guard
Yes, ma'am
You is Teague
(to the others) 'm known
He don't know what he's saying
(quoting) That bastard Teague
Really
Bad words
Folk always put the curse words in front of your name
Mr
Teague wants us to play
Okay
We heard there were deserters in these parts
Hiding out in a big cave
Not come to my ears
You don't know where this cave is
No, sir
You do, Stobes
He means -- Right, right
he means, there is a cave, right, it's up over the other side, big cave, we played some music up there, never occurred to me they were deserters
Near Bearpen Branch
Ain't nowhere near Bearpen Branch
It's this side
He's always getting lost
That cave -- we live there
-- it's over on Big Stomp
Tell you how always find it
There's a big old locust tree fell down across the path, that points straight at it, like a finger, always a dozen squirrels round that tree
You gets to the tree, sit on it, and there's your entrance, straight in front of you, tree points at it
Come right to your hand, them squirrels -- (makes a chirping sound) -- Chrrrpppp
Chrrrrppp
Sounds good
Okay, let's eat, let's hear some music
, Georgia watches as the music starts, Stobrod playing and singing, Pangle joining in at the chorus
Their improvising is wild, profound, Stobrod chording the fiddle, Pangle following him, then, finishing with another verse and ending with the title declaimed by Stobrod
call this tune: Ruby's Lament
, Something like compassion has flickered over Teague's face
Mo and Jo nod to the music's secret rhythms
Only Bosie seems detached, contemplating his long fingernail
The music finishes
The Home Guard applaud
What'd you make of that
Heartbreaking
Stand over by that tree
Me
Over by that tree
Over there
Take your boyfriend
Stobrod gets up, carrying his fiddle, heads over to a big old poplar
Nods at Pangle
Come on
Pangle gets up, banjo in his hand
Puts his arm around Stobrod as if they were about to be photographed
The Home Guard gather around them
From the trees Georgia watches, helpless
Pangle grins at Teague
Don't smile
What
Quit smiling
He always smiles
He don't mean nothing by it
told him this world's got nothing worth a smile
Put your hat over your face
What do you mean
Cover your face with your hat
, , ' ,
, Georgia lies prostrate in the snow, shuddering under the report of each bullet
, Ruby working in the snow, in the field, clipping a sheep's feet, the animal on its back between Ruby's knees
She looks up to see       , calling out her name
From the kitchen window, Ada looks on as he reaches Ruby, the story pouring from him
Ada emerges from the house, walks towards the bad news
, Ruby sorting out a kit of shovels, blankets
Ada comes in doesn't know how to help her friend, who shows no emotion
told Georgia he can stop here, sleep in the barn
He's got nothing inside him
He'd walk out of here and die in the snow
He can milk the cows
was worrying about that
It'll be dark in a couple of hours
's ten hours climb from here
He's drawn a map
Okay
(boiling) You know these fools stayed the night in the Mill
That's Stobrod -- he can't do one good thing without adding the bad
Left tracks in the snow all the way up for them Home Guards to follow
That's a sign says shoot me
Ruby, 'm so sorry
Ada moves towards her, puts her arms around her
Ruby is rigid
Ada stops embracing her
We should get going
She's tying up the kit
She doesn't know how to grieve
Every piece of this is a man's bullshit
They call this a war a cloud over the land, but they made the weather
Then they stand in the rain and say: shit
It's raining
(tears welling) If  cry one tear for my Daddy stole it off a crocodile
, dressed in Monroe's clothes, hats pulled down, leading the horse, which is loaded up with tools and supplies
choice of paths
They start up one, then Ruby decides against it, consults the map, and they reverse, pulling the horse back and then yanking it up the other path
, Ruby and Ada have made a fire
They sleep under a stone structure, which forms a natural pi shape, the fire in the entrance, the snow caught in its light
, Ada and Ruby arrive at the scene of murder
Pangle is keeled over at the old Poplar, snow covering him
Only his girth and a glimpse of coat identify him
Ada brushes some of the snow from his face, revealing the death wound, then lays a hand in blessing on his head
don't understand
Maybe Teague's took him
They did that with the Swanger boys -- didn't, they
-- dragged them into town, then strung them up as warning
it's snowed since, so  can't read the story on the ground
Ada fishes out Pangle's banjo from the snow
It's broken and the strings hang slack
Let's dig
-- and     , hammering in a stone to mark the place
Ada walks away towards the creek, to wash her hands
She bends and rinses her face
As she looks up ; half-in, half out of the water, slumped against a tree, blood everywhere, staining the crust of snow which covers him
Ruby
Ruby
Ruby arrives at Ada, looks to where she's looking, walks straight into the creek, all her love contained in the urgency with which she hurtles to her father, oblivious to the freezing water
She puts a head to his chest, seeks out a pulse at his wrist
Calls back to Ada
He's still breathing
(to Stobrod) God damn
Daddy; Daddy -- it's Ruby
Don't you die on me again
(to Ada) He's still breathing
, mean fire burns by the creek Stobrod's back is exposed
Just by the shoulder blade is an ugly grey and purple bulge the size of a crabapple
Ruby turns to Ada, who is helping
Pack a pan full of snow
need good clean water, boiled up
She cuts the skin and prises out a slug which she drops in the snow and rolls around to clean
Stobrod doesn't move
He could be dead
Ada loads the pan with snow
Let's get him home
We have herbs there and it's warm
He'll die first
He's got hardly no blood left in him
He'll die lying here
There's a place further on up
Used to be
Old Cherokee place
There's good water right by it
Ada puts the snow-packed pan on the fire
' , Squirrels frolic
Teague sits on the trunk of a fallen tree
He feeds the squirrels, looking straight ahead where the mouth of a cave winks back at him
There's a stream and, up on the bank, , made up of chestnut logs, abandoned and slightly sinister looking
They approach one of the huts, its door long lost
The snow has drifted in second hut has a door which they pry open
It's dark and cold, but apparently still weatherproof
They get Stobrod off the horse and carry him inside, then come out again to unload the horse of its remaining load
This horse is weary
He's ready to give up the ghost
Ruby picks up the blankets and provisions and goes back inside to her father
Ada takes the horse to another hut and, despite his great reluctance, pushes him inside
Good boy
(she blows into his nostrils, calming him) That's warmer, isn't it
Ada wouldn't even recognize this practical, hardy woman she's become
Stringy and of few words
She sets off towards the tree tunnel, passing Stobrod's hut
'm getting firewood
, Inman approaches the Killing Ground
He studies the ground, finds Pangle's grave
Blood has left its black writing in the snow and he finds first where Stobrod has been, where the bullet had been removed, then the journey away, still tiny, telltale spatters of blood, and the hoof prints and boot prints of two walkers and one loaded horse
He puts his hand into the ashes of Ruby's fire, can't feel any warmth
It's getting dark
He takes a drink from the stream, shudders at the cold
' , The fire burns, a pall of smoke
Stobrod lies on the ground, swathed in blankets
Coughs
Ruby sits next to him, wipes the hair from his forehead
Ada opens her eyes, looks, closes them, listens to the fire, a strange squeaking as it burns
That wood -- that sound when it burns that mean more snow
Yes, it do, country girl
, First light
The sun creeps up, a red streak of dawn
Inman walking, his head bent to the tracks
He walks quickly, even as the terrain gets more steep
As he bends to the snow -- where a spot of blood has fallen into a hoof print -- Then a second
He looks up
The snow falls
He starts to move more quickly, racing the snow as it seeks to erase the tracks
The snow thickens
In the Chestnut Grovel     pick their way across the snow
shotgun lines up its sight at one of them
The trigger is squeezed
An explosion of feathers
, Inman hears the shot
Then a second, the sound ricocheting around him
He can't quite identify its source but he runs again, heading for the Chestnut trees he can see above him
Ada collects the two turkeys, the first creatures she's ever shot
Doesn't quite know how to hold them
She straightens up and sees, at the other end of the tree tunnel, backlit by the morning sun,
She drops the turkeys tires to reload the shotgun
Inman comes down the tunnel, approaching the hunter he sees through the snow at the other end of it
Turn round and go back where you came from
Inman is bewildered by this woman's voice in a man's outfit, keeps walking, peering through the snow
Ada fires a warning shot
Inman, still some distance, suddenly understands
Ada
Ada Monroe
do not know you
After all this time, all this way, Inman could give up the ghost
Then  believe  made a mistake
He turns, walks heavily away from her
Then he turns again, completely lost, without compass
If  knew where to go 'd go there
(finally recognising him) Inman
He nods
They don't know how to speak to each other, just stand awkwardly, some distance apart, the emotion stones in their throats
Eventually -- You'd better come with me
And with that, she starts to sob, and sob
: Inman walks towards Ada
They embrace
' , Ada enters, Inman behind her
Ruby looks up from Stobrod
Ruby, this is Inman
Ruby digests this
Considers this ghost of a man
Congratulations,  should send you out with a shotgun more often
He looks as he needs sleep
may need to
Be my guest
You shot or something
Not lately
Hungry
(Inman nods, Ruby to Ada) He woke up
Stobrod
Said -- your mommy's name was Grace then closed his eyes again
Ada comes out of Stobrod's hut, a glimpse of Inman sleeping on the floor, heads for another hut which Ruby is sweeping out
The snow has stopped
Ada stands in the door, watches Ruby
Ruby's resistance to Inman is palpable
He's asleep
They both are
'm not surprised
Your man looks played out
saw him
realize now
Saw him when
In Sally Swanger's well
tunnel of trees
The man like a black smudge in the snow, the sun behind him
Well there you are
Funny thing is it wasn't the same
The image
It wasn't snowing
And in the well, he was, as if he were falling
You probably don't remember it right
remember it exactly
There were crows, these black crows flying towards me
thought  was seeing him fall
Instead  was seeing him come back to me
All this while 've been packing ice around my heart
How will  make it melt
Better get a fire going
(goes to the fireplace) 've got big plans for that farm
Got a vision in my mind of how that Cove needs to be
know you have
There's not a thing we can't do ourselves
, Ada lies awake
Ruby sleeping
Ada gets up, steps out into the snow, her blanket around her
, Inman is outside his cabin
Only the light escaping from the cabin, fire lights them, almost silhouettes
'm sorry
was trying to be quiet
couldn't sleep
--  got no appetite left to be in a room with wounded men
can't see your face
It's not a face you recognised
Did you get my letters
got three letters
Carried them in that book you gave me
The Bertram
must have sent 100
Did you write to me
Whenever  could
If you never got them  can summarize
No, it's -- pray you're well
pray 'm in your thoughts
You are all that keeps me from sliding into some dark place
But how did  keep you
We barely knew each other
few moments
thousand moments
They're like a bag of tiny diamonds glittering in a black heart
Don't matter if they're real or things  made up
The shape of your neck
The way you felt under my hands when  pulled you to me
Your boots, one polished, one not yet polished
You're playing a piano and 'm standing outside
'm playing a piano and you're standing outside
That kiss -- which 've kissed again every day of my walking
Every day of my waiting
Maybe you can't see my face, but if you could see my inside, my whatever you want to name it, my spirit, that's the fear  have deeper than any gash on my neck
think 'm ruined
They kept trying to put me in the ground, but  wasn't ready, no ma'am, no more ready than that scoundrel in there's not ready to die on us
But if  had goodness,  lost it
If had anything tender in me  shot it dead
Ruby stomps out of the hut
Number one -- shut this door, it's freezing
(goes over to Stobrod's hut) Number two -- shut that door, it's freezing
(turns to them) 'm laying on my back, with my fingers poked in my ears trying to shut out who's got a bag of diamonds and who's got boots needs polishing, If you want to get three feet up a bull's ass listen to what sweethearts whisper to each other
She's at the door to Stobrod's hut
She contemplates them
In fact, if you're going to wimble all night 'm going to sleep in with him
And with that she enters Stobrod's hut, slamming the door
Now  can't see anything
long pause
'll say goodnight
don't think Ruby's vacating my hut so that you can sleep in a different one
, Ada puts logs onto the fire
After a few moments a knock
Come in
Inman enters
They don't know the rules for this
Whatever comes to pass between you and me,  want Ruby to stay in Black Cove
Right
As long as she wants
And if she never leaves 'll be glad
More a question could she put up with me
And you understand she's my friend, she's not a hired hand and she doesn't empty a night jar unless it's her own
Sure
This war's made some things pointless
It's hard to imagine a wedding think even my father would recognize that
Ada,  want to marry you
If you'll have me
Isn't there's some religion where you just have to say  marry you, three times, and then you're man and wife
marry you
marry you
marry you
Ada laughs, unsettling Inman
Why's that funny
No,  think it's  divorce you three times and then you're not married anymore
can wait for you
You waited enough
certainly did
marry you
marry you
marry you
And they kiss, tentative, then more urgent
'm sorry about the way  look
In these clothes
(Inman shakes his head) And there are so many buttons
(starts to undress) Will you turn your back
Not for all the gold dollars in the Federal Bank
She stands holding her clothes in front of her to cover herself
He takes them from her, drops them to the floor
crisp, cold beautiful morning
They're packing up, all their clothes in layers
Inman prepares the horse
Ruby and Ada carrying bundles out of the huts
Inman approaches Ruby
You go ahead
'll follow with the horse at a pace your daddy can tolerate
We can all go together
It's safer this way
No one has quarrel with you
He's right
(to Ruby) gather  need permission if  reckon on living at Black Cove
Ruby gives a curt nod, goes over to Stobrod's hut
Inman gets close to Ada
We'll get to you by nightfall
You be safe
She puts her hand to his mouth which creases into a smile
Your Mr
Bartram speaks about some category of fly born on the hide of a cow
It flies up into a tree and waits and waits until it smells cow
It can wait a year, two years, don't know, maybe longer
Then a cow comes along and it wakes up, flies down, lays its eggs on the cow
There's purpose for you
And am  the fly in this story, or the cow
' , Ruby is wrapping a fragile Stobrod for the journey
You come up the mountain for me, darling, 'd be dead otherwise, dead and gone
You'd have found some other fool to rescue you
He's sweet on you, that Georgia boy
He coughs for a long time
If you say a thing and then cough it's a lie
Daddy, stay on that horse, and don't lose him or sell him
We'll need him on the farm
And then the two women are off, little men in their outfits, tramping off in the snow
Inman watches
, Ruby and Ada walk
hope that Georgia boy's been seeing to the animals
thought you were thinking on him
was not
was thinking on swollen udders -- and before you say same difference
'm saying nothing
Ruby elbows her
Miss lovey-dovey
Ada elbows her back
, Inman has roped Stobrod to the horse which he pulls down a steep slope
Behind him, their hooves muffled by the snow, ,
Inman walks on, apparently oblivious to who's behind him
He and Stobrod are some distance from broken ground, a fringe of trees
(quietly to Stobrod) Don't look round
Got it
How many men does he have
There were five
You can't reason with that man
(takes off his gloves) got a conversation stopper
(they're getting closer) Closer we get to that broken ground the better
Inman opens his coat
Stobrod looks at the Lemats
They're at the edge of the trees
You hold on tight, do you hear
When say three, look round, nice and slow
Okay
One, two, three
Stobrod looks round
Inman doesn't
Teague has some new bodies in his entourage but they're all dead , ,
Teague waves
God damn
You're a hard fucker to put down
(they approach) Good directions to that cave from the fat boy -- saw the squirrels, sat on the tree made some friends, brought some back with me
His riders begin, quite casually, to fan out
, ,    , , ,   , ,
The riderless horse gets tangled up with the others
Inman is in the trees, shots around him
He doesn't move away from, but towards the riders inside the line of trees
Grayling charges him, riding into the trees ,     , ,  , ,     , ,
Teague's carbine fires an involuntary shot into the air
Inman yanks the gun from his hand with his own left hand and lets go the shotgun barrel of the Lemats with the other, the big pistol almost leaping from his hand with the recoil
' '
Mo is still screaming
Inman walks over and shoots him in the head, then walks to Teague, who is saying something, the blood blotting the snow under him
Inman studies him, picks up the Spencer carbine, turns to look where Bosie has gone, steps up onto Teague's horse, reins the horse in, and trots it over to the prostrate Teague, He turns the horse in the direction Bosie had headed
He can't see horse or rider, but in the stand of Hickory Trees ahead, betray them both
He rides slowly towards the stand of trees
Ada and Ruby walking
They hear the shots
Ada turns and starts to run through the snow, her hat flying from her head
, Inman's horse is parallel to Bosie, who is deep inside the trees but also riding, slowly
It's like a dance
Come out of there
No, sir
Here's fine
just have to shoot the horse from under you
Shoot her
She's not mine
You riding Mr Teague's mare
am
He dead
hope so
(wearily, as he brings his horse inside the trees) Look, how old are you
Give me your gun and ride home, 'm done fighting
'm sick of it
give you my gun you'll shoot me dead
will not shoot you, but nor am walking down that mountain looking over my shoulder for you
That's what they call a conundrum tell you what 've got on my side
What have you got on your side
The confidence of youth
And in that second ,    ,
, ,    ,     , , Ada and Ruby running
,   , Stobrod, barely conscious, hanging halfway down its flank, held on by the ropes
Ada hurries on, taking the shotgun from Ruby, who tends to her father
, Ada runs past the horse dragging the cave corpses
She hardly stops to look at the bodies, just rushes on
' , , , , , She runs, her heart broken, towards the body of Inman
He's dead, the red flag of his life ebbed, away in the snow
Ada falls to her knees and pulls him over, the snow crusted on his face, which she wipes away with great tenderness, then sits, his head in her lap, as Ruby slowly comes up the hill towards them
, quite raucous
,   , , about five or six, with Ada's curls, sits at the table cradling a tiny lamb, which won't feed from the nippled bottle she offers it
She tries again
Ada comes in suddenly, takes a knife from the kitchen, and hurries out
You bring that lamb outside
The girl gets up, carries the lamb out into the field
, ,    , It's a glorious spring morning, Black Cove Farm at its most luxuriant, the path edged with brilliant flowers
There are more animals in evidence
The girl emerges from the house and sees Ada in the field, surrounded by sheep
She hurries over
The little girl is horrified
What are you doing
He came out dead, love
She has the skin off the lamb, which lies like a little pink cat on the ground
She approaches Grace, takes the live lamb from her arms, the girl resistant, frightened
Don't kill him
'm not going to kill him
But we have to try something or else he's going to die
She takes the skin and wraps it round Grace's lamb
Then puts the covered lamb into the pen with the dead lamb's mother
It goes to the sheep and, after a few false starts, starts to feed, accepted as a surrogate
Isn't that a small mercy
And   joins in with the fiddle and banjo
is playing, on his repaired fiddle
His hair is now completely grey
is playing the banjo and singing, although
with Georgia's reddish coloring keeps invading his picking hand trying to join in , but is also trying to serve food
She passes Georgia and touches the top of his head is pouring water from a jug, Ada emerges from the kitchen, with a big pie, racing to the table
(laughing) Hot hot hot hot hot
From behind her, Grace appears, carrying a jug of milk, puts it on the groaning board of the table
Grace has a full plate in front of her, picks up a fork to spear some meat
Grace Inman, nobody said eat
(then to Stobrod) Mr
Thewes
The music stops
And there's quiet except for the sound of animals: lowing, barking, braying, bleating
For good friends, good food, good family: for all our blessings -- Oh Lord we thank thee
Amen
Amen
And they eat
