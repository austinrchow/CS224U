Written by Joe Penhall Based on   by Cormac McCarthy - The intense  of summer insects and the  of songbirds
birds eye view of a bucolic mid west farming landscape, corn field, blue skies, sunshine, a a nearby field with a , grain silos and a hay stack
with a horse
clapboard house with a strawberry field, a woman's hand picks strawberries; a lying in grass, lazing
/ - Next to book shelves and an upright piano, with sheet music on the stand -
There is also a dining room table with leftovers from an abandoned meal - strawberries and cream
- - a warm night, the  is asleep with the same , now pregnant, no sheets on the bed
The  is restless and wakes
distant , indistinct - the swings his feet off of the bed and goes to the window, anxious
- The  is in his shorts, sweating, putting a plug in the bath and turning on the taps as far as they will go
The appears in the doorway in a nightdress and leans against the door frame watching, blearily, cradling her pregnant belly
Why are you taking a bath
'm not
The  takes off her nightdress and goes to the bath
You'll sleep better
He looks at her, surprised she's misunderstood
'm not
Put your clothes back on
She sees he's looking out the window now - there's an eery rose-colored glow of distant fire through the glass - and distant shouts and screams

: What is it
What's happening
: :
- of about forty and a  of ten are asleep, camped on a tarp under a rock ledge, the blackened chasm of a burnt valley spread out below
It is the same man seen earlier - but ten years older, thinner, malnourished, with a thick beard
They are both emaciated and exhausted, their faces and hands coated in grime and soot from the burned, blackened landscape around them
Ash falls on the tarp, which is bright synthetic blue, the only color in sight
The  is woken by something, he instinctively reaches out to touch the , his hand rests on his chest and rises and falls with each of the sleeping 's breaths
There is a low , the ground starts to  and the wakes
Papa

Shh
It's okay
What is it, Papa
They listen as it grows  and , everything , tree roots  and , until it passes between them with a  like a subway train right beneath them
The  is now clinging to the  and crying, his head buried against his chest in fear
Shh
It's all right
It's all right
It's gone
What was it, Papa
It was an earthquake

- In the burnt, barren landscape, through swirls of soft ash and smoggy air the  appears dressed in a filthy old with the hood up, a knapsack on his back, pushing a rusted shopping  with a bicycle mirror clamped to the handle and the  tarp now covering it's load
The little , similarly dressed with a  on his back, shuffles through the ash at his side - like Depression-era Dust Bowl homeless

/  - ( 2) - They are camped high up on the ridge of a mountainside
There is a camp fire with wet clothes hanging to dry on sticks beside it
The  is erecting the tarp over string tied between two sticks stuck in the ground
The  is sitting lighting a lantern using the scavenged oil inside the makeshift tent, his shadow stark against the illuminated tarp
Now you can read me a story
He gets out a  and looks at the pictures in the lamplight
The  reads him a story
/ - ( 2) - The  awakens bathed in firey light as if the sun has come out
There is pale gray snow all around him with a quivering orange glow
He gets up to investigate, looks to the line of trees up the ridge where a   is burning, in the distance
He stands staring at the fire, the warmth and light moving him, enlivening him and not frightening him at all
The  has got up and appears at his side, yawning
He looks at the sky at a single gray  drifting down
It's snowing
() 6
: It's like it used to be when the sun came out
The  catches the snowflake in his hand, surprised
/ - They travel along the road through drifting wood smoke, smoke pouring off the ground like mist and thin black trees burning like candles on the snowy ridge
They reach a spot where fire has crossed the road melting the tarmac
Their feet stick in the molten tarmac, it sucks at their shoes and they stop
Just ahead they see a set of foot prints in the tar and study them
Who is it
don't know
The  looks through a pair of  and sees: stooped figure up ahead, a   dragging one leg slightly, limping along
He stops and stands uncertainly, then continues
The  sees him too
What should we do Papa
We're all right
Let's just follow and watch
Take a look
Yeah
Take a look
/ - The   is getting slower and slower as they climb a slope, following, until he finally stops and simply sits in the road
The  hangs onto the 's coat anxiously as they approach
- the   is burnt, his clothing scorched and skin black with soot
One eye is burnt shut and his hair is a nitty wig of ash
His shoes are bound with wire and coated with road tar
() 7
: As they pass by the   looks down, averting his eyes
The  keeps looking, unable to take his eyes off him
Papa, what's wrong with that man
He's been struck by lightning
Can't we help him
Papa
No
We can't help him
They keep walking away and the  tugs at the 's coat
Papa
Stop it
Can't we help him, Papa
No
We can't
There's nothing to be done for him
- ( 3) - They are camped under the bridge, ash and slurry drift by on the river, a dull sulphur light from the fires glows against the sky
The  sits in silence with his back to the
There's nothing we could have done
(
) He's going to die
We can't share what we have or we'll die too
know
So when are you going to talk to me again
'm talking now
() 8
: Are you sure
Yes
- They come to a barn beside the road
They look at each other
Let's take a look
The man picks up the revolver and they go inside cautiously
- Three pairs of  wearing different shoes - a man's shoes, a woman's shoes, and a 's sneakers - hang above three carefully placed chairs
Don't look
The  looks at the ground
(') You don't need to see this
The  takes a few steps, exploring, he eyes the empty hay loft but avoids looking at the hanged bodies
There could be something here
There could be corn or something
No, they ran out of food
Maybe we could find some hayseeds in the hayloft
Now the  goes over to the swinging , oddly curious
It's not what-you think
They committed suicide
What does that mean
() 9
: You know what that means
The   outside while the  thinks about it a moment
- They walk away from the eerily silent farm, stopping at an abandoned  by a weathered, paint stripped letter box
Come here
The  goes over and the  takes out his revolver, opens the magazine and shows him: two bullets in the chamber
(') You see that
Two left
One for you and one for me
He places the 's thumb on the hammer and cocks the pistol
He curls the 's index finger around the trigger
(') You put it in your mouth and point it up
Like this
Just like showed you
He puts the barrel of the pistol in his own mouth until the nods, wide eyed
He takes the pistol out of his mouth and uncocks it
(') You got it
think
Is it okay
Okay
The  puts the gun away and cuddles the  close
They set off again
10
- - the  is sitting by the window, staring out at the garden which is barren now, the sky gray but tinged with the same fireglow seen earlier, a film of gray ash covers dead lawn and shrubs and inside the paintwork is grimy and colorless now, a lot of the furniture gone
pile of broken up furniture and pieces of the piano are-stacked up next to the fireplace
In the fireplace the scorched, ashen remains of piano keys
The  is now heavily pregnant
The sets down chipped old plates and spoons, spoons beans from a pot and sits to eat
As the  starts to eat she winces and freezes with a look of horror, spoon halfway to her mouth
She looks down and : - water and blood running down her legs
Oh no
Oh no
It's okay, 'll help you
Just like we said
No no no
'll heat water
We can do it
As he goes out she  in despair
/  - The  rushes in and opens a drawer in the sideboard
Instead of cutlery it contains a pair of kitchen shears, a bottle of antiseptic, worn but clean towels and a pair of worn out yellow rubber dish gloves, all laid out in readiness
The  appears at the door, blood running down a leg
We don't have to
Well,  think we probably do
What kind of life is this
() 11
: It's life
It's the only thing left
He takes the  back into the other room
/   - The  lies on the dining room table as she has her first contractions
The  is wearing the rubber gloves, one gloved hand resting on the 's leg, about to deliver his own baby
He wipes his brow and leaves a smear of blood as the  goes on
can't
It's coming
- ( 4)- Inside a badly damaged trailer home, one wall half fallen off, a pan of water boils on a small fire
The  sits shivering in a blankets as he eats beans from a tin, scraping around for the last one or two
The  opens his knapsack by the fire and produces a packet of
He fixes a cup of cocoa for the boy
He hands the  the cup of cocoa and as the  examines it and drinks, the  surreptitiously pours himself a mug of water and sits blowing on it
The realises the  has left him all the cocoa
You promised not to do that
What
You know what, Papa
have to watch you all the time
know 'm sorry
If you break little promises you'll break big ones
That's what you said
() 12
: The  relents, pouring the hot water back into the pan and taking some of the 's cocoa into his own cup
The wipes his finger around the inside of the empty bean tin and licks his finger
Watch your finger
You always say that
That's because you always do it
The  spreads bits of a worn out road map on the boards and studies them
What are you doing
We have to keep moving
We have to go south to the coast
Why
It'll be better at the coast
Why
Because we're going to freeze here
He picks up the map pieces carefully
- The  and the  truck along the blacktop
At the crest of a hill they come to advertising  and stop
The  notices a sign in the distance, which has words painted over a faded advertisement: odd, nonsensical, Biblical ramblings about "bones" and "the dead
" The  follows the 's gaze and reads: " -  19:6
" Do you remember your alphabet
() 13
: Yes
Can you read that
(
) No
Good, let's go
The  takes out a large , cocks it in readiness and places it on the tarp as they move
The  eyes the nervously, eyes the gun and they move off
,   - They trudge along the turnpike towards the opening of a deep, black tunnel and the  suddenly comes to a stop, increasingly upset, unable to face the yawning mouth of the tunnel
can't,  just can't
There's no other way
We could go over
We can't take the cart over
We don't know what's in there
There's nothing in there
It's just the same as it is out here
Okay
(
) Okay
The boy sticks close to the 's side
The man has the revolver in his belt now and his parka unzipped, ready as they nervously walk towards the mouth of the tunnel
14
- The  has his arm around the boy as they push the cart cautiously ahead, acutely aware of all that's around them
They pass footprints in the dried sludge on the ground
Ash and litter blowing about and a handful of appear along the sides of the tunnel, sitting and lying on camp stretchers, their bags and supplies long since looted
They are shrivelled and drawn like latterday bogfolk, shoeless, a couple of men, a woman a small child and a
The  stares at the group
The  stares at the small child and then at the mummified , transfixed
The  puts out his hand for the  to take - the  takes his hand and the  moves him on
Just remember that the things you put into your head are forever
But you forget some things don't you
You forget what you want to remember and you remember what you want to forget
- ( 5) - The  and the  are asleep inside an abandoned car amongst a line of other abandoned vehicles littering the turnpike
- ( 5) - Now the 's hand rests on the 's chest as he sleeps
The breathes stertorously, wheezing a little and the ' small hand goes up and down on his chest
Suddenly the  wakes and rolls onto his side, listening, the revolver lying beside him
He slips his hand onto the revolver and raises his head slowly
He looks around - nothing but the sound of a distant
He looks at the  fast asleep
When he looks back at the tunnel he sees a nightmarish vision: () 15
: - Exiting the tunnel, shuffling through the ash, a group of  , some in gas masks and filthy biohazard suits, slouching along, coughing, casting their heads from side to side and swinging clubs and lengths of pipe - a The  listens to the sound of a   behind the gang
Quickly
Quick
The  jolts awake as the  shoves his pistol in his belt, grabs the boy by the hand
They slide out of the car and crouch on the ground, the  is frozen with fear
(') It's all right
It's all right but we have to run
Don't look back
Come on
Their backpacks are still left in the back of the car
(') Run
run
The flat bed truck  into view,  from the standing on the flat bed looking around, some holding rifles
The  falls and the  pulls him to his feet with such force he lifts him clean off the ground and has to dangle him back down again
(') You okay
It's all right
come on
They rush down the embankment into the trees alongside the turnpike
- They run through the woods
The truck is heard in the background, the motor missing and , coils of black diesel smoke coiling through the woods
The motor dies with a flapping  and there's
The  and the  crouch in frozen silence, the Truck now on the overpass nearby, dangerously exposed to the view of the Gang
They listen to the   and raising the hood of the truck The  puts his arm around the  and draws his pistol as they see the truck begin to roll, the  pushing it
but it coughs and stalls again
() 16
: The  sees one of the   coming down the embankment, unbuckling his belt
He is emaciated, in dirty blue overalls and a gas company cap, and has a long beard cut square at the bottom and a bad tattoo of a bird on his neck
He doesn't stop, just keeps coming, closer and closer until he's just feet away, almost on top of them
He unzips his pants and takes a piss
As he stands pissing his eyes roam around - at any moment he could look to the side and see them crouching there
The  is wide-eyed, gun ready, eyes darting from the to the  to the
The   rolls his shoulders and exercises his neck
he looks down and studies the steam coming off his piss
The  silently trains his pistol at the head of the who, as if by instinct, rolls his head around and looks right at him
Just keep it coming
The   sees the gun and stops pissing, looks back at the truck, zips his fly
(') Don't look at them
Look at me
If you call out you're dead
Where you from
Does it matter
Where you from
What's the truck running on
Diesel fuel
Where d'you get that
don't know
You don't know, huh
The   just stares, not answering
() 17
: (2) (') You got ammunition for those rifles
The   looks back towards the truck
(') told you not to look back there
Where d'you get all that stuff
Found it
What are you eating
Whatever we can find
Whatever you can find, huh
Yeah
Now the   looks at the , causing the  To raise the revolver and cock it
- he looks down the barrel at the magazine and sees empty space
(') You won't shoot that thing
You ain't got but two shells
Maybe just one
And they'll hear the shot
On the over pass the   are looking around, as they notice one of their number missing
Maybe
But you won't
It'll be through your skull and inside your brain before you can hear it
The  steps closer and aims the gun at the 's forehead, hammer back, ready
() 18
: (3) (') To hear it you'll need a frontal lobe and things with names like colliculus and temporal gyrus and you won't have them anymore because they'll just be soup
Are you a doctor
'm not anything anymore
We got a hurt man
It'd be worth your while
The  glances in the direction of the  , then back at the  , who is still eyeing the
The  is sitting with his hands on top of his head, peeking out through his arms, terrified as the tension escalates
If you look at him again 'll shoot you in the head
'll bet that boy is hungry
Why don't you all just come onto the truck
Get something to eat
Ain't no need to be such a hard ass
You don't have anything to eat
Let's go
ain't going nowheres
You think  won't kill you but you're wrong
You know what  think
think you're chickenshit
You never killed a man in your life
He drops his belt on the ground with a , a canteen and army pouch hanging from it
The  eyes the army pouch, eyes the  on the road - and notices for the first time some of them are wearing the same army pouches
() 19
: (4) One is banging his stick on the side of the truck to call their lost member
The  is distracted by this and when he looks up the   has taken two silent steps and is standing between him and the , holding a knife
What do you think you're going to do with that
Without a word the   dives and grabs the , rolls and lands on his feet holding the  against his chest with his knife at his throat
Simultaneously the  drops to his knees, trains the pistol and fires from six feet away, shooting the   in the forehead
He falls back and lies with blood bubbling from the wound, eyes open, the lying in his lap in shock, deafened, expressionless, covered with gore and mute as a stone
The  hear the loud  and freeze, they start looking around them more urgently now
The  grabs the dazed  by the hand and yells but in his deafness the  hears only a soup of words: (
) Move
Let's go
The  shoves the pistol in his belt, hoists the  onto his shoulders and sets off down the road at a run
- They crash through the woods, the  straining to keep the aloft and find a path through the trees - the clutching the 's head with both hands
There's a sickening  and the  falls, the  flying off with a cry
The  struggles to gather his wits, unsure whether he's been felled by another man
(
) Come on
Get up, get up quickly
The  swings the  onto his shoulders and runs
/ - The  and  stagger through trees and the man drops to his knees, letting the  down
They are back by the turnpike again
They listen and watch, utterly exhausted and out of breath, the  is wheezing, the  at his side, holding his hand, staring, in shock still
() 20
: Shh
It's okay now
You're going to be
- the  can still  nothing, temporarily deaf
But he sees the  talking and looking around, through 360 degrees, trying to work out where it's safe to go
(') Come on
He grabs the 's hand and they take off again
- The  pulls out blankets from his knapsack
The  sits staring, shocked as the  tries to wipe the blood and gore from his face but it's thick and congealed now
His hands tremble as he tries to pick it from the 's hair
It's okay
it's okay now
Frightened by the 's muteness, he wraps him in a blanket, unzips his parka and holds him close under the parka
The  picks up his revolver, checks the chamber, only one bullet left
He eyes the flickering shadows in the distance and then eyes the , making minute calculations of distance, calibrating the space between the   and the He holds the revolver up and cocks it

) (') try to look like any common traveling killer but my heart is hammering
When it comes to the boy have only one question: Can you do it
When the time comes
There is no moon, but not far away, perhaps 30 yards, a firey makes its way through the woods
About 50 yards away from that another  is being used to search
shadows flicker ominously
The sounds of  snapping underfoot and being broken as the   searches wordlessly, just  heavily through their masks and beards
The clutches the  tighter, and stifles a cough
They remain frozen like this, unable to budge
21
- They are by a thin, toxic, rust-red stream, slushy ice at the edges and gray froth
The  leans down and pushes ice away and scoops up a hand full of gray water
He runs it through the boy's hair to wash it and the  flinches with cold
He rubs more icy water into the 's hair, roughly, quickly, with a sense of panic as he helplessly tries to-wash out lumps of flesh and blood
The  is weeping silently and shivering from the extreme cold as the  picks out the dried gore and washes the hair clean
It's no use crying
You have to talk to me
He takes the blanket and dries the 's hair as he talks
(') 'm not going to let anything happen to you
'm going to take care of you
'm always going to try and be here for you
and 'm going to kill anybody who touches you
He smooths the 's hair down with shaking fingers, clumsily trying to brush it out of his eyes, a fatherly instinct to make the  neat
(') Because that's my job
Do you understand
When he's through the  lifts the 's thin arms, puts a vest over his head, then a ragged sweater, then he folds the into his parka, zips it up to the neck and kisses him on the top of the head
The  grabs his knapsack, tips it upside down, rummages inside - it's empty
(') Come on, we need to get the cart back
- Approaching the embankment, the  walks quickly and stealthily, wired, listening to the silence, straining to hear, sure he's being watched
() 22
: The  stumbles along behind, slower, fatigued, makingthe anxious
The  leaves the boy hiding: (
) Wait here
He starts to climb the embankment and hears: little running as the  comes after him, he turns to face the urgently, exasperated
(
) (') No  need you to wait
'll hear you if you call
'll just be a little ways and 'll be able to hear you if you get scared and you call me and 'll come right away
He walks off but hears
the little 's  running after him again - he turns around
said wait
The 's face crinkles up and a tear rolls down
(') Stop it
need you to do what say
Take the gun
The  freezes, refusing to take the gun
(') Just take it will you
The  shakes his head
(') We don't have time for this
We need our food
What's left
The  shoves the gun into the 's hand
(') Don't argue
He creeps up the embankment
The  just stares at the revolver
- The  searches for the cart
He comes to where they'd left it in between the abandoned cars
() 23
: Their backpacks lie open on the ground, next to the cart on it's side, it's contents spilled out, mostly plundered, just a few children's  and , old pots and pans, shoes and ragged clothing remaining
Nearby are the remains of a large campfire in the middle of the turnpike
The man collects up the few remaining possessions and puts them into the backpacks
- he sees charred billets of wood, ash and
the bones of the shot
Nearby is a pool of his blood and guts, still gently , the head decapitated and rolled under a car
He nudges the bones with the toe of his shoe
- Below, down the embankment the  is waiting obediently with the gun
The  heads back to the , trying to think what to say
The  hands the gun back and takes the 's hand and they walk away into the woods, the  tucking the gun back into his belt
Let's get out of here
The freeway's too dangerous
Find the back roads
Okay
- - Now the house is in considerable disrepair, no furniture, the skirting boards falling away, large cracks in the walls, cornices and lamp fittings pulling away from the ceilings, water marks from rain, the windows covered with corrugated iron sheets
The  and the  are sitting across from each other with a lamp illuminating the dark
Between them lies the revolver seen earlier
The  picks up the gun and swings open the magazine
There are two bullets in it, she takes them out and places them on the table, one after the other
That's all that's left
should have done it when there were more bullets in the gun
The  shuts his eyes, unable to take it
In the corner, the is standing in the background, drawing on the walls
() 24
: (') Sooner or later - no listen - they will catch up with us and they will kill us
They will rape me - - And they will rape him Please no - just - no They are going to rape us and kill us and eat us and you won't face it
You'd rather wait for it to happen
Please
Stop it
'll do anything
Such as what
She picks up the revolver and puts the   into the chamber
(') thought about not even telling you
Just doing it
'd empty every godamn bullet into my brain and leave you with nothing
Don't say that
Don't talk this way
There's nothing left to talk about

: (2) Please don't do this
won't let anything happen
We'll survive

You know  would
Why can't you face it
Will you listen
You're talking - It's not crazy and you know it
It's the right thing to do
They glance at the

She goes to the , strokes his hair, kisses him, makes a reassuring display of being motherly
(') Time for bed, there's a good boy
She picks him up in her arms and carries him off to bed
/ - The  of a waterfall, the river disappears into space - the  and the  stand staring up at the waterfall, 80 feet above, shrouded in gray mist
color spectrum is visible rising from the waterfall, like a rainbow - the boy is transfixed, clutching the 's arm for safety
What is it
The  looks at the , surprised he's talking again
It's a waterfall
Look
Colors
() 26
: There used to be color everywhere
You don't remember
It was before you were born
There used to be so many thnings
The  approaches the water's edge, shallow and clear with gravel and pebbles sparkling at the bottom
He scoops up some water, surprised that it seems clean
Look
It's clear
Do you want to go in
don't know
Sure you do
Is it okay
Just don't swallow any
The  unzips his parka and slips it to the ground
The eyes the , surprised - then does the same
/ - Naked, pale, filthy dirty and shivering with cold, the frolics in the spray of the waterfall
The  watches him enjoying himself by the waterfall, clutching his shoulders, hopping up and down, he joins him
/ - ( 6) - The  has strung the tarp against a rockface to make a shelter
He meticulously filters water through a rag into a pan
In the background, the waterfall can be heard
The  has painted his face with , drawing a bizarre set of  and dripping blood around his mouth
The studies the 's painted face a moment
Listen
That man back there
there's not many good guys left, that's all
We have to watch out for the bad guys
() () 27
: (') And we have to talk
Always
We have to just
you know
keep carrying the fire
What fire
The fire inside you
The  is thoughtful a minute, and then: Are we still the good guys
Yes
We're still the good guys
And we always will be no matter what happens
He eyes the  uncertainly, unsure if he can promise this
Always will be
Yeah
The  goes back to tying the tarp
/ - The  and the  are trudging along, away from the waterfall now
We have to keep moving
Other people might be attracted to the waterfall just like we were
We wouldn't hear them coming
They stop to look at a lake surrounded by fog down in the Do you think there could be fish in the lake
No
There's nothing in the lake
They move on
28
- They come around a bend in the road and immediately hear the of river rapids
Up ahead they see a bridge with a jack- knifed  on it
- They walk out onto the bridge over   , and inspect the truck
The tyres are flat, the cab jammed against the railings
The trailer end has swung across the road, knocked out the railings and lies with it's last few feet hanging over the side of the bridge, blocking the bridge off completely
- The  climbs up onto the gas tanks, wipes the glass and peers into the cab
He swings the door open and climbs inside, pulling the door shut behind
/ - He looks around at discarded detritus, old magazines and trash
He checks behind the seats where there is a mattress on a bunk and calls out
Come up here
/ - ( 7) - continues to fall on the dusty
Outside, all around snow falls, silently, covering the truck and the bridge, transforming it
They are both still awake, unable to sleep, staring at the transformed world, carpeted by snow
'm hungry
know
So am
Can  ask you something
Of course
Are we going to die
() 29
: No
Sometime
Not now
And we're still going south
Yes
So we'll be warm
Yes
And there might be food there
Everything depends on reaching the coast
Okay
The  draws a blanket around him and kisses him goodnight, it is now pitch black
Go to sleep
wish  was with my mom
They are silent a moment, until: You mean you wish you were dead
Yeah
You mustn't say that
It's a bad thing to say
can't help it
() 30
: (2) know but you have to
You have to stop thinking about her
We both do
How do  do that
The  is silent, lost in thought
/ - ( 7) The man gets down from the cab and walks a few feet in the dark and snow
He coughs a bit, takes a few breaths of air, and walks away from the truck, vanishing into the mist
/ - ( 7) - The  is alone now by the road
He takes out his  and sifts through: money, ancient cards, driver's license and a picture of  and the  on their  , which he studies a moment sadly
(
0
) She was gone, and the coldness of it was her final gift
she died somewhere in the dark
there is no other tale to tell
He lays everything out on the grey slushy ground, then flings the wallet into the river and walks back to camp, leaving the and cards to blow away
/ - - The  kisses the
Will you tell him goodbye
No
won't
can't
Will you at least wait till morning
Stay with me through the night
No
have to go now
They kiss again, she turns and walks away out of the yard
() 31
: What am  going to tell him
What are we going to do without you
You should move south
You won't survive another winter here
The  follows a few steps and she stops and turns to him
Why won't you help me
can't help you
Don't you understand
This is how 'm helping you
Where are you going to go
You can't even see
don't need to see
'm begging you
Please don't
Please
The  stares
She goes, vanishing into the darkness
- The  stares
In the distance, a dead city
/  - The  and the  approach the edge of the city
Up ahead a cluster of three tall buildings, a dozen or so floors of concrete and glass, the upper floors of one illuminated by the flickering fire glow of candle light inside
The stops and stares and the  follows his gaze
In one of the illuminated windows a   stares back at them, somebody in the building
In another window another   is staring out, motionless, they could be refugees, cannibals or more mummified dead for all we know
() 32
: Who are they, Papa
don't know
What if it's more bad guys
It won't be more bad guys
Don't worry
Stay close
He takes hold of the gun and they walk in a different direction now, giving the high rises a wide berth
(') Keep low
We'll be okay
When they get to the end of the block they stop and the checks around the corner before they cross the street
In the distance three men appear, emaciated, slow-moving
They step forward, stop and watch the  and the
/ - The , now carrying the revolver, and the  head off down a railway track that leads away from the city
- In the country, along the railway, they see past a small road to a once grand house on a rise
It is tall and stately with white Doric columns across the front and a gravel drive that curves up from the road through a field of dead, foot long grass
They stand there staring at it, the  still holding the 's hand
The  listens - nothing but the  in the dead bracken, a  of a door or shutter rattling
think we should take a look
'm scared
There's nothing to be scared of
/ The  sets off up the drive
He stops and faces the  who is rooted to the spot
() 33
: You want to stay here
No
The  joins him and they set off slowly up the drive, through patches of melting snow
There is a tall dead privet fence with a deserted birdsnest in it
/  - They climb the steps to the porch, the  clutching the 's hand
They notice a window is slightly open
The goes to it, opens the window wide, looks inside
/  - They climb through the window onto black and white marble tiles and the  carefully shuts the window a little so it's the same as when he found it
They regard the room, binoculars set up on a tripod sit next to an arm chair
An elaborate staircase in front of them, William Morris wall paper, water stained and sagging, plaster moldings and cornices sagging from the ceiling
They cross back to the other side where there is a great hall of a drawing room, high ceilings, huge fire place with raw brick around it where the wood has been stripped, a pile of warm-weather clothing, boots and backpacks on the floor by the hearth
Papa
Shh
/  - They creep in and find blackened pots and pans, a cord with a bell for servants, trash piled on the floor and work tops, a rusted sink covered in mould, bare cupboards
In the floor is a hatch with a lock set in a steel plate
The man examines it while the  tugs at his arm, frightened
Papa, let's go
There's a reason this is locked
() 34
: The  is now panicky, hopping about, close to tears
Don't open it - don't
need something to pry it open
No
The  goes out abruptly and the  follows, wringing his hands in fear
/  - The  comes out the back door with his revolver drawn, looks around and sees an old station wagon with flat tyres on the dead grass
Beside it is a 40 gallon cauldron on the blackened remnants of a fire
There is also a wooden with thin wisps of smoke coming off it
The  studies it nervously, sniffing the air, then goes to the tool shed and starts sorting through tools
He finds a long handled spade and hefts it in his hands
/  - The spade chops into the wood around the lock on the hatch
The  hacks away, then prizes up the hatch, lock and all, revealing a gap of darkness
Papa
Listen to me
Just stop it
We're starving
Do you understand
have to do this
don't have any choice
The  opens the hatch fully and lies it on the floor
(') Just wait here
'm going with you
Okay
Just stay close to me
Nothing's going to happen
() 35
: They descend the rough wooden steps
/  - There is a terrible stench and they have to cover their mouths and noses with their parkas
The  gets out his lighter, lights it and tries to light the way
-  except the small area illuminated by the lighter as the  searches: part of a stone wall; then a clay floor; an old mattress with dark stains
The glow of the flame crawls across the floor to a corner as the  steps closer, then plays the lighter along from the corner to : Huddled against the wall, all trying to hide, shielding their shining eyes from the light,   and , thin as skeletons like inmates in a death camp
The  jumps, shocked and the  freezes, staring, dumb struck by: On a mattress on the floor lies a   with his legs gone to the hip, their stumps blackened and burned, cauterized
The  covers his eyes
Jesus
The  on the  turns to them and , a low indistinct murmur at first
Help us
please help us
Christ
oh Christ
The others join in, an eerie chorus of , "Help us
please help us
" The  turns and grabs the  and rushes for the steps
(') Hurry
go
move
The  drops the lighter as he tries to push the  up the steps
Out of nowhere a   appears at the foot of the stairs, blinking
Please
they're taking us to the smoke house
() 36
: The   reaches out and feebly tries to grab the 's arm but he breaks free and concentrates on getting the up the steps, following in a blind panic, fumbling and missing his footing
Hurry - hurry
They scramble up the steps towards the light of the hatch as the   reaches out and tries one last time to grab at the 's feet but he kicks free
/  - The  scrambles out, slams the door shut and drags a solid table over the door
He looks around for the
Christ
Run
The  is near the window, dancing up and down in terror, pointing out the window to: - Coming up the path toward the house are four   and two , all suspiciously well fed and healthy-looking
One of the  holds hands with one of the , as if they were returning from a stroll before dinner
/  - The  stares a moment, frozen with horror, then grabs the by the hand and jerks him away
Run
Run
/  - They tear through to the front door, the  fumbles to get it open but it has a well-maintained deadlock on it
He stares out the window next to the door and sees: - The -  are climbing the steps of the porch
The  Grabs the  and they rush through into kitchen
/  - In the kitchen the hatch is being lifted from underneath and the table elevating inches
They rush back out again
37
/  - As they reach the stairs, a key turns in the lock and the picks up the  in his arms and they sprint to a door under the stairs
As they get through the door the front door swings open and the -  drift inside
- They are in a small rest room under the stairs, just a toilet and a basin
The 's face is level with the basin and while the  is holding the door shut the  comes face to face with the contents of the basin: - bloodstained clothing soaking in bloody water and tallow in the basin
Around the basin are bloody red hand prints on the white porcelain
- through a thin crack he sees the -  on the far side of the foyer, chatting casually
He is not close enough to hear everything they say, but close enough to see that the 's beards are trimmed and they wear well-repaired clothes
'm going to freshen up
need a drink
2
'm going up to change
He hears one of the   across the old floorboards and up the stairs to change while the other  takes a few steps towards the rest room, then turns back towards the window as the conversation lurches on
2
Who left this window open
leave it open for the smell
2
What smell
You don't smell it anymore
Who wants a drink
() 38
: They hear the sound of the    and
As all this goes on, the  is frozen, eyes wide with fear, he slips the pistol from his belt, cocks it and squats on his haunches so he's close to the , desperate, unable to decide what to do, unable to think straight with fear
The  is staring from the door to the pistol to the bloodied basin as if hypnotised, in shock, babbling somewhat
(,
) Bad guys
bad men
Shh, shh
There are   outside the door as the drift closer and then away again
The man starts to cough but he has the revolver in one hand and the 's hand in his other
The  tries to stifle his cough but can't
Then the notices and holds his own small hand to the 's mouth, stifling his coughing as the talk goes on outside: Will you help me with the dirty dishes
2
'm hungry
As the coughing subsides a little the  takes the 's hand from his mouth and pushes the revolver into it
Take it
The  tries to resist, shaking his head, terrified, mute
(
) (') Take it
The  puts his left arm around the 's tiny, thin shoulders and holds him close
(
) (') Don't be afraid
If they get hold of you, you're going to have to do it just like everybody else
Do you understand
Shh
No crying
Do you hear me
The  turns from the window and one of the pours whiskey and hands her one
() 39
: (2) The  is weeping and shaking his head as the  shows him again what to do with the gun
(
) Stop crying
You have to be a brave boy
You know how to do it
(
) think so
(
) Say "Yes  do Papa
" He stares down at the little  who just holds the gun feebly
he realises the  won't use it
After a moment of torturous contemplation, the  very gently takes the gun from the 's hand and the  sits forlornly, staring down at his hands, afraid to look at the  now
When the looks up again he is staring down the barrel of the pistol, the  aiming the large revolver at the 's forehead
What are you doing
The 's hand shakes, his thumb trembles on the hammer as he cocks it
(') Papa
'm sorry
'm so sorry
Will  see you again
When will see you
The 's finger trembles on the trigger as he slowly squeezes it
At that moment there's a loud  from the kitchen and the    stop and listen, then rush through to the kitchen, and immediately there's a commotion as they see the state of the hatch with the table over it
2(
) What the fuck do you think you're doing
Huh
What the fuck do you think you're doing
(
) Don't look at me like that
What are you doing
() 40
: ( 3) The  gathers his wits and opens the door a crack
Follow me, take my hand, don't let go
/  - The  bursts out of the rest room with the  and they make a dash for the open window
He sticks his gun in his belt and wrestles with the window, an old colonial style frame which sticks
From behind the closed kitchen door they hear muffled and  until the  wrenches the window open, stuffs the through and follows
/  - The  picks the  up and they rush down the steps
/  - They rush down the driveway and the  drags the  through a gap in the dead privet hedge onto the road
- They hesitate a moment on the road, deciding
Come on, keep running
They rush across the road to the woods on the other side, the ahead as the  checks behind them
The  looks back towards the house and two of the -  have come outside, looking around suspiciously
He hits the ground and takes the  with him, they lie flat at the edge of the woods and the road
They are wildly out of breath, chests heaving, the  coughing
(') Keep your head down
- the -  walk a few steps down the drive and a   looks through  at the road and the woods, but not directly at the  and the  hiding
The    start looking around the side of the house, walking away
The  and the  get up, dash through the treeline and disappear into the woods
41
- dull moon hidden in the ashen sky and the outlines of trees as they set off through the woods, sleepy, stumbling like drunks now
They hear a hideous  in the distance, coming from the house
They stop, hearing another  and a '
The  holds the  close and tries to cover the 's ears as they stare and wait for-it to pass
We'll be safe soon
They're going to eat those people aren't they, Papa
The  does not answer
/  - They are back in the city, trudging through the parking lot of a huge shopping mall, just outside what used to be department store
dull moon hidden in the ashen sky illuminates the ruined store front as the  looks up at the mall, thinking
The  is just staring into space, still in shock
/ - ( 8) - The  and the  have set up camp in the mall, outside the entrance
The  is building a big fire
The stares through the glass at the deserted department store
Nearby, strewn across the doorway are bunches and bundles of cash in notes and coins
the  looks closer and finds expensive items of jewelry still in their boxes,  from the store and discarded
The  sits, he looks like he's given up, and then: Papa
Papa, we wouldn't ever eat anybody would we
No
Of course not
No matter how hungry we were
Even if we were starving
() 42
: We're starving now
Because, because we're the good guys
Yes
And we're carrying the fire
Yes
The  takes the  in his arms
In a moment the  starts blinking sleepily and drifts off to sleep and the  strokes the sleeping 's hair and kisses him on the forehead
/  - They walk through the parking lot until the come to a supermarket around the other side
few old cars in a trash strewn parking lot
The  heads through the defunct automatic doors
Come on
There's nobody here
- The  and the  trudge the empty aisles, only litter remaining, the once brightly-colored packaging strewn around, it's contents long since looted
In the empty gun section there is a deer's head mounted on the wall
The  stops and stares, mesmerised while the searches the empty shelves for ammo, finding only empty boxes
The  glimpses a woman's face staring dolefully from an aisle - an emaciated, dead beat  watching them, vanishing as quickly as she appeared
On their way out they come to a pair of vending machines tipped over, the sodas looted, coins scattered around in the ash
The  sits beside one and feels inside the gutted machine, eventually producing a single unopened can of () 43
: (
) What is it, papa
It's a treat for you
Here
Sit down
He helps the little  off with his knapsack and sits him down and opens the can of  ceremoniously
The  looks startled and sniffs the fizzing can as if it's the strangest thing he's ever seen in his life
(') Go ahead
The  takes the can
It's bubbly
Go ahead
Drink it
The  takes a sip and considers
It's really good
You have some, papa
No
want you to drink it
But  want you to have some
The  reluctantly takes the can and has a tiny sip, hands it back to the wary
(') It's because 'll never get to drink another one, isn't it
The  doesn't know what to say
/  - They head out of the mall now towards the road, lifeless traffic lights at the intersection, town houses and apartment blocks on the other side of the road
The  stops to listen, stares around, suddenly energised, bobbing on his toes
() 44
: What's wrong with you
What was that
didn't hear anything
Listen
don't hear anything
They listen more until, very faintly we hear a   in the distance
The  turns around 180 degrees to listen, alert with anticipation
(') It's a dog
(
) dog
Where did it come from
don't know
Come on
The  walks across the road, past the apartments and the follows, bouncing up and down, over-excited now
We're not going to kill it are we Papa
What
No, we're not going to kill it
Why did you say that
You still got one bullet left
We're not going to hurt the dog, promise
We're not going to kill it and we're not going to eat it either
( ,
) Maybe it'll eat us
() 45
: (2) doubt it very much
Can we look for it
It's gone, okay
- They trudge through the suburbs on the edge of the city, past what used to be the local ball park, now barren, dead, a vast flat expanse of ash and cracked, scorched earth, forlorn stands and bleachers blackened by ash and soot
What is it
used to watch the ball games here with my father
- They walk up a once tree-lined suburban street, barren now, ash and dust layer what used to be front lawns, post boxes, picket fences, porches, crazy paving
The  stops outside a typical, suburban clapboard house with a dead, cracked yard where the lawn used to be and a bare flag pole
The  eyes the  enquiringly
What is this place, Papa
It's the house where  grew up
They go up to the house - clapboards have been removed for firewood leaving studs and insulation exposed
The  stops, reluctant to go further, and the  takes a few more steps then turns around to check on him
(') You coming
don't want to
Don't you want to see where  grew up
() 46
: There might be somebody in there
There's nobody there now
The  takes the 's hand and they approach a basketball hoop by the garage
The  is momentarily overcome with emotion as he recalls the details, but it doesn't mean much to the
After a moment the  goes up the steps - frightened, but horribly compelled at the same time
The  follows nervously
'm scared
We've got to find something to eat
'm not hungry
'm not
The  takes his revolver from his belt and approaches the front door, warily pushing it open
We'll be all right
Come on
He goes through the front door - the  stays where he is, rigid with fear
The  notices a stuffed toy dog in the window, staring out at the garden and his curiosity takes over
The  goes inside carefully
/ - The pine panelling is stripped from the walls, there is some broken furniture but much has been taken for firewood
They go over to the fireplace and the  examines it
He runs his fingers along the mantle where there is an old drawing pin still stuck in the wood, nostalgia overcoming his fear
This is where we used to have Christmas when  was a boy
We'd hang our stockings right here
The  examines the yellow tiled surround
The  watches the  as if he's gone mad
() 47
: (') My mother scrubbed these every day
It's still spotless
Much of the woodwork and the floorboards have been stripped and taken for firewood - there are gaping holes
By the fireplace is a small pile of bones - and--in the grid are more burnt bones and the skull from the family cat
The takes it all in sadly but the  is unmoved
Papa
don't think we should do this
You want to wait outside
The  nods vigorously
(') All right
He takes the 's hand and leads him out
/ - The come out onto the porch
Sit here on the stoop and don't go away
The  sits quietly and the  goes back inside
After a moment he starts going through his knapsack, less afraid now
- The floorboards  horribly, swollen from rain or ripped up, as he creeps into the living room
The timber cladding is stripped from the walls, the ceiling plaster is collapsed, beams exposed
The  pads through to the kitchen
/  - The kitchen is similarly dilapidated, the cupboards stripped bare
On a shelf by the window are dusty jars of fruit, preserved
He grabs a jar, prizes open the lid and finds a an oily slick of black mucus floating in the top, like rotted mushroom spores
He sniffs it suspiciously, holds it up to the light
() 48
: In the light small black fish hook-shaped spores drift from the top of the jar to the bottom
He replaces the lid, appalled
/  - The  is sitting on the steps of the porch drawing with crayons on a pad taken from his knapsack
Across the road is another big old house, much of the clapboard missing, swathed in dead brambles - the  suddenly looks up and stares at it, distracted
- The  comes outside and regards the deadened yard, old garden hoe and spade, gardening equipment and several dead apple trees
He goes over and examines the ashen ground and digs about to unearth several small, dark brown, shrivelled spheres spaced several feet apart - apples
He bends down and picks one up, examines, sniffs
He gathers up the strange apples and stuffs them in his pockets
/  - The  is still staring at the house across the road when he notices   , completely still, in a window
The drops the pad and crayon and stands, surprised, not believing his eyes - it is the face of a   roughly his age, which disappears almost immediately, receding back into the gloom like a ghost
/  - The  is in the looted pantry
He finds some shrivelled raisins that haves spilt and hidden in the back of the shelf
He puts them into a handkerchief, folds it and pockets it
He : (
) Stop - stop
The  freezes, then charges out
/  - The  rushes out and stares about frantically for the  - he's gone
- The  has run across the road to another house
() 49
: - peeping around the side of the house is the other , the same age, similarly grimy and thin, wearing an outsize woollen coat
The other   disappears down the side and the  runs after him
Wait
Come back
won't hurt you
- The  runs to the bottom of the yard where there is various suburban garden detritus, a dusty lawn mower, a clothes line, a shed, bikes with no tyres
Where are you
The  comes sprinting up the side of the house and seizes him by the arm
What are you doing
What the hell are you doing
There's a little boy, Papa,  saw a little boy
There's no little boy
What's the matter with you
Yes there is
saw him
boy just like me
The  takes the  by the arm and drags him back through the yard, up the side of the house, the  resisting, crying and looking back all the way
(') Why
Why can't  go and see him
- Out the front of the house the  digs his heels in and the has to drag him, his feet slithering through the dirt
need to see him
need to
() 50
: Why
just do
The  has gone limp, weeping bitterly, resisting being moved
The  gives up and squats beside the sobbing
Okay, 'm sorry
understand
He holds him, wipes his tears from his cheeks
/ - In the failing light they come across a late model Chevy abandoned under an overpass
Papa
Will there be other boys like me at the coast
hope so
The  goes to the car, wipes thick dust from the windscreen and peers in - it's empty
- ( 9) - They try to get comfortable in the leather seats, the spreading the blankets over them and tucking the  in
They are quiet a moment as they watch darkness start to fall
: got you something The  produces from his pocket one of the tiny hard brown apples and holds it up to the remaining light
What is it
It's an apple
() 51
: He hands it to the boy who examines it curiously
The takes out a pocket knife, takes the apple back, cuts the apple in half to reveal a woody brown interior
They regard the mahogany apple uncertainly, the  is the first to take a bite, with some difficulty
The  bites his half and makes a face
(') Suck it a while and it'll soften
They sit sucking and chewing the ancient apple
Did you ever have any friends
The  eyes the  - curious at the sudden question
Yes
did
Lots of them
Yes
Do you remember them
Yes
remember all of them
What happened to them
They died
All of them
Yes
All of them

: (
0
) He yearns for his own friends and imagines how things will be different at the coast - and that there will be other children there
When  have nothing else, try to dream the dreams of a child's imaginings
- The  and  walk along a desolate road in what was once farmland, grain silos loom ominously, still standing
Do you know where we are Papa
think we're about two hundred miles from the coast
As the crow flies
"As the crow flies
" It means, going in a straight line
- In the background, something catches his eye and he : frieze of  , dried with taut grins and shrunken eyes, perched on wooden poles
Some are tattooed with targets and runic slogans
Some are skinless, with signs and words inked onto them
One has suture marks etched on it, like a blue print for assembly
There aren't any crows are there
Just in books
Yeah, just in books
The  stares at the heads as the  continues his conversation, distracted and not seeing the heads
Do you think there might be crows somewhere
() 53
: don't know
But what do you think
think it's unlikely
They keep walking and talking, the  grim-faced but the intent on what's ahead
Could they fly to Mars or some place
No, they couldn't fly to Mars
Because it's too far
Yes
The  discretely hurries the  on with a guiding hand towards the woods and off the road
What if they tried and-and-and they just got halfway or something and then they were too tired
Would they fall back down
- On the edge of the wood the  and the  stop to examine footprints in the snow
The  listens and hears: the low  of   in the distance
He looks at the exhausted  a moment
We can't go back on the road
Why, Papa
think someone's coming
() 54
: The  stares at the tracks
The  stares in both directions, examining the road in the distance
He moves a few paces and notices tied to a dead sapling a thin red neckerchief
He takes a few steps and through a gap in the trees sees a clearing - snow and a mass of , the icy snow stained blood red like a sorbet killing floor
Will they see our tracks
We'll cover them
The  moves the  away and kicks snow over their tracks - then lays fresh ones going in several different directions
The  copies him, leaving his own maze of tracks
They run off keeping parallel with the road but staying off it
- in the distance   appear on the road
(') Here they come
The  now looks over his shoulder for a good look, then grabs the 's hand and takes off
- come prowling on the , they are  from some sort of , wearing the same red neckerchiefs and carrying weapons, searching, predatory
- we see that only 30 feet away, concealed amongst the trees, the  and  are crouched in blankets, watching
The two  stop and look around, as if they sense the and the  - who freeze, frightened to breathe
The sniff the air menacingly
One of them walks over to a stone by the side of the road, leans down and starts sharpening his lance, made from a the straightened coil spring of a car
The  and the  watch - wide-eyed
Eventually the  walk off up the road
What are we going to do
No answer
55
- ( 10) - There is a thick carpet of gray snow
The man lays out a tarp on the ground and blankets on top
Out of the murky sky more gray snow is falling
The  is distracted by a sudden noise, the   of sheering wood - this time very close
He looks around just as: Out of nowhere a tree branch sails down, barely missing them, landing with a heavy  just feet away
Move
Quickly
He tries to get the  to his feet but he is limp, staring around blearily, exhausted
They hear another loud
Then the  of timber and another  as trees start to keel over around them
The grabs the  and runs as best he can through the snow and falling trees
They have abandoned their blankets, tarp and backpacks
What's happening
Just keep moving, run
They rush through the woods as more and more trees fall one after the other, , , , great loads of snow falling from limbs to the ground with a , setting the woods shuddering
The  is getting bogged in the snow and the  stoops and scoops up the  and they cram themselves under a fat fallen tree to shield themselves
/,  - ( 11) - They are huddled inside a huge  , sheltering
The  is wrapped up inside the man's coat, wet and shivering, wide awake, nerves shredded, too anxious to lie down and sleep now
The  boils water in a car hubcab
He takes from his pocket the handkerchief filled with raisins, offers them
That's all there is, isn't it
() 56 : Yes
There's nothing left anywhere
No
They sit eating raisins, saying nothing until they're finished
Can  ask you something
Sure
Are we going to die now
The  just looks at the , then looks away
What do you think is going to happen
We're just going to suddenly keel over and die
It takes a long time to die of starvation
The important thing is water to stop you dehydrating
We've got water
We'll be all right

Atownin the far distance ahead of the  and the
TheBOYis hunched over with a hunger cramp
They are both wetandshivering
The  eyes the  anxiously
/  - The  stands on the back patio of a house on the edge of town, the  at his side, fields stretching out before them, the land flattened and dead, ravaged fences running the perimeter
In the yard are a few dead trees, a fence, a metal tool shed, an old barbecue on the patio made from a 44 gallon drum
The  slides the patio door open and peers inside gingerly
57
/  - The  is in the bedroom looking around for useful things - it has been stripped, the wooden frame gone from the window, the bureau ransacked and chopped up - only a summer dress on a wire hanger on the back of the door remains
He glances at empty drawers on the floor and a cupboard before turning his attention to the bed
He blinks and sways a moment, trying to focus on: - underneath the filthy, dusty blankets a thin, dried head pokes out, the blankets pulled up to the chin
On the pillow are long hunks of rotted hair
(
0
) Every day is a lie
But  am slowly dying
That is not a lie
am trying to prepare him for the day when  am gone
He takes hold of the lower hem of the blanket and tows it off the bed, revealing a desiccated corpse
He ignores it, shaking the blanket out and folding it under his arm
He notices the  at his side, watching wide-eyed
(') Nothing you haven't seen before
They go out
/  - The  opens and shuts empty cupboards, slamming the doors, increasingly desperate, close to tears of frustration now
Eventually he feels dizzy and has to sit on the floor
He just sits there, alone on the kitchen floor, clenching and unclenching his fists, his head in his hands, when he hears: (
) Papa
The  draws his pistol and goes out, alert again
- The  is staring at himself in a dusty, flyblown full length mirror
As the  comes in he sees the 's reflection and his own and jumps
It's us
() 58
: The  stares at his reflection - he looks like an alien, skinny with giant staring eyes on shaky legs
(') We look skinny
We are skinny
The  puts the blanket around the 's shoulders
He notices an old upright piano, covered in ash and dust
The stares as he goes to it, lifts the lid and plays a chord
The 's eyes light up and he is magnetized, instantly coming over and waiting for the next note
The  plays another chord
What is it
It's a piano
What's it for
For making music
This
( ) is music
Your mother played very well
don't remember
Before you were born
We had one just like it
It was beautiful
What happened to it
Chopped it up for firewood
He stares into space, slumps suddenly, overcome with emotion as he remembers: - - Just the  and the pregnant  alone in the house, just before the  was born
Some of the furniture has been broken up for firewood - there are broken pieces by the fire and a huge axe propped on the hearth
() 59
: The  stands at the piano and tries to play
She plays for a moment and the  cracks a rare smile - the piano is out of tune and she stops
She plays a bit more but soon starts to bang the keys atonally in frustration
The  just lets her get on with it until she's spent
used to worry what would happen if there was a fire
What would save
What could  bear to lose
There used to be so many things, so many beautiful things
Things people made
Things nature made
Who knew we would lose it all
'll strip the floorboards
You can't live without a floor
You can't live without a piano
She starts to dismantle the piano, opening the lid, taking it off it's hinges, it's heavy, she hands him the heavy lid and he reluctantly dumps it on the floor
It's my piano
bought it for you
It needs tuning
Who's going to tune it
Can you tune it
They look at each other sadly
They take the front piece away and dump that
The  picks up the axe and hands it to the He swings it at the frame
- The  walks toward a tin shed and crosses the dead grass
He stops suddenly
He stamps about a bit, listening
He continues on into the shed
Beside the shed sits an The man reappears, spade in hand
He digs the spade into the dead grass and hear's it into wood
He digs more urgently, increasingly exhausted, until a door is revealed in the dirt
() 60
: He is so engrossed he hasn't noticed the  standing a few feet away, watching with saucer eyes, scared
Don't open it, Papa
It'll be okay
Please, Papa, please
It's okay
No it's not
What if there's people hiding down there
The  ignores him, focussed as he chops the plywood around the lock, gets the spade under a corner and levers the door open
The  has his fists bunched up to his chest, bobbing up and down with fear
The  starts to descend a hand made wooden stair case in the bunker
He takes another disposable lighter from his pocket, gives the child a kiss on the forehead and then disappears into the bunker, leaving the worried  staring after him
The  looks around at the deserted yard as the evening draws in, now even more frightened
(
) Oh my God
oh my God
What is it, Papa
(
) Come down
Oh my God come down
The  is in the hole and down the steps like lightning
- ( 12) - The little   down the steps
The  is busy lighting up candles
Papa
What did you find
Everything
found everything
() 61
: Stored in the bunker are crate upon crate of canned goods: tomatoes, peaches, beans, apricots, canned ham, corned beef, hundreds of gallons of water in ferry cans and in boxes paper towels, toilet paper and trash bags stuffed with blankets
The  takes the 's hand and helps him down, then goes back up the steps and draws the door shut and jams a pair of metal pliers through the heavy inside hasp to stop the door being opened
He goes back down the steps to the  and holds up a candle to illuminate the shelves
(') Can you see
What is all this stuff
It's food
Can you read the labels
The  stares at the brightly colored packaging, he's never seen anything like it before
The  hands the  a tin
"Pears
" It says "pears
" Yes
It does
Oh yes it does
Pears
They inspect the shelves: chilli, corn, stew, soup, spaghetti sauce, the 's eyes are like saucers
Is it real
Oh yes, it's real all right
The  pulls a box of butane lighters from the shelf and tests one, it doesn't work
He tests another which works, it has a large flame - he uses it to read the labels
Why is it here
Because someone thought it might be needed
But they died
() 62
: (2) Yes
What would you like for breakfast
(
) Pears
Pears it is
The  claws open a box and pulls out a tin of pears
He gets paper bowls from a stack, plastic forks and spoons, lays them out
He finds a camping lamp
He puts a butane cannister in and lights up the lamp
He finds a can opener and opens the pears while the  watches silently, wrapping a blanket around himself and sitting on the soft bunk bed
Is it okay for us to take it
They'd want us to
The  dishes up two bowls of pears and they sit side by side on the bunk with spoons and pears
(') These will be the best pears you ever tasted
The best
You just wait
They eat in silence
They lick the spoons and drink the syrup from the bowls
The  feels inside his mouth with his fingers - the sugar irritating a sore tooth
(') Too sweet
The  smiles, amused, and the  opens another tin
- ( 12)- Ham and powdered eggs frying in a pan on the camping stove
The kettle is boiling on another ring of the gas stove
The just stares at the bubbling food as the  cooks
Nearby a breakfast table is set out on a stack of boxes acting as a breakfast bar: biscuits, a plate of butter, condensed milk, salt and pepper plates and utensils
() 63
: The  brings the pan over and forks over chunks of ham onto the pates, then spoonsfull of scrambled eggs from a second pan, then baked beans from a small pot
The  just stares, as if drugged, uncomprehending, the food alien to him
Go ahead
Don't let it get cold
What do  eat first
Whatever you like
The  eats a hunk of ham as the  pours coffee
Is this coffee
That's right
Careful it's hot
He hands him coffee
We did good, didn't we Papa
Yeah, we did good
- ( 12)- The  puts the  to bed in a bunk and smooths his filthy hair tenderly, smiling with relief, until the  shuts his eyes and nods off
He covers the  with a blanket and kisses him
He just sits watching the  sleep, suddenly on the verge of tears
- ( 12) - The  folds the 's tiny clothes, noticing the bulging pockets of his pants
He empties them, creating a small pile of collected artefacts: a smooth stone, a marble, an old house key, bottle tops, a smooth, hand made Indian arrow head, fashioned from stone, lastly a broken piece of a woman's mother of pearl hair comb
By the 's bunk he unfolds the crayon drawing he's been working on and examines it, deeply moved: () 64
: - an eccentric, childlike drawing of the , skinny like a stick figure but, inexplicably, with a brightly smiling face and big laughing eyes, labelled simply "mom" in spidery scrawl
Stirring classical music fades up and into: - - Close in on a pair of  in stockings, a summer dress, a 's hands holding a 's hand in her lap
The feels the tops of the stockings with his fingers
- the  is with the  in a concert theatre, at a recital
The  wears the mother of pearl hair comb
The seats are velvet, gold scrollwork adorns the boxes, an illustrious, fortunate world
- ( 12) - The  wakes blearily and immediately notices his collection of artefacts turfed out by the bed
Nearby the  is dressing as the  starts gathering up his collection crossly, especially protective of the arrow ahead - or just embarrassed
They look at each other
What
(
) Don't touch my stuff
- The hatch opens and the 's face appears, as he looks around
He opens the hatch more and clambers out with a couple of jerry cans of water, the yard is quiet
Next, the 's face pops up and peers around
He clambers out carrying a big pot with a camping stove in it
,   - They empty the jerry cans into the huge pot, light the stove and put the pot on the stove to heat the water
65
,   - The  is in the bath, filthy and scrawny, as the  bathes him, rubbing him with soap, scrubbing an oily film of scum from his dirty neck to reveal clean pale skin underneath
What do you think
Nice and warm
He washes the 's hair, lathing water over him with the pot
He has a sudden thought: : /  - - the  watches unseen from the doorway as the tenderly washes the 's hair - he is perhaps a year younger than at the start of the film - she appears lost in the task, enjoying it, chatting away to the , momentarily unburdened
She sticks a finger in the 's ears, giving them a good soaping, which he likes
You could grow potatoes in these ears
,   - - now the  is in the tub, also scrawny and filthy, lost in thought as he soaps up - the  helps
,   - The  trims his beard off with scissors in a mirror
He lathers up with shaving cream and starts to shave with a plastic safety razor
When the  is done he turns to the , wiping away the foam
How do  look
Weird
Won't you be cold
,   - Now the  is cutting the 's hair with kitchen scissors and a plastic comb
() 66
: The  has a towel around his shoulders and long locks of hair decorate it
The  finishes, takes the towel off, wipes the 's neck and face with a flannel, holds up a mirror for the  to see
look funny
- ( 12) - They sit on the bunk bed with a checkerboard between them sipping thick hot chocolate made with condensed milk from plastic mugs and concentrating on the board, their worn out, wet blue jeans drying on a drying rack in the back ground
They are both wearing new sweaters too big for them, plundered from the stores
The  watches the  fondly, absorbed in checkers
- Heavy rain slashes down on the lawn, already pools of water are flooding the lawn
- ( 12) - shiny new quart of whiskey is slipped from its paper liquor store bag and opened with a soft
The whiskey is poured into a glass with a satisfying
- another feast is laid out, ham and powdered mash potato and biscuits and gravy
The  is eating while the pours a whiskey
The  stops eating to watch the drink the whiskey
The 's eyes glaze as he sips the strong liquor, dizzy already
Can  try some
No
You won't like it
Makes you feel funny
The  stares, curious, wanting it
(') You think  come from another world, don't you
Filled with all these strange things you've never seen
Sort of
() 67
: Well,  do  guess
- The  just stands in the middle of the lawn  his guts up in the dark rain - again the phlemy wet cough
He bends over, sweating, listening, knowing it's the sound of fluid on the lungs
As he listens he hears something above the rain - he keeps shifting position, as if hearing different sounds from different directions
Nevertheless he anxiously looks around, then goes to the porch and drags an old mattress over, across the dead grass to the hatch
He lays it half across the hatch, crawls through the remaining gap and hauls the mattress the rest of the way over the hatch, then pulls the hatch closed with the old mattress lying on top
It just looks like an old mattress lying on a lawn in the rain
- ( 12) - The  listens to the  of rain and hears another sound
something or someone  around the mattress above
He hears the sound of the  being  off of the door
He hears  and  on the door and freezes, staring at the lock, waiting for the inevitable
He quietly picks up the revolver
He looks across and sees the  is now wide awake too, staring, wide- eyed
What is it
Shh
(
) Maybe it's a dog
(
) It's not a dog
(
) It is
It's a dog
dog
The  listens anxiously as the pawing and scratching continues, the wood over the bunker amplifying the noise
He cocks the revolver and positions himself under the hatch, ready
() 68
: If it's a dog it'll be with someone
Who
don't know
After a torturous moment the sounds die away
(') 'm not waiting to find out
Come on
Let's get out of here
don't want to go
know but it's not safe anymore
The  grabs his gun and cocks it, rushes about turning out all the lamps, and they sit anxiously in the darkness
- - it's now lighter outside, the mattress lifts as the opens the trap door and very carefully peeps out
He looks around, all angles, checking the coast is clear, then shuts the hatch again
- ( 12) - The  starts loading cans and packets into a carton
He gathers a couple of large jerry cans of water
The  helps
What are we going to do with all this stuff
We'll just have to take what we can
wish we could live here
And we could keep the dog and the dog could catch food for us
() 69
: Look, there is no dog, okay
'm sorry but there just isn't
Well what is it
don't know what it is
Please Papa
No
Just say it's going to be all right, Papa
Say it
Just say it, please
The  doesn't know what to say, losing patience
Listen, trouble comes when you least expect it
So maybe the thing to do is to just always expect it
Do you always expect it
Papa
do, yes
You always think bad things are going to happen but we found this place
Maybe we'll find another place like this at the coast
Maybe
The  dumps the carton of food on the floor and packs another, organising jerry cans of water
- The   is loaded up and tied with a grey tarp
() 70
: What are you doing
We'll have to cover our tracks from now on
The  drags the old mattress back over the entrance to the bunker
He carefully covers the surrounding area with debris
- The  pulls the new trolley across a bridge, stagnant black water underneath, the trolley is now laden with jerry cans of fresh water and cartons containing as many tins of food and supplies as they could manage
The  trails along behind
They are a strange sight, clean clothed, clean shaven, short haired, in their new jumpers - and now both wearing new surgical masks which they raise off their faces to speak
The  keeps checking behind him
- he sees the glint of glass, perhaps a pair of watching them
The  watches anxiously as the  gets out his own and looks through them
- a mysterious winking glint of light which quickly disappears
- through a different pair of binoculars, a completely different , we see the  looking through his binoculars at us
think they're following us
Who
don't know
You think it's bad guys
Probably
What if it's good guys
() 71
: don't think we're likely to meet any good guys for a while
We have to be careful now
We've got food
/  - As they round a bend in the road they see a hunched figure walking ahead of them
The  stops abruptly, gets out the binoculars and watches: - a distant, hunched figure hobbling away from them
- They come up behind an  , hunched over, withered, silent as he hobbles ahead
He wears layers of torn clothing and his feet are wrapped in rags and cardboard tied with green twine
They slowly approach and the man stops, turns and watches them suspiciously as they draw level
don't have anything for you
You can look if you want
got nothing
We're not robbers
The   leans an ear forward, deaf
What
said we're not robbers
What are you
We're just like you
What are you following me for
We're not following you
We've got food we could give him
() 72
: He's not getting any food
The   looks away, avoiding their eyes
He's scared, Papa
Everybody's scared
Please Papa
RIGHT1 The  eyes the road to the left and right, then draws his revolver
(') If this is an ambush, he goes first
He goes out to the trolley and rummages in it while the and the   stare at each other
The  comes back with a tin of fruit cocktail and a tin opener and opens it and hands it to the
The  places the tin of fruit on the road in front of the
Take it
Here
The   doesn't move
(') What about a spoon
He's not getting a spoon
The  urges him on, miming with his hands, as if feeding a raccoon
Eat it
It's good
The   picks up the tin and his filthy long nails on the tin as he tips it to his mouth, the juice running down his chin, his head jerking as he swallows
() 73
: (2) (') Look, Papa
He's hungry
see it
And  know what you're going to ask me
And the answer is No
What's the question
We can't keep him
They watch him eating painfully slowly
The   finishes and sits down in the road holding the tin, staring at it, as if it might refill
(') When did you last eat
The   just stares
(') Do you want to eat with us
don't know
What do  have to do
Tell us where the world went
What
You don't have to do anything
Can you walk okay
They help the   off the road and hand him his cane but he pushes it away
can walk
They walk off the road towards the dead, blackened woods
- As they leave the road the   studies the
The goes to take his hand: () 74
: (
) Don't hold his hand
He can't see
Don't
The trio walk into the woods
(') How old are you
'm ninety
Ninety my ass
Is that what you tell people
So they don't hurt you
Uh-huh
Does it work
Nope
What's your name
Ely
Just "Ely
" What's wrong with "Ely
" / - ( 14) - There's a camp fire now
The   sits wrapped in a quilt, eating with a spoon and-licking his plate clean
In the far distance, the faint glow of fires
The orange light bounces into the night sky eerily
() 75
: How come you're still alive
What do you eat
don't know
People give you things
No they don't
You did
didn't
He did
The   eyes the , closely, half blind
Are you a little boy
What does he look like

can't see real good
Is that right
Can you see me
No
But  can tell somebody's there
(
) Okay
You need to sleep
Come on
He gathers up the  and takes him a few feet away, settles him down in blankets while the   stares into the fire

Gone
all gone
What happened to him

: (2) can't
can't talk about that
leastways not with you can't
When the  returns he has his gun which he surreptitiously places on the ground in full view of the
You can see that, right
Okay
Tell me now
You're not a shill for a pack of road agents
'm not anything
'll go if you want me to

The  stares at the   cynically but the   just stares back blankly
(') live like an animal
You don't want to know the things 've had to eat
When  saw that boy  thought 'd died and he was an angel never thought 'd see a child again
never thought that would happen to me
He is an angel
To me he's a God
Well  hope that's not true
To be on the road with the last surviving God would be a pretty frightening experience
Why do you say that
Where men can't live, Gods can't either
The road gangs would tear you limb from limb, both of you
The low  in the earth is heard again, an earthquake, this time in the distance
They listen a moment
(') knew this was coming
This or something like it
() () 77
: (3) (') There were warnings
People thought it was a con -  always believed in it
Did you try to get ready for it
No
What would you do
Even if you knew what to do you wouldn't know what to do
Suppose you were the last man left alive
How would you know if you were the last man alive
don't guess you would know it
You'd just be it
Maybe God would know
If there is a God up there he would have turned his back on us by now
Whoever made humanity will find no humanity here
The  pours hot water into mugs to make coffee, hands one to the
They drink
Do you ever wish you would die
No
It's foolish to ask for luxuries in times like these
- ( 14) - The  and the   are standing by the trolley
The is watching from further away
The   is fitting another can of peaches the  has given him into his knapsack
You should thank him you know wouldn't have given you anything
() 78
: Maybe  should and maybe shouldn't
wouldn't have given you anything
The   looks around, orientating himself, and goes, tapping his cane, without a glance back at the  or the The  gives the  a reproachful look and the looks defiant for the first time, a new distance between them
He's going to die and you don't care
care enough
Maybe when we're out of food you'll have more time to think about it
You always say watch out for bad guys but that old man wasn't a bad guy and you can't even tell anymore
- ( 13) - The  and the  are camped inside an old church, dusty, faded stained glass is the only colour, startling after all the monochrome
The  and  are wrapped up in blankets, a small fire going
The  is asleep but the  is awake, coughing
He sits up, still coughing
He gets up and walks outside, trying to stifle the coughing
- ( 13) - He wanders into an antechamber, coughing uncontrollably, falls to his knees in a shroud of morning mist flooding the church - and coughs up a gob of something dark and nasty, spits it into the misty ground
- the mist before him clears to reveal a spattering of dark blood on the pale ash
He stares, shocked, knowing what it signifies
- ( 13) - The  opens his eyes, he hasn't been asleep, listening to the  cough, worried
The  returns and eyes the worried () 79
: What's wrong
had a bad dream
What about
don't want to tell you
Just you
What happened to me
The 's face crinkles up, he starts to sob
The  coughs again and the  shoots out a hand, puts it over the 's mouth to staunch the coughing

You're still alive
It's when you start to dream about good things you should start to worry
/ ,   - They are trudging along the blacktop adjacent to a railway line
There is a  blast in the distance and the and the  stop and look around
The  checks behind him instinctively
- a thin spike of smoke from a campfire rising up in the woods behind
The  notices and looks behind
Do you think they're still following us
think they've been following us for a long time
-
Maybe it's Ely - the old man
How
On a broom stick
() 80
: The  thinks about this for a moment as they approach the railway line
,   ( 15) The  and the  are swaddled in blankets up amongst the rocks with a birds eye view of the road and a railway bridge they can see along the road and the dead trees for half a mile
The  is nodding off, his head lolling as the keeps watch, increasingly paranoid
,   ( 16) As they come down from the bluffs, the  is staring into the dead woods where another thin stem of  is rising
What is it
More smoke
think we should take a look
don't want to
Let's just keep going
Whoever it is  don't want them behind us
What if they're bad guys
What if they're good guys
They look at each other, a stalemate
The  stands and starts to pack up the tarp
(') Look
Whoever it is out there, it's better to know about it than to not know
Why
Because we don't like surprises
Surprises are scary
() () 81
: (') They could sneak up on us further down the road
You need to learn this
The  folds the tarp and sleeping blankets and starts heading down the slope to the trolley, the  following
,   - deserted campsite, a campfire, recently abandoned
The and the  look around, disappointed
/ ,   - Open country now, completely blackened landscape under heavy ash
They are stopped
The  unfolds the threadbare map on the ground, a crayon in his hand
You know where we are
No
Where do you think
The  points to a place on the map
(') More
Here
No
We're closer than you think
He takes the crayon and points on the map
(') This is us
This is all sea
Is it blue
-
The sea
don't know
It used to be
() 82
: The  picks up a desiccated pine cone from the ground, and stares at it, hollow-eyed, hungry
He squeezes it and it crumbles to dust
He takes a few steps, sniffing the air
(') Can you smell that
It smells different
Everything is going to be different
- The landscape has changed, dead salt bush and sand at the side of the road and finally, as they come around a bend in the road: dead sea grass sloping up to sand dunes up ahead
They look at each other and head for the dunes excitedly
The hides the trolley discretely, so the  doesn't see his concern, he takes their bags, tarps and blankets with them as they head off for the dunes
- - Gray beach, lead gray sea and waves rolling in slowly with a distant
On the beach a tide mark of wet gray ashy sludge and a skirt of glistening bones, fish skeletons bleached white on the sand
They take their parka hoods down and just stand there staring at the beach, the wind  around them, dozens of bleached  and   and    who have made it this far only to die
The  looks at the and sees the intense disappointment
'm sorry it's not blue
/ - They sit on the beach wrapped in blankets staring at a surreal wall of impenetrable smog not far beyond where the waves are breaking
The  eyes the silent , buffeted by wind, wrapped in a blanket, staring at the empty ocean
there is nothing and nobody there
They keep staring out to sea, filled with disappointment
The  impassively surveys the wall of smog which is like an iron curtain
What's on the other side
() 83
: Nothing
There must be something
Maybe there's a father and his little boy and they're sitting on the beach too
And they could be carrying the fire too
They could be, yes
The  sees the 's hopefulness reappearing and strokes his head, his heart breaking for him
'  - The  and the  stand with their shoes off, the black sea washes up the sand at their filthy, blistered feet
What are our long term goals
"What are our long term goals
" Where did you hear that
don't know
You said it
When
long time ago
When your mother was here
guess
And what was the answer
() 84
: don't know
Well,  don't either
They stare at the water - charred, quotidian household objects rolling back and forth in the surf
Can  go swimming
Swimming
You'll freeze your nuts off
know
don't want to have to come in after you
The  lets the blanket fall and strips out of his parka and clothes
He runs along the beach naked, skinny and white, leaping  into the icy surf
The  watches until the  comes out of the water, gasping with cold, shuddering
He wraps the  in the blanket and dries him off
- ( 16) - The  is wrapped in blankets by the fire as flickers in the distance, illuminating the empty beach
The drapes another blanket over them
He puts his arms around the  who is shivering and sweating, looking a little wild eyed, babbling a little
How many people do you think are still alive
In the world
don't know
Not very many
There could be people alive someplace else
Besides on earth
() 85
: don't think so
They couldn't live any place else
Not even if they could get there
If they had a-a-a spaceship
No
It's unlikely
The  stares, shivering, thinking
(') Are you all right
What is it
He cups his hand to the babbling 's forehead
don't feel so good
The  bends away and vomits and the  helps, rubbing his back and wiping the 's mouth when he's done
(') 'm sorry
That's okay, you didn't do anything wrong
The  is very worried now

It's okay
You're going to be okay
It'll pass
Don't leave me here, don't go away Papa
Not even for a minute
won't go away

He sits holding the  tightly
He feels for the 's heart
() 86
: He drops droplets of sugar water from a bowl into the 's mouth
As the  shuts his eyes and dozes he checks the pulse at his neck and wipes his mouth with the blanket
- ( 16) - The  is sleeping fitfully across the 's lap - he is still awake, staring in horror as the  sweats and shakes in his sleep
He wipes the 's brow, looks up-to the : Oh no
No no
Not this
Jesus Christ what have you done to us
What have you done
- ( 16) - The  is fast asleep, motionless but for stertorous breathing through his mouth
The  lies beside him, just staring at him, watching him sleep
The  opens his eyes and focuses weakly
Hi Papa
'm right here
know
The  shuts his eyes and goes back to sleep
The strokes the 's hair tenderly, takes the pistol from his belt and carefully hides the pistol under the blanket by the boy's side
He stands, takes one last look and walks away
/ - The  is alone now, staring at the hull of a wrecked boat keeled over in ten feet of gray water a few yards out from the spit - a sixty footer, twin masts
Closer to shore, in the shallows between the boat and the sand is a grey, lifeless form
The man steps closer and sees: - bobbing about in the tide, the bloated, rotting cadaver of a giant squid, eyes like dinner plates, translucent grey skin like an old light bulb
The  eyes it uneasily, then starts stripping off his clothes
He stares anxiously into the darkly roiling water near the boat
() 87
: He looks back along the beach to the distant figure of the , sitting up wrapped in his blankets, looking around, confused and scared, enough to make the  wince
He collects himself and wades cautiously into the gray soupy water
He takes a breath and starts swimming to the boat
- ( 16) - The  is confused as he watches: - the  swimming away
: - ( 16) - - over the shoulder of a mystery third person, camera pushes in slightly on the  sleeping
- ( 16) - 's feet enters the scene behind the boy, carefully walks in close around the boy
The 's long  drops into the scene, held at the figure's side
The  senses the  and wakes up to see: - a dark, hunched  standing over him
The  looks up at the  and, whatever it is, he's terrified
The  , terrified, scrambling away, tripping over pots and pans by the fire, he gets to his feet and runs
- The  struggles from the water and scans the beach, no sign of the
He dumps a medical kit and flare pistol he's found on the boat and heads for the sand dunes
- ( 16) - The  runs over the sand and reaches the spot where he left the , the blue tarp blowing away across the beach, the campsite and campfire disturbed
He runs up the dunes
- - as he looks back he glimpses ragged  rushing through the sand after him, a pair of hands reaching out
() 88
: - he catches up with the , grabs his shoulder with one hand and the gun with the other
- the  sees it's the  and stops, stares, still frightened, feverish, wild-eyed, confused
It's okay - man
There was a man
saw a man
It's okay, he's gone now, it's just me
The  collapses, exhausted, into the 's arms
- ( 16) - The  and the  return to examine the disturbed campsite
Oh Christ
You stupid ass
You stupid ass
What happened
He stole our shoes
He stole everything
The  goes quiet, forlorn, staring around at the desolation in despair
(') What's wrong
don't know what we're doing
Come here
don't know why we're doing this
() 89
: Look, there are
(  , ) There are people
there are other people and we'll find them
You'll see
The  just shuts his eyes and slumps onto the sand in despair
The  eyes him anxiously
(') Please
Listen to me
Don't lose heart
The  seizes the  , takes it from its case hurriedly, loads it with shells - the  now watches, wide- eyed
The  rushes a few paces up the  and looks over to where the trolley was hidden - he fires a  into the air
The  arcs up into the murk with a long  and breaks in a cloud of light, hanging there, hot tendrils of magnesium drifting down to the sand
The  watches, curious despite his despair
The  strains his eyes to see: the dunes bathed in pink light from the flare and the sand pock-marked with the footprints of the   in a trail leading to the spot where the trolley
The trolley marks trail off into the distance
- - from a distance, a third party is watching the and  bathed in the light of the flare
pushes in on the  watching them - bearded and scarred with a wandering eye and a crushed cheekbone, a veteran of many skirmishes
- The  and the  stand in their bare feet
Come on
We have to get our shoes back
(,
) We don't need them
We won't get far without them
() 90
: They set off hurriedly, in their bare feet
,   - On the road in the middle of a desolate landscape, the light is dying, the strange lattice of lightning flickering across the sky, the  and the  are barefoot on the tarmac
- way up ahead is the hunched  seen earlier - the , his back to us, trundling the loaded trolley along the road
Come on
They take off after the thief, bare feet thudding on the tarmac, the  in front, the  trailing, trying to catch up
The  looks back at them and speeds up, head bent down over the handle running for his life
When he looks back again the  has drawn his pistol and is aiming it directly at him
The  stops the trolley, pulls a carving knife from his belt, and turns to face them, standing behind the trolley
His face is emaciated and twitchy, a mouth like a bombed grave yard - not the  of the man watching them in the sand dunes
The  trains his gun on him, stock still, holding the 's hand
(') Get away from the cart and put the knife down
The  spits and brandishes the knife desperately, he's scrawny, sullen, bearded and filthy
(') If you don't put down the carving knife and get away from the godamn cart 'm going to blow your brains out
Papa
Be quiet
The  cocks the pistol and there's two loud
(') God damn you
() 91
: Papa please don't kill the man
Come on man,  done what you said, listen to the boy
The  starts crying - the  looks at the  and then the angry , this seems to be sobering
He puts the knife in the trolley and steps away, hands in the air, his thumbs are missing
How long have you been following us
wasn't following you
saw the cart on the sand an'  just took it
Please Papa
Take your clothes off
Take them off, every godamn stitch
Come on man, don't do this
'll kill you where you stand
Don't do this, man
won't tell you again
All right, all right, just take it easy
The  looks at the  who is now covering his ears and the  takes an intimidating step closer with the gun
The  starts stripping and piling his rags in the road
The shoes
() 92 : (2) Come on man
The shoes
He sits naked in the road and unlaces the rotting shoes
(') Put them in the cart
The  stands and drops the shoes in the trolley
(') Put the clothes in
The  drops the clothes in and stands there covering himself, shivering
Don't do me like this, man
You don't need to do me like this
You didn't mind doing it to us
'm begging you
Papa
Come on, listen to the kid
You tried to kill us
'm starving man
You'd have done the same
You took everything
'll die out here
'm going to leave you the way you left us
() 93 : (3) The  grabs the trolley by the handle, pulls it around, puts the pistol on top and holds his hand out for the
(') Let's go
The  doesn't take his hand but they set off along the blacktop, the  snivelling and crying, leaving the shivering and whimpering
Oh papa
Stop it
can't stop it
What do you think would have happened to him if we hadn't caught him
You've got to learn
don't want to learn
won't be here forever
Sooner or later you'll have to look after yourself
The  just looks at him - and keeps crying
/,   - Some distance away the  looks back at the , still crying
You have to stop crying
can't
The  looks back one last time as the  disappears from view - still just standing there, utterly lost
The  stops and puts his shoes on
He walks back up the road to the bend but the  has gone
() 94
: He's gone
Come on
He's not gone
He's not
The  looks helplessly at the tearful  as he fits his shoes on for him, the tears streaking the soot on his face
What do you want to do
Just help him, Papa
Just help him
The  looks back down the road, weighing it up
(') He was just hungry Papa
He's going to die
He's going to die anyway
He's so scared
'm scared
Do you understand
'm scared
The  tries to look the  in the eye but he keeps his head bowed, sobbing
(') You're not the one who has to worry about everything
The  mumbles, tearful and snotty
(') What
What did you say
Yes  am
am the one
The  stops and faces-the innocent  angrily, stares, then relenting, summons all his strength, turns the trolley around and they start wheeling it back the way they came
All right
Help me
() 95
: (2) The  takes the 's hand and puts it on the trolley handle
/,   - As the light fades to darkness they look for the  to give him his clothes back and call out "Hallo
" Etc
After a moment they stop
He's afraid to answer
Is this where we stopped
don't know
think so
They keep walking, hands cupped to mouths, hallooing mindlessly
The  stops to rest and watches the  a moment, he has stopped crying as he calls out for the thief
Finally the  piles the 's shoes and clothes in the road
He puts a rock on top of them
Come on
We have to go
The  eyes the clothes sadly, silent now
,   - They find a spot to stop and sit, exhausted
The  opens the first aid kit he took from the boat, selects various pills, crushes them up, pours a cup of water from a ferry can in the trolley, and hands them to the
don't want it
have to get your temperature down
The  swallows the pills and the water, shivering
-
Can  ask you something
Of course you can
() 96
: What would you do if  died
If you died 'd want to die too
So you could be with me
So  could be with you, yes
But that's not going to happen
They look at each other a moment, unsure, the  shivering and sick-looking
The  lies down and shuts his eyes
The puts a blanket over him
The  walks away a few paces and coughs endlessly, a nagging cough that won't go
- '  - a dream and a memory of an early summer day, the  and the  are in an orchard, lying in the sun on a picnic blanket, an array of food, bread, fruit and wine beside them
The  lies back and the  cradles his head in her lap, stroking his brow
She brings her face down and gently plants a simple kiss on each of his eyelids, then on each of his lips
- the 's face, smiling a dazzling, radiant smile, framed by sunlight and the indistinct shapes of leaves and blossom and petals against the sky - to him she is angelic
Then he kisses her on each eye and on the lips too - their ritual caress
,   - The  awakes distressed, he wipes a tear, blinks in confusion
- the  is kneeling beside him, watching him calmly, no longer sweating and shivering, recovered
Papa
The  rouses himself, sits up and just stares at the , amazed, as if he has arisen from the grave How are you feeling
() 97
: feel kind of weird
Are you hungry
Just thirsty
The  gets up and fetches water from a ferry can in the trolley, pours a cup, hands it to the  who drinks thirstily
The  reaches out and strokes the 's hair as he drinks
,  - The  and the  head towards a seaside town off in the distance
- They enter a small beach resort with a faded "Welcome" sign across the road, the  holding the 's hand now
/'  - They are down by the water
Small pleasure boats are half sunken in the grey water
Faded colored bunting and painted signs advertise  ,  and a
The helps the man push the trolley through the sand until they can go no further, they stop and drop onto the sand, exhausted
Can  tell you something
Yes
You tell me  shouldn't cry but 've heard you crying
hear you coughing and crying to yourself in the night when you think 'm asleep
What of it
So if  shouldn't cry you shouldn't cry either
() 98
: They look at each other
- On the port side of town the  wheels the trolley through the deserted docks past rotten piers, a row of empty wooden warehouses and a rusty red tanker washed up
He is and the sound echoes off the warehouse walls
The  is trailing a few paces behind, they're not speaking now
- As they pass the last of a row of deserted warehouses the slows down to let the  catch up
But the  is now studying the ground intently
He bends down and picks up: - an old cardboard match box, it's decals faded
He pushes the match box open to reveal a perfectly preserved Beetle
What is it
It's a Beetle
Suddenly the beetle twitches, then activates its wings and flies out of the box with a  and upwards into the sky
The  and the  stare up at the flying creature, amazed : Without warning something  over their heads very close and hits the wall beside them with a loud
The lunges at the , landing on top of him to cover him and tries to grab the trolley which tips over, spilling everything out
The  desperately tries to take cover while he looks over his shoulder and sees: - in the upper window of a warehouse a man is drawing a bow and arrow aimed right at them
In desperation the  covers the  and tries to scrabble away but there's a   of bowstring and an arrow into his leg
(') Oh you bastard
You bastard
() 99
: The  claws the blankets from the upturned trolley aside and scrabbles around for the pistol but it has fallen from his belt onto the cobbles and scattered out of reach
He spots the flare gun and seizes it, resting it on the trolley and aiming carefully at the empty window
When the lone appears again he squeezes off a shot and the flare goes rocketing up towards the window in a firey arc, ablaze with color, clean through the window
They can hear the inside and see the colored light still flaring from the window
Oh Papa
Stay just like you are
He gets up and runs limping across the street, the arrow still embedded in his leg
- He limps up the stairs of the old warehouse as quickly as he can, flare gun at the ready, arrow in his leg
- He bursts into the main room and trains the gun
At the far end a  is sitting with the prone form of the
The floor is burnt in a huge patch left by the flare and is still in flames
'
You son of a bitch
Who else is up here
'
You fucking asshole
The  looks down, his leg is bleeding heavily now and the arrow is still sticking out
Where's the bow
'
don't have it
Why are you following us
() 100
: '
We're not following anybody
You were following us
The  stares at the , looking her up and down, she looks sick and thin and desperate
He looks at the , lying there dead, his chest and one arm and his face burnt, still smoking
The  covers his face with the blanket and the  doesn't know what to say, ashamed
He goes
- - again from a distance, as if a third party is watching, we watch the  and the  hobble into a
- One wall of the  is merely a pile of rubble, opening out to the sea
The opposite wall is a photographic mural of lush green woods
The  tries to pull the arrow out but just pulls the wooden stem out
He takes off his bloodied trousers and examines the gaping wound with a flap of flesh and the arrow head, made from a , buried inside
See if you can find the medical kit from the boat
Quickly
The  rummages in the trolley, finds the kit and hands it over
He stares as the  slowly extracts the spoon, wincing in agony
The  dowses the wound in antiseptic from the kit and searches through the kit for a needle
He finds a suture needle in a sterile envelope, rips it open with his teeth and, using the light coming in through the parlour windows he threads some silk thread into the needle
He starts to suture up the wound, grimacing in pain as the  watches in silence, until eventually offering: Does it hurt
The  just looks at him in disbelief - beat
Yes
It hurts
What does it feel like
The  eyes the , amazed at this inopportune chat
() 101
: At least you're talking to me now
/
- ( 17) - They have a campfire in the cafe by the jetty and sit overlooking the bay, through the missing wall, silent until: Do you want me to tell you a story
No
Why not
Your stories aren't true
They don't have to be true
They're stories
In the stories we're always helping people
But we don't help people
We just shoot people
And in the stories good things happen but we just get sick
The  thinks about it - stuck for an answer
We're still here aren't we
Doesn't that mean anything
- The  pulls the trolley slowly, finding it a great effort
The  helps pull, eying the  with concern
The  stops and rests on the trolley and the  pulls on a few more feet then stops and looks back as the   for a long painful moment
He takes the bloodstained surgical mask from his face, his breath foggy in the cold, he wrings out the blood and saliva, puts his head between his knees and coughs until he can cough no more, gasping for breathe, bloody drool unspooling from his lips into the sand like scarlet twine while the  watches, weeping silently
() 102
: We have to leave the cart
can't push it anymore
- They are trudging along a concrete boat ramp by the beach road, the beach below, the  carrying a small-suitcase now, the  carrying sacks and bags
They stop and the  leans, impossibly breathless, his lungs packing up
They stop at the water edge, where the road reaches the sea
The  takes his hand gently
What are we going to do Papa
The  can't answer for breathlessness
(') Well, what are we
The  sits heavily on the ground, totters as the  stands watching him, eyes welling with tears
(') Oh no, Papa
/ -( 18) - The  is drifting in and out of consciousness in the sand
The  comes over with a cup of water and holds it to the 's lips, he drinks
The  has also lit a fire
He spreads out blankets
Don't get comfortable
You need to keep going
You don't know what might be down the road
No
We were always lucky
You'll be lucky again
You'll see
Just go
No
can't
() 103
: It's all right
This has been a long time coming
Just keep going south
Do everything the way we did it
No
You're going to be okay Papa
You have to
Keep the gun with you at all times
Don't let anyone take it from you
You need to find the good guys but you can't take any chances
Do you hear me
want to be with you
want to be with you too but can't
Please
You have to go off on your own now
You have to carry the fire
don't know how to
Yes you do
You know everything about it
Is it real
The fire
Papa
Yes it is
Where is it
don't know where it is
Yes you do
() 104
: (2) Where
It's inside you
It was always there
can see it
The  stares at him, not sure what to believe
(') You have to let me go
Just take me with you please
Please, Papa
What should  do
Just hold my hand
The  grips the 's hand, bouncing up and down, agitated
You said you wouldn't ever leave me
know
'm sorry
The  falls on the , hugging him tight, face pressed to his chest, sobbing
(') My boy
You have my whole heart
You always did
You're the best guy
You can talk to me and 'll talk to you
You'll see
How will  hear you
You just will
How do you know
-
You just have to practice
Just don't give up okay
You'll be okay
You're going to be lucky
know you are
() 105
: (3) The  closes his eyes and takes deep, rattling breaths
It's okay Papa
You don't have to talk anymore
Camera pulls back and the  is sitting with the  saying nothing
It's starting to grow dark
The  crouches down on the 's chest and goes to sleep there, rising and falling with his father's breathing
/ ( 18) - Darkness all around, the  is lying across the , his hand rising and falling on the 's chest slowly, irregularly as the 's breath rattles in his lungs
/ - - or the ' last ever dream: The  and the snooze in the car - an ordinary young couple nestled together in the early morning sun light
The  wakes and looks at his sleeping wife, smooths her hair tenderly, very much in love, as she sleeps
His hand on her wakes her, she looks at him surprised and pleased, smiles
Hello
She kisses him and they look at the blue ocean and the white sand and green sea grass and she puts an arm around him
(
) If  were God  would have made the world just so and no different
And so  have you
have you
/ - ( 18) The  is awake but doesn't move, his hand still on the 's chest, now motionless
He looks at the  who is cold and stiff now, long dead
The  gets up and holds the 's cold stiff hand
Tears course down his face silently
Oh Papa
Papa
Papa
106
/ - ( 18) The  is building a campfire
He lights it and sits there watching the 's motionless body
/ -( 19) The  has slept beside the , he wakes, blinks, bewildered
/ - ( 18) - The  is zipping up the 's parka carefully and heaping blankets on top, talking all the while
Can  tell you something
had a bad dream
had this penguin that you wound up and it would waddle and flap its flippers
And we were in that house we used to live in and it came around the corner but nobody had wound it up and it was really scary because-because- because
He goes quiet as he finishes tending to the body and puts his own parka on, zips it up
(') The winder wasn't turning
He takes the gun, checks the magazine, shuts it and stands, shoving the pistol in his belt
' ,   - The  is standing at the water's edge looking out at the smog and the emptiness
Out of nowhere a man in a gray and red ski parka with the hood up appears carrying a shotgun over his shoulder and a belt of shells
He goes over to the , he is the same bearded and scarred man seen earlier, watching them in the sand dunes
The doesn't flinch, but his hand goes to the gun at his side
When the man speaks he has some sort of speech defect, possibly caused by missing teeth
Where's the man you were with
( ) Was he your father
() 107
: Yes
He was my Papa
'm sorry
don't know what to do
Well,  think maybe you should come with me
The 's finger tightens on the trigger of the
Are you one of the good guys
Yeah
'm one of the good guys
Why don't you put that pistol away
'm not supposed to let anybody take the pistol
No matter what
don't want your pistol
just didn't want you pointing it at me
The  lowers the gun to his side and the  comes a few steps closer, causing the  to back up a step
(') Where's your stuff
don't have much stuff
What have you got
Blankets
My Papa's wrapped in them
Show me
The  doesn't move
The  holds out his hand for the to take, the  sees he has a   and hesitates, wary
The  squats, leaning on his shotgun
() 108
: (2) Look
You got two choices here
You can stay here with your papa or you can go with me
If you stay you need to keep off the road
How do  know you're one of the good guys
You don't
You'll have to take a shot
The  weighs it up, eyeing the
Do you have any kids
Yes we do
Do you have a little boy
We have a little boy and a little girl
How old is he
He's about your age
Maybe a little older
And you didn't eat them
No
You don't eat people
No
We don't eat people
Are you carrying the fire
() 109
: (3) Am  what
Carrying the fire
You're kind of weirded out, aren't you, kid
Well, are you
Yeah
am
'm carrying the fire
And  can go with you
Yes, you can
The  hesitates
/ - They go over to where the  lies dead and the squats and lifts a blanket to take a look
Are these all the blankets you have
Yes
Is that your suitcase
Yes
The  stands and studies the
Why don't you go up onto the road and wait for me
'll bring the blankets
What about my Papa
() 110
: What about him
We can't just leave him here
Yes we can
don't want people to see him
There's nobody to see him
Can  cover him in leaves
The wind will blow them away
Could we cover him with one of the blankets
Okay
'll do it
Go on now
,  - The  waits and in a moment the  emerges from the dunes carrying the suitcase with the blankets slung over his shoulder
He sorts through them and hands one to the
Here
Wrap this around you
You're cold
The  eye the blanket uncertainly, holds out the pistol for the  to hold
(') You hold onto that
Okay
Do you know how to shoot it
Yes
() : Okay
What about my papa
There's nothing else to be done
think  want to say goodbye to him
Will you be all right
Yes
Go ahead
'll wait here for you
The  turns around and heads down to the beach
/ - ( 18) - The  trudges through the sand over to the corpse of the which is now neatly wrapped up in a blanket from head to toe
The  kneels beside him and starts to cry silently and whisper
'll talk to you every day
And won't forget
No matter what
No matter what, Papa
The  dries his eyes, takes a breath, gets up and walks back to the road
, - As the  walks out of the dunes holding the gun, a who is standing with the  comes towards him
Oh
am so glad to see you
The  just stares at her, bemused - a short distance away stands the rest of the family - a  his age and a
The stares at the   and recognizes him - it's the same  he chased earlier
() 112
: Then the  notices a threadbare mongrel of a , waiting with them
The   goes over and puts her arms around him
(') We've been following you
Did you know that
We saw you with your Papa and we tried to catch up but you were too quick for us
There was some discussion about whether to even come after you at all
As she's chatting, the   gently takes the gun from the  and hands it to the
We're so lucky
We were so worried about you
And now we don't have to worry about a thing
She kisses the  on the forehead and holds him at arm's length and looks at him
(') How does that sound
Is that okay
He stares but says nothing
