Written by John Irving Production Draft ' -   - An establishing shot of the rundown train station on an overcast morning
There's snow on the station platform train arrives and departs
(
) In other parts of the world, young men of promise leave home to make their fortunes, battle evil, or solve the problems of the world
Behind the station, at the top of the hill, lies the St
Cloud's orphanage
(
) was myself such a young man, when came to save the orphanage in St
Cloud's
many years ago
' -  - man and woman ( #1) make their way toward the main entrance of the large brick building
(
) Here in St
Cloud's,  have come to understand that promises are rarely kept, that the battle isn't so much against evil as ignorance, and that being successful can't hold a candle to being of *use*
The couple enters the orphanage, where we hear the sound of babies
(
) Nor have  solved the problem  came here to solve
- Two nurses,  and , chase --a morning routine
(
) Even in the most enlightened times, unwanted babies will manage to be born
That there will always be orphans is simple not a problem to be solved
Here is St
Cloud's, we don't regard the sordid facts of life as problems
The camera goes up the stairs with some of the kids
'  - We enter an office where
shows couple #1 their newly adopted son, , an infant who lies smiling in Dr
Larch's arms
(
) In truth, we've only had one real problem
We close in on the infant until his face fills the screen
(
) His name was Homer Wells
Dr
Larch hands over the infant to the adopting parents
named him after the Greek writer
You know Homer, of course
Hesitant nods
(They don't look as if they read
) made his name "Wells" because could tell he was very deep
The parents look with pride at their adopted son
(
) In truth, Nurse Angela named him-- her father *drilled* wells, and "Homer" was one of her family's umpteen cats
/
- At the front door, Larch and the nurses wave and call good- bye to Homer, they close the door
/
- The same door swings open; it's another night
The same couple is bringing Homer back
There is concern in their faces as Nurse Edna lets them in
' ,  - Larch is delivering his benediction to the boys
"Good night, you Princes of Maine, you Kings of New England
" As he turns, he is startled by Nurse Edna, waiting with couple #1 and baby Homer
There's something wrong with him
He never makes a sound
Larch looks quickly at Homer
(
) He didn't cry enough for them, if you can believe it
Do you think we could have a look at someone a little different
The mother hands over the baby to Larch
Baby Homer lets out a happy squeal as soon as he's in Larch's arms
The parents stare in disbelief
(
) Thus was Homer Wells returned
He was too happy a baby
- Angela and Edna call and wave good-bye to a two-year-old Homer, leaving with  #2
Larch stands on the porch and watches the family head down the hill
(
) The second family has an unfortunate gift for getting sounds out of Homer
#2'  - Larch bursts into the home of the second couple and lifts a crying and bruised Homer out of his bed
There is rage in Larch's eyes as he looks at the couple
(
) The rumor was true
They beat him
He couldn't stop crying
,
' - Larch carries Homer up the orphanage hill
(
) Here is St
Cloud's,  try to consider, with each rule  make or break, that my first priority is an orphan's future
- The naked belly of a
(
) Easier said than done
tiny hand comes in with a stethoscope and puts it on the big belly
Young Homer's head, with the stethoscope around his neck, pops up behind the belly; he closes his eyes as he concentrates on listening to the sounds of the unborn child
Larch stops in the doorway, catching sight of Homer
He smiles faintly
#3'  - The door opens to a   smiling at us, welcoming and embracing a sixteen-year-old Homer
Behind them waits the would-be --an attractive girl, a little older then Homer
(
) told the third family to take good care--this was a special boy
'  - Homer and the stepsister are in bed together
The parents burst in on them--the father chasing Homer around and around the bed, the mother beating her daughter, who covers herself with a pillow
(
) It was Homer who took too much good care of himself
#3'  - From her window, the stepsister watches Homer leave the house carrying his suitcase
Homer looks up at her as he walks to the street
- It's after dawn, but still a little dark, as Homer walks to the orphanage door, suitcase in hand arrives at the same time
They stand awkwardly next to each other, waiting for someone to answer the door
The woman is crying
Homer reaches out and takes her hand
Don't be frightened
Everyone is nice here
Do you live here
just belong here
The woman sniffles; she nods vaguely
The door opens
Nurse Edna lets the woman in and embraces Homer
(
) What could  do with him
He kept coming back
'  - Larch instructs an older Homer from "Gray's Anatomy
" Homer is bored and looks out the window
Homer, if you're going to stay at St
Cloud's,  expect you to be of use
- Homer looks adoringly at Dr
Larch as Larch examines Larch waves Homer over; he places the boy's hand on the woman's abdomen, to feel the fetus kicking
(
) But, in failing to withhold love, had  created a true and everlasting orphan
had been too successful with Homer Wells
had managed to make the orphanage his *home*
- Larch closes a door quickly behind him (so that Homer doesn't see the   in the
) - Homer assists Larch in delivering a
- Homer carries a white enamel pail to the incinerator
He looks inside the pail; he stops
(
) God forgive me
have *made* an orphan by loving him too much
Homer Wells will belong to St
Cloud's, forever
Hold on Homer's disgusted expression as he stares at the contents of the pail
We hear a song playing on an old phonograph
- We see the song playing on the old phonograph
Dr
Larch is taking ether
He holds the bottle in one hand, the cone over his mouth and nose with the other
:
', ,  1943
When Larch dozes off, his hand loosens its grip on the cone; the cone falls off his face, and he wakes up
Then he puts the cone back in place, dripping more ether from the bottle to the gauze covering the cone
Pan the dispensary, which also serves as Larch's photo gallery and bedroom apartment
The ether-bed is separated from the room by a hospital curtain (the kind on casters)
We see the recording revolving, the glass-encased cabinets of medical supplies, the old photographs of St
Cloud's
Homer enters, he stands uncomfortably, watching Larch for a moment
Then he turns around and walks back into the corridor
- Homer calls out as though he's just coming down the corridor
Dr
Larch
Dr
Larch
- Larch wakes up; he shakes off the ether haze
Homer reenters
We've got two new patients, one to deliver
Dr
Larch and Homer leave together
- The *two* doctors walk briskly down the hall, a couple of professionals
First pregnancy
Yes, for both
(sarcastically) presume you'd prefer handling the delivery
(tiredly; an old topic) All  said was,  don't want to perform abortions
have no argument with *you* performing them
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else
One: it's illegal
Two:  didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me
What *else* could  have showed you, Homer
The only thing  can teach you is what  know
In every life, you've got to be of use
Homer and Larch split off and disappear into two different operating rooms
As he goes, Homer mumbles to himself, "Of use, of use, of use
" - Larch and Angela are preparing the ether for , a not visibly pregnant woman
The sounds of labor across the hall can be heard Over
(holds the cone) Have you ever had ether, Dorothy
Once, when they took out my appendix
(looks for scar) No one's touched your appendix
Whatever it was
the ether made me sick
It won't make you sick this time, Dorothy--not the way  do it, just a drop at a time
can't pay for this, you know-- got no money
One day, Dorothy, if you have any money, a donation to the orphanage would be very much appreciated
Only if you can afford it
(holds the ether bottle) Try to think of nothing, Dorothy
Angela puts the cone over Dorothy's mouth and nose; Larch drips the ether on the cone
newborn wails in the other Over
- Homer has delivered
newborn baby is screaming in Edna's arms
Homer is attending to Carla, who is panting
That was good, Carla--that was *perfect*
Everything's fine
don't wanna see it
You don't have to see it, dear
Don't worry
don't even wanna know what sex it is--don't tell me
We won't tell you, Carla
You're going to be okay
Your *baby's* going to be okay, too
don't wanna know
Larch pops into the delivery room; he peers at the baby
He's a big boy
Let me see him, for Christ's sake-- wanna see him
Edna shows the baby to Carla, who stares, then turns away
Larch whispers to Homer
Would you mind having a look at Dorothy
- Angela sits with the still-etherized Dorothy while Larch and Homer confer over a basin containing Dorothy's uterus
There was no visible wound
No
The fetus was dead
Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue
(mystified) It looks like scurvy
(derisively sarcastic) Scurvy
Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables
Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*
She's a prostitute, isn't she
(to Angela) Did you look in her purse
(frustrated) looked everywhere else
Angela hands Larch a bottle of brown liquid
It's called French Lunar Solution
Larch wrinkles his nose at the odor
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue
It claims to restore monthly regularity
It's obviously an aborticide
Obviously
Larch wets his finger with the stuff, then touches it to his tongue
(spits) Christ, it's oil of tansy
don't know it
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin
In other words, scurvy
Good boy
Good job
And you call yourself "not a doctor"
(to Angela) Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble
As Homer turns to leave, Larch stops him; he points to the basin
Take care of that, will you
Homer stops, annoyed; he picks up the basin and empties the contents into a white enamel pail
- is teaching math to some distracted boys and girls in a corner of the dining room
blackboard on wheels is a mass of numbers
Homer, passing through the dining room with the white enamel pail, attracts the attention of , a sixteen-year-old who is picking over a plate of pastries on a table
Buster immediately goes with Homer
'll help you
Homer shakes his head, keeps walking
Buster follows
Dr
Larch passes close to Buster
Buster makes a face, disgusted
- Buster and Homer tramp through the snow toward the incinerator
Homer still carries the pail
He *sniffs* that ether
've seen him do it
It's because he's too tired to sleep
He has to
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether
'm *not* a doctor
haven't been to medical school-- haven't even been to high school
But you've studied with the old man for *years*
'm *not* a doctor
'm sorry, Homer
Buster stands watching as Homer empties the pail into the incinerator
- With his head inclined to the giant ear of Larch's phonograph, --six, thin, and pale and looking remarkably like an embryo--is listening to a recording
He can't hear what Larch and Homer are saying about him as they construct a humidified tent over a small hospital bed on wheels
The humidifier is operated by a car battery
Fuzzy is not uncommon
tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers
They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along
haven't read that
haven't, either
But you *will*
The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*
But isn't Fuzzy just
well, underdeveloped
When *doesn't* he have bronchitis wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped
" Would you
Larch plucks Fuzzy from in front of the phonograph and zips him into the breathing tent
Fuzzy smiles
As larch leaves, , a pretty but tough-looking teenager, comes into the dispensary
What is it, Mary Agnes
Mary Agnes smiles at Homer; then she sticks her tongue out at him
Homer looks at her impassively, but as the moment continues his expression suggests his annoyance
Fuzzy starts to cough; he wheezes as he breathes
Homer leans down; he peers at Fuzzy through a hole by the zipper of the tent
(garbled because of her tongue) Look
Homer examines Mary Agnes' tongue
Did you bite it
don't remember
(dismissively) It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right
Maybe  was kissing someone and he bit me
(looks at her tongue again) No, you did it yourself
Maybe in your sleep
must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone
Homer is not responding to her come-on
He wheels Fuzzy into the hall
Story time, Fuzzy
'  - In the girls' bunk room, Nurse Edna is saying prayers
The girls lie with their palms pressed together on their chests
"Oh Lord, support us all the day long
" ' -   - The building of St
Cloud's is silhouetted against the sky
Carla, the woman we saw deliver the baby, is heading down the hill alone, she sobs, not looking back
(
) "
until the shadows lengthen and the evening comes, and the busy world is hushed, and the fever of life is over, and our work is done
" '  - In the bunk room again, with Edna and the girls
"Then in Thy mercy grant us save lodging, and holy rest, and peace at the last
" Amen
Amen
Amen
'  - Dr
Larch is reading from Oliver Twist--the death scene of Bill Sike's dog
The boys listen in horror in their beds
" dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring, jumped for the dead man's shoulders
" Homer enters; he walks quietly to his bed in the far corner of the room, where he starts to undress
"Missing his aim, he fell into a ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head against a stone, dashed his brains out
Larch turns out the lights
From the open doorway to the hall, Larch delivers his nightly benediction
Good night, you Princes of Maine
You Kings of New England
Larch closes the door, leaving them in the semi-darkness
One young boy runs into Homer's bed, nervously giggling
(in his breathing tent) Why does Dr
Larch *do* tht every night
(about seven) Maybe to scare us
(about eleven) No, you jerk
(about nine) Dr
Larch *loves* us
But why does he do *that*
He does it because we like it
The boys silently agree, Homer among them
' - The girls, led by Mary Agnes, round a corner of the orphanage, towing a sled piled high with snowballs
Buster is mine
You two get Copperfield and Curly
Nobody touches Fuzzy
They shriek as the boys suddenly surprise them
Buster throws two hard snowballs that hit Mary Agnes and  (eight or nine) before Mary Agnes overwhelms him and repeatedly sticks his head in the snow
Copperfield, terrified of Mary Agnes, escapes
Curly misses, then tips over the sled of snowballs as Clara and the adorable  (five or six) throw him to the ground
Fuzzy drops his one snowball; he runs aimlessly in circles, coughing, as Nurse Edna explodes from a door of the orphanage
Stop it
No fighting
*Share* the snowballs
(mouth full of snow) They're *our* snowballs
They *stole* them
They attacked us--just like the Japs
Fuzzy coughs and wheezes, trying to catch his breath
Listen to you, Fuzzy
You've been running
You get to the shower
comes up the hill
The orphans stop and stare, brushing snow off themselves, struggling to make themselves look presentable
Curly is desperate to look his best
Mary Agnes doesn't bother to pretty herself
She whispers to Clara and Hazel
know the type--they'll take one of the babies
- The children are eating breakfast as the would-be parents walk around the tables, looking over the assembled orphans
Curly works on his table manners; he forks and eats a piece of pancake with elegance
Angela and Edna try to make the couple slow down by the older children, but the couple stop and stare at the adorable Hazel
- Larch and Homer are examining the babies
The doctors are checking the babies' grips, their eyes, ears, and throats
Angela appears in the doorway
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office
(irritated) Life is waiting
Angela disappears
Larch looks at the next baby's record (attached to the bed)
Where's the name sheet
Nobody's named this one yet
It's my turn
Homer is tired of this game
Larch touches the child's forehead with his index finger
Henceforth you shall be
Little Dorrit
The baby starts to cry
He doesn't like it
(looks at the record) He's a boy, That's why
Can't a boy be a Dorrit
don't think so
You do it then
Homer points his finger at the child's forehead like a gun
Henceforth you shall be
Little Wilbur
'm not crazy about the "Little
" Homer is writing the name
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we
We used to have *dozens*
They are interrupted by Copperfield, who comes running from the corridor
They picked Hazel
The idiots chose Hazel
'  - Hazel is being fussed over by Edna
Hazel clutches a cardboard suitcase and a tattered rag doll
Mary Agnes, by far the oldest, sits on a bed
If people want to adopt one of us, they should have to take the oldest first
Please, Mary Agnes
This is Hazel's special day--don't make her feel sad
Hazel's practically the youngest of us
She should be the *last* to leave
At least Hazel can talk
Usually they take one of the stupid babies
They take the babies so they won't ever have to tell them that they were orphans
(begins to cry) 'm not a baby
If you cry, Hazel, they'll just send you back
Mary Agnes, that's not true
Hazel cries harder
That's what they did to me
You *wanted* to come back--that's why you cried
(to Hazel) You can cry if you feel like it, Hazel
You cry as much as you want
'  - Homer is in the corridor outside the office, overhearing Larch's lecture to the couple adopting Hazel
It is strictly for our orphans' sake that  destroy any record of their natural mothers
Of course they will, one day, want to know
But orphans, especially, should look forward to their *futures*
Not back to their pasts
,  - Homer sees Curly standing all alone by a window in the corridor; a suitcase is next to him
Hi, Curly
You going somewhere
Curly shakes his head
thought they might take me
They wanted a girl
Nobody ever wants me
Homer embraces Curly and lifts him up, he grabs the suitcase and continues down the corridor
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you
Dr
Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us
That's true
Nobody's asked for me, have they
Nobody special enough, Curly
You mean somebody asked
Only the right people can have you, Curly
Homer disappears into the boys' bunk room carrying Curly and his suitcase, leaving the corridor empty
/
- Faces in the windows; the orphans watch Hazel walking across the snowy lawn with her new parents
'  - Edna (with the girls) gives her good-bye blessing to Hazel
Let us be happy for Hazel
Hazel has found a family
Good night, Hazel
Good night, Hazel
Good night, Hazel
Good night, Hazel
/
-   - The front door opens
The orphans excitedly run outside onto the green lawn, into the warm weather of spring
- Angela is singing along with the song on the phonograph, a more romantic song then before, which rouses Larch from his ether
He is grumpy, but she sings the song in his ear and won't give him back the ether cone; he rolls away from her, but she tickles him and bites his ear, coaxing him into a more playful mood
was dreaming about you
How beautiful you were
You weren't dreaming about me
was
Playfully, she slips out of his embrace
Then  wasn't beautiful
You were
You *are*
It was fantastic
It was just the ether, Wilbur
- Homer wheels a tray with glasses of water between the beds
stops him by her bed
Are you okay
Can  get you anything
No one but me ever put a hand on me, to feel that baby
Don't you want to touch it or put your ear down to it
Okay
Homer touches the woman's belly
Put your ear there
Go on
Homer cautiously lays his ear against her belly
You shouldn't have a baby if there's no one who wants to put his face right there
She holds Homer's head against her belly; she presses his face into her
She shuts her eyes
Homer's eyes stare widely
Dr
Larch stops in the doorway; he watches with concern
Stay right there
Right where you are
Stay right here
Right here
' -   - Homer at the train station, staring down the empty tracks
Buster is hanging around with him, kicking a rock
Do you ever think about leaving this place to go find them
Homer makes no response
As the train approaches, Homer and Buster go sit on a loading cart
They see the distraught woman (no longer pregnant) from Homer's experience of a few nights ago; she is leaving St
Cloud's without her baby, waiting for the approaching train
Her face is a mask
The gives her a hard look
mean your parents
know who you mean
think about leaving here, but not to find *them*
Why not
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do
Dr
Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela
Yeah
But sometimes  wish  could meet mine, anyway
What for, Buster
What would you do if you met them
Uh
'd like to show them that can cook, a little
You cook very well
And that  can drive a truck
(laughing) Better than  can
Sometimes  want to meet them so can kill them
Just sometimes
Buster is ashamed; he knows he's said the wrong thing
Homer, you know  would never kill anyone--you know  wouldn't
know
The slowly moving train has stopped
There are leaning out the windows
Buster turns to see Mary Agnes walking past the train--she's doing her best to look grown- up, sophisticated
One of the soldiers reaches out and gently tugs on  her hair
Mary Agnes is enraged; she spits at the soldier
think Mary Agnes could kill someone
doubt it
She's just an
Mary Agnes spits at *all* the soldiers
emotional girl
The soldiers roll up the windows as Mary Agnes improvises some verbal abuse
What's she so emotional about
(shrugs) don't know
She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she
Camera closes on Homer
- The orphans are watching King Kong, the part when the giant ape first captures the screaming Fay Wray
Intercut Kong with the orphans' rapt faces
Homer sits near the front, mesmerized by the film
Dr
Larch and Angela sit by the projector; Larch is reading a letter
Fuzzy points to the screen
(coughing) He thinks she's his *mother*
King Kong is undressing Fay Wray in the cave
He doesn't think she's his mother, Fuzzy
He does so
He *loves* her
How could she be his *mother*
Larch shakes the letter in front of Angela
(a harsh whisper) They want to replace me
The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me
(whispering back) They just want you to hire some new help
Some new *things* would be useful don't need any "new help
" The film breaks--to huge cries of disappointment from the orphans
Fuzzy coughs and coughs while Larch fumbles with the projector
Angela turns on the light while Larch squints at the broken film
The orphans are chanting, "Kong
Kong
" Homer
need you
Homer gets up and walks to the projector
thought you took care of this
It always breaks in the same place
It's your splice, isn't it
(angry) It's *your* splice
You blame me for everything
Larch abruptly lets go of the film
Angela, we need a new movie, a new projector, a new typewriter--*that's* what they should replace around here
Edna comes in; she speaks to Larch, then quickly leaves
We have a delivery
Imminent, in my estimation
Larch turns to Homer
Homer, would you get this one
Homer shifts his weight to the other foot; aggravated; he stands there
She's a patient, right
She should see a doctor
Homer and Larch stare at each other
(trying to stay calm) Homer, you are a skilled and gifted surgeon
You have near-prefect obstetrical and gynecological procedure
Homer is also trying to avoid a fight
just mean 'd rather fix the movie
Tonight
Larch can't hide his disappointment
Sure
Okay
You splice
'll deliver
It is an uneasy peace
'  -  () Homer is adjusting Fuzzy's breathing tent as the other boys climb into bed
Homer
doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right
That's why Kong loves her
Larch comes in and walks over to Homer and Fuzzy
Larch and Homer exchange a look
thought it was my turn
It is
'll get this
You go ahead
Homer sits down with 'David Copperfield
' There is quiet anticipation while Homer readies himself to read
(reading) "Whether  shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show
" Larch continues to adjust Fuzzy's breathing tent
" was a posthumous child
My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it
" (whispers to Larch) His father's dead, right
(whispering back) That's right, Fuzz
Close on Fuzzy
(
) (continues reading) "There is something strange to me, even now, in the reflection that he never saw me
" As Larch bends over Fuzzy to fix the breathing apparatus, Fuzzy whispers
Is *your* father dead
(nods, whispers) Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver
*Liver* killed him
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death
But did you know him
Barely
It hardly mattered that knew him
Did you know your mother better
(nods, still whispers) She's dead now, too
She was a nanny
What's a nanny do
She looks after other people's children
Did you grow up around here
No
She was an immigrant
What's an immigrant
Someone not from Maine
' - The orphanage in moonlight
Not a sound
' - The children are chasing a ball near the incinerator
---not one of the orphans--is lying next to the incinerator
Edna kneels by the strange girl, who cringes with fear
No one's going to hurt you, dear
Have you come to visit us
We have beds, you know
Have you had any breakfast
What's your name
The girl won't speak; when Edna touches the girl's forehead, she pulls back her hand in alarm
- Edna is holding the head of the frightened young girl
The girl is feverishly hot and whimpering; she keeps looking at her feet in the stirrups as if she's an animal caught in a trap
Larch and Homer stand on either side of her
Her temperature is a hundred and four
(very gently) How old are you, dear
Thirteen
The girl shakes her head
The pain stabs her again
Twelve
Are you twelve, dear
(the girl nods) You have to tell me how long you've been pregnant
(the girl freezes) Three months
Another stab of pain contorts the girl
Are you *four* months pregnant
The girl holds her breath while he examines her abdomen; Homer very delicately examines the girl's abdomen, too
(whispers to Larch) She's at least *five*
The girl goes rigid as Larch bends into position
Dear child, it won't hurt when look
'm just going to *look*
Homer assists Larch with the speculum
Tell me: you haven't done something to yourself, have you
-- It wasn't me
Did you go to someone else
-- He said he was a doctor
would never have stuck that inside me
Stuck *what* inside you
Homer holds the girl still--she is babbling on and on while Larch is examining her
-- It wasn't me
would never do no such thing
wouldn't stick that inside me
It wasn't me
Larch, his wild eye peering into the speculum, makes an audible gasp from the shock of what he sees inside the girl
Larch tells Homer to have a look
Larch then whispers something to Edna; she brings the ether bottle and cone quickly
Larch starts putting the cone in place, over the nose and mouth of the frightened girl
Homer bends to the speculum
(to the twelve-year- old) Listen, you've been very brave
'm going to put you to sleep--you won't feel it anymore
You've been brave enough
Homer stares into the speculum; he closes his eyes
The girl is resisting the ether, but her eyelids flutter closed
That's a heavy sedation
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation
The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object
think it's a crochet hook
Homer has pulled off his surgical mask
He leans over the scrub sink, splashing cold water on his face
(to Homer) If she'd come to you four months ago and asked you for a simple  and , what would you have decided to do
*Nothing*
*This* is what doing nothing gets you, Homer
It means that someone else is going to do the job--some moron who doesn't know *how*
Homer, furious, leaves the operating room
Edna lifts the girl's eyelids for Larch so that he can see how well under the ether she is
wish you'd come to *me*, dear child
You should have come to me, instead
- Homer storms down the hall, then stops, pulling off his white coat
Angry, pacing, he kicks at nothing
' -  - Buster and Homer are digging the pit
Larch paces by the coffin of the 12-year-old girl
What'd she die of
(inhales deeply) She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*
Buster nods, but he's totally bewildered
(to Homer) If you expect people to be responsible for their children, you have to give them the right to decide whether or not to *have* children
Wouldn't you agree
Buster doesn't get it
Homer has heard this too many times; he rolls his eyes
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with
How about this child
You expect *her* to be responsible
Homer looks away
didn't mean her
'm talking about
adults
(annoyed) You know who  mean
Larch studies him

'  -   - Buster is driving the old pickup truck, with the shovels and a wheelbarrow in the back
Larch and Homer are in the cab, they are being bounced all over the cab by Buster's wild driving
Larch looks at Homer; he stares at him with a curious smile
What
Larch says nothing
Homer gives him a look
(smiling) It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people
'm happy  amuse you
(to Homer) Try to look at it this way
What choice does Buster have
What are his options
Nobody will ever adopt him
(Buster considers this) Try to look at it *this* way
Buster and  are sitting right here beside you
We could have ended up in the incinerator
(Buster grins) Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point
Buster is distracted; he drives the truck into a ditch and it bounces around, missing a tree by an inch
He is up on the road again in a few seconds
Happy to be alive
guess so
They are all distracted by a luxurious convertible that overtakes them on the hill to the orphanage
The fast car is driven by a handsome man in the uniform of the Army Air Corps-- a
From the passenger seat, a smiles at them, rendering them speechless
- The luxurious convertible (now parked) has drawn all the orphans to it
The handsome young officer () and the beautiful young woman () stand confused by the car; they are surrounded by the curious orphans, with whom they are painfully self-conscious
They are overly friendly to the children as they are anxious of Larch and Homer and Buster (in their gravedigging attire), who are getting out of the truck
Nervously, Wally gives the children chocolates
So many children
Are they all orphans
Well, this *is* an orphanage
The kids climb into Wally's car
Oh, they're getting into the car
watch your fingers
Curly tugs on Candy's dress, staring up at her, his face already smeared with chocolate
'm the best
(sweetly) You are
(good with kids) The best
Wow
The best at *what*
'm the best one
Curly's nose is streaming snot
Candy kneels beside him and holds her handkerchief to his nose
Here, blow
Curly tries to talk while she's holding his nose
really *am* the best,  just have a cold
Blow
There,  bet that feels better
(sniffs) Yeah
The other orphans are dying with envy--Candy is so beautiful
(Some, like Buster, are torn between Candy and the car
) Curly, come here
(to Larch) *Tell* them
'm the one
Virtually all the orphans have climbed into Wally's car
(to Wally) 'm sorry
They're not used to seeing a car like this
It's okay-- don't mind
Larch, scowling, presents himself to the new couple
We brought some chocolates for the kids
(witheringly) Chocolates
How *thoughtful*
Larch picks up Curly and carries him toward the boys' division
'm the best
*Tell* them
You're the best, Curly
'  - Homer is seated in the desk chair
The impressive couple sit in front of him
So, Mrs
Candy
Candy Kendall
Wally jumps up to his feet to shake Homer's hand
Wally
Wally Worthington
Wally sits down
The three sit still for an awkward moment
(to Candy) How many months are you
(whispers) Two
Homer writes on a piece of paper
Candy and Wally exchange a worried look
So, now, uh
you're not
mean, do *you* do the-- No
Dr
Larch will be performing the procedure
(relieved) Ah, well
okay
Good
just wondered
Edna pokes her head in the door
Excuse me, Homer
Dr
Larch said this one is your turn
Edna quickly sees that all three of them have misunderstood her
Oh, dear--'m sorry
meant the circumcision
That boy you delivered on Tuesday
Sure
Fine
Have you prepped him
'll get started
Candy and Wally can't conceal how impressed they are with the young Homer
- Homer walks down the corridor, dressed in his operating gown, as the door to the
opens and Wally stumbles out, hurriedly opening a window
Wally breathes deeply to regain his composure
think it was the ether--the smell got to me
(pause) God
This is all my fault
Edna comes down the hall with a dirt-stained, crying Curly who's covering one eye
(over the din) Steerforth got into the pantry--he's eaten all the pie dough
(sobbing) He wasn't sharing it, either
He's down the hall, throwing up
Homer nods to Edna, who is marching off with Curly
Wally smiles at Homer
What kind of plane are you flying
-24 Liberator
Liberator
Have you enlisted
They wouldn't take me
'm Class -- 've got a heart defect
Really
Is it serious
No, it's not serious
'm just not supposed to get excited
You know-- no strain, no stress
try to keep calm all the time
Wally hears Homer's facetiousness--how tired he is of his heart condition
Oh, well
don't imagine there's any strain or stress around *here*
Homer appreciates the joke
The door to the operating room that Wally exited opens into the corridor; Candy is being wheeled out on a gurney by Larch and Angela
Wally rushes to Candy's side
Homer follows slowly
Candy is groggy, coming out of the ether
How is she doing
Just fine
(slurred speech) Boy or girl
It was nothing--it's all over
It's all over, honey
They walk Candy on her gurney
Homer looks after them
(slurred speech) would like to have a baby, one day
really would
Why, of course--you can have as many children as you want
'm sure you'll have very beautiful children
Larch wheels Candy behind a curtain
You'll have Princes of Maine
You'll have Kings of New England
Larch has a different tone of voice when he speaks to Wally
suggest you find yourself some fresh air, Lieutenant
Wally is left alone in the corridor
'  - Cranked at three-quarters, Fuzzy sits in bed, wheezing and coughing
He's drawing with great intensity, using crayons on a piece of paper held by a clipboard
Homer sits on the end of Fuzzy's bed, cleaning up Steerforth
Homer pauses to look out of the window; he sees Wally, dashing and spotless in his uniform beside his flashy car
life Homer might have had crosses his face
(
) Homer, when is Halloween
Homer turns to Fuzzy, who holds up his picture--a big pumpkin with a jack-o-lantern face
(distracted) Uh
it's the end of October
Is that soon
Homer looks at Fuzzy; his little body is working hard just to breathe
That's a few months away, Fuzz
(to Homer) still don't feel so good
(disappointed) Oh
It's the best time
How come we only get pumpkins once a year
Fuzzy coughs and coughs
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too
We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway
Homer looks out the window at Wally again
His decision forms
- Homer approaches the flashy car, where Wally is still pacing
Has anyone offered you anything to eat
Actually, someone did
just didn't think  could eat anything
An awkward silence, which Homer covers by examining the car
(trying to sound casual) wonder if you might give me a ride
Sure
Be glad to
Uh
a ride where
(unprepared) Where are you going
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth
Homer nods, but he has no idea where Cape Kenneth is
Cape Kenneth
Wally nods
That sounds fine
/ - Homer runs up the stairs, two steps at a time; he races into a corridor at full speed, exhilarated
Suddenly Dr
Larch appears in front of him
Homer stops abruptly, out of breath, unable to speak
'  - As Homer stands guiltily, Larch rifles through an -ray file, holding various  rays up to the lit screen
He quickly finds the one he's looking for, attaching it briefly to the screen for a confirming look--a heart  ray, which Larch waves at Homer as he talks
(sarcastic) Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do
(restrained) wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless-- expect 'll find some ways to be of use
In other parts of the world,  suppose there are other ways
(still restrained) Of course
(blows up) Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life
What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well
And you won't be able to take care of them, either
There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there
(feeling trapped) You know 'm grateful for everything you've done for me
(calmly) don't need your gratitude
Larch hands Homer the heart  ray
(exasperated) don't need this-- know all about my condition
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you
Camera closes on Homer with the  ray
- Buster and Mary Agnes are serving the evening meal while Larch rails at Angela and Edna, who are helping Buster and Mary Agnes
The sound of children in the dining hall is intermittent and chaotic
Going where
Does he have a plan of some kind
Will he be back soon
don't know
He's just leaving-- (to Angela) you're the one who says he needs to see the world
(to Edna) *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world
(stunned) He's leaving
He'll need clothes
some money
Let him try to *make* some money
That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it
(angrily) Oh, just stop it
You knew this was going to happen
He's a young man
(almost breaking) He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur
He could use some clothes
Camera closes on Larch, fighting tears
'  - Homer is packing his things--we see the heart  ray, and some photos of Larch and Edna and Angela
Larch approaches Homer with a small bundle of clothes
(gently, almost reverently) think these will fit you
Homer is grateful and ashamed
Before he can speak, Edna is there--a wad of bills in her hand
She tries to put the money in his pocket; when he refuses it, she simply puts the money in his open suitcase, stuffing the bills under his clothes
You'll need some money--just a little something, until you find a job
Larch and Edna retreat from him, humbly, as if they were his servants
- As Homer puts his stuff in the truck of Wally's car, Angela can't resist touching his face
She is too upset to speak
From a window, Larch is watching the departure
He sees Homer saying goodbye to the children, embracing them
From another window, Fuzzy just stares
(Of course he's coughing
) We see Wally carrying Candy to the car
(groggy) 'm okay-- can walk
don't want you to walk-- want to carry you
Should  put the top up
It might get cold
No--keep it down
want to feel the air
She speaks to Homer, touching his sleeve, like a sleepy person, as Wally puts her gently in the backseat
(still groggy) Coming with us
It's always a good idea to have a doctor along for the ride
Homer gets in the passenger seat beside Wally, who starts the car; suddenly there is Curly
Homer can't look at Curly, who looks betrayed
Edna picks up Curly and carries him to the passenger-side window
Curly is sobbing
have to go, Curly
'm sorry
(to Edna) couldn't find Buster
Will you tell him
He can't finish what he has to say
Edna kisses him good- bye
From the window, Larch watches the car leave
Buster, whittling a stick, isn't watching
/
'  -    - There is quiet as the journey gets underway
Wally keeps glancing at Candy in the rear-view mirror; she seems distant, lost in thought
Homer is taking everything in--the speed, the road, the wind in his face
'  - Angela speaks to the boys
Let us be happy for Homer Wells
'  - In the girls' washroom, in front of the mirror by the row of sinks, Mary Agnes is repeatedly slapping her face
Angela's benediction to the boys plays Over this scene of violent self-abuse
Except for the sound of the slaps
Mary Agnes doesn't make a sound
(
) Homer Wells has found a family
Good night, Homer
(
) Good night, Homer
- On his bed, Larch is taking ether
We hear the refrain from the boys in the bunk room Over
(
) Good night, Homer
Good night, Homer
Good night, Homer Wells
'  - The radio is playing
Candy is lying down, her knees drawn up, in the backseat; she appears to be asleep, oblivious to Homer and Wally's conversation
Actually, the Army has given me leave twice
First when my father died, and now 'm on leave to help my mother-- 'm just trying to get her ready for the harvest
She's no farmer
Apples were my dad's business
And with the war on, she's short on pickers
Candy's eyes are open but her voice is groggy
(to Homer) Wally thinks apples are boring
(to Homer) never said they were boring
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying
" Well, they aren't
Homer looks back at Candy
Her eyes close
think 'd probably like the apple business
You're a little overqualified, aren't you
No, 'm not
need a job
The only jobs are picking jobs
Picking apples is truly boring
Candy's eyes snap open and she sits up a little
There
You said it was boring
Well, *picking* them is
It's about as exciting as
walking
Candy seems irritated with Wally
Homer tries to engage her
Is your family in the apple business, too
No, but  work there-- like it
My dad's a lobsterman
've never seen a lobster
Really
've never seen the ocean, either
(amazed) You've never seen the *ocean*
Homer shakes his head, smiles
That's not funny
that's *serious*
/
/ - The car is parked at the side of the road
Wally is half- hidden behind a tree
Candy and Homer are left alone in the car; there's an awkward silence as Homer pretends not to hear Wally's excessive peeing
Suddenly Candy starts to sob
couldn't have a baby with someone who's leaving me-- didn't know what else to do
Homer is a doctor--he's used to postabortion reactions
know
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay
They're going to be shooting at him
Where's Mandalay
Burma
Oh
can't have a baby alone
don't even know if he's coming back
understand
He doesn't, really
Wally returns
Wally leans over Candy to hug her
Honey, honey
of course 'll come back
Candy pounds on his chest with her fists
You don't *know*, Wally
You have no *idea*
Wally backs away
Candy sobs uncontrollably
Stay away from me
Wally signals to Homer to get out of the car
Later, Wally and Homer stand outside the car, overhearing Candy's weeping
Homer is smoking nervously
(strictly medical) This is all normal
Don't worry
The abortion procedure
it affects you
It's the ether, too
It'll take a little time
don't *have* any time
There's a *war*
It's all very normal
Wally looks at Homer, who takes a nervous drag on his cigarette
You ought to cut that shit out--it's terrible for you
Homer looks at Wally; he sees the authority in his eyes
Homer drops his cigarette and puts it out with his foot
They notice that Candy has stopped crying
Wally finds Candy asleep in the backseat
'  -    - The lone car on the road
Snatches of war news from the radio are the only sound as the headlights illuminate the dark highway
- The car is parked, with Homer sleeping in it alone
The sounds of the ocean increase as Homer opens his eyes
Homer gets out of the car and walks toward the beach, enchanted
There it is: his first view ever of an ocean, the horizon, the sun glimmering on the water
Candy is lying on a blanket in the sand
Wally is throwing rocks in the water
Homer takes it all in
When Candy calls for him, Homer walks up to her
'm a little worried about the
(she gestures below her waist) about how much bleeding is okay
It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again
You have cramps
(Candy nods) They'll ease up, almost entirely
As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal
(
) Catch
football comes flying through the air toward Homer; it bounces off his chest
Wally laughs
(meaning the football) Give it here
Homer throws the football; it's clear he's never thrown one before
What was *that*
Come over here
Homer runs over to Wally, who proceeds to show him how to pass the ball
Snatches of his instruction drift to Candy, who closes her eyes
"Put your fingers on the laces--no, it rests in your palm, like this
You want the laces up--yes, like that
" -  () Homer and Wally sit on the beach a short distance from Candy's blanket
She appears to be asleep
Wally looks in her direction before he speaks to Homer
It's called the Burma run
It's about a seven-hour round-trip flight between India and China
Wally draws a crude map in the sand
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma
*And* over the Himalayas
That's called flying over the hump
On Candy's face: she's not asleep; she's listening
(
) At what altitude
've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass
Homer looks at Wally, thoughtfully
What lousy luck-- mean your orders
to draw an assignment like that
(conspiratorially) Actually,  volunteered
Homer is shocked; he looks back at Candy, lowers his voice
It's the flying, right
You love to fly, don't you
Wally nods; he also gives a look in Candy's direction before he responds
love the bombing, too
But there's also the Himalayas--they have the most wicked air currents in the world
wouldn't miss flying there for anything
Homer's smile suggests that he's impressed, but that he wouldn't have Wally's enthusiasm for the task
Wally laughs and puts his hand on Homer's shoulder
Uh, look
if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring
Oh,  would love that, Wally
-   - The car is parked at a lobster pound
Homer sits in the car watching Wally carrying Candy's bag to the door
Candy stands outside the car; she shakes Homer's hand
guess 'll see you around the orchards
Thanks for everything
Sure
'll see you around
Candy turns and heads toward the house to catch up with Wally
lobsterman in his boat is approaching the dock
It's , Candy's father
Candy waves
"Hi, Daddy
" Homer glances at Candy and Wally on the dock, kissing good-bye
(whispering) love you, Wally
love you, too
See you tomorrow
-   - Wally drives up to the Worthington house; he gets out of the car
Homer sits in the car, admiring the beautiful farmhouse
Come on
You have to meet my mom
(conspiratorially) If it comes up, 've been at a wedding
That's where  met you, at the wedding
- '  - Homer as never seen such a room: the sports trophies, the photos of athletic teams, and of Candy with Wally
Model airplanes are everywhere
Mrs
Worthington's voice comes from the hall
(
) Wally
expected you earlier
She appears in the doorway of Wally's room
Mrs
Worthington () is an elegant, fiftyish New Englander, as handsome as Wally, but more reserved
She is surprised to see Homer
This is Homer Wells--he's the most overqualified apple picker you'll ever meet, but he's dying to learn the apple business
Wally is taking his uniform off as he speaks, just dropping it on the floor as he quickly puts on some farm clothes
How do you do, Homer Wells
Homer has never met anyone like her
How do you do
Mrs
Worthington starts picking up her son's uniform from the floor
She is politely curious about Homer
Were you a friend of the bride or the groom
Homer looks confused; he seems to have forgotten about the alleged wedding
Wally puts his arm around Homer, urging him into the hall
Homer is everybody's friend, Mom
the bride's, the groom's, mine, Candy's, *everybody's*
Homer is embarrassed, but Olive is obdurately well-mannered
Well, perhaps you'll come to dinner, Homer
Wally calls to her as he pushes Homer down the hall
Not tonight, Mom--he's got to meet *Mr
Rose*
- Homer and Wally get out of the jeep at the cider house, a barnlike building with adjacent sheds and, behind it, line after line of trees--the apple orchards
Homer sees an outdoor shower where    are showering
It is a wooden stall that leaves the shower's occupants visible above and below their midsections is caught naked, running behind the cider house and out of sight as he wraps a towel around himself
You already used up the hot water
You're usin' my soap, ain't you
ain't usin' no soap--it's too cold to bother with soap
There ain't never enough hot water, soap or no soap
They're migrants
(no clue) Migrants
Yes
They pick fruit, all kinds
They travel up and down the coast with the seasons
(leaning close to Homer) The trick to Mr
Rose is, you have to let him be the boss
Homer wonders what that means as Wally reaches for the door of the cider house
Before Wally can knock, a pretty young black girl,  , bumps open the screen door with her hip and throws a bucket of water in the grass--almost hitting Homer and Wally
That sink's backed up again, Wally
thought you was gonna get me a plumber
Rose, this is Homer--Homer, this is Mr
Rose's daughter, Rose
Rose Rose
Pretty, ain't it
You a plumber
No, no--Homer is a new *picker*
He's going to stay here with you
This gets the attention of the men on their way from the showers
They walk over, towels around their waists
(suspiciously) He's stayin' *here*
The screen door swings open and shut again, startling them all, as
comes out of the cider house
That daughter of mine sure is Miss Hospitality, ain't she, Wally
Grinning, Mr
Rose shakes Wally's hand
Rose Rose goes back inside the cider house as Mr
Rose shakes Homer's hand
Homer introduces himself
You got lots of experience pickin', suppose
Homer's got no experience, Arthur, but he's smarter then  am
He's a fast learner
Mr
Rose looks briefly at the men, who wait for his reaction
This is history
Ain't that what you're sayin', Wally
guess we makin' *history*
havin' this young man stay with us
Wally slaps Homer on the back; he goes inside the cider house to help Rose Rose with the plumbing
(over his shoulder) See you later
Homer looks at Mr
Rose for instructions
Mr
Rose stares back at him with his enigmatic smile
So
What should  do now
Out back, there's a shed
It's just a mess
If that shed was better organized,  could put my truck in there
Homer looks at Mr
Rose with an uncomprehending expression
If you're as smart as Wally says, you know you sometimes gotta do one job before you do another
Homer thinks that over
Later, Homer is cleaning out the shed
- The pickers all sit down to supper around a picnic table
Homer with Mr
Rose, Rose Rose, and the other black pickers
Mr
Rose takes an apple from a bowl on the table
Then he pulls out a knife and opens it in one fluid motion; he's so fast, the knife seems to come out of nowhere
He begins to peel the apple
Homer eyes Mr
Rose, but Mr
Rose's focus is riveted to his apple and the long, perfect strand of peel dangling from it
You did a good job with that shed, Homer
Peaches breaks the awkward silence
What kind of a name is Homer
It's the name of a cat
Originally
Well, not *originally*
Homer decides to stop
Another silence
Now, now--we all got names, sensible or not
(to Homer) Peaches is from Georgia, where we met him pickin' peaches
He's still better with peaches than hs is with apples
(Peaches grins) Jack here is new
And this here is Hero, 'cause he was a hero of some kind or other once
Ain't that right, Hero
There are some disrespectful suggestions from the pickers concerning what his heroism might have been
And this here sensitive-lookin' fella is Muddy
The less said about Muddy, the better
Ain't that right, Muddy
Muddy scowls at Homer, but he smiles at Mr
Rose
- Homer unpacks his suitcase
(His bed should be nearest Muddy's and Mr
Rose's
) Jack lies on his bed, smoking
Muddy, also smoking, is sitting on his bed, sharpening a knife
Hero and Peaches are playing cards on one of their beds
Mr
Rose is finishing shaving
Rose Rose watches Homer unpack
What's that
It's just my heart
What you got a picture of your heart for
He holds up the  ray, in order to show her
There's a little something wrong with it
Just this part here--the right ventricle
It's slightly enlarged
So what
Yes, so what
It's nothing serious, really
Just a small defect
It's big enough to keep you out of the war,  suppose
Ain't that right
Right
Rose Rose picks up the book that Homer has put on the bed
She studies the cover; it's "Great Expectations" by Charles Dickens
She puts it down, restlessly
They told me  was too old to serve
They told Muddy his feet was too flat
Everybody laughs, except Muddy
(to Peaches) And you was "generally unfit," as recall
Finished unpacking, Homer sits on his bed; he picks up "Great Expectations" and begins to read
Rose Rose sits down next to him, watching him read
Homer notices her interest
Do you like to read
(embarrassed) can't read
Nobody taught me
Homer smiles politely and goes back to his book
Rose Rose keeps looking over his shoulder at the pages
(pointing to the page) What does it say there
Homer looks around at the pickers lying in their beds, smoking, listening
(Like bedtime stories at the orphanage, he thinks; however, the picker's attitude is suspicious, reserved
) (reading) " looked at the stars, and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face to them as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude
" Homer looks up; there's no response
(to Rose Rose) More
Some muttering, some giggling, mostly silence
Rose Rose wants more, but suddenly Jack jumps out of bed and stomps to the kitchen end of the cider house, where a piece of paper is tacked to the wall
Jack is talking to Homer all the way
Since you're the one who's smart enough to read
what's this
Jack points at the piece of paper
Homer gets up and looks at it
It's a list of rules, it seems
All the men groan--Jack swears and Peaches laughs
*Whose* rules
They're for us,  suppose
Go on and read 'em, Homer
"One
Please don't smoke in bed
" It's too late for that one
All the smokers laugh and cough in their beds
(uncharacteristically blunt) Stop it, Homer
They aren't our rules
We didn't write them
don't see no reason to read them
Okay
Rose Rose stomps back to her bed
Her father absently snaps his towel
-  () Everybody is asleep, except Homer
He is staring at the ceiling in the quiet semi-darkness, the book lying on his chest
(
) (distant echoing) Good night, you Princes of Maine
You Kings of New England
'  - Dr
Larch is standing in the doorway to the boys' room; he closes the door
- Homer, on his bed, closes his eyes
- Larch lies in bed with his eyes open
(No ether
) - The cider house and the apple orchard in the moonlight
- Wally in his farm clothes at the wheel of the Jeep--he is racing through the orchards, dodging trees, with Homer in the passenger seat, hanging on for dear life
Remember this
In the morning, when the tall grass is wet, you can make the Jeep slide on the grass
Can you feel it
Homer is excited as Wally weaves among the trees--faster and faster
It's almost like flying
What about the trees
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground
Wally brakes hard
The Jeep comes to a stop in the packing- house area
Candy has been waiting on the loading platform
The pickers are working in the background
(defensively to Candy) was just showing Homer the orchards
kind of a geography lesson
(good-naturedly) know what you've been doing
She pulls an apple branch, with an apple to two, out of the vehicle's grille--or else the branch is wedged in the front - bumper or headlight area
Candy playfully starts poking Wally with the branch
(to Wally) You've been giving him a *flying* lesson
(teasing her) He *loved* it
(to Homer) Didn't you
Yeah, it was great
Wally gets the apple branch away from Candy
He pins her arms at her sides--he hugs her, kisses her
She doesn't struggle
(laughing to Homer) He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches
*Homer* liked it
(to Homer) Didn't you
Yeah, sure
There's no stress or strain around here
They all laugh
Homer observes the happy couple
- Homer is walking with Wally and Candy
The orchards are beautiful
- Much activity: the pickers are unloading apple crates from a full flatbed trailer
An angry-looking  gives Homer an evil glare
Homer spills some apples lifting the crate to the loading platform
What's wrong with you
Mr
Rose takes Homer aside
That's Vernon
You best stay away from him until he gets to know you better--then you best stay away from him *more*
Wally, in full uniform, appears from inside the packing house; he calls for Homer
Out lieutenant's calling you, Homer
Mind your ass
Homer smiles are runs toward Wally
/
- Homer and Wally walk through the packing house, where the ,   sort through the apples rolling by on the conveyor tracks
Wally snatches an apple from one of them, giving it to Homer
(to Homer) You getting along okay
Before Homer can answer, the women interrupt
Where is that Candy
Did she leave you, Wally
Who's the boy
Wally makes an effort to introduce Homer, but he's interrupted
Wally, you can marry Debra if Candy leaves you
Wally's gonna marry *me* if Candy leaves him
You can marry all three of us, Wally
We can take turns
Wally puts his hand to his heart
You girls make it hard for a guy to go off to war
(points to Homer) But 'll leave my best man here to pinch-hit for me
As the women are left behind giggling, Wally continues talking to Homer
Uh
'm shipping out sooner than thought
just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering
(grabbing another apple from a crate) Are you bored stiff
Or can you stick it out for a bit
Uh
actually, picking apples is as much excitement as  want for a while
'm grateful for the job
(his hand on Homer's shoulder) You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer
You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while 'm gone
Candy, too
Well, sure
that's good, then
(awkward pause) All  mean is, 'm lucky  met you
don't think so, Homer
*'m* the lucky one
Homer shakes his head
Wally stops walking; they both stop
(more serious) You want to fight about it
Homer is unfamiliar with this kind of kidding around; at first he is startled, but then he laughs
Wally laughs, too
They shake hands
Mr
Rose calls out to Homer from the tractor
The pickers are impatiently waiting for him on the flatbed; they're going back to the orchard
Homer has to run to catch up to them
He jumps on the flatbed; he sees Wally waving good-bye
- High up in a tall tree on a couple of ladders, Mr
Rose and Homer are picking side by side
Mr
Rose is picking with high-speed perfection, but Homer is slower and fumbling--he drops an occasional apple to the ground
You pickin' more cider apples then anythin' else
Them drops is good only for cider
And you pickin' the stems with the apples only half the time
They good only for cider, too-- if you don't pick them stems
(Homer watches him) The rule is, you wanna pick the apple *with* the stem, Homer
And see here
see that *bud* that's just above the stem
That's the bud for *next year's* apple--that's called the *spur*
You pick the spur, you pickin' two years in one--you pickin' next year's apple 'fore it have a chance to grow
You leave that on the branch, you hear
Homer nods; he picks more carefully, with more concentration
(approvingly) That's better
can tell you got yourself some education
Them's good hands you got, Homer
Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right
guess so
Homer can see over the apple mart parking lot from the top of the tree
He can see the driveway of the Worthington house, where Candy and Olive are saying a tearful good-bye to Wally
Distracted, Homer drops another couple of apples, which Mr
Rose observes with a wry smile
(
) Wilbur
Wilbur
'  - Larch is doing something at his desk when Angela comes in
Wilbur, you should read this
Larch stares at Angela, who holds a letter
It's from the Board
Another letter
'  - Dr
Larch stands in front of a mechanical drawing easel
He works intently with a calligraphic pen, but we don't see what he's working on
Angela and Edna sit at the desk; they're looking over the letter
(quoting the letter) Uh
"merely suggesting that some new blood might benefit you all
someone with new ideas in the obstetrical and pediatric fields
" (she looks up at Larch) think they're just testing some ideas for our next meeting
Dr
Holtz seems nice
think he only wants to help
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"
He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me
It's that Mrs
Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs
Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country
'd like to give her a little ether
So what are you going to do
Larch puts down the pen, comes around the easel, opens a drawer in a filing cabinet, and hands Edna a folder containing a few cleanly typed pages
Larch returns to the easel, to his painstaking work
Edna opens the file; as she and Angela read the contents, Larch recites from memory as he works
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915
" Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922
"
graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939
" This is *your* life story, Wilbur
You just changed the dates
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch
For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care
" You *invented* him
You've completely made his up
Don't you understand
The board is going to *replace* me
That's what the "new blood" is *for*
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions
(sarcastically) Well, we can only guess about that, Edna
They *are* against the law
These *credentials* are against the law
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are
Don't you be holy to me about the *law*
What has the law done for any of us here
Edna and Angela think this over
(points at file) So here is my candidate
What do you think
But what about school records
Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*
Larch turns the easel around
Attached is a parchment headed: "  "--it's a diploma-in-progress
He *will* have them, Edna
The women are shocked, awed
Oh, Wilbur,  don't know
(sudden thought) We don't even know where he is
,  - (
) Where's that Homer
Homer stands in front of a ladder that leans against the cider house; he starts to climb up, drawn by the murmuring voices, the soft laughter
(
) Who cares
(
) Now, now
He's a good boy
(
) Shit
We don't know what he is
(
) Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter
Homer arrives at the top and sees everyone sitting on a long plank, a bench attached to the apex of the roof--obviously a popular spot
Here he is
No one moves
Where's your manners
Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view
What view
Peaches slides over and Homer sits down
Are we supposed to be up here
The rules said
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong
The others laugh
*What* view
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about
More laughter; Homer smiles, enjoying the teasing
(gesturing toward the Worthington farmhouse) bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'
You think so, Jack
Well
wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight
(playfully, teasing him) Daddy, 'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night
(teasing her back) You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl
What's lucky about that
Rose Rose is being physically affectionate with her father-- lightly punching his arm, rubbing the top of his head
You know where that Wally is tonight, darlin'
He's up there in them angry stars
(gesturing at the dark sky) He's flyin' all around up there
with them Japs shooting at him
They all look up, imagining that
Homer more than the others
Rose Rose, looking thoughtful, rests her head on her father's shoulder
They are completely natural together
-   - Homer and the pickers are loading crates of apples into a shipping truck
Olive and Candy are consulting some papers (the shipping tally) on a clipboard; Mr
Rose is standing beside them
They all on board, Mrs
Worthin'ton
Thank you, Arthur
(see is looking at Homer) And how is our Homer working out
She catches Homer's eye; he smiles, then joins them
Mr
Rose puts his arm around him
Oh, he's a smart young man, most of the time--Wally was right about him
Olive is looking over the rest of the picking crew
No rotten apples
(it's an old way of speaking that they have) No, no--not this year
Well
maybe we got *one*, but it ain't Homer
He means Jack, who gives Olive and Candy and Mr
Rose a furtive look
Olive smiles at Rose Rose, who comes up to her and Candy
Olive touches Rose Rose with affection
Rose
dear girl, 'm sure  can find you some other clothes
(to Candy) You must have some things that would fit her
Candy takes Rose Rose by the shoulders and turns her around
Rose Rose is enjoying this
have a *ton* of things that would fit you
Now, now, Candy--this girl don't need no more clothes, not for pickin'
He starts leading his daughter away
(charming) Arthur, there's no such thing as a young woman who's got all the clothes she needs
Olive waves good-bye as she moves toward her car
Candy turns to Homer
So
Not bored yet
'm *never* bored
It's all very
different for me
here
Homer has the hardest time looking at Candy
Uh
have you been *feeling* okay
When 'm not thinking about Wally
'm not good at being alone
(realizing) Oh, goodness
You meant
yes, 'm fine
(struggling to change the subject) don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet
Homer shakes his head
He looks at the tractor and the empty trailer
Mr
Rose and the pickers are just watching them
(more seriously) You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then
Okay
Homer looks toward the pickers sitting on the flatbed when he hears the tractor start
Candy follows his gaze
better go
don't think Mr
Rose would leave without you
Mr
Rose gestures for Muddy to drive off; the tractor trailer pulls away
(laughing) Sorry
Homer has to run to catch up
(calling) Come next week
He jumps on the back of the departing flatbed between Mr
Rose and Rose Rose, as Candy watches him
- An anxious-looking   is fixing the kitchen sink while the pickers (in their towels) stand around and watch
Homer is putting on his best shirt
Peaches admires the shirt as Rose Rose cooks the night's supper on the wood stove
Whoa--look at that Homer
He's gettin' all dressed up for supper tonight
He ain't gettin' dressed to have supper with *us*, Peaches
The pickers all look at Homer, who looks guilty as he leaves
(to the plumber) Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time
- Homer pedals a bicycle down a dirt road
- Ray holds a lobster up to the camera
We see the old-fashioned wooden pens, floating dockside
Hungry
Homer looks uncertain
,  - Homer and Ray and Candy go up the gangplank from the dock to the lobster pound
They're the garbage-eaters of the ocean's floor
The seagulls clean up the shore
The lobsters clean up the bottom of the sea
They eat everything
Everything that falls to the bottom
It's time somebody ate *them*
(to Candy) was lookin' for Wally's letter was gonna show it to Homer
(to Homer) They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*
He mentions Homer, too, you know
(awkwardly) Wally said to say, "Hello
" (equally awkward) Oh
That's
nice
(to Homer) Wally said the most spectacular hits were in the oil fields at Yenangyat
Later, through the window of the lobster pound, we see them eating lobster around a kitchen table
Laughter and some unclear dialogue drift to us
/
/'  - With the bicycle stowed in the trunk, Candy is driving Homer back to the cider house
They pass a drive-in movie theatre, the marquee announcing "
" Homer stares in awe at the giant blank screen
movie *outside*
Yes
But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout
People watched the movies in their cars
(smiling) When they watched at all
Do you like movies
Yes
've only seen one, though
Candy looks at him; he isn't joking
You've seen only one movie
Which one
"King Kong"
It's really good
Candy laughs
haven't seen "King Kong" since was a kid
Homer laughs a little self-consciously; around her, he feels like he's *still* a kid
- At one table, the children are happily eating apples; a few of the kids are stuffing apples from a big bowl into their pockets
At another table, Larch, Edna, and Angela sit around an open packing crate of apples
Larch takes a bite from an apple and spits it out
Angela takes the apple out of his hand
That's a pie apple, Wilbur
Homer said you're not supposed to eat it
Angela hands him another apple
So he's an apple expert, is he
Angela gives him a critical look as Larch takes a bite out of the new apple
(sarcastically) Oh my, yes
This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too
You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy
wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself
(incredulous) You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples
Both Edna and Angela glower at him
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter
dissertation on apples, we don't need
(annoyed) He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too
wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money
If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner
Larch angrily tosses the half-eaten apple into the garbage
Wilbur, it's a *gift*
How can you be angry with Homer for sending us a *gift*
Larch stares into space, depressed
Then he examines the crate and finds the mailing label that says " -- ,
" He rips it off, holds it up triumphantly
'll show him a *gift*
'll give him a gift he can *use*
Larch storms out of the room
-   - newsreel from the war is playing on the screen--soldiers marching, smiling, waving to the camera
Homer and Candy sit together watching
Homer is completely fascinated; Candy watches Homer as much as the news
Her expression changes when the newsreel cuts to footage from an air raid
-   - Candy and Homer walk out of the theatre, under the marquee and past the poster for "Wuthering Heights
" (disappointed) But you looked as if you liked it
(smiling) *did* like it
All  said was, "It's not 'King Kong'
" Candy makes a face, but in good fun
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him
She *did* love him
(teasing him) How many women have you known
Homer is embarrassed; he ducks the question
And what did she die of, exactly
She was torn apart
She died of a broken heart
Oh, sure
Homer smiles and shakes his head; Candy starts to laugh
What's the *medical* explanation
Well, she was in a weakened condition
(laughs) don't know
What about "King Kong"
Is that medically possible
Homer smiles; he knows she's teasing him, and he likes it
(mock serious) At least King Kong knew what he *wanted*
Candy pushes him playfully
They're both having a good time, *too* good a time
- Homer is picking apples in a big tree; Rose Rose is on a ladder in the tree right beside him
She's picking about twice as fast as he is, and he keeps dropping his apples
In another tree, Muddy is watching
What is you *doin'* with that Candy, Homer
(imitating Mr
Rose) He's makin' history,  suppose
From the surrounding trees, the other pickers laugh
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, hope
No trouble
In adjacent trees, both Peaches and Hero are picking apples; they can hear Homer and Rose Rose, too
(So can Mr
Rose
) That Candy--she's the nicest girl know
She's about the most beautiful girl ever seen-- don't know if she's the nicest
She's the nicest *and* the most beautiful girl 've ever known
The men *oooh* and *aaah* at Homer's announcement--Mr
Rose, too
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me
'm not in trouble
Yeah, you is
know when people is in trouble, and you is
Camera closes on Homer's face; he keeps picking
(
) His name is Homer Wells
' -   - Edna and Angela face the Board of Trustees around a table
Larch circles the table as everyone reads the contents of a folder
Larch has provided a copy for each member
The three elderly gentlemen on the Board don't speak; they just nod their heads to everything Dr
Holtz or Mrs
Goodhall says
and his *pathetic* resume is the best 've seen
Though  find it hard to believe the Board would be interested in this character
But he looks like an excellent young man, a first-rate candidate
He looks like a bleeding-heart missionary *moron* to me, but that's going to be the problem with any doctor interested in coming here
Do you know him
*No*
don't want to know him
He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*
wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer
Maybe he got killed in the war
Suddenly Steerforth bursts through the door, having been pushed from behind by Mary Agnes
The two stop when they see what's going on--not to mention Larch's stern expression
They back out
Mary Agnes winking at Dr
Holtz before the door closes
Mrs
Goodhall is ready to continue
fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here
Does it *snow* in Bombay
One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is
Then  suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him
But, Dr
Larch, he seems exceptionally qualified
'm not talking about his medical qualifications
It's the *Christian* thing that bothers me-- just don't see it being of much *use* around here
(bitterly) fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here
Anyway,  was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- didn't think you'd be interested
We're *very* interested
Yes, *very*
You wouldn't be opposed to meeting with him
suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him
What's his name again
Dr
Homer Wells
(mumbling) just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time
The three elderly gentlemen repeat the name
It's a nice name, very New England
Very *Maine*, a very *local*-sounding name
*Very*
- song plays on the old phonograph as a happy Larch and Angela dance
Edna interrupts them
just wanted to ask you
Edna
Come dance with me
Let's be foolish tonight
Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India
Does he even *want* to come back
This causes Larch to take the needle off the record
(angrily) He's a field hand
What could possibly hold him there
- The rain beats down on Olive's car
Homer gets soaking wet as he leans in to talk to Candy, who's behind the wheel
Mr
Rose calls to Homer from the doorway of the mill room
- Mr
Rose is instructing Homer as they stand bottling cider in their yellow slickers and rubber boots
Rose Rose is hosing down the pressboards; Muddy and Hero and Peaches are operating the grinder and the press
Jack is stirring the vat
In a defiant, contemptuous way, Jack keeps flicking the ash of his cigarette into the vat
This make everyone uncomfortable; only Mr
Rose doesn't appear to notice
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins
You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts
What about the worms
Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right
There have to be worms
Of *course* there's worms, Homer
And what is them worms, really
They just *protein*, them worms
They is *good* for you
Everyone but Jack laughs
He takes a last drag on his cigarette, then deliberately drops it into the vat
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider
That ain't right
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute
You just gotta go fishin'
You mean *swimmin'*
ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette
What business is you in, Jack
Just tell me what your business is
Jack looks for a translation from the other men, who are nervous
Just say you're in the *apple* business, man
That's the only business you wanna be in
Just say it
Jack pulls a knife on Mr
Rose
(whispers excitedly to Jack) You don't wanna go in the knife business with Mistuh Rose--just say you're in the *apple* business, Jack
(to Mr
Rose) What business are *you* in
We never see Mr
Rose's knife
We see the men circle each other: Jack takes a swipe at Mr
Rose's head--then he steps back, his yellow slicker slashed open
His slicker is opened up, right up the middle
His shirt underneath the slicker is slashed open, too--he feels his bare chest and stomach, feeling for the cut
But there's no cut--Jack's not bleeding, he's not even scratched
Just his clothes have been slashed
'm in the *knife* business, Jack
You don't wanna go in the knife business with me
Muddy turns Jack around and views his slashed clothes
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed
Jack starts to undress for the vat
Mr
Rose ushers Homer and Rose Rose outside
- Mr
Rose has cut his own hand in the fight
Homer's professionalism if offended to watch Rose Rose's amateurish efforts to stitch up her father's wound, but clearly this isn't the first time she's done it
Give men that
know how to do it
Oh,  suppose you is a doctor, Homer
Almost
don't need no "almost" a doctor, Homer
Homer can't bear to watch Rose Rose at work with the needle
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat
Now, now, darlin'
Jack just needs to know what business he's in
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*
Ain't that right, Homer
Homer winces at the stitching
'  - -  - Wally's car comes bouncing along the ditches of the closed drive-in
Homer is at the wheel; Candy calls out some driving instructions
The car comes to a stop next to a speakerpost
Candy leans out; she grabs the speaker and hangs it on the window
Homer sits back and drapes his arms out the window and over the seat
He feels great
You're a natural
You were born to drive a car like this
You think
Maybe  was
(looks around) love this place
Homer looks up at the giant movie screen
The screen is enormous
Imagine King Kong up *there*
Have you seen a lot of movies here
Yes
and no
When you come here, you don't really care about the movie
Homer stares at Candy in disbelief
You don't care about the movie
Candy looks at him for a moment
What are you so crazy about the movies for
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night
We'd race into the dining hall
Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing
At least you were never lonely
didn't say that
Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely
You're just never alone
Candy is moved
Homer feels exposed; he tries to change the mood by making light of what he's said
You're not alone in the bathroom, or
or in the shower
you're never alone in wanting the last piece of meatloaaf, or even in your own bed on a cold morning
Candy laughs
You don't miss it
miss things
miss
people
(with certainty) miss reading to the boys
But you had so much *responsibility*
never *asked* for any responsibility
Just a little privacy
Homer laughs
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies
At the mention of Wally they both look a little self- conscious
Sometimes
movies mostly bore Wally
Ah-ha
(points to the speaker) So what is that--a radio
The *speaker*
For the movie sound
Candy looks at Homer
Scrunch down like this
Candy scrunches down in her seat; Homer imitates her
Homer is focused on the giant screen
How could you not *care* about the movie
You just cuddle
You come to hug
to kiss
You don't *come* here to watch the movie
(teasing her) That's what *'d* come here for
'd watch the movie
Not with the right girl you wouldn't
Homer's expression changes from exhilarated to guilty
He leans back in his seat and looks straight ahead at the screen
Candy tentatively leans her head on his shoulder
Homer looks afraid to breathe
From behind, with her head on his shoulder, they look like a normal couple
We track in toward the huge screen until we see only the screen
There are shadows on the black screen
Suddenly the movie "King Kong" appears
- "King Kong" is playing against the bare, white wall
Fuzzy is very weak, but he smiles at the sight of the love-struck Kong holding the screaming Fay Wray in his giant hand
Dr
Larch runs the projector; he sits close beside Fuzzy
When the film breaks in the predictable place, Fuzzy makes no protest
Dr
Larch looks at Fuzzy, who has stopped breathing; his eyes are closed
Fuzzy
Fuzzy
They are alone in the dining hall
Larch has wheeled in Fuzzy for a private viewing
' -  - Buster helps Larch lower the small coffin into the grave
The tiny gravestone says "
" What are you going to tell the little ones
'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him
They'll believe it because they want to believe it
Shouldn't we tell Homer
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us
'  - The boys in their beds listen to Buster inventing Fuzzy's "family
" It was a family with a better breathing machine then the one Dr
Larch built
' -  - Larch leans against the wall, covering his eyes, overhearing the boys
(
) The family that adopted Fuzzy, they *invented* the breathing machine
It's their business
breathing machines
Larch pauses; he waits to see if they believe this
(
) Lucky Fuzzy
Larch almost breaks with a sudden sharp breath
(
) Good night, Fuzzy
Good night, Fuzzy
Good night, Fuzzy Stone
- As the men sit at the picnic table eating their cornbread, Rose Rose pours coffee
jeep comes down the orchard road toward them
It's Olive
Mr
Rose leads the "Good mornin', Mrs
Worthin'ton
" greeting
Olive has an armful of clothing and a fairly sizable package; she brings the latter over to Homer
Some mail for you, Homer
Homer shakes the package; he puts the package beside the table, unopened
Olive turns to Rose Rose
And some clothes for you, dear-- (nodding to the cider house) let's go see if they fit
Mr
Rose watches Rose Rose and Olive disappear into the cider house
The other men view Homer's package with curiosity, especially Peaches
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer
Mind your own business, Peaches
Sorry, Homer
- Homer lies awake in bed; everyone else is asleep
Homer pulls the package out from under his bed, opening it just enough to see what it is; then he shoves it back under his bed
/ - The beach at sunset
Candy and Homer, dressed for cooler weather, are alone at the water's edge
From a paper bag, Candy is scattering some small, brightly colored pieces of broken glass
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet
Nobody will swim here until next summer
By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges
She finds and old piece of glass among the stones and shells at the high-tide mark
See
That's last year's glass, or from some year before
put glass here every year
The ocean makes it beautiful
Candy holds up a piece of glass to the sun for Homer to look at
The ocean is a gray-green color, the glass a paler shade of green
Give me your hand
She rubs the smooth piece of glass against his hand, then throws it toward the water
It falls short
Homer retrieves it
Candy splashes him playfully
He chases her away from the beach, into the pine trees
Homer locks his arms around her, from behind
He can't let go
She lets him hold her, then breaks his grip
She turns to face him
She is taller then he is, older, obviously more experienced
She initiates the kiss
They drop to the ground right there; they make love by the roots of the tree, Candy guiding him
'  -    - They come out of the woods, walking toward the car, Candy leading
We hear Candy talking just before we see her and Homer
(increasingly upset) *Nobody* volunteers for the Burma run--he said so himself
And nobody knows *me* better than him
So how am  supposed to feel
He's a bomber pilot and 'm just selfish,  know
Well, 'm *not* a brave little girl and 'm *not* sorry
She sits in the passenger seat, Homer in the driver's seat
*know* this was right
(pause) told you
'm not good at being alone
(pause; in a whisper) told him, too
Homer concentrates on starting the car
(repeating herself) *know* this was right
Right
Their expressions, as the car pulls away, belie their words
- Homer and Mr
Rose sit opposite each other at the picnic table
Rose Rose stands behind her father, her hands on his shoulders, watching Homer snip out Mr
Rose's stitches--very quickly
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry
This is easy--'m not hurrying
You still doin' it too fast
Job done, Homer leaves the table and hurries to the bicycle, pedaling away
Rose Rose watches Homer go, as Mr
Rose flexes his healed hand
He's in a big hurry, all right told you he's in trouble
-   - Candy and Homer sit on the dock
Candy still seems to be wrestling with her conscience
Homer throws snails in the sea
It's cold
Just tell me
Do you want me to go
Do you want me to stay
It will be okay
*What* will be okay
We have to wait and see
think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see
Homer throws a snail with more force
'll just move on, get another job somewhere
Ray comes out onto the dock; he sees Homer throwing another snail
Every time you throw a snail off the dock, you're makin' someone start his whole life over
Candy throws a handful of snails into the water
Maybe we're doing the snails a favor, Daddy
Ray looks at the two of them; he sighs
It's gettin' late
think 'll pack it in
Good night, Daddy
Ray nods good night; he leaves
Homer looks expectantly at Candy
We'll just have to wait and see
,   - Olive and Homer sit at the dining-room table, the remnants of an apple pie in front of them
Homer is still eating
Pictures of Wally are on the wall
used to hate it when Wally went back to college--even when it was just college
And this was when his father was still alive
hated it even then
Naturally  hate this more
Homer nods in sympathy
His mouth is stuffed with apple pie
What  mean is
would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer
(wiping his mouth) Mrs
Worthington,  feel 'm very lucky to be here
There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone
Olive's thoughts drift; her eyes look up at a photo of Wally
think Wally will be fine, Mrs
Worthington--he seems indestructible to me
(distracted) don't know
(intently at Homer) Just promise me one thing
Homer is tense
Does Olive suspect about Candy
Uh
sure
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over
They both laugh, but Homer has a hard time looking her in the eye
- The pickers are moving out; the harvest is over
Olive and Homer stand near the door to the bunkhouse, talking--we can't hear their conversation
Rose Rose and the other men walk past them, carrying the last of their belongings to the truck
Olive and Homer walk over to the truck
Good-bye
Have a safe trip home
Thank you, again, for all your hard work
You take care now, Mrs
Worthin'ton
They shake hands
Good-bye, Arthur
(she hugs Rose Rose) Homer, 'll see you tomorrow
Right
Olive gets in her Jeep and waves as she drives off
The truck is packed
Muddy tugs on a rope that secures the load
(to Mr
Rose) We all set,  think
Mr
Rose nods and gets in behind the wheel
Rose Rose and Muddy get in next to him
The others are bundled up for the ride in the open back of the truck
As they're leaving, Homer waves good-bye--the pickers calling out to him
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer
We see you next harvest
Don't freeze to death, Homer
Go on and freeze to death if you want to, Homer
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right
You just stay out of trouble, Homer
Homer stands looking after them, after they're gone
- Homer is alone, rearranging his stuff--spreading out a bit, making the place his own
(On the other beds, we see the mattresses rolled up on the bare bedsprings
) (
) So, you're staying
Homer turns; he hadn't seen Candy come in
Olive told me
(awkward pause) You might have told me yourself
'm just waiting and seeing
Like you said
She smiles
He goes to her; they embrace
- Homer, drinking coffee, is writing a letter on a note pad
(
) Dear Dr
Larch, thank you for your doctor's bag
'   - Homer is learning how to "haul" a lobster pot with Ray and Candy's guidance
(
) although it seems that  will not have the occasion to use it
,   - Following Ray's example, Homer is trying to "disarm" the lobsters' big claws by blocking them shut with the little wooden wedges
Roy works quickly, never getting pinched
As Candy watches, Homer gets pinched
(
) Barring some emergency, of course am not a doctor
With all due respect to your profession
am enjoying my life here
- Homer and Candy are naked
They have pulled two beds together and made a double bed
He can't take his eyes off her
've looked at so many women mean, 've seen *everything* about them, *everything*
but  never felt a thing
felt nothing
Now
with you
it *hurts*
to look at you
- Edna and Angela and Larch are all reading Homer's letter, their lips moving silently as they read the words
(
) am enjoying being a lobsterman and an orchardman--in fact,  have never enjoyed myself so much
,  - Olive and Homer and Candy are playing a board game around the fireplace
(
) The truth is,  want to stay here believe  am being of *some* use
'  - Edna and Angela view him anxiously from the doorway as Larch furiously types and types
(
) My dear Homer,  thought you were over your adolescence, that period which  would define as the first time in our lives when we imagine we have something terrible to hide from those who love us
'  - Candy is singing to the car radio, as animated and happy as we've ever seen her
Homer, driving, can scarcely keep his eyes on the road; he has to keep looking at her
(
) Do you think it's not obvious to us what's happened to you
- With the radio playing (a popular song), Homer hops across the bare floor, pulling on his boxer shorts; he opens the door to Olive, who's holding out an armload of blankets to him
He sheepishly thanks her
When Homer closes the door, we see a hidden (and stricken) Candy, naked from their interrupted lovemaking
(
) You're fallen in love, haven't you
By the way, whatever you're up to can't be too good for your heart
Then again, it's the sort of condition that can be made worse by worrying about it
So don't worry about it
- Vernon and Homer are working under an apple tree; they are poisoning mice
(
) Dear Dr
Larch, what  am learning here may not be as important as what learned from you, but everything is new to me
Yesterday  learned how to poison mice
You use poison oats and poison corn
- Supper chaos--Buster and Mary Agnes are doing their best to stop a food fight while Larch and Angela and Edna are completely absorbed reading Homer's letter
(
) Field mice girdle an apple tree
Pine mice kill the roots
*know* what you have to do--you have to play God
Well
killing mice is as close as  want to come to playing God
- Homer and Candy are watching "Rebecca"
(
) Do  interfere
When absolutely helpless women tell me that they simply *can't* have an abortion, that they simply *must* go through with having another--and yet another-- orphan
do  interfere
*Do* do not
do not even *recommend* just give them what they want: an orphan or an abortion
(close on Homer) You are my work of art, Homer
Everything else has been just a job
don't know if you've got a work of art in you, but  know what your job is
You're a doctor
- The radio is playing a slow, sexy dance number
The fat ladies from the apple mart are dancing as they paint the interior walls of the bunk house
(
) am not a doctor
(
) You know everything  know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then  am and you know it
Homer is finishing up painting the kitchen walls
When he gets to the list of rules, tacked on the wall, he removes the list and finishes painting under where the rules were
(
) They're going to replace me, Homer
The Board of Trustees is looking for my *replacement*
Two of the ladies unroll the rolled-up mattresses on the bare bedsprings, as Vernon enters with an armload of blankets and pillows
(
) can't replace you
'm sorry
Homer holds up the list of rules, rereads it briefly; he walks over to an unpainted beam, a support beam, and tacks the rules on this beam
,  - Homer reads Larch's letter, sipping coffee
(
) Sorry
'm not 'sorry'
Not for anything 've done
'm not even sorry that  love you
- Larch sits on his ether-bed with a letter from Homer in his hand
He looks completely deflated
Angela is standing in the doorway
think we may have lot him to the world
He's not coming back
- In the newly painted, spruced-up cider house, Homer and Candy are dancing to another slow, sexy song on the radio
He is untucking her blouse, feeling under her blouse--she starts to unbutton his shirt
They kiss while they dance
But the song changes abruptly on the radio to something fast and silly
Homer responds to the music, dancing goofily--instantly out of the mood
Candy laughs, but she picks up a pillow and swings it at him, hitting him
He dances away from her
She throws the pillow; he ducks--the pillow lands somewhere near the door
Now Homer grabs a pillow and chases her from bed to bed
She shrieks--they're both laughing
They each grab a pillow and stand toe to toe whacking each other, laughing all the while, until he pins her arms behind her and, breathing hard--and despite the stupid music that broke the mood--they are passionately kissing again
The sound of a truck is sudden and loud
- Mr
Rose's truck has arrived
The pickers are hopping out of the truck, grabbing their gear
- The door opens
Hero and Peaches barge in, as Homer and Candy are struggling to return the pillows to the beds
Who's that
It's that Homer
Muddy is right behind them
He picks up a pillow, off the floor, looking for which bed it belongs on
It's that Candy, too
Then comes Mr
Rose, slyly smiling, taking it all in--there's no hiding what's going on
Homer and Candy are caught, their shirts untucked and half-unbuttoned--they're still out of breath
The pillows lie crazily on the beds, each one of which has been stepped on
Don't this place look like home
It look nicer then home
What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice
Rose Rose enters
She looks hardened, toughened--not happy
She plops down her stuff on her bed, looking only at Candy
How is that Wally doing
Oh, he's fine
just heard from him
He's bombing all these places
Homer tries to help out
(mumbling) bridges, oil refineries, fuel depots
He peters out, knowing how sick of hearing this Candy is
He tries to change the subject
Where's Jack
There is an uncomfortable silence
He just wasn't up for the trip
More silence
That Jack just never knew what his business was
One look at Muddy and we know something pretty bad happened to Jack
- The pickers on their ladders, all picking
Homer is now a good picker; he looks over at Rose Rose
She is slumped against the ladder, not picking, completely ignoring an argument beneath them in the aisle between the trees
(Mr
Rose is checking over the apples Peaches has just picked
) You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches-- hope you understand that
They ain't drops-- picked 'em off the tree
Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me
See that bruise, and that one
*Half* of these is bruised
Look at this one
It ain't got no stem
You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider
- In the aisle between the trees, Homer and Candy are arguing in one of the work vehicles
Do you think 'm having a good time
Do you think 'm just *teasing* you
Do you think  *know* whether  want you or Wally
So we should "wait and see
" For how long
grew up with Wally
began my adult life with him
Fine
That's all there is to it then
No
That's not all there is to it love you, too-- *know*  do
Okay, okay-- know you do, too
(bitterly) It's a good thing  didn't have that baby, isn't it
Her sudden hardness leaves him speechless as they go their separate ways
Candy drives on
- Breakfast time at the picnic table
Rose Rose by herself, away from the table
She does not look well; she suddenly goes back inside the bunkhouse
(calling after her) Ain't you eatin' with us, Rose
(to the men) She used to eat with us
Now we ain't good enough for her,  guess
She ain't hungry, maybe
She ain't hungry every mornin' 'cause she's sick every mornin'
Homer gets up to take his dishes inside
- When Homer comes in, Rose Rose is throwing up in the sink
You okay, Rose
guess you must like watchin' me be sick
don't like watching anyone be sick
Rose Rose lies down on her bed with the curtain open
There is something familiar about the way Homer approaches her bedside; he does so with the authority of a doctor
He sits on the edge of her bed with such complete self-assurance that she doesn't protest
How many months are you
She just stares
But she doesn't stop him when he touches her abdomen
It's as if she knows that he knows what he's doing
You're not yet three months, are you
Not yet
What do you know about it
know more than  want to know about it
Who's the father
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business
But you don't look very happy
*Happy*
What are you thinkin'
How am  supposed to take care of a baby
can't have a baby
Rose, please listen
Whatever you want to do,  can help you
She is taken back
What  mean is, if you don't want to
keep the baby,  know a place where you can go
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere
ain't going *nowhere*
She rolls over on the bed, facing away from him again
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer
can take care of it myself
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything
You know,  mean to yourself
Please listen
(
) (calling) Homer
Is this a workin' day or what
- Homer and Candy are sitting at the dock
We should take her to St
Cloud's
That much is obvious, isn't it
Let her make up her mind when she gets there
told her
She doesn't feel she can do that
Something about her father not letting her go anywhere
Well, we have to help her
Homer doesn't respond
We have to do *something*
Don't we
(beat) Homer
Homer looks out over the ocean; he remains unresponsive
- Rose Rose is setting the picnic table for lunch when Candy arrives
Hi
Hi
She keeps setting the table
've got some more clothes for you-- just keep forgetting to bring them with me
don't need no more clothes, thank you
(softly) Rose,  know what's going on
Homer told me
got pregnant, too--about a year ago
(pause) 've been through this
Rose Rose looks down
You ain't been through what  been through, Candy
(doesn't get it) Yes,  *have*
Rose Rose dismissively waves her hand
Who's the father, Rose
Rose looks at Candy and shakes her head
You want to have the baby
Rose Rose shakes her head again, more emphatically
know where you can go
Homer and can take you
can't go nowhere
Why
Rose Rose stays silent
Is it the father
Does he know
Rose Rose turns away from Candy
You can trust me
Is it Jack
It's not Jack, is it
It's *Muddy*
Is it Muddy
(almost wistfully) No
It ain't Muddy
Muddy's just
Rose Rose stops; she can't even continue setting the table
Her voice turns bitter, despairing
It sure ain't Jack
There, suddenly, is Mr
Rose, walking past them
He is uncharacteristically tentative
(to his daughter) 'll be up top
Mr
Rose leaves Candy and Rose Rose alone again
Rose Rose nods almost invisibly after her father
Rose Rose looks pointedly at Candy, nodding
Candy slowly gets it
Mr
Rose is the father
Rose Rose lets that sink in; she keeps looking at Candy with an ashamed expression
- The pickers are at work, on their ladders, when Candy runs down the aisle between two rows of trees
She stops at the bottom of Homer's ladder, out of breath
Muddy and Peaches and Hero, in the treetops, are watching and listening
She won't go to St
Cloud's
(shrugging) Well, we can't force her
It's her decision
You don't understand
It's her father
Mr
Rose *knows*
(shouting) He's the *father*
He's her baby's father
The pickers can't help but hear this, too
Candy starts to leave, Homer running after her
Wait
*wait*
Are you sure
We've got to keep her away from that bastard
Candy leaves
Homer starts looking for Mr
Rose
,    - Smiling his enigmatic smile, Mr
Rose keeps slowly picking while Homer stands at the foot of his ladder
didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite
You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today
Is it true
Mr
Rose stops picking, his eyes darting to see who's around
Are you sleeping with your own daughter
Mr
Rose, with deliberate slowness, comes down the ladder
(slyly; still composed) think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer
You're actually having sex with your own little girl
Is that possible
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows
You're lying
How can you
with your own daughter
Mr
Rose switches from sly to threatening in a split second
Homer, don't you know what business you in
You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right
Go on, cut my clothes
've got other clothes
Mr
Rose is indignant
You a fine one to be talkin' about lies
Shame
These people took you in
That boy Wally's at *war*
That takes some of the steam out of Homer's superiority
But she's your *daughter*
And  *love* her
There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as do
(looks away) wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that
Homer turns; he speaks over his shoulder as he walks away
She's *pregnant*
Do you know *that*
By his expression--he looks as if he's been punched--it's clear that Mr
Rose didn't *know that*
The other pickers are on their way to lunch; it's obvious that Muddy, Peaches, and Hero already know that Mr
Rose is sleeping with his daughter
-   - Rose Rose is sitting at the picnic table when the pickers arrive for lunch, almost simultaneously with Homer
He looks at, then looks away from, Rose Rose
Mr
Rose is the last to sit down at the table as a very tense, wordless lunch begins
- Homer is on a ladder picking apples
Muddy climbs a ladder on the other side of the same tree
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you
How long's this been going on, Muddy
Long enough
You ain't gonna stop it
Muddy looks all around for Mr
Rose; then he gives Homer his knife
There's my knife, Homer
It ain't gonna do *me* no good
You give that knife to Rose Rose, you hear
Homer nods, pocketing the knife
As Muddy climbs down and moves his ladder to an adjacent tree, he keeps talking to Homer until he disappears in the leaves
You best just watch you ass, Homer
You don't wanna end up like Jack
Homer thoughtfully continues his work
- Homer lies awake in his bed
-  , The pickers on their ladders in the trees; nobody is talking
In the late sun, the leaves have a reddish, fiery glow
- It's much colder; the pickers are on their ladders in the trees again, but they're dressed for the cold
Homer is high on a ladder; he turns toward the view of the Worthington house when he hears a car come to a screeching halt in the driveway
Homer sees Candy get out of Wally's car; she leaves the door open and runs toward the house
Parked in front of Wally's car is an Army Jeep, with an   leaning against it
The indifferent soldier smokes a cigarette as he watches Candy run
No
No
Homer descends the ladder and runs for the house, down as aisle between the row of trees
The pickers watch him run
,   - Camera follows Homer into the Worthington house where, from the front hall, he sees Olive and Candy (in profile) sitting on the couch
We can't see who's talking, nor do we recognize the voice
As Homer comes into the living room, we see sitting in a chair (also in profile), talking to Olive and Candy
Major Winslow is a smooth, handsome well-briefed officer in the casualty branch of the Army Air Corps; he's done his homework, but he's not all business
He's painfully aware of the delicate nature of his report
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together
The copilot jumped third
All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane
None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was
They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash
They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either
Why was he missing for twenty days
Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane
They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India
It wasn't until that they sorted through their gear
Who cares about their *gear*
Three men jumped from the plane, but they had four compasses with them
One of the crew jumped with Captain Worthington's compass
He was in Burma for twenty days without a compass
He followed the Irrawaddy River, all the way to Rangoon
Somehow he managed to avoid the Japs, but not the mosquitoes
Then it's malaria
It's encephalitis
He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon
(pause) Uh
Captain Worthington is paralyzed
(Olive gasps) Waist down
He won't walk
Candy stands and leaves the room
(to Olive) 'm sorry
(asks the major) There are no autonomic effects, are there
Major Winslow has to consult his notes
No autonomic effects
that's correct
When will he be home, Major
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween
/
'  -   - Homer and Candy are sitting in the parked car in silence
(finally) There are no autonomic effects, just the paralysis of the lower extremities
Candy stares at him, uncomprehending
Wally can have kids, a normal sex life
Candy cries
- Ray is throwing snails in the water
Candy sits on the end of the dock, slumped on Homer's shoulder
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass
How about that
Daddy, *please*
Ray knows that she wants him to leave
He shuffles off the dock, toward the house
He knows how they both must feel
Good night, kids
Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already
Good night, Daddy
Good night, Ray
Homer tries to cuddle closer, but Candy sits up, preoccupied
Just tell me
'll do whatever you want to do
Nothing
Isn't that like waiting and seeing
No
Nothing is nothing
want Wally to come home
'm afraid to see him, too
know
(he kisses her) Is *that* nothing
No, don't--that's something
Nothing is nothing
(Homer's sad smile) Don't even look at me
want
Candy buries her face in his chest
to do nothing
Homer holds her, doing nothing, while she sobs
As her crying subsides, Homer's thoughts are far away
With Candy slumped against him, hugging him, he doesn't look at her; instead, he looks out to sea and at the darkening coast, Candy's words resonating
An unfamiliar expression is on his face
(mumbling to himself) It's a tempting idea,  know
to do nothing
Candy is silent
Homer feels strangely agitated; he shifts his position
(groans) Please don't move, don't go anywhere
(overly genuine) *Go* anywhere
Of course not
That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it
We wouldn't want to *do* something
Let's just sit here all night
(irritated) If you're trying to be funny, Homer
(irritated, too) 'm not trying to be anything--'m just doing nothing
If  wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- won't *ever* have to make up my mind
Decisions can be painful, after all
Candy is angry; she gets to her feet and stares hard at him
Stop it
Just cut it out
(mock surprise) You got up
You *did* something
If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*
For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down
Candy sobs
Homer puts his face in his hands for a minute
He regains his composure and stands up
(genuinely contrite) know, 'm sorry
(yelling and sobbing) He's *paralyzed*
(deadpan; just the facts) He's *alive*
He still loves you
(pause) So do
(anguished) What do you want me to *do*
He faces away from her
(with calm resolve) Nothing
You're not the one who has to do anything
- Homer is in semidarkness as he walks toward the cider house
(
) Where do you think you're going
(
) You gotta let me go, Daddy
Please
Homer walks faster
When he gets to the cider house, he sees Mr
Rose and Rose Rose arguing
Rose is sitting on the bicycle, a bundle of her clothes tied up behind the seat
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl
ain't your business no more, Daddy
Please let me go
Rose Rose starts to pedal away, but Mr
Rose stops her
She starts to struggle
Hey, hey
Stop it
Maybe  can help
They turn to see Homer
You just go inside, Homer
We don't need no help
That's right, Homer
This ain't your business
She tries to break free from her father and pedal away, but he stops her again
They keep struggling
Please listen to me
*Both* of you
You forget yourself, Homer
This here's my daughter
You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right
Homer steps between them, which makes Mr
Rose furious
(yelling) What business is you in, Homer
Mr
Rose, 'm in the *doctor* business
(to Rose Rose) If you want,  can help you
You don't have to go anywhere
Rose Rose and Mr
Rose stop struggling
Suddenly Homer is in charge
- Muddy, Hero and Peaches smoke in their beds
Rose Rose opens her curtain and peers out from her bed
She gets up and goes toward the kitchen area in her nightshirt; she stops at an unused bed, now covered with white rubber sheeting--Homer's medical instruments are displayed and ready
Homer finished scrubbing his hands in the sink
His surgical mask is loosely tied around his neck
Mr
Rose is looking at Homer's surgical instruments when Rose Rose joins him
(to Homer) What's that
What's it called
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points
One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps
There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right
Homer ignores him; he keeps naming his equipment
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'
Homer looks at Mr
Rose and Rose Rose
No *almost* about it--'m a doctor
Homer turns to Peaches, Hero, and Muddy
Get out of here, please
Muddy herds Peaches and Hero out of the bunkhouse
'm stayin', Homer
Okay
Then you can be of use
- Mr
Rose wears a surgical mask; he is sweating, even in the cold, and his eyes look stricken as he watches Homer, who is performing the abortion
Mr
Rose holds the ether cone over Rose Rose's face
He drips some ether from the bottle on the cone
Cut quickly for Rose Rose's etherized face
to Mr
Rose's eyes above his mask
to Homer working with his eyes trained on the speculum
- to Muddy and Peaches and Hero huddled under the overhanging roof in the rain
- Mr
Rose is having a hard time breathing
You better get some air
- The cider house in the rain
Mr
Rose staggers out; he stands there in the rain, trying to regain his composure
He starts to scream
Another angle: huddled under the overhanging roof, Muddy and Peaches and Hero are watching him
- Rose Rose, curled in a fetal position, listens to the rain on the roof
Candy sits on her bed beside her
She helps her to sit up, to drink a glass of water; then Rose Rose lies down again
Rose Rose's expression never changes while Candy talks to her
Mr
Rose lies in his bed in the exact same fetal position as his daughter; he too, is listening to Candy
Homer is putting away his instruments
The bleeding should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again
The cramps will ease up, almost entirely
The bleeding is usually much lighter in two days
As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal
Muddy enters the cider house from out of the storm
He glances at Candy and Rose Rose; then at Homer
Then he speaks to Mr
Rose
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy
told him that you all is sick
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today
Hero and Peaches, dripping wet, come inside
Peaches is standing next to the list of rules tacked to the kitchen support beam
Look at that
Them same damn rules is tacked up again
Homer has finished putting his instruments away
Why don't you put them damn rules in the wood stove, Peaches
As the men are murmuring their approval of this idea, Rose Rose interjects
want to hear what they are, first
The men groan, but Mr
Rose won't oppose his daughter on this subject--not this time
He just lies there
Homer, let me hear what they are
Homer begins to read
"One: Please don't smoke in bed
" We heard that one already, Homer
"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch
" That's the best place to eat lunch
"Three: Please--even if you are very hot--do not go up to the roof to sleep
" What do they think
They must think we're crazy
They think we're dumb niggers so we need dumb rules--that's what they think
This is the last one
The men groan, in mock disappointment
"Four: There should be no going up on the roof at night
" Why don't they just say, "Stay off the roof
"
Yeah, they don't want us up there *at all*
Homer crumples the list and throws it into the wood stove
(to Homer) That's *it*
That's it
It means nothin' at all
And all this time  been *wonderin'* about it
They're *outrageous*, them rules
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches
Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here
just breathin' in the vinegar
(he pauses) Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules
Them rules ain't for *us*
*We* the ones who make up them rules
We makin' our *own* rules, every day
Ain't that right, Homer
Right
Camera closes on Candy
/
'  - -  - Homer and Candy sit and stare at the blank screen; they don't look at each other
Candy grips the steering wheel of the parked car
Please don't make me say it again
No, that's not it-- just want to be sure  understand you
Candy slumps forward with her forehead on the steering wheel
*helped* you not to think about Wally
You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying
well, for a while, anyway
This is how  helped you, right
Please
that's enough
*loved* you, too--you know  did
"
did
" Well, okay
Please don't
(sarcastically) And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you
You say that as though it's some awful thing
(angrily) never stopped loving Wally
Homer lets that sink in
(still sarcastic) At least there's no more waiting and seeing
At least  got to see the ocean
Candy covers her face in her hands and cries uncontrollably, unstoppably
Homer's anger keeps him impervious to her tears-- another "first" for him
He turns and looks at her with an almost clinical curiosity; then he goes back to staring at the blank screen
-       - The rain has stopped but the grass is wet, the trees glistening in the dawn light as Wally's car stops and Homer gets out
The car exits the frame in one direction; Homer, walking, exits the frame in another
- As he walks toward the cider house, Homer sees Muddy and Peaches and Hero waving to him from the roof
Rose Rose has runned away
She took off in the night
She took off on the bicycle, man
Homer starts jogging, then running toward the cider house
Muddy comes down the ladder to meet him
- Rose Rose's bed is exposed
The curtains are flung open; her bed is empty
Mr
Rose is still in his bed, in the fetal position we have seen before
Mr
Rose's trancelike expression doesn't change as Homer and Muddy enter
Ain't nobody gonna find her, Homer-- she's long gone
(pause) swear,  didn't try and stop her-- just wanna touch her hand before she go
That's all  wanna do, swear
(pause) Where'd she get that knife, Muddy
That looked like *your* knife--what seen of it
Muddy is scared; he looks to Homer for advice
If that was your knife, Muddy, wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her
(seeing the blood) Where'd she get you
She just plan misunderstand me-- was tryin' to give her my knife, was just reachin' to touch her hand
But  understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right
Homer takes the blanket off him; Muddy gasps
Homer tries to examine Mr
Rose's wound
Mr
Rose smiles at him
It's too late for the doctor now, Homer--ain't that right
Homer doesn't answer; he knows Mr
Rose is a goner
(proudly) She's *good* with that knife
She's real fast
She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy
And who do you suppose taught her
*You* taught her,  suppose
That's right
girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she
He winces in pain at Homer's examination
(surprised) There's more than one laceration, more than one cut
That's 'cause  sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, sticked my *own* knife in there poked it all around,  just tryin' to find the same place she got me
Homer finds Mr
Rose's knife
There's blood everywhere
You listen to me: you tell them police how this happen, you tell it *this* way, you hear
My daughter, she runned off--and  so sad about it that stabbed myself
so unhappy that she gone,  killed myself--that what you say, you hear
That the true story--ain't that right
Homer and Muddy exchange a glance
Mr
Rose, with his blood- soaked hand, suddenly grabs Homer by the throat
Let me hear you say that
so unhappy she runned away that  killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right
Right
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself
That's what we say, all right
That's right
know you understand how  feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too
Ain't that right
Mr
Rose dies
Muddy turns away
Homer closes Mr
Rose's eyes
,  - Muddy and Hero and Peaches are sitting close together on the roof, like banished children
It is from their perspective that we see the police car and the ambulance--two men carrying the body out of the cider house, and a cop or two talking to Homer and Olive, and Homer talking to them
We hear no dialogue
- Homer and the men load crates of apple jelly onto a truck
The mood is solemn; they work with tired focus
Candy drives up
The men are evasive with her; they find a reason to work across the mart
Candy walks to Homer, stands next to him
They say nothing for a moment, until Candy breaks the silence
Do you think she'll be all right
She knows how to take care of herself
Candy looks away; she can't think of what to say
She shoves her hands into her pockets, finds a letter there, which she hands to Homer
This came for you a couple of days ago
Olive asked me to bring it
With everything happening,  guess she forgot
Sure
Thanks
Homer looks at the letter from St
Cloud's; he puts it unopened in his pocket without a second thought
Candy can't let things end there
know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter
'm sorry for what  said about Wally needing you
It was
unnecessary
No, 'm the one who should be sorry
You have every right to be angry
No
You warned me
didn't listen, but you warned me
Candy looks surprised
You told me you weren't any good at being alone
(pause) You told Wally, too
Right
Candy can only stare straight ahead
(relenting) He's going to be fine, Wally's going to be fine
know he is
tear rolls down Candy's cheek, Homer wipes it away; then he stops touching her and looks off into the quiet orchards
- The pickers lie in their beds, smoking
Homer is undressing
He pulls the letter out of his pocket and sits down on his bed
Homer opens the letter without enthusiasm and begins to read
(
) Dear Homer,  am writing to tell you about Wilbur
- Music is playing on the old phonograph as an exhausted Larch gives himself ether
'  - Edna is getting the girls ready for bed
Music continues Over
- Larch has twisted himself on the narrow bed so that his face is unusually close to the windowsill, and when the ether cone starts to fall off his face--and his slack hand trails down, off the side of the bed--the cone becomes caught against the windowsill
He tries to turn his face away from the cone, but he presses his face into the sill--thus holding the ether-soaked cone over his mouth and nose
His hands twitch, he's trying to wake up; the hand that holds the ether bottle lets the bottle fall
The bottle shatters against the sill; the ether spreads, running red with blood from a cut on Dr
Larch's hand or finger
Music continues Over
It's a funeral
- Buster is bringing in the wood as the music plays Over
Buster smells the spilled ether
He heads toward the dispensary, sniffing
Camera follows him into the dispensary
In the dispensary: Buster approaches Larch's ether-bed
Dr
Larch
Dr
Larch
He drops the armload of wood and runs for help
- Angela enters
She feels for Larch's pulse; Larch is dead
Angela opens a window
She pull's Larch's body away from the windowsill
Buster joins her on the bed
(
) can assure you that the overdose was entirely accidental
- Homer finishes reading the letter; he puts it down, gets up, and walks to a window
He stares into the night
(
) Let us be happy for Dr
Larch
Dr
Larch has found a family
(
) Good night, Dr
Larch
Good night, Dr
Larch
Good night, Dr
Larch
Homer wipes a tear off his cheek
'  - /  - The truck is packed for the long trip south; it passes by the packing house, which looks closed for the season
No one else is about
Muddy is driving slowly, his arm out the open window
In the back, huddled among their belongings, are Peaches and Hero (on one side) and Homer (on the other)
The pickers are trying to draw Homer into their conversation, while Homer is giving the apple farm a good-bye look
He has made up his mind about something
You ever see a palm tree, Homer
He ain't never been outta Maine
Ain't you sick of pine trees, Homer
Homer just smiles and shakes his head
,  - As the pickers' truck drives past, Homer is on the side of the truck nearest the Worthington house and driveway; he sees Olive and Candy and Ray helping Wally out of the car and into a wheelchair
stands by
Wally is wearing what appears to be an oversized officer's coat or flight jacket, his face looking small in the overlarge clothes
He can't move his legs at all, and his mouth is drawn into a tight-lipped smile
(
) Let me tell you somethin' about Florida, Homer
(
) The Sunshine State
(
) It's so nice 'n' warm down there, you can pick them grapefruits and oranges *naked*, if you want to
Olive is dissolved in tears
Candy is sobbing; she kisses Wally, without ceasing, while he haltingly touches her face, her hair
In the truck the smile is gone from Homer's face
He shakes his head
Thanks, guys
'd like to go with you
But 've got to move on
Yeah, well
you could move on with *us*, man
You could move on somewhere *warm*
Homer, stayin' in Maine ain't movin' on
This makes all the pickers laugh, but Homer just smiles and shakes his head
He watches the Worthington house disappear from view
-   - , taking tickets, comes to Homer, who is better dressed than we've ever seen him; he is looking at his sober reflection in the black window-glass of the night train when the conductor gets his attention
When the conductor moves on, Homer takes Angela's letter out of his breast pocket; he skips ahead to the end
(
) Dr
Larch often wondered how the world was treating you
' -  - (
) He talked a lot about you, hoping you would be of use, whatever you were up to
Angela and Buster and Mary Agnes and Edna carry Larch's coffin; they set it down by the raw hole
The pile of fresh dirt stands out against the new snow; the hole is black against the new white
(
) "Oh, Lord, support us all the day long
" We see the wheelbarrow with the gravestone
(
) "
until the shadows lengthen and the evening comes, and the busy world is hushed, and the fever of life is over, and our work is done
" '  - We see the faces of the girls praying for Larch (Mary Agnes, too) as Edna finishes her favorite prayer
"Then, in Thy mercy grant us a safe lodging, and a holy rest, and peace at the last
" -   - Camera closes on Homer, sleeping to the sound of the rocking train
Angela's letter lies in his lap
(
) Amen
Amen
Amen
' -   - The train stops, blowing snow
Homer steps off the train carrying a suitcase and Dr
Larch's bag
The disapproving stationmaster is still disapproving
Music plays Over, something triumphant
' -   - Homer makes his way up the hill toward the orphanage
Music Over
- Edna is breaking up fights; this time, instead of fighting over snowballs, the orphans are fighting over their pumpkins
Suddenly Homer tops the brow of the hill and they all see him
Buster is the first to catch sight of Homer; he runs toward him
Mary Agnes also sees Homer; she immediately turns away and runs inside
Music   Over
- Mary Agnes crashes into the bathroom and stumbles up to the mirror; she starts to fix herself up with shaking hands
,   - Everyone has heard the news; they come on the run
The children flock around Homer, hugging him
Homer takes Angela and Edna in his arms
Mary Agnes joins the group
Homer takes in how changed, how attractive she is
They smile awkwardly at each other
'  - Homer's suitcase is open on the bed; we see Homer's hands as he begins to unpack
Smaller hands reach in and root through the clothes
(
) Did you bring something for me
Curly continues his search
Homer thinks for a second; then reaches into his pocket and pulls out the piece of pale-green glass
You know what
did
Homer hands the piece of glass to Curly
It's from the ocean
It's for you
Curly is duly impressed; he walks away to examine his new treasure
Homer continues unpacking
He pulls his  ray out and puts it aside
What are you doing here
Homer turns to see Buster, Mary Agnes, Angela, and Edna in the doorway
We made up a room for you
Wouldn't you be more comfortable by yourself
Homer smiles; he nods
Angela and Mary Agnes start to put Homer's things back in his bag
Edna picks up the  ray and looks at it with a somber expression
Homer, do you know what this is
Sure
It's my heart
(shakes her head) Actually, it's Fuzzy's
There's nothing wrong with your heart
Fuzzy's
Dr
Larch wanted to keep you out of the war, Homer--that's why he did it
That's why he told you it was yours
Homer is stunned; he puts his hand to his heart
think he worried about his own heart
He said it would never stand up to Homer Wells going off to war
Homer takes that in; he nods
Mary Agnes touches him sympathetically
'  - Homer looks at his fake diplomas; they are now framed and hanging on the office wall
Homer surveys the office, as if for the first time; he sits down in the desk chair, as if slowly getting used to his new position
'  - Homer reads to the boys from "David Copperfield"
While his voice is strong--positive, optimistic, certainly reassuring to the boys--there is in the conclusion of the chapter something that distracts him
He seems to hesitate; he misses a line or two, and perhaps he purposely skips one or two others
(Possibly Homer's eyes wander ahead, to the title of the next chapter: " Make Another Beginning
") "Thus  began my new life, in a new name, and with everything new about me
felt
like one in a dream
The remembrance of that life is fraught with so much
want of hope
Whether it lasted for a year, or more, or less,  do not know only know that it was, and ceased to be; and
there  leave it
" Homer stops and looks at the boys' faces
What happens next
Homer smiles
That's tomorrow, Curly
Let's mot give the story away
Homer puts out the lights and leaves the boys in the familiar semi-darkness
Seconds, later, the closed door to the hall is flung open, flooding the room with light from the hall, and Homer, dressed in his long white laboratory coat and looking every inch the doctor, delivers his best imitation of Larch's popular blessing
Good night, you Princes of Maine
You Kings of New England
On Copperfield and Steerforth and Curly as the door to the hall is closed and semi-darkness prevails in the room again
Copperfield, smiling, shuts his eyes
After a second, the wide-eyed Steerforth shuts his eyes, too
Then Curly
The last to close his eyes is Buster
