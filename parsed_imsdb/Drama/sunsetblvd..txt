Gillis is typing
with a pencil clenched bet- ween his teeth

There are a couple of worn-out plush chairs and a Spanish-style, wrought-iron standing lamp
Also a small desk littered with books and letters, and a chest of drawers with a portable phonograph and some records on top
On the walls are a couple of repro- ductions of characterless paintings, with laundry bills and snapshots stuck in the frames
Through an archway can he seen a tiny kitchenette, complete with unwashed coffee pot and cup, empty tin cans, orange peels, etc
The effect is dingy and cheerless -- just another furnished apartment
The buzzer
Yeah
The buzzer  again
Gillis gets up and opens the door
Two men wearing hats stand outside one of them carrying a briefcase

noise as some loose change and keys drop from the trouser pockets
As Gillis bends over to pick them up, we see that he has dropped the car keys, identifiable be- cause of a rabbit's foot and a miniature license plate attached to the key-ring
Gillis pockets the keys and as he starts to put on a shirt : -9       '                   ' () knew they'd be coming small shack-like build-     around and  wasn't tak- ing, it stands in the         ing any chances, so corner of a public park-      kept it a couple of ing lot

His Paramount
few loafers,    name was Sheldrake
He studio cops and extras are    was a smart producer, lounging there
with a set of ulcers to prove it
: -11    ' It is in the style of a Paramount executive's office -- mahogany, leather, and a little chintz
On the walls are some large framed photographs of Paramount stars, with dedications to Mr
Sheldrake
Also a couple of framed critics' awards certificates, and an Oscar on a bookshelf
shooting schedule chart is thumb-tacked into a large bulletin board
There are piles or scripts, a few pipes and, somewhere in the background, some set models
Start on Sheldrake
He is about 45
Behind his wor- ried face there hides a coated tongue
He is en- gaged in changing the stained rilter cigarette in his Zeus holder
All right, Gillis
You've got five minutes
What's your story about
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347
The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up
But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh
More or less
Only for the end 've got a gimmick that's real good
secretary enters, carrying a glass or milk
She opens a drawer and takes out a bottle of pills for Sheldrake
Got a title
Bases Loaded
There's a 4O-page outline
(To the secretary) Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded
The secretary exits
Sheldrake takes a pill and washes it down with some milk
They're pretty hot about it over at Twentieth, but think Zanuck's all wet
Can you see Ty Power as a (cont'd) shortstop
You've got the best man for it right here on this lot
Alan Ladd
Good change of pace for Alan Ladd
There's another thing: it's pretty simple to shoot
Lot of outdoor stuff
Bet you could make the whole thing for under a million
And there's a great little part for Bill Demarest
One of the trainers, an oldtime player who got beaned and goes out of his head sometimes
The door opens and Betty Schaefer enters -- a clean- cut, nice looking girl of 21, with a bright, alert manner
Dressed in tweed skirt, Brooks sweater and pearls, and carrying a folder of papers
She puts them on Sheldrake's desk, not noticing Gillis, who stands near the door
Hello, Mr
Sheldrake
On that Bases Loaded
covered it with a 2-page synopsis
(She holds it out) But  wouldn't bother
What's wrong with it
It's from hunger
Nothing for Ladd
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with
'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr
Gillis
He wrote it
Betty turns towards Gillis, embarrassed
This is Miss Kramer
Schaefer
Betty Schaefer
And right now  wish  could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me
If  could be of any help
'm sorry, Mr
Gillis, but just don't think it's any good
found it flat and banal
Exactly what kind of material do you recommend
James Joyce
Dostoosvsky
Name dropper
just think pictures should say a little something
Oh, you're one of the message kids
Just a story won't do
You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind
No, that was me
said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture
Perhaps the reason  hated Bases Loaded is that  knew your name
'd always heard you had some talent
That was last year
This year 'm trying to earn a living
So you take Plot 27-, make it glossy, make it slick -- Carefull Those are dirty words
You sound like a bunch of New York critics
Thank you, Miss Schaefer
Goodbye, Mr
Gillis
Goodbye
Next time 'll write The Naked and the Dead
Betty leaves
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture
Mr
Sheldrake,  don't want you to think  thought this was going to win any Academy Award
(His mind free-wheeling) Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton
Do you see it as a Betty Hutton
Frankly, no
(Amusing himself) Now wait a minute
If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers
Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman
You trying to be funny
-- because 'm all out of laughs
'm over a barrel and  need a job
Sure, Gillis
If something should come along - Along is no good
need it now
Haven't got a thing
Any kind of assignment
Additional Dialogue
There's nothing, Gillis
Not even if you were a relative
(Hating it) Look, Mr
Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan
Could
Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley
So  borrowed money from the bank so  could pay for the ranch
This year  had to mortgage the ranch so  could keep up my life insurance so  could borrow on the insurance so  could pay my income tax
Now if Dewey had been elected - Goodbye, Mr
Sheldrake

To me they said no
Finally located that agent of mine, the big faker
Was he out digging up a job for poor Joe Gillis
Hmph
He was hard at work in Bel Air, making with the golf clubs
Gillis hangs up with a curse, opens the door of the booth, emerges, wiping the sweat from his forehead
He walks toward the exit
He is stopped by the voice of Hello, Gillis
Gillis looks around
At the fountain sits Skolsky, drinking a cup of coffee
Hello, Mr
Skolsky
Got anything for the column
Sure
Just sold an original for a hundred grand
The Life of the Warner Brothers
Starring the Ritz Brothers
Playing opposite the Andrew Sisters
(With a sour smile) But don't get me wrong --  love Hollywood
Gillis walks out
: -14 On a sun-dappled green edged with tall sycamores, stands Morino, the agent, a caddy and a nondescript opponent in the background
Gillis has evidently stated his problem already
So you need three hundred dollars
Of course,  could give you three hundred dollars
Only 'm not going to
No
Gillis, get this through your head
'm not just your agent
It's not the ten per cent
'm your friend
He sinks his putt and walks toward the next tee, Gillis following him
How's that about your being my friend
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach
Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through
Forget Romanoff's
It's the car 'm talking about
If  lose my car it's like having my legs out off
Greatest thing that could happen to you
Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter
Now you'll have to write
What do you think 've been doing

(Icily) Maybe what you need is another agent
He bends down to tee up his ball
Gillis turns away

Apparently just didn't have what it takes, and the time had come to wrap up the whole Hollywood deal and go home
Maybe if  hocked all my junk there'd be enough for a bus ticket back to Ohio, back to that thirty-five- dollar-a-week job behind the copy desk of the Dayton Evening Post, if it was still open
Back to the smirking delight of the whole office

Maybe you think Suddenly his eyes fall   you could -- Oh-oh
on: -16 It is a dark-green Dodge business coupe, also waiting for the light to change
but headed in the opposite direction
In it are the two finance company men
They spot Gillis in his car and exchange looks
From across the intersection Gillis recognizes them and pulls down the leather sunshade to screen his face
As the light changes
Gillis gives his car the gun and shoots away
The men narrowly avoid hitting another car as they make a -turn into oncoming traffic and start after him

The men lose Gillis around a bend, catch sight of him and then -- while they are trapped behind a slow- moving truck
he disappears again
-22 He is driving as fast as he dares, keeping an eye out for pursuit in his rear-view mirror
Suddenly his right front tire blows out
Gillis clutches desperately at the steering wheel and manages to turn the careening car into -23 It is overgrown with weeds and screened from the street by bushes and trees
Gillis stops his car about thirty feet from the street and looks back

' You there
Gillls turns and looks
-28 Behind a bamboo blind there is a movement of a dark figure
' Wlly are you so late
Why have you kept me waitlng so long
-29 He stands flabbergasted
new noise attracts his attention -- the creak of a heavy metal-and-glass door being opened
He turns and sees -3O Max von Mayerling stands there
He is sixty, and all in black, except for immaculate white cotton gloves, shirt, high, stiff collar and a white bow tie
His coat is shiny black alpaca, his trousers ledger-atriped
He is semi-paralyzed
The left side of his mouth is pulled down, and he leans on a rubber-ferruled stick
In here
Gillis enters the shot
just put my car in the garage
had a blow-out
thought -- Go on in
There is authority in the gesture of his white- gloved hand as he motions Gillis inside
Look, maybe 'd better take my car -- Wipe your feet
Automatically, Gillis wipes his feet on an enormous shabby cocoanut mat
You are not dressed properly
Dressed for what
' Max
Have him come up, Max
(Gesturing) Up the stairs
Suppose you listen just for a minute - Madame is waiting
For me
Okay
Gillis enters
-31
' It is grandiose and grim
The whole place is one of those abortions of silent-picture days, with bowling alleys in the cellar and a built-in pipe organ, and beams imported from Italy, with California termites at work on them
Portieres are drawn before all the windows, and only thin slits or sunlight find their way in to fight the few electric bulbs which are always burning
Gillis starts up the curve of the black marble staircase
It has a wrought-iron rail and a worn velvet rope along the wall
(From below) If you need help with the coffin call me
The oddity of the situation has caught Gillis' imagination
He climbs the stairs with a kind of morbid fascination
At the top he stops, undecided, then turns to the right and is stopped by ' This way
Gillis swings around
Norma Desmond stands down the corridor next to a doorway from which emerges a flickering light
She is a little woman
There is a curious style, a great sense of high voltage about her
She is dress- ed in black house pyjamas and black high-heeled pumps
Around her throat there is a leopard-pat- terned scarf, and wound around her head a turban of the same material
Her skin is very pale, and she is wearing dark glasses
In here
put him on my massage table in front of the fire
He always liked fires and poking at them with a stick
Gillis enters the  and she leads him into -32     ' It is a huge, gloomy room hung in white brocade which has beconle dirty over the years and even slightly torn in a few places
There's a great, unmade gilded bed in the shape of a swan, from which the gold had begun to peel
There is a disorder of clothes and negligees and faded photographs of old-time stars about
In an imitation baroque fireplace some logs are burn- ing
On the massage table before it lies a small form shrouded under a Spanish shawl
At each end on a baroque pedestal stands a three-branched cande- labrum, the candles lighted
've made up my mind we'll bury him in the garden
Any city laws against that
wouldn't know
don't care anyway
want the coffin to be white
And  want it specially lined with satin
White, or deep pink
She picks up the shawl to make up her mind about the color
From under the shawl flops down a dead arm
Gillis stares and recoils a little
It is like a child's arm, only black and hairy
Maybe red
bright flaming red
Gay
Let's make it gay
Gillis edges closer and glances down
Under the shawl he sees the sad, bearded face of a dead chimpanzee
Norma drops back the shawl
How much will it be
warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because 'm rich
Lady
you've got the wrong man
For the first time
Norma really looks at him through her dark glasses
had some trouble with my car
Flat tire
pulled into your garage till  could get a spare
thought this was an empty house
It is not
Get out
'm sorry, and 'm sorry you lost your friend, and  don't think red is the right color
Get out
Sure
Wait a minute -- haven't seen you --
Or shall  call my servant
know your face
You're Norma Desmond
You used to be in pictures
You used to be big
am big
It's the pictures that got small
knew there was something wrong with them
They're dead
They're finished
There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world
But that wasn't good enough
Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too
So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk
That's where the popcorn business comes in
You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds
They took the idols and smashed them
The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos
And who have they got now
Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl Don't get sore at me
'm not an executive
'm just a writer
You are
Writing words, words
You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue
Ssh
You'll wake up that monkey
Get out
Gillis starts down the stairs
Next time 'll bring my autograph album along, or maybe a hunk of cement and ask for your footprints
He is halfway down the staircase when he is stopped by Just a minute, you
Yeah
You're a writer, you said
Why
Norma starts down the stairs
Are you or aren't you
think that's what it says on my driver's license
And you have written pictures, haven't you
Sure have
The last one wrote was about cattle rustlers
Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat
Norma has reached him at the bottom of the staircase
want to ask you something
Come in here
She leads him into -33 It is dark and damp and filled with black oak and red velvet furniture which looks like crappy props from the Mark of Zorro set
Along the main wall, a gigantic fireplace has been freezing for years
On the gold piano is a galaxy of photographs of Norma Desmond in her various roles
On one wall is a painting -- a California Gold Rush scene, Carthay Circle school
(We will learn later that it hides a motion picture screen
) One corner is filled with a large pipe organ, and as Norma and Gillis enter, there is a grizzly moaning sound
Gillis looks around
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ
ought to have it taken out
Or teach it a better tune
Norma has led him to the card tables which stand side by side near a window
They are piled high with papers scrawled in a large, uncertain hand
How long is a movie script these days
mean, how many pages
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc
This is to be a very important picture
have written it myself
Took me years
(Looking at the piles of script) Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures
It's the story or Salome think 'll have DeMille direct it
Uh-huh
We've made a lot of pictures together
And you'll play Salome
Who else
Only asking
did't know you were planning a comeback
hate that word
It is a return
return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen
Fair enough
Salome -- what a woman
What a part
The Princess in love with a Holy man
She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils
He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips
They'll love it in Pomona
(Taking it straight) They will love it every place
(She reaches for a batch of pages from the heap) Read it
Read the scene just before she has him killed
Right now
Never let another writer read your stuff
He may steal it
am not afraid
Read it

Max

Is there enough light

Max has entered
Bring something to drink
Yes

There is compulsion in her voice
Gillis looks at her                   ' and starts slowly          Well

Later, on her forefinger with     found out that Max was the a clip which holds a       only other person in that cigarette
She gets up    grim Sunset castle, and and forces on Gillis       found out a few other things another batch of script,   about him
As for her, she goes back to her chair
sat coiled up like a watch spring, her cigarette clamped in a curious holder
could sense her eyes on me from behind those dark glasses, defying me not to like what  read, or maybe begging me in her own proud way to like it
It meant so much to her

to include Norma Desmond sitting in the dusk, just as she was before
Gillis puts down a batch of script
There is a little pause
(Impatiently) Well
This is fascinating
Of course it is
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions
but you're not a professional writer
wrote that with my heart
Sure you did
That's what makes it great
What it needs is a little more dialogue
What for

It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil
will not have it butchered
Of course not
But it ought to be organized
Just an editing job
You can find somebody
Who
'd have to have somebody can trust
When were you born -- mean, what sign of the zodiac
don't know
What month
December twenty-first

like Sagittarians
You can trust them
Thank you
want you to do this work
Me
'm busy
Just finished one script
'm due on another assignment
don't care
You know, 'm pretty expensive
get five hundred a week
wouldn't worry about money
'll make it worth your while
Maybe 'd better take the rest of the script home and read it - Oh no
couldn't let it out of my house
You'll have to finish it here
It's getting kind of late -- Are you married, Mr
--
The name is Gillis
'm single
Where do you live
Hollywood
The Alto Nido Apart- ments
There's something wrong with your car, you said
There sure is
You can stay here
'll come early tomorrow
Norma takes off her glasses
Nonsense
There's room over the garage
Max will take you there
Max
' ' ,   She sure could say a lot of right up to her        things with those pale eyes of eyes
hers
They'd been her trade mark
They'd made her the Num- ber One Vamp of another era remember a rather florid des- cription in an old fan magazine which said: "Her eyes are like two moonlit waterholes, where strange animals come to drink

And there should be plenty of money in it
Max pushes open a door at the top of the stairs
(Opening the door) made your bed this afternoon
Thanks
(On second thought) How did you know  was going to stay, this afternoon
Max doesn't answer
He walks across to the bed, screws a bulb in the open socket above it
The light goes on, revealing: -37 There are dirty windows on two sides, and dingy wall- paper on the cracked plaster walls
For furniture there is a neatly made bed, a table and a few chairs which might have been discarded from the main house
This room has not been used for a long time
It will never make house Beautiful

for one night
Max gives him an enigmatic look
(Pointing) There is the bathroom

Thanks
(He starts taking off his coat) Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond
She was the greatest
You wouldn't know
You are too young
In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters
Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails
There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings

Then, Norma lighting his task with the candelabrum, Max takes a spade from the loose earth and starts filling in the grave

Gillis moves a heavy overstuffed chair in front of the door, then walks towards the bed, throws himself on it, picking up some of the manuscript pages to read

He jumps out of bed
He wears, shirt, trousers and socks
Suddenly he realizes that all his possessions have                  ' been brought in
In        What was going on
the closet hang his shirts
His books and typewriter are neatly arranged on the table
His phonograph-radio combination is all installed
Gillis looks around startled, then sits down and starts putting on his moccasins hastily
: -7          , : They belong to Max von Mayerling
He is sitting erect, his bull neck taut as a wrestler's as he rights out somber chord after somber chord
He sits in a shaft of gray light coming from an open French window
Through the far archway, Gillis storms into the big room
Hey, you -- Max -- whatever -your- name-is -- what are my things doing here
No answer
'm talking to you
My clothes and things are up in the room
Naturally
brought them myself
(Furiously) Is that so
Why are you so upset
Is there anything missing

Who asked you to
Norma Desmond's shadow moves into the shaft of light

Gillis looks around
On the couch by the fireplace reclines Norma Desmond, dressed in a negligee
She rises
don't know why you should be so upset
Stop that playing, Max
(To Gillis again) It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together
Look, 'm supposed to fix up your script
There's nothing in the deal about my staying here
You'll like it here
Thanks for the invitation, but have my own apartment
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent
'll take care of that
It's all taken care of
It's all paid for

You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties

We'll deduct it from my salary

Good

Gillis doesn't know what to do

Gillis wears a double-breasted gray flannel coat with chalk stripes
His trousers belong to another suit of glen plaid
Norma is running the show
There's nothing like gray flannel with a chalk stripe

Let's see what you have in camel's hair

How about some evening clothes

Tails
That's ridiculous
You'll need them for parties
You'll need them for New Year's Eve

He leads her off
The other salesman arrives with a selection of topcoats
Here are some camel hairs, but 'd like you just to feel this one

He puts down the typewriter and picks up from under the bed a pair of very smart red leather bedroom slippers
He tucks them under his arm, picks up the typewriter and leaves
: -3        TIiE It is obviously a man's room -- heavy Spanish furniture -- one wall nothing but a closet with shelves and drawers for shirts and shoes
Max is hanging up the suits
Gillis throws the shirts on a big chair, tosses the slippers at the foot of the bed, places the typewriter and manuscript on a desk at the window
Whose room was this
It was the room of the husband
Or of the husbands,  should say
Madame has been married three times
Slightly embarrassed, Gillis picks up his toilet kit with razor, toothbrushes, soap, etc
, and starts towards the bathroom, pausing en route at a rain- splattered window
guess this is the one you can see Catalina from
Only this isn't the day
He proceeds towards the half-opened door leading to the bathroom
Something strikes his attention and he stops
As in the door to the room above the garage, this lock, too, has been gouged out
Hey, what's this with the door
There isn't any lock
There are no locks anywhere in this house
He points to the entrance door of the room, and to another door
How come
The doctor suggested it
What doctor
Madame's doctor
She has moments of melancholy
There have been some suicide attempts
Uh-huh
We have to be very careful
No sleeping pills, no razor blades
We shut off the gas in her bed- room
Why
Her career
She got enough out of it
She's not forgotten
She still gets those fan letters
wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks
You send them
Is that it, Max
'd better press your evening clothes, sir
You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party
No,  haven't
suppose all the waxworks are coming
don't know, sir
Madame made the arrangements
Max leaves
Gillis comes out of the bathroom, picks up his shirts, goes over to a closet, opens it
As he does so one of the doors without a lock swings slightly open
Gillis looks through the half-open door and sees
-4      ' It is empty
The rainy            ' day does nothing to        There it was again - that help its gloom
room of hers, all satin and ruffles, and that bed like a gilded rowboat
The per- fect setting for a silent movie queen
Poor devil, still waving proudly to a parade which had long since passed her by
He pushes the door shut and walks back into the room
: -5 () Gillis is coming down the         ' stairs in his tailcoat        It was at her New Year's adjusting the handkerchief    party that  found out in his pocket
He obviously  how she felt about me
feels a little uneasy in      Maybe 'd been an idiot this outfit
From below      not to have sensed it comes a tango of the Twen-    was coming - that sad, ties
played by a small      embarrassing revelation
orchestra
Gillis stops in the archway leading to the big room and looks around
-6        has been deco- rated for the occasion with laurel garlands
Dozens of candles in all the sconces and candelabra are ablaze
Their flickering flames are reflected in the waxed sur= face of the tile floor
There is a buffet, with buckets of champagne and caviar on ice
In one corner on a little platform banked with palms
a four-piece orchestra is playing
At the buffet are Max and Norma
She is drinking a glass of champagne
She is wearing a diamonte evening dress
very high style
with long black gloves and a headdress of paradise feathers
Her eyes fall on Gillis
She puts down the glass of champagne
picks up a gardenia boutonniere and moves toward him
Joe,  you look absolutely divine
Turn around
(Embarrassed} Please
Come on
Gillis makes a slow 36O-degree turn
Perfect
Wonderful shoulders
And  love that line
She indicates the  from his shoulders to his hips
All padding
Don't let it fool you
Come here
She puts the gardenia on his lapel
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit
don't like those studs they've sent
want you to have pearls
Nice big pearls
Now, 'm not going to wear ear- rings,  can tell you that
Cute
Let's have some drinks
She leads him over to the buffet
Shouldn't we wait for the others
(Pointing at the floor) Careful, it's slippery had it waxed
They reach the buffet
Max is ready with two glasses of champagne
Norma hands Gillis a glass
Here's to us
They drink
You know, this floor used to be wood but  had it changed
Valentino said there is nothing like tiles for a tango
She opens her arms
Not on the same floor with Valentino
Just follow me
They start to tango
After a moment -- Don't bend back like that
It's those feathers
They tickle
Norma pulls the paradise feathers from her hair and tosses them away
-7 As they play the tango, the musicians eye the danc- ing couple, take in the situation, exchange glances and turn away with professional discretion
-8       , Gillis glances at his wrist watch
It's a quarter past ten
What time are they supposed to get here
Who
The other guests
There are no other guests
We don't want to share this night with other people
This is for you and me
understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself
He was afraid of catching cold
Hold me tighter
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head
You think this is all very funny
little
Is it funny that 'm in love with you
What's that
'm in love with you
Don't you know that
've been in love with you all along
They dance on
Gillis is acutely embarrassed
,  past the faces of the musicians, who play on with a rather overe- mphasized lack of interest
Finally it winds up on Max, behind the buffet
He stands watching Gillis, a faint trace of pity in his eyes
: -9     ' , , as she          ' inserts a cigarette
'm sure a lot of you will laugh about this
Ridicu- lous situation, wasn't it
-- a woman almost twice my age
It got to be about a quarter of eleven felt caught, like a cig- arette in the prongs of that contraption on her finger
: sitting on a couch in front of the cavernous fireplace
Norma holds out her cigarette to Gillis, who lights it
What a wonderful next year it's going to be
What fun we're going to have
' fill the pool for you
Or 'll open my house in Malibu, and you can have the whole ocean
Or 'll buy you a boat and we'll sail to Hawaii
Stop it
You aren't going to buy me anything more
Don't be silly
(She reaches under a pillow of the couch and brings out a leather box) Here
was going to give it to you at midniglht
Gillis opens the box
It contains a matched gold cigarette case and lighter
Read what's inside
Gillis snaps open the case
Engraved inside the cover is:    , and two bars of music
What are the notes
"Mad about the boy
" Norma,  can't take it
You've bought me enough
Shut up
'm rich
'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash
've got a million dollars
Keep it
own three blocks downtown
have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping
What's it for but to buy us anything we want
Cut out that us business
He rises
What's the matter with you
What right do you have to take me for granted
What right
Do you want me to tell you
Has it ever occurred that  may have a life of my own
That there may be some girl 'm crazy about
Who
Some car hop, or a dress extra
Why not
What 'm trying to say is that 'm all wrong for you
You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot -- (Getting up slowly) What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you
Is that it
Gillis doesn't answer
Norma slaps his face and rushes from the room and upstairs
Gillis stands paralyzed, the slap burning his cheek
-1O Norma rushes up the last few steps, down the corridor and into her bedroom, banging the door toward the closed door, centering on the gouged-out lock
-11    , He still stands motionless
He glances around fur- tively, to see if his humiliation has been observed
-12 The musicians are playing away
They have turned their eyes away from Gillis rather too ostentatious- ly for comfort
-13 His eyes move over toward -14 He is subtler than the musicians
He appears very busy at the buffet, putting empty bottles and used glasses on a tray
He walks across the room with them
-15 He starts slowly out
As he does so his long gold key chain catches on a carved ornament of the sofa and holds him for a second of additional embarrass- ment
He yanks it loose and walks with as much nonchalance as he can muster to -16 Crossing towards the coat closet, Gillis throws a look upstairs
Then he pulls the Vicuna coat from its hangar and slips into it as he crosses to the entrance door
He opens the door on the darkness of the courtyard
-17 ( - ) Gillis shuts the door
' He takes a few steps        didn't know where  was forward, then stands       going
just had to get for a while breathing      out of there
had to be deep
The rain is         with people my own age balm to that cheek         had to hear somebody laugh where the slap still a     again

He walks for-      Green
There was bound to ward with a great          be a New Year's shindig sense of relief
going on in his apartment down on Las Palmas -- the hock shop set -- not a job -18              in the room
but lots of fun on the cuff
Gillis walks to the street, which is dark and empty
He starts down Sunset in an Easterly direction
car passes
He tries to thumb a ride, without success
However, the second car, a florist's delivery wagon, stops
Gillis jumps in and the car drives off
: -19     ' It is the most modest one-room affair, jam packed with young people flowing over into the miniature bathroom and the microscopic kitchenette
The only drink being served is punch from a pressed-glass bowl -- but everybody is having a hell of a time
Most of the men are in slacks and sweaters, and only a few of the girls in something that vaguely suggests party dress
Abe Burroughs sits at a small, guest-festooned piano and sings Tokio Rose
By the door, a group of young men and girls respond to the song by sing1ng Rinso White or Dentyne Chewing Gum or something similar, in the manner of a Bach choral
Artie Green, a dark haired, pleasant-looking guy in his late twenties, is conducting with the ladle from the punch bowl
The door behind some of the singers is pushed open, jostling them out of their places
In comes Gillis, his hair and face wet, the collar of his Vicuna coat turned up
Artie stops conducting, but the commer- cial goes right on
Well, what do you know
Joe Gillis
Hi, Artie
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours
In a deep freeze
almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons
(To the company) Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect
Gillis greets some of the kids by name as he and Artie push their way into the room
Give me your coat
Let it ride for a while
You're going to stay, aren't you
That was the general idea
Come on
Artie starts peeling the coat off Gillis
Its texture takes his breath away
What is this - mink
He has taken the coat
He looks at Gillis standing there in tails
Judas
Priest, who did you borrow that from
Adolphe Menjou
Close, but no cigar
Gillis stands embarrassed While Artie rolls up the Vicuna coat and tucks it above the books on a book- shelf
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you
Where's the bar
The two make their way toward the punch bowl
It's a little like running the gauntlet for Gillis
There are whistles and 'stares of astonishlnent at his tails
When they reach the punch bowl, Artie picks up a half-filled glass and fills it
Good party
The greatest
They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors
(To some guests who are dipping their empty cups into the punch bowl) Hey, easy on the punch bowl
Budget only calls for three drinks per extra
Fake the rest
Listen, Artie, can  stick around here for a while
Sure, this'll go on all night
mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch
'll take it
'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage
He runs his finger across the decollete back of a girl standing in a group next them
Just register here
The girl turns around
She is Betty Schaefer
Hello, Mr
Gillis
You know each other
Gillis looks at her a little puzzled
Let me help you
Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office
Sure
Bases Loaded
Wait a minute
This is the woman love
What's going on
Who was loaded
Don't worry
She's just a fan for my literary output
(to Artie) Hurt feelings department
About that luggage
Where's the phone
Over by the Rainbow Room
Gillis squeezes his way through groups of people to the telephone, which is next to an open door leading to the bathroom
The phone is busy girl sits listening to it, giggling wildly
Another girl beside her is laughing too
They are apparently sharing a conversation with some man on the other end of the wire
The telephone passes from hand to hand
Gillis watches impatiently, then When youlre through with that thing, can  have it
The girl just nods, going on with her chattering
Gillis stands waiting, and Betty Schaefer comes up with his glass
You forgot this
Thanks
've been hoping to run into you
What for
To recover that knife you stuck in my back
felt a little guilty, so  got out some of your old stories
Why, you sweet kid
There's one called
Window
something with a window
Dark Windows
How did you like it
didn't
Thank you
Except for about six pages
You've got a flashback there
There is too much racket for her
Is there someplace we can talk
How about the Rainbow Room
They squeeze their way towards the bathroom, past Artie
said you could have my couch
didn't say you could have my girl
This is shop talk
She and Gillis go through the open door into -20    ' It's a little less noisy, although there are some guests there, chatting and having fun
Betty and Gillis sit down on the edge of the tub
Now if  got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher
had a teacher like that once
Maybe that's why it's good
It's true, it's moving
Now why don't you use that character
Who wants true
Who wants moving
Drop that attitude
Here's some- thing really worth while
Want me to start right now
Maybe there's some paper around
'm serious
've got a few ideas
've got some ideas myself
One of them being this is New Year's Eve
How about living it up a little
As for instance
Well
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta
Or should we just turn on the shower
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door
Are you hungry
Hungry
After twelve years in the Burmese jungle
am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder -- Phillip, you're mad
One of the girls who was on the phone comes to the door
You can have the phone now
(Paying no attention) Thirsting for the coolness of your lips - No, Phillip, no
We must be strong
You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards
Furthermore, you can have the phone now
(He gets up, starts out, turns) find 'm terribly afraid of losing you
You won't
(She takes the glass out of his hand) 'll get us a refill of this awful stuff
You'll be waiting for me
With a wildly beating heart
Life can be beautiful
He leaves
-21 Gillis squeezes himself through some guests to the phone
He has to stand in a cramped position, holding the instrument close to him as he dials a number
Max
This is Mr
Gillis
want you to do me a favor
-22 Max is at the phone, in the lower hall
am sorry, Mr
Gillis
cannot talk now
-23 Yes you can
want you to get my old suitcase and  want you to throw in my old clothes -- the ones  came with, and my typewriter
'll have somebody pick them up
-24 have no time to talk
The doctor is here
-25 What doctor
What's going on
-26 She got the razor from your room
She cut her wrists
Max hangs up, moves toward the staircase
-27 Max
Max
He hangs up the dead receiver, stands numb   with shock
Betty elbows her way up to him, carrying the two punch glasses filled again
just got the recipe: take two packages of cough drops, dissolve in one gallon of lukewarm grape juice -- Gillis looks up at her
Without a word he pushes her aside so that she spills the drink
He makes his way through the guests to the Vicuna coat, pulls it from the shelf, some books tumbling with it, and rushes towards the door and out
Betty stands look- ing after him, completely bewildered
: -28
- (, ) The doctor's car is parked in the driveway
taxi pulls up
Gillis, in his Vicuna coat now, jumps out, throws a couple of dollars to the rdriver and runs toward the house

Gillis runs into the
How is she
She is upstairs
Gillis starts to push past Max
Max grabs his arm
Be careful
Do not race up the stairs
The musicians must not know what has happened
Gillis goes into the house

' Only one alabaster lamp lights the big, cold room
On the bed lies Norma in her evening dress
She is white as a sheet
Her wrists are bandaged
Her eyes are wide open, staring at the ceiling
One of her shoes has halt slipped off her foot
The other is on
Gillis opens the door and stands there tor a second
Then he slowly moves to the toot of the bed
He takes the shoes from her feet and puts them on the floor
Go away
What kind of a silly thing was that to do
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer
Great stars have great pride
She puts one bandaged forearm over her eyes, sobbing
Gillis walks slowly over to the mantelpiece, stands there for awhile
Go away
Go to that girl of yours
Look,  was making that up because thought the whole thing was a mistake
didn't want to hurt you
You've been good to me
You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go -- Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being
'll do it again, 'll do it again, 'll do it again
Gillis stands looking at her helplessly
-31     , The candles burned down, the orchestra playing to the emptiness
The orchestra leader looks at his watch, rises, silences the orchestra, then starts them in on Auld Lang Syne
-32
' Gillis still stands
Norma lies on the bed, arms over her eyes, sobbing
Happy New Year
Norma continues to sob
Gillis goes to the bed, puts his arms on her shoulders and turns her around
Happy New Year
Norma looks at him, tears in her eyes
Slowly she enfolds him in her bandaged arms
Happy New Year
darling
She kisses him

,               ' '  ()       Around the middle of May some incidents happened The telephone is heard      which  think  should tell ringing
Max comes from    you about
living room to the phone, picks it up
Hello
Yes
-1a     , ' Is this Crestview 5-1733
'm sorry to bother you again, but 've confirmed the number
must speak to Mr
Gillis
-1b    , He is not here
-1c Where can  reach him
Maybe somebody else in the house could tell me
-1d Nobody here can give you any information
You will please not call again
He hangs up
From off comes: ' Who was it, Max
What is it
-1e    , ' It is a sunny day
The garden is in somewhat better shape
The old house looks less unkept
The pool is filled
Norma sits on a wicker chaise longue, her face shielded by an enormous straw hat, her eyes by dark glasses
Gillis, in bathing trunks, is on a rubber mattress in the pool
Max comes to the entrance door
Nothing, Madame
Somebody Inqu- iring about a stray dog
We must have a number very similar to the pound
He starts to turn back
Wait a minute
want you to get out the car
You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr
De Mille in person
Yes, Madame
He goes into the house
(climbing out of the water) You're really going to send it to De Mille
This is the right day
She indicates a typewritten letter she is holding
(Cont'd) The chart from my astrologer
She read deMille's horoscope
She read mine
Did she read the script
DeMille is Leo
'm Scorpio
Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks
Today is the day of greatest conjuction
Now turn around
Let me dry you
She puts the towel around his sholders and starts drying him
hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts
'm not just selling the script
'm selling me
DeMille always said  was his greatest star
When did he say it, Norma
So he said it quite a few years ago
So what
never looked better in my life
Do you know why
Because 've never been as happy in my life
She kisses him

She'd taught Gillis in his tuxedo
me how to play bridge by Norma is rummaging          then, just as she'd taught through her evening         me some fancy tango steps, bag
She finds a           and what wine to drink cigarette case, opens       with what fish

It is empty
That idiot
He forgot to fill my cigarette case
(Proffering his case) Have one of mine
They're awful
They make me cough

(To Norma) 'll get you some
You're a darling
She takes a dollar bill from her purse and gives it to him

' The car drives up and Gillis hurries into the store

' Business is still rather lively
There are about a dozen shoppers, and the soda counter is half filled
Gillis enters and steps to the tobacco counter

The girl opens the glass showcase to locate the fancy brand
From  comes ' Stick 'em up, Gillis, or 'll let you have it
Gillis turns

With his forefinger and a sound effect, Artie riddles Gillis' body
Gillis walks Hello, Artie
Good evening, Miss Schaefer
(Excitedly) You don't know how glad  am to see youl Walking out on the mob
What's the big idea
'm sorry about New Year's
Would you believe me if  said  had to be with a sick friend
Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone
Stop it, Artie, will you
(To Gillis) Where have you been keeping your- self
've got the most wonderful news for you
haven't been keeping myself at all
Not lately
called your agent
called the Screen Writers Guild
Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number
There was always somebody with an accent growling at me
You were not there
You were not to be spoken to
They never heard of you
Is that so
What's the wonderful news
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher
What teacher
Dark Windows
got him all hopped up about it
You did
He thinks it could be made into something
Into what
lampshade
Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck
They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck
Unless you'd rather have Sarah Bernhardt
This is on the level
Sheldrake really went for it
Where's the cash
Where's the story
bluffed it out with a few notions of my own
It's really just a springboard
It needs work
was afraid of that
've got twenty pages of notes
've got a pretty good character for the man
Could you write in plenty of back- ground action, so they'll need an extra assistant director
Shut up, Artie
(To Gillis) Now if we could sit down for two weeks and get a story
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but 've given up writing on spec
tell you this is half sold
As a matter of fact
've given up writing altogether
Max has appeared in the door
Mr
Gillis, if you please
Right with you
Max leaves
The accent
've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government
Get those studs
Get those cuff-links
've got to run along
Thanks any- way for your interest in my career
It's not your career -- it's mine
kind of hoped to get in on this deal
don't want to be a reader all my life
want to write
Sorry if  crossed you up
You sure have
So long
He leaves

Max takes off
What on earth, darling
It took you hours
ran into some people  knew
Where are my cigarettes
Where are your

Norma, you're smoking too much

She bats her eyes, winks roguishly

The whole effect approximates a Mack Sennett bathing costume pretty effectively
She points at a leather pour
This is a rock
She climbs on it, pantomimes timidity, an attempted dive, then jumps off
Gillis lolls on a couch, watching the performance, very bored
can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand
Mabel was always stepping on my feet
What's the matter with you, darling
Why are you so glum
(Lighting a cigarette with a match) Nothing is the matter

Show me some more

They think the actors make it up as they go along
' Open your eyes
Gillis opens his eyes
Norma has equipped herselr with a derby hat, a cane, and blacked in a small moustache
She goes into a little Chaplin routine
While she is doing it, the telephone rings
After a moment Max comes to the living room door
Madame is wanted on the telephone
You know better than to interrupt me
Paramount is calling
Who
Paramount studios
(To Gillis) Now, now do you belive me
told you deMille would jump at it
It is not Mr
deMille in person
It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole
He says it's very important
Certainly it's important
It's important enough for Mr
deMille to call me personally
The idea of having an assistant call me
myself was surprised at Mr
de Mille's manners
Say that 'm busy, and hang up
Very good, Madam
He bows and exits
How do you like that
We've made twelve pictures together
His greatest successes
Maybe deMille is shooting
know that trick
He wants to belittle me
He's trying to get my price down
've waited twenty years for this call
Now Mr
deMille can wait till 'm good and ready

there had been some more Beside her   of those calls from sits Gillis in the glen   Paramount
So she put on plaid suit
Max is       about half a pound of driving
makeup, fixed it up with a veil, and set forth to see deMille in person
Norma is examining her face in the mirror of her vanity
Max, while driving, sees her in the rear view mirror
If you will pardon me, Madame
The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced
Thank you, Max
With a handkerchief, she corrects it
-9      , The car drives down Bronson and stops smack in front of the iron gate
young policeman is talking to an extra; an old policeman sits reading a newspaper
Max sounds the horn impatiently
Hold that noise
To see Mr
de Mille
Open the gate
Mr
deMille is shooting
You got an appointment
No appointment is necessary am bringing Norma Desmond
Norma Who
Norma has rolled down the window on her side
She calls to the old policeman
Jonesy
Come here, Jonesy
Yeah
(He comes forward slowly) Why, if it isn't Miss Desmond
How have you been, Miss Desmond
Fine, Jonesy
Now open that gate
Sure, Miss Desmond
(To the young policeman} Come on, Mac
They can't drive on the lot without a pass
Miss Desmond can
Come on
They fling open the gate
(As the car drives through) Stage eighteen, Miss Desmond
Thank you, Jonesy
And teach your friend some manners
Tell him without me he wouldn't have any job, because without me there wouldn't be any Paramount Studio

could be her father

de Mille
By this time de Mille is on his feet
It must be about that appalling script of hers
What can  say to her
What can  say
1ST can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room can give her the brush
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush
Isn't that enough
1ST didn't mean to -- Of course you didn't
You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster
1ST hear she was a terror to work with
She got to be

deMille
Seeing Norma, he stretches out his arms
Hello, young fellow
Hello, Mr

They embrace
Last time  saw you was someplace very gay
remember waving to you
was dancing on a table
Lots of people were
Lindbergh had just landed in Paris
Come on in
He leads her into -13     18 During the ensuing dialogue, Mr
deMille walks Norma towards the set
Norma,  want to apologize for not calling you
You'd better
'm very angry
'm pretty busy, as you can see
That's no excuse
You read the script, didn't you
Yes,  did
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants
What assistant
Don't play innocent
Somebody named Gordon Cole
Gordon Cole
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times
Gordon Cole
Look, Norma, 'm in the middle of a rehearsal
(Indicating his own chair) Make yourself comfortable
He walks onto the set, accompanied by his assistants
(Sotto voce, to his first assistant) Get me Gordon Cole on the phone
Meanwhile, Norma starts to sit, sees the name on the chair and with a look of distaste changes and sits on the one marked From somewhere comes Hey, Miss Desmond
Miss Desmond
She looks around her
Up here
Norma looks up at the scaffolding
On the scaffold stands one of the electricians, next to his light
It's met It's Hog-eyel Norma waves at him
Hello
Hog-eye points his light at her
- Let's get a look at you
The beam of the lamp moves toward Norma
It hits her
She sits bathed in light
couple of old costume extras recognize her
Say, it's Norma
Norma Desmond
They rush over and start wringing her hand
Into the shot comes a middle-aged hairdresser
Hello, Miss Desmond
It's Bessie
Some elderly electricians and stagehands move in

DeMille lifts the receiver
Hello

Gordon Cole speaking
-16 Cole, this is
deMille
Have you been calling Norma Desmond
What's it about
-17     , It's that car of hers -- an old Isotta-Fraschini
Her chauffeur drove it on the lot the other day
It looks just right for the Crosby picture
We want to rent it for a couple of weeks
-18 (Troubled) Oh
Well, thank you
He hangs up, walks back towards Norma

Norma stills sits in the shaft of light, surrounded by about a dozen people who have come up to pay court
DeMille gestures up to Hog-eye and the light shifts away
The people about Norma disperse slowly with various ad-libs
Well, Norma
(He sits down next to her) got hold of Gordon Cole
Norma hasn't heard a word
Did you see them
Did you see how they came
You know, crazy things happen in this business
hope you haven't lost your sense of humor
Suddenly he realizes that she is crying
She takes the handkerchief from his pocket and puts it over her eyes
What's the matter, Norma
Nothing
just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio
had no idea how 'd missed it
We've missed you too, dear
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief
We'll make our greatest picture
That's what  want to talk to you about
It's a good script, isn't it
It's got a lot of good things
Of course, it would be an expensive picture
don't care about the money
just want to work again
You don't know what it means to know that you want me
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible
But remember, darling --  don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon
The first assistant comes up
1ST We're ready with the shot, Mr
deMille
You'll pardon me, Norma
Why don't you just sit and watch

The scene starts

(Pointing to the row of offices in the building opposite) You see those offices there, Mr
Gillis
They used to be her dressing room, The whole row
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid
He had a great big bungalow on wheels
had the upstairs
See where it says 'Readers' Department'
remember my walls were covered with black patent leather
The words "Readers' Department" have registered on Gillis' mind
He gets out of the car
'll be with you in a minute
He crosses the street towards the green staircase leading to the second floor
Meanwhile, two prop men walking down the street come into the
1ST Hey, that's the comic car Cole was talking about
(To Max) Do you mind if we look inside
Go away
Go away

The door behind her opens and Gillis enters
Just so you don't think 'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it
It's all yours
Well, for heaven's sake
She moves the book and the apple aside and points at the free space on the desk
Have a chair
Gillis sits on the desk
mean it
It's no good to me anyway
Help yourself
Why should you do that
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams
If you get an Oscar, get the left foot
You know, 'd take you up on that in a minute
'm just not good enough to do it all by myself
What about all those ideas you had
See if they make sense
To begin with,  think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles
Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes
To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay
Check
Now  see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school
The first time they meet
From below comes the  of the Isotta's horn
Look, if you don't mind,  haven't got time to listen to the whole plot
'll make it short
Sorry
It's your baby now
'm not good enough to write it alone
We'll have to do it together
'm all tied up
can't
Couldn't we work in the evenings
Six o'clock in the morning
This next month 'm completely at your disposal
Artie is out of town
What has Artie to do with it
We're engaged
Good for you
You've got yourself the best guy in town
think so
They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western
'm free every evening, every week- end
If you want, we could work at your place
It's just impossible
Nobody can be that busy
There is another honk: from down below
Look, Betty, It can't be done
It's out
You're tough, all right
You're on your own
Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story
Honest to goodness,  hate you
(Turning 1n the open door) And don't make it too dreary
How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes
He teaches at night
Right
They don't even know each other, but they share the same room
It's cheaper that way
As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse
Are you kidding
Because  think it's good
So do
Came  on back
Let me show you where it fits in
She reaches in a drawer for her notes on Dark Windows
(At the door) So long
Betty picks up the apple and is about to throw it after him
Oh, you -- And here's a title: He ducks out quiokly, slamming the door behind him
Betty looks after him, then angrlly hurls the apple into the wastebasket

Goodbye, young fellow
We'll see what we can do

Everything will be fine

Nothing can stop us

De Mille stands for a second watching her, then turns to his assistant

He can find another old car
'll buy him five old cars, if necessary

De Mille
They turn back into Stage 18

Max is helping Norma in and putting the robe over her
(Apprehensively) How did it go
It couldn't have gone better
It's practically set
Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next
There is an exchange of looks between Max and Gillis
He must be quite a guy
He'a a shrewd old fox
He can smell box office
Only 'm going to outfox him a litt1e
This isn't going to be
deMille's Salome
It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond
Home, Max

He resumes typing
Betty puts the water on
She picks up a pack of cigarettes on the desk, finds it's empty and throws it away, sees Gillis' open gold cigarette case and lighter on the table by the couch
Betty reaches for a cigarette
The inscription en- graved inside the case catches her eye
It reads: -- Norma Who's Norma
Who's who
'm sorry

Oh, that
It's from a friend of mine

All card- board, all hollow, all phoney
All done with mirrors

Maybe because  used to play here when  was a kid
What were you -- a child actress
was born just two blocks from this studio
Right on Lemon Grove Avenue
Father was head elec- trician here till he died
Mother still works in Wardrobe
Second generation, huh
Third
Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White
come from a picture family
Naturally they took it for granted  was to become a great star
So  had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing
Then the studio made a test
Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little
went to a doctor and had it fixed
They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting
(Examining her nose by the flame of his lighter) Nice job
Should be
It cost three hundred dollars
Saddest thing  ever heard
Not at all
It taught me a little sense
got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic
Now 'm a reader
Come clean, Betty
At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings
Not once
What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras
It's really more fun
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer
will now kiss that nose of yours
If you please
Gillis kisses her nose
As he stands there, his face close to hers - May  say you smell real special
It must be my new shampoo
That's no shampoo
It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile
How old are you anyway
Twenty-two
That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two
Now may  suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me
Now back to the typewriter
They start walking in the direction of the office

From the seat next him he takes a batch of script, folds it and puts it in his pocket
He suddenly becomes aware that he is watched, turns
Max stands in the moonlight, evidently waiting for him
What is it, Max
Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours
You must be very careful as you cross the patio
Madame may be watching
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark
Will that do it
'm not inquiring where Mr
Gillis goes every night
Why don't you
'm writing a script and 'm dying to finish it, no matter what
It's just that 'm very worried about Madame
Sure you are

She never will

In a pocket is part of the script
Norma takes it out, looks at it
She can't see it in the moonlight
She hurries with it into: -16    ' Carrying the script Norma goes to the lamp and looks at it

What's wrong
He wants me to come on to Arizona
He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there
It would kind of save us a honeymoon

Stop crying
You're getting married

Why not

Maybe could wipe the whole nasty mess right out of my life
From Norma's room comes the sound of a telephone being dialled
Gillis enters the shot and stands listening
' Is this Gladstone 0858
-21    ' Norma lies in bed, dialing a number
She has the beauty patches at the corners of her eyes and over her nose
Can  speak to Miss Betty Schaefer
She must be home by now
-22       ' Connie, a girl of Betty's age with whom she shares the flat, is on the phone
Betty, in a dressing- gown, comes from the bathroom, toothbrush in hand
(Hand over mouthpiece) Betty, here's that weird-sounding woman again
What is this anyway
(Taking the phone) This is Betty Schaefer
-23 Miss Schaefer, you must forgive me for calling you so late, but really feel it's my duty
It's about Mr
Gillis
You do know Mr
Gillis
Exactly how much do you know about him
Do you know where he lives
Do you know how he lives
Do you know what he lives on
-24 Who are you
What do you want
What business is it of yours anyway
-25 Miss Schaefer, 'm trying to do you a favor
'm trying to spare you a great deal of misery
Of course you may be too young to even suspect there are men of his sort
(Cont'd) don't know what he's told you, but he does not live with relatives, nor with friends, in the usual sense of the word
Ask him
Ask him again
During the latter part of her call, the doors from Gillis' room have been pushed open and Gillis has walked towards her
Suddenly Norma senses his pre- sence and turns around
The telephone freezes in her hand
She tries to hang it up
Very calmly Gillis takes the receiver from her hand
(Into phone) That's right, Betty, ask me again
This is Joe
-26 Joe, where are you
What's this all about

Or maybe it would be a better idea if you came over and saw it for yourself
The address is 10086 He hangs up
Norma looks up at him as he crosses to the other end of the room and stands staring at her
The silence becomes unbearable
Don't hate me, Joe

need you as  never needed you
Look at me
Look at my hands, look at my face, look under my eyes
How can  go back to work if 'm wasting away under this torment

Betty, let me come along with you
Please
No, 'll be all right
She shuts the door of the car and goes up the steps

There is the sound of footsteps below and the ringing of a doorbell
Gillis rises
What are you going to do, Joe
Without a word, he leaves the room
Norma raises herself on the bed, reaching for a black negligee lying at the foot of it
As she does so, she dis- lodges her pillow a little, revealing a revolver hidden beneath it

Is it something awful

As he leads her into the living room, Gillis puts his arm around her shoulders

There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar
Why did she call me
Jealous
Ever see so much junk
She had the ceiling brought from Portugal
Look at this
He pulls the rope, showing the projection screen under the picture
Her own movie theatre
didn't come here to see a house
What about Norma Desmond
'm trying to tell you
This is an enormous place
Eight master bedrooms
sunken tub in every bathroom
There's a bowling alley in the cellar
It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion
very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do
younger man who is not doing too well
Can you figure it out yourself
No
All right
'll give you a few more clues
No, no
haven't heard any of this
never got those telephone calls
've never been in this house
Get your things together
Let's get out of here
All my things
All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases
Come on, Joe
Come on where
Back to a one-room apartment that  can't pay for
Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not
If you love me, Joe
Look, sweetie -- be practical
l've got a good thing here
long-term contract with no options
like it that way
Maybe it's not very admirable
Well, you and Artie can be admirable
Joe,  can't look at you any more
Nobody asked you to

All right, baby

Gillis opens it
Good luck to you, Betty
You can finish that story on the way to Arizona
When you and Artie get back, if the two of you ever feel like a swim, here's the pool
He switches on the light
-35 The lights go on in the pool, which shines brilliant- ly in the dark garden
-36 She doesn't even look
Her eyes filled with tears, she runs down the entrance porch toward her car
-37 Gillis looks after her, closes the door
From the upper landing comes the sound of soft sobbing
He looks up
-38    , Gillis ascends the stairs
Thank you, Joe -- thank you, Joe
She tries to take his hand to kiss it as he passes
He doesn't stop
Norma catches his coat
Gillis moves right on into his room
Norma lies on the floor looking after him
She crawls toward a con- sole, pulls herself up by it, starts towards Gillis' door, passes a mirror, realizes how she looks, moves back to the mirror and takes the patches off her face and does a hasty job of removing the cream with her handkerchief, readjusts her expression to a poor travesty of a smile and goes to the door of Gillis' room
May  come in
've stopped cry- ing
'm all right again
Joe, tell me you're not cross -- tell me everything is just as it was, Joe
She opens the door
-39    ' In the foreground, open on the bed, is a half-packed suitcase, Gillis just putting some of his old shirts in
Norma stands staring, speechless, for a second
Gillis moves out of the shot towards the closets
What are you doing, Joe
What are you doing
You're not leaving me
Yes,  am, Norma
No, you're not
(Calling) Max
Max
Max is a good idea
He can help with my luggage
(He gestures in the direction of the closet) Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe
And thanks for the use of all the trinkets
He takes the cigarette case and throws it on the chaise longue
Then he throws the lighter, the wrist watch, the platinum key-chain and the tie clip
(Indicating the bureau) The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer
It's yours, Joe
gave it to you
And 'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio
These are nothing
You can have anything you want if you'll only stay
What is it you want -- money
Norma, you'd be throwing it away
don't qualify for the job, not any more
You can't do this
Max
Max
can't face life without you, and 'm not afraid to die, you know
That's between you and yourself, Norma
You think  made that up about the gun
She rushes into her room
Gillis closes the suitcase calmly, notices that he is still wearing some cuff- links Norma gave him, takes them off
Norma reappears in the door, carrying the revolver
See, you didn't believe me
Now  suppose you don't think have the courage
Oh
sure -- if it would make a good scene
You don't care
do you
But hundreds of thousands of people will carel Wake up, Norma
You'd be killing yourself to an empty house

Now face it
During the preceding
Max has entered
He stands listening, paralyzed
That's a lie
They still want me
No, they don't

What about De Mille
He was trying to spare your feelings
The studio wanted to rent your car
Wanted what
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you
None of us has had the heart
That's a lie
They want me, they want me

You tell her, Max
Come on, do her that favor
Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself
That isn't true
Max

There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five

Gillis is crossing the patio towards the garage
He is carrying the typewriter
He doesn't accelerate his step, although he has heard the shot
Behind him Norma comes from the lighted house
You're not leaving me
She shoots twice in rapid succession
Gillis drops the typewriter
The shots have swung him around
He is now facing Norma
She shoots him
This shot hits him in the belly
He doubles up, instinctively backs away from her, plummets into the lit pool
Up the stone steps from the garage rushes Max
He sees the situation, hurries towards Norma, who stands exultant in the strange light from the pool
Stars are ageless, aren't they

Who's on this phone

Now get off, this is more important
Times City Desk
Hedda Hopper speaking
'm talking from the bedroom of Norma Desmond
Don't bother with a rewrite man, take this direct
Ready
-- As day breaks over the murder house, Norma Desmond, famed star of yesteryear, is in a state of complete mental shock
, where Norma sits at a mirror, staring at herself blankly
Firing questions at her are the Captain of the Holmby Hills Division and the
Homicide Squad
Max stands by faithfully
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond
Did you intend to kill him
Just answer me that
Was it a sudden quarrel
Had there been any trouble between you before
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time
Where did he come from
Who is he
Did he have a wife
Did he had a girl friend
Did you know them
Had he been trying to blackmail you

Even the newsreel guys came roaring in
Here was an item everybody could have some fun with, the heartless so-and- so's
What would they do to her
Even if she got away with it in court- crime of passion - tempo- rary insanity - those headlines would kill her: Forgotten Star a Slayer--Aging Actress-- Yesterday's Glamour Queen
-46    ' The interrogators are still firing questions at Norma who sits lifeless, staring at herself
Max watches
Did the deceased ever threaten you
Were you in fear of bodily injury
Did you hate him
Had you ever thought of doing something like this before
Was theft involved
Did you catch him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something

The newsreel guys have arrived with the cameras

She takes a comb and runs it through her hair, then starts applying some wild makeup

Is everything set up, gentlemen
Are the lights ready
From the stairway comes a murnur
They look up
Norma has emerged from the bedroom and comes to the head of the stairs
There are golden spangles in her hair and in her hand she carries a golden scarf
The police clear a path for her to descend
Press cameras flash at her every step
Max stands at the cameras
Is everything set up, gentlemen
Just about
The portable lights flare up and illuminate the staircase
Are the lights ready

The dream she had clung to so des- perately had enfolded her
At the foot of the stairs Norma stops, moved

DeMille, 'm ready for my closeup
