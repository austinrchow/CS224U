Long, alabaster white
Beautiful enters frame
Starts washing the arm with long, tender strokes

Being gently washed

Tidy

Brushes against the eyebrow hair, then back again
Against
Then back again

Folded neatly
The wash cloth begins between the toes
Warm, soapy water
now dry
The  appears with a comb
Pulls down through the thick tresses
It is only now that we see the hand is wearing a The gloved hand holds up the comb and pulls stray hairs from it
Places them in a big, clear, plastic bag
In the bag we see the panty-hose, a folded flower dress, the nail clippings
Goes back to combing
Comes across a knot and yanks the comb through
The  rolls over to us
Her face is bruised, her eyes blank
She is lying on the floor
Dead
End of credit sequence
-   ,  - The loud  of a bush plane
We   a small, cloudy window
Through it we see an endless expanse of pine trees
(
) Jesus
Just look at all that
to reveal   and   sitting side by side
Hap's at the window
Greying moustache, a little pudgy, wearing a brown suit
Holding a folded over Seattle Times
(cont'd) thought we had a population problem
Everyone should just move up here
(taps window) Just look at it, Will
Will's eyes remain on the file on his lap
don't need to look at it
Will Dormer
Tall, handsome, expensively tailored suit
Snakeskin cowboy boots
There's both a magnetism and a distance to him
An intense mixture
Hap glances at him
Nothing wrong with smelling the roses
Will looks up
We see the trace of a thick, ropy  by his Adam's apple
There's tension between him and Hap, just below the surface
He taps the file
Tell that to her, partner
a stack of 8x10
Of the dead girl
Her eyes puffed up from bruises
The whites bloody
Contusions along her breasts and shoulders
(
) Detective
The 's looking back at Will
Wearing a leather red baron hat
(cont'd) Better check your belts
We'll be landing in about fifteen minutes
Will nods
The plane lurches
The file falls to the floor and the photographs scatter
The pilot catches a glimpse of them
Looks at Will
- The small yellow plane veers left
Clears a mountain top and gives view to the spectacular Alaskan coastline
The green of the Bering sea, the blanket of pine trees, the jagged rock of the beaches
Enormous
-   - swinging in the wind: Nightmute, Alaska
Halibut Fishing Capital of the World
to reveal it hanging from the eave of a small, corrugated building
The "airport
"  Nothing else for miles around
mud-splattered Jeep Cherokee pulls up next to it
Brakes hops out
About 23
Petite with short, brown hair
Peers up at the sky
Brightens at the sight of the coming in for landing
Smooths down her down vest
Making sure the   on her belt's visible
Nervous
Excited
(
) Eleanor
turns
Shields her eyes from the sun
An hosing down the side of the building
Hey, Mr
Angstrom
What're you doing here
Ellie puffs up
Police business
Police business
The old man screws up his face, confused
(cont'd) Didn't you used to baby-sit for us
don't babysit any more, Mr
Angstrom
Just made detective three weeks ago
jumps down off the roof
Angstrom sprays it
Boy, Charlie must be short-handed down at the station
Ellie, used to not being taken seriously
Turns back to of the bush plane as it taxis down the strip
Coming to a stop
She hurries over as the door swings open and
steps down
Slipping on his sunglasses
Scanning the nothingness around him
Spots the swinging sign
"Halibut fishing capital of the world
" Hap, right behind him
Rubs his neck
This ought to be interesting
(over the engine) Detective Dormer
They look down
Ellie reaches up and takes Will's bag
Then his hand
Shakes it vigorously
(cont'd) It's a huge honor to meet you
Ellie Burr
'm here to take you to the station
Will motions to Hap
My partner
Detective Eckhart
know
Welcome to Nightmute
She leads them away from the plane
Takes Will's briefcase
just want to say how incredible it is to have you working with us, Detective Dormer
've followed all your cases
Theodore Dineli, Frank and Casey Prud'homme, the Port Angeles shootings
Opens the back of the Jeep
Puts the bags inside
(cont'd) And especially the Leland Street Murders
That was my case study at the Academy
The Pilot walks by
Taps her on the shoulder
Tell your dad the game's gonna start late this week, Ellie
Sure thing, Spence
She looks back at Will
Can't help but focus in on his scar
Touches her own smooth neck
In awe
(cont'd) That's where Ronald Langley cut you in the basement of his father's house on 325 Leland, isn't it
Will smiles, taken aback by this girl's exuberance
You did your homework, Officer
Actually
She throws a quick glance at Angstrom
Out of ear-shot
just made detective three weeks ago
- The Cherokee parked next to a police car outside a plain, one- storey building
The Nightmute Police Department
totem pole stands out front
(
) Will Dormer
'  - Nightmute Police Chief   gets up from behind his desk with a big smile
Ruddy, red hair sprinkled with grey, Nyback wears a faded army sweater over his uniform
'll be damned
Limps from behind his desk and gives Will a shake and a slap on the back
(warmly) How you doing, Charlie
Nyback shakes Hap's hand
reunion
Hey, Charlie
Christ
haven't seen you boys since
Just after Leland Street
What's that, then
Eight years
Seven years
Seven years
Where does it all go
That was some amazing time, though, wasn't it
Looks at Will
Down at his boots
(cont'd) You haven't changed a bit, Will
Will
Looks at Nyback's gut
You have, Chief
They
Eyes twinkling
knew that was coming
deserve it
He starts back over to his desk
Notices Ellie still standing by the door
Points to Will
(cont'd) Pay attention to this man, Ellie
He'll teach you how to be a great cop
Ellie straightens
Smiles
Looks over at Will
Yes, sir
That's all, for now
Ellie, realises they want to be alone
Oh
Right
Okay
Backs out
Quietly closing the door behind her
Will unbuttons his jacket
Takes a seat
Nice kid
(sits with a ) Got a love affair with police work
Drives me crazy with it
Will surveys the fishing poles leaning against the gun rack
Keeping you busy up here, Charlie
Hap picks up a cheap trophy
Reads the base
"2nd prize Great Kodiak Salmon Catch
" told you seven years ago this was a stepping stone to retirement
Nyback nods to Hap's Seattle Times
The headline:  "Deeper Investigation into Special Branch"
(cont'd) Looks like it's a good time for you to get up here, too
With all the bad business going on down at Special Branch
Will and Hap share a look
No more joking
Hap folds over the paper
(cont'd) Just five bad apples so far
So far
What's the
got them on
Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft
Nyback winces
How about you
How you faring
They're all over us, Charlie
They're all over everybody
's calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force
"  Can you believe that
Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years
They're turning it into a witch hunt
Something on the news about it practically every night
Nyback pulls a stack of messages from his desk
Got a bunch of messages here from some guy named Warfield
Hap tosses a glance over at Will
That's
's pit bull
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here
Nyback turns and ceremoniously drops the messages into the trash
(cont'd) 'm just glad Buck could spare you a couple of weeks
Take you out of the frenzy
gotta tell you, though,  sure don't miss big city police work
Not that  was ever a great detective
But up here there's no Bureaucracy
No Public Relations
No blurred lines
Just good guys and bad guys
Simple
cloud passes over his face
(cont'd) Except for this
Holds up a file
The name written on the lip:
- Nyback leads Will and Hap down a hallway
Crooked plaques and black-and-white pictures line the walls
Couldn't get a thing from the body
Not a trace
Town's never dealt with anything like this before
They turn a corner and stop at a door
Will glances up: hanging over it
(cont'd) 've briefed everybody about your coming
They know to follow your lead
Nyback opens the door onto
-   - the bullpen of Nightmute
Wooden desks, a couple computers, a jumbled corkboard, an impressive gun cabinet 's playing
Three  look over
young uniformed cop and two guys with heavy facial hair, Timberland boots, and flannel shirts
One of them's part Inuit
Ellie sits in the back
Reaches over to turn off the radio
Will and Hap stand in the doorway
Sticking out like sore thumbs in their suits
Nyback jerks his thumb towards them
This is Detective Dormer and his partner Detective Eckhart
On loan from Buck Lundgard, Seattle Robbery and Homicide Special Branch
They'll be helping with the Connell case
The Inuit,  , snorts
Takes his feet of the desk
Helping
(ignoring him) Anything they need to see, you show them; anywhere they want to go, you take them
(nods to Fred) This is Detective Fred Duggar
He's been leading the investigation up to now
Will puts out his hand
Detective
Fred tugs at his dark handlebar moustache
Stands
Suppose you want to see the body
- Fred steps out of the station, pulls on a baseball cap
We can walk from here
He heads off across the parking lot
Will and Hap exchange a glance
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality
(
) Don't worry about him
They turn
Ellie's come up behind them
Looks over at the hunched figure to Fred
(cont'd) He's just mad 'cause you're taking over
Fred stops up ahead
Sees her
Annoyed
Ellie
Go type something
- a faucet
bead of water, quivering at the mouth
Falls with a
(
) Did a fundascopic examination and found papilledema and petechiae of the retina
to reveal Will, Hap, and the standing by a stainless steel table
The naked body of is laid out before them
Fred hangs back
The coroner tugs at her surgical gloves
She's in her late seventies
(cont'd) Clear cause of death was herniation of the brain stem due to intracerebral hemorrhage
Beaten to death
Beaten to death
Will points to the bruises on the body's shoulders and breasts
What about these contusions
Superficial
Any signs of rape
None
The coroner starts to cover the body with a sheet
(cont'd) She was a nice girl
Played flute with my granddaughter
Will stays her hand
Wait
He pulls the sheet back down
Studying the body of Kay Connell
Starts walking slowly around the table
In his element
The faucet drips
Drips
Drips
He bends down to smell her hair
(cont'd) He washed her hair
Takes a handful and lets it fall from his fingers
(cont'd) Combed it
Continues around the table
Picks up one of her hands
Examines her fingers, her nails
(cont'd) Cleaned under her fingernails
Clipped them
Continues down around her feet
Checks between her first and second toes
(cont'd) Toes, too
(to Fred) You found nothing on the body
No
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs
Like  said, no
We know about those things up here
Will stands there
Looking down at the body
Slim
Young
Beautiful
Skin like marble
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for
Made sure to cover up all his tracks
Even the best make mistakes
Will looks up and locks eyes with his partner
-  - Will and Hap enter the lobby of the Pioneer Lodge
Big stone fireplace and heavy ceiling beams
mounted above reception
They put their bags down by the desk
Look around
(
) Lower forty-eight
They turn
stands in a doorway behind the desk
Dunking a teabag into a mug
Long dark hair and intelligent eyes
Lower forty-eight
You're not from here
can tell by your walk
Oh
And how's that
Unsure
Hap smiles at her
Will checks his watch
Detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart
There should be a reservation for us
Rachel looks at him
Goes to a small file box on the desk
(to Hap) Your friend's all business
'm always all business
He glances out the window
It's as bright as day
(cont'd) Is it really 9:30
(nods) Alaskan summers
Hope you're an easy sleeper
It'll be like this all night
She hands them two cards
(cont'd) Sign here
'  - Will's taken off his jacket and is unpacking
The room is sparse and creaky
Bed dips in the middle
He hangs a jacket in the armoire then returns to his suitcase
Pulls out his    45
Lays it on the bedside table
Takes out a shoulder holster
back holster
handful of shells
Lays them on the table
Then a small    39/13 9MM
Checks the magazine
There's a  on the adjoining door
(
) Me
Will  the magazine back
Come on in
Hap opens the door
glimpse into his room: family on his bedside table - a  and three teenage
See you have the same decor as my room
He walks over to the big window
It overlooks the harbor
Big, snow-capped mountains in the distance
One lone in the harbor towing a freighter
(cont'd) Same view, too
(looks out) 've been watching that tugboat for the last half hour
So small, pulling all that weight
(beat) We have to talk, Will
Will reaches into his suitcase
Pulls out a shirt
What do you want to talk about
You know what about
Will throws him a look
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle
When's that, a week
Two weeks
(heads over to him) We have to figure out a plan of action now
You know my plan of action
To do nothing
That's right
Dammit, Will
Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday
Five hours
Asking all kinds of questions
He's asking everybody questions
But he's zeroing in on me
On us
Everyone's talking about it
He's just rattling your cage
Well,  gotta tell you
With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard
We say nothing
It goes away
Simple as that
Will goes back to his suitcase
Hap follows
thin film of sweat on his upper lip
(lowers voice) Look
We've tampered with evidence
We've pushed witnesses
We've planted shit
And they're sniffing around like dogs
Especially on the Dobbs case
Will flares up
Struck a nerve
Turns to his partner
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat
You remember that
You know  remember that
One word to
and he walks
Maybe not
We could talk to Buck
No way
Cut some kind of a deal
heard that's what Flynn's doing
Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap
We are nothing like Mike Flynn
We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did
And every bastard like him
We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk
Every last one
And  am not going to let that happen
No deals
No compromises
No discussions
He grabs a hanger
Goddammit, Will
You grab on to something and you don't let it go
He takes out a handkerchief
Wipes his brow
don't know if it's because you think it's the right thing to do or because your pride won't let you do anything else
can't tell any more
(steps back) But  can tell you one thing
'm getting too old for this cowboy cop stuff
Breaking the rules
Cleaning up messes
We're a dying breed, Will
You're a dying breed
, the
, all those reporters - they don't care what you did at Leland Street seven years ago
They don't care that you've made this your life
They don't care about getting the bad guy
Will turns on his partner, eyes burning
care
The partners, lock eyes
Years of working together thousand things unsaid
Hap reaches for the door
(cont'd) They're watching us, Will
Like it or not
They're watching us
'  - Will's asleep
Kay Connell's folder open on his chest
It's dark in his room, quiet
Suddenly the shade on his window quivers and  up, flooding the room with light
Will's eyes pop open
He rolls over to look at the clock: 3:15
Squinting, he gets up and walks over to the window
We can see the rest of his scar
Runs down deep across his sternum
He yanks the shade back down
It bucks, then settles
Satisfied, Will returns to bed
Plumps the pillow, pulls the blanket up around him
Closes his eyes
The shade lurches halfway
Then  back up
Light pours in
Will's eyes open
You got to be kidding me
-  - Will jogs along in a Sonics sweatshirt, a ring of sweat around his collar
He looks out over the harbor
Fishing boats coming in with their early morning haul
More halibut
He checks his watch
Slows to a walk
Looks up and sees
Ellie Burr standing on the front steps of the Pioneer Lodge
Smiles
Holds up some car keys
Fred wants us to meet him at the Connell's
/
- Ellie driving
hula-girl, swinging from the rear-view mirror
Will in the passenger seat
Wearing a crisp suit
Ellie hands him a take-out bag
Brought you a bear claw
Just in case you were hungry
Will takes the bag
Looks inside
Yikes
(cont'd) Local delicacy
Think 'll pass
He puts the bag on the dash
Looks out the window
Nightmute's main street
line of shops
Undistinguished Town Hall
Elementary school up on a hill
Sign out front: Sign-ups for Midnight Little League
(cont'd) What kind of calls you get around here
Oh
You know
Small-time stuff
Nothing like what you must get
Mostly drinking-related problems
Domestic abuse
Barroom fights
Stuff like that
She shifts down
Takes a steep turn
(cont'd) In the summer months it's pretty quiet
That's when there's work out on the boats
The rest of the year, though
They pass a  walking along the road
Gnarled walking stick
Ellie calls out the window
(cont'd) Hey, there, Joe
waves
They pass
(cont'd) That's Joe Willy
Took his family hostage in November
That was the most exciting thing that happened last year
wasn't there, though
(grinds gear) Chief barely lets me handle anything above a misdemeanor
Will looks over at her
Smiles
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap
But they're so boring
All small stuff
It's all about the small stuff
Small lies
Small mistakes
Small oversights
People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case
It's human nature
He looks over
Ellie's listening intently
(cont'd) Aren't you going to write that down
Ellie, searching her pockets for something to write with
Let me just
Stops
Looks over
Realises Will's teasing her
- small ranch house
Aluminum siding
piled up by the front door
Left by well-wishers
(
) haven't tidied up, since Fred told me not to touch anything
-   - , a big woman with a thick grey braid down her back, opens the door to her daughter's room
Looks at Will
don't believe in keeping a child's room like a shrine
Will heads into the room
Hap follows
palpable uneasiness between them
Fred and Ellie stand in the doorway
Mrs
Connell turns to go
'  - small bedroom
Pink shag carpeting and clouds painted on the ceiling
Pictures cut from magazines pasted on the walls
stack of tapes and a boom box in the corner
Will stands in the middle of the room
Taking it in
Typical seventeen year-old
(beat) She went to a party Friday night
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in
Fred throws Ellie a look
"Kids
"  She's practically a kid herself
Will opens the top drawer of the bureau
Roots beneath the panties
No diary
On top of the bureau, a stack of photos
couple torn up
Kay Connell and a  with white-blonde hair
Laughing
She left the party early
Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out
What time was that
Around twelve-thirty
Hap picks up a bear on Kay's bed
bell  when he shakes it
Will crosses to a closet in the corner
Who was the last one to see her alive
Randy Stetz
Her boyfriend
We've questioned him, searched his place
Didn't find anything
Will pulls a dress out of the closet
Small, black, elegant
The tag's been cut out
He pulls out another, then another
Feels the fabric
These are designer
Expensive
(looks up) Could Randy Stetz afford these
Fred and Ellie exchange a look
He fixes boat engines
Will looks around
Cheap wallpaper, torn window screens
Well her mother didn't buy them for her
What are we thinking
Will reaches over to a heart-shaped box on the bedside table
Pulls out a pretty gold necklace
Holds it up
Kay Connell had an admirer
He hands the dresses to Ellie
Heads out of the room
(cont'd) want to talk to the boyfriend
- a hand squeezing a shoulder
Hard
You don't seem all that sad
The shoulder jerks away
to reveal sitting at a wooden table in an interrogation room
Longish blond hair, wearing a Metallica t-shirt, trying like hell to grow a moustache
haven't had a chance
You fuckers been all over my back since Monday
He takes out a cigarette
It's bent
He lights it
Hap sits opposite
You know smoking stunts your growth
Randy throws him a look
Yeah, okay, fat-ass
(smiles at Will) More Alaskan hospitality
Will goes over to a coffee machine
Pours a cup
Did you love her
Huh
Kay Connell
Did you love her
Randy flicks his ash
Shrugs
Sure
She was nice
Will turns with his coffee
"She was nice
"  Wow
That makes me all soft inside
Ever occur to you she didn't love you back
Huh
You heard me that time
She loved me
She wanted to see me every night
But she was seeing someone else on the side
Randy glares
don't know what you're fucking talking about
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about
Stuff
What kind of stuff
Just stuff
don't fucking remember
The other guy
told you  don't remember
After that she left the party to go to him
How should  know
Ran like hell to go to him
Fuck you, man
- 'm sick of all your fucking cop questions
Will suddenly hurls his coffee cup and grabs Randy up by the collar
Nose to nose
Now you listen to me, you little shit
This fuck-the-world-Metallica-t-shirt crap may work with your mamma, but it doesn't work with me
You got mad at your girlfriend because she was seeing someone else
You want to be the last person who saw her alive or are you going to tell me who that is
Randy's lip curls
Red-faced
don't know
You don't know
She didn't tell me
Disgusted, Will shoves Randy back into his seat
- Will walking out of the interrogation room
Ellie joins him
He's a little surly, isn't he
Will smooths back his hair
Checks his tie
Just a little
He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the gold necklace from Kay's room
Hands it to her
want you to check this out, Ellie
We already did
Do it again
But there wasn't any
Will stops
Ellie stops
Will puts a hand on her shoulder
The small things - remember
The second you're about to dismiss something - look at it again
Ellie smiles, teasing
You want me to write that down
Will, has to smile
She's quick
Looks down the hall bearded  on crutches
Ellie follows his gaze
Who's that
The bartender at Darrow's
He was there Friday night
Good
He's up next
Will heads over to him
Ellie watches his neck
Her hand closing over the necklace
-   - The Pioneer Lodge restaurant
Small, dark wood, a playing something between Bluegrass and Folk
Some rough- looking  at the bar
Throwing looks over at
Will and Hap, sitting at a table
Studying faded menus
(reading) Halibut Calabrese
Halibut Olympia
Halibut Cajun Style
Halibut fish and chips
He puts down his menu
Reaches for his drink
(cont'd) Can't wait to see what's for dessert
At least there's variety
Will drains his drink
Locks eyes with a big  over at the bar
Beer froth on his moustache
Looks like the natives are restless
Will
Will looks back at his partner
Hap's fidgeting with the end of his tie
(cont'd) think,  think 'm gonna talk to Buck when we get back to Seattle
cold flash down Will's spine
wish  could stick it out like you just, with Trish and the kids
Don't do this, Hap
Hap avoids his eyes
'm thinking  could get off with probation
Keep half my pension
That's all  want
(hisses) Goddammit, Hap
Think about what you're doing
You don't have to be involved, Will
You tell Buck and 'm involved whether like it or not
(
) Ready to order
The men look up, interrupted
Rachel is standing by the table with a pad
Hap tries to recover with a big smile
Hey - you do everything around here
Just about
Will stands abruptly
Eyes on Hap
Trying not to explode
'll just have another Scotch in my room
(turns to Rachel) If you don't mind
Just then, his cell phone
-   - Will bursts into the bullpen
Hap behind
Where is it
Ellie, Fred, and a couple other  huddled around a desk
Over here
Will and Hap head over to them
One of the younger guys, , intimidated by Will's presence
Tucks his shirt into his dirty jeans
They part to reveal a   laying on the desk
Mud spots all over it
An embroidered daisy
Will examines it
We're sure it's hers
Has her books in it
What about prints
Ellie shakes her head, unfortunately not
Will reaches into the bag
Pulls out two text books
Biology and Algebra
He shoves the books towards one of the guys
(cont'd) Find out who she studied with
He continues through the bag
Pulls out a little plastic bag with "Hello Kittys" all over it
Dumps out the contents
(cont'd) Make-up
Looks up at Fred
(cont'd) Find out where she bought it
Fred looks at him
Not happy with make-up duty
Will pulls out a hair brush
Hands it to Ellie
(cont'd) Lab
Next, a couple worn paperbacks
(cont'd) (reading titles) Otherwise Engaged, Murder at Sunset
He looks up at the group
(cont'd) Who here reads this kind of crap
Farrell straightens
read that kind of crap
Will tosses them to him
Read them
Tell me anything that strikes you
Down to the bottom of the bag
Ziploc with a half-eaten sandwich and an apple core
Will hands them to Ellie
(cont'd) Lab
Upends the knapsack
Scraps, paper clips, gum wrappers
(cont'd) That's it
Fred reaches for the knapsack
'll stick it in the evidence locker
No
Will takes it, walks slowly over to the window
Thinking
Twists the knapsack in his hands and looks out at the standing tall outside
black  alights on top of it
Pecks at the air
Turns
Seems to look right at Will
(cont'd) We put it back where we found it
Will turns to them
(cont'd) You said it was a fishing cabin
Uh, right
About two miles outside of town
On the beach
Fred tightens his jaw
Why are we taking it back
Will ignores the question
Walks back towards them
This murder was in the papers, right
Yeah
All over
Call all of them from here to Anchorage
Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet
(checks watch) We can get it in by the morning editions
He hands the bag to Farrell
(cont'd) Fill this with random books
Make it look heavy
Will pulls out a handkerchief
Wipes the mud off his hands
Taking his time
Finally turns to Fred
(cont'd) It'll eat this guy alive if he thinks he overlooked a detail
-   - through comes into focus
Right by the water
Hasn't been used in years
Weathered, slate roof
Algae growing up the sides
(
) Nice
Lighter than  remembered
lowers his binoculars
He's standing on the black rocky beach
It's damp, slick, and cold
fog's rolling in
Hap and Farrell are sitting behind a cluster of rocks couple paper bags and a megaphone
They're comparing guns
Glock 40
All plastic save the barrel and firing pin
Never rusts
What do you carry down in Seattle
Hap reaches into his holster
Pulls out a
Smith and Wesson 45
Excellent
Fred Duggar's standing on the other side of them
He's got a pair of binoculars, too
They're staking out the cabin
Been there a while
(
) Brought some coffee
Ellie appears with a thermos
Crouching down
Fred turns, annoyed
What are you doing here
(answering for her) told her to come
Fred shoots Will a look
Down at his cowboy boots
Will gives him a smile
Anything yet
Nothing
Nothing
Fred goes back to scanning, pissed
Maybe this guy doesn't read the papers
Or goes straight to the Sports Section
Hap and Farrell chuckle
Hap unscrews the thermos
cloud of steam
(cont'd) Who gets first dibs
(looks up at Will) Will
Will looks down at his partner
Holding out the thermos like a weird kind of truce
Will turns away, rejecting it swath of thick fog unfolds over the black rocks as
Fred tenses
(looking through binoculars) see someone
Hap and Farrell scramble to their feet
Will whips up his binoculars
'  - a  making its way to the cabin
Furtive
(
) That's him
Will lowers the binoculars
Snaps his fingers at the men
(cont'd) Fan out
Fred, Farrell and Hap
Start spreading out
Ellie steps up
Will looks back at her
Too dangerous
(cont'd) Stay here, Ellie
But
Will puts up his hand
She stops short
He plunges ahead
Hap
Will
Farrell
Fred
Fanning out
Silent
Keeping eye-contact
Will points to Farrell
Wants the megaphone
Farrell, balancing on a rock, holds it out
Accidentally keys it
The feedback
Fuck
He's bolting
'  - the , looking around, running towards the cabin
Leaping from rock to rock
reaches for his Smith and Wesson
Go
Go
Go
The men jump into action
Race down towards the cabin
Fred and Farrell, nimble over the wet rocks
Will and Hap, harder going
Grab onto jagged edges, slip down small crevices
Rocks sticking out every which way
The fog, thick and white
disappears into the cabin
leap up onto a tall boulder and jump down
Run over to the door of the cabin, guns at the ready
rounds the boulder, Hap panting behind him
Joins Fred and Farrell at the door
Will levels his Smith and Wesson at the door, and with a nod to Fred as he  it in
- the door  and swings in
The men rush inside
Police
They look around:  Nothing
few old nets, a wooden table rotted through
No knapsack
In the corner, a  , left open
Will races over
Looks down into the darkness
(cont'd) Goddammit
Turns and points to Farrell
(cont'd) You
Head back up to base
(to Fred) You
Go right and follow along the water
(to Hap) Hap
You go left
The men nod
(cont'd) Go
They rush out the door and split directions
Will crouches down by the trap door and
- drops down into a dark, dank
Water dripping
echoing
Will cocks his head
Left or right
Starts sprinting down towards the lighter end of the tunnel, his own footsteps bouncing against the tunnel walls
He rounds a curve
Sound recedes
- He exits the tunnel onto the rocky beach
Stops short
has enveloped everything - obscuring all vision, dulling all sound
Like a strange dream
Eerie
Will blinks against the thick whiteness
Strains to hear any sound, anything
There's only the distant  of the water
He tightens his grip on his gun and plunges into the fog
Quick, careful steps
Stumbles over a rock
Waves his gun in defense
Eyes wide open like a blind man
a
Off to the right
Will whips his head around
- Ellie, alone, jumps at the sound
Reaches for her weapon
- Will heads towards the sound
Reaching out for approaching rocks
Scrambles over a small bank and finds
rolled up into a fetal position on the ground
Clutching his thigh
Blood seeping through his fingers
He looks up
Sorry about
Where is he
Farrell can't answer that
(cont'd) (impatient) Where'd the shot come from
Farrell lifts his bloody hand
Points off towards the water
Over there
Will disappears back into the fog, leaving Farrell behind
Clambers back down towards the water, pausing every few seconds to listen, to adjust
Heart
Blood pumping
Like an animal tracking its prey
Leaps up onto a plateau of rocks when
a flashes past him
The killer
Inches away
Will wheels around
Freeze
Squeezes off a shot
Misses
Can't believe it
Goes for another
Nothing
Jammed
The figure, disappearing
Will tosses his Smith and Wesson, reaches behind his back and whips out his  39/13
- Ellie, weapon drawn, making her way down the rocks suddenly grabs her arm
(
) Dammit, Ellie
Fred emerges from the fog
(cont'd) Put that thing away
Farrell's down
as another shot rips through the air
Fred and Ellie freeze
- Fred and Ellie, skittering down the rocks
Getting closer to the water
Hear a voice ring out
(
) Hap
The fog starts to dissipate
They reach the water to see
kneeling beside the body of his partner
Lying in the water
Shot in the stomach
Blood dribbling from his mouth
Will grabs him up by the collar
Hap
Starts shaking the limp body
Teeth clenched
(cont'd) Hap
Hap's head, rolls back
Mouth agape
Face white
Will, rips off his tie
Presses it to the gaping wound
trying to stop the bleeding
warm blood, pumping into the water
Ellie watches
Horrified
Fred races over to the body
Feels for Hap's pulse
Dormer
Will, shaking Hap again
Jaw set
Eyes intense
Veins popping up along his temples
Fred catches his shoulder
(cont'd) Dormer
He's gone
Will looks up at Fred
His face contorts
Suddenly leaps to his feet
Grabs a rock and hurls it savagely into the thick fog
'  - Chief Nyback sits in his chair
Fingers interlaced somber expression on his face
And then you lost him
Will sits opposite him
Wet, dishevelled, dirty
Hap's blood smeared all over his shirt
Staring off into space
And then  lost him
In the fog
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot
Will, hesitates
Twenty, thirty seconds
followed the sound down to the water
That's where
He blinks
Looks down
Swallows
(cont'd) That's where  found Hap
Nyback sighs, shakes his head
Reaches down to his bottom drawer and pulls out a bottle of bourbon and a glass
think you need a glass of this
He goes to unscrew the bottle, but Will shakes his head
Stands
Paces
Rakes his hand through his hair
Turns suddenly and swipes his arm across Nyback's desk
Everything  to the floor
(yells) Why didn't  know about that goddamn tunnel, Charlie
Nyback looks up at him
Calm
There's a bunch of those tunnels out there, Will
From bunkers over sixty years old
don't even know half of them myself, and  grew up here
Will clenches his fists
had him, Charlie
Right in front of me
Not two feet
could smell the son- of-a-bitch
Playing with me
And missed the shot
He was right there and missed the shot
Then my goddamned gun jammed
Nyback gets up
Limps over to his old friend
Will, you can't blame yourself
had him
It's only gonna make you crazy
Just then there's a soft  on the door
The men look over
Ellie sticks her head in
Speaks in a tone that belies that a man has recently died
You wanted to see me
Will turns his back to her
Nyback heads over
Right, Ellie
Ellie flicks a look at the pile on the floor
At Will's back
(cont'd) want you to take care of the investigation into Detective Eckhart's shooting
Ellie looks at him
Confused
Lowers her voice
But what about the Connell case
'm on the Connell case
Nyback puts a hand on her shoulder
We need paperwork, Ellie
You know that
Just write up a quick report
Ellie's shoulders droop
Thought she was playing with the big boys
Just then Will turns abruptly and grabs his coat
'm going to check on the roadblocks
Nyback catches his arm
You're no good right now, Will
Go back to the Lodge
Try to get some rest
Will looks at him
Know's he's right
-  - a  tire, ripping around a curve
/
- Will driving
Speeding
Scenery whipping past the window
His hands, tight around the steering wheel
The hula-girl, dancing beneath the rear view mirror, a smile plastered to her face
He grows suddenly pale
Pulls the Cherokee off to the side
- Will jumps out of the Cherokee, leaving the door open
Runs down an  behind a row of shops
- couple industrial trash bins
Will leans his hand against the wall and vomits
Hovers for a moment, saliva dripping from his mouth
Braces himself
Heaves again
Hears a behind him
Turns
lying next to a dumpster
buzzing around its head
Teeth bared
Eyes wide open
Like it's watching him
- Will walks up to reception
No one there
Just wants his key
Rings the bell
In the back room, he hears a
earlier this evening after an aborted attempt to apprehend a suspect
He was forty-five
It clicks off abruptly
Rachel appears in the doorway
Takes in the blood on Will's shirt
'm sorry about your partner
Will looks at her
She walks over to the desk
(cont'd) It's been on the radio for the last two hours
Nothing but that
Like when they found Kay Connell's body
(sympathetic smile) We're not used to this sort of thing up here
She reaches for his key
(cont'd) He was standing right there just a couple of days ago
Your partner
Exactly where you are now
(beat) hope  was nice to him
Will takes his key
You were nice to him
He liked you
He smiles faintly, turns to go
Just then the phone
(answering) Pioneer Lodge
(listens) Hold on a second
He's right here
Will stops
Turns
Rachel holds up the phone
Covering the mouthpiece
(cont'd) John Warfield
He's called a couple of times
Will's stomach drops
That's the last phone call in the world he wants to take
Rachel reads his face
(cont'd) Want me to lie
Will shakes his head
Steps back and takes the phone
Clears his throat
(into phone) Dormer
bemused  on the other end
' Detective Dormer
've been trying to reach you
was very sorry to hear about your partner, Detective Eckhart
It must have been a terrible shock, what happened this morning
Will
Not giving this asshole an inch
Rachel, trying not to listen
(into phone) That's not exactly how 'd put it
'  (cont'd) No, no
suppose not
But  look forward to reading the report
Very sad
Very sad
Funny
(into phone) What do you mean, "Funny
" ' Oh, nothing
Just that  felt Detective Eckhart and , Hap and , were starting to make a real connection before you left
sensed that he was ready to get some things off his chest
Did you sense anything like that, Detective mean, as his partner
Will, squeezing the phone cord with his bloody fist
'  (cont'd) You were his partner for, what, about ten years
Will turns from Rachel
Eyes burning
Voice steady
(into phone) You know why everyone hates you, Warfield
It's not your questions, it's not your press conferences, it's not even your cheap suits; everyone hates you 'cause day after day you suck the marrow out of real cops when you never had the balls to become one yourself
Well  got to tell you, it's a shame you're not up here with me because 'd love to show you right now just what a real cop is capable of
You just remember that when you're sitting at your bullshit desk reading your bullshit report on my dead partner
He hangs up the phone
Runs his hand through his hair
Turns back to Rachel
(cont'd) Next time
Go ahead and lie
-   - Fog everywhere
Dense
White
Suffocating
We're running through it
Clambering over rocks
Hearing the sound of our own
Our own
Adrenaline pumping
An animal tracking its prey
a flashes past
Just inches away
Playing with us
Taunting us
We whip round with our weapon and
'  - Will bolts upright in bed
film of sweat over his body
Breathing hard
The sound that woke him: the window shade  open
floods the room
Will gets up
Goes over to the shade and pulls it down
It lurches up halfway
He tugs it down again
It slaps all the way open
Will yanks it down so hard it rips off the window
Goddammit
He gets tangled in it
(cont'd) Goddamned
thing
Pulls it off and flings it in the corner
'  - 4:22
The digital clock flips to a new minute:  4:23
Will, pacing
Scratching at his stubble
Unable to sleep
Keeps stepping on a  floorboard
Slows near the   that leads into Hap's room
Hovers
Lightly pushes the door open
Sees
on the bedside table
and three teenage Hap's family
- 5:18
Water gushing out of the faucet
Will's  sitting on the sink's edge
5:18
Will reaches up into the open medicine cabinet for a bottle of aspirin
Shakes out a couple
Cups his hand under the water and knocks the pills back
Closes the medicine cabinet and  out
' looming behind him
They're watching us, Will
Will whirls around
Hap
nothing
No one's there
-  - running shoes,  the tarmac
to reveal Will running down Nightmute's main street
Eyes bloodshot
walking into a hardware store
Stop talking and glance over at him
in her husband's work shirt
Lifts her small into the cab of a 4x4
Watches him pass
fixing the broken "" on his store front
Turns at the sound of Will's footfall
Everyone edgy
Cautious
murderer amongst them
Will continues on
Looking straight ahead
Wipes the sweat from his neck
Slows to a stop just outside the
blown-up picture of   in the window
Below, a painted sign:  We miss you, Kay
stack of newspapers by the front door
The "Nightmute Ledger
"  The headline:  Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect
Will picks one up
Stares down at it
Rain starts to dot the paper
(
) We're going to bring down a couple of guys from Ridgemount, but  want us to step up the investigation here
-   - Rain hammering against the windows
Chief Nyback addresses the bullpen
Everyone's there except Farrell
Nightmute hasn't lost an officer in thirty-seven years, and even though Detective Eckhart wasn't from here, he was as good as one of us on this case had the honor of working with him down in Seattle for a number of years
He was a fine detective and an even better man
Will stands nearby, watching the rain hit the windows
His suit pants are slightly wrinkled
Nyback nods towards Fred
(cont'd) Fred, you'll be working with Detective Dormer directly from now on
Fred, stroking his moustache, nods
Nyback turns to Will
(cont'd) Will
Anything you'd like to add
Will looks up
Everyone's eyes turn to him
He shakes his head
Okay
Then let's get to it
Feet shuffling
Chairs scraping the floor as people get up
sense of determination in the air
Will grabs his coat
(
) Detective Dormer
He turns
Ellie is beside him, holding a map
(cont'd) 'm sorry to bother you, but  was asked to write the report on
(lowers eyes) you know what  was asked to write the report on
(looks back up) Could you, just to be accurate, for the report, could you just point out where you were when you saw Detective Eckhart yesterday
She holds out the map
It's of the small stretch of coastline
Red circles marking various points
Will looks down at her
Takes the map
Turns it around
It's good to be accurate, Ellie
You're doing your job
He looks down at the map
Ellie watching his face
'm so sorry about what happened
know you did everything you could
Will points to a spot
Cutting her off
was here
Hands her back the map
Smiles
Just then Fred walks up
Dormer
Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell
'm going to the hospital to talk to him now
(looks at his watch) You get the search party together
No fewer than thirty people
'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes
Don't waste any time
He pulls on his coat and heads for the door
Fred watches him leave
Sticks a toothpick in his mouth
Partner or no partner
That guy's a prick
He has to be a prick, Fred
He's a great detective
-
- the cover of one of the paperbacks, Otherwise Engaged by Walter Byrd
to reveal Farrell lying in a hospital bed in striped pajamas, reading it
tear runs down his cheek as he turns the page
is tossed onto his lap
He looks up
Face brightens
Detective Dormer
Will stands by his bed
Farrell puts down the book
Picks up the Snickers
(cont'd) You don't seem like the bring-an- underling-who's-in-the-hospital-a- Snickers-bar kind of guy
'm not
He pulls up a chair
Nods to the paperback
(cont'd) How's the book
Farrell bites into the candy bar
Oh, a real tear-jerker
Brody, the good guy, just got shot
He stops chewing
Realises the association
Swallows uncomfortably
(cont'd) Oh
'm sorry
About Hap
Detective Eckhart
Thanks
wish 'd had the chance to get to know him better
Take him fishing or something
He would have liked that
We just gotta catch the bastard, right
That's why 'm here
need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell
What  saw
Anything
It's important
Farrell takes another bite of the Snickers
Like a little boy
Furrows his brow, trying to remember
Pretty much nothing
That fog was so thick
The bullet seemed to come out of nowhere
don't even remember seeing any shapes
Then  saw you
But only when you came up close
Then you disappeared again
(shrugs) guess  heard more than  saw
Will sighs, rubs his eyes
(cont'd) Sorry
No
No
Don't be sorry
It's not your fault
Just then a  comes in with a Dixie cup
Pretty, freckled face
Not much older than Kay Connell
Time for your meds
Farrell smiles at her, winks at Will
Lonnie and  went to high school together
Lonnie gives him the cup
Just take the pills, Farrell
How's the leg
Oh, you know
Don't feel that much
Bullet went right through
Right
Got lost in the rocks
We'll get the other one, though
Will looks up
Farrell pops the rest of the Snickers in his mouth
(cont'd) After the autopsy
-  - Will walks down the hallway
Light pouring in from a set of high windows
He looks tired
Set-upon
of From a doorway
Not close, not far comes into view
Small
Bruised knuckles
Holds on to the door jamb
Watches as
Will suddenly stops
Skin prickling at the back of his neck
Turns and looks around
in a wheelchair
tugging at her hospital gown
couple of  laughing at check-in
An empty doorway
Nothing
-   - Back at the beach
We see nothing but fog
comes through
(
) and it was at this point that Detective Dormer headed towards the noise
Ellie emerges from the fog
Carrying the map and talking into a small tape recorder
She's climbing over the rocks, wearing a windbreaker a couple sizes too big
follows, carrying a camera
She turns to him
(cont'd) Remember, Kepp, shoot everything
(back to the tape recorder) wherein he discovered the wounded Detective Farrell Brooks, having been shot in the vastus externus of the upper left thigh
She climbs over the same bank Will Dormer climbed two evenings before
Finds
, hanging out and smoking
(cont'd) Francis
He looks up
Pimples on his chin
What
You're supposed to be Farrell
Shot in the thigh and writhing in pain
'mon, Ellie
What's it matter
Accuracy
That's what
(points to the ground) Now get down
Francis looks up at her
Flicks his cigarette away and gets down amongst the rocks
Holds his thigh like he was shot
Ow
Kepp takes the picture
- Ellie sloshes through the water
Ankles getting cold
Cheeks pink
But it doesn't matter
She's investigating
(into tape recorder) shortly after hearing the second shot, Detective Dormer continued through the water until he spotted the body, lying approximately fifteen feet away
She stops
Looks at the map
At the spot Will pointed out
Looks back up
Fog
Clicks off the recorder
Calls out
(cont'd) You there, Rich
calls back
Someone pretending to be Hap
(
) Yeah
And 'm freezing my nads off
Ellie furrows her brow
Just then
appears
Slips on a rock but catches his fall
Ellie
Think  found something
- a row of
Mostly boots
Some more beat-up than others
Inching forward along a road
(
) Anything catches your eye, you put it in a bag
Anything looks strange, you put it in a bag
to reveal a long line of  stretched out across the road about a mile up the beach
Some old, some young
Linking arms and moving forward
Looking down
The Will, walking up and down behind the line
Talking through a megaphone
(cont'd) Anything he may have dropped, moved, kicked, or stepped on, you put in a bag
Cigarette butts, gum wrappers, paper clips, coins, buttons - nine times out of ten a suspect leaves something behind
(
) Detective
Will turns
couple burly  with some
#1 Where do you want us
Will points over to the woods on the other side of the road
The woods
One group heading south, the other heading north
Nods to Fred who's standing nearby
He hands the guys two radios
Make sure they're set to channel 6
Just then two young  pull up in a squad car
Young and apple-cheeked
The first one holding a piece of paper
#1 We did the interviews with all the nearby houses like you asked
Anything
#1 (shakes his head) Here's a list of who we talked to
Hands the list to Will
He glances it
Alright
Go back and set up some follow- ups for this afternoon
The Officers nod, put the car in reverse
Fred saunters over
Nods towards the searchers
You don't think they should start further back
Will shakes his head
He had to have exited here
Over those boulders
saw him move, he's nimble
Would have taken the hardest way out
Fred shrugs, skeptical
Just then, his cell phone
He reaches for it
(into phone) Duggar
Will looks back at the search team
Slow
Meticulous
(cont'd) (into phone) Where was it
local
At the end of the line
Glances over her shoulder
Looks at Will
Smiles
You'll help us catch him
(cont'd) (into phone) Okay
(slaps phone closed) That was Ellie
Will turns back to him
(cont'd) They found Farrell's bullet
Says it looks like a 357
After the autopsy Rich can drive 'em both to the lab in Anchorage
Have a murder weapon by morning
Fred crosses his arms
Sarcastic
(cont'd) That is, if it's alright with you
-  - Thunder
-  - Rachel winding an old grandfather clock with a key
Looks about a hundred years old
Will enters the lobby
Soaked through
Carrying an armload of wet files
Rachel turns, sees him
Reaches over to an umbrella stand
Hands him an umbrella
Here
It's on the house
Will takes it
Preoccupied
Thanks
He starts up the stairs
Notices Rachel straining to return the key to the top of the clock
Backtracks to help her
She gets it without his help
got it
(smiles) Don't know why  bother
It's been broken for two years
Habit
Rachel looks at him
Can't figure this guy out
Remembers something
(cont'd) Oh
man came by to see you earlier
Said he was your new partner
skips down Will's spine
He looks at her
Fred Duggar
No
He didn't say what his name was
Only that you were expecting him
'm not expecting anyone
That's not what he thinks
What did he look like
Rachel thinks for a second
Leaning against the clock
Short
Dark hair
Not that memorable
Will nods, rubs his forehead
Suddenly has a pounding headache
Turns for the stairs
Hesitates
need to borrow something
'  - a nail
One  of a hammer and it bites into the wall
to reveal Will nailing the corner of a blanket to one side of the window
An ad hoc curtain
He finishes that side
Starts to stretch the blanket across the window
Hesitates
Looks outside
To the left
To the right
To see if anybody's out there
If anybody's watching
Sees instead
chugging across the harbor
Pulling a huge freighter
Will squeezes his eyes shut
Opens them again
Pulls the blanket fully across the window
'  - 1:05
The  spread across the floor
Their edges buckled from the rain
Dozens of pictures of Kay Connell
School records
Private letters
Health files
Coroner's report
Will
Pacing
Back and forth
Thinking
Over that same floorboard
The clock reads: 1:05
'  - 2:20
Will lying in bed
On top of the blanket
Wide awake
Staring at the
Into Hap's room
-  - Will, in a sweatshirt and coat, heads down the front steps of the Pioneer Lodge
Jams his hands in his pockets
The walk of an insomniac
-  - Will walking down main street
In the middle of the road
The dead of night
No cars
The sky a blinding white
Hears some rowdy  coming from a corner bar, beer lights flickering
rides by on a bicycle
Birds
Not day
Not night
Stuck somewhere in between
Like a dream
Turns down a side street
Passing more stores
Guns and Ammo
Patty's Hair and Nails
General Store
Comes upon where he vomited the day before
Stops
Sees the  , still down at the end
Half obscured by the dumpster
Will wavers, pale
Suddenly
emerges from the shadows
Big
Wild-eyed
Awakened from his sleep
Will, quickly backtracks to the sidewalk
Spooked
the
of bat hitting ball
He turns
In the distance
Nightmute Elementary School
- Little League game in full swing
The uniforms, a little faded
The diamond, a little unkempt
smattering of Mostly dads with six-packs
Will wanders over to the fence
Spots Ellie sitting alone on the bottom bleacher
: From afar
The  of the game, delayed a few seconds
Watches as Will crosses to the bleachers
: and sits down next to Ellie
She turns, surprised
(cont'd) Detective Dormer
What are you doing here
(looks at watch) It's two-thirty in the morning
Shouldn't you be asleep
Will glances out at the game
could say the same thing about you
Oh
We always have play-offs in the middle of the night
It's the best time
Who's playing
The Puffins and the Hawks
We're in extra innings
The Hawks have a really good line-up this year
She sips on a take-out coke
Looks back at the game plump, redheaded  comes up to bat
Blows a bubble
That's my sister
Will looks over just in time to see the girl swing and miss by a mile
Ellie cups her hands around her mouth
(cont'd) (calling out) That's okay, Lib
(to Will) Usually she's better
She your only sibling
(nods) Twelve years younger
Libby takes another swing
Connects with the ball
Drops the bat and runs to first
Ellie gives a sharp
(cont'd) What about you
You have any siblings
No
(rubs his eyes) Well
had a brother
He died when was eleven
Ellie, sits up
Oh,  shouldn't have
It's okay
Happened a long time ago
He was killed in a fire
In New Mexico
That must have been awful for you
Will leans back
Stretching his legs
Remembering
Not really
(slight smile) remember  was more embarrassed that he had died
Embarrassed that it made me different
So  didn't tell the other kids at school what had happened
They'd ask me where he was, where he'd gone
And 'd make up stories
He was visiting an aunt up north, he'd broken his leg, he was in a Swiss boarding school
Stuff like that
(shakes his head) Nice kid, huh
Just kept making up more and more lies
Suddenly, he stops talking
Slowly sits up
Sensing something
Ellie, noticing the shift
You okay
The row of  behind them
Jump up and start
: Sees him sit up
Look around
That same prickle at the back of his neck
slides home just as
: Will stands
Trying to shake the feeling
'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie
Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records
(unsure) Okay
He turns to go, scanning the area
Ellie calls after him
(cont'd) Try to get some sleep
- The Nightmute morgue
Next morning
pulls up
Francis gets out, whistling
Starts for the morgue's entrance
/
- Will in the Cherokee
Dark circles under his eyes
Suit jacket wrinkled
Pulls in next to Francis' squad car
(calls out window) Officer
Francis turns
'll pick it up
You head back to the station
-   - Will walking down a hallway
Fluorescent lights
Cinderblock walls
On his cell phone
(into phone) Duggar - 'm at the coroner's now
'll be back in about twenty minutes
Stops at an open doorway in time to see pull a sheet over the cold, blue body of Hap Eckhart
Will's heart lurches
He grabs on to the door jamb
Wasn't ready for that
The coroner looks up
Detective
Thought you were sending one of your lackeys
Will clears his throat
Closes his cell phone
thought it was better if  came
Under the circumstances
The coroner nods
Goes to wash her hands
It's different when you know them, isn't it
(nods to clipboard) Just sign over there and she's all yours
Shrugs off her lab coat
She's wearing a blue dress
Looks like a piano teacher
Heads into an adjoining office
Will
Alone
Steps into the room
The smell of formaldehyde
Bloody instruments on a stainless steel tray
Walks towards the clipboard, eyes flicking over to the shape under the sheet when
Hap's  drops down
Thick fingers
Wedding band
Will jumps
(
) Your partner didn't suffer much
The coroner re-emerges from the office with a manila envelope
Hap Eckhart written on it in black pen
(cont'd) Maybe for a minute or two
Will rubs his face
Tries to focus on the clipboard
The coroner holds out the envelope
Smiles
(cont'd) Just enough time to reflect
Thanks, Doc
He takes the envelope
The coroner peers up at him
You're looking a little green, Detective
-   - Fred Duggar, dialing the phone at his cluttered desk
(
) So where's the other bullets
He looks up
Will standing before him, holding the manila envelope
-   - on a key slipping into a padlock
Opens with a
to reveal Fred and Will in a small storage room
Standing in front of an army-green
The evidence locker
Room's stuffed with old files and boxes hanging over a small window
Will glances up
What's with all the moose antlers around here
Fred throws a look over his shoulder
Opens the locker
Lots of moose
- another manila envelope
The name on this one: Farrell Brooks
Fred reaches back for the other envelope
Will, hesitant to give it to him
Feeling the bump of the bullet in the bottom corner
Hands it over
Wipes his brow
When's Rich coming
Fred slides it in beside Farrell's
Closes the locker door
'll call him now
First  need a copy of the key
Fred turns, a twinkle in his eye
This isn't Seattle, Detective
We don't have copies
(holds up key) This is the only one
Will looks at him
At the key
Plucks it from his hand
Just then Nyback's  appears in the doorway
Detective Dormer
Telephone
-   - The secretary hands Will the phone
Pulls something from under the desk
beat-up
Will's name on it
This came for you earlier
Will glances at it
Takes the phone
Rubs his eyes
(into phone) Dormer
Nothing
Someone's there but they're not saying anything
Will, too tired for this shit
(cont'd) Goddammit, Warfield, if you're gonna check up on me every
Then
the
's voice
Not John Warfield's
This voice is medium-ranged
Higher
Nose sounds stuffed
' bet you haven't been getting much sleep
Will straightens
Something weird
(into phone) What
little  on the other end
' You lower-48s
You think the white nights are kind of neat
Then you can't sleep for days
've seen it happen about a million times
But you can't sleep for a different reason
(into phone) Who is this
Will loosens his tie
(into phone) said, who is this
The voice
Dropping to a
' saw what really happened, Will
Will, furrows his brow
' saw you kill your partner
With your back-up weapon
Out there on the beach
saw you shoot him dead
Will Dormer's face
As all the blood drains from it
As all fades around him
As his heart begins to  against his chest
He falters, reaching out for the desk
To steady himself
As if the floor's just dropped out beneath him
Eyes, darting around the bullpen
(sotto, into phone) Now you listen to me
' Don't worry
won't tell anyone
Oh, and  saw you take my gun
My uncle's old 357
dropped it in the rocks
But you can go ahead and keep that
, exits his office
Looks at Will and smiles
'  (cont'd) mean
(beat) Now that we're partners
The line goes dead
Will, throat constricted
Listening to the
Smiles back at Nyback
Turns
Slowly hangs up the phone
White as a sheet
Trying to act normal
Trying to act calm
returning to the bullpen, like nothing's different
Looks over at sitting on the edge of the secretary's desk
He reaches for it
Carefully, rips the packing tape
Bends back a flap
Inside, some dark blue material
An embroidered daisy
Kay Connell's knapsack
- Will, heading for the Cherokee
Clutching the box
Face pale, pace quick
Everything's different now
(
) Detective Dormer
He closes his eyes
Now is not the time
Reaches the Cherokee
Yanks open the driver's side door
Ellie catches up with him
Out of breath
You look like you're in a hurry
just wanted to ask you about these pictures
She smiles, holds up some
They're of the
The ones Kepp took
Almost all fog
(cont'd) know they're not great quality, but this is where you said you were when you first saw Detective Eckhart, right
Will
Barely glancing at them
Tosses the box into the car
Right
Gets in and closes the door
Puts his hand over the box
Ellie comes up to the window
But here's the thing
retraced your exact steps according to your statement
You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there
mean, not in that fog
Then change it
How much closer would you say you were
don't remember
Five feet
Seven feet
Will, about to seriously lose his shit
Looks at Ellie
Eyes dark, distant
Listen, Ellie
don't have time for this shit
Five feet, seven feet, twenty feet
Put down whatever you want in your report, alright
He turns the ignition
Pulls out with a
Ellie steps back, watching him drive away
More curious than stung
- The Cherokee
Parked off-road
remote spot by the water
The driver's side door, left open
The -- of the interior
- Will Dormer, walking along a breakfront
Aimless
One foot in front of the other
Staring out at nothing
The endless sea
Waves
Wind
Seagulls
Everything
Closing in on him
He stumbles over a rock
Grabs his head in his hands
Stunned
Guilty
Ashamed
Fucked
He saw it
He saw it
, explodes nearby
Drenching him in sea spray
Will turns, raking his hand across his face
Blinking
Eyes stinging
Trying to focus
Trying to think this through
Hears a dog  in the distance
Shakes his head
Looks at his watch
Got to deal with the problem at hand
'  -   - Will, bursts into his room at the Lodge
The shoulders of his coat still wet with sea spray
Crosses to the area of the floor where Kay Connell's files are still spread out
Starts pressing the floorboards with the toe of his boot
Testing
Testing
Until
he finds the one that
Gets down on his knees
Hesitates
Then jams his fingers in around the loose board
Starts pulling it up
Face reddening
Knuckles whitening
Slips his hand into the gap
Pulls out a muddy 357
The killer's gun
Will, stares down at it
- Will, standing at the mouth of the
Just like the night before
Steps inside
Cautious
Eyes darting
Peering into the shadows for the
Not there
Coast's clear
Heads for the dumpster at the end of the alley
Shoves it aside
Looks down at
The
Rancid
Rotting
Will gags
Holds a handkerchief to his face
Waving away the flies
Then
Pulls the 357 Ruger from his pocket
Shrugs his coat off and wraps it around his hand and the gun
Looks away
Fires a muffled  into the dog's side
The body kicks
Crouches down
Feels along the dog's ribs for the bullet's point of entry
Finds it
Pulls out a  and extends one of the blades
Cuts into the gash, fingers probing deep for the lodged bullet
He finds it
Pulls it out
Looks back at the dog
Takes a deep breath
Wipes his brow
little smear of the dog's blood left on his forehead
Turns and pulls a bottle of   from his pocket
Douses the bullet
Cleaning it
Glancing at his watch
Running out of time
- The rear of the Nightmute  building
Will, looking around, heads briskly for the back door
-   - steps into the  leading towards the bullpen
Hears Nearby
Ducks back
Waiting for them to fade
Safe
Heads down towards the
Glancing briefly at the  hanging on the wall
Of old time Striking brave poses
-   - The storage room
Hot
Stifling
The moose antlers over his shoulder
Will pulls the evidence locker key from his pocket
Unlocks the padlock
Swings the door open
Pulls the Hap Eckhart envelope out
Throwing a look over his shoulder
Opens it
Shakes out the bullet that was lodged in Hap's spine
Then fishes a plastic bag from his pocket
The bullet he shot into the dead dog
Drops that into the envelope and reseals it
Hands shaking
Something
Catches the corner of his eye
He turns
in the locker mirror
The blood smear still on his forehead
(
) Dormer
Will jumps
Quickly wipes the smear off and turns
Fred Duggar standing behind him
by his side
Will clears his throat, shoves Hap's envelope into Fred's hand
Then Farrell's
Angry
These should have gone out two hours ago
the locker door and brushes past him
Fred and Rich exchange a glance
-  - a  's face
Dark hair held up in two barrettes, wind tousling the curls
Reading from a piece of paper
And that's how  think Kay would want us to remember her
to reveal Kay Connell's funeral
standing by the grave, most of them
The sky's a brilliant blue
Red fireweeds blanket the hillside
(cont'd) Swimming, reading, hiking through the Kebaughs
, stand off to the side
Dressed in black
Fred looks like he's never worn a tie before
Ellie holds a potted plant gift for the bereaved
(cont'd) playing her flute, meeting at Darrow's after school
Will
Eyes bloodshot
Not really listening
Not really paying attention
thousand miles away
Tugs at his collar
Feels tight
And always, always with a smile on her face
The young girl looks up
Folds the paper closed
People Mrs
Connell, reaches out to squeeze her arm
Some
Start circulating with plastic buckets
Filled with white carnations
Handing them out
(
) Want one
Will, startled, looks down
stands before him
Curly hair
Glasses
Holding up a bucket
He shakes his head
Looks back up at lining up to place the carnations on Kay's casket
with a brass-tipped cane
Two , look like sisters, holding each other up
with a thick red beard
, about five, clutching a  tied with a pink ribbon
Will, looks away
Then
At the end of the line
Something catches his eye
in tight jeans and a down vest
In front of him stands a with white-blonde hair
From the torn pictures in Kay Connell's room
Will, straightens at the sight of her
Sees Randy surreptitiously caress her ass
- The service is over
People are heading back to their cars
Fred yanks off his tie
Looks at Ellie
We should go say hello to Mrs
Connell
He starts off
Ellie, looks back at Will
You go ahead
'll be there in a second
Ellie nods
Catches up to Fred
Will turns his attention back to
Over at the far end of the cemetery
Standing next to Randy's motorcycle
- Randy gets on his bike, strapping his helmet on
The girl's about to get on behind him
(
) Why don't  give her a ride
They look over
walking towards them
The wind whipping his jacket
His tie
Randy makes a face
Thought  smelled something
Good to see you, too, Randy
Will arrives at the bike
The girl,  , looks at him curiously
Her long white-blonde hair, her skin almost translucent
Something sexy about her
Has the carnation stuck in the buttonhole of her jean jacket
Who're you
- Fred shakes Mrs
Connell's hand
Ellie waits
Looks over and sees standing with Tanya and Randy
Shifts the plant in her hands
- Will shows the gold shield on his belt
Fuckin' cop
Randy kick starts the bike
It dies
He kicks it again
Calls out over his shoulder
You coming or not
-  - Sunlight dappling through tall fir trees
Will drives
Tanya sitting next to him
Her black skirt riding up
Picking at the flaking polish on her nails
never met anyone from Seattle before
You're not missing much
What are you doing in this shit-hole town
Will, shifts
Looks over
You were good friends with Kay Connell, weren't you
Tanya hesitates
Pulls a cigarette from her purse
was her best friend
Best friend
Since grade school
That's a long time
We were like sisters
Knew everything about each other
Must be tough for you
What happened
Tanya shrugs
Lights the cigarette
Takes a drag
Everybody says 'm holding up great, considering
Don't even care if  go to school
They're all worried  haven't cried yet
She stretches
Her midriff showing
Shifts her body towards Will
(cont'd) But there's no law against not crying, right
What about Kay's other friends
Tanya makes a face
Reaches out and taps the hula-girl
Do we have to talk about Kay
don't want to talk about her right now
Let's just drive
Go somewhere
Will looks over at her
She blows out a plume of smoke
Smiles
Seductive
You want me to take you somewhere
Long as it's fun
She reaches out a sinewy arm
Starts massaging the back of Will's neck
(cont'd) Young, impressionable girl left alone with older, Seattle detective
Who knows what we could get up to
Will, impervious to the touch
Head, throbbing
Reaches for the gear
His foot, pressing harder on the gas
-   - The Cherokee whips around a curve
- Tanya giggles
Likes the speed
Will, goes even faster
- The Cherokee breaks free from the forest
Racing along a coastal road
Water  against the rocks
Up ahead, a   coming the other way
The Cherokee shifts lanes
Heading straight for the truck
- Tanya looks out at the truck
Still giggling
How about this
You like this
The truck
Will goes faster
Tanya takes her hand from Will's neck
Holds on to her seat
- The gap's closing fast
The truck  again
- Tanya looks over at Will
Not giggling any more
Hey
Thought you wanted something fun
Will goes even faster
- The truck and the Cherokee
On a collision course
The truck  wildly
- Tanya squirming in her seat
Not liking this any more
Move over
Will staring dead ahead
Tensing his jaw
The
bearing down on them
Tanya reaches for the wheel
Will pushes her hands away
The
a breath away
(cont'd) (screaming) Move over, you crazy fuck
- The truck and the Cherokee
just feet from each other
at the last moment
the Cherokee jerks out of the way
- to a stop near an old sign, Icicle Cannery
Gravel flying
Will gets out
Slams his door
Rounds the car and opens Tanya's door
She's screaming at him
You crazy son-of-a-bitch
You could have killed us
Will reaches in and pulls her out of the car
(cont'd) Ow
You're hurting me
Will pulls her up a steep hill of garbage and broken crates
Pushes her down the other side
She stumbles
(cont'd) You want to tell me what the fuck this is all about
Will stands above her, on the hill
His face set like stone
You and Kay were like sisters
That's what  said
Told each other everything
(heads down the hill) That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau
Tanya steps back
(cont'd) Why her boyfriend's hand was clamped on your ass at her funeral
He grabs her by the arm
Jerks it up
She  out
Will leans in
(cont'd) You like games, little girl
Well how about this one - you're standing right where her naked body was found wrapped up in a garbage bag
Tanya's eyes grow wide
She looks around her
Disgusting, rotten
pecking at the body of a dead bird
She tries to break away
No
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz
Tanya looks away
(cont'd) Who gave her those dresses
She struggles more
No good
Will's grip is like a vice
(cont'd) need a name
don't know
You don't know
She wouldn't tell me
But you were such good friends
Tanya, squirming
Angry
It was like some big fucking secret
What was
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here
Leave us all behind
That he was going to take her
Who
My arm
Who
She used some stupid code name
What was it
Brody
don't know
(crying) Something Brody
Will straightens
He's heard that name before
Suddenly Tanya jams her heel into his shoe
He  out
She breaks away from him
Runs up the hill
Turns
Tears streaking her face
Throws the carnation to the ground
(cont'd) You happy now, you fucking bastard

Running along a row of book spines

Byrie
to reveal will in Nightmute's small bookstore
Still in his funeral clothes
In the "Mystery
" section
Not finding what he wants
Then, something catches his eye:     at the end of the aisle
Will limps down to it
Avoides eye-contact with a shelving "New Arrivals
" Reaches into the bin
Rummages through some paperbacks
Then he finds it:  Otherwise Engaged by Walter Byrd
Underneath the title, he finds what he's looking for: Another
Brody Mystery
Flips to the inside of the cover
of Walter Byrd
Head turned to the side
Walter Byrd was born in Watson Lake, Canada
He graduated
Will's eyes skip down to the bottom: Mr
Byrd currently lives in Umkumiut, Alaska, with his two labrador retrievers, Lucy and Desi
Will looks up
Slaps the book closed
/
-  - Will drives, sipping take-out coffee
Trying to fight the stinging in his eyes
Passes a sign:  Umkumiut, 30 miles
-  - Will stands in a phone booth at the gas station
Flips through the phone book
His finger tracing down the ""s
Finds it:  Walter Byrd, 451
Diamond Tooth, Apt
-  - Sky's become overcast
Will stands across the street from a pale blue building
On the ground floor, a tackle store
Above, looks like several apartment units
He starts across
-  - Will heads down a narrow hallway
Tiled floor
Passes door "
"  Stops at the next one, "
"  Knocks
Hears nothing but the muted tv from apartment "
"  Pulls out his gloves
'  - With a  the door swings open
Will, gloves on, pockets his credit card
Hears the   of dog collars as stand at attention,
Will's prepared
Takes a bag of treats from his pocket
Lucy
Desi
The dogs break
Trot over to him
Wolf down the treats
Will scans the place
Small, cheap
Matching sofa and easy chair, corduroy upholstery
The walls, lined with old 1950s movie posters
All second-rate detective movies:  "Another Shot in the Dark," "Lady Luck," "He wore a Black Hat
" Will walks across the room
Repulsed
The pathetic hovel of a killer
Looks into the Single bed
Books and magazines
half-eaten tuna sandwich on the bedside table
" " calendar on the wall
It's quiet
He walks over to a large  by the window
Scattered papers
Computer
Mini cassette recorder
On the wall, hundreds of newspaper articles
Some yellowing, some fresh
All about cops: "Officer Louis Saved My Life
" "Shoot-out in Soho," "South Street Cop Takes Down Drug Ring," "Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect
" Will curls his lip
Starts looking through the papers on the desk
Underneath a stack, he finds an 8x10
It's of Byrd, standing in front of a big, lakeside in the background
Walter Byrd's face is blurred, turned to the side
The photo from the book bio
Will takes it
Starts roughly opening drawers
box of animal crackers, a rubber band ball
Then, shoved in the back of the top drawer, an
Will flips through to today's date
Blank
Shoves the book into his pocket
Slams the door closed
Then reaches back for his Smith 39/13
Checks the magazine
Slaps it back in place
He's ready
the phone
beige rotary on the desk
Plugged into an ancient answering machine
It  again
The answering machine
Then
' Now you're mad at me
Will freezes
'  (cont'd) spotted your car around the corner
You must have been in a hurry
Put some pieces together
Don't worry,  would have done the same thing
Will turns back to the window
Looking furiously
'  (cont'd) Anyway
(blows nose) 'm not coming home
So you shouldn't wait there all day
mean, they'll wonder about you at the station
You should be careful about following procedure, Will, especially now that
Will lunges for the phone
Snatches it up just as
the tape cuts off
Goddammit
Enraged, he  the receiver through the wall
-  - Will exits the apartment
Cradling his hand
Looks down at the tile floor
Scanning it for a broken tile
Finds one
Bends down and plucks out a broken corner
Places it carefully where the bottom of the door meets the door jamb
Just then
His  goes off
-   - Will strides into the bullpen
Wounded hand in pocket
Ellie hunts and pecks at a typewriter
Glances up
Fred, over in the corner
a drawer in the filing cabinet
Turns
Forget your pager
What
beeped you over two hours ago
Holds out a one-page report
(cont'd) Got a fax from the lab
Murder weapon was a 357 Ruger
Will takes the report
Heads over to the coffee machine
Good
And something else that might interest you
He reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a book
Holds it up
Otherwise Engaged
In hardback
(cont'd) Remember this
Will blinks
No
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack
Will pours himself a cup of coffee
Trying to keep the stream steady
Ellie continues typing
That's right
Mrs
Connell found this copy in the house
(opens it up) It's signed
Personally
So
This is a local writer
Kay had all his books
think we should check it out
Will rubs his chin
Looks back at the report
Judicious
don't think it'll lead anywhere
The  stops
Will turns around
Ellie's staring right at him - that isn't like him
He turns back to Fred
Beat
(cont'd) Well
If he's local
Give him a call
The  resumes
-    -  - dark stairway
Late at night
Will, bathed in shadows
Climbs to the top
Quietly, carefully
He heads down a hallway
We recognise it
Back where Walter Byrd lives
Will approaches apartment "
"  Slowly pulls out his weapon
Cocks it
Waits a beat then swings out in front of the door
Ready to fight
Ready to confront
Looks down
Tile corner's still there
/
-  - Walter Byrd's   laying open
Scrawled in pencil:  8:30
Dr
Agee
to reveal Will sitting in the parked Cherokee
The appointment book on the passenger seat
Been there all night
Insomnia
Taking its toll
His hair, no longer neatly combed
His face, pale and unshaven
His eyes, dragged open from fatigue
Looks like the whole world's pulling him down
Staring down the street at a on the corner
placard by the front door: Dr
Florence Agee,
Will checks his watch
Rubs his eyes with the heels of his hands
Suddenly
Something tells him to look up
in the distance, walking along the road
Towards Dr
Agee's
He's in his forties
Short, shoulders sloped
Wears a beige, zip-up windbreaker, khakis, brown desert boots
has a bulky hearing aid in one ear
Is looking down at the road
Glances up
Byrd, slows his pace
Will, reaches for the door handle
Byrd turns in the other direction, starts walking fast
Will leaps out of the Cherokee and heads after him
his short legs pumping, spots a   across the road
Veers over to it
a runner's stride
Weaves through
Closing in on Byrd
Sees his plan
Cuts across the road just as
- rounds the corner
Broadsides him
Will's pitched up and over the hood
Falls hard on the tarmac
Dazed for a second
Blood, gushing from his forehead
Hears the - open
running over to him
'  (
) Are you alright
You popped out from nowhere
More  running over
'  (
) He okay
Will opens his eyes
Trying to focus
Looks up and sees, in the distance
getting on the tour bus
Will struggles to his feet
The   who hit him, wearing overalls
Reaches out
don't think you should move
Will stands, wavering
Flashes her his badge
/
- The old lady rips along in the truck
Will sits in the passenger seat, a handkerchief to his forehead
It's soaked with blood
The lady looks over
You sure you're okay
'm fine
Careful not to bleed on my interior
Will looks over at her
Shifts in his seat
Ouch
Feels like a couple cracked ribs
Peers out the windshield at the a few cars ahead of them
- of the pick-up tailing the tour bus
windy coastal road
Beyond it, a blanket of endless evergreens
-   - at the end of the pier
small wooden booth for selling tickets
Beautiful, sweeping snow-capped mountains on the other side of the bay
Nothing else for miles around
The pick-up pulls up next to the bus and a couple other cars
Will jumps out
Scans the area for Byrd
Nothing
Then, sees the last few  boarding the ferry
- Ferry's getting pitched around in the roiling water
Most everyone is inside
with throw-away cameras, backpacks, anoraks,
Some looking sea-sick in the corner
Will weaves through the crowd
Eyes darting, searching
The ferry lurches to one side, the crowd sways, Will spots standing by a window
- Walter holds on to the railing
Looking at the view, the sea spray
Will comes up
Stands next to him
Cognizant of the people around them
Walter Byrd
Walter continues looking out the window
That same stuffed- nose voice
When  was seven my mother and grandmother took me to Vancouver
We were walking along the street one day when these two men ran past and snatched my grandmother's purse right from under her arm
Right from under her arm
That night a police officer came to our hotel room to ask us questions
Stood the whole time
The ferry pitches again
Will grabs on to the railing
Looking down at this little man
Hate in his eyes
(cont'd) His uniform looked brand new
His shoes and badge were polished, his billy club, his belt buckle
All perfect
He was like a soldier, but better
Walter reaches up to blow his nose
Will's eyes look on in disgust - his knuckles are still red and swollen
From beating Kay Connell to death
(cont'd) Made a huge impression on me
His goodness
Gave me an instant respect for the police
tried to become a cop when left high school, but
He points to his hearing-aid
(cont'd) Congenital problem
The ferry's engine  to a stop
Walter smiles
(cont'd) Oh
We're here
- Gendreau Glacier
Spilling down between two huge mountains
Enormous in its whiteness, its coldness, its silent power
Will and Walter walk up its face, away from the other tourists
Walter leads the way
Hands in his pockets
You know this glacier moves a quarter of an inch every day
He points off to the horizon
(cont'd) And on a clear day you can see all the way over to Newtok
There's a beautiful aviary over there
We can go sometime
Will's lip curls
Watching him
(cont'd) It's actually cool for this time of year
Normally the temperature runs about
Will lunges at him
Walter's eyes widen in surprise as he grabs him up by the collar
Nose to nose
Will barely keeping control
You think this is a nice meeting we're having here
Friendly
Two people getting acquainted
(jerks him harder) You sick, coward, fuck
get up every morning of my life just to bring someone like you down
Beating a seventeen year- old girl to death
Washing her afterwards, cleaning her
Make you feel like a real man
(tightens his grip) Huh
Walter flounders
(cont'd) outta end this right now
Take a rock and smash your fucking skull in
His jaws tense, nostrils flare
Walter, red-faced, sputtering
stood right behind you
saw you look right into his eyes and shoot him
Will clenches his teeth
(cont'd) Seattle's great hero
Shooting his own partner
saw it all
That was an accident
You hear me didn't know it was him
(shakes him hard) didn't know it was him
Just then a
Will looks over Further down the glacier
Having a snowball fight
Will looks back at Walter
Has to take it easy
Shoves him away in disgust
Walter falls down onto the snow
Dislodges his hearing aid
Watches Will pace
Head throbbing
Ribs, screaming in pain
Then why lie about it
Walter brushes the snow off the dislodged hearing aid
Puts it back around his ear
(cont'd) mean, 'm all for bending the truth
That's what  do in my novels
It's my trade you might say
But why cover it up
Gets up
Brushes the snow from his butt
Checks something in his pocket
(cont'd) You don't have to tell me if you don't want to
'm sure you have some reason
Something noble
have faith in that
Looks down at the kids
Shakes his head
(cont'd) They should be bundled up better
What's your game, Byrd
Walter turns back to him
No game
The phone call
The knapsack
Walter shrugs
figured we're partners on this one mean, after what  saw
Will stops short
Eyes burning
It's all he can do not to throttle this weed
Let's get one thing straight, Byrd
We are partners on nothing
Walter looks at him
Scratches his head
research my novels
know the procedures
You'd have cuffed me back at the ferry
You'd have called for back- up, read me my rights, and gotten a search warrant for my apartment
You're a well-respected detective
There's no reason for you to be talking to me right now
He takes out a handkerchief
Blows his nose
(cont'd) except that we could help each other
Will stares at him
(cont'd) So
We're at an impasse
Will runs his hands through his hair
Half-crazed
Heart pounding
Turns to watch
down the glacier
Making angels in the snow
Their carried along by the wind
Will, squeezes his eyes shut
Trapped
About to defy every instinct in his body
(sotto) You're going to get a phone call
Walter steps up, tapping his hearing aid
'm sorry
said you're going to get a phone call
(perks up) Oh
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books
Thought you might find that
You're going to be brought in for questioning
Walter smiles
Pleased
Down at the station
(hisses) Yes down at the station
Walter rubs his hands together
Thinking
Okay
Okay
Brought in for questioning
Good
can write this
the ferry blows its
Low and loud
Walter looks down at it
(cont'd) Ferry's leaving
He starts down
Will watches him pass, has no choice but to follow
Walter, going over the details in his head
(cont'd) Something to divert
Snaps his fingers
An idea
(cont'd) My gun
You still have my gun, right
Will nods
Walter smiles
Spreads out his hands
(cont'd) Then that's the wild card
Every detective story has a wild card
What do you mean, "wild card
" Boarding the ferry
Next ferry's in forty-five minutes
Walter heads over to the ramp
Will stops, grabbing his side
through his ribs
Excruciating
Calls out to Walter
What do you mean "wild card
" Walter looks back
Waves
You'll know
At the questioning
Gives his ticket to the
Gets on
Walks back to the stern
Looks out at Will
The  sounds again
Walter, at the rail
Smiles
The ferry's engine, churning up water
Starting forward just as
Walter takes a    from his pocket
Holds it up for Will to see
Will, on shore, sees it
cold flash ripping through his body
That motherfucker
Bolts through some tourists towards the ramp but
couple of  are just pulling it in
The Ticket Taker, grabs his arm
(to Will) Full up
Will, jerks his arm away
Stares off at the ferry
Walter Byrd and his tape recorder
Receding into the distance
-  - a counter top
Stuff thrown down
Aspirin
Band- aids
Gauze
Medical tape
First aid cream
Back pills
Sleeping pills
Bottle of scotch
to reveal Will standing at the counter in the convenience store
His entire body aching
The , throws him a look
have a cold
- Will exits the store
bag under his arm
We Miss You, Kay looming over his shoulder
Steps out onto the sidewalk and sees
leaning against her truck
Waiting for him
Smiles
Which way are you walking
tingle, all across Will's body
Christ
This girl's everywhere
He hunches into his coat
Flicks up his collar
Doesn't want her to see him fully
Nods down the road
Back to the Lodge
Ellie grabs her bag
Joins him
They start walking
needed to get your signature on something
She pulls a folder from her bag
(cont'd) The report on Detective Eckhart
Chief made me finish it this morning
Said it was taking too long
Will takes the file
Flips it open
The death of his partner
Neatly typed
Neatly stapled
Pulls out a pen
(cont'd) Aren't you going to read it
trust you
He signs
Hands it back to her
She slips it into her bag
(cont'd) Now  can help you with the Connell case
That writer's coming in tomorrow
Walter Byrd
slight stutter in Will's step
Duggar called him
About an hour ago
Said he was more than happy to cooperate
Ellie looks over at Will as they cross the street
Studying his face
His gait
Noticing the slight limp in his right leg
The cut on his forehead
(cont'd) You haven't been sleeping much, have you, Detective Dormer
They arrive at the stone steps of the Pioneer Lodge
Not really
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop
good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing
bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him
(smiles) You said that once, remember
Will, finally looks at her
No
But it sounds like something would've said
Turns and starts up the steps
(cont'd) See you tomorrow, Ellie
Ellie, watches him for a second
Then calls out
Oh
forgot to tell you
The Puffins won
Will stops, turns to look back at her
Confused
(cont'd) The baseball game
Our team
Slings the bag over her shoulder
(cont'd) We won
'  -   - Clock flicks to 3:00
Will, pacing in his room
Shirt off
Rib cage wrapped in a bandage
Looking through
All from John Warfield
He discards them one by one
Can barely focus
the phone
He lunges for it
(grabbing it) Listen to me, you son-of-a-bitch
Interrupted by a
saw you look right into his eyes and shoot him
Walter Byrd's voice
Recorded from that afternoon
(cont'd) Seattle's great hero
Shooting his own partner
saw it all
Will, hears his own voice
(cont'd) That was an accident
Goddammit, Byrd
Then, another clumsy
Walter Byrd gets on
You'd have done the same thing, Will know you would
He hangs up
Will  down the receiver
Then again
And again
Yanks the cord out of the wall and  the phone across the room
-   - The
Disappearing back into the fog
Closing in around him like milky water
We whip out our  39/13
plunge in after him
taking chase
hard
leaping from rock to rock
the , blanket thick
tightening around us
Our feet
Hit water
Up to our ankles
Icy cold
We run
sloshing through
when
Appears ahead
Big and hulking towards us
We raise our weapon
quick as a flash
as the emerges
And in a split second
's - his eyes, brown and gentle
We fire
The  grips his gut, falls into the water
Heart
Adrenaline
We slosh towards the body
Something
catching our eye
357 lying in the rocks
Off to the side
We grab it
Turn back to the body
And stop cold
That's when it hits us
That's when we realize
'  - Will bolts up
White as a sheet
didn't know
His body, drenched in sweat
His breathing, quick and ragged
Caught up in the twisted sheets of his bed
Looks across the room and sees sitting in the corner
Eating an apple with a penknife
You sure about that, buddy
He smiles
Sympathetic
Looks over at the window just as
The
Drops to the floor
floods the room
'  - 4:02
With a  Will puts his back into it
Shoving the heavy oak bureau towards the window
Sweat beading his face
few
more
shoves
And the bureau finally stands in front of the window
WIll stands back to take a look
Only covers half of it
Fuck
'  - 4:35
Red-faced, Will leans into the wooden armoire
Shimmying it towards the window
: - Ellie
Sitting in her truck
Parked behind the Pioneer Lodge
Rubbbing her eyes
Sleepy
Looking up at ' concerned
: '  - 4:35
With one last heave, Will gets the armoire to the window
Light still shining through the cracks
'  - 4:50
Will shoving magazines, blankets, sheets, pillows
Anything
To fill the cracks
To cover the light
His eyes
Like a crazy man's
a knock on the door
Will turns
(
) Detective Dormer
- Rachel standing out in the hallway
Will opens the door
(startled by his appearance) Will
What is it
There's a guy down the hall
Complaining about the noise
(beat) Says he can't sleep
Will gives a half-smile
Fucking irony
Heads back into
'  - his room
Rachel follows
Looks around at the mess
Are you alright
Will grabs up a sweater
'm fine
He heads back over to the window
Rachel now notices all the stuff piled up
Softens her voice
Did something happen
Will
Cramming the sweater into a crack
No
Rachel walks up behind him
His cramming, more desperate
More urgent
Will
He grabs a magazine
The light
It keeps coming in
Rachel reaches out
Catches his arm
Will
He stops
Looks down at her hand
(cont'd) What happened
Will suddenly realises what he's doing
Absurd
Pathetic
Pitiful
Slowly turns to face Rachel
Her eyes, looking up at him
His shoulders droop
Exhausted
Rachel reaches up
Catches him in her arms
Strong arms
Caring
Will buries his face in her neck
Wants to be swallowed up
Rachel holds him
Arms encircling
Will breathes her in
Sweet, soft, safe
Looks up
His mouth suddenly finding hers
kiss, hungry, urgent
His arms move to surround her
'  - Will and Rachel in bed
Spooning
Rachel behind will, her finger tracing his scar
Rain  against the window
Will
Watching the raindrops streaming down the glass
Casting strange shadows against the wall
There was this guy named Weston Dobbs
Twenty-four
Worked as a part-time stock boy in a copy store
Every morning he'd sit at the only window in his apartment and watch an eight year-old boy get picked up by his carpool across the street
And every afternoon he'd watch the boy get dropped off again
He did this for about six months
Until one day he got up the nerve to cross the street and grab the boy before his carpool came
Kept him in his apartment for three days
Tortured him
Raped him
Made him do things
Will tenses his jaw
Rachel, listens in horror
(cont'd) When he was done, he got a rope and a kitchen stool and hanged the boy in the basement of the apartment building
But he didn't do a good enough job
The little boy's neck didn't break and he died from shock
The landlord found him five days later
Rachel reaches for Will's hand
Squeezes it
One of your cases
Me and Hap
year and a half ago knew the second  met Dobbs that he was guilty
Smug, cold
Dead eyes
We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it
Nothing concrete
Went over every inch of that apartment
He pauses
What happened
Will turns slowly over to face her
Her hair, splayed out on the pillow
Her cheeks, flushed
Her eyes, listening
We took some blood samples from the boy's body and planted them in his apartment
(beat) Arrested him the next day
Rachel looks at him
Goose pimples on her arms
Realising the weight of the confession
Will
There've been other cases
Where we've changed results
Pushed witnesses
Manipulated evidence
(rubs his face) But Dobbs
wanted Dobbs more than anything
He sits up
Abrupt
Wincing from the pain in his ribs
Rests his arms on his knees
What if someone finds out
We're under investigation now
Back in Seattle
(beat) Hap wanted to talk
As soon as we got back
Thought he could work out some kind of deal
Rachel rubs his shoulder
Well, that's not going to happen now
Will closes his eyes
The rain,
Rhythmic
Do you think it was wrong
What we did
There's a
Rachel, studying Will's back
The cuts
The bruises
Not sure how to answer
There are two kinds of people in Alaska
Those who were born here and those who've come here to escape something in their lives
(beat) wasn't born here, Will
'm in no position to judge anyone
'm not about that any more
Looks out the window
(cont'd) It's all about what you're willing to live with
'  - The clock reads 6:00
Will pulls on his trousers
Goes to strap on his Smith 39/13 holster
Grimaces with pain
Looks at his back in the full-length mirror
seeping out from under his bandage
Puts the 39/13 and holster in the top drawer of the bureau
Turns and looks down at Rachel
Sleeping soundly
(
) You were acquainted with the deceased, Kay Connell
- Will in the interrogation room
Standing by the window
Tensed jaw
(
) Yes  was
sits at the table
Hair combed, wet
Shirt newly starched
Styrofoam cup of coffee in front of him
Playing the part
Fred sits opposite him
Report file open
Ellie, next to Fred
Taking notes
She's combed her hair, too
In what manner
Walter smiles modestly
Looks over at Ellie
She was, not quite a "fan
"  More an avid reader of my detective novels
When did you first meet her
Fred shoots Ellie a look
She closes her mouth
year ago
At one of my signings
Ellie hands Fred the hardback of Otherwise Engaged
He holds it up
Opened to the signature
Where you signed this
That's right
What happened at that signing
She flattered me about my writing
Asked if she could visit me
To talk about my books
Did she
Yes
Not that much at first
But then she became more comfortable
Started visiting me every week
Will, from over by the window
Interrupts
What was the nature of your relationship
Walter looks over
Wide-eyed
What do you mean, Detective Dormer
Will turns
Accusatory
She was an attractive girl
Did you have sex with her
Walter blinks
She was only seventeen
But she was an attractive girl
suppose
Did you have sex with her
Fred shoots Will a look
Ellie, watching him
No
But you wanted to
was a mentor to her
Will heads over to Walter's chair
Fists clenched in his pockets
You gave her gifts
Yes
Expensive dresses
heart necklace
Yes
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me
gave her things she didn't have
Couldn't have
He turns to Fred and Ellie
(cont'd) Her family lives on Mr
Connell's disability
It isn't much
Fred stops Will with a look
Had enough
We understand, Mr
Byrd
(to Will) You want to sit down, Detective
Tense
Will stares at Walter
Revulsion
Heads back over to the window
She wasn't happy
was someone to talk to
How do you mean
That boyfriend
Randy
Fred, sits up
Randy Stetz
That's right
What about him
He
Well, he
Walter hesitates
Takes a sip of coffee
(cont'd) don't want to talk out of school
Kay told me things in the strictest of confidence
As a friend
Mr
Byrd
Anything you can tell us could help out with this case
Walter furrows his brow
Taps his hearing aid
Well
He hit her
Ellie's eyes widen
Fred glances at Will
But Will's too busy watching this little man weave his web
Are you sure about that
She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night
Bruises all over her back, her upper arms
pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it
Wanted to keep it a secret
Randy Stetz beat Kay Connell
(angry) Ellie
Walter looks right at her
He has a terrible rage
Kay even said he carried a handgun around with him
Fred stands
This is big
Calls out the door
Margaret
Get Judge Biggs on the phone
(to Will) 'll get another warrant for Stetz's place
Walter takes a sip of his coffee
Cup's empty
Holds it out to Ellie
Smiles
Could  have some more coffee, Detective Burr
Ellie nods, takes the cup
Heads over to the coffee machine
Fred turns back to the door
Walter levels a look right at Will
Mouths the words Wild Card
shiver down Will's spine
Wild card
The gun
Randy
over at the coffee machine
Pouring coffee
Glances up at the window
Catches the reflection of the two men
An intense look between them
-   - a
Jumping down onto a black rock
to reveal Ellie walking out on the beach
Heading down towards the water
Thinking
'  -  - dark, narrow boarding room
reaches through an open window
Feels for the lock on the door
Will enters Randy Stetz's place
Cigarette butts, electric guitar, Hustler centerfolds tacked on the walls
He looks around
Every inch of him revolting against what he's about to do
- The sound of waves
slight breeze
Ellie walking along the water
Looking down
Brow furrowed
Stops and puts her hands on her hips
'  - Will heads over to a hanging sheet on the other side of the room
Pulls it aside
being repaired
Parts and tools all over the place
Pulls the 357 Ruger from his pocket with a handkerchief
Spots a   on a shelf
Filled with thick oil
- Something catches Ellie's eye
from between the rocks
She bends down
Pulls a pencil from her backpack
Spears something and holds it up
'  - Will, drops the 357 into the oil
Turns and heads back across the room
Hesitates
At the door
Turns back
Looking at the oil can
Takes a step back towards it when he hears
The sound of a
Pulling up outside
Too late
'  - Will stands just outside the doorway into Randy's room
inside searching the place
Tearing down pictures
Turning out doors
Ripping up carpet
Randy's voice
In protest
(
) You can't fucking do this
Will hears some
The sheet being pulled down
The of tools
(
) Hey
'm working on that
Parts pulled off the shelves
The bike, shoved to the side
Then
Followed by
(
) Found something
Will shuts his eyes
Heavy  head over to the bike
Someone's pulled the gun from the can
(
) What the fuck is that
Fred's voice, calm
(
) That's it
Let's bag it
More
Randy, desperate
(
) That's not mine, man
That's not mine
Will opens his eyes
Fred's voice
Almost sympathetic
(
) Randy
(
) No way, man
More
chair knocked over
Something
Will looks down at the floor as struggle to drag Randy through the doorway
Randy writhes, kicks, tugs
Screams
(cont'd) That ain't mine
Fred grabs Randy's shoulder
'mon, Randy
Randy squirms
Turns
Looks right into Will's eyes
Gone is the bluster
Gone is the attitude
Randy Stetz, lost kid
Tears streaming down his face
swear to God
didn't kill her swear to God
- Will stands outside the garage apartment
Wind whipping his coat
Watches as a Nightmute    pulls off with Randy Stetz in the back
Fred sees him, heads over
You look like shit, cowboy
Will shifts his eyes to him
That's an understatement
Fred half-smiles
Watches the receding squad car
Looks like we can wrap this one up
Will barely nods
Fred pulls his baseball cap on
(cont'd) We're getting together for a couple of beers later on
Might not be the Seattle thing to do
But you're welcome to come
Fred puts out his hand to shake
Truce
Will looks at him
Takes it
-  - a tray of dark beer
Five glasses, foam sloshing
(
) can't believe it
Randy Stetz
to reveal Farrell, Rich, Francis, and Will sitting at a small, round table
Fred's passing out the beers
Dive bar
blaring
3 a
m
Happy Hour
banner on the wall
Place packed with rough-looking
Rich takes a glass from Fred
What do you mean, you can't believe it
He was an asshole
That doesn't mean anything
Fred sits
Takes a sip of his beer
To Farrell
Didn't you grow up with him
Farrell shifts in his seat
Our dads were on the same boat
(to Will) We used to wait for them together
Will nods
Jostled by the crowd
Reaches for his beer
He used to pick fights at the gas station
And remember when he did all those donut holes that one summer
He and Francis
Just a bad seed
Farrell looks over at Will
How do you like our beer
Will slams down his empty glass
Squeezes his eyes open and shut
Loud music
Cigarette smoke
like it fine
Fred pats Will's shoulder
What Detective Dormer needs is a little shut-eye
The white nights been hard on you
They haven't been easy
Francis grabs a handful of peanuts
They don't have titanium shades over at the Pioneer
Well no wonder
You lose all sense of time
Better than Fred's home town
Will turns to Fred
Wiping the foam from his moustache
My people are from Barrow
Way up north
In the winter there's no sunlight for five straight months
Like being swallowed up in a black hole
(
) Hi, guys
They look up
Ellie standing by their table
Jeans, down vest
Hair tousled
Nancy Drew
Pull up a seat
You hear what happened, Ellie
Yeah
Pretty cool
Rich found the gun
know
heard
Fred leans back in his seat
Eyeballs Ellie
Something's on Nancy's mind
Ellie reaches into her vest pocket
Pulls out a Ziploc with the   inside
found this out on the beach
What is it
Shell casing
9mm
Will, blanches
Let it go, Ell
We got the bad guy
None of us carries a 9mm duty weapon
And the murder weapon was a 357
Rich throws peanut shells at her
Get a hobby, will ya
Ellie brushes off the shells
Looks right at Will
It's a legitimate point, isn't it, Detective Dormer
Everyone turns to Will
Their faces, spinning
He nods
It's legitimate
Worth pursuing
He looks up
Holds her gaze
Then turns away
Grabs the side of the table
The case is closed, Ellie
(gets up) got the next round
The guys don't protest
Will starts heading for the bar
Weaving through broad shoulders, massive backs
Smoke
Laughter
Arguing
mass of bodies and sound
Like being swallowed up in a black hole
Looks back at the table
Ellie, watching him
'  - Ellie's truck pulls up in front of a small house
She jumps out
-  - Ellie heads through the front door like a gust of wind
Thunders up the stairs
Calls out
Me, Pop
We hear the  in the other room
An older , Ellie's father, appears in the doorway
Thick glasses, grey stubble, big paunch
Wearing a flannel robe
' Ellie
You okay
Ellie appears at the top of the stairs
Where's all my academy stuff
Pitch black, then,
as a bare lightbulb's switched on
Ellie stands beneath it
Piles of crap everywhere
She steps through the quagmire of old bikes, fans, auto parts
Over to a stack of cardboard  in the corner
She nudges through them, reading the writing on the tops
In thick black pen
Shoves a couple aside
Then
Finds what she's looking for
Pulls down a box marked:  Ellie Acad
Tears it open
- piles of papers, polaroids of her and her , schedules, syllabi, handbooks
Stuff from her Academy year
At the bottom, a report
The title:  "Securing the Crime Scene," the Leland Street Murders
By Eleanor
Burr
Ellie pulls it out
Sits down on an old stool
Opens to the middle of the report
Her finger, tracing down the typewritten page
Flips to the next page
Then the next
The next
Then
She spots it
-   , her finger finds the sentence:
Detective Dormer's unregistered Smith and Wesson model 39/13 9mm, to immobilize Langley
Ellie looks up
Chews her bottom lip
-   - a huge wave  against a retaining wall
Spray flying
to reveal a small monument by the sea
stone cupola with a bronze statue underneath
The sky, black with clouds
'  - Walter Byrd waits under the Mariner's Memorial
Wind whipping his jacket, the green sea churning behind him
Next to a fifteen-foot statue of a , tall, rugged, tough
Holding on to a thick coil of rope
Hunches against the wind
Watches as
approaches the monument
Sonics sweatshirt, wrinkled coat
Face drawn and haggard
Angry
(smiles) Hi, Will
Will enters the monument
What the hell are you doing calling me at the station
gust of wind  through the monument
figured we should touch base
Compare notes
think it went well
What did you think
Will's eyes pierce into him
Randy Stetz is in jail
Told you  could write an ending
Congratulations
Will holds out his hand
(cont'd) The tape
Walter looks at the open hand
Hugs his jacket to him
thought maybe we could talk some more
There's nothing more to talk about
But we work so well together
Will breaks
Rushes Walter
Slams him against one of the concrete pilasters
We do nothing well together
( him again) Nothing
You understand me
Another wave
Sprays them
Walter looks up into Will's bloodshot eyes
You run on two settings, Will
've noticed that
Will tightens his grip
(cont'd) You jump from calm to rage in the blink of an eye
That's okay
do that too
He holds up the tape
Will grabs it, shoves Walter to the side
Yanks the tape out of the cassette
Steps back and it into the sea
Waves engulf it hungrily
Walter watches him
(cont'd) You're not sleeping, are you
What the hell do you know
Kay told me
She comes to me, you know
Tells me things
About you
About me
(cont'd) Does Detective Eckhart come to you
Will curls his fists
(cont'd) Does he ask you why you shot him
Whips around
told you that was an accident
Then so was mine
Don't you pull that shit with me
didn't want to kill her, Will
Steps closer to him
Beseeching
(cont'd) When she called me that night from the party, she'd had a fight with Randy
Wanted to talk
told her to meet me at our special place
The cabin at the beach
couple  alight nearby
Flapping their wings
into the wind
(cont'd) When she came she was barefoot
And there was liquor on her breath
only wanted to comfort her
To touch her
She could have at least let me do that
Her skin
it was like everything 'd ever written about
dark shadow crosses his face
Holds on to the coiled rope of the statue
Will hisses
Couldn't get it up, Walter
It was when  went to kiss her
She started laughing
got angry
After all 'd given her
All 'd shared with her
just wanted to make her stop
That's all
Walter
Squeezing the bronze rope
(cont'd) From calm to rage in the blink of an eye
Locks eyes with Will
Conspiratorial
(cont'd) Remember
'  shoots out
Clamps around Walter's neck
Like this
Walter's face, starts turning red
Yes
Like that
This an accident, Walter
If you want it to be
Will looks deep into Walter's eyes
Squeezing harder
Pure hatred
It took ten minutes to beat Kay Connell to death
Ten minutes
Their eyes, locked
Veins, popping along Walter's temples
Lip quivering
a  sounds in the distance
Will looks up
coming back in
Will, looks back at Walter
Throws him to the ground
Sickened
(cont'd) Get the fuck out of town, Byrd
Leave and never come back
Walter
Holding his neck
Enjoying this
have a summer house up by Kgun Lake
'm going to write my next novel there
It's about a famous detective who goes bad
Will shoots him a look
(cont'd) Just kidding
He pulls himself to his feet
little unsteady
Takes out a handkerchief
Dabs his forehead
(cont'd) The never coming back part, though
'm not sure
To tell you the truth this has been kind of fun
Going to the station, meeting all those nice people
Talking with you
He shrugs
Walks past Will
(cont'd) might miss it
Will turns
Watches him walk away
Walter hesitates
Turns back
(cont'd) especially like that new detective
Will looks at him
Back straightening
(cont'd) Detective Burr
(smiles) liked her very much
Has a real vitality
Will's stomach jumps
Walter turns back
Continues on
The little man in a beige windbreaker
'  -   - a
Signing the bottom of a form
(
) was hoping not to send you back with so much paperwork, Will
to reveal Chief Nyback sitting at his desk
Will stands before him
Signing papers
bottle of bourbon on the desk
Some paper cups half filled
(cont'd) When are you taking off
Will checks his watch
Six-thirty
Fred, standing over by the filing cabinet
Toothpick in his mouth
If Spencer's not too drunk to fly
Nyback chuckles
Can't talk you into staying for a couple of days
Do some fishing
Show you what normally goes on around here
Will shakes his head
have to get back
Too bad
Looks over at Fred picking his teeth
(cont'd) Brought some real class to the place
But, Seattle needs its hero back
(stands) Couldn't have done it without you, Will
Will caps the pen
Uncomfortable
Nods towards Fred
Had a lot of help from Nightmute's finest
the door swings open
They look over as hurries in
She smiles
Looks tired
Didn't want to miss anything
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours
Good
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's
Sure
An awkward beat
Ellie walks over to Will
Looks up
Suddenly throws her arms around him
(cont'd) thought what you did on this case was amazing
Will holds his hands out
Not sure what to do
Looks down at the top of Ellie's head
' slips down his back
Feeling for a holster
For that 39/13
Nothing
She breaks away
(cont'd) We're really going to miss you around here
She and Will lock eyes
Hold for a beat
He knows exactly what she was trying to do

-  - Will, driving down Nightmute's main street
He takes a left
Goes up a hill
Glances out the window
Passing by cluster of headstones
Something catches his eye
He stops the car
-  - Will, walking up to the wrought-iron gate surrounding the cemetery
Stops
Puts his hands up to the bars
' on the other side
Newly dug
mound of dirt
Flowers, scattered by the wind
Daughter and Friend
1982-1999
Will
Grips the bars
As if he's seeing it for the first time
Really seeing it
Closes his eyes
What have  done
'  -   - Will's  in the mirror
He's showered
Hair's combed
Put on a clean suit
Steps back
Smooths down his lapels
Just right
Turns to face the room
Bed's made, mess cleaned up
He heads over to the bureau, pulls out his Smith 39/13
Lays it on the bed
Unclips his badge from his belt
Lays it on the bed
Takes something from the bedside table
The  found in Hap Eckhart
Lays it on the bed
All neat
All ordered
Reaches under the mattress
Pulls out the  of a blurry Walter Byrd standing in front of a house
radio tower in the background
The call numbers:
Will studies it
Tears it in half

pullman's kitchen, a desk, an old recliner
Pouring some milk into a bowl for a

Rachel turns, smiles
found a new friend
Will walks up to her
Puts his arms around her
Holds her, smells her, kisses her neck
Pulls away
Looks into her eyes

What is it
He doesn't answer
The cat, rubs against his leg

Looks up at the clock: 6:00
Gets up, grabs her down vest
Heads for the door
Farrell sticks the tip of his crutch in her path
She stumbles
Very funny, Farrell
- of the silver Jeep Cherokee
The only car on the road
The sky, white-grey
The trees, a blanket of green
The Cherokee heads around a hairpin curve
-   - Rachel at reception
Reading the paper
Ellie walks in
Hi, Rachel
/
-     - Will, scanning the treeline
Takes a left fork then stops
Thought he saw something
Grinds the gear, backs up
Takes another look
, a radio tower
-  '  - Rachel and Ellie, standing outside Will's room
Ellie knocks again
would have seen if he came back
'  -   - The  of a key and the door opens
Ellie strides in
Detective Dormer
She stops
Rachel behind her
Taking in the strange feeling in the room
Walks over to the bed
Eyes riveted on the 39/13
On the bullet
Rachel, behind her
What is all this
Ellie, her mind races
Notices    in the trash can
Reaches in and pulls some out
puzzle
/
- Will stops the car at the end of a narrow dirt driveway
Looming before him
right on the lake
Tall, wooden, in disrepair
Chipping yellow paint
ghost of what it once was
The house from the photograph
- The  of electric typewriter keys bang out a title: , by Walter By hunched at his typewriter
In an old study
Books stacked everywhere
Light patches on the walls where pictures used to hang
outside
Walter cocks his head
Gets up
Walks over to the window
Will walking up to the house
Lucy and Desi jumping around him
- Will opens the screen door with a
Steps into the living room
Recoils from the smell
Flies
Yellow plastic covering the sofas
Boxes, books, papers, pictures piled high everywhere
Wallpaper faded, peeling
Everything, decaying
/
'  - Ellie ripping along the forest road in her truck
Gripping the wheel
The photograph pieces, taped together on the passenger seat
- Will heads down a hallway
Dark, narrow, floorboards worn
More shit stacked up
Each step, careful, quiet
Tracking
Listening sweeps through
The burned-out lightbulb hanging from the ceiling, starts swinging
(
) Here to visit me
Will whips around
standing there
At the other end of the hallway
Shoulders slumped
Will shakes his head
No
, bouncing against the screen door
(cont'd) 'm here to end this
Walter looks around
Where's your back-up
No back-up
You're not following procedure
Procedure went out the window a long time ago
Walter looks at him
We're on the same side, Will
You know that
After what we've been through together
We're partners
Bound by a secret
Will takes a step forward
That's where you're wrong, Walter
Slowly reaches into his jacket
(cont'd) There is no secret
Because the biggest difference between you and me is what we will or will not live with
Pulls out his
Walter
Looks at the gun
Inches back
Will
, darts out of sight
Swings back into the doorway with a
Will's shoulder explodes with blood
-   - Ellie, jumping out of her truck
Hears the sound
Looks up at the big, yellow house
Pulls out her Glock 40
- Walter walking down the hall
Will, writhing on the floor, reaches for his back holster
gun's not there
Walter stands over him
Swings his leg back and
Kicks will in the ribs
The pain, blinding
Will
again,
again,
again
Walter's face
Calm, flushed
vein along his temple
Will's eyes flutter
Blood, spewing from his lips
to his kidneys
Walter stops, out of breath
Hand on hip
You give the police a bad name, Will
'  suddenly shoots out
Grabs the shotgun barrel
stumbles back
The shotgun goes off
Chunks of ceiling rain down
Walter falls to the ground
- Ellie, heart
Kicks the front door open
- Will, covered in dry wall, struggling to his feet
Reaches for his Smith and Wesson
'   kicks it out of the way
It down the hall
Walter grabs his shotgun
Scrambles to his feet
Runs down to the end of the hall
Ducks into
the library
Dirty shelves, strings of dust
Endless books
He races over to a cabinet
Yanks open a
- Will, on his feet, trying to focus
His suit, soaked with blood
Looking for his gun
Spots it, in the corner
Walter jerks open another drawer
teeter on the top of the cabinet
He finds what he needs
Grabs a handful
tumble down on top of him
He  out, covering his head
touches his ear, panics - hearing aid's gone
Looks up
Will, coming down the hall
Will hobbles into the library
Sweeps the room with this gun
No Walter
Steps on something, crushing it
Looks down
Walter's hearing aid
Kicks it aside
- Ellie
In the front hall
Following procedure
Right hand gripping the gun
Left supporting the butt
Blinks away sweat
Facing three doorways
Will limps into the dining room
Furniture stacked high
Eyes, darting
Gun, covering
Trying to stay conscious
The screen door
- Ellie
Gun swinging
Doorway one
Doorway two
Doorway three runs past number one
Big
Shadowy
The flash of a
She wheels toward it
Finger on the trigger
-
The , passing
Her heart,
Her finger
squeezing
Will Dormer or Walter Byrd
At the last second, she jerks the gun away
The figure disappears
She swallows
Gripping the gun
Follows
- The sky, heavy with clouds
The air, foreboding
Will steals out the screen door
Gun cocked
Eyes scanning
Wind, bending the weeds, the trees
a shot
Out of nowhere
Rips into his thigh
Will out
a second shot
Whizzes past him
- the shot bites into the window frame
Wings Ellie halfway across the room
She drops to the floor
Clutching her shoulder
Flesh wound
Shit
Pulls herself over to a  for cover
Shrinks behind it
Notices sticking out from one of the drawers
Nudges it open
flowered dress, some panty-hose, strands of long dark hair
- Will
On the ground
Gripping his leg
Looking wildly around
No sign of Walter
Then
He sees it
Lucy and Desi
Down by the boathouse
The boathouse
Old, rotted wood
Crumbling beams
Walter stands at a window
Re-loading his shotgun
He fumbles, drops a shell
It rolls towards a crack in the floor
Falls into the   below
Walter levels the shotgun out the window
'  - the long, undulating  outside
Will
Pulling himself through the weeds
Losing blood fast
Dragging his body
Approaches the side of the
'  , sticking out
Will ducks his head
Winces in pain
Breathing, becoming ragged
Rounds to the other side
Hoists himself up to another
Cautiously looks in
at the far window
Will jerks back
Steps on the dock
plank
Shit
Peers back through the window
Still looking out
Didn't hear a thing
Will remembers
Walter doesn't have his hearing aid
He's deaf on that side
Walter, looking out the window
- we see Will climbing in through the window
Smearing blood along the sill, favoring his leg
Stands straight
Levels his gun at Walter's back
(softly) Walter
Nothing
Walter continues staring out the window
Will raises his voice
(cont'd) Walter
Walter jumps, whips around
Comes face to face with the barrel of Will Dormer's gun
Surprised
Absently touches his deaf ear
Wild card
Drop the gun, Walter
Walter looks at Will's 45
That jammed the last time, remember
The men
Wind  through the boathouse
Killer and Detective
Only a bullet separating them
suddenly jerks up his shotgun
He stumbles back
Hit in the gut
Will's Smith and Wesson, smoking
No longer jammed
Walter, touches the blood
Looks back at Will
Staggering
The rotting floor gives way beneath him
He out, falls
Drops into the icy water below
Will steps over to the hole
Looks down at , floating on his back
Looking up at him
Water washing over his body
Eyes, pleading
Fading
wave, gently pulls him away
Another
Brody mystery
Will staggers out on to the dock
Drops his gun
Crashes to his knees
Falls back
His face, pale
Lying against the wood of the dock
Start to fall
Washing the blood from his skin
Puckering the lake water
Will's eyes
flutter
running along the dock
Heavy boots
(
) Detective Dormer
Will squints against the rain
Makes out the face of hovering over him
He gives a half-smile
God, you're a pain in the ass
Ellie kneels down next to him
Pulls over her vest
Covers him
You're shot
Will looks at her bloody shoulder
You, too
Ellie, tearing off her boot
Yanks off her sock
'm going to make a tourniquet
Will, fading fast
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell
Her things are in the house
know
Byrd's dead
Ellie, wraps the sock around his leg
Starts twisting
Will grimaces
Ellie swallows
Doesn't want to ask this
You shot Detective Eckhart, didn't you
Will nods
Yes
pained looks crosses Ellie's face
Did you mean to
Will shakes his head
No
But  covered it up
lied
Why
, drumming down around them
Will, takes a deep breath
Because  just couldn't be wrong
(looks at her) Don't ever get that way, Ellie
Don't ever lose your way
It blurs the line
His blood, pumping out in rivulets
Ellie looks down at him
Her hero
Moves up to the wound in his arm
This one looks worse
Will reaches up a feeble hand
Stops her
(whispers) Just let me sleep, Ellie
His eyelids, growing heavy
(cont'd) Let me sleep
Ellie blinks away the tears
Knows what he means
What he wants
Watches as the calm spreads over him
Will closes his eyes
No
Will opens his eyes
She ties the second sock around his arm
(cont'd) will not let you sleep
If you've lost your way then you have to make it right
That's the only way
That's what you'd tell me
've been a detective for four weeks and  say you're coming with me
She gets up
Slips her arms under his shoulders
Starts hoisting him up
(cont'd) 'mon
Will
Struggling to his knees
Every inch of him, screaming in pain
Gets to his feet
Arm slung around this tiny, young woman
What about your shoulder
Don't worry
'll have a cool scar
And they head, slowly but surely, back down the dock
