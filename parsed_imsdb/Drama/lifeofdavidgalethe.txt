"    " by Charles Randolph March 1, 1998 : -  - dishevelled  in a business suit (27) runs down a lonely highway in Texas hill country, moving desperately through the thick morning fog
She's carrying a  cassette
The sounds of her breathing and   the into the mist
She runs, and runs
She slows, out-of-strength, looks up and down the highway
Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a tunnel of fog
She stumbles on, a final effort
She runs
Sees something
Stops cold
: : " " - clock on the wall: 6:11
Beneath the clock a simple banner reads "DeathWatch Austin
" (
) It's probably been about seven minutes
The office is small, cheaply furnished
One wall is filled with neat rows of 8x10's of death row inmates
About 30 percent have red crosses over their faces
Five people wait in tense silence
with a mullet and pinch of Skoal in his mouth looks at a computer screen
co-ed cuddles a Styrofoam cup of coffee, sobs quietly
matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding a phone to one ear
The clock's minute hand changes from :11 to :12
(36), bookish, sits beside (31)
He wears a blue Yale sweatshirt
They both stare at nothing
She bites her lip
Okay
Okay
We've got pronouncement
6:12
Roughly eight minutes
(a beat as he records the time) Number 36 this year for the Great State of Texas
They all exchange looks: they've lost
David stands
David, don't start throwing things
David controls himself
'm going home
Let's do the press fax tomorrow
Another
Constance stands
Go
'll do it
He nods to her, exits
She walks to the photo wall
With a red magic marker she marks a cross over the photo of a Hispanic male
The wall clock reads 6:13
- The office is in a largely abandoned mini-mall
It's going to be a clear summer day
David hurries through the empty parking lot to Volvo station wagon
As the car exits the lot, we see the Austin skyline with the capitol building in the distance
'  - David drinks from a travel cup as he drives, windows down
- David stops at a red light beside a squad car with one cop inside
The cop gives him a cursory glance
'  - He stares at the cop
The cop looks neutrally ahead; behind him the buckle of his seat belt shoulder strap catches the reflection of the rising sun
He stares, then: Hey
The cop ignores him
Yo
Officer
The cop looks over; his face says he expects a confrontation
David points to the seat belt buckle
Your seatbelt
The cop nods, weary, embarrassed
He reaches back for the belt
David takes a sip and drives on
: : Court  reporter, Roberts, stands in front of the Supreme Court
(
) The high court also refused to stay Friday's execution of former philosophy professor, David Gale
(
) (with her mouth full) Christ doin' Karaoke
: - (47) watches with a leg up on her messy desk, eating low-fat tortilla chips and massaging a knee with an electric massager
name plate on her desk reads "Barbara
Kruger, Crime and Courts Editor
" News magazine covers are on the walls
Kruger is black, short, overweight, wears an old jogging suit and new oversized athletic shoes
She has half- frame granny glasses on a cord around her neck
(
) Gale had sought a review of his 1993 conviction for the rape and murder of University of Texas colleague, Constance Harraway
Kruger reaches for a phone, hits four numbers, takes a chip
book-jacket photo of Constance
(
) Defense lawyers had hoped to argue that Gale's former activism against capital punishment unduly prejudiced
She waits impatiently, munching, swallowing
(
) the Texas judicial system
Citing 'discriminating purpose' -- (into the phone) Hey, they're not gonna stay Gale
It's on Court  right now, listen
She holds the phone out in the direction of the , uses the opportunity to eat another chip
We see old footage of David on a  talk show
(
) clear political gain in executing its leading opponent of the death penalty
(into the phone, swallowing) So, what's it gonna be
Belyeu said to call after the decision
No, they said only Bitsey
(
) (in b
g
) Further failed to consider that the victim was herself an abolitionist activist
It means only Bitsey
Bill,  don't get to make the rules, 'm a fat black woman
Bitsey Bloom (The runner from the opening) enters
She wears, as always, a tailored suit
(into the phone) What we need is to put her on a plane to Houston
() Gale's going down
Kruger shushes her with a we-know-already gesture
(into the phone) Why do you always get lordosis around legal
She's here
She puts him on , and reaches for a chip
(to the phone) Hi
What's lordosis
(
) Female ape's posture when preparing for intercourse
Hello, Bitsey
Bitsey shoots Kruger a look, mouths "you're sick
" (
) Look, kids, setting aside the cost issue, though half-a-million dollars for three two hour interviews is not only illegal it's obscen-- Market value
Guy's never talked
(
) That aside, , we are still uncomfortable with the arrangement
Meaning
(
) Meaning you've just spent a very public seven days in jail for a very public contempt of court citation
Protecting sources, even kiddie porn scumbags, is magazine policy
(
) And , we continue to appreciate your decision
We're just concerned
rapist slash murderer, five days before he's executed, demands a reporter known for protecting sexual deviants
reporter who is also a very attractive woman -- Bitsey and Kruger moan in unison
This is disparate treatment
could go if  were an ugly blabby guy
(
) There's an agenda issue here which would be diffused with an older male
hear lawyers gleefully saying the words Bloom vs
News Magazine Inc
'Well, Your Honor,  started to notice that my assignments were evaluated on the basis of my sex
' You've gotta let her go now
(
) That's not quite what  meant
He's gotta let you go
'Certain references were made -- ' (
) (interrupting) All right
All right
Enough
The intern is with you at all times
Bitsey vehemently shakes her head "no" to this idea
Yes
, we are hanging up
'Bye
Kruger hangs up the phone before he can respond
'm not baby-sitting
Kruger reaches for a chip
- (boyish, 24) sits in the passenger seat, smoking and looking at a case file in his lap
He holds the cigarette just outside the slightly open window
Zack has a bohemian grunge thing going -- long hair, ultra-hip glasses
As Bitsey drives, she keeps looking down at the dash's instrument panel
We hear strained patience in her voice
Gale was seen leaving the house
45 - The car's lights move past a sign: "Huntsville 27 Miles
" (
) His sperm was inside her
- His prints were all over the kitchen, including one on the bag
Zack has a police photo: a woman naked on a kitchen floor, hands handcuffed behind her
Over her head is an opaque white plastic bag, sealed around the neck with duct tape
Half-a-thumb print
Okay, half-a-thumb print
Could have touched it before it was a murder weapon
Do you fondle your friends' garbage bags
Yeah,  get very touchy around household plastics
'Hello, everybody -- ooooh, Tupperware
' Chill
'm just saying the bag could have been out on the counter or something
She looks at him a beat
Hey, Zack
Yeah
He did it
But the murder's way too fucking clumsy
And this guy's a major intellectual
Top of his Yale class, a Rhodes gig, tenured at 27, two books
He's an academic stud
And, empirically speaking, a psychotic
Zack picks up another file photo: Christmas shot of the Gale family: David (31), his wife (Sharon, beautiful, 29), and son (Chase, 6)
Look at his wife, she's a regular Grace Kelly
Old money svelte
Father was Ambassador to Spain -- (looking at the car's instrument panel) Shit
The light's on again
- is on
Ignore it
It's a rental
Thanks, Zack
Do you smell anything
No
Besides the guy's a flaming liberal
Bitsey keeps looking down at the light
person's politics has nothing to do with their propensity to commit crime
(beat) Aren't we supposed to smell it if it's overheating
Wrong, seventy-three percent of all serial killers vote republican
Throw the cigarette out so we can smell
Zack reaches for the car ashtray
No
You'll stink up the car
Throw it out
'm not gonna fucking pollute
Zack
Zack pinches the cherry off, lets it drop out the window
He shows her the filter, animatedly puts in the ash tray
She gives him a look
They ride a beat in silence
Bitsey sniffs
We better pull off
Shit, this is so irritating
How far to Huntsville
Look
She points to an approaching rest area exit sign
They share a glance, then a laugh
Zack affects an evil, maniacal cackle
('Hard Copy' announcer's voice) ' Magazine reporters Bitsy Bloom and Zack Stemmons entered the rest area with car trouble
- The car exits for the rest area
(
) Little did they know their troubles were just beginning
Zack mimics the   to "Dark Shadows
" - Well lit and empty
The rental car is parked with the hood up
They stand looking at the radiator
Is it hot
He puts his hand on it
Oww
Jesus, yes
Isn't it always
Bitsey shrugs
So what do  do
don't know, something male
Zack animatedly adjusts his balls, spits
Now what
Bitsey's not paying attention
She's watching headlights coming toward them
Company
hope whoever it is never saw Deliverance
late model pickup pulls up behind them
They shade their eyes from its headlights
The lights go off
An (mid-60's, Stetson, lizard skin boots) steps out
You folks need some help
Actually yes
- The motel lies adjacent to Interstate 45 and a Kettle restaurant
The rental car pulls up to the reception building
- The rental car is parked in front
The morning is overcast, it's sprinkling
Bitsey emerges from one of the rooms on the second floor carrying an umbrella
- Bitsey enters and sees Zack in a booth, smoking and reading
The hyper-smiley   approaches her
How are you this morning
Bitsey ignores her, takes a menu without comment
She goes and sits across from Zack; he's reading Dialogical Exhaustion by David Gale
Little early, isn't it
The non-smoking section's over there
meant the book
Oh
Bitsey opens the menu; he puts the book down
What time is it
9:15
The waitress says the Ellis Unit is about fifteen minutes out of town, so we've got like five and half hours
-- Never eat where the menus have pictures of the food
was thinking we should drive to Austin, check out the crime scene
Could be some story stuff for us
(without looking up) First, this isn't a story
It's an interview
We come,  listen, you watch, we go home
Second, there is no 'us' in the assignment
Okay, what do  watch you do for the next five hours
(closing the menu) Drive around looking for decent restaurant
You know, your reputation as Siberian- Female-Dog-Person doesn't do you justice
She's unsure how to interpret his comment
He smiles
My reputation got us invited here play by the rules
It's called objectivity
They stare at each other
Zack picks up his book, starts to read, affects a shiver
- Drizzle
The prison and adjacent parking lot can be seen a few hundred yards down the road
In front of the guardhouse is a sign: " Ellis Unit
All visitors must report
" : " " The rental car  the , brakes briefly for the empty guardhouse, and moves on toward the prison
- Bitsey and Zack get out of their car
She has an umbrella
So where do we report
Three razor wire fences surround the prison
Guard towers rise at the corners
Outside the fence sits a small building with a sign: "
" Bitsey makes a there-you-have-it face
They move toward the building
Someone hawks
They look over
Within the fence, a skinny Hispanic inmate (50's) spits
He's hunched in the rain thirty yards away
He watches them neutrally
Bitsey and Zack as they walk nervously past a series of kennel-like pens that run along a long building
Inmates watch them pass:  smoking, tattooed white male (30's) stands by his door
muscular black man (30's) with a Muslim skullcap speaks quietly to the forty-something redneck beside him
paunchy Hispanic (20's) with a shaved head sits back against the building, making clicking sounds
skinny white guy with his shirt off tosses a tennis ball against the building
At the closest end of the last pen, a gang-banger (20's) watches as he stands with his fingers clutching the chain-link above his head
Rain runs down his face
As Bitsey and Zack enter, a clean-cut man in his forties is on the phone ( )
He waves them in and holds up a wait-just-a-second finger
Well,  don't rightly know one fraternity from another
But if we catch any those boys out here again, we're gonna Arrest and Prosecute
You do that, Susan
Bye now
The office has cheap wood paneling and a tired shag carpet
portrait of   (female, mid-50's) is on the wall, a large aerial photograph of the prison on the other
At a desk sits a     (40's)
Grover hangs up
(to the Woman) Thank you, Margie
(turning to Bitsey and Zack) Correspondents Bloom and Stevens presume
Yes, hello
They shake hands
Stemmons
Stemmons
Sorry, won't happen again
'm Duke Grover,
community relations
Grover's demeanor suggests a successful Little League coach, his suit suggests
Penny
He speaks quickly
() He's usually real good with names
(to Bitsey) And these days  always like to ask, now do you prefer Miss, Mrs
or Ms
Bitsey
Bitsey it is
Margie, 'm stealin' your umbrella
Okey dokey
Bitsey and Grover walk beneath their umbrellas toward the Unit gate -- Grover walks as fast as he talks
Zack follows, turns his collar up
Bitsey, you ever been in a prison
Yes
Zack smiles to himself
On death row
No
Well, we house 422 inmates here
Average stay with us is nine years
Some get commuted, move on, most get killed
It'll put you off your supper, but then it's supposed to
The unit fence gate parts as they enter
The older gate guard nods as they pass
(to the guard) Afternoon, Earl
(back to her) We've got three concerns here: safety, safety and safety
The visitation area is entirely secure -- we just ask you don't touch the glass
Windex gets expensive
They come to the door of the entrance area
Rules say seven days prior to execution inmates must be interviewed in a cage
The  , Grover opens it
- The lobby has institutional chairs and few vending machines
To one side is a guard's counter and a walk through metal detector
They enter and make their way toward the counter
This changes for no man
You're not carryin' a weapon are you
No
Mr
Stemmons, you packin'
No, sir
They arrive at the counter
Behind it are two , one male, one female
(to the guards) Clarence
Karla
New York guests for Mr
Gale
() May  see your purse, ma'am
(to Bitsey, indicating the metal detector) Go on and walk through
Grover keeps talking as he walks around the detector and waits for her
Now, should any kinda of unpleasantness occur in the visitation area, we ask that you stay put
Come on through, Mr
Stemmons
And please follow the instructions of these fine correctional officers should they see fit to give you any
(handing her the purse) Here you go, ma'am
He leads them down the hall
Anythin' you say can be overheard
And any discussion of criminal activity on your part is admissible
Not plannin' a jailbreak are you, Bitsey
- The door guard gets up from his small table and opens the door for them
Here we are
The visitation hall has the linoleum-and-fluorescent feel of an empty school cafeteria
It is seamlessly intersected by curved wall of sheer glass
Across the hall a guard's booth is built into the concrete wall; the two guards inside look like they are in a sound booth
Every fifteen feet, the glass has small sound holes
On the visitors' side, chairs (with lap desks) cluster at each section
Just getting up from a chair in the hall's center is a big man wearing an expensive suit and black cowboy boots
This is David's lawyer,   (late 30's)
On the prisoner's side of the glass, a row of ten chairs trace the outline of its curve
Above each chair a microphone hangs from the ceiling
The center chair is in a stainless steel cage
Inside sits David Gale
(calling out to Belyeu) All yours, Mr
Belyeu
(to Bitsey and Zack) You folks have safe visit now
Thank you
He exits as Bitsey and Zack make their way toward Belyeu and David; it's a walk of about twenty-five feet
Belyeu's voice is a thick combination of Cajun and Harvard Yard
Miss Bloom
Yes
Belyeu speaks as slowly as Grover did quickly
David stands up politely in his cage -- he's too tall and has to hunch
Did that
man validate your parkin'
He said the gift shop could do it
Belyeu laughs, smiles pure Old New Orleans charm
(to David) She's a smart one
Belyeu takes a few steps toward them, extends his hand
Benjamin Belyeu, Mr
Gale's attorney
This is Zack
Pleasure
(turning) And this is the man of the hour
They move toward David
-  (really loudly) interrupts: (
) Sit down, Gale
All wince
David sits, smiles, a bit embarrassed
Hello
Hello
Hi
Now, why can't they turn that thing down
(to the microphone above him) My lawyer respectfully suggests you adjust the speaker-system volume
beat
They all look over at the guard's booth
One of the guards makes a get-on-with-your-business gesture
They're practicing being cruel and unusual
Mrs
Bloom, 'm sure you're a bitin' at the bit
Belyeu collects papers from the chair he was using and starts to stuff them into his antique carpetbag
Now, it is our understanding that you are to have three two-hour sessions
Today, tomorrow and Thursday, all at three in the
'm sorry we can't afford you more time, but contrary to popular rumor we have not yet begun to fight
Furthermore, it's our understanding that you will do this with no recording equipment of any kind
(to David) You have my Gregg book
need it for Billy's appeal
(to Bitsey) My client's got a ten pound bass on the line and he's worried about baitin' his neighbor's hook
(takes out his planner) Now,  have some papers for which need your Jo Ann Hancock
(handing her a business card) Come by my Austin office at your earliest convenience
Thursday mornin', say
Bitsey's confused
Belyeu just smiles at her, then looks up at the microphone
She understands, nods
Fine, till Thursday then
Belyeu picks up his bag
He and Zack start the hike to the door
Belyeu turns, walks backwards
Good luck, Miss Bloom
(to David) 'll come by later
We can play a game of hangman, take up smokin'
David waves "get lost
" Belyeu turns
Bye, ya' all
They watch him walk away
Bitsey turns to David
He's looking at the floor, caught in a thought
So
Sorry
Have a seat
She does so
David smiles at her, he has a beautiful smile, sincere, charming, vaguely devilish
He's a character
Yeah, known Benny most my life
Met the summer after 4th grade, spent the day burning ants with his dad's magnifying glass
We called it playing 'Execution
' David looks at her a beat, lets the irony of this sit in the air
Uncomfortable, Bitsey starts to look in her purse
Since  grew up in foster homes, he's become the only family  have
Where's your ex-wife
Bitsey takes a pad out of her purse, looks for a pen
We agreed minimal contact would be easier
Please don't mention her, or my son
All right
Anything else, just clearly say, 'off the record
' 'll take it to my grave
But then you know that about me
Otherwise  wouldn't be here
David smiles, nods
(referring to the pen) Is this recording equipment
He shrugs
How should we start
'd say you're a man with a story to tell, Mr
Gale
You chose the magazine, the format
You chose me
She sits with pen on paper, poised for dictation
Go
David looks at her a long beat, then gives her the smile
: : starts   and   until the ) Belyeu gets in his Cadillac in the wet Ellis Unit parking lot
)   ( ) from the air
)    ( ) ) (over-dressed in a mini-skirt and heels) moves hurriedly through the University of Texas (
) campus
) attending class in an
lecture hall -- they are laughing as David entertains from a mike at the podium
: - Thirty animated students (circa 1992) are listening to David lecture
He's younger (31), vibrant -- looks like a grad student himself
On the white board behind him are phrases: "Lucan," "objet petit a," "Fantasy Theory
" Think
What do you fantasize about
World peace
(as no one responds) Thought so
(light laughter) Money-Fame-Ferrari
(as some guys applaud loudly; others then boo them) Pulitzer
Nobel
Music Award
(applause) genius hunk -- ostensibly bad but secretly simmering with noble passions, and willing to sleep on the wet spot
As women applaud
(yells) 'll take two
Laughter
Victoria's Secret model -- just slumming between law school and running her family's Vastly Endowed Foundation for Tragically Sad-Eyed Children
The crowd laughs, David changes tone
Okay, good, you see Lucan's point
Fantasies must be unrealistic
The minute you get something, you don't, you can't, want it anymore
To exist, desire needs absent objects
So desire supports itself with crazy fantasies
The over-dressed Sexy Grad Student enters loudly from a side door, out-of-breath and discombobulated
The crowd laughs at the timing
David pauses
Sorry
He animatedly gestures to the seats, waits a beat as she moves towards them
This is what Pascal means when he says the only time we're truly happy is when day-dreaming about future happiness
The Sexy Student sits, adjusts herself
Or why we say, 'The hunt is sweeter than the kill' or 'Be careful what you wish for
' guy behind the Sexy Student taps her on the shoulder, she turns and he hands her letter from the registrar's office
It's from a girl friend two rows back
The girlfriend mouths, "It came today
" (
) Not because you'll get it, but because you're doomed not to want it if you do
Think about it next time you're at a wedding
Laughter
The Sexy Student turns back around, throws the letter in a book
- Students pour out of the double doors leading from David's class
The hall is crowded
Standing waiting for him against the wall is Constance (glasses, granola clothes)
She's looking at a document, holds a file
- The students are leaving
David is quickly erasing the white- board
The Sexy Student approaches him (her name is Berlin)
( ) Sorry about being late
There was, you know, a thing
There usually is, Berlin
Look,  know 'm not doing well
He turns, nods, takes his books and papers from the podium
And to torture a cliche, 'd do anything to pass
He looks at her a beat, starts to walk toward the door
Anything, Professor Gale
He stops, turns
Anything, huh
(suggestively) Anything
(the smile) Anything
She affects a solicitous shyness -- then goes all sex
Any thing
He checks the room, then comes over to her, close
Tell you what, 'll give you good grade, a really good grade, if you will
(leans down to her ear, whispers sensually) study
He smiles, turns, walks away
As she watches, anger builds
- David comes out the room
Constance sees him, hurries to him
She's excited, and speaks now -- as always -- with absolute authority
They talk as they walk down the crowded hall
David
Hey
The
finished transcribing the Governor's radio and  comments
Listen: ' hate killing, that's why 'm willing to kill to stop it
' The woman breathes in soundbites
She hands him a copy
(pretends to read a quote) 'Yes, Virginia, the people of this State have overwhelmingly affirmed the reality of Santa
' You might can use some of her pre- centrist stuff
Tell me again why you aren't doing the debate
Telegenics
You have a cuter butt
hadn't noticed
know
That's not what  meant
- David and Constance exit the building into the sun
She's gonna do the whole mother thing
She empathizes with you completely, but experience has given her the courage to take the tougher road, ta- da, ta-da
Keep it rational
And flirt politely
'Governor, you bat a lovely lash for a woman who executed thirty eight last year
' They've come to a sidewalk junction, stop
And watch your ego
Don't come across as one of those -hate-authority- because-nobody-in-charge-reads-the- New Yorker types
Anything else
Yeah, don't fall into one of your brooding silences
Oh, 'm getting new federal stats from Amnesty tonight
'm going to Greer's party
Fax them to Sharon's number at the house
She looks at him sternly over the top of her glasses
If you have a hang-over tomorrow -- (hangs up, walking away) Apropos playing Mother
(calling after him) Ten o'clock
(beat) Bright-eyed and bushy tailed
-  - The house is an immaculately restored two-story Victorian, far better than what a university professor can afford
The grounds are perfect
David's Volvo is in the driveway, his wife's new Laredo beside it
On the street out front sits a new  Beetle
'  - David's son --  -- sits in bed holding a stuffed sheep in the air
David turns off the light in the adjacent bathroom, comes in holding his son's jeans and shoes
David wears a t-shirt which says "Evil-Doer & Curious Person
" The room is over-decorated with boy stuff
Did you mark your calendar
(looking up at it) Yep
- ' hangs above the bed, opened to the month of March
It has a felt-tipped pen hanging from a piece of string taped to it
Ten frowny faces cover ten consecutive days, then there are three empty days before a large smiley face awaits on the fourth
The frowny faces are in a kid's hand, the smiley face in an adult's
(counting on his fingers) Only
three more Spain days
David puts the jeans and shoes away
Only three
That's great, huh
David comes and sits beside his son
Points to an African statue (a man holding a spear) on the bedside table
What's he doing in here
Mommy said  could
Just till she gets back
(touching the spear) That's a special-duper monster laser knife
Where's your laser gun
Chase reaches under the sheets, searches, finally pulls out a laser pointer
Here
He "shoots" some toys in the corner with the red laser dot
Tussshh, tusssshh, tussshh
never shoot them in the eyes, Daddy
That's 'cause you're a special-duper- super-quadruper boy
Who's now going to sleep
He tucks his son in
Who loves you
Chase giggles, points at his dad, then pokes his nose
Ooooh
(kissing him) Good night, son
(holding up his stuffed sheep) Do Cloud Dog
(kissing the sheep) Good night, Cloud Dog
- Obsessively cool, full of designer furniture and rough fabrics
The art is mostly contemporary and conspicuously lit -- a Damien Hirst piece sits in one corner
few African antiquities are scattered throughout
sits on the couch reading a school textbook, holding lip gloss and absentmindedly applying it as she reads
David passes on his way to the door
Back before midnight
It's cool, Mr
Gale
(calling after him) Don't do anything  wouldn't
(
) Rest assured
He exits
When she hears the  , the Babysitter reaches for the  remote
-   - The duplex is upscale, two-story with a vaulted ceiling
Scattered about are forty party-goers, mostly grad students
Some spill out onto the back patio and around the pool
Everyone has a t-shirt with a philosophic idea ("Yawnic," "Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know," "[Philosophic t-shirt]"
) (late 20s, Persian, "Host" t-shirt) escorts David into the living room
The guy's the Immanuel Kant of the Consistent, accurate, effective, and boring, boring, boring
Greer leaves him at the sofa where an   (60s, homemade t-shirt -- "Pre-Socratic" -- over his shirt and tie) stands speaking with  (late 40s, "Homosexualist" t- shirt)
Meinen Herren
(has an Oxford accent) Hello, David
Professor Gale
Where's your better half
Spain
Again
(a beat) Well,  was just off for air
He moves to the patio
They watch him go
(under his breath) Looks like Sharon's affair is an open secret
(under his breath) Hermeneutical bias: the only fun truths are the ones someone's trying to hide
(normal tone) Have a seat
They sit on the sofa
Listen, Berlin's here -- and livid
Probations suspended her
She received the letter today, took the opportunity to throw a fit in my office
You should -- (
) Talking about me
She's standing behind them
David tilts his head back
Yep
She's tipsy, brings her face down between their heads
(to David) He tell you  said when you were circumcised they threw away the wrong part
He mentioned it
An uncomfortable beat
She reaches over and takes Ross's drink from his hand, drinks the rest, puts it back
It's called schmuck
What
The part of the foreskin that gets thrown away
think it's called schmuck
Aren't we so fucking clever
(standing, escaping) suppose  should get us another
David
Black Bush
Ross walks to the bar
Berlin comes around and sits in his seat
Her mid-drift -shirt reads "Sex is Power
" You were a jerk this afternoon
beat
She's turned facing him, he looks forward
For what it's worth,  didn't know about the suspension
Is that supposed to be an apology
More like a conciliation
Ross has two gin-and-tonics and is finishing pouring David's Black Bush
He moves away
The table is neatly laid with snacks and bottles
The flower arrangement is perfect
- The table is now in mid-party chaos
Food spilled, bottles empty, the flowers in disarray
"'  " in the background
Berlin takes a bottle of Red Label from the table
her  the living room, where a few people now dance, and out onto the patio
crowd well on their way to being drunk gathers by the pool
They surround two patio chairs which face each other, one with David, the other with Ross
The men are playing an Irish drinking game -- the crowd has chosen favorites
(slurring a bit) All right
(clears his throat) As the poets have mournfully sung, Death takes the innocent young, The screamingly funny, The rolling in money, And those who are very well hung
Laughter, a few animated moans
David raises his glass to Ross and downs a whiskey
Someone starts to chant: "Gale

" (feeling good but very much in control) There once was a lesbian from Canjuom, Who took a young man to her room, And they argued all night, As to who had the right, To do what, how, and to whom
Laughter
Two women holding each other boo
Ross drinks
One more
'mon, one more
Enough
That's enough
The crowd wants more
Someone makes chicken sounds
Do you bow to the Queen
David looks at him, contemplates, then smiles
He holds his glass out for a refill
The crowd applauds
The crowd is chanting: "Ross
Ross
Ross
" - The crowd has dispersed
couple of small groups converse
Someone is being thrown into the pool
Inside the duplex a few dancers are still going at it
David is washing his face
As he dries, the downstairs gets
He looks from beneath the towel into the mirror
Berlin has entered the bathroom
'm done
She locks the door, leans back against it
She's flushed
He folds the towel
'm not a student anymore
Don't think  want to know what that means
David lays the towel down, leans back against the sink -- they face each other on opposite sides of the bathroom
There once was woman named Berlin, Who liked a bit now and again
Not now and again, But Now
And Again
And Again
And Again
And Again
He laughs
Cute, huh
Cute
have a secret
But  have to come over there to tell you
He makes an 'm-not-so-sure face
She moves playfully toward him
Here  come
She comes up to him, leans into him as she puts her mouthclose to his ear
He keeps his hands back on the sink counter
(whispering) wasn't after the grade
She stands with her body against him, looks into his eyes
Berlin, this, this is not
She puts her fingers over his mouth, keeps them there
Ssshhhh
With her free hand she takes one of his, rubs it against her face and lips as she speaks
We'll just talk, analyze, contemplate
Or
you can put your mouth on my body
She moves his hand down, brushing it against her breast and to her groin
She brings her mouth toward her fingers -- which are still against his lips
(softly, vulnerably) Don't reject me
Please
With her eyes open, she kisses the back of her own fingers, runs her tongue between them, opens them to reach his mouth
Hispanic woman (-shirt: "DerriDa-Da") bee-bops to the bathroom door
Tries the handle, then dances away
About eight dancers dance to the   -- its pace increasing
couple them are really into it
Berlin and David are against the sink, kissing in full passion
The  from downstairs seems
Her  shirt is off
Panting, he turns her against the sink
Pulls her skirt up, reaches for her panties
Rip them
What
Rip them off
He does so
Ross sits at the kitchen table, holding his throbbing head against the
Greer sets a cup of coffee in front of him, sits across
long beat
They seem like parents waiting out a teenager's party
Berlin is back against the sink, undoing David's fly as he takes his -shirt off
The  from downstairs seems even His pants and underwear fall
He starts to penetrate her
No
From behind
She turns, faces the mirror
He positions himself behind, enters her
Yes
He moves against her
Do it hard
He looks at her in the mirror, then continues
She watches him
guy sits alone at the far end of the pool on a lounger
The dancers can be seen in the living room behind him
David thrusts against Berlin, her thighs pound against the edge of the sink
The  is as  as it is downstairs
Harder
He looks at her in the mirror, unsure
Harder
He thrusts harder
Yes
They continue in rhythm
She reaches back and pulls him into her
Bite me
Bite my shoulder
She watches him do so in the mirror
The dancers dance -- the   has  even more
One dancer is a blur
Berlin is pulling David into her
They approach a climax
She scratches him on the small of the back
Blood trickles
The  and dancers are in pure
Suddenly, the Greer stands by the , his hand coming back from the power button
He gestures "that's-all-folks
" David and Berlin stand still and apart, breathing heavily into the reality-inducing silence
He looks at her in the mirror, a look of shame
She gives him an odd smile
: : '  - Constance wakes with a jolt, sweating
She gets up and goes into her bathroom
- She turns on the light, moves to the sink, opens the medicine cabinet
It's stacked with prescription medicines
Suddenly, she turns to the toilette, vomits
: : &    - David and Constance sit by a window, the
campus in the b
g
David's distracted, wearing a suit and a long face
She's wearing the closest thing she has to business attire
She has stacks of paper spread in front of her
Okay, let's say we find an innocent on death row
Wouldn't matter
Corrections would let him go
Governor Harding would go on , say, 'Thanks to the good people at DeathWatch, the system works
' Yeah, if they executed an innocent, and we had absolute, undeniable, in-your-face proof, we could demand abolition
Just like happened in England
Are you okay
(coming out of it) Sorry
Yeah
He makes an effort, plays the "good listener
" But it hasn't happened, not since '76
And won't happen
David nods
Dead men can't make a case
And 'Almost Martyrs' don't count
Just keep it rational
The death penalty is expensive and ineffective
No one wants to see a murderer as a victim
Um-hum
And stop that
What
Active listening
hate active listeners
Makes me feel like 'm with a Dale Carnegie grad who cares more about appearing to listen than actually listening
Did you bring the Amnesty fax
can listen and appear to listen at the same time
Yeah, no
Damn, left it home
have a copy
She looks through her papers, finds the copy in the stack beneath her coffee cup
She starts to hand it to him
He is looking out the window, caught in a thought
You want to tell me what's up
Nothing
Everything
Something profoundly stupid happened last night
(teasing) hope you used a condom
beat
His reaction tells her the jest hit home
Jesus Christ, David
Was she one of yours
longer beat
He holds her eyes
It was Berlin
She's stunned, then genuinely angry
Oh, that's great, great
can hear the grapevine now
They suspended her so Gale could dick her with a clear conscience
He looks at his coffee, which he hasn't touched
power differential equals coercion
Great
You are so weak
Constance, you're not my wife
Thank God
know you can tell yourself it's a position  aspire to, but believe me,  would rather
She trails off
They stare at each other a beat
Then, she starts to collect the papers
didn't mean -- Let's go
As she collects, she winces, grabs her side
Are you okay
Yes, let's just go
-   - Two people sit in front of monitors displaying various angles on sound stage
The main monitor is playing the end of the show's signation
In three, two
camera operator cues the host (50s, male, bow tie)
The host is flanked by David and Governor Hardin
The set has an upscale regional television look
The Governor has the rare ability to look comfortable while David fidgets
(to camera) Welcome back to 'Batter's Box
' Tonight we continue our very special four-part series with the Governor Hardin
Arguing capital punishment with her is DeathWatch coordinator, Professor David Gale
Governor, you're up
Alan, let me say somethin'  always say
Constance stands behind the cameras
She motions to David -- something about the papers in front of him
And 'm gonna keep on sayin
' And that is  hate killin
' That's why my administration is willing to kill to stop it
So you don't subscribe to the idea that 'a good state is one that protects its most despised members'
It's a nice liberal idea, but like most nice liberal ideas, naive
It's a quote from you, Governor, from your first state attorney campaign
Constance is biting her lip, breaks into a smile
The Governor is unsure how to react, then laughs
The host chuckles with her
You've got me, Professor
But let me, in my defense, give you a quote
Winston Churchill: 'If you're not a liberal at twenty, you've got no heart, if you're still a liberal at thirty, you've got no brain
' The host's laughter is overdone
David smiles
Constance bites her lip
So, basically you feel, to choose another quote, 'society must be cleansed of elements which represent its own death
' The Governor makes an animated thinking face
Well, yes
would have to agree
(chuckles again) Did  say that, too
No, ma'am
That was Hitler
Constance makes a "Yes
" gesture with her hands
The Governor is surprised into silence
The host laughs and, noting her reaction, trails off
David becomes more confident, his tone more sincere
Governor, can't we examine the possibility that capital punishment isn't working
That murderers aren't deterred by the law because they have about as much forethought as lemmings
That it's expensive, inequably administered, that
David cuts his eyes briefly to Constance
that we may even be killing innocents
Constance rolls her eyes
The Governor is ready for this
All righty, Mr
Gale, 'll play your game
Name one
Name one innocent man Texas has put to death in my tenure
One
beat
David doesn't respond
Name one in the last twenty years
In any state in this country
long, miserable beat
Well, Mr
Gale
Dead men can't make a case
Well, as my daddy used to say: If you can't find a problem, there probably isn't one
Constance shakes her head in irritation
- The show is over
David and the Governor are shaking hands
Constance stands nearby
Well, you certainly had me on that Hitler quote
Thank you, Governor
These debates are awfully good for the state, don't you think
Of course
Well, 've got to buzz
She moves toward her handlers
You folks keep up the good work
We need that opposition
Constance's and David's polite smiles follow her
- Constance and David argue as they walk the sidewalk to the parking lot
Your exact words were, 'Just tell me when my ego gets in the way of the work
' Now 'm telling you: Your ego's in the way of work
(indicating the station) Look,  wanted you to do this anyway
You put up precisely two seconds of protest at the thought of a televised debate
What's that supposed to mean
It means DeathWatch suffers because you're so anxious to finger authority, to publicly prove that David Gale is so much fucking smarter than the powers that be
Learn to work without an audience
Try squeezing money from the donor list
Have you ever licked one single mail-out envelope
They come to the end of the sidewalk, where two  are standing -- one Hispanic, one white (30s)
#2 () Mr
Gale
Look, guys, there's not much more to say -- #2 Rameriz, Austin police
This is Officer Haslinger
The officers show their Ids
Constance takes one to examine it more closely
What, arguing with the Governor is a crime
The officers exchange a look
#3 () No, sir, rape is
Constance and David look at each other, stunned
and
: : -   - and ,    Bitsey as she listens to David
(
) (over the loudspeaker) Gale, time's up
The speaker, loud as ever, startles Bitsey
David nods over to the guard's booth
Berlin had my bite marks, bruises, ripped clothing
My skin was beneath her nails
It didn't look like anything but rape
Two days later she called the
, said she wouldn't testify, too drunk to be sure, etc
On the plane home, Sharon read about her husband's rape case being dropped
Why'd she do it
guard approaches
David stands up and moves to the back of his cage, puts his hands behind him and out the slot in the back to be handcuffed
(shrugs) Finger authority, show she was smarter than the powers that be
Do you know where  can find her
First year in here  received a card postmarked San Francisco
It wasn't signed, but  suspect it was from her -- the front had the text 'Sex is Power
' Cuffed, David stands aside for the cage door to be opened
Anything written on it
Yeah
It said, ''m sorrier than you can know
' (exiting the cage) See you tomorrow, Ms
Bloom
- Bitsey and Zack are walking from the Kettle to their rooms
Zack is lighting a cigarette
The rain's stopped, but the lot is wet
Try phone records, a net search
Fucking better than watching you work
They walk a beat in silence
You think he's telling the truth
Don't ask me that
don't know
There is no truth, only perspectives
Can't say that
If you say 'there is no truth,' you're claiming it's true that there is no truth -- it's a logical contradiction
Working on our philosophy merit badge, Zack
, on the other hand, think Gale's telling the truth
They come to the stairs and start up
This you know telepathically
It's just my perspective
In a dark corner of the parking lot sits the pickup from the rest area
The older cowboy watches Bitsey and Zack climb the stairs
On his ,  plays
Once they are in their rooms, he   the opera, closes his eyes, feels the music
- The car moves through an older Austin suburb with wood framed houses (circa 1950) in varying states of repair
It's an overcast day
Zack drives, slowly, searching
Bitsey has the passenger seat fully reclined, lies with her eyes closed
:
Thirty-three o what
Seven
(then) 'Check out the crime scene in Austin
' You made it sound so close
Shit, two and half hours and that damn lig -- Bitsey
She looks up
Zack is pointing at house 3307, which needs paint and a lawn mower
In front of the house is a homemade sign which reads, "David Gale Death House and Museum" See where it happened
" Beneath are the opening hours (12-8); someone has marked them out and scribbled "ring bell
" They share a look
3307 - Bitsey rings the bell
Zack stomps out a cigarette, points out a worn "Block Home" sign in the window, raises his eyebrows
As Bitsey straightens her skirt, the door is opened by a  , probably not quite eighteen
She has jet-black hair, nose piercings, tattoos, a Nine Inch Nails -shirt
comes from within
The Goth Girl just looks at them
After an uncomfortable silence, Bitsey extends her hand
Hi
'm Bitsey Bloom and this is Zack Stemmons
We -- You want the tour
Her voice is slacker monotone
Uh, yes
There's a twenty-dollar mandatory donation, apiece
But you get a re- enactment photo packet
It's got five pictures
Okay
beat
gotta collect first
Oh, sure
Bitsey reaches in her bag
- They enter
The room is dark, messy, with an old couch and /
kitchen is adjacent
The walls are full of Goth bric-a-brac: London Batcave poster, one from Burton's Frankenweenie, a couple of fan-zine pictures of Siouxsie and the Banshees
In one corner is a very expensive , from which   plays
In another, a dead plant
The Goth Girl turns the
table near the door has numbered photos beneath a torn and curling sheet of plastic
Small packets of snapshots sit on the table along with a few hand-labelled videos and a book of clippings
There's also a guest book
You gotta sign the book
Doesn't have to be your real name, though
Bitsey signs in
First page says you're here to do research on violent crime
The state requires it for nonprofit shit
Zack signs in
Take a re-enactment photo packet
Bitsey does so
As does Zack
If you guys could share one, it would be really cool
The butt wipes where do prints kinda jerk my chain
Zack puts his back
Bitsey is looking at a photo: the Goth Girl in her panties and bra laying on the floor with plastic wrap over her head
She's handcuffed and wearing a platinum blonde wig
The pose is half-corpse, half-pinup
That's me
My boyfriend took it
We also did a video
It's fifty bucks 'cause you can see my tits
There's a version without tits, that's thirty- five
Zack looks at a video, hand-labelled: "Constance Harraway Murder (with breasts)
Copyright 1997
Svengali Productions
" Do many people take the tour
Not so much anymore
We thought this would be like a busy week -- Gale gettin' the prune juice and all
Prune juice is what death row dudes call the poison, 'cause it gives you the shits
Most jerks just take a photo from the street
They shot a 'Real Crimes' episode here, but the owner didn't give us dick
You don't mind living here
'm cool with ghouls
Beats livin' with my dickwad parents
It starts over here
She takes them to the coffee table
Among her own things, a dusty Johnny Walker Black Label bottle sits beside a tumbler (an index card with the #1 leans against it)
The area has been outlined on the table with white shoe polish
She let him crash here sometimes
He was like constantly wasted
Drank Black Label religiously
Bitsey and Zack exchange a look
The Goth Girl moves into the kitchen
It's cluttered and dirty except in the various areas which at one point had been outlined and indexed -- the cards are all dirty
sliding glass door leads onto the patio
The backyard hasn't been mowed in years; roughly twenty pots with dead plants lying around
By the door, three small taped Xs are on the floor, outlined and indexed (#2)
This is where the tripod was
My boyfriend borrowed the one we usually show folks
They never found a camera, photos, or videos or anything
Gale must have buried them
These serial killer dudes take photos to whack off to later
He's not exactly a serial killer
Whatever
She moves to the sink
On the linoleum, the position of Constance's body has been chalk-lined (#3)
In this area are a pair of handcuffs (#4)
Not far off is a roll of packing tape (#5)
pair of latex kitchen gloves are crumpled on the sink counter (#6)
She was like totally naked right here
The meter man saw her through the door
Gale handcuffed her, taped her mouth, then taped a bag over her head so she couldn't breathe
My boyfriend says that's probably when he fucked her
Your muscles tense up when you die -- the sex is better
(pointing) He used those housewife gloves so he wouldn't leave prints
They found sticky stuff from the tape on them
Zack picks up the gloves
We ask folks not to touch the exhibit
Right
He puts them back
The totally sick part was where they found the key -- We know, you can save that
What
Where was it
It was in her stomach, dude
He made her swallow it before he bagged her
beat
Zack's shocked
That's pretty much the highlight
Got questions
- Bitsey drives
They are on the two-lane highway to Huntsville
Zack smokes out the window
It was in the case file
Fuck, in her stomach
That's colder than Wisconsin
(looking in the rearview mirror) Zack, open your vanity
What
The vanity mirror, pull it down
He does so
See that truck behind us
Yeah
Isn't that the cowboy from the rest area
They look in their respective mirrors
Some distance behind them is the older cowboy in his pickup
Same truck
Weird coincidence, huh
(turning) Coincidences are always weird, that's why they're coincidences
- Bitsey sits in front of David
He's less animated than the day before, drained
He rubs his wrists
They are speaking in hushed tones
beat
Off-the-record
Alright, we're off
Constance was murdered with what's called the Securitat Method
You're hand-cuffed, forced to swallow the key, taped at the mouth, a bag's sealed over your head and you're left to suffocate
The Securitat did this to Romanians who wouldn't inform or confess
Sometimes the bag was ripped off at the last second, you got a second chance
If not, you die knowing the 'key' to your freedom was inside you the whole time cheap-but-effective metonym
Problem is  mentioned the method in an early article
The prosecution never knew
You're telling me someone's framing you
It's more than that
There was a tripod
Right, facing her body
Are we on
(nods agreement) Not a single print was found on it
Someone brought it, wiped it, left it
Why
It's as if they wanted me to know that somewhere there's a record of what really happened that afternoon
As if they wanted me to die knowing the key to my freedom was
out there
Maybe you're being paranoid
Ms
Bloom
'm an anti-death row activist on death row
Doesn't that strike you as odd
beat
She nods
Any ideas who 'they' are
No
beat
But  have someone on it, someone 'm hoping will one day find an answer
Belyeu's hired a detective
He shakes his head
journalist
It takes Bitsey a second to understand
David smiles
(mimicking Belyeu) 'She's a smart one
' : : -   - David and Constance stand by the double doors
He's concentrated; she's biting her lip
They're looking onto a large parking lot
The lot is practically empty except for Sharon and Chase, who stand near their Jeep
It's packed with various household items, things not entrusted to movers
'll drop by your office after
He nods and goes out
- As David approaches them, Chase runs to them -- still carrying Cloud Dog
He jumps on his dad
Wear me like a fur, Daddy
Wear me like a fur
As he walks, David drapes the boy sideways over his shoulders (like a fur)
Chase squeals with pleasure
Who's your hero
Chase bonks him on the nose
David sets Chase down when he reaches his
He kiss him goodbye as the boy struggles to move on to something else
long beat as David and his wife stand uncomfortably
Call me when you get to Boston
() Yeah
beat
wish you -- Don't
She turns and walks to the Jeep
The door's open
Chase, get in, Sweetie
Chase climbs in, sits in the driver's seat
(turning to his dad) See ya later, Alli-gator
After awhile, Crocodile
Take it easy, Japa-ne-se
Okey-dokey, Artichokey
(to Chase) Scoot
Chase scoots over to the passenger seat
Sharon gets in the driver's seat
sent you an e-mail
Okay
Just read it
She closes the door
Suddenly, Chase opens the passenger side door, runs around the Jeep carrying Cloud Dog
He runs to his dad, hugs him one last time
(cracking her window) Come on, Chase
Chase starts to go back, turns and hands David his Cloud Dog without comment
He then quickly runs back around the Jeep and gets in
David watches them drive away
Chase's hand waves out the window until they are out of the parking lot
- with an e-mail message: "David,  want a divorce
'm sorry to say it so plainly, but that's how  feel it
don't need time to think, this whole 'rape' thing has only forced
" '
- David sits in front of his computer, staring into space
The office is institutional, cramped
Books line the walls, fill the desk
There's a framed poster (Warhol-style) of Socrates
He reaches into his desk for a bottle of Black Bush and fills his glass
There's a  on the door
Constance enters
You could at least hide the bottle
David closes the e-mail
She collapses in the chair opposite his desk, exhausted
Well
Officially, you're on sabbatical
Unofficially, they want you to look for another position
It was four to two
beat as he absorbs the information
How did Ross vote
You're not supp
Against you
David nods
And you
Against my politics
David mouths a "thank you
" - Century 21 real estate agent is putting a "For Sale" sign in the front yard
- David is having lunch with an  -  in his fifties
Only water and bread are on the table
So,  wanted to get your feedback on the idea
The Ivy Leaguer vigorously butters his bread
Look, Professor Gale,  could sit here, as 'm sure others have, and plead departmental cutbacks
Claim you need more publications, or need a minority, whatever
All bull- geschichte
Your record's brilliant
You're an original voice worth -- in the scarcity-defines-value capitalist system under which we toil -- your weight in gold
Hell, it's not even the alcohol
It'd be nice to have faculty whose crutch wasn't Prozac
But, to speak plainly, if  hire you, in the eyes of the regents, alumni and every freshman with an ear for gossip, 'd be hiring a rapist
He takes a bite of bread
You're not politically correct, Dr
Gale
Welcome to the club
/
'  - David stands on the balcony of a sparsely-furnished 420-a- month apartment
Books are stacked everywhere
An Interstate runs nearby
He holds a phone, looks down in the pool area
' horribly-tanned man in his seventies (wearing a Speedo) attempts to do Tai Chi
(
) (on his mom's answering machine) We aren't home
Please, tell us a message
(
) (cueing him in the b
g
) At the beep
(
) At the peep
David lets the  , just stares down at the man, saying nothing
- As David gets out of his Volvo, a   (funny clothes, Greek letters on her cheek) quickly approaches
She takes his picture with a Polaroid camera
She runs to a waiting convertible, where two other girls sit
got it
got it
She jumps in the car and they speed away
-  - The office is Philip Stark chic with large window walls -- Austin stretches into the distance
David sits on a sofa across from an exceedingly   (early 40s)
What exactly attracts you to the bond market
He's staring into space
Mr
Gale
He looks at her
She forces a strained smile
'  - Dark
David lies on the floor, his head propped against a wall
He's in his underwear and drinking from a Black Bush bottle
The phone's beside his ear and Chase's  on his wife's   out of the receiver speaker
After the , David hangs up, gets a  , and punches re- dial
The   again
After the , he hangs up, gets a  , and punches re-dial
- David is in the office of an overdressed (early 20s)
David is doing his active listening thing
(over-articulating) Now, Mr
Gale,  want you to tell me three personal qualities you have that would make you a successful Radio Shack manager
- David and Belyeu approach a ball fifty feet from the green
Because divorce proceedings do not require her presence in the country
For a custody hearin', yeah, she'll have to return
David chooses a club
But without successful completion of an alcohol treatment program, you'll be lucky to get the odd Thanksgivin'
David walks to the ball
So my chances of getting partial custody aren't good
Roughly the same as you sinkin' that from here
David looks at him, then concentrates on the ball -- suddenly it has meaning
He swings
The ball lands in a water trap
- David's Volvo winds up the road, enters through a gate sign beside the gate: "The Go lightly:  Recovery Clinic
" : : '  (3307) - It's a beautiful day
The house looks much different than in the Goth Girl's care -- flower bed, well-manicured lawn, fresh paint
The "Block Home" sign is in the window
David's Volvo pulls up in front
/
'   - Constance opens the door for David
He's wearing a short sleeved Radio Shack shirt and tie
She's taken aback
Looks at him a beat, bites her lip, suppresses a laugh
'm sorry
He plays hurt, then they both burst out laughing
- She hugs him as they laugh on the porch
'   - The living room is now Laura Ashley cozy
The sliding door is open so the room's sunny, breezy
Constance leads David in
She looks tired but is animated, a bit too much so
Her hair is different
You look good
feel
washed
She smiles at him maternally, touches his face
They hug again
(lightly, in his arms) need you
DeathWatch needs you, now more than ever
Nothing like  need you, both
You're all  have
Look
She moves from him, takes a photo from a case file on her kitchen table
Jo Ann Johnson's been re-scheduled
- of a young black women -- pleasant, timid
've got a call with Hawkins tonight, and if national will commit emergency funds
She lifts a small plant, moves to the porch
Jo Ann will be commuted and you'll only prove the system works
He notices she has bruises on her arms
But 'll save a life
(referring to the bruises) Where'd you get those
Spring cleaning
' She went up at 18, she's 26 now
She sets the plant down among others
At the very back of the yard, the Older Cowboy spades in a vegetable garden
(calling to the Cowboy) Hey
She ever not make you work when you come by
(raising his spade in greeting) Mornin', David
(turning to Constance) What's her story
really want us to get behind this one
She's articul -- Constance, who did she kill
Constance looks at him a beat, sighs
cop
She admit to it
Contance sheepishly nods
You're a crazy woman
Not your medium grade thinks-she's-Teddy Roosevelt's- bathrobe, but stark-raving-loose- screws-in-the-belfry insane
You're mixing metaphors
real danger to flora and fauna
Are we gonna do this
(the smile) And how
He kisses her on the forehead -- he's surprised
You're burning up
- David exits the store carrying four large coffees in a cup- container, tries to sip one without spilling the others
He's still wearing the Radio Shack shirt, seems happier
In the parking lot, a hip high schooler jumps out of his Camero and moves toward the store
As David comes in front of the car, he sees his former baby-sitter sitting in the passenger seat
Their eyes meet
He smiles
She smiles back, waves
As he passes, he hears the girl hit the car's automatic -
() - David enters carrying the coffee
The matron sits on a desk licking envelopes
The college guy is on the floor beneath a desk rewiring a computer terminal
(calling from beneath a desk) Howdy, Mr
Gale
Hello, folks
David goes to the Matron, gives her cup and three Sweet & Lows
Hello
My, this is service
Thank you
Gladly
He takes one of the unsealed envelopes from her stack, then puts a cup beside the legs of the College Guy
Latte on your left, partner
David makes his way to the back office
The College Guy gives the Matron a look -- they're surprised, pleased
- Constance sits at a spartan desk
Nothing is on the walls, though a window opens onto the alley behind
She's talking on the   with the DeathWatch national director -- a social gathering is going on behind him
(
) and see what kind of resources the religious groups can deliver
David comes through the door
She waves him in
'm sure we can get some pulpit time, maybe cable
He sets her coffee in front of her
Then sits across from her
(
) Cable's good
Listen,  need to run
For now,  agree the first press release should focus on the woman's youth
David holds up the envelope for Constance to see, then animatedly licks and seals it
He then, literally, pats himself on the back
(
) 'll have the Washington people look into counsel competency, though 'm almost sure she's exhausted this issue on appeal
She smiles at him, shakes her head
(to the phone) John, David's going to -- (
) Oh,  almost forgot
He's not around, is he
Constance hesitates, looks at David
He shakes his head no
No
(
) Good, keep it that way
His relationship to DeathWatch is over, terminated
Last thing we need is this rape thing coming back to bite our butts
Constance is not sure how to react
David just stares at her
(
) These guys don't stay on the wagon for very long
David stands up and leaves the room, quickly
His coffee spills
Constance can only watch
(
) 'm serious, Constance
Ban him from the premises
realize you two
() - Constance comes anxiously out the front door
' David's Volvo pulls out of the parking lot
She stands watching it drive away, breathing heavily
She winces, grabs her stomach, vomits on the sidewalk
- The Volvo is parked on a seedy Southside street
David stands at a phone booth and dials a long-distance number and a calling code
He waits, impatiently, looks across the street: There's a liquor store
- at his ear, Chase's
He speaks into the  after the
Sharon, pick up
For once just pick up the goddamn phone
If you keep him in Spain, 'll
'm begging you
He's my son
Please
Please
Please
David starts to put the receiver back, then suddenly starts smashing it against the phone's body; he smashes it long after there is anything left to destroy, long after his hand bleeds
'  (3307) - Constance walks with car keys and a large stack of mail toward her front porch
She looks like she hasn't slept in weeks
David is sitting on the porch beneath the Block Home sign, holding Cloud Dog
He wears the Yale sweatshirt, the Radio Shack shirt is wrapped around his injured hand
He's sloppy drunk
We're seeking refuse, refuge, uge
Come on, come inside
She opens the door as he stands
We fell off our wagon
'   - David enters rambling, stands leaning against the back of the couch, holding the sheep
Know why Saint Jude is the patron saint of lost causes
'Cause his real name was Judas
There were two Judases, Judai, the saint guy and the bad Judas who ratted on Jesus, and tried to kiss him
Medievalers wouldn't pray to good Judas for fear of getting bad Judas on the line by mistake
Ergo, they only gave him business when really desperate
That's why
Then they changed his name
She's not in the room
Constance
He looks back toward the entry hall
small flyer lightly blows along the floor into the living room
Your mail's blowing
He looks in the entry hall
Constance lies unconscious on the floor near the open door
The mail is scattered about her
- David sleeps in a chair, on the floor beside him is a stack of vending-machine coffee cups
typical hospital can be heard throughout the scene
female  (mid-30s) sits beside him, lightly shakes his shoulder
He wakes, groggy
How we doing
Fine
How's Constance
Sleeping
beat as he collects himself, sits up
Mr
Gale, a leukemia patient's condition is highly susceptible to external stress
While we don't want to totally restrict Constance's life -- What
Constance's illness requires a degree of regularity
Constance has leukemia
Acute
She was diagnosed last fall
beat as the situation clarifies for both of them
David is stunned, the doctor embarrassed
Have  created a problem
No, no
They sit in silence
The hospital intercom seems to say: (
) Gale, time's up
- : : -  -  - Bitsey stares at David, engrossed
When  asked why she hadn't told me, she muttered, 'too busy
'  guess she figured as long as death was chasing her, she could help others escape
He stands, goes to the back of the cage to be handcuffed
Constance left the world better than she found it
(beat) It's a small, difficult thing
- The rental car sits in a corner of the mostly empty lot, as far as possible from the razor-wire fence and exercise pens
- Zack waits in the driver's seat, smoking
He looks nervously through the windshield toward the pens
Bitsey raps on the window, startling him
Fuck
Zack unlocks the door, throws his cigarette out
Bitsey opens the door and gets in
Hey
(waving her hand at the smoke) For God's sake, Zack
You're not a happy camper
It's not a happy place
He  the
Talked to the Austin prosecutor
Belyeu's a yokel
Prosecutor says he fucked up the penalty phase, says Gale probably would have gotten life on mitigating factors
Gale stuck with him, though, all through appeals, despite major pro bono offers
What else
Notta on Berlin, we pick up the money in Houston tonight, overheat light came on twice, and you're about to get a surprise
don't want a surprise
(pointing ahead) Too late
- The guardhouse is now occupied
The crossing guard is down
Across the drive sits a Texas Highway Patrol car
All along the drive's left side, protest vehicles are parked in the grass
They stretch out to the two-lane highway, where another Highway patrol car is stationed
The drive's right side is also marked off, though the only vehicle on this side is a Houston  news truck
Six people in ponchos discuss something in the middle of the drive
The rental car  the
Bitsey and Zack approach the guardhouse
This is mostly an Oklahoma caravan
got stuck behind them on the way in
The guardhouse attendant looks in, waves them through as the crossing guard lifts
Execution's not for another 36 hours
It's gonna be a zoo
There's the guy
Standing among the six people in ponchos is Duke Grover
They pass him in
He sees them, smiles, makes a "Hello" shooting-gesture
What a life, waiting around for someone to die
Fuck, look
The next-to-last vehicle on the left is the Older Cowboy's pickup
He sits inside talking with another man
The Older Cowboy sees them, touches his hat as they pass
This is a little too coincidental
-  - The rental car passes a farmhouse
Bitsey and Zack are headed to Huntsville
'Cause  couldn't see the license plate
Forget it
What time is it
6:05
Why don't you have a watch
It's a long story
-  - The rental car passes a black teenager hitchhiking in front of an abandoned vegetable stand
- Bitsey and Zack make their way to their rooms
Zack's is first
Give me an hour
'    - Zack unlocks his door, enters
The room's a mess, papers everywhere
He walks toward a portable computer sitting on the room desk
Zack
Zack runs from the room
- Zack runs towards Bitsey
She stands outside her room
What
It's open
So
Maybe the maid forgot
(pointing) Look
As he comes to her door, he sees what she's indicating: Between the door and its frame, someone has stuck a roll of duct tape
'    - Bitsey pushes the door open, looks in and around
She sees something, enters
Zack enters behind her, sees what she sees
'll check the bathroom
He goes
She approaches the middle of the room
The room, in contrast to Zack's, is perfectly neat
It has two twin beds
The nightstand has been moved to the center
On it is a lamp, turned on
Suspended just above the lamp, a cartridge hangs from the ceiling by fishing line
' Zack checks behind the shower curtain
Clear in here
Don't touch it
As Zack enters, he sees Bitsey holding the  Cassette
Fuck, Bitsey, there could have been prints
Look
She holds up the cassette
It has a label typed from an old typewriter: "For Bitsey Bloom
" - Zack runs out the front door carrying a , the cables drag the ground behind him
He runs toward the rooms
'   - Bitsey unlocks the door, lets Zack in
She says no one asked for you
And all the room keys are different
He goes to the
Just she and her husband have masters
What did you tell her
That you have a jealous boyfriend
He starts to hook up the
Thanks
How about the
She didn't ask
think she assumed it had something to do with why he was jealous
still say we should do this in my room -- this one's a fucking crime scene
Whoever got in here -- without a key in broad daylight -- was probably smart enough not to leave prints have the remote
He turns  the
Maybe they could look for
Try three
(hitting the remote) They don't look for
when someone breaks in to deliver, Zack
Here
She hands him the tape
He starts to put it in, hesitates, looks back at her
You sure you want to see what's on here
No
Start it
He puts it in, pushes play
She sits on the bed
He sits beside her
They watch the black leader appear
hope this isn't what  think it is
- An image flickers in
It's a woman lying nude on the kitchen floor of house 3307, facing away from the camera
An opaque white kitchen bag is over her head, sealed at the neck with duct tape
Her hands are handcuffed behind her
She appears dead
(
) God, no
(
) Fuck
Is it her
(
) Turn it up
They stare at the screen, she bites a thumbnail
He turns the sound up
3307 -  -  ( ) Hi-8 video: The woman does not move
The kitchen is cleaner than we've seen it, but otherwise unchanged
Kitchen gloves can be seen -- laid upside down and inside out -- on the dish rack beside the sink
Near the body on the floor is a roll of duct tape
In the lower right corner of the screen is part of what looks like a towel
The audio is full of contributes
can barely be heard in the distance, so can what sounds like a
Suddenly, the woman makes a muffled sound, seems to come to life
Her wrists start to pull against the handcuffs, then jerk at them
She panics
He legs flail, kick against the counter
She screams, muffled, frantic
She rolls onto her stomach, her whole body fights against the cuffs
She desperately rubs her face along the linoleum trying to rip the plastic
Soon, her energy wanes, she jerks less
Her covered face now points toward the camera
Her head seems to rock, a sleepy nod
Her body goes slack
Black
- Bitsey stands at the railing, looking out at the interstate and a thunderstorm gathering on the horizon
After a few seconds, Zack comes up beside her
Belyeu says to bring the tape first thing tomorrow
Also said you were right about not calling the police
beat, she keeps looking straight on
Are you gonna be okay
Bitsey takes a deep breath, turns to him, holds his eyes
She shakes her head no
Her lips start to tremble
He puts his arms around her as she starts to cry
- Bitsey and Zack sit at a booth having coffee
Zack smokes
The  cassette is also between them, as is a small stack of crumpled tissues
The thunderstorm can be heard in the distance
The waitress is refilling their cups, and they wait until she leaves
Hushed tones
Let's say Gale's right
Some sick- fuck-Agatha Christie-wannabe set him up, arranged like the perfect murder
Why send a magazine journalist proof a few hours before he's won
Doesn't make sense
No, it's perfect
He knows News Magazine won't give the scoop to the dailies or nightly news, not after having paid for it
Probably guessed we wouldn't call the cops
And, most importantly, knows 'll tell Gale tomorrow
Why does he give a shit
Zack, what if Harraway's murder was just a means to getting Gale
mean sending him through hell, a sick cat and mouse game
You kill the one person he has left
Make sure he sits six years on death row for the murder -- a place he's made a public career of loathing
And then just let him die, die knowing everyone will remember him with disgust
You destroy his loved ones, his life's work, his memory -- and you make him watch
That's a lot of hate
You're talking beyond sadism
Bitsey gestures to the tape, makes a need--say-more face
Then why release it
If the mouse dies the game's over
Maybe the cat's enjoying himself
Or
Or
(picks up the tape) Imagine walking to the chamber knowing this exists
The 'cat' is a fucking psychopath
Yeah, but smart
- The storm batters the motel
We see Bitsey's dark front window
Lightning
figure stands looking out
More lightning
It's Bitsey, intently watching the night
- : On the back seat is an aluminum suitcase
Zack sits beside it looking out the back window
Bitsey drives
It's still raining, hard
They're on the two-lane highway to Austin
Why do they call it check-book journalism if we always pay cash
The over-heat light is on
Woa, woa
Sadist at six o'clock
Is it the truck
' The cowboy's truck can be seen through the tire mist fifty yards behind them
Yep, and doing a lousy job of hiding
Bitsey watches in the rearview mirror
Zack out the back window
He must think we're idiots
You think he's our fucked-up feline
Bitsey doesn't respond, just watches in the mirror, then: Is he gaining
No
Just sitting back there
Can you see the license
Too much mist
What the fuck does this guy want
- The office has a view of the rain-soaked capital
Expensively decorated
Dark woods and deep carpets -- Belyeu's practice is clearly thriving
sharp-looking sits at a corner table counting money from the aluminum suitcase
Bitsey sits on a huge sofa
Belyeu stands just outside his door
(
) Fine
Oh, and bring in Miss Bloom's original when that's done
(entering, to Bitsey) Don't blame you for not watching that twice
He goes to his desk and starts sifting through papers
couldn't sleep afterwards
understand
generally tell folks 'm no more afraid of the grim reaper than  am of a Presbyterian on Mother's Day
But watching your tape
well
had to keep tellin' myself 'that's not Constance' just to get through
(a beat) Unfortunately, others may argue the same
Yeah, but it's her kitchen, in her house
Currently home to Weirdos Incorporated
Arguably, that tape could have been made by anybody with twenty dollars and a tolerance for vulgarity
But it will at least get us a postponement
hope so, Miss Bloom,  certainly hope so
But you've got to remember that there's a machine a runnin'
And come six o'clock tomorrow mornin' that machine wants to be fed
The Clerk puts the last of the money back into the suitcase
All here, Mr
Belyeu
(to the Clerk) Thank you, Joshua
(to Bitsey) To add to our troubles, your own credibility may come into question
The Clerk exits
Why
You've been fraternizin' with the condemned
In the court's eyes, he's the most likely candidate to have put you onto the tape
He's a persuasive man, you're a out-of-state woman -- it don't look good on paper
But someone put it in my hotel room
fact for which we have no evidence
very professional-looking assistant enters, hands Bitsey her video
Thank you, Bobbi
Thanks
(standing) Well, let's not start readin' Kafka just yet
Could we find a sympathetic judge
'll file within the hour
You headin' back over to Ellis
(standing) Yeah
Fine
'll call over at the motel later and give you an update
- Bitsey comes out of two huge oak doors, walks past a gold "Belyeu and Crane" sign
She turns a corner
At the end of another short hall, she comes to the elevator, pushes the call button
As she waits, she looks out an adjacent window at the capital in the rain
She remembers something, looks down -- she has her purse but no umbrella
Shit
She heads back toward Belyeu's office
As she turns the corner, she sees the older cowboy enter the Belyeu and Crane office
- Bitsey hurries umbrella-less through the rain to the rental car parked in the loading zone
- Bitsey opens the door
Zack's in the passenger seat
She doesn't bother to sit
Did you see the cowboy go in
He went in Belyeu's building
Into his office
Just saw him
Fuck
Follow him
Find out who he is, where he lives -- what he -- How are you gonna get to Ellis
taxi
Zack makes a face
- taxi makes its way through the hundreds of protesters and press that now gather along the drive
- Bitsey, wet and hugging herself, paces in front of David
She's upset
Okay, okay
Calm down
You have to sit
Over the loudspeaker: (
) Visitors need to stay seated
She sits
(to the microphone above) Sorry
(to Bitsey) Look at me
He's not your man
His name is Dusty Wright, DeathWatch Director before Constance
He's a 'bullhorner,' a zealot who thinks a good demonstration has to end in a riot and arrests
'Almost martyrs don't mean shit
' They fired him
Constance kept him in the organization, and he loved her for it
The man adored her
Then why was he following us
Why was he at Belyeu and Crane
He and Benny used to work
cases together, until Dusty punched a clansman in a federal court
Benny sometimes still gives him work, probably had him follow you
Why
beat
David looks up at the microphone
To make sure you honored your agreement, one for which there's no contract
He would've said something
He's a lawyer, Ms
Bloom
Maybe Dusty was jealous because you were seeing Constance
wasn't 'seeing' Constance
She died
she had your sperm -- It's more complicated than that
Rotates

-  -  ( ) David sits in a lawn chair beside his Volvo
The tailgate's down, serving as a makeshift table for a coffee thermos and whiskey bottle
David stares off down the alley, clearly in pain
He holds a child's drawing
- Has Gaudi's church and a matador in background
Prominent in the foreground are three labeled figures: Sharon ("Mommy"), Chase ("Me") and a dark-haired man ("Papa Jorge")
Jorge is dressed in a tux, Sharon seems to wear a bridal gown
-  (6:09) The atmosphere is tense
Dusty Wright sits on a deskholding a red Magic Marker, the matron sits behind it
They look at the college guy, who closely watches a computer screen
In the center of the room, a middle-aged priest sits and quietly prays while holding the hands of an overweight woman, she murmurs quiet affirmations
Finally, the college guy looks up at Dusty, nods
The room's occupants all exchange glances
Dusty walks to the photo wall, marks a cross through the photo of Jo Ann Johnson, then walks to the back office
- Constance, wrapped in an afghan, sleeps on a futon
She's shockingly anemic
Dusty kneels beside her, watches her sleep
After a beat, she wakes with a slight jolt -- like someone whose been fighting to stay awake
She looks at him, then sees the marker in his hand
She looks away
All  can feel is envy
Dusty stands, goes to the alley window
' David's Volvo is parked just outside the window
David sits in a lawn chair behind it
David looks awful
- In the window, Dusty holds up the marker
David nods
3307 - '   - David sits on the porch holding a drink, a bottle of Black Bush in the chair beside him
He's staring at nothing
Constance comes out the open sliding glass door, wearing a turtleneck sweater and wrapped in her afghan
She goes to the chair beside him, picks up the bottle and sits
They silently survey the yard, the sunset
She hugs the bottle, he sips his drink
Remember those Kubler-Ross stages, the ones the dying go through
Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance
Where are you
Denial
Denial's my personal favorite
The whole idea of there being a process makes me tired
'm not up to the job of Dying Person
Marveling at blades of grass
Lecturing strangers to relish every moment
Mending bridges
Mending bridges
Confessing regrets
Uuuggh
No regrets
Nope
beat
Take that back
wish  had a child
Me, too
'm sorry, David
She reaches over and puts her hand on his arm
guess  just wish  would have risked more
She has the bottle in her other hand, looks at it, takes a swig
(making a face, swallowing hard) Uumm, also not enough sex
Should have had more sex
She puts the bottle down beside her chair
How much
how many lovers have you had
Including college
Including college
Her hand (on his arm) holds up four fingers
Well, it's
not every
yeah, you should have had more sex
She laughs, coughs
He laughs
Their laughter trails off into the yard
He takes her hand in his
You work hard not to be seen as a sex object
Before long, you're not seen at all
see you
They are holding hands in the air, their elbows on the chairs' armrests
Want to make it five
Finish the hand
pity lay
No thanks
beat
They watch their fingers lightly play with one another
It wouldn't be pity
They turn, their eyes meet, hold
'  - Constance and David are in bed making love
He's on top, one hand supports her head, the other strokes her face
They tenderly kiss
He starts moving, gently
Are you okay
Don't worry
He kisses her neck
It's good
Moves up to her ear
Talk to me
Let me hear your voice
(in her ear) 'm here
Happy
'm very happy
He kisses her mouth, moves against her in delicate rhythm
Her moans take on a teary edge
Their voices, breathless whispers, meld into one another
Hold me tight
'm here
Tight
'm scared
It's okay
She's begun to cry
Okay
He stops moving, kisses her tears
Don't stop
Stay in me
Please stay in me
He moves again, slowly
Shhh
'm staying
need to feel you inside
It's okay
'm inside
'm not pulling out
'm so tired
know,  know
Tired of being afraid
Shhh
Help me
'm here
It's okay
Help me
Please
Make it stop
Shhh
'm here
'm here
'  (3307) - The house is dark
light in one of the rooms comes on
'  - She's awake as David enters
He opens the curtains, sets a glass of water beside bottles on the nightstand
He crawls on top of the covers, spoons her, nuzzles the back of her head
How do you feel about last night
Rescued
You
Like  have a reason to get out of bed
Ironic, huh
- David goes to the pay phone against the building
'  - Constance stands in a bathrobe beside her shower
Turns the water on
She's caught in a thought, bites her lip
She turns the water off
- David sits in a lounger speaking to someone on his right
He's sober
Let's say they move back from Spain, that  somehow got my one weekend a month
Would it matter
By high school, 'd be his weak spot, the focus of locker room jabs, embarrassed pride
In college there'd be late- night angst: 'What if  turn out like the old man
' Holidays would be forced smiles and unscheduled exits
mean, what girl comes home with you if there's talk that Pops is a rapist
beat
can't stand the idea of being his model of failure
Without him, drink
To cover the hole
To prove to myself he's better off without me
to reveal Dusty Wright sitting in the lounger beside him
'  - Constance, still in her robe, puts an armful of sheets in the washing machine
She feels faint
-   - David sits in a swing set, rocks slowly
He's simply looking at the house
yuppie woman opens the back door
(standing) Sorry, just leaving
'   - Constance is quickly sorting through a box of memorabilia, a photo catches her attention
- Constance on vacation in a Caribbean resort
She sits alone at a dinner table, looks to camera, seems surprised to be photographed
As Constance contemplates the photo, she hears the ring
-   - We see David lying in the grass of recently-cut lawn
'  - David in the car in a mall parking lot, staring at nothing
On the seat beside him is Cloud Dog and a half empty Black Bush bottle
'  - David's asleep, using Cloud Dog as a pillow
The bottle is empty
light flashes in on him, waking him
There's a  on the window -- it's the police
He's blinded by the flashlight
The policeman holds the light
(
) (a loudspeaker voice) Gale, time's up
: : -    - Bitsey's agitated
David's drained
But there has to be someone
Someone with a motive, who knew you both
Someone who visited that morning
If  could answer
we wouldn't be having this conversation
It's why need you, why  chose you
You have my story, now
(mimicking her delivery) 'Go
' There's not enough time
The guard approaches
You'll find time
You know that's not what  meant
You should have done this earlier
You're not here to save me
You're here to save my son's memory of his father -- that's all  want
beat
You're going to let them kill you
David moves to the back of the cage to be handcuffed
We live to stop death
Eating, inventing, loving, praying, fighting, killing -- choose a verb
All to stall this evil, Job's 'king of terrors
' But what do we really know about it
Nobody comes back
There's a point, when your mind out-lives its obsessions, when your habits survive your dreams, when your losses
You wonder, maybe death is a gift
All  know is that by this time tomorrow, 'll be better off
What  don't know is why
(exits the cage) Goodbye, Bitsey
The guard escorts him away
When he's out of earshot: (softly) Goodbye, David
- guard hangs up a phone and leans out the door
Car's on its way
Wanna wait in here
Bitsey stands in the rain
Behind her, hundreds of protesters flank the drive
No thanks
She turns and walks toward the highway
The parade tape has been replaced with crowd barriers
The drive's left side now overflows with abolitionists: They cluster beneath tarps, some sing hymns, others paint signs ("Don't kill with my taxes
", "Mark 6:10," "Murder doesn't Stop Murder
")
Beneath one umbrella stands a large black woman holding a candle -- she watches Bitsey
The right side is a media circus
Various pro-death penalty activists also cluster here
They too have prepared signs: "Rape and Suffocate Him
", "Thank Jesus for Justice," "'Let's Do it'
"  blackboard keeps a countdown: "13 hours
" At the end of the drive, on the left, Bitsey sees a sign leaning against a camper: "Save David Gale
" It catches rain; its letters run
- The restaurant's crowded
Church of Christ couple (50s) eat without comment
The man's -shirt reads, "It's Simple: You Kill, You Get Killed
" In the booth beside them sit Bitsey and Zack, their dinners largely untouched
Bitsey watches three sleazy at a table not far from theirs
#1 got it
got it
You could have corporate sponsors
Volkswagen for Bundy, Home Depot for Gacy
And 'The David Gale Execution, brought to you by
' #2 '
Hefty
' They find this hilarious
Bitsey looks away
What time is it
(checking his watch) Nine hours, 52 minutes
beat
- Pouring rain
As Bitsey and Zack hurry toward their rooms, they see Belyeu getting out of his Cadillac
He carries Bitsey's umbrella and opens his own
Belyeu
He turns, comes toward them
Bitsey holds a newspaper over her head, Zack slouches
Did you have Dusty Wright follow us
employ Mr
Wright from time to time
You could have said something
(opening her umbrella) That would have defeated the purpose
Apologies if  caused you unnecessary anxiety, but 'm paid to be suspicious
(handing it to her) Thought 'd return this
Any word on the writ
Denied
Tape went to a federal judge two hours ago
Your videographer friend made contact
No
What you got was definitely a snippet
Could be he has more previews scheduled
Best stick close to your room
How's David
Holdin' up
'm headed back over
Tell him 'll take care of it, about his son,  mean
Will do
We'll talk later
She nods
Watch yourselves
They turn from one another
Bitsey turns back
(calling after him) Mr
Belyeu
He turns
Were Dusty and Constance close
Thick as thieves
Bitsey nods
'    - Dark
Bitsey and Zack sit on either side of the room's table looking out the window
Rain shadows run down their faces
The room phone is on the table, as is Zack's watch: 10:17
-   - - The rain's lightened up
The motel's full
Lights are on in ten of the motel rooms
The Kettle's lights go off, one after another
'    - Zack sleeps at the end of one bed, fully dressed
Bitsey, lost in agitated thought, neatly packs a suit into her perfectly arranged suitcase
She stops, thinks
She goes to her purse and takes out the  cassette, a pen and a note pad
Hesitating a beat, she puts the tape in the
She turns on the  and waits for an image
- Rain
All the rooms except Bitsey's are dark
From within comes a  glow
'    -  - ' - She's sketched a flow-chart of the tape with major elements timed out
has her shoes off, sits on the floor with her back against a bed
She's still watching the tape, tired, exasperated
Finally, she turns the  , rubs her eyes
She stands, looks at the radio alarm clock on the nightstand: 11:33
- Bitsey brushes her teeth
Looks down and sees a towel on the floor
Picks it up, starts to hang it on the towel rack, stops, looks at herself in the mirror
beat
An idea hits her, first as something odd, then as a freight train
She spits, hurries into the bedroom
- (putting on her shoes) Zack
Wake up
Get up
He starts to pull himself awake
Did you throw the towel on the floor
What
The towel on my bathroom floor
Did you put it there
Yeah,  guess
It's a hotel room
What -- Do you do that at home
No
Fuck, Bitsey
'm sorry, it's not like it's -- Get up

We're going over the crime scene
Bitsey checks the kitchen
The tripod's back
The other exhibit pieces haven't changed
And for the next hour  want you to do exactly what  say when  say to do it
If  say suck Zack's dick, all  want to hear from you is 'May swallow
' You want me to suck his dick
It's just a patriarchal figure of speech
Is your boyfriend here
He ain't exactly my boyfriend anymore
Well is his video camera here
Yeah
Get it
She starts to leave, turns back
gotta collect first
Bitsey, moaning, reaches for her purse

Zack's hand  the , turns the - Video: The Goth Girl's messy kitchen
Camera zooms in to a perspective similar to that on the Constance tape
The exhibit pieces (kitchen gloves, handcuffs, tape roll) are more-or- less where they were before
The Goth Girl enters the frame, she's removing pizza boxes and laundry from the counter
(
) Move those index cards, too
She picks up the index cards
Zack looks up from a video camera's eye piece
The camera is on the tripod, connected to the Goth Girl's
Near it, the hotel /
Bitsey cues the Constance tape to the beginning, freezes the image
Zack then checks the camera angle on the Goth Girl's
He moves the TVs so that they are side-by- side
Zoom in a hair
He does so
Bitsey compares perspectives between the left (Goth Girl cleaning) to the right  (Constance)
Put the gloves on a dish rack
don't have one
Zack goes to the sink, lays three pizza boxes on the counter as an ersatz dish rack -- he drapes the kitchen gloves over them
Turn them inside out
He does so
Move the tape roll about a foot to the left
And get rid of the handcuffs
Zack repositions the tape
The Goth Girl picks up the handcuffs
Come check this, Zack
(to the Goth Girl) Could you
what's your name
Nico's cool
Nico, lie down on the floor, facing the counter
Zack comes behind the tripod and looks at the TVs
sits on the floor, starts to take off her -shirt
We can imagine that part
(to Bitsey) 'll position her
He goes to Nico, arranges her in the position of Constance (which now bears no relation to the white outline on the floor)
That's fine
Just straighten her legs
Zack comes back behind the tripod
He and Bitsey look at the two  images -- roughly the same
The Constance tape, however, shows what looks like a white towel in the lower right-hand corner
Bitsey points to it
What's this
Towel or something
Okay, look at this
She plays the tape of Constance for eight seconds
noticed this back at the hotel
See
Bitsey touches the  screen by one of Constance's feet
The foot moves ever so slightly
She hits pause
She moves her foot
Why
Fucking good question
It's another fifteen seconds before she comes to
If she had passed out once, without fresh air she wouldn't come back
There was no head trauma, her blood tested normal -- Jesus, maybe she was faking, hoping he would go away
Or
Bitsey looks up at Nico
We've got to bag her
Woa
Not a good idea
All right, 'll do it
- Nico hurries from the bedroom into the kitchen
Bitsey and Zack stand by the sink
white plastic bag is now on the sink counter; beside it, the roll of duct tape
found it
Nico hands Zack the key to the handcuffs
He tests them, then lays them on the counter
(to Zack) Okay,  want you to wait three minutes before you take it off
Bitsey, 'm not so sure about this
Three full minutes
Just stand behind the tripod
Both of you
Zack and Nico move behind the tripod
Bitsey puts the bag on her head, rips off a long length of tape
She seals the bag around her neck
She then handcuffs herself from behind, with some difficulty
- is on the sink counter while she does this
(
) (through the bag) Have you started
Twenty-two seconds
Bitsey sits on the linoleum, then lies on her side
Thirty seconds
Fuckin' wicked
Bitsey lies perfectly still
Thirty-five
Forty
Forty-five
Fifty
Maybe she shouldn't
Fifty-five
one minute
five
ten
one-fifteen
Bitsey starts to pull slightly at the cuffs
Fuck
Twenty
twenty-five
thirty
This isn't cool
thirty-five
Fuck
one-forty
one-forty fi
Bitsey panics, fights like hell against the cuffs
(through the bag) Zack
Zack runs to her, knocking the tripod over
He rips the bag open
She sucks air
(ripping at the tape) Jesus fucking Christ, Bitsey
You okay
What if 'd've waited
She tries to catch her breath
Nico releases the handcuffs
No more fucking experiments, all right
Just tell me what's going on
You okay
Bitsey nods, holds up her hand, wants to say something
She takes his arm, looks at him
(still breathing heavily) She
she did it herself
- Zack sits on the couch holding the handcuffs and smoking
Nico sits on one of its armrests
Bitsey, full of adrenaline, paces in front of them, thinking out loud
She used the gloves to keep fingerprints off the tape and bag
Then she put them back on the dish rack, but upside down and inside out, a housewives' habit
murderer would have just tossed them aside -- like they were the first time we were here, like you do a towel in a hotel
Maybe, all right, maybe
(indicating the cuffs) But why wear these
They threw me
forgot you have to have the key to put them on
But she needed them
She knew she would instinctively try to rip the bag off, that at some point automatism would kick in
Fuckin' , like when people hang themselves
At the last second they go chicken, claw at the rope and shit
The police find their own skin beneath their nails
And she swallowed the key so she couldn't get to it
She made sure there was no way out
Woa, chill, chill
Why not hang yourself, or take pills
Why take your fucking clothes off
Why make it look like a murder
beat
Bitsey contemplates
It's so calculated
She's handcuffed, taped at the mouth
The gloves
The damn tripod
Why, Bitsey
Why fake your own murder
don't know
Motive's like a major issue here
Thanks, Zack
It doesn't make sense
The woman's a bleeding-heart abolitionist
Why frame an innocent man
Why send Gale to the chair for what looks -- What'd you say
She had to know some innocent fuck would take the fall
Oh my God, Zack, that's it
That's why
To prove it happens
To have absolute proof that the system convicts innocents
Get the fuck out of here
No, that's how she thought
She lived for DeathWatch
If she's gonna die, why not die for it
That's why the tripod was here
To record proof, undeniable proof, the tape
That's why we got an out-take
dead woman put the tape in your room
Of course not
She needed help, someone to keep it, release it
Someone she could trust, someone dedicated to the cause
They stare at each other a beat
The same thought: (mimicking Belyeu) Thick as thieves
'  - Dusty looks up at a wall clock: 4:23
He sits fully dressed in his living room, listening to an
He closes his eyes
of his window and into: '  - Behind a couple of trees near the woods' edge, Bitsey and Zack hide watching him
Hairy
Come on
She turns back into the woods
- Bitsey and Zack emerge from the woods near the rental car
They walk and speak quickly in the light rain
Because of the Berlin thing, Constance knew the police would go straight to Gale
In a way, he's perfect
high profile alcoholic whose life was shit anyway
But
She was in love with him
don't know
Something
They were close
She wouldn't want him dead
They come to the car, get in
- Bitsey drives
Remember this thing about Dusty being a bull-horner, going to far
Why he was fired from DeathWatch, and the
Right
Maybe the plan was for Dusty to release the tape after Gale's conviction, after a year or so
You know, force him to dry out, let him play the heroic victim, give him back his dignity
So, Dusty Wright's sitting on this tape, waiting, the only one who knows about it
And maybe good ole Dusty starts to think that an erroneous execution is a hell of a lot more politically useful than a last-minute save
Which would only prove the system works
Yeah
Almost martyrs don't count
What's one murder to stop thousands
So he'll wait, release the whole tape after the execution
Right
Somewhere he must have the original
What time is it
'  - The wall clock: 4:50
Dusty hears the   over a '
He turns the  , and picks up
Hello
- The gas station is old, isolated on a country road
Closed, dark
By the road, a single light pole illuminates the area -- its light catching the drizzle
Directly beneath the pole is a phone booth, where Bitsey waits by the rental car
- Zack is on the phone with the booth door open
Bitsey stands just outside
Let's talk about your tape
No, meet me at the station down the hill, in fifteen minutes
Zack hangs up before Dusty can respond
He stops out of the booth and gives Bitsey a tentative look
'  - Dusty hangs up, thinks
- Bitsey sits in the car's driver seat
Zack stands by the booth
Don't move from the booth
Call the second you see the truck
Remember, let it ring just once
Then get into the woods -- know
Go
(pulling away) Into the woods, Zack
Go
- Bitsey is in the woods, watches Dusty pull away in the pickup
She hurries to the front door, enters
- Bitsey turns on the lights and begins searching
She sees 11 videos on a bookshelf
Some are labeled, three aren't
She takes the cassettes to the /
Puts one in (her hands are wet)
Nothing
She searches for the right  channel
- Zack anxiously waits
His eyes check the road
- Bitsey has a picture, but the tape is an old  western
She starts to fast forward, realizes she won't be able to do so with each tape, hits eject
She checks the clock: 5:04
She takes another unlabeled tape
It's a home video of a city council meeting
(hitting eject) Shit
She grabs the next unlabeled tape
- Zack paces in front of the booth, checks his watch
- Bitsey has an old " Love Lucy" episode
Ejects, looks at the label: "Lucy
" She grabs another, labeled "Unforgiven
" The credits from Unforgiven roll on screen
Shit
- Zack sees lights coming toward him
Gets into the phone booth, drops two coins, dials six numbers
He hesitates to punch the seventh, checks the road
The approaching lights belong to a car
He quickly hangs up
- Bitsey is frantic
Another tape is an old Johnny Carson interview with Pavarotti
Shit
She reaches for another
- Zack hugs himself in the waning drizzle
Come on
Fucking come on
Bitsey has what looks like an office Christmas party
She goes for another tape -- the last
Cheyenne Autumn comes up on the screen
She hits eject
She gets up, unsure what to do next
She goes back to the bookshelf, pulls books out to look behind them for more tapes, indifferent to the mess
She goes to a filing cabinet, quickly rifles it
She looks around the room, sees something
She goes to a large oak desk with an old typewriter on it
After the other drawers, she looks in the lap drawer
It's empty except for large padded envelope addressed to "Bitsey Bloom/News Magazine/40

She rips it open, pulls out a  cassette and checks the label: "Constance

She looks at the phone, then at the clock: 5:14
The phone doesn't ring again
beat of absolute silence
Bitsey goes quickly to the  and puts in the tape -- hands shaking
After a few seconds, Constance appears standing in her kitchen by the sink, dressed in a bathrobe
She's wearing the kitchen gloves and fills a glass with water
Constance turns from the sink: (
) (her voice weak) Ready
The response is silent, but she nods
beat -- she bites her lower lip
In one quick movement she takes the key from the handcuffs and swallows it with the water
It goes down with difficulty; she coughs, then signals she's okay
She puts the glass in the sink
She takes the duct tape roll, rips off a long section, sticks one end to the back of her gloved hand
She tears off another small section, drops the roll on the floor
She tapes the small section over her mouth
She then takes the plastic bag from the counter, looks at it a beat
Constance turns toward camera, mouth taped, eyes watering
She nods once, and turns back
She quickly puts the bag over her head
After she has smoothed the excess air out with one hand, she takes the packing tape from the other
She seals the bag around her neck
She smoothly takes off the gloves
They're inside out and she snaps them so that the fingers extend
She drops them upside down on the dish rack
She removes her robe -- she's nude beneath -- and tosses it aside
It lands in the bottom right hand corner of the screen
She feels for the handcuffs on the counter, takes them
She sits on the floor, cuffs herself
She rolls onto her side, perfectly still, waiting
Engrossed, trembling
The spell breaks as she comes to the part of the tape she's seen before
Averting her eyes, she fast-forwards past where Constance struggles to where she dies
Constance lies perfectly still
beat
man wearing gloves walks into the frame: Dusty
This is what she's needed
Dusty goes to Constance, kneels and, removing a glove, checks her pulse
He looks briefly up into the camera, then stands
He picks up her robe and comes back past the tripod
beat
We see only Constance's dead body -- then black
hand grabs her shoulder
She screams and spins around
It's Zack, breathing hard
He didn't show
Fuckin' move
Bitsey hits the eject button
- Bitsey and Zack hurry out of the cabin and into the woods
The pickup is nowhere to be seen
As they disappear into the trees, Dusty can be seen standing beneath the eave at the side of the house, watching
- The car moves full speed through the misty dawn
The drizzle has stopped
- Bitsey drives
The overheat light is on
Zack has her purse in his lap, rips a page out of her phone book
She's almost in tears, yelling
Everyone
Wake up New York, the warden, the Governor, the goddamn Supreme Court death clerk
How far is it
Took me 30 this afternoon
You've got 26, maybe more
'll make it
-      - The rental car slides to a near stop on the interstate shoulder
Zack jumps out, as Bitsey spins away again
He runs across the frontage road toward the motel in the mist
- The rental car barrels through the empty square, ignoring stop signs
-  - The rental car flies past a "Huntsville City Limit" sign and disappears into the fog
- The overheat light is still on
Bitsey looks down, then turns on the

She punches scan

An arrow sign at the fork reads: " Ellis Unit/8 Miles

- The rental car, smoke pouring from the engine, clunks to a dead roll, stops
Bitsey jumps out,  cassette in hand
She doesn't close the door

The driver   his , swerves around her onto highway's shoulder and drives on
She runs
Runs past an abandoned vegetable stand
Runs past a sleepy farmhouse
She runs, and runs
She slows, out of strength, looks up and down the highway
Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a tunnel of fog
She stumbles on, a final effort
She runs
Sees something
Stops cold
Coming toward her in the distance are small flashing lights
They rise on hill and then fall behind another
They appear again
Soon, she can make out the form of an ambulance, and its highway patrol escort
The vehicles move slowly toward her, without sirens, as deathly quiet as their cargo
She stands to the side of the road as they approach
The highway patrol vehicle and the ambulance -- marked "Texas Department of Corrections" -- pass silently in
She watches as they disappear back into the mist

As to whether this will change policy, the people of Texas will have to decide

He wears the clothes he was wearing the day Constance died

He carries a duty-free bag and the aluminum suitcase

Dusty puts the aluminum suitcase on the doormat
From the duty-free bag he takes out David's Yale sweatshirt, lays it over the case

He stands at the top of the stairs, waiting for someone to answer before descending
Sharon (older than we've seen her) opens the door, sees the case and sweatshirt
She looks around, but Dusty is gone
She picks them up

It's a sunny day in New York
For the first time, we see her wearing something besides a business suit
Framed on her cubicle wall is the latest News cover page: a picture of David with the headline "The Executed Innocent
" drops a Fed Ex package on her desk
This just came
It's from "Belyeu & Crane/420 Congress Ave
/Austin, Texas, 78710
" She opens it, pulls out Cloud Dog and a handwritten note on Belyeu & Crane stationery
- reads: "David wanted you to have this
He said it would be the key to your freedom
Regards, Benjamin Belyeu
" '   - At the breakfast table, a Spanish yuppie male sits with a newspaper in front of him
He watches Sharon open the case
Inside: money, stacks and stacks of money
On top is an unsigned note: "'m sorrier than you can know

puzzled
Looks at the note, Key to your freedom
Key to your
Suddenly, she understands
She squeezes the sheep, shakes it, hears something
She cuts the sheep open with scissors
Hi-8 tape is in the stuffing
It's hand labeled: "Off the record

Bitsey hurries  the cubicles
She goes  a hall and  the "MultiMedia" room
