" Turn", shooting draft, revised by Richard Rutowski & Oliver Stone -Turn (Stray Dogs) Screenplay by John Ridley and Richard Rutowski & Oliver Stone : "" - : It is early morning and already hot
drone, crackle, and scurry for shade
burrow to escape the sun
We can see the heat shimmering off the surface of the Earth
On a dusty highway, a pair of  dine on a dead coyote
One of them snags an intestine and tugs a few feet of it out of the carcass
In the distance, where a long, dusty road meets the horizon, a small shape appears -- a Sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang convertible, its top down
Its candy-apple red burns like a brilliant fireball under the sun
As the car drifts closer, we see steam escaping from under the hood
Sammi Smith's "Please Help Me Get Through The Night" plays on the car's radio
'  - At the wheel, ignoring impending disaster,  , young, good-looking, fiddles with the  dial, annoyed only to find country stations
He's been driving since noon yesterday and it shows -- along with a heavily-bandaged left hand resting on the steering wheel
He finds something by Pearl Jam or Smashing Pumpkins and he cranks it
He pops a Percodan with his good hand as, in the shimmering distance ahead, he sees black shapes in the road and lays on the horn
Get off the goddamn road
- As the  powers by, the  move off the shoulder, silently watching
- The  blares as  fights to stay awake
His attention is caught by blue and red lights flashing in the oncoming lane
He sits up as the   (  inside) closes quickly
The  starts faintly, then  as the cruiser roars past at speed
Fuck you
There is a loud pop from the front of the Mustang and a thick cloud of steam now pours from the hood
The temperature gauge now starts rising
No
Not now
Shit
couple of  roar past in the opposite direction, buffetting the Mustang with their air waves
- The car rolls into a fork in the road, limping with the droop of an animal that won't make another hundred yards
One sign on the larger road says "" is 29 miles away
The other sign, on the lesser road, tells us "" is only 2 miles
third sign confirms his destiny with "Gas, Food, 1 Mile
" seems to have no choice
He aims the car down the lesser road towards "Superior, Arizona
" - The car rattles on its last legs, as  mutters incantations, noticing a old, ghostlike   at the base of the mountains overlooking the
It's deserted now, no one visible, the gates shut, but in its vast, dark bulk, we sense the ancient richness and power of this town
Bobby moves on
'  - Down the road from the  , '  pulls into a small  , made of weather-beaten wood, its windows long since dusted over
The pumps themselves look to have been manufactured in the early fifties
Above the station is a sign so faded it's barely readable: '
Bobby gets out of the car and with great care, favoring his bandaged left hand which seems to give him a great deal of pain, he opens the hood
plume of steam hits him in the face
Oh shit
Bobby looks around for someone, anyone
After a few moments he reaches into the car and blows the horn
He waits, then blows it again
From out of the station walks  - a slow-looking man in coveralls caked with grease and dirty
He looks the part of a yokel
You Harlin
Nope
Darrell
Harlin around
He's up at the Look Out
Darrell points a scraggly finger at a plateau in the distance
Will he be back soon
Doubt it
He's dead
The Look Out's a cemetery
You own this place
Yep
Then why do you call it Harlin's
'Cause Harlin used to own it
But he's dead
So
Bobby is confused, but chooses to drop the matter
You want to take a look at my car
think the radiator hose is-- Damn
Gonna be another hot one today
Sometimes  don't even want to get out of bed
Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither
Then of course the clouds come in
Darrell mops his brow with a greasy rag
It doesn't so much wipe the sweat as it does streak his forehead with dirt
Look, Harlin, 've got places to be
Darrell-- Darrell
Could you just take a look at my radiator hose
It's busted
Darrell is clearly upset at being cut off
He leans into the car and looks at the engine
So
It's your radiator hose
It's busted
know it's busted
What did  just tell you
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself
If  could do you think 'd be standing here wasting my time
Can you fix it, or do  have to go somewhere else
Somewhere else
Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here
Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut
Okay, 'm stuck
You happy
Now can you fix it, or not
Yeah,  can fix it
Great
Gotta run over to the yard and see if  can find a hose like this one, or close enough
Gonna take time
How much time
Time
(rewinds his watch) What time is it now
Twenty-after-ten
Jesus
Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already
Ninety-two
Course half hour from now might be seventy-two
These clouds move around a lot
Bobby wipes the bandaged hand across his forehead
What happened to your hand
Self-consciously Bobby quickly drops his hand to his side
Accident
You got to be more careful
Hands is important
Let me show you something
When was a kid, now  don't know if you can still see it, but  gashed my fingers in a lawnmower
'm very interested in this but is there someplace
Diner up a piece
Not much, but us simple folk like it
'll be back in a couple of hours
And be careful with her, will you
Darrell slams down the hood
Just a car
Bobby reaches into the car, pulls out a small ugly gym bag which he slings onto his shoulder and moves to the trunk, pops it open
It's not just a car
It's a sixty-four and half Mustang convertible
That's the difference between you and me, and why you live here and 'm just passing through
The trunk lid rises in the air, partially blocking Bobby from Darrell, acting as a partition between them
Now do you mind
got to get some stuff out of the trunk
He throws the car key to Darrell who takes the hint, spits grotesquely into the dirt, scratches his nuts, and walks back to the shack
Concealed by the trunk lid, Bobby pulls out a  (a
9mm black Baretta), wrapped in a t-shirt, from the top of the bag
Perhaps we see a flash of green money, lots of it
Sports pages and betting sheets are piled inside
With a look around, Bobby takes the gun and stashes it underneath the rubber mat in the trunk
Briefly we notice a towing  under the mat
There is a small travel bag, from which he peels a fresh bottle of Percodan, quickly taking two, as well as the sports page
'  - watches out of the darkened office through the front window, as  slams the trunk and starts walking down the road, with the bag on his shoulder
- walks along a dusty patch of road into town past a sign saying " - " As he walks on, a pair of  roar past on their Harleys blanketing him in a cloud of
He shouts after them, but his words are lost under the whine of the cycle engines
- hits town, such as it is:  The Freeway left here a few years back
There are only a few little stores:   general store, a catalog outlet, a post office that doubles as a bus depot
All of them built for the desert heat
The busiest spot in town seems to be the truckstop/diner with a few 18 wheelers parked outside it
At the corner of one street sits an old   dressed in raggedy clothes, perhaps an Indian
His -  lies next to him
He's talking to   , veterans perhaps, Indian or Spanish
They both have missing limbs and slide off with furtive alcoholic looks as Bobby passes
The Blind Man yells out in an American Indian accent
Hey
You there
You want something, old man
Don't call me old man
Ain't you got no respect, boy
You want something
Yeah  want something
want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop
You can't do that yourself
Hell no,  can't do that myself
'm blind
Can't you see that
'm sorry,  didn't-- What'd you think  was doing out here with these glasses on
Sunnin' myself
don't know
thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes
ain't got no eyes
You want to see
Christ no
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam
Lost them fighting the commies
Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me
said  was sorry
Don't be sorry
Just run over there and get me my pop before  die of thirst
Yeah, sure
You got change
Change
You want my change
fought the war and lost my eyes just so  could give you my change
All right, old man
Christ
Bobby walks across the street to a very old soda machine; it has bottles instead of cans
The blind man shouts to Bobby
Get me a Dr
Peppa
don't want no Colas
Colas ain't nothing but flavored water
Bobby puts change in the machine and pulls out a bottle of Dr
Pepper
He starts back to the blind man
Don't forget to open it for me
can't be opening my own bottle
Christ
Bobby goes back to the machine and opens the bottle, then walks back to the old man who pours a splash on the ground
little for Mother Earth
'm about fifty percent Indian, you know
To all our relations
He takes a hearty swig of the soda
Ah
Just what  needed
Want some
The blind man holds the bottle out to Bobby
string of saliva runs from his lips to the bottle's neck
'll pass
Bobby reaches down and pets the old man's dog
Flies buzz around both the dog and the Blind Man
think you'd better give your pooch a sip
He looks sick
That's 'cause he's dead
Bobby jumps back
Oh, Jesus
hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for
He's only just dead
What was  supposed to do with him
can't take him away anywhere
And nobody wants to take him for me
Do you
Hell no
See
Ain't nothing  can do but keep him here beside me
That's where he belongs anyways
Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when  lost my eyes
He was just a pup then
a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him
miss him
(as Bobby moves away) 'll see ya later, unless  come across something worse
Bobby noticing a beautiful woman down the street,  McKENNA, compulsively turns and catches up to her
She is dressed better than the usual t-shirts and tank tops of this town -- perhaps a mail-ordered dress or a mother's hand-me-down
With her raven hair and caramel skin, it is obvious she is Native American
Her arms are full with an awkward package she can barely manage
Can  give you a hand, beautiful
'm just going to my car
That's right on my way
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers
My name is Bobby
Now 'm not a stranger anymore
See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful
Do you have to call me that
don't know your real name
Maybe  don't want you to
Grace stops walking
Maybe, but if you didn't  think you would have kept on walking
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you
like that about me, beautiful
It's Grace
May  carry your package, Grace
Grace hesitates, then gives the package to Bobby
He has trouble with it himself
Jesus
You sure you can manage
got it
Do you want me to carry your pack for you
Bobby blurts out emphatically
No
He catches himself, and softens a bit
No, 've got it
What happened to your hand
Accident
You should be more careful
They start walking towards Grace's car
It's very nice of you to help me
That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot
No trouble at all, really
They get to a car and Bobby puts down the package
Wasn't nothing
Oh, this isn't my car
It's down a ways
should have parked closer
just didn't think it would be so heavy
could drive up
That's all right
got it
Bobby takes up the package and they begin walking again
The package seems to have gained weight
It's just new drapes and curtain rods
If had known it was going to be so heavy would have had them delivered up to the house
Bobby struggles with the package
Sweat starts to sheet his face
(panting) That a fact
just got tired of looking at the old drapes
My mother made them
Had them long as  can remember
You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it
(straining) Yes,  have
'Course they cost a little more than should really be spending
But, damn it, don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself
deserve nice things
(can hardly talk) can't
argue
They arrive at a
This is it
Bobby practically drops the package
He is covered with sweat
Thank you, Bobby
You're welcome, Grace
You're not from around here, are you
Why you say that
Just because  help a lady with her package
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day
just drove in this morning
Drove into Superior
What for
Didn't have a choice
My car overheated up the road
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert
Day like today, you'd be dead in no time
When you leaving
Not until my car's fixed
don't know how long that's going to take
And here 've made you all hot and sweaty
Grace steps to Bobby and places her hand against his chest
She rubs away some of the sweat
They look at each other a beat , seen earlier, pulls up beside them from behind and idles
is a weathered, handsome, middle-aged man with suspicious eyes, black haired in contrast to Bobby's sandiness
Morning Grace
Morning Sheriff
Got my drapes
Well it's about time
Looks like you found yourself a helper too
Bobby wants to shrink behind the drapes
Well, he offered, and  just couldn't refuse
His car overheated
Oh
Bobby turns to the Sheriff and forces a smile
Morning, officer
Son
(beat, to Grace) Little excitement out at the reservation this morning
Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun
handled it
went by for backup
Anybody hurt
Hell, no
That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk
He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self
(beat) Well, anyhow, you stay cool
Nice meeting you, son
Same here, officer
The Sheriff drives on
Pause
They look at each other
Well,  guess  could use some help getting this box into the house
Not far
You could shower, get something cool to drink
Bobby considers the offer, but there's not much considering to do
Well,  could use something cool
- rides along with  in her
Where you coming from
All over
Chicago, Houston, Detroit
Just lately Dallas
You've been around
guess 've got wander in my blood
Where you headed
don't know
have to make a stop in Vegas
Business to finish
Then maybe 'll head to Santa Barbara
might be able to pick up some action there
So, what is it you do, Mister
Cooper
Bobby Cooper
Oh you know, whatever pays best
Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition
(drops it)
never played tennis
You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work
You must like taking chances
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes
What happens when you lose
pack up and go somewhere else
(wistfully) Somewhere else
've never been anywhere else
Just once
Years ago
Went to the State Fair
It was nice, but it wasn't nothing
couldn't stay in this place
wouldn't
'd just pick up, do whatever  had to do, and get out
Grace looks to Bobby and smiles
Sometimes  feel the exact same way
' / -  - , naked, steps into the shower and turns on the water
It shoots from the shower head and cascades over his body
As the water falls over him we hear a Russian accented voice: (
) want my money
Bobby press his left hand against the white tile to steady himself
His hand is curled in such a way we cannot see his pinky or ring finger
Bobby leans back in the shower
Just as he does: - It is raining hard
Matching the backwards motion of the last scene  is thrown violently against a brick wall, facing out
(
) want my money
Look, 'll get the money
You don't want to do this
(
) Take two for now
One a week, punk
Bobby is being pressed against the wall by two muscular
Another  stands partially hidden behind the goon's frame
With one hand one goon flattens Bobby's hand against the brick, with his other he clips two fingers off with a
We see Bobby's face in agonizing pain, then he slides screaming to the ground until he is framed between the legs of the men
As Bobby clutches his left hand the rainwater runs in streaks down his ashen, blank face
' / - We see 's face reliving the experience as once again we hear the voice
(
) Two weeks, asshole
Get the money or you gonna lose your nose and ears
Bobby has slumped to the floor of the shower, looking to his left hand, almost crying, unable to tolerate it
As a streak of blood snakes down the white tile we see that the pinky and ring have been cut off at the joints
' / - , his hand rebandaged, is putting on his clothes
(to himself) You're still lucky
As he does he looks at himself in the mirror
He bends to pick up his shirt which is draped over the gym bag
As he lifts it we can see, perhaps more closely than at the garage, that the bag is 3/4 filled with money
He closes the bag and stands
In the , hidden in the doorway, he sees  watching him
Bobby slows perceptibly, but does not try to hide himself
After a moment Grace walks into the room carrying a glass of lemonade
Thought you might like a refill on your lemonade
Bobby takes the lemonade and drinks it down
He rubs the glass against his forehead
That's good
Cools you right off
(tentatively)  saw you watching me
'm sorry
didn't mean to
didn't say it bothered me
Did you like it; me watching you
guess
've got an ego same as any man
Good, 'cause  liked what  saw
Bobby gives a smile as devilish as it is pleasant
Grace slides an ice cube from the glass between her lips
He notices a framed picture of  and an
Nice place
Thank you
Grace sits on the edge of the bed
Bobby indicates the picture, ironic
Who's that, your father
(without much thought) Stepfather
(coy) Got a boyfriend
No
Not really
Bobby senses she's lying but plays along
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house
guess it must
What do you do anyway
little of this, a little of that
Mostly tell fortunes
Where'd you learn to do that
From my father
He was the tribe's shaman
medicine man
Those are white words, not ours
Nice house for a shaman's daughter
You must be good
Come here
Bobby goes to Grace and kneels before her
She takes his head in her hands and looks deep into his eyes
Her voice goes thick, but soft, like a morning fog
There's something in your past; something you want to keep hidden
There's a pain
Something
someone you can't forget
And there is something you want very badly
It seems very far away to you, but you are determined, and you will do what you must to get it
Bobby closes his hands on Grace's and takes them from his face
He is more than slightly spooked by the accuracy of Grace's reading
My face tell you all that
It tells me what every face tells me
Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want
(seductively) What is it you want
The same thing you do
They silently stare into each other's eyes
Really
want to hang drapes
Grace walks from the room
For a moment Bobby stares after her
He takes an ice cube from his glass and crunches it in his teeth
'   - is standing on a step ladder trying to hang the drapes
notices a photo of Grace with an older  , her mother
Hold me
Bobby stands behind her, gently places his hands on Grace's waist
Tighter
won't break
You know girls are a lot tougher than men think
Bobby holds her tighter as she finished hanging the drapes
His eyes are transfixed on her ass
There
All done
Lift me down
What
Lift me down
Bobby lifts Grace down from the ladder
He holds her, his hands around her waist
You can let go of me now
'm safe
(with a wicked smile) How do they look
Like you
Beautiful
(kidding) Like they're made of polyester
like them
was sick of looking at this room
think they add a little life
Nothing like a little liveliness
With a sexy pout Grace loads the next question
No more drapes to hang
Now what should we do
have an idea
And what would that be
Bobby steps close to Grace and takes her by the shoulders
He pulls her to him and presses his lips hard to hers
Grace doesn't respond
All right, Grace
No more games
(innocently) Games
You flirt with me, then you run cold
You lead me on, then slap me down
don't go for being jerked around
Really
And what game did you want to play
You carry my box for me, and  fall into bed with you
Bobby grabs up his pack
think  can find my own way back to into town
Maybe  like to find out about a man first
Maybe  like to know what he's made of
'm just flesh and blood, baby
That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys
But you already know that
You read my mind, remember
Thanks for the lemonade
Bobby turns to leave
You never did answer my question
Still playing
That's not an answer
What is it you want
You know what  want
Maybe  just want to hear you say it
For a beat Bobby stands and stares hard at Grace
His pack slides from his shoulder and thuds on the floor
With great determination, like a beast closing for the kill, Bobby moves for her
Grace stands firm, ready for him; her head tilts back
Her breath comes deep and hard
Just as Bobby is about to reach her, just as he is about to take her, he is stopped dead by the booming voice of  McKENNA
(
) Grace
Bobby turns to face Jake:  An older man, still large and formidable for his age
(nonplussed) Jake
thought you
Who the hell is this
Who the hell are you
'm her husband
(shocked whisper) Husband
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me 'll break you in half
Easy, chief
was helping your wife
met her in town
She needed a hand with her drapes
That's all
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes
swear to you that's all that happened haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom
lot that means
Grace, tell him
Grace says nothing
She picks up a glass of lemonade and sips at it coolly
Damn it, Grace
Tell him
(coyly) If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true
Oh yeah, and  suppose you didn't have anything to do with it Grace, he just wandered up here by hisself
got a mind to put you over my knee and paddle your ass raw (to Grace) You bitch
Is this what it's all about
You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you
You both
Forget it
(heads for the door) Where you going
(exiting) 'Scuse me, you want to take my head off, mister
won't even try to stop you deserve it for being an idiot
But if you're not,  think 'll be on my way
Ow
Jake punches him in the nose
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch
'm gonna tear you a new asshole
You broke my nose
It ain't broke
It probably isn't, but it bleeds
Bobby feels the blood and then sees it on his shirt
Goddamn it
'm
you're lucky  don't sue you
(opens the door) Get goin' Junior
Bobby glares back at Grace who gives him a maddening little smile
You people are crazy
He storms out holding his nose
-  - , holding a handkerchief to his nose which has stopped bleeding, hauling his bag on his shoulder, walks back to town along the side of the road
Already he is caked with a mixture of sweat and dust, looking up at the relentless sun that beats down on him
Fuckin' shithole
slows beside him,  driving
What the fuck do you want
'll give you a lift, son
Too hot to be walking
People die out here, y'know
Bobby continues walking
Aw, you're not still upset about that love tap, are you
If  meant you real trouble, 'd have given it to you by now
Get in, lad
Come on
Get in
Bobby gets in
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, got so pissed off,  pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead
Sorry  lost my cool like that
It's a funny thing, women
Yeah
Say, what happened to your hand
Accident
You've got to be-- Yeah,  know
More careful
guess we've never been introduced proper
Jake McKenna
That's a solid name
'm a solid man
Bobby Cooper
"Bobby Cooper
" What brings you to Superior, Coop
An overheated car
Oh
Darrell taking good care of you
Darrell's a moron
(laughs) Yeah, he sure is a character
You need any help with that car now
Where you headed
California
Live there
Got work
know a man who's got a boat
Wants me to sail it for him
You a sailor man
That'd be the life
Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away
man could pretty well disappear like that
Just sail away until all he was was a memory
guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile
hope so
(beat) Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If  had known she was married-- It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it
Not a wit
Do you know why
Because you're a man without scruples
Wait a second-- Ah,  can smell it on you
Jake wipes his hand across the back of Bobby's neck and holds it to his nose
Hey
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body
Don't be offended, lad
man who's got no ethics is a free man
envy that
Beside, how can  blame you
That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she
Eh
Jake nudges Bobby who smiles a nervous smile
She does at that
knew when  married her she was a free spirit
woman with her looks and a man my age; what was  to expect
But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do
So,  married her
What are you to do, eh
Women
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em
Jake looks at Bobby, his lips curled into a sly smile
"You can't shoot 'em
"  like that
(laughs)  bet she led you on good, didn't she
Taking you up to the house to hang drapes
Oh that's a good one
Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face
bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out
Then me busting in like some wild bear
Ha
Bet you had a fire going under you
Like you don't know
Mad like a dog in heat,  bet you were can tell you got a temper on you
Bobby gives a little laugh
Bet you just wanted to snap her neck right then, didn't you
Bet you just wanted to kill her
Bobby starts to laugh heartily
Jake joins in, then stops abruptly
Would you
Would  what
Would you kill her
Bobby starts to laugh
Bobby stops laughing
Because 'm sick and tired of her little games
Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again
Because 've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and  would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it
For a moment Bobby sits in silence not sure of what to make of the offer
've done a few things but 'm not a murderer, Mr
McKenna
How do you know if you've never tried
This is a joke, right
You just want to rattle me
Right
They reach town and Jake stops the car near a small That's right
Nothing but a joke
That's all
Bobby gets out of the car
With a big smile Jake says: Enjoy your stay, lad
Jake speeds away
Bobby looks after him
Who are these people
- The store is small and dark and empty save for a tiny, older Mexican  who is behind the counter
enters
Got any cold soda
Eh
Soda
You got any soda
Hablar slowly, por favor
My ingles no es bien
Soda
You know
Bobby cups his hand and brings it to his mouth pantomiming
Oh
Something to eat
Si
She holds up a pack of Twinkies
Not eat
Drink
What the fuck is drink in Spanish
uh, agua
The old woman's eyes widen
She starts to scream, but quickly clamps her hands over her mouth
For a moment Bobby thinks the woman is screaming at what he has said
Then, as if he feels a presence behind him, Bobby turns slowly to face the tough-looking, unshaven, tattoo-covered
One holds a gun
That's right, lady
Keep it in you and nobody gets hurt
That goes for you too, stud
Gimmie the money
Now
Eh
The dinero, Senora
Hand it over
Bobby shifts his weight trying to hide his pack behind his back
The woman goes to an old-fashioned cash register and rings it open
She hands the money to the biker
That's it
Lady,  got kids to put through school
Es all  have
The biker turns to Bobby
Okay, pal
Whatcha got
Give it, now
Bobby pulls a thick wad of cash ($1,000 plus) from his pant pocket, tosses it on the counter
(thumbing through it, impressed) Nice
Just who are you beautiful
What else you got for papa
Bobby makes a show of pulling out his wallet, flings it to him
Better
you're getting tasty
Now toss the bag, sweetie
It's just books
'm a reader
Toss it
(an entreaty) It's personal things
family things
How touching
like family values
Give it to me
Bobby takes an unsteady breath
No
No
Hey man, forget it
Come on
No
Senor, give him the bag
That's all right
He doesn't want to give me the bag
He's fucking with you man
Shoot him
(cont'd) he doesn't have to give me the bag
The biker grabs Bobby's bag
Bobby flinches in anticipation of a shot but refuses to let go of the bag
The biker swings the gun hard, clipping Bobby across the forehead
Bobby falls against the counter and to the floor
The woman starts to scream
The biker grabs up the pack, then, looking back at the woman, sees a ring on her finger
He grabs her hand and pulls at the ring
The woman screams wildly
Let's go, man
little extra never hurt, Benji, would you just relax
No
No
My wedding ring
He pulls the ring from the woman's finger and pushes her back
With Bobby's bag slung over his shoulder he turns to leave
Now we go
You go to El Diablo
From beneath the counter the woman pulls a shotgun
The woman fires   that rips through the bag and into the back of the biker
He falls to the ground, very dead, amid a shower of blood and shredded money
Bugger
You bitch
The Second Biker now sees the money floating all over the place out of the torn bag
His eyes go big with greed as he  at the old woman, who ducks behind the counter
The Biker grabs for the bag and what's left of the money, not expecting the feisty old lady to pop up and unload her into him and the bag
Whatever was left of the money on the first round is now gone to shreds along with the bag and the Biker who is very dead
Bobby is staggered, crawls towards the shreds
(cursing in Spanish) Hijos de puta
Bayan a comer su propia mierda en el infierno
(: Sons of bitches
Go eat your own shit in hell)
She comes around the counter to his side as he grabs his wallet and the $1000 cash roll from the dead biker's pants
call the sheriff
No
No police
Bobby gives her a hundred dollars
hundred dollars
No police
Bobby gives her some more cash
She looks at him
Finally he gives her the entire wad
No police until  leave
Bobby stumbles from the store as the screen burns a bright white
: - , dazed and holding his head, sits on the ground next to a that is dripping water
He cups his hands under the water and splashes it against his face, lightly wiping the cut above his eye
The '  goes wailing by on the main drag
Recoiling from being spotted, Bobby tries to take another drink
crawls out of the faucet
He jumps back
'  - is leaning under the hood of a car working on its engine as  walks up
Hey
Hey, your
what the hell happened to you
Nothing
Don't look like nothing
Just banged my head
It was an accident
Another accident
You got to be more careful
Bobby rolls his eyes
Then notices the front fenders have been removed
What the hell happened to my car
Bottom hose was shot too
Rotted clear through
Had to put a new one in
Runs like a dream now
(suspicious) How much
Well
you got your parts, you got your labour
let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks
How much
Hundred-fifty
To replace a goddamn radiator hose
goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang
You know how long it took me to find that hose
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer 've been gone
Actually, it's been about three hours
You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy
What you expect but fancy damn prices
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari
You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang
" What's that got to do with the radiator hose
don't know, but "it's the reason 'm living here and you're just passing through
"  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because  don't have the money
Then you ain't gonna have the car
Listen, man
got rolled half an hour ago for everything  had
Bobby digs through his bloodied wallet, trying to hide it from Darrell
He fishes out a five dollar bill
Then digs out a bloody one dollar bill from his pocket
've got five
six dollars
Darrell snatches the five from him and adds it to a thick wad of greasy bills he carries in his overalls
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole
You can keep that dollar
Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on  and have him send you the money lickity split
don't have a goddamn credit card
Now that's too bad
sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off
Bobby proffers his Movado watch
Look,  got a Movado
It's worth at least seven, eight hundred
You could sell it for that
(studying it) Who the hell to
Shit, can't see no numbers
You don't need numbers
That's why it's expensive
Look at the gold
Darrell doubts that, shake his head
got no day, got no date
Probably ain't worth a duck's fart (proffers his own watch)
This one here cost me $3
75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine
No sir 'll stick with this (walks away)
You son of a bitch
'll have my lawyers shut you down
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer
Sweet talk me all you want
Didn't you read the sign
It says
What sign
Fuck the sign
want my car
want my hundred and forty-five dollars
Bobby stands his ground for a moment as if deciding whether or not to fight for the car, then wheels and walks away
Darrell looks at him, smirks
/ - It is a little worn diner-type stop one would find on most any open road:  Counter with stools, laminated menus, a Wurlitzer in the corner belching out country
Business is slow but it's the only restaurant in town
There is a    in the kitchen, and , a hard-looking waitress is behind the counter
couple of regular drivers,  and , are seated on the stools, Boyd is flipping a coin
One-hundred-thirteen degrees
That was back in July of forty-seven
That afternoon it dropped down to forty three
True story
One time last year  remember it went from 98 to 23 same day
Wind, black clouds come out like
comes out of the men's room and sits at the end of the counter
He has cleaned himself up a bit but still looks like a mess
He buries his face in the menu
You got a beer
What kind
Beck's
No Beck's
-1, Coors
Heineken
No, we ain't got no Heineken
We got Miller
Genuine Draft
No
Just plain ol' Miller
Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it
'll fuckin' take it
To go
Flo, cheeseburger bleedin'
'll be right back with that beer
Flo moves off
and a waitress named Flo
Christ
As Bobby stares at the money on the counter in front of him, he hears, from somewhere outside the diner, the sound of a crackling
He now feels something against his foot
He looks down and sees a  rubbing against his leg
He gives it a good kick sending it sliding across the floor with a screech
Fucking cat
In the background, two teenagers sit at a booth
looks the part of a local, wearing jeans and a white -shirt
His hair is cropped close and he looks to be a senior in high school
His girl, , is nondescript, neither ugly nor beautiful
She is the kind of girl most guys would pass without a second look
Toby gets up from his booth and goes to the bathroom
After he is gone Jenny walks to Bobby
Hey, Mister
You gotta quarter for the juke
What
wanna play a song on the juke
You got a quarter
Bobby looks at Jenny, then picks a quarter from his winnings and flips it to her
He can't resist putting a little charm into it
What happened to your hand
cut it shaving;  know,  gotta be more careful
Got any requests
That country shit all sounds the same to me
How about  pick one out for you
Bobby half smiles
Jenny plays a song
Patsy Cline's "Your Cheatin' Heart
"  Jenny takes up a stool next to Bobby's
You like Patsy Cline
just love her
How come,  wonder, she don't put out no more new records
Cause she's dead
Gee, that's sad
Don't that make you sad
've had time to get over it
You're not from around here, are you
Where you from
Oz
You ain't from Oz
Oz is in that movie
You're too quick for me
Toby walks back into the room
He looks at Jenny
He looks at Bobby
He looks at Jenny talking to Bobby
He loses it
No
No
No 'm seeing but 'm not believin'
Stop the wedding
This can't be
Hey
What are you doing with my girl
Bobby says nothing, ignoring Toby
axed you a question
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing
We was just talking
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table
(to Bobby) Now, 'm not going to axe you again, Mister
What were you doing with my girl
wasn't doing anything
That's not the way it looked to me
Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her
Make time
Is everybody in this town on drugs
Honest, Toby
just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox
Stay out of this, Jenny
We got man's business to take care of
ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and
Then maybe you should've
Look, pal, wasn't making a play for your girl
You expect me to believe that
don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone
Mister, 'm calling you out
What
You want to fight
Over her
Bobby looks Jenny over
Toby, you go finish your soda and leave the man alone
(to Bobby) You know who  am
Toby
Tucker
Everyone round here call me
You know why
Let's see
they're not very imaginative
'Cause 'm just like dynamite
And when go off, somebody gets hurt
Fine
was making time with your girl
Now 'm scared to death and  learned my lesson
Now can you go away
Not before  settle with you, chickenshit
Christ,  don't believe this
Stand up
wasn't hitting on your girl
Stand up, Mister, or 'll beat you where you sit
Bobby sits for a beat
he doesn't need a fight with Toby now with his damaged hand nor does he need to be noticed either
He sits there
Toby, you stop it now
Can't you see he's got a hurt hand
Don't you never mind, Flo
This is gonna be over real quick
Reluctantly Bobby rises, facing off against Toby, each clenching their fist and waiting for the other to make the first move
The tension builds
We see it on the faces of Jenny, Flo and the regulars
Just then the record on the juke ends and the needle scratches off
There is the crackle of a police radio as the door to the diner opens and    walks in
The tension eases
Toby, mindful of the sheriff, steps closer to Bobby and whispers menacingly into his ear
You're lucky, Mister
Don't think it's over
called you out and 'm gonna see this through
You hear me
(to Jenny) Come on, girl
got half a mind to make you walk home
Toby takes Jenny by the arm and pulls her out of the diner
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose
What was that all about
You know how that Toby is
Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny
More like Jenny is after every man she sees
(to Bobby) You pay Toby no mind
He just likes to show off for his girl
Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off
Still want that beer
(tense, seeing the Sheriff) 'll take it to go
Bobby holds his hand to his face to cover the cut on his forehead
How's it with you, Sheriff
Already started out bad
Couple of bikers from out of town tried to knock over Jamilla's grocery store this morning
It was a real shootout
What happened
The old witch killed 'em both
Holy shit
Poor thing
Is she all right
Sure, when the sons of bitches tried to steal her wedding ring
That's when she started shooting
Can't blame her
The ring was all Carlos left her when he died
Store's a mess
It's the desert
That's what it is
The desert makes everybody crazy
Ain't that right, Sheriff
People go crazy out here
Come on, Boyd
've got to make tracks
That yogurt's got to make Santa Fe before it spoils
Dr
Pepper don't have that problem
Ed and Boyd toss a few bills on the counter and exit
Flo stands near the cash register with Bobby's beer
can't open off-sale for you, sugar
Bobby pays for the beer ($1
75)
Flo opens the register
Let me get your change
Flo, 'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee
The Sheriff reaches around the counter for the pot
You be careful now, Virgil
Just as the words leave Flo's mouth the Sheriff spills the pot
It shatters against the floor spilling hot coffee everywhere
Flo runs over to him
Son of a bitch
Virgil
Now look at what you done
Are you all right
think  burned my gun hand
As Flo bends to wipe the counter, Virgil touches her intimately
(Cont'd) How 'bout we put something soft on it later
(a look) (quietly)  could put some butter on it, hon'
(Her normal abrasive voice) It'd serve you right, you asshole
Put it under some cold water
Joe, run get a mop and clean this fuckin' mess up
While everyone is distracted Bobby notices that the register drawer has been left open
He looks around to make sure he is not being watched
Slowly he eases his hand towards the drawer
It gets closer and closer
As he is about to grab the money there, the cat - the same one he kicked away earlier - hisses and claws at his hand
Bobby jumps back startled
Shasta
Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that
Sorry about that, mister
Let's see, you want $3
25
(gives it to him) You try to have a nice day now, would you
Sure, 'll try
With the Sheriff occupied, and the Mexican Jose mopping the floor, Bobby exits
-  - begs on the phone
Cici
Cici, it's Bobby
Bobby Cooper
Yeah, look,  know it's been a while, but 'm kind of in a jam
yeah
One-hundred-fifty dollars
That's a lie
called you on your birthday
Two years ago
can't help it if you didn't get the message
Cici, honey,  don't want to argue
need you to wire me the money
Because they're fucking going to didn't steal your 's
Yeah, well where's my Mr
Coffee
Cici
Cici
Bobby slams the phone
Bitch
Cunt
: -  - is on another call, circling a local sports page betting line
73-11, this is Pluto
What's the line on Dallas
' Pluto
Fucking deadbeat
We head about you
You owe "the commie" 13 dimes, why you tryin' to get in my office
Lose this fuckin' number
Mike
Mike
you asshole
' Mike who
(hangs up) Bobby, frustrated, clicks off
: '  - It is the kind of cheesy, temporary office one would expect to find in a Las Vegas apartment building overlooking the , dressed in a silk suit with conspicuous jewelry, sits behind his desk eating lunch and cleaning his nails
, his goon in a shiny polyester shirt, hovers over his boss helping feed and manicure him
These are the from Bobby's earlier
They are dangerous in an endearing way
Sergei answers the phone
In the background is a very voluptuous female, obviously from the Middle East
Da
Sergei, what are you, a Neanderthal
How many times do  have to tell you
You answer a phone "hello," not "da
" (nods yes) Sorry, Mr
Arkady
(into phone)"Hello
" (
) have a collect call from Bobby Cooper
Will you accept the charges
Mr
Arkady, deadbeat Cooper's calling
Mr
Arkady doesn't acknowledge him
He's calling collect
At this Mr
Arkady's head springs up
He snatches the phone from Sergei
(overly sweet) Bobby, what a surprise
expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone
: - on the phone
know, Mr
Arkadin
know
was on my way to you, it's just
what a day 've had
know 'm coming up with a highly improbable story, and  know you're not going to believe this, but this
is
what happened
had the money,  swear had it
was on my way to Vegas when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere
Mr
Arkady cleans his nails completely disinterested in what Bobby is saying
That's a shame, Bobby
real shame
And that's not the half of it, Mr
Arkadin
"Arkady" Right, Mr
Arkady
And that's not the half of it
got your money, and  go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then
well, it gets robbed And let me guess
This robber -- he gets your money
No
Two of them
Two robbers
And they both get nailed
get shot by the old lady
The old lady
With a shotgun She kills both of 'em, and
and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces
Not one bill is left alive
mean, what are the odds
(beat, dry) Pretty long, Bobby
Mr
Arkady, honest,  ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed
So now don't have a cent to my name
can't even get my car out of the garage
tell you, Mister
(pause) if it weren't for bad luck  wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know
(beat, waits)  So,  was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so  could get my car out of this garage, see
The bus depot here has a Western Union thing
And of course 'll pay it back with the rest of the money
(
) Which you don't have
But which  can get
No problem
Look, can sell my car in Vegas
Blue book it's worth 16 at least
just need the 150, uh
Sergei looks like he's ready to pound heads
(pause) Where are you
(hopeful) Uh
a little shithole in Arizona called Superior
About 200 miles east of Phoenix
(pausing,
) Superior, hunh
Bobby suddenly feeling suspicious
(
) Yeah, if you could send it care of
Now, let me get this straight
Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs
Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed
(
) hundred-forty-five would probably cover it
hundred and
Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:   don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller
You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and want it don't care how you get it, or where from, but  want it on my desk tomorrow, or 'll show you what real bad luck is
Sergei snaps a pencil he's holding in his hand, which goes flying by Arkady's head, forcing him to duck
Do you understand me you little fuck
(snaps) Oh, fuck you too
What'd you say to me
Shit 'm sorry
you can't believe the strain 'm under
'm just under a lot of strain here
There is a sharp silence at the other end
Bobby waits
Bobby, you owed me that 'bread' 4 weeks ago
Now you tell me you want another week
That's 5 weeks, Bobby
That's also 5 fingers, cause you and  know it's a finger a week Bobby
So you got balls
Good--now you come here tomorrow and you talk to me real nice and maybe  don't take the other 3 fingers you owe me, you see
Tomorrow -- and Bobby, don't make me come look for you, okay
have nice day
He hands the phone back to Sergei
(into phone) You got that
-- have nice day (hangs up)
The nerva that piece of shit
And look at you, you Neanderthal -- don't you fuckin' break pencils, you goombah
Finger
What are you, a faggot
In my country a man don't pay we cut off his head
Arkady motions Sergei to come close
Get your ass down to this Superior, Arizona
Bring me this Bobby Cooper don't think he got the lesson
This is your last chance, Sergei
Da
- , desperate, stares at the bandage of his wounded hand
It throbs, holding the hand to his ear
We hear an ' : (
) Hello
Hello
(
) Are you finished with your call
Yeah
(
) Please deposit an additional seventy-five cents
Bobby slams the phone against the hook
Goddamn rat's ass fuck
Shit
Damn
Damn
Damn
He marches from the phone booth, past an old
The phone falls from the hook and we hear a recorded voice: (
) Thank you for using &
In the store window, Bobby notices a set of garden shears for sale
- walks a bit going nowhere in particular
Looking at his watch thinking of Mr
Arkady, he shields himself with one hand from the sun
At the side of an old building, in the bit of shade it throws, he twists at the beer cap which sticks and won't turn
Bobby tries again twisting harder -- too hard -- as the cap jerkily twists off, cutting into his hand as it rotates
Bobby yells in pain
At the same time the beer comes foaming from the bottle and spills onto his sleeve
The bottle slips from his wet fingers and crashes on the ground, emptying
He clutches his bleeding hand, pissed
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
hate this fuckin' town
hate it
Do you hear me
(no answer) Get me outta here, please
gotta get out of this place
As if in answer, a  drives by on the main street looks pretty hot up there in the driver's seat, her eyes, behind sunglasses, flicking over him but not acknowledging him as she keeps going
Bobby's eyes throw back his own hostility at her, but unfortunately she misses it, as he now notices -- across the street -- a well-kept building with the most modern decor and signage, reading "McKenna's Realty Co
" He thinks about it, in a quandary
/ - In a rented convertible, we now see  racing across the desert
His jacket off, a man with a mission
He glances at his watch, eager to get to this "fucking hole in the wall" which is somewhere on this incomprehensible American map he holds in one hand
'   - squats, looking at a real estate model of a desert development
smiles
What can  do for you, lad
was hoping we could talk
Talk
About what
About things
About your wife
Sweet Grace
What about her
About what you said this morning
Jake shakes his head as if he doesn't understand
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife
Fifty-thousand dollars
do
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in
did
Don't play simple with me, Jake
You're a betting man
You want me to spell it out for you
'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money
Boy  think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on
'm not rambling
You're talking like a madman
Well then,  guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town
You're the one brought it up
This morning
In your car
Oh, that was just loose talk
Husband gettin' pissed off
don't want anybody dead
Bullshit
You wanted me to kill her
man doesn't always mean the things he says
You meant it
What makes you say that
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money
And what does that make you
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you
(pause) You're a jealous man Jake
If you can't have Grace to yourself
well, you're not the sharing kind
For a moment Jake stares quietly at Bobby
Well,  guess  have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace
You love her, but you hate her
No,  hate loving her
hate the kind of person she is
hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays
Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me
The bitch
She loved to play
She wants me to hit her and when hit her she likes it
She tortures me
But she's family
She's my little girl
My baby
couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull
No
Not me
But you
You got the killing in you, boy
How much you want
pause
Make it twenty
(stressed, paces) Twenty-thousand
don't have that kind of money
won't get the insurance until months after she's dead
don't imagine you'll want to be stickin' around after poor Grace's demise
Twenty-thousand; that's more money than  could ever get my hands on
How much could you get
Maybe
ten-thousand
And that's a maybe
need thirteen
That's a bit much
We're not talking about buying a car Jake
We're talking about killing your wife
It's thirteen, or it's nothing
For a moment the two men stand silent
All we hear is the ticking of a grandfather  that stands in the corner
You drive a hard bargain, but  had a feeling you were my boy when  met you
'm not your boy
don't like you
got no choice but to do business with you
Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience
Don't say that
had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead
Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract
(sarcastic) Do we shake hands
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife
The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing
If it doesn't, then it's no good
won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere
How do you want it
How the hell should  know
've never had a wife killed before
Jesus Christ
You want this job, you don't know how to do this
guess  should have hired a professional
You want to do this yourself
don't have to do this, you know
Be quiet, boy
got to figure this thing
'm thinking
It can't be done at the house
It should be
Jake walks the office thinking
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront
Oh yeah sure
Why don't  buy you a plane ticket right out of here while 'm at it know you (then) This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her
(beat) And tell her what
- stands on the porch talking to  through the screen of the front door
The look on his face is sincere
Hers is skeptical
We see the action take place as we hear Jake's
: (
) don't know
Tell her you had to see her
Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her
Sweet talk the woman
young buck like you must be good at that
Then
maybe shift the conversation
Get her thinking about that jeep of hers
She loves that thing
Maybe the only thing she does love
She'll want to take you for a ride
know you're not surprised 'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all
She's not surprised
(seeing his new cut) That's some cut
told you to be more careful
Yeah, well  said  was an idiot
Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk
How do you know he's still not here
Guys like me take those chances
Let's go
- '  cuts hard across the desert
Grace has a wild, excited look on her face
sits next to her looking somewhat nervous
(
) She'll take you out somewhere in the desert
She loves it out there; ridin' through the red rock and the mesas
So do guess we got that in common
She'll ride you out someplace quiet
Someplace deserted
: - has stopped the  on a plateau
sits beneath its shade while Grace walks in the sun seemingly unaffected by the heat
swoop above
(
) There won't be anyone for miles around
Just the two of you and some prairie dogs
That's all
You can sweet talk her a little if you like
Makes no difference to me
Just put her at ease, make her feel relaxed -- then do it '
ends
The scene is now synch with real time
Are there snakes out here
They hear you comin'
They won't bother you
Just don't sneak up on 'em
Doesn't the isolation bother you
Yeah, but  like the sun
grew up on a reservation
The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us
Jake's the same way
He loves the desert
guess we're alike that way
That's about the only way
You love him
No
Did you ever
Depends on what you call love
grew up on a reservation
patch of desert in the middle of nowhere
That's where they stick Indians, Bobby
That's where they leave us to die
My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore
There's no hope there
Jake was my ticket out
Mom and me
Is that why you're with him
let him think he was courtin' me, but reeled him in like a fish on a line wanted him
wanted what he could give me, and  would've done anything to get him
Is that love
'm guessing no
Yeah,  guess you're right
take it things didn't much work out the way you planned
'm still here, aren't
See this
Grace sweeps her hand before her across the expanse of the desert
The vultures are very much a part of this landscape
() All this nothing
It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me
He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond
More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole
You could leave him
don't know how
Walk away
It's not that easy
Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please
can't
don't want to be alone
need to know 'm going to be taken care of
You need a meal ticket is what you mean
Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here
Is that so bad
It's not like  wouldn't try to make him happy
For awhile, anyway
mean,  would
do things for him guess 'm no good that way
guess tried to sucker you along like that
Do you hate me for it
wouldn't blame you if you did
But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out
(soft echo) Whatever it takes
Grace steps to the edge of the plateau
wish  was a bird
know it's stupid
Every child says that
When  was growing up some of the old ones on the reservation believed people could actually change into animals
wish  could
We see Bobby behind Grace
He stares at her standing on the edge of the plateau
He rises and walks towards her slowly, but with deliberation
() If  was a bird  would fly to Florida; to Disney World
always wanted to go there
'd fly to New York
Maybe
guess New York isn't the best place to be a bird
'd fly to St
Louis, then New Orleans, all over Texas
Then 'd fly to California guess by then 'd have seen it all and could die
Bobby now stands a few feet behind Grace
She kicks a rock and watches it sail over the lip of the cliff into the nothingness below
() They say you don't feel anything
The shock kills you before you hit the ground
don't know how they would know that
But heard it's just like flying; straight down into the ground
guess if it doesn't hurt it's a beautiful thing
Bobby tenses himself
Sweat forms on his brow as he stands directly behind Grace with his hands extended before him
They hover just below her shoulder blades ready to push forward
Suddenly Grace wheels
Startled by Bobby she almost falls over the edge
Bobby grabs her, her weight still going back
Grace's life is literally in his hands
She looks down at the ground far below, then up into Bobby's eyes
She shows no fear, but instead wears a curious smirk
Hate's a funny thing
Right now  bet you don't know if you want to kill me, or fuck me
Bobby hesitates, then pulls Grace close and kisses her with great ardor on the lips
- On a blanket on the ground,  and  make love quickly, hotly, her dress pulled up, his pants down
But Grace is troubled and pulls out, further frustrating Bobby
No
Stop
can't
Her eyes withdraw into another dimension, as she hikes her dress back up
Bobby comes out of his own head, feels the distance between them
What's the matter
Grace
Nothing
Don't feel like nothing
He finishes relieving himself behind a tree, puts his pants back on
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can
Grace, 've been fucked over too many times, by too many women
You're becoming the queen of hot and cold
You'd never understand
Try me
It's just such a mess
With Jake  mean
Nothing  understand better than a mess
(in great tension) Jake was with my Mom after my real Dad died
You mean the Shaman
He was a Shaman
in the mine
We had nothin' after he died
Jake took us in, gave us a little money
He used to call me his "little halfbreed"
He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else
He had kids in Phoenix think, no one knew him around here
but the thing was
you see
(pause) he was raping me the whole time
for years
He loved to do things to me
Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass
'ever been in love with a woman's ass
The dominoes are tumbling for Bobby
Yeah
You're sick too
he loved to do things to me
Control me
My Mom
it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it
She become alcoholic
and the funny thing is-- liked it
liked being controlled by Jake
The truth was as far out and crazy as he got,  wanted more wanted to go all the way
Women say they don't want to be taken like, really taken -- that's bullshit -- they do
The first time he finished with me, he said  was a woman now
was 14
Then he started crying like a baby
wanted me to hold him
It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him
They found my Mom right down there (points) at the bottom of Apache Leap
She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil
Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane
But 'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident
She was born on this earth and she loved it
She was like me
She just wanted to fly away
Bobby is quietly stunned
whole world has opened up to him; and he isn't sure yet where the story ends
There is some force at work here, beyond his control
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him
but when  saw her body, swore to her on my soul that some day 'd get Jake for what he did to her
'm sorry
Yeah
What do you want
Life, right
(shrugs, stoic) Have you ever been to California
Yeah
(as if in a dream) Is it far from here
Oh yeah
It's far, it's another world
Is it pretty
Oh yeah
It's beautiful, beautiful beaches
Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see
(like a little girl) Would you take me with you
(pause) wish  could
Please
won't hang on you
As soon as we get there you can dump me
don't care just want to get out of here
Honey, baby, can't can't even get out of here myself Believe it or not,  need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic
Darrell
You know he and Jake are
You don't have any money put away, do you
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere
you could get me money
'll get you out of here
She looks at him
There's money
lot
The words hang there, thick between them
Where
Jake hides it
In a safe
In the floor
In the bedroom
He counts it
He loves to sit there and count it
What do you mean
At night
He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it
heard him
My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there
Maybe more
Bobby's eyes widen in hope
In cash Oh yeah
There's nothing else with Jake
He don't trust banks
He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed
He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me
never seen it but  know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least
One-hundred-thousand
That son-of-a-bitch
(puzzled) What do you mean
(ignoring her) If it's in a safe we'd have to get the combination-- It takes a key
He keeps it on himself all the time
mean all the time It scratches up against me when we do it
If the key's on him, how do we get the key
Kill him
Spoken almost innocently, it hangs there between them silence
can't kill, Grace
can't kill anybody
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby
He's had time to live
It'd be quick
mean, he wouldn't even have to feel it
(seductively)  mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet
when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and
Grace lays her hands on Bobby, starting to caress him
He bristles and freezes with fear and disgust
Shit
Listen to you
Are you crazy, Grace
He abruptly pulls away
Jesus Christ
think this place is making me crazy
was crazy to come back here and see you
'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and 'd sure as hell be crazy if  spent another minute with you
Grace rises, covering her nakedness, shooting a hand to his face, like she did when she read his fortune
But it's in you, Bobby
see it
see Death
It's in your heart
Let it out for me
Let it out
He's mesmerized
Then: Do it for me, Bobby, you'll never regret it
promise you
'll do anything for you
Anything Bobby pauses, terribly torn
take me back to town
He turns away, towards the jeep
Grace has a tone of desperation in her voice
You need the money, Bobby
It's a lot more than $100,000
lot more
How are you going to get out of here
You need the money
Whatever it takes, Bobby, remember
Bobby walks past the jeep, on his way back to town alone
Where you going
'll give you the ride
Come back
Bobby
It's three miles
Bobby doesn't look back
Her eyes drift backwards into her solitude
(to herself) Bobby
Whatever it takes
/   - walks through the desert parallel to the road, still in a rage
Desert insects produce a cacophony of drones, buzzes, and clicks
rattlesnake darts off a rock into the brush whispers to him
(
) You've got the killing in you, boy
Bobby turns and looks around
Just desert
He continues
(
) Next time you'll do just fine
No
The screen burns a bright white
- In a news pot, further down the street from where he was first seen, the old,   sits with his dead , speaking as if into camera, sipping on a Dr
Pepper
It's the desert that makes you crazy
The loneliness out here
Nobody to talk to
People on the run
Trailer parks
White trash
seen some peculiar things on a hot day
seen a scorpion sting itself to death
It just keeps driving its tail into its body again and again
little killer killing itself
Seen a coyote kill itself too
Just kept on biting and tearing at its own legs
Near tore one clean off before it bled to death
And what a white man'll do when it's freezing one moment, hot as hell the next
man could get hisself killed just for rubbing shoulders with another (smacking his lips) kiss kissy kiss
Nice pussy y'see, see it coming don't know what it is about the desert figger it's sort of like putting a kettle of water over a fire
People is mostly water
We boil when it's hot
'Cept when we boil the water's got no place to go
It just churns inside of us until we can cool off
If it's not too late
is now revealed standing next to the blind man, and we realize the blind man has been talking to him all along
Bobby sips a Dr
Pepper as well
You sure seen a lot for a blind man
Just 'cause  ain't got eyes doesn't mean can't see
That a fact
Bobby noticing now all the little   that the Blind Man keeps around him in a sort of inchoate stall
can see just fine
For example:  You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be
crackles, Bobby tensing
Maybe  do
Or maybe you just think you do
Just another small town
One guy chasing you
You go big town
Just gonna have four guys after you instead
Kiss kissy kiss
It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing
Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be
think 've heard that before
What do you want for free
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man
Seems like  do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head
And everything is everything
What
And everything is nothing too
(shakes his head) Maybe one day 'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise
Think you'll live that long
Bobby is clearly unnerved by this
Suddenly the blind man stands, pissed and powerful, sniffing the air with the police radio in it
As   cruises by, glancing at Bobby shrinking
The car goes on up the street
Cocksucker motherfucker
Cops
hear you
Always sneaking around
Thinks  can't see him
Well he's right
Motherfucker
But that ain't mean  don't know what's going on around here
They're all cursed
Yes sir
Who's cursed
All them miners last century
Hungry ghosts, killed off all the Indians
Up at the mine
Earth ran red with blood, think 'm fooling around here
White sky was on fire
Grown men cried like babies
saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me
They put me in the joint
Took my eyes cursed them
White people can't seem to stay away from Indians (grabs his bandaged hand, smelling the blood)
You gotta watch where ya put your fingers
Pussy pussy pussy, Indian pussy
It sounds demented
Bobby, checking him out to see if he's really blind, walks quietly around him during this monologue and peeks over his glasses trying to see the blind man's real eyes
Although he thinks the Blind Man thinks he's on the other side of him, the Blind Man fools him by suddenly swivelling around and cranking a gob of spit into Bobby's face as if Bobby were on the other side
Bobby, pissed, wipes the spittle from his face
(finishing) but they gotta know you don't fuck around with Indians
thought you said you lost your eyes in the war
So now you're going to tell me where  lost my eyes
You don't think  know where lost my eyes
was there when  lost them
lost them in the war
The war in the joint
There's always wars in the joint
Cause  was a code talker in the joint and in the war too
(sniffs) Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady
Be careful, boy
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's
This town's all inbreeding
Well, people gotta get by somehow
That's the curse
The mines done it
All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"
Everybody's got a mother
You don't rip up your mother
You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out
It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want
"
got things to do
(offended) Oh well, go do 'em
You don't see me stopping you
Bobby starts to walk away
The Blind Man rattles his tin cup
But ain't you got a little something for the infirm
'm a little short Pops
'll catch you next time
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well
- , depressed, is heading towards Harlin's gas station, passing  sitting on a corner drinking a soda, almost as if waiting for him
She runs to him, and follows him, as somewhere a   crackles and buzzes
Hey mister
Mister,  just
just wanted to thank you
For what
For defending my honor this afternoon
hate to bust your bubble honey, but wasn't defending you
But you was going to fight for me
wasn't going to fight for you
was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend
He's not my boyfriend
mean,  let him take me out and stuff, but  ain't spoken for
Not yet that is
Get it through your head, little girl; 'm not going for you
If this Toby likes you, then if  were you 'd marry him
You're not going to get much better in this town
That's what  thought until you came riding in
saw your car over at the gas station
It's a cool car
Want to take me for a ride
Desert's kind of lonely this time of day
How old are you
(beat) Eighteen
Well, 'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want
No,  don't want to take you for a ride
What  want is for
Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you
From   we hear
(
) Mister
Oh, shit
Toby moves menacingly up the street towards Bobby
That's right, Mister
You better be afraid
told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen
Now  find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back
wasn't sneaking around with your girl
Would you please tell him
You're too late, Toby
We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind
What the hell are you talking about
What's your name anyway
Oh, that tears it, Mister
'm gonna bust you up but good
'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then
and then bust those pieces up, and then
and then spread them all around
That's what 'm gonna do
You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister
'm crazy
'm psycho crazy
Yeah,  know
You're
Just like dynamite
When you go off somebody gets hurt
(at his wit's end) All right
Let's do this
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and 'm gonna have his love child
Will you shut up
You gonna pay for that, Mister
Toby and Bobby square off, sizing each other up and preparing for a violent confrontation
Just as the two are about to clash we hear the voice of   from
(
) Toby
The two men freeze in their tracks, as Potter drives up fast
Hey, Sheriff Potter
(tough) Toby,  just came from your mother's place
She's worried sick about you
She says she ain't seen you since this morning
That ain't true, Sheriff
was home for lunch
Boy, 'm not trying to hear nothing from you except that you're heading home
Now run along
Yes, sir
Come on, Jenny
want to stay
said come on
Toby grabs Jenny by the wrist and literally pulls he along
As she goes she yells back to Bobby
Bye, Mister
Don't go nowhere without me
wanna have your love child
Toby points a vicious finger at Bobby
Next time, Mister
Next time
Toby and Jenny exit leaving Bobby and the Sheriff alone
Bobby would also like to exit fast
Where ya goin'
Harlin's
Get in
Bobby has no choice
He gets in
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today
You're not planning on staying are you
No, sir
'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about
That's a nasty cut you got there
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock
Not as bad as it looks
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit
Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers
Sounds like it
wish  could help Sheriff, but  just want to get my car and get on up the road
drives up in his
His windows whirr down
Everything all right, Virgil
He eyes Bobby
(a little nervous) Just fine, Jake
Where you going
was just up at Darrell's
How's the wife
That little eskimo baby walkin' yet
Oh just fine
You haven't seen Grace around, have you
'm looking for her
No
But if  do, 'll tell her you're looking for her, Jake
(looking at Bobby) Whatcha got there, some trash
He drives off
The Sheriff drives on
Peculiar, how things happen
man's car breaks down
There's a hold up
People die and all that money -- and now old Jake out looking for his young wife
And then you show up
The Sheriff looks right through Bobby, who knows this is more than a conversation
He pulls up to Harlin's garage
Bobby gets out
Time's running out, son
'll be seeing you in the morning
With this thinly veiled threat, the Sheriff drives on
As Bobby watches, feeling the pressure to get out now while he can
'  - is cleaning his tools
Bobby's  sits prominently in the car bay, washed and gleaming, as  walks up
Hey there
was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back
You don't look so good
Yeah, well, 've been around the bend a bit
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started
You've been there
Hell, 've had days  would gladly trade with a whippin' dog
Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out
You believe that
You think bad, and bad is what you get
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell
No charge
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as  get where 'm going  swear 'll-- Two-hundred
What
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty
Yep
For the hose
But while you was gone replaced a gasket
That's going to run you another fifty
didn't tell you to replace any gasket
Yeah, but it was shot
don't give a fuck
didn't tell you to do it
You can't just do unauthorized work
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you
Didn't you read the sign
What sign
The goddamn sign on the wall
can't do unauthorized work
What am  suppose to do
Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket
Then you get in an accident and get killed
Or worse
Who they gonna blame then
They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation
What reputation
You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick
Is that an insult
Are you insulting me
Listen you stupid fuck,  want my car
Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch
You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until  get it
And if you take another five hours 'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it
Is that clear
Now get out of here 'fore  call the Sheriff, who knows me Bobby is in a rage
He turns to leave and walks a few paces
He sees a  lying on a table
For a second his mind reels, then he snatches up the wrench and turns ready to smash it down on Darrell's head
He stops cold
Because ol' Darrell holds a in a batter's stance ready to smash it onto the Mustang
You want to play, Mister
'll play with you
You want to smash something
So do Darrell pulls back the crowbar, ready to swing
No
Okay
Okay
What's the matter
The fight gone out of you
'm just gonna smash a headlight
Maybe two
(pleading, almost crying) Please, just leave the car alone
Mister, you already pissed me off but good
Darrell lays the tip of the crowbar on the hood of the car, and drags the tip of the bar across the hood leaving a long scratch
(about to lose it) Goddamn you
You son of a bitch
There you go, sweet talking me again
Darrell begins to laugh
Bobby, desperate, looks to the trunk, thinking of his gun in there
His  -- the trunk
of the  goes through his mind
Look, Harlin
Darrell
Darrell
'll get you your money
just have to get something out of the trunk
Using his  , he tries to open it but realizes the lock has been changed
What the fuck did you do to my trunk
Well, that key's not gonna work
had to pop the lock
You didn't leave me the trunk key
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you
When  work on a car,  work on a car
(snaps) You motherfucker
(etc
) You can't help yourself, can you mister
You're out of control
Darrell starts to laugh
It is a repetitive, almost demonic laugh that grows louder as the camera slowly dollies in on Bobby's anguished face
- As  steps out into the glaring sun, he notices down at the other end of the town, '  parked right outside the ' , empty
Presently,  and the  walk out , and she gets in, says a few last words and drives away
Bobby backs around a corner into a sidestreet
Is she selling him out
He's very confused, turbulent
- enters the
The interior is poorly lit
There are a few benches for people to wait on, but they sit empty
Old, faded travel posters hang on the wall
bored is behind the counter
need a ticket
Where to
Out of here
But, in particular
Mexico
You got a bus that goes to Mexico
That's where  have to go
Mexico is a large country
Where in Mexico would you like-- don't care, just get me there
The clerk is a little put off by Bobby
He seems delirious
She goes through her schedule looking for a bus
How about Ciudad Juarez
You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque
It'll get you across the border
How much
One way, or round trip
One way
30
55
Twenty more will get you back
Bobby counts his money
Twenty-seven, fifty
That's all  got
The ticket is 30
55
(rifling his pockets) bought a beer
That was a dollar something
Then  gave that girl 25 cents for the juke box
And the blind man
the soda
'd have 30 if
if
'm sorry, sir
It's $30
55 for the ticket
(to himself) Yeah
Just a little short
Figures just wanted to get out, that's all
Bobby starts to walk away
Suddenly he turns, runs back at the clerk, proffers his money, half-crazed, near tears
Please, ma'am, you don't understand have to get out of here
They're going to come looking for me
They're going to kill me If  can't get this ticket then 'm going to have to do things to get out of here
You know what  mean don't want to hurt anybody,  just want to leave
Please can't
can't
He's so desperate and in her frightened but neutral expression, Bobby experiences the only compassion he ever finds in this whole town
Okay, 'll give you the ticket, sir, but
just
just, please calm down, please
her sane tone reminds Bobby of how far down he's come
He shrinks, suddenly ashamed of himself
She takes the cash on the counter, hands him a ticket
Keep your change
Bus three-twenty-three
Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight
'm sorry
It's just
you know
She nods, puts a "closed" sign in the ticket window, disappears
- We hear the crackle of the same   again,  , as  walks out of the depot
ticket preciously held in his hand, and suddenly reels as he sees , about a 100 yards down the main stretch, slowly rolling into town in his convertible, looking for guess who
Holy shit
'  - turns away, but not fast enough
spots him, hits the pedal
Got you, shitface
Bobby Cooper
Bobby Cooper
- , ducking around a corner, hears the brief "Whoop" of the sheriff's
He glances back
His  - sure enough, the ' having a field day
He's just pulled  over
At this distance, we catch snippets of conversation as the Sheriff ambles from his car, checking Sergei's out-of-state plates
Where's the fire sweetheart
Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state
Vat
am going 5 miles an hour
am looking town
not even moving
We pop in closer to their conversation -- Bobby relishing this in his mind's eye
Sergei is constantly looking off to where he last saw Bobby
But the Sheriff, strangely, pays no attention to these looks
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there
You one of them Russians
am Russian, da
am also rich Russian, da
Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff
What
You trying to bribe me, mister
Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything
Down the street, Sheriff Potter is holding up a concealed
What's that
(He grabs the gun) "concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan
You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot
You call yourself a police
Sergei looking Bobby's direction
Get out of the car, spread them
You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to shut the fuck up You commie motherfucker
Either way you're goin' to the can
want my lawyer
Sheriff cuffs Sergei and sticks him in the police car
Bobby can't help smiling as he turns away to the seen in an earlier scene
He comes up with the change the bus clerk left him and, dying for a drink in this heat, inserts the coin
Though still under considerable pressure from all sides, this lucky break with Sergei seems like it might be the beginning of something new today -- some luck
The icy cold soda bottle shoots out
Bobby raises it to his lips, about to taste it, about to relax for once
Violently it explodes out of his hands as he doubles over in blinding pain from a
He stumbles forward into the soda machine, gasping
The legs of his assailant are close to him, but the face is unseen
Bobby doubles his agony as his bandaged left stump takes the brunt of the blow into the machine, re-opening the wound
Blood starts to seep through the bandage
Ow
Bobby crumples to the ground as  now towers over him with his fists curled and a snarl on his lips
Get up, Mister
Don't ever let it be said Toby Tucker beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance
(gasping) What the hell are you doing
You fucking psycho
'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended
'm stompin' your ass
You idiot
You don't even know what you're fighting over
My honor, that's what 'm fighting over
Now get up off the ground, or do  have to whoop you where you lie
comes running up the street
Toby
Toby Tucker, leave him alone
You stay away, Jenny
aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see
Jenny runs to Bobby and cuddles him where he lays
Don't be afraid of him none
don't care what he does to you, we can still be together
Get away from me
Bobby sees his bus ticket on the ground
He grabs for it, but Toby beats him to it
Now, what's this
Give it to me
Mexico
You going to Mexico
'm leaving
You never have to see me again
Just please, give me the ticket
This means something to you
Jenny means something to me
Toby sticks the ticket in his mouth and chews it up whole
Nooo
(between bites) 'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the erst of your days
Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when 'm done
'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick
'm gonna
Toby's words drift to Bobby from a million miles away
The world around him is like a dream, or a nightmare
primal rage wells inside of Bobby that rises up in a howl as he swings the soda bottle up out of nowhere across Toby's head, smashing him backwards
Then he lands blow after blow with his right hand on the boy's face and head
Jenny screams: Stop it
You're killing him
Jenny grabs Bobby's arm, literally hanging all her weight on it, stopping him from striking Toby again
You're killing him
Toby
Toby
Jenny sinks to the ground and cuddles Toby
Bobby stands
He looks at Toby, then at his bloodied knuckles in disbelief
His bandage is soaked with his own blood, but his adrenaline numbs the pain
You killed him
You killed him
She wails in the background as he backs away, around the corner, into Main Street, crossing to where the   is
- is on the phone
Hello, Grace
It's Bobby
: - , in the kitchen, is also on the phone
(coolly) thought you'd be on your way to Vegas by now
Is there something you wanted
wanted to talk
(
) don't think we have anything to talk about
What about us
There is no us, remember
Except  can't get you out of my head, Grace
(beat) Stop it
(
) Why
Am  making you hot, or does the truth scare you
Because  know you're full of shit
mean it, Grace
'm getting out of here, and  want to take you with me
(
) thought you couldn't get your car
could if  had Jake's money
(
) Is that what changed your mind
The money
don't give a damn about the money want you, and  want to get us out of this shithole
There's only one way to do that
Pause
Are you sure
About me,  mean
came back for you; this morning  came back
Before  even knew about the money
You're what  want
(then) The only reason  stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake
But 've had nothing but time to think about it
It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here
But we've got to get the money, baby
We get the money,  get the car, then we get the hell out
You said you couldn't kill anybody
We don't have to kill him
Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away
(beat) It was your idea, remember
'm doing this for you
'm doing this so you can fly
fly like a bird
Grace bites at a nail and fidgets, but says nothing
(
) Grace
Grace
After dark
'll leave the back door unlocked
She quickly hangs up the phone
Bobby also hangs up the phone, an unreadable expression on his face
- sits in an easy chair reading a paper
Puffs of smoke from his pipe rise from behind the paper and hang like a cloud over his head
stands in the doorway, body stiff and arms crossed, staring at him
Who was that on the phone
Wrong number
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number
But then you make friends so easily
Don't you, Grace
Grace has no answer for that, so she says nothing
long moment passes, then: put up new drapes, Jake
know
was here when your apprentice was helping you
Remember
You never said anything
About the drapes
They look nice
You haven't even looked at them once
Jake lowers the paper, looks at the drapes
They look nice
picked them out for you, Jake
thought you would like the colors
(softly, admiring) You look just like your mama when you move like that against the light
Grace stares at the  now visible around Jake's neck that disappears under his shirt
She knows that hidden there is a key, and she fixes on it intently
What the hell you looking at, girl
Nothing, Jake
Absolutely nothing
- The  is setting
It strikes the horizon sending a ripple of golden light through the sky
- dances in the evening light with a small child in his arms
- and  huddle together in sleep
- is tossing horseshoes with his
- watches the sun going down outside her house, cradling herself in her arms
desert wind gently caresses her
- The  , along with his dead , sits on the side of the street
Well, that's it
Sun's going down
People go home, trade stories over dinner
They'll talk about the day, about the heat, laugh about something crazy it made them do
They'll kiss, sleep a few hours, then do it all over again
now appears next to the blind man holding two Dr
Peppers
He hands one to the blind man, takes a sip of the other one, and offers him his own change
The day wasn't so bad
We all got through it all right
(giving back the change) Keep it
There's a suggestion of cockiness in Bobby, feeling his luck coming back with the night
His humour is enhanced by his down the street: As , with his dilapidated truck, readies ' convertible for towing
() Ain't over yet
Night is part of day; separate, but equal
Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark
Difference between you and me, old man, is see the glass half full, you see it half empty
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'
It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of
You afraid of the dark
Afraid of it
Boy,  live in the dark
All cause of a woman who made me this way
People are afraid of what they can't see
can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me
Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death (he makes a strange sound)
It's all the same to me
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride
Is that it
More or less
Not this twig, friend
got plans
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans
We all got plans planned on seeing all my life
know you didn't plan on straying into town
No and  don't plan on sticking around either
Well, don't say  didn't warn you when things go your way
You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap
One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint
Now it's a woman
'm hep to you
The Blind Man slowly lifts his glasses, showing his  at last
Where his eyes should be are scars and dead flesh
An ugly sight that even takes Bobby back a step
Used to be a young smartass like you
Then got smart with the wrong man's daughter
Got some acid poured on my peepers for my trouble
You know human beings ain't always just human -- they got animals living inside 'em too
People give spare change to war heroes not fools
All fools get is pity
May not have eyes, but  see
And you, boy
The Blind Man puts his glasses back on
You got my pity
(doesn't believe him) Hope she was worth it
Oh, she was worth it
She was worth every black minute since
Bobby looks at his watch, gets ready to go, drops a coin into the Blind Man's cup
Time's up
Any last words of wisdom
Things ain't always the way they seem
You got to ask yourself: is it worth it
Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart
Then you better know what it is you're doing
Are you a human being -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around
Bobby walks away, smiling
You are crazy, you know
Be seeing you, old man
You know  won't be seeing you
The Blind Man lifts his sunglasses and peers into the cup as if he sees We don't really know
He reaches into the cup and pulls out the coin Bobby tossed in
Cheap bastard
Gives me back my own money
Well, Jesse, time's up, let's go for a walk
The Blind Man now stands up and pulls the seeing-eye dog's harness
The  struggles to its feet and they walk off down the street together
- stands by the back door staring at the bolt lock yells to her from another room
(
) What the hell you doin', Grace
Are you coming to bed, or aren't you
For a moment Grace's hand wavers above the lock
Suddenly, like a snake striking, her hand shoots out and unlocks the bolt
Just as quickly she turns from the door and heads to the bedroom
-   - is on in the bedroom window
After a moment it dims and the house is dark, silhouetted against the horizon by moonlight
steps into frame, carrying an iron pipe
/ - We start close on  -- a  slapping against her buttocks as bedsprings groan
We reveal Grace copulating on all fours with  from behind
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you
You like it this way -- rough and hard
Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best
Yes, yes, hit me
beat me, please
You been a bad girl, Grace
You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya
You betrayed her
Like you did me
There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl
Oh no
Oh please forgive me, Papa
You broke her heart
You broke your Mama's heart
You stole me
That's right
Fuck it away
But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone
No
No
Please
He hits her
Harder
In a strange flashback of his mind, he now sees Grace's beneath him, receiving his punishment
He stops, abruptly
He can't go on
Fear coming into his eyes
He starts to whimper, begging for his punishment and/or forgiveness
Oh baby, 'm so sorry
'm so sorry
(he starts to cry) didn't mean to hurt you so bad
It just
got away
He drops down, burying his face between Grace's legs
Forgive me, baby, forgive me
He hides there from the world that he has created, crying to himself
Grace has an unreadable expression, but that's certainly not a new occurrence in their strange relationship
/ - The knob of the backdoor twists and the door opens
slips quickly through the space and into the house quietly closing the door behind him
It is nearly pitch dark, and he has no bearings
He steps gingerly through the hall, but in the darkness he bumps into a table nearly knocking over a lamp only to catch it just before it crashes into the floor
/ - hears the noise
He raises his head and cocks an ear to the air
She knows who it is, and is concerned; he's too early
What's the matter
You didn't hear something
Yeah,  heard a key slapping against my ass
There's someone in the house
(nervous) Maybe
maybe the wind blew something over (encouraging him to continue)
Come on baby, keep going
Jake climbs out of bed, throwing on some pants, reaching into a drawer in the chest of clothes, pulling out a small dark metallic
(realizing) What's that
Jake -- where's you get that
Relax baby
Stay here
He goes to the door
She follows, tries to block the door
Jake, don't go out there
Call the sheriff
Shhhh
Just like your Mama, always scared of things
He maneuvers her aside and slips out the door into the corridor
/  - Crowbar in one hand,  makes his way slowly through the living room, banging against the edge of a table
He hops silently in pain, then waits at the door to the next room and listens
Hearing nothing he slowly pokes his head into the darkness
moment later Bobby backs from the door and we see the barrel of his own black
9mm  pressed against his forehead
appears now, backing him into the living room
He switches on a
Well, well
As  live and breathe didn't expect to be seeing the like of you again
Thought you'd be long on your way by now
Jake continues to press the gun to Bobby's head
That's my gun
(then) That fucking Darrell
like Darrell
He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother
We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out
(realizing) You been workin' me the whole time
guess this is what they call "ironee"
Hunh
It's not what you think, Jake
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and 'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car
And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it
Wait a minute
Just listen to me
And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper
and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000
(very serious) That's not the reason 'm here, Jake
There's another reason
It better be good
- makes her way down the hall in a nightgown, and now hides in shadow, listening
(
) came for Grace
(
) You came to take my wife from me
- (sincere) No
came to kill her
' eyes get real narrow and angry
(
) Shhh
Liar
(
) It's the truth, Jake
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon
Maybe  don't like being played, like she played us today
Maybe  don't like that at all, Jake
'm just pissed enough, maybe 'll rip the neck off my own grandmother
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk
Damn it, Jake
There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then  pick Grace
You were going to give me thirteen-thousand
Give me two-hundred
'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it
She showed me the perfect place
There won't be enough left for an autopsy
But  need the the money
've got to have the money
Jake is silent
He takes his time thinking
Finally: She's in the bedroom
, distressed, starts backing off towards the bedroom
stares at the automatic in 's hand
Wanna give me my gun
Jake laughs, a "don't even think about it" look
strangling'll do just fine
Go to work
Bobby holds up his eight fingers with a "you try" look
Jake shrugs
Bobby points to the crowbar on the carpet
How 'bout the pipe
(sarcastic) She's got a slender neck
Bobby turns and walks towards the bedroom
Jake follows into an adjoining room
Hold on a second
Come here
Bobby turns to Jake, who is suddenly extremely upset
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at
What are you talking about
(getting closer) This morning when  came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't been near the bedroom
Now you make straight for it
returns to listen
This thing is like a seesaw battle of wills
(
) Come on, Jake -- (
) Don't Jake me boy
It's a big house
You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon
has come right up on  in a rage
Or did you just ply the afternoon away between my sheets putting your lips all over her, you little horndog
(changing tactics) What difference does it make if  slept with her
We're gonna kill her
You're right
don't give a damn about her
But killing her's one thing
Fucking her behind my back, that's another
Suddenly Jake swings his arm, clipping Bobby across the side of the head with the pistol and opening another bloody gash
Bobby crumbles to his knees, crying out
Jake suddenly grabs Bobby by the hair, forcing his face back and smearing his lips with his own in a vengeful kiss
The blood from Bobby's wound runs down to his lips and mixes with Jake's lips
Now you've tasted both of us
He pulls back the hammer on the gun and levels it at Bobby's head
Bobby sees it coming, plays his last card on his knees
admit it
fucked her
But it's her you have to worry about, not me She wants you dead , Jake
She wants you dead and she wants your money
(hesitates) What are you babbling about
(talking fast) Think about it
How do you think  got in here
Did you hear any glass break
Did you hear a door splinter
- listening
(
) How did the evening end
After you went to bed did she linger a bit
Maybe just long enough to leave the door unlocked
Is that what happened
- Like an old rag,  gradually soaks all this up becoming heavier with the weight of the knowledge
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake
You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior
What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead
Let me kill her
All  want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with
Two-hundred dollars
Two-hundred dollars
'll do it
'll kill her
beat
Jake stares down at Bobby on the floor
Sweet Christ, 'd be doing the world a favor, ridding it of the likes of you
Get your miserable ass off the floor
You're positively pathetic
Go on, go kill Grace
Bobby slowly stands
'm not letting you walk for nothing
Two hundred dollars
Do it, boy
Kill her Bobby goes
- bolts back to the bedroom, the camera following her as she flies
-  ( ) walks it
His  -- the door
Every step seems freighted
- is in a quandary
How many seconds before Bobby walks in to kill her
Or can he really kill her
She's not sure
She looks around the room frantically
Picks up a lamp, puts it down
She looks quickly through her closet, rummages below in the boxes
Suddenly she finds it
dangerous looking Indian  with a feather hanging off its bindings
It's a formidable piece of iron, quite capable of splitting a skull or impaling flesh
Grace hears the footsteps just outside the door
She runs behind the door
moment later, the bedroom door creaks open and  quietly enters, approaching the bed
We sense the doubt in his eyes as to whether he can kill her
In a reverse , Bobby sees the outline of Grace in the bed as victim
closer, closer
He now lifts the edge of the bedcover but sees a blanket bunched up to resemble a human figure
He suddenly hears a foot fall behind him, then he feels her presence
He spins
She's directly behind him , hatchet raised
His life is in her hands
His eyes, locked in an eternal moment
Her eyes, the hatchet
: - As , anxiously torn, waits, there is a  , followed by  of struggle, of murder, of death
Then
Jake
It is a desperate cry for help
Jake can't help himself
He breaks into a roaring run down the hall to save his beloved
Grace
- bulls into the bedroom
It's a mess, furniture overturned, sheets and blankets all over the floor
The lights broken
Waiting for him, face down on the floor, is '  in a pool of liquid
broken bottle lies nearby
Bobby's body heaves in its final death throes, and then shudders quiet
Over there, by the bed, is , who still clutches the
The look on her face is pure shock
Well
looks like you got him, Grace
That's good
that's real good
He must of slipped past me, but you got him
Looks like that drifter from this morning
Got to be careful who you make friends with, sweetheart
Jake eyes the weapon in Grace's hand
Why don't you put that down
It's all over now
Put it down
Grace eyes the gun in Jake's hand
Go on, girl
Put it down
What choice does Grace have
She lets the hatchet clank to the floor
Aww, that's my Grace:  Not about to let someone get the best of her
That's what love about you
As dangerous as you are unpredictable
behind Jake, the lifeless  rises up from the floor, very much alive, and clobbers Jake with a golf club
Jake is staggered, but he's one tough old customer as he manages to spin slowly, gun still in one hand, as if to fire
Before he can, Grace grabs up the hatchet from the floor and drives it straight into his back
He gurgles, stunned from both sides, but it's like trying to kill Rasputin
He still has the gun as Bobby jumps him from the rear, trying to get his neck in a chokehold
The gun  once, discharging into the wall
The hatchet is ripped from his back
Grace watches as the two men bang into the walls in a rugged rodeo-type fight, Jake seeking to dislodge Bobby off his back
An expression of fear and excitement in her eyes
Finally the two men go crashing to the ground, rolling around, Bobby maintaining his stranglehold, but calling to her, his hands full
Grace, goddamit, do something
Jake's eyes rolls up at her like a beaching whale, pleading for help
Grace
She commits
Jumping into the fray, it's not clear whose side she's really on as the three of them roll across the floor, strangling, biting, hitting, spitting, scratching, gasping
It's a Guignol, but the pressure from Bobby's forearm is taking its toll on Jake
Trying to bite Jake, Grace bites Bobby instead, but then she scratches Jake's face
Jake is grabbing her hard as Bobby chokes him, trying to use her to leverage himself away
But she manages to rip herself from his grip and scrambles on her knees across the floor
She grabs the hatchet
And stands, moving back towards the two men locked on the floor
Bobby looks up at her, hatchet in hand, no longer sure which way she'll go
Jake, however, gasping for air, eyes bulging, spittle dripping from his mouth, looks at Grace with some inner certainty that she will help him
He gasps the words
Help me, Grace, help
Like you helped her, Jake
Grace stands there, deciding, the power of the hatchet in her hands
She raises it suddenly over the two men
It flashes downwards
Deep into the gut of her husband Jake, almost transfixing him to the floor
In the silence that follows, Jake's eyes roll up to meet hers
But all she has for him is a cold, distant stare
Jake's head drops as the life rushes out of him
Bobby falls back from the body puffing and dripping with sweat
What the hell'd you wait for
She doesn't answer, turbulence in her face
He rolls Jake's body off, upset
She may have made it a murder, but he was part of it, and he feels the shift in himself
They're both in new territory, feeling an apartness between them
Suddenly gasps , still alive
It is too much for Bobby
He grabs the hatchet and plunges it down on Jake, silencing him one last time
Grace is pushing the bed away from the wall, slipping down on her knees and prying open several floorboards
The money's right here
Get the key
No
You get it
He doesn't want to get close to Jake
Grace coldly runs over to his corpse, ripping the chain, key and all, from the neck
The action pulls Jake's head up, then she lets it thump back on the floor
She runs back to the floorboards
The top of a thick steel floor safe is revealed
Bobby watches -- his whole life, it seems, hanging on the outcome
With the key, she opens the safe
Inside are rolled-up bundles of cash -- in hundred dollar denominations
She looks up at him, offering it as she reaches in for more
Bobby also gets down on his hands and knees and grabs more and more, sucked into the fever of freedom, far more money than he lost at the grocery store, overcome now with emotions of fear and freedom
They see each other
Didn't  tell you
(plunging into the cash) There must be 150, 200 thousand here
Goddamnit Grace, you were right
We done it, Bobby
Oh my God
They laugh excitedly and start kissing, rolling in the stacks of cash, some of which sticks to Bobby's sweating back
The day didn't turn out so bad after all for Bobby
Fuck me baby
(looking at Jake) What about him
Let him watch
want him to know what he's missing
As they consummate their violent relationship for the first time, Jake's lifeless eyes watch them
- The  in the bedroom window is low candlelight, but we sense something watching them
's silhouette moves across a window
now comes out of the house, cautious, walking down the driveway
He stops, thinks, and walks back to open the hood of '
He reaches into the  and disconnects something, then closes the hood and walks on
'  - walks up to the  near the garage and bangs on the door
light goes on in the window
shouts out
(
) What you want
Open up
(
) We're closed
Come back when the sun comes up
Bobby, in a hurry to get back should Grace pull any tricks, bangs and kicks against the door
Darrell yanks the door wide
What the hell
oh, it's you
Might've figgered
Listen  got a waitress coming over
What do you want
want my car
You got the money
Bobby pulls the money from his hip pocket and hands it to Darrell
The mechanic fingers it suspiciously
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills
And this morning you was broke
That's none of your business
Get the keys
don't want no dirty money
run an honest business
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day
Get the keys
(pause) Well, there's a $50 overnight storage charge we got to talk about
Bobby is ready at first to explode, but then just laughs out loud
You got to give it to a guy like Darrell
He holds up a $100 bill
All  got's a hundred, Darrell
You got change
No
Figgers
There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun
Deduct it
Bobby pulls the hundred back from Darrell's grasp
(going to get the keys) Don't know nothing about no gun
Course you don't
Tell me something Darrell
Forty thousand people die every day
How come none of them are you
(throws him the keys) think you know where to find her
And the trunk key
(pulls out the trunk key) Topped off the tank for you
No charge
Just my way of doing business
(jovial, confident now) Listen up good, Darrell
'm getting outta this shithole
You're staying
And one little peep outta you -- remember that gun makes you part of the food chain
Your prints are all over it
'd be awful careful whose rectum  was pointing my finger in, Darrell
Bobby hops in the car, a free man
As Darrell glares at him, bewildered and frightened at the same time
- turns the  up the drive
cut the darkness and land on an empty patch where Grace's jeep had been parked
Bobby jumps from the Mustang and runs around frantically
His look is devastated
He falls to his knees, about to sob when: opens the front door and pokes her head out, putting out several suitcases
Bobby
What the hell's the matter with you
nothing
just stubbed my toe on a rock
Hurt like hell
got the money all packed
put the jeep and his caddy in the garage
People'll think maybe me and Jake went away
Buy us some time
know a back road we can take
Good thinking
(looking at her four bags) What's all this
'm not coming back
(accepting) Awright, let's go
want to be fifty miles from here before the sun comes up
Funny thing; the jeep wouldn't start
had to push it
(dryly) Funny thing
'll get the bags
- Bobby's  is backed towards the front of the house
We see a silhouette of  and  carrying something wrapped in a  and dumping it in the trunk
- lone pair of  illuminate the night as the Mustang cruises through the dark
As the lights brighten the screen we: : /
- sits next to  peering out the windshield, clutching the money in a backpack
She's humming an Indian song
can't see it
It should be just up ahead
Hold on
there
There it is
illuminated by the
It reads: Grace lets out a scream of joy, leans over and hugs him
Oh, God
can't believe it
'm out
'm finally out
The  begins to swerve along the road
Hey
Take it easy
Want to get us killed
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place
don't know about that
You spent a day in Superior
wasted my entire life there
feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of
Can't we just dump him fast someplace
want a place where only the vultures will find him
(then) It'll be over soon, Grace
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you
'm not sailing his boat
But  thought -- We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go
Anywhere
What the hell
Why not
Where should we go
Hawaii
've read all about it
've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet
Oh, God
'd kill to go there
You already have
She gives him a funny look
You know  thought you'd left me back there
What are you talking about
(emotional) When  got back from the garage, and your jeep wasn't there,  thought you'd gone and left me and taken the money
(off her look) Cause  never had any luck with women, Grace
You don't know what  been through
The shit 've taken
thought you were like the rest of 'em
but when you came out of the house
well you're here Grace and we might be starting in the shit but we're starting where  never been -- together with someone -- together with you Grace
She responds with a luminous smile
love you Bobby
He looks back at her with trust and love in his eyes
We're gonna pull this off, Grace
Just then a  rakes them from the rear as we hear, again, the ominous crackle of a   and the short brutal "Whoop" of the siren, as Sheriff Potter's  rolls up quickly behind them
Grace's face is caught like a surprised deer in the headlamps
Oh, my God
(then) Don't stop
Bobby is in a bind
The siren whoops again
The lights flash to highbeam
He must've seen us swerving on the road, that's all, just gonna give us a ticket for swerving
But even Bobby has trouble believing that as the pulls out sharply alongside his and   motions to him aggressively to pull over on the shoulder
(into loudspeaker) Pull over, goddamnit, pull over
Keep going
She seems to be panicking
Bobby pulls over
Fuck this
Just shut up, Grace
We done nothing
Be cool
Let me do the talking
He doesn't know anything
His vehicle pulled up on the shoulder in front of them, the Sheriff gets out, shining his power flashlight into their faces
(starts) 'Evening Sheriff, sorry bout that but this jackrabbit
Bobby has no time to react as the Sheriff is suddenly there at his window, jerking his door open, angry
in his hand, pointed at them, his eyes on Grace
You had to fuck him , didn't you
(nervous cool) would never do that to you, baby
He killed Jake -- said he'd kill me if didn't come with him
All he wants is the money
Bobby looks at her
He cannot believe what he just heard
What
(flipping, yelling) Don't lie to me Grace knows the jam is up
but he never made me cum
Really Virgil,  was only doing what  had to do so we could be free
Just like we talked about
It meant nothing pause
Virgil wants to kill her, but he also wants her back badly
You fucking him too Grace
Is everybody fucking everybody in this town
She ignores him
Her attention on the backpack with the money between her legs -- the gun is there, inside an outer flap of the bag
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me
No baby, you got it wrong
This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me
His flashlight on the four suitcases in the backseat
She doesn't have an answer to that one
It's not like that it
Look, Virgil, got the money here
She gets out of the car on her side, comes around to him, the pack of money slung on her shoulder, hard to see in the dark
(hurt) Oh Grace, you can say what you want
but, watched you fuck that pervert for years while you're telling me you loved me
What happened to going to Milwaukee together
You and me -- gonna open up the finest sporting goods store that city ever did see
Get us a place on the north shore, by the lake
Season Brewer tickets
Just you and me, Grace
What happened
All talk, that's all you did was talk, and all  did was sit around getting older waiting for you to free me
You never did nothin' Virgil, you're weak
(pointing to Bobby) He did The Sheriff, deeply wounded, casts a hot vicious gaze on Bobby
This is some girl you and me got here Bobby, yessir, an excellent cocksuck too, wouldn't you say
(back at Grace)
Course you had a lotta practice haven't you darling, going way back to your crazy mama
(deadly) Shut up, Virgil
Take your share of the money
It's not so bad
don't want the fuckin' money
'm not gonna give up everything  got for a lousy 50,000 dollars
It's you You Grace or nothing
The whole thing
want you to be my wife
(hopeful)
What do you way Grace
You sound just like Jake
did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it
Go back to your family
They love you
Bobby gets out of the car, misunderstanding the situation
(misunderstanding) Look, we got more
We got $200,000 at least
Split it three ways, we all walk away
The Sheriff snaps and smashes Bobby with his flashlight, knocking him to the ground, kicking him again and again, gathering the psychic force to murder him
Grace tries to approach
Shut up, boy
You don't know shit round here
(to Grace) Get back
Did she tell you that story about the bird flying away
(rolling on the ground) Ow
Look,
ow
Stop
Stop it
(kicking again and again) Were you going to help her fly away, asshole
What'd you think, you were the first boy to drift through this town she came on to
She tell you the story about old Jake forcing her to marry him
That's a good story
How he killed her crazy Mama
Bobby in bloody agony
Grace stunned that Virgil would reveal this now publicly
Goddamnit Virgil, stop
Don't
But  bet the story she didn't tell you was the best story of all
How old crazy Jake was really her Papa And she liked fucking Papa
And now she's killed the sonufabitch
Just like she's gonna kill you
Grace plunges into the pack, pulls the gun and shoots Virgil across the car in the gut
No
you
You
The Sheriff flies back onto the road, stunned, not realizing what's happened
Bobby watches unbelieving as Grace quietly steps up over the Sheriff
She puts the next round in his nuts, a modern fury enacting ancient wrath
Grace
No
The Sheriff is wide-eyed, dying in shock
Grace then fires right at his head in a coup de grace that blows his brains out the back of his head
Grace and Bobby both stare, then Grace jumps into action, dragging the body
She snaps to Bobby
Help me get him off the road
Into the car
We'll ditch his car
Get the fuck up
Bobby stares at her
/
- They're driving
and , wordless, each thinking in separate worlds
Grace wipes her hands
The bag with the money between her legs
The Baretta is back in the bag
(finally) Jesus, did you have to kill him
Get real Bobby
He was gonna kill you and me
He was in love with you Grace
He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life
no thanks
He was a cop , Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop
He was a scumbag
He wanted me , Bobby
These guys don't let go
Even when they're dead (softer) You don't know what it was like, Bobby
Those two, they were the same
silence
The oncoming road
So, aren't you going to ask me
Ask you what
You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next
Don't you want to know
bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now
Let it go, baby
It's the past
got a past
Don't you really want to know
Was Jake my Daddy
Was  fucking my own Daddy
Don't you want to know that
(shouting) What do you want me to say
She's yelling, emotionally out of control
Yes
was
was fucking Daddy
And married him
married him
okay
She looks at Bobby, forces him to look at her
Finally: Why
don't know why She drops back in her seat
Tears come
All  wanted was to be a kid
He took that from me
They all did
(very quietly, dangerously) They treated me like meat
piece of meat
Fuck me Blow me Bend over Stick their fingers up my ass Fuck them
Fuck the whole town
They deserved to die
pause
And us Grace
What do we deserve
(crying quietly to herself) "Nin chonk, nin chonk," my Mama used to say in Apache
"Your worst is doing this to you," she said, "your worst has killed you
" And "Be go tsee" -- "you will find out the result of what you have done
" Just when you think it's over, when you've gotten away, it begins
Cause you never get away
Bobby stares straight ahead at the oncoming road
Can he still love her
She seems to be reading his thoughts, like she said she could
It's easy to judge someone else when you don't know nothing about it
'm Apache, Bobby
You don't eat what  eat
You don't see what  see
Don't judge me
silence
Two former lovers in the dark of a car moving through the strangeness of an Arizona desert at night
don't want to think anymore
(quietly) Then drive
The lights of the car fade until there is nothing but darkness
: -   - In the vast reaches of a deserted canyon, where  circle in a hot white sky, we find the  parked at the edge of a drop
We hear the  of a body being dragged
(
) Nobody's sure where it was heading so fast but the way it hit the semi, it won't be getting home now
Hey area weather is gonna be hot
Hot
Hot
Then cold
Cold
Cold
Just like yesterday
Just like every day
Some surprise, huh
So if you're planning on anything, don't You don't like the weather, just wait one minute
Got any brains, get up to Alaska and get yourself some trailer park where you don't see no desert for miles and miles
(over) Right there
Drop it there
got it
is giving  instructions as they drop ' corpse over a drop onto some rocks 30 yards below
See ya, Virgil
God bless
Bobby pushes him over, his hand hurting
The body crashes below
It's hard work
They head back for the Mustang, to retrieve ' body in the popped trunk
But Grace notices Bobby glancing at the Baretta now tucked in her waist
The silence is tense between them, the rocks and gravel crunching under their shoes as they walk
(indicates the gun) Is this what's bothering you Bobby
No Grace, my hand's bothering me
You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and  don't need you anymore, and  might just sneak up behind you sometime and
pop
She pulls an imaginary trigger on Bobby, mimicking the recoil of a gun
Bobby is nervous
Don't you think  would've done it if  wanted to
What can  do to make you relax, baby
You could give me my gun back
Grace smiles
Why don't we just finish what we started
She stares down at Jake
She can't help feeling some old feelings
As Bobby walks back to the front of the car, turns off the annoying radio
He watches as she softly prays over Jake, whose face is concealed by the blanket in which he is rolled
(after a moment with Jake) What do you think happens to someone's spirit when they die
think nothing happens
You're dead meat
That's it
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby
believe in this moment, that's all
There is nothing else
(lifting Jake by the shoulder) Come on
He must weigh 300 pounds
Grace leans into the trunk to take his boots when he makes his move, quickly, closing on her when she's off guard
He slams her hard in the face, coldly sending her sprawling to the ground, dazed
He steps over her and grabs the gun in her waist, checks it
She puts her hand to her mouth, feels the blood on her finger tips
She looks at him and laughs a wild crazed laugh that cuts into Bobby like a knife
You hit me, Bobby
You hit a woman, you motherfucker
Didn't your Momma ever teach you anything
Her eyes go to the gun in his hand and she stops laughing
Her calm is extraordinary, as if expecting to die
Well
For a moment, Bobby does nothing, then he slips the gun through his belt
Well, nothing
We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own
Don't leave me
want to say with you, Bobby
Why
So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again
was just baiting him
Bobby,  had to tell him that to get his guard down
Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me
You lied to me all along
Lies, all lies
Your mother, your father, what story are you on now
How come the town didn't know you was his daughter
(in pain) Cause my Mom slept around
lotta men
Anybody could've been my father
But we knew (not listening) Well you got what you wanted all along by fucking me
wish you had told me the goddamn truth in the first place
(screws out) didn't want you to know
Don't you
unnerstand
Bobby's got a headache now
It's too much to understand, too much talk
Too much history has taught him to doubt
When you're finished with me, 'm next been there, baby
been there with other cunts
sorry, not anymore
'll take you as far as California
If we can make that
After that you're on your own
Try Mexico
With all this bread, you can live like a queen
don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby
Please,  really want to be with you
Don't blow this
Don't you think  care about you
think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me
But it's nice to know you cared
The expression on Grace's face changes as rapidly as the desert weather, a coldness passing over and through her
You don't know your own mind
It blocks your heart
Keeping a wary eye on Grace, Bobby starts hauling Jake out of the trunk
Give me a hand
He wrestles Jake up to a sitting position
He grabs a can of beer from a warm six-pack in the trunk and shoves it into a pocket of Jake's coat
Poor old Jake, a few drinks, a fight with the sheriff over his wife
And both of 'em ended up dead
Grace takes his boots
Time to go for a walk, Jake
My mother died in this canyon
Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace
It doesn't work with me
One, two, three
They lift the corpse, and with great effort, haul it towards the edge of the drop
As they pause on the way, Bobby, wary of Grace's strange coldness, tries to soften the blow of separation
Look, it's not so bad we split up
It might be months before they find these guys
If at all
mean with the mountain lions around here
Remember, if they can't find no bodies, there's no crime
(She doesn't respond
) We'll be in Phoenix by noon
Lose this car, get another one
Texas, Mexico are big countries, all that money Grace, you'll meet someone else, you know, there's a lot of hope with a $100,000
They lift Jake again, and move to the edge
Hope is a four-letter word
But we all need that too
Hold him
He props Jake at the edge, standing, and transfers the weight onto Grace
Jake's head is on her shoulder
You make a pretty couple
It seems he might push them both over but instead takes the gun, wipes it of his prints, and slips it through Jake's belt
Won this in a poker game in Reno
God knows who it's registered to
You shoulda been more careful, Jake
See you later
As he takes Jake's weight off Grace and pushes it over the drop
Grace watches him go, her eyes shifting to Bobby, his back momentarily to her, also watching
She moves towards him
Bobby turns, slips on the edge
Now all we got to do is try and -- He feels a blur of motion, almost like a bird, and he is falling
falling, his life coming to an end
Grace is standing somewhere up above, briefly seen
Did she push him
He doesn't know
He's stunned as he falls on the rocks next to the bodies of Jake and Virgil
He screams out in sharp pain
His leg feels broken
But he is alive
Grace walks away, cutting it all off, deeply shaken
She must get away from the past and all these hollow men
She closes the trunk of the Mustang, gets in the driver's seat, reaches for the ignition key
Her hand fumbles for it a moment
It isn't there
Shit
She sits there
Bobby is calling from below
Grace
Help me, Grace
We been through too much together
We've only had one day, but you and me have been through more than most people ever will
know you were angry at me, and, you know, you were right
'm sorry  hit you
was wrong about leaving you
You don't belong in Mexico
She finally gets out and walks back to the edge of the cliff, looks down
Thank you
Thank you
knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace
Bobby
Are you all right
busted my leg
Can you make it back up
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope
It should reach down here
Go get it, throw it down
She looks
Of course the trunk is closed
She closed it
Bobby, the trunk
it's locked
Throw the keys up to me
'll get the rope
Bobby's eyes pass over Jake a few feet away, his eyes staring upwards in death
They take in the gun still attached to his waist
He knows the trunk wasn't locked when they took Jake out
can't throw that far
You got to climb down here and get the keys
You can make it
It's the only way Grace
Grace looks down at the drop
It's a tough descent but she knows she could make it and get back up as well
Grace
Please, Grace
You have to help me
Grace takes a look around
Okay
'm coming
Calm down
She starts down the cliff face
As she descends, he talks deliriously
(off) knew you'd help me
knew you wouldn't leave me baby, cause we're tied together too close
We belong together always
Grace makes it to the bottom of the drop, and walks cautiously towards Bobby
(yelling back, echoing) Bobby
Don't flip out on me
can't do this alone
know you don't trust me, but you gotta pull yourself together, 'm not gonna leave you
never wanted it to go down like this
It was different with you Bobby
You had dreams like me
You listened
would've gone anywhere with you, Bobby
We can make this work
'm sorry
really am
didn't wanna hurt you
Can he believe her
She sounds so sincere this time
She's heading for the body of Jake
And the gun
Bobby knows that and is already crawling there
(as he crawls) They're right here, Grace
The keys
Come get me out of here
Know why else  could never leave you
Why's that
'Cause  love you
Inching closer
Closer
They meet at the apex of Jake's corpse
And  love you too
And love's a funny thing
Sometimes don't know if  want to love you
Grace leans close to Bobby
He dangles the keys out in front of her, but she doesn't reach for them
Her eyes go to Bobby
She reaches for him
At that instant Bobby's hands shoot out and clamp hard around her
sharp gurgle is all that escapes Grace as Bobby twists the life from her, as Jake leers up at them
or kill you Grace twists and flails in Bobby's hands, but in spite of his bleeding stump, he holds her like a bear trap holds a grizzly
love you Grace, but just can't trust you She looks at him, trying to protest, shaking her head
Grace's flailing goes into overdrive
Somewhere in his semi-delirious state, Bobby's eyes might notice the gun at Jake's waist is no longer there
Grace manages one word: Jake He can't help you now, honey
Bobby is in agony as he kills her, part beast, part lover, he kills that which he loves
Suddenly, a  is heard
Bobby buckles with the blast, hit in the side
He kills her with one last wrenching thrust of his hands, breaking her neck
Bobby looks down at Jake's gun, which she clutches in her hand, and sees the hole in his side and the river of blood that flows from it
He manages to stand, looks at Jake; their bodies lying side by side
Bobby, with great difficulty, claws his way back up the rocks to the car, his fast-flowing wound staining the white rocks with blood
He makes it to the top and, losing more blood, climbs into the driver's seat
He checks the money in the bag
All there
All his
As he pulls a huge clot of blood from his side, the vultures circle
Perhaps one, smarter than the others, lands close by
It spooks Bobby but he's okay
He looks in the mirror
You're still lucky
He puts the key in the ignition, the engine comes to life
(waves back) Adios -- Suddenly, the   Darrell installed blows apart loudly
Bobby knows exactly and immediately what it is as a cloud of steam now rolls from under his hood
He shakes his head, frustrated
(sighs) Oh shit
(then) Arizona
He can't help but laugh at his bad luck
As we rise off the desert floor and take flight with the vultures, eventually leaving them all as specks of earth in the vast empty canyons of Arizona
