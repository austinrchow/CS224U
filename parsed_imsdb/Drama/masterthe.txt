Written by Paul Thomas Anderson 1952 - young man,   (early 20s)_ speaks to a ; What are you going to do when you get out of here
You're going to have to wear a belt for six months, maybe a year
What kind of belt
surgical belt
You won't be able to do very heavy lifting
try to stay away from that
But you spend time outdoors
What do you do
You didn't have very much on you when you were admitted
Where were you going

You seem like an intelligent fellow
'Quick on your feet - you like to drink
It's a weakness
But  like it

But you're expected to pay the hospital for medicines
And your belt
Alright
intend to do that
You saying you have a job for me
What
As an orderly
You couldn't be an orderly, it's too much lifting -- and a lot of things you'd have to learn
But maybe you could run an elevator, something of that sort

So what are you gonna do
Why don't you just ask for work
Work can't be hard to find
Depends on when you're ready to go

You can't work in your condition
What condition is that
You're aberrated
What's that mean
wandering from the path The problems you have in your life (your appendix, your work, your need to batter your body with booze
)  resolve that they can be fixed

Where's your money come from
Many years of successful writing and publishing has made me self sufficient
Reader's in all languages have enjoyed my work - but now 'm retired to study the mid and the spirit

Which is why
it is so un-wise to go lurking and jumping on strange ships

well:  apologize if  got a little out of hand last night - 'm just
looking for work and your ship looked good, so
it's a nice looking ship
Don't apologize
You're a scoundrel
How miss the days of working a four mastered schooner with nothing but salt horse, dried peas and a couple quarts of water

That was interrupted
He had a technology oh psychological warfare to present to the Defense Department
All that was interrupted, lost
Each time he sits to write, a new attack is launched against him and he spends too much time on defending himself
tell him to ignore it, but he's so sensitive
Who's attacking him
People that are scared
People that are greedy
Ex-wives
That's what's so nice about being at sea

We  access the past, traumas and seeds that abberate us in present time and once we access them - we challenge them and throw them away
Previously, 'd established how to access these aberrations and painful memories to pre-birth/cellular times
But the new studies prove there is a time beyond that
The Whole-of-time with which we are now working
At last count, perhaps sixty-seven trillion years our studies show
Besides the everyday struggles of how we become better, more able, more productive homo sapiens, the uses for this new science is the location and removal of certain leukemias, apathies, manics
Depressives, perverts, stuttering, neuroses, ulcers, arthritis, and asthmas
This is the province and science of Cause
If you'll forgive me,  must sit down
Perhaps you've taken notice of my leg injury and limp damndest thing
You see it happens every time  come to Manhattan Island, its a wound 've never conquered and 'll tell you how  found out about, because  never knew what in the  was happening
Well  did some processing to find out
Took Mary Sue to ay me down and lead me back
we processed over three hours
And something came up
It was this: lived a life before and suffered a great injury
Knee injury
It was just around 1888
great number and year
Significant as the creation
year of the new york city sewer system if 'm not wrong
was a thief and criminal, working late into the night robbing a bank in the western side of the island

My accomplices and made it clear across town when we were ambushed by the local authorities
-- but  made a slip away
digression into the under constructed sewer system
It was here that  could no be found - or so my thinking went
All my confidence and all my arrogance was brought upon me
Full in the face
For  was nose to nose with a twenty-five foot alligator in the New York City sewer
Oh brother
What a scare  was in for
Now if you've veer seen the
- you'll remember the fear
You see, this being an island, and in those days more inhabited by creature than man, why wouldn't  meet such a beast
In my evasion --  dropped the gold
The money 'd stolen in my getaway
not dropped, but stuffed in a newly cemented drain hole just around 125th Street
present day Harlem County believe today
Yes
Yes
stuffed it and made a getaway from both man and beast azshattered my knee in five different places-turned into a piece of glass
woke up early in the morning somewhere near the present day Times Square-which was nothing more than a farm
quite a farm
but that's another story
So what does this say
Injuries stay with us don't they
They sure do
How's it gonna go away
How
How
How'm  gonna fix this knee
How are any of us going to get better
More able
We Must Process The Whole Of Time
This Life and Pre Natal Cellular processing is not enough
We have Lived Many, Many, Many Lives
So anybody tat is not processing the whole of time - is doing a disservice to man and Will Not Get Better
cannot put it more simply

What is the difference between this and psychotherapy
Yes
Well
They are very different
No
Psychoanalysis, they lay back
No, no, no
Don't associate us with such people
That's terrible (he, he) why that's a bad manner don't you know
mean at that business about sex and all that
That's for the neurotic or the person who is insane or something like that
That's nothing to do with us
They've failed
That's for the fortunate few who can afford the fees
But some of this does in fact seem to share quite a lot with Dr
Freud and modern psychotherapy, does it not
No it does not
This is an exact science, you see
Comparable to physics or chemistry - but simpler
It's engineering
Herr Freud had his chance and contributed some very workable data, but in the end, he failed
So that's that
And how long does this take
That depends
But it can be quite fast
Quite fast
Or it can take some time
Sometimes less than 36 hours

Are you a religious people
We are not incorporated as a religion, no

Philosophy is senior to religion
You could call us a religion of religions
Are you saying then that any religion is rather narrow in its outlook
No, no, no
have no quarrel with man's belief's, but religions in general can be pre-occupied with a God or Idol or something of some such nature who is merely trying to fill the universe with a lot of little replicas of himself - we are trying to free the individual - not bend to a will of a God, you see
And if our teachings can reconcile these views it would be doing a great service to - Do you think it can
not only think it can,  know it does
You mentioned 'good science' and what it does

Back then
in 1941, Master
he'd been in operation, in army hospital
He died on the table
gone for seven minutes
but : And in a storm of vision and creative output from this experience he wrote The Split Saber aka The Darkest Cloud
Whoever read it
either went insane or committed suicide
Twelve people read it
Six dead, four disappeared
The last time anyone saw it
was his last publisher in New York
() 62
(') Master walked into the office to find out what the reaction was, the publisher called for the reader, the reader came in with the manuscript
threw It on the table
and flung himself out of the skyscraper window
Master took the book and hid it where no one could get to it
it's inside this book: all the history
All the facts
All too dangerous
He re-wrote it, using what he could as the basis for what we are able to accept and learn today
that's Book One that we all study and know
but the real stuff
The things at the center
are still too dangerous
They (kill/cure) any man who reads it

The impulse lodges and plants the push-pull instinct, dumped in scalding hot water, then freezing cold - a control mechanism - any legal action, a summons to court, the sight of a police officer, exposes a glandular reaction and anxiety wave of the highest order, - the mere threat of arrest will make a psychotic breakdown
