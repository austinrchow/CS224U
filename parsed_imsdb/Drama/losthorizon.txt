Written by Robert previous hit Riskin based on the novel by James Hilton [1] Over the titles we see the snow-capped mountains leading to Shangri-La
- of an impressive-looking book
The covers open and the pages turn
The first page reads: In these days of wars and rumors of wars - haven't you ever dreamed of a place where there was peace and security, where living was not a struggle but a lasting delight
The second page reads: Of course you have
So has every man since Time began
Always the same dream
Sometimes he calls it Utopia - sometimes the Fountain of Youth - sometimes merely "that little chicken farm
" The third page reads: One man had such a dream and saw it come true
He was Robert Conway - England's "Man of the East" - soldier, diplomat, public hero The fourth page reads: Our story starts in the war-torn Chinese city of Baskul, where Robert Conway has been sent to evacuate ninety white people before they are butchered in a local revolution
The fifth and final page reads: Baskul - the night of March 10, 1935
: - 1 The field is aflare with floodlights - on one side is an office building - on the other are hangars
The whole field is filled with Chinese refugees running around wildly
An Army transport is in front of the office building, motors going
2 Showing in the distance, probably several miles away, the effect of a burning city, which is Baskul
Over the shot we hear the steady boom-boom of gunfire
In the f
g
, we see the silhouetted figures of Chinese running away from Baskul and toward the Camera, their personal packs on their backs
3 Toward office building
Conway comes out of the building, followed by a small group of white people with frightened faces
They have to fight their way through a horde of milling Chinese
4 As Conway and group finally reach the plane where Conway forces the white people in
In this he is aided by his brother, George, a young and vigorous Englishman
The pilot sticks his head out of the cockpit
472
Conway, we can't take more than seven
Conway pulls a passenger out and gives the pilot a signal to start
(to passenger) All right
'm sorry
There will be another plane in a minute
All right - go on
5 Motors roar, and the plane starts to move, scattering those of the Chinese who were unfortunately too close to the ship
Conway and George rush back into the office building
6 There are about thirty white refugees, men, women and several children
They all lift their panicky faces to Conway and George as they enter
barrage of questions are flung at them
- Are there any more planes
Do you think the bandits will come here
Please take my wife next, Mr
Conway
Wait, wait
Everybody, wait
There are plenty of planes coming
Now everybody have patience
Everything will be all right
He crosses to a back room
You have nothing to worry about
Leave everything to my brother
7 As Conway enters to speak to operator
Yes, sir - with seven passengers aboard
Seven passengers
Good
Get me Shanghai
'm talking to them now, sir
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
(into mike) Conway speaking
Is Colonel Marsh there
473
' Right here, Conway
Go ahead
8 As Conway continues into mike
Colonel,  need more planes
've still about twenty people to get out
Where are those planes you promised us
' We sent everything we could find, Conway
They better get here soon or  can't be responsible 9 As George rushes in
Bob
think  hear motors
(listening - then into mike) Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now
(to George) Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here
Yes
He starts for the door
And be sure that none of the natives get in
(exiting) Yes
Hello
Colonel
' Hello, Conway
Yes
Thanks - and take care of that liver of yours
' Oh, ho - my word
10 As Conway enters
All right, get ready everybody
The planes are here
The people crowd around him pleading for priority
474
One at a time
Children first
Where are they
Come on now, and stand over here
woman pushes some children forward
Where's the mother
(standing nearby) They're orphans, Mr
Conway
see
All right
(directing people aside - pulling out an old lady) Well, you come - right over here - and you, and you (looking off scene) come on What about us, Mr
Conway
Gentlemen, please wait your turn
11 girl slouched in a corner
We meet Gloria Stone, a surly, wan-looking prostitute
You'd better take some of those squealing men with you first
They might faint on you
'll wait
12
- Something of a smile crosses his face
Just as you say
Just then, a terrific explosion is heard in the distance
13 All the lights go out
Everybody starts screaming
(sharply) Whoa
Don't lose your heads now - 'll see what it is
He dashes out
14 Conway rushing out, meets George coming back
The power house - they've blown it up
The planes can't land without lights
475
(thinking fast) Come on
We'll burn the hangar
That will make light for them
He grabs a lantern and dashes off
15 As they run through the screaming mob toward the hangar
16 It is filled with Chinese refugees clinging to their household goods
Conway and George enter
Conway speaks to them in Chinese, ordering them out
Some hesitate, and they have to push the terror-stricken waiting coolies out
When they have all left, Conway opens the spigots of several gasoline tanks, waits for the fuel to spill on the ground, then tosses a lantern on the fuel, igniting a blaze
At the same moment, he and George dash for the door
17 Conway and George rush out of hangar
When they are at a fairly safe distance, the building bursts into flames
: 18 Against a background of the burning hangar, a plane is just leaving the ground, as another one is landing
19 Of Conway, signalling
All right, go ahead
(to George) We go on to the next plane
Bring out any people that are left
Right, Bob
20
- Shooting toward the burning city of Baskul in the distance
We see the bandits coming, flashing bayonets, in pursuit of screaming refugees
21 Conway emerges, followed by Gloria, and an American, Barnard to the ship just as the pilot, Fenner, is climbing down from cockpit
Hello, Fenner
(broad grin) Hello, Conway
Having a little trouble
476
You never mind me
Get this gadget off the ground
George is pushing off Chinese
Bob, these are all that are left
(to George) Come on
Quick
This way
22 When Conway and others approach, George helps Gloria Stone up, while Conway faces the mob, punching at those who try to wedge their way forward
Finally one of them manages to get his foot on the step, and Conway pushes him violently
23
- Who staggers back and falls, sprawling
As he hits the ground, he yells: You can't leave me here, you blighter
[2] 'm a British subject
We meet Alexander
Lovett
24 Conway looks his surprise and lifts him off the ground
25
- Glaring off toward Conway, picks up a board and starts toward Conway
26 George emerges in time to see the Chinese lift the board and about to clout Conway on the head
George moves quickly, puts out his left hand, wards off the blow and with his right he punches the Chinese, who reels out of the scene
Look out, Bob
27 shadowy figure materializes in the cockpit, and clubs Fenner from behind
He shoves Fenner aside and takes his place
28 Conway pushes George up and starts to mount himself
He looks off - and what he sees startles him
(yells off) All right, Fenner
Go ahead
477
29 Of what Conway sees
Several trucks loaded with bandits - in makeshift uniforms - come tearing up the road - come to a stop
Some fire toward plane - others are setting up machine guns
Droves of refugees scramble to cover
30 Already present are Barnard, an American; Gloria Stone, the prostitute; and Lovett, whom we saw dressed as a Chinese
Conway slams the door shut - looks off - then cries: Get down on the floor, everybody
Go ahead, Fenner
They all fall on their faces
Fenner, let's go
31 Of the new pilot setting the controls and lifting the plane into flight
32 As the plane swings around - taxies crazily - and leaves the ground, accompanied by gunfire of the bandits
33 The occupants are still on the floor
Conway rises and glances out of a window, warily
(mumbling) Well,  guess we're out of range
(to others) Everybody all right
There are murmurs of "Yes" - "'m all right" - as they raise themselves
Whew
That was close
34 Conway starts for the back seat and suddenly sees Lovett
Where did you come from
'm Alexander
Lovett, sir
Why aren't you registered through our office
478
(chiming in) It would serve you right if you were left behind
(high-pitched voice) How could  know that a war was going to break out right over my head
(a grave injustice) Right over my head
Oh, my word
tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction
had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape
Where were you hiding
Hiding
Oh, no
Hunting -  was in the interior - hunting fossils
This morning looked up suddenly know - and a war broke out right over your head
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul
Aha - very good, Freshie
[3] Very good
You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later
He proceeds to the back seat
Barnard, the American, who is in front of Lovett, leans over toward him
35
- Barnard and Lovett
beg your pardon, brother
What did you say you were hunting
Fossils
Fossils, huh
'm a paleontologist
(blankly) what
paleontologist
479
Oh,  see
Lovett produces a small box clutched under his arm
have here a discovery that will startle the world
It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia
Well, what do you know about that
Found in Asia
Uh-huh
When  get home  shall probably be knighted for it
Knighted
You don't say
Do you mind if  take a look at it
(proudly) Not at all
He lifts the lid and Barnard peeks inside
: Wrapped carefully in absorbent cotton is something that resembles a dry chicken bone
: Barnard reaches for the box, but Lovett pulls it away from him
Sorry
This is the only thing  was able to save when those heathens surrounded me
(he is allowed to take it out and examine it - unimpressed) Uh-huh
You see, from this vertebrae  shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia
480
Yeah,  remember
You said that before
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era
Barnard stares at Lovett unbelievingly
Ah, poor fellow
Lovett glares at him resentfully, and snaps the lid shut on his box
Yes, it just shows (taking offense) don't know why 'm talking to you
don't know you
Who are you
(turns away) Okay, brother
Don't call me brother
Okay, sister
(chuckles to himself) No offense
No offense
36
- Gloria sits slumped in her seat, looking glumly out
Barnard glances at her curiously
Finally he makes a friendly overture
Cigarette
Gloria turns her head, surveys Barnard coldly, and without responding, turns back
say, will you have a cigarette
No
(unabashed) Say, you're an American, aren't you
(irascibly) Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates
Let me alone
He shrugs his shoulders and slides back into his seat
481
37 All is silent for a moment
Conway is writing on a small pad - which he rests on an uplifted knee
George is rummaging through a closet - rear of the cabin
38
- Conway still writes, undisturbed
George reaches into the closet and emerges with a bottle of whiskey
His face lights up
(holds up bottle) Hello
Look what  found
He crosses to Conway
Just what  needed too
(looks up - smiling) You
Just this once, Bob
feel like celebrating
Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England
You know what it means
(hands him cup) Here you are
Don't bother about those cables now
want you to drink with me
(holds his cup up) Gentlemen,  give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary
Conway watches him, amused
George gulps down his drink
(after a slight hesitation - downing his drink) Hurray
How 'm going to bask in reflected glory
(dreamily) People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary
" Don't talk nonsense
Give me the bottle
Conway takes the bottle from him and pours himself a second drink
That's why they're sending for you, Bob
With all these foreign entanglements, it was bound to happen
They need you
Conway, with a poured drink in hand, laughs
All right, you can laugh if you want to
But who else can they get
Who else is there in all of England half the fighter, half the diplomat, who 482
has half your knowledge of the foreign situation
They can't stop you now, Bob
Conway moodily pours himself a third
He downs the drink as we : 39 We find Conway, asleep in his seat, his head on his hands
George approaches and tenderly spreads a jacket over his shoulders
Conway stirs, opens an eye
(drunkenly) Hello, Freshie
Did you make that report out yet
Yes, Bob
Did you say we saved ninety white people
Yes
Hurray for us
Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated
No, you wouldn't say that
They don't count
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob
Just you wait until 'm Foreign Secretary
Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries
(confidentially - screws up face) You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other
Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in
'm going to fool them, Freshie
'm not going to have an army
'm going to disband mine
'm going to sink my battleships - 'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft
Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you
" So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think
And what will they think, Freshie
They'll think to themselves - "Something's wrong here
We've been duped
This is not according to form
These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them
" Then they'll lay down their arms
You see how simple the whole thing is
Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants (pause - drily) and 'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum
He starts to pour himself another drink
483
You'd better not drink any more, Bob
You're not talking sense
Conway downs the drink, and then chuckles cynically
Don't worry, George
Nothing's going to happen
'll fall right into line
'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be
'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because  haven't the nerve to be anything else
Do try to sleep, Bob
Huh
Oh, sure, Freshie
Good thing, sleep
He grunts and squirms
George tucks him in
Did you ever notice the sunrise in China, George
Ah, you should
It's beautiful
He gets settled
George relaxes and, leaning back, shuts his eyes
40 It is quiet
All are asleep until it reaches the glass panel leading to the cockpit
The pilot's face turns
Instead of Fenner we see a strange, Mongolian face - with sharp, piercing eyes
half-smile plays across his mouth
41 Flying at high speed against a moonlit sky
We stay on the shot until it vanishes, a mere speck, over the horizon
: - 42 The morning sun peeks over a mountain top
From the same direction, as if arriving with the sun, the ship looms up, and comes roaring toward us
43 All are asleep except Lovett, who fidgets on his seat
Then Barnard stirs - opens his eyes - and stretches
As he does so, he sees that Lovett is awake
Good morning, Lovey
beg your pardon
say, good morning, Lovey
484
Good morning (catches himself) Look here, young man
Eh
didn't care for 'sister' last night, and  don't like 'Lovey' this morning
My name is Lovett - Alexander,
see
see
Well, it's a good morning, anyway
'm never conversational before  coffee
Barnard glances out of the window, looks around outside thoughtfully
Wait a minute
Is it a good morning
Say, we're supposed to be travelling east, aren't we
Why, of course
Yes
Well, it looks to me as if we're travelling west
That's ridiculous
Is it
It certainly is
Look here Any child knows how to tell direction
Any child
don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea
If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south always get it twisted because 'm left-handed
Oh, really
485
Yes
Well, you just reverse it
Your left hand is (tries to explain - gets confused and irritated) What difference does it make what 'hand' you are
The north is the north
Uh-huh
All  know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it
Now you're irritating and absurd
44
- As he sulks by himself, looks around - locates the sun in back of him - smiles - satisfied he's right, throws a condescending glance over at Barnard - then suddenly his face clouds - the whole thing dawns on him
(jumps up shrieking) Oh, my word - of course - yes
Boy
Boy, we're travelling in the wrong direction
Wake up
We're going in the wrong direction
45 Conway is still asleep
(concerned for Conway) Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise
tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here
Be quiet
Fenner's the best pilot in China
He knows what he's doing
(not quite reassured) It's Fenner
He might have lost his way
Of course
That's what  told them last night
You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark
[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises
All right, all right
Calm yourself
'll talk to Fenner
486
He crosses to panel leading to cockpit, When he gets there he knocks on the window
Fenner
-  say George knocks again
From the cockpit side - the small shade suddenly snaps up - and George finds himself staring into the face of the mysterious pilot
He takes an instinctive step backward
The pilot turns his head as George keeps backing up until he gets to Conway
George turns to Conway and shakes his shoulder
Bob
Bob
Conway stirs in his sleep, slowly opens his eyes, yawns and stretches
Throughout it, George speaks
Wake up
Something's happened
It isn't Fenner in the cockpit
Conway looks at him, glances off toward the others, and back at George
(dismissing him with a gesture) Oh, stop it
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something
We're nowhere near Shanghai
We're going in the opposite direction
This interests Conway and he looks out of the window
We're over the desert
That's funny
Then rising, he crosses to cockpit
The others watch him expectantly
46
- Conway pounds on the panel
The face of the pilot appears in sight
Conway tries to ask him something in Chinese
The pilot glares at them for a second, then a gun is shoved out at them
Instinctively they back away
Charming chap
(not being funny) Nice puss to meet in a dark alley
The ship lurches - and they are thrown off balance
The panel has been snapped shut
487
Well, that's that,  guess
Wonder what's happened to Fenner
Yes
And who is he
How'd he get there
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots
No
That's not possible
If we had landed, we all would have been awakened
Of course
We never left the air know -  didn't sleep the whole night long
(with finality) That fellow got on at Baskul
What's he doing
Where's he taking us
He may be a maniac for all we know
George, who has disappeared during the above, now returns, with a monkey wrench in his hand
Conway stops him
George, what are you going to do
'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is
Good
What if he refuses
We'll smash his face in
That's what we'll do
Brilliant
(a sweeping gesture) Can anyone here fly a plane
There is a general chorus of "nonot ," etc
(takes wrench from George's hand) Well, George, that's no good
Conway throws the monkey wrench into a corner
488
guess we're in for it
In for what
don't know
He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner
(starts for his seat) When he lands, we'll find out
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land
What do you suggest
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces
It might afford you a great deal of relief
(sitting) Now gentlemen, 'm going back to sleep
Oh, and  was having such a peaceful dream
(curling up) As soon as he lands, let me know
He shuts his eyes and leans back
The others watch him for a second - and wander back to their seats
47
- Gloria is apparently indifferent to their predicament
As Barnard watches her, a little bitter smile plays around her mouth
48
- He stares out of the window and is suddenly startled
49 Of the plane with its nose turned downward in a sharp descent
50 George is on his feet
(excited) We're heading down
We're going to land
Everyone looks out
George rushes to Conway and nudges him
(breathlessly) Bob, we're landing
(pointing out) Bob, we're coming to a village
Conway sits up and looks out
489
51 Plane starting toward ground
All we can see are mountain tops
52 They all stare out of the windows
Conway peers intently
: 53 From angle in cabin of plane
Through the window, directly below we see a large open space at the foot of the hills
The plane is headed for it
54 We see a swarm of strange-looking natives, scantily attired, but bearing bayonets, running toward the plane
55 Of George and Conway, as the ship hits the ground, bouncing and swaying perilously
56 As the plane taxies across the uninhabited space
57 Conway and George ready to get out
As Conway turns to open the door, he looks off and is startled by something he sees
George follows his gaze, and a bewildered expression comes into his eyes, too
58 Shooting through door
The strange-looking natives have surrounded the plane and are closing in
59 Conway and George both instinctively wheel around toward the opposite side
But from that direction too, a horde of natives dash toward them
Conway hesitates a second, and like a flash springs for the door
But he stops again, as he opens the door
60 To include door of plane
Conway finds himself staring into the threatening mouths of half a dozen rifles, and quickly shuts the door
What are these people
don't know
can't get the dialect
490
61 We see the pilot and several natives in single file as they come toward the plane, buckets in hand
In b
g
, one of them lowers a bucket into a well in the ground
Look - they're loading up with gasoline
62 The gas is being loaded
Natives on horseback dash back and forth shouting and signalling
Camels can be glimpsed among the horses
There is tremendous disorder and commotion
63 The ship leaves the ground
The natives stand around, curiously watching
64 Conway is pacing
The occupants sit by their open windows
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us
(he sits down) George, something tells me our journey is just beginning
Where are we going
Huh
(pointing) If you ask me, we're heading straight for those mountains
65 We see the plane against the sky
In the b
g
, there is nothing but snow-covered mountains
: :  sign reading "Shanghai Municipal Airport
" 66 Chinese officer is on the phone
Douglas plane[6] from Baskul with Conway and four others aboard are missing
Unreported between here and Baskul
of: switchboard operator besieged by calls
telegraph secretary furiously typing
Newspapers being run off a press
491
67 Of a high official of the British Foreign Office
(holding forth to his secretary) Make it very emphatic that His Majesty's Government will hold the Chinese government and all Chinese governors of Chinese provinces responsible for the complete safety of Robert Conway
to reveal other foreign department officials and functionaries arriving in the midst of his speech
Good morning, gentlemen
(ad-libbing) Good morning, etc
No news yet, sir
It's fantastic
The plane couldn't disappear into thin air
(turning to secretary of the group) And cable Lord Gainsford at Shanghai
Leave no stone unturned to find Conway
(turning back to foreign officials) And Robertson
Yes, sir
Better get a postponement of the Far East conference
We can't afford to meet those nations without Conway
68 The occupants are hunched up in the corner of their seats
What little clothes they have, and what few blankets, are bundled around them
All the windows are shut
: Registering a height of 10,000 feet
69 There is silence for a moment before Barnard speaks
It can't be kidnapping
They wouldn't be taking us so far on such a dangerous trip
No sense to it
No one responds to his speculation and he lapses into silence
492
70 To include George, Conway and Lovett
What do you make of it, Bob
You must have some idea
Conway shrugs
Huh
give it up
But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway
Well, Mr
Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do-nothing attitude is very disappointing
What do you want him to do
don't know
'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary
Lovett slips back into his corner and pulls his coat over his face
: Registering above 10,000 feet
We on it as it climbs and climbs to 15,000 feet
71
Showing the plane high over mountain peaks
: - 72 Against a moonlit sky, we see a lone speck - the plane as it flies high above the mountains
It appears to be traveling through endless space
73 The atmosphere is pervaded with a feeling of utter futility
The occupants are still slumped in the corners of their seats
74
- Gloria has a fit of coughing
She grabs her throat - as she gasps for breath
Barnard, himself feeble and exhausted, glances over at her sympathetically
75 Including Lovett, George, and Conway
Lovett sits with his chin helplessly on his chest, his mouth ludicrously open, his eyes popping
George, his teeth clenched, struggles against a desire to sob
Conway looks at him feelingly
76
- Conway's eyes never leave George, who finally unable to control himself, emits a sob - and rather ashamed, slaps his hand over his mouth and turns away
493
Oh George, come on
(suddenly - tensely) It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob
Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there
George, with an effort, stifles another outbreak
We got above that storm
: At 20,000 feet - and while we stay on it - keeps mounting
77 Deathly silence
Gloria has her hands to her ears, rocking in pain
Suddenly her voice rents the air
Oh
Oh
can't stand it any longer
She jumps up and moves about frantically
(screaming) Take us down
can't stand this pain any longer
Let me out of here  say
can't stand it any longer
She runs to one of the ship's doors and pounds on it with her fist, then tries to shove it open
blast of frigid air throws her back
George and Conway manage to pry her off and pull her away
Sobbing pitifully, she lets Conway steer her back to her seat, where she bundles up in torturous pain
For a moment nothing is heard but her stifled moans
Take it easy, sister
Unexpectedly the cockpit panel opens, and the pilot tosses something out in Gloria's direction
(grabbing for it) It's oxygen
(he rigs it up for her) Now take it with your teeth
That's right - bite
(struggling) Let me alone
Now, now
Come on now
That's right
Now, bite
She resumes her sobbing quietly
494
: 78 Of the plane at twilight, fading into deepest night
79 Of the cabin at night, everyone frozen in despair
All of a sudden there is a loud, sputtering noise from the outside
They all react - listen for a moment - until the noise dies completely
Now nothing is heard - not even the motor
- (breaking the silence) What's that
What's happening
(immediately on his feet) He must have run out of fuel
Look
Look down there
80 The plane gradually tilting downward
81 The ship sways several seconds and finally rights itself
82 Of what they see from plane
Vast snow-covered mountain peaks, with no sign of a stretch big enough to land
83 The plane sways perilously in the cross wind
84 They are all silent - waiting prayerfully
Conway turns to the others - his voice electric with authority
George - everybody - better get back towards the tail
He may nose her over
Into the corner, quick
George - cushions, blankets
They obey his command
85 We see the plane nearing the ground, sailing over some smaller hills
86 With Conway in front of them, the others are crouching in the corner
There are ad-libs of fearful assurances while they hand around cushions and blankets
495
87 Just as the ship hits the ground for the first time
88 The occupants brace themselves for the jolt
The ship hits and bounces several times and finally stops
Its nose seems to bury itself in the ground
The people are lifted high into the air where they remain, suspended for a few seconds, terror-stricken
Then, accompanied by grinding, crackling sounds, the ship flops back and falls on its side
For a moment there is stark silence - while the people do not stir
look of relief spreads over their faces
Everybody all right
The passengers offer dazed replies: "Okay - yeah -  think so
" Meanwhile, Conway has opened the door
swirling mass of snow greets them, so that they have to force their way out
89 George and Conway fight their way down from the plane in the blinding snow
George quickly runs around to the other side
Conway crosses to the cockpit, and clambers aboard
90 Lit only by the dashboard light
Conway sticks his head in from the outside
His eyes which have been flashing with determination suddenly sober to pilot, who is slumped over, his chin resting on his chest
91 George pops into view on the opposite side, just as Conway has found the pilot's gun beside him on the seat
What is it
Has he fainted
It looks like it
(sniffing) Smell those fumes
Conway hops up beside the pilot
George follows suit
(handing gun to George) Here George, take the gun
Hold the lights
'm going to search him before he comes to
(while searching) We might find something interesting
(finds something) Hello - what's this
map
(hands it to George) He resumes his search enthusiastically
Suddenly he stops
The utter limpness of the pilot's body gives him pause
He lifts up his chin, stares into his face - pulls up his eyelid and then places a hand over his heart
He turns slowly toward George, who has been watching his brother intently
496
He's dead
Dead
George stares unbelievingly
It must have happened the moment he hit the ground
(a pause) Let's take a look at this map
Conway holds the map under the dashboard light
He studies it painstakingly, and his tense expression changes to one of deep concern
George's eyes are glued on him
What is it
See that spot
Yes
That's where we were this morning
He had it marked
Right on the border of Tibet
Here's where civilization ends
We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map
(afraid to ask) What's it mean
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached
George stares at him, wide-eyed, the gravity of their situation slowly penetrating his terrorized mind
Conway's thoughts are interrupted by a knock on the panel, and he looks up
92 We see the faces of Barnard and the others
We hear their voices inquiring - "Hey, Conway, what's happening
" - "What's up
" - "Where are we
" - "What'd you find out
" 93
- Conway turns to George
George, our chances of getting out of this are pretty slim
But it's up to us
(a nod toward cabin) We can't have three hysterical people on our hands
He enters the cabin through the cockpit
497
94 As Conway enters, he is met by a volley of questions
- What do you say
What'd you find out
(interrupting - cheerily) Everything's all right
The pilot won't trouble us any more
He's - he's dead
This is met by a series of exclamations
- Dead
How did it happen
Probably a heart attack
What are we going to do
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning
95 Taking in George as he enters from cockpit
His terror-stricken eyes look dully before him
He stops in the doorway
The storm will probably die down by then
My suggestion is that we better all try and get a good night's rest
96 Over the shoulders of Gloria, Barnard and Lovett as they face Conway, who sits down
(fiercely) Why don't you tell them the truth
97 They all wheel around and face George
Why don't you tell them we're a million miles from civilization, without a chance of getting out of here alive
It's slow starvation - that's what it is
It's a slow, horrible death
When the significance of this outburst finally sinks into the chaotic minds of his listeners, they turn to Conway hopefully, certain he will refute it
But Conway looks beyond them at George
From his noncommittal silence, they realize that George's statement is the truth
They slip into their seats
The place is heavy with a fatalistic silence
George slowly crosses to his seat near Conway, avoiding his accusing eyes
Suddenly the air is rent with harsh, bitter laughter from Gloria
They all look up
498
Well, that's perfect
Just perfect
What a kick 'm going to get out of this
She emits another outburst of semi-hysterical laughter
98
- Favoring Gloria
The bitterness of a lifetime in her voice
(grimly satisfied) year ago a doctor gave me six months to live
That was a year ago
'm already six months to the good
'm on velvet
[7] haven't got a thing to lose (semi-hysterical) But you
- you, the noble animals of the human race, what a kick 'm going to get out of watching you squirm for a change
(her voice cracks completely) What a kick
She flops into her seat and buries her head in her hands
For quite a while all we hear are her stifled sobs
99
- George throws sidelong glances at his brother, feeling his guilt
100 Shooting from front of plane, taking in entire cabin
The only sound that comes in on the tragic quiet is the low moaning of the wind outside
feeling of doom has descended upon the five people
: 101 Shooting toward the mountains which seem to imprison the valley below
The snowstorm, treacherous in its fury, seems to threaten the valley with complete obliteration
102 Of the plane, tilted over on its side
It is fully covered with snow , shivering in their blankets as they pace worriedly
103 George and Conway are missing
Lovett turns from the window
They've been gone for three hours
The others appear disinterested in this observation
Left us here to rot
That's what they've done
Heroes of the newspapers
All right, all right
Keep quiet
Lovett sees something through the window
499
104
- George and Conway are seen walking briskly toward the plane, their few clothes a scant protection against the biting wind
105 Here they come
The others quickly glance up, just as Conway and George clamber aboard
Conway has a serious mien, but George is full of vigor and enthusiasm
Hello, everybody
He holds out his hat which he has been carrying, bottom side up
Well, we found some food
Barnard and Lovett rush to him
No chance of our starving now
When they see the contents of his hat, their faces fall
What is it
Mountain grass
It's good, too
Here, have some
've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff
They grab handfuls
He goes on: Listen, my brother and  have worked out a plan
If we use our heads, we should be able to keep alive for weeks, until he gets back
& Gets back
Where's he going
He doesn't know
But he's starting out right away in the direction of India
Sooner or later he's bound to run into somebody - a tribe or something
Yeah
106
- Throughout the previous scene he has been busily occupied making preparations
Out of the baggage hold he has brought some blankets and rope and has been wrapping his feet in them
As George speaks, he looks up and smiles
500
Now here's the idea
We found a cave over by that small hill
After we bury the pilot, we're moving in
We can have a fire there
shouldn't be surprised to see Bob back within a week
Conway's smile dies on his face
We get a feeling he is attempting a futile journey, and is fully aware of it
He resumes the roping of his feet - his movements mechanical
107
- Barnard and Lovett all attention as George speaks
Gloria, off to one side, has her eyes peeled on Conway intently
108
- You haven't got a Chinaman's chance[8] of getting out of this country alive, and you know it
Conway stares at her blankly
Cave, eh
Where
(pointing) Over by that hill
Barnard peers out the plane window
Hey - look
Look, Bob
109 They all look up and glance out
110 From their angle
In the distance, just appearing over the top of a hill, we see a caravan of natives approaching
They are not close enough to distinguish who or what they are, but that they are human beings is apparent
111 Conway takes in the unbelievable sight
We hear the exultant exclamations of the others
Barnard and Lovett start out of the plane
(looking around) Where are they
Do you see them
Yes
Do you think they're cannibals
501
112 Where George, Lovett and Barnard wait, a trifle awe-stricken
Conway joins them
Gloria has stayed inside
113 The approach of the caravan from the viewpoint of the group
It comprises some twenty Tibetans, attired in sheepskins, fur, hats and boots
Somewhere in the middle of the single file is Chang, an elderly Chinese
Chang steps forward as their leader
114
() As Conway leaves his group and meets the oncoming party
He approaches Chang and bowing courteously, greets him in Chinese
Chang turns his head slowly and speaks in perfect Oxfordian English
am from a nearby Lamasery
(holding out his hand) My name is Chang
115 George, Barnard and Lovett
Why, he's speaking English
English
(shaking hands) And mine's Conway
How do you do
You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are
My friends and  - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves travelling in the opposite direction At the mercy of a mad pilot
We'd be eternally grateful if you (interrupting) Where is your mad pilot
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes
When the plane landed he was dead
We were just going to bury him when you came along
502
(preoccupied) Pardon me Chang turns to some of his men and issues an order in a foreign tongue, obviously instructions to take care of the pilot
(when Chang is through) So, if you will be good enough to direct us to your Lamasery 116
- Favoring Chang
shall consider it an honor to accompany you and your friends
He issues a command to his men and turns to Conway
You will need suitable clothes for the journey
It is not particularly far, but quite difficult
Thank you
Several men have hopped into the scene while he has been speaking
They come forward with boots - sheepskins - fur caps, etc
As they start to get into these new clothes: : 117 As the caravan starts its journey back up the hill
All five people are now attired in their newly acquired outfit
118 Showing the party on various stages of what looks like a humanly impossible journey
We see them first climbing - then across long vastnesses of flat land
Each succeeding time we see them, their feet drag more wearily
Their breathing becomes more difficult
These pictures finally : 119 Halfway up a mountainside
The procession is just starting around a hairpin curve
They are forced to travel on a narrow ledge overlooking a deep ravine
120
- , As they cling against the rocky sides and glance apprehensively down into the abyss below
121
- Close by to Barnard
Gloria's face is wan and haggard
Every upward move seems to require a Herculean effort
She stops and has a fit of coughing
503
: 122 Of the snake-like moving party
They have reached quite a height although the peak of the mountain they are ascending towers high above them
The cutting wind moans treacherously as it caroms off the mountainside
heavy mist envelops them
123 As the snake-like line approaches a narrow, treacherous footbridge and makes a slow, difficult crossing in heavy weather
124 Of the group
They round a curve and come upon a narrow crevice which opens up into a passageway
One by one they step through, assisted by the natives
On the other side, they sigh relievedly
Oddly, the wind has stopped, the chill has lessened
They look up to inspect their surroundings and a startled look comes into their eyes
124 Of Conway as he glances casually around
What he sees leaves him transfixed
He stares unbelievingly before him for a long time
- 125 From angle at mountain top
sight that is both magnificent and incredible
The eye-filling horizon before them throws out a softness and a warmth that is breathless
On the left is a group of colored pavilions that seem as if suspended on the mountainside
Down below, in the hazy distance, is a valley which gives one the impression of a huge tapestry, superb in its blending of soft colors
In every direction, wherever one might gaze, there is a feast of strange and heavenly beauty
126 As Chang approaches Conway
Welcome to Shangri-La
127
- Conway's group and Chang
Chang smiles as he watches their astonished faces
Conway turns from the rare magnificence of Shangri-La, unhampered by the wind and storm they had just encountered, and looks backward, in the direction from which they came to assure himself he is the victim of a nightmare
Chang, watching him, answers him before he can express his astonishment
(a wave of his hand) You see, we are sheltered by mountains on every side
strange phenomena for which we are very grateful
504
: 128 As the group approaches the beautiful and peaceful Shangri-La
129 At the foot of a wide marble stairway as the caravan stops
It's magic
130 On the group, as they look around and feast their eyes on the grandeur of the place
131
- Glancing around at his picturesque surroundings
132 Following Conway's gaze
In an upper window of a tower, their faces glued to the pane, are two robed Lamas who stare down curiously to a very narrow terrace covered almost completely by a floral arbor
In it stands a statuesque woman of rare beauty
She looks down at Conway intently
133
- As he returns her gaze, impressed by her beauty
' Come along, Bob
Coming, Bob
134
- His eyes still on the girl above
He starts up the steps, staring at her, then stumbles
135
- Laughing at his embarrassment
136
- He smiles up at her
: 137 It suggests nothing we might expect to see in this forsaken place
The motif is neither Oriental nor religious - but rather a delicately appointed room, subdued in tones
At the moment, no one is present except servants who silently set the table
138 Of Lovett peering worriedly toward dining room door
He sees two servants who flank the entrance and steps back hesitantly
Barnard emerges from a room across the hall, and Lovett beckons to him
Both are attired in flowing robes not unlike the one worn by Chang
Mr
Barnard,  do not like this place
definitely do not like this place
505
Will you stop squawking
Look at me
Look at what they gave me to wear
You never looked better in your life
As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey
They have reached the doorway of the dining room and halt
Two servants bow and scrape and lead them in
Something tells me this means food
Come on
just feel as though 'm being made ready for the executioner
139 As the servants show Lovett and Barnard to their places
(taking in the food) Yeah
If this be execution, lead me to it
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter
Fatten them
Uh-huh
You're a scream, Lovey
Please don't call me Lovey
At this moment Conway and George enter
That was refreshing
Oh, ho - the food looks good
He takes something off the table and nibbles at it
Some layout they got here
Did you get a load of the rooms
You couldn't do better at the Ritz
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me
Conway looks at him and smiles
Don't mind Lovey
He's got the misery
Mr
Conway,  don't like this place
don't like it
It's too mysterious
506
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it
'll say
' [ 9] 140 It is in semi-darkness
The moon sends a stream of light through the windows
Outside we see the outline of towering mountains
Spread across the bed - her clothes unchanged - is the body of Gloria - her face sunk deep in the pillows
141 Gloria emits wracking coughs
After a few moments - she sits up
Her cheeks are wet - her hair disheveled - her eyes bloodshot
We get an impression of someone who has suffered for hours
Finally, her coughing begins again - and unable to stand it, she rises and paces the floor - then she crosses to the window and looks down, - and into her eyes has come a grim, determined expression
142 From Gloria's point of view
She is staring at the chasm below her
141 Gloria continues to peer below - and her coughing resumes
143 As Chang comes down the corridor - hears the coughing and stops
' 144 Chang enters and watches Gloria for a moment before speaking
Is there something  can do for you
Gloria wheels around and glares at him
What do you want
've offered you some warm broth thought perhaps- You get out of here
If any of you men think you can come busting in here- She cannot finish as she is attacked by a fit of coughing
Please calm yourself
You'll soon be well if you do
(through fits of coughing) don't need any advice from you
Get me a doctor
507
'm sorry, but we have no doctors here
(looks up quickly) No doctors
(bitterly) That's fine
That's just fine
Please let me help you
Sure, you can help me
You can help me jump over that cliff
've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but  haven't got the nerve to jump
(quietly) You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain
Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes
(her voice cracking) Don't preach that cheap, second-hand stuff to me
(a sob escapes) Go on, beat it
Beat it
She flings herself across the bed, coughing uncontrollably
Chang watches her sympathetically for a few seconds
(before turning away) Peace be with you, my child
145 They all look up as Chang enters
He is escorted to his place at the head of the table by two servants who stand on either side of his chair
(jovially) Good evening
Good evening, my friends
Oh no, no, no, please sit down
hope you found everything satisfactory
& Swell
Excellent
(sees that no one has started) You shouldn't have waited for me
Where's the girl
Miss Stone
508
She's remaining in her room
She isn't feeling very well
(to others) Now please go on without me
eat very little
146 Shooting down the long table toward Chang
He sits up straight - studying them - as the others bend over their food
: 147 The meal is over
Conway sips from a wine glass
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal
Thank you
And the wine - excellent
'm glad you like it
It's made right here in the valley
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office
All of England is waiting to hear about my brother
There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back
Really
Well, as regards cabling, 'm afraid  can't help
Unfortunately, we have no wireless here
As a matter of fact, we have no means of communication with the outside world
George stares at him suspiciously - and then turns to Conway for his reaction - but Conway is apparently disinterested in the whole conversation
Not even a radio
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible
509
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately
Some means to get us back to civilization
Are you so certain you are away from it
As far away as  ever want to be
Oh, dear
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason
'm afraid that wouldn't help
You see, we have no porters here
No porters here
No
What about those men we met this morning
Yes
Those are our own people
They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning
It is much too hazardous
148
- To intercut with above speech
He has remained quiet throughout the scene, apparently interested only in a paper in front of him, upon which he has been writing
: What has been occupying Conway's interest
It is a picture of Chang which he has been listlessly drawing
How do you account for all this
Who brought it in
149 They all turn to Chang expectantly
Oh, yes
There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here
That is our only contact with the outside world
Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey
How can we get in touch with them
510
In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate
We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years
Two years
Yes
Barnard and Lovett look shocked
George starts to say something, but the words choke in his throat
But  can assure you, gentlemen, if there is a prolonged delay, Shangri-La will endeavor to make your stay as pleasant as possible
(rising) And now if you will excuse me, it is getting late
do hope you all sleep well
Good night
The servants move his chair back
Before he goes, however, he turns to Conway
Good night, Mr
Conway
Conway, a little surprised at the distinction in his behalf, nods
Good night, sir
Chang exits
There is a hushed silence following Chang's departure
That's what  mean - mysterious
Mr
Conway,  don't like that man
He's too vague
(concerned) We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob
It seems to me we should be grateful
We were in a bad mess this morning
(a wave of his hand) After all, this is quite pleasant
Why not make ourselves comfortable until the porters do arrive
While he was speaking, the muted strains of a violin float into the room
Conway rises
511
150 As Conway crosses to a balcony door
That's what  say
What do you say to a rubber of bridge
saw some cards in the other room
Not for me, thanks
No, 'm too weary
He disappears onto the balcony
George watches him go
(slightly effeminate) How about you Lovey
Come on
Let's you and  play a game of honeymoon bridge
(distractedly) 'm thinking
Thinking
What about some double solitaire
As a matter of fact, 'm very good at double solitaire
No kidding
Yes
Then 'm your man
(starts away) Come on, Toots
Lovett detests the pet names, but follows
George thinks a moment - and crosses to balcony
151 Conway is listening moodily to the soulful music
George wanders in beside him
Hello, George
(looking out) Cigarette
Thanks
(lights the cigarette - after a pause) suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure
We've had plenty of it the last few days
512
It's far from over, from what  can see
This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization
Bob, you don't seem concerned at all
Oh, 'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything
(moodily) think 'm going to like it here
You talk as though you intend on staying
(turns to him) Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before
What are you talking about
(back to earth) don't know
You're a strange bird
No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill
152
- Conway's point of view, studying George
Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill
What could there be except just another hill
In any event, 'm not curious
At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home
'd give anything to be in London right now
Of course you would
If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father
What do you mean if we should get out
(evasively) Did  say "if"
513
(interrupting) That's what you said
Well -  mean What's on your mind, Bob
You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here
153
- George, 've been putting things together
Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot
And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane
Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point
What brought them there
Unless it was to meet us
(catching on) Chang's first question was about the pilot
Uh-huh
There must be some connection between the plane and this place
They must have deliberately brought us here
Why, Bob
What reason could they have for doing a thing like that
That's what's on the other side of the hill
: - 154 Shooting over shoulders of two men in f
g
We see a beautiful picture of the valley below
There is a tranquility here that is beatific
The two men are revealed as Conway and Chang
They stand on a terrace of one of the tower rooms
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley
The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it
There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La
Who and what is Shangri-La
You
Goodness, no
So there are others
514
Oh, yes
Who, for instance
In time you will meet them all
155
-   - He watches Chang's face searchingly, then smiles
For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be
(laughs) There are some things, my dear Conway, deeply regret  may not discuss
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today
You should have a record made of it
(evasively) Shall we go inside
should so like to show you some of our rare treasures
156 On a spiral staircase
Looking surreptitiously around, he backs his way up as he reaches the top of the landing
Here he stops and glances around the corner down a corridor
157 as he peers into several rooms searchingly
He finally arrives at one and enters
158 George enters and looks around
It is dimly lit and apparently unoccupied
He crosses to a desk and picks up several objects, scrutinizing them closely
159
,  - She sits, a tapestry board on her lap, watching George with keen interest
160
- He opens a book and glances at its contents
161 Maria surveys his back appraisingly
Good afternoon
George wheels around, startled, and stares at her intently
515
(starts backing out) Excuse me (appealingly) Please don't go
George hesitates at door
Tea will be served any moment
162
- He watches her with grave speculation for a long moment, then slowly moves toward her
(a winning smile) Won't you come in
George still maintains a serious mien, as their eyes meet
My name is Maria
Won't you sit down
163 It is a huge room
The walls are lined with impressive tomes
Chang is showing Conway around
164 Conway has just finished browsing through one of the books
By the way, what religion do you follow here
We follow many
look of surprise spreads over Conway's face
(thoughtfully) To put it simply,  should say that our general belief was in moderation
We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including (he smiles) the excess of virtue itself
165
- That's intelligent
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives
We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience
As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy
516
How about law and order
You have no soldiers or police
Oh, good heavens, no
How do you deal with incorrigibles
Criminals
Why, we have no crime here
What makes a criminal
Lack, usually
Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another
There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything
You have no disputes over women
Only very rarely
You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not
(smiling) Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her
166
-   - That's very convenient
think 'd like that
You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems
167
- Chang smiles
Conway scarcely hears the last speech, for his attention has been caught by the playing of a piano
He stops to listen
Chang has walked out of scene
168 Conway locates the direction whence the music comes, goes to a doorway where he stops
169
- He realizes Conway did not follow him and turns
When he sees Conway, his face clouds - and he starts toward him
170 Conway watches someone through door with grave interest
Chang enters scene and follows his gaze
517
171 From doorway
It is a spacious, high-ceilinged room, oddly shaped, and except for a piano, a harp and several chairs, is otherwise sparsely furnished
At the extreme end, the room is set off by an alcove of stained glass extending from the ceiling to the floor, where it finishes with a deep window seat
At the piano we see an old man - and by his side is the girl Conway saw last night
They finish playing and both laugh heartily
172 Conway finds her laughter infectious - and smiles
173
- In the midst of her laughter, the girl sees Conway, off scene, and her face sobers - self-consciously
174 Chang quickly takes Conway by the arm
At some time in the future you will have the pleasure of meeting her
Conway turns for one last glimpse of the girl, and then turns to Chang, looking up at his face, puzzled and amused
Some man had better get ready to be very courteous to me
175
- She continues to stare off toward the door, her eyes alight with a keen interest
: 176 But Mr
Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters
They were
Well, it must have taken Centuries
Centuries
Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures
Of course we have no money as you know it
We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it
518
177
- They have arrived in a small room, where they pause
Chang reaches into a bowl of large nuts, cracks one, and hands the nut to Conway
Then he does the same for himself
During the following scene, both are eating nuts from the bowl
That would suit me perfectly
'm always broke
How did you pay for them
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world
So we merely
buy and sell
Buy and - sell
No, no, pardon me, exchange (chuckling) see
Gold for ideas
You know Mr
Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that  suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere
Whose idea was it
How did it all start
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man
Who
Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed
He is responsible for everything you see here
He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art
In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault
When was all this
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death
It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself
(shocked) He amputated his own leg
519
Yes
Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg
It would have healed without amputation
Well, they didn't actually mean that
Yes, yes
They were very sincere about it too
You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here
They've never known anything different
So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here
Well, is it
Rather astonishingly so, yes
And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself
Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg
108 and still active
You're startled
Oh, no
Just a little bowled over, that's all
Forgive me
should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age
Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say
But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live
In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death
" or, "This thing or that killed him
" Very often
And very true
Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide
(after a pause) That's all very fine if it works out
little amazing, of course
520
Why, Mr
Conway, you surprise me
surprise you
Now that's news
mean, your amazement
could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds
Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it
Mr
Chang, if you don't mind,  think 'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course
(chuckles) Then everything is quite all right, isn't it
They exit scene together
[10] 178 On a garden bench Gloria slumps languidly
Suddenly we hear Barnard's voice, yelling
Gloria quickly turns her back
Barnard runs into scene
Honey, it's terrific
Terrific
just saw something that will make your hair stand on end
You see those hills over there
Gold
Gold
Popping right out of them
Tons of it
(conspiratorially) Now look, you keep this under your hat, because if those other monkeys hear about it, they'll declare themselves in
But if  can mine that stuff, 'll throw a bombshell into Wall Street
Now look, 've got a plan - and if Gloria begins coughing heavily
Barnard notices how pale and haggard she looks
Aw say, honey, you aren't feeling well, are you
Look, don't pay too much attention to what those doctors tell you
've seen an awful lot of people fool them, and 've got a hunch that this place is going to be good for you
Honest, have
(waits for her reaction - receives none) Come on now
Come on
You be a good kid, and snap out of it, and 'll cut you in on the gold deal
Look, 'm going up and make a deal with Chang - right now
He enthusiastically exits scene
' 179 Lovett enters warily, sits down at his desk and begins to write in his journal
521
: 2nd Day at Shangri-La "This place is too mysterious
" He looks up, sees himself in a mirror and gives a start
Then, chuckling to himself reassuringly, he looks around warily and continues to write
: - 180 It is a bright, cheery morning
Conway is drinking in the beauty of his surroundings
He comes into the area where the horses are stabled
Two men are busily grooming the horses
(cheerily) Good morning
Good morning, Mr
Conway
Oh, you speak English, do you
Yes, sir
Would you like to take a ride, Mr
Conway
No, thanks
Not just now
Suddenly, Conway is startled by the sound of hoof-beats and, looking up, is in time to see 'the girl' of the previous sequence (Sondra) fly by him on a horse - screaming delightedly
As she passes him, she waves
(instantly changing his mind) Well,  think  will take that ride
181
- As he rides off in pursuit of her
182 Showing Sondra successfully eluding him - as he closes in on her
183
- Sondra whizzes by
As we stay on the shot - Conway rides through in exciting pursuit
184 Showing Sondra disappearing behind a mountain waterfall
Conway dashes up, but she is lost from sight
He wheels around several times - and unable to find her, looks puzzled
Finally, giving up, he starts slowly back
After a few moments he is startled by her laughter, and glances around
522
185 From his view - shooting upward
High up - near the summit of the hill - we see Sondra - waving and laughing
Then she swings her horse around and disappears
186
- As he smiles - amused and interested
: 187
- As she swims in a mountain stream, apparently in the buff
From a distance, we see her climb onto a rock to dry off
188
- As she shakes her shimmering hair
189
- He has caught up to her tethered horse and is skulking around trying to find out where she is
190
- squirrel, near to Sondra, chatters excitedly
191
- She can apparently understand the squirrel's warning
She hurries to dive back into the water and swim to the other side
She comes up, spots Conway and watches him from hiding, behind some bushes
192
- Conway has discovered her clothing and is constructing a kind of scarecrow on a bush out of them
As a crowning touch, he adds a flower to the effigy, his eyes twinkling at his little joke
With one final glance over his shoulder, he turns to leave
193
- She stifles her laughter as he vanishes from view
: - 194 Lovett and Barnard are at the table waiting for the others
Several servants are in the b
g
George paces nervously in front of the door
195 Lovett and Barnard
Barnard nibbles at something
Bah
Fossils
Why
What for
Running around digging up a lot of old bones
You didn't dig yourself out of one of those holes by any chance, did you
Lovett is about to reply, when he realizes he is being made fun of, and gives a tentative chuckle
196 Conway is coming down the corridor
George comes out of door to dining room and starts forward
Conway walks along in a cheerful mood, singing as he goes, a Cockney song
523
(forces a smile) You seem gay
Did you find out anything
197 As they walk back toward dining room door
Well -  heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners
Nothing about the porters yet
Porters
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we
'm afraid the porters are just a myth
(tensely) guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners
Shhh
They have reached the door and start into dining room
198 As Conway and George enter, Barnard calls to them: Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - 'm starved
(imitating Chang as he takes his chair) Please
Please
Do not wait for me
eat so very little
Barnard laughs heartily
George, surily silent, enters and drops in his seat
At the same moment, Gloria comes into the room
Good evening
The men greet her, all rising
Well, 'm certainly glad to see that it's all finally organized
(to servant) Okay, handsome
Dish it out, and make it snappy
As he sits, he looks over at Gloria and something in her face arrests him
524
Hey, what's happened to you
(self-consciously) Nothing
Why
Why, you look beautiful
That's unkind
Doesn't Miss Stone always look beautiful
199 Featuring Gloria, Barnard and Conway
(suddenly) got it
It's your make-up
You've got none on
Gloria busies herself with her soup, self-consciously
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better
Wholesome, kind of - and clean
You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again
Why, it's like hiding behind a mask
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask
What do you mean
You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you
Have
It's very strange, you know
You've never told us anything about yourself
Who are you, anyway
Why don't you take your mask off for once
(lightly) Yes
Unbosom yourself, Mr
Hyde
[11] (his face has become serious) All right,  will
'll let my hair down
Why not
It can't make any real difference now
(after a pause) Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police
Lovett is halted in his tracks - soup spoon halfway up to his mouth
Certainly not
525
200
- Believe me, it's no fun
When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year
(skeptical) The police
Uh-huh
(after another pause) Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant
to include the others
They look shocked
(the first one to make the connection) Chalmers Bryant
Bryant's Utilities - that's me
George is the only one unconcerned
He is deeply absorbed in thought - his food has remained untouched
Lovett suddenly explodes
knew it
knew  had a reason for hating you
Sir, you're a thief
He never stole anything from you , did he
have 500 shares of Bryant Utilities that  bought with money that  saved for 20 years teaching school, and now couldn't sell it for postage stamps
201
- Featuring Barnard
That's too bad
got a half million shares
My whole foundation
And now look at me
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny
guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed[12] plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader
And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had
526
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and , for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back
George can't stand it any longer
(suddenly - hoarsely) What do you mean - "when we get back"
The sharpness of his voice startles the others
What makes you think we're ever going to get back
You may not know it, but you're all prisoners here
We were deliberately kidnapped and brought here - and nobody knows why He rises to his feet
Well, 'm not content to be a prisoner
'm going to find out when we're going to get out of this place
(whips out a revolver; grimly) 'll make that Chinese talk if it's the last thing  do
He starts out
202 Before anybody can realize what his intentions are, he has bolted out of the room
(calling) George
Starts after him
203 As George strides determinedly out into the hall, yelling
Chang
Chang
Suddenly he sees a native servant and his eyes pop insanely as he strides across to the servant and grabs him by the shirt-front
(shaking servant violently) Where is he
Where's Chang
Where is he
Where's Chang, or 'll blow your brains out
Conway has caught up with him and wrestles him away from the servant, who stumbles off in fright
George, what do you think you're doing
527
Let me go, Bob
George pushes Conway away from him and starts down the corridor
George, come back
Chang
Chang
Chang
George spies another servant
Come here, you
Come here
The servant, frightened by his voice, turns suddenly and starts running
George levels his revolver and sends a stream of bullets after the fleeing servant, who miraculously manages to skate around a corner, unharmed
Conway runs into scene, reaching George, and with a quick flip of his left hand he smacks him over his revolver arm - and with his right, he punches him flush on the jaw
George, you idiot
George reels for a moment and slumps to the floor
204 As the others trail in
Had to sock him, eh
Conway pockets the gun and, bending over George, a pained expression on his face, starts to lift him
: ' 205 Conway brings George in, followed by the others
He drapes him across his bed
Conway stands by his side, looking down at him, deeply concerned
After a moment, Conway shakes him and George awakens with a start
Let me up
Let me up
All right
Sorry, George
George groans and turns away
206 On Barnard, Lovett and Gloria
Barnard wanders over to Conway, who appears lost in thought
Say Conway, is it true about us being kidnapped
Conway shrugs
528
(louder) say, is it true about us being kidnapped
Conway suddenly is aroused from his reverie by someone he sees off scene
He looks up alertly
Mr
Chang
Chang enters scene, beaming charmingly
Do you mind stepping in here for a moment
207 As Chang enters
He bows courteously to the others, who stand in front of George's bed
Conway shuts the door and turns the key
He crosses to a door leading to another room - and locks this one, also
Chang watches him curiously
The others, including George, who is now alert, are puzzled and somewhat impressed
Then Conway comes to Chang
Won't you sit down
Chang sits, his placidity unchanged
Conway pulls up a chair in front of him
(very quietly) Mr
Chang, you have been very kind to us - and we appreciate it
But for some reason we are being held prisoners here, and we want to know why
208
- , As Conway's voice continues, talking to Chang: Personally,  don't mind at all
'm enjoying every minute of it
(dead serious) But my brother is not of the same opinion, nor are the others
(after a pause) It's time we were told what it's all about
209
- Conway still continuing: We want to know why we were kidnapped, why we are being kept here, but most important of all - do we get the porters, and when
(much too suavely) Until we get this information, my dear Mr
Chang,  am very much afraid we cannot permit you to leave this room
There is a pause while the eyes of all are centered on Chang's face
529
(after a pause) You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor,  was actually on my way to you
bring the most amazing news
(impressively) The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr
Conway
The High Lama
Who in blazes is he
Yeah
though you ran this joint
Mr
Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come
Don't believe him, Bob
He's just trying to get out
Yes
Sounds like a stall to me
One moment
You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information
The only one
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr
Conway
Well, then he's the man  want to see
(to Chang) Will you come along
Conway unlocks the door
When he has opened it, he turns
Better wait here until  get back
We'll soon know where we stand
' 210 With Conway and Chang
Chang walks in a high state of expectancy
Conway is grim
They climb a narrow spiral staircase
530
211 They proceed up the stairs until they arrive at a large, impressively ornate double door which seems to open automatically the moment they approach
Chang remains without
The moment Conway steps over the threshold, the doors swing closed
' [ 13] 212 As the doors swing shut
Conway turns and realizes Chang is no longer with him
213 Conway stands still, glancing around the room, which is lit so dimly that nothing definite is distinguishable
214 To show what Conway sees
For the moment, practically nothing
As his eyes become adjusted to the darkness, he begins to sense the architecture and furnishings of the room
But as yet no sign of life
reveals it to be a dark-curtained and low-ceilinged room, furnished rather simply
Very sombre, indistinct tapestries drape the back walls
While the ' , , a voice is heard
' (soft and friendly) Good evening, Mr
Conway
to the nethermost corner of the room where, scarcely visible, sits an old man of indeterminate age
In the gloom only the outlines of his pale and wrinkled face can be seen
It yields an effect of a fading antique portrait
215
- He stares, motionless, at the eerie vision
216 Please come in
Conway comes forward warily until he stands within a few feet of the old man, his eyes riveted upon him
Sit here, near me
am an old man and can do no one any harm
Are you the High Lama
Yes
217
- As Conway, expressionless, sits down opposite the High Lama
trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival
531
Personally, 've enjoyed your community very much
But my friends do not care for this mystery
They are determined to leave as soon as While he has been speaking, his eyes have been gradually taking in the details of the old man
The - to crutches leaning against the man's throne - then, looking down, to his legs, one of which appears to have been amputated
218
- (awe and amazement) It's astonishing - and incredible, but 219
- What is it, my son
You're the man Chang told me about
You're the first - who - two hundred years ago (reverently) you're still alive, Father Perrault
Sit down, my son
(pause) You may not know it, but 've been an admirer of yours for a great many years
Conway evinces surprise
Oh, not of Conway the empire-builder and public hero
wanted to meet the Conway who in one of his books, said, "There are moments in every man's life when he glimpses the eternal
" The quotation captures Conway's interest - and his eyes widen
That Conway seemed to belong here
In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here
That  be brought here
Who had that brilliant idea
Sondra Bizet
(secretly pleased) Oh, the girl at the piano
Yes
She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all
532
Of course  have suspected that our being here is no accident
Furthermore, have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave
But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly
'll meet that when it comes
What particularly interests me at present is, why was brought here
What possible use can be to an already thriving community
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive
In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you
You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man
Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity
Here, however, in Shangri-La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me
It would have to have a point
've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any
And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless
No, 'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on
We have reason
It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La
It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago
saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy
saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army
foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction
This vision was so vivid and so moving that determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing
(pause) Look at the world today
Is there anything more pitiful
What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership
scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality
The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword
Against that time is why  avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here
For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life
And it is our hope that they may find it here
For here we shall be with their books 533
and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind
(pause) When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world
(pause) Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth
long silence ensues during which Conway, so engrossed is he in all he has just heard, scarcely notices the Lama, who has risen slowly and now stands before him
The Lama reaches down and gently touches him on the shoulder
(scarcely audible) understand you, Father
Conway kisses the High Lama's hand
You must come again, my son
Good night
Conway slowly rises to his feet and turns to leave scene
220
' Conway comes through
He walks as if in a trance
as he continues on his way - bearing an expression of deep absorption
: 221 As Conway walks toward an open door at the end of corridor leading to the garden
Lovett emerges from one of the rooms and sees him
He beckons to those inside and almost immediately they come out and start toward Conway
222 Conway, just about to exit, when the others catch up to him
- We thought you were never coming back
What'd you find out
When do we leave
Conway stares at them blankly
What about the porters
(vaguely) Porters
Didn't you find out anything about the porters
534
Why - 'm sorry - but He starts away from them, but they crowd around him
- What were you doing all this time
You've been gone for hours
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you
You went out there for the purpose of George
George - do you mind
'm sorry, but  can't talk about it tonight
He leaves them
- 223 Shooting toward garden through open doorway
Conway walks away from the crowd in f
g
, all staring at him, nonplussed
We see Conway walk through the garden in b
g
and disappear
224
- He stares at his brother, off, fearfully
225 Of a pleasant and peaceful place
Conway is walking along moodily, drinking in the pastoral beauty
226 As he walks along
He comes to a spot where a man and a woman are tilling the soil, and stops to watch them
The man looks up and, seeing Conway, makes a friendly bow and doffs his hat
Conway also bows
The woman curtsies prettily and smiles
Conway doffs his hat in acknowledgement
He is in a cheerful frame of mind and continues his walk - He greets several other people
Upon seeing him, they also bow and doff their hats
Conway does likewise
- 227 Conway is walking along a street in the valley
It is a quaint thoroughfare, unlike anything we have ever seen before
The small, one-story huts along its very narrow sidewalk are of singularly varied architecture - giving the impression of being "homemade
" As a result of this, no two are alike
Only one characteristic about them is similar - their cleanliness
Something about the atmosphere is fresh and wholesome and peaceful
In front of several of the huts native women sit - some weaving on a tapestry board, some nursing babies, some asleep, and some just sitting
The keynote is contentment
228 With Conway, walking along
As he passes, the women smile at him in the most friendly fashion
From inside these homes, soft and soothing music emanates
At the end of the street, Conway finally arrives at a garden spot
The suddenness of this is startling, too - because of its beauty
Sighing contentedly, Conway throws himself at the foot of an overhanging tree, and leans against the trunk
535
229
- He throws his head back, shuts his eyes - in a restful and contemplative mood
He remains this way quietly for a few seconds, when he is attracted by the singing of a chorus of children's voices
He glances around
230 From Conway's angle
In the shadow of a row of overhanging trees which form an arch, a group of fifteen or twenty children sing a hymn, or nursery song - in English
Sondra (the violin girl of previous scenes) stands in front of them, a baton in hand, conducting them
231
- He smiles at the sight - and springing to his feet starts in their direction
232 Of Sondra and the children, as Conway saunters into the scene behind her
He finds himself a comfortable place under a tree and sits down
The children, still singing, have seen his approach and crane their necks curiously
233
- She waves her baton and sings with the children
Then she notices they are being distracted and casually turns her head
She is somewhat startled at seeing Conway, but quickly recovers her composure, and smiles wanly
234
- He smiles also
Do you mind
235 To include Sondra, Conway and some of the children
They finish the song, and Conway applauds
Sondra curtsies prettily
She turns to the children
This is Mr
Conway, children
236 In unison the twenty children curtsey
(all together - sing-song) Good morning, Mr
Conway
How do you do
Very well, thank you
Conway scrambles to his feet and does an exaggerated bow
Sondra laughs delightedly
All right, children
We will now sing She lifts her baton and the thin, piping voices fill the air
536
237
- He lights a cigarette and, leaning against a tree, studies Sondra's face - impressed by her beauty
238
- She slyly glances backward, and a self-conscious smile covers her face
239 As a child from the ranks breaks and comes to Sondra, who leans down to listen to the child - who whispers in her ear
Sondra, murmuring, "Of course, dear" and still waving her baton is, for the moment, uncertain what to do
Then turning to Conway, holds out the baton to him
Do you mind
Conway snaps out of his reverie and jumps forward
Not at all
He takes the baton from her
Thank you
And, taking the child by the hand, she exits
240
- Conducting the chorus in all seriousness - albeit a trifle awkwardly
He turns his head to watch Sondra, and when he looks forward again, finds himself off-beat
To cover his embarrassment, he smiles foolishly
241 They come to the end of the song, but Conway, whose eyes are searching for Sondra, is oblivious of this and continues to conduct mechanically
The children break into laughter
242 With Sondra as she returns with the child clinging to her
As she turns a bend, she looks up, surprised
243
- As she laughs heartily
244
- All right, children
Now teacher is going to be very busy this afternoon, so school's dismissed
The children break into squeals and race off
as they cross a footbridge, gleefully doff their clothes and with yelps and cries leap into a stream
245
- Favoring Conway
Oh, please
hope you're not going to run away this time
537
(extending her hand) My name's Sondra
hope you'll forgive me for He hears curious, fluttering music coming from somewhere
(looking around) You know, each time  see you,  hear that music
What is it
Oh, you mean my pigeons
swirling overhead
Sondra pulls a miniature flute from one of her pocket
(showing him) It's these little flutes that  attached to their tails
See
Come along with me, and 'll show you how  put them on
They exit scene
246 Of a large coop where pigeons are bred and raised
The pigeons flutter around, landing on Sondra and Conway, as she shows him her collection with pride
She grabs one pigeon and ties one of the miniature flutes to its legs
You see, this is how we tie them on
And by varying the size of the flutes, can get any notes  wish
The wind does the rest
Here's a little fellow who lost his
She grabs another pigeon, ties a flute to its legs
(wonderingly) Was this your idea
Yes
Hold this pigeon
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you
What gave you the idea 'd fit in
That was easy
read your books
Oh, you've read my books
You do more things
What have my books got to do with it
saw a man whose life was empty
538
man whose life was empty
Oh,  know
It was full of this and full of that
But you were accomplishing nothing
You were going nowhere, and you knew it
Conway scrutinizes her face intently
As a matter of fact, all  saw was a little boy whistling in the dark
little boy whistling in the dark
Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr
Conway back to London
Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing
Does that look like a man whose life is empty
(after a pause) Yes
(good-naturedly) You're absolutely right
And  had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it
May  congratulate you
She laughs merrily and shakes his hand
really only brought you here to show you my pigeons
Don't worry about the pigeons
From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet
She turns to leave, and he follows, exiting scene
: 247 Sondra and Conway, walking
This spot is on top of a hill overlooking the splendor of the valley below
248 They walk along silently for a few seconds, while Conway studies her face speculatively
There are so many questions 'd like to ask you,  hardly know where to begin
539
'll help you
To begin with, you'd like to know what 'm doing here
Whether was born here
Thank you
Well,  was almost born here
It took place in that wild country beyond the pass
My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year
When Chang found us, only Father and  were alive
But he was too weak to climb the pass
He died on the way
was brought up here by Father Perrault himself
Father Perrault
envy you
talked to him last night
Yes,  know
Father Perrault
Of course  can't quite get used to this age thing
He steals a sideways glance at her
She is greatly amused
(satisfying his obvious curiosity) 'm thirty
Oh, you're going to make life very simple
249 As they arrive at a scenic overlook
It is getting toward dusk
(wonderingly) It's inconceivable
What is
All of it
Father Perrault and his magnificent history
This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely
'm sorry
thought  was to be the light
But why do  confuse you
Am so strange
On the contrary, you're not strange
And that in itself is confusing
have the same idea about Shangri-La
The sense that 've been here before, that belong here
'm so glad
540
can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar
The very air that breathe
The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal
All the beautiful things see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar
(chuckles to himself) 've been kidnapped and brought here against my will
crime, a great crime, yet  accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend
Why
Can you tell me why
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it
wonder
'm sure of it
Just as 'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart
have never seen the outside world
But  understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy
Yet  just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy
Oh,  just wish the whole world might come to this valley
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long
She laughs as they exit scene
-[14] 250 Barnard is bringing a reluctant Lovett along on an excursion into the Valley
They pass friendly natives and farmers at work
don't know why  associate with you, Mr
Barnard - or Mr
Chalmers Bryant - or Mr
Embezzler - or whatever your name may be
Just call me Barney
Barney
Why should
Never
We have nothing in common
Hmmpf, Barney
What effrontery
Okay, Lovey
541
And this trip to the valley
can't imagine why 'd allow you to drag me down here
Why, we don't know anything about these people
We're not even armed
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns
(alarmed at first) Horns
Barnard points to sheepherders with their long horns
(chuckles) Yeah
You know
Horns
What kind of horns
Lovett sees his point, starts to chuckle, but still looks wary
Here, here
Come on
They won't hurt you
: 251 Barnard has encountered some beautiful native girls, and they have surrounded him with their hospitality - plying him with wine and food
Lovett is off scene
Okay, honey, all  want is a glass of wine
Thanks very much
Please sit down
This is fine
This is swell
No, just a drink
've been walking and 'm a little thirsty, you see
That's all right
don't just happen to be very hungry
Say look, all  asked for was a glass of water
Look here, 've got to have some help with this
(looking around anxiously) Now, Lovey
Where is Lovey
252 Of Lovett, lagging behind and missing out on all the fun
Mr
Barnard
253 Favoring Barnard as Lovett comes into view
Hey Lovey, come here
Lovey,  asked for a glass of wine and look what got
Come on, sit down
542
So that's where you are
might of known it
No wonder you couldn't hear me
You were asked to have a glass of wine
Sit down
And be poisoned out here in the open
Certainly not
(to Lovett) For me, won't you please have a glass of wine
never drink wine in the daytime
(as he is poured a glass anyway) There you are
(raising the glass to his lips) This doesn't obligate me in any way
No
: 254 merry Lovett has had too much to drink
Now he is entertaining a group of native children, who are huddled at his feet
Other natives watch the entertainment
Bernard, watching from one side, is losing patience
then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed
" And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed
" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed
" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary
'm going to sleep in my bed
Come on, Lovey
(continuing) They were in a quandary, and Come on, Lovey
543
Why
Why 'come on' all the time
What's the matter
Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life
Here, drink it up
Aren't you having any fun
Where was
In a quandary
They all laugh
'm telling this story
'm telling it
(continuing) Yes, the poor little bears didn't know what to do, you see, because somebody had been sleeping in their bed
Who slept in their beds
(the one who poured him a drink of wine alluringly) Who was it, Lovey
(smitten) Oh, you call me Lovey, eh
(to Barnard) Look at those eyes
There's the devil in those eyes
: ' 255 Following Lovett as he enters, unusually chipper, singing "Here we go gathering nuts in May
" He is in such a good mood that he improvises the lyrics, putting Shangri-La in with his la-la-las
After glancing out the window, Lovett sits down and pulls out his journal
He writes: : 4TH 24TH   - He pauses, looks up, opens the compact box at his side and looks at himself confidently and admiringly in the mirror
Returning to his journal, he adds: : - 256
() With George as he disconsolately walks
He is startled by the sound of Maria's voice calling him
with him as he crosses to a sheltered spot where Maria sits on a garden bench
544
Hello, Maria
He fumbles for a cigarette
257 (a little hurt) You promised to come for tea yesterday
waited for so long
'm sorry
(chagrined to discover he has no cigarettes left) haven't even got any cigarettes left
'll make some for you
(pleading) You will come today
(after a pause) Perhaps
(tenderly) Please say you will
The days are so very long and lonely without you
(a whisper) Please
All right, 'll be there
(happily) Thank you
(suddenly) You'll tell me some of the things want to know, won't you
You'll tell me who runs this place
And why we were kidnapped
And what they're going to do with us
258
- From the moment he starts to speak, her face clouds
George's voice continues without interruption
' Chang's been lying about those porters, hasn't he
She runs off, frightened
259 Following Conway and Sondra as they stroll peacefully hand in hand amongst the sculpted shrubbery and rows of flowers
There is a sudden pealing of bells
The two of them look off and pause, their gaze momentarily captured by picturesque snowcapped peaks in the distance
545
(moved) Beautiful
'm waiting for the bump
Bump
When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up
She gives him a pinch
Ouch
(chuckling) You see, it's not a dream
You know, sometimes  think that it's the other that's the dream
The outside world
Have you never wanted to go there
Goodness, no
From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive
It's not so bad, really
Some phases are a little sordid, of course
That's only to be expected
Why
Oh, the usual reasons
world full of people struggling for existence
Struggling, why
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on
Why
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere
And don't ask me why
was just going to
It's the most annoying word in the English language
Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it
546
(mimicking) Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl
Why
Because it isn't lady-like to do that
Why
Because that's what forks are made for, darling
(joining in) Why, mother
Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck
Sondra laughs heartily
(teasingly) Would you like to wring my little neck
'd love it
Why
Conway makes a grab for her and she spurts away
He chases her across part of the garden, and past the fountain catches up with her
He reaches to place his hands around her neck
(laughing) 'm sorry
'm very sorry
He hesitates, studying her intently
260
- They kiss
(when they break) 've thought about it for years
(softly) knew you'd come
And  knew if you did - you'd never leave
(a whisper) Am  forgiven for sending for you
Forgiven
(a pause) You know, when we were on that plane, was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it
That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane
It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed
And 've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and 'm that silly shadow
That all my life 've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms
547
They kiss again
: 261 Chang is being visited by Lovett, who has lost his petrified manner
Amazing, Mr
Chang
This place is amazing
And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent
Oh, 've looked around
've seen everything
Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy
Yes
You may not know it, Mr
Chang, but right here you have Utopia
[15] You've very kind Mr
Lovett
262
- don't mean it in that sense
only give credit where credit is due
(pauses - sincerely) Er, Mr
Chang, 'm very anxious to have you realize that  never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story
Oh, 'm so glad
Simply preposterous
Do you know what did last night
Last night, Mr
Chang, held a sort of a self-inventory said to myself last night, Mr
Chang, said, "Lovey" (catches himself - looks around) Mr
Lovett
"Mr
Lovett,"  said, "you are an ungrateful fool
" Why, no
"Ungrateful fool
" Those were my very words to myself last night
"Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation
" Now, what would you like to do
548
Well, Mr
Chang,  thought, with your permission of course, and while 'm waiting for these porters,  would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful
Geology
Splendid
Isn't it
Isn't it
You know  was a professor for twenty years
- and a very good one
'm sure you were
When would you like to start
Oh, immediately
(offering his handshake) Then it's done
Oh, thank you
Thank you
Thank you
263 Conway sits on a bench - Barnard leans over him, showing him a map - a-twitter with an idea
You see
You get the idea
From this reservoir here  can pipe in the whole works
Oh, 'm going to get a great kick out of this
Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here,  can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there
Can rig it up in no time
(aghast) Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water
264
- (a twinkle in his eye) It's unbelievable
Think of it
In times like these
Say, what about that gold deal
Huh
549
Gold
You were going to (interrupting) Oh - that
That can wait
Nobody's going to run off with it
(full of business) Say, 've got to get busy
want to show this whole layout to Chang
(exiting) So long
Don't you take any wooden nickels
All right
He disappears
We hear him whistling, something joyous
Probably "The Old Gray Mare Ain't What She Usta Be" 265
- As he watches Barnard go, pleased at the metamorphosis that's taking place in him
Suddenly he sees George and jumps up
George
266 From Conway's angle
George has just made his appearance
George
George keeps on going and Conway runs toward him
267 As Conway catches up to Georgeand takes him by the arm
(sincerely) George - you're behaving like a child
You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks
(coldly) don't see that there's anything to say
And releasing his arm, he leaves Conway abruptly
268
- As a look of deep pain comes into his face
He stands for several seconds - looking helplessly - and despairingly in George's direction
: 269 Chang and Conway playing chess
Conway leans over the board, a faraway expression on his face
Chang leans over - moves a 'man' into position
550
'm afraid that does it
Conway looks up - aroused from his reverie
He glances over the board
Yes
'm afraid it does
Shall we have another
(rises) No thanks
Not tonight if you don't mind
He crosses to a window and glances out
Chang looks up and sees Maria in doorway
Come in, my dear
270
- In doorway
She seems slightly embarrassed
Sorry
didn't mean to interrupt
(self-consciously) thought Mr
Conway's brother was here
Excuse me
She leaves
271
- Charming, isn't she
Yes, charming
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her
Why not
She's an attractive young woman
Young
She arrived here in 1888
She was 20 at the time
She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains
The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people
(hands in the air) Amazing
She still doesn't look over 20
When is she likely to grow old in appearance
Not for years
Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely
Suppose she should leave it
551
Leave Shangri-La
That's not likely
You couldn't drive her out
No,  mean about her appearance
If she should leave the valley - what would happen
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age
(shaking his head) It's weird
(a pause) Chang, how old are you
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves
You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds
They are interrupted by the entrance of George
(stridently) Oh, there you are
You're just the man 'm looking for
272 As George comes up to them
He is livid with rage
He crosses directly to in front of Chang
fine trick
Smart, aren't you
What a pack of lies you told us about those porters
Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave
If they take us
But you knew very well you'd tell them not to
273
- Now, my dear boy
You shouldn't (snapping at him) You've been lying to us ever since we got here
Apparently it's worked with some people
Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it
But not me, Chang
You're up against the wrong man
'll get out of here, if  have to blow this fantastic place into the valley
'll get outporters or no porters
And with this threat, he storms out of the room
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey
He could never get through that country alive
552
(tensely) can't let him go alone
It's suicide
He exits abruptly
Chang watches him depart, deeply upset
' 274 Conway sits in the same place before the Lama
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem
It was to be expected
knew you'd understand
That's why came to you for help
You must not look to me for help
Your brother is no longer my problem
He is now your problem, Conway
Mine
Because, my son,  am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La
(pause) For  am going to die
There is a pause during which Conway cannot conceal his amazement at this simple statement
knew my work was done when  first set eyes upon you
275
- Conway is too awed and impressed to utter a sound
The High Lama finally resumes
have waited for you, my son, for a long time
have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers
have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that  might find you
My friend, it is not an arduous task that  bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds
To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without
Do you think this will come in my time
553
276
- You, my son, will live through the storm
You will preserve the fragrance of our history, and add to it a touch of your own mind
Beyond that, my vision weakens
(pause - magisterially) But  see in the great distance a new world starting in the ruins - stirring clumsily - but in hopefulness, seeking its vast and legendary treasures
And they will all be here, my son, hidden behind the mountains in the Valley of the Blue Moon, preserved as if by a miracle
The voice of the Lama, toward the last, seems to fade out
Conway, thoroughly engrossed, half-consciously waits for it to continue
Following a protracted silence, he slowly turns toward the Lama
breeze blows through the room, ruffling curtains on the window
277
- From whose face the glow has faded
There is nothing left but a dark-shadowed mask
278
- He stares, uncertainly, for a long while, with a slow realization that the High Lama is dead
Quite unaware that he is being moved emotionally, tears well up in his eyes
While still sitting this way, unable to stir, he becomes conscious of activity around him
279 As two servants, unbeckoned, arrive - only to peer, solemn-faced, at the Lama
Then, in intervals of seconds, groups of Lamas, hitherto unseen, enter softly and silently, and gather around the High Lama
We hear indistinguishable murmurs that might or might not be prayers
Conway is only vaguely aware of their presence - and after a few moments, scarcely conscious of what is actuating his movements, he drifts away from the murmuring Lamas, and walks in the direction of the door
: ' 280 Barnard and Gloria are on their knees on the floor
Before them they have spread a large map or chart
Barnard is enthusiastically out - lining his plans
Look, honey
We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here
Pipes
Where are you going to get pipes
Oh, that's a cinch
'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay
This is as far as they get for George at this moment barges in
554
There you are
Barnard, you'd better get your things together
We're leaving
Leaving
Yes
've just been talking with the porters
They're going to take us
We've got clothing, food, everything
Come on
When are you going to start
Right this very minute
The porters are waiting for us on the plateau
And that Chinaman thought he could stop me
Come along
think 'll stick around
'll leave with the porters on their next trip
You mean you don't want to go
Well - 'm see
You're afraid of going to jail, eh
Well, no
You see,  got this plumbing business All right
If you insist on being an idiot, 'm not going to waste time coaxing you
(to Gloria) How about you
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey
(before she can answer) She'll stick around too
(to Gloria) Is that right
(beaming) If you want me to
Sure - sure
Don't you worry
'll take care of you
All right, suit yourself
But just remember you had your chance
555
As he starts out, Lovett enters
How about you
Do you want to go
Go
Where
Home
Away from here
've got porters to take us back
281
- Oh, my dear boy, 'm sorry
That's impossible
Why,  have my classes all started
(irritably) don't care what you've got started
Do you want to go
Well - no -  think 'd better wait
Yes, yes
will
'll wait
(grumbling as he goes) You'll wait till you rot
(glowering after him) Yes
(does a double-take) Barney
Lovey
Lovett immediately dismisses George from his mind and his face brightening, he starts toward Barnard and Gloria
282 As Lovett joins the two on the floor
Hello, Gloria
Hello
Barney, 've just finished translating one of the most interesting old tablets you can imagine
It told me all about the origin of the Masonic symbols and That's swell, Lovey
want to show you something
Look
He proudly displays his map
556
Oh my, isn't that pretty
What is it
Plumbing
Everything modern
'm going to run pipes all through the village As all three heads go into a huddle
' 283 Conway stands in front of a window - his arms extended across - peering out moodily
He is watching a solemn and slow-moving procession of torchlight-bearers - the funeral rites of the High Lama - accompanied by cermonial music and drum-beating
284 Shooting over his shoulder
Getting his view of the magisterial procession
285 Conway, as he thoughtfully surveys the surroundings of which he has just become master
286
- George appears in the doorway
He looks around and espies Conway
For a moment he stands uncertainly, and finally enters
(softly) Bob 287 As Conway turns - and seeing him, evinces no emotion whatsoever
(a murmur) Hello, George
George looks at him peculiarly
Conway's behavior is odd in view of their strained relationship
Well, you can stop worrying about everything now, Bob
've made arrangements to leave
If you'll let me close that window, can talk to you
That noise is driving me crazy
He closes the window
said we're getting out of here
Back to civilization
made a deal with the porters
They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn
They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley
Come on, get your things together
Where's your top coat
288
- You can't leave, George
557
Why not
What's going to stop me
(pleading) You mustn't
You've got to stay here now
(sharply) Stay here
(more softly) What's the matter with you, Bob
You've been acting strangely ever since we came here
(no response from Conway) 've never seen you like this
Why can't we leave
What's stopping us
Conway combats an impulse to tell him the whole story
(impulsively) Something grand and beautiful, George
Something 've been searching for all my life
The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime
've found it, George, and  can't leave it
You mustn't either
don't know what you're talking about
You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up
If you'll only tell me about it
will, George
want to tell you
'll burst with it if  don't
It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful
(pause) Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here
While he is speaking, we slowly : 289
: As Conway is concluding his story
And that's the whole story, George
He died as peacefully as the passing of a cloud's shadow
His last words to me were, " place in your hands, my son, the future and destiny of Shangri-La
" Now you know why  can't leave
George listens to him intently, his face a mask of apprehension
He stares at his brother for some time and finally rises and walks around for a few moments
(running his hand through his hair) Well,  -  really don't know what to say
Except that you must be completely mad
558
So you think 'm mad
What else can  think after a tale like that
Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today
We're living in the twentieth century
So you think it's all nonsense, huh
290
- think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics
Why, wouldn't believe it if  heard it in an English monastery
Why should swallow it here in Tibet
How do you know the things they told you are true
Did they show you any proof
don't need any proof
(contemptuously) knew there was a reason  hated this place
'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you
How do you know the things they told you are true
Did they show you any proof
All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old
How do you know
Did you see their birth certificates
(some more pacing) can't believe it, Bob
bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world
And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on-the-ground Conway - want to join them
It's horrible
Is that all my story meant to you
What else could it mean to me
It's obviously a lot of bunk
Then you'd better go, George
This is no place for you
It's no place for you, Bob
Think of what's waiting for you
Do you want to stay here until you're half dead
Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them
Please, George
don't want to talk about it anymore
559
You've got to talk about it
What about me
You said they stole that plane to bring you here
didn't want to come
You owe me some responsibility
'm tired of owing you things
You're free to go
Go ahead
(suddenly) It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned Enough
Never mind the girl
(a tense moment of silence) Well, why don't you go
Conway has sunk into a chair
George kneels before him, pleading
Look here, Bob, Ever since  can remember, you've looked after me
Now  think you're the one that needs looking after
'm your brother, Bob
If there's something wrong with you, let me help you
(a murmur) Oh, George
Besides,  -  don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you
'd go mad
(after a moment's hesitation) George,  may be wrong,  may be a maniac
But  believe in this, and 'm not going to lose it
(warmly) You know how much  want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love
'm sorry, George
'm staying
(after a long pause) Well,  can't think of anything more to say
Goodbye, Bob
They shake hands warmly
George turns to leave
560
(just as George reaches the door) George, are you sure of the porters
About their taking care of you,  mean
(turning back) Oh yes
It's all set
Maria made the arrangements
(glances up - surprised) Maria
Yes, the little Russian girl
What's she got to do with it
She's going with me
Conway looks his extreme amazement
(suddenly - wild) George, you're crazy
As he says this he jumps to his feet
George is startled by his tone and manner
(wheeling) You can't take her away from here
(confidently) Why not
(strongly) Because you can't
Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La
She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved
Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo
(slowly) What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"
She came here in 1888
291
- Favoring George
He laughs hollowly
He runs his hand through his hair
He stares unbelievingly at Conway
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic
Why, she isn't a day over twenty
561
You're wrong, George
'm not wrong
She told me so
Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me
'd know anyway
(significantly) found out a lot of things last night
(quickly) 'm not ashamed of it either
It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place
292
- Conway stares at him
(cynically) So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La
Nobody would ever think of leaving
(vehemently) It's all just so much rot
She's pleaded with me ever since  came here to take her away from this awful place
She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear 'd leave her behind
And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me
(doesn't want to believe it) don't believe it
don't believe a word of it
All right
'll prove it to you
You believe everything they've told you - without proof
'll prove my story
As he speaks he has crossed to door leading to adjoining room
Conway's eyes are glued on him
Come in a minute
After a few seconds Maria appears in the doorway and stands there timidly
Come in
She steps forward
293
- (shrewdly) 've got some bad news for you, Maria
My brother and  have decided we can't take you along
Maria's face collapses
562
(small, frightened voice) You can't take me
She rushes to George and throws her arms around him
But you promised me
You promised to take me with you
Over her shoulder George looks victoriously at Conway, who cannot believe his ears
Suddenly Maria wheels on Conway
It's all your fault
It was all arranged until he spoke to you
Why can't you leave us alone
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La
'll die if  have to stay here another minute
've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now
If  have to, 'll go alone
It was  who bribed the porters
If it weren't for me, you'd never get out
thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone
The High Lama
Who pays any attention to him
The porters laugh at the High Lama
All they want to know is how much gold he will give them
Well,  gave them more gold
've been stealing it for a year
'd do anything to get out of this place
To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault
Why, he's been insane for years
Father Perrault is dead
He's dead
That's fine
You won't see me shedding any tears over him
(pleading) Oh George, you must take me with you
(quietly) Aren't you afraid to leave
You don't want to look like an old woman, do you
Old woman
Chang told you that, didn't he
Yes
563
thought so
He tells everyone 'm old
He wants them to stay away from me
He can't stand it when anyone comes near
He's punished me for every minute 've spent with George
If it weren't for him,  would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me
Six months ago,  tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room
nearly went crazy
(pause) Look at me, Mr
Conway, do  look like an old woman
Is this the skin of an old woman
Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob
(thrown) don't believe it
can't believe it
She's lying
(wildly) You're lying
You're lying
Every word you've been saying is a lie
Come on, say it
He has backed her into a corner and is nearly throttling her
You're lying, aren't you
No, Mr
Conway, 'm not lying
What reason could  have for lying
The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but 'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now
Thoroughly disillusioned, Conway emits a few cynical chuckles - shakes his head - stares blankly for a moment
(dead voice) You say the porters are waiting for us
Yes
The clothes
(alertly) Yes, everything
What about the others
564
've already asked them
They're afraid to make the trip
We'll have to send an expedition back after them
(business-like) Come on
We're wasting time
Conway dashes around and collects his things
Are you taking me
Yes, of course
Certainly
Come on
They start out the door and we
: 294 Conway, George and Maria on their way out of the main building
The funeral procession continues around them
The two men walk together, Maria behind
George is cheerful and buoyant
It won't be long now before we're in London
Can't you just see everyone when we pop out of the blue
Conway's jaw is set grimly
295 As Conway, George and Maria continue
We'll have them breathless when they hear our story
While he speaks, Conway turns his head around, looking for a glimpse of Sondra
296
- As he hurries out of the building and looks out at them from a roof terrace
297
- As he continues to look back in Sondra's direction, although he keeps in step with George
' You had me worried for a while
thought you were gone completely
Conway turns his head away
298
() Conway, George and Maria
George glances up at Conway
565
(sincerely - grinning) Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too
You saved my life
never could have made it alone
What was that
was saying Can't you shut up
Must you go on babbling like an idiot
George looks up, startled
299 Sondra has come running out to stand anxiously beside Chang
300 Sondra and Chang
What's happened
Where's Bob
He's going, my child
Going
But he will return
Oh no
No
Bob
Shouting, she rushes off and the as she races down a long flight of stairs, calling out Conway's name
301
- As she runs, calling out Conway's name and weeping
302 Showing Conway, George and Maria - accompanied by a dozen or more porters - as they approach the mountain opening where they first entered Shangri-La
303
- He hesitates at the opening, looks back one more time
His eyes show confusion and defeat
George, ahead, calls out to him to hurry
304
- As she stumbles up the trail to the opening, minutes behind
The wind howls on the other side
She cries and weeps, calling out Conway's name, but he can no longer be seen
566
: 305 Which should be a group of portraits - showing the group's seemingly impossible journey back to civilization
These pictures should be accompanied by music in the appropriate mood
306 Accompanied by the porters, they trudge laboriously through snow-ridden plains
: 307 The whole caravan are seen in the distance, clambering up a mountain-side - hoisted by ropes
: 308 In the middle of a vast plain
They attempt to put up tents, which proves futile, as a raging snowstorm rips the canvas from its moorings
: 309 The large group are seen lowering themselves in single file down a ledge alongside a ravine
The wind howls
: 310 mountain pass somewhere with a hailstorm swiping viciously across their faces
They edge their way pre-cautiously across a narrow ledge
Suddenly the girl loses her bearings - slips - screams - and is caught by Conway just in time to save her from falling down the side of the jagged mountain
: 311
- Maria has one arm around George and the other around Conway - limping
She has her head down
They trudge silently
The porters are off in the distance, leaving them behind
(collapsing) can't stand it
can't go on anymore
've got to rest
She stumbles and they help her up
George looks off toward the porters helplessly
(hysterical) How long is this going to go on
can't stand it,  say
312 Of the porters, laughing at their distress
567
313
- Bob, can't you get them to wait for us
They're leaving us farther behind every day
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on
(to Maria - gently) Come on
No,  can't
can't
You've got to let me rest
You've got to let me rest
(calling out to the porters) Hey
314 Of the porters, still laughing
The lead porter whips out a gun and fires at them for sport
315
- They are in no danger
The porters are too far off
(contemptuously) Target practice again
One of these days they're going to hit us
(wryly) As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe
(to Maria) Come now, child
They start to move again
316 Of the porters
They are still laughing, and now others have drawn out their guns
Firing off wildly, they trigger an ominous thunder overhead
317
- Looking up, they see an avalanche beginning
318 Of the avalanche, picking up strength and fury as it crashes downhill, sweeping over the porters and crushing them to death
319
- An immense silence comes over them
Conway and George can only stare, dazed and frightened
The only sound is Maria, sobbing
: 320
- scene in which Conway carries the girl on his back
George walks behind
The wind continues to howl
568
321
- Staring at the girl's face as it hangs over Conway's back
Suddenly, his eyes widen
322
- distorted view of her
Youth and beauty seem to be vanishing
323
- His eyes are glued on her
(a frightened whisper) Bob
Bob
Look at her face, Bob
Her face
Look at her face
: 324
- On the backs of the two men, who bend over Maria
as they straighten up
Both stare down aghast at the girl, whom we do not see
325 To include the girl
326 The only illumination comes from the moon
We cannot get a clear view of her face
But what we see seems to us to be small, withered and aged
She is dead
The men stare at her intently
327
- Who watch her, immobile
George looks despairing
Slowly his head turns toward the cliff behind him - and his eyes become alert with an idea
His face lights up with great determination
He lets out a piteous howl, and breaks away, racing out of scene
Conway turns sharply and is horrified
George
George
328 George stumbling toward the cliff, Conway chasing him
George, falling head over heels, rocking on the edge - then plummeting over, falling down, down into the darkness
329 Conway, at the end of the cliff, peering starkly downward
: 330 As Conway soldiers on, alone, through howling wind and snow
: 331
- On Conway, struggling against a cyclonic wind
He tops a rise, stumbles, falls over, and rolls down the mountainside, until finally he comes to a stop, mounded by snow
Slowly, he begins to rise and start again
569
: 332 As the sun comes up, Conway emerges from the whiteness, feeling his way forward with a walking stick
He walks with the pain and effort of a blind man, and just as he manages to cross a bridge spanning a great chasm, the bridge collapses
He stumbles on
: 333 Conway, looking haggard and more dead than alive, stumbles out onto more dry and level terrain
He collapses to the ground
- 334 group of Chinese in front of huts
They look up, see something off and commence shouting excitedly in their native tongue
335 Conway's body from their angle
: 336 Newspaper headlines: "Conway Found Alive in Chinese Mission" Similar headlines follow
Newsboys hawk bulletin editions to milling crowds
Top-level government dignitaries confer
: 337
- passing a series of desks and clerks until it reaches a clerk who is opening several cablegrams
Finally he comes to one which causes his eyes to pop
Muttering something under his breath which sounds like "Good heavens
" - and without taking his eyes off the cablegram, he rises and starts away
338
- As he strides across to the end of the outer office - to a glass-panelled door upon which we read " " - through which he disappears
339 As the clerk enters, full of excitement
Cable from Gainsford
Oh, read it
570
(reading) "Leaving today for London with Conway aboard
Manchuria
Conway can tell nothing of his experiences
Is suffering from complete loss of memory
Signed, Gainsford
" Loss of memory
All right, give it to the press
All of it
Yes
Might as well - all of it
Yes, sir
'll dispatch a convoy to meet him
340 More newspaper headlines reporting that Conway has amnesia and other details of his homeward journey
: 341 Another clerk enters with haste, bearing another cablegram
Conway's gone again
Run out
Listen to this
From Gainsford
Let me have it
(takes it and reads aloud) "Aboard the
Manchuria
Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory
Kept talking about Shangri-La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet
Insisted upon returning there at once
Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore
Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition
Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which  am forwarding
Lord Gainsford
" 342 More newspaper headlines indicating Gainsford has abandoned his pursuit of Conway and returned to London
571
: 343 scattering of men are present - some at the bar - others at tables
344 Several men are seated
(looking off) Here's Gainsford now
They all look off
345 From their view
We see Gainsford standing in the doorway, looking around
He spies them and starts forward
346 As Gainsford arrives at the booth
The men rise with extended hands
- Well, it's good to see you back, Lord Gainsford
Thought you were never coming
Will you have a drink
Sit down
347 As Gainsford shakes hands with them, and sits down
Yes
Scotch and soda
'm parched
Here you are, ready and waiting
He pushes on in front of him
We're most eager to know what you've discovered
- Any news of Conway
Where is he
Did you bring him back
All this is said as Gainsford drains his glass
(setting glass down) Gentlemen, you see before you a very weary old man, who has just ended a chase that lasted nearly ten months
Do you mean to tell me you never caught up with him
572
Since that night that he jumped off the ship until two weeks ago, 've been missing him by inches
You don't mean it
- Think of it
He was as determined as that to get back
Determined
Gentlemen, in the whole course of my life,  have never encountered anything so grim
During these last ten months, that man has done the most astounding things
He learned how to fly, stole an army plane and got caught, put into jail, escaped
all in an amazingly short space of time
But this was only the beginning of his adventures
(leaning forward) He begged, cajoled, fought, always pushing forward to the Tibetan frontier
Everywhere went,  heard the most amazing stories of the man's adventures
Positively astounding
Until eventually,  trailed him to the most extreme outpost in Tibet
348 Favoring the other men, as Gainsford continues
Of course he had already gone
But his memory - ah - his memory will live with those natives for the rest of their lives
The Man Who Was Not Human, they called him
They'll never forget the devil-eyed stranger who six times tried to go over a mountain pass where no other human being dared to travel, and six times was forced back by the severest storms
They'll never forget the madman who stole their food and clothing - whom they locked up in their barracks - but who fought six of their guards to escape
349 Gainsford still continues
Why, their soldiers are still talking about their pursuit to overtake him, and shuddering at the memory
He led them the wildest chase through their own country, and finally he disappeared over that very mountain pass that they themselves dared not travel
(takes a drink) And that, gentlemen, was the last that any known human being saw of Robert Conway
573
Think of it
By jove, that's what  call fortitude
Tell me something, Gainsford
What do you think of his talk about Shangri-La
Do you believe it
(thinks a moment) Yes - yes,  believe it
(sincerely) believe it, because  want to believe it
They all watch his face, impressed by his tone
350
- As he lifts his glass
Gentlemen,  give you a toast
Here is my hope that Robert Conway will find his Shangri-La
351 They all raise their glasses
(softly) Here is my hope that we all find our Shangri-La
They are all impressed by the sincerity in his voice - and as their glasses come together - - and as the music starts - the picture : - 352 - as he walks forward with a steady step - his head held high - his eyes sparkling - snow pelting his face
353 Over his silhouetted back
As he walks away from the , and we    a long time as he approaches a hill
: 354 He has now ascended to the middle of the steep hill - his gait unchanged
to the summit of the incline - and we see that beyond it the horizon is filled with a strange warm light
