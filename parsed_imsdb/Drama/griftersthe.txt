Second Draft
March 1989 ----------------------------------------------------------------------- : - establishing the race track, Ruidoso Downs (pronounced Ree-oh-do-so), set among the beautiful mountains of New Mexico's Lincoln National Forest, as a white Chrysler turns in with a stream of cars moving toward the parking area
through the open driver-side window of the Chrysler at  , 39 but looking younger, beautiful but cold and watchful
, track in b
g
as Lilly parks the Chrysler, gets out, locks the car
As she walks toward the track, , as     from the left Lilly as she walks across the large parking area
: - Downtown Los Angeles, near the courts and the business section
, 25, handsome and charming but self indulgent, parks his orange Honda convertible, gets out, picks up a large ledger book from the back seat, goes around to open the trunk
on the trunk, establishing the tools of the salesman's trade: catalogs, samples, ledgers full of manuals and product sheets
Roy adds the ledger from the back seat, shuts the trunk, walks away
6TH  - Roy walks around the corner near a bar/restaurant
As he approaches it,  , the two half-width scenes contracting to one-third each as     from the right
: Lilly approaches the track's entrance doors
: Roy approaches the bar
: - baby blue Cadillac parks in front of a jeweler
on the driver's door as  , 36, beautiful in an impersonal calculating way, gets out, carrying a small jewelry care, and locks the car
At first glance, Myra looks rather like Lilly
(Myra always wears large dangly earrings, and usually wears big-lensed dark sunglasses
) : : Lilly enters the track
: Roy enters the bar
: Myra enters the jeweler's
, as   takes
- on a hurried bartender in a full bar, crowded with a lunchtime crowd
In b
g
, Roy slithers his way to the bar, waving a bill in the air to attract the bartender's attention
on Roy as the bartender comes to him
Roy puts the bill on the bar, holding it down with one finger, as he his order
The bartender looks down
' : Roy's finger holds down a twenty dollar bill
steep over Roy's shoulder, the twenty visible, as the bartender hurries away to get the drink
Roy's hand makes a fist, swallowing the twenty, opens, pushing a ten out onto the bar, holding it there with one finger
on the bartender returning with a draft beer, nodding to other  shouted to him along the way, putting the beer down, grabbing the bill without looking at it, hurrying away
on Roy, content, smiling, sipping his beer
on the bartender, hurrying by, slapping Roy's change down, moving on, Roy nodding acknowledgement, reaching out
, the change, a ten dollar bill on top
Roy's hand closes over it
- , the tote board at the track, showing the shifting odds on the horses for the next race, the amounts bet
, number 3
Not much bet, odds 70-1
- on Lilly, frowning at the tote board
She carries a large heavy shoulder-bag, which she opens, looking in it as though it were a file drawer
on Lilly studying the contents of her bag, the track beyond her, the mountains visible out beyond the track wall
Lilly moves
on a high-dollar betting window, as Lilly approaches, taking bank-banded wads of bills from her bag
- change of numbers sweeps across the board
- Lilly moves away from the betting window, tucking betting tickets into her bag
, Lilly's bag, compartmented, with stacks of money, small envelopes and notes on notepaper in each compartment
Lilly carefully files the betting slips
on Lilly looking out at the tote board
- , number 3
Odds 32-1
- on Lilly, not satisfied
She turns and goes back
at the betting window as Lilly arrives and makes more bets
- , number 3
Odds 32-1
The numbers shift: odds 26-1
(
) And they're off
'  - Very quiet, stately; abrupt contrast with the track
slow ticking clock
Myra sits in the client's chair, while at the desk sits the , a pleasant but overweight man of 40, who studies a jeweled bracelet through a loupe
He sighs, drops the loupe, shakes his head regretfully
Mrs
Langtry, 'm sorry
Why
What's wrong
(personal emotion mixed in) You are a valued customer, as you know
But what's wrong
can't understand a thing like this
It's something you almost never see
What is
(holding up bracelet) This is some of the finest filigreed platinum 've ever seen
But the stones, no
They're not diamonds, Mrs
Langtry
But they must be
They cut glass
(wry) Glass will cut glass, Mrs
Langtry
Do you know where it was purchased
- An expensive hotel room, with a sunstruck day beyond the windows
Myra, naked, a few years younger, sits cross-legged on the bed and laughs at  "" , 55, stringy bodied, who stands naked, his back to us, hands on hips, presenting himself to Myra
She reaches forward, hand hidden by his body as she lifts something that was hanging on something at the front of him
She brings back the bracelet, looks at it, is delighted, puts it on, and then leans forward again toward the unmoving Cole, her head hidden by his body
'  - It was a gift
It isn't worth anything at all
(warm, encouraging) Why, of course it is
can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars
Myra expected -- and needed -- a lot more
She's worried, tense, but stuck
She nods
All right
(rising) 'll get you a check
He leaves the room
Myra grimaces, in almost physical pain
- Another crowded lunchtime bar
big beefy  moves quickly, carrying a draft beer
on Roy, in position, finger holding bill down, as the bartender arrives, puts down the beer, reaches for the bill, stops, stares at the bill
, the bartender and Roy, as the bartender gives Roy a very cold look
He knows, and Roy knows he knows
Roy tries an innocent smile, which doesn't work
Roy moves
, the ten dollar bill, as Roy grabs it, but the bartender simultaneously grabs Roy's wrist
on Roy and the bartender as Roy tries to pull away and the bartender holds him with his left hand while reaching under the bar with his right
He comes up with a sawed-off baseball bat
Roy, seeing it, throws his free arm up to protect his head, but the bartender pushes the blunt end of the bat straight across the bar at a downward angle and hard into Roy's solar plexus, driving the air out of him and propelling him back away from the bar, leaving the ten
The nearest  on both sides become aware that something happened, but nothing follows and they're already involved in conversations
The bartender scoops up the ten as he puts the bat away under the bar
on Roy, arms folded across his torso, staring in shock toward the bar, where the space he filled has already been closed in by other bodies
Nearly retching, he stumbles toward the door
- on four  at a table,  a race, switching to disgust and despair when they lose, moving away from the table, leaving their betting tickets behind
Lilly passes by, smoothly and casually scoops up the tickets, moves on along a row of tables, and there finding more tickets
'  - Myra sits as before
The jeweler enters with a check, which he hands her
She looks up at him, making no move to leave
hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs
Langtry
It's not your fault
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again,  hope
If there's anything you think we might be interested in
have only one thing now
Are you interested
Well, 'd have to see it, of course
You are seeing it
You're looking right at it
The jeweler is puzzled, then startled
see
He turns away, goes behind his desk, sits down, looks at Myra
You know something, Mrs
Langtry bracelet like that very rarely happens
fine setting and workmanship usually mean precious stones
It always hurts me when find they're not
always hope -- (faint sad friendly smile) -- 'm mistaken
Myra likes him better now, even though he hasn't solved her problem
She rises
Thank you
For everything you felt you could do
- Roy has been throwing up but is finished now
He's sprawled like a shot deer across the hood of his Honda, still clutching his stomach
police car stops, the passenger gets out
He's suspicious at first
Sir
Everything all right
The sight of the uniform forces Roy into gear
He straightens, smiling through his pain
Getting better
bad shrimp, think
The con's suspicion changes to concern
Want us to take you to a doctor
No no, 'm fine now, thanks, anyway
Still got a lot of clients to see
Take it easy, now
Oh,  will
- Late afternoon
on the parking area, where almost all the cars are gone and the few remaining are widely separated
The white Chrysler is one of these
Lilly walks to it from the track entrance
on the Chrysler as Lilly opens the trunk, puts her bag inside
, Lilly and the trunk
She takes betting tickets from her bag, sorts them, files them in envelopes in different compartments, puts some to one side, then sorts through these separated tickets, throwing some away, keeping some
She takes money from the bag, puts tickets in, closes the bag with the money on the trunk floor
Reaching farther in, she lifts the pad deep inside the trunk, lifts the metal floor panel, and reveals a cache mostly filled with money
She adds today's skim, puts everything away, puts the bag back on her shoulder, closes the trunk
- shabby apartment hotel on Wilshire
An exterior hall balcony on each floor has the entrance doors to the front apartments
Roy's Honda makes the turn and enters the basement garage
- Modest but clean
The owner, , a sloppy garrulous old bore, talks with a potential
Put it this way, now
Say  rent to a woman, well, she has to have a room with a bath
insist on it, because otherwise she's got the hall bath tied up all the time, washing her goddamn hair and her clothes and everything she can think of
In b
g
, Roy, still in pain, comes out of the elevator, waves to Simms, who waves back without pausing in his monologue, and crosses to the mailboxes
Now, your minimum for a room with bath is three hundred a month, just for a place to sleep and no cooking allowed
And just how many of these tootsies make that kind of money and have to eat in restaurants and buy clothes and -- Roy, carrying his junk mail and pretending not to be in pain, crosses to Simms
Mr
Simms
(fawning) Why yes, Mr
Dillon
Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at-- (uninterested) Uh-huh
Mrs
Langtry may drop by
Simms doesn't like Mrs
Langtry, but can't say so
'll send her right up
Roy goes back to the elevator
Simms continues his monologue
had my first hotel thirty-seven years ago in Wichita Falls, Texas, and that's where  began to learn about women
They just don't make the money, you see, not regular they don't, and there's only one way they can get it
Roy enters the elevator
Now, that Mr
Dillon there, that's the fine type of person  have in mind for here
Like yourself, have no doubt
He's a salesman, regular as clockwork, has a suite here
Fine man
Now, about these women
At first, you know, they just go out and do it now and then, just enough to make ends meet
But pretty soon they got that bank open twenty-four hours a day, and then you've got trouble
Hookers and hotellin' just don't mix
You'd think the cops'd be too busy catching real criminals, not snooping around after working girls, but that's the way the gravy stains, as the saying is, and don't fight it
An ounce of prevention is my motto
Myra enters from the front, looks across at Simms, points upward
Simms calls to her
Oh, yes, Mrs
Langtry, he's up there, he's expecting you
Myra crosses to the elevator
Simms speaks more softly
If you keep out the women in the first place, see, you keep out the hookers, and then you keep out the cops, and that's how you have a clean place
'  - along the balcony, with Roy's apartment door in f
g
and Los Angeles in b
g
Myra crosses to the door, opens it with her key, enters
- small crowded old-fashioned bathroom
Roy, shirt open and trousers pushed down almost to his crotch, looks in the mirror at purplish greenish bruises on his stomach
He touches his stomach, winces
(
) Roy
He looks at the door, then grins at his reflection
Your medicine is here
He leaves the bathroom
- Hotel furniture, shabby and anonymous
On the walls, contrasting with everything else, are two crying-clown pictures on black velvet, mounted in big boxy frames
Myra stands in the middle of the room, and Roy enters, shirt and trousers still disarranged
(amused by clothing) Well, well
In a real hurry, are we
Always, for you, baby
He reaches for her, but she playfully holds him off
You aren't taking me for granted, are you
Taking you for granite
He grins, as his fingertip prods her breast
That isn't granite
If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all
(playing along) Are you sure
(pulling her close) Let's find out
- Lilly's white Chrysler is parked next to an open-air phone
Traffic whizzes by
Lilly talks on the phone, with pen and notebook at the ready
The racetrack is visible in the b
g
'm done here
Do  come back to Baltimore
- It could be an expensive, if gaudy, lawyer's office
Baltimore harbor is visible past the windows
, the accountant, sits at a desk covered -- but neatly covered -- with ledgers, computer printouts, etc
He speaks on the phone
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar
Delmar
never go out to California
That's a thousand miles from here
Nine hundred
Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time
Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo
(fatalistic) know
Take two, three days
Call when you get there
Maybe 'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way
This is Lilly making the best of the situation
She listens a bit more,  a farewell, hangs up, moves to her car
- Again, anonymous hotel furniture
Roy and Myra naked in bed, he on his back, she straddling him, both moving gently
He's half feeling pleasure, half unconscious
Roy
Mm
Look at me
Oh,  am, baby, believe me
Roy
It this all we have
All
It ain't bad
No more than this
He tries to concentrate on her
What are you talking abut, Myra
Marriage
didn't say that
You aren't marriage material
He keeps watching her, ironic, hips moving
Looking for a distraction, she notices the bruise on his stomach
What's that
She touches it; he flinches back, in real pain
Ow
Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game
(laughing) No, baby
Come to Mama
She folds forward onto him
He puts his arms around her
They rock together slowly
- The same mountains in b
g
as at the track
Lilly carries two small bags from her motel room, puts them on the back seat of the Cadillac, gets behind the wheel, drives away
- Myra, dressed, primps at the mirror, surveys herself critically, is reasonably satisfied, leaves
- Roy lies supine on the bed, semi-conscious, half-covered by a sheet
Myra, casual, not noticing his condition, leans her head in through the doorway
Wore you out, did
It's a good woman you can't keep down, baby
He moves fitfully,  an attempt at speech
Have a good sleep, baby
Call you tomorrow
He sits up, trying to grin and be easy
Wait'll next year
across Roy's profile, with open bedroom door beyond him
Through it, the living room and outer door can be seen
Myra crosses the living room, opens the door
Bright sunlight pours in, emphasizing the sweat on his face
She closes the door, and he gives up trying to smile
Gingerly, he touches his bruised stomach, winces
Damn that guy
He's going to get out of bed, but movement creates pain
He sits back against the headboard, looks around, reaches painfully to the bedside table drawer, takes a quarter from it, studies the quarter, feels it with fingertips, places it on the back of his left hand, slowly moves the soft pads of his right palm over it, then turns the quarter over and repeats
Then he takes the quarter in his right hand, flips it, slaps it down onto the back of his left hand, simultaneously with the hands coming together
Smack
He looks away, right hand moving minimally on left hand
Heads
He lifts the right hand, nods, then flips the coin again, looks away, moves the right hand slightly
Heads
Again he's right
Again he repeats
Tails
He's about to repeat when a wave of weakness comes over him
He sits back, gasping, but won't acknowledge the problem
He forces himself to flip the coin, misses catching it, finds it on the blanket, flips it again, slaps it onto the back of the other hand, looks away
Tails
Right again
He prepares to flip the coin, but then his hand sags onto the covers, his chin drops, his eyes glaze
(whispered) How much can  bet
- The train runs through a forest, tree shadows making a light and-dark pattern
Roy, four or five years younger, sits with a three-core-monte gang, consisting of a , a spectacled beside him, Roy facing the dealer, a  next to Roy
On a briefcase on the dealer's lap are three cards, face up: An ace and two deuces
Across the aisle, alone in the seats, sits , a conman in his fifties, pretending not to watch, but watching with amusement
That's between you two
got nothing at stake here, 'm just dealing
What if we both guess wrong
You aren't gonna take
The dealer turns aside, allowing himself to be distracted
He and the shill  nonsensically
The roper nudges Roy, then reaches out and crimps the ace
Roy's doing a wide-eyed bumpkin kid; he stares at the roper in delight and amazement
on the shill, arguing with the dealer but looking toward Roy and the roper, then increasing the force of his argument
across the amused Mintz at the roper whispering to Roy
, Roy and the roper
We got him now
Put down that big bill you got
(whispered) The fifty or the hundred
The hundred
Hurry
(doubtful) The ace is what  want
The roper's having trouble keeping his patience
Sure it is
, the dealer and the shill, fake-squabbling, Roy and the roper seen in b
g
between their faces, Roy finally bringing out his wallet, withdrawing a bill
Relieved, the dealer and the shill cut the crap
on the group as Roy puts his hundred dollar bill on the briefcase
Is that okay
The shill pulls a messy wad of bills from his inner pocket, uses most of it to cover the bet
You're damn right that's okay
(picks up the cards) Whoever finds the ace, wins
, the dealer's hands, shuffling the cards at lightning speed
He deals the cards out face down
- , Roy's sweat-covered face, eyelids fluttering
(whispered) Dark in here
- on the group
Roy squints at the cards, light and dark playing on his face
Too dark
just can't see
Casually, but too quickly to be stopped, he reaches across and plucks the shill's glasses off
Let me borrow these, will you
across Mintz, surprised and amused, at the group in b
g
, in consternation as Roy puts on the glasses and looks down at the cards
Now, that's better
' : The glasses are 'readers
' Through them, a large gray '' can be seen on the back of one of the non-crimped cards
Roy's hand reaches out and flips it over
It's the ace of spades
- across Roy toward the doorway
Roy, eyes closed, smiles in triumph, then winces in pain
Mintz partially appears, hovering beside the bed, grinning at Roy
didn't teach you that
(whispered) You taught me a lot
Then invented
- Weary bored people sit around waiting
Roy, 17, lugging a big suitcase, walks through, takes a seat near Mintz, who's doing card tricks for his own pleasure
Roy watches, then moves closer
Let me see how you did that one
Scram
Go home
can't
just left home
You're too young
You should be in school
am in school
Mintz peers at him, taking an interest
Then he holds up the five of spades, shows it to Roy, puts it back in the deck, shuffles, shows Roy the deck
Where's the five
In your other hand
Mintz grins slowly, turns his hand over with the palmed card showing
Roy slumps, eyes closed, half-smiling, with the fever Mintz hovering
Roy's smile fades, his fluttering eyelids grow still, his face slack
The fever Mintz fades and disappears
- on a large sign indicating "Los Angeles" straight ahead
and around 180 degrees to face the several lanes of heavy Los Angeles-bound traffic
Hundreds of cars rush by
with Lilly's white Chrysler as it comes along in the stream
through the Chrysler's left side window at Lilly, driving, concentrating, biting her left thumbnail
She becomes aware that's what she's doing, shakes her head in irritation: She's trying to break herself of this habit
Ostentatiously she tucks the thumb into her fist, rests the fist on top of the steering wheel, where she can keep an eye on it
on the westbound lanes
The Chrysler passes
Soon it's out of sight among all the other cars
- across the unmoving unconscious Roy toward the doorway
The apartment door beyond the living room opens, throwing light on Roy, who doesn't react
Lilly enters, in silhouette, closes the door, crosses toward the bedroom
(Until she speaks, we can't be quite sure who this is
With the similarity between herself and Myra, this could be Myra
) (hesitant) Roy
No reaction
Lilly, getting worried, moves closer, through the bedroom doorway
Roy
You asleep
His head moves slightly
He barely has strength to speak
Myra
She moves forward to the side of the bed, only her torso She touches a hand to his forehead
(startled) My God
She turns, hurries back to the living room, looks around for the phone, crosses to it, dials,
Roy's eyes open, he frowns
Lilly
- Lilly, hard and fast and urgent, on the phone
Tell the doctor  work for Bobo Justus, and this is an emergency
Don't worry, he knows who Bobo is
- down toward Roy, from above, he's weak but troubled
Eyes closed, frowning, whispering
Go away, Lilly
Go away
Roy's eyes close
He looks dead
- The , a nervous heavyset man in his fifties, a drinker from the look of him, is on the phone in b
g
, while Lilly prowls the room, looking at everything with distaste, then stopping to frown at the box-framed clown pictures
She doesn't get it
She touches one of the pictures, trying to understand
The doctor hangs up, turns to Lilly
(lugubrious) The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do
What
He's going to be all right
Mrs
Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident
He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside
Well, make it stop
His blood pressure is under a hundred
don't think he'll live to get to the hospital
(icy, stern) You know who  work for
He's uncomfortable, wants to dismiss that part of his life
Yes, yes, but that's -- My son will be all right
If he isn't, 'll have you killed
The doctor stares at her in astonishment, then in belief
of ambulance siren
To break the moment, he crosses to the door, opens it
Light bathes Lilly
The doctor steps back across the threshold, waiting for the ambulance
He looks back at Lilly, who stares at him
- , Roy, skin pallid, eyes closed and sunken, lips white
of siren
to - clumsy slum hotel fifteen years ago, with a tiny lobby, the at a half-door in one wall
Lilly, at 24, enters from the street
This is a definite hooker, with bright maroon hair and a black-and-white miniskirt
She stops wordlessly at the desk for her key
(handing key) Your kid's in the back here
He's crying
Roy
He's always crying
(sympathetic to Roy) The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different
(ironic) like you, too
The clerk shrugs
He doesn't like this tough broad
He turns and calls back into his office
Roy, your mother's here
Roy, 10, comes reluctantly out to Lilly, sniffling and rubbing his arm
So what's your story today
They twisted my arm
(laughing lightly) Only one arm
He tries not to cry, and shows her a space between his teeth
They knocked out my tooth
Only one tooth
Roy's frustrated, unhappy, having nowhere else to turn
You always say that
Lilly won't take him seriously, but she relents enough to stop teasing him, and to pat his head, ignoring how he flinches away
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house
(there's no food) Hah
Lilly gives him a jaundiced look, walks Roy to the stairs and up
The clerk, scornful but sexually interested, watches her go
- , Roy in a hospital bed, with more color in his face, breathing more normally
He begins to react to the sound of people speaking
(
) No, really, you're Roy's mother
That's impossible
(
) Not quite
But 'm not sure who you are, Mrs
Langtry, was it
Roy's eyes open, he looks toward the voices
(
) 'm Roy's friend
, Lilly and Myra facing one another across the foot of Roy's bed, in a two-bed hospital room
(The   in the other bed sleeps through the scene
) Neither woman is yet aware that Roy's awake
Lilly looks Myra up and down, with obvious contempt
Yes
imagine you're lots of people's friend
Myra moves one pace to the side, studying Lilly's face
Oh, of course, now that  see you in the light, you're plenty old enough to be Roy's mother
(sweet smile) Aren't we all
(very weak, but amused) Play nice
Don't fight
The women, startled, both move toward Roy, one on each side of the bed
, Myra and Lilly both leaning over to look down at Roy's sleepy face
Darling
Roy
You're going to be all right
Sure  am
What made you turn up, after all these years
'm working down in San Diego
Just for a few weeks
(awkward laugh) Thought 'd drop in on my long-lost son
(cold) Nice to see you
(turns to Myra) What am  doing in here
You were bleeding inside, honey
Remember that bruise you had
You called the doctor, huh
(reluctant) Well, no, Roy
Your mother found you
(tossing It away) Oh, yeah
(very casual, to Lilly) Thanks
(back to Myra) How long do they say 'm in here
Myra's willing to fight with Lilly, but Roy's attitude toward his mother makes her uncomfortable
Roy
Your mom saved your life
Roy turns his head, gives Lilly an ironic smile
Lilly waits, holding herself in
Yeah
Only one life
She nods, accepting that, but then responds
Second time  gave it to you
Roy gives her a cold smile, then turns to Myra for the ironic explanation
was kind of
inconvenient
for Lilly
Lilly has nothing but contempt for Myra
To be humiliated in front of Myra -- and by her son -- is the worst thing that could happen to her
She makes as dignified an exit as she can
Well
You're all right now, guess
have to get down to the track
(reluctant, but it's necessary) Thanks, uh, Lilly
(awkward laugh) Don't mention it
guess  owe you my life
(faint smile) You always did
Lilly exits
Myra looks after her, curious
"Down to the track
" Roy will not talk about this, with anyone
His response is cold, closing the subject
Her job
(bright smile) want to know everything about you
(easy grin) You do
And once 'm out of here, 'll remind you of the best parts
They smile flirtatiously at one another, both with their minds on other things
- Very messy, small
Myra showers
She finishes, emerges, wraps herself in a towel, opens the crowded messy medicine cabinet, removes cosmetics and other items, starts to tweeze her eyebrows
Doorbell
She looks irritated, ignores it
Long doorbell
Exasperated, she slaps the tweezers down, exits
- Another furnished apartment, this one with Myra's clothing and dishes and glasses and other junk all over it
She crosses to the door, pulls it open
The enters; a sullen, nervous, heavyset man
(angry, but defensive) You heard the shower, didn't you
don't care about that
This time, gotta have the rent
Myra forces herself to be more pleasant
Joe,  thought  was gonna be all right by now,  just need a little more -- It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife
She knows what's going on
This time,  gotta have the money
Joe, you know you'll -- In gesturing, Myra "accidentally" loses the towel, then wraps it around herself again as the manager stares nervously away
She smiles, knowing she's got him
Joe, could we talk it over
Do you want a drink
My wife sent me here, Myra
For the money
She's waiting
'll have it tonight
Nine o'clock
Ten
(trying to be determined) This time
We'll work something out, Joe
She strokes his arm, smiling
He flees
She smiles till he's gone, then looks worried, leans her head against the door
- Roy, very comfortable in pajamas and robe, sits in a wheelchair beside the bed, with magazines lying handy on the bed
Myra, irritable, paces beside him
don't see why you're still here
You look healthy to me
just do what the doctor says, babe
You're just comfortable, that's all
You don't even ask to go home
You just lie around, let your mama take care of you
(truly astonished) Mama
Who else is paying for all this
You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you
(insulted) 'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that
don't like to come here, Roy
Every time  do, your mother comes in and makes remarks
That's just Lilly's way
And you never defend me
You're afraid of her
Oh, don't be stupid
You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth
This is so absurd, Roy doesn't know how to respond
Are you kid --
hadn't even seen her in seven years
Lilly enters, smiling in self-confidence
large ugly burn is on the back of her right hand
Should my ears be burning
(surly) They might as well
Lilly gives her a mock-admiring look
heard those skirts were coming back
Myra's not quite up to direct confrontation with Lilly
She glowers at Roy instead
Get well soon
(easy) Every day in every way
'll see you when you get home
Myra stalks out
Acting as though Myra hadn't existed, Lilly puts her bag on the bed, takes mail from it
What happened to your hand
(casually dismissive) Just a little accident
went by your place, picked up your mall
Just bills, 'll take care of them
can take care of my own bills, Lilly
(indifferent shrug) Whatever you say
The manager says your boss called
(crooked grin) Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh
What are you talking about
So 've got a job
So what
Stop kidding me
Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do
You expect me to believe that
(spreads hands; it's obvious) It's there
The boss called, you said so yourself
And that dump you live in
Those clown pictures on the walls
This reference alerts and worries Roy, which he tries to hide
like those
You do not
Roy Dillon
Cornball clown pictures
Commission salesman
It's all a front, isn't it
You're on the grift,  know you are
You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because wrote the book
(defensive) You're one to talk
Still running playback money for the mob
That's me
That's who  am
You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you -- How come
She considers him
His expression is jaunty, daring her
She gives him a somber answer
You aren't tough enough
He's afraid she's right
He covers the doubt with a display of self-assurance
Not as tough as you, huh
(dead serious) No
And you have to be
She holds up her burned hand, showing it to him
You asked me about this
You really want to know what happened
He isn't sure he does; but what choice does he have
Up to you
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore
When a long shot gets too much action,  have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down
Sure
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell should have been on it
But that was the day after you came in here, so  stuck around to see how you were gonna be
He would speak protest, deny, explain, but she cuts him off
That was my choice, nothing to do with you
took a chance, and it didn't work out
Bluebell came in
sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets
hoped that would cover me
(shrug) It didn't
on the exit doors toward the parking lot
Lilly comes out, self-absorbed, then sees something ahead of her, falters briefly, keeps walking, tries a very shaky smile
, as Lilly approaches her car
, 50, a blunt hoodlum in a good suit and a civilized veneer, stands leaning against the car, arms folded, squinting behind sunglasses
Hi, Bobo
Did  buy you that dress, you piece of shit
Lilly's scared, startled, but trying to figure out how to play this
Well,  guess so
You're the guy work for
You work for me, huh
Then  just may flush you down the toilet
Drive me to the Durando
Bobo gets into the passenger seat, while Lilly nods convulsive agreement and hurries around to get behind the wheel
The car jolts forward, then smooths, and heads for the gate
- Driving along the highway
Lilly concentrates on traffic
Bobo heavily watches her profile, finally speaks
Bluebell
Lilly's eyes briefly close, her shoulders sag
Then she goes back to the silent alert person she'd been
Bobo nods
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that
'm not getting away with anything, Bobo
You're fuckin right you're not
How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh
Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me
was down on that horse, Bobo
Not as much as  should have been, but there was a lot of action on those-- Bobo taps a fingertip against the side of her head to shut her up
She shuts up
One question
Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth
want to keep my teeth
Now 'll ask you another
You think got no contacts out here
That nag paid off at just the opening price
There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted
There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win
You send me ten thousand dollars, like 'm some mark you can blow off
(terrified, broken) Bobo, no,  -- You wanna talk to me straight up
My son -- Your what
My son was in the hospital -- What the fuck are you doin with a son
He left home a long time ago
He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick
(utter scorn) Motherhood
never fucked up before, Bobo
You expect me to buy this
It's time for Lilly to show tough, and she knows it
You do buy it, Bobo
cost you, and 'm sorry
Bobo thinks this over
got a lot of people work for me, Lilly
can't have shit like this
(begging) It'll never happen again
swear
It happened once
With me, that's making a habit of it
Lilly drops back to her final position; fatalism
You're calling the shots
You got any kind of long coat in the car
Anything you can wear home over your clothes
(deadened with fear) No
(doesn't matter) 'll loan you a raincoat
Lilly drives, holding herself together
- tall expensive hotel on the coast north of San Diego
with the Chrysler pulling in and stopping at the entrance, then   the balconied facade
- Living room of a high-floor suite
across the room to the balcony and the view of the ocean
Entrance door to one side
supermarket shopping bag is on the coffee table
Two  sit on the sofa, watching
The door opens and Lilly enters, followed by Bobo
The thugs immediately rise and switch off the
(to the thugs) Take a walk
The thugs leave the room as Lilly crosses to stand between and the view, followed by Bobo, neither looking out
Lilly turns to Bobo, who abruptly punches her hard in the stomach
She falls to the floor
as Bobo steps across her and goes over to close the drapes over the view
Lilly sits up, watching him, waiting obediently
Bobo looks at her
(') Get me a bath towel
She gets up, hurting, and hurries to the bathroom
Bobo sits on the sofa, crosses his ankles on the coffee table next to the supermarket bag
He takes out and lights a cigar
Lilly comes back with a large white bath towel
(') You ever hear about the oranges
You mean, the insurance frammis
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly
He kicks over the supermarket bag
Oranges roll on the floor
(') While you put those in the towel
Lilly's very scared
She drops to her knees, spreads the towel, crawls around gathering oranges while she talks
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right
It's for working scams against insurance companies
And if you do it wrong
It can louse up your insides
You can get puh, puh, puh
(impatient) What's that, Lilly
Lilly pauses, bent over, tightly holding an orange
Permanent damage
You'll never shit right again
He gets to his feet, leaving his cigar in an ashtray
(') (hard, impatient) Bring me the towel
Fumbling slightly, she folds the towel edges together to make a bag, then stands, brings the towel to Bobo
He makes a production out of getting his grip on the edges just right
She stands as limp as she can, just wanting to get through this
He looks at her without expression, rears back with the towel, swings it forward, lets it drop open
Oranges roll on the floor
Lilly stares, wide-eyed, recognizing reprieve
Bobo tosses the towel behind him onto the sofa, then gestures contemptuously for her to pick up the oranges again
, closer, as Lilly turns, bending toward the oranges, and Bobo picks up his cigar, then lifts a foot and kicks her flatfooted, hard, in the back
She sprawls on the floor
He follows and drops to his knees on her back
close on Lilly on the floor, Bobo's knees grinding back and forth into her back
on Bobo, grimacing as he bears down, pressing his weight onto her back
He leans forward, left hand bracing himself on the floor beside her head as he reaches down with the cigar held in his right hand and presses the ember against the back of her splayed-out right hand
, Lilly, clenching her teeth, tears squeezing from her eyes, simply bearing it
on Bobo, catching a bad smell, looking back down behind himself at Lilly's body
This is the result he wanted, but it disgusts him
He straightens up, still kneeling on her, puts the cigar in his mouth, doesn't like its taste, removes it, braces his left hand against her back while he lifts off her, getting back up onto his feet
, Bobo stepping over her, expression repulsed
(') Go clean yourself up
He puts the cigar back in the ashtray as she rises, cradling her burnt hand
Not looking toward Bobo, hobbling with knees together, she starts from the room
(') The raincoat's on the bed
She leaves
He opens the drapes, then picks up an orange from the floor and steps out onto the balcony
- Bobo stands looking out at the ocean
He enjoys breathing the sea air
He slowly peels the orange, dropping pieces of peel over the side
Lilly appears in the doorway, wearing a too-large man's raincoat
Bobo doesn't seem to notice her at first, then nods to her
Almost forgot
That ten grand of yours
It's in the envelope by the door
(tries for animation) Oh, thanks, Bobo
You want a drink
Gee,  better not, if it's okay still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez
See your son, huh
Well, that's nice
side of you  didn't know, Lilly
Lilly chances taking a step out onto the balcony
It's vital that she encourage this forgive-and-forget dialogue
He's a good kid
salesman
On the square, huh
And how are you making out these days
Stealing much
Bobo's being jolly now
Lilly's scared, but has to be jolly, too
From you
My folks didn't raise any stupid kids
Bobo's joshing now
He raises a humorous eyebrow
Not skimming a thing, Lilly
Oh, well, you know
just clip a buck here and a buck there
Not enough to notice
(honest approval) That's right
Take a little, leave a little
person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else
He's a liability, right, Bobo
(this is his creed) You're a thousand percent right
Or else he's working an angle
If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big
You know it, Lilly
You know,  like that suit, Bobo don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller
(delighted) Yeah
You really think so
lot of people been telling me the same thing
Well, you can tell them  said they're right
(looks at sky) better get going
Roy'll wonder where  am
Worries about his mother, eh
Give him a hug for me
will
So long, Bobo
Lilly leaves the balcony
Bobo eats more orange, looking out at the ocean
His expression is stern but calm
- Lilly drives along the highway, weeping, shaking, teeth chattering
Her hands are both high on the wheel, the back of the right hand developing a large red burn
Lucky
Lucky
Oh, am  lucky
Am lucky
- Roy's appalled and embarrassed and ashamed by this story; the surface result is, he's mad at Lilly
Lucky
You call that lucky
(simply) He let me live
He let me be his friend
Roy in his agitation wheels himself back and forth in the wheelchair, bumping into things
You don't put up with that
Nobody has to put up with that
You do if you're where  am
Where you want to be
How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy
He closes down, sullen, not caring if she believes him or not
tripped over a chair
(calm maternal advice) Get off the grift, Roy
Why
(') (faint smile) You don't have the stomach for it
He stares at her, hurt and angry
She stares back, unflinching
Angrily, he spins the wheelchair around, his back to her
Now she's hurt
She shrugs, speaks indifferently to his back
just give you your life
What you do with it is up to you
(his back turned) That's right
She hesitates, then stalks out, shutting the door
Hearing the door close, Roy spins around in the wheelchair to face where she'd been
He starts to get up, pauses midway
- Angry, Lilly takes a step away from the closed door, then stops, looks uncertainly back
- Roy, on his feet now, stands still, indecisive
- Lilly shakes her head, turns firmly away, marches down the corridor
- Roy makes an angry gesture, drops back into the wheelchair, spins it around and wheels over to the phone
Quick and angry, he makes a call
of ring;  of click
(
) (filtered; little-girl flirtatious) Myra here
Sorry you missed me
Tell me how to reach you and will, just as soon as  can
of answering machine beep
Babe, 'm gettin out of here, and that's it
Let's take some time out this weekend, go down to LaJolla, hit the beach, have some fun
Forget all this other stuff, huh
Roy hangs up, sits in the wheelchair looking determined
- Simms talks with a
Your difference between your folded towel and your clean towel is a trip to the laundry
When you're cleaning those bathrooms, what you do, you pick up the towel, you give it a good shake and a good look, and you say to yourself, 'Would dry myself on this towel
' If the answer's yes, fold it
Roy comes out of the elevator, crossing toward Simms
What if it's wet
Mr
Dillon
Welcome back
You look fine, just fine
Thanks, Mr
Simms, 'm feeling fine
(shy) 'm glad you're better
Simms hands Roy a stack of mail
You're well liked around here, Mr
Dillon
The entire staff will be pleased to see you're back
Roy's touched and embarrassed by this reaction
Well, thank you
And thank them
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon
That's true, Mr
Simms
We never know when and we never know why
We never know how
The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time
Just when you've got tickets to the World Series
And that's the way the permanent waves
Well, 'm back now
just wanted you to know
Gotta rush
Happy to see you looking so good
Roy crosses back to the elevator, enters it
Elevator door closes
Simms looks after him, avuncular
(') That fellow could be a congressman
(turns to maid) If it's wet, you don't fold it
You shake it, and hang it neatly on the rod provided
Yes, sir
&  - long low stucco building in an industrial section of Los Angeles
The company name is on the glass of the main door
, a humorless hotshot of 28, dressed in short-sleeved white shirt and narrow dark tie, prowls the cracked sidewalk in front of the place,   into a small cassette recorder
Roy's Honda arrives and drives into the company lot at the end of the building
Kaggs watches, then goes on patrolling and  into the recorder
Roy comes out to the sidewalk and heads for the entrance
Kaggs stops and watches him approach
(cheerful, confident) Whadaya say
(uptight, minimal) Hello
Roy continues on and enters the building
&  - low rail separates the visitors from an area of desks with typing or adding up figures or  on the phone
Beyond them are floor-to-ceiling bins and shelves with narrow aisles between, in which more  move busily, filling orders or doing inventory
great sense of activity and hubbub
Roy enters, looks around in surprise
clerk at a front desk sees him, stands happily
Roy
Welcome back
(approaching him) What's going on
This is usually coffee break time
Not since Kaggs showed up
Other clerks, aware of Roy, come over with
(happily basking) Hey, yeah, 'm fine, everything's great
What's this Kaggs
Sounds like a disease
2ND It is
Troubleshooter from the main office
Came out here right after you went into the hospital, and he ain't had a kind word for anybody yet
3RD Nobody knows anything but him
He chopped off half a dozen salesmen; won't wholesale to them any more
2ND What kind of sense does that make
They're all on commission
(unworried) You think he'll chop me
If he does, he's crazy
2ND Here he comes
The clerks all hurry back to their desks as Kaggs enters
He crosses to Roy, hand stuck out
Kaggs
Home office
(taking his hand) Roy Dillon
(keeping Roy's hand) know that
Knew it when  saw you out there
The best salesman here, which isn't saying much
Want to talk to you, Dillon
Kaggs moves toward the gate in the rail, still holding Roy's hand, to move him along
Roy stands still, which yanks Kaggs back
Kaggs frowns at him, releases his hand
(') What's up
That was a pretty backhanded compliment
If  let people get away with things like that, wouldn't be a good salesman
(brisk) You're right
apologize
But still want to talk to you
Lead on
Kaggs leads the way through the rail
'  - Small, crowded, efficient, with interior windows showing the aisles of bins
Kaggs leads Roy in, shuts the door, gestures at the second chair as he goes behind the desk
Take a seat
They both sit, Roy amused and observant
When  said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, meant for us
know your record with Sarber and Webb, and 'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive
No one walking on your heels
Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself
'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally
(dry) So  heard
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission
If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around
Ever supervise salesmen
Just myself
That's right, you've had to supervise yourself
This place needs a sales manager
Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen
He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire
What do you think
Roy doesn't yet know he's being offered the job
Sounds like a good Idea
don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up
The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent
Now Roy gets it
He's startled, almost scared, thinks automatically of escape
What
Me
That's just the first year
If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, 'll kick you out
What do you say
Well, uh
No
(astonished) No
can't take that job
mean, mean,  can't take it right away
'm still recuperating,  just dropped in to say hello, see everybody -- didn't realize
Yeah, you do look a little pale
How soon will you be ready
week
But you need a man right now
It wouldn't be fair to you to -- take care of the being-fair-to-me department
Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer
(trapped) Well
Kaggs gets to his feet, terminating the meeting
See you in a week, Roy
can call you Roy
(rising) Oh, sure
Fine
Kaggs sticks his hand out for another shake
Roy obliges
And 'm Perk
Short for Percy, 'm afraid
(distracted) Perk
- Roy's place
Roy enters from the bedroom, carrying a suitcase, which he drops on the sofa
He goes to one of the box-framed clown pictures, takes it off the wall, puts it face down on the coffee table, removes two wing nuts holding the back, lifts off the back, and reveals stacks of money hidden inside
He takes two wads of money out, counting them, putting them on the coffee table, then fits the back in place, reattaches the wing nuts, and hangs the picture on the wall
Stuffing the wads of money into the suitcase, he leaves

Roy pays the driver, who opens the trunk to take out several pieces of luggage
Myra leans hesitantly out, as though afraid it's raining out there
This really is it
Union Station
Myra comes out of the cab
She's feeling testy
Roy's in a good mood and ignores her bad temper
don't see why we have to take the train
Because it's comfortable
Myra and Roy burden themselves with the luggage
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there
We'll rent a car
They start for the station
Big spender
You ain't seen nothin
from outside the passenger car through the window at Myra, mulish, watching the scenery go by
Beyond her Roy's easy, content
He moves to get up
, within the train
Myra looks questioningly at Roy as he stands
Stretch my legs
Come along
She's not ready to relent and enjoy herself
No
(unruffled) See you soon
He walks down the aisle behind Myra, who sighs and looks out the window again
- Four young  sit at a table in a rudimentary bar car
They're drinking bloody Marys out of plastic glasses and having a good time together
In b

, several customers are clustered at the small service bar, waiting for drinks
on Roy, at the service bar, looking back past other people at the soldiers
He gets his mixed drink, in a plastic glass, and turns away
on the soldiers as Roy starts by
The train lurches, and Roy falls heavily against their table, slopping their drinks and spilling some of his own on the table
Oh
Ow, 'm sorry
Oh, look, spilled your drinks
That's okay, don't worry about it
2 You okay, pal
Let me buy you a new round
Hey, no, no problem
3 You didn't like spill much at all
Roy firmly places his own glass on their table
What are those, bloody Marys
Watch this, 'll be back
He leaves, while the soldiers are still
- Myra applies makeup, watching herself in her compact mirror
She becomes aware of eyes, and looks around
, Myra and a , sitting across the way, grinning at her
Myra registers him
, Myra, considering the possibilities
Then she shrugs, shakes her head at the businessman almost reluctantly, and goes back to applying makeup
- Roy now sits with the soldiers, eagerly listening to them talk
There are plastic glasses enough on the table for three rounds of drinks
3 (to Soldier 2) Yeah, but it was you like told the sergeant your grandmother was dead
(laughing) Again
2 (to Soldier 3) And you jumped right in
(broad imitation) 'll drive him, Sarge, he's too distraught
4 (astonished) Distraught
You said distraught
They all laugh, Roy laughing with them
Boy
You guys could've got in a lot of trouble
3 Nah
Old Sarge, he's slowing down
don't know
wouldn't take a chance like that
(looks at floor) What's that
They watch as he bends, picks up one die from the floor, holds it where they can all see it, his manner open, guileless
(') One of you fellows drop this
- Myra walks down the aisle, demurely looking at no one
- Roy's getting to his feet, the soldiers protesting
2 You can't buy every round
3 Like our turn
Tell you what
We'll roll for it
Low number buys
He hands the die to Soldier 2
Go ahead
You roll for the four of you
The soldiers are confused but agreeable, seeing this as some kind of fun
2 Here goes
He tosses the die on the table
3 That's a four
Roy picks up the die
close on Roy, his eyes glittering, his fist with the die shaking beside his head
Roy throws
They all look at the die
Roy spreads his hands; the good sport
Told you 'd buy
It just doesn't seem fair, Tom
Tell you what
Give me a chance to get even when  come back

- brightly lit Hopperish place
Lilly sits alone in a booth eating a bowl of chili and reading a newspaper folded beside the bowl
with a great deal of faith in his own charm sits with a male  at the counter, drinking coffee
The drunk keeps looking toward Lilly, grinning, playfully to his friend, who's bored by it all
Lilly doesn't seem to be aware of him
The drunk rises from his stool, turning toward Lilly, staggering slightly
His friend makes a small move to stop him, then shrugs and lets him go
The drunk makes his way to Lilly's table, leans on it
Pretty woman like you shouldn't eat alone
Whadaya wanna eat alone for
Lilly gives him a flat look
Go away
She looks past him toward the  behind the counter
(') (calling) Could  have some coffee, please
Right away
We could have coffee together
My name's Kenny
Lilly looks over at the drunk's friend, who pointedly ignores the situation
Your pal wants you
The drunk could turn mean; his gesture brushing away the idea of his friend is stronger than necessary
Let him find his own pretty woman
The waitress arrives, with the coffee pot and a mug
She puts the mug on the table, pours coffee
This fellow bothering you, Ma'am
Yes
(to the drunk) Why don't you go sit down
'll sit here
Move over
The drunk wants to sit beside Lilly, who looks to the waitress to solve the problem, but the waitress stands there with the coffee pot, looking helpless
The drunk bends to slide onto the seat
Lilly, exasperated, rabbit punches him in the throat
The drunk, astounded and in pain (and not breathing), staggers back, flailing, hitting the waitress's arm so that she slops coffee on him as his feet tangle and he falls heavily onto the floor
Lilly, suddenly concerned, slides out of the booth
Oh
Are you all right
She goes to one knee beside the drunk, who clutches his own throat with both hands, retching as he tries to inhale
Lilly looks up at the astonished waitress
(') shouldn't have hit him that hard
guess  don't know my own strength
The drunk's friend arrives and helps Lilly get the drunk to his feet
The drunk is breathing now, but shaken
He looks at Lilly with reproachful eyes
His friend transfers his annoyance at the drunk to Lilly
You didn't have to do that
(matter of fact) thought  did
You should take better care of your friend
(mumbled) Outta here
The drunk and his friend head for the exit, as Lilly turns to the waitress
'm sorry a lady can't eat in here without being bothered
The waitress is apologetic, and also in awe of Lilly
It won't happen again, Ma'am, promise
Dinner's on the house
More chili
Dessert
We have lovely pecan pie, my husband makes it himself
That sounds nice
Pecan pie
Thank you
Lilly sits down as the waitress goes back behind the counter
on the waitress, as she puts down the coffee pot, brings out the pecan pie, prepares to slice it, pauses, looks with wonder toward Lilly

Roy and Myra linger over wine, near the end of their meal
Roy's relaxed, happy, expansive
Myra's pleased but watchful, the bird watching the worm
You were right,  had to get out of that hospital
Nothing wrong with me any more

Great to get away, take it easy
Next week, 'll get back to work
You already went back to work

Working the tap on those soldier boys

Oh, come on, Roy
She mimes rolling the die, slowly, showing how it will roll out of her hand just so, then speaks to him as though to a bright child
The tap

You're on the grift
Same as me

While Hebbing looks manly and flustered and pleased, Cole brings from under his desk a partially full gray canvas sack marked Federal Reserve Bank
Well, 'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth
Here's your money
(innocent avarice) Goody
Myra opens her attache case on the desk
Cole takes banded stacks of bills from the sack, packs them neatly in the case
Hebbing tries not to look envious and impressed
' : The top bill in each stack is a hundred
Myra takes a stack, riffles it for Hebbing's benefit
Isn't that just beautiful
Yes, it is
Myra returns the stack to the case, talks to Cole
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing -- (shocked) Mary Beth
This has never been anything but -- Oh,  know,  know, and you've been wonderful since  was widowed
But Mister Hebbing has-- (to Hebbing) -- you don't mind my telling him, darling -- (to Cole) -- suffered reverses
If he could
She gestures vaguely, unable to describe the situation accurately
Hebbing fills in, bluff and hearty
Top up the tanks, as It were
Until this little glitch in the oil economy comes to an end
(man to man laugh) Not that  understand exactly what you do, not from Mary Beth's explanation
Cole broods, studying Hebbing, deciding at last to trust him
Well
If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already
(girlish laugh) So here we are
(solemn) Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here,  want to be sure you understand that
No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken
(a real sport; laughing) Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it
(still serious) And  don't just mean the
We could have the  breathing down our necks
(suddenly serious) certainly hope not
Loose talk is the one thing  worry about
can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes
Describing the scheme, Cole becomes increasingly enthusiastic
Okay, then
Sit down, sit down
Hebbing sits on the sofa, Myra beside him, holding his arm in both of hers
Cole paces, describing
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind
There isn't one hour of the day when both are open
Information moves, but it has to wait
Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it
You're right
And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange
He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information
Do you know what that means
Hebbing doesn't want to admit ignorance
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York,  see that
Every once in a while, a major change comes through
We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in
Not much time
We have to be ready
We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately
(impressed) Seven seconds
don't see how you do it
These machines -- They're in here
Cole crosses to an inner door, pushes it partway open, looks back grinning with his hand on the knob
Want a look
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring
- bare dusty room
ladder leans against a wall, a paint can on the floor beside it
Only Cole is visible in the open doorway
He speaks back into the main office
Come take a look
An entire-suite of main-frame computer
(
) We're not really interested, Henry
'  - Cole remains in the doorway, luring Hebbing with a smile
It's quite a sight
You sure
Cole's pushing this too far
Hebbing's thinking politeness requires him to look
Myra's nervous, her smile with an edge to it
Henry, don't try Mister Hebbing's patience
He knows what machines look like
- Cole smiles at the empty room again, looks back
Well, if you're sure
He shuts the door
(
) Cole liked to take risks, huh
- Roy and Myra at the table
He didn't think they were risks
He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark
And when he got serious
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the
And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while
The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars
From one sucker
thought these people were broke
No, no, Roy, just cash poor
They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage
Sell their wife's jewelry
Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it
Or when  put their minds to it stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run
No no
He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off
Yeah
How
- Myra puts a blood-filled four-inch-square plastic package into her bra on the left side, then puts on a white blouse
(
) Three or four days after Cole got the money, he'd phone the sucker, tell him he'd made the move
- Myra and Hebbing hurry across the sidewalk from the limo, each carrying an attache case
(
) Our buy was in the computer, we were rich, he should come collect
'  - Myra and Hebbing enter, Cole meets them, all happy
Here you are
Two rich people
must admit, Mister Fellowes, had moments  was worried
You brought a case
Good
Cole brings out the canvas sack from under the desk, reaches in, brings out a stack of bills
The door opens and two men in suits and topcoats and hats enter, one of them flashing a badge
(These are, altered, two of the clerks from before
) Hold it right there
(cool outrage) What
This is a private office
Stock fraud, tampering with Exchange communications -- Cole suddenly loses all control, becomes a gibbering wreck
Oh, my God
No
The scandal
The second man approaches Hebbing, pencil and notebook at the ready, manner cold and tough
Your name
My --
don't  only -- (screams at Myra) You
You and your goddamn big mouth
(terrified) Henry, no,  -- Who did you tell
Who
Just one or two of the girls, just, they wouldn't -- Cole pulls a pistol from his desk drawer
Don't move
Mister Fellowes, that isn't going to do you any good
Put that down, and -- Cole ignores him, staring in frantic hatred at Myra
You ruined me
You destroyed me
Henry, no
Cole shoots her, the  very loud, the men flinching away
Myra slaps her hand to her breast; blood spurts between her fingers
In terror, she turns toward Hebbing, who stares at the blood seeping down her white blouse
She tries to speak, can't
She reaches out, her bloody hand sliding down Hebbing's front without getting any purchase, leaving a swath of blood diagonally across his jacket, shirt and tie
She topples forward
Hebbing tries to hold her, but she slips to the floor
Cole runs around the desk toward the door, waving the gun
Get back
Get back
The men warily move away from the door
'll kill the first one that follows me
Cole runs from the room
The two men pull guns from hip holsters under their coat-tails
Hebbing, kneeling beside Myra, watches them approach the door, crouch, run through
Hebbing rises, looks around, runs to the inner door, finds it locked
He crosses to the main door, looks out, cautiously creeps from the room
Myra sits up
- Hebbing hurries through the empty secretary's office and out the other door
The two men enter from a different door and cross to re-enter Cole's office
- Cole stands behind a pillar, watching
Across the way, Hebbing comes out of the office, staring around, trying to wipe the blood from his clothes
In obvious panic, he runs to the elevator, presses the button
through the glass wall into the elevator as it stops
The doors open, Hebbing hurries in, frantically jabs the button
The elevator descends
to Cole coming around the corridor, entering the office
'  - General hilarity
The secretary, two men, other two clerks, chauffeur and receptionist are all present, opening champagne, Hebbing's money now out of the sack and spread on the desk
Myra, stripped to the waist (unconcerned about the others present) cleans blood from her breasts with damp towels
He and Myra look at one another across the room, broadly smile
- Myra's very up, from reliving this story
Oh, Roy, it was great
We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year
What happened to Cole
(suddenly evasive) He retired
Where
Upstate
Upstate where
Atascadero
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it
Myra turns her face away
- Expensive room
Cole, naked, expression haunted and crazed, sits cross-legged on the bed
Myra enters, happy, carrying dress shop boxes
She stops, shocked, when she sees Cole
No, baby
Not again
He stares at the floor over the edge of the bed, like a shipwreck victim in a raft looking at the sea
It's hollow
You'll fall through
Myra drops the packages on a chair
Cole, it'll be all right
Honey
(frightened but determined) Can't move
It's just the strain again, the stress
We'll take a vacation
It's all hollow
Nothing behind it
She approaches him, scared but needing him
Cole, you scare me when this happens
One of these times
She touches him
He suddenly lashes out, knocking her backward, glaring at her
Demon
Demon
That's why you can walk on it
Demon
(heartbroken) Oh, Cole, please
Please come out of it
What would  do without you
Distracted, gone, unaware of her existence, he gazes around, hugs himself, sits staring at demons
She watches him, mournful, knowing he's gone
- Myra looks back at Roy
Her expression makes it clear she isn't going to tell him any more than she already has
He retired, and that's it
But didn't
'm still the best long-con roper you'll ever see
Roy laughs, genuinely pleased by her and also tacitly letting his questions drop
just bet you are, too
And now you're trying to rope me
(pushing enthusiasm) Join up with you
watched you, Roy, 've been watching you, wondering if  should talk about this at all, or maybe just
(shrug) Take a hike, you mean
need a partner, Roy
need an inside man, and you're it
You could be as wonderful as Cole
(dubious) don't know, Myra,  never had partners
never needed them
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks
But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand
Roy doesn't like this; he's feeling pressured
Myra sees it, but believes she's got him anyway, so she can let up
She pats his hand
Think about it
Okay
(easy to promise) Sure
- little drunk and happy, Roy and Myra come down the corridor together, then make it obvious they're going into separate rooms, across the corridor from one another
(coy, sexy) See you later
Roy complains, but half-heartedly, half humorously; this argument has already taken place
still don't see why we have to have separate rooms
You expect your father to come through
Separate bathrooms, darling
will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over
(nevertheless grumpy) Things a man isn't supposed to know
(soothing) You don't mind, really, do you, Roy
It's been such a wonderful evening,  guess  just wore myself out
Sure
'm pretty tired myself
They unlock the opposing doors, look back at one another
Myra's smile and good-night wave are consciously cute
Roy's response is a little forced
They go into their rooms
- Once he's alone, Roy stops trying to look like a good sport
Disgusted, he tosses the room key onto the dresser, then crosses to sliding glass doors closed in front of a balcony
He's about to close the drapes when he looks out, changes his mind, unlocks and opens the door
He steps outside
- high floor, with a wide view of ocean and starry sky
Roy leans on the rail, looking out, thinking
He mutters to himself
Long con
'm the one's been conned
Who needs this
He continues to stand there, taking some solace from the night
Phone
Confused, irritated, he turns to look into the room
Phone
At last, he goes back into the room
- Roy crosses to pick up the phone, grumpy and suspicious
Yeah
(
) (filtered) Open your door
What
(grins; gets it) What for
(
) (filtered) Open it and find out
Roy hangs up and crosses to the door
directly at the door as Roy opens it, showing Myra's door open across the way, Myra standing in her doorway naked
She waves at him to move over
(') Gangway
Roy steps back, holding his door open
- down the hall as Myra skips across from her room to Roy's, her door slamming behind her
- Myra runs in, giggling
Roy shuts the door, laughing at her
(coquettish) hope you don't mind, sir
just washed my clothes, and  couldn't do a thing with them
Roy's pleased, but at a loss
You --  don't know
(sudden burst of laughter) If you could have seen your face when  told you good night
You looked so, so
Ah
Oh, come here
They embrace
- clean anonymous Holiday Inn
Lilly, dressed for the track, sits at the round table under the swag light, sorting through her business purse
There's a folded newspaper on the table
on the door
She's startled
For just a second, she's like a trapped animal
Then she's calm again
She turns the purse around, opens another zipper section, removes a pistol and a silencer, quickly screws the silencer onto the pistol, lays the pistol on the table and covers it with the newspaper
Then she crosses to open the door
to include Roy in the doorway, grinning, easy
Lilly's surprised, pleased, but wary
Roy
What are you doing in San Diego
(entering) Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend
Lilly makes a face, but no comment, at Myra's name, as she closes the door
If you come out to the track, don't know me
We won't hit the track
The beach
Couple a nice restaurants
He takes from his pockets the wads of money held removed from the clown pictures, extends them toward her
What's that
Four grand
For the hospital
Is that enough
(distressed) Roy,  don't want money from you
pay my debts
(level skeptical look) You do
Since she won't take the money, he turns to put it on the table beside her purse, pushing the newspaper out of the way, revealing the gun
He gives it a surprised smile
Expecting visitors
No
That was the point
She crosses to unscrew the silencer and put both pieces back in her purse
Roy, watching, points at the still angry burn on her hand
You ought to put a bandage on that
No can do
Have to dip in and out of my bag too much
Besides, it'll heal in the air
Disdainful and hurt, she pushes at the wads of money
(') Roy, take that back
His own hostility shows through
No
She's not used to being vulnerable, can neither hide it nor really express it; can't use it as a tactic
thought
was hoping we could play it straight with one another
guess not
You'll be heading east from here, huh
(dull) After the meet
Back to Baltimore
Well
nice to see you again, Lilly
You, too, Roy
Roy finds this parting unsatisfactory, but has nothing to add
With a shrug, he leaves
Lilly looks after him, her expression becoming resentful, dully angry
Prick
- Myra sits in the back seat of a taxi parked across the street from the motel
The door to Lilly's room is visible in b
g
Roy walks toward the street from Lilly's room
Here he comes
see him
Reaching the sidewalk, Roy turns to an empty cab parked on that side of the street, in front of the motel
Myra's driver shifts into gear
(') Wait
Hold it
That's the guy we're following
Just wait
Roy enters the other cab, which drives away, as Lilly comes out of her room in b
g
(') Ah
Lilly gets into her Chrysler, backs away from the slot, drives to the street
(') Now we follow her
You're the boss
on the two vehicles, as they leave the motel
- Where the surf meets the turf
Over the punters' heads, out beyond the track, spreads the Pacific Ocean, unnoticed, ignored
In every shot in this sequence, the ocean is visible but not looked at
on Lilly, with her heavy shoulderbag, moving along empty tables, here and there picking up used tickets
on Myra, on a different level, watching Lilly
on Lilly at the betting windows
on Myra, on a high vantage point in the stands near her watches the field through binoculars
Myra if she can borrow them for a minute
Men are always happy to do Myra favors; the man gives her the binoculars
She looks at the field briefly, then turns and looks through the binoculars the other way, outside the track
The man, surprised, looks the same way
' : The parking area
The man looks in curiosity at Myra, who concentrates, adjusting the focus
' : Foreshortened through the binoculars, Lilly opens the Chrysler's trunk, stashes money
Myra smiles, turns it into a sweet thank-you smile as she returns the binoculars to their owner
- Roy dives into the pool, swims underwater to the ladder, climbs out near a   on a chaise longue, who's been admiring him
You stay down real good
One of my talents
(pointing upward) Your mother's calling
Roy looks up
to show Myra waving from her balcony, four flights up
Roy's at first surprised, then amused by the blonde
Naughty
He gathers up his towel and heads for the building
- Roy stands in heavy spray in the shower, half asleep, gently touching his stomach where the bruise used to be
on door
He ignores it
(
) Roy
You drown in there
He rouses himself
Be right out
- Myra moves away from the bathroom door
She's in a bad mood
She paces back and forth, out onto the balcony, then back into the room as Roy comes out of the bathroom wearing a towel
You were gone for a while
(casual) went out to Delmar
(suddenly wary) ) The track
Did you run into Lilly
saw her
She didn't see you, in other words
'm not trying to make trouble, Roy
It's just, she's always so nasty to me,  thought, who is she to be so high and mighty
saw her out there, and  called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now  know who she is
(dry) You must have some very knowledgeable friends
'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people
Very valuable
Valuable for us
Running your broker scam, you mean
(enthusiastic) You and me, Roy
What a team we'll make
We think alike; we get along together
Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this
You won't regret this, Roy
Regret what
didn't say  was coming aboard
But why not
thought it was settled
What's holding you back
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here
This is time out
She considers him
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here
Easier on home grounds
(shrug) Yes or no
They're both easier at home
Okay
Myra makes a visible effort to be accommodating
Whatever you say, darling
'  - Kaggs sits at his computer terminal, bringing up data, not pleased by what he sees
Buzzer
He swivels to the desk, presses the intercom button
Yeah
(
) Roy Dillon, Mr
Kaggs
Good
Send him in
With a now-we're-getting-somewhere manner, Kaggs turns back to the , punches up a different set of data, sits looking at it in gloomy satisfaction
Roy enters, and Kaggs rises, extending his hand across the desk
They shake hands
Good to have you back, Roy
was just looking at -- Mr
Kaggs, 'm sorry
(keen) You're turning me down
Makes no sense, Roy
guess 'm just not a leader of men
Oh, come on, Roy
The truth is, Mr
Kaggs -- Perk, remember
Okay, fine
Perk, the truth is, like things the way they are now
Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities
well-rounded life
respect that
But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about
Maybe 'm just not ready for that yet
(deep sigh) Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel,  won't badger you
(forced laugh) Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too
Oh, 'd like to stay on
Just keep everything the way it was
That's what we'll do, then
But tell you what, Roy
Before  hire anybody else, 'll ask you one last time
Fair enough
Fair enough
They shake hands
- Roy's room
He has one of the clown pictures face down on the coffee table
He takes money from his jacket pockets, crams it into the space, which is now just about full
As he's tightening the wing nuts closing the back, doorbell
He hurries, finishing the job, hanging the picture on the wall, then crossing to open the door
Myra enters, ebullient
Darling, guess what
had to tell you right away
She gives him an enthusiastic kiss, then marches into the living room
(grinning) And hello to you, too
called a fellow  know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur
There's a sucker there he says is made for us
And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing
Now, can scrape up ten grand without much trouble
That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end
We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position -- Wait a minute
When did this happen, that we're partners
(bewildered) What
The last  looked, we were just talking things over
But the setup's there
It's there now
don't think  need it
You're too good for the small-time, Roy
Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day
Maybe  like it where  am
Myra's need breaks through her good sense
Well, maybe  don't
had ten good years with Cole, and  want them back
gotta have a partner looked and  looked and believe me, brother,  kissed a lot of fucking frogs, and you're my prince
Roy tries to treat this lightly
Don't  get any say in this
No
Because  -- (pointing at her) That's what  say
(thrown off course) What
What  say is, no
We don't do partners
(') (raging) For Christ's sake, why not
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me
've seen people like you before, baby
Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else
But you don't make it work forever
Bullshit
No; history
Sooner or later, the lightning hits
don't want to be around when it hits you
She stares at him, trying to find a chink in the armor, trying to find a reason, trying to find something
What is it
What's going on
'm happy the way  am
By God, it's your mother
It's Lilly
(doesn't get it) ) What
Sure it is
That's why you act so funny around each other
He frowns at her, not believing he understands her right
What's that
Don't act so goddamned innocent
You and your own mother, gah
You like to go back where you been, huh
He takes a step toward her, rising toward fury
You watch that mouth
'm wise to you,  should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch
How is it, huh
How do you like -- He slaps her openhanded but hard, and she staggers back
He pursues her
How do you like this
He slaps her as hard with the other hand
Astonished, frightened, befuddled, she backpedals, bringing her forearms up to protect her face
He grabs her two wrists in one hand, holds them out of the way, slaps her forehand and backhand, forehand and backhand
He suddenly gets control of himself, releases her, steps back into the middle of the room
He's angry, but also remorseful, sorry he lost control but still enraged at the enormity of her suggestion
That's not like me
don't do violence
She cowers against the wall, peering in terror at him through her raised arms
He settles down, becomes heavily calm
That's why we wouldn't work together
You're disgusting
Your mind's so filthy, it's hard even to look at you
He crosses to the apartment door, pulls it open
Sunlight pours in
Goodbye, Myra
She lowers her arms slowly, as though her whole body aches
She's still scared, but angry now, too
She'd like to tell him off, but discretion tells her not to
She moves across the room toward the open door, but stops, not wanting to be that close to him
Understanding, he backs away from the doorway, gestures with cold irony for her to proceed
She moves to the threshold, looks back at him
And you don't even know it
Angry again, Roy steps forward
She hastily steps outside, and he slams the door
'  - Myra moves slowly along the balcony, muttering to herself
Mama
It's Mama
She's the one
She stops, holding the balcony rail, looking out at the city
You'll get yours, Mama
Oh, yes
- Lilly's room; empty
Phone
Lilly enters, tired, with her shoulderbag; the end of her work day
Phone
She frowns at it, expecting nothing good, then drops the shoulderbag on the bed, crosses, answers
Yes
sudden smile doesn't entirely hide the wariness
Roy
An unexpected pleasure
- Roy, troubled, paces while talking on the phone
Lilly, 've got a couple things to think about
Well, kind of job offers, kind of
Different ways to go
'd kind of like to talk them out, you know
Maybe just hear myself talk
- Lilly's delighted, but can't trust this moment more than any other
Well, sure, Roy
You want me to drive up --
Okay, fine, come on down
(kidding) It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know
(kidding) Well, that's good news
He hangs up, but he's nervous, still uncertain, pacing
Well
Who's a boy gonna talk to, if not his mother
The sound of the question makes him laugh
- Myra's Cadillac eases to a stop across the street, where she earlier waited in the cab
through the windshield at Myra, settling down to wait, looking at the motel
- Lilly comes out of the bathroom, putting her lipstick away in a small purse
She's dressed carefully for tonight; upscale and respectable, without being stodgy
She crosses to the window -- night view outside -- and as she pulls the drapes shut the phone
She looks at it in disappointment, crosses to answer
(expecting rejection) Roy
- Irv the accountant's office in Baltimore
He looks secretive and scared, talks in a hush
Lilly, listen, it's Irv
You were always decent with me, 'm taking a hell of a chance here
Somebody blew you out with Bobo
The car full of money
He's -- Lilly
- Empty
The phone receiver dangles off the table on its cord
The door finishes closing
- Lilly's Chrysler jounces out to the street, moving too fast, making the turn, racing away
to Myra's Cadillac, pulling away from the curb, following
with the two cars receding in b
g
- Roy drives down a San Diego street, is stopped by a red light, looks at his watch
He's late
Damn
- Empty; as before
The door opens and the two thugs we saw earlier with Bobo enter, one putting a thick ring of keys away in his jacket pocket
They close the door, look around the room
One goes to the closet, opens it, looks at the clothing inside, while the other goes into the bathroom
The first crosses to the dresser, pulls open a drawer full of clothing
The second comes out of the bathroom
They look at one another
The guy from the bathroom shakes his head
The other one points at the dangling phone, speaks
Somebody spooked her
White Chrysler
Full of cash
They leave the room
- Roy walks toward Lilly's room as the two thugs pass him, on their way out
Roy knocks on Lilly's door, waits, knocks again
He tries to look through a crack in the drapes into the room, then turns to look at the empty place where Lilly's Chrysler had been
He shakes his head, knocks once more, looks at his watch, turns away
(disgusted) Thanks a lot, Lilly
He walks off
- Lilly's white Chrysler pulls off the road into the front parking area of a new small motel
The car brakes to a stop
from the road as Myra's blue Cadillac drives slowly by, while, in b
g
, Lilly gets out of the Chrysler, moving as though she's stiff and tired
Lilly enters the motel office
- The , an elderly woman, turns away from a small  set when Lilly enters
Evening
Welcome to Phoenix
Good evening
'd like a single for tonight
Oh, everything's the same size, same price
The clerk extends a registration card and pen to Lilly, who takes them but doesn't yet start to write
'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night
(sympathetic) Those trucks
know exactly what you mean
Do you have something around back, facing away from the road
The clerk turns to consider the key rack
'll put you in one thirty-one
Very quiet
Faces the desert
Sounds perfect
can park my car back there
Right in front of the room
Fine
She starts to fill in the registration card
And 'll want to leave an early wake-up call
No problem
My husband gets up the crack of dawn
(confidential) It's his kidneys
- Motel in b
g
The blue Cadillac, having turned around and come back, pulls off onto the shoulder of the road about fifty yards short of the motel
- Over Myra's shoulder as she watches, through the windshield, the Chrysler parked in front of the motel
Lilly comes out of the office over there, gets into the Chrysler, backs it up, drives it out of sight past the motel
Myra puts the Cadillac in gear
131 - clean anonymous motel room, with two beds
Lilly enters, very weary, puts her shoulderbag on one of the beds, goes back outside and leaves the door open
She has backed the Chrysler into its spot just outside her room, so its trunk is visible through the open doorway
- on Lilly as she opens the rear door of the Chrysler and leans in
- Lilly wrestles the rear seat out of position, reaches down into the space under and behind it, and brings out a soft cloth overnight bag
It seems not too full but fairly heavy
She puts the bag on the ground outside the car and then pushes and prods the seat back into position
- Lilly shuts the car door, picks up the bag, and enters her room, shutting the door behind her
- Myra enters
The clerk looks at her in surprise
Something wrong
(embarrassed) 'm sorry
thought you were the other lady
No
'm me
231 - Lilly puts the bag on the bed with her shoulderbag
She opens the overnight bag, takes from it a blond wig, a pair of horn rim glasses and a passport
From her shoulderbag she takes the pistol and silencer
She attaches the silencer to the pistol and puts the pistol under the pillow of the other bed
- Myra's checking in
She fills in the registration card while the clerk considers her key rack
'll give you one oh seven
That's a very nice room, very handy, in the front, right by the pool
Oh, don't you have something around back, where it's quieter
The clerk sighs, looks at the key she'd taken from the rack, reluctantly goes back to consider the situation again
Everybody wants the back tonight
guess everybody wants privacy
131 - Lilly, in nightgown, yawning, comes out of the bathroom, switching off its light
The shoulderbag and overnight bag and overnight bag's contents are still on one bed
Lilly gets into the other, switches off the light
119 - Virtually identical to Room 131
Myra enters, lugging a suitcase, and shuts the door behind herself
She puts the suitcase on one of the beds, opens it, paws through it, and brings out slippers, nightgown and robe
Briskly, she strips and puts on the nightgown, the slippers and the robe
Back into the suitcase, she brings out a small snubnose pistol which she puts in the pocket of her robe
Next out of the suitcase is a large ring of keys
Sitting on the other bed, she compares her room key with keys on the ring, takes three keys from the ring, and puts them in her robe pocket along with the room key
Getting to her feet, she crosses to the dresser, picks up the ice bucket, and leaves the room, closing the door behind herself
131 - , the door, with its number
to pick up Myra, approaching
She stops at room 132, looks at the Chrysler, smiles at it in proprietary fashion, and pats the Chrysler on the trunk
Then she turns to the room
She takes the keys from her pocket, looks around to be sure she's alone, and bends over the lock
131 - In very dim light, Myra enters the room, closes the door, moves toward the beds
with her
Keeping her eyes on the sleeping form of Lilly, she puts the empty ice bucket on the empty bed, then moves closer to Lilly
in, moving forward as Myra's arms move forward, moving to  on Lilly as Myra's hands (remaining  ) move forward and down
Her hands abruptly clamp on Lilly's throat
- plane lands
- Roy, looking stunned, is among the deplaning passengers spreading out across the terminal
He's met by , a plainclothes detective, and a uniformed
Roy Dillon
Yes
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police
have a car here
Thank you
- The uniformed cop drives
Pierson and Roy sit in back
realize this is a shock
Well, mostly,  don't believe it
That's natural
No
mean,  don't believe it
Lilly is not a suicide
know my mother, nothing would make her check out
'm sorry, it was her all right
Her gun, even
Gun
grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right
It really is your mother, Mister Dillon
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide
(interested) Do you have any particular reason to say that
My mother
Well,  guess it doesn't matter now
She worked for gamblers
She always knew they might turn on her some day
(thoughtful) hit, you mean
Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but 'll certainly consider the possibility
Thank you for telling me
The car stops
Not that it matters
(looks out) This is the morgue
You up to it now
Sure
Let's get it over
One thing  have to caution you about
gunshot wound
(impatient) Yes,  know,  know
(reluctant) Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun
(not understanding) What
'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, 'm, to tell you the truth, Mr
Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here
(low; getting it) Ate the gun
Oh
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem
It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock
(opening the door) Well, let's get the shock over with
- bare bright room with tiled walls, a few plastic chairs, an ordinary office door on one side and wide hospital swinging doors on the other
Pierson and Roy stand watching
Not many laughs in this room, eh
Not many
The swinging doors open and an  wheels in a gurney containing a body covered by a sheet
Roy braces himself
The attendant pulls the sheet away from the face
(') (to the attendant) Remove that
We'll want a full, uh, identification
The attendant removes the sheet
The body wears a nightgown
on Roy, swallowing bile, as he forces himself to move forward and look down at the face
He immediately looks away again
Oh, Jesus
No question, huh
No, its -- Why did she--
He forces himself to look at the body again, his own face full of the unanswerable question
He looks her up and down, then his eyes stop
He focuses on something, a look of surprise coming into his eyes
Roy's : , the body's hands, crossed over the stomach, the wrists crossed, the palms down, the clear backs of both hands visible
, Roy
He knows
Sharpness comes back into his expression
(
) That's that, then
(starting to grin) Oh, yeah
That's that
, Roy and Pierson
Pierson wants to leave, but Roy stands over the gurney
He chuckles
Pierson looks at him, surprised and appalled
Roy ignores him
(') (laughing quietly) Mom
- Myra's baby blue Cadillac drives, at extreme high speed, alone on the highway
- Myra's Cadillac drives slowly past, comes to a stop at the curb half a block away
- through the windshield at the driver, a woman, deeply weary
Her forearms are crossed on top of the steering wheel, her brow resting on the forearms
The burn on the back of her right hand is visible in illumination from a nearby streetlight
Traffic goes by
Lilly lifts her head, looking out at the night
She's very tired, but determined
beside Lilly, inside the car
From the seat beside her she picks up Myra's large dangly earrings and fixes them in place
Then she puts on Myra's big-lensed dark sunglasses
(She's wearing the clothes Myra wore when checking into the motel
) Lilly checks her appearance in the rearview mirror, then gets out of the car
- on Simms at the desk, talking to a steadily at work fixing the switchboard
The last modern thing  liked was the miniskirt
Your technology, now, nobody understands it, and that's the simple fact of the situation
Lilly enters in b
g
, crosses to the elevator, presses the button
Simms waves to her
(calling) ) Evening, Mizz Langley
The elevator door opens, Lilly boards and presses the button
The elevator door closes
New things come in here all the time, how do they work
You can ask your Ph
Ds, your highly educated, intelligent, professional people, you can say to them, how does that work, and you know what they'll tell you
You plug it in
And that's the way the donut dunks
- The balcony leading to Roy's apartment
It's illuminated by a light next to the public door from the interior hall
on that door as Lilly cautiously opens it, looks out and around while remaining mostly behind the door, then focuses on the light
She reaches out and unscrews the bulb
- Roy's place
Dark
of lock being picked
The door opens, showing only blackness outside, Lilly enters and shuts the door, then switches on the main light
Ah  on Lilly, in the middle of the room, distractedly biting her thumbnail as she looks around, calculating
She looks directly at something
Lilly's : One of the box-framed pictures hanging on the wall
Lilly, making up her mind, crosses to the picture and takes it off the wall
She finds it surprisingly heavy
She carries it to the coffee table, puts it down there on its back, sits on the sofa
on Lilly studying the picture
She raps her knuckle against the sides, looks to see if the front or sides open someway, and finally turns the picture over, laying it face down on the coffee table
She sees how to remove the back, lifts it off, and looks at the stacks of money lying in there
, Lilly, almost fainting with relief
Lilly looks at the other picture, looks again at the money, comes to a conclusion
She rises and leaves the room, deeper into the apartment
- Lilly switches on the light as she enters the room
She looks around, crosses to the closet, goes through the stuff in there, finds an old attache case on the shelf
She brings it out, puts it on the bed, opens it
Inside are a few decks of cards and a paperback book
She tosses them onto the bed, checks the case, finds that one of the clasps works but the other doesn't
One is good enough
She carries the attache case out of the room, leaving the light on
- Lilly enters, puts the case on the coffee table beside the picture, scoops the money out of the picture and puts it in the case
Then she unceremoniously dumps the picture on the floor
Lilly takes the second picture from the wall, puts it face down on the coffee table, opens the back, transfers the money to the case
She closes the case, attaches the one clasp that works, picks up the case
(
) Hello, Lilly
, as Lilly whirls around, terrified and then relieved
Roy stands in the open apartment doorway, blackness behind him
Oh
Roy
You scared me
Roy enters the room and shuts the door
Going somewhere
Somewhere else, that's for sure
just came back from Phoenix
(anxious) Oh, yeah
Is the frame holding
Looks very solid, Lilly
Sit down
Take a minute, tell me about it
've really got to -- You're dead, Lilly, it worked
Not for long
Not when they do a fingerprint check
Why should they
The cops are satisfied
Bobo won't be
He'll spend the money to make sure
Even so
You still got time
Relax a minute, tell me what happened
Sit down
He gestures at the sofa
Lilly's holding the attache case
The gutted pictures are lying around, one on the coffee table and one on the floor
She looks around at everything, awkward and embarrassed
But Roy hasn't said anything
And he's between her and the door
Just for a minute
She backs up, sits on the sofa, puts the case on her lap
Roy pulls a chair over so it's directly between Lilly and the door
He sits, looking at her with polite interest
Myra followed you, huh
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo
guess to get me running
Did you tell her about my stash
(isn't worth discussing) No
No, you wouldn't
That's what she was after, though
But why hit on me
wouldn't go in on a deal with her
She blamed you for it
(a shaky laugh) As though you do what  say
(cold grin) That's pretty funny, all right
What happened in Phoenix
Remembered emotion makes Lilly talk in little fast clusters of words
Roy, it was terrible
You read about people killing people and all that, but when it happens, my God
- Myra, in nightgown, carrying the ice bucket, approaches Room 131
She was in her nightgown, you know, the old grifter's dodge, nightgown and the Ice bucket and she just got into the wrong room by mistake
131 - , Lilly asleep
Very dim light
The shadows shift on her face as Myra    approaches
Myra's hands , abruptly clamp on Lilly's throat
Lilly's eyes pop open wide, staring, her mouth stretches open
Myra's arms are locked straight, pressing her weight down onto her hands squeezing Lilly's throat
Lilly clutches at Myra's fingers, tries to reach Myra's face, twists and squirms, then suddenly lifts her arm up and behind her head, hand dipping under the pillow, coming out with the silenced gun, pushing the gun upward, straight-arm, the gun moving up of shot
Blood sprays Lilly's face
Myra's body drops down onto her, at an angle, so we can still see Lilly's horrified face over Myra's shoulder as Lilly gasps for breath
- Lilly stares across the room, breathing hard, reliving the experience
sat in there with her,  thought, what do  do now
Run and 've got Bobo and the law after me
Stay, and how do  explain
This way's perfect
Lilly sits back, showing that relief again
It is, isn't it
And maybe it's a break for me after all
've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now 'm out
can make a clean start, and -- You've already made a start
Doesn't look that clean, though
Here's the awkwardness
Lilly looks guilty and embarrassed
'm sorry
hated to take your money, but -- Don't be sorry
You're not taking it
Lilly reacts as though he's slapped her
But then she gets her determination back
She splays out both hands, palm down, on the attache case on her lap
need this, Roy
can't run without money, and if  can't run 'm dead
You must have some money
Just a few bucks
And Myra's stuff
(scornful) Her credit cards
How far am gonna get with that
Far enough
Maybe up to San Francisco
Or St
Louis, someplace new
Start over
At what
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking
You won't have any trouble finding a job
(appalled) job
've never had a legit job in my life
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this
square job and a quiet life
You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you
(exasperated) Roy,  know what to do with myself
It's a big world out there
Not any more
Lilly, listen, 'm giving you good advice
'm following it myself
(doesn't get it) What
thought it over, and you were right
You wanted me out of the rackets, and now -- (bedeviled, aggravated) Roy, that's fine, but  don't have time for this
Bobo -- thought you'd be happy for me
After all, you -- Bobo isn't after you
Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good
But so am
'm a survivor, Roy survive
know you do, so that's why -- And to survive, my way,  need money
Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so  didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead
So that leaves this
No
Lilly sits back again, brooding at Roy, trying to think how to get to him, how to get through him or around him
She sighs, licks her lips
You want a drink
don't think so
You probably shouldn't either
No, but 'm goddamn thirsty
Ice water
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice
'll get it
She stands, putting the attache case on the sofa next to where she was sitting
Roy, with a faint smile, watches her leave the room
- Very small, little used
Dark
Lilly switches on the light when she enters, then leans against the counter, fists clenched and trembling on the counter in front of her
She grits her teeth, hyperventilates, stares around the room in search of escape, an answer, something
, Lilly's face, desperate, grim, but not giving up
Lilly opens cabinets, finds two glasses, opens the nearly-empty refrigerator, gets ice cubes from a tray, puts them in the glasses, puts the partial tray back in the freezer compartment, fills the glasses from the cold water tap, puts the glasses on the counter, stares at them briefly
She then shakes her head, searches the kitchen some more, and finds a cookie sheet she can use as a tray
She puts the glasses on the tray, carries the tray from the room, leaving the light on
- Lilly enters with the tray, crosses to Roy, presents the glasses, speaks as he reaches for one
Take whichever one you want
He hesitates
It hadn't occurred to him Lilly might try to poison him or knock him out
He grins at her and takes a glass
You wouldn't do that
Lilly takes the other glass, puts the cookie sheet on a table, looks down at Roy
You don't know what 'd do, Roy
You have no idea
To live
(easy) Oh, you'll live, Lilly
Lilly crosses back to the sofa, sits beside the attache case, pats it absently as though it is a pet and she's glad it didn't move, waited for her
She sips water, puts the glass on the end table
know what's bugging you, of course
Oh
didn't know anything was
(twisted grin) Oh, really
You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy,  don't deny that
wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid
(full laugh) Not very good
She nods, accepting the correction
bad mother
By any standards
've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then
know just how bad  was
(closed against her) Uh-huh
wonder did you ever think about it from my side
(not worth discussing) Never
No,  guess not
It was pretty lousy of me,  guess, to be a child at the same time you were
Not to stop being a child just because had a child
guess  was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up
Roy didn't expect to be made uncomfortable and defensive, and he resents it
What do you want me to do
Pin a halo on you
You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh
But that's the way  am, you know, the way 've always been
Always picking on poor little Roy
For God's sake, Lilly
(intense) gave you your life twice
'm asking you to give me mine once need the money
(not worth discussing) No
Lilly subsides back onto the sofa
One hand rests on the attache case
With the other, she sips water, puts the glass back down
Roy watches her, unmoving, expressionless
Lilly frowns, not quite looking at him
You're getting off the grift
That's right
That's good
You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know
(amused) don't
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age
don't see why not
Well,  guess  got it wrong, then
Seems to me  heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him
Roy's again unexpectedly uncomfortable
He shifts uneasily in his chair, trying to think of a response
Well, uh
Sure, sure, that doesn't count
That's different
Well, it doesn't matter, does it
'm getting out
(intense) And that's why you've got to get rid of this money
If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are
It'll be a temptation to get back into the game
(full laugh) Oh, that's it
You're stealing my money for my own good
How very motherly of you, Lilly
Once again, Lilly drops back against the sofa back
Another round in the fight is over
Roy watches her, patient, waiting for her to give up, seeing no other outcome
on Lilly, frustrated, feeling the need to move, the pressure of pursuit
Her head turns back and forth, her body starts false gestures
Finally, abruptly, she gets to her feet, looks at Roy, looks away, picks up the attache case
, Roy, alert
He won't let her reach the door
with Lilly as she prowls the room, pacing back and forth, the attache case swinging at her side
Finally, she stops, standing the attache case on the coffee table, her hand still on its handle
Lilly
She looks at him, attentive without hope
If  should get out of the racket, that goes double for you
That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself
If you try to do it your way, what future is in it
future
The only future 've got
That money wouldn't last forever
And then what
You'd be back in some other part of the rackets
Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands
This way, you've got to go the square route
You could send me a card when you're settled,  could maybe help out sometimes
(bitter laugh) ) That's what it is, isn't it
Keep me down
Your turn to be in charge, have the power
(stonewalling) Just trying to help, Lilly
She sits on the sofa again, this time leaving the attache case to stand on the coffee table
She studies Roy, calculating
Roy
What if  told you  wasn't really your mother
That we weren't related
(bewildered) What
Lilly leans back again, but this time her manner is different; languorous, sexy
She crosses her legs, the upper leg swinging gently
She smiles gently, encouragingly, at Roy
You'd like that, wouldn't you
Sure you would
You don't need to tell me
Now, why would you like it, Roy
on Roy, understanding and not wanting to understand
(hoarse) What's that all about
Of course you're my mother
Of course you are
Lilly leans forward toward Roy, inviting him
(very soft) Roy
Roy Roy will not let anything complicated come to the surface
There's nothing more to talk about
(very soft) have to have that money, Roy
What do  have to do to get it
on Roy, his face bruised-looking, eyes scared
He will not know what's going on
He shakes his head, not trusting himself to speak
on Lilly, leaning forward, tension showing through the seductive manner
No
Won't you give me the money, Roy
Can't  change your mind
What can  do to change your mind
, as Lilly gets to her feet and takes a step toward him
Roy's pressed back into his chair, trying to maintain a cold facade
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing
Is there nothing  can do, Roy, nothing at -- They both turn away at the same instant
Roy turns to the side to pick up the glass of water, to break the spell and the tension
Lilly turns back toward the coffee table and picks up the attache case
Roy, lifting the glass to drink, turns forward again as Lilly spins forward, swinging the attache case at his head with all her might
The case crashes into the glass and into his face
Roy  and topples off the chair, as the one remaining clasp on the case lets go and money goes flying, filling the air
at Roy, face up, expression horrified, hands to his throat
large triangle of glass is in his throat
Blood pumps thickly, fountaining up
, Lilly, staring down in horror
She lurches forward, but there's nothing to do
She stares around
, wads of bills on the floor, getting bloody
, Lilly, in agony, but looking down, kicking
, Lilly's feet kicking the bills away from the blood
, as Lilly drops to her knees beside Roy, who's already dying
Blood spurts less forcefully
His hands fall to his sides, eyes stare upward, mouth still moves slightly
Lilly, shoving money away with her hands now, stares at him, willing it not to happen
He stops moving
His eyes dull
Lilly clasps her arms around herself
She knows she doesn't dare scream
Lips drawn back in a snarl, teeth clenched, she her agony through her teeth
She ; she ; she
Then, slowly, she regains control
as Lilly gets to her feet
She seems dazed now, like someone who's just been in a traffic accident
She blunders around the room, kicks the attache case, bends to pick it up
She studies the clasp, sees it still works, goes back to her knees
, Lilly in f
g
, Roy in b
g
, as Lilly repacks the money into the case, wiping the blood from some wads onto the carpet
Finishing, she closes the case, then remains on her knees, bending over the case
She  grindingly
, entrance door in b
g
Lilly's weeping subsides
She gets wearily to her feet, and leaves the room of water running in sink
Lilly reappears
She does not again look toward Roy
