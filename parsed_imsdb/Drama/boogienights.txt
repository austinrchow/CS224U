In the back of the class, sitting at a desk is Rollergirl
walks about, handing out the final exam
Rollergirl looks it over; a lot of questions, diagrams and generally confusing material
She looks across the room; Two  are looking at her and chuckling to themselves
One guy looks to the other and makes a "blow job" gesture

Other students notice and smile

-   - semi-high end stereo store in the valley
Buck, dressed in his usual cowboy-digs, is talking to a  about a stereo unit
The manager, a skinny-white guy with a mustache and mustard suit,  (30s) is standing nearby
-- so basically you're gettin' twice the base, cause of the TK421 modification we got in this system here
don't know - do  need that much bass
If you want a system to handle what you want -- yes you do
See this system here
This is Hi-Fi
"High Fidelity
" What that means is that it's the highest quality fidelity
It's the price -- have this unit at home
really
Yes
But -- 've got it modified with the TK421, which is a bass unit that basically kicks in another two, maybe three quads when you really crank -- lemme put another eight track in so you can get a better idea what 'm talkin about -- Buck ejects the Eight Track that was playing and puts in his own of a country western song
Hear that bass
It kicks and turns and curls up in your belly, makes you wanna freaky-deaky, right
If you get this unit as it is -- it won't sound like this without the modification -- and we do that for a small price
The Customer listens another moment, then; Thank you for your time
No problem
The Customer exits and Jerry approaches Buck
the fuck was that
Wha
Have  told you
Huh
Have
What
don't -- Alright:
) You play that country western-crap and no one's gonna buy a stereo
You throw on some  and the Sunshine Band, a guy looks a particular way -- and you've seen the profile sheet -- you throw on some Led Zeppelin
No
Instead, you play this twingy-twangy, yappy-dappy music
What kinda brother are you anyway, listening to that shit
Hey, Jerry, look -- No, you look
gave you a job here because  thought your film work might bring some nice pussy in the place -- and it has -- but  can't have anymore fuck ups -- you dig

Dirk gets in the backseat of the car with Rollergirl
: 23
'   -  - In a booth, after the meal
Dirk and Rollergirl on one side, Jack and Amber on the other
This thing here,  mean, you understand one thing and that's this: It costs
mean, this stuff costs good ol' American Green
You got film, you got lights, you got sound, lab fees, developing, synching, editing -- next thing you know you're spending thirty/forty thousand a picture
That's a lot of money
Hell yes it's a lot of money, but lemme tell you something else: You make a good film and there's practically no end to the amount of money you can make, Eddie
Have you seen Jack's house
She watches Dirk
() No
() He'll see it
() He'll see it
() Eddie: You got ten, fifteen people around and that's just to make sure the lighting is right
shit, this is not an operation for the weak, and lemme tell you something else: When all is said and done, you gotta have the juice, you understand
mean
you can work on your arms, your legs, workout morning, day, noon, night, the whole deal, but when it comes right down to it
what we need is Mr
Torpedo Area, y'understand
Mr
Fun Zone
Okay, let's say you got that: right

Do  need that
No
need actors
Uhhh-ohhh
here we go -- -- Alright, yeah,  need the big dick, and the big tits -- that  them in the theater
What keeps them in their seats even after they've come
Huh
The beauty and the acting
If you're able to give it up and show the world: No, not just your cock
Fuck that
What 'm talking about is showing your insides, from your heart
you understand
Hey, Sure:
That's one thing
don't want 'em showing up, sitting down, jacking off and splitting on the story
don't want to make that film
wanna make the thing that keeps 'em around even after they've come
what happens when you come
You're done, you wanna split
My idea, my goal: Suck 'em in with the story
they'll squirt their load and sit in it
Just To See How The Story Ends
Sometimes we make these films, we wanna make people laugh a little, then get into it and fuck heavy: That's good and that's fine
But  got a dream of making a film that's true
true and right and dramatic
Right
right
understand
Don't listen too hard to all this, honey
it's just nice in theory
It's a dream to be able to find a cock and an actor
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
If you don't have dreams you have nightmares

Good dilemma

" Well, the story goes and develops with Amber auditioning various men and women
the whole thing wraps up with the Landlord, 'd like to get Jeremy if he's still in town to play the part -- he comes in -- the landlord says: You better pay rent or you're through
Well, Amber does one helluva suck job, ass fuck, come in the face, sort of thing and fade out - the end

It's a great look for you,  think

Um
oil painting
No
yes,  mean
but we were talkin' about
Oh
Oh
"Sunsets
" Oh yeah
was saying:  like sunsets too
but
Sunrises are better
Exactly
thought  was the only one who thought that
think that
never thought we'd have so much in common, Buck
Yeah, yeah
hey, have you ever heard of my stereo system
No
'know 'm thinking of opening my own business -- Really
It's my dream
Hi-Fi Stereo Equipment at a discount price -- it's called "Buck's Super Stereo World
" That's a fucking great idea
: 91
'  - Jack, Floyd Gondolli and the Colonel sitting
so let's talk about the future
So let's talk about what video means to this industry -- and let's talk about how all of us -- not one of us -- but all of us will profit
've been doing theater work in San Francisco and San Diego for as long as you've been doing stag and hardcore, Jack
know you're history, Floyd
No one's doubting your history or your credentials, Floyd
Then why the resistance
mean: This industry is going to be turned upside down soon enough -- Then why help it
Why not be prepared
The money comes from the Colonel, the talent comes from you, Jack
've got a connection to the equipment and the mail order distribution, not to mention those kids  got out there who are hot-fuck-action to the max
This is the future
Video tape tells the truth
have a stable of actors and actresses
They're professionals
They're not a bunch of fucking amateurs
They're proven box office and they get people in theaters (where films should be seen) and they know how to fuck well -- That's right, Jack and by that same token, you're the one with the power here
The video revolution is upon us -- and our role is critical
We have an obligation to use our resources and talent to help make it fly -- You come in here, at my party, tell me about this and that -- tell me about the future, tell me about -- video and amateurs and all that -- well lemme tell you something now: will not shoot films on video and no will not loan out my actors who are under contract to me
Period
Wait a minute, Jack
'm not a complicated man
like cinema
In particular,  like to see fucking on film
don't want to win an Oscar and  don't want to re-invent the wheel --  enjoy simple pleasures like butter in my ass and lollipops in my mouth
That's me -- call me crazy, call me a pervert, but this is something  enjoy
One other small thing  want to do in this life is make a dollar and a cent in this business -- 'm not trying to hurt you
'm trying to help you stay one step ahead of the game -- We're repeating ourselves now, Floyd
Jack,  think this is about cost and future -- The future is as bright as we make it -- it shouldn't be sacrificed for a few dollars that can be saved shooting on video tape -- if it looks like shit and sounds like shit, it probably is shit -- think you're one gin past this conversation -- No
no
'm crystal clear here
Jack, please understand that this is not an argument
this is a fact of -- What
This is not an argument, but a -- What are you saying
What do you mean, Jack, c'mon -- Are you telling me that you're working with this shit
think that there is a serious case to be made for the price and the gamble on the whole idea of a home video market -- Jack: Two, three years from now, everyone's gonna be able to walk into their local supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette -- True film fans won't watch that shit
It doesn't look good and more importantly it doesn't make sex look sexy
It doesn't have to look good, Jack
Film is just too damn expensive
The theaters are already planning converting to video projectors
haven't heard that
It's true
We've got ten minutes until the New Year and  don't want it to start like this so 'm leaving now
We will or we won't continue this conversation some other time
Jack leaves
Floyd looks to the Colonel

It's gonna be a new year and we're gonna start things and do things and  want you to know how much really care for you, honey
care for you so much
you're my little baby
Thank you, Amber
You're the best thing in the world that's happened to me since my son went off

Amber continues to talk as she sets up more lines of coke

They all take seats
Hello, Judge
Introductions happen, etc
The Judge looks over some files; You've been divorced for six years
Yes
Since 1977
(to lawyer) And the agreement on the money settlement was taken care of
Yes
So
What we're talking about then is coming to an agreement on custody of Andrew
Yes
What was decided during the divorce
Initially, Andrew went with his father, and visitation was given to his mother on -- (looks at a paper) from Saturday Noon to Sunday at seven
With his mother entitled to bring Andrew to her home or any reasonable place
(to Amber) Was that the understanding
Yes
And why wasn't that visiting privilege honored
Well, it was for a time -- only saw him twice
It said, "reasonable place," and  didn't think a house of drugs and prostitution and pornography was that
'm sorry, what is it that you -- My ex-wife is involved in the pornography business --  didn't think that environment was a safe place for my son
This is not right
My son was never exposed to pornographic material or drugs or any of these things, my husband just assumed -- saw it with my own eye
Amber has no response
The Judge looks down at the file
Did you register this as a complaint
My client didn't officially register, but  think the circumstance called for something immediate -- for the safety of the child
How old is the boy now
He's twelve
He'll be thirteen next month
Where do you live now
We live in Long Beach
have a job there and my new wife is home with him
(pause) You see, the problem is, Judge, is that my ex-wife is a sick
she is a very sick person and she needs help
She deals in drugs and sex for a living -- don't do drugs
Your honor, she has been in and out of trouble with the law on quite a few occasions regarding this sort of thing
