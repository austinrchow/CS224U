by Clark Gregg June 14, 1999 : Moving through a murky haze
Dark blues and greens, shafts of prismed purple
pale shard appears in the distance
Gliding closer, a group of tiny fish dart before the camera
We're
Arriving at the form, it finally sharpens into focus
It's a '  submerged in dark water, arms floating lazily at her side
The face is obscured by flowing hair
All that is visible is a pair of , , which blink closed
: then open as  , as a   emerges from water
awakens from this unsettling dream in her bathtub
She pivots the large    (the kind that moves up and down on a pipe) off to one side, reaches toward her feet and we hear the sound of a plug being pulled
- -- accompanied by a whirring sound
steam covered mirror is cleared with a
Claire starts to come into focus
The dryer stops
She presses the red
button on the socket
big blue spark shoots out
Claire pulls her hand back
and the dryer starts whirring again
She clears the mirror and replaces the dryer on a hook
She regards herself in the mirror, and attractive, elegant- looking woman around forty
Claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek, as if confirming her existence
'  - Claire, now dressed, presses her face against a door, listening for the sounds of stirring from within
Silence
She quietly pushes open the door
- Claire makes her way past half-filled boxes and duffels to a window, then pulls the curtains to reveal: ,
It couldn't be more picturesque 24'  is moored at the dock and an sits on a point across the lake
The sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from still shrouded by covers
Claire sits beside the sleeping form
She scans the room briefly, taking in a Greenpeace flag and a picture of a tomboyish ten year-old girl at camp
She gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same face, now a waifish, pretty seventeen year-old, with chopped hair and tiny nose ring
Claire leans over and inhales the sleeping scent of her only daughter,
She places her hand on a cheek
The girl's eyelids flutter softly
Morning, beauty
Caitlin lets out a grunt and rolls over onto her belly
Let's go
Or we'll never leave on time
From out of the pillow comes Caitlin's voice
(muffled) 'm totally ready
Claire glances around at the piles of unpacked clothes
Come on, 'll make you some waffles, maybe we'll squeeze in a trip to the mall
(beat) Caitlin
Claire gently swats at the tiny lump that is Caitlin's behind
Mother
Claire stands and instinctively scoops up some clothes from the floor, then folds and neatly stacks them on a box
Caitlin turns her head sideways on the pillow
You're such a morning person
Claire turns at the door
It is unwise to heckle the keeper of the plastic
She starts to leave
Caitlin calls out
(
) Blueberries
Claire smiles as she closes the door behind her
- Claire bends down to pick up one of Caitlin's socks
When she stands, something catches her eye out a window
She gazes down, transfixed
Through a stand of trees over a   , is in the midst of a heated argument next door
Claire watches as the , a large imposing man with an unruly shock of red hair, snarls at his wife across the hood of their huge old Buick
She tries to get a glimpse of the woman, but all that's visible is
,   encircles Claire's waist
She lets out a small gasp as a hand closes on her breast
It's Claire's husband,
, nibbling gently at her neck
He's older than she, pushing fifty, with silver streaks beginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes him look more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach than the prominent academic that he is
Claire, however, can't take her eyes off the scene below
They at it again
Claire nods
Christ, that's twice in
When did they move in
think three
Three weeks
She continues to gaze downward
The man leans over the hood, murmuring darkly at his wife, though for Claire and Norman the scene is entirely silent
What's their name
Feur,  think
Psych department
Figures
They're all psychotic
Outside, Mr
Feur turns and walks toward his house
Norman begins, once again, to nuzzle Claire
Her eyes close, but then she gently demurs
She's awake
We'll be quiet
Quick and quiet
She turns to him
don't want to be either
He smiles
really good smile
The lips and tongue on his faded -shirt mark him as a 'Stones fan
When's she out of here
Norman Spencer
Norman gives up
He busses her cheek
(moving toward the stairs) Alright
can't take the rejection
'm going to class
Don't
Claire,  have to show up for the-- It's Saturday
Norman stops
knew that
You think  didn't know that
She smiles at him
After a beat: It's today
(wistfully) Yep
They share a warm, poignant look
He turns and moves down the stairs
(calling over his shoulder) We're going to have to leave by three if we want to beat the traffic
Claire returns her gaze to the scene below as Mr
Feur says something ominous to his wife, then stalks into the house
(
) Claire
(absently) Three o'clock
Mrs
Feur drops her face into her hands
- Claire peruses her "to do" list as Caitlin munches a panini
and  still think we should get you some mittens
Caitlin puts down the sandwich and regards her mother warmly
The bond between them is palpable
Do you have a scarf
Hey
Claire looks up from her little pad of paper
Yes
It's only two hours away
know that
'll come back all the time
Of course you will
'm just saying, you're going to be fine
Claire smiles
Sweetheart, 've known this day was coming for a long time
've got your father and the garden and the new house
You really don't have to worry
Caitlin smiles back and nods, her face betraying some concern
Claire takes her hand
Really
She nods reassuringly and pulls Caitlin into an embrace
Her eyes close
(
) Mother
- Claire's frozen in the hug
(beat) Mom
Her eyes open
Widen to reveal Claire, holding Caitlin on the college campus
The   looms in the background
have'ta go
After a moment's hesitation, she releases her grip
Caitlin glances over her shoulder to make sure no one's witnessed this overt display of maternal affection
'll call you
Claire produces an , which she presses into her daughter's hand
It's a book of
Come home anytime
Caitlin looks at Norman
Really gonna leave me, huh
She nods
They share a tender look
Be good
She throws her arm, briefly, tightly around his waist
bit overwhelmed, he slowly brings his hand to the back of Caitlin's head
After a moment, she steps back
Bye
then turns and makes her way toward the large, old Columbia dorm
banner is draped across its portals which reads: "   '04
" Claire watches her daughter melt into a crowd of similarly shaggy freshmen, smoking and talking on the front steps
Her eyes are shining
Norman wraps an arm around her waist as she daps at a tear with a Kleenex
(smiling) almost made it
They turn and head for the car
Claire sneaks one last look over her shoulder
Caitlin glancing back at Claire with an apprehensive smile
'  - Claire walks in from the bathroom wearing a sexy cotton nightgown
Norman is in bed, absorbed in some notes
She gets into bed, then picks up a thick text from beside him and starts reading
After a moment: Whatcha reading
(reading the cover, sexy voice) Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms
(slight smile) How is it
Claire snuggles up
Excellent
Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell
(lost in his book) Nice
(beat) Almost done
She pulls slightly away
If you have to work
No, no
'm just about
(beat) There
He places his book on the bedside table and turns to her
How are you
Fine
It's okay if you're not
am, really
It's just she's been the focus for a while
Not the focus
You know what  mean
Claire thinks for a moment
To tell you the truth
'm excited
You are
To get my life back
To have some time for myself
Some time for us
He caresses her
You did a great job
She's a good kid
We did
There's a weighty pause
It's just us now
know
He kisses her
Tired
Nope
Wanna fool around
Yup
They start to kiss
It's slow and a bit methodical in the manner of long time lovers
Suddenly, the can be heard
They stop
Did you
Shhh
They listen
The sounds start to become louder
It is clearly two people in the throes of some very vocal and savage love making
Jesus
He walks over and closes the window
It doesn't help
guess they're making up
The woman's moaning becomes embarrassingly loud
What is he doing to her
They lie together in silence as the cacophony drones on
And we moved out here for the quiet
Mmm
Beat
The mood has passed
Maybe we should just
Tomorrow
'm finished at three
No
Squash with Stan
After that
'll be there
Beat
Love you
She smiles
Night
They lie together in the darkness as the Feurs finally climax
'  - Claire pushes open the door to Caitlin's room carrying an armful of
She moves quickly to the bureau, not wanting to spend much time in here, then grabs a from the pile, and drops it into a drawer
She's just about to close it, when something catches her eye
' She drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered, old - with a very seventies logo from the drawer
Claire gazes around the room, which is a reliquary of Caitlin's recently concluded childhood; , , She brings the now faded -shirt to her face and drinks in the smells
She stares down at the word "Juilliard
" : - ""
now it's on the same -shirt only Claire's wearing it and she's much younger
It's an old photograph in an album
Younger Norman stands next to her in the shot, his arm draped around her waist
stands beside her
Claire glances around at several hastily unpacked boxes and sees propped in the corner
She gazes at other photos
-- Claire in her wedding dress, Norman beside her in a tux with a very wide bow-tie
-- Claire and Norman in front of a tiny Caitlin rests on her hip
Claire's chin begins to tremble and she chokes out a sob
- Her face streaked with tears, Claire stumbles out into the immaculately manicured
The yard is surrounded by a
She collapses into a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside
Suddenly, she hears something coming from next door
She cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound
It is, ironically, the sound of a
Claire makes her way over to the fence
The women's sobbing becomes more plaintive and fevered
She places her face against the prickly, vine covered fence and tries to peer through the crack
All she can make out is that seems to be rocking
Claire gathers her nerve and calls out
Hello
There's no reaction
Mrs
Feur
The sobbing chokes down to a breathless whimpering
The blue shape vanishes from view
Wait a minute
just want-- Something bumps against the fence
Claire draws back
She hears heavy breathing
(sniffling) Who are you
It's Mrs
It's Claire
Spencer
From next door
Is everything-- You're the flower lady
Um
yes
've seen you
From the window
Is everything alright
Claire leans closer to the tiny crack
She sees a fleshy blur and what might be part of an eye
There's no response, just the breathing
Hello
'm not
She seems on the verge of losing it again
He's so
it's too much
and  can't can't breath
Who
Your husband
And 'm afraid
Oh god, 'm so afraid of
She trails off
What
What are you afraid of
can't, no, no,  can't
Claire edges closer to the crack
Tell me
Please
That 'll just
that one day 'll just
disappear
Beat
Claire's taken aback by this admission
Tell me
can help you
How
How can you help me
With your flowers and your perfect life
That's not
It's not like that
've never even met you
know
And 'm sorry
've been consumed with
my daughter left
for school
This fence
it's so
'm sorry
It's for the flowers
Why don't you
Tires can be heard crunching the gravel as a car pulls into the Feur's driveway
Oh God
He's back
'm sorry
Please forget that
don't know what 'm saying
Please
Wait
Don't go
Claire listens to the sound of  , followed by a swinging shut
swings open and a '  follow down the path
Claire pulls back from the crack and leans against the fence as the door closes a second time
She sits there for a moment listening, but all is quiet
(
) She sounded terrified
- Claire and Norman eat dinner
rainstorm pelts the windows
Of what
Of him  think
Did she say that
More or less
Norman chews
Honey, they're young
They're probably newlyweds
'm telling you
There was something in her voice
Remember how we were
Not like this
We were never like this
(beat) want to go over there
After dinner, we can-- Why
To make sure she's all right
Norman puts down his fork
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of-- (overlapping) That's not what 'm sug-- when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake
But what if something happens
Claire
'd never be able to live with mysel-- (reassuring) Nothing's going to happen
(beat) Besides,  have to work tonight
The conference is in less than two weeks
've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer
(beat) This is
know
It's what 've been working for
She glances down at her untouched plate
just wish you could have heard her
Look, 'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what  can find out
Promise
He gives her a "Didn't  just say so" look
She smiles
'll make you some coffee
She reaches for his plate to clear it
Norman grabs her hand and kisses it
'  - Norman snores softly
Claire is awakened by the continuing She pads out to Norman's turreted library
Rain pelts the glass
Her face is briefly illuminated by the She hears the sound of a   and moves to get a better view of the Feur's
Nothing but blackness
Just as she's turning to go back to bed
lights up the night
Claire's eyes go wide
' In the split second of brilliance, she sees Mr
Feur, in shirtsleeves, drenched, dragging    toward the open trunk of his car
(in a hoarse whisper) Norman
He's dead to the world
She calls to him again
Norman, you have to look at this
Mmnph
Hurry
Another flash illuminates
Norman at her side
Look
an  , then blackness
What is it
What's the matter
She stares down into the darkness
Nothing
There was
thought  saw something
Is it gone
illuminates the empty driveway
She nods
Come on, let's go back to bed
Yet another bolt of lightning reveals Claire, still at the window
- Claire sets up a camera and tripod
She steps back and aims her camera
She glances up at a large upstairs window at the '
One side of the curtain seems to be pulled open, but no one's there
Feeling self-conscious, she turns back to the camera
The morning sun hits the flowers just right and she against her lovely house
She glances back at the Feur's window
The She walks over to the fence and tries to peek through it
When this doesn't work, she drags a lawn chair over and peers across the fence
She can barely see over, but glimpses: in the mud of the driveway
Just then, a car pulls into the driveway, Claire scrambles down from her perch
- Claire walks out to find her best friend, , pretty, in her forties, wearing hip, hippie-ish clothes
Hey there
Jody hugs her
How you holding up
Good
'm good
You are
Why does everyone find that so surprising
(are you kidding
) Cause
your
only daughter just went away to school
who you were incredibly close with aaand 'd be tripping
Okay, 'm a little tender
Well good
So you're human
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club
Wow
Got here just in time
(reaching into her bag) brought you this
She proffers several homemade tea bags
What is it
Kambucha mushroom tea
Jody-- It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness
Sela suggested  bring-- You're discussing me with your psychic
She's not a psychic
Just a very enlightened spirit
Thanks, but 'm fine
(pressing it into her hand) So you'll have some later
(beat) Notice anything
different
Claire gives her friend the once over, then notices the mint Karman-Ghia behind her
Oh my god
You bought it
Yep
It's niiice
Beautiful thing, alimony
Lose a husband, get a car
Think it'll help me pick up dudes
Absolutely
Listen, 've gotta run
just thought 'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning
You got it
Jody grins
See you then
Jody drives off
Claire walks down the driveway to her front door and sees Mr
Feur staring at her from a window
She starts to wave, but the curtain is drawn shut
Claire arrives at the front door and reaches out to touch the doorknob
She stops
can be heard from within
Claire quietly opens the door and moves into: - Claire stops inside the door
Now it sounds like
Two voices, tense, impassioned
It seems to be coming from Norman's study
She gathers her nerve, then bursts into the room
'  - But the whispering has suddenly stopped
Hello
The lovely circular room is completely empty
She looks around, puzzled
Cooper, the family's aging lab, casually ambles over
(to Cooper) Please tell me you heard that
- Claire and Cooper, out on a walk, emerge onto large rocks at the water's edge
Claire tosses a long stick for Cooper, who bolts out onto the
Claire gazes at the across the lake and a long  in the distance
Cooper starts  and looking down into the water
Claire arrives at Cooper's side and stares down into the dark water
Cooper
what do you see
She looks down and sees nothing but her own reflection
After a moment, she notices a    directly in the reflection of her face
Cooper rumbles a low growl
The shape seems to be gaining definition
Claire gasps quietly, then reaches into a pocket in her sweater and pulls out a cordless phone
(into phone) Hi
(
) (on the other end) 'm stuck here for another couple of hours
Claire's smile fades
Oh
(
) Unless you need me to come home
No, no
It's fine
Claire slowly leans out over the water to check her reflection
(
) You sure
but the shape is gone
(
) Claire
Huh
Absolutely
Take your time
She clicks off the phone and looks down at the calm water
- Claire sits in a small workroom at a computer
She focuses intently on the screen
It's '
She flips the last card and an animated Queen of Hearts, accompanied by a series of musical notes, parades across the screen
(on computer) You lost
Off with your head
Claire hits "New Game" and watches as a fresh hand of cyber solitaire is dealt
She suddenly has a thought and disappears into the kitchen
- She glances at Jody's tea, smiles, then refills her glass of red wine
She picks up the phone from its cradle and moves into: - She dials a number
can be heard blaring through the phone
(straining to be heard) Hello
'm looking for Caitlin Spencer
She's in 314
Well, could you check
She plugs one ear
Oh
Well, just tell her that her mother called
Her mother
Thank you
Excuse me, how can you study with that
The noise abruptly stops
Claire clicks off the phone and replaces it in the sweater pocket
She tunes the stereo to a classical music station
- She walks in, places the cordless phone on a  , then hears a different set of musical notes from the computer
She stares at the screen, stunned
The game has been finished
Cards with faces swarm chaotically across the screen with the message:
Oh
Kay
Without warning, the radio dial rips cacophonously past several stations and comes to a stop on some angry, punkish rock and roll
Jesus
She bolts around a corner to the stereo
The music is chaotic and deafening
She finds Cooper growling at
no one
She turns off the stereo
Cooper suddenly bolts down the hall
She follows him
- The foyer's empty, but the front door is open
Claire nervously walks out and looks around
Cooper
- No sign of the dog
Claire turns to go back inside
When she touches the doorknob, she hears the whispering again
fleeting shadow draws her eye to a    which reflects directly into the study
Hello
The whispering stops
'  - Claire walks in to find Norman surrounded by several At school he's a very different man; pressed shirt and tie, hair neatly brushed back
They're preforming some unseen procedure on a live sheep in a containment harness
She stops by the door to watch him
and then what
Courtney
An intense   answers
We administer the Halothane
Dosage
She glances at her notes
Three point five cc's
Excellent
Properties
Andrew from downtown
Andrew, tall razor thin, was waiting for this
An organic, neuromuscular blocking agent, which when administered in aerosol form temporarily renders the subject immobile
Nothing but net
He measures out the liquid from a blue plastic bottle into an apparatus connected to an inhalation mask on the sheep
Prudence here's an old friend
He moves to the sheep's head and strokes it as he nods to Courtney who turns a valve on the apparatus
The sheep suddenly goes completely still
Norman moves around and begins a brief procedure
try to stay on her good side because owe her my career and most of our grant money
Why else
He completes the procedure
They look at him blankly
Always do unto others as you'd have others do unto your ewe
Groans, laughter
He stops Claire
That'll do it
Write this up for Tuesday
Andrew and Amy tend to Prudence, the rest leave
Claire moves over to him
They kiss
Norman packs notes and some of the chemicals into a
(warm) What are you doing here
There were some noises
didn't want to disturb you
She watches as the sheep slowly becomes reanimated and is led out of the room
What do you mean
Some noises where
In the house
was scared
Did you call the police
No
Can you drive me home
'll bring you back in the morning
Of course
He takes her arm
- Norman pushes open the front door
Cooper pads over, wagging his tail
They walk together past the stereo into
- the living room
All is quiet
They move into
'  - It's undisturbed
Norman checks the window locks
It was there
This angry music all by itself
And  heard whispering
What kind of whispering
don't know
Just
whispering
He nods as Cooper appears
What'd you see, Coop
The dog stares blankly
(to Cooper) Tell him
Norman smiles
- Norman sits on the bed and pulls off his shoes
'm gonna have the police check on the house
Claire leans against the window sill
Oh great, "Can you look in on my wife, she's hearing voices
"  Wait'll that gets around
He walks over to her
've got the conference next week
want you to feel safe
do,  do
'm sure 'm just
how was your day
He goes to his dresser and fishes a little joint from a box in his dresser
Think  may have cracked it
Really
She produces a match and lights it
They sit on the bed
think so
Maybe
You are so brilliant
Yep
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer
(smiling) You know what that does to me
She takes a little puff on the joint as he kisses her neck
(stopping) Ohmigod
You'll never believe
saw Schumway
You're kidding
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us
Wow
He nods, Claire passes the joint back
And he says
you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer,  am a great admirer of your work
" Well, that's nice
"
especially Spencer's Theorem
" (overlapping) Oh, no
"
of Perpetual Distances
" (beat) Everybody's checking their shoelaces
Pins drop
"'m afraid you've mistaken me,"   say
(overlapping) That's
"
for my father
" 'm so sorry
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe
That's just mean
(indicating joint) Oh
Jody wanted to know if  could get her some
(quickly glancing over) Did you tell her
What
No
No
You didn't
(with a smile) Norman, you are so funny about that
No, didn't
He takes a little toke, then vanishes into the bathroom
(
) Cause that would be really-- She lays back on the bed
Sounds of flushing
didn't
He reappears without the joint
Sorry
You understand
Did you call about the Feurs
Oh, right
Yes
Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart
Wouldn't hurt a fly
Huh
Claire ponders this
Norman turns off the light and joins her on the bed
He kisses her knee
Do the brilliant Norman stuff some more
Then starts working his way up her thigh
And speak up
Claire smiles
- Claire sits frozen, cello between her legs, bow hovering in position
After an uncomfortable long pause, she touches bow to string, drawing in a breath at the power of the sound
Claire takes another deep breath, then launches into a beautiful and melancholy piece of music
She's very, very good
Eyes closed
Her body begins to sway slightly as her left hand vibratos like butterfly wings on the neck
She reaches a difficult transition and falters
She seems almost surprised
She attacks the transition again, and again falters
Claire bites her lower lip and tries yet again, this time failing completely
She sits back in the chair, despondent
Almost as an afterthought, she sadly drags the bow across strings
At the end of the tone, something catches her ear
She can just make out the       echoing the tone
She sits up and plays a different note, then another
Each time the soft mournful voice becomes more distinct
Finally she plays a sharp, higher pitched note
The voice echoes with a distinct, unsettling shriek
'  - Claire walks in and sees: -- Lying on the floor The caption announces that he's being promoted to the "distinguished
"  Through the spiderwebbed glass, Norman can be seen shaking hands with an older academic, hugging a smiling Claire to his side
Claire kneels down to gather the picture
single shard of glass is missing
She finds it a foot away by a distinctive knot in the wood floor
She notices a   in the point of glass, but when she moves it, it's gone
She places the pieces of broken glass on the frame and stands
Out of the window directly in front of her sees:  Mr
Feur, removing a    from his trunk
She glances down at the picture, then back up at Mr
Feur, who carries the shovel around back
Oh no
Claire wraps up the broken picture
She hears a car door slam and glances out the window in time to see Mr
Feur driving off
- stiff autumn breeze
Claire stands at the fence
Mrs
Feur
She looks through the tiny crack
Nothing
Hello
(beat) Are you there
Silence
' - Claire glances down as she walks past
She looks up at the house, which seems quite placid, then slowly heads around back
'   - She takes in the lake view from the large porch
The wind is really blowing
Her eye catches on something
Propped against the back door
Claire takes a pinch of soil from the shovel and tastes it, then knocks at the back door
There's no answer
She knocks again
Nothing
She's turning to go, then the door swings open
The smile fades from Claire's face
' The immense
filling the doorway
Yes
Um
'm running late here
just came back for my briefcase
Right
Well,  wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood
'm Claire Spencer
From next door
This really isn't a good time
He starts to close the door
Well maybe your wife
(growing cold) She isn't here
When
when will she be back
don't know
Oh-kay
have to go
Slam
And Claire is staring at a closed door
(
) What do you mean she's gone
- Claire and Jody knife slowly through the water in the Spencer's sailboat heading back toward the dock, the , the  in the background
She's not there
haven't seen her since that morning
Well,  mean, 've never actually seen her, but 'm telling you, she's disappeared
Jody finishes securing a line
The breeze is mild, so they just cruise with the wind
What are you saying
Claire just looks at her
You think he killed her
don't know
When you say it, it sounds crazy
But what else could it all be
Jody shakes her head
mean, he's so kind of grim and daunting, and she sounded terrified of something
Claire glances over at Jody
(laughing to herself) Listen to me
sound like some middle- aged Nancy Drew
Jody regards her
After a beat: Know what  think
What
Seance
Jody, no
Telling you
(overlapping) no
no
no
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija
Please
That's all  need
Jody shrugs, "Have it your way
"  Beat
Hey, look
'  across the lake
So pretty
' in the turreted window of Norman's study
Someone's there
What
In the window
Norman's at work
don't
Claire looks over at Jody
(pointing) There
In the study
Don't you see-- She looks again-- nothing
Wow
'm losing it
No, you're not
(beat) But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly
Claire stares back at the house
- Claire walks in and sets down some packages
She opens one and pulls out new toothpaste and
-- the kind your pictures come back in
She absently leafs through them, then freezes
She gapes at one of the shots
Oh boy
- Claire turns off the lights and crouches down
She raises a pair of
- Claire rakes the binoculars across the Feur's house
past their car parked in front until she finds The tall, powerfully built Mr
Feur walks into the room and sits by himself at the dining room table, which is set for one
He eats a  dinner, slowly chewing and staring straight ahead
He sips from a can of beer
Just then
'
She lets out a screech and turns to see Norman standing beside her
What are you doing
She glances back out the window and sees Mr
Feur standing at the window, paging the curtain
She squats down, pulling Norman with her
(shrill whisper) Get down
He'll see
(also whispers) What's going on, Claire
Shhhh
She peers over the sill in time to see Mr
Feur turning away from the window
She takes Norman by the hand and leads him downstairs
'  - She leads Norman in
(still whispering) Why am
(full voice) Why am  whispering in my own house
Claire turns
He killed her
What
He did
She's in the picture
went over to look and she's gone
The table was set for one
And that means he murdered his wife
This is getting ridic-- No, no, no, no
The soil on the shovel, his shovel
that's clay
It's not from here, believe me,
(frustrated, she grabs the photos) All right, look at this
She triumphantly thrusts one before him
Norman looks at it
Our house
No
Look
In the window
The
She points out a   in the of the study
Norman takes it over to the light
It's a flare
flare
From the sun
It's a reflection on the glass
It's her
'm telling you
She whispered and turned on the music
She's trying to contact me
(making sure he's got it) It's a ghost
Norman shakes his head
He looks again at the picture, does a quick calculation
You took this in the morning, didn't you
She nods slightly
When the sun would be exactly right
She's got him
Then why isn't it in any of the other pictures
She thrusts the batch at him
He peruses the other few shots of the garden
cloud passed
Or it's a bounce off the lake
See
She looks
He might not be wrong
Where is she then
She could be out
She could be sick in bed for all we know
Okay
Okay
'll bet there's
Look at this
She leads him out of the room
- Claire stares at the computer screen triumphantly
See
What am  looking at
(indicating completed solitaire game) didn't do that
Who did
Mrs
Feur
Maybe
Point is
not me
Right
And why is she here
If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him
She was lonely,  talked to her
Norman, know how it looks, but-- Claire, listen to me
know you're under some strain
But there's no such thing as ghosts
They don't exist
Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and
wait, why aren't you dressed
Dressed
Dinner
With Stan and his new girl
When
What do you mean
Claire, we talked about it
You didn't want Japanese,  said, Our first date since
(she seems confused) Oh
since Caitlin
You don't remember this
Tonight
Yes, tonight
We're going to be-- She looks at his watch
Fashionably five minutes late
She bolts up the stairs
'   - They drive across the bridge
(concerned, exasperated) When you do this,  swear
(overlapping) Don't get all
like it never even happened
Okay, okay, 'm sure that  just
He pulls out a cell phone and punches in a number
What are you doing
Restaurant
Let them know we're running late
Five minutes
The phone flashes
"
" You're not at the center
(overlapping) know 'm not at the center of the bridge
We're going to be fine
They near the far side of the bridge
Norman looks down at the cell phone, which now reads, "
"  He presses a button
There we go
Well, that's a relief
He shoots her a look
- cozy, candlelit Italian place in town
Claire and Norman arrive at the table
rises
The chair next to him is empty
He kisses her cheek
Hi Stan
Sorry we're late
(too earnest) It was my fault
She greets Stan, a friendly looking man in his forties
We just got here
Claire flashes a semi-playful look back at Norman
Where's the new squeeze
speaks out from behind her
Here  am
Claire turns to find  ,   standing behind her
The woman's face registers some shock
'd like you to meet
Elena
Ohmigod
The two women embrace, then beam at each other
Wow
This is
(to Norman) We know each other
Hope so
Post meal
Several empty wine bottle decorate the table
We had this Finnish conductor, Aki, Laki, something
He had these ridiculous bangs
And he'd sweep them off with his baton every minute or so, and it drove us insane, remember
Claire nods
He looked like one of the Monkees
Anyway, Claire slept with him
didn't sleep with him
just so she could cut them off
He was so pissed
came in from my room
(interjecting) We were suite mates
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish
Oh God
They dissolve into giggles
Norman and Stan smile
Well
(to Stan) made an honest woman out of her
Elena puts her hand on Claire's
(to Stan) You should have heard her play
Stop
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic
One cello position open
Do we have to
And  kicked ass
My best stuff
Then stood in the hallway and listened to her audition
and  cried
She's making this up
'm not
Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks
What happened
Elena looks at Claire, then smiles
She got it
(beat) Turned it down
met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night
Claire puts her arm around Norman
and three months later  was married
He squeezes her hand
- Claire walks into the work room with the portable phone to her ear and a cup of Jody's special tea
She sniffs it and makes a face as she turns on the computer
After several rings a  picks up on the other end
(on phone) Caitlin
' (overlapping) Can you hang up
'm trying to make a call
The line goes dead
Claire hits redial and gets
a She clicks the phone off as the computer boots up
Claire puts the phone down and starts a game of Alice's Solitaire
She turns a card and waits
Gee, that's tricky
Sure could use some help
She waits, the cursor blinks benignly
Come on
Nothing happens
'  - She walks into the room and notices  wafting from the cracked bathroom door
- Claire enters the steamy bathroom
The tub is nearly overflowing with water
She squats down to drain the tub
She stops, feeling watched, then slowly peers behind her
no one's there
Claire reaches toward the water to yank the plug's chain, then freezes
In the bathwater's still reflection she see: standing beside her
Startled, she pops up and slams into the
Claire collapses over the side of the tub, her head dipping underwater
small cloud of red surrounds her
Moments later, an arm wraps around her
: Blurry shapes
(
) Claire
- '  -   sharpens into focus hovering above her
Norman
- Claire sits on the bed
Norman dabs the blood from a tiny cut on the back of her head
don't need a shrink
(gently) Harvey says he's amazing
Norman
What can it hurt to talk to someone
She goes to her dresser and gets a   and starts to open it
Norman gently places a hand on her arm
Please
She shoots him a look
You promised
and puts the pills down
(gently) Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years
If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong
never said  wasn't upset
Of course 'm upset
miss her terribly
But know what  saw and what  heard
and it wasn't some "symptom" of something
never said
and  don't think 'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up
Beat
Are you lonely
No
And  don't need a psychiatrist
'  - Claire sits in a comfortable looking chair with her purse in her lap, arms crossed
(
) (a smooth, mellifluous baritone) Who's idea was it
Mine
His
We both
thought
She trails off
Camera slowly pulls back to reveal,
, a stocky, light skinned black man in his late forties with a kind face and piercing brown eyes
didn't want to come
Then why did you
Because he was worried about me
Your husband
Yes
(beat) 'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace
Do you really think so
No
There's a pause
Why is he worried
Because,  don't know, because sometimes
sometimes  forget things
and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been
fainted and
(beat) Why is this so hard
Dr
Drayton takes a little silver bowl full of shiny, red next to his chair
He proffers it to Claire
Fireball
You're joking
He shakes his head
She shrugs, then grabs one and pops it into her mouth
It's hard because 'm a complete stranger and what we're talking about is incredibly personal
Besides, the first time most people come here, a part of them is wondering if 'm gonna think they're crazy
She sucks on the fireball and slowly nods
Don't worry, 'm required to have at least three sessions in order to commit
Her eyes get a little wider
Now that's a joke
She manages an unsteady smile
have some training at helping people through the stressful moments in life, one of which you may or may not be experiencing
If you want to get some stuff off your chest, great
If not
He smiles and shrugs, "no problem
"  She stares at him for a moment
(re: fireball) These are good
Mm-hmm
She studies him for a moment
There's a ghost in my house
He nods slightly, as if she's told him, " have some anxiety
"  Claire goes on
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio
she likes rock and roll
Angry rock and roll
How do you know it's a she
saw her in the water
Beside me
She was filling the bathtub
What does she look like
Pretty
She's a blond
Do you have any idea who she is
Um
'd rather not say
just yet
Fine
What do you think  should do
He thinks for a moment, then: Try to contact her
Claire nearly swallows her fireball
What
Try to communicate with her somehow
You think that'll help
Can't hurt
And  think it's important you find out what she wants
Claire ponders this for a moment, then looks back up at him
Are you humoring me
Nope
She seems satisfied by his sincerity
How
don't know
My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle
He stands
Claire nods, then stands
She smiles too
Is this time okay
He nods
- Claire walks in carrying a half-empty bottle of wine
She looks over at Jody, who turns off the lights
Jody then strikes a match and lights a
She unveils her carved
Sit down here
(nervous, jokey) Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee
Jody turns to her, deadly serious
Isn't this where you saw her
Claire's smile fades
She nods
Then this is where she'll be
They sit cross legged, the board between them
Place your fingers on the planchette
The planchette
This
Jody indicates the wooden pointing device
Each woman grasps an edge
(in a low voice) We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs
Feur
(to Claire) What's her first name
don't know
Jody closes her eyes
Claire follows suit
call forth the entity that is haunting this house
They look down at the planchette, which hasn't moved
Mrs
Feur
There's still no movement
Nothing's happening
Shhh
Jody focuses intently
Reveal yourself to us
long moment passes
It's starting to seem like a bust
Suddenly,
Even Jody seems startled
(to the spirit) Who
who are you
At first, nothing happens
Then, slowly, the planchette starts to move across the board
Are you doing that
Jody shakes her head
'm not doing that
The planchette comes to rest on the letter "
"  Moments later, it starts to move again drifting over and stopping on "
" Oh
-
It starts to drift again, moving slowly toward the space between "" and "
"  The planchette stops on "
"  Jody removes her fingers from the device
Mef
What's Mef
It's initials
is Feur
It's her
Suddenly, the  starts flickering strangely and --, --
Shit
Jody stumbles backwards, gasping
Did you see that
Claire leans in
(to ghost) What happened to you
The
Oh God
Jody bolts
Claire follows
- Claire catches up to the completely spooked Jody outside the work room
She holds onto her arm
have to go
Jody, wait
Cooper's growling in the work room
They look in
Claire, this is
this is
Claire, transfixed, walks in
- She stares at the computer screen, which is being filled with letters at an amazing speed
She hears the front door swing open
Jody
- Claire arrives at the open front door in time to see the Karman-Ghia tearing out of the driveway
She turns and goes back into the house
She edges into
'  - The picture has, once again, tumbled from its spot
She drops to her knees over the picture
This time When she picks out the remaining shards, the newspaper photo slides out
Claire glances at the benign news stories on the back
She looks around and spots a piece of glass wedged in a crack in the floor boards by the knot
' The piece of glass, wedged next to what looks like in the crack
It's too big to be a penny
She tries to use the piece of glass to pry it free, but recoils
tiny drop of blood appears on her finger, which she pops into her mouth
- Still sucking on her finger, Claire walks in and begins to clean up the remains of the seance
She bends down to pick up the Ouija board, then stops when she notices that the tub is again full to the brink of overflowing
What do you want
Claire peers around, frustrated, half waiting for a reply
There is only silence
She reaches in to pull the plug, nearly scalding her hand
When she turns for a hand towel she finds a message traced into the steamed-up mirror: " " She draws in a breath and darts out of the bathroom
- Norman nods to a   as he leaves a darkened university building
He sees Claire standing at the foot of the steps
What are you doing out here
He killed her
'm not crazy
He killed her and-- This is the Feur thing
Yes
And he's going to get away with it
Norman's momentarily speechless
How do you know this
We had a seance
Who did
Jody and
And she was there, Norman, she was
It scared Jody so bad she had to leave
How did you-- Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her
He regards her for a moment
Are you angry at me
This stops Claire in her tracks
What
Maybe you resent how busy 've been
What are you
No
You know what 've got at stake with this paper
You know that
can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow
Sabotage
Ever since the accident 've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or
The accident
But then you've been so much better
Norman, this isn't about you
This is something that's happening to me
It's not to get even
and it's not some warped bid for attention
Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not
Sweetheart-- No
Not sweetheart, no
believe in what's happening
don't want to, but do
guess  was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you
She turns on a heel and walks toward her car
- Norman catches up to her as a   is filing out of the concert hall next door
You're overreacting
She turns on him
Don't tell me how to react
Norman glances around at the crowded sidewalk
Keep your voice down
will
Some of the bystanders stop to watch
(still loud) Maybe you're right
Maybe 'm losing my mind
(looking around) Claire, please
Claire leans in and lowers her voice without diminishing her intensity
But what if 'm not
What if she died in terror and betrayal and some part of her can't move on while that's unresolved
Can't you just
Something behind him catches her eye
She trails off
Wow
Claire walks past him toward the parking lot
Claire, please
There's a dangerous energy to her walk
People step out of the way
- Claire walks past several cars until she sees the one she's after
steps out from behind the open trunk of his old Buick
(walking up) You
He looks up at her
You think you're smart, don't you
You think you got away clean
Well,  know you killed her
You drowned her in the bathtub and got rid of her somewhere and 'm gonna find her, you murdering sonofabitch
Mr
Feur stares, dazed, through the tirade
Norman arrives at her side
Who
(scoffing) Give me that shit
Your wife
didn't kill my wife
(to Mr
Feur) 'm sorry
(over Norman) Then where is she
He stares at both Spencers for a moment
Then calls past them
Honey
Claire and Norman turn
backs out of the passenger seat
She turns
' Claire looks sucker punched
'  - Claire sits back in the chair
She looks drained
soft rain taps against the windows
And his face
it seemed so gentle, and knew
in that second  knew that 'd imagined the whole thing
Dr
Drayton takes this in
She seems genuinely frightened
What's happening to me
Well, that's what we're here for
He watches her calmly, some empathy on his face
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you
that gave you reason for concern
Yes, but
Your friend saw them
Isn't there something called group hysteria
You think you influenced her
Maybe
don't know
just know that when all this was happening,  felt, some part of me felt
alive
Like somebody needed me
And the more  reached out to, it, the fuller it became
You're saying you willed these events to happen
don't know, 'm very confused right now
Beat
Did you ever find out what it wanted
Claire remembers
She said, "You know
"  That  know
Do you
No
What do you think
(beat) Guess
Claire ponders this
felt
pain
That she'd been hurt by someone
(beat) This is great
'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my-- Have you been hurt
Me
No
Well, in the accident  was injured, but
You were in an accident
Last year
drove my car up a tree
Nothing serious, this
(she indicates her scar) a minor concussion
But the car looked bad
It could have been bad
think it scared the hell out of Norman
Beat
How's your marriage
Claire's eyes widen
Listen, don't hold back
Dr
Drayton smiles kindly
Well, he's been amazing throughout this whole thing
Patient and caring
(beat) mean, sure, he can be obsessed with his work, and
it's a very important time right now with all that
But, sometimes
mean with everybody, right
Sometimes it's like
She trails off
What
That he doesn't
see me, or, you know, that 'm
that's something's wrong
with me
That can't feel good
No, it doesn't
Okay, look,  see what you're doing here, and that's, 'm sorry, but that's not it
My marriage is fine
've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where  saw some things that weren't there
Let's deal with that
'm willing to deal with that
(beat) just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist
Claire finishes her tirade
Dr
Drayton lets her settle for a moment
Fair enough
But you should know that 'm far less concerned with whether things you saw "existed," than  am with why you saw them
She takes in the ramifications of that
- Claire's carrying some cuttings into the house
She hears a knock at the gate, walks over and opens it to discover
Mrs
Feur
The real one
wanted to apologize
You do
For scaring you like  did
When thought about what that must have seemed like that day
And then you weren't there
Right
'm sorry
There's an awkward pause
Would you like some iced tea
Very much
Claire leads her toward the house
- Claire pours Mrs
Feur a glass of iced tea from a pitcher
She's small and delicate looking with big, watery eyes
Your house is so beautiful
Thank you
And these roses
They're much prettier up close
She regards Mrs
Feur for a moment
She seems skittish and shy
there's something  have to ask you
Mrs
Feur waits
That day
at the fence
You seemed terrified
don't think  was imagining that
There's a pause
Mrs
Feur looks down into her lap
No
Of what
What were you so afraid of
You're going to think 'm crazy or something
tiny smile
Not this week
She looks away for a moment, then looks back at Claire
Love
What
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe
That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave
Um
sure
couldn't catch my breath
That's not a metaphor, that's
And  panicked never dreamed anyone would hear me back there
(beat) tried to leave him
Went to my mother's in Boston
He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home
Claire is mesmerized
You must think 'm pathetic
No
No,  don't
'm sorry that  frightened you like that
But  was so touched by your concern
've been lonely here
(beat) Perhaps we could be friends
Claire stares at this strange, passionate woman
would like that
Mrs
Feur smiles at her
- Claire pulls up in front of a large
(on a cell phone) 'm pulling up, Yuri
'll see you for dinner
(to Claire) Sure you won't stay
No, it's fine
'm fine
(tempting her) Really big bed
She smiles and shakes her head
Norman kisses her goodbye, then grabs his bag from the backseat
Do  have everything
Yep
Call ya later
He starts to walk into the hotel
(
) And you glad you married me
He turns
She's standing next to the car
What
Are you glad
'm glad
Norman walks over to her and cradles her chin with his hand
(softly) You know  am
Good
(She gazes at him, then softly) You sat in front
saw you there
Norman takes his cue
You were lost in the music
eyes closed
your chest heaving
felt you
looking through me
We walked all night
You told me that  was
He gently cups her chin in his hand
(overlapping) that you were everything 'd ever dreamed of
She smiles, kisses him warmly, then gets in the car
- Claire stands outside Caitlin's Columbia dorm, watching young lives in motion
- Claire walks past a number of doors
Music booms out of one, shards of a conversation out of another
Finally, she arrives at a door that says "Fur is murder
"  She smiles to herself and knocks
There's no answer
(
) She's out
Claire turns to find an attractive   standing at her elbow
They're playing at 's down on Bowery
Probably won't be back for awhile
You her mom
Yes
Who was playing
Bitch
Caitlin's band
(stunned) Caitlin's band
Yeah
They're really good
would have gone, but  have a paper
(beat) And 'm not just saying that because you're a mother
Claire nods slightly
Thank you
She walks down the hall
' - Claire moves past a huge,    into an entrance area in the dark throbbing punk club
She looks out over the     , swaying to a pulsing power-pop band
and   push past her as they move into the throng
She looks up and her face changes
' shaggy trio of musicians on the stage, pumping through a jangly, but surprisingly melodic song
Her eyes race across the faces of a   , an emaciated / and stop on the
Caitlin
She rocks back and forth to her own hypnotic bass line, ,
Claire is transfixed, her face a mix of pride and sadness
The song ends and Caitlin's eyes open
She smiles for a moment, then the smile fades as she spots Claire
Panicked, Claire ducks behind a pillar
' - The last groups of   file out of the club couple of them glance at Claire, who seems very out of place standing on the Bowery late at night
(
) Mom
She turns to see Caitlin standing before her, a bass guitar case on a strap over her shoulder
There's an awkward pause
That was very good
Mom, 'm sorry
wanted to tell you
But it never felt right
Why
Caitlin stares at the ground
didn't want to bring up memories didn't want to do anything that might make you regret your choices
Claire winces silently
Besides, Dad would have freaked
No, he wouldn't
think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing
That's not true
Yes it is
Can we please not do that
Please
Cause it is
Claire doesn't disagree
He loves you very much
He just-- know he does
Beat
Claire studies her surprisingly strong daughter
Are you mad at me
Listen to me
The one thing in life that definitely don't regret
is the choice
made to be your mother
They hug
For a moment, Claire's got her little girl back
Her eyes well up
miss you
So much
(laughing) It got so bad your father almost had to put me away
What do you mean
started seeing things
ghost
Beat
Claire stares at her daughter
Did you
No
But once  heard
What
Someone crying
girl
(beat) thought  was crazy
(quietly) Then we both are
Caitlin nods
'  - a large cocktail party
The house is crowded with , , and their , a frosty-haired, avuncular chap, greets them with his , a sharp looking woman in her late fifties
There they are
You remember my wife, Claire
(shaking hands) Of course
You must be so proud
am
(to Norman) Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity
She takes their coats
Dean Templeton leads them in
Must've been some paper
Your father would be very proud
This seems to strike a nerve
Uh-huh
Claire notices this and squeezes his hand
Templeton leads Norman into a large living room which is filled with colleagues
Several of them turn and begin clapping
Others follow suit
- Claire stands at a small bar
(to bartender) White wine please
She scans the party and spots the Feurs deep in some intimate conversation with each other
She's speaking about something astonishing
He's rapt
Claire locates Norman in a corner listening as some holds forth
He sees her and mouths, "'m sorry
" He points to his watch and flashes five fingers
She smiles and nods
(
) Guess 'm not much of a medium
She turns to see Jody
Jody
They hug
Are you okay
think so 'm sorry for leaving, but  mean, Jesus, Claire
It's alright
mess around with this stuff, but never thought anything would happen
Claire looks uncomfortable
Does Norman know
Jody, she's alive
What
Mrs
Feur
She's alive
met her
She's really sweet
Then what was it
Nothing
It wasn't anything
've been on edge lately
Maybe since the accident
And 'd prefer,  really would, to just-- Something was there
You saw it
Did
Yes
Now  talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford
Hartford
And he's the real thing
Specializes in cases like this, like yours
No
Jody, listen to me
You have to listen to me
This is not something that can do right now
Whatever it was, it's gone
need it to be gone now
But Claire-- Please
Jody recognizes her fragility
Okay
Okay
've got to find a bathroom
'll call you
Jody nods as Claire walks off
- Claire stands in the spacious powder room, checking her makeup in the mirror
Mrs
Templeton enters from the bathroom
How're you holding up
Just fine
It's a lovely party
The two women fix their makeup side-by-side in the mirror
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished
(nodding) Almost
Wonderful
It's good to see you two doing so well
Claire looks confused
'm sorry
know how hard it can be sometimes
Claire turns to her
Uh-huh
What can be
Well,  don't think 've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year
Claire's still in the dark
For the Dupont Chair
(off Claire's look) swear
'm becoming the nosy old lady used to run from at Amherst
No
'm just not sure what you mean
There was just
some tension
You were upset
remember being concerned
At the party
Toward the end
You remember
(recovering) Ohhh yes
No, no
Just a little, you know
We're fine
Well, 'm glad
Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know
Who's that
The wives
Beat
Right
Mrs
Templeton leaves
Claire looks into the mirror
(
) What was it about
'  - Claire and Norman walk toward the car
You don't remember
When she said it, there was something familiar
but no
He looks at her for a moment
You dropped a glass
cheap wine glass from the caterers
You started crying
tried to comfort you
(something's triggered) In the living room
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio
took you home
But why
can't understand how  could just completely-- It was maybe a week after the accident
We were moving
It was a hard time
But  don't remember
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago
What's wrong with me
He stops, takes her shoulders gently
(reassuring) Nothing
Nothing at all
It's been a hard year
But you're better now
And things are really looking up for us
So let's try to enjoy that
(gently) Please
She thinks for a beat
Yes
Yes
That's what  want
She takes his hand and kisses it
'  - Claire walks up to the door
When she touches the knob she hears
the
She opens the door and moves into: - The same intense whispered exchange
She glances into the mirror and sees
, ,
She turns the corner and again
'
'  - She walks in and stands before: The repaired photograph of herself and Norman
at the party for the
She takes it from the wall, stares at it for a moment, then She extricates the picture from the broken glass
The caption reads: "Dr
Norman Spencer being awarded the distinguished Dupont Chair in Genetics by Dean of Sciences Torvald Ackerman
" She stares at the picture for a moment, then flips it over and scans the stories on the back
One tells of a hotly contested city council race, another contains details of a large alumni donation to the university
She notices the bottom corner of another story she hadn't noticed before
It's only a small portion of one column, but it seems to detail the search for

She narrows her search to

She scrolls down the list until she finds

Claire double clicks on it, then waits breathlessly as a blurry cyber photo fills the screen
Slowly, higher resolution moves down the image

Under the photo is the legend: " -  22, 1998" Claire stares at the familiar face, then shakily hits
Claire is staring down at the girl's face on the print out
(on phone) she was practically a townie
Grew up in Bradford
And she was never found
(on phone) Nah
She was a live wire
Had this old Mustang Fastback
It's gone too
Most of her friends think she's tooling around Mexico somewhere
Police downgraded her to a runaway
Thank you, Mr
She glances at the byline on the back of the newspaper photo
"by Neil McCann" McCann
She hangs up
'  - Norman is unpacking  and  from his
Claire walks in
Remember this
She places the printout on his desk
He takes a long look at it
Is this that girl from last year
Claire nods
Did you know her
Norman looks again
may have seen her on campus
Not personally
No
(beat) 'm afraid to ask what this is about
(solemnly) It's her
This is the woman who 've seen
The
Yes
The ghost
Norman leaves the hung frame and walks over to a window
thought it was Mrs
Feur, but it's not
(quietly overlapping) Stop
'm positive this time
(overlapping) Please stop
It's Madison Fra-- Claire falls silent, Norman turns from the window
(calmly) Claire, 've tried to be there
know you're going through something that can't understand
but it's enough
Claire looks down
Do you want to go see someone
Together
Should we call Dr
Drayton
She shakes her head
Well then what
Claire, what
Tell me what  can do
Long pause
Claire looks up, then timidly holds out the printout
It's her
Norman's jaw tightens
don't want to make you angry
But she's here
And  don't know why
He silently walks out of the room
Claire stares down at the face in the photo
'  - Claire parks in front of a small, clapboard house in a neighborhood that is decidedly less upscale than her own
She gets out and tentatively walks up to the tiny porch
- Claire rings the bell
in her early fifties answers the door
Mrs
Frank
Yeah
'd like to talk to you about Madison
You know where she is
No,  don't
Please leave me alone
She starts to close the door
Claire leans forward
She's my friend
The woman stops
Was
We were
acquainted
've been away for awhile
When  came back
She studies Claire
What's your name
Claire
She never mentioned you
Claire doesn't know what to say to this
Then again, she didn't say much about her college friends
She gives Claire the once over
'm watchin' my shows
She motions Claire in
- Claire sits on a couch in the cramped living room
Mrs
Frank serves up a mug of coffee
soap plays silently on an old 19"
Just plain old coffee
None of that mocha nonsense
It's fine
She sizes Claire up
You look a little old for a student
'm not
We
we met at a party
Sounds about right
Never understood how a girl that wild got all 's
Sure didn't get it from me
They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young
Maddie wouldn't hear about it
She never mentioned her father
Well she wouldn't
He left when she was twelve
Never spoke about him after that
There's a silence
Mrs
Frank stares at the
Don't need the sound
You can pretty much tell what's happening by the faces
Turn it up sometimes, though
Feels like someone's here
Claire doesn't know what to say
Mrs
Frank turns to her
Why are you here
don't know
It's like that
Doesn't seem real
No note
Nothing
(beat) Cops say she'll be back
just wanna know what happened
Claire stares at this tough, tragic woman
Wanna see her room
Claire nods
'  - Claire enters the room
Her face freezes
, side by side with
Full scholarships
Princeton too
She wanted to stay close
You must have been very proud
She nods
Claire moves along looking at pictures
Some with different men, others with rough looking friends
Claire stops at a picture tucked into a mirror
Madison singing at a recital of some kind
She's lovely, with striking
Around her neck is a distinctive , with a perfectly wrought,
Such a pretty voice
Surprised she didn't major in music
(beat) That's the last picture
phone rings in the hallway
'cuse me
Claire's eye is pulled past the picture into the mirror, the reflection of something pinned to the edge of a bulletin board
She turns and moves over to: She reaches out to touch it
Claire hears footsteps
Mrs
Frank leans back into the room
They're calling me in to work
should be going anyway
- Mrs
Frank walks Claire out
'hear anything you'll let me know
Of course
Claire walks to her car
She turns and calls out: What was her major
Biology
She wanted to be a doctor
Claire stands, frozen, as Mrs
Frank disappears into the little house
- Claire shuts the blinds, then places the large candle on the floor, then places the    at the base of the candle
On top if it, she places
Then Claire lights the candle, puts the braid on the picture, and hunches over it, whispering intensely: need to know the truth
She waits a beat
Nothing
Madison, please
help me
Nothing happens
She looks around at the seance props
She stands and places her hands on the sink
She glances at herself in the mirror
What am  doing
Suddenly, her head droops over, she shudders softly
When she looks back into the mirror, her eyes are a
She hears the front door open downstairs
(
) Hello
Anybody home
strange smile creeps across her face
'  - - Gliding down the stairs and into
- The refrigerator door is open
Norman is leaning over
Only his ass protrudes
Norman closes the refrigerator door and sees Claire standing before him, stripped down to a skirt and slip top
There's a different physicality to her movements
a different rhythm to her speech
Hello, Dr
Spencer
Norman smiles
Mrs
Spencer
She shakes her head
Forbidden fruit
She takes the apple
Got a problem with that
then takes a ravenous bite and walks out of the room
'  - Norman finds Claire seated on his desk, her legs spread
take it your not mad at me
Wouldn't go that far
She grabs his belt and pulls him into her, then holds the apple to his mouth
Norman tentatively takes a bite
She mashes it slowly into his mouth until he recoils slightly
(mouth full) Okay
When he chews the huge bite, a glistening drop of juice runs down his chin
Claire leans forward and licks it off
What's gotten into you
She just smiles mischievously, then starts kissing him
It looks like she's eating his lips
Norman's getting hot
She bites down on a lip
Ow
What's the matter
It's too rough
Since when
Something about this response frightens him
Claire yanks Norman's belt open
He steps back, tripping over his castered desk chair
She's on top of him in a flash, sitting astride him
She speaks in a forceful, sexy whisper
don't like this, this
(pinning his hands above his head) Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor
She grinds up against him
Suddenly, something pulls her eye to the hallway
- The   , now from inside the study
In it's reflection:   , shorter hair, stunned expression
Where she's standing
it's
Claire leans over him until they're nose-to-nose
(tense whisper) think she's starting to suspect something
(through clenched teeth) Who
(leaning down) Your wife
Norman shoves her off of him onto the floor
He stands, breathless
What the hell are you doing
In a moment, it's Claire again, stunned and trembling against the wall
(to herself, remembering) "You know
" (rattled) What
She looks up
was there
Claire-- (flooding back to her) came to work in the garden and  saw you with her
in my house
Oh God
snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened
And when  woke up in the hospital
somehow it hadn't
Until now
He just stares at her, his face anguished
It was last year
We were having troubles
So you fucked a student
(reaching for her) That's not what 'm sayi-- (pulling back) ' touch me
Just get away from me
Go
He's frozen
Norman doesn't move
He's never seen her like this
Fine
She bolts toward the living room
He follows her
- She grabs her coat
(welling up) Claire, please don't
What did you think  would do
Jesus Christ
gave up my life and my music
never asked you to quit
Oh
You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family
He follows her as she searches for her purse and keys
'
You wanted to quit
And then when you did, you hated me for it
so you gave it all to her
Who
To Caitlin
She wheels on him with fury
Leave her out of this
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive
Stop
would do anything just to be around me
And  slipped
God help me, slipped
'm not going to listen to this
Claire goes to leave, Norman blocks her path
tried to break it off
You should have tried harder
Claire
(seething) Get out of my way
She brushes past him
- He catches up, beside himself
'
Claire's nearly disarmed by this rare emotional outburst
She turns at the door and looks back
You made it impossible for me to be someone you could be in love with
She leaves
- Norman, rumpled and unshaven, is passed out on the couch, a half empty whiskey bottle beside him on the coffee table
He awakens to find Claire sitting across from him
want you to answer one question
He waits
Did you have anything to do with her disappearance
Beat
Yes
Claire goes pale
She was damaged and unstable
The more tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became
Finally, she showed up at the new house
How did she know where it was
He stares off
The reality sinks in for Claire
(softly) Our dream house
Norman can hardly look at her
She was out of control
She said she was going to kill herself
or you
never thought she'd go through with any of it, but then she was gone
He trails off
She did it
We don't know that for sure
Of course she did, Norman
What else could it be
The enormity of this hits Norman
His head drops into his hands
Oh God, what have  done
How could have let this into our lives
He looks up at her, teary
don't know
She gets up and walks out of the room
'  - An old industrial loft filled with finished and half-finished oil paintings
Jody brings Claire some tea
and everything  have, everything thought my life was
Christ when  think of all the lies
Jody looks down
What
(beat) Jody what
Jody looks up, tears in her eyes
Oh God
you knew
was down in Adamant
Adamant
Artsy little village down seven
There's a guy there who sells my work
had just dropped off some paintings and as  got in my car
saw Norman sitting at this little cafe
Claire waits for her to continue
started to walk over
but he wasn't alone
blond
only caught a glimpse
She was young
(beat) should have said something right away
But  didn't
Why
Partly because  didn't want to hurt you
but partly
partly because  was relieved
Relieved
had just been left by Richard
was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed
Claire nods
By the time  finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late
Too late
Jody, it was an accident
Alone
On a two lane road
With a ton of Valium in your system
Claire walks over to a window
got there first
Stan covered up the pills and  had it out with Norman
He seemed desperate not to lose you
He promised to handle it
And we all let it drop away
All of us
Beat
'm a terrible friend
No
Claire turns
How could  expect you to tell me something that  wouldn't even tell myself
What are you going to do
don't know
If she was dangerous before-- She could have hurt me if she wanted to
You don't know that
(beat) If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out
Somehow you have to break the connection
No
She wanted me to know the truth
Now that  do
think she's at peace
Jody isn't as sure
- Claire walks in
She notices the clock on the range is dark
She flips on a light
Nothing happens
Worried, she heads upstairs
'  - Claire enters
The bed is empty
The shower is running in the bathroom
Norman
- -
her face a mask of terror
Oh God
' The , with the shower curtain drawn around it, the water blasting
Norman's limp hand pokes through the curtain
leads from the mirror socket into the tub
Claire races over and rips the plug from the wall
She tears the    to find    lying, unconscious in the tub
No, no
Please no
She hugs her face to his chest until she picks up a heartbeat
Norman
Wake up
Please
Claire shakes him to no effect
Oh God
She slaps him on the face
once, then twice
He suddenly sucks in a gulp of air, begins struggling and dazedly returns to life
It's me
it's me
Sobbing, she shuts off the squeaky faucets and struggles to pull him upright
She discovered   in the tub and hurls it across the room
- Claire sits beside Norman on the bed as two
's, an and a   pack up
Stan's on the phone, Jody off to one side
Vitals are good
'd take it easy for a couple of days
Thanks
The
's leave as Stan hangs up
They'll take you for a  scan tomorrow if you're feeling dizzy at all
That won't be necessary
He glances at Claire as he walks Stan out
Not unless there's a miracle drug for clumsiness
They leave
Jody, she tried to kill him
know
can't believe this is happening
We need help
Please let me call the medium
That could take days
need to do something now
Don't you see
She wants us dead
Jody thinks for a moment
Alight, alright
Stay calm
You opened this door
There's got to be a way that you can close it
Like what
have an idea
But,  mean, 'm just making this up
What is it
: ' - Claire's staring down at the
She's kneeling at the edge of the dock
From her pocket she produces and a piece of
She wraps the braid up in the printout with a rock and secures it with the twine
Sorry
Better or worse, he's mine
She tosses the little parcel into the dark water
Bubbles stream up
In the bubbles, Claire sees
, which slowly becomes   , staring up from beneath the dark water
Claire wants to pull away, but she's transfixed
Madison reaches up toward the surface
As the bubble diminish, she seems to be
When she's gone, Claire reaches out toward the water
When her finger touches the surface
She's sucked down into the water
- Norman glances out of the window in time to see a splash off the dock
He races out of the room
- Claire struggles furiously as the unseen attacker drags her deeper into the murky depths
- Norman sprints toward the dock
- As he oxygen begins to run out, Claire screams desperately as her hand plunges into the muddy bottom
Suddenly, she's released
She yanks her hand free, the silt swirls revealing
a    in the mud
'  grasps Claire's ankle and pulls her upwards
- Norman helps Claire, coughing, onto the dock
They hold each other
Are you okay
She nods, catching her breath
We have to get out of here
It's alright
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us
She's gone
What
She can't be here without me
How can you be sure
don't know, but  am
She was there and then she was gone
felt it
Claire
She stares into the still water
It's over
- Claire in bed with a blanket wrapped around her
Norman walks in with some steaming mulled cider
He stokes the blazing fire
He sits on the edge of the bed
know it's going to take awhile before things are back
until they're better than before
But you've given us a chance to make a fresh start
And 'm going to spend the rest of my life making you glad that you did
The gaze at each other
Tentatively, she places a hand on his
- Claire, dressed in a warm sweater, finishes wrapping her rosebushes for the winter
She picks up a basket of clipped flowers and heads inside
- She turns the doorknob and listens for the whispering
All is quiet
- She looks into the mirror and sees only the study and the lake behind it
'  - Claire places the roses in a vase on Norman's desk, and in doing so, accidentally knocks it over
With a towel she mops up the water which has dripped onto the wooden floor
The stream has flowed over to the knot and dripped into the crack
Claire stares down at She grabs a letter opener from Norman's desk and pries the coin out
It's actually a   , the head of which is
She stares at it for a moment, then places it in her pocket
- Claire stands toward the bow watching the sunset
The leaves on the surrounding hills are stunning
Norman appears beside her
Last sail of the year
She gazes out
The leaves
Incredible
We should take a drive before they're gone
Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast
Look for antiques
Yep
There's some great places nearby
(a reflex) Adamant
What
Little village down seven
Supposed to be charming
Huh
Do you know it
Don't think so
Maybe we can stop there for lunch
He wraps an arm around her
Whatever you'd like
She leans against him, staring out
- Jody and Claire return from a walk
Norman has the boat on the trailer and is securing a tarp over it
They stop under a tree
But he acted like he'd never heard of it
Did he say that
Jody he was lying
What if he was
Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start
guess not
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire
You should too
Norman smiles and waves
They wave back as they arrive at the Karman-Ghia
You've got a beautiful life
And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you
(beat) 've come to think that's all that really matters
don't know
Trust me, Claire
You hear something
change the subject
You find something
get rid of it, throw it in the lake
(beat) You know what happened
The rest is only details
And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those
If you want to put this back together
just let it go
Jody drives off
Claire walks over to Norman
She hugs him tightly
What's that for
Nothing
'm cooking you dinner
You don't have to do that
know
Fine
'll do the shopping
They kiss
She heads to the Volvo
- Claire is approaching a country market
She spots a little sign with an arrow: - 11 mi
She hesitates for a moment, then take the turn
- Claire stands on a street in the quaint little village
She looks around, spots a little cafe with outdoor tables friendly old   walks out of a store
She watches Claire gazing around
What are you looking for
don't really know
Know what you mean
She ambles off across the street
Claire watches her go
Then notices a sign hung out above a little shop She walks toward it
- Claire stands in front of the store window
sign in the window identifies it as "The Sleeping Dog - Hand wrought jewelry and gifts
"  Claire tries to open the door, but sees a closed sign
She steps back out to the window and looks in
On display are a selection of handcrafted jewelry and curios
Suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an intricate
Her eye travels up and behind it to the back of the display where she spots, a small
Protruding from its lock
Claire looks like she's been punched
'  - Claire glances over at the soundly sleeping Norman
She gingerly slides out of bed
- Claire sits among the boxes, leafing through the photo album, tracking the years of their life
Her hands tremble
Finally she reaches the picture of their wedding, reaches behind the photo and produces
- Claire in her nightgown and a jacket, walks slowly down the dock
An expensive looking flashlight illuminates her path
She stops and stares out at the moonlit lake
She holds out a fist
Her fingers unfold and in her palm lies
She holds the key out over the water and stands there, frozen
The lighthouse beam sweeps past her once
then again
Claire pulls her hand back and holds the key to her chest, then carefully places it on the dock
She very deliberately takes off her jacket and slippers, steps to the edge of the dock, shines the flashlight on the dark water
then steps off the dock
: - from downstairs
Norman bolts upright in bed
'  - Norman walks through the darkened house into the moonlit room
He pulls up short when he sees the strongbox sitting closed on his desk
He looks around, sees the room is empty and walks over to it
The mud and silt has been wiped from the top, on which is engraved:  To
with love always,
He pulls open the lid and tentatively peers inside
Claire stands in the doorway, holding out the Looking for this
Norman stares at her dumbly
She's out there isn't she
She's in the lake
Okay
Don't
you don't understand what this is
Don't , Norman Of a woman you killed
(nearly hysterical) did
did not kill anyone
Jesus
Claire, listen to me
walked in and she was lying there dead
swear to you
On my life
She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me
To destroy us
If  hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have-- don't believe you
'
That's
you have to believe me
Oh God, 'm telling you the truth
(beat, fighting tears) did what  had to, Claire
She was gone
There was nothing  could do for her
did
put her in the lake rolled the car in
and  watched it sink
(beat) And 've lived with that image ever since
(beat) couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away
Don't you see, Claire
She's doing this
This is exactly what she wants you to think
Claire's lip is quivering with confusion
don't know what's true anymore
(beat) But that girl must be brought up
Now do you want to call the police
Or should
Norman stares at the phone
He's a wreck
Fine
can't live with it anymore
He takes the phone, punches in three numbers, waits
This is Dr
Norman Spencer
No, it's not an emergency
He looks at Claire
have some information about a missing girl, Madison Frank
Yes
Could you send an officer
Fifteen Willoughby, about a mile before the bridge
Thank you
He hangs up
Long silence
They look at each other
You did the right thing
(beat) 'm going to get cleaned up
He walks out
Claire walks over and stands before the box
- Claire walks into the bedroom
The shower can be heard through the bathroom door, which is partially ajar
Steam drifts out through the crack
She stands in her dressing room and catches sight of her weary, distraught countenance in the mirror
She glances down
' The necklace still in her hand
She looks up again into the mirror
Her face goes strangely blank and, almost mechanically, she clasps the necklace onto her neck
Suddenly, she stares over at the   lying on the bed for a long moment
She walks over, picks up the phone and looks at it
' The redial button
She stares at the bathroom door, then hits the button
Two rings, then: (on phone) Directory assistance
Claire's eyes widen in terror
She clicks off the phone, and, taking it with her, starts moving toward the door to the hall
She keeps a steady eye trained on the bathroom
She quietly pulls open the hallway door
Suddenly,
Claire shoves Norman's hand away and runs past him down the hall
- She's nearly at the top of the stairs when her body starts to falter
She tumbles over, dropping the phone, which clatters down the stairs before her
Claire is pulling herself down the stairs, moaning in terror
Norman can be seen calmly following her, waiting for the Halothane to take its full effect
Finally, she freezes
Norman picks up the phone and stands over her
God, how did we come to this
He picks her gently up in his arms and starts carrying her slowly up the stairs
The ghost stuff, that was impressive
' Ceiling, shapes
figure you saw her that day in the house and just gradually intuited the whole damn thing
That would be pretty astonishing
passive-aggressive masterpiece
- And into the bathroom
Wasn't until the shower that  realized you actually believed it
Nearly froze to death waiting for you
Thought the circuit breaker would kick back over and 'd be toast
then she's lowered into the tub
The crazy thing is
have never for one moment stopped loving you
He actually wipes a tear from his eye
He kisses her lips
We can feel her revulsion
His face over her
Don't worry about Caitlin
'm sure in some tragic way this'll bring us closer together
He turns on the faucets, then moves out of her line of vision
Sound of a number being dialed
(
) Hey, it's Norman
Listen, we had a huge blowout, so 'm going down to sleep at the lab
guess you're out, but
maybe
if you wouldn't mind stopping by to check on her in the morning
She glances down and sees on the edge of the tub
a prescription bottle of  with her name on the label
Her eyes go wide
(
) It's just
Jody, it's bad
've never seen her like this
(he trails off, choking up) don't really know what to do anymore
Norman, lit periodically by the sweep of the light house beacon, squats with the phone and gazes down at her
If anything ever happened to her, 'd
(beat) Anyway, thanks
Claire, mute, glances frantically around
One of her fingers begins to flutter
(tearfully) 'm so sorry
The tub is rapidly filling
He checks his watch, then reaches for the Valium
As much from will as the drug beginning to fade, Claire lets out a garbled cry
(sloppy, guttural) Mmmuh
Shhhh
(slurry) Mauduh
Norman stops
What
Norman seems unnerved that she's still clinging to her belief in the ghost
That's a little much, don't you think
He sees the necklace on her neck
Oops
Can't have that
He puts down the bottle of Valium, then reaches around Claire's neck to remove the necklace
When his hands close on the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack
' His arms around '
Norman explodes backwards, slamming his head into the He staggers out of the bathroom before collapsing with a thud
The water finally rises above Claire's nostrils
Claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and yank it free
The water slowly descends
When it seems that her lungs must burst, her mouth finally clears the descending water
She chokes in great gulps of air
The drug is finally wearing off
Claire sits up
Norman's unconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway
She turns off the water and stands unsteadily
She looks around for the phone and finally spots the little antenna protruding from under Norman
She delicately pulls the phone out of his back pocket, only to discover that it's been broken by his fall
She drops it and walks quietly out of the room
- Claire stumbles as fast as she can down the stairs
- She fumbles for some  in a basket by the door, then looks at the cell phone's recharging cradle
It's empty
She spots Norman's coat hanging on the coat rack and rifles through the pockets
She finds the phone, and flips it open to see if it's working
drop of something splats on the phone
Then another
It's blood
She looks up and sees Norman, his forehead gashed, glaring down from the landing
She reaches for the door knob, but the keys and cell phone in her hand make it difficult to open
Norman hurls himself over the banister
yanks her backwards
Claire slams into the corner by the armoir
Norman advances on her
At the last moment, she throws her shoulder into the armoir which tumbles over on Norman
- Claire races over to the Volvo, which is blocked by ' , the dark hulk of   on a trailer behind it
She starts to get into the pickup, then remembers to look in the bed
nobody there
- The truck is cold and doesn't want to turn over
She stares at the door for signs of Norman
Come on
come on
and , the truck roars to life
Claire spews gravel as she barrels the cumbersome rig out of the driveway, constantly watching the door
When she veers to the right out of the driveway, she looks into the rear view mirror
The boat momentarily blocks the open door, then clears
Still nothing
- Claire wheels the truck and trailer out onto a two-lane road
- Shivering with cold and adrenalin, she tries to work the ancient heater
She turns onto
- The  and  race across the deserted bridge
- Claire through the windshield
Her face striped by the reflection of the bridge lights which whip one-by-one across the windshield
She flips open the cell phone and punches in 911
It blinks:  "
" Shit
She glances into the rear view mirror
' stern section of the boat's   untied, flapping in the breeze
Claire desperately punches the "talk" button again
" "  She's past the center of the bridge
She looks again:  "
"  Claire punches the talk button again
punches through the window
Norman's arm follows, coiling like a python around Claire's neck, his grim visage pressed against the glass
She squashes down the accelerator
- The trailer starts to weave from side to side, swerving the pickup
Claire chokes, then blacks out
- The Pickup and trailer smash through the railing, barreling over bumpy terrain straight toward the
The truck hits the water at fifty and Norman is hurtled through the rear window and into the passenger side dashboard
- Claire is unconscious in the driver's seat, a trickle of blood runs from her nose
Norman stirs briefly as Claire groggily comes to
She hears the hissing of the smashed radiator, then sees Norman, a shattered bloody mess on the floor of the cab
She leans over to see if he's dead, hears a squeak and realizes that the pickup, with the miraculously still attached, is rolling deeper into the water
Before she can get the door open, the truck is half submerged
She frantically manages to lower her window halfway and starts to pull herself out
Her ribs have just cleared the glass when a bloody fist locks onto her ankle and yanks her inside
Norman pulls her down until they're face to face
Norman
She yanks the emergency brake, but it's too late
the submerged wheels lock and slide slowly down the mossy ramp
The truck is nearly submerged
(desperately) Norman, please
The water is up to the windows
Norman shakes his head slowly as he blinks away blood from his eyes
Think of Caitlin
Water sprays in through the hole in the rear window and momentarily blinds Norman
Claire jerks free and scrambles out of the driver's side window as the truck sinks
Just as she's free of the window, she jerks to a stop
She looks down and sees Norman, half out of the window, one hand clamped onto her ankle
There is a wrenching metallic creak
The truck lurches downward
then silence
'
The boat buoys it like a fishing cork as it drifts out into the lake
The headlights pierce the darkness of the steep underwater drop off
Claire tries to swim free, but Norman's not letting go
Suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer
It hurtles downwards and the still-glowing headlights reveal
' When the front of the pickup lands on the hood of the car, the Mustang's windshield shatters Norman is suddenly entangled by something
He tries to brush it free but comes face-to-face with ' , The last of his air bellows out of him in a scream as he releases Claire's ankle
His dead staring face separates from Madison's as the truck slowly tilts back and sinks to the bottom
- Claire breaks the surface with a huge intake of air
: - The sound of a furious cello solo
Norman, half out of the truck, arms floating
Follow his eyes to   , drifting above, tethered to the Mustang by an old seat belt around her ankle
Move through the murky water toward the corpse's clothed back
As she twists into view
:  '
at peace
Camera drifts, moves upward and breaks the surface as the distant lights of   approach
: filled with moist earth
hand tosses the clump of dirt onto
- Widen to reveal Claire, dressed in black, stepping away from the grave
tiny arm snakes around her waist
She glances down to see Caitlin, her eyes shining, clasping her mother tightly
Claire takes a last look into the grave
Rest in peace
- Mother and daughter turn and step back
Next to them, also in black, is
: Racing across the neck of a cello
The solo continues and now reaches the difficult transition that had stumped Claire before
- Claire, her hair short and sexy, eyes tightly shut, brow beaded with sweat
The piece builds to a dark, passionate crescendo
Her eyes remain shut for a moment, then flutter open
' New York apartment, the glimmering skyline visible through a large window
Cooper gazes up attentively
Claire sips a glass of wine, her face unsmiling, but serene
