He sports a fro, a "Clippers" jersey, and a serious swagger

Hey, look,
Quincy follows Kelvin's eyes, to a beat-up pair of Converse All-Stars approaching from next door
Walking in the kicks is a   in a -shirt and Tuff-skins, and a  cap pulled low
moving van is parked in the driveway
(cont'd) Thought only girls were moving in
That's what my Moms said
hope he can ball
Bet he's a scrub
The Kid stops at the edge of Quincy's driveway
Hey
Hey
Can  play
You nice
Yeah, 'm nice
Quincy looks the Kid up and down, then -- You and Kelvin gainst me and Jamal
Quincy tosses the Kid the ball
The Kid pulls off the baseball cap
Brown hair tumbles down, framing a soft brown face and bright eyes
She is  , eleven years old
Ah man, he is a girl
Girls can't play no ball
Ball better than you
Quincy laughs derisively as Monica walks to the top of the driveway
(whispering) What a dog
Monica shoots him a glare
She heard you
Nuh uh, they could only hear dog whistles
Monica starts to dribble
Jamal whistles as he walks backwards, guarding her
She throws up a shot
' Quincy and Jamal crack up
Kelvin rolls his eyes
Quincy grabs the rebound and shoots
Swish
(cont'd) One, zip
He rolls the ball to Monica
She starts dribbling and again, Jamal just backs up with her
She passes to Kelvin
Jamal and Quincy collapse on him, leaving Monica open under the basket
Trapped Kelvin has no choice but to pass it back
Monica catches the ball and throws up a shot
It banks off the backboard
The boys look at her in shock
Monica tosses the ball back to Quincy
One, up
Lucky
Quincy easily dribbles by Kelvin and lays up the ball
He throws the ball back to Monica
(cont'd) Two, one
Monica dribbles
Jamal plays her a little tighter
Monica bounces the ball through his open legs and lays up the ball
Two, up
Quincy can't believe it
Kelvin cracks up
Aaah, she dogged you
Shut up
The game continues, with Quincy and Monica trading baskets for their teams
Quincy grows agitated with Jamal, who is unable to stop her
The score hits nine, nine
Quincy stands at the top of the driveway, ball in hand
Point
Quincy dribbles through his legs, then pops an outside shot
The ball bounces on the rim
and rolls off
Quincy curses as Monica grabs the rebound and clears the ball
Jamal moves to guard her, but Quincy shoves him off
(cont'd) got her
Quincy defends
Monica smiles back at him
Told you  was nice
'm going to be the first girl in the
'ma be in the
You're gonna be my cheerleader
Monica suddenly passes to Kelvin, sprints for the basket
Quincy stumbles, giving her a step
Kelvin throws it back
Quincy knows he's beat as Monica goes for the winning lay-up
In desperation, he swings at her for the hard foul, shoving her off balance
, - The boys stand frozen
Quincy stares down at her, his eyes wide with fear
and regret
-  - Monica leans over the sink as her mother, , 36, wipes the blood from her face with a washcloth
'  (
) Eeew
Her sister, , 14, leans in the doorway, making a face
She is a mirror of their mother, with relaxed hair and painted nails
Her father, , 39, moves behind Lena, holding a box
How are you feeling, munchkin
Monica nods
He smiles
(cont'd) Yeah, you're through
She needs to stop running around like a little boy
She's alright
How is she alright looking the way she does
Camille, she'll be fine
He gives Monica a wink, crosses away
Monica pulls the washcloth away from her Mom and starts wiping the blood herself
'll get some ice
She exits
Lena shakes her head, follows
Monica pulls the washcloth from her face and stares into the mirror
Seeing her latest battle scar, there's only one thing left for this little girl to do
She smiles
-  - Quincy sits at the kitchen table, writing "  " in block letters across a homemade card
His face is tight with concentration as he tries to write in a straight line
At the counter, his mom, , moves a cake from its store box to a cake dish
She is 30, beautiful, with effort
She smooths the frosting with a spoon
, 32, with the height and ego of an  ballplayer, enters
He laughs
Girl, who you trying to fool
Quincy looks up, smiles
He quickly grabs a piece of crumpled paper, and tosses it to Zeke
Alley-oop, Dad
Nona intercepts his pass
Boy
She points him back to his card
Quincy scowls, starts writing again
Nona scoops some frosting on her finger, holds it up
(cont'd) New neighbors
Zeke wraps his lips around her finger, sucks the frosting off
See, Quincy, this is how your Moms caught me, with the old fake and bake
Had me thinking  was getting a sister who could burn
Nona laughs, pulls him down for a kiss
Quincy suddenly throws down his pencil in frustration
can't do this shit
Zeke and Nona pull away, stare at Quincy in shock
Boy, what'd  tell you about using that word
(sighs, then) "Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary
Why not
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man
That's right
Zeke
What
(then) Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit
" Nona just shakes her head
We should head over
Just you and Quincy, baby
got a meeting
With who
Business folks
You just got back from a four game road trip
Nona, don't start bitching
got maybe two years left to play
'm just trying to put some things together for us
Zeke grabs his keys
(cont'd) Later, Quincy
Later, Dad
Zeke exits
Nona leans against the counter, concerned
(cont'd) Mom
What
We still have to go
(beat) Yeah
-   - Camille and Nona stand among the piles of boxes
Monica and Quincy stand at their mothers' sides, stealing glances at each other
large bandage covers Monica's cheek
Monica holds her card, Camille holds the cake
we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded
Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door
(nods) Okay
Camille tries to smooth down Monica's unruly hair
Monica moves her head
Well, thanks again
This was really nice of you
It was the least we could do
And  love to cook
Quincy looks up at his Mom, surprised
She quickly hugs his face into her stomach
Camille lights up
Oh, me too
used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta
You're a caterer
Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something  want to do
(then) Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about
Quincy snickers
Nona quickly changes the subject
You know, girl, long as 've lived next door, 've never seen the inside of this house
Really
Well, come on, then
Camille hands Monica the cake
(cont'd) Honey, put this in the kitchen
Help her, Quincy
Camille and Nona head down the hall, leaving Monica and Quincy alone
The two just stand there
Quincy reaches out, scoops a finger of frosting, and pops it in his mouth
Beat, then Monica takes a bigger scoop
So
does it hurt
It's this big hole
You could almost see bone
For real
Uh huh
Quincy is impressed
So how come you could play basketball
just can
never knew a girl that could play
My Mom says she doesn't know where  come from 'cause  act different
Your Dad play
He works at a bank
My Dad plays for the "Clippers
"  He says 'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but 'ma play for them, too
Same number and everything
'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic
He's alright, but my Dad can take him
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High
don't know
lot
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth
You do act different
don't care
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause  run this street
'd just tell my sister, Lena
She don't know how to box,  bet
My dad showed me how to fight like Ali
He shows off a flurry of punches
So,  know karate from "Almighty Isis
" Monica puts the cake down on a box, does a couple of kicks and hand movements
Quincy is impressed
Bet you can't do this though
Quincy does a jump kick
Monica does the same
(cont'd) Okay, how bout this
Quincy takes a couple steps back, then does a cartwheel
It looks great, until he crashes into the box with the cake
The cake falls onto his head and shoulder
Monica doubles over, laughing
Quincy is embarrassed
Camille and Nona rush back into the living room
Monica, what did you do
Nothing
(to Nona) Oh, all that work
It's
it's okay
Can  get a towel
Camille quickly crosses into the kitchen
Quincy stares at the floor
Sorry
Nona bends down, whispers in his ear
No
Good boy
- '  - Monica sits between Lena's legs, grimacing, as Lena works a comb through her freshly washed, kinky hair
Monica's head flops like a rag doll
Her eyes are wet
Ow
Lena keeps tugging
(cont'd) Ow, Lena
Monica punches her in the leg
Ow
Lena yanks Monica's head back as Camille enters, carrying a yellow dress on a hanger
Monica sees it and her face falls
Ah, Mom
'm lucky  found it
Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage
Monica sulks
Lena cackles in her ear
Camille has to laugh
(cont'd) Child, pick up your lip
hate it
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear
Pants
Camille rubs her temples, then hangs the dress on the door
(to Lena) When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth
Are you okay
just need to lay down
've been running around all day
Just then, Nathan enters
He holds up two dress shirts as if it were a matter of life and death
Which one for tomorrow
The blue
You sure
Camille nods
Nathan looks at both of them, then: (cont'd) Can you iron both tonight just in case
(beat) Okay
Thanks, sweetheart
He kisses her on the cheek, hands her the two shirts and crosses out
Monica just watches
Beat, then Camile turns back to her daughters
The boy next door is riding with you to school so you'll know somebody your first day
(to Lena) Hurry so she can go to sleep
Monica reacts, surprised
Camille leaves
Lena puts the comb back to Monica's hair
Beat, then: Make it look nice, kay
- '  - Basketball posters, "Clippers" and  memorabilia, a basketball globe light
Quincy lays tucked in bed, eyes wide open, listening to his parents
The sounds bring a smile to his face
Quincy climbs out of bed, wearing underwear
He moves to his window, sees Monica through her window directly across from his
Her eyes are closed as Lena braids her hair
Quincy kneels down, rests his arms on the window sill, and watches
- Quincy sits atop his  bike in front of Monica's house basketball is tucked under his arm
Monica emerges, walking her banana-seater
She is looking cute in her yellow dress and braids tied with ribbons basketball sits in her back basket
Quincy is taken aback, stares at her
You wanna be my girl
Monica blinks in surprise
She thinks for a moment
What do  have to do
guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together
And if you get mad at me,  gotta give you flowers
don't like flowers
Oh
How bout Twinkies
My mom won't ever buy them
Kay
Okay
An awkward beat between the new couple
Finally -- think we gotta kiss now
For how long
Five seconds
The two glance around, then climb off their bikes and walk to the secluded area between their two houses
(cont'd) Ready
Monica nods
They lean in, eyes wide open, and touch lips
Quincy counts to five with his fingers
They pull away, embarrassed, and walk back to the driveway
Monica lifts her bike from the ground and climbs on
(cont'd) Wait
Cause you're my girl now you gotta ride my bike
want to ride my own bike
My Dad always drives my Mom
So
(impatient) So that means  have to ride with you
Monica doesn't move
(cont'd) Come on
don't have to do what you say
Man, forget you then, stupid
You're stupid
And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the
Quincy's face instantly clouds
What
(laughs) Last time they won, Dr
was a nurse
Shut up
He shoves her, knocking her off her bike
(cont'd) don't wanna be your boyfriend, you ugly dog
Monica leaps up, her dress now dirty
She shoves him back
don't want to be your girlfriend, big head
They grapple, then fall to the ground swinging
: Men's  Finals
Michigan State against Indiana State
Magic Johnson against Larry Bird
Magic drives on Bird, hits a beautiful scoop shot
He celebrates as he jogs back down court
: : " " then "1988" - snarling Black cougar glares down from a large mural
On the court below, a girl's basketball play-off game
The bleachers are almost half-full with a hyped crowd
In the crowd are Monica's parents
Her father is excited and vocal
Her mom reads a book
Also in the stands, the ,
fine-ass  leans in the doorway, sporting a letter jacket with an embroidered "" on the chest
He gets as much attention as the game
couple of smile his way
"", "", "", "", you ain't got no alibi, you ugly, yeah, yeah, you ugly
"", "", "", "", how you think you got that way, your Mama, yeah, yeah, your Mama
On the floor, , dribbles down court
Just , her athletic figure has a few curves, but her loose jersey does little to show it off
Her hair is a mess and her knees are dark with bruises
small scar is visible on her cheek
She whips a no-look, around the back pass to a cutting under the basket, who scores
The crowd cheers
Monica defends the opposing point guard like a gnat
She knocks the ball loose and grabs it up
She goes for a lay-up and the opposing guard steps in front of her
Monica crashes into her, knocking both to the floor
No basket
Offensive foul, number thirty- two
Monica leaps up
What
She wasn't set
The referee ignores her
(cont'd) She was still moving
From the sideline,   waves frantically
Monica
Let it go
Monica stares down the ref as she jogs back on defense
The opposing guard drives the lane and puts up a shot
Monica leaps and blocks it with a taunting scream Technical foul
Number thirty-two
Coach Hiserman slams down his clipboard
Monica charges the referee
teammate grabs at her but she pushes her off
For what
Taunting
Taunting
Sub
Man, you suck
The referee whips back around, whistle in mouth
Coach Hiserman grabs her arm and pulls her off the court
Sit down and shut up
Monica slams down in a chair, sweat pouring, hands clenched
Her mom watches from the stands, completely embarrassed
The brother in the doorway turns, leaves
Monica looks up at the clock : - Monica, still benched, sits slumped in her chair, her sweats on, her face dry
She glances up at the clock Her team's up by
Her teammates dribble out the clock
The   and they dance across the floor
Monica looks up in the stands
-  - Camille, now forty-three, stands at the stove stirring a pot of gumbo
Lena, 21, and pretty, stands next to her, holding a handful of plates and silverware
and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour
But you use potato
Camille nods as they cross into: - At the table, Monica is in mid-conversation with her dad
Camille and Lena start setting the table
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me
And what am  supposed to say to the man
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench
You lost your head
was just showing emotion
So that means it's alright for you to act like that
(to Monica) What'd you do
(dismissive) nothing
don't know why  keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing
won't
'm a lesbian
Lena chokes on her drink, cracks up
That's not funny Well, that's what you think, isn't it
Cause 'd rather wear a jersey than an apron
Watch your mouth
Nathan quickly jumps in, tries to clean things up
Monica,  think her point is
maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball
(taken aback) What
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited
Munchkin, wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality
The coach from  is going to be at the championship
know
But chances are
Chances are there's still a chance
Nathan nods
She can always soften her dad, but not her mom
If you'd just listen for once, you'd realize you have a lot more going for yourself
You're smart, you'd be pretty if you put a comb to your head
mean, why walk around with your hair looking like "whodunit"
As her mom nags on, Monica looks out the window
,  and a  lean against a car parked at the curb, slobbing each other down
Just shy of 18, with a magnetic face and muscular body, he is a brother who drank his chocolate milk '
Monica watches and her mom's droning voice disappears
- , 17, can't get enough of Quincy's lips
Yo, Felicia,  gotta get to my game
She keeps kissing him
(cont'd) And my mom's about to be home
So 'm not good enough to meet your mom
Girl, she knew  had a hottie like you up inhere, she'd beat the black off me
(kissing him again) That's a lot of beating
She finally lets go, and slides into her car
Quincy watches her go with a cocky-ass smile
- frenzied crowd from floor to ceiling watches Quincy explode across the court
He is the complete point guard - hitting from the outside, driving to the hoop, no-look passes, playing tight
' His father, Zeke, now 39, stands on the sideline
His muscle has softened a little over the last five years of retirement
Monica sits alone in the bottom row, holding a basketball
She wears jeans and a -shirt and her hair is pulled back in a simple pony-tail
Quincy does a killer cross-over move and his Defender falls down
He lays up the ball, then taunts the player he just poster-ized
Behind Monica,   smack each other excitedly
One of them, , 17, pretty, big chest, slides down into the empty seat next to her
Hey, girl
Hey
Your hair looks so cute like that
Monica knows she's full of shit, doesn't respond
(cont'd) So
you know who 's asking to the Spring Dance
No
'mon, girl, you live next door
Who's been creeping
There's so many  just can't keep track
Well, can you give him this for me
Shawnee holds out a folded note
Monica doesn't take it
Give it yourself
don't wanna look fast
(drops it in Monica's lap) Thanks, girl
She slides back to her seat
Monica shakes her head, turns back to the game
Quincy dives for a loose ball
Shawnee clutches her friend
(cont'd) Good Lord, look at that ass
just want to lick the sweat off it
Monica takes in his tight body
He does look good
Quincy jogs back down court and flashbulbs go off
: - Flashbulbs
Quincy stands with his dad, his sweat still fresh, talking to a reporter named
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the
Don't go starting rumors, Jim
My son's college bound with or without basketball
You could make a career by telling me where
Gotta wait til the press conference
But you'd love for him to play at , like you did
'd love for him to get a good education
(then) That's it
Jim crosses away
Zeke puts an affectionate arm around his son as they walk toward the locker room
(cont'd) We should have another talk with Coach Carril at Princeton
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way
don't care about the team
care about the school
Didn't we already have this conversation
Zeke sighs, then: You played good
was proud of you
Quincy smiles wide
Yeah
(then) So you up for a game later
don't wanna hurt your feelings
You don't wanna hurt your back
(smiles) Anyway,  gotta get to this meeting
Tell your Mom 'm gonna be late
You work too hard, Pop
Let's hope  can say the same about you one day
Quincy watches his dad move toward the doors, stopping once to give an autograph
Zeke passes Monica, entering
Hey, Mr
Hey, Miss Baller
He exits
Monica approaches Quincy
Way to hoop
know this
What do you want
ride home
Your legs don't look broke
Look, big head, 'll be at your car
Guess "please" would be a stretch
(dryly) Please
'  - Silence as Quincy wheels his Jeep Wrangler toward home
Monica sits in the passenger seat, basketball in lap
She pulls Shawnee's note from her pocket
Quincy glances it over
What's that
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you
(thinks) Big-ass titties
Monica shoots him a disgusted look
Quincy reaches out
(cont'd) Give it here
Monica leans away, reads aloud
"
think you are so fine and 've been wanting to get with you
Let me take you to the Spring Dance and promise 'll leave you satisfied
" Monica laughs in disbelief
(cont'd) What a ho
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail
And
And
She's not saying, " think you're a nice guy and  wanna get to know you better," she's saying, " wanna bone
" So she's honest
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho
But guess you'll stick your dick in anything
Didn't know you cared so much
don't
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding
Who's Spalding
Quincy looks down at the   in her lap and cracks up
Monica glares
(cont'd) Fuck you, Quincy
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited
Who said 'm not getting recruited
Your hot-ass temper
Monica points to the scar on her cheek
'm not the one who put this scar here
God, here we go
When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose
Quincy turns, faces her
That's it, give it your best shot
Would you watch the damn road
mean it, give it your best shot, cause 'm tired of you holding that over my head
'm warning you, don't tempt me
'm warning you
You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you
Quincy pulls his Jeep into his driveway
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass
But because 'm a female,  get told to calm down and act like a "lady"
'm a ballplayer, okay
ball player
With a jacked-up attitude
Didn't know you cared so much
don't
Good
Monica slams out of the Jeep and walks across the lawn to her house
Quincy exits his ride
-   - Quincy steps inside, drops his bag on the floor
His mom, Nona, approaches from the dining room
What's up, Moms
Nona holds up a large hoop earring
What is this
Uh, your earring
look like some hoochie to you found it on your floor
What are you doing in my room
Quincy crosses into: - Nona follows
Quincy pulls open the fridge, grabs a couple of slices of cold pizza
Quincy,  told you about these fat-ass girls
We were just studying
'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught
They see you, they see dollar signs
Okay
You hearing me
've been hearing you
Nona eyes her son, then lets up
She gives him a kiss
How was your game
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated
Still the man
Yup
Nona smiles, starts back the kitchen
Where's your dad
Said he'd be home later
Later when
don't know, he had a meeting or something
Quincy exits to his room
-   '  - Nona angrily rolls her hair as Zeke undresses
had some players to see and hands to shake
At one in the morning
'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude
came second to the
'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job
Zeke looks at her, offended
(cont'd) didn't mean it like that
Yeah
'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family
You should see the tramps coming after Quincy
If you don't talk to him
have
beat
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree
No, you said  should get my degree like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office
Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold
Livid, Nona pulls off her gold bracelet, throws it at him
Fine, then how many nights home is that
Keep your voice down
She grabs a pair of gold earrings from her jewelry box, nails him
How about now
got a week yet
- '  - Quincy lies in bed, staring at the ceiling, as his parents continue to have it out
He rolls out of bed, pulls on a pair of shorts and a -shirt
He moves to his window, pulls it open and climbs out
- Quincy crosses the grass to Monica's window, knocks quietly
Long beat, then Monica sleepily stumbles to her window, wearing boxers and a tank top
She pushes it open and Quincy pulls himself through
- '  - Now a routine, Monica tosses Quincy one of her pillows and blankets, then crawls back into bed
He lays out on the floor and closes his eyes
Monica casts a long, sleepy glance at him, then drifts back to sleep
: - '  - Posters of Magic line three walls
hand-made collage of female college and Olympic ball-players fills the fourth
The only real "soft" touch is the teddy bear laying on the pillow
Monica sits on the floor between Lena's legs, as Lena puts Monica's hair in cornrows
That too tight
No
Mom's going to hate it
Always on my ass, anyway
Like you don't give her a hard time
Just cause  don't kiss her booty like you
Lena yanks Monica's head back
(cont'd) Ow
You need to
She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind
No one's forcing her
Just try and chill a little bit, alright
Monica doesn't answer
Lena yanks her head back again
Ow
Okay
They crack up
So what's going on with the Spring Dance
You have a date yet
(sarcastically) Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker
found you someone
Found
'm not some charity case
know
Mom tell you to do this
No
Damn, Lena
(then) Who is he
This brother from my college
He's in college
And he's fine, girl
How'd you get him to say yes
told him you looked like me
Oh, great
You do
Yeah, right
If you were tore up  would not be claiming you
Trust
Monica is not convinced
(cont'd) We'll do something cute with your hair, get you a dress, get you some heels
don't know how to walk in heels
Hey
You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight
Let me worry about your date
Lena starts to braid Monica's hair again
Beat, then
You ever been in love
Too many times
They ever love you back
Yeah, once  cut them off
Why
Monica just shrugs
Lena continues braiding
-  - Quincy and Zeke sweat through a playfully intense game of one- on-one
Quincy almost breaks Zeke's ankles with a cross-over dribble, and leaves him in the dust
He stops under the basket, waves for his Dad to come on before laying it up
Zeke smiles, tells Quincy to bring that shit on again
Quincy tries his cross-over again and this time Zeke picks him clean
Zeke taunts him as he easily backs in on him to the basket
-  - Camille stands at the stove, cooking up some yams
Monica enters with a gym bag over her shoulder, dribbling her ball
Monica, please
Monica stops
Sorry
(then) 'm leaving
Camille fills a spoon from the pot, holds it out
Taste this
can't eat before a game
Child, take a bite
Monica sighs, takes a bite
It's good
(cont'd) found some apricot chutney and mixed it with the yams
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say
Sure
In between all the other things have to do
She pulls off Monica's hood, then stops when she sees her braids
Monica looks back defiantly
What
Nothing
So good luck
She forces a smile, turns back to her cooking
Monica just nods, and crosses out
- The championship game
The bleachers are almost filled
Nathan and Lena sit, dead center
, -
Quincy sits in the back row with a couple of teammates
As always, he's the focus of much attention
Monica and her teammates are crouched in a tight huddle, surrounding Coach Hiserman
don't have to tell you girls how big this game is
We worked too damn hard all season to leave without this championship
So let's play smart
(looks at Monica) let's play in control, and let's kick some butt
Cougars on three
Once
two
three
Cougars
As Monica moves to center court, she glances up at the Coach, then at Quincy
Monica takes a deep breath as she lines up for the opening tip
An opposing player suddenly bumps her out of position
Monica glares at her, but just moves over
The ball is tossed up
: - Fourth quarter
One minute left
Cougars down three
Monica dribbles down court, bouncing with confidence as her opponent plays her tight
Monica zips a no-look pass to a teammate, who lays it up
Quincy punches one of his friends - "Oh shit
"  She is having the game of her life
On the defensive end, Monica steals the ball
She drives the length of the court, lays it up between two defenders
The crowd is hyped
Twenty seconds left, up by one
Monica hounds the opposing guard as she brings up the ball
Monica suddenly reaches in and knocks the ball loose
As she goes for the ball, a
Reaching in, number thirty-two
One-and- one
Boos fill the gym
Monica's eyes widen
No
Anger rushes through her as she starts for the ref
(cont'd) That's bullsh--
Monica
Monica catches herself, turns the word "shit" into a frustrated yell as she quickly moves away from the ref
Monica lines up for the free-throw, clenching her fists
The girl hits the first one
Then, she hits the second
With ten seconds left, down by one, Monica drives down court and throws up a prayer An opposing player grabs the rebound and Monica has no choice but to foul her
Monica has just fouled out
She walks to her bench and drops down
She buries her face in a towel and sobs
The buzzer goes off
Cougars lose
Quincy stares at Monica, feeling almost as bad as she does
: - '  - Monica sits slumped on her bed in a bathrobe, as Lena stands in front of her, putting the finishing touches on Monica's make-up
Might help if you didn't look so evil
don't even want to go
She steps back, looks at her work
Mom
Beat, then Camille enters
(cont'd) Talk to me
Camille stares at her daughter, taken aback by how great she looks
Go in my top drawer and get my pearls
Lena exits
Monica still looks miserable
(cont'd) You okay
Monica shrugs
(cont'd) Well, can you promise me one thing
What
Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else
just want you to enjoy being beautiful
Will you do that
Monica takes this in as Lena returns with Camille's pearls
Here
Camille puts them around Monica's neck
Monica looks back at her
You really think  look beautiful
Camille smiles at her daughter, nods
Monica touches the pearls
- An & song jams through the speakers, filling the dance floor with high school kids in suits and dresses
In the middle of the floor, Quincy gets his groove on with his date, Shawnee
She dances so provocatively, there is no mistaking what she has in mind for later
Over at the doors, Monica enters with her college date, , 21, and fine
Heads turn in surprise
Monica feels the stares, shifts nervously
Can  take your coat
You're cold
Monica starts to pull it off
No,  mean  can check it for you
(embarrassed) Oh, sorry
Jason pulls off her coat, revealing a dress that shows off everything Monica has been hiding
He checks out her frame, smiles
Your sister wasn't lying
He crosses to the coat check, leaving her alone
Quincy, who glances over from the middle of the dance floor, and abruptly stops
He stares at Monica in shock
Oh
shit
Quincy starts off the floor as a new song kicks in
,  like this song
Monica, sees Quincy approaching in his suit
She quickly steadies herself on her heels, brushes a curl from her face
See you made it
Yeah
You don't look half-bad
You either
Jason returns
Quincy looks at him, surprised
What's up, Black
'm Jason
Shawnee suddenly steps up, slides her arms around Quincy
Dang, girl,  didn't know Nike made dresses
Monica looks at Shawnee, wrapped around Quincy
She can't believe it
Guess we'll see you later
Monica heads into the crowd with her college man
Quincy watches her go
- Monica sits at a table with Jason
His arm lays casually across the back of her chair
Monica sits upright, stiff
So, you like school
Monica smiles nervously, nods
(cont'd) Yeah, high school was cool
don't remember sisters being as fine as you, though
Monica just holds that nervous smile
(cont'd) So what do you like studying
Gym
He waits for more, but nothing comes
'm an English major
You like English
Sort of
Careful
Huh
That was two words
Monica ducks her head, embarrassed
Jason laughs
(cont'd) Girl, how come you're so stressed
Sorry
mean, 'm having a good time with you
His arm slides off the back of her chair and onto her shoulders
(cont'd) So tell me what  have to do to make you have a good time with me
My mouth is kinda dry
Then 'll get you some punch
He stands, then
(cont'd) Just don't jet while 'm gone and leave a glass slipper behind
Monica's face lights up
Jason smiles
(cont'd) There we go
He crosses away to the refreshment table
Monica smiles wider, leans back in her chair with her legs splayed
She catches herself and quickly crosses them
couple of guys pass by and check her out
Monica smiles wider
Quincy steps up, holding two cups of punch
Hey
Hey
You having fun
Yeah
Yeah, the 's kinda whack, though
(beat) So who is this clown
He ain't Spalding
Guess not
So you took Shawnee, huh
The  puts on "Make It Last Forever" by Keith Sweat
Couples move to the dance floor
(embarrassed) You know, it was late and she asked
You want to dance
Jason stands behind her chair
Monica smiles shyly
Sure
Jason puts down her cup of punch, takes her hand, leads her to the dance floor
Quincy just shakes his head, then crosses to his table, grabs Shawnee's hand
'mon
He pulls Shawnee to the middle of the floor
Monica, nervous at first, a little awkward, but Jason gently guides her in a slow circle and she starts to relax
Jason moves his hands down Monica's back, pulling her in closer
Shawnee snuggles into Quincy's chest, runs her hands down his neck
The heat from bodies grows
Monica and Quincy glance up at the same time and catch each other's eyes
They start to look away but find they can't
Eyes locked as they dance, they move together, almost feel each other
Finally, as their bodies turn, they lose sight
Monica puts her head to Jason's chest, Quincy slides his hands lower down Shawnee's back
The music continues
'  - Jason and Monica are parked up on Mulholland Drive
Cool 's " Need Love" plays on the tape deck
Jason has his arm around Monica, ready to make his move
(rattling) Freshman year, my free throw percentage was fifty-one percent, cause  was shooting it like a jump shot
Jason leans in, kisses her bare shoulder
(cont'd) Um
but then sophomore year  was shooting seventy-five percent from the line
Jason kisses her neck
(cont'd) uh, by keeping my feet set and really following through
Jason goes in for the slam dunk
Kisses Monica on the lips
It's the first time she's really been kissed
Jason pulls away, smiles
That was nice
Uh-huh
Your sister told me hands off, but can't help myself
Jason leans in
Monica closes her eyes, and they kiss some more
Monica tries to follow his practiced lips
Jason's tongue slides in and their bodies slide down
His hand moves across her breast
Monica's eyes pop open
Wait
Shh
It's okay
Naive and inexperienced, Monica shuts her eyes tight
: - Jason's car pulls off, Monica slowly moves to her front door
She looks in the living room window
Her mom is asleep in a chair, trying to wait up
Monica catches her reflection in the window
She glares at her made-up face, then wipes at her mouth with her hand
She steps back , walks to her bedroom window
She pulls it open, kicks off her heels and climbs through
- '  - Monica moves to her bed and drops down
She sits motionless for a beat, then suddenly feels something beneath her
She reaches for it
' Monica stares at it in her hands
Light suddenly cuts through the darkness
Monica turns and is surprised to see Quincy standing in the middle of his room, pulling off his jacket
Monica moves to her window, pulls it open
Psst
Quincy looks over
Beat
Then he climbs out of his window, drops down
- Early night for you, isn't it
was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all
Monica doesn't respond
(cont'd) So where'd you go after
(beat) Mulholland Drive
Figures
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit
None of your business
Well, 'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied
That what you think
Monica shrugs
(cont'd) Little after you left,  told Shawnee it was time to go and  drove her ass straight home
And after she told me was the dumbest brother in the world, took off
Why
Cause  don't just stick my dick in anything
Monica takes this in
was sitting in Jason's ride with him kissing on me and feeling on me and it was really bugging me cause  couldn't remember how many offensive boards  had in the championship
And then  guess she got tired of me sort of accidentally kneeing him in the balls
Beat, then Quincy cracks up
Monica laughs with him
Four
What
You had four offensive rebounds
Monica stares at him, surprised
She thinks
Hold up for a second
Monica disappears back inside
Beat, then she re-appears
She climbs out her window, drops down
Quincy looks at her
She holds out the envelope from
When'd you get this
It was on my bed when  came in
(then) Can you just
(beat) You sure
Monica nods
Quincy takes the envelope, sits down on the grass
Monica sits down beside him
He tears open the envelope and pulls out the letter
Monica stares at him as he reads, trying to see an answer in his face
Quincy finally looks up
Expressionless
(cont'd) Damn girl
Monica's face falls
And then, a slow smile spreads across Quincy's face
(cont'd) They want you
Monica grabs the letter, reads
Her head just drops as a tidal wave of relief washes over her
Quincy smiles
(cont'd) Congratulations
Monica looks up, cheesing
(cont'd) 'm gonna be there, too
'm announcing tomorrow
knew it
Monica can't contain her excitement
Without thinking, she gives Quincy a kiss
They pull away, then break into nervous laughter
What was that about
know, right
But they both want more
They lean in, kiss deeply
They fall back on the grass
And kiss
And kiss
Suddenly, Monica pulls away, sits up
Quincy follows, instantly apologetic
Monica stares at him, then to his surprise, she reaches over, gives his shirt a small tug with her finger
Quincy stares at her, then slowly pulls off his tie
He nervously unbuttons his shirt
He fumbles with the last two buttons
Monica slowly pulls down the straps of her dress, self- conscious
Quincy can't keep his eyes off her
He pulls off his pants
Monica glances down and her eyes widen
She looks scared to death
Quincy smiles softly, leans in and gently kisses her
She relaxes
They lay down
Quincy reaches into his pants for a condom
His hands shake as he puts it on
They stare at each other as he moves on top of her
Quincy pushes inside her
She flinches back in pain
Quincy immediately stops as tears spring to her eyes
(softly) You want to stop
Monica shakes her head
Quincy pushes inside again
He looks down at her with tenderness, moves gently, kisses her tears
: 1988-89  Finals
Game
The Lakers against the Pistons
With seconds left, up by three, Magic guards Isiah Thomas
They collide, no foul is called and the Lakers win their second championship
: : " " -   - Championship banners hang from the ceiling
sit on the first two rows of bleachers
The eight upperclassmen kick back in the second row, comfortable, confident
Monica and the three other freshmen sit in front of them, jiggling nervously
stands in front of the team
don't know some of you very well yet, and you don't know me because 'm still being nice to you
Laughter from the upperclassmen
(cont'd) But my philosophy is simple
Hard work and sacrifice
There's a lot of basketball history and pride here at , but just putting on the cardinal and gold doesn't make you a great player
Hard work and sacrifice makes you a great player
What you were doesn't matter anymore
For the first time in your life, you won't be the best
You'll be going up against women that are bigger and stronger and better than you ever imagined
So the question is, how will you respond
Well, your answer better be hard work and sacrifice because that's the only way you're gonna make it through
Vince Lombardi preached it and teach it, "There is only one way to succeed at anything and that is to give everything
" Coach Miller pauses a moment to let her words sink in
Monica glances at her fellow freshman for their reactions
Like her, a lot of cockiness, a lot of fear
(cont'd) few simple rules
Eleven o'clock curfew, no exceptions
Always be on time, no exceptions
Attend every class, no exceptions
No drugs, no alcohol, no getting pregnant
And finally, respect yourselves, respect your coaches and respect your teammates, right Sidra
, senior point guard, nods from the second row
That's right, Coach
By the end of this year some of you will hate me
The upperclassmen crack up
(cont'd) Some of you will want to go home
(cat-calling) Cree
, junior forward, ducks her head sheepishly
Coach Miller smiles
But  guarantee you, if you work hard and sacrifice, all of you will be better basketball players and better people
Monica nods, accepting the challenge
- It's cold, it's dark
It's six a
m
The team pounds down the track, pushing through a two-mile run
Monica and her freshman teammate/roommate , 18, breathe heavily from the back of the pack
From the sideline
Let's go, freshmen, you're getting spanked
Monica sucks it up, runs faster
She reaches the middle of the pack, then runs out of gas
She drops back to the rear
(cont'd) Monica, 'm putting you on my Wizard of Oz team
No brains, no courage and no heart
- Defensive drills
One by one, players crouch low and move backwards down the sideline
, a junior guard, hustles through the drill
Way to work, Zvette
Monica starts the drill
(cont'd) Get lower, Monica, move your feet
Monica grimaces as she squats lower
(cont'd) said lower
Coach Miller stops her, squats down low beside her
(cont'd) This is low, got it
Offense sells tickets, defense wins games
Monica starts again
- The team stands along the baseline
Monica stands right below the free throw line
, 6'4", 200 pound senior, drives the lane
Monica steps in front of her, and is slammed to the floor
She lays still for a moment, stunned by the impact
Laughter from the baseline
Dag, you took her out,
Teammates  and  crack up
think she just said "Mommy
" No, she said "mammary
" Monica, you trying to tell me you can't take a little challenge
Monica crawls to her feet
can take it
This time get your feet set
Monica moves back into position
Toni drives at her again
Monica steps in front of her, braces herself
Toni slams into her and she hits the floor
Monica blinks back the pain as she pops back up
(cont'd) Next
Monica wobbles back to the sideline
- The team is spread out, lifting weights
Monica lies on a weight bench, her arms shaking as she struggles to bench press fifty-pounds
Sidra stands behind her, spotting
You got it, c'mon, lift
Monica lifts it with Sidra's help
(cont'd) That's it
Coach hates me, doesn't she
She hates all freshmen
Monica scowls, discouraged
What's up with that
Hey, don't take it personal
And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other
We're teammates, okay
Thanks, Sidra
Besides
've been starting point the last two years
Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot
Sidra walks off, leaving Monica with the bar on her chest
Finally, she has to drop the weight to the floor
- Monica and Quincy walk to class, his arm draped casually across her shoulders
Quincy gets looks and smiles
Monica just looks exhausted
You finish the reading for -con
Yeah
What'd it say
Basically broke down how 'm gonna make mad loot in the , me being such a limited commodity and all
Whatever, big head
Quincy laughs
pass by, smile
#1 Hey, -man, you gonna take us to the Final Four
We'll see
#2 We'll be watching
The girls continue on
Monica looks at Quincy
What
You do see me standing here, right
can't be nice to a fan
Fine, Quincy
can't help girls coming up to me
said fine
Quincy looks at her sulking
He suddenly pulls her down onto the nearby lawn, and cradles her
It's okay, little baby
(struggling) Quit
Quincy grips her tighter, rocks her
Students pass by, laugh
Shhh
Daddy's here
Monica finally cracks up
You're such a punk
He gives her a kiss
All these girls
you're the only one know who's for real
Monica smiles, kisses him back
Always
- heated scrimmage between the women's "" team (the starting five) and "" team (five who want to be starting)
Monica runs point for the "" team, playing opposite Sidra
Sidra is all over Monica, slipping in cheap shots, but Monica starts to come on
She does a quick cross-over and loses Sidra
She dishes off to Shayla, who scores
Sidra
You feel like playing any ""
Sidra scowls as she runs down court
She gets a pass in the corner, tires to make a move but Monica slaps the ball loose
Monica grabs it, drives to the three-point line, puts up the shot
Monica stays posed, with her arm up
Sidra takes advantage, sprints back down court
She get the long pass, lays it up
Coach Miller blows her whistle
(cont'd) Monica
Get over here
Monica jogs over, sheepish
(cont'd) While you're so busy posing, your man just scored
Monica drops her head
(cont'd) Show me again
What
You love to pose so much, let's see it again
Beat, then Monica holds up her arm like she just shot the ball
Snickers from her teammates
(cont'd) want you to stand like that for the rest of practice
Coach
want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because  don't ever want to see it again, you hear me
(then) Dora, take her spot
, freshman, jogs onto the court
Coach Miller blows her whistle and the scrimmage resumes
Monica stands alone on the sideline, posing, and feeling like an asshole
- Monica sits on the bench in front of her locker, dressing after the shower
Shayla sits next to her
Nearby, Lisa and Sandra apply make-up in the mirror
Zvette passes by, already dressed
Lisa turns
,  know you're gonna shower first
don't smell bad
And you wonder why your ass sits alone on the bus
Cree glances over from another sink, as she snaps the chain on her
You guys curse too much
Since when is "ass" a curse
walks past
Whoa, it's as big as yours
They crack up
Cree just shakes her head
Two pass by Monica with their arms raised, mimicking her pose
Monica shakes her head
Sidra glances at Monica from her spot on the bench
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman
was just playing ball
You were trying to make me look bad
Didn't have to try very hard
Ears prick up around the locker room
Sidra stands
Girl, don't you know you're just sloppy seconds
Monica rises
What
Toni tries to step in
Sidra, let it go
Only reason you're here is cause Tonya Randall got pregnant and decided not to come
They were done recruiting
, senior forward, shakes her head
That's cold, Sid
Just thought the girl should know
Monica is stunned
Sidra saunters to the showers
Shayla nudges her with her shoulder
Don't even trip
She's just mad cause she's bow-legged
- '  - Monica and Quincy lay feet to face on Quincy's twin bed
Monica's hand holds an ice bag on Quincy's hip
Quincy's arm rests across an ice bag on Monica's ankle
Forget Tonya Randall
'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me
Then prove her wrong
don't have it easy like you, alright
There's no red carpet laid out for me
So you're gonna act salty all night
Quincy's roommate/teammate , 18, suddenly pops his head into the room
Yo, dog, we're about to order some wings
Nah, thanks
Reggie shrugs, closes the door
Quincy looks at Monica, still brooding
(cont'd) Fine
Don't worry about proving everybody wrong, okay
You can't handle the pressure, 'll understand
That was so weak
Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the
You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway
Monica shoves Quincy's ice bag down his sweat pants
He leaps up
(cont'd) Aaaah
Damn, girl
That's what you get
He smiles as he pulls the ice
Then looks her up and down
So how about a little one-on-one
What are we playing for
Clothes
What
Quincy locks the door, sets up his indoor hoop
score, you strip
You score,  drop something
Monica looks at him, then cracks up
Give me the ball
My court,  go first
Quincy grips the ball
Monica crouches low on defense
Quincy drives past her and slams down a vicious dunk
(cont'd) Strip
Monica makes a face, then pulls off her sweatshirt
Quincy skips back
Monica drops low again
Quincy fakes her out and slams down another vicious dunk
He laughs
(cont'd) Where's the ""
Kiss my booty
Plan to
Monica glares through her smile, then pulls off her -shirt, leaving her in a bra and shorts
Quincy goes for another dunk, but this time, Monica reaches out,
Quincy drops the ball
Monica picks it up and lays it in
(cont'd) Hold up
All's fair in love and basketball
Strip
Quincy pulls off his shirt
Monica moves back into position
Quincy drops down low
Monica fakes, gets him to leave his feet
She slips under him and scores
She laughs
(cont'd) Too bad you got your mama's height, huh
Quincy pulls off his sweats, leaving him in just drawers
Monica takes in the view as she moves back into position
She holds the ball out, taunting
Quincy pretends to reach for it, but grabs her breast instead
Oh, my bad
She drives
Quincy just steps out of the way and lets her score
Monica snatches the ball off the floor
Yo, where's the ""
Right here
Monica turns, finds Quincy butt-naked
He moves her against the wall and kisses her
Monica drops the ball, wraps her arms around him
She smiles

wanted you to
Game over
They hit it
Sportscaster   talks animatedly about the upcoming season
It's the start of the new college season and 'm like a kid in a candy store
Too many great teams to choose from
You have your Dukes', Kentuckys', Arkansas', but my surprise treat this season
Sportscaster   reports on the upcoming women's season
The women of Troy made it to the Sweet Sixteen last year and are returning four starters from that squad
And many consider their recruiting class one of the best in the nation
The highlight of that class,
is Quincy McCall, one of my diaper dandies
He's a real
, a prime- time player
Every college in the country wanted him but he chose to follow in his father's footsteps and become a Trojan
He's gonna have a lot on his shoulders this season
but Coach Cheryl Miller feels that if just one of her freshmen has a breakout year, they can go all the way
It's a long season, anything can happen, but one thing is for sure
It's gonna be awesome, baby
: - hundred flashbulbs pop as Quincy jogs out to center court
The crowd goes crazy as
- Monica sits on the bench, watching Sidra run the floor against , as
- Quincy drives to the three-point line against Cal and puts it up
It drops through the net
He pounds his fist against the number twenty-two on his chest, nods to Zeke standing behind the bench, as
- Coach Miller motions to Monica
She jumps up, pulls off her sweats
She jogs past Arizona bench and onto the floor, as
- Quincy goes up for a dunk against North Carolina
He jams it down, grips the rim, and pulls his legs up high, as
- Monica catches a long outlet pass
She drops a no-look bounce pass between two Berkeley defenders, to a teammate who scores
She jogs back, as
- Zeke grips Quincy's head proudly, affectionately, as they walk off the floor after a game against Washington, as
-   - Sidra crashes to the floor, immediately grabs at her ankle
Monica rises off the bench
: - Televisions hang from every corner, broadcasting various games
Zeke and Quincy sit at a bar
Quincy is still hyped from his game
up and under between two defenders, with the left hand
That's gotta make SportsCenter
Zeke just nods as the Bartender/Owner crosses over
He is an ex-ballplayer named
(cont'd) They can't stop me, Pop
What are you having, Zeke
Genuine Draft
And an orange juice for my kid
Cross-over's looking good, Quincy know your old man didn't teach you that
Didn't need a cross-over to post you up
Terry laughs as he moves off to fix the drinks
Something is on Zeke's mind, but before he can speak on it
You know, the numbers 'm putting up are better than any freshman
Some people are saying 'm a definite lottery pick
Zeke suddenly focuses
What people
You know, people
Well, tell them to mind their damn business
You're smart enough to get a degree
'm also good enough to go pro
You know how much higher the play level is in the
Give yourself time to develop, Quincy
Get an education
The ain't going nowhere
You came out early
Your mom got pregnant and  had to make choices
You don't have a choice
Okay
Silence, then
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess 'm dealing with
What mess
there's this thing out there
This paternity suit
What
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party
now 'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy
(then) Anyway,  told your mom  wanted to be the one who told you
Tell me what
just told you
mean, it's not true, is it
Zeke stares at his son
You got the balls to ask me that
Quincy can't hold his father's look
Zeke shakes his head, hurt
Sorry
No, you need to hear me say it, 'll say it
It's not true
Quincy looks in his father's eyes, knows he's telling the truth
So what are you gonna do
want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle
Why
case like this could hang around for months and 'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips
"  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me
What's Mom think
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years
Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart
We'll just have to see how it plays out
(then) 'm giving her some space, couple days
Just then, a   approaches
Yo, -man, great game
Thanks
The student holds out a piece of paper, without even a glance to Zeke
Can  get an autograph
Quincy nods, signs the guy's paper
Zeke watches his son, the rising star
- Through the windows, we see Quincy enter the house
He glances around, then walks to the living room
He sees his mom sitting outside by the pool, drink in hand, looking torn up
He pulls open the sliding glass door
Nona jumps, then sees Quincy
She quickly puts her drink down
You scared me
Sorry
You okay
'm fine
Quincy glances at her half-hidden glass
Last time  remember you drinking was when Marvin Gaye died
No response from Nona
(cont'd) This about Dad
Guess he talked to you
Don't sweat it, okay
Sooner or later the truth'll come out
(beat) Whose truth are you talking about
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family
She doesn't respond
Quincy studies her
(cont'd) mean, you believe him, right
Nona sits silent, humiliated
(cont'd) Mom
Just
leave it alone
This is just about money, you know that
Quincy, please
mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's
Guess  should have been telling your father
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's
He wouldn't lie
Nona grabs an envelope beside her and throws it at him
Confused, Quincy opens it
: Zeke outside a party
, his arm is around a young woman
, they
, they climb into his car
(cont'd) What
what's this
hired somebody
How pathetic is that
After all his late nights and "meetings" and  still needed proof
Quincy just stares at the photos
(cont'd) used to think  was lucky just to be married to Zeke McCall, but 'm too tired
Quincy looks stricken, but he moves to Nona, comforts her as she cries
- Monica sits with a devastated Quincy, high up in the bleachers
In the distance, the clock-tower glows 10:50
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time 'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something
know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you
What has he been to me
mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing
Like it was easy
(then) And 'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense
She understands
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers
"  Man, how stupid am
You're not stupid
know a lot of brothers dog their wives, just never thought my pops would do some shit like this
Monica puts her arms around him
They sit there, quiet
Monica glances up at the clock tower
She reacts
Quincy notices
(cont'd) What
Nothing
(beat) Why don't we walk to my dorm
'm not up for running into anybody
Let's just kick it here, alright
can't
Why not
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew
If 'm late,  don't suit up
Quincy looks at her, almost in shock
Didn't realize you were watching the clock
mean,  can stay a few more minutes
Nah
Don't sweat it
Quincy
For real
should be alone, anyway
Monica reluctantly stands
Will you call me when you get in
Quincy nods
Monica gives him a kiss
Then she turns and crosses away
/'  - The lights are off but Monica sits up in bed '
Shayla lies under her covers across the room
shouldn't have left
Go to sleep
You should have seen him, Shay
Mon, Sidra's out for one game, and you got the start
But you get caught breaking curfew and Coach is gonna send your ass back to the bench
You'll see your man tomorrow
Shayla's warning slowly sinks in
Finally, Monica lays down
: - The clock tower glows 12:30
Quincy still sits in the bleachers
Alone
Tears fill his eyes as his world comes crashing down
: - vs
Louisiana Tech
The packed crowd is hyped
Nathan sits by himself in the stands, excited
Monica sits on the bench with four of her teammates
The rest of the team is lined up in front of them, including Sidra in street clothes
And now the starting line-up for your Women of Troy
At center, a senior, Toni Noise
Toni rises, jogs through the line of teammates to the court
(cont'd) At forward, a senior, Lisa Mason
Lisa stands, skips through the line
(cont'd) At forward, a junior, Zvette Mitchell
Zvette jumps up, bumps into each teammate as she moves down the line
(cont'd) At guard, a freshman, Monica Wright
Monica takes a deep breath, then jogs through the line
She gets to the middle of the floor and looks around with her game face on
(cont'd) And at guard, a sophomore, Sandra Perez
Sandra jogs out and the rest of the team follows
Everyone gathers in a tight circle with their arms around each other
Look y'all, we got all these people here to see big-bad, La Tech
We need to let them know that this is our house
So everybody better leave everything out on that floor, you got that
Ready
One, two, three
Team
: - sellout crowd for the men's /Temple game
And Quincy is having the worst game of his life
He drives down court on a fast break
He ignores his two open teammates and puts up a three-pointer
It hits nothing but air
The crowd boos
Humiliated, Quincy tries to steal the ball back and commits a stupid foul
His teammates glare at him as they line up for free throws
- Monica's game
Late second half
down two
Monica drives the lane, drawing two defenders
She looks like she's about to force up a shot, then suddenly whips up a pass to a wide-open Sandra at the three-point line
Nothing but net
up one
Coach Miller claps intensely on the sideline
That's it, that's it
Ten seconds left
Game on the line
Monica tries to lob a pass inside to Toni
The pass is knocked away and grabbed up by the opposing point guard
It is a one-on-one between Monica and the guard
The girl drives hard for the winning hoop
Monica races to the key and slides in front of her
The guard goes up and slams into Monica
Both crash to the floor as the ball drops through the net and the buzzer goes off
The two women stare up at the  from the floor
And then -- Offensive foul
Charging
No basket
Monica leaps up as the crowd goes crazy
Toni grabs up Monica in a hug as their teammates celebrate around them
- Quincy drags himself to his bench, slumps down dejectedly, as the Temple Owls celebrate their win around him
- The female players continue to celebrate as they undress
Shoot, you see that crowd
We need to be playing in the Sports Arena
Hell yeah
They give each other a pound
Lisa looks at Monica, standing in her shorts and sports bra
Oh damn, Mon
What
think ol' girl took out your chi-chis with that charge
The women break into laughter
Monica smiles
Kiss my ass
Nah,  think she took that too
Sandra, please, last time you chest- bumped me, it took you three tries
More laughter
Monica looks over at Toni, sitting quietly at the bench
(cont'd) Yo, , why you so quiet
(beat) don't want to go play overseas
thought you were hyped about going to Portugal next year
It's never gonna be like this
Playing in front of my family, hanging out with my girls
Probably not even a McDonald's
Nah, there's always a McDonald's
Least you got an offer
My agent's still looking
(to Lisa) What about you
(beat) Maybe it'd be worth it if  knew some day could come back here and play
But for right now, it's law school
(
) Monica
Monica turns, sees Coach Miller standing in her office doorway
She motions for her
Monica heads over
Sidra watches
'  - Trophies, plaques and photos fill every empty space
Coach Miller sits behind her desk
Monica stands before her
You could've given up after you threw that ball away
But you kept your head and you showed real heart
Thanks
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and  want to shake things up a bit, so 'm starting you at point again
(confused) thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game
You want the job or not
Realization finally hits
Yeah
Yes
Monica looks at Coach Miller completely thrown
What
It's just
it seems like you're always yelling at me
You think 'd go hoarse for a player with no potential
When  ignore you, that's when you worry
(then) Go get dressed
Monica nods, crosses out
- As Monica walks back to her teammates, Coach Miller steps into the doorway
Sidra
Sidra looks at Monica as she rises, crosses over
Monica avoids her eyes as they pass
Sidra enters the office and the door closes
Yo sis, what's going on
Beat, then Monica smiles
: - Black folks pack the cramped houseparty, bumping to a phat hip hop joint
Monica bounces through the throng
grabs her arm
' Yo, great game
Thanks
Another - grabs her arm
- Girl, you can play
Monica smiles wider
She spots Reggie dancing in the crowd, moves to him
Reg
You seen Quincy
What's up, girl
(louder) Derek said  was here
We'll roll through
Monica is suddenly pulled into a dance routine by Sandra and Lisa
She laughs, tires to move away, but they won't let her go
Monica gives in, grooves with them
: Quincy walks through the door with a half-empty forty in his hand
Girls immediately try to grab his attention from the dance floor, or stare him down from the sidelines
Quincy sees Monica on the dance floor
He stands, watching her
Takes a drink
Monica finally looks over, sees him
She smiles, crosses to him
Hey
What's up
've been trying to find you all day
Here  am
She glances at the forty in his hand
Sorry about your game
It happens, right
Shayla suddenly grabs Monica from behind
(to Monica) What's up, superstar
(then, to Quincy) Your girl was on tonight
She tell you
(beat) heard
She also tell you she ganked the starting spot from Sidra
Monica looks at him for a reaction
Nah
He downs the last of his forty
(cont'd) Where's the keg at
Balcony
He heads for the glass doors
Monica and Shayla follow
- Reggie approaches the group
Gives Quincy a nod
What's up, dog
(to Shayla) Hey, flyness
Get off the bra strap, Reggie, you're a ho
He laughs, then turns back to Quincy
Coach is gonna kill us in practice tomorrow
Might even pull his lips off your dick, limp as your game was tonight
Quincy just looks at him
That's funny
Monica leans against Quincy, affectionately
he's just playing,
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball
Sure
Whatever's clever
Silence
Reggie and Shayla crack up
Quincy shakes his head, moves to the keg line
'all need to quit
She starts for Quincy (
) Monica
Monica looks over, sees Sidra standing in the doorway
There is no escaping this confrontation
She glances at Quincy, then crosses over
Quincy turns, sees her disappear back inside
- What's up
Just wanted to say good game
But
No buts
Took a lot of heart to take that charge
Thanks
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni
Ten seconds left, you run out the clock
Monica shakes her head
An awkward silence
(cont'd) 'd be lying if  said  wasn't pissed
know
Just one word of advice for next season
What's that
Never let a freshman take your spot
Sidra turns and walks away
- Quincy takes one long drink from his cup
, 20, and spandexed, stands directly in front of him, flirtatiously
Excuse me
Excuse me
He steps aside as she tries to work the keg
Nothing comes out
She nods at his cup, smiles
If that's the last beer, you and  are sharing
Shayla glances over as Quincy pumps the keg a couple of times
Kerry hands him her cup and he starts filling it up
(cont'd) like watching you play
Number twenty- two
Guess you didn't see the game
Quincy knows he should blow her off, but he's digging the attention
He hands her back her cup
(cont'd) What's your name
Kerry
know
Monica looks over at Quincy and sees him talking to the hoochie
The girl looks too damn comfortable
Monica moves back outside
(cont'd) 'll see you
-man
She swishes past Monica
Shayla "accidentally" bumps her
Kerry glares
Who was that
Nobody
Who's nobody
Look, this party's whack
You ready to go
You want to go talk
Not really
He leans in, kisses her drunkenly
She pulls away
We could finish what we were talking about last night
Quincy kisses her again
(cont'd) (pushing him off) Quincy, quit
You're drunk
They fall silent
You know what, 'm just gonna crash
(agitated) Fine
Maybe 'll come by later
Nah
have curfew
He starts to walk away, then stops
(cont'd) Oh, by the way
Congratulations
He goes
Monica stares after him
/'  -   - Quincy pushes through his front door, then stops short in his doorway
Zeke sits on the couch
What are you doing here
Your door was unlocked
Still is, so let yourself out
We need to talk
We ain't got nothing to talk about
messed up, okay,  know that
But ain't that kid's father
Lucky kid
Look,  ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen
And some things should never fucking happen
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me
ain't a damn liar
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she
Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew wasn't ready for no marriage
So now you're saying my mother trapped you
'm saying  handled my responsibilities like a man
But when you're in the , you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel
And another twenty that made it past security on your floor
And the boldest one is standing right at your door
And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game
(then) 'm sorry  lied to you,  shouldn't have
But  did it cause  love you
Zeke looks at his son, meaning every word
Quincy stares back, long and hard
Since we're being honest, guess  should tell you
'm dropping out of school and going pro
What
Quincy just stares back
(cont'd) Quincy, you'd be making the biggest mistake of your life
(sarcastic) From your mouth
(desperate) know your mad at me, okay, but  can't let you do this
Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary
Zeke is taken aback by the hatred in his son's eyes
He turns and without another word, exits
- Quincy stands across the street from the houseparty, staring up at the balcony
Monica leans against the railing, laughing with a couple of teammates
Quincy watches her, then turns and walks away
: - Monica's eyes are on fire as she races an Oregon player for a loose ball
Both dive for it, slide across the floor
Monica grabs it up, screams for a time-out as her opponent tries to wrestle away the ball
/'  - Monica walks down the hall to Quincy's suite
The window is open
The sounds of Nintendo are heard
She walks in without knocking
/'  -   - Reggie sits on the couch with a , playing Nintendo's "Duck Hunt"
Hey, y'all
They barely give her a nod
Monica crosses into /'  - Quincy stands at an ironing board, ironing a -shirt
Hey
Hey, what's up
You weren't at my game
Yeah, sorry about that
had this meeting with this guy
Quincy pulls on the -shirt
(cont'd) You win
Yeah,  hit a three at the buzzer
The "man" again
(smiles) Woman
knock at the front door
Quincy exits
- Monica follows, then stops short
Kerry, the spandexed girl from the party, stands in the doorway
Hey, you
Hi
Quincy gives her a hug
Monica stares at him in disbelief
Reggie and his teammate smack each other, "Oh shit
" Oh, Kerry, this is Monica
Monica, Kerry
What the hell's going on
We're going to get some food
Are you out of your mind
Maybe  should come back
No
You stay, 'll leave
She storms out
-  - Monica slams her car door
Her face is a mask of anger and confusion
Camille exits the house, car keys in hand
She sees her
Monica
What are you doing here
Didn't know  needed a reason to come home
Don't be defensive
'm just surprised to see you
Dad around
He's still at the bank
Monica glowers
Camille looks at her
(cont'd) Everything okay
(clearly not) Yeah
Camille just nods, doesn't bother asking again
Well, 'm going to get dinner
She pulls open her car door
Beat, then
(cont'd) It's just a game
What
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude
But it's just a game
Monica rolls her eyes, as her mom leaves
- Quincy sits on the wall outside of Monica's dorm, as Monica slowly makes her way up the walk
She sees him, stops
Can we talk
Talk to your new girlfriend
just took the ho to Burger King, alright
Cheap date
Least she had time for me
So you fucked around to prove a point
just said  didn't fuck around
But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me
What, "-man", did  forget to kiss your ass like everybody else
You forgot to be there
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad  had a curfew
What was  supposed to do
Stay
If  stayed,  wouldn't be starting
Least you got your priorities straight
never asked you to choose
Never had to
'm a ballplayer
If anyone knows what that means it should be you
Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me
Go fuck Dick Vitale
Monica punches the shit out of Quincy, then pushes past him
Quincy grabs her arm, stopping her
(cont'd) Hold up
'm sorry, alright
They stand, silent
Trying to come down from their anger
How do  know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me
If we're going to be together  have to be able to trust you
'm not asking for us to be together
Monica flinches in shock
What
'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for
How are you going to tell me what  have time for
mean, whatever  did
we can fix this
don't think so
You don't think so
Look, 'm entering the draft
You're what
decided to go pro
And who knows where 'll end up, you know
Monica's heart is sinking fast
When did you decide all this
Few days ago
So that's it, just forget about us
Damnitt, Monica
This ain't about us anymore, it's about me
Monica is crushed
Beat as, Quincy struggles to stay cold
(cont'd) But, you know, 'd still like us to be friends
Friends
She fights back tears
Quincy has to look away
Monica can't respond
So
guess 'll see you around
Uh huh
Beat, then Quincy turns and walks away
Monica tries to fight her tears but her pain, hurt and confusion are too much
Finally, she gives in, and the tears fall
Press conference
Magic sits beside his wife Cookie
He shocks the world as he announces his retirement from basketball
: : " " then "1993" Madrid, Pampolona, the running of the bulls, old-world architecture
Finally, we rest on a large billboard, a photo of Monica in a basketball uniform, drinking a Spanish soft-drink
- Monica jogs down the congested cobble-stone street, a sports bag over her shoulder
She is -
Half-assed braids frame her matured features
She passes store fronts, street vendors, and dodges pedestrians, as she makes her way toward a large, older arena
- An excited crowd jockeys for position at the front doors
Above them, a huge banner reads "Campeonato de Europeo"
(European Championships"
) As Monica heads for the back entrance, a cheer goes up from a large contingent in the crowd
Monica smiles, waves back
break from line, run to her
Baloncesto
Balencesto
(Basketball
Basketball
) Oye
They giggle, hold out a piece of paper and a pencil
Autografo
As Monica signs her autograph, a tall woman carrying a matching sports bag approaches
She is , Spanish, 33
(thick Spanish accent) Monica
What is up
Oye, Luisa
Monica hands the girls her autograph and they run off
Large game, no
Si
Large game
They duck into the arena
-   - Paint peels off the walls
Windows are broken overhead
Monica sits alone at her locker, taping her own ankles
Her , all from Spain, sit on the surrounding benches, talking and joking among themselves in Spanish
Monica is clearly an outsider
, Spanish, late 40's, enters
Silenco
The women immediately stop talking
gives an animated, impassioned speech in Spanish
Monica doesn't understand a word, just continues taping her ankles
Coach Parra finishes and the women clap, pumped up
Monica turns to Luisa, seated next to her on the bench
What did he say
He say to give the ball to you
- The arena is  with a raucous European crowd, chanting and waving signs - the love their women's basketball
Monica walks onto the floor, tucking her jersey into her shorts
The uniforms are old-style - polyester and tight
Her club's name is stitched on the front, ""
As she hits center court, a smile suddenly breaks through her game face
Standing opposite her, playing for the opposing Italian club is Sidra,
Well, what do you know
What's up, Sidra
'm gonna love winning this championship in your house
How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian
They move into position
The ball is tossed up
Italy winds the tip and the ball is passed to Sidra
Monica hounds her as she brings up the ball
Sidra shoves her off and to the floor, and scores
No whistle
Women's pro ball is at a whole other level
Bigger, better, tougher
The ball is passed in to Monica
She drives down court, goes up for a lay up
An Italian player shoves Monica in mid-air, taking out her legs
Monica crashes on the hardwood
whistle
Monica lays still for a moment, then pushes herself up and walks to the free-throw line without a word
Without emotion
-  - huge crowd dances fervently to the live Spanish music
In the middle of the floor, the Spanish players are the life of the party
In a corner, Monica sits with Sidra, drinking and watching the festivities
large trophy sits on the table
Can you take that damn thing off the table
You mean my championship trophy
My bad
Monica sets it down in the seat next to her, puts an arm around it
Sidra shakes her head
Still a cocky bitch
Monica laughs
She downs her drink, motions to the waiter
Uno mas, por favor
The waiter nods
(cont'd) Last  heard, you were playing in Sweden
Yeah, four years ago
They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people
'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock
Then the whack club 'm on loses three games in a row and  get blamed
So they fire me
Just like that
Yup
So 've been playing with this Italian club the last three years
How's that been
It's better
Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money
(smiles) led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way  could touch the damn ball
Monica laughs as the waiter brings her drink
She tries to pay, but he just shakes his head, crosses away
(cont'd) Most of us don't win championships our first year overseas
Please,  went through the same drama as everybody else
mean, the first four months, only person  could talk to was this chick Luisa, who knew like ten words of English from watching old "Dif'rent Strokes" reruns
Swear to God,  had to tell her if she said, "What you talking bout, Willis
" one more time,  was gonna kick her ass
Sidra laughs
They watch the madness out on the dance floor
So what are these Spanish guys like
wouldn't know
What
You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything
Just not my type,  guess
Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women
They can't get enough of me
Monica smiles
You ever think about going back
Sometimes
But what's the alternative, not playing
You remember big Toni
(off Monica's nod) She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore
mean, look at us
They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here
We just played in the championship game
It doesn't get much sweeter than this
Monica takes this in
Her eyes do not reflect someone on top of the world
She takes a long drink
- '  - small, sparse, one-bedroom
Sam, Diane and the rest of the gang from "Cheers" fill the small  screen that flickers in the darkness
Their dialogue is dubbed in Spanish
Monica sits on the floor, braiding her hair
' ,   -
Feelings of loneliness threaten to swallow her whole
She looks out her window and sees her billboard, looming in the distance
She just stares
- The crowd erupts as a Laker player dunks the ball on a fast break
Laker announcers   and
Stu, this game is in the refrigerator
The door is closed, the lights are out, the butter's hard and the Jell-Oooooo's jigglin'
And here come the subs
Quincy pulls off his sweats and jogs onto the court with the rest of the subs
He is twenty-three, a man
His goatee and tired eyes make him look older
- (cont'd) (
) It's good to see these guys get a little playing time
And the fans love it
Quincy immediately gets a pass in the corner
He puts up a quick three and it banks hard off the rim
Chick and Stu
Three-pointer is off for the kid from Came out after his freshman year, now in his fifth year with the league
The son of Zeke McCall, played twelve years with the Clippers
(nods) Pretty good player
The kid's moved around quite a bit, but he's hoping to finally have a home with the Lakers
Quincy steals the ball, has nothing but open court ahead of him
(cont'd) (
) Watch out, folks, it's showtime
Quincy takes off from the hash-mark and throws down a monster jam
He swings high off the rim
Too high
His hand slips and he crashes to the floor
His knee twists at a sickening angle
The dwindling crowd gasps as Quincy clutches his left knee, writhing in pain
-  - Zeke walks down the corridor, checking room numbers
He is forty-five now
His slight paunch as become a roll
He sees Nona exiting a room, with an empty water pitcher in hand
Her hair is in locks
Nona
Nona looks over
Her eyes narrow
(cont'd) How's he doing
Not great
What's that, not great
The doctor'll be back in a minute
Nona, please
He tore his
Zeke's shoulders slump
Then he looks back at her
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that
How you been
Happy
And he won't want to see you
Nona walks over to a  standing nearby
He puts an arm around her and they move down the hall
Zeke watches for a beat, then pulls open Quincy's door, steps inside
'   - Quincy lays in the bed
His knee is bandaged and propped up by pillows
He stares out the window
Hey, son
Quincy turns, sees his father
He turns back to the window
(cont'd) Well, you made SportsCenter
What do you want
Came by to check on you
After five years
Don't remember that being my fault
Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom
Look, 'm busy
can see that
know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself
stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget
No
Good
Quincy
know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me
And now 'm paying for it, right
That what this is about
" told you so
" You want me to fuck off
Yeah
Fine, 'll fuck off, but not til  say something
Silence
Then
(cont'd) You're a better ballplayer than  ever was
But you got a lot of other things going for you
You're smart
always felt
always knew that you could do anything you wanted
You want to be a ballplayer, be a ballplayer
Just know you ain't like everybody else on that court
You ain't like  was
You got options
That's all  ever tried to show you
You're still trying to tell me what should and shouldn't do
How come you couldn't be the man you kept trying to make me
Zeke stares at his son, wishing he could satisfy him with an answer
just couldn't With nothing left to say, Zeke pulls open the door and leaves
Quincy stares at the door long after it closes
: '   - enters, carrying a bouquet of flowers
She moves past the empty bed, puts them on a table already overflowing with flowers
She pulls open the blinds and light floods the room
She crosses back out
toilet flush
Beat, then Quincy slowly hops out of the bathroom, scratching his bare ass through the opening of his gown
(
) And  thought this was gonna be awkward
Quincy whips around and is shocked to see Monica standing there, laughing
She has clearly made an effort with her appearance
Monica
He stumbles
Monica quickly goes to him, catches his arm before he falls
'm sorry
Quincy stares at her, completely thrown
It's been five years
An awkward beat
(cont'd) So, how you doing
Alright
heard you were in Spain
was
(smiling) see your peach fuzz finally grew in
Quincy rubs his goatee self-consciously
Just something 'm trying
No, it looks good
mean, it's cool
Thanks
Quincy tries to adjust his footing and flinches in pain
Shouldn't you be lying down, or
'm alright
But you can sit
'm fine
My dad said you tore your
Yup
What are the doctors saying
(shrugs) lot of things
All  know is 'll be back in six months
thought a torn  was ten to twelve
Not for Quincy McCall
forgot, "-man
" An awkward beat
So, how's pro-ball, Europe
We won the championship
Still working on being the first girl in the
Well,  tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical
Funny
never did
Kiss my ass
Monica cracks up
Quincy laughs with her
(cont'd) can't believe it's been five years
Quincy nods
Tried calling you a couple times
Oh yeah
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American
And then when Magic retired,  tried calling you again
(lying) Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine
It was always messing up
Figured it was something like that
They look at each other
The moment is building
(cont'd) So, when do you go back
Actually,  don't
What do you mean
'm tired of playing overseas
Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile
(completely thrown) rest
Yeah
Basketball just, isn't fun anymore
You know
No
He stares at her
Into her
(
) Quincy
Quincy and Monica turn, as  , black, 26 and beautiful, rushes into the room
She wears a flight attendant's uniform
She goes to Quincy, gives him a kiss
Monica reacts
'm so sorry
No one would switch flights with me
It's okay
Why are you up
Get in bed
She takes Quincy's arm, moves him to the bed
Monica watches
(cont'd) Tell me you're going to be okay
'm gonna be okay
Kyra relaxes
Then she glances over at Monica
Hello
Kyra, this is Monica
She, uh
(recognizing) Monica
You grew up together, right
Quincy's told me about you
Monica smiles awkwardly
This is Kyra
My fiance
The shock hits too quick to cover
But Monica tries
Fiance
Wow
Congratulations
Thank you
didn't know
Wow
That's great
(then) Well
should go
It means a lot that you came by
Yes, we appreciate that
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything
Thanks
Monica forces one last smile, pulls open the door and leaves
- Monica walks down the hall, shell-shocked
-  - Camille moves between the counter and the stove, whipping up a couple pecan pies
Monica enters
Hey
Hi
Need any help
can manage
Monica nods and moves to the barstool
(cont'd) Your sister's bringing the baby over
You should try to be here
Yeah
Can't wait to see him (she falls silent, then) just saw Quincy
How is he
Engaged
To that stewardess
Yeah, you met her
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago
He could do a lot better if you ask me
Maybe she is
Camille looks up, studies Monica for a moment
thought you were over him
Monica shrugs
So what do  do
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift
(disgusted) Whatever
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask
asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy
Don't curse
There you go
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up
To go have sex with him
'm not going to do that
Yes,  believe thinking of other people is important and yes 'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot
If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad
Monica stares at her mother
There's no going back
So that's why we can't get along
Because 'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot
You're the one always turning your nose up at me
No  don't
Child, please
Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything  had to say
wasn't Lena
didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things  knew could help you
Because you're pushing me to be something 'm not
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume
Monica is busted
It takes her a moment to come back
'm angry because  want a mother, not Martha Stewart
Oh, yes
The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife
That's not it
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because  know
Monica stares at her mother
remember when  was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal
All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table
And  guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas
And you didn't say anything
You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge
don't remember that
do
You never stood up for yourself
Ever
If  was ashamed, it was because of that
That's ridiculous
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers
Camille's humiliation is immediate and she cuts off Monica with a
Camille curses herself for losing it
Dammitt, Monica
Monica is stunned, hurt
'm sorry
Camille stares at her daughter, devastated
Is that really all you think of me
Monica can't answer
(cont'd) When  married your father, all  wanted was a nice house with a big kitchen so could start my catering business
And then  got pregnant with Lena, and then got pregnant with you
And  put it out of my mind because that's what you did
Monica stares at her mother
(cont'd) But you want to know what day  remember
In high school, you getting ready for the Spring Dance
put my pearls around your neck, told you you were beautiful and you looked like you were going to cry
That day  was happy  didn't have a catering business to run off to
My family had three meals a day, had someone to pick up after them, and when my daughters went to a dance,  helped them get ready
That's what  came to care about
(softly) That's all you cared about
must have played in a thousand games and  can only remember you being to two
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff
It never mattered one way or the other if  went to your games
It mattered, Mom
Camille looks at her daughter and is struck by the need in her eyes
Monica moves off the barstool and leaves
- '  - The room looks exactly the same
Trophies, medals, plaques
Basketball posters and her "strong women" wall
Monica sits on her bed, staring up at a photo of her and Quincy, tacked up to her bulletin board, amid other photos of her childhood
, Monica slowly rises, starts taking her posters down
- Quincy sits on a leg extension machine, with his left leg tucked under the padded bar
stands behind him
Sweat and pain coat Quincy's face and scarred knee as he slowly lifts the light weight again, and again, and again
- long line of customers shift impatiently during the noon- time rush
Monica sits with a   at the "New Accounts" desk, learning the ropes
Her hair is done, she wears a simple dress
Behind her, hanging on the wall, are three framed photos of the bank presidents
, - '  - Monica stands in her room, staring out at Quincy's window
She watches as Quincy and Kyra pack up some of Quincy's stuff
Quincy tries to take his basketball globe light
She laughs, "Hell no
" - '  - Camille enters, moves to Monica's garbage can, dumps the contents into her larger bag
Suddenly, she stops
She reaches into the garbage and pulls out a crumpled picture
Camille smooths it
It is the photo of Monica and Quincy at eighteen, wrestling over a basketball
, '
She sits down on Monica's bed, still staring
- In the empty gym, Quincy jogs up and down the court
He is still tentative on his knee, but he keeps jogging
And then, slowly, the determination melts from his face
His jog turns into a walk, and then he just
stops
- '  - Quincy stands in the middle of his room, taking in his life
Old, worn basketball posters still line the walls
Trophies and awards
memorabilia
His basketball globe light
He walks to his window, looks out at Monica's window
Her room is dark
: '  -  - Quincy tilts his face up to the shower head and rinses the soap from his face
He hears the bathroom door open
He shuts off the water and opens the curtain
Kyra sits on the toilet, taking a pee
Quincy slams the curtain closed
Damn, girl
What
don't wanna see that
Get used to it, babe
She flushes
Quincy steps out, grabs a towel
long scar runs across his knee cap
Brother's gonna have to start locking doors
Kyra laughs as she buttons up her flight attendant's uniform
They cross into: '  -  - Kyra packs up a suitcase
So how long is this trip
Four days
Quincy nods
(cont'd) So are you going to be the kind of husband who won't let his wife work
Nah
(playfully) Why not
You might be the only one with a job
Baby, don't talk like that
Your rehab's going well
You'll be back before you know it
Sometimes  wonder if it's worth it
Busting my ass, for what
To do what you love
don't know sometimes
You're just scared
know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be
believe in you
You just have to get back on the court
Like you'd get back on a horse
(beat) horse
Don't make fun of me when 'm being wonderful and supportive
(then) You belong on the court
Just like belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on
She smiles, gives him a kiss, moves back to her packing
Off Quincy: - Monica sits at her desk in a blouse and skirt, punching numbers into the computer
man sits down in the chair opposite her
Monica glances up
It's her father
Hey, munchkin
Dad
What are you doing here
was upstairs for a meeting
've been hearing good things about you
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter
So how's the job going
Monica forces a smile
You know
Nathan looks at her, nods
think  know what the problem is
He pulls a    from a plastic shopping bag
Monica smiles
He attaches it to her garbage can
(cont'd) There
He shoots an ugly, imaginary shot
She laughs
You shoot like a girl
'll take that as a compliment
He gives her a smile, and exits
Monica looks at the hoop, then crumples a piece of paper
(whispering) And she gets the steal
Monica goes one- on-one against Jordan, she stops, pops
Monica shoots
The paper drops through the net
(cont'd) (still whispering) It's good
It's good
She glances up, notices a few patrons watching her
Monica quickly composes herself and goes back to her work
- Monica exits her car, after a long day at work
She wears very low heels
But she still stumbles
She curses, then hears a laugh
She looks up - Quincy sits on the grassy hill above her house
remember when your mom had to beat you into a dress
Monica smiles
You visiting
(nods) Kyra's gone for a couple days
Figured 'd keep Mom company
Who's this guy  always see her around
Darryl
He's alright, kinda corny
So
how's the knee
Getting there
Strong enough to get you down the aisle
Yeah
Two weeks
(then) didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you
That's okay
'm probably, you know, busy
Quincy nods
Awkward beat
Can  ask you something
Monica looks at him
(cont'd) You never told me why ball isn't fun anymore
It just isn't
Because 'm kinda feeling that way, too
You had a rough couple years, that's all
That a nice way of saying  rode the bench
And you tore up your knee
Rehab is tough
Nah
haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months
Maybe  miss some of the attention, but besides that
You're serious
Seems like  needed a ball when  was trying to be like my pops
or trying to be better than him
Now,  kinda think need to try something else
Like what
Maybe go back to school
Wow
Monica stares at him, seeing a man in the boy she grew up with
Quincy looks away, self-conscious
mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet
(then) She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking
It's a trip, you know
When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way
So why'd you give up ball
Why do you keep asking me that
Cause  don't get it
Something was just missing
What
Monica is too hurt, too scared to tell him the truth
It doesn't matter, alright
Just leave it alone
Find
Monica turns, crosses to her house
She stumbles on her heels, kicks them off in frustration, and exits inside
Quincy walks back to his curb
Camille watches from the kitchen window : -  - Lena sits next to Camille
Her one year old son,
, sits on the ground at her feet
Monica sits quietly nearby, watching
So you're still breast-feeding
The doctor said it was okay
Anyway, 'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat
She quickly looks over at Monica
(cont'd) Shut up
Monica gives her a small smile
Camille looks down at
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold
He's fine
(warning) Okay
Lena sighs, rolls her eyes
She picks up her son
Come on,
Grandma says it's too cold
She exits inside
Camille makes a face
God
"Grandma
" Monica smiles
And then silence
There is still so much distance between them, so many misunderstanding
Camille stares at her daughter
And then
(cont'd) You know, 'd probably be a lot more "prissy" in the situation than you'd like, but the thing  always admired that drove me crazy, was the fight you had in you
What are you talking about
When  said Quincy could do better,  was thinking about you
Monica stares at her mom
Camille stands and leaves
- '  - Monica lies in her bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to sleep
Her mind races with thoughts of her past, her choices, her future
Suddenly, she climbs out of bed
She wears a tank-top and pajama bottoms
She crosses to her window, pulls it open and climbs out
- Monica drops down
She moves to Quincy's window and knocks quietly
Beat, then Quincy appears
Bare-chested and in a pair of shorts
He looks at her, then pulls open the window
(half-asleep) What's going on
We need to talk
Quincy just looks at her
(cont'd) Please
Hold on
Quincy disappears for a moment, then returns, pulling on a - shirt
He climbs out of his window, drops to the ground
Quincy looks at her
You asked me what was missing
What
From basketball
you woke me up to tell me that
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing
Quincy stares at her
(cont'd) What 'm trying to say is -- heard enough
What 'm trying to say is, 've loved you since  was eleven and the shit won't go away
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this
know,  probably should have said it two weeks ago
Quincy doesn't even crack a smile
In fact, he glares
You haven't changed
You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass
Well, guess what, it doesn't
Then why are you so upset
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married
Better late than never, right
Wrong
Quincy starts back toward the window
'll play you
What
One game
One-on-one
For what
Your heart
Quincy looks at her in disbelief, then laughs at the absurdity
You're out of your mind
So you're gonna bitch up
What's that supposed to be, psychology
know why you broke up with me in college
And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what  did was, too
So if you forgive me, 'll forgive you
Monica, after that stuff with my dad, couldn't trust anybody, okay
mean, was lost
So you are forgiven
But that was five years ago
moved on
Monica moves past him, reaches through his window
She drops back down, holding his basketball
Prove it
She throws him the ball
What will this prove
You once said the reason  beat you was because you wanted me to
So
So, if  win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you
And what happens when you lose
If  lose, 'll buy you a wedding present
Quincy stares at her
-  - Monica stands opposite Quincy
Both are suited up in basketball gear
They stare at each other, ready to go to war
Monica tosses him the ball
Check
Quincy tosses the ball back
Monica drives
Quincy's knee is maybe at sixty percent and he can't keep up
She scores easily
She walks to the top of the driveway, tosses him the ball
(cont'd) One, zip
Check
Quincy rubs his scarred knee, then passes it back
The game continues
Monica owns the first five points easily by exploiting Quincy's injury
Monica drives for another lay-up
Quincy suddenly lets go of his fear, leaps and swats her shot
He grabs the rebound and lays it up
He nods intensely, as he grabs the ball and walks back to the top of the key
One, five
Check
The game continues and now Quincy has the upper-hand, using his size and strength
He scores seven straight points
The score stays close
It is a sexually-charged battle of wills -- Quincy pulls off his sweat-soaked shirt
Their bodies collide as they wrestle for the ball
Monica yanks off her jersey in frustration
Her ass bumps into his hips as she backs him in
Her hands slide across his chest as she guards him
Finally, the score hits nine, nine
Monica slowly walks to the top of the key
Nine, up
Point
She tosses Quincy the ball
(cont'd) Check
Quincy tosses the ball back, drops low on defense
Monica fakes an outside shot and Quincy bites
Monica drives around him
- - Monica can't believe it
Quincy grabs the loose ball and clears it
He stares at Monica as he dribbles in front of her
She stares back
He breaks for the basket
Monica stays with him
He goes up
Monica jumps, desperately tries to block his shot
Quincy dunks on her, knocking her to the ground
He lets go of the rim, and tumbles to the ground also
Silence
Quincy stares at her
Monica looks back
Then: (pointed) All's fair in love and basketball, right
Monica struggles to fight back her tears as she picks herself up
She slowly walks back toward her house
And then: (cont'd) Hey
Monica slowly stops, turns
(cont'd) Double or nothing
Monica stares at him, wonders if she heard right
Quincy limps to his feet, picks up the ball and holds it out to her
Monica slowly walks back to him
They stare at each other
No more egos, no more bullshit
Just love
In the moonlight, on the blacktop, they kiss
: - Music is blasting, banners are waving, crowd is screaming
Magic Johnson sits in a floor seat, watching the game interviews him
So, Magic, are you contemplating another comeback
(laughs) No more comebacks
Tonight 'm just enjoying being a spectator
Behind him, in a second row seat, a     sits in a lap, bouncing, watching feet and legs ballin' on the court
Quincy leans down, gives the little girl a kiss, then looks out at the court
It's the Los Angeles Sparks and the New York Liberty
The
On the court, the women line up for a free-throw
Let's go, McCall
Monica, sporting a uniform with Wright-McCall on the back and the number thirty-two, looks over
Quincy takes their daughter's hand and waves it
(cont'd) Go Mommy
Monica smiles back, then steps to the line
The referee tosses her the ball
Monica stares at the basket, then bounces the ball twice, licks her lips and shoots
