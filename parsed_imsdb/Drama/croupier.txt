The  place their bets , nine men, three women
The  of the men, all ages, intense, hopeful, fearful
Which of them is
' Now he had become the still centre of that spinning wheel of misfortune
' hand spins the wheel
The ball is thrown against the spin
Hands, faces, chips
' The world turned round him
leaving him miraculously untouched The little white ball circles the spinning wheel
The ' faces as the ball starts to bounce
All eyes are on the bouncing ball
' The croupier had reached his goal
He no longer heard the sound of the ball
The back of the ' hand, his slicked-back short hair, razor cut
The  moves around to his face
' To begin with he was Jack Manfred
whistling sound takes Jack back in time
'  - is walking through a maze of open-plan partitioned offices
He ls casually but fashionably dressed, hair dyed blond long, a nervous elegance about him, almost unrecognisable from the croupier's face
He searches for the right office
He finds it
The name on the open is
'  - , a public schoolboy in his late twenties comes forward and vigorously shakes ' hand
Jacketless, he wears yellow braces
Next to his tidy desk is a slot machine
Take a pew, Jack
You look well
What's it been, two years since we broke bread
has an upper-class accent, but an acquired street manner
Three years, two months
March '93
What a memory you've got
Maths always was your strong suit
What happened to the moaning Lisa
She went back to South Africa
(digging) Did she
(smiles) You were pretty thick at one time
We all played the field
frowns at a memory, an implication
' mobile phone buzzes
He picks up
Hi-ya
'll call you back
(to Jack) Now then
(suddenly) want a job, Giles
(cautiously) All right
As what
was thinking perhaps  could be a reader
You employ readers, don't you
We do
For unsolicited manuscripts
We pay twenty pounds a manuscript
You might get two, maybe three in a week
Can you live on sixty pounds
opens a pack of Gitanes
Sorry
This is a no-smoking office, Jack
You've written a book, haven't you
didn't read it myself, but -- puts her head into the office
Give me ten minutes, Fiona
puts a fax on ' desk, smiles at , and goes
Fiona used to read for me
He winks at
Let me tell you about our operation
We like personality authors
People the public recognises
Celebrity's what sells books
We can always find someone to do the writing
First, we need the face
Then the concept
(he is reading the fax) Right now 'm looking for a soccer novel
Something where a tycoon buys a lousy team and takes it to the top
Seven figure transfer fees
Corruption all down the line
Violence on and off the pitch
Steroids
Got any concepts
It could be a thug story
tell you what
Why don't you think about it
couple of pages
The pitch
Steroids
Got any concepts
It could be a thug story
tell you what
Why don't you think about it
couple of pages
(smiles) With plenty of sex, of course
pops a coin into the slot machine, pulls the handle, waits
Interesting, Giles
will think about it
The machine spits out several coins
takes them
Let me give you three words of advice, Jack
Don't give up
Stick with it
Who persists wins
That's my motto
Write, write, write
nods, extends his hand
firm handshake
' Jack had three words for, Giles
Go fuck yourself
Meeting over
smiles goodbye, pockets his slot machine winnings
'   -   - The untidy evidence
To the accompaniment of the music, a discordant version, three dog-eared copies of 'The Invention Of The Wheel',  Novel by
Worn furniture pile of literary magazines
Two elegantly arranged vases of flowers
Women's fashion magazines
Books everywhere, including 'Scarne on Gambling', 'The Education of  Poker Player', 'Delta of Venus' and other books by Anais Nin woman's dress, back from the cleaners
framed etching of Cape Town, South Africa, in the eighteenth century
Finally
Beneath the iron barred window, with a view of the iron steps down from the street,  sits at the dining table
In front of him is a word processor
He toys with a glass of vodka, smoking a Gitane, and leafing through a soccer fan magazine
He starts to touch-type, looking at the screen, not the keyboard
Words appear, letter by letter
He pauses to drink
- , face unseen, steps into a phone booth
: his hands
It is impossible to tell where he is
He opens his pocket book, addresses, diary etc
, and searches through for something
- He finds what he's looking for: a small photograph, among others of girls, of a ten year-old boy in school uniform
On the back are three phone numbers, two of them crossed out
The  lifts the receiver, inserts coins
He starts to press the numbers
There are - of his finger pressing the sequence of digits, each one , longer than the one before, until
'   - The phone rings
looks to the answering machine, waits for the voice
' Jacko, if you're there, pick up want to talk to you
It's important
hesitates, then picks up
Dad, 'm here
- The  is handsome, tanned, 50ish, white shirt, dark tie
He is ' father
How's it going
The subsequent conversation is  between and
Great
Found a job
No
Well 've got something for you
In London,  mean
've been chatting to some friends
Do you know the Golden Lion casino
It's in Bayswater,  believe
They're looking for a dealer, a croupier
pulls out a cigarette - a Gitanes
That's not what  want to do, dad
stubs his cigarette out
(lighting his cigarette) Don't be stubborn
The pay won't be grand, but it's regular
That's what you need, isn't it
know you don't like taking my advice
(drinks) It's not that
've set this up for you
Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager
don't know him personally, but 've spoken to his boss
Don't say no, Jacko
Give yourself a break
reaches for a cigarette
All right, 'll think about it
won't
Goodbye, dad
Just do it
You've got the knack, you've got the personality, you got that from me
lights up
You understand the punters
Think about it, you can write during the day and sleep knowing the bills are paid
As he speaks, he watches passing
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth
Have you written that name down
Reynolds, at the Golden Lion
(exhales) (exhales) All right, dad
Yes, 'll call him
is not enthusiastic, but he scribbles the name down on a pad
So how are you doing, dad
Great
've just started a new company
Solid financing
It's good
(pause) love you Jacko, you know that Yes,  know that
Don't let yourself down
won't
Goodbye, dad
hangs up
- Stubbing out his cigarette,
leaves the booth
We now see where he is
beach bar in South Africa
He walks to the bar and
goes behind it, slipping on his barman's jacket
in dark mirror glasses and a bathing suit is waiting
(smiles) Sorry to keep you
What'll you have
'   - , disturbed by the call, pours himself a vodka
He looks at what he's written: '
' ' Jack knew something was wrong
He'd forgotten Giles' advice
Giles said three words
inserts a word in the title
It now reads: ' '
drinks
After a moment
' '  No
Jack knew it still wasn't quite right
He types: '  '
Then, on reflection, deletes ' '
Through the iron bars  watches feet pass on the street above
drunk drops a beer can over
The can falls in   but the clatter is loud
' want to fuck the whole world over
- Reception area
The  turns around the fake glitz of the interior: brass, drapes, polished wood, mirrors, and moves towards the front door
' Welcome back Jack
to the house of addiction
The door opens
Against a blaze of street daylight, ' silhouette appears
The  moves forward to greet him
removes his wristwatch
- '  - shakes hands with  , a cold man in his late forties, dead behind the eyes
David Reynolds, 'm the Manager here
Sit down, John
Jack
examines a file in front of him
You've been recommended by the management here
They know your father
He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he
(frowns) Has he
In any case,  understand you've had some previous experience
in South Africa
(Jack nods) You'll find the rules a little different here
Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you
No
opens the door
He lets  go on ahead
Where did you go to school
(surpised) was at Beadles
don't think  know that one
Private,  suppose
-  - The full overhead lights give the casino an exposed, tacky appearance, devoid of mystery or glamour
The place has roulette tables and blackjack counters
It is deserted except for several  , vacuuming, emptying ashtrays
walks with , talking
There are three types of casino in the
High volume
Small faction
And
That's middle of the road
Us
Do you have a Salon Prive
We tried
But there wasn't enough business
The punters like company
goes to one of the tables with
Let's see you handle the chips
He slides open a box and tips 200 chips of varying denominations onto the table
have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond
We check every four days
Why four
And not three or five
(shrugs) It's the procedure here
Now sort the chips
starts to stack the chips in piles from a hundred pounds to five
watches
' fingers work fast
In a matter of moments he has the lot stacked
Stacks of 20
Rows of 5
Any exceptions
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours
Give me 365
He presses a stopwatch in his hand
quickly sets out four neat piles, three of 100, one of 65
All four piles are in denominations of ten and five
Very good
Now take these colours
He throws a pile of blue and white chips on the table
The blue are 10, the white are 5
want 780, but  want 500 in denominations of 25
nods and gets to work
His fingers make Reynolds's ticking watch seem slow
(impressed) Very good
- Now at a roulette table,  has prepared the bets for fifteen punters
It's a set-up to test Jack's style and concentration
gives  the white ball
You use two alternating, don't you
We do
(hands him a second ball) (hesitates) Where's the magnet
They've been tested
spins the wheel, throws the ball against the turn
No more bets
As the ball begins to bounce, but before it stops, turns to a   who's emptying some ashtrays nearby
Could you stop that for a minute
The  looks up, surprised
watches, then catches sight of  surreptitiously moving a chip onto the third line
'm sorry, sir, 've called no more bets
reaches across, takes the chip and puts it on the wood Grounding the wheel
nods approvingly
The ball stops
23 Red
Odd
He now rakes away the losers' chips and pays out the smallest first, before getting to the major pay-out on 23
It's all very efficient and speedy
is increasingly impressed
Haven't you forgotten something
(thinks) don't think so
Wipe your hands
takes out a handkerchief
Not with your own cloth
Besides, your pockets will be stitched
What happens if  want to sneeze
You won't
Not without permission
laughs
smiles
They like each other
Fine
Now let's move on
- blackjack table
is turning cards over for five punters in an arc
is moving from one chair to the next playing each of the five hands
How many aces are left
Five
make it six
Five
looks down at the table
What makes you so sure
It's a rule
Always stand by your first count
The odds are you're right
Good call
pulls out the shoe
You want me to check
(irritably) said good call
walks away
puts the shoe back
He takes his watch out of his pocket, glances at it
' It had taken him 45 minutes, but Jack now had Mr Reynolds's number
The man couldn't count
-  - Back in the office  is talking to
On ' desk is a framed photograph of his suburban wife and two kids
Let me just run through a few things
As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere
We'll need your picture
What for
For the database
It can be accessed by every casino in the country
We have the same system for punters
don't gamble
Ever
don't gamble, Mr Reynolds
doesn't pursue it
Next point
Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged
Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check
This isn't South Africa
We'd know, because someone would report it
Believe me, someone always does
Does know
Or does report
What would happen if  knew something like that and didn't report it
We'd know
There are no secrets in this casino
You'd be punished
How
First offence: verbal warning
Second offence: written warning
That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board
My discretion
Third offence: you're sacked on the spot
You'd never work in a casino in this country again
There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino
If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him
Or her
You're not married, are you
shakes his head Girlfriend
Yes
She's not in the gaming business is she
No
- "' " - Centre over the casino
crosses the room, looking down through a glass floor at the empty casino below
walks over to a series of twenty or more banked  monitors with many Video 8 tape decks
This is our Crow's Nest
'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again
Very impressive
We have tapes in here that go back six months
Let me show you something
presses a button
Together they look at a monitor which shows an overlook of a roulette table where a  is cheating
freezes the frame
See that
That was six weeks ago
The dealer missed it
The guy up here missed it, but  watch these tapes after hours
Nothing gets by me
Now the lady's in jail
It's easier to take ten million pounds from a bank than take one penny from this casino
- '  - Again in the office
extends his hand
shakes it
You can start Monday week
Fine
That hair will have to go
Fine
Pause
Are you planning to make a career in casino work
' And end up like you
just want the job
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here
' Mr Reynolds was right
It was true
Jack was up above the world
An artist, living in the clouds
Looking down
of the office,  and
The phone rings
Excuse me
picks up and listens
The  descends
can't talk about this now
no, 'm with somebody
They can wait
'll be home at the usual time
all right, 'll call you back in an hour
(hangs up) Don't ever get married, Jack
Casino work doesn't mix with house and garden
Any questions
The  reaches a   on , looking up
Yes
What's the salary
-  - The street lamps have come on
is at the wheel of a Sixties Austin-Healey
' The casino paid its staff monthly in arrears
He would have to wait six weeks for his first cheque
He needed money now
- Under a canopy of coloured lights    is walking round jack's car, examining it
(fake American accent) What kind of deal you looking to
What's the Blue Book price
That's not relevant
An old car like this, it depends on the condition
' The car was a gift from Jack's father
That's to say, Jack Senior had given it to him before the bailiffs arrived
The  picks at the cracked leather seats, the protruding stuffing, the chipped dashboard, the rust
This ain't exactly what you'd call mint
He bends down and looks underneath the car
How about fifteen hundred
How about five hundred
What
How about we split the diff
Seven-fifty
Is that your idea of arithmetic
'm not a mathematician
'm in business
Eight-fifty
Seven-fifty
The  looks at
stares back
It's as if one is waiting for the other to blink first
Neither blinks
' He suddenly wanted to be rid of it
'Hang on tightly, let go lightly'
It was a saying Jack remembered
leans into the open car and takes out his hat and cigarettes
He has accepted the offer
The music begins
- And continues
stands, with an unlit cigarette, in a crowded moving train
He looks at the faces,  and He sees  reading books
He looks at the : Romantic fiction, Classics, Business Management, Thrillers, Self-Help, Cooking
' Jack imagined people reading his book
One day he would enter their heads, play with their imaginations, test their feelings
- crosses the road
He turns down a side street where Victorian houses have been converted into flats
There are scores of 'For Sale' and 'To Let' signs down the street
' He would tell them you have to make a choice in life
Be a gambler or a croupier
And then live with your decision come what may
He goes down into a basement, closing the iron gate behind him
'   - unlocks the door, goes in, to the accompaniment of street sounds and a dog barking
' Marion saw life differently
She was a romantic
And thought he was too
'  - Radio music is playing from another room
An orchestral version of 'Try a Little Tenderness'
comes in, hangs his hat up, looks around
He sees a neatly arranged vase of flowers that wasn't there before
He goes to the bedroom
- sees on the bed, an open box and a carrier bag from a designer department store
Among the white tissue paper is a simple black silk dress and lace-decorated black underwear
He smiles and picks up the knickers
He goes to the open bathroom door, from which comes the music
- radio plays beside the bath
The water is draining away
, a red-haired woman in her mid-thirties, wearing a bathrobe with the name  on it is examining the lines on her neck in the half-steamed bathroom mirror
She sees , turns with a smile
holds up the black knickers
couldn't resist them
You mean  won't resist them
goes to her
No, no
'm not ready for you
There's some vodka in the freezer
You want me drunk
(laughs) won't be that long
She pushes him gently with the flat of her palms towards the door
- comes back into the bedroom
pushes the bathroom door, not quite closed
tosses the knickers onto the bed
- takes the vodka bottle out of the freezer, pours himself a glass
He sees two bottles of wine opened, food neatly prepared, ready to cook, an open cook book
He pours a glass of wine
- sits drinking his vodka
Looking up through the barred window he sees women's legs passing on the street above
On the desk beside the computer is the glass of wine
materialises in the door to the bedroom
She is made up, wearing the black dress and high-heeled black shoes, a black scarf around her neck
takes the glass of wine and gives it to her
You really are a beautiful woman
(pleased) It's not just inner beauty, is it
Turn around
whirls to show off her dress
You're all  desire
He reaches for an envelope on the desk
He gives it to her
opens it
There are several fifty pound notes inside
Where did you get it
sold the car
You shouldn't have done that know what it meant to you
owe you for the rent
It's only a car
can get another
Take it back
Till you sell your book
Come on, Marion
Let's face the truth
Nobody's going to publish it
Of course they will
You just have to be patient
'm betting on you
She raises the glass of wine, drinks
'm not much of a bet
He drains his glass
You are to me
She takes her scarf, puts it round his neck, pulls him seductively towards the bedroom door
Come into my world
She winds the black scarf across his face, covering his eyes
(whispering) You're my prisoner
've got something to tell you
want to hear it
've got a job
(startled) What job
pulls the scarf from his eyes
She wants to look at him
In a casino
As a croupier dealer
How did you land that
It came my way
450 a week
(sits up) 450
What did you do, just walked in and said  want to be a croupier
Don't you need training
had training
In the Republic
You were a croupier there
You never told me that
thought you just knew some gamblers
start Monday week
From the street comes the whining sound of a car alarm
450 a week
've never earned that in my life
You're an enigma, you are
fucking enigma
' Not an enigma, just a contradiction
looks deeply into his eyes
You sold the car
You got a job
What's the third thing
Tell me
There's no third thing
Don't be superstitious
love you Jack, you know that
' And he half-loved Marion
And she knew that too
Outside, the car alarm stops
takes ' head in his hands
She reaches for one of them, examines it
Are you trying to read my palm
You've got such beautiful hands
' The hands of a conjuror, a woman had told him once
Or a card sharp
Their hands interlock
She leads him into the bedroom
- ' hands are being worked on by a woman
What line of work are you in
'm an undertaker
Really
The  stops for a moment, looks at him with curiosity
- is cutting ' hair
He goes up ' neck with electric clippers
Jack's hair is now black
Do you work round here
My office is in Shanghai
(surprised) What do you do
'm an arms dealer
The  stops for a moment, nonplussed
-   - In front of the mirror  buttons a white shirt and skillfully ties a black bow tie
His short hair is lacquered back
He reaches down for his black jacket
puts it on
The transformation is complete
As he scrubs his nails,  sees a  in the mirror
She is changing her clothes
She pulls off her Indian cotton dress
She's wearing pants but no bra
Quite unselfconsciously, not looking Jack's way, she dresses in her casino clothes
dries his hands
He turns
The  smiles at him
'm Bella
Jack Manfred
Hi, Jack
(fits herself into the uplift bra) Welcome to the cesspit
Is it that bad
(starts to do up her top) How do  look
' Like trouble, Bella
You look fine
The punters love it
Tits in uniform
She laughs
-   - appears at the head of the table
The  look at him, not recognising him
' The usual bunch
They didn't know Jack, but he knew them
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
fat   addresses
Where's the other fellow
Where's Geoff
He doesn't work here any more
Well, let's hope you know your job
-  trying to look as young as possible throws 100 pounds in cash to
Tens, please
She turns to the  next to her, who looks very similar
2 Perhaps this man will bring us luck
The  has sensed her friend's interest in
She's jealous
(to Jack) What's that aftershave you're wearing
' Never converse with the punters
It slows things down
Speed is volume, and volume is profit for the casino
Aim at twenty spins an hour
pretends he hasn't heard the question
In the background  is watching as  spins the wheel
Last bets, please

She has 50 casino chips of 100 denominations in front of her

Black 10 comes up
takes the red loss and moves it across the table to the black win
The  picks up the 5,000 without a reaction and leaves the table
notices that she goes straight to the cashier's desk
clears the chips away, starts to pay out
-  on 's right speaks to him: You're new here
You'll get used to Madame Claude
She comes in once or twice a week and does that
nods
' He knew the scam
Come in with five grand cash
No questions asked
Launder it by getting a casino cheque when you cash in
Jack wondered why Mr Reynolds permitted it
After all there's was no profit in it for the casino
Or was there
-   - Later
different set of
The wheel spins sits at the table
He doesn't attempt to bet
He looks around to see a  in his late 20's waiting to replace at the wheel
This is
He gives  a curious complicitous smile

Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen
'm going to hand you over now to my colleague
Goodnight

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen

(quietly) Good work, Jack
You handled yourself well
At the table,  glances at the  man

He has a 10 and a 5 exposed for the house

The   buys a card for 21
turns over an ace for the house
He twists again
It's a 5 - making 21
The two losing  groan
The   is paid evens for equalling the house
One of the  who's gone bust gets up, having lost all his chips, and leaves
' Suddenly a delayed wave of elation came over him
- Across the casino an Oriental man,  , is walking towards the table with
Behind him is a 6 foot 5 bulging

He hands her a 50 note
Thank you, sir
Enjoy your game
' 50 for a diet Coke
Waitresses were the true winners in the casino
They were the only members of staff allowed to accept tips
On a good night they could get between 200 and 300
The  goes
The other  at the table look at , wondering who he is
- walks with  across the casino
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella
Does he win
(smiles) He's a good customer
' good customer is a consistent loser
Was that what Mr Reynolds meant

The young croupier comes up to him
Where do you live, Jack
Over the river
Have you got transport

So how do you feel, your first night

She draws the curtain back
Daylight illuminates the old etching of Cape Town

She gives ten 50 notes
In 20s, please
He slots the cash into the "bank" beneath the table, then counts out 500 in 20 chips
He slides the chips towards her, looks at her
She smiles
There are ten other  at the roulette table

He comes over
The  is getting angry

Now look here, you

That Greek guy who won at the end
You paid him out in 25s not 20s

What are you, a cop
If  see you do it again, 'll report it

Because if a supervisor knew 'd seen you and  hadn't reported it, 'd lose my job as well
And can't afford that
So it's Mr Clean
Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent
The casino is nothing but legal theft
And that's
It's the system
Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it
We earn our money

And the girls
Just girls
What are you drinking
Vodka

You're a store detective
Are you drunk
Probably
This fucking job's getting to you
You haven't written a fucking word since you started
Do you have to swear all the time

She sees He doesn't see her
Thinking of going back

He doesn't recognise her for a moment
Then
Oh hello
(smiling) You know what
'd like to buy you a drink
It's against the rules

It's just that you're not like the others

conceals his surprise, a hint of nervousness
(formally) Good evening
nods impassively
' Jack knew this was no coincidence
Why had she come
The  look at the glamorous woman

Coloured lanterns hang round in the night
Distant laughter
How's it going, Jacko
between  and
Fine
took the job
Good for you
was wondering what happened
tried to call you, dad, but they said your line was disconnected
(jovially) Ah yes,  moved house
Needed a bigger place
How's that book of yours coming along
In the sitting room  looks towards  in the bedroom

It's good to have the job to fall back on, isn't it

Goodbye dad

Why not
don't like it at all
You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler
He was so romantic
He was a loser
This guy's a croupier
He can't lose
People have shat on him all his life
Now he's in control
He's a winner
Is that your idea of a winner
He doesn't give a shit about anyone
He uses people and -- (interrupting) -- It's because of the sex, isn't it
You don't like the sex in it
don't give a fuck about the sex
Most men'll fuck a lamppost
He's just a miserable zombie
Is that the way you feel now
Is that what's happened to you
Marion
It's a book
Oh really
Then why is he called Jake
Why don't you come clean and call him Jack
(softens) There's no hope in it
It's the truth
Without hope there's no point to anything
Now wait a minute
What's so hopeful about your job
Spending the day catching poor people stealing
You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it
At least in the casino everybody gets caught
Rich or poor, the odds are the same
It's all relative
Crap
It's not relative
It's unfair
Like your casino
It's designed unfair
And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it
sees  is getting really angry
He crosses the room, Pointedly takes ' handbag, opens it, takes out a National Lottery card and receipt
The doorbell rings
(coldly) You're just like all those other dummies out there
Fourteen and a half million to one
Is that your idea of hope
The doorbell rings again
The door, Jack
Leave it
No
Answer it
hands her the lottery card and goes to the door, opens it

Looking forward

How did you hurt your hand
Just an accident
Nothing
Turn left ahead
The car turns into a lane
Jani, there's something  want to say
Before we get there
don't know what the sleeping arrangements are
Giles probably expects us to share a room
That's fine

There are three cars parked outside the entrance
The Honda stops next to them

She takes off her dark glasses
Her right eye is bruised
There's no point pretending it was an accident
had a fight with someone, that's all
In the distance there is the sound of a tennis ball being struck

Everybody's wearing sweaters

On the other side, two girls, from Giles' office, and , Gordon's girlfriend

On court, Jani delivers a winning overhead smash

They come off the court

His girlfriend notices

How boring for you

She pointedly kisses him on the cheek

He sits down, picks up the cards
You sure you know how
takes the pack of cards, splits it expertly into two, shuffles by pressing the two halves together open-palmed
There is a rattling noise as the cards fold mechanically into one another, leaving the pack as if it hadn't been shuffled
and  are fascinated
Do that again
gives the cards to his right,  cuts them
Another immaculate professional shuffle, and out come the cards from ' right hand, flicking across the table
As the cards land, they fall exactly next to one another in front of each player
That's sexy
At the end of the deal, five players are looking at a neat fan of five cards before them
Don't they look pretty
They all pick up their cards
(frowns) There's nothing pretty about this hand
You're not supposed to talk, Giles
He's probably lying
He does that

No stripping

Before each player calls we hear Jack's voice
In the end he correctly predicts their call
Is it telepathy

Jack had decided to see her
The challenge was essential
He comes up to a hotel called 'Journey's End'

She looks unslept
Come in
She glances up and down the passage

Is it yes
Yes

Reflected in a mirror, she opens her bag and takes out an envelope, gives it to

Well, life's not fair
We know that
It's all relative

Do you
Yes
The date's not set yet

She puts an arm around him
' There was a part of Jani he really liked
He turns and leaves the room
-  - comes out of the hotel, walks up the street
' Question: Was he gambling, taking Jani's money
Answer: No
Because he wasn't betting with his own money
He was being paid in advance for a service
- At the roulette table  spins the wheel, throws the ball
' In reality there were two clear elements of risk in this exchange
One: the possibility the cash was counterfeit
Two: the possibility Jani or her creditors would want the money back if the plan failed

He fingers his last 2 chips
He reaches for a number, hesitates
sees that the 's hand is shaking
' To begin with he put the odds at 2 against

He checked a random selection of bills at a bank
They were all good
Across the table a well-dressed   in her fifties is sitting next to a  , a gigolo type, the top three buttons of his shirt undone
She too hesitates with her bet, looks down at her card, marked with the last thirty turns
' So now his odds were decidedly better
He put them at 8 to 1
The fact that the notes were good gave him one less negative
2 minus 1
At the same time mathematically he had one more positive
7 plus 1
The  looks up at the
She hands him the chip
Bring me some luck
The   smiles
Takes the chip and puts it on 21
The -  puts his chips on 8 and 11
He prays silently
- The roulette table
The ball is bouncing in and out of numbers
No more bets
The -  closes his eyes
The  puts her hand on the  ' arm
' Next stage
He had to be secure at 8 to 1 against having to give the money back, so he wouldn't spend it
If after one month no one had approached him, he calculated the odds of keeping it at 20 to 1
After three months he figured 100 to 1 no one would turn up
The ball bounces into 21
The  gives a cry of joy
She grips the  's hand
He leans over to her, eyeing her diamond necklace, and whispers something seductive in her ear
She stiffens with apprehensive pleasure
The -  opens his eyes, there is a look of misery on his face
sweeps away the lost chips, pays out five minor winners
He calmly counts a small pile of chips and slides them to the -  by sleight of hand
Then he prepares to pay out the
No one has noticed the pay-out to the -

smiles mechanically
The  mouths the words 'Thank you' to

She swears and bends to pick up the pieces

She lets it fall back, goes to look in the chest of drawers for another
She can't find one among the underwear
She goes on to ' drawer and pulls out a shirt
She unfolds it
Out drop the four packets of 2500
She bends to pick them up
She looks at them incredulously

' He watched their faces as they lost hour after hour, night after night, relentlessly
'  as he deals

The little book charm dangles round his neck
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble
(looks up) Never
Why do you ask
can just imagine, being around so much money all the time
Gambling's not about money
Really
Gambling's about not facing reality
Ignoring the odds
She takes her hands away from his neck

never think about the odds

He drinks at a gulp
He turns
Standing in the doorway is , wearing a nightdress
She is sleepy
What are you laughing at
Who was that on the phone
couple  know are getting married
puts her arms around him lovingly
Fools
whistling sound
- We are back in the
The ball bounces around the spinning wheel
The  of the
Frozen expressions
They are almost still
We do not see the croupier

' The croupier's mission was accomplished
The ball falls into green Zero
rakes all the chips off the table
There are no winners
The film ends on a - of ' face
look of calm satisfaction
' At last he was Master of the Game
He had aquired the power
to make you lose
