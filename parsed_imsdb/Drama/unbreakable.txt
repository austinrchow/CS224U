Penny shopping bags is ushered past the department store managers and security guards on walkies that have gathered at the entrance to the woman's dressing rooms
: - bed has been formed by a chair and three benches
-  in her twenties lays across it
Her face and clothes are covered in sweat
Her skirt is stained
She holds something wrapped in a soft sweatshirt on her chest
We can't see it, but
She's just given birth
There are three frazzled saleswomen in the dressing room with her
They watch her with quiet smiles
fourth  arrives ushering in the man with the shopping bags
This is Mr
Mathison
He's a doctor
looks over the scene and then directly at the striking woman
You okay
The woman nods, "Yes
" Sweat trickles down her face
' An ambulance is on the way
Dr
Mathison puts down his shopping bags and moves to her
He kneels down and gestures for the bundle of sweatshirts in her arms
Is there a name yet
Beat
The woman smiles for the first time
Elijah
She hands him the wrapped child
We can't see the baby, but Is he supposed to be crying like that
The doctor lowers the baby to his lap and unwraps him
The woman can't see her baby anymore
She watches Dr
Mathison as he looks down and examines her child
Beat
Dr
Mathison doesn't look up for the longest time
Can  have him back
'
Beat
The doctor finally glances up
He looks shaken
He makes eye contact with the woman for only a second
It's enough
chill goes through her body
He looks to the three saleswomen who were in the room
What happened during the delivery
His hard stare unsettles the women
The   speaks up
Nothing
It was very quick
The baby just wanted to come right out
There was no problems
Did you drop him
Everyone becomes very still
The mother looks like she stopped breathing '
Did you drop this baby
Beat
Jesus Christ, no
The
The doctor whispers something to himself, we can't hear
He looks up to the saleswoman who brought him in
Please inform the ambulance we have a situation
Dr
Mathison turns back to the mother
Beat
've never seen this
It appears your infant sustained some fractures while in your uterus
(beat) His arms and legs are broken
: - " " fountain of humanity bubbles up from the escalators to the train platform
Businessmen take their last desperate drags of their cigarettes
Women traveling with children herd their luggage and offspring into tight shapes as they move
College students with backpacks look around dazed at the various track numbers

First two passenger cars only
First two cars only
face inside the train watches the stream of passengers emerging from the escalators
, a man in his early forties, rest his temple against the glass and quietly observes the movement outside
The train starts to pull out
: - David sits with his coat on his lap
He's wearing a tie
He doesn't look very comfortable in it
He feels a stare
He looks up to find a girl, six or seven years old, peering at him from over the seat in front of him
She just gazes at him blankly
He gives her a small forced smile
She doesn't react
David returns his head to the window
His eyes begin to shut with the lulling movement of the train
(o
s
) You alone
David looks in the direction of
with dark hair and light blue eyes stands in the aisle with two bags over her shoulder
She's wearing a tight white t-shirt and jeans
She's beautiful
David nods "yes
" The woman starts putting her bags on the shelf above the seats
She stretches to get them up
Her toned stomach is exposed
She has a silver ring pierced through her navel
David has a gold ring on his hand
He fiddles with it
Beat
He gently slips off his wedding band
It goes into his coat pocket
The woman takes the seat next to him
Beat
The passenger car shakes as a passing train barrels by two feet from David's window
It passes in a few seconds
The car returns to a
David pulls a magazine out from the seat pocket in front of him
He holds the woman's fashion magazine out
Someone left these
You want one
The woman looks over the one being offered and then points to the Sports Illustrated peeking out of the seat pocket
David pulls the magazine out and gives it to her
You like sports
It's my field
represent athletes
'm an agent
What a coincidence
'm a male synchronized swimmer and 'm looking for representation
(smiling) Is that right
But 'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit
The woman laughs
You represent someone in Philadelphia
'm meeting a player from Temple University
He's a cornerback
You like football
Beat
Not really
This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds
He runs the fifty in under six seconds
He's going to be a God
Beat
David studies the excitement in her eyes
David waits till the opposing train passes
The woman goes back to her magazine
Beat
'm David Dunne
The woman looks up
Kelly
She goes back to the magazine
Beat
How long are you staying in Philly
looks up from her Sports Illustrated
Her striking blue eyes gaze at David
Beat
She holds up her hand
Taps the diamond ring on her finger
(soft) 'm married
(fake excitement) Great
Beat
Sorry
(fake confusion) What are you talking about
An awkward silence
think you got the wrong idea
The woman stares at David
She looks down
Beat
Closes the magazine
'm going to find another seat
Kelly gets up
She balances herself against a headrest as the train rumbles
She starts to the back of the car
David sits alone
He looks like he's drowning, but there's no water
He feels a stare
He glances up
The little girl spies on him from between the seats
David leans towards the window to avoid eye contact
His hand reaches into his coat and slides out his wedding band
He puts it back on
His temple touches the glass
The vibration of the train begins to lull his eyes closed
Beat
David's head bounces lightly against the window
The shaking of the glass never allows David's eyes to completely close
He sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger
He looks out the window
The scenery blurs as it flies by
Beat
David turns
Some of the other passengers start to react as they realize the train is picking up speed
The normal bumps of the tracks become amplified
The
The train goes faster
David's eyes move to the seat in front of him
The little girl is no longer watching him
He sees the ground slowly drop away in the windows behind them as
: - boy, age ten, sits on his head on the family couch and watches television upside down
His floppy brown hair spreads out in a circle in front of his red face
He changes channels with a remote control
He moves past the upside down cartoons and the upside down talk shows
He stops on an upside down picture of a crashed train
Beat
His knees come forward as he flips over
He tumbles slowly off the couch and onto the carpet
gazes at the television screen Two trains are tangled like snakes
Jeremy gets up and moves to a small table with a phone
Next to the phone is a notepad
On it is written
"Dad - Amtrak 177 - 3:40pm
" Jeremy looks at the television
At the bottom of the screen in red block letters that move from right to left are words and numbers
"The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has derailed
Amtrak Emergency number is 1-800-777-4322
The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has derailed
Amtrak" Jeremy doesn't take his eyes off the screen
He makes a small desperate noise that no one hears
: - An elderly woman can't hold back any longer and
An embarrassed, tortured helpless scream
continues applying pressure to her arm which is being pushed back as far as it will go
She counts to three and eases off
She lays her arm back in her lap
About a dozen people are on specialized weight machines
The elderly woman is seated on an exercise table and breathes slowly
You okay, Virginia
Beat
shakes her head, "No
" 'll put something on the t
v
Maybe we'll find some almost naked guys to inspire you
Megan reaches up to the t
v
monitor mounted on the wall
She turns it on and starts flipping channels
She stops on  where a swimming meet is underway
Men in bikini swimsuits line the edges of the pool
Virginia starts watching with great interest
Megan's eyes move to the tiny print moving across the bottom of the screen
Her face goes still as she reads the train number
177
: - ' He blinks his vision back
He realizes he's in a bed
,
David looks around
He's in an emergency room
There are a half dozen prep areas and beds next to him
They're all empty
He can only see glimpses of activity through the drawn curtain
group of emergency room personnel are treating a man whose body is twitching violently on a gurney
One of the group is a man who glances through the opening in the curtain
He notices David sitting up from across the room
leaves the group and walks over
How are you feeling
Okay
He    in David's eyes
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital
You were in a serious accident
(beat) How's your vision
Fine
David stares across as the scene with the other patients becomes more frantic and disturbing
Where were you sitting on the train
Against a window
In the passenger car
Yes
Where are the rest of the passengers
Was your family traveling with you
No
Did you get up from your seat
No
David watches the other patient
You're certain you were in the passenger car
David turns to the man
Yes
Why are you looking at me like that
Beat
Your train derailed
Some kind of malfunction
It took a curve way to fast second train collided with yours after it derailed
The debris is spread over one mile
It's unbelievable they said
(beat) They only found two people alive so far
You and him
David looks to the other passenger now laying unnaturally still in the desperate whirlwind of activity around him
The man's skull was cracked open and most of his left side was crushed
Beat
And to answer your question, there are two reasons why 'm looking at you like this
David turns and stares at the man
One, because it seems, in a few minutes, you will officially be the only survivor of this train wreck
(beat) And two, because you don't have a scratch on you
You didn't break one bone
: - David moves through the depressing milky corridors of the hospital
He opens a set of double doors
room crammed with cameras and photographers explodes with movement
'
told you
Jeremy Dunne pushes forward through the mob of people and cameras
He bursts out and runs to David
He wraps his arms around David's waist
David just stands there, aware that the cameras are catching it all
He's overwhelmed
Hospital staff and a couple police officers push the media back
Jeremy tugs David to lean down
He does
They thought everybody on the train died
David looks at his son's face
Wipes the tears on his cheek
told them they were wrong
woman moves to them
David stands up and faces Megan Dunne
Mom even cried
David looks at Megan's eyes
lot
Megan looks away
Not a lot
They stand there for a moment
David looks shaken
Jeremy takes hold of his hand
Let's go home
Megan nods
They move to the exit
The pack of cameras and reporters burst to life as they leave the building
They jockey for position to get a last glimpse of David Dunne
: - David eats a bowl of pasta alone in a modest kitchen
He stares at his hand
Opens and closes it slowly
Beat
He rises and puts the bowl away in the sink
- David stops just before rising the stairs
He glances into a bedroom at the bottom of the stairs
The doorway is half open
He makes eye contact with his wife
Beat
don't think  got the job in New York
What does that mean
'm still going to New York
Just not this second
don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy
know
Beat
How about in the meantime, you don't sleep in the guestroom anymore
(beat) You sleep in our room
'll sleep down here
Beat
It stopped being our room a long time ago
(beat) You should go up and get some rest
Beat
Megan slowly closes the door to the guest bedroom
: - David looks at his son asleep in his bed
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom
(eyes closed) want to sleep here tonight
think it's be better if was alone
(eyes closed) won't make any noise
How about your room then
If you get scared like before, you can come back in here
Beat
Jeremy doesn't answer because he's asleep
David rubs his forehead and gets up
He turns on the t
v
, low volume, as he moves into the bathroom
: - Hot water rushes over David's face as he stands in the shower
His attention is drawn to the t
v
which is seen through the slightly open bathroom door
He turns off the water to
(t
v
) Derailed approximately seven and half miles outside Philadelphia
It came to rest on its side on the northbound tracks
It is train officials belief that some if not most of the passengers were still alive at this time
(t
v
) The momentary peace lasted only a few seconds
Boston bound freight train on the northbound tracks was seconds away from passing train 177 when it derailed
The impact happened at about three-fifteen p
m
The first of the two occupied passenger cars was severed in half and sent careening in two directions
The second of the passenger cars was crushed and dragged for four hundred feet
Six crew members were on the freight
One hundred and eighteen passengers and seven crew members were on the passenger train
There is one reported survivor
(beat) Rescue teams will be working for the next forty-eight hours removing bodies and debris
David steps out of the shower
He sees a glimpse of Jeremy asleep in bed
David shuts the door
Locks it
He gets back into the shower and turns the water back on
He closes his eyes
His face tightens up
He slowly hunches down and takes a seat on the tiled floor of the shower
Water pours over him
Beat
His muscular body begins to shake
Then we realize he's crying
: - "1969" hazy afternoon
fair has come into town
They have set up in the vast parking lot of the local high school
line of women has formed in front of the portable bathrooms
The striking African American woman we saw giving birth is now standing in line
She is older and somehow more beautiful
She stands with a skinny, almost ethereal looking African American boy
The boy wears a metal brace on his leg
holds two oversized stuffed animals in his arms
He looks back over his shoulder as His eyes dance over the many colorful rides in the parking lot
The door opens to one of the portable bathrooms
woman steps out
Elijah's mother touches his head and enters the three foot square plastic bathroom
She turns back and gives him a look
We'll play the water pistol game next
Elijah nods, "Yes" happily
The mother closes the cubicle door
Elijah is left alone amongst the line of women
They stare at him blankly
Their eyes moves over his leg brace
Elijah doesn't like it
He moves away from the line
Elijah follows the voices
He carries the stuffed animals through the crowds of people
His metal brace sounds as he walks
For a moment, he sees nothing but bodies all around him
He emerges amongst a huddle of teenagers who wait at a turnstile
man in a red and white striped coat takes their tickets and waves them in
Elijah looks up and sees the sign above the turnstile
"The Hurricane
" He watches the teenagers giggle as they each into a grey cup-like seat
They pull the metal bars down in front of them
The man in the red and white stripes leaves the turnstile
Elijah stares up at the multi-colored sign
Beat
He moves quickly
Ducks under the turnstile and climbs onto the platform
Elijah finds and empty circular seat
He slips inside the gray metal compartment and sits
He pulls down the rusted metal bar in front of him
He looks around at all the excited faces
His eyes fill with excitement too
His small hands feel the cold metal of the interior of the compartment
His expression changes
Elijah looks to the stuffed animals in his arms
He presses them to check their softness
He places the stuffed animals on either side of him on the seat
He's wedged in between them
Feels good
He reaches out and touches the hard rusted metal bar in front of him
Elijah looks a little anxious
Beat
He pulls off his sweater and wraps it around the bar
It goes around twice before he ties the arms together
He checks its softness
Elijah looks around the customized cup-like compartment he sits in
He smiles an eight year old smile of pride
'
He searches around and finds her walking in the waves of people
He hears her calling
Elijah
She moves in his direction by chance
She finds herself at the entrance to The Hurricane ride
She looks up at the sign above the turnstile
Her worried eyes immediately start searching the young faces in the gray circular compartments
Her eyes meet Elijah's
He waves
Her face goes very still
as the ride starts up
Elijah yells to his mother as the platform starts running
won't get hurt momma
'm safe
The platform spins
He sees a glimpse of his mother and the red and white striped man
She's pointing at Elijah
The platform turns
Elijah sees a flash of the red and white striped man's angered face as he yells at the frantic woman next to him
And then the ride speeds up
The gray circular seats start to spin on their own
The teenagers
Elijah's eyes fill with joy as the wind plays against his face
Suddenly the ride changes directions
The cup-like seats get jerked
Everyone grabs the metal bars to hold on
Elijah laughs as he smashes into the stuffed animal on his right
It cushions him and then falls to the floor of the compartment along with the other stuffed animal
Elijah's expression becomes tense as his compartment spins
His hands slide over the rusted metal bar as the sweater unravels
Elijah looks around
a sudden panic enters his eyes
as the ride changes directions suddenly
Elijah's hands rip away from the bar as he gets thrown to the side of the compartment
His shoulder and arm takes the brunt of the impact The ride spins its passengers
Elijah's small face looks up at the swirling clouds in a mixture of agony and terror
The ride changes directions
Elijah is thrust forward
He hits the rusted metal bar square against his chest
The world spins
Giggles and yells fill the air
Elijah slumps down onto the floor of the compartment
And then finally, the grind of the machinery slows and then comes to a gradual stop
Elijah is facing directly up at the sky
The clouds now move slowly over him
'
(o
s
) His bones
He's not well
(o
s
) Elijah baby
Then her face appears as she finds the cup-like seat Elijah is in
She begins to scream
Elijah lays on the bottom of the compartment
One arm is clutching his chest
The other is curved horrifically like an "s"
His mouth is open
His eyes are bulging
The last thing we       of an eight year old child about to black out from the pain
: :
- to find news vans and reporters lining the street across from a church
They have been cordoned off by a handful of police
Mourners are recorded as they emerge from their cars and enter the church
David is among the arriving crowd
(o
s
) David Dunne
At hearing his name, David turns back as he walks
He can't tell which reporter called his name because all of them seem to react
storm of camera movement as the group jockeys for the best angle of his troubled face
David passes a magnetic board as he enters the church
It reads, "Services for the families and friends of train 177
" : - stands before a podium
Sarah Elaston, social worker at Broad and Locust Community Center
We pray for your soul
(beat) Kevin Elliott, business man, father of six
We pray for your soul
(beat) Glen Stevens, researcher in the area of Leukemia at Drexel University
We pray for your soul
David sits amongst the mourners in the standing room only church
His eyes drift to a woman two rows ahead of him
She's turned around, looking at him
Her eyes are red  from crying
David looks away
His eyes stop on an old man far to his left just a few seats away
Father, mother and daughter stare silently
David surveys the entire church
Desperate inconsolable eyes question his existence from every direction
David has to look down
Jennifer Pennyman, third grade teacher at Jefferson Elementary
(beat) We pray for your soul
: - David and the priest who conducted the mass are alone in the mass preparation room
The priest looks in his fifties, eyes tired, blood shot
used to play football in college
In my first year as quarterback, we went on this winning streak
It just went on and on
It didn't matter who we played
'd always win
(beat) You get superstitious when something like that happens
You give things meaning
Like you wear the same color socks each game or you listen to the same
King song before you leave the apartment
wouldn't even untie the shoelaces on my cleats
'd just slip them on and off so nothing would change
gave things meaning that had no meaning
(beat) 'm here to make sure 'm not making shoelaces into something they're not again
(beat) was the only person to survive that accident
The only one
It feels like it means something
Beat
Are you a religious man, David
David nods, "No
" The priest removes the sacred stoll from his around his neck and kisses it before folding it carefully
Good
Because 'm going to talk to you as a man
Not as a man of the cloth
Okay
Beat
The priest turns to David
It was luck
Beat
What do you mean
Luck
Random
Without meaning
David just sits awkwardly
Three years ago, my cousin died on a plane that crashed on take off at Philadelphia International airport
Do you remember that crash
David nods, "Yes
" prayed and prayed and finally found some meaning in the event
It gave me peace
And then not quite a year later, an entire family from my parish burned to death in a hotel fire downtown
(beat) Again  prayed
Again found  meaning
(beat) Just two days ago, my nephew rode with you on that train back from New York
He was traveling alone for the first time
'm sorry if  can't react to your survival with the appropriate 'It was the hand of God
It was a miracle
' kind of answer
'm fresh out of those right now
David is shaken
Beat
(soft) The metal of the watch  was wearing was crushed like a sledge hammer hit it
Beat
The priest's eyes fill with emotion
My twelve year old nephew's neck was broken in four places
What's your point
You were chosen
(beat) don't think so
The priest turns and continues putting away artifacts from the mass
Silence fills the back room
: - No cameras greet his exit
No people anywhere
David walks across the now empty parking lot
His car is the only one left
He walks to the driver's side
Pulls out his keys
That's as far as he gets
His eyes catch sight of the   tucked under the windshield wiper of his car
David moves forward and gently pulls it out
His name is typed on the front
He turns it over
Two embossed words on the back
"Limited Edition" He opens the envelope
One line, handwritten, gazes at him from the gray index card
The line reads
How many days of your life have you been sick
Nothing else is written
David Dunne looks around the empty parking lot quietly
: - poorly lit changing room
row of metallic lockers sits against one wall bench splits the room
brown folding table with Dunkin Donuts boxes and bagels on it is crammed in the corner
puke colored concrete floor sets the tone
David and three other large men are changing out of their street clothes
They all put on the same yellow short sleeve shirts
The same two words are written on all their backs
"Stadium Security" This ritual goes on without a word
: - David walks along the massive curved wall around the outer rim of the stadium
As he passes the different walkways we get glimpses of the enormous and empty sixty-thousand seat football stadium on the inside
David stops at a door marked ""
: - David knocks on the door as he steps into the cramped reception room to the personnel office
The , an ancient woman with thick flabby arms never stops typing and never looks up as she talks
Yes
Is Noel in
No sir he is not
(beat) read about you in the paper
Oh
was in an accident once too
horse almost trampled me to death
Wow
had to put him down
Beat
That's a sad story
(beat) Do you think you could ask Noel something for me
The ancient secretary's right hand immediately picks up a pen and positions it over a blank pad
Her left hand keeps typing
She never looks up
Proceed
Ask if he can check how many sick days 've taken since 've worked here
Beat
Is that the entire message
Yes
: - Rain falls in sheets in the stadium
David stands at the entrance to a tunnel that empties out onto the field
He stands in an imposing dark green rain poncho and hood
The poncho almost touches the ground
The word 'security' on the back has almost faded away
We can barely see David's face under the hood
There is a football game in progress on the enormous field
The players seem unusually small
There is no one in the stands
About four hundred people are on the sidelines of the field watching the players
soggy limping banner stretched behind them declares, "The Pennslvania Elementary School Championships
" David's eyes scan the tiny figures on the field
His eyes come rest on a surge of activity on the sidelines
Beat
David steps out into the rain
: - handful of red faced fathers are yelling at each other
They're in each other's rain soaked faces
The scene feels on the verge of physical violence
David and another security guard jog over
David steps in the middle of the tight circle
The men stop yelling in the presence of stadium security
Everyone just stands in the rain glaring at each other
Beat
You know what  think about to calm down
think about those big fat, hundred and twenty pound turtles that live in the islands
Those suckers never get angry, never get in fights and live longer than all of us and all they do all is sit on the beach and hump other turtles
(beat) Why don't we take a second and think about the turtles
Nobody moves
Rain washes over the agitated faces
father breaks the moment
Yeah Jerry why don't you think about the fat ass turtles
Like your fat ass son on the field jeopardizing the rest of our chances at a fucking championship
David tenses
Everyone looks to
bald man who stands just a foot away
Jerry nods to himself
Looks like he's going to say something
Instead he lunges forward and smashes a  to the man who spoke to him
David tackles Jerry hard and fast
He drives him into the ground
Blood starts rushing out of the nose of the dazed father who took the headbutt
The other fathers start yelling and pushing each other
The remaining security guard calls on his walkie for assistance
David keeps Jerry immobilized in a powerful arm and head lock that holds the man's enraged face hard into the wet surface of the field
David's eyes are not on Jerry
They gaze out onto the field where twenty two elementary school boys have stopped playing and are standing frozen, helmets off, rain washing over their faces
They watch in horror as their parents attack each other on the sidelines
: - David is the last one left
He's showered and back in his street clothes
He sits in the dimly lit room on the bench, lost in his thoughts when the door opens
He turns to find a somewhat pregnant looking man with a tie step in
This is Hey Noel
Beat
He just stares
Forty dollars
David turns on the bench
What
You're getting a forty dollar raise per week
that's it
Silence
checked
You were right
You've never taken a sick day
(beat) Five years, no sick days get it
You want a raise
You made your point
The room is still
Beat
All right fifty dollars and that's the god damn limit
(beat) Are we done here
Beat
David nods, "Yes
" : - David is wide awake in his bed
He glances over
Jeremy is in deep sleep next to him
: - David knocks again quietly
The guest bedroom door opens
Megan looks up at David
She's just woken up
(low voice) Is Jeremy okay
(low voice) He's asleep
(low voice) Oh
Beat
They both stand awkwardly for a moment
(low voice) wanted to ask you a question
It'll sound strange, but just think about it for a second
Megan nods, "Yes
" (low voice) When's the last time  was sick
You remember
Megan tries to mask her reaction to the oddness of the question
Beat
(low voice) don't know
It's been a while
(low voice) haven't been sick this year
know that
(low voice) Okay
(low voice) Do you remember me getting sick
(low voice) Not a specific day
What's this about
(low voice) Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick
Beat
(low voice) In the three years we've been in this house
In the old apartment
Before Jeremy was born
Before we were married
Beat
(low voice) can't remember
(low voice) That's strange isn't it
Not remembering one fever
Or a cold
Or a sore throat
What do you think that means
(low voice) It means we're probably to tired to remember
David becomes quiet as he thinks
Beat
(low voice) Is that what you wanted to ask me
(low voice) Yes
(low voice) Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while 'm up
(low voice) When was the last time you wore pink
When was the last time you drank soup standing up
Final call for strange questions at two in the morning
(low voice) No that's it
David seems lost in his thoughts
(low voice) Maybe you should go up
Jeremy might see you're gone and get frightened
(beat) The train thing, really shook him up
He's scared something's going to happen to you
He doesn't want to let you out of his sight
David stares at Megan
Beat
(low voice) Yeah
know
There's silence for a bit
(low voice) When was the last time wore pink
(low voice) The Mitchell barbecue three years ago
(realizing) Oh shit
(low voice) Matching shirt and shorts
It was brutal
David half-smiles as Megan turns and starts back into the guest room
(low voice) Goodnight Megan
Megan looks back at her husband
Just for a moment
Then she looks down
(low voice) Goodnight David
Megan closes the door slowly shut
: - in a cramped sparse bedroom
"1974" thirteen year old Elijah sits in a chair with his arm in a sling
He watches a small black and white television in the corner of the room
Elijah's mother walks into the room
She looks around for a moment, and then moves to the television
Turns it off
The room
' No more sitting in this room
've let it go on long enough
'm not going out anymore
'm not getting hurt again
This was the last time told you
' You can't do anything about that
You might fall between that chair and this television
If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen
You can't hide from it in your room
Elijah just sits staring at the dark television screen
They call me Mr
Glass at school
Cause  break like glass
Elijah's face is tense
Unyielding
Beat
Elijah's mother says the next words in almost a whisper
' You make this decision now to be afraid
(beat) And you'll never turn back your whole life
You'll always be afraid
Elijah's eyes move from the television to his mother
He sees the emotion in her face
Neither says anything for a while
Beat
' got a present for you
Why
' Forget why
Do you want it or not
Elijah thinks it over
He nods, "Yes
" ' Well, go get it then
Where is it
' On a bench, across the street
Elijah looks at his mother with disbelief
' You calling me a liar
She points to the window
Beat
Elijah gets up and moves to the only window in the room
The view from his room looks out over a narrow street
On the other side of the street is a public playground
handful of children are playing on it
There are three benches to one side of the swings
On one of them is a wrapped in brown paper with a bow on it
Elijah looks to his mom who has joined him at the window
Someone's gonna take it
Beat
' Then you better get out there soon
: - Elijah walks across the playground
He's very wary of the other children running about him
He walks towards the bench with the present on it
Takes a seat
Puts the package on his lap
It's flat
The edges of the bend down over his thin legs
He undoes the white bow
He peels off the clear tape holding the brown paper together
He unfolds the paper
Beat
Elijah stares down at the single comic book in his lap
He feels the shadow of his mother
She takes a seat next to him
' bought a whole bunch
They'll be one of these waiting for you, every time you want to come out here
Beat
' They said this one has a surprise ending
Elijah looks to his mother
His intelligent piercing eyes take her in for a moment
He looks back down at his lap
He opens the first page
: - The same intelligent piercing eyes, twenty-five years older
Elijah has grown into a handsome, regal looking man
He leans on a walking stick
He's looking at an impressively framed charcoal sketch on a wall
Two figures are depicted on the top of a building locked in fierce battle
One figure is extremely muscular with a mask
The other is half human, half animal
This is from Fritz Champion's own library
This is before the first issue of the comic book hit the stands in 1968
Elijah glances at the   standing next to him and then back to the sketch
It's a classic depiction of good versus evil
Notice the square jaw of Slayer - common in most comic book heroes
And the slightly disproportionate size of Jaguaro's body to his head
This again is common, but only in villains
The thing to notice about this piece
The thing that makes it very, very special
is its realistic depiction of its figures
When the characters eventually made it into the magazine they were exaggerated
as always happens
(beat) This is vintage
The business man rubs his face
Gazes at the sketch
Beat
Wrap it up
You've made a considerably wise decision
Elijah starts to the back of the store which we now see is some type of art gallery where all the framed pictures are images and sketches from comic books
My kid's gonna go berserk
Elijah jams his walking stick into the extra thick carpet and stops
He turns
Once again please
My son Jeb
It's a gift for him
How old is Jeb
Four
No
Elijah starts back to the businessman shaking his head strongly
No, no, no, no no
You need to go now
What did  say
Do you see any Telletubbies around here
Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it
Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it
No
Well that's what you see at a toy store
Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb
One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time
Elijah's eyes pierce through the shaken man
This is an art gallery my friend
This is piece of art
Elijah points at the sketch
This is one of seventeen original drawings by Fritz Champion remaining in the world
It's value will triple every year
This piece is to be treasured
To be cherished
To be coveted by every single one of your banker friends that think they're better than you
The business man stares at the sketch with large eyes
Beat
What if  kept it
Beat
'm listening
'll keep it in my office room
What about Jeb
have a lock on the door
Elijah just stares
Will it be near a window
No direct sunlight will fall on it
Elijah eyes the man for many seconds
Beat
Come back in three days
'll think about it
Elijah starts to the back
He passes the front door as two customers walk in
Elijah talks over his shoulder to them
We're by appointment only
received a card from your store
Congratulations, you have a mailbox
The sale isn't for two weeks
This one was under the windshield of my car
Elijah turns and faces the customers for the first time
David Dunne stands with Jeremy
Elijah just stands staring for the longest time
Beat
He walks closer to them
When Elijah speaks, his voice has a whispery quality to it
You've never been sick
don't know for sure
(beat) don't think so
David and Elijah quietly look at each other
Beat
Well if this ain't a riddle worthy of the Riddler
: - Three chairs have been placed on the walkway in front of the bay window of the store
The words, "Limited Edition" are etched in the window
David, Jeremy and Elijah are seated watching the people stroll by
Elijah's cane is on his lap
Jeremy sips a drink in a paper cup
So let's get some of the usual questions out of the way
Why am  using a cane
Raise your hand if you were thinking that
Jeremy raises his hand
fractured my leg
It's the fifth time 've done that particular bone
It didn't really heal well this time
Raise your hand is you're wondering who the hell breaks the same bone five times
Jeremy and David raise their hands
have something called Osteogenesis Imperfecta
It's a genetic disorder don't make this particular type of protein very well and it makes my bones very low in density, very easy to break
've had fifty-four breaks in my life
have the tamest version of the disorder
Type one
(beat) There are type two, type three, and type four
Type four's don't make it very long
(beat) That ends our lecture on the medical anomaly known as Elijah Price
Elijah stares at his two rapt listeners
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life
Seventy-five percent
Seventy-five percent
That's not nearly good enough for me
'm extremely skeptical
Skeptical about what
Your answer to my question
It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level
Dad's been injured
Beat
What's he talking about
In college
car accident
Was it serious
David nods
He couldn't play football anymore
Beat
Elijah looks shaken
assumed because of the train
You assumed wrong
Elijah closes his eyes
When his eyes open, the life force in them has diminished
Beat
It's over
(beat) You can go now
Elijah uses his cane to get up and walk back through the doors of the store
- David and Jeremy enter the store
Elijah leans on a walking stick before one of the framed sketches
He gazes at it quietly
think you skipped a couple steps
Elijah turns
You forgot the "Now 'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step
See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step
And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step
(beat) What is over
The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head
David stares at Elijah impatiently
There are probably only four or five individuals in the world who can claim more knowledge of comics than myself
've spent a third of my life in a hospital bed with nothing else to do but read
have studied the form intimately
have seen the patterns in them
The references to social and cultural events and the atmosphere that surrounded them
've come to believe that comics are our last link to the ancient way of passing on history
The Egyptians drew pictures on walls about battles, and events
Countries all around the world still pass on knowledge through pictorial forms
(beat) believe that comics, just at their core now
have a truth
They are depicting what someone, somewhere felt or experienced
Then of course that core got chewed up in the commercial machine and gets jazzed up, made titillating - cartooned for the sale rack
Elijah gazes at David
This city has had its share of disasters
Well publicized ones
It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head
And there it stayed, as  waited and watched the news over the years
(beat) And then one day  see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed
(soft) And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality
What was your idea Elijah
Beat
(soft) If there is someone like me in the world, and 'm at one end of the spectrum
Couldn't there be someone the opposite of me, at the other end
(beat) person who can't be hurt like the rest of us
kind of person they were talking about in those stories
Elijah points at the framed comic sketches
(soft) person they believed was put here to protect the rest of us
Guard us
You thought my dad was a real- Jeremy don't take another sip of that drink
Jeremy looks down at the paper cup in his hands
Throw it in the trashcan near the door and wait for me outside
Do it now please
David waits for Jeremy to exit the store
Beat
At the church
You were following me weren't you
Technically no
gambled that you would attend the church service
just waited for you
David glares at Elijah
What's this about
This is obviously some scam
Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment
You've misunderstood
see guys like you all the time in my work
You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing
and somewhere in there, you slip it in
' just need your credit card number',' just need a small down payment
' David shakes his head
He smiles out of frustration
Beat
Did you know that this morning was the first morning  can remember, that didn't open my eyes and feel that sadness
Do you know what 'm talking about
That little bit of sadness
(beat) thought the person that wrote that note had an answer for me
For why survived that train
For why my life feels so out of balance
(beat) But  guess that's what you were counting on
Elijah stares carefully at David
Beat
David glances over to the entrance
Jeremy watched through the window concerned
'm going to leave now
(beat) Good luck with your sale
Elijah watches David walk towards the front door
What type of job do you have David
David opens the door
He looks back at Elijah
You mentioned you've met 'guys like me' in your work
(beat) What type of job would that be
Beat
work at the stadium as a security guard
Beat
David closes the door behind him
Elijah watches through the window as Jeremy takes David's hand as they cross the street
Elijah gazes out the window in a bit of a daze
: - '
David sits up in bed staring at a torn section of newspaper in his hands
Jeremy is asleep horizontally with his legs over David's legs
David doesn't blink as he gazes at the headline silently
"      131
1 " Beat
David slides out from under his son's legs
Jeremy stirs but doesn't wake up
David moves to the darkness of the corner of the room
He opens a closet door
as David yanks a chain
David steps inside the narrow closet and closes the door slightly so the     ' There's just enough room to stand and look around
David reaches up and pulls a small travel bag out of the way
David stretches as he feels on the top shelf
His hand comes down with something wrapped in a t-shirt
He unwraps it
It's a handgun
He stares at it for a beat before wrapping it back up and replacing it to the highest shelf
He stretches even more
Reaches farther back He pulls down a folder jammed with clippings
He opens the folder to reveal a young David in football uniform holding his helmet in the air victoriously
The word "Champion" is written over his head
David flips through the top clippings - all are images and stories of David and football
He turns the pile over
Goes to the last clipping
This piece of paper is folded over three times, unlike the others
He opens it
It's a newspaper headline
It reads
"    " David puts the new headline next to the old one
They look like a set
Even the font is similar
David stares at the old headline
Stares hard at the photo of the bent and heavily damaged car laying upside down in the middle of the highway
The bulb seems to flicker
David is utterly still
David gets startled
He puts back the clippings
Stuffing the new one inside with them
He replaces it back to the top shelf and leaves the closet
as David moves across the bedroom
He opens the door
Megan stands in the darkened hall
Beat
(whisper) Hi
Megan nods
Beat
(whisper) 've come to a decision
(whisper) Oh
Beat
(whisper) Let me just ask you something okay
And you can be totally honest
'm prepared for any answer
It won't affect me
David nods, "yes
" (whisper) Have you been with anyone
Since we started having problems
The answer won't affect me
Beat
David stares at his wife
(whisper) It won't affect me either way
Beat
David doesn't say anything
He just nods, "No
" Megan's face starts to tremble
She starts crying
Tears roll over her very affected face
She tries to wipe them away, but there's too many
Beat
(soft) My decision is
'd like to start again
Pretend we're at the beginning
(beat) It's a big deal you walked away from that train
It's a second chance
(beat) If you want to ask me out sometime, that would be okay
Megan nods and walks down the stairs as she wipes her face
David watches her disappear into the shadows
: '  - Sunday afternoon
The cavernous stadium opens up into a picture perfect blue sky
The Philadelphia Eagles pro football players are in uniform and doing stretches on the field
The opposing team warms up on the other end of the field
The sixty thousand seats are already half filled as fans stream in on every level of the stadium
: 27B - line of ticket holders snakes towards two turnstiles where stadium crew are ripping tickets
David Dunne stands to one side with two other security guards
The fans moving through the turnstiles are clad in all types of Eagles paraphernalia
group of girls carries a homemade banner that David reads as he tilts his head sideways
"We sleep with quarterbacks," is written in block letters
David stares at a woman carrying a newborn infant in her arms
The baby is wearing an eagles uniform
The   on David's hip bursts to life
He pulls it off his hip an listens
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket
Says he knows you
He won't tell me his name
(into walkie) What's he look like
He's got the most beautiful eyes
The hell kind of question is that
He's a guy
(into walkie) Send him packing
'm not walking all the way over there
Consider him packed didn't like his attitude
Struttin around with a cane and shit
Beat
(into walkie) Hold up Jenkins
: 17C - David finds Elijah waiting to the side as the crowds funnel through the gate
Elijah offers his hand as he walks up
David doesn't take it
They said  couldn't get in with my ticket
Elijah offers him the ticket
David inspects it
It's for last week's game
've come to understand that
(beat) An ill advised purchase in the parking lot
David hands Elijah back the ticket
What do you want
Not money
(beat) But  appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner
It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution
We're not proceeding anywhere together
We've already begun
David looks around
One more time
What is it you want
Beat
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world
you chose protection
Are you for real
You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet
You could have been one of ten thousand things
but in the end, you chose to protect people
You made that decision
and  find that very, very interesting
(beat) Now all  need is your credit card number
Beat
Elijah smiles
That last part was a joke
David fights it
But he smiles anyway
Beat
got this job because my college coach called the guy who manages the stadium
There's no hidden meaning to it
David's walkie makes  on his hip
They need me at the gate
David stares at Elijah leaning on his walking stick
Did you really want to see the game
can get you in
: 27B - The line of fans outside the gate has tripled in size and intensity
David and Elijah move along the line towards the turnstiles
It gets heaviest ten minutes before kickoff
David bumps a guy in line wearing an army jacket
David looks backs at him and continues walking
David moves to a security guard near the turnstiles
Why don't we pat down
David walks to his post near the gate and faces the crowd
Elijah moves next to him
Just give me a minute
Is there a problem
That guy in green
Sometimes people carry weapons in here
Then they drink too much
They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen
We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying
(beat) If he's carrying, he'll step out of line
Elijah observes as a security team pats down random males as they move through the turnstiles
The     moves forward in the line
His face is blank as he watches the pat down ahead of him
He's twenty people from the turnsstile
David eyes him
Fifteen people away
Ten
The man coughs and steps out of the line
Elijah watches the green army jacket melt into the thick part of the crowd and disappear as it moves away from the stadium
: - arched concrete passageway
The  from the stadium streams in causing long shadows
Elijah stands waiting in the ground tunnel by himself
David enters the tunnel and joins Elijah
He hands him a ticket
got you a seat in the seven hundred level
(points straight up) It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon
Probably the army jacket
Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show
You thought he was carrying a knife
Beat
thought he was carrying something
But not a knife
got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants
(beat) Like on t
v
Elijah stares at David
You have good instincts when it comes to things like that
Like what
Telling when people have done something wrong
Beat
Yes
Have you ever tried to develop it
don't know what you're asking
You're skill
Beat
Listen
got to be on the sidelines during the game
You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at- Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers
-ray vision, things of that sort
David exhales slowly as he stares at Elijah
Okay,  don't want to play this game anymore
It's an exaggeration of the truth
Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct
Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong
Or the level of what they've done wrong
The guy might not have been carrying anything
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants
David's
have to go now
One last question
Beat
Quick
The car accident you were in
Was there anyone else involved
The two men stand very still in the tunnel
Yes
My wife Megan
She was in the car with me
David turns and starts down the hall
David talks back over his shoulder
Have a good life Elijah and try to buy your tickets at an authorized sales location
Elijah watches as the silhouetted figure of David Dunne jogs down the darkness of the tunnel
: - We are inside a customized car
The dashboard is covered in some sort of thin foam padding
The steering wheel and gear shift have the same padding
Every corner and hard surface has been safe guarded
Elijah sits behind the wheel of his car in the parking lot of the stadium
He sits as thoughts crash at his head
Beat
He finally reaches for the keys and starts up the car
He looks into the rearview mirror and sees the man in the    pass behind his car
Elijah quickly turns and sees the man moving through the parked cars heading out of the parking lot
Elijah takes a deep breath and turns off the engine
: - Elijah's walking stick makes   on the concrete parking lot
The figure in the army jacket seems to move farther away with every step
Elijah starts breathing harder
He pushes himself to move faster
He avoids the hard chrome bumpers and tailpipes that jut out from the cars as he quickens his pace through the lot
He gains on the army jacket
(calls out) Hold up for a second
The man in the army jacket turns as he reaches a subway entrance that marks the end of the parking lot
He looks back at Elijah for a beat
Doesn't like what he sees
He disappears into the subway entrance
Elijah quickens into a jog now
He hasn't done this in a while and it's painful
He makes it with great strain to the subway
He looks into the entrance
steep flight of stairs leads to the subway floor
The tail of the army jacket is glimpsed before it disappears
Elijah breathes hard as he takes hold of the railing
(calls out) just want to ask you something
Elijah's   down the stairs
No response
Elijah starts his descent
Elijah has to move fast
He takes the steps with less and less hesitation
He's moving with great agility
and then his foot catches on a step
His hand slips away from the railing
He falls down the remaining part of the stairs
The    is heard when his hand reaches out to stop his fall
The He comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum stained floor of the subway landing
His jaw is locked in a His contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside down
The green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression pushing through the turnstile
The last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out, is the tail of the man's coat riding up as he move through the turnstile
The      peeks out from the belt of his pants
: - David's neighborhood turns crimson as the day comes to an end
The Septa bus pulls to a stop in front of a public high school
David steps off, still in his security clothes
The bus pulls away as he hears his '
David turns to the high school football field behind him
group of children are having a touch football game
Jeremy runs out from the huddle across the field to David
Was it sold out
David nods, "No
" You know how mad your mom would be if she knew you were playing football
Jeremy nods
Are you going to tell
David nods, "No
" You want yo play the last downs
We got a big guy like you
You can play on opposite sides
David looks to the fields to see a very muscular college age man in sweats who stands with the other children
He's Potter's cousin
He's the starting corner back for Temple University
David stares at his son
He going pro in the draft
They say he can run the fifty- In under six seconds
(beat) 've heard
David watches the cornerback being surrounded by kids
He's letting a couple of the kids feel his flexed bicep
'm going to go in
Just play one set of downs
told them you were great
Why'd you do that
Just one- Jeremy
(beat) 'm going in
have to do some things
What things
'm going to work out
'll help you
There's nothing to do
Jeremy turns back to the children and waves
(yells) can't play
'm working out with my dad
Jeremy turns back to his father and takes his hand
David looks down at his son who waits patiently
: - The basement is dominated by storage boxes and Christmas decorations
An old bench press and weights are in a cluttered corner
David sits and turns at the end of the bench as Jeremy laboriously carries and places fifteen a pound weight on the bar
David talks over his shoulder
Why don't you rest now
'll take it from here
You've been a big help
Jeremy goes to the opposite side of the bar and starts to put on another weight
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson
mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears
No
What if you worked out everyday for six months
You think you could beat him then
No
What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year
Jeremy is breathing hard as he puts the safety collars on the barbell and comes around to David's end of the bench
David lays back
No
David takes hold of the barbell
Beat
He takes a deep breath
The weight comes off the armrests of the bench
David lowers it to his chest and pushes it back up
He does just one more rep with serious strain
He puts the weight back on the armrest and sits up
How much did you put on there
David twists around and looks back at the barbell
He counts up the black metal circles
He turns back to Jeremy
You put too much
That's two hundred and fifty pounds
How much can you lift
David looks back at the weights
That's the most 've ever lifted
(beat) That could have been dangerous Jeremy
Why don't you go upstairs and let me finish up
Jeremy starts back to the barbell
'll take it off
'll help you right
He slips off the safety collar
You think you could have beaten up Bruce Lee
David hears the
No
mean if you knew karate
No Jeremy
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him
Jeremy is breathing hard again as he finishes with the weights and comes around to David
David lays back
No
David takes hold of the bar
Lifts it off the armrest
Brings it down
His arms are straining hard again
He raises it and lowers it two time; it takes a sizable effort
The weights bang down onto the armrest
David sits up
How much did you take off
lied
Beat
You added
Jeremy nods, "Yes" slowly
David turns completely around and looks at the barbell
He counts the black discs on the steel bar
Beat
Nobody says anything for a long time
(soft) How much is it
(soft) Two hundred and seventy
David just stares at the black steel circles on the metal bar
Jeremy comes and sits on the bench next to his father
They both stare at the weight
Beat
(dead serious) Let's put more
Beat
Okay
: - David's fingers wrap around the cold metal of the bar
He leans his head forward and looks to Jeremy
Why don't you move back a bit
Just to be safe
Jeremy moves back to the bottom of the stairs leading up to the house
He waits
Another deep breath as David heaves
The weight  as it comes off the arm rest
David is full out straining now as he lowers and raises it
His arms begin to tremble as he lifts it for the second time
the weight lands back safely onto the rest
David sits up
He looks at his son whose eyes are wide
Beat
More
Beat
David nods, "Yes
" : - An enormous amount of black discs sits on the bar
David's hands are gripping the metal
He talks to Jeremy who stands in his position at the bottom of the stairs without looking at him
You should never try anything like this
You know that right
Jeremy nods, "Yes
" What do you do if something happens
(soft) Get mom
David nods, "yes" before starting his deep breathing
He takes one last breath
the weights comes off the rest
His arms are trembling immediately now
His face is locked in a grimace as he brings the bar down to his chest and back up again two times before dropping it onto the armrest
He slowly sits up
How many did you put on that time
(soft) All of it
There's no more left
Jeremy nods, "no" in a slight daze
Beat
David looks around his basement
What else can we use
: - set of two unopened  satin finish paint cans are dangling by their metal handles on the outside of each side of the weights
The fours cans sway a little as the bar is heaved off of David's chest
His arms are shaking hard
He raises the weight to it's apex and brings it down again
It touches his chest and rises up again
David's red strained face exhales powerfully as he straightens his arms
The bar lands on the armrest with
The paint cans make   as they swing to stillness, one at a time
Beat
David sits up and turns back to the weights
His mouth moves as he calculates the discs and the cans
His lips stop moving
Beat
(soft) How much is it
David doesn't react
(soft) How much is it dad
It takes a second for David to register the question
He looks to his son
Beat
(soft) About three hundred and forty
David turns and looks at his son
Jeremy's mouth is slightly open
He gazes at his dad
Awe in his tiny eyes
: - David sits on the edge of the bathroom tub
He's just showered and wearing jeans and a t-shirt
He sits still with his elbows resting on his knees, staring at the white tiles of the floor
David gets up and walks out of the bathroom
He picks up the phone and stands in the bathroom doorway
Yeah, hello
(on phone) Is David Dunne there
Beat
Megan
(on phone) Yes
Is this David
Yeah
Megan where are you calling from
(on phone) My name is Megan Inverso
We went to college together
David looks at the phone
The lights for line  and line  are glowing
David squints his eyes as he pieces together the situation
Beat
He moves back into the bathroom
The cord stretches as he takes his seat on the edge of the bathtub
remember you
(on phone) was hoping you would call me, but
Anyway  decided not to wait
(beat) was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together
Beat
(soft) Hello
Beat
Yeah it might be nice
We hear
: - The local Chinese restaurant
Red and gold plastic dragons hang from the ceiling
couple late-nighters are at the bar
Megan and David are two of a handful of people left dining in the restaurant
They're a little dressed up
Megan looks kind of stunning
When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two
Do something they didn't know they were capable of
Not often, but it is possible
Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits
They don't know how long the shadow really is
They don't know how far away the real limits are standing
They stop out of fear
David nods as he takes it in
Beat
He looks down at his plate and twirls his lo mein onto a fork
Megan watches him
This is kind of strange isn't it
David nods, "yes" before taking the bite
We're not even acting like ourselves
David touches his mouth with his napkin
Like that
Your mouth's dirty
You tapped your napkin to your lips
You only do that when you're with someone you don't know
David looks down at his napkin
What do  do when 'm around someone  know
You use your sleeve
They both smile at each other
Beat
(o
s
) Megan
David and Megan look over to the only other table of late night diners as they get up from their table
woman about Megan's age walks over to her
thought it was you
Hi
(to David) This is Claire
Her son is in Jeremy's class
Claire and  worked on the school food drive together
Hello
smiles as she stares at David
She turns to Megan
(mouths) He's cute
Claire turns back to David
'm very happy about this
Megan mentioned to me she was considering dating again
Megan becomes still
(to David) 'm sorry, what's your name
Beat
David doesn't look up
David
David
This is my husband
Beat
All three people become frozen in silence
Claire looks to Megan
(soft) am so sorry
Megan nods
Claire quietly walks away form the table and joins her group as they leave the restaurant
Beat
Megan and David are the last one's left
They sit silently in their booth
Megan looks at David's face
He's shaken
He slowly takes a sip of water and then taps his mouth with napkin
: - It's late
The babysitter has black dyes hair and Buddy Holly glasses
David waits as she puts on her jacket
He ate about six of those chocolate covered doughnut holes with his milk
He said he only had three, but know he had six
Okay
David is not paying attention to the girl
He watches as his wife takes off her coat and heads to the guest room
She turns before entering the room
David and his wife make eye contact
(soft) Goodnight
David nods
Megan goes into her room
The guest door closes softly
David finds the babysitter looking at him with an odd expression
My parents sleep in separate beds
David reaches into his wallet and hands the girl money
Thank you
David opens the front door for her
By the way, Jeremy went to sleep in his room tonight
His room
The baby sitter nods with a smile as she walks out the front door
: ' David walks into the darkened child's bedroom
The lump on the bed turns when he hears movement
He smiles when he sees David
(whispered) 'm sleeping in my room
(soft) see
(whispered) 'm not scared
(soft) That's great
(whispered) Do you know why
David nods, "No
" (whispered) know now
(soft) Know what
(whispered) You're secret identity
(beat) That man was right
Beat
David just stares at his son
Jeremy's eyes start to close
Jeremy
Jeremy opens his eyes
(soft) There are big guys in almost every gym who can lift that much
Beat
Jeremy's eyes start to shut
(whispered) You could have lifted more
(his eyes close) Don't worry,  won't tell anyone
Jeremy Dunne falls asleep
David Dunne stands in the darkness of his son's room
Posters of comic book heroes don the walls around him
: - Elijah's cheek rests against two pristine white pillows
He looks exhausted
His eyes are fixed on some abstract point in the room
The torso of a  can be seen on the other side of the bed
We hear him speak but never see his face
(o

) fracture of the proximal phalanx of the little finger as well as multiple fractures of the sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs
The worst of the injury, however, was sustained to the left leg in the form of a spiral fracture
There were fourteen breaks
It simply shattered
They call me Mr
Glass

(o

) Who does
Kids
Elijah just keeps staring
(o

) Shall  continue
Beat
Elijah's head nods the slightest bit up and down
(o
s
) Pins were placed throughout the length of the leg
The use of a wheelchair will be needed for a two month period
The use of crutches will follow for twelve to fourteen months
Hospital stay will range from five to eight days followed by nine to twelve months of physical therapy
Prescribed medication for pain management will take the usual forms of
The '    as Elijah continues to gaze at an abstract point in the room
: - - finds Megan working with an elderly gentleman who's laboring on a stationary bike
Your ten o'clock is here
The hospital discharged him this morning
Thanks
The co-worker takes Megan's position by the elderly man
Megan crosses the physical therapy center
man in a wheel chair waits by her office
She walks up to him with a smile
Elijah right
Elijah's leg is immobilized by a metal brace and held straight
Under his shirt we see the wrappings around his ribs
His left pinky is in a splint
He smiles and nods, "yes" to Megan
: - David Dunne stands in security uniform by a set of double doors that leads into the players locker room
Three walls of the locker room are lined with shiny lockers
One side of the room has benches and massage tables
The far end of the room has work out equipment
About twenty players and trainers are scattered throughout the spacious room lost in their own pre-game rituals
David watches as a massive muscular player takes a seat on the massage table and removes his dress shirt
His body is covered in old bruises
He lays down, wincing a bit from the pain
trainer begins to massage him
David just stares at the battered athlete
His gaze moves across the room
Beat
David stares at something in the crowded room then he starts towards it
He moves through the room of players and trainers
He moves to the one area of the large room not occupied by anyone
David comes to a step at the foot of an Olympic bench press
Racks and racks of free weights sit behind the press
David looks down at the thick silver bar
Three large black plates are on either side
Six in all
David looks back and glances at the double doors where he should be standing
Beat
He looks to the twenty or so players and trainers in the room
Some of the players have headphones on
Some are staring into space
couple are on cell phones
No one notices David Dunne as he reaches for a forty-five pound black plate off the weight rack
The huge disc slides onto the bar with almost
matching forty-five pound disc goes on the other side
And then David adds another
He matches it on the other side
just the slightest bit as David takes a seat
No one notices the security guard lay back on the bench
David's hands take hold of the shiny bar
He closes his eyes
David's arms become tense
He pushes against the weight
It doesn't move
His face turns deep red
He opens his eyes and stares at the bar as he keeps training
His face and arms are shaking
He keeps staring
focusing
And then, without any fanfare, the bar lifts off the arm rest
The weight hovers over David
He lowers it to his chest for a second time
His arms aren't shaking anymore
He pushes the weights back up
He carefully brings the bar back to the arm rest
It touches down with the smallest of
David's fingers uncurl from the bar
David lets out two slow soft breaths as he counts the thick black discs
(whispers) Four ten
four forty-five
(beat) Five hundred
Beat
David sits up in a daze
He finds the entire room of athletes and trainers staring at him
Some of the players have stood up
Everyone stares as David Dunne with the same quiet disbelief in their eyes
: - Megan and Elijah are in the far corner of the room
They're separated from the other clients
Megan is seated on an exercise machine
Elijah is in his wheel chair facing her
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this
(She taps the machine) It works the quadriceps
How long have you been married
Megan is taken off guard by the question
She stares at Elijah
Beat
Twelve years
How did you get together
Elijah smiles warmly
Megan smiles softly back
car accident
Elijah smiles even bigger
Now you're going to have to tell me more
See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together
Our car flipped on an icy road
We were both injured
He couldn't play football anymore
(beat) If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together
How so
Football wasn't the kind of life  wanted
For ten years 'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game
And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion
've seen way too much of it in my job
can barely take it when my clients are in pain
(beat) don't hate the game admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else,  was in awe of how he could play it, but couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him
And it always does with that game
(beat) It's not a thing many people would understand
You and my mother would have a special connection
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation
And everyone lived happily ever after
Beat
Sort of
Beat
What part of David's body was injured
Beat
Megan's eyes become utterly still
Who said my husband's name is David
: - Eleven football players in white and green battle eleven football players in blue and gray on the field
sold out stadium watches the event
David stands at the lip of a tunnel that opens out onto the upper section of the second level
Waves of people move from their seats through the tunnel to the bathrooms and concession stands and back again
David stares to the side away from the movement, his shoulder leaned up against the wall
He looks over at the constant movement of spectators through the tunnel
Beat
His shoulder leaves the wall
He   into the stream of people
Shoulders and arms bump into him and brush by him as they move
David's eyes are looking down - his expression still - like he's listening
He continues into the dead center of the tunnel
He's in the heaviest part of the movement now
Fans continue to brush against him as they pass
And then it happens
stocky woman bumps into him
:
'
' ,  ,
Choose
: We're back with David in the crowd
He turns and watches the stocky woman walk down the tunnel
She's holding the wrist of her five year old son
She yanks it quickly and violently to keep the boy close at her side
She and the boy dissolve into the crowd
: - Elijah and Megan sit very still
There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years
've followed each one of them
Seven-three-seven crashes on take off
One hundred and seventy-two die
No survivors
hotel fire downtown
Two hundred and eleven die
No survivors
And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city
One hundred and thirty one die
One survivor
He is unharmed
(beat) 've spoken with your husband about his survival
suggested a rather unbelievable explanation
Since then, 've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true
And what was that explanation
Beat
It's a mediocre time Mrs
Dunne
People are starting to lose hope
It's hard for many to believe that extraordinary things live inside themselves as well as others
hope you can keep an open mind
Beat
(soft) Is this a religious thing
own a comic book museum
It's called the Limited Edition
(smiles) For a second there  thought you were a fanatic
believe comic books are based loosely on reality - believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -  believe your husband is one of those individuals
Beat
Megan becomes utterly still
'm glad you brought up fate Mrs
Dunne
'm becoming a strong believer in it
See, David refuses to speak with me any longer
And when  saw your name on my insurance list of approved physical therapists
It was like fate had intervened
(beat) We were meant to speak to each other
: - David lets the waves of people move by him in the tunnel
and wearing a dark blue sweat shirt carries a cardboard tray of nachos and drinks
He brushes David's arm as he passes
:            - '
' (whispers) This is my house, bitch
These are my customers
: The gray eyes man in the blue sweat shirt pauses with nachos in hand at the top of the stairs to locate his seats
Beat
David walks the five feet between them and taps him on the shoulder
People continue to stream by as the man turns to face David
The man's   go from David's face to the security emblem on his shirt
The man's face becomes still
Yeah
David stares hard at the man in front of him
We've had some problems with drug selling in this stadium
(beat) Would you mind if  checked the pockets of your sweatshirt
The gray eyed man stands eerily still with his nachos and drinks
The two men just stare at each other, evaluating the situation
People move in both directions around them, unaware
The gray eyes man holds his tray of food to the side and raises his arms slowly
David steps forward and reaches into his pockets
Beat
David pulls his hands out from the pockets
They're empty
The gray eyes man brings his arms down
Beat
The walkie on David's hip
David reaches down and pulls it off his belt without removing his eyes from the man in front of him
David brings the walkie to his mouth
(into walkie) Yeah
(o
s
) There's a message for you at the office
Your kid was hurt
David's face changes
(into walkie) When
(o
s
) Just now
They want you to come down to his school
David lowers the walkie from his face
The gray eyed man has a slight smile on
Beat
Why don't you go take care of your business
The gray eyed man takes a bite of a nacho as he stares at David
And dude, no one carries their merchandise on them any more
They got messengers for that shit now
(beat) That's what they tell me
The gray eyed man in the blue sweat shirt turns and starts down the stairs to his seat
He raises his fist in the air as someone scores a touchdown on the field
: '   - Jeremy is seated in a chair with abrasions and cuts on his face
He sits next to a smaller boy with a thermometer in his mouth
They're both looking at the glass window of the nurse's private office
There are tow people inside talking
David and
The   pulls the thermometer out of his mouth
Is that your dad
Jeremy nods "Yes
" bet my dad can beat up you dad
Jeremy turns to the thermometer boy
don't think so
: '  - No, he insisted we only call you
(beat) Though it took us a while to track down your number
It's not on file here
Megan handles that type of stuff
What stuff is that
Jeremy's stuff
David feels uncomfortable as the nurse just stares at him
Beat
David rises from his seat
So do  need to put any smelly ointments on him or anything
The white haired nurse nods, "no
" It's more emotional damage
It wasn't very serious physically
David nods
Nothing like when  sent you to the hospital
David stares at the white haired nurse
What was that
My office was on the other side of the building back then
(beat) You don't remember me do you
David nods, "no
" had red hair
David stares at the woman
He doesn't recognize her
think you were a little younger than Jeremy when it happened
(beat) Did you know we changed the conduct rules of the pool because of you
David nods, "no" slowly
The kids still talk about it like some ghost story
"Did you know there was a kid that almost drowned in the pool
He got pneumonia and almost died
" The nurse shakes her head
We let them tell it
It helps keep them safe
Beat
Are you still phobic of water
David seems lost in his thoughts
He looks up at the nurse
Yes  am
: - David and Jeremy are seated on a bench at a Septa bus stop
No one else is waiting with them
Jeremy talks without making eye contact with his dad
(soft) It was Potter and another guy  play football with
They were messing with this Chinese girl
She's kind of fat
She doesn't talk to anybody
(beat) tried to make them stop
They kept pushing me down and wouldn't let me get up
Beat
Jeremy's
(soft) thought maybe cause you were my dad,  thought might be like you
Jeremy finally looks up
Tears in his eyes
(soft) 'm not like you
David moves closer to Jeremy on the bench
You are like me
We both can get hurt
'm just an ordinary man
(beat) 'm not what you think  am
Jeremy just stares at his father
Beat
Why do you keep saying that
: - David stares at his bowl of pasta
He sits alone in the kitchen
Beat
He gets up, slides the pasta in the trash and moves to the sink
David is rinsing out the bowl when Megan walks in
David turns off the water
He's just laying in bed
He's pretty upset
He won't talk
He's dealing with a lot of things
(beat) think he needs to find answers himself
Beat
It's weird to hear you tell me about Jeremy
(beat) good weird
David looks at Megan
They stand silently in an awkward pause
Beat
Would you like to try going- Yes
-out again
Beat
David smiles
But if we see another mother from Jeremy's school, me name is Juan
always wanted to be a Juan
Megan smiles softly back
Beat
Oh
Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today
Jesus
Megan sees David's shocked expression
He didn't do anything
He just told me his theory
It's sad when patients get like that
They loose reality
(whisper) Jeremy what the hell are you doing
Megan suddenly realizes David is looking over her shoulder
Megan turns around
She
Jeremy is standing in the doorway to the kitchen
He's crying hard
In his outstretched hands is the    '
It's pointed directly at David
(crying) You don't believe
'll show you
You can't get hurt
(realizing) -Oh my God
-Jeremy did you load that gun
Jeremy nods, "Yes
" Crying harder now
(crying) -You won't get hurt
-Elijah was wrong
-Sometimes when people are sick or hurt for a long time, like Elijah, they're mind gets hurt too
David shoots a tense glance at Megan
-They start to think things that aren't true
He hold me what he thought about your father
It isn't true
(crying) -'ll show you
David starts moving a little to his right
Jeremy follows him with the barrel of the handgun
David stops moving
-You know the story about the kid who almost drowned in the pool
Jeremy stops moving
-That was me they were talking about
almost died
That was me
(crying) -You're lying
-'m not
just didn't connect it
-Jeremy, your father was injured in college - you know that
You know all about that
Jeremy's small face tenses
Confusion mixes with the desperation on his face
-Don't do it
He'll die Jeremy
Beat
Jeremy looks up, tears streaming down his cheeks
(crying) -'ll just shoot him once
-Jeremy listen to what- Jeremy starts pressing the trigger
The hammer clicks back
-Don't be scared
-Jeremy if you pull that trigger 'm going to leave
'm going to go to New York
Jeremy freezes
David flashes a desperate glance at Megan then back to Jeremy
You're right
If you shoot me, that bullet is going to bounce off me and  won't get hurt
but then 'm going to go upstairs and pack
And then leave to New York
Beat
(crying) -Why
Jeremy's hands are trembling
He starts to close his eyes as he raises the gun level with David's chest
(loud) Jeremy
Jeremy's eyes open
(loud) You're about to get into big trouble
'm your father and 'm telling you to put that gun down right now God damn it
(beat) One
(beat) Two
Jeremy puts the gun down on the floor in front of him and stands up
Megan leans against the refrigerator and slides down to a sitting position on the tiled floor
David walks over and picks up the gun
He unloads the bullets in his hand
David bends down very slowly and takes a seat on the kitchen floor
Jeremy is the last to sit down
He takes a seat in the doorway of the kitchen
Beat
He wipes his eyes with the back of his hand
Beat
(soft) You didn't have to yell
The Dunne family sits in silence on the floor of their kitchen
: - People move up and down the streets outside the storefronts
David is one of them
He waits to cross the street
He sees movement inside the Limited Edition window
: - Elijah opens the door
It takes him a bit, because of the wheelchair
David stares at Elijah's damaged condition
Beat
Joined a rugby league
Turned out to be a bad idea
(beat) Come here  want to show you something
Elijah wheels over to one of the framed sketches on the wall
It's a charcoal drawing of a muscular figure shielding himself from a blow about to be delivered
huge ominous shadow is covering him, as if something unspeakable and evil is just out of frame
Look at this
just noticed this today
David steps in close and studies the drawing
This is from the Sentryman series
color version of this was actually used in the second issue
Elijah points up to the drawing's face
Look at this eyes
What do you see
David looks right at the intense eyes of the drawing
It's fear
(beat) He was scared
They were being honest in the beginning you see
They let him be human
(beat) They turned him into a garden variety hero later
Then he was brave all the time
Elijah turns to David
followed the guy in the army jacket
David becomes still as his words register
He had a silver handled gun tucked in the back of his pants
(beat) Were you really injured in that car accident in college
David looks unsteady all of the sudden
Because  think you faked it
think you took the opportunity to end your career - no questions asked
(beat) And  think you did it, of all things, for a women
(beat) Not only do you have the physical traits of a hero, down somewhere in there, you have the moral code of one too
You were ready to sacrifice everything for what's right
Where can you find that these days
(beat) Only thing you didn't realize is that you were giving up a part of yourself when you gave up football
The physical part
And you need that part desperately to feel balance again
(beat) You can have it back now
(beat) This was all just make believe before
What if there was someone the opposite of me
What if
(beat) now believe you are the genuine article Mr
David Dunne
The kind of person we knew existed, from our history
Elijah points to the room full of pictures
It's time for someone like you
(beat) Bad is winning
can feel it
Elijah looks at David with deep admiration
His voice cracked a little at the end of his words
Beat
David doesn't take his hands out of his pockets
(rattled) must have felt some lump in his back when  bumped him
Most guns have a black or silver handle
had a fifty-fifty shot at the color
That's not what  witnessed David
Stop messing with my life Elijah
My son almost shot me last night
He wanted to prove you were right
never said you couldn't be killed
never said that
You have a problem, Elijah
My wife is right
Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it
Beat
Are you finished
No
And  have been sick spent a week in a hospital when  was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning
Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool
They were dunking me
swallowed water
They didn't know it and they almost killed me
(beat) Heroes don't get killed like that
Normal people do
Beat
Elijah seems shaken for the first time
David stares at him coldly
don't want to see you again okay
(soft) Now 'm finished
David turns and starts for the entrance
The      as David Dunne leaves the store
: - David exits the Limited Edition and moves down the street lost in this thoughts
He bumps a man in a jacket and tie walking in the opposite direction
:
' '
: David looks over his shoulder at the conservative looking man in a shirt and tie walking down the street
David Dunne is shaken
He turns and keeps walking
: '  - superhero action figure and a plastic villain do battle on Jeremy's desk
David sits dressed up in a white shirt and dress pants
He holds the villain
Jeremy holds the superhero
Megan enters the room in a beautiful brown dress
The sitter's here
David nods, "yes
" Megan studies his tense expression
We can do this another time if you want
'm fine with anything
David looks from the action figures, to his son's face to the face of his wife
They both have the same quiet anxious expression
Beat
But  put cologne on
Megan smiles
Is that what that smell is
Jeremy giggles
: - An overweight man in sweats and a ponytail counts the cash in the register
We are in a low-end comic book store
The walls are lined with shelves of comic books
The more expensive issues are kept in a glass case
looks at his watch and then to far back of the store where one head is visible behind a low rack
Hey man it's twenty after
It's time to close
gotta head
The top of the man's head doesn't move
Beat
You better not be jacking off to the Japanese comics
swear to God
No response
Ponytail man closes his register and walks towards the back
As he gets closer to the customer, he realizes that the man is in a wheelchair
The Ponytail man walks ups to Elijah
Listen man,  didn't know you were in- (beat) Just choose something all right
Elijah doesn't react
He sits in his chair in a quiet daze
Ponytail man leans over
Hello
You understand English
Ponytail man makes fake sign language gestures in front of Elijah's face
Look man, 'm just gonna wheel you out
You can think about things outside on the sidewalk
gotta get some chicken in me, you know what 'm saying
Beat
The Ponytail man shakes his head moves behind Elijah
He starts wheeling him towards the front of the store
They move down a narrow aisle of comics
Elijah suddenly grabs the left wheel and turns the chair
His immobilized left leg hits a rack of comic books
handful of comics tumbles to the ground
Shit
The ponytail man straightens the wheelchair and starts down the aisle again
After a couple of feet, Elijah jerks and grabs the other wheel sending the wheelchair ramming violently into the opposite wall
Comics are knocked free and fall onto the wheel chair and the nearby ground
Dude,  don't care if you are in a wheelchair
If you do that again, 'm calling Five-
Beat
The Ponytail man takes Elijah's silence as a, "Yes
" He straightens the chair
They move down the aisle
All is quiet
and then Elijah jerks the wheelchair to the left again
His metal brace and the wheelchair crash into two racks
Elijah gets covered in comics
That's it crackerjack
You're going to sit your ass in jail now
The Ponytail man moves to the front counter
Elijah sits in a trance - slightly hunched over
His eyes stare at a comic book in his lap
His expression changes for the first time
The Ponytail man finishes dialing
He looks over to Elijah as he waits for a voice on the other end
Elijah raises a single comic book in his hand
How much is this one
: - trendy restaurant
Not enough light to read the menus
David and Megan are on stools at one end of the bat
They sip their drinks as they appear in deep thought
think rust
Rust
As a color, not as rust
You know, a rust colored paint or wood
Megan leans slightly closer
didn't know that
Mine's still brown
My turn
What's your favorite song
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince
What was that
We're supposed to be honest
Beat
David brings his stool closer
Soft and Wet
That's very interesting
My turn
(beat) When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it
David's grin slowly fades
That's not the game
Megan moves her stool closer
They're only a foot or so apart
It's a second date
There aren't any rules
Beat
David sips his drink slowly
'm not sure
Think carefully
What about the game
It's finished
won
Beat
David glances at Megan
She waits for his answer
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it- had a nightmare one night and  didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay
(beat) think that was the first time
(beat) Does that count
(soft) That counts
Beat
Megan takes her glass up to her lips
Doesn't take a sip
Brings it back down
Do you knowingly keep Jeremy and me at a distance
Beat
Yes
Megan's face tenses
She's on the verge of getting upset
Why
don't know Megan
It's like you resent us David
Resent the life you have
Beat
David doesn't answer
You know even if it meant we couldn't be together, would never have wished that injury on you
What you could so physically was a gift
would never have wished it to go away
Megan's eyes glaze with water
Beat
You know that right
David takes a sip with a trembling hand
David's eyes look up and make eye contact with Megan's
He stares at her for the longest time
(soft) know
Husband and wife sit close together in the corner of the bar on their second date
: - Megan stands next to David as he pulls out his wallet
The babysitter with the black dyed hair and Buddy Holly glasses stands ready to leave in the doorway
You got two calls
One came through while  was on the line -  wasn't talking too long
There was an emergency with my sister
She tried to do her own perm and now she looks like- Who called through
Megan tries to hide her smile
Someone from New York
The smile instantly fades
About a security job at a museum
They want to hire you
(beat) didn't know you guys were moving to New York
Thanks for telling me
We're not moving
Oh
(beat) let the answering machine pick up the other call
The babysitter fixes her Buddy Holly glasses as she looks at the two suddenly quiet faces
David hands her the money
She opens the door
It's started to rain
Great
The babysitter covers her head with her jacket and runs down the walkway
David closes the door
Beat
Look let's be honest here
We're just at the beginning
don't expect you or  to change the course of where our lives were headed because of two dates
(beat) If you do go to New York, we can still develop this
We'll just be forced to take it slow
And in the end, that's definitely better
(beat) This is our second time around David
don't expect us to get carried away
(beat) guess congratulations is the right thing to say
Megan takes off her coat as she moves to the guest bedroom
She disappears inside
The door closely behind her
: - Only the   is on in the kitchen
David stands by the phone
'
(on tape) David
It's Elijah
It was so obvious
It's referred to over and over
That's the key you see
The repetition across time
That means at some point it was all based on common thought, a common event - a fact
(beat) It was this one issue that brought it back for me
Century Comics One-Seventeen
That's where this group, the Coalition of Evil, tried to ascertain the weakness of every superhero
(on tape) Because they all have one
(beat) Just like you
(beat) The cells that make up your muscles and your bones react to forces that act upon it, slightly different from than mine
That's clear
Your cells react to bacteria and viruses slightly differently than mine
That's also clear
But for some reason, you and  react the exact same way to water
We swallow it, we choke
We swallow too much of it, we drown
However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and , we are on the same curve
just on opposite ends
The point of all this is, we now know something we didn't
You have a weakness
Water
It's your krpytonite
(beat) You hearing me David
Call me back
got rugby practice in an hour
David hits a button on the answering machine
It makes a   before Message erased
: - The master bedroom is very narrow
bathtub and toilet are at one end
Two identical sinks sit opposite each other
David sits on the edge of the tub
His shirt is unbuttoned
He sits in a daze staring at the tiled floor
His eyes slowly move to a small white and red box laying on its side under one of the sinks
David rises and picks it up
It's a
David looks up to Megan's sink
Perfume and lotions sit on its edge
David opens her mirrored cabinet
He starts to put the band aid box back, he hesitates
His eyes begin to roam the cabinet shelves
They stop on certain items David just stands quietly for a beat before turning and looking across to his own identical mirrored medicine cabinet
There are three things on the shelf David's mouth opens just a little bit as he stares
: - David moves through the darkness down the stares in jeans and a sweatshirt
He moves to the coat closet
Pulls out the dark green rain poncho
The word "security" is almost faded away
He opens and closes the front door with virtually
: - Rain falls like gunfire from the sky
David's car pulls into the massive rain station parking lot
David steps out and pulls the hood of the poncho over his head
: - steel fence leads to a set of stairs that travel down to the dozens of interconnected tracks below
David walks down about forty feet
fenced gate with a lock stops his progress
David looks through the fence down to the tracks
Just to the side is a construction site
Cranes and lifts and various equipment stand idle in the area next to the section of train wreckage that has been brought to the station grounds for dismantling and salvaging
The bent shapes of the train pieces can only be glimpsed in outlines as they sit in the darkness, hundreds of feet away from the immaculately lit train station
Beat
as David kicks open the fence door that holds him back from going down
: - Frightening twisted pieces of metal glisten in the rain
David walks along the body of the caved-in passenger car
The passenger car is split in two
Just before the tear, along the window line, the windows have been crushed in
huge hole has been ripped below the windows exposing the ravaged interior
David stands before this heavily damaged area of the car
He just stares at the wreckage
Water falls off the rim of his hood in front of his face
His eyes drift over the ominous pieces of deformed metal
He takes a couple slow breaths as
: :
- the glazed icy top of a street
rises to his feet from the ground where he was laying amongst the fragmented pieces of windshield
He looks down at himself
His football jacket is torn
So are his jeans
He's trembling slightly, but not bleeding
About thirty feet away is a Honda, upside down, wrapped around a telephone pole
It's front is on fire
Through one of the crushed door windows,    '
Young David heads toward his car
He slips a couple of times on the slick iced surface of the road
He kneels down next to the inverted car
He looks in the crushed window frame
She is unconscious
Megan
She doesn't answer
Her body is twitching as it sits pinned behind the wheel
David pulls at the handle of the mangled door
It's wedged tight
It won't move
The heat from the fire is tremendous
David's powerful arms keep pulling with all their strength
David leans into the car and unbuckles Megan
He works her out underneath the steering column
He slides out
Her leg is bleeding
David picks her up and carries her to the grass next to the road
He lays her down gently
Megan
He just stares at her
She doesn't respond
David turns to see a truck approaching up the road
David waves frantically
The truck slows
David turns back to Megan
Her eyes are open
Tears fall from David's face as he moves the hair out of her eyes
She looks at David
(soft) thought  was dead
Beat
Me too
The driver of the truck slips and slides his way over to David
Is she all right
think her leg is fractured
Are you injured
Beat
David looks at Megan who lays shivering in the grass
He looks back at the driver
(soft) My shoulder's hurt
The driver nods
Hold on
got a
in the truck
The driver moves back to his truck
David takes Megan's hand in his and waits in the grass by the sight of their car on fire
: :
- David stands utterly still in the graveyard of train 177
: - The wheels of Elijah's wheelchair move down the hall as he follows the He follows   to a   in the storage room of the store
There are shelves and shelves of comic books
Thousands of them filed away in neat piles
Elijah picks up the phone a little out of breath
Hello
' Elijah
Beat
David
Nothing is said on the other line for a couple of beats ' What am  supposed to do
Elijah closes his eyes
His face fills with strength
: - The interior of the station is a mystical sight
One huge cavernous room, a football field in size, lined on both sides with giant pillars that rise into a misty hand painted ceiling
(v
o
) David, it's okay to be afraid
Because this part won't be like a comic book
Real life doesn't fit into little boxes that were drawn for it
David stands in a quiet corner and watches the faces of passengers arriving and departing late night trains
Even at the late hour, there is heavy traffic throughout the station
(v
o
) Go to where people are
You won't have to look very long
David stares out at the midnight travelers
Beat
He starts towards them
He passed the towering black statue standing at the far end of the station
It watches over the whole building
It's in the form of an angel lifting a soldier to heaven
David moves through the first group of people - a crisscross of arriving passengers from tracks one and two
They brush by him and lightly bump him as they move
: : David turns and glances at the blonde woman as she walks away from him towards the exit of the train station
He doesn't stop moving
David heads towards the densest part of the floor
The area near the information board
Sleepy friends and tired family members stand and wait
steady spider-like web of movement flows as six  tracks let out on either side
David moves to the center
His rain poncho almost touches the marble floor
Lines of passengers emerging from trains below the main level move steadily on either side of him
David looks down and gently turns the palms of his hands out as they at his side
His finger tops graze the jackets and clothes of the passengers walking by
Dozens and dozens of people pass
Nothing happens
Then a man in a crumpled shirt and slicked back hair brushes by
:
' Go back to Africa
: David's eyes dart up as the slicked haired man turns the corner at the information booth
He watches him for a beat
: What's your name
think you drank too much
: David watches the teenager with baggy jeans hanging off his hip
He walks and greets a group of identically dressed friends
Beat
David turns his hands back in
He seems shaken
He takes a couple of deep breaths as he gathers himself
Then David steps back to look around
the shoulder of a man standing behind him
David takes a sudden breath like someone punched him in the solar plexus
:
' Can  come in
Who are you
like your house
Can come in
What is this
(beat) No you can't come in
Beat
Are you sure
The enormous glassy eyed man takes hold of the screen door handle
He turns it
The man inside the house grabs the door handle on the inside to stop him
What are you doing
The man inside the house uses all his strength to keep the door from opening
It opens slowly anyway
: David stands frozen in the train station
His face is almost unreadable
David is standing less than a foot away from the man he bumped
They're standing shoulder to shoulder
David's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and then finally onto the man
He's huge
At least three inches taller than David
His shoulders are massive
He's wearing a one piece
The man in the orange uniform leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the full trash bag within it
He replaces it with a fresh one
He throws the full trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels and starts pushing it
David watches the man head across the floor towards a double door marked "Station Maintenance Staff Only"
Four identical gray bins sit outside the door
The huge man disappears with his bin inside
David waits
He just stares hard at the double doors
Nothing happens for the longest time
No one comes out
David makes a decision
He starts towards the doors
And then they open
The huge glassy eyed man in orange emerges carrying a bag over his shoulder
He's wearing a baseball hat with his uniform now
He heads toward a back exit
David lets him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him
: - The man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city block
Almost all the lights in the middle class homes he's passing are off at this late hour
No one is out walking except him and David Dunne fifty feet behind
The orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest stand alone homes
The uniformed man walks slower in this block
He looks around carefully as he moves
He turns into a driveway of one of the homes
He stops and pulls a wad of mail out of the mailbox
David stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face
He stands in the shadows and watches silently as the man in the orange uniform looks over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled house through a familiar side door with a screen on it
: - The side door opens with almost no sound
The hooded figure of David Dunne steps into a narrow laundry room
very large pile of unopened mail sits in a mound on the clothes dryer
Two or three days worth
David shuts the door very slowly
: - David stares out from under his hood at the mess
Cabinets are left open
Empty cans of food sit on the counter with a handful of unwashed dishes
The breakfast table is the eeriest thing in the room
It sits frozen with a plate of half-eaten, now moldy eggs at one setting and two bowls of colorful cereal in another
The cereal has dissolved in the old milk
Two cockroaches are crawling in the bowl
David moves slowly to a door in the kitchen
It's slightly open
As David gets closer, he shields his face from the strong smell
He pulls the door open quietly
At the bottom of the stairs is a '
The same man who answered the door in the flashback lays partly in the shadow, partly in the light
His crumpled tie lies folded over itself on his still chest
: - Empty beer bottles and coke cans sit in a pyramid on the coffee table
David steps into the unoccupied room
His movements are slow and tense
David looks up and follows the
David moves to the stairs as
: '  - Three closed doors converge on a landing
David opens the closest one
It's a young girl's room
Posters of boy bands are on her wall
Clothes are everywhere
The room is empty
: - slightly overweight girl, probably fourteen years old is tied by her wrists with a phone cord to the metal towel rack in her bathroom
She sits with her arms pointed upward over her head
He knees tucked up to her chest
Next to her is her younger brother
skinny boy, maybe twelve
He's tied and seated in the same way
Their heads are leaned back against their arms
They're completely listless
Eyes half mast
They watch as the door to the bathroom opens and the dark hooded figure of David Dunne steps in
His long dark slowing rain poncho still dripping water
He stands in the doorway for a moment before moving towards them
They don't react in anyway as David reaches for the phone cord and unties them
They're arms flop to their laps as they gaze up at the figure leaning over them
They boy blinks once slowly
David takes a step back and stares at them from under his hood
You need to leave now
: - An exercise bike in the corner of the bedroom has been turned into a clothes hanger long ago
The t
v
across the bed has framed family photos displayed on top of it
David's shadow passes over them as he moves towards the open bathroom on the other side of the bedroom
woman is tied to the bathroom door handle
She sits on the tiled floor slumped against the door
Her eyes stare blankly at the ground
She has considerable bruises on her face and arms
David stands before her
(soft) Where is he
The woman doesn't answer, but a       nearby
The curtains draping the screen door move with the wind from outside
David crosses the room and pushes aside the curtain
It leads to a small balcony
An empty lawn chair is the only thing on it
David steps onto the balcony and looks down
The rain still pours down unmercifully
It comes down on a black tarp that covers a pool in the backyard
David turns to go back inside
The collision is sudden and explosive
The huge man drives his shoulder into David's chest and takes him off his feet
David's body flips over the railing
The dark green rain poncho flaps in the wind as he falls two stories directly towards the black tarp
: - David lands on his stomach with a   onto the nylon black tarp
There's a thin layer of rain water on the tarp's surface
David is laying on his cheek
Half his face is covered in water
Beat
David's exposed eye looks around in a daze
The surface of  the tarp gets pounded by the rain
David uses his hands to push his body off the tarp
His hands sink into the water as his pressure pushes the tarp down
David stops pushing
His vision catches the corner of the swimming pool as the tarp slides out from under the sand bags that hold it in place
The tarp sags
David becomes utterly still
One by one the tarp starts sliding out from under the sand bags all around the edge of the pool
And then without warning, the tarp caves in
It folds around David as he and the tarp get pulled
: - David's body is tangled in the pool cover
His legs and arms thrash against the constricting black tarp
He's drowning
The last of the tarp slides out from under the sandbags that old it in place around the edge of the pool
The rain keeps falling
The tarp moves like it's alive underwater
It shifts and wraps David tighter with every movement
' '
David's only free hand reaches for the light
It catches the silver pole
The tangled mass of David and the tarp are pulled slowly towards the edge of the pool
David's head and shoulders emerge from the darkness
He takes hold of the pool's edge
Huge desperate breaths as he pulls his body out from the water and the grasp of the tarp
He hauls himself onto the ground
He sits hunched over in a dark mass, his head down under his hood
The rain poncho covering him like a blanket
Beat
He rises to his feet
The water rushes off of him
His breathing is slowing, calming
He stands in a silhouette from the light of the house
He turns and looks to the two small figures standing near the edge of the pool
The children from the bathroom stand still in the rain
They're holding an aluminum pole with a brush head for cleaning the pool
They stare up at the hooded figure
No one says anything
: - The man in the orange one-piece uniform stands over the woman tied to the door handle of the bathroom
His back is to us
He's drinking from a beer bottle as he looks down at her
He doesn't notice the third presence come into the room
He doesn't hear him move closer
Right behind him
The man in orange takes another sip of his beer, not realizing an arm is reaching over him
He doesn't get to swallow the sip in his mouth
David Dunne's powerful arm wraps around the man's thick neck
David's hands clamp together like and iron vise
He squeezes
The man's beer bottle crashes to the ground as his neck begins to get crushed
David yanks back hard, pulls the man off balance
The man's legs push back violently, sending both of them backwards across the room
They come to a hard stop as David's back gets
The huge man in orange pulls away and then   harder against the wall
David's arm remains locked around his throat
The man becomes frantic
His face turning dark red
He clutches at David's arm
He spins, taking David with him into another wall
The
The room shakes
David holds on
His face bent low and hidden under his hood
And then the man in orange throws a powerful elbow back
It lands hard right in David's side
David groans
The huge man delivers another one
Savage, desperate blows
'
And David never lets go
The elbows slow and then stop
The legs of the man in orange start to buckle
David pulls him back onto his heels
He turns him in a half circle
All of his tremendous weight is hanging from David's arm now
David The man's legs stop kicking
David keeps turning him
The man's body goes completely limp
David's just dragging two hundred and seventy-five pounds of weight in a circle over the carpet now
David slowly comes to a stop
He stands there with his arm wrapped around the man's neck
The man's limbs dangle down to the ground
Beat
David's hands let go of each other
His arm slips out from under the man's jaw
The man in orange crumples to the ground like a rag doll
The only '
Beat
He moves to the woman slumped against the door
He starts to untie the phone cords that bind her wrists to the handle
He whispers to her
(soft) It's over now
(beat) Your children are fine
They're getting help
He unties her wrists
Her arms stay above her head where they were
(soft) 'm going to go now
He stares at the woman whose eyes stare blankly at him
She sits unnaturally still against the door with her arms above her head
The mascara that has run down her face and dried, has tracks where countless tears have rolled down
David moves his hand near her mouth and nose
He checks for the feeling of breath against his hand
Beat
He rises up
Removes his hood
David Dunne stands silently in the master bedroom of someone's house and gazes at the dead woman frozen in a slumped position against her bathroom door
: - The front door opens to
The silhouetted figure of David steps into the darkness of his home
: - The dark green faded security poncho gets hung back on its hook in the closet next to the family winter coats
: '  - David enters the quiet of Jeremy's room
Jeremy lays sound asleep
David stares down at the shadowy figure of his son
He pulls the blanket over the boy's small shoulder
: '  - David sits on the edge of the empty bed in the darkness of his room
He doesn't makes a sound
He doesn't move an inch
He is so still, he seems to disappear into the shadows of the room
: - Megan stirs in her sleep
She shifts her head on the pillow
Then her body
She starts to wake as she floats across the room
She opens her eyes and sees David close by
He's carrying her in her arms
He moves up the stairs with her
No words are spoken
: - They enter their bedroom
David lays her down gently on her side of the bed
She watches as he walks out of sight
He lays down right behind her
He covers her with his arm
His hand is shaking
Beat
He speaks softly
(soft) had a bad dream
David tucks his head in close to hers and closes his eyes
Megan lays stunned in her husband's arms
Beat
(soft) It's over now
She closes her eyes too as the tears start coming
: - Downtown Philadelphia
People move up and down the sidewalks in front of the storefronts
David Dunne is among them
He crosses the street in front of The Limited Edition
The front doors of the store are open
banner over the door reads, "Annual Sale
" : - The compact store is crowded with customers
David spots Elijah with a group of people before a framed painting of a comic hero
David moves to a less crowded area of the store and waits
He turns and looks at a framed sketch
Beat
An older woman walks over from a near by picture and joins David
See the villain's eyes
They're larger than the other characters'
They insinuate a slightly skewed perspective of how they see the world
Just off normal
David stares at the drawing
He doesn't look very threatening
That's what  said to my son
He said, there's always two kinds
The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat
The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind
David turns and looks at the striking and beautiful African American woman in her sixties who stands next to him
Are you Elijah's mother
The woman turns and looks at David for the first time
' am
'm helping him with the sale
It's a pleasure to meet you
'm David Dunne
' He's spoken of you
He says you're becoming friends
We are
David looks across the store at Elijah talking with the customers
He's doing well today
' 'm very proud of him
(beat) He's been through a lot in his life
lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells
couple 'd thought had broken him
mean emotionally
(beat) They were bad
But he made it
Yes he did
He's kind of a miracle
' Yes he is
They both watch Elijah from across the room
' 'll tell him you're here
David watches as Elijah's mother walks across the store and waits for Elijah to finish talking
David turns back to the framed sketch
He looks at it with his hands in his pockets
Beat
David's stare turns into a gaze
His gaze turns into stillness
is of a withered man with large tense eyes
He sits in the shadows
He's seated in some type of machine
There are lots of buttons and levers on the machine
The machine has wheels
David turns from the sketch
He looks across the room to Elijah seated in his wheelchair
Elijah's large eyes stay focused on the customer's as he finishes negotiating
David turns back to the sketch
He looks at it with growing confusion
The more you look at drawing, the more the machine the man is seated in looks like a wheelchair
David looks back across the store
Elijah and his mother are talking
Elijah has spotted David
Beat
Elijah starts across the crowded store towards David
He wheels up to him
Did you see this
Elijah has a newspaper on his lap
He holds it up
There's a drawing on the front page
It's a hooded figure shielding two huddled children behind him
(soft) It has begun
David stares quietly at the sketch of himself
When  saw it this morning
felt a part of the world again
Elijah looks down at the newspaper
David hesitates and then reaches forward
He reaches past the paper
And  '
: '
What's going on
Elijah speaks to no one in particular as he stares out the window with tortured eyes
plane just crashed
: :
've worked here twenty-five years
know all its secrets
Secrets
(whispers) Like if there was ever a fire on floors one, two, or three
Everyone in this hotel would be burned alive
: : Passengers aren't allowed in there
Elijah doesn't answer and doesn't turn around as he exits train 177
: David takes two unsteady steps back
Elijah has tears in his eyes as he gazes down at the newspaper
He looks up to David
(low voice) almost gave up hope
There were so many times questioned myself
've made so many sacrifices but it's all been worth it
(beat) There are millions and millions or mediocre people in the world David
Isn't it great that we aren't one of them
David looks like he stopped breathing as he backs up in the store
Customers step between him and Elijah
Elijah becomes obscured and then blocked from view
: - David emerges from the store slowly
He braces himself against a parked car and then keeps on walking in a nightmarish daze
as David Dunne blends in with dozens and dozens of ordinary people, walking on an ordinary street, in an ordinary city
