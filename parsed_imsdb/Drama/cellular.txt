In the distance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the Downtown Los Angeles skyline
In    , we   some trees to reveal the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood
walk dogs, a  chucks papers fr9m a gleaming mountain bike
It's early in the morning, and the landscapers haven't come with their leaf blowers yet
to road level to face    the resplendent Martin residence
We  down the fr    ont walk, able to admire the manicured hedges and the black    scalade in the driveway, to the front door decorated with    a whimsical placard that reads, "The Martins" -- and we    pass into the foyer

She hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we to finally   ; slightly weary, but ready for the day ahead
Buenas dias, Rosario
Good morning Miss Jessica
Jessica sees her answering machine blinking, hits
In the background, a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads for the back door carrying the basket of laundry

Honey, wake up

Everything is a whirlwind of quick cuts, noise and confusion

The Gunman curses, then turns on Jessica

Jessica cringes

Wrong answer
The bastard hauls back and --   -- punches her in the face, knocking Jessica cold
Then he turns to his men

They bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees-- :  '  as it arrives at its destination; an isolated  in the Hills
The grass is dead
The trees are dead
It's the kind of place you could scream for a week and no one would hear a thing
As the van stops-- : - ' door  open
Light slices through the dark revealing the dusty, skeletal interior
Jessica is hurled into the room and falls to the floor
With bound hands, she frantically pulls her blindfold off to see-- - Standing in front of her
Sturdier than the rest

what do you want
Unsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her
Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze
Then suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room
Jessica breathes a sigh of relief
but it catches in her throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a
Grim as death, he stalks toward her -- (') No, wait
And reaching

As phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking Jessica in the darkness
Only now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to show through
Trembling, tears running down her face, Jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic-- (') Wha
what the hell is happening
The attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets
: Skimming along the water
And we   to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern California, and at the center of it all, the -  - It would be a typical day, except for that some  are preparing for a "  " rally at the end of the pier
set up, preparing for the daily grind ahead

crack beers while awaiting the next bite

The screen displays a car-race arcade game
computer generated hot-rod passes other racers at breakneck speed
Playing the sit-down game,  , is: , early twenties, looks like he grew up on the beach without so much as a pot to piss in
His lethal reflexes and bold recklessness, however, have made him a Jedi Master of the game
Ryan's score approaches the   at the top of the screen
You recording this
() Yeah, sure
, his best bud, aims a at some   instead
We can see their faces on the tiny  of the cellphone
Ryan's car gets caught behind a blue speedster, then passes on the shoulder
Move, bitch
He gets an   and the screen flashes "
" Nearby, a  watching the game nods
Nice
The   starts rising to match Ryan's score
Get that
Ryan turns around to see Chad has shoved the cellphone down the front of his tattered shorts
And he's freeballing it
Check it; Attack of the Bubblegum Monster in Hi-Def videostream- 'mon Chad,  gotta put my mouth on that
Holding a cup of soda between his teeth, Chad pulls the cellphone out of his pants and hits ""
(through cup-holding teeth) Sweet
It's going to my email right now
S9me soda inadvertently  onto the cellphone and Chad wipes it dry on his pants
Watch it dude,  gotta return that thing in seven days
They aren't giving you shit yet
Nah, whenever  return it,  just list off why the phone sucks and they give me a new model
Figure by the tenth time 'll have to go somewhere else
Ryan's car finally  in a wall of flames
Game Over
: As seen looking over the rail of the pier
The tide is in, but it's still a forty foot drop
stares over the railing like a death row inmate contemplating his last meal
Go already
No one's looking
His left hand holds his
(') (re: wallet) Need me to hold that
Ryan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts -- he zips a zipper, tucks a Velcro flap
Pats his pocket proudly
Waterproof
But as soon as Ryan covertly    , his left leg starts trembling like crazy
(') This is stupid
could get killed
Pick another dare
Chad lowers the phone, irritated
My ass
Not after you made me march in the Gay Pride Parade wearing a thong
Screw it then
In one
Two
Two and a half-- Whole numbers only, Rabbitfoot
Ryan stares at the waves crashing below
His leg starts snaking like crazy
And he chickens out, hopping back to the deck
(') Just so you know, 'm emailing this to every chick you ever met
But suddenly Ryan's oblivious to the dare
His eyes are glued to something else-- (') (speaking like  900) Transmitting pussy file now
, early 20s, a head turner, confident, funny; she can pull you in like a tractor beam
She and some carry heavy cardboard boxes toward a table set up for the "Heal The Bay" rally
Ryan walks over like he owns the place
Got any more
'm here to help
Thanks, but no, we got 'em all
What's in 'em
Chloe opens the box
Hands him a "Heal The Bay" pamphlet
(') Cool, you're handing these out during the concert
Yeah, wanna help
Ryan tries to ignore his thundering heart
Hell yeah
'm all about "Heal the Bay
" His eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand
(') Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup thing, of course
An awesome wing-man, Chad appears over Chloe's shoulder, pretending to read a pamphlet, but really holding it up so Ryan can see it
Piece of cake, now
(') We've collected water samples with the Stream Team, raised money on the Promenade
'm surprised haven't seen you
He offers his hand
(') Ryan
She takes it
Chloe
The handshake lingers a second longer than necessary, and they both smile at each other
Chad splits
(') can't tell if you're full of it
Ryan stops posturing, gets real
You ever go up to Santa Barbara
My dad used to take me there all (') the time
Their pier is amazing, clear water, huge crabs everywhere, oysters right there on the rocks, starfish
Hard to believe it's the same ocean sometimes
He's managed to win her back
Maybe you and  can take a break later when Pat Benatar goes on
Sounds like a plan
There's a moment
Then -- Oh no --  forgot
still have to pick up a box of -shirts at the Kinkos on Venice
'll do it for you
if you want
Seriously, you would
Sure
How much is the bill
Nothing
It's been paid up front
Do you promise not to go anywhere
Done
Ryan makes a graceful exit
Turns back
Okay,  won't be long
(laughing) Bye
Ryan grabs Chad, and as they walk out of earshot: Dude, does Santa Barbara have a harbor or a pier
: - short time later, Ryan cruises through a Venice neighborhood
Ryan drives an early 70's Ford Bronco; clothes are strewn across the backseat, and a box of "Heal the Bay" - now sits on the shotgun seat
Ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush
He sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing
Checking himself out in the mirror, he sniffs his pits, whoa, and grabs the cellphone
(into phone) Dex, wassup
You won't believe the hotties  just met at the pier
Smoking
You wanna meet them
Yeah
Well don't get too excited 'cause  need my money
Ryan stops at a red light
(') Bullshit, you're not going anywhere, (quickly adding) 'm pulling up right now
Some   ,
It's deafening
Ryan lays on the horn
When the light changes, Ryan peels away angrily
(') (covering his ear) What
Yeah, you better be
And need your shower, 'm talkin' code red stankage- The  begins to  with  just as Ryan drives under an
Suddenly -- The car ahead of him  in the middle of the street
Ryan notices too late and has to jam on the brakes
The car skids, he
and comes to a stop an inch before hitting the other car's bumper
He lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is (') (into phone) Dex
You still there
And as has happened to all of us, he loses the call
(') Damn
-                             10 As traffic resumes and Ryan clears the overpass-- iu :
Ryan picks up the phone

She's trying so hard to simulate a   that she almost doesn't hear: () Hello
Jessica's hands go suddenly still, then --

-                                    13 With still no answer, Ryan pulls the phone from his ear -- Whatever
Signing off- -- and is just about to hit   when he hears a tiny female voice on the other end
() Wait
Don't hang up
Ryan puts the phone back to his ear
Hello
() There's not much time
need you to go to the police
My name is Jessica Martin; 've been kidnapped
(not buying) Oh really
Kidnapped, huh
13                                                                          j

know what you're thinking, but it's real
'm in an attic somewhere

You need to- Awfully polite kidnappers to give you a phone
Jessica's voice  uncontrollably
Desperate, fearful and frustrated
() No
You don't understand
Suddenly, the cellphone  twice in Ryan's ear
He pulls it away and looks at its faceplate
14     -                                              14 The  reads:

Now 've got a real call on the other line-- : 16
16 so we see Jessica's bound hands
Her bruised face
Whispering frantically into the she's - back together as she talks
() Goddamn it, listen to me
The phone 'm on
it's shattered
There's no dialer
've been clicking wires together for hours trying to get someone, anyone, and you 're the only connection  was able to make
(important beat) If you hang up,  may not get anyone else
17     -    /                17 : Ryan's call waiting  again
He considers everything Jessica has said, then: Hmm
Sucks to be you
Try crank yanking someone else
Late
17 Wait
Don't hang up

But --
Ryan flashes over to the next call
Dex
: 18
-                                     18 checks Ryan's name on a list, then glances at the script

Absolutely

Sorry to have bothered you
Click
The Telemarketer hangs up
Damn skippy
And that's when he notices the message flashing on the phone's faceplate:
Ryan clicks the button to pick it up
and Jessica is still there
-   /                      19 () --an you hear me
You still there
You're getting kinda creepy, lady
See ya
No
Don't
They're going to kill me
They're going to kill me
silent beat
calculated look in her eyes
pulls the phone from his ear and is about to hang up
when he hears the one sound that stops all men cold
On the other end, Jessica begins to
Oh, it's like that, huh
Nice with the fake tears, lady
Please
just need help
But Ryan won't be manipulated
You need acting lessons
Now go take your meds and bug someone else
These men
-- Jessica stops herself short, quieting the rising hysteria in her voice before it gives her away
She glances anxiously at the attic door, then continues, more in control
(') These men killed my housekeeper
My dog
You have to help me
Ryan bristles at being saddled with anything, much less this
No, actually(  don't
Not with a hot chick waiting for me at the pier
Please
you're my only hope
(beat) What's your name
That catches Ryan off-guard
He stalls, not wanting to make this personal
Why, you writing a book--

Ryan glances around the street, his eyes falling on a stone fountain outside a French Restaurant
Uh
Johnny
Johnny Fountain
Johnny
What if it was your mother who was calling for help
How would you feel
Well, 'd be damn impressed, considering she's dead
Goddamn it, how difficult is it to hand this phone off to the police

How much
Five thousand dollars
Sure you will
'm hanging up now
No, wait
Even if there's a eighty percent chance 'm lying, you nave a one in five chance to make five grand f9r a lousy twenty minutes of your life

Where's that
What
don't understand--
Greer winds up and
Hits Jessica in the stomach, knocking the wind out of her and causing her to fall to the ground
-- base ball field
Wh ich o ne does he mean
(choking out the words) don't know what you want me to say
swear-- Shut up
Which field
He wouldn't leave a message that didn't make sense to you
Greer tightens his fist and is about to hit Jessica again-- Wait
The bleachers behind left field at Dodger Stadium
That's where we first met

She's lying
(') Please
Believe me
That has to be where he means
swear to God
Then he stands, looking away for just a moment -- but long enough for Jessica to  the phone back behind the beam
Working in my profession as long as have, you begin to recognize the truth when you hear it
Jessica, trembling, hangs on Greer's every word
(') (turning back) Go to the window, Jessica
There's something  want you to see
Relieved at hiding the phone, Jessica gets up and moves to the attic window -- and
55   '  -                                       55 Down in the yard below, Jessica's eleven-year-old son Ricky stands uncomfortably in the middle of a basketball half-court as one of the kidnappers (a severe-looking ex-con named ) stands nearby, watching
56
56 Jessica's knees nearly buckle
Ricky
57
57 Hodges looks up and sees Jessica's face in the window
Then turns and tosses a basketball to Ricky
Shoot hoops
don't feel like it
(threatening) Shoot
Nervously, Ricky begins to bounce the ball
58
58 Jessica sees her son start shooting the ball -- completely oblivious to Hodges, who flicks open his coat, revealing tucked into his waistband

58                                                                        58 You have three seconds to tell me where he really is or you're going to a funeral

Helpless
There's nothing he can do
Oh Jesus
Oh Jesus

60 Jessica drains ghost-white
On the verge of passing out
Down below, Ricky shoots baskets, unaware of Hodges closing his hand around his gun
One
Please
Please, believe me
Ricky plays innocently -- while Hodges now  his pistol
Two
Frantic, Jessica locks eyes with Hodges, silently pleading for him not to do this
Hodges stares back with glacial ice
(sobbing uncontrollably) Please, he's just a child
: 61
--                                                   61 Ryan is more frenzied than Jessica
(to himself) Goddamn it, listen to her
She doesn't know

62 Ricky backs up to retrieve a high rebound
Jessica watches in horror as Hodges begins to slowly
No
no
'     swear that's all know
Greer gives a sigh of disbelief -- 45

There's a bar called Left Field
That's where we met
We were in college on our way to Mardi-gras

--                                                 63 Ryan's completely floored by Jessica's admission
She knew all along
64
-                                             64 Please God,  swear that's the truth
Don't kill my son
(looking impressed) Most people don't get past two
Greer signals, and: ->
-                                               65 Hodges tucks his gun away
just as Ricky turns around
The kid startles that Hodges was so close
Okay, kid
Let's go
66
-                                             66 Jessica watches as her son is led away to the across the yard
Once he's inside and out of view, Jessica collapses in a heap on the floor
Greer is about to exit the attic -- when Jessica speaks
You won't get away with this
When  didn't show up at the hospital, someone must have called the police-- The police are the last people on earth 'm worried about
Greer pulls a Police Scanner out of his jacket and shows it to Jessica

Suddenly, a , with the   at ear-shattering decibels, pulls alongside Ryan's car

The pumping cacophony coming from the phone behind the beam
It's subtle at first, but grows increasingly louder
She closes her eyes, praying Greer won't hear it-- But Greer does hear it
On the verge of leaving the room, Greer stops
Cocks an ear
Instantly, Jessica tries to cover it with her own voice
Do you honestly expect me to believe we're going to walk away from this alive
But Greer isn't listening to her
He strides back into the room, listening to the noise under her voice
(to Jessica) Shut up

Well

Greer ignores him
Then turns to Deason
Tell Hodges we move in ten
Deason nods and moves off

75 Jessica lies on the floor, sobbing into her knees
Soft as an insect's buzz, we can hear Ryan calling to her on the broken phone

You seem pretty good at it -- Don't you see, Ryan
Once they get Craig, we're all gonna die
You can't know that for sure
Be realistic
Does letting us live benefit them in any way
No
The only chance he's got is if you can get to the airport and find him before they do
Wait, wait--

There's no time

They'll kill me

Jessica tries another tack
Look,  have no right to ask you this Ryan, but you re my family's only chance
and  am asking
Something in the way she says that last sentence, a mixture of strength and vulnerability, gets through to Ryan
And against his own will, he's swayed

Ryan, heading toward the airport, floors the gas

Bruised
Clothes torn
Staring at her own cracked reflect  ion, she breaks down, but silently this time, locked in he r own personal hell
For Ryan, the silence is deafening
Despite his frantic driving, he feels her pain
And hates being unable to help
Jessica
There's an emotional beat, then-- Do you think God will forgive me
What do you mean--
For what 've done
For giving up Craig
Ryan is moved by the emotion in her voice
Jessica, they have your kid
You had no choice

You held out for as long as you could
(grim beat) My son and  are going to die here, Ryan
They already have us
But maybe  could've saved Craig
The truth of this has a profound effect on Ryan
And just when Jessica is about to lose herself to despair -- Ryan finds a resolve within himself even he didn't know he had
