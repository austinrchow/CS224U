It's a tad eerie
If a Zydeco band died in a     1 bus crash this is the kind of music they'd play in heaven
: which transforms to a milky white and eventually into a bright high noon sun
large black bird flies in circles overhead
As it wipes the sun a bright flare causes
- to squint, then adjust to the light and finally open
They look tired, but content, maybe even relaxed
- the owner of the eyes
Though we only see from his shoulders to the top of his head, we can tell he's lying in a field
His arm is propped behind his head as a pillow and he appears to be resting comfortably
and  fill the air but they seem to come from another place
The man doesn't notice them
His name is
gust of wind blows Butch's hair a bit and a piece of straw wipes across his forehead
Then, oddly enough, it is followed by a dollar bill, which rests against his cheek, then skitters across his face
It is followed by another and another, a five, a ten, a single
Butch pays no attention
He's in another world

small country town
Normally quiet at this hour, the street is tonight alive with trick or treaters dressed as witches, goblins and superheroes making their annual door to door rounds

At the table, hands on their laps, sit   her children,  and , twin girls aged 10, and ,   a quiet boy of 8

The children  to one another
Judy Baumer is going as a twirler
But she's so fat
'd go as Cinderella
or Peter Pan
Peter Pan's a boy
Tinker Bell's a girl
Phillip could go as Peter Pan
'cept you gotta' fly
Phillip smiles a bit at the notion
Phillip could go as a bump on a log
The girls giggle and Phillip frowns
Why can't we go just once
Caus' we jus' can't, ok
Gladys sets milk and butter on the table and stares directly at her son
Our personal beliefs lift us to a higher place
'Sides, Halloween is nothing but the Devil's work

The kids gulp as Gladys turns and heads for the door

Phillip arrives at his mother's apron
He stares at the kids with relish
In the near window, Ruth and Naomi steal a look through the window
We're Jehovah's Witness
Superman locks eyes with Phillip
Hey, Phillip Perry
Hey, Billy Reeves
How'd ya' know it was me
Go eat your supper, Phillip
Come on, kids
Let's go to the next house
Sorry for the bother
Gladys closes the door firmly and locks it

-                         6 green Impala pulls up to the main entrance and stops steps from his office to greet the driver, , a pudgy 55-year-old prison employee wearing a loud plaid jacket
Evenin', Larry
Forget somethin'
Goin' to Austin tomorrow
Gonna' take some work with me
Work, work, work
When you and me gonna' go out and grab a cold one
Sooner the better
The gate opens and the Impala passes

-                                          7 , a 38-year-old inmate who reeks with knowledge procured from the wrong side of the tracks, but whose sad, tired eyes bemoan a maximum of regret, stands on the top of a cell bunk chipping at the ceiling
, 29, rail thin, a punk who constantly licks his lips, keeps watch at the door
An   sits on his bunk and watches both with a cautious eye
Butch chips through to something
Damn if the old man ain't right
Jerry smiles, turns and grabs the old man by the shirt
And this goes to the roof
Used to
afore they walled it over
If it don't 'm gonna' rip your tongue out
Get yer' damn hands off me
Jerry laughs and joins Butch, who is already well on his way to bending open a slot in a corrugated metal air shaft hidden behind the wall

-                                       8 Superman and Dancing Skeleton, no longer with adult super- vision, fill water balloons at an outdoor water spigot
Make 'em small so you can heave 'em

-                                        9 An assembly line at the kitchen sink as the twins wash and Phillip dries the evening dishes
Gladys sits at the kitchen table, reading religious pamphlets and keeping a watchful eye over the process
Several  resound through the house
What in the world
Phillip jumps down off his stool and races into the living room

-                                           10 Superman lofts a  and grabs another as the first hits the door of the Perry house and
Bombs away
Dancing Skeleton does his best Warren Spahn and tosses a wet fastball at the door
Here's your trick
At the window, Phillip, his nose pressed to the pane, stares expressionless at the onslaught
He barely flinches as a only inches away
Gladys arrives and pulls the curtains shut once more
11A
-                                          11A Butch kicks the top off a ventilator shaft and rolls onto the roof
Jerry follows as Butch shimmies to the wall
At the edge, Butch and Jerry survey the yard as a searchlight routinely bathes the walls in a circle of light
11B     -                                      11B parked almost directly below them, next to the Administration office of the prison
You'n'me must be livin' right, Butchie boy
Let's get something straight
don't like you
As soon as we're on our way, that's it
Who said  liked you
Butch slides down and hangs from the ledge before dropping on the roof of the building below

-                                    12 causes a Guard to look up, but only momentarily as he spots Larry departing, files in hand, waving goodbye
Have a safe trip now, Larry

-                                           13 Just as Larry reaches the Impala, Butch and Jerry leap down and land on him
The spotlight showers them in a flash of light as it passes by
Butch cups his hand over Larry's mouth while Jerry reaches into his jacket -- Bingo -- a shiny
38
(to Larry) Keep yer' mouth shut
(to Larry) Gawd 'd love to blow yer' head off
14
-                                         14 Larry, driving with his eyes straight ahead, stops at the gate and waves a palm at the Guard, who opens without hesitation
'Night, Larry

Haven't heard that one in awhile
The woman, , 45, a dog-tired waitress, punches in the numbers and returns to her post behind the counter lonesome   tune pours forth
Not since last night
How's the pie

Kinda rubbery

Not much call for rhubarb
Sell one slice a day
In the background we hear a
Red turns and watches a police patrol car whiz past, lights on
Yer off duty
Tell me, if  stopped bakin' 'em would you still come by every night
Red, preoccupied, takes another rubbery bite
don't know
Mae smiles and turns her back to Red as she cleans the grill
Naw, Red Garnett, you don't come in here for the coffee and pie
You come in here for the company
To see me
Another patrol car races past
Red's eyes follow it

Steaks, baked taters,    cold beer, the works

All she can do is sigh

-                                    16C Red pulls up in front of a small house in a residential section of town
Police cars are everywhere and several officers are behind their vehicles, guns pointed at the house
Red steps out of the car and is greeted by a  , about the same age as Red
Long time, no see
What are you doin' here, Chief
Couldn't sleep

Red arrives at a truck with a 10 gallon coffee urn roped to the tailgate
He grabs a paper cup and pours
Guy holdin' his family hostage
She kicked him out, served him divorce papers, he came back drunk and pulled a

Fired two shots but we don't think anybody's hit
Actually you might know the guy from your sheriff days
Hayden Webb
Been on suspension for awhile
Ring any bells
Yeah
Lemme talk to him
No can do
Police jurisdiction
Red tastes the coffee -- cold
He spits it out, pours the contents of the cup on the ground and walks toward the front yard
Sergeant follows
And how are you guys doin'
We got specific rules to follow in these kinda situations, Red
(gives in) He won't talk
Jus' keeps yellin', crying and waving his gun around
Red moves forward into the yard
At least use the megaphone, you stubborn jackass
But Red ignores and arrives at the front door
He knocks
Hayden, this is Red Garnett
We worked together a few years back
Mind if  come in
The  inside  and the door opens a crack
, 35, distraught, peers out
'Evenin', Chief
Leave it to the
They got a three- ring circus out there and not one cup of hot coffee
You mind
Hayden mulls it over, then opens the door

Julie sobs
Her eye and temple are bruised purple
Red slowly enters, nods to Julie, takes off his hat and sets it on a lampstand
Hayden has moved away from Red against the wall
He holds the gun out at no one in particular
Julie, put a pot of coffee on
She slowly gets up and moves to the kitchen, still weeping
Appreciate it
Jus' what is it you want, Hayden

What'd they suspend you for

Girl gettin' raped, that's the word

'Help me, help me,' she says

He bites me

You know how embarrassin' that is
What's happenin', Chief mean, everybody's got a fuckin' lawyer
Julie emerges from the kitchen and retakes her seat
You love her

Then why do you hit me
Hayden grips the quivering revolver tight and points it at her
Red calms the situation

He opens the cylinder and drops the shells to the floor
calmer Hayden exits the kitchen with Red's coffee
Red accepts it, takes a sip
Hits the spot
Hayden starts to sob a bit
Red hands over a handkerchief which Hayden accepts
No cuffs, huh, Chief
Okay
You ready
Hayden nods, they stand
Red picks up his hat, sticks it on his head, opens the door and holds it for
Hayden, transfixed by the multitude of lights outside
He gulps
We'll walk out together, okay
Hayden steps back, looks at Red, then reaches behind his back, underneath his shirt and pulls out a
22 pistol

Red holds his palms out and takes a step toward Hayden
Lemme have it, Hayden
Hayden points the gun at Red, freezing him
Was  a good officer, Chief
Red nods
Was  a good deputy
The kinda man you could depend on to do what's right
Yeah
Hayden smiles
Thank you
Then he turns the  on himself, swallows the barrel and his brains out

Julie screams and sobs, still holding her crying children
Red, looking pretty shook up, slowly exits the house
He stops and looks at Julie and the kids
His eyes lock with the little boy's
Got a call, Chief Garnett
They're lookin' for ya downtown
Red slowly walks away
The little boy's eyes follow him

-                                   17 It's a small town version of a 7-11, kept open by an owner anxious to cash in on the later night munchies of beer drinkers
Good idea
Bad luck

Butch, wearing Larry's plaid jacket, jimmies open the cash register
He looks to the floor then to
Jerry, who catches Butch's gaze, holds it, looks down at the floor, then, smiling, looks back to Butch
He returns to the skin mag
Butch holds his stare at Jerry then, in one move, grabs a wad of cash and hops over the counter and out of the store
Jerry notices Butch leaving, grabs a handful of assorted Brach's candies and hurries after
Hey, wait up
Jerry's feet scurry through a pool of blood and past a quivering hand
18
-    -                18 It's very late, after midnight, and only a handful of people, half of whom are cleanup crews, shuffle through the offices
light from an office at the end of the hall catches our eye
over the phone

) understan' your concern, Johnny

'  -                                       19 Red, behind a huge    ranchstyle desk covered with files and paper, sips coffee    with one hand, works a buffalo nickel through magician's    paces with the other and balances the phone receiver in    the crook of his neck
(on phone) Cons are creatures o' habit
Like old coyotes, they'll crawl back into familiar holes
Uh huh
Yeah
Sure yer' right
Listen you go back to bed and 'll call you in the
with an update
'll have the files by then
Say hullo to the Mrs
Red sighs, puts the  back in the hook and stares at it until it  again

-  (  )                    20 The  wind up alarm  reads 5:30 and Gladys opens her eyes and gently quiets it with a touch
She groans and rises, not happy but used to the daily ritual required of her

21
-                                  21 As the kitchen light comes on we see that the couch has been opened up to a bed in which all three children sleep
The twins sleep soundly but Phillip tosses and turns away from the light
22
-                                       22 The Impala creeps through the previously seen neighborhood without its lights
23
-                                             23 Butch drives while Jerry scours the block
There's a Buick
Don't want a Buick
Want a Ford
Ford's leak oil
car's a car
Butch puts on the brakes and brings the car to a stop
Then take the Buick
Soon as we cross state line 'll do just that
(beat) 'm tired of riding around
'll check down the block
for a Ford
Jerry gets out, slams the door, lights a cigarette and walks away
Butch waits a few seconds, quietly turns the key one notch and checks the gas ggauge
It reads almost empty
He taps it with his finger but it doesn't budge
He sighs, looks up and sees
as he checks one locked car, then feeling eyes on his back, turns, looks at Butch, grins and disappears around a corner
discreetly exits the car himself, carefully closing the door without a sound

-                                24 Gladys steps into a slip and snaps her bra while cracking eggs into a skillet
By rote she salts, stirs, and pops bread into the toaster

Phillip enters, dressed in cotton briefs and a -shirt, drags a chair from the kitchen table by the window and assists his mother by buttering the toast
Thank you, Phillip
Go wake up your sisters
Phillip dutifully steps down and returns to the living room
Gladys works to adjust her slip, then grabs plates and silverware and takes them to the table
take mine fried
26
-                                          26 Gladys gasps at Jerry's face pressed against the screen, but controls herself when he brandishes the pistol
He motions for her to open the back door
She does
He slides into the room and sits down at the table

-                                        27 Ford sits in a driveway
In the far b

a back porch light glares
Butch  , looks at the light, turns to the Ford and starts to jimmie the lock
No luck
He rises and looks to the light
28
-                                          28 Jerry stuffs a piece of toast in his mouth, grins at Gladys and makes a motion to the counter
lil' on the bland side
Gimme' that ketchup
She picks up a bottle of Heinz and inches toward him
When she gets close, he grabs her and forces her onto his lap
He holds the gun to her throat and whispers in her ear
Don't got a man around here, do ya'

38 caliber coercion
The convict's hands move freely over the frightened woman's body
30
-                                30 Feed me, sweet thing
Her shaking hands raise a forkful of eggs to his lips
He licks them once then gobbles with gusto
Phillip enters the room and stops dead in his tracks
Well lookie here, you do got a man
Jerry smiles at Phillip while he kisses and licks Glady's neck
At once, Phillip darts across the room at Jerry, who backhands the boy with his gunhand, sending Phillip sprawling
Butch blasts through the door in an instant
With a swift kick to the head, Jerry is knocked senseless onto the floor against the cabinets
The gun slides across the floor and lands at Phillip's feet
(holding his ear) 'm bleedin'
You happy
Butch gives Jerry an icy stare and kneels down to eye level with Phillip
Butch looks at the gun and then at Phillip
What's your name, boy
(scared shitless) Ph
Phillip
Well, okay Phillip
Reach down and pick up that pistola
Give it to me
(to Jerry) Shut yer' mouth

He takes one step toward Butch, then another
Gladys, petrified, sobs
Phillip arrives armslength from Butch
- Now say 'stick 'em up
' (hesitant) Stick 'em up
Butch laughs and then a  from outside brings him back to reality
He grabs the gun and spins to see
Standing outside the screen door, gun leveled
Before the old man can utter a syllable, Butch grabs Phillip and points the gun straight at Cummings
Jerry jumps up and grabs Gladys
Put the gun down, old timer
You couldn't hit me anyway
Probably shoot the boy
The
Leave it be
The twins wiping sleep from their eyes, wander into the room

Shut up
In one fluid move he rips the phone from the wall
The silence is deafening

No
How we gonna' get outta' here without a hostage, tell me that

Butch flips Jerry the gun, tosses Phillip into the passenger seat, leaps over the hood and into the driver's seat

Red's deputy and boy friday,  , 40, lank, thinning hair, with a face as soft as Red's is hard, warms up Red's coffee with a jolt from the Chief's favorite plaid Thermos
(into phone) Yes, Johnny,  do understand that
The jabbering on the other end of the phone line continues as Red's eyes squint to read the files
- The first is Jerry's, complete with a grinning mug shot in the upper right hand corner
There are several pages in the file, but Red's fingers quickly peruse the top rap sheet before turning to
- It's Butch's and again Red's fingers start to move down the page then they stop and move to the photo of Butch at the top of the page

(a whisper) He's talkin' to ya'
(
) Have you heard a word 've said
Red comes to
(into phone) Yeah, Johnny
Jus' thinkin' is all
(another whisper) Press has been waiting almost an hour, Red
Red nods then notices someone at the door and motions her in
, 28, cute in a plain, no nonsense way, with giant curls accenting her round face in step with the latest hair fashions, enters the room, closes the door behind her
She's nervous as hell but trying to hide it
Red motions her to have a seat while he finishes his call
(into phone) Yeah
Clear as a bell
Mi' sabe
Red hangs up the phone, takes a draw on the coffee mug and looks again at the file
He seems lost in time
What'd he say

Red closes the file
Reminded me it's an election year
Red turns his attention to Sally
You drink before noon
(confused) Uh
no
Good
Last one  had was on a liquid diet
Last what
Secretary
(remembering) Penny Munroe
believe you have me confused
'm here from Huntsville
Assigned by Governor Connally
Red is confused
He turns a blank expression to Adler
Adler
what is this
Adler searches the messy desk for something
Rings a bell, Red
Believ' they sent us something about her this mornin'
Who sent
Guvner', Red
Adler finds the telex message sheet he's looking for and hands it to Red
() 21
34   :   (3)                                                 34 Here it is
(introducing) Uh, 'm Sally Gerber
Criminologist with the State Prison System
Sally offers her hand
Red, perusing the telex, ignores but Adler shakes somewhat reluctantly, not sure if he's supposed to like her or not
Tom Adler
Deputy
State Police
System
It's a relatively new procedure but was assigned by Governor Connally
(reading from telex) 'to work with State law enforcement officials in all affairs where penal matters coincide with those of the State Police
' It don't say nuthin' about
It includes parole and work release programs as well as penal escape situations
The office
Adler picks it up
(into phone) On our way, Marge
Adler hangs up the phone
Gettin' antsy, Red
You scheduled it
Adler hangs up, grabs Red's tie and coat from a brass rung on the wall and hands them over
Red puts down the telex, stares at Sally and reluctantly attempts to make himself presentable
The idea is that an understanding of the particular behavioral case histories should, in parole situations, help the subject to avoid habitual traps and, in penal escape situations could, conversely, identify those self-same traps as an aide to apprehension
() 22
34   :   (4)                                              34 Adler stares at Sally then turns to Red with a "never heard the like" look of amazement on his face
Red, roguishly handsome in his tan, western cut blazer, clip on tie and ten gallon hat, makes his way to the door
But, before he exits
In the first place, Miss Gerber
Sally, please
In the first place, Sally, it ain't a 'penal escape situation
' It's a manhunt
Fancy words in a circle don't help much
And what does
nose like a Blue Tick, a medulla with an antenna and one helluva lot of coffee
And with that he's out the door
35
-                                          35 throng of photogs and news writers stuff the undersized room
The clamor settles when Red enters and steps behind the lectern
Listen up, 'll only say it once
At approximately ten o'clock last night two inmates over to Huntsville, Robert 'Butch' Haynes and Jerry David Pugh, escaped through an air shaft, grabbed a prison employee's car and got out through the main gate
At approximately 1
we believe they robbed a market outside of Cut-n-Shoot and killed the store's owner
#1 Is the prison employee with them
Was when they left the prison
Sally and Adler enter the room and stand beside the lectern observing
Red notices them

35   :                                                     35 #2 What's the rap sheet on these guys like
Long as Christmas eve to a kid
Haynes was doin' 40 for armed robbery and Pugh was ridin' 20 hisself for manslaughter and assorted parole vios
#3 Is there any indication of
Lemme' finish, Billy
This mornin' another hostage was taken
from a private home in Madisonville
boy, age 8
Grabbed him out of bed
#1 Any sex offenses on Haynes or Pugh
Yer' askin' if they're preverts
Well, one is
#4 You got inter-agency cooperation on this
Texas Rangers as the criminal investigation arm of the
share responsibility with the
due to the kid being taken
But doubt they're out of bed yet
few chuckles
#3 Red, how do you plan to apprehend the escapees
Officially  can only say we have a full manhunt team on their trail and we'll proceed with due haste
#3 And unofficially
Red hesitates a moment, something's bothering him, then blurts out
Unoffically
'm gonna' hunt 'em like the rabid dogs they are
() 24
35   :   (2)                                                35 Every hand in the place shoots up and Ad Lib questions fly like bullets
That's all 've got but 'd like to introduce ya' to Miss Sally Gerber
She's straight from the Governor's office
Knows all about psychological profiles and the like
You probably have some questions for her
Red steps back and to one side
Sally is taken aback but then warms to the idea and steps to the podium for her first press conference, ready to take on the tough questions, to show off a bit, but
There are no questions
In fact there is utter silence as every raised hand drops
Eyes stare
Red sighs and starts to walk away
Look, fellas,  got work to do
And he heads out the door, followed by Sally's eyes and every reporter's in the room, who commence once again to yell out questions and mob after the Chief
Every reporter, that is, except one
He's near the back of the room and he smiles and raises his hand
Sally, unsure what to do, looks to him
You have a question
Yes  do
Sally smiles a bit then puts on her serious face awaiting
You doin' anything tonight
Sally, steamed, glares at the guy and stomps out of the room
'm serious

He's a smart guy, huh, Phillip
Phillip doesn't move or change expression
Jerry smiles, almost to himself, and   more for the hell of it
The  of the Impala  with two holes as the car speeds off down the highway

-                                          39 Red is finishing up with several reporters near the door to the parking lot
Adler jumps in, holds up his hands
All right, that's it, boys
Chief's got work to do
Red and Adler move through the parking lot to , 50, an aide to the Governor
Saunder's seconds are a , young and energetic, and , 35, dark-haired, with a cowlick
Saunders shakes Red's hand and they turn to gaze upon
'60- parked in the middle of the lot hitched to the back of a new Chevy truck
The Airstream is painted in state colors and sports banners, decals and logos

-                                          40 Saunders follows Red as he walks around the showpiece, occasionally kicking a tire or two
So whattaya' think
Saunders motions for the Photographer to come closer and take pictures
He moves in next to Red and poses as the camera clicks
We are very proud of this baby
Governor Connally special ordered it so state officials and dignitaries can ride in the parade in Dallas
You know President Kennedy's comin'

40   :                                                     40 So  hear
Latest technology, oversized engine, complete kitchen and sleeping quarters, gun racks, frig, stove, the works
Even got a hot line phone straight to the Governor's office
Red stops circling and nods to Adler, who scurries away
Fine piece of machinery
What's more, as soon as it gets back from Dallas it will be at your requisitioned disposal
Perfect for lots of situations -- a headquarters on wheels
Red smiles, walks up to one of the Lone Star decals and rips it off
We'll take it
Uh, Chief
Red rips off another decal
Adler and a few others start to load equipment, guns and files into the motor home
In addition they cart out unecessary items: mattresses, etc
and stack them in a pile outside the motor home
The Photographer continues to snap photos
(to Red) Whattaya' doin', Red
(to Photographer) Stop takin' pictures
Red does away with the parade banner
Saunders follows behind and tries to reinstate the decal
It's jus' not possible, Red
The Governor's gonna' ride it in a campaign parade tomorrow
Guvner' hisself told me this manhunt was top priority

40   :   (2)                                                40 Adler moves through the door to the  carrying Red's favorite desk chair
He's followed by  , 20's, cocksure, wearing a plain khaki uniform and boots
(to Saunders) 'cuse me
(to Red) This here's Bobby Lee
He's a specialist with the Feds
They want him to tag along
Red stares hard at Bobby Lee, then nods
Bobby Lee steps into the Airstream
Please, Red, ya' gotta' believe me
Red spots Suttle, 35, bright-eyed, with a cowlick, sitting at the wheel of the Chevy truck
Who are you
Dick Suttle, the driver
Not anymore
Bradley
, 35, glasses, moves to the truck and gets in
Suttle shrugs and steps out
Saunders stops Suttle and turns to Red
This man stays with the vehicle wherever it goes, Red
(to Suttle) You know how to operate the gadgets
Yessir
(to Suttle) Grab a seat
Suttle sets himself in the passenger seat of the truck
Sally emerges from the building, ticked off, carrying an armload of file boxes, and makes a beeline for Red
Saunders gently touches Red's shoulders; a final plea
() 28
40   :   (3)                                               40 Please Red, 'm beggin'
mean, what am suppose to tell the Governor
Sally arrives but before she can spit out a word
Tell John that Miss Gerber here checked me out on it
Red whistles and the
Red closes the door as the motor home pulls away
Saunders runs beside the passenger side window and yells in to Suttle, who stares out the window
Not a scratch, you hear me, Suttle
Not a scratch
Saunders stops, breathing hard, next to Sally
She's pissed and overloaded with files
about 20 yards down the way, comes to a stop
second later the door opens and the steps pop out
Sally walks toward the bus but when she arrives at the door
filters out of the Airstream
The Airstream moves another 20 feet then stops
Sally waits a full five seconds, then she blows the hair out of her eyes and, against her better judgment, moves cautiously forward, the file boxes getting heavier by the minute
Again, when she gets close
the Airstream moves
Sally, boiling mad as her coiffure wilts in the Texas sun, stops, and tosses down the file box in anger
The Airstream stops
from inside and a   few  , i
e
-- "Okay, Okay
" More
Red steps    out the door, turns his gaze back inside and the laughter and  comments stop on a dime
Smiling slightly he turns to Sally,   moves straight for the file box, picks it up and walks back to  the Airstream
When he arrives at the steps he turns, looks to  Sally, who stews and holds her ground
You comin' or not
She hesitates only a moment before walking straight to Red, grabbing back her file box and entering in front of him
29
41                                                             41 42
-                                              42 Sally enters, balancing the   boxes, and glares at the faces surrounding her
smiling    Red, a grinning Adler messily gorging on a cinnamon roll,   a nervous , the radio man, and, in the corner, a nasty   smirk from Bobby Lee
When the Airstream takes off again, she loses her balance and drops one of the boxes
Adler and Suttle jump forward to help but she gives them the evil eye
've got it
She kneels down to pick it up and feels eyes on her
She looks up to the men staring at
Her skirt, raised a bit, exposing a thigh
She calmly stands and looks to Adler, a piece of cinnamon roll dangling on his chin
You've got shit on your face
Red can't help but smile as Adler wipes at his face

It slows, however, before the main part of town and slides to a stop near a pay phone booth

-                                            44 Why the hell we stoppin'
You said you had a cousin near here
So
So give him a call
See if we can shack there til' things cool down
Jerry thinks it over, leans forward and, in one quick swipe, grabs the keys from the ignition
Then he laughs and crawls out on his way to the phone booth

we see Jerry strut to the phone booth and pore through a thin directory
Phillip steals a glance at Butch, who watches his rear view mirror and grits his teeth
Why'd he take the keys
So  won't leave him
(a tad hopeful) Would you leave him
Oh yeah
In the b
g
Jerry rips the 20 page phone book in half and returns to the car, half pleased with himself
He tosses the keys to Butch, who starts the car and drives off
Musta' moved
Prolly' couldn't have heard 'em anyway
Goddam ear's still bleedin'
You ever try that shit again
What
What
You were in the middle of threatenin' me
(from the movies) Ain't a threat
It's a fact
Butch reaches over, takes Phillip's hand and places it on the steering wheel
Here kid, take the wheel
Phillip, scared at the prospect, nevertheless does his best to see over the dash and keep the wheel straight
Butch turns back over the seat to confront Jerry
In two seconds 'm gonna' break your nose
That's a threat

44   :   (2)                                             44 Before Jerry has time to snicker Butch hits him full in the face and grabs the gun
Blood spurts from Jerry's nose and the injured man cups his hands over the wound
Butch spins and retakes the wheel from a frightened Phillip
And that's a fact
Instead of expressing outrage, Jerry slinks back down in the seat wearing a look of pure hatred
'm gonna' kill you for that
And that's a threat
Beginnin' to understand the difference
Somethin' catches Butch's eye and he turns and slows down and turns into
45
-                                        45 The Impala brakes to a dusty stop near the front of the store, which is bordered by a giant hay field
46
-                                       46 Okay, Phillip, listen up
'm gonna' run in here and get some smokes
Get beer
Butch hands Phillip the revolver
Here, hold it like this
And point it right between his eyes
What the hell
(to Phillip) If he so much as moves you pull the trigger right here
Put your finger on it
Jerry snickers and then laughs maniacally
Butch reaches over and cocks the pistol
Jerry's guffaws stop on a dime
Yer' a fuckin' crazy man
() 32
46   :                                                   46 And that's a fact
believe yer gettin' the hang of this
Butch steps out of the car and heads for the market
47
-                                              47 Butch enters
short fat man with a fishing cap is sweeping up
How-do
Where's yer' sodees
Hot in the first aisle
Cold in the back, in the cooler
48
-                                       48 Phillip's slightly shaking hands hold the pistol pointed directly at Jerry's head
You ever shot a gun before, boy
No answer
Phillip steals a glance at the store, anxious for Butch to return
Powww
It'll knock you on your ass
Be quiet, mister
Naw
You ain't never shot no gun before
Livin' in a house with three split tails
no Daddy around
You'll prolly' grow up queer, you know that
bead of sweat rolls down Phillip's cheek
Now 'm gonna' lean up here real slow, okay
So we can talk
Jerry raises his hands, palms up and slowly leans forward in the back seat
Phillip's hand quivers but he doesn't pull the trigger
There we go
Now we can have a 'man to man
' You are a man, ain't ya'
33
49
-                                                49 Butch dumps a six pack of  Colas, a handful of Moon Pies, a handful of beef jerky and some gum on the counter
50
-                                         50 Jerry's chin is on the front seat now and his arms are draped over it
Those are cute little underwears you got there, boy
Say does your mama sew yer' name in 'em, initials or anything
Jerry's hand slowly reaches down to the white briefs
He places one finger in the front elastic waistband and slowly pulls it open
Whatcha' got in there
Jerry sneaks a peek
Kinda' puny, ain't it
Phillip, diverted, looks down
In a flash Jerry grabs the gun
The hand is quicker than the eye
Jerry flicks open the revolver, spins it -- empty slots
(re: Butch) That sonofabitch
Hell's bells, no shells

-                                                51 The Old Man puts down his broom and ambles to the register
This be all for ya'
This and a carton of Chesterfields

Butch reaches in his pocket and extracts the wad stolen from the convenience store
The Old Man takes note
Butch selects a five and places it on the counter
Land's sake
What line of work you in
The Old Man bags the goods, but Butch takes the shells and puts them in his coat pocket
Used cars
Buy 'em, fix 'em up
Sold a Cadillac down in Madisonville this mornin'
Don't say

-                                             52 Jerry puts his gun hand around Phillip's neck and pulls the sobbing boy closer
Jerry rests his face on Phillip's neck
Come over a little closer
As Jerry    groans, Phillip seizes the moment and bites Jerry hard on    the ear
Jerry screams and drops the gun, which Phillip    picks up and carries with him as he scurries out of the car    and into the hay field
Jerry, in pain, now with both ears bleeding, crawls out of the back seat and gives chase
53
-                                                    53 Phillip, still sobbing, runs for his life in the hay, which is a full foot taller than he
no longer stumbling, now grinning maniacally, gives chase, whistling as if calling for a lost puppy
'm gonna' find you boy
You best come here
gun in hand, stumbles, falls, gets up, keeps running
He falls again and crawls to a stop
He wipes his tears and balls up on the ground trying to make himself invisible
35
54
-                                               54 Butch exits with a grocery sack
When he sees the car doors open he dumps the groceries in the front seat and looks to the field
The hay rustles as Jerry moves through the field
55
-                                               55 Jerry, crouching, moves through the field -- eyes peeled for any sign of Phillip
Phillip lies still
He hears the hay rustling near him and he looks up, squares his body and points the revolver at
Butch, who spots him, motions for him to stay put and holds out his hand for the gun
Phillip hands it over and watches while Butch reaches into the plaid jacket pocket, extracts a few shells and loads the

a little frustrated now, but still moving forward
(a whisper) Hey boy
Hey boy
You better hope don't find ya'
He spots something -- a dash of color -- and begins to crawl faster
He parts a thick batch of hay and looks up into the gun barrel and eyes of
squatted down,   who levels the revolver and closes one eye
Jerry laughs
Whatcha' gonna' do
Hit me with it
Butch reaches into the coat pocket with his free hand and shows a shell or two
Jerry's grin drops
(pleading) Me'n you are friends
Thick as theives
hears a  and runs for his life back toward the store

56
-                                       56 Phillip runs to the car and hides behind the tire opposite the store and field
In the b
g
we see Butch emerge from the field and walk toward the car
The Old Man, who also heard the shot, emerges from the store with a baseball bat
Butch arrives at the car, spots the Old Man and levels the revolver at him
Phillip is relieved when he hears Butch's voice instead of Jerry's
(to Old Man) You got a phone
Naw
Then go inside and lie down til' we're gone
The Old Man meekly does so
Butch goes to the car door, opens it and motions to a frozen stiff Phillip
Well
Get in

Adler on the short wave and tacking up a map, Bobby Lee still in his corner, Red and Sally sitting across from one another at the "kitchen table"
In the rear section of the Airstream Red's chair and a mini office for the Chief have been put together
Got a spot on 'em

About 20 miles from here
Adler sets down the mike, sticks a tack on the map and stands back
All right
Push the roadblock on 288 north by 50 miles

Hell,  dunno'and neither do they
They're jus' happy to be out
It's a high speed Sunday drive to them
Sunday drive
like that
Never heard you use that one before, Red
Sally is watching Red and listening to all of this with a troubled look on her face
Red notices
Somethin' eatin' at you
It's
perhaps premature, but do you have an auxiliary roadblock plan for when they split up
Everyone stares
No one ever questions Red
What makes you so sure they won't stay together
Sally hesitates
Red notices
You got somethin' to say, spit it out
Their situation is one of accommodation
They won't be together long
Silence
Sally continues
Haynes and Pugh are opposites
Haynes is a criminal's criminal -- armed robbery, mano y mano confrontation
Pugh, on the other hand, has a rap sheet littered with molestation and petty crime
They'll split sheets soon
(still on attack) What about the hostages
They gonna' flip a coin to see who gets to keep who

He rinses a spoon

He refuses to return her gaze
We don't have a dilemma
And neither do they
They'll keep one hostage
and get rid of one, if they haven't already
Okay
which one
If there's a , who's John
Public more likely to give a rat's ass about -- an innocent boy or a goddam bureaucrat
Red wipes the water off the spoon on his shirt and walks to his office in the back
Adler, Bobby Lee and Kaiser chuckle lightly at their boss's snubbing of the female upstart in their midst
Sally's face glows a bright red

-                                  59 Red sits in his office chair, pulls out the spoon and pours Geritol from a bottle into his coffee
He doesn't even look up when Sally enters, a stern look on her face
We need to talk, Chief Garnett
Call me Red

'm hell-bent on one thing
You hang around long enough you'll find that out

Awful
Arthur Godfrey says it keeps ya' young, but 'm not sure it's worth it
'd like an answer
This yer' first time out of an office
She refuses to answer
Thought so
What'd ya' expect ya' signed on for
Adler, Bobby Lee and Kaiser all watch the discussion, smiles on their faces
Sally abruptly closes the door
You think 'm what
Some dumb schoolgirl who wandered into the boy's locker room
Well you're wrong
don't mean to boast, but  happen to be one of the two most intelligent people involved in this fiasco
Didn't ask that
Asked what you expected
expected to be allowed to do the job assigned to me by the Governor
happen to like the Governor, hunt quail together every year
But deep down he and know that win, lose or draw this is my ship, not his
The Governor as chief executive officer of this state bears ultimate responsibility for
Bullshit
Responsibility lies with the one that loses sleep; the one with the most ulcers
This mess turns bloody -- and it might -- all it's gonna cost the Governor is a few votes

Sally softens her stance
You're the one that what
But Red side-steps
Tell ya' what
You think 'm makin' a wrong turn you speak up
Might not agree, but 'll listen
As far as stepped on toes and wounded pride, 'll buy everyone a drink when we head for home
Not until

If life's moving too slow and you wanna' project yerself into the future you step here on the gas

You oughta' make a list of all the things that are wrong

That oughta' put his pecker in a sling, huh, Red

(ignoring Adler) Shouldn't these be roadblocked as well
She points to several other unmarked roads
Sooner or later he'll get on a main road
We don't got the manpower to roadblock every farm to market
In a perfect world, Miss Gerber, we'd lock arms and thrash the bush til' he turned up
In a perfect world things like this wouldn't happen in the first place

Locals are heading out

You ever play cowboys   n' Injuns
See that Ford sedan
Now  want   you to sneak on over there like an Injun  and take a peek and see if the keys is in  it
Phillip hesitates
Don't have to if you don't wanna
but 'd appreciate it

Phillip thinks it over then opens the door and slips out
Hey, Phillip, check for a radio, too

The keys dangle when his small hand touches them
Phillip closes the door, looks around and then runs pell-mell to the passenger window of the Impala
It's got keys and a radio

Good man
Phillip holds his crotch and stamps his feet
Can we stop at a fillin' station
What for
Number one
This here's nature, Phillip
Pee in the ditch
Phillip scrambles to the ditch to relieve himself while Butch steps out of the Impala, tosses the keys into the field and walks toward the Ford

Phillip, despite his prior urgency, is having trouble coaxing relief
Butch slides into the Ford, pumps the gas pedal and turns the key

The Farmer is walking now, slowly and then at a trot as he realizes what's happening
Phillip finally starts to pee
Butch cranks again and again but the Ford is flooded
Start, you sonofabitch
The Farmer runs faster, comes closer
Hey, that's my car
Hey
Butch floors the gas to clear the flood and the  finally He throws it into reverse and peels out backwards into the road beside the ditch where Phillip continues to relieve himself
Get in the car, Phillip
The Farmer, only 30 yards or so away, is racing toward them madder than a wet hen
Phillip tries to hurry but the  continues to run through him
Phillip
Get in the car
Phillip pulls his underwear up and races to the car
He leaps into the open passenger door at the same moment Butch steps on the gas and the Farmer arrives and grabs onto the door as it closes

The Farmer releases his grip on the door and falls backward, summersaulting into the adjacent ditch
Butch places the gun back under the seat
Goddam, boy, how many 's did you drink anyway

Butch shakes his head and laughs
One thing's for sure
You got one helluva set of chompers

The Ford he stole
Owner told the locals they only drove it to church, but it does have a bad emergency brake

Red stares out the window for what seems like an eternity
No

No means negative

Red sees Sally peering at him over the top of her file
He glances around at the other sets of eyes
don't want some half-ass Sergeant York taking pot shots with a deer rifle
Adler puts the headphones back on
Bobby Lee smirks a bit
It's the only thing to do
He's got the child with him
Red gives her a look that says, "Don't defend me"
(to Sally) suppose you figger' he'll jus' give up
Maybe, maybe not
Well now there's a safe bet
'll give you a safe bet
The boy's in better hands now than he was
The third eye Pugh's sportin' on the way to the morgue shouts otherwise
Sally flashes Red a look back
Bobby Lee rises and moves past Red on his way to the toilet

Disappointment registers on the boy's face

Several local police scour the surrounding field, walking four feet apart, looking for what they hope they won't find

Near the entrance Sally is heaving

Well all right then
But first we gotta' come up with some

Buzz, what a cute name

No Phillip, no Buzz
He checks the rear view mirror and sees

Pete not expecxting this kind of pace, at least not from the get-go, leaps into his back seat
The Ford rams into the black and white pushing it backward into a lightpole and a truck
The ' , carrying mulch from the feed store, watches as his truck slides toward him

knew something was wrong from the get-go
They spot Phillip standing a few feet in front of the door
Look, he left his little boy
And look, the little rascal has
he's no better than
What
He's got that Casper costume
He stole it

He's suddenly aware of the peering eyes behind him
Lucy bangs on the glass

You little shit
Shoplifting is a crime
checks his mirror, looks ahead, spots Phillip and blasts straight for the front door of the store
He  to a halt and stares right at Phillip
Up to you, Buzz
He's frozen for a second, his knees knocking, teeth chattering, the works
Lucy appears behind him and the glass door

One, , tosses an egg from hand to hand while he watches the horizon
The other, , approaches, crawling through a barb wire fence dragging something behind him
Hurry up
Someone's comin'
Sure enough, a hail of dust signals the approach of a vehicle a mile or so away
Billy crawls into the ditch next to Frank
We see what he's dragged from the field -- a scarecrow with a floppy hat and red bandana
Stick it in the road
Hurry up
Billy does so, propping the scarecrow into a sitting position with a forked stick
Then he races back to the ditch and slides in next to Frank to divide the eggs

get four to throw and you get three
since it was my idea
Billy nods
Here they come
Aim for windows and get ready to run
The car crests the hill, followed by another, and another and a final one, all Highway Patrol, all with their lights on and Oh shit
The cars don't even slow at the sight of the scarecrow, blast- ing right through it, sending hay, hat, limbs and all, flying
The scarecrow, or what's left of it, lands in a ditch next to the boys
In unison they breathe a sigh of relief, look at each other, drop the eggs and hightail it for home

Butch reaches in the back seat for the bag of clothing
Here, take them nasty skivvies off and put on yer' jeans
He spots Phillip's not so successful effort to hide the costume box
Whatya' got there

From the store
You kyped it
Phillip nods, expecting the worst
Well, hell, Phillip, put it on
You ain't mad
Let's unnerstan' each other here

But if there's somethin' you need bad and you ain't got the money, then it's okay to take a loaner on the item
It's what ya' call an exception to the rule
Phillip tears into the box, rips out the costume, looks at it, starts to take off his underwear then balks
Butch notices
What's wrong
Nuthin'
Butch notices Phillip's hands covering his crotch
What
You don't wanna' get undressed, is that it
Phillip shrugs
You embarrassed caus'  might see yer' pecker
It's
puny

It's puny
Well hell, lemme' see
Phillip still hesitates
Go on
'll shoot ya' straight
Phillip gingerly pulls off his underwear
Butch smiles a broad grin
Hell no, Phillip, it's good size for a boy yer' age
Phillip, remasculated, smiles and starts to put on the costume

As soon as the patrol cars pass, Butch     up the  and humps it to the road and off in the    opposite direction

She looks up from the file to
Bobby Lee who sits by himself, whittling away at a stick and leering at her
Adler is at the map, holding the shortwave mike and wearing the earphones
Behind him, Red stares out the window
Haynes bought tape, rope, and some clothes for the boy
Red comes to and turns to Adler
Sally smiles almost to her- self
She was right -- Haynes is looking after the boy
Everyone knows it, but no one says anything
One puzzler though
They say the boy could have gotten away but didn't
Probably scared to death
That's not all
The kid stole a Halloween outfit
Holy Jeezus, they're a team
With the pit stop in Noodle looks like he's headed for the Panhandle
Red sighs and groans
Unpleasant news but somehow he knew it
He moves to the back room for another shot of Geritol
(to Red) What
There's more roads than people in the Panhandle

(over his shoulder) Poor counties
They tend to half finish roads then start on another one
But if anybody knows them backroads it's Red
Sally lifts her head, watches Red reenter the room, then stares out the window
Okay, so
'm Robert Haynes
Called Butch by everyone
was born in Amarillo, but grew up in the French Quarter of New Orleans
(sotto voce) What's she doin', Red
killed a man when  was eight
Silence
Nobody seems willing to play along
Red turns from the window to Sally
How'd ya' kill him
Shot him with a pistol
There was always one around the dance hall
That's what they called it but it was a whorehouse
We lived there
Red moves away from the discussion and stands at the front of the Airstream, staring out the front window
What'd the authorities do
The victim was wanted by the locals so the whole thing got shoved under the carpet Cajun-style
They didn't even stick him in juvy

Three years behind but  catch up
Sounds like things are goin' okay' now
They were
For awhile
When 'm twelve mom dies
What happened
Delilah Jane Haynes hung herself in the bathroom of the brothel
Could have saved herself the trouble
Post-mortem check uncovered last stage syphilis
Where's yer' father
Red's face tells us he's listening
Nobody knows where he is now
Ditched when  was six
He was a small-time felon
Popped up again after Mom died -- he'd just been paroled
Moved us back to Amarillo
year later 'm in trouble again
Yeah
Kill somebody else
Took a joyride in a Ford coupe that just couldn't resist
Hell, that's no big deal
Judge gave me four years in Gatesville, toughest juvy farm in Texas
That's where the son-of-a-bitch learned to be a criminal
Seen that before, ain't we, Red
Red doesn't answer
He seems in a faraway place

Where 'm going isn't as important as 'Why am  going there
' (tired of the game) Shit
'Caus' 'm runnin' and they're chasin' and 'd jus' as soon go north as south as east as west
It's a fun lil' parlor game, lady, but right now Butch Haynes don't have the slightest idea where he's headed

An inch is 24 miles
Hold yer' pointin' finger along the line of the road
You got three lines on your finger, don'tcha'
Each one's an inch
So how many inches to Childress
Phillip holds one finger to the map, then another
One, two

Something catches Phillip's eye

Butch is hard to make out, but there's no mistaking the Casper outfit Phillip wears with pride
You said the boy stole a Halloween costume

mile or so away sits a home -- a small ranchhouse
Phillip returns with the bag and pores through it
How's it look
soda
some gum
half a Moon Pie
Rations for one at best
Come on
Butch strides straight into the rocky field
Phillip lingers a moment, then sticks the half eaten moon pie in his mouth and follows, hurrying to catch up
117                                                            117 thru                                                                  thru 122                                                                   122 122A

Now yer sure that gooseneck had a safety chain
Suttle turns and glares
Yes
Red walks slowly toward the slumping Airstream from inside, then
Adler sticks his head out of the door and calls to Red
() 76
122A :                                                         122A Governor's hot line, Red
Governor insists that he have the mobile home back for the parade tomorrow
Red just stares at Adler, then sighs, removes his hat and scratches his head
(isn't it obvious
) Tell 'em to come and get it
123
-                                             123 Butch continues his hell-bent brisk pace in the field of dirt clods
It's all Phillip can do to keep up
Where we goin'
We're goin' trick r' treatin', Phillip
Phillip stops dead in his tracks
Butch, sensing that the boy is no longer following, stops, spins and faces Phillip
What
We ain't allowed to trick r' treat
Huh
My mama don't allow it
Trick r' treatin'
Why not
Against our religion
Against yer' religion
What kind of foolishness is that
Jehovah Witness
Butch picks up a dirt clod and hurls it as far as he can
He sighs and turns to Phillip
() 77
123   :                                                    123 Now, 'm askin' you, Phillip
ain't askin' yer' mother and  ain't askin' Jehovah
Do you wanna' go trick r' treatin' or not
124
124 Butch and Phillip cross the dirt yard and make their way to the door
Ok, Phillip, all ya' gotta' do is knock on the door and when they open it you say 'trick or treat
' Got it
They arrive at the door
Butch nods at Phillip who  the Now wait til' they come
, 65 or so, like something from a Grant Wood, only smiling, opens the door and looks out on the pair through the screen door
(whispers) Now, Phillip
Trick r' treat
( ) Well ain't you the cutest lil' ghost ever did see
(whispers) Say it again, Phillip
Trick r' treat, ma'am
Well, seein' that Halloween was yesterday, guess you'll have to trick me
You missed the caramel popcorn balls  made up special
Butch smiles, pulls up his shirt and exposes the revolver stuck in his pants
(tune changed) Wait right here
Butch smiles and pats Phillip on the shoulder
His eyes are drawn to
() 78
124   :                                                     124 - which enters the house near the door
We   the telephone line  the house  a nearby pole
The Woman returns with an armload of anything she could find in the kitchen
Phillip gratefully opens his sack and watches as the Woman drops in a loaf of bread, a jar of mustard, candies, jams, butter and anything else she could find
Empty-handed she reaches inside the door, opens her purse and dumps her money -- a couple of dollars and lots of change into the bag
Phillip smiles
Thankyew
125
-  ( )                                125 Phillip, sack in hand, waves goodbye to the frightened old Woman, who shuts her door and locks it
Butch and Phillip make their way back across the yard
Never underestimate the kindness of the common man, Phillip
Butch reaches up and grabs the phone line, yanks it loose and tosses it aside
126
-                                            126 The Airstream is fast becoming a pig sty
Coke bottles, coffee spills, overfull ashtrays, etc
are everywhere
Adler holds the mike and stares at the thumbtacked map
(into mike) Spur 208 northbound
And 83 at Aspermont coming and going
(to Red) That it
Yeah
Adler moves to set down the mike and topples a cup of coffee
It spills on the floor
Suttle grabs a towel to wipe it up but realizing the futility of keeping the Airstream clean, he simply throws it aside
79
127
-  -                                         127 Butch drives while Phillip digs through the sack and comes up with a jar of mustard
You sure there's no meat in there
Spam maybe, Vienna sausages, anything like that
Nawsir
Well,  bet you can make us some mustard sandwiches, can't ya'
Yeahsir
Well go to it
Phillip breaks out the loaf of bread and lays out four slices on the dashboard
How many
Many as you want
Phillip   lays out six more slices
The dashboard is now covered   with bread
Phillip pulls out the mustard but has no knife
Butch pulls out a stick of gum and hands it to Phillip   to spread with
As they drive  along they pass a large, happy family (Mom, Dad, girl 5, boy 7)  picnicking in the dip of a long hill alongside the highway
From the look of their brand-new loaded down station wagon  they are on vacation
- Mesmerized by the family
- Ditto
He pulls his eyes back to the road, notices something
128
-                                                 128 Butch brings the car to a stop near the crest of the hill, sets the emergency brake, grabs the first completed mustard sandwich and gets out, leaving the Impala running
() 80
128   :                                                      128 Be right back
Don't be stingy with that mustard now
Phillip nods and continues piling the yellow goop on each of the slices of bread
walks ahead to the crest of the hill, the tallest hill in the county
He takes in the 360 degree view
His eyes settle on
as they wait their turn to pass a roadblock at the bottom of the hill
spreading even more mustard
Every so often he sneaks a peek back at the picnicing family
slips a little, then gives all at once
starts to roll backwards
Whooaaa
Butch
Butch
turns and sees the Ford rolling backwards, picking up steam back down the hill
Step on the brake
Put your foot on the brake
The middle one
panicked, slides over and grabs the wheel
Of course, he is too short to press on the brake and when he bends down
swerves off the road and onto the shoulder
() 81
128   :   (2)                                                128 headed by , 35, their Ward Cleaverish father, looks up to see
barrelling backwards toward them, swerving to and fro and followed by Butch shouting instructions
(
) Everybody, run
Quick
makes a beeline for the station wagon
' Forget the car, Bob
Are you crazy
It's only got a 1000 miles on it
He jumps in the Driver's seat of the  and frantically it just as
gains control of the wheel and steers the rapidly reversing Ford around the Wagon
continues backwards to the bottom of the hill, but it has enough steam built up to head backwards up the other incline of the previous hill
comes to a heaving halt next to Bob, who is near heart attack himself
Bad brakes
That was close
Bob gets out of the station wagon and stands next to Butch
They watch for the Ford for a second, see that it's losing momentum and smile at each other
() 82
128   :   (3)                                                  128 Bob Fielder
Edgar Poe
breathes a sigh of relief as the Ford loses momentum and comes to a stop
But then, of course,
like any car on a roller coaster, starts to move downhill, slowly at first, but then picking up speed
Had me scared silly
've only had her two months
She's a beaut, all right
Say,      Bob, what with my brake problem and all,      sure would appreciate a lift
Me'n my boy      live about five miles up the road here
can pick up the car tomorrow
They notice the Ford coming back down the hill and squint to see
coming straight for them, gaining speed, with Casper the friendly ghost behind the wheel
chuck the small
Bob looks for a place to hide
- Screaming at the top of his lungs
- Staring straight ahead at Phillip
Butch doesn't even flinch, standing his ground in the middle of the road, staring straight into Phillip's oncoming face
The brake, Phillip
Step on the brake
Hard
() 83
128   :   (4)                                               128 totally freaked, jumps down on the floorboard and pushes with both hands on the brake
bring
to a  halt inches from Butch's kneecaps

Helluva job, Phillip
Never had a doubt
- Smiling back
crawls down from the luggage rack on top of his wagon and smiles a sigh of relief

As the car   approaches the roadblock Butch grabs a blanket, reclines, and   hides behind a stuffed animal
Sorry for the inconvenience, Edgar
The kids like the back down like that so they can play
No trouble at all, Bob
131
-                                            131 Bob brings his precious car to a gingerly stop
He pulls out his license, shows it
Why the roadblock, Officer
Escaped convict, sir
Just a precaution

Bobby Lee sits on a nearby rock, still whittling at his stick
It's starting to resemble something

-                                              133 As in the old Westerns, it's quiet, too quiet
The      inside of the  is pretty much trashed now -- the product of     men working in close contact
Sally stares at a file
The silence is broken as Red spits tobacco juice into an     empty Coke bottle
Sally peruses a file
- It's Butch's again
She's reading an addendum page with stamped at the top
photo of 14-year- old Butch is stapled in the corner
Sally finds something very interesting
She looks up at Red
He returns her stare
What

-                                              134 Bobby Lee finishes his whittling, blows away shavings, smiles at his creation, sets it on the rock, gets up and walks away

(to Red) They've got two Highway Patrol cars they can give to us now
Tell 'em stand by
We got the     best seat in the house right here
Have     the southern roadblocks call in the    dogs and move north
Check every road,     every farm from San Angelo to Sweetwater

He knows he's hemmed in
predict we'll have him singing a different tune by nightfall
136
-                                                136 The red station wagon creeps along the highway to the whistled strains of "Old MacDonald had a Farm
" 137
-                                          137 Butch, truly "singing a different tune," whistles "Old MacDonald
" Bob joins in and soon the whole damn Family Bob is whistling the tune
Bob's daughter , 5, red hair, freckles, starts jumping up and down on the back seat, singing and spilling her drink
' You're spilling
You're spilling
Bob and his Wife immediately turn around
Patsy
Look at what you're doing
Ahhh noooo
Bob's wife grabs Patsy by the arm and shakes her
Butch con- tinues to whistle softly, almost eerily, but he's watching closely
' Look at what you did
It's all over the seat of your father's new car
The little girl    starts to cry while Bob grabs at tissues feverishly and    hands them to his Wife who, leaning over the seat is wiping    hard at the stain
She grabs her daughter's arm and shakes    her, staring into her face
Butch, directly behind the little girl, watches closely
' What is wrong with you
told you twice not to jump up and down
Didn't
Patsy bawls harder than ever
Bob's Wife finishes wiping and reseats herself in the front seat
() 86
137   :                                                     137 ' (to herself) Damn that kid
The little girl is crying harder than ever now
Bob reaches back over the seat and tries to touch his daughter
It's okay, sweetie
Daddy's not mad
' So much for the new car smell
The little girl muffles her tears
Butch smiles sincerely then looks to the passing landscape
This will do fine right here, Bob
But do have one more favor to ask
138
-  (  )                           138 The entire Family Bob is standing along the roadside, their luggage and belongings by their side
The looks on their faces say it all -- Stranded
Butch hands over the stuffed animal to Patsy, pats Bob Jr
on the head and sticks out his hand to Bob
Just a loaner, Bob
Not to worry
You'll get her back
Bob reluctantly shakes Butch's hand in an attempt to impress upon Butch his most important concern of all
Please, it's new
Hold it under 45
at least for the next 500 miles
You know  will, Bob
Butch gives a snappy salute and is off to the wagon
139
-                                        139 Butch  the  and he and Phillip slowly pull away
Wave, Phillip
Phillip does so
Bob's kids wave back
Phillip starts to giggle

Maybe, but Bob did the right thing
What if he'd put up a fight
mighta' had to shoot him, and where would that family be then
Naw, Bob's a fine family man and that's about the best thing a fella' can hope to be
Butch floors the wagon and the   rubber on the highway
cringes as he watches his pride and joy rocket toward the horizon

At Aspermont
What
Coerced a motorist
Red sighs
Well goddam, shout at Amarillo
Tell 'em we got a notion he's headed their way
Adler gets right to it

Nobody in the room expected to hear this
got work to do back home
Red rises and stretches, walks to the open door and stares out at the late afternoon light
'm hungry
This thing got any food
Well, uh
Adler jumps up and goes to the frig
Got -bones in the frig, Red
Uh, uh, those were stocked for the Governor
don't think that he would approve of
Adler finds a plastic bag in the freezer and inspects it
-- And look, Red
Tater Tots
Those kind you like
Red turns and looks

to reveal that Phillip is firmly tied to the luggage rack of the station wagon, which is rocketing across the winding plains of West Texas
to reveal Butch, having almost as much fun as Phillip, hooping and hollering as he steps on the gas and weaves to and fro trying his damndest to hit every bump

Eileen turns to walk away
If you need me, 'll be right over here

She splashes a little water on her face and is startled when
Bobby Lee slides in behind her
Think yer' pretty smart now don'tcha'
She doesn't back down, instead looking him straight in the eye
Excuse me
Well yer' not smart but you are pretty
Sally stares right at Bobby Lee then moves for the door
He shifts his position and blocks her
Excuse me
Bobby Lee smiles a crooked-tooth grin, refusing to move
Work and pleasure should naturally go together don't you think
Take me, enjoy my work

She takes this opportunity to slide between Red and Bobby Lee on her way into the main room
As she goes
'll just wipe its ass, herd it through and you can cut off a hunk
How'd that be
Maybe medium-rare
Bobby Lee and Red are left standing face to face

You're here for one reason and one reason only
Anything else, Chief
Yeah
Yer' in my office

Bobby Lee flinches first and moves back into the main room
Red follows
That's the Governor's line, Red
Red calmly walks past Sally who smiles a "thanks"
He gives her a one finger to the hat salute, walks to the phone, reaches down and yanks out the cord

She giggles and licks her lips
Butch feels eyes on his back and looks at Phillip, who immediately turns away from them
When Butch returns his attention to Eileen she's moved a few feet away and is refilling ketchup bottles
Buzz, go ahead and chew on mine if you want
No thankyew
Eileen slides back down toward Butch
She makes refilling condiment bottles the sexiest pasttime since the hula hoop
Very polite
try hard but, ya' know, since his mama died
-- My mama's not dead
Butch, a tad annoyed, turns to Phillip and gives him a look
Once again, when he turns back, Eileen has moved
She's flirting with Butch, moving, bending, wiping her hands on her hips
His eyes are focused on her every squirm
(over his shoulder) Okay now, Buzz, you go on out in the parking lot and chunk some rocks or something
Phillip reluctantly slides down off the stool and slowly walks out the door
His eyes stay on Butch and Eileen, barely concealing confusion mixed with a hint of jealousy
So is she dead or not
(covering badly) Well his biological mother is alive
Gave him up for adoption to me and my wife
My dead wife, that is
She is, was Phil, er Buzz's stepmother, so she's his mom, was his mom, stepmom, but
she's dead

Eileen leads Butch by the hand into the room, closing the door behind them
At once they are all over each other
Butch lifts her up onto the desk and starts to kiss her face and neck
Then, in an instant, he flips her over, pulls the ribbon from her hair and unzips the back of her waitress outfit to the waist
He kisses her neck, her back and suddenly, passionately, he flips up her skirt and begins kissing her voluptuous backside

151B '  -                                     151B In profile Butch continues to kiss Eileen's buttocks
She moans in ecstasy

He moves down the wall to a window positioned right at the desk
When he stops he's right in front of the window, separated from Butch and Eileen by only a foot of air and a thin plate of glass

151D '  -                                  151D Kissing, writhing, but  this   all he can really see is a mane of hair swinging to and fro
Butch is out of sight but it's obvious that his lips continue  to caress Eileen's backside
She cranes her neck, arching   it like a swan, moaning like a wildebeast and then
She stops and stares
Butch continues to kiss but only for a beat, sensing the locomotive he's on has stopped at an unscheduled station
He slides his face from around her rear, a la Kilroy, and he stares, too
Except for their continuing heavy breathing they could be modern art statues staring
152A
-  -                                   152A Phillip's nose is pressed to the glass
In fact if he pressed any harder there wouldn't be any glass
152B                                            152B hold their pose for a second until
152C                                                         152C comes back to real time and bolts away into the darkness of the parking lot

Butch drives away libidinous desires, Phillip sits quietly, staring straight ahead, now and again stealing a peek at Butch
You mad at me
(curt) No
More silence
You kissed her, huh

Why
Caus' it feels good
Ain't you ever seen your mama kiss a man
No

You worked as County Sheriff in Amarillo and Austin before you became a Ranger
Right so far

Yeah, well, that's definitely the worst of it
Red uncorks his thermos and refills Sally's mug
She takes a sip and almost chokes on it
Strong

So Cecil
Red gives her a strong look
Red
What do you do when you're not at work
The file don't tell ya' that, too
Nope

Evidence given by a non-party with the intention of swaying the judge one way or the other
They're usually in written form, but there's no copy attached
Red doesn't flinch
Okay, then at least tell me why Haynes got four years for a joyride
What about probation
The boy had a home, a father
What's your file say about him
That he was a petty thief who did a little time, got out and stayed pretty clean
There are murderers 'd trust with my mother and petty thieves  wouldn't turn my back on
Your precious files are wrong
'm listening
Hayne's old man was a career criminal with a soft spot for whores
One way or the other he beat the hell outta' every person he ever crossed, screwed or fathered
Judge sends junior home with the old man and you can bet your last dollar that within a year he'll have a rap sheet as long as yer arm

Red stops, faces Sally

What's Texarkana like

Phillip and a tree house and
Mack, nervous, enters the room followed by Butch
Come on, Buzz
Time for us to hit the road
Whass' wrong, Mack
You look like you seen a ghost
Cleve runs up to Butch, turns around backwards and puts his hands between his legs
Do me agin'
(scared for the boy) No
Boy
Get over by yer' Mammaw
Lottie senses something is wrong
Cleve, too young to smell trouble, persists
Come on, Mister, do me agin'

Butch, instantly enraged, back-hands Mack, grabs him by the collar and tosses him onto the floor
Phillip -- frozen, sitting, watching as things go from bad to worse
Cleve -- confused, bawling, afraid
Butch pulls    the gun from his pants, bends down, picks up Mack by his    throat, presses the gun in his mouth and lifts him into a    chair beside Lottie
He bends close to Mack -- their noses    are inches apart
Why'd ya'   wanna' go and hit Cleve for
He didn't   move fast enough for ya', is that it
Or maybe he gets excited sometimes   and don't hear everything ya' say
You    make me sick to my stomach
Butch spits in Mack's face, then rises and walks over to Phillip and hands him the revolver
Point it at 'em
don't wanna'
Point it
Phillip does so, occasionally wiping a tear from his eye
Mack reaches down and holds Lottie's hand
Butch kneels down to a still-sobbing Cleve
Now, son, you wanna' flip
Cleve shakes his head "no" between sobs
Butch gently takes the boy and lifts him to a standing position
Go ahead
Put yer' hands between yer' legs
won't hurt ya'
Cleve turns to Mack and then runs to him
Butch walks calmly over and pulls the crying child away from the old man and back to the center of the room

You gotta' earn that, ya' know
(to Cleve) Put yer' hands 'tween yer' legs, son
Cleve,    still sobbing, does so
Butch reaches down and flips    him, all the while staring at Mack
Each time he flips    the boy, Butch reaches down, grabs Cleve's hands and flips    him again
Finally he allows the frightened child to go to Mack and Lottie
Butch takes the gun from Phillip
Buzz
Go out to the car and get that rope
Phillip stands frozen

Phillip slowly rises and walks away
He stops for a moment and turns his back
- His eyes lock in a gaze with
- His sobbing eyes plead for something, anything

He opens the door, stops, looks back

-                                                 182 Butch sits on the coffee table across from Mack, Lottie and Cleve
(to Mack) Now you hold that boy and tell him you love him
Mack grabs Cleve and sets him in his lap

Butch cocks the revolver and slides forward
His nose is almost touching Mack's
No, old man
Say it like you mean it
This boy know  loves him, mistah'
Then say it
Please, mistah'
gotta' sense about you
know you a good man
Nome',  ain't a good man
Ain't the worst neither, jus' a different breed

He holds the bag in his hand
Butch sits on the coffee table, which is pushed right up to Mack, Lottie and Cleve, who sit on chairs

-                                          184 Butch, enthralled with the episode he's directing, almost quivers with anticipation
Say it, Mack
Don't cost nuthin'
love you, Cleve
(serious) Gawd that's beautiful
Butch spots Phillip standing at the entrance to the living room with the bag
He takes it from the boy, empties the contents -- candy, cookies, bread, sugar and all -- and picks up the rope, takes Mack's Barlow knife from his pocket and cuts off a long shank
Butch takes the rope and begins to tie up the three

184   :                                                    184 Phillip stands, stares, aware that something bad is happening
Butch finishes tying, sticks the knife in his pocket and walks over to the
He turns it back
The plays
He turns  the
(to Phillip) You can go wait in the car or you can watch
Yer' old enough to think for yer'self
Phillip, unsure what to do, stands his ground
Butch returns to his seat   on the coffee table and stares at the three hostages
He    appears as if he's about to cry, closes his eyes and rests   his chin on the barrel of the revolver while he recites   instructions
Shut yer' eyes, Cleve
Mack, you and Lottie hold the boy tight
Shut yer' eyes, too
Phillip, awkwardly aware that he's going to witness an execution, starts to cry out, then squelches himself
Butch seems to be in another world now -- taken to another place and time
slight smile finds its way to his face, then disappears
Please, mistah', ain't no use in it
We'll give you ever'thing we got
But Butch doesn't even hear the words
He slowly opens his eyes, pulls his chin from the pistol barrel and points it at Mack
Our Father, which are in heaven, Hallo be thy name
(to Lottie) Shhh
shhh
shhh
Thy Kingdom come, Lawd, thy will be done
here on Earth as it is in Heaven

shhh
(to Mack/Cleve) Say it wif' me
Butch looks to Phillip in a strange way, sets the gun on the floor between them, and crawls amongst the candy, gum and wrappers until he finds the electrician's tape
Phillip watches, not knowing what to do
The revolver -- cocked, resting on the floor
,  & Giv' us this day our daily bread and forgiv' us, Lawd, our trespasses as we forgiv' those who tresspass agin' us
Butch rips tape from the roll and slaps a piece over each of their mouths, silencing their prayers one by one
Out of breath, he kneels down in front of them and stares at the three while he reaches his hand behind him for the pistol -- but it's not there
Butch looks up to see
Phillip -- teeth gritted, holding the pistol, pointing it directly at Butch
- His expression is blank -- then a slight smile
For a second it's as if none of this has happened, that Butch will grasp Phillip in his arms
turns his expression to blank
Phillip, knocked to the floor by the revolver's kick, recovers to his knees, shaking like a leaf
The   comes to an , but Butch falls back to his knees, still staring at Phillip
He looks at his stomach, where a stain of brown-red gushes through his -shirt, and back to the boy

184   :   (3)                                             184 Phillip, momentarily dazed, stares at the gun in his hand, at Butch, the blood pouring from Butch's side, and the shocked faces of Mack and his family
Then, in a flash, he runs, pell-mell, out of the house
185
-                                              185 Phillip blasts out the screen door and runs straight to the well
He drops the gun into the well, catches his breath and heads for the road
After a few yards he has a thought, runs back to the station wagon, grabs the keys and throws them as far into the adjacent field as he can
Then he resumes his race for the road
186
-                                              186 Butch gropes to his feet, still in shock
He stumbles toward the door, then stops, reaches in his pocket, extracts Mack's Barlow knife, holds it up and walks toward them, staring hard
Mack, Cleve, Lottie -- Afraid they'll be killed after all
Butch, surprisingly, meekly sets the knife down on the coffee table
Thanks for yer' hospitality
And walks away
187
-                                              187 Butch emerges and stumbles out
(to the horizon) Phillip
No answer
He drags himself to the station wagon and, with much effort, slides himself into the seat
No keys
He opens the door, crawls out, leaving a trail of blood, looks out to the road and starts to walk
runs down the road, looking back every so often to see if Butch is following () 121

He stops for a blow and looks back

Phillip crawls through the ditch beside the road and squeezes through a barb wire fence
His costume hangs on a barb
He rips away from the fence leaving a foot-long strand behind

What the hell
- clad in his white costume, running across a field toward a grove of trees beside the creek
Arch continues on down the road and passes
Butch -- nearly in shock, stumbling down the road
pulls into Mack's place, and Arch gets out, peers into the station wagon, sees blood, grimaces and walks up to the house
He notices a dripping trail of blood on the porch

He stops when he spots something -- a piece of white costume on the fence
He crosses the ditch, steps through the fence and walks in the same direction Phillip did
That was a helluva' thing to do, Phillip
You're a hero
Prolly' be in all the papers tomorrow, how you saved those folks
Truth is,  don't think  woulda' killed 'em
only killed two people in my whole life
One hurt my mama and one hurt you

After a moment of silence, Sally turns to Red

Yes, ya did

Funny thing
When the judge sent him away the kid stared at me

Not hard or mad like you'd expect

It was like he was forgiving me
Forgiving you for what
For looking at the facts and doing what you thought was right

Settle things man to man
Then we can be on our way
'll even let you drive
Knock that right off yer' list
How'd that be
finally arrives at the creek, looking over   his shoulder all the way
He looks at the water -- deep and    running swift
Where to go
He decides and heads for the    nearest tree -- a big oak, and shimmies up to a branch ten   feet or so above the ground

Something catches his eye
white figure moves slightly in the boughs of an oak tree
Phillip tries to climb higher but can't reach the next limb
Butch walks underneath the tree without even looking at Phillip
He sits down to rest
Alaska, Phillip
Wild and wooley
Man against nature
Me personally,  like them odds
(beat) Did  tell you my   daddy lives there
He's the one that   sent the picture postcard
Listen    here to what he says about it
Butch pulls the postcard from his back pocket and reads
(reading) 'Dear Robert'
that's my real name, Phillip
Robert
Jus' like old Bob the family man
'Dear Robert,  just wanted to tell you that me leaving has nothing to do with you
' Phillip, still afraid, can't help but listen as Butch suffers through his memories

Colder than hell most all the time

' Short and sweet
That's the old man's style
'Cold all the time' -- like that's a big sellin' point
He laughs to himself
He useta' pat me on the head and tell folks 'that it's some that can live life without askin' about it and it's others has to know why, and this boy here is one of the latters
' (beat) That's why  wanted to go up there
To visit the old man,  guess
Prolly' punch him one first, but then maybe we'd end up bein' friends, sit down, have a beer, talk things over
Butch groans
He pulls his hand from his side
Blood is oozing all over the place
He returns the postcard to his pocket
We'll jus' rest awhile

How's that

small puddle of blood drips and becomes a rivulet running down into the creek
Phillip, still in the tree, still watching, can't bear it any longer

One thing's for sure now --  definitely believe in ghosts

All things considered,  feel pretty good, though
Could use a beer, though
What's beer taste like

Red mulls it over, replaces his old chaw with a fresh one and looks to Sally
What do you think
Based on what's happened the past two days  don't think he would
One thing's for sure
If he gets outta' here with the boy, we're right back to where we started
If he kills the boy he'll get the chair
Shit, he'll get the chair anyway
He's killed two in two days
We don't know that he pulled the trigger on either of the innocent victims
Well he wasn't at home in his Strat-- Lounger

Phillip pulls it out
Butch snatches it and reads it to himself, laughing
He's on a death roll of sorts, between losing blood and being in an impossible situation he almost seems to be enjoying the macabre scenario as it unfolds
Phillip, on the other hand, is beginning to sob
(yells) And she's gotta promise to take him to the fair for rollercoasters and cotton candy whenever he wants
or at least once a year
wanna' go home
(checks list; yells) And when he gets older he gets to drink beer

208   :                                                   208 don't need beer
(to Phillip) Well it's on yer' list
(yells to Red) And to go out on dates with girls
(to Phillip) Not on the list, but you'll thank me later for that little addition
(checks list) Done that, got to drive, gonna' ride that rocketship
That's about it
(yells; to Red) She's gotta' promise or  won't let him go
wanna' go home, Butch
My mama's not bad
She gives me those things
Don't kid a kidder, Phillip

-                                           209 Red, exasperated, he can't believe how weird this has gotten
(yells) It's a deal
(yells) Make her say it
Red looks to Gladys as if to say, "go ahead"
She seems reluctant
Red's frustration is showing
210
-                                          210 Phillip is near tears
He rises and starts to move for the field, but Butch grabs him with one arm, pulls him close and holds him like he's his own child
jus' wanna' go home
(sincere) Know jus' how ya' feel, Phillip
135
211
-                                          211 (to Red) Phillip knows those things are against our beliefs
(to Gladys) What kinda' foolishness is that
(yells) She promises
(yells) Make her say it
Red gives her a look that says, "Say it or deal with me"
(yells) promise
212
-                                         212 (to Phillip) Can we trust her
She's a real good mama
Butch reaches into his pocket, extracts the remaining wad of stolen bills, unzips the Casper outfit, stuffs them into the costume and rezips
(to Phillip) When you get home, hide this
If she's lyin' you can buy yer' own damn beer
Phillip quiets for a moment and stares at Butch
Yer' not bad, are you, Butch
Yeah
(beat) Now, Buzz, listen here
want ya' to step out there real slow, keepin' yer' paws in the air
Then strut right over to them cops and yell 'trick r' treat
' Got it

212   :                                                     212 What are you gonna' do
Somethin'll come to mind
Butch sticks out his hand
Phillip shakes it, afraid
'Bye, Phillip
It's been one helluva' ride
Butch nods and smiles
(yells) All right, Cap'n
Make way for Casper the friendly ghost
The friendliest ghost  know
Butch nudges Phillip and the boy starts toward the field
213
-                                             213 Adler, looking through binoculars, can't help but smile
Gimme' them things
Adler hands over the binoculars
Red takes a look
- nee Casper, walking in his full whitehood, arms reaching for the sky
214
-                                                214 Phillip reaches level ground and for the first time sees the full strength of the amassed police forces -- at least 20 cars, swirling lights, guns everywhere, pointing at him
215
-                                             215 Red watches
(yells) Come on
Keep walkin'
- Phillip stops walking and stands perfectly still

215   :                                                   215 Red lowers his binocs
(to himself) Why the hell's he stoppin'
(to Gladys; direct) Call for yer' boy to come
Gladys, near shock,   commands to Phillip
"Come on honey," "Phillip, keep walking," that kind of thing
(: Her commands become more and more shrieking and frantic and continue throughout, giving rise to even more confusion than is already present
) 216
-                                              216 Phillip turns back and sees
Butch -- He tries to get up in an attempt to make a run for it, but his strength is gone
He collapses
Phillip, standing still, with his mother's shrieks filling the air behind him, watches Butch for a second then runs back toward him
217
-                                           217 Red sighs and lowers the binocs
218
-                                          218 Phillip stands before a struggling Butch
Personally  think we negotiated a pretty fair deal, but if there's somethin' else you want
(disbelief) Do they want to shoot you
Butch starts to lie to the boy but can't
219
-                                           219 finger strokes the trigger of a high-powered rifle
Bobby Lee -- Smiling, ready, waiting
Red shrugs and wipes his brow

219   :                                                     219 He thought better of releasin' the hostage
It doesn't necessarily mean that
(to Bobby Lee) Stay on ready
220
-                                            220 Phillip holds his hand out and helps Butch get up
Butch stands, dusts himself off, grabs the boy's hand and to- gether they walk toward the field
221
-                                             221 Red, through the binoculars
seen it all now
222
-                                                222 Butch and Phillip, hand in hand, walking across the field
223
-                                             223 Red scratches his head
What's he up to
Hell if  know
He's giving himself up
Keep in mind -- he still has the gun
(yells; to Butch) Butch
Stop and let the boy go
Put yer' hands up and let the boy go
(:     instructions from Red continue as well
) 139
224
-                                                224 With all the yelling, it's hard to make out what's being said
Butch and Phillip continue to walk and talk
So  guess that's it for Alaska, Phillip
225
-                                             225 Stop and put your hands on your head
Run, Phillip
Come here, Phillip
(to herself) Come on, come on
(a warning) Chief, we've got an armed killer and an innocent boy out there
(to Bobby Lee) You clean
As a whistle
Keep him locked down
Don't squeeze til' say 'when
' Red holds Bobby Lee's eyes until the young Fed nods
Then Red unstraps his holster and moves between the cars
Where the hell you going
But Red's not listening, just walking, long and tall, into the field
- Butch and Phillip continue to walk, Butch holding Phillip's hand
When Butch spots Red approaching he slows and then stops
Red shows his palms and keeps walking toward them
When he gets within 25 feet he stops
'm unarmed
Toss your gun on the ground

225   :                                                   225 Butch smiles
If  had a pistola 'd be headed the other direction
My partner here got rid of the evidence
(beat) Do  know you, friend
No
not really
Hmm
Well, look  wanna' talk to the boy and then we'll take care of bidness
How's that
Only take a second
Red nods then looks over his shoulder at the patrol cars lined up like a wagon train, guns aimed, Bobby Lee peering through the scope of his rifle
226                                                        226 Butch and Phillip
wanna' give ya' somethin'
227
-                                           227 He's stopped
He's gonna make a run for it
Give it a second
(to Bobby Lee) Hold him
(yells) Let the boy go, Butch
(to Bobby Lee) If he makes a move

228
-                                              228 Butch kneels down beside Phillip
He reaches slowly, pain- fully for his back pocket
Mebe' someday you'll get to go
229
-                                           229 Hendricks looks through the binocs
He's goin' for his weapon
Butch reaches into his back pocket
Red squints to make out what Butch's reaching for
Butch smiles as he retrieves the  from his pocket
look of concern crosses Red's lips
Sally realizes it's not a gun that Butch is reaching for
Noooooo
squeezes -- An  followed by a
Butch's chest explodes when the bullet hits him
He rocks backwards, still on his knees
and looks at Phillip in amazement
Phillip screams, grabs Butch and holds him up
Phillip is obscuring a second shot at Butch
tastes blood and sighs

229   :                                                      229 Damn, Buzz, shot twice in the same day
He collapses and falls into Phillip's arms
Phillip backs away two steps and falls to his knees
Butch wavers for a second then topples on his back
Phillip moans, sobs, as he watches Butch, the  still Gladys runs from behind the car, followed by a host of officers
Keep everybody back
Bobby Lee stands, lowers his rifle disengages and smiles at Hendricks
No need to worry
He can't hurt nobody now
Red stands frozen, staring, in another world
An trots up to Butch and does a careful ground frisk
(calls back) No weapon, Chief
Red "comes to," turns and walks toward the
Red walks   up to Bobby Lee, stops and stares at the grinning marksman
After a beat, Red turns then nearly jumps out of shoes with   a sudden right cross that floors the younger man
Red starts   to jump in for more but Hendricks, stunned, jumps in, grabs   Red and, joined by four other Officers, holds the older man   back
Shouting, i
e
"Hey, hey, Red, whoa, whoa
" Red settles a bit
Hendricks turns to Bobby Lee who rises to one knee and wipes at a bloody lip, and then to Red who is still breathing hard
What the hell was that all about
didn't say 'when

229   :   (2)                                               229 Red turns and walks away
Hendricks throws his hat to the ground, kicks it and follows Red with his eyes
(to no one/everyone) Goddammit
Adler catches up to Red
He stares at his old friend and boss as they walk along
thought he had a gun, too, Red
There was just no way of knowin'
Red doesn't even look at Adler, just keeps walking
Adler stops, his eyes following Red
Sally, nearby, watches Red walk away
is helped to his feet by his mother
She holds him dearly to her chest
He hugs back just as hard, his blood-stained Casper outfit staining her blouse
She unzips the costume and dollar bills fly all around
She starts to lead Phillip off but he won't leave until
He pulls the postcard from Butch's hand
- Staring down at Butch
- His eyes flutter a bit with recognition
Red leans against the car
After a few seconds Sally walks up and finds a spot a few feet down from him where she, too, leans against the car
After a few more seconds
You did everything you could
You know that
Red just stares straight ahead
don't know nuthin'
Not a damn thing

229   :   (3)                                              229 Red reaches into his pocket, pulls out his tobacco and stuffs a chunk into his mouth
-  - He licks his lips as the    around him
He squints hard and sees: as it lifts off and speeds away
As it wipes the sun
- slight smile crosses his dying face as he squints to see Phillip's flight
- Nose pressed against the glass bubble
His eyes don't close, still squinted but frozen
- We realize now, are lifeless
continues its flight past the sun
flares,  the  : that opened the film
