line at a time, the following quote appears over a black screen
Every blade of grass has its Angel that bends over it and whispers, "Grow, grow
" The Talmud : 1987 1                                                 1 blows a bright red scarf tangled high on a street lamp
An iron waste bin is blown sideways into an intersection stray dog investigates it briefly, urinates and then moves on
book bag drops onto the pavement
Visible from the waist down, a    in a disintegrating leather jacket turns the waste bin upright and then maneuvers it onto the sidewalk
Once finished, her thick hands wipe each other until they stop abruptly
Here, for the first time, we see her , , It is 16--
Something inside the bin has caught her attention
Precious gazes down upon a soiled and tattered paperback book as the breath from her nostrils steams
The title of the book staring back up at her is unintelligible
She pushes debris aside to get to it
The book plunges deeper into the trash, as if trying to flee
The sound of an   approaches
Precious pins the book against the bottom of the bin as the sounds of the oncoming car close in
Precious finally comes up with the book
Its title is still unintelligible
When she flips it over, however, the letters on the cover, which are facing us now, make sense
They read :

1   :                                                    1 The car sounds incredibly close
Precious looks sharply to her left
precedes an eerier
Precious, almost hit, falls back on to the pavement as her book skips across the intersection and down into a drain
She lays on the sidewalk pressed against the base of the street lamp with her eyes closed
The car reverses, skids, stops for a sec, shifts and off
The garbage bin, overturned yet again, rocks side to side until settling, to a stop
An ambulance eases up to the intersection
When the stoplight changes, the ambulance motors past Precious in no hurry
moment later, its sirens  and it speeds off into the distance
The stray dog returns, re-investigates the garbage bin, and turns to Precious
He licks her face
Tom Cruise walks up to her
Precious' still vacant eyes finally open to see Tom, and the red scarf falling from the street lamp towards her
Tom gives her a hand up
(flirtatious) What's your name girl
Precious blushes
What's your name
Precious still blushing, looks on the ground
(
) My name is Precious Jones

Mama said we can't afford it

Noise and projectiles fill the air
-         , stands at the head of the class trying to establish order
Class, would you please turn to page 122
Class

Precious' book stays closed as the other students find the page
in front of Precious giggle boisterously at some private joke
Mr
Wicher looks annoyed but accustomed to this
(
) like maff but  don't say nuffin' -don't open my book even
Just sit there
The giggling boys continue their shenanigans
Boys
The boys finally open their books
Page 122 please
(
) Everyday  tell myself something gonna happen, like 'm gonna break through or somebody gonna break through to me -'m gonna learn, catch up, be normal, sit in the front

The giggling flares up again
Precious sneers at the boys
Today we are going to review Monday's assignment
Would anyone like to begin
The boys get louder

The boys fallout slapping hands
The class turns to Mr
Wicher in unison to see what he will do
want to see you boys after class
# 2 Sorry Mr
Wicher but you ain't my type
Grow some tits
Just be quiet
Mr
Wicher tries to carry on throughout the boys' unrelenting defiance
Other students are continually distracted by the boys
Precious looks bothered the most as Mr
Wicher's soft voice loses the battle
(
) feels sorry for Mr
Wicher
He do his best but he ain't got no voice
He scared too
feels sorry for him
The boys break out in   until

3   : (2)                                             3 desk slams against the floor
The boys whirl around to see two large hands take hold of them and snatch them out of their chairs
Precious has had enough
Shut up motherfuckers, 'm trying to learn something

Precious shoves them down in their seats and huffs

Precious turns her desk upright and sits back down
Mr
Wicher looks grateful

) 'm like the polices for Mr

Someone is outside the classroom
Mr
Wicher waves her inside
, enters, squints to find Precious, points briefly and then whispers something to Mr
Wicher
Precious rolls her eyes

(
) What this bitch want
Claireece
Only motherfuckers  hate call me Claireece
Precious gathers her belongings
The other children watch every move in silence
When she reaches the front of the class
You gonna be okay Mr
Wicher
(forcing a smile) Of course Precious
Thank you
An unconvinced Precious grins sadly as Mrs
Lichenstein motions for Precious to step out ahead of her
Mr
Wicher looks abandoned
The door closing behind Precious might as well be to a prison cell block
Noise inside the classroom returns immediately
R4
-                                    R4 Precious heads off down the wide hallway in silence
R5
'                            R5 Precious waits among plants, plaques, pictures and file cabinets while Mrs
Lichenstein sits across from her reading from a file
Mrs
Lichenstein closes the file and sets it on the desk between them
Are you pregnant
You're sixteen, still in junior high school and pregnant with your second child
Correct Claireece
Claireece are you pregnant again
Precious stares at the file without responding
Do you have any thoughts about your situation
Precious shrugs her shoulders

R5   :                                               R5 Claireece

The hand on Precious' lap makes a fist
(
) Thas when  knew 'd never get back to maff class

Precious lunges from her chair and reaches over the desk
Mrs
Lichenstein vaults backwards in terror and tumbles to the floor

Lichenstein's office and walks to the exit
Mrs
Lichenstein's distant voice still cries for security

Precious, still waiting for the other shoe to drop, looks momentarily relieved and returns to the dishes until

Precious falls and lands

Moments later
(softly) Daddy
An enormous hand muzzles her
Precious lays there impassively as her vacant eyes fixate on a long crack in the ceiling
As we drift towards the crack it seems to widen -to open into another world where

Precious walks the red carpet with Tom Cruise
They head toward the entrance of the theatre stopping occasionally to sign autographs
Both sport matching sunglasses
The paparazzi is going wild

Her hands are still wet from the dishes
2 gallons of water splash down on her
Her eyes spring open
Mary stands over Precious with a large dripping pot in her hands
She drops it on the floor and returns to the couch to watch another program

Precious, now wearing a dry -shirt, tends to dinner meticulously until
The sharp sound of a  rings
Mary and Precious turn to the door in unison
Tell them assholes to stop ringing my bell

Wicher say 'm a good student
There is silent movement behind Precious
Mary approaches quietly wielding a skillet
Mary swings for a head shot but Precious easily sidesteps the blow
The refrigerator takes the hit and a new dent

Still aglow, Precious grins absently at her mother and then leaves the kitchen

We drift back to find Precious sitting on the side of her bed fully dressed with neon yellow leggings and her red scarf as she stares at the clock
Various sheets of colored construction paper display Precious' handprints on the wall

An older black man in a blue uniform sits in a chair reading the Daily News through thick glasses
He doesn't move, react, speak to or look at Precious as she passes him

The administrator stands over Precious waiting for an answer

Precious looks up to her blankly
Are you finished

What you want baby
Give me a basket please

Precious' eyes wander from the fry bin all the way over to a refrigerator towards the back
Ain't sure

Watchin' the weight you know
The woman chuckles and then leaves for the chicken

from inside follows

Precious looks back while sprinting and scarfing down pieces of chicken at a remarkable rate
Across the street, , Reggie's pregnant girlfriend, screams at him
Reggie, where you been
've been paging your tired ass all night
Reggie stops dead in his tracks
Shit
Busted
He lights up a cigarette, about faces and prepares for her rant
Nigga,  knew that was you
And who you running after, some fat bitch
Get your ass over here
Precious turns the corner of 126th street and onto Clayton Powell Jr
Boulevard still devouring chicken
sitting on a standpipe calls out to her

Cornrows speaks on the phone while picking her nails
Several lines are ringing
She waves from behind her desk as Precious walks by
(on the phone) What else would get away with clouding your mind, messin your heart and leaving the goddamn toilet seat up
Wait a minute girl
She decides to grab a line

She quickly catches her breath
Wipes her mouth and looks 10 feet away at a brightness coming from an open doorway
Her loudly
Precious stands up
She seems to be there for a considerable spell
blur of a young girl darts into the room from the other end of the hall without looking at her

Rain's desk sits before six smaller ones situated in a semi-circle
Four of them are occupied by girls roughly Precious' age: - , ,   - ,  , ,   , ,       and   - ,
She twirls her hair incessantly with slender painted fingertips
seventh desk sits well apart from the others back beneath the windows
The girls all stare up at Precious blankly as she enters the room
Precious looks to be in a mild state of shock as she gazes around from the girls to Ms
Rain to the clouds outside the windows
(
) First thing  wonder is where is everybody -the boyz, the noises this feel like a Sunday school or crazy house
or something like bof' but different
Smell different too
Precious' eyes land on the lone desk in the rear of the room

) Have a seat
Precious looks from the distant desk to one up front and then back to the distant desk
She sits with the other girls delicately, as if she were a visitor in a complete stranger's home

Rain finishes marking the roll sheet, places the cap on her pen and holds up a notebook identical to the one Precious left at the Kickin Fried Chicken
Does everyone have her notebook
Precious sucks her teeth in self-disgust as she looks around to find that all the other girls have theirs
-,   , then breezes into the room with an air of insubordination
It's 9:07

Jo Ann points into her mouth, which is full

After a moment

-                                    51 Precious walks off alone still beaming from the new world she has discovered (
) Before,  got  minus in English and never say nuffin', never do nuffin'
But Miz Rain say we gonna read and write in our notebooks every day
Thas sumthin' seeing how we can't really do none of those things and then  think maybe this ain' tha class for me
But when Miz Rain see the worry on my face, she look at me and start to talk in Chinese
The ghostly image of Ms

It is a glimpse from back in the classroom
Her voice

Rain vanishes and Precious shakes her head
(
) Whatever the fuck that spozed to mean

Jermaine writes  and then hands it to Consuelo
Consuelo writes  and hands it to Rhonda
Rhonda writes  and hands it to Rita
Rita takes a step and starts to cry
She drops the chalk
It shatters on the floor
We're all in this together Rita
Class
Rita picks up the largest shard of chalk from the floor and writes  on the board
She hands the chalk to Precious and Precious writes
The entire class sits simultaneously and then giggles at their synchronicity
This is just the beginning
Why don't we try by ourselves
There are 26 letters in the alphabet
They all have a sound
These letters make up all the words in our language
Please open your notebooks, write the date and then let's write the alphabet
The girls begin to write

She gathers herself, catches her breath and trudges on
(
) This is going to be painless

Rain sit close together over a small table looking down at a large colorful children's book
just want you to read a page from this book
Precious looks up at her blankly and then back down at the book with trepidation
(
) Sure lady, right after  get voted president

'mon Precious
Give it a try
Precious looks mortified and starts breathing heavily
-  , , ,  , , , ,   , , ,     ,  and all assault her mind's senses
Ms
Rain speaks with a dire look of concern on her face but no words come out
She places a hand on Precious' shoulder and the kaleidoscope of sounds sucks away into the air
The words from Ms
Rain's mouth finally register
Precious
Honey are you okay
Try to relax
Should  call an ambulance

Rain sighs
She sits back for a moment and looks as if she's processing more than just the tragedy of this particular situation but what is that of countless others
In a decisive, almost militaristic movement, Ms
Rain sits up again
think  understand you Precious but  still want you to try
You're going to have to push yourself
Precious looks back down at the page
There are people of various colors on a beach
What do you think the story is about
Peoples at the beach

It is the first word on the page
Do you know what that is

Precious wipes her hands on a dishcloth
The room is quiet and empty now
Precious stares blankly out of the window
She goes to the television, presses the remote and sits down
" " is still on
Tired and full, she turns the off
She watches Mary's face snoring rhythmically but with extremely unpleasant noises
Finally, she backs away and goes to her bedroom

Precious ignores it
The hand returns for another jab
Precious restrains a grin
Finally the hand tickles her fiercely

The hand belongs to Tom Cruise
He wears a leather jacket with a cherry red motorcycle helmet tucked under one arm
The helmet has a golden bow stuck on its crown
Precious chases him out of frame for some revenge tickling as they both laugh quietly
The helmet falls to the floor with a bounce

Toosie has a bag of groceries in her other arm
Precious watches  beside her mother
Both appear as if they've just woken up
Mary attempts to put on her wig and make up
Toosie gives Mongo to Mary, whose eyes never leave the television, and then hands the groceries to Precious, who takes them directly to the kitchen as Toosie leaves without a word
(
) Mongo

Sometimes  see vampires too
They come for me sometimes and they say that  am one of them
They say, "Precious, you belong wif us
" How do you respond to them
say, "Check wif my muver
" After that, they just look at me and go down through the floor
The family downstairs is vampires so that's where they should go
Ms
Weiss looks up from her clipboard and over her glasses
Precious reflects a moment and then looks up
'm going to the doctor now too
It's nice
Miz Rain, she fall out when she finded out that  ain' been to no doctor
Whole class scream 'preenatal' at me
They don't know  had my first baby on the kitchen floor wif my muver kicking me upside my head

Precious snickers reminiscently a moment and then turns to Ms
Weiss
Them the kind of thangs you mean when you say talk about whatever come into my mind
Ms
Weiss looks up and nods through a perplexed daze

Thangs and stuff before 's was made, before Mr
Abraham Lincoln, before Miz Harriet Tubman -maybe some stuff before Miz Weiss even
Precious and Rita fearfully enter the Tomb of Perneb

Rain writes briskly across the blackboard
As she makes her way across the frame, a barrage of letters and numbers peel off the board, fly across the room, converge and enter Precious' forehead

They are  , ,  ,  , , ,  ,   , ,  , , ,  , "", ""  ""
few letters, numbers and images try to reach Jo Ann but most just bounce off of her and fall away
Consuelo bats a few mathematical symbols off as if they were flies
Finally we land on Precious as she confidently stabs her hand into the air to answer a question

-                                           65 Precious rides on one of the side seats towards the back while wearing her red scarf
The New Yorkers surrounding her are all men of various backgrounds
All wear the exact same suits and raincoats
Precious looks up to find two of the businessmen staring down at her
We pan from them and around the bus to find all of the other passengers studying Precious in silence as well
(
) liked'd that museum so much  went back by myself

They only look when my belly big
They minds all made
But do they know
No
They do not know that  am a girl for flowers and thin straw legs

) If other peoples could see that the way  do, they would see that  am a real person inside
Our long circular pan finally lands on Precious' seat but sitting there now is the pretty blond white girl from Precious' bedroom mirror wearing Precious' clothes
The bus grinds to a stop

The original Precious takes the abandoned newspaper from his empty seat and tries to read it

(
) Miz Rain say the longest journey begin wif a single step
wonder what step they journeys begin on
Mama always talk about how there be all different types of welfare want filfy rich white folks welfare
Mama crazy but Mama not stupid
Precious continues observing pensively as the ladies pass a bearded and bedraggled elderly white man laying on the street in tattered clothes
As Precious studies him, her expression changes ever so slightly
Enormous handwritten letters forming " " overtake her face as we   the  upon which she wrote it

One by one, the other girls stop what they're doing and stare at Precious curiously
Their eyes turn downward in unison
Precious' legs
gush of water pours down between them as if it were a tidal wave

Fluorescent lights stream by overhead
Name tags dangle from the chests of attendants pushing the gurney
One we see belongs to a handsome African American Male nurse, He is constantly looking down with a reassuring smile
Covered in sweat, Precious screams without our hearing a sound

Her eyes focus intently and occasionally dart up and down
Nurse John is doing the same thing
His hands lay on top of Precious' with their palms touching
We glimpse both of their searching eyes again
Suddenly, Precious whips her hands over and  the back of John's before he can pull them away

The girls from class ogle him from another part of the room as he leaves and then nudge and bicker with each other for pole position to hold Abdul
(
) Dear Miz Rain, All the years  sit in class  never learn, but now got baby again by my fahver
Behind the girls, Precious sits up in bed writing in her journal

Precious snatches the journal and opens it quickly
(
) Dear Precious, It seems the opposite to me

Put your bags in the bed with you
Put 'em in
Tuck 'em in bed with you
The skinny woman on the other side sits up and grabs herself feverishly as if there were bugs allover her
-     steps up, snatches the blanket off of Precious and Abdul and walks off
Give the chile back her blanket
Fuck you
ain' giving back shit
The woman walks away
Physically and emotionally spent, Precious sighs and then lifts her bed's top sheet, beneath which is a plastic-covered mattress
She then wraps the sheet around Abdul and herself and hunkers down
Precious rocks Abdul gently as her eyes wander around the cavernous armory

Something nudges her slightly
When she finally opens her eyes
Abdul is gone
So is her bag
Precious springs up in a panic turning in every direction
Where my baby
Where my baby at
The Bug Lady casually points to the exit
The large ferocious woman heads for the exit with Abdul in one arm and Precious' bag in the other
She looks down at Abdul making "baby" faces and sounds
Precious dashes after her but winces in pain grabbing her pelvic area along the way
The Bug Lady follows Precious as a speed walker might
Precious snatches Abdul and promptly knees the ferocious woman hard in the gut
The ferocious woman  as she falls to the ground
Precious continues kicking and stomping her without abandon
The bug girl observes stoically
Abdul
As she trounces the woman, Precious' eyes fill with a rage we haven't yet seen
Finally, two other women pull Precious away while she still kicks at the woman
The ferocious woman, now bloodied, falls over on her back with her eyes closed and her mouth hanging open

Ms
Rain rises, walks to Precious and rubs her back as she looks around to the other girls who are still stunned
Your baby okay
The class waits on pins and needles
Precious doesn't answer at first and just looks down until
Yeah
He good
Won't bress feed him no more to be safe
(to Precious) One time in your journal you told me that you had never really told your story
(softly) write
Precious' eyes well up some more
She wipes her face again
What for
How
feel like  am drowning inside a giant river Miz Rain
Thas what
Precious stops herself abruptly as if being overwhelmed by a sense of futility
think telling your story will get you over that river Precious
Precious erupts hurling her journal sharply across the room
It bounces hard off the blackboard and stops abruptly on the floor facedown
' , The class looks shocked
Precious' wet eyes are filled with fury

Rain walks calmly across the room, retrieves the journal and places it back on top of Precious' desk
Open your notebook Precious
(exasperated) 'm tired Miz Rain
know you are but you can't stop now
You gotta fight through this
You still have to live your life and do the best you can with the hand you've been dealt
If not for yourself then for the people who love you
Precious  cynically
Nobody love me
Thas a lie
People do love you Precious
Please don't lie Miz Rain
Love
Me
Love rape me, beat me, call me animal, get me sick and make me feel wurfless
had enough love
That wasn't love
There are people in this room who love you
Your child loves you too
Is that clear Precious
Now if Rita decided to just give up
Would you let her
Precious doesn't answer
Would you
(reluctantly) No
And why not
() 93
125   : (4)                                            125 Precious doesn't answer
Because you love her
as much as she loves you
Precious looks to her side and finds Rita smiling reassuringly through her crooked teeth
Now the rest of the world can judge you, cheat you, beat you, dismiss you and abandon you all it wants but we won't let you give up and that's the only thing that matters
Some people have less than that on their side and still manage to keep going
(beat) It's up to you
Precious thinks a long moment, wipes her face and exhales
She doesn't move for what seems like ages
The whole class watches her until Ms
Rain motions for them to continue working
Finally, Precious takes hold of her pen, opens her journal, sighs deeply and starts to write again

Okay Precious
don't really want to read all wrote,  jus' wanna kinda say what it is 'm writing about and how it came about
What happened
Well, to make a long story short, the counselor at Advancement House quizzing me about Mama and Daddy etc

But it's really about workfare
She want to send me out as home attendant
How you know
Cause  stole my file from Advancement House and read it
The class

to work at some live-in job for some old-ass crackers
She'll never make a rise she get stuck in some shit like that
Sit up straight Jermaine and watch your language
Both of you
Please
Jermaine reluctantly sits up
Now  see your points, but is stealing
Miz Rain, If  didn't steal that file  wouldn't know what  was facing
You read the whole thing by yourself
Yeah
basically
Rhonda home attend
Say old bitch would ring a bell when she want Rhonda in the night
Rhonda used to have to go all the way out to Brighton Beach where she work for them people
The people had her there all day and night - 'on call' they call it
But you only get pay for 8 hours so that's 8  $6
37 (referring to her notebook) = $50
96 a day, but then you is not really getting that much cause you is working more than eight hours a day
You is working 24 hours a day and 50
96 divided by 24 is

12 by my count
Rhonda say old bitch would ring a bell - a actual bell -when she want Rhonda in the night
Home attendants usually work six days a week
would only see Abdul on Sundays
When would  go to school
(beat) Am  gonna hafta go be home attendant like Rhonda was
No
So stop worrying about it
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it
Trust me -no, trust yourself
My concern now is that if this Ms
Weiss is someone you're working with and can't trust, she's out
We gotta find somebody else
(beat) Well,  just write in my notebook till  get wif some kinda therapist can trust
Actually that always help me more than talking to her
Plus, 'm going to start going to meetings wif Rita for insect survivors
Incest

Precious looks around the room to find herself surrounded by understanding eyes
Anyway, thas all 'd like to say for today
