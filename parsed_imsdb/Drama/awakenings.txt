dusty deserted street - saloon, livery stable, sunset
Only there is something unsettling about it all
The colors are too muted and the angles not quite in perspective
Pulling slowly back eventually reveals the edges of a narrow wooden picture frame
-  - 1930 Drifting away from the painting and slowly across a room
Across Venetian blinds, open, letting in moonlight, across intricate handmade wooden models, dime novels and comic books, across the arm of a metronome gently slapping back and forth, and settling finally on a small hand writing slowly and deliberately, over and over, in synchronization, it seems, to the rhythm of the metronome, the word, "
" 2
-  - 1930 The pendulum of a clock
An adult hand placing a bowl of cereal on a table
Leonard, ten or eleven, waits a moment for the adult to leave, grasps his spoon, and manipulates it from bowl to mouth in time with the soft regular rhythm of the clock

-   -  - 1930                      3
Schoolbooks slung over their shoulders, Leonard and another boy his age, a classmate, move along a street
All around them are "visual rhythms" - lines in the sidewalk, the even placement of trees, the sunlight breaking through the branches above them - and somewhere unseen, the rhythmic pounding of an elevator train
As they climb a fence, a pocket watch, Leonard's, falls to the ground

-  - 1930 An adult hand chalking the words of a poem on a blackboard
Children at desks dutifully transcribing the lesson
All but one
Leonard
Whose hands are trembling slightly and whose paper is blank
There is a noticeable lack of rhythms
cold silence
The broken watch rests on his desk
The boy from the train, glancing at Leonard, begins gently tapping the end of his pen against his desk
Leonard, "guided" by the cadence of his friend's tapping, begins to write
(o   The teacher's hand at the blackboard hesitates
Distracted by     4
the rhythmic noise, he traces it to the offender and silences him with a look
\      ' Without the rhythm, and without, apparently, inner natural rhythms to replace it, Leonard's hand begins dragging the pen across the paper, forming vague scrawl, each word less defined than the last, until they begin melding together into what resembles nothing so much as a child's rendering of ocean waves
The teacher resumes chalking on the board
The boy from the train begins tapping his pen again, and, "guided" again by the rhythm, Leonard is able to give definition to the "ocean waves," to form recognizable letters
and words
The teacher hesitates again and glares at the boy making the irritating noise
The boy stops tapping and Leonard's writing again becomes formless

-  -  - 1930 The finished poem on the blackboard
The sounds of children at play on the schoolyard
The teacher, alone in the classroom, o    at his desk grading the penmanship lesson
He circles offending errors on the last page of the last composition book
He scribbles a grade opposite the student's name in a grade book
He notices the absence of a grade in Leonard's column
Leonard's desk
The teacher locates the missing composition book buried under textbooks
He takes it back to his own desk, opens it, and stares curiously at the last lesson, the poem, or rather Leonard's illegible representation of it
He considers earlier lessons in the book
He begins to see in the script a pattern of deterioration
He reaches the last entry again and stares at the few recognizable words drowning In "the waves

'  -  - 1930 - The painting on the wall
The intricate wooden models and dime novels
The Venetian blinds, closed, shutting out sunlight
Voices, barely audible, from somewhere else in the house: ' When can  see him

, When will he be well
After a moment -- ' don't know
-- and the sound of a door closing
small twisted hand lifts a slat of the Venetian blinds revealing the snow-patched street below
Leonard's friend, crossing it, glances back
then disappears around a corner
And the small gnarled hand lets the slat slide down, extinguishing the single ray of light

Behind an old oak desk, the hospital's Director glances over to its Chief of Medicine, Dr
Kaufman, with a look that seems to wonder, As opposed to what
Living people, yes

There's some mistake
And Sayer's chair begins to feel more * uncomfortable
He tries to clear up the confusion - ' m here for the research                                 * position

Sayer looks like a man who's just learned that everything he * knows about the world is wrong

The Director refers to stapled sheets of paper in his hands, Sayer's resume

Oh, yes

As the Director retreats back to the resume, hoping against hope of finding in it something germane, Sayer glances away to a window
He wishes he were outside it
He has no business being here
He should leave
Excuse me,  made a mistake coming here
Clearly you're looking for someone with more of a clinical background
He stands up to leave
Kaufman stands to see him out
But the       * director keeps searching the resume

You must have a hundred applicants more suitable
Thanks anyway
Back in medical school
Kaufman shoots the Director a look that says, No, we're not that desperate
mean, you couldn't have graduated without some clinical experience
Sayer hesitates
And eventually manages sort of a shrug and a n od
,            v' Well, there we are, doctor
Kaufman can't believe it, but is sent back a look that says, We have no choice
The Director gets up out of his chair, and, smiling broadly, extends his hand to Sayer
Which unsettles Sayer
Which in turn unsettles the Director
(not far from                 v begging) You do want the job, don't you
Sayer isn't so sure
He thinks about it long and hard

There's a kind a "deadness" in Sullivan's eyes and voice; he's been here too long
Not the neurologist, that'd be asking too much
You're not the neurologist

Sayer extends his hand
Instead of shaking it - Well, come on, Anthony, get him a coat for Christ's sake
- Sullivan thrusts his clipboard into Sayer's hand

Stepping around a wheelchair, Sayer finds in it an elderly woman, nicely dressed, her hair done-up, a ribbon in it
Glancing at the chart in his hand - Mrs
Cohen
Hes here
She smiles, glances around
Sayer hesitates, uncertain who she means
'm here
(pause) To examine you
Oh, no,  ' m leaving today
My son's coming to take me home
(6   Confused, Sayer tries to find a discharge form among the papers on the clipboard
Unsuccessful, he excuses himself from her and crosses the room to a nurse
Excuse me
Mrs
Cohen's son
He's coming today
1 wouldn't bet on it, he hasn't for twenty years
The nurse turns away
Sayer crosses slowly back to Mrs
Cohen, trying to find the words to tell her
He doesn't have to; his discomfort does it
Her hand slowly reaches up and pulls the ribbon from her hair

Institutional beige walls
Glass cabinets, locked, containing medical instruments

Sayer alone at one of three old desks in the large room, still unsettled from the experience with Mrs
Cohen
Eventually, he gets up, crosses to a window and tries to open it
It's jammed shut, painted shut perhaps, but finally gives way, sliding up
He lets the air from outside wash over his face as he stares out absently at children on an elementary school playground beyond a debris-strewn field
(a matter of fact) It gets easier
Sayer turns to the voice, to Miss Costello, the hospital's head nurse, a veteran of this place, a woman who has seen it all
She's standing in the doorway
You don't think it will, but it does

Cold eggs and toast and prescription medicine on a kitchenette table
puddle of coffee on the floor
Ceramic shards, a broken cup
An old woman on her knees, eyes closed, arms tangled in an aluminum walker, limp and stiff at once somehow, like the limbs of a discarded marionette
Beyond her, beyond a threshold, a shuttered living room
Furniture from another era and the clutter of a lifetime
shadowy figure in a wicker wheelchair near the Victrola
Another old woman, with spindly limbs, profoundly afflicted and preposterously still
The back of her head is flat and bald, the result of lying supine upon it for much of several decades
On her passive face rest round wire-rim glasses
Insane or retarded and unaware of the dead woman, she mumbles, just barely audibly, a melody
' Can you hear me
16 16
/ -  - Distant music of children's laughter
Perhaps real, emanating from outside; perhaps imagined, remembered, playing in a remote region of the woman's damaged mind
Arrested of all movement, she stares, transfixed, at the blades of a fan
' Do you know where you are
(nothing back) Do you remember being brought here
(nothing back) Do you know what has happened
If she does, she gives no indication
No word or gesture
No change of expression on her mask of a face
She is elsewhere (or nowhere), cut adrift by her illness, living in a private world (or hell)
' Can you hear me
Sayer, wearing a white lab coat, tries to read her eyes
Behind thick lenses, uncleaned for weeks or months, the eyes are inscrutable

Sayer reaches to her face and carefully pulls the glasses from it
He cleans them with a flap of his lab coat -- they are loose, bent out of shape*-- and gently slides the temples back over her ears
He turns away from her and types at a manual Underwood
The form in the machine, at the top, reads --   / /   /
Sayer types in a lower section headed --  /
He turns back in his chair to find the woman doubled-over in her wheelchair, one arm very close to the floor, the hand clutching the glasses
She is not moving, but she has moved
That, or she is dead
Sayer rights her, takes the glasses from her hand and slips them back onto her face
He studies her for a moment, and for that moment remains as still, as entranced, as her
He takes the glasses from her face again and sets them on the floor
He waits
She doesn't retrieve them
He picks them up and holds them out to her
She doesn't move to take them
He lets go of them and she lunges forward, catching them the instant before they hit the floor
Sayer just stares
Her name is Lucy Fishman

Dr
Kaufman, the hospital's Chief of Medicine, notices a number of patients lined up in their wheelchairs as he passes them on his way into Sayer's examination room - ' She was found by neighbors with                               * her sister, several days after the , sister had died

* Kaufman tries to feign interest
He glances to the others         1 Sayer has summoned to the room -- two other doctors, Tyler and Sullivan, and Miss Costello
And yet
Without any warning whatsoever Sayer tosses a tennis ball at her
Her hand suddenly jerks up out of her lap and catches it
And stays there, stiff, still
Sayer is delighted but the expression on Kaufman's face is that of one who has long ago learned and tired of simple card tricks
Dismissing the phenomenon -- reflex
If she batted it away  might call that a reflex
She doesn't bat it away, she catches it
-        It's still a reflex
:         '
"
' 'm sorry, if you were right 'd agree with you
Kaufman, understandably, takes some offense at the comment
Sayer, however, is unaware that he has caused any
It's as if
having lost all will of her own on which to act, she borrows the will of the ball
Awkward silence
Eventually-- The "will of the ball
" Sayer nods
Kaufman and the other doctors concur with glances that the theory and theorist are absurd
Excuse me
Sullivan has better things to do and leaves the room
So does Tyler
Kaufman and Miss Costello remain
(hopefully) You're trying to make a good impression
That's it, isn't it
You're still settling in
Sayer isn't sure if he should agree or not
He does neither
Miss Costello, you'll see that Dr
Saver's patients waiting out there are rescheduled for tomorrow
Yes, sir
Good night
Sayer watches Kaufman leave
So does Miss Costello
Lucy, looking less like a woman than a Diane Arbus photograph of one, doesn't

(puts on sunglasses) Three
(releases the brake) Four
(shifts out of 'park') Five
Just as he's depressing the accelerator, someone raps on his window
He slams on the brakes
Miss Costello's face appears at the window
Recovering, Sayer rolls it down
What'd  forget
just wanted to say to you preferred your explanation
()   It's unclear whether he knows what she's referring to
And that 'll look after things for you until you've "settled in
" Good night, doctor
She leaves
He stares blankly out after her, then at his dashboard
To it eventually, quietly -- Thank you
He glances to his rear view mirror and can see her walking away toward her car
To the reflection -- Thank you very much

They are in a ward crowded with many patients who are mad, obviously and irretrievably so
What did the voice say
"Mr
Titch, get your coat and hat, go up to the roof and jump off
" Did you recognize it as belonging to a person
Or was it just a voice
Sidney considers Sayer suspiciously
then smiles slyly

Sayer is taken aback
As is Sidney
One of them, and Sidney believes he knows which, is lying or crazy

Her state resembles that of Lucy's, that is, she appears to have no awareness of Sidney, Sayer, or anything else in her environment
It is only now, in fact, as Sidney spoons soup into her mouth, careful not to spill any, that Sayer notices her

And that it's the table, like a barrier, that has arrested her progress
He moves the table

And another before encountering and being "blocked" by an empty wheelchair
She stops
Sayer moves the wheelchair and all other obstacles out of her path
She continues and eventually makes it halfway to the fountain before mysteriously stopping again
Sayer studies the puzzle
there are no longer any barriers in her way, but she's not moving
Defeated, he goes to the fountain himself, fills a paper cup, and takes it to her
Across the room, a man in a wheelchair, another "ghost" (), stares through eyes which seem more dead than alive

Most died during the acute stage of the illness, during a sleep so deep they couldn't be roused sleep that in most cases lasted several months
The doctors, in the dark, watch forty year old footage projected onto a screen by a pre-World War  Bell & Howell - a motionless man in a chair, his head thrust back, mouth gaping open, arms suspended out from an emaciated torso as if from invisible strings
Those who survived, who awoke, seemed fine, as though nothing had happened
Years went by - five, ten, fifteen - before anyone suspected they were not well
They were not

Eventually, as if to excuse it and its maker-- It's different
Quite
It's quite bad
Sayer keeps studying it

Or was he unwilling to fail
He isn't really asking her to answer, which is fine with her since she doubts equally both hypotheses
Could he be saying, " can't draw a triangle, don't make me"
(before she can respond:) Could it be willfully bad

In a far corner of the darkened ward, in a pool of lamp light, two silhouetted figures
Sayer and Leonard
Sleeping patients all around them
Sayer carefully, awkwardly, places   his hand on Leonard's
After a moment, the contact brings   the useless appendage "to life
" As it slowly turns over and   grasps the doctor's hand, a glimmer of life seems to appear in   Leonard's eyes as well
Sayer, unfamiliar, it seems, with the feeling the contact produces in him, nonetheless places his other hand on Leonard's other
Soon it too turns and holds onto Sayer's
The doctor draws both of Leonard's hands toward him and sets them down on the pointer of an Ouija Board
'll begin moving the pointer toward the "
" For "Leonard
" Once  feel you beginning to move it, 'll stop and you'll take
over
Do you understand
Leonard, of course, cannot say whether he does or not
The look on his face is "thoughtful

'm beginning
The pointer begins to slowly move past stars and moons
Judging from Sayer's expression he begins to feel Leonard's movement of it and, presumably, stops his own
Yes, good
The pointer moves across the letters, but passes the "" without stopping
It stops on the "
" No
No,  didn't make myself clear
My fault
The pointer begins moving again, "interrupting" Sayer
It passes the "" again, reaches the "" and stops

" To the nK," where it hesitates briefly before moving again

Keeping one hand on the moving pointer, Sayer fumbles a pen from his shirt pocket and scribbles on his lab coat what Leonard has and is continuing to "write": 69
- Sayer alone in the examining room, standing over his desk
The lab coat is on it
And on it is scrawled: He has to study it only a moment before he sees the meaning of it; he quickly scratches out the last four letters,and adds a slash between the "" and the "," so that it reads: s/p           BmBJUP* 69A

When no one answers, the chemist glances over his shoulder
Sayer is there, quite alone, looking at him
Are you speaking to me
Sayer is
And really wants to know the answer
The chemist zips up and moves to the sinks to wash his hands
If jail the compulsions in the Parkinson's patient were somehow accelerated - (demonstrating what he means) - the hands, the shaking, the tics, the head bobbing, the quickening speech - (he's become a mass of tics and accelerated speech) - might they not cave in on themselves and, in effect, turn the person into stone
He comes to a abrupt stop, his eyes transfixed like a post- encephalitic's, staring

With all due respect,  think it's rather too soon to say that

What  believe, what  know, is that these people are alive inside

Sayer comes in with some books, sets them on Miss Costello's desk and crosses to a closet

Does it look like it
Sayer hangs up his jacket and slips into a lab coat
Do you know if Leonard's awake
She smiles and points toward the adjoining examination room

Coming in -- i Good morning
Good morning
His speech is still rather flat, halting

He hands Leonard the books
History books
An almanac
Some things have happened while you've been away
thought you'd be interested
Leonard opens one carefully, reverently, and begins reading from it to himself
You don't have to read them now, Leonard
They're yours
At your leisure
Leonard closes the book but holds onto it and the others like they're gold
used to read quite a lot
Before
i Yes,  know
Thank you for these
i
Sayer nods that he's welcome
Have you thought about what you'd like to do today
Everything
(smiles) 'm not sure  can arrange that
Try
Sayer smiles again
For a man who just yesterday learned he has been cheated out of the greater"- part of his life, Leonard seems to have recovered extraordinarily
Let's approach it this way

At a point, the doctor realizes his patient is no longer at his side; he's several steps back, feeling the sunshine on his skin

,  -                       102 (p\ Though it is only a Toyota, its dashboard, to Leonard, resembles something out of Jules Verne
He allows Sayer to buckle his seatbelt for him and watches with fascination as Sayer performs the "complex" preparatory sequence necessary, apparently, to make the car go
The car pulls away
Above, framed in a second story window of one of the buildings, stands a lone figure looking out -- Leonard's mother

'  -  -                          103 Tight on the radio

To Leonard's amazement, classical music fills the interior and  : 104
-   -                      104 Billboards advertising color televisions and electric shavers
Buses which have grown over the decades to a behemoth scale
"Ultra-modern" housing projects and gas stations
"Futuristic" cars
Leonard cannot imagine a more enthralling re-introduction to the world and stares at it all with wonder
Everywhere he looks there is something "extraordinary
" What a wonderful place The Bronx has become
The music  : ''   '                           * 105

, Leonard puts his face close to it to appreciate its fragrance
He touches its petals gently, explores them, and is quietly astonished by the tactile sensation
Sayer watches
He, too, can appreciate wonders of the real world, especially those of a botanical nature, but not with, the purity or intensity Leonard can
Pulling back reveals them in the middle of a vast garden of countless thousands of roses

'  -  -                             106 Leonard turns the radio dial from the classical station to another playing a very different kind of music, and listens to it bemused but intrigued

He retrieves it but has no idea what it is or what to do with it

Leonard, finally, glances away, up, to a sound overhead
The music  : 109 109

Tea bags steeping in a pot on a cluttered kitchen counter
Sayer, exhausted from the day, hunts in vain through packing boxes on the floor for crackers, cookies, something he can offer his guest
He keeps glancing in at Leonard, who's wandering around the dining room, navigating around packing boxes, to browse at the spines of books
Noticing Sayer watching - You just moved here
Yeah
Well, five years ago
, Sayer shrugs, disappears into the kitchen a moment
before            ; peeking back in to see what Leonard is looking at now: a small             i framed photograph of a boy with a toy sailboat and a forlorn expression posed in front of a curtain; the boat obviously a photography studio prop
Your son
Me, actually

Sayer disappears into the kitchen again
And a moment later glances back in around the door frame at Leonard who has moved over to an old sideboard on which several pairs of glasses are neatly arranged
Each has a specific purpose
10/13/89   p
59 As Leonard considers each pair of glasses
Those are my normal interior glasses
And spare pair
Those, wear outside
Two pairs, in case  los
e one
Those, those are my daytime reading glasses
And spare
Those are for close work
For fine print
Those are my nighttime reading glasses - Leonard's examining the frames of this last pair closely
That's heavy-gauge metal so when fall asleep and roll over on them don't wreck them
They're indestructible
Leonard returns the indestructible ones to their proper place and considers them all together
As long as  pretty much know ahead of time what 'll be looking ' at, it works out,  don't have to carry all five pairs around
What if you just want to go for a walk
(pause) Walks are a problem
Walks are the hardest thing
You just never know
He's absolutely serious, like a man plagued for years by an imponderable dilemma
He retreats back into his kitchen before reappearing again with the pot of tea, two mismatched cups and some saltine% on a tray
hope you'll forgive the inelegant presentation

There was extreme rigidity of the axial musculature
only vague available motion in the neck
no voluntary movement in the limbs
tight shot of Leonard's entranced face appears on the screen
Perhaps most striking was the profound facial masking -- which we now know should not have been confused with apathy
* Tight on Sayer, the light from the projector flickering on his face
Virtually aphonic, Mr
Lowe could articulate no words, but rather only, with considerable effort, an occasional noise, a kind of, "h
" In the darkness sit Kaufman, the rest of the Board of Directors, some elderly patrons of the hospital, and, near Sayer, Miss Costello
She hands him a scribbled note
"Less scientific" it reads
Isolated circumstances -- the mention of his name, notes of particular pieces of music, the touch of another human being -- managed on occasion to briefly summon him, but these awakenings were rare and transient, lasting only a moment or two
Sayer glances to Miss Costello
She nods, "Good, that's better
" The rest of the time he remained in a profoundly eventless place ~ deprived of all sense of history and happening and self -- encysted, cocooned, enveloped in this metaphorical if not physiological equivalent of sleep or death
Tight on the screen, on Leonard, as he was
Looking more like a photograph of a man than a motion picture of one
This was his condition when first seen by me in a remote bay of this hospital
And the quality of his life for the last 30 years
The "before picture" of Leonard on the screen is replaced with the "after" -- his eyes alert, his hands exploring a desk microphone
He glances up and off at something
() Now
' Whenever you're ready
() My name is Leonard Lowe
It has been explained to me that  have been away for
quite some time
He seems to withdraw, to wrestle with the thought, to try to somehow come to terms with it, to somehow resolve it
He nods as he finds within himself some source of strength and looks directly at the camera

Eventually one of the patrons, an old woman, reaches into her purse for her checkbook and a pen
Another patron, an elderly man, pulls a checkbook and pen from an inside jacket pocket
Another already has hers out in front of her
Sayer and Miss Costello exchange a glance
The room is absolutely silent, except for the muted scratch of pens on paper

They move along a silent corridor that seems to stretch out forever -- the doctor, the two nurses -- carrying themselves professionally, with sobriety and restraint

Moving slowly past the beds:  figure rediscovering the feeling of her skin; another, the sound of his breath; another,' the beating of her heart
figure still asleep
wakes
And for the first time in nearly half a century sees herself in the world

Though it's doubtful the man is even aware of her presence, she reads to him as if her were, and in the process, draws Leonard into the sound of her words until there are no sounds but her words: "Released from bondage and ridicule after seven destitute seasons, they raised the roof of Shea Stadium - while their fans attempted to dismantle it - in one of the loudest, wildest victory celebrations in baseball     : history - "

It isn't us that's defective, it's them
We're not in crisis, they are
We've been through the worst that can happen to a person and survived it
They haven't
They fear it
And they hide from their fear by hiding us, because they know, they know
The men wa it for the rest, but  eonard loses his tra in of t ho ugh t
ru str at ed, h is t ics r es urf ac e and ela bor at e
e seems unaware of them
To one of the men:
How long have you been here
* (the man shrugs) You don't know
month, a year
sj^                  (he doesn't know) (^7             Whv are you here
He doesn't know that, either
To another patient: - How do you feel being locked up
5 don't like it
You don't like it
Aren't you an animal
5 'm no animal
Then why are you in a cage
The man's getting agitated
they all are
Leonard stops pacing, faces them, and almost whispers: Anger

and suddenly, loudly, exploding: That's what you feel
anger
The men erupt in a burst of noisy approval; they cone alive
Tight on Kaufman on the other side of the "cage," watching
And, over the din - He's lived for thirty years in abjection and defeat

' '  - Sayer and Kaufman alone in the room, arguing - - He's lived for thirty years without the ability to release his anger - - So have the others - happen to think his behavior's
more natural than theirs - t Really - and his tics and paranoia
They're more natural - ; He's in that place
Oh, is that it - We wake him up, then lock him up, that's not "paranoia," that's a fact
've got 20 psychotics up there, "doctor," refusing to eat
They have no idea whv they're refusing to eat
How long should  let that go (on) - He knows why, hs
wants out

Hell, so do
Kaufman suddenly looks weary, as if all his years in this place have finally, at this moment, caught up with him
Eventually, calmly, evenly - Mr
Lowe is not the Messiah of Ward 5, he's a man in trouble
He wasn't "resurrected," he was administered a drug - by
you - that's fallen somewhat short of its "miraculous" reputation - The others are fine, they show no signs of - He's been  it longer
Sayer has no rejoinder
silence before: sympathize with him
've tried to accommodate him
But
will not let him endanger the health of other patients
He's resolute; it feels like a threat, or ultimatum
Trying t remain calm, Sayer changes tacks - 'll talk to him, 'll      explain t he problem
He'll listen       to (m e) - (Kaufman has to laugh) Without the drug, he's    dead

At least not on Kaufman
His eyes seem to go dead

Leonard's "bodyguards" step aside
Sayer crosses to Leonard and is greeted in a tone precisely that of master to servant, very courteous yet unmistalcably condescending: How are you today

That's the thing, isn't it, you never know who
Someone  least expect,  expect
Look at history
Every patient in this ward thinks there's a plot against him, Leonard
Yeah, well they're mistaken, they're crazy

The smile that appears this time on Leonard's face is as insane as anything Sayer's ever seen
He hesitates
Then: Something's wrong

Leonard abruptly extends his hand; it's a little twisted

Look at yourself, Leonard

But Sayer is looking at him, moving back and forth against the bars on a window, panther-like
He retaliates: The medicine can be taken away
' That can be done
You
can wake up                             " in the morning and it won't be there
The remarks seem to have no effect on Leonard

(~^\             My name is Leonard Lowe
It has been explained to me that  have been away for quite some time
Tight on Sayer,- alone in the darkened room, watching the footage, watching Leonard wrestling with the thought
() 'm back
Light moves across the screen
Someone has entered
Miss Costello
She exchanges a long glance with Sayer before they both look back to the screen
() thought it was a dream at first
Silence except for the sound of the projector
Then - '  () When did you realize it wasn't
Leonard thinks back, trying to recall the exact moment he realized he was "alive
n Finally -- () When  spoke and you understood me
One tear snakes down Saver's cheek
The film cuts to silent footage of Leonard, soon after his awakening, combing his hair and delighting in the fact that he cjan comb it
Quietly, without looking at Miss Costello -- You told him  was a kind man
(long pause) It's kind to give life only to take it away
There is self-loathing in his voice
On the screen, Leonard's trying to operate an electric shaver that seems alive
It's given and taken away from all of us
On screen, Leonard buttons buttons on his shirt and glances up smiling, proud
Tight on sayer in the dark room, the projector light flickering behind him
More to himself -- Why doesn't that comfort me
(quietly) Because you are kind
(pause) And because he's your friend
On screen, Leonard is beckoning to someone unseen
No one appears but he keeps beckoning
Finally Sayer, embarrassed and camera shy, appears
Though there is no sound, it is clear he asks, "What
" Leonard turns the doctor so that he is facing the camera, and points
Sayer again asks, "What
" "There," Leonard says
"Where
" Sayer demands
Finally, Sayer looks directly, curiously, into the camera

And the school yard beyond the field, quiet, deserted
Pulling back, panes of glass
Across the walls of the dayroom
Drawings and water colors, of people and: places
To the arm of the metronome slapping back and forth
And a twisted hand, a pen grasped awkwardly in it, writing excruciatingly slowly, and just barely legibly: &   * c # * * *   * * r i '   *   *  x\ Th e ha nd , an d th e mu si c, un fi ni sh ed , st op

His voice is flat, inflectionless
His eyes, with little life behind them, staring at the falling snow
He's in a wheelchair
Yes
Am  speaking
Yes
Leonard's eyes drift to a chair, his mother's chair, the one she has used for thirty years
It's empty
Your mother is well
She's home
She visits you on Sundays
Leonard slowly nods
Somehow he knows that
: f ~^               She's living her own life
, She's trying to
Leonard's eyes drift again, across to silent ghost-like figures in wheelchairs, the post-encephalitics, all of them, "asleep" again
They fought, as you did, with great courage
They were strong
Leonard looks down at his hands and feels one with the other
He looks back at the "sleeping" patients, not comprehending why they cannot do the same

Sayer is finally revealed seated beside him
He doesn't answer
Leonard's hands slowly reach to his face and feel its features
,x             'm here, aren't
His glance finds the tray beside Sayer, the paper medicine cup and empty juice cup on it
He must be back on the medication again
He looks back to Sayer, who's looking toward the window, to the falling snow
Eventually - Do you think you can walk

Dr
Tyler
The doctor turns
Fernando is walking toward him
You got a minute
(not really) What is it
Fernando arrives, leans against the corridor wall, and sort of mumbles -- You know that woman in Ward 7
Grace, uh
what's her last name Grace
(annoyed) Does it matter, Fernando
Sayer and Leonard walk slowly past, behind Tyler
Fernando's eyes briefly meet Sayer's
no

As they enter, the switchboard operator glances up, notices them, and glances back down without a word
They approach the front doors
They are almost there
From behind them, loudly -- Dr
Kaufman
Dr
Sayer
Sayer and Leonard stop just short of the doors
They glance back and see- Kaufman -and,v-several* steps
behind
him, looking distraught, Miss Costello
She has failed
Yes
The two doctors stare at one another for several moments
Clearly Kaufman knows what is happening
Clearly Sayer knows he knows
Eventually -- , Put a coat on him for Christ's sake
He turns around, walks past Miss Costello and down the corridor- from which he came
Miss Costello relaxes, turns around and walks away down the corridor
Sayer and Leonard turn and walk outside

Though Rolando is not playing, cannot play, the piano, he can hear it, distant, like an echo, as a nurse wheels him toward the windows
Other nurses and orderlies are wheeling Rose, Frank, Bert, and Lucy and the others there
Sidney is wheeling Lolly

They all "see" down below, standing across the street, Sayer and Leonard

Metal wheels over metal tracks
Leonard feels things
inside his coat pockets
He,pulls from one several capsules of -Dopa in a clear plastic bag; and from the other, a wad of money wrapped in paper on which is typed his name and "Bainbridge Hospital, Bronx
" He stuffs it all back into his pocket and glances up
: The train is crowded
Everyone seems to be hiding behind a newspaper or the veil of a glazed look; everyone but Leonard and the eleven year old boy seated next to him with his mother
They're taking everything in, Leonard and1 the boy - the rumbl of the train, the overhead lights flashing off and on again, the mounting excitement they both feel
The boy glances up at Leonard, and, like a secret - (a whisper) We're going to the city
(a whisper back)
Me, too

He stares in wonder at what lies before him
lights, skyscrapers, Christmas decorations, taxis, noise, people

Good night

Looks for something more to do
Clearly there's nothing more to do
He gets up
Wanders slowly around the room
Past the medical instruments in the glass cases, the tripod and projector, along tne waii covered with taped and tacked data, notes, Polaroids
Buried in it he sees Leonard's original perception test, and alongside it, the first Polaroid of him
Sayer abruptly moves to the window, yanks at it, but it's jammed shut again
Below he can see Miss Costello crossing toward her car
He fights with the window, finally frees it, slides it open and yells out loudly - Eleanor
She turns to the voice
He turns from the window
Tight on the glasses left on his desk

In the back of a taxi, Leonard stares out the window, mesmerized by all he sees
The driver glances back in the rear view mirror
How 'bout those Jets
Leonard glances at the rear view mirror and finds in it the driver's eyes
like them
Leonard glances out the window, a little puzzled, to the sky, to see if there's one flying overhead
Broadway Joe
The driver glances back to see what Leonard thinks of that
* Leonard nods uncertainly
Yeah
As they rattle along, Leonard peers back but the window at things going by, and absently pets the mechanical dog in his lap
Eventually - Youre not from here

The meter clicks over and into double digits
The taxi is parked across the street from a diner
don't mind sitting here if you don't, but to what end are we sitting here
Leonard watches a waitress in the diner, Paula, chatting with some young customers
His hand moves to and onto the car door handle, but then hesitates opening it
Paula is getting her coat and leaving with her friends
They have ice skates

- Prometheus stealing fire from heaven, dwarfed by the Christmas tree that towers over him
Figures glide past the statue
Skaters on the ice rink

Leonard's eyes
From the promenade he watches the skaters gliding gracefully over the ice
Hector appears at his side
: ' m sorry to bother you, Len, just thought you should know this is adding up, you know
Without taking his eyes from the skaters below, Leonard digs into his coat pocket and hands Hector a clump of money, hundreds of dollars
Embarrassed - didn't mean that, just - don't need it, you keep it
Hector puts the money back in Leonard's coat
Leonard finds Paula among the skaters, isolates her from them, and watches her glide around the rink
fine mist of snow is falling, veiling her
Beautiful, isn't it

At least let me give you a lift wherever you're going

Descending from a fire escape strung with a single strand of Christmas lights
down to the street below, to Leonard, moving along the sidewalk, noticing: young couple, bundled up, hurrying down the stairs of a basement apartment, fumbling with keys; Christmas tree too large for the doorway of an another apartment across the street, being tugged at by someone inside, unseen

His gait and tics, and especially the smile, make him look insane

Leonard
He's in a wheelchair, behind an oak desk on which rests, among other things, the Ouija board
His eyes open but do not appear to comprehend the doctor's presence or his surroundings
His expression is absolutely "expressionless
" ' m sorry to wake you, but there's someone here to see you
Leonard remains still
"Asleep
" And there's a long silence broken only by the sound of pages being turned
And then, from Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop" -- (reading) "Night is generally my time for walking
In the summer,  often leave home early in the morning and roam about fields and lanes
: ' "^             all day
Or even escape for days or weeks together
Leonard is unable to acknowledge in any way that he recognizes the words or her voice
but he does
And as she reads, the words become alive and the walls recede
"But saving in the country, seldom go out until after dark, though Heaven be thanked,  love its light and feel the cheerfulness it sheds upon the earth as much as any creature living
" And he is moving into the light
