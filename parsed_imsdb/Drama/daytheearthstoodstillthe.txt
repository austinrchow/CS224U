North Revised final draft February 21, 1951 -   -
- Backgrounded by palm trees and rolling surf, an American army radar operator sits at his huge instrument, intently tracking a target
Without interrupting this, he speaks with tense excitement into a telephone transmitter strapped to his chest
(It is 8:00 a
m
) (In this and the subsequent scenes, music and cutting build to an exciting crescendo)
-   -
- group of British soldiers, in shorts and tropical gear, are gathered tensely around a piece of radar equipment, which is tracking a target
The radar operator says something to another soldier, who turns and speaks excitedly into a field telephone
(It is 5:00 a
m
) - The microphone bears the word
An Indian announcer, his expression one of excitement and terror, jabbers into the mike in a native tongue
clock on the wall indicates that it is 2:26 - () - The plane is identified by a red star on the fuselage
- The radioman is tracking an object on his radar scope
He points it out excitedly to the pilot
The pilot adjusts his microphone and starts making a report back to his base in Russian
-   -
- group of French farmers is collected around a radio, listening wide-eyed to the keyed-up voice which is telling them, in French, of a strange object that has been seen in the sky
They exchange uneasy glances
One old man crosses himself
- breathless American radio reporter is speaking into his mike, but we can't hear what he's saying
On the wall behind him is a clock which reads 3:32
- clock shows the time to be 8:32
The British announcer tries to maintain his traditional  calm, but finds it almost impossible to control his excitement
Reports are coming in from all over the Empire -- from all over the world
The Government have not yet issued a statement, but there seems to be no question that there actually is a large, unidentified object circling the earth at incredible speed
This announcer keeps talking, but his voice fades out, and now we hear the words the American announcer is saying
(staccato with excitement) We still don't know what it is or where it's from - but we do know there's something there
It's been tracked around the world by radar traveling at a rate of four thousand miles an hour
- The driver and his fare are listening intently to the radio, as we hear the voice of another radio reporter
2ND (voice off scene) This is not another "flying saucer" scare
Scientists and military men have already agreed on that
Whatever this is -- it's something real
The attendant, who is filling a car with gas, leans around to hear the car's radio, oblivious to the fact that the car's tank is overflowing
3RD (voice off scene) We interrupt this program to give you a bulletin just received from one of our naval units at sea
" large object, traveling at supersonic speed, is headed over the North Atlantic toward the east coast of the United States
" Music builds to a climax and ends
4TH (with deliberately controlled calm) Here in the nation's capital, there is anxiety and concern, but no outward sign of panic
As a matter of fact, there are signs of normalcy that seem strangely out of place; the beautiful spring weather, the tourist crowds at the various monuments and public buildings
-   () small crowd of tourists is climbing the steps to the columned entrance
-   () Under this shot a barely audible, distant hum is heard
It grows in volume so imperceptibly in this and the next two shots that we are unconscious of it
-   () - Crowds are strolling on the Mall and across the well-kept lawns in front of the Smithsonian Institution with the leisurely, meandering quality that distinguishes sight-seers
Including several small groups of people moving toward the Smithsonian
Their attention is attracted as the hum off scene becomes a roar
The sound is unearthly in its intensity and almost unbearable in its swiftly increasing volume
The people stop in their tracks and look up in the sky in terror
Several people on the steps of the Smithsonian have turned to look
There is cold, frozen fear in their eyes
The awful sound keeps increasing in volume
man, following the progress of a huge object in the sky with his eyes
He is held terror-stricken
( ) giant shape, still at some distance, is approaching the earth at incredible speed
group of people run wildly across a large expanse of lawn
huge shadow cast from above onto the grass seems to be pursing them
( ) The great shape is considerably nearer now
Of a woman, thoroughly shaken, held immobile by what she sees and hears
People scatter madly in all directions as the huge spaceship comes in for a landing on a smooth, grassy area
The tremendous roar of its motors is suddenly cut off and the great ship settles gently to a perfect landing
- The gleaming surface of the ship shows no break of any kind -- no windows, no ports, not even the outline of a hatch
It is a fearsome, terrifying object, giving no evidence of its source or its intention
- ( ) Shooting down on a section of lawn, showing the varying reactions of people to the landing
Some are still running madly away; others, singly and in little groups, stand as though rooted, staring at the ship from a respectful distance
- As he stares at the ship with fascination and horror
He'd like to run but he can't
His mouth twitches and he emits a nervous little laugh
woman is holding a two-year-old child by the hand as she watches the ship, awe-struck
Several people run past them
Suddenly the woman grabs up the child with a little sob, turns and runs away
middle-aged man runs up to a group of several people, pointing wildly toward the ship and yelling irrationally: They're here
They're here
He runs off toward another group as we-- : series of short  showing: 1

Policemen piling into squad cars, which roar out of their garage

large telephone switchboard with the girls in a frenzy of activity as they try to handle the calls pouring in
: - The players are standing on the field in the crowded stadium, but the game has been interrupted and everyone is listening to the voice on the loudspeaker system
(Actual stock shot would be coverage of some dedication or ceremonial
) : - Brigadier General speaks in clipped tones into the telephone
There are a couple of other officers in the room
(into phone) Get me the Chief of Staff
: () shot, if one is available, of either House listening raptly as an announcement of great import is read by the Chair
: - distinguished-looking government official speaks into the phone with a sense of subdued urgency
want to speak to the President
(listens for a moment) 'm sorry -- you'll have to interrupt him
: - nationally known news commentator -- for purposes of this script let's say Drew Pearson -- is seated before a radio mike
He is also being photographed by  cameras
In a wall near him is a  screen which shows what is going out on the air
During the ensuing speech, a man comes in a hands him a sheaf of news bulletins
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, this is Drew Pearson
We bring you this special radio-television broadcast to give you the latest information on the landing of the "space ship" in Washington
- Government and Defense Department officials are concerned by reports of panic in several large Eastern cities
am authorized to assure you that so far there is no reasonable cause for alarm
The rumors of invading armies and mass destruction are based on hysteria and are absolutely false
repeat -- these rumors are absolutely false
The ship, designed for travel outside the earth's atmosphere, landed in Washington today at 3:47 p
m
, Eastern Standard Time
We still don't know where it came from, but  can reveal that military leaders are considering two possibilities; that it came from some unfriendly power here on earth -- or that it actually arrived from another planet
to and   on the  screen in the wall
On the screen is a shot of the space ship
' (over scene) The ship is resting exactly where it landed two hours ago, and there has been no sign of life from inside it
on the  screen
The cuts that follow are inside the frame of the screen: - Two platoons of infantry soldiers surround the ship, their rifles at the ready
' (over scene) Troops have been rushed from Fort Myer and they have formed a cordon around the ship
showing two machine guns, two Sherman tanks and two 75MM guns
The gun crews are posted for action and all weapons are trained on the space ship
' (over scene) They are supported by machine guns, tanks and artillery
- Cops are holding back a section of a large crowd, some distance away from the ship
The people are wide-eyed and tense with excitement
' (over scene) Behind police lines, there is a large crowd of curiosity seekers
1
Civilians in the crowd, their eyes and nerves taut with suspense
2
young soldier, who grips his rifle and moistens his lips nervously, his eyes never leaving the ship
3
tank commander blinks from the tension of staring at an unmoving object
4
The last cut is of the ship itself
' (over scene) As you can see for yourself, the Army has taken every precaution to meet whatever the situation may require
Every eye -- every weapon -- is trained on the ship
It's been this way for two hours and the tension-- - as he interrupts himself excitedly, his attention riveted on the  screen
Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen
think  see something moving
-
- We are at the actual location now, not looking at
We see the ship surrounded by soldiers, two medium tanks, two artillery pieces, and a couple of machine guns
Some distance away is a suggestion of the crowd of civilians, held back by police
Prominent in the scene are newsreel and television cameras
to
As it does so, we see a couple of metal objects rising slowly from the top of the ship
One, which is an oddly-designed coil of wire, slides up and revolves slowly
The other is a section of vented pipe with a convex cap on it
on the soldiers, their eyes glued to this first sign of activity from the ship
They shift uneasily, gripping their rifles more firmly
- After a long, tense moment, a ramp appears silently out of the side of the ship and slides down to the ground
There is an audible gasp as a man appears at the top of the ramp
He looks around at the crowd with cool and imperturbable dignity
This is
He is completely human in appearance
The only unearthly thing about him is his clothing
He wears a tunic that is very good looking, but at the same time thoroughly comfortable and practical
On his head is a metal helmet that obscures most of his face
(It would be impossible to identify him later
) The design of this helmet gives the impression that it is more a formal headdress than for protection
Klaatu is above all an impressive man -- a man of tremendous dignity and presence
He has the tolerant superiority that comes with absolute knowledge
of soldiers, people in the crowd, and policemen
The newsreel and  men are busy at their cameras
- After an impressive moment, he raises his arms in the universal gesture of neutrality
Then he speaks, in perfect English, his voice amplified as though through an enunciator
We have come to visit you in peace -- and with good will
Klaatu walks slowly down the ramp toward the soldiers
As he does so, he draws from inside his tunic a strange looking object, longish and tubular
It might be a a telescope -- or it might be some strange kind of weapon
shooting from the side, showing Klaatu advancing slowly toward the line of soldiers
He holds out the mysterious object in front of him in a gesture that is actually one of offering but could be misinterpreted as menacing
There is a growing, uneasy rumble of muttering among the soldiers as Klaatu advances
They are clearly frightened of what he may do
- young second lieutenant, standing in front of his platoon
As Klaatu advances, the lieutenant unslings his carbine
Klaatu starts toward the platoon leader, raising the object he holds toward the man, trying to make clear his intentions
Misinterpreting this as a menacing gesture, the platoon leader raises his carbine to his shoulder
of one of the tank commanders in the turret of his tank
He is watching Klaatu advancing toward the platoon leader and he has drawn his pistol
Convinced that the lieutenant is in jeopardy, the tank commander aims at Klaatu and fires
as Klaatu falls to the ground wounded
The object he was holding has dropped from his hand and smashed
The soldiers start to gather around Klaatu excitedly when suddenly there appears in the entrance to the space ship a huge robot
There is a gasp of amazement from the crowd and the solders draw back at sight of him
The robot is ten feet tall, is made in the almost-perfect image of a man
He is to be played by an actor and his flesh appears to be made of a greenish metal
His eyes flash as though lighted internally
His perfectly- fashioned, muscular body is covered only with a loincloth
This is
There are cries of amazement as Gort walks slowly ponderously, down the ramp to the ground
As he does so, the ramp closes behind him
Gort's face is, and always remains, utterly expressionless
He stops to look at Klaatu, lying on the ground
Then he looks around at the soldiers, the tanks and guns
All the guns have been traversing to follow him
- From inside him there comes an ominous crackling sound, as though power were being generated within him
His eyes flash toward the tank from which Klaatu was shot
- There is a great metallic clatter and the Sherman tank is suddenly reduced to a pile of junk metal, its parts completely disintegrated
Only a piece of tank track and twisted gun barrel emerge from the heap on the ground to identify what had been there
The tank's crew has remained unharmed
- The crackling sound continues as his eyes start to sweep in a semicircle taking in all the troops
- Gort, with the back of his head in f
g
, to follow Gort's sweeping gaze
In a growing crash and clatter of metal, every weapon in sight is destroyed
The two machine guns are little heaps of junk
The 75's are larger heaps
The second tank, like the first, is a three-foot pile of scrap
Rifles have dropped from the soldier's hands and lie on the ground as little mounds of wood and metal
None of the men has been harmed, but their faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced
- as they react to the full shock of what has happened
Most of them stand rooted to the ground
Several laugh hysterically
few break and run wildly
- Sudden pandemonium breaks out
Utterly terrified by what they have witnessed, the crowd becomes a wild, milling, screaming mob, concerned only with escape
- He is walking slowly, deliberately, menacingly toward the tank commander who fired on Klaatu
Standing by the debris of his tank, the man is immobilized with terror
The robot starts to reach out to grab him
- lying on the ground
He speaks to Gort sharply, in a strange language
Gort
Deglet ovrosco
- He pauses obediently in the act of reaching out for the tank commander
Dropping his arms, he stands motionless and remains that way
- He has raised himself to a sitting position on the ground, his wounded shoulder giving him considerable pain
The two platoon leaders come into scene hesitantly, badly shaken by the awesome demonstration of power they have seen
They are uncertain as to what they should do
The platoon leader eyes the smashed object on the ground curiously and turns questioningly to Klaatu
With great dignity, Klaatu picks up the broken object, which we see well for the first time
It is a delicately-made tubular telescope, badly smashed
On it are indications of small electronic gadgets
It was a gift
For your President
(glances at the broken object ruefully) With this he could have studied life on other planets
Klaatu lets the object drop with a shrug of mild exasperation
The two lieutenants exchange a helpless look of bewilderment
Then Klaatu raises himself to his feet painfully, holding his wounded shoulder
As he does so, a colonel and a captain come into scene
(to the lieutenants) Is he all right
Got hit in the shoulder, sir
The three junior officers exchange ineffectual glances and look to the colonel, who thinks for a moment before making his decision
Send for an ambulance
Get him to Walter Reed Hospital right away
Yes, sir
: -    - There is a door to the corridor and a door to Klaatu's room
In the small sitting room, talking in tones of hushed concern, is a group of men
There's a Major General, a likable man with a chest full of ribbons
There are also a Colonel in command of the hospital, a high-ranking police officer, a couple of medical officers and two civilians
The conversation is interrupted by the entrance from Klaatu's room of a Medical Corps Major, followed by an Army Nurse
(to Major) How is he
He's all right, General
Blood pressure's a little high, but it could be aggravation
(wryly) Can't blame him
always get mad when somebody shoots me
He still wants to see the President
(to General) We informed the White House over an hour ago
(to Major) Didn't drop any hints about where he's from, did he
No, sir, he didn't
The door to the corridor opens and a worried young Captain enters
Excuse me
(to the Colonel) What about the reporters, Colonel
They're swarming all over the lobby
The Colonel turns, in deference, to the General
(quietly) Tell them there won't be any statement tonight
Yes, sir
(glancing down the corridor) Mr
Harley's here from the White House
Harley appears in the doorway, a brief case under his arm
He's a dignified, intelligent member of the White House secretariat
He proceeds uninterruptedly into the room, nodding cordially to the General
General -- (indicating Klaatu's room) Right in there, Mr
Harley
Harley proceeds in businesslike fashion to the door
He knocks and then enters
- as Harley enters, closing the door behind him
Klaatu no longer wears his helmet and we see his face clearly for the first time
Even sitting up in bed, with his shoulder strapped in bandages, he is a figure of great authority
His face reflects inner dignity and assurance
Harley, who is a hardened diplomatist, can't help being impressed by his present assignment and a little awed by Klaatu
Harley obviously has been sent by the President to find out what he can
Klaatu's eyes study him, cool, penetrating, reserved
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President (Klaatu continues to study him silently) 've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr
Klaatu
(coolly) Just Klaatu
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened
We all feel-- (evenly) Sit down, Mr
Harley
Somewhat relieved, Harley seats himself
He speaks with a half smile, hoping to ease the tension
'm sure  don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise
(getting a little smile from Klaatu, he is encouraged to do some fishing) Had you been traveling long
About five months -- your months
You must have come a long way
About 250 million of your miles
Harley glances at him quickly to be sure he's not joking
He's not
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from
(easily; he's a diplomat, too) From another planet
Let's just say that we're neighbors
Harley reacts, as his wildest assumptions are so blandly corroborated
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor
'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way
(eyebrows raised) The present situation
mean the reasons for my coming here
(his eagerness apparent) We're very curious about that, too
Would you care to talk about it
'd be glad to
(noticing that Harley is settling himself expectantly) Not now, of course -- with you alone
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President-- (somewhat sharply) This is not a personal matter, Mr
Harley
It concerns all the people on your planet
(Startled by the scope of this statement) -- 'm not sure  understand-- want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth
(shocked and perturbed by this notion) 'm afraid that would be a little awkward
It's -- it's completely without precedent
And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances
(coolly) traveled 250 million miles
What about your United Nations
(Surprised and a little puzzled) You know about the United Nations
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years
That's how we learned your languages
Lately, we've been getting your television also
(wryly) You must have a rather strange impression of us
(smiling) The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle
Harley smiles
Then his mind reverts to the seriousness of the situation and he speaks gravely
'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world
Surely you would agree-- (evenly) am not concerned, Mr
Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet
consider that to be your business -- not mine
was only hoping to make you understand
(sternly, impressively) My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles
It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth
(uncomfortably) Perhaps if you could explain a little-- intend to explain
To all the nations -- simultaneously
(his manner precludes opposition) How do we proceed, Mr
Harley
Harley is thoroughly shaken
The tremendous force and power implicit in Klaatus's manner preclude the possibility of argument
(after a long thoughtful moment) We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly
But of course the  doesn't represent all of the nations
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State
(helplessly, but patiently) Believe me, you don't understand
They wouldn't sit down at the same table
Growing a little impatient with such nonsense, Klaatu eyes him evenly, speaks with Jovian authority
don't want to resort to threats, Mr
Harley
simply tell you bluntly that the future of your planet is at stake
suggest you transmit that message to the nations of the Earth
The eyes of the two men meet for a long, silent moment
Then Harley rises quietly
will make that recommendation to the President
(he picks up his brief case and hat) must tell you in all honesty that 'm extremely dubious about the results
(with a half-smile) Apparently 'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are
've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have
(he bows) Goodnight, sir
He turns and goes out
- He stares after Harley for a moment, puzzled by this strange and apparently unreasoning world he has come to
He shakes his head in thoughtful, tolerant bewilderment
: -   - Searchlights have lighted up up the eerie shapes of the space ship and Gort
circle of soldiers guard the area, while a crew of men can be seen working around the ship
- Master Sergeant of Engineers, dressed in fatigues, is inspecting the side of the ship carefully
He has an acetylene torch in his had and a welding helmet over his face
The Major General, previously seen in the hospital sitting room, enters and speaks to the Sergeant
Getting any place, Sergeant
(raising his helmet) No, sir
(shaking his head in annoyance) Beats me, General
saw that ramp come out of the side of the ship -- right here
Now  can't even find a crack
man named Carlson, a civilian metallurgical expert, comes into scene
The General nods to him
What's the report, Carlson
(discouraged) We've tried everything from a blowtorch to a diamond drill
(nodding toward Gort) What about him
He's made out of the same stuff
, Has he moved
No sir
Not an inch This is the toughest material  ever saw, General
For hardness and strength, it's out of this world
(with a wry half-smile) can tell you officially - that's where it came from
The two men exchange an uneasy glance, then turn to look at the ship
: Two Medical Corps officers, a Captain and a Major are interestedly studying a series of -ray films
The skeletal structure is completely normal
(pointing) Same for the major organs - heart, liver, spleen, kidneys
And the lungs are the same as ours
Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure
(nodding, toward Klaatu's room) How old do you think he is
Oh, 'd say forty-five
(smiling) He told me this morning when examined him
He's seventy-eight
don't believe it
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty
How does he explain that
He says their medicine is that much more advanced
(the major stares at him blankly) He was very nice about it
But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor
The door to Klaatu's rooms opens and Major White appears
He's the man who attended Klaatu the day before
He closes the door behind him and stands motionless facing the other two, his face wearing a blank expression
took a bullet out of that man's arm yesterday
What about it
(utterly bewildered) just examined the wound and it's all healed
What does he say about it
Said he put some salve on it -- some stuff he had with him
(shows them a small, odd-looking tube in his hand) What are you going to do with it
Take it downstairs and have it analyzed
(on his way to the door, shaking his head) Then  don't know whether 'll just get drunk or give up the practice of medicine
As he starts out the door to the corridor, he passes Mr
Harley, who is on his way in, carrying his ever-present brief case
Harley is accompanied by an enlisted
Afternoon, Mr
Harley
Afternoon, gentlemen
Harley goes to the door of Klaatu's room, a businesslike expression on his face
He knocks on the door, then enters
The
remains in the sitting room
-   - as Harley enters
Klaatu is up out of bed, walking around in a Medical Corps robe and pajamas
He appears to be completely recovered
Good afternoon
(surprised not to find him in bed) 'm glad to see you up and around
Thank you
Have you any news
Not very good news, 'm afraid
(digs into his briefcase for some papers) The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night
(grimly) Let me read you some of the replies
(he selects a cable and reads) "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow
" (with a grimly-pointed glance at Klaatu, Harley reads another cable) "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time
Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington
" (he looks up at Klaatu and shrugs) Well -- there you have it
Harley extends a sheaf of cables for Klaatu's inspection, but he ignores them
Klaatu has listened to this recital, first incredulously, then with mounting indignation
Conscious of his quiet, Olympian wrath, Harley continues uncomfortably
tried to make you understand
The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust-- (uneasily, under Klaatu's level gaze) Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power-- It's not your government 'm thinking about
It's your world
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President (sternly) will not speak to any one nation or group of nations
(sharply, bitterly) don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions
Our problems are very complex, Mr
Klaatu
You mustn't judge us too harshly
can judge only by what  see
Your impatience is quite understandable
(sharply) am impatient with stupidity
My people have learned to live without it
(ruefully) 'm afraid my people haven't
(with real sincerity) 'm very sorry --  wish it were otherwise
Reluctantly Harley has picked up his hat and brief case
He finds Klaatu staring out the window
- As he looks out the window thoughtfully
What he sees has given him an idea
- shooting down, from Klaatu's viewpoint, at people strolling about the hospital grounds
Most of them are civilian visitors, but there is a sprinkling of nurses and ambulatory patients
- As Klaatu turns back to Harley, he speaks thoughtfully, incisively
Before making any decisions,  think should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes
Under the circumstances 'm afraid that will be impossible
Harley has paused near the door, a little embarrassed by Klaatu's level gaze
must ask that you don't attempt to leave the hospital
Our military people have insisted on this
'm sure you'll understand
With a polite nod, he goes out
Klaatu stares after him as he realizes that he is in effect a prisoner
He shakes his head slowly, thoughtfully
The ways of this planet are strange indeed
-    - Harley has paused to watch as the
takes out a key and inserts it in the lock of Klaatu's door
-   - As he hears the click of the lock, he turns toward the door
Realizing they've locked him in, he smiles with tolerant amusement
: -    - In the dim light of one lamp, the door to the corridor opens and a nurse enters carrying a tray of medication
She is accompanied by the same
as previously seen
The nurse pauses as the
takes out a key and inserts it in the lock of Klaatu's door
To his surprise he finds that the door is not locked
He exchanges a glance with the nurse, then pulls the door open and hurries inside
as the
crosses the unlighted room toward the bed
The only light cones from the open door to the sitting room
The 's eyes go wide as he looks at the bed
It is unmade and unoccupied
Terrified, the
turns to the nurse, who is standing in the doorway
He's gone
The
dashes out of the room, through the doorway past the nurse
She turns to follow him as we-- : - series of short , showing: 1

The headline reads: "  " 5
Radio announcers chattering excitedly into their microphones 6
series of close-ups of people listening to the radio
Their faces reveal their awestruck terror

terrified mother drags her two children in from the street through the front door, slams the door and bolts it
: -
- is on the back of a man dressed in a business suit, who is walking along the sidewalk of a dimly lighted, almost deserted, middle-class street
He carries a suitcase and he glances idly at the drab-looking stone facades of the old two-story houses
As he passes, from the open windows of the houses come the voices of radio announcers
We get a sentence or two from one house and then, as the man and our pass on, this voice fades and another is picked up
We get the impression that everyone is glued to his radio
(over scene) --authorities at Walter Reed Hospital refused to comment on how he managed to escape, or what measures might be taken to apprehend him
--these fantastic descriptions of the creature are denounced as rumor by police Chief Walter Baxter
He is not eight feet tall, as reported -- nor does he have tentacles in place of arms-- --there's no denying that there is a monster at large -- that we are dealing with forces beyond our knowledge and power
The public is urged to take ordinary precautions and to remain calm, as we await further developments-- --three separate reports of people who claim to have seen the "space man" in the past hour
One from Des Moines, Iowa; one from a village in northern Florida; and one from Chicago
the man as he pauses under the light of a street lamp, and reveals that it is Klaatu
He has stopped to look at something out of scene
from Klaatu's viewpoint, of a sign on one of the houses, reading: - He seems to hesitate, debating a plan he has in mind
He raises his right arm to scratch his head thoughtfully, and notices for the first time a small tag, or ticket, attached to the inside of the right forearm of the coat he is wearing
Puzzled, he pulls off the ticket and looks at it
- It is the sort of tag a cleaning establishment attaches to clothing
Printed on it is the legend: Scrawled in a penciled hand is the notation: Dr
Carpenter, Bldg
- Walter Reed Hospital
Cl
& pr
$1
- He smiles wryly at this reminder of where he got the suit, and he destroys the ticket
He glances down at the suitcase beside him
- It bears the initials
Klaatu's hand comes into scene and lifts up the suitcase
as Klaatu carries the bag toward the house and mounts the stone steps to the entrance
-   - There 's no light in the room except what splashes in from the hall
Gathered around a television set are five adults and a little boy, their faces eerie in the reflected light from the screen
The room is done in average boardinghouse style -- antimacassars and all
The attention of the people is riveted on the television screen, where a newscaster is reading a bulletin
--while the President made no effort to minimize the crisis, he urged people all over the country to remain calm
He said the entire facilities of  and other federal agencies are being bought to bear
He pointed out, however, that this is no ordinary man hunt
He warned we may be up against powers that are beyond our control
The landlady, a stern-faced woman of middle age, named
, rises nervously and crosses to the television set
(tensely) can't stand any more of this
It's enough to drive a person crazy
She snaps off the set sharply
, a bright-eyed, eleven-year-old, is seated beside his mother,  , an attractive girl of thirty
Disappointed that the set has been turned off, Bobby's roving eye has fallen on something in the doorway to the hall
Wide-eyed, he nudges his mother and points
Hey, Mom -- who's that
including the doorway to the hall
Silhouetted motionless against the light from the hall is the figure of a man
All eyes follow Hobby's pointed finger, and there is a stifled gasp as they are startled out of their preoccupation
One of the men turns on the lights and Klaatu is revealed standing calmly in the doorway
There is a shocked silence for a moment, then Mrs
Crockett speaks
(apologizing nervously for the tension in the room) -- 'm sorry
What is it you want
My name is Carpenter
'm looking for a room
There is a noticeable letdown in the general tension, during which Booby has been studying Klaatu, his imagination working overtime
Are you an  man
No -- 'm afraid not
Helen has stepped forward to make Bobby desist
Bet he is, Mom
Bet he's out looking for that space man
(with an apologetic smile at Klaatu) think we've all been hearing too much about "space men
" Mrs
Crockett reverts to her role as landlady
She likes to think of her house as a home
(starting the introductions with Helen) This is Mrs
Benson, Mr
Carpenter
(with a smile that would split a brick) And little Bobby
(indicating a middle- aged couple and a younger but more wizened man) Mr
and Mrs
Barley -- and Mr
Krull
'm Mrs
Crockett
There are polite noddings and how-do-you-do's
Mrs
Crockett is satisfied that she's established a cozy atmosphere
(pleased to the point of challenge) Well -- this is our little family
(then, getting down to business) have a very nice room on the second floor
She leads the way toward the hall and Klaatu starts to follow, picking up his suitcase, when he is intercepted by Bobby
Can  help you look for the space man
Can
(excitedly) know what he looks like
He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes
(good-naturedly, calming him down) That's enough, Bobby
think it's time you went to bed
(to Bobby, with a prop smile) We mustn't annoy Mr
Carpenter -- or he won't want to stay here
She goes on into the hall, followed by Klaatu, who has exchanged a polite smile with Helen
as Mrs
Crockett leads the way up the stairs
He's really a dear little boy -- and quiet as a mouse
(with a shrewd, chatty smile) You're a long way from home, aren't you, Mr
Carpenter
How did you know
(pleased with her cleverness) Oh,  can tell a New England accent a mile away
: -   - Five of the boarders -- Mr
and Mrs
Barley, Mr
Krull, Helen Benson and Klaatu - are finishing their Sunday morning breakfast
Mrs
Barley is a middle-class Helen Hokinson lady, form and unrelenting
Her husband is a born complainer
Mr
Krull is a shriveled little accountant, precise and finicky
As they finish their coffee, all except Helen are immersed in the Sunday papers
Helen seems preoccupied with her own thoughts
From a portable radio on the table comes Gabriel Heater's voice
' --and so, this Sunday morning, we ask the question that's been plaguing; the entire nation for two days now: "Where is this creature and what is he up to
" If he can build a space ship that can fly to Earth -- and a robot that can destroy our tanks and guns -- what other terrors can he unleash at will
Obviously we must find this monster
We must track him down like a wild animal and destroy him
-
' It is a full page layout, in the style of the American Weekly, showing a demented artist's conception of a mass invasion of space ships
Weird-looking creatures are slaughtering Earth people with ray guns
The caption at the top of the image reads: "Are We Long For This World
" (Gabriel Heater's voice continues uninterruptedly over this and the next two scenes
) - He is reading his paper with considerable interest
- The third-page story reads: Professor Jacob Barnhardt, world-famous scientist and Nobel Prize winner, has invited fellow scientists from all over the world to meet with him in Washington and study the recently landed "Space Ship
" - His face is thoughtful as he finishes reading
This story seems to impress and interest him
Then suddenly he finds his attention caught at what the Radio Voice is saying
' But where would such a creature hide himself
Would he disappear into the north woods
Or would he slither off into the sewers of some great city
Klaatu has a reaction of affronted dignity at this monstrously distasteful idea
: ' There is grave danger -- everyone agrees to that
The question is what can we do to protect ourselves
What measures can we take that will-- During the above, Mrs
Barley has turned to her husband in sharp annoyance
George,  wish you'd turn that radio off
'm trying to concentrate
Mr
Barley reaches out and snaps off the radio
(snorting, he tosses his paper down) Why doesn't the Government do something -- that's what  want to know
(mildly) What can they do
They're only people -- Just like us
People my foot
They're Democrats
It's enough to give you the shakes
He's got that robot standing there -- ten-foot tall -- just waiting for orders to destroy us
(thoughtfully) This space man -- or whatever he is
We automatically assume he's a menace
Maybe he isn't at all
(glaring at her for this silly notion) Then what's he hiding for
Why doesn't he come out in the open
Yeah
(indicating the radio) Like the fella says: "What's he up to
" Maybe he's afraid
(with a derisive snort) He's afraid
After all, he was shot the moment he landed here
(she pauses for a moment thoughtfully) was just wondering what  would do
(to Helen, helpfully) Perhaps before deciding on a course of action, you'd want to know more about the people here -- to orient yourself in a strange environment
(sharply) There's nothing strange about Washington, Mr
Carpenter
(quietly, tongue in cheek) person from another planet might disagree with you
If you want my opinion, he came from right here on Earth
(with significant emphasis) And you know where  mean
They wouldn't come in a space ship
They'd come in airplanes
(as though with superior knowledge) wouldn't be so sure about that
(delivering the final word) Stands to reason that fella wants some thing or he wouldn't be here
(facing Klaatu) That make sense, Carpenter
Klaatu pauses for a moment, then recites pleasantly
must admit 'm a little confused
Mrs
Crockett enters and speaks to Helen
Mrs
Benson -- Mr
Stevens is here to see you
Oh -- thank you
She rises and goes out
Finish your coffee, George
told the Carsons we'd be there at eleven
-   - as Helen crosses the room to greet
He's a personable young man with a breezy manner and considerable charm
There is between them an easy air of Intimacy
(smiling warmly) Good morning
Tom kisses her
We're all set
picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car
And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today
(a little disturbed) There's only one thing --  haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby
(tentatively) don't suppose we could take him with us
(understandably unenthusiastically) Well, we could-- There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans
' haven't any plans
Helen and Tom turn in surprise
including Klaatu, who has wandered in from the dining room, unnoticed by Tom and Helen
Klaatu continues, with an air of wanting to be helpful without wanting to interfere
'd be glad to spend the day with him -- if you'd let me
(impulsively) Say, that'll be great
Wouldn't it, Helen
(hesitating, a little confused, by the offer) It's awfully nice of you to suggest it
(remembering the two men haven't met) 'm sorry Mr
Carpenter -- this is Tom Stevens
The two men shake hand's and exchange how-do-you-do's
Then Klaatu turns back to Helen
Bobby and  had a fine time yesterday afternoon
We talked -- and listened to the radio
(smiling at Helen) thought today he might show me around the city
Helen is debating the matter in her mind, concerned about leaving Bobby with a comparative stranger, but tempted because of her favorable impression of Klaatu
(easily) Suppose  ask Bobby how he feels about it
He turns, with a little smile, and starts out of the room
Helen, still not quite decided, turns to Tom with a questioning look
Tom nods
T0: -   -  () The great seated, brooding figure of Lincoln is at the far end of the impressive main hall
few tourists are moving about the place
- They are in the south hall, on the wall of which is inscribed the Gettysburg Address
They stand silently, side by side, reading the inscription
-   () Featuring the last part of the Address
It reads: "--and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth
" - (visibly impressed) Those are great words
(with an air of discovery) He must have been a great man
Bobby is impressed by the depth and sincerity of Klaatu's tribute, but a little confused by his air of having discovered Lincoln
Hobby watches Klaatu with a puzzled expression, then follows as Klaatu moves off slowly
: -
- shooting against one of the huge fluted columns as Klaatu and Bobby come out of the building
Deeply preoccupied, Klaatu speaks with impatient urgency
That's the kind of man 'd like to talk to
Bobby looks up at him in bewilderment
After a moment Klaatu speaks slowly, thoughtfully
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today
(puzzling it over) Gee --  don't know
The space man,  guess
(secretly amused) was speaking of earth men
meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker
B0BBY You mean the smartest man in the whole world
Yes -- that would do nicely
(after a moments thought) Well -- Professor Barnhardt,  guess
He's the greatest scientist in the world
(he pauses thoughtfully, speaks slowly, as he recalls the newspaper story he read) He lives here in Washington, doesn't he
Sure
Right near where my mother works
Where is that
Department of Commerce
She's a secretary
(Klaatu nods) They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all
My mother's a real secretary
(after a moment; eagerly) Mr
Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship
-   -     - crew of Army engineers is in process of erecting a temporary structure such as a large Quonset hut or B29 hanger to enclose the space ship and Gort
The walls are partially up and already have concealed part of the ship
The area is roped off and there are Army guards to keep the sightseers back
There is a crowd of people behind the ropes, watching to reveal the backs of Bobby and Klaatu
- Bobby is studying the ship and Gort eagerly, his imagination thoroughly aroused
Klaatu is watching the men at work with mild, quiet amusement
- from Bobby's viewpoint
- Bobby's eyes are wide with awe as he watches the giant robot
Boy, 'll bet he's strong
bet he could knock down a whole building
(with a quizzical smile) shouldn't be at all surprised
Bobby's attention shifts to the ship
- From Bobby's viewpoint
- B0BBY (excitedly, indicating the ship) Gee, 'd like to get inside and see how it works
What do you think makes it go
(quietly, after a glance around) Well -- atomic power,  would imagine
(looking at Klaatu incredulously) thought that was only for bombs
No
It's for a lot of other things, too
You think it can go faster than an - 36
Yes --  think so
shooting from a side angle to include a couple of men who are listening to Klaatu's conversation
They are nudging each other, amused at the way this man is pretending to explain things to the little boy
About a thousand miles an hour
Klaatu has noticed the two men, who have edged a little closer to listen
He is not perturbed by them, but he lowers his voice a bit
Maybe four thousand miles an hour
And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster
(excitedly) Gee
How could they make a landing
Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed
You see, the velocity-- Klaatu interrupts himself as he realizes that he may be going too far
The two men have moved closer, listening and grinning
One of them whispers to the other behind the back of his hand
Then the man realizes that Klaatu has stopped speaking and is looking at him
(grinning) Keep goin', Mister
He was fallin' for it
The two men burst out laughing and move off together
Bobby, who has missed the point of this by-play, looks at Klaatu, then after the men
As they move out of scene they laugh loudly at the little boy's confusion
Klaatu takes Bobby's hand to lead him away from the roped-off area
- them as they move away through the crowd
As they do so, several newsboys are working their way through the crowd with newly arrived extras
The boys are calling out the extras: "Police under fire
" "Army put in charge
" "Space man still at large
" etc
People are eagerly buying the papers
Klaatu and Booby watch this as they pass through the crowd
- In newsboy's hand
The headline reads: - In another newsboy's hand
This headline reads: - as they move on away from the excited crowd of people
Klaatu's reaction has been one of mild curiosity
Bobby looks up at him
You think they'll ever find him
(alter a moment's pause) don't know, Bobby
'm inclined to doubt it
(as they continue walking) Mr
Carpenter -- what does velocity mean
(preoccupied) Velocity is the time rate of change of position
This explanation misses Bobby by several light years
He glances up at Klaatu blankly
'll bet that's the way Professor Barnhardt talks
Pulled out of his reverie, Klaatu glances down at Bobby and smiles apologetically
Bobby grins back at him
Then, as they walk on a few more steps, Klaatu stops and speaks thoughtfully
Bobby --  have an idea
Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks
(with a half-smile of accusation) You're just kidding, aren't you
Wouldn't you like to meet him
Well, sure  would, but -- (he's to be not going taken in) Aw, 'll bet you'd be scared
(with a private smile) We can scare him more than he can scare us
Bobby stares up at him and his face breaks into a broad admiring grin
like you, Mr
Carpenter
You're a real screwball
: '  -
- The house is an unimposing old-fashioned structure, shouldered on either side by similar one-family dwellings
There is a flight of stone steps leading up to the entrance and a large porch across the front of the house
Klaatu and Bobby walk into scene and pause, Klaatu glances at Bobby and Bobby nods toward the house
They move on up the steps to the entrance
- Bobby, all eagerness and excitement, presses the bell
They wait a moment and there is no answer
(disappointed at the thought) Gee -- maybe he isn't home
Bobby wanders down the porch and looks into a window
Fascinated by what he sees, he gestures to Klaatu
Betcha this is where he works-- After a glance at the front door, Klaatu joins Bobby at the window and looks in
- ' through the window, over the heads of Klaatu and Bobby
The room is more of a workroom than a study
It is in comfortably shabby disarray, with papers and books everywhere
There's a battered old desk and a day bed
One wall is solid bookshelves and on the other two are blackboards covered with a fantastic array of complex equations, graphs and diagrams
- His attention has been caught by one of the blackboards and he studies it with great interest and curiosity
- It is covered with a particularly complicated series of equations in a chalky scrawl, involving angles of vector, Keplerian ellipses, etc
The final equations are unsolved; they have no answers after the "equals" sign
Across are little printed signs tacked to the blackboard reading: "Don't erase
" and "Don't touch
" - Bewildered, Bobby looks from the blackboard up at Klaatu
Still studying the blackboard, Klaatu is shaking his head and clucking his tonsure as one might at the attempts of a child to solve a problem in arithmetic
(indicating the equations) What does that mean
It's a problem in celestial mechanics
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer
(he shakes his head, smiling) He doesn't know the answer
And he'll never get it that way
Bobby moves over to a pair of French doors beyond the window and tries to peer in through the curtained doors
He absently tries the doors and finds them locked
Then he turns away with a disappointed but philosophical shrug
We probably couldn't get to see him even if he was home
As Bobby moves away from the doors dejectedly, Klaatu puts his hand on the knob
- He's watching Klaatu and his eyes widen at what he sees
(in complete surprise) Hey -- where you going
- He has opened the door and is standing in the doorway, his hand, still on the knob
He is smiling at Bobby with secret amusement
He's got an idea
If he's that difficult to see, perhaps we ought to leave a calling card
Klaatu disappears into the study
Amazed, Bobby follows
' Bobby watches as Klaatu walks to the blackboard and picks up a piece of chalk
As though correcting a schoolboy's work, he makes large check marks at several points in each equation
- ' An efficient-looking middle-aged woman is mounting the steps to the entrance, getting her front door key out of her purse, when her eye falls on the French doors, which are standing ajar
Puzzled, she starts down the porch toward the doors
This woman is Barnhardt's secretary and her name is
Bobby is watching as Klaatu writes across the blackboard in a bold hand: Differentiate the equation ( )
Klaatu underlines this comment with a sharp stroke, when a stern voice is heard off screen
' What are you doing in here
as Klaatu and Bobby turn in surprise
Standing in the open French doors is Hilda, eyeing them with stern suspicion
(outraged by Klaatu's desecration of the sacred blackboard) How dare you write on that blackboard
(Klaatu eyes her mildly) Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks
(pleasantly) He'll catch on to it in no time now
(controlling herself with an effort) How did you get in here
And what do you want
We came to see Professor Barnhardt
Well, he's not here
And he won't be back till this evening
(sternly) think you'd better leave now
Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad
He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda
You might keep this
(with easy assurance) think the professor will want to get in touch with me
With a polite nod he goes out the French doors, followed by Bobby
Hilda eyes the door for a moment, then glances down at the paper in her hand, disturbed and puzzled by this stranger
Her glance wanders to the blackboard and she picks up an eraser, debating whether to erase Klaatu's corrections
At that moment the French door opens and Klaatu sticks his head in
Startled, Hilda drops the eraser
(pointing to the blackboard) wouldn't erase that
The Professor needs it very badly
And he disappears, leaving Hilda to glare after him in impotent rage
Deciding that this man is either a crackpot or a menace, she goes to the telephone on the desk and starts dialing a number
'  - as Klaatu and Bobby come down the steps and turn into the sidewalk
They are talking and laughing together, but we can't hear their conversation
with them as they move on up the sidewalk, revealing two kids playing hopscotch
Klaatu watches, fascinated, as he walks by
Then, having passed the kids, he tries the one-footed, then two-footed hop that characterizes the game
' Hilda is talking on the phone
--no, Sergeant, there was no classified material around, but have instructions to report anything unusual to the police
Yes -- 'm Professor Barnhardt's secretary
(consulting the paper in her hand) The man's name is Carpenter -- and he lives at 1615 St
Street,
Yes, that's right-- : -   - Bobby and Klaatu come out of a wooded path into a section of the cemetery where the myriad crosses seem to reach into infinity
They pause for a moment, then Bobby leads the way through one of the rows
- in one of the many rows are crosses that extend beyond on one of the crosses
It bears the name
-   B0BBY as they come into scene and look down at the grave
That's my father
(Klaatu glances at the boy, then nods understandingly) He was killed at a place called Anzio
Klaatu's glance roves out thoughtfully to the infinite rows of crosses, and his eyes are sad as they return to Bobby
: -
- Klaatu and Bobby are approaching a bench beside a pathway overhung with trees
Bobby leads the way to the bench and they sit down
Klaatu's eyes stray out to the myriad crosses
(Reflectively) Did all these people die in wars
(somewhat surprised) Sure
Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery
No -- 'm afraid not
(very serious) Mr
Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything
(Amused) 'll tell you, Bobby -- 've been away for a long time
Very far away
Is it different where you've been
(indicating the cemetery) Don't they have places like this
(slowly) They have cemeteries
But not like this one
You see, they don't have any wars
Bobby looks at him, puzzled and impressed by this incomprehensible notion
Gee -- that's a good idea
His eyes are drawn subconsciously out to the rows of crosses
Then he turns back to Klaatu with a slow-dawning look of curiosity, and Klaatu deliberately changes the subject
What would you like to do this afternoon
After a moment Bobby's expression changes and he breaks into a broad grin
Go to the movies
All right
(he didn't dare hope for this) No foolin'
Will you
Certainly
(then he hesitates) Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there
Bobby gives him a look of amazement, then grins, assuming Klaatu was kidding and simply hasn't any money
(eagerly) 've got some money
My mother gave me two dollars
No --  want to take you to the movies
(he takes some objects out of his pocket) Do you think they'd accept these
- ' Sparkling in his palm are eight or ten cut diamonds of various sizes
- The boy is staring at the stones in wide-eyed amazement
Gee -- those look like diamonds
Some places that's what people use for money
They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out
(staring at them fascinated) Bet they're worth about a million dollars
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them
(with a nervous, unsure smile) Well, sure, but-- The boy studies Klaatu's face to see if he's kidding
Realizing that he's not, Bobby's face takes on a childishly shrewd expression -- as though he were about to trade a jackknife for an ocean liner
(slowly) Okay
The boy takes out two dollar bills and offers them almost challengingly
Klaatu takes the bills and hands Bobby two good-sized Diamonds
They study their new acquisitions with interest
Bobby looks up from his diamonds to steal a guilty glance at Klaatu
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr
Carpenter
(mildly curious) Why not, Bobby
(gravely) She doesn't like me to steal from people
: -
- Shooting toward the curb as a police prowl car drives up and stops in front of the boardinghouse
Detective in plainclothes gets out and gestures to the uniformed Driver to pull up the street a way and wait
The Driver nods and the car moves off as the Detective crosses the sidewalk to the boardinghouse
- As the Detective mounts the steps he glances through a window into the living room
Klaatu can be seen reading to Bobby, who is perched happily on the arm of Klaatu's chair
The Detective moves to the front door ant rings the bell
There is the sound of running feet and in a moment the door is opened and Bobby appears
Mr
Carpenter come home yet
(studying the man curiously) Yeah -- he's right inside
- Tell him 'd like to see him
(calling out) Mr
Carpenter--
(to the Detective) Come on in
The Detective steps inside and Bobby closes the door, as Klaatu appears from the living room
Your name Carpenter
(puzzled that anyone should know him) Yes
(then recalling, with a smile of satisfaction) Oh --  suppose Professor Barnhardt's looking far me
(dryly, with grim emphasis) been looking for you all afternoon
-
- An inexpensive convertible -- a 1948 Ford, or Chevrolet -- drives up and stops in front of the house
Helen and Tom are in it
- TW0  - You get the feeling that Helen and Ton have spent a very enjoyable day together and are reluctant to say goodnight
Tom puts his arm around her and kisses her
(fondly) It was a wonderful day
You still haven't answered my question
(warmly sincere) You know how  feel, Tom
just want to think it over
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow
If  could tell him  was getting married -- with two dependents-- (smiling) You're a good salesman -- but 've got to think about it
good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think
With a smile and, a quick kiss, Helen gets out of the car
'Night
as Helen turns and hurries across the sidewalk to the house
In the entrance she turns and waves to Tom
He waves back and drives off slowly
Helen lets herself in with her key
- The Detective is putting on his hat and preparing to leave with Klaatu as Helen enters
There is a moment of awkwardness and confusion as she glances, puzzled, at the Detective
Bobby runs to her and greets her excitedly
Hi Mom
Hello, darling
(she kisses Bobby, then turns questioningly to Klaatu and the Detective) Good evening, Mr
Carpenter
Klaatu is uneasy but tries not to show it as he smiles in greeting and introduces the Detective
Mrs
Benson -- this is Mr
Brady
(Impressively) Mr
Brady's a cop
Helen glances quickly at the Detective, then at Klaatu, surprised and troubled
She turns to Bobby to cover her confusion
(to Bobby) Did you have a nice day, dear
(enthusiastically) Boy, we had a swell time
Didn't we, Mr
Carpenter
We certainly did
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy-- (moved and grateful, she's uneasy and concerned as she turns to Klaatu) don't know how to thank you
enjoyed every minute of it
(with quiet insistence) We better get goin', Mr
Carpenter
As Klaatu nods and prepares to follow him, Bobby speaks to Klaatu
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story
We'll finish it tomorrow
Goodnight, Bobby
(reluctantly) Goodnight
Klaatu and the Detective nod to Helen and they go out
Helen watches the door close with real concern, wondering why the police want Klaatu and hoping he hasn't done anything wrong
Still disturbed, she turns to lead Bobby upstairs
Come on, Bobby
Time to go to bed
(he followers her, then hesitates) Mom -- why does Mr
Carpenter have to go down to the police station
--  don't know, dear
Perhaps there's some mistake
This satisfies him for the moment -- even though it doesn't satisfy Helen
He is climbing the stairs beside her
We sure had fun today
We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and-- (flashing him a puzzled, incredulous look) Professor Barnhardt
(almost ignoring the interruption) Yeah, sure
Mom, do  have to go to school tomorrow
Of course, dear
Aw, gee, Mom --  had plans to play with Mr
Carpenter
: -   - The place is crowded and there is a feeling of feverish but well-ordered activity
Unidentified people who have been picked up in the search for the space man are being screened by the police
They are all men -- all between forty and sixty years old -- and they are from all walks of life series of desks have been arranged in a row, with signs over them reading
At each desk is a team of cops and before each desk is a line of men waiting to be screened
At the far end of the room Klaatu can be seen at the desk of a Police Lieutenant, with the detective who picked him up
Shooting over the shoulders of two cops at one of the desks, toward the line of people they are screening
nondescript, middle-aged vagrant stands before the desk as one of the cops flips through a card file
(to the cop beside him) Alberts -- no prior arrests
(to the vagrant) No identification
(the man shakes his head dully) Send him over to -2
The man is taken out of the line as    to the next desk, with another pair of cops and another line rather distinguished-looking business man is placing a sheaf of identification cards and papers on the desk
My wife just arrived with my identification
One of the cops at the desk glances over the papers and nods to the man
That'll be all, Mr
Baxter
Sorry to bother you
Next
to a third desk where a small, rat-faced man is standing uneasily before the two cops, one of whom is flipping through a card file
Cappo, John
(the man nods) Two priors -- one for petty theft -- one for shoplifting
(waving the man away) Okay, Jonny -- you can go
(with a nervous grin) Sometimes a record comes in handy
(and he moves off) -  ' Detective Lieutenant in plain clothes is questioning Klaatu, who stands beside the Detective who brought him in
The Lieutenant is a rugged but dignified man about fifty, intelligent and businesslike
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard
was only trying to be helpful
He was having difficulty with a problem
The Lieutenant exchanges a look with the Detective
(sardonically) Oh,  see
He was having trouble and you were helping him out
(pleasantly) That's right
(quietly sharp and accusing) suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much
He doesn't know the answer himself
(growing impatient) But  suppose you know the answer
(with a deprecating shrug) It's really quite simple
The three- body problem, you know
The lieutenant shifts in his chair, annoyed that he has to deal with this madman
He glances at a report on his desk, trying to control his impatience
Your name's Carpenter -- that right
(Klaatu nods) Any identification, Mr
Carpenter
Driver's license -- social security number
No -- 'm afraid not
Well, how do  know who you are
(secretly amused) You don't
The Lieutenant is turning away in exasperation as a uniformed cop comes into the scene
Excuse me, Lieutenant -- (pointing offscene) The Doc says this man needs treatment right away
man about forty-five, bloodied and badly beaten, is being supported and half-carried by two policemen
police doctor is guiding them to a doorway, near which is a sign
The man is almost unconscious, incapable even of holding up his head
-  ' What's the story
Some fella caught him lookin' in a window and figured he was the space man
The whole neighborhood went crazy and they ganged up on him
Would have killed him if we hadn't come along
Turns out he was just a prowler
The Lieutenant grimaces his disgust and impatience with mob violence
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up
(the cops nods and goes, and the Lieutenant growls as he turns back to Klaatu and the Detective) Looks like everybody's goin' nuts
(appalled by what he has seen and heard) They would have killed this man
(gruffly) People get hysterical enough, they do anything
(impatiently) Look, Mr
Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself,  got to send you over to the Army
(pretending impatience, but actually growing concerned) How long will that take
They can tell right away
They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital
(to the Detective) Take him over to G2
Really concerned now, Klaatu tries to find a way out
He attempts an authoritative air
It's very important, Lieutenant, that  see Professor Barnhardt
Come on, Mr
Carpenter-- Shaking off the Detective's hand, Klaatu speaks to the Lieutenant
May  suggest that you call the Professor
(all patience gone) Get going, will you, Brady -- before get mad
The Detective takes Klaatu's arm and leads him toward the door
As they go they pass a Military Police Captain, who makes his way straight to the Lieutenant's desk
-   - as they come out of the station
Klaatu hesitates a moment, looks around
His face reveals nothing, but he seems to be momentarily considering the idea of making a break
The Detective, sensitive to such a possibility, hooks his arm under Klaatu's and nods his head toward the sidewalk in silent command
Klaatu allows himself to be led off
as the Detective leads Klaatu across the sidewalk to the curb, where a police car is standing
Parked just behind it is an Army staff car
- as the
Captain appears in the entrance, accompanied by the Police Lieutenant
They see Klaatu and the Detective approaching the police car and hurry out of scene after them
- (to the Detective) Wait a minute, Brady-- (indicating orders in his hand) The Captain here's got orders from General Cutler to take this man over to Professor Barnhardt
(to Klaatu firmly but respectfully) Will you come with me, Sir
as Klaatu gets out of the police car and the Captain escorts him toward the staff car
Passing the Lieutenant, Klaatu speaks with a polite smile, a smile that might be one of mild triumph
Sorry to trouble you, Lieutenant
The Lieutenant reacts with impatient exasperation as the Captain holds the staff car door open for Klaatu, who steps into the Army vehicle, as we-- : - '  - as the
Captain and Klaatu enter the front door, which is held open for then by Hilda
She gestures them toward the half-open door of Barnhardt's study, where Barnhardt can be seen puzzling over the problem on the blackboard
The Captain knocks on the open door to attract his attention and enters with Klaatu
' Barnhardt turns from his deep preoccupation at the blackboard, chalk in hand
This is the man you wanted to see, Professor
(studying Klaatu curiously) Thank you, Captain
'll wait outside
He steps out into the hall, closing the door
Barnhardt continues to study Klaatu for a moment, then points to the notations he made on the blackboard
There is a controlled but anxious excitement in Barnhardt's attitude
You wrote this
(nodding easily) It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but  understand you're a difficult man to see
(glancing at the blackboard reproachfully) thought you'd have the solution by this time
Not yet
That's why  wanted to see you
Klaatu glances at the work Barnhardt has been doing on the board
Then he points to one of the expressions in an equation
All you have to do now is substitute this expression-- (pointing to a specific place) --at this point
Impressed and interested, Barnhardt tugs at his chin as he studies and weighs the results
(slowly, thoughtfully) Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms
But what about the effect of the other terms
Almost negligible
With variation of parameters, this is the answer
How can you be so sure
Have you tested this theory
(with a slight smile) find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another
(Barnhardt stares at him blankly) understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes,  have
My name is Klaatu
(noting that Barnhardt's expression is changing from amazement to incredulity) spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital
Room 309
My doctor's name was Major White -- and  had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday
(Klaatu waits for this to sink in, then speaks with quiet authority) If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time
Barnhardt hesitates for a long, thoughtful moment
Then he goes to the door, opens it and speaks to the Captain outside
(to the Captain, his voice a little unsteady) You can go now, Captain
Please thank General Cutler and tell him -- tell him that  know this gentleman
Barnhardt closes the door and turns to find Klaatu watching him with a faint smile
Barnhardt sinks into a chair, trying to adjust his mind
(dryly) You have faith, Professor Barnhardt It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr
Klaatu
Its curiosity
(unable to conceal his interest) Sit down, please
have several thousand questions to ask you
(ignoring the invitation) would like to explain something of my mission here
That was my first question
(with some bitterness) It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but  was not allowed the Opportunity
have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society
(gathering his thoughts) We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy
We also know that you are experimenting with rockets
Yes -- that is true
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression
But in the hands of your people-- (he shrugs and shakes his head) We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power
(puzzled) If you mean that you are afraid of us-- (with cool impressive emphasis) We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake
We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children
You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years
(indicating the telephone) We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago
(he paces thoughtfully) So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned
But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets
That, of course, we cannot tolerate
(thoughtful and impressed) These other planets -- do they have peace and security
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago
(he smiles wryly) After that we fought with bows and arrows
Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos
(with deep conviction) We scientists understand this
Even we primitive scientists
(Straightforwardly) What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr
Klaatu
came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger
am prepared, however, to offer a solution
Would you care to be more specific
(evenly) What  have to say must be said to all concerned
(with a suggestion of deference to Barnhardt) It is too important to be entrusted to any individual
Barnhardt is forced reluctantly to accept Klaatu's refusal to go any further
After a moment's thought, he speaks seriously, but with a twinkle in his eye
gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful
(sternly, as this unpleasant episode is recalled) come to you as a last resort -- and  confess that my patience is wearing thin
(with Jovian annoyance) Must  take drastic action in order to get a hearing
(uneasily) What -- what sort of action do you mean
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand
(quietly) Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea
Barnhardt stands staring at him for a moment, passes his hand across his brow
Then, as Klaatu watches, Barnhardt paces the floor, trying to digest what he has heard
After a moment, he turns to Klaatu
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists  am calling together
Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples
(quietly, evenly) That's what  came to see you about
Barnhardt flings him a glance, then looks momentarily sheepish
But his own eagerness carries him on
He paces the floor thoughtfully
It is not enough to have men of science
We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood
We must get important men from every field
Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world
leave that in your hands
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting
No -- not at all
What about your personal safety in the meantime
What about the Army -- and the police
My name is Carpenter and 'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house
(smiling, but a little concerned) 'm afraid  can't offer you any real protection
have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy
'm sure 'll be quite safe until the meeting
(he suddenly pauses, thoughtfully) One thing, Mr
Klaatu
Suppose this group should reject your proposals
What is the alternative
(with a sense of quiet, inescapable power) 'm afraid you have no alternative
In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be-- (he looks for the right word) --eliminated
The implications of this statement leave Barnhardt speechless, his keen mind reeling
Such power exists
assure you such power exists
Barnhardt stands silent for a moment, trying to collect his shattered thoughts
Klaatu watches him as he starts pacing again
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this
They must understand what is at stake
(after a thoughtful moment, he looks up) You mentioned a demonstration of force-- Yes
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting
Yes -- of course
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation
Something that would affect the entire planet
(with a nod) That can easily be arranged
(frightened by his easy assumption of infinite power) wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything
(easily) Why don't you leave it to me
'll think of something
(with a nervous half- smile) Maybe a little demonstration
(thinking about it) Something dramatic -- but not destructive
(intellectually amused) It's quite an interesting problem
(Barnhardt nods vaguely) Would day after tomorrow be all right
Say about noon
Klaatu's bland manner leaves Barnhardt shaken, almost wishing he'd never started this business
: -  - It is about 3:30 the following evening
Helen is sitting in a chair leafing through a magazine
She is dressed to go out
corner of the dining room can be seen, where Mr
and Mrs
Barley are playing cards with Mr
Krull
Mrs
Crockett, the landlady, enters from the hall on her way to the dining room and notices Helen
Going out, dear
Yes, 'm waiting for Tom to pick me up
(with a shudder) Personally,  won't go out after dark these days
(with an attempt at slyness) But then -- 'm not courting, am
She turns to go on into the dining room and as she does so almost bumps into Klaatu who is coming out, having been kibitzing the card game
(thoroughly startled) Oh -- Mr
Carpenter--
Klaatu steps aside as she hurries nervously into the dining room
He turns, puzzled, to find Helen watching with a slight smile
Everyone seems so-- (he shakes his hands to indicate nervousness) Jittery is the word
Helen watches him, a little uneasy in his presence
She is fond of him, and she can't help being curious and concerned about his brush with the police
(with a contemplative smile) Bobby's the only person  know who isn't -- Jittery
He has his homework to keep him occupied
(fondly, sincerely) He's a fine boy, Mrs
Benson
Naturally  think so
Warm and friendly and intelligent-- (thoughtfully) You know -- he's the only real friend 've made since 've been here
Helen is deeply moved by Klaatu's affection for the boy, She tried to dismiss her curiosity about him, but she can't
She decides to face it
(hesitantly and with some difficulty) Mr
Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night
(with easy frankness) Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions
Bobby and  tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in
Apparently they thought  was looking for secrets of some kind
Helen has reacted in puzzlement at this second mention of Barnhardt
They are interrupted by the ringing of the doorbell
Helen goes to answer it
as Helen opens the front door to admit Tom
He appears impatient, anxious to get going
Hello-- You ready
will be in just a minute
(a little annoyed that she hasn't her coat on, he consults his watch) The picture starts at eight-fifty
(in explanation) was talking to Mr
Carpenter
(lightly, but with real sarcasm underneath) hope Mr
Carpenter won't think 'm intruding
Helen tries to shush him, to indicate Klaatu is in the next room, when Klaatu appears in the doorway
He must have heard Tom's remark, and there is an awkward moment
Klaatu is completely unperturbed, but Helen is embarrassed
Excuse me
was just going up to my room
(guiltily) Goodnight, Mr
Carpenter
Klaatu stops and turns to face them pleasantly
Have a good time -- both of you
He goes on up the stairs
Helen steers Tom toward the living room
Why don't you wait in here while get my things
As they enter from the hall, Helen turns to Tom reproachfully
(quietly) Oh, Tom, that was awful
(momentary apologetic) 'm sorry
guess 'm just tired of hearing about Mr
Carpenter
(Helen shushes him) don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby
After all, what do you know about him
This touches on Helen's own private doubts, and she cannot answer
'll go get my things
She turns quickly and goes into the hall and hurries up the stairs
Tom looks after her, dismissing the matter with a shake of the head and a philosophical sigh
Of such stuff are women made
- Helen reaches the top of the stairs, crosses to her room and grabs a coat off the bed
She's putting it on as she moves down the hall to Bobby's room, the door of which is open
' Bobby is at a table doing his homework and Klaatu has just finished explaining an arithmetic problem to him, as Helen enters, still putting on her coat
(about to leave) All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract
Thanks, Mr
Carpenter
(to Helen, pleasantly) 'll say goodnight again
Helen is embarrassed
She would like to apologize for the awkwardness downstairs but she doesn't quite know how to go about it
Mr
Carpenter, -- (it's too complicated; she can't do it) Goodnight
(with a warm smile of complete understanding and appreciation) Goodnight, my dear
He turns and goes out, closing the door
little distracted, Helen turns to Bobby
Go to bed, darling
You can finish that in the morning
Okay
Helen watches as he starts to put away his work
She wants to tell him something, but finds it difficult to say
(hesitantly, almost guiltily) Bobby --  think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr
Carpenter (shocked, and bewildered) Gee, why, Mom
He's my best friend
And he's awful good in arithmetic
He even helps Professor Barnhardt
Did you and Mr
Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt
Sure we did
He wasn't there but we went to see him
And Mr
Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic
Helen is surprised to get this corroboration for Klaatu's story
Sensing his mother's uneasiness, the boy looks for something intriguing -- some deep, dark secret
(shrewdly) Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr
Carpenter
What do you mean, dear
mean -- on account of that policeman last night
(his eyes light up hopefully) You think he's a bank robber, maybe
Or a gangster
No, dear, of course not
He's a very nice man
Just think he might prefer to be left alone
Now you get to bed and forget about it
(she kisses him) 'Night, darling
With a reassuring smile, she starts for the door
Goodnight
(stopping her in the doorway, his imaginative suspicions mounting) Hey Mom -- why would he want to be alone
Not wanting to go into this any further, Helen blows him a kiss and backs out, closing the door
Bobby stands thinking for a moment, his mind still speculating on all sorts of wonderful possibilities
Still preoccupied, he drifts over to his bed and sits down to take of his shoes
He drops the first one to the floor and is starting on the other, when there is a light rap on his door
The door opens and Klaatu appears
Bobby -- have you a flashlight
(surprised by his appearance and his request) Yeah -- sure
(he goes to a drawer and gets a large hand flashlight) It's a real Boy Scout flashlight
Bobby hands him the light, studying his face with eager curiosity
What do you want it for, Mr
Carpenter
(evasively) Why -- the light in my room went out
(cutting off further questions) Thank you, Bobby
Goodnight
Klaatu goes out, closing the door behind him
Bobby hesitates a moment, puzzled and curious
Then he goes over to the door, flips off the lights, and slowly, noiselessly opens the door a crack so he can peer out into the hall
shooting down the hall through the crack in Bobby's door
Klaatu's door is ajar and through it the lights in his room can be seen burning brightly
Klaatu goes to his door, reaches in and flips off the lights and closes the door
He then scans the hall in both directions
Satisfied he isn't seen, he moves surreptitiously down the hall toward the stairs, still carrying the flashlight
- as he closes his door carefully, an expression of intense excitement on his face
What he has seem is certainly, unmistakably suspicious
Why did Mr
Carpenter lie to him
What does he want the flashlight for and where is he going
Bobby decides he's got to find out
Hurriedly he laces on the shoe he had taken off, and peers out the door to find the hall clear
He slips out the door, closing it behind him
: -
- Klaatu is walking down the dark, semi-deserted street with the determined stride of a man with a definite objective
- Half a block behind, he's following Klaatu, eagerly, flushed with a sense of excitement and adventure
: - Walking along the sidewalk, Klaatu turns into a side street, disappearing from view around the corner
In a moment, Bobby hurries into scene breathlessly
He pulls up for a moment to rest
Then, getting his breath, he dashes on around the corner after Klaatu
: -   - This is a temporary structure that has been erected to enclose the space ship and Gort
In front of the one small door are two soldiers, standing guard
Concealed in some foreground foliage, studying the layout, is Klaatu
Nearby 's a sign reading:
This area   to the public
- He is a short distance away, watching Klaatu eagerly
- as he studies the situation
shooting over Klaatu's shoulder
As he watches, a Jeep filled with armed soldiers -- apparently regular patrol -- drives up to the entrance of the building
They stop for a moment while their Sergeant checks with the guards
Assured that everything is under control, the Sergeant signals his driver and the Jeep moves off
- Scanning the side of the building, he sees what he's looking for
Waiting until the Jeep disappears, he starts toward one side of the building, keeping himself concealed in the foliage
- puzzled and interested, as he watches Klaatu
The two sentries standing in front of the building
as Klaatu maneuvers around the side of the building, where there is a window
It has no glass in it but is heavily barred
- as he leaves the concealing foliage and crosses the clear, grassy area surrounding the building
He stops and tries to see through the window
- shooting through the barred window into the building
The huge robot looms large and eerie in the shadows cast by a couple of naked work-lights
His head is angled, away from the window
as Klaatu approaches the window
Aiming his flashlight at Gort, he flashes the light intermittently, as though signaling
(This should not approximate any known code
) - As we watch, the intermittent flashes of Klaatu's light appear on the wall ahead of Gort
Slowly, evenly, the robot's head turns to face the window
from Gort's viewpoint, of the window, with Klaatu's light flashing its signals
- shooting on his back, as he finishes signaling and cuts off the flashlight
He turns ant starts back for the concealment of the foliage
- craning his neck to look for Klaatu, who has eluded his view
Suddenly he sees Klaatu again
- making his way behind the foliage toward the front of the building
Arriving at a point opposite the entrance, Klaatu waits and watches
- The two guards are standing in the doorway in positions of relaxed alertness
Suddenly, inside the building behind them, the giant figure of Gort looms silently in the doorway
His two great arms reach out, grab the two guards and drag then back inside the building
- He lets out an inaudible gasp as he sees this
Bug-eyed, he glances quickly to the point where he last saw Klaatu
He is amazed at what he sees
from Bobby's viewpoint
Klaatu has emerged from the concealment of the tree-lined path and is making his way calmly toward the entrance of the building
- As he watches Klaatu enter the building, his curiosity conquers his fear and he starts tremblingly toward the structure
- as Klaatu enters
The huge shapes of the space ship and Gort loom large and eerie
Klaatu starts across the barren enclosure toward the ship
- as Bobby approaches the door, fearful but fascinated
He peers cautiously inside and his eyes grow wide as saucers
- In *f
g
, near the door, the two guards lie unconscious
As Klaatu walks toward the ship Gort slowly turns his head to follow him with him with eyes
Klaatu touches a point on the unbroken surface of the ship and the ramp silently swings out and down to the ground
Klaatu mounts the ramp and disappears inside the ship, whereupon the ramp silently closes
- as he watches this; his eyes bulging
He can scarcely believe what he has seen
Suddenly a wave of sheer terror sweeps over him
Scrambling to his feet, he turns and runs wildly away
- Klaatu as he moves down the tiny, dimly lighted entrance corridor
He steps into the main cabin of the ship and flips a switch which bathes the cabin in a diffused, shadowless light
The walls are lined with a complex of mysterious gadgetry -- knobs, dials, indicators, etc
All of this should be as imaginative and unorthodox as possible, while still retaining a feeling of sound but highly advanced engineering
as Klaatu moves to the communications panel, flipping switches and turning dials
Indicators light up
There are crackling, whirring and buzzing sounds
Klaatu starts speaking into a built-in microphone in his own strange language
He speaks in rapid-fire explanation, continuing to talk, as we-- : -
- as Klaatu walks calmly away from the ship, past the two unconscious guards and disappears out of the door
as one of them slowly regains consciousness
Looking around, he sees the great figure of Gort and is terror-stricken
He shakes his companion frantically in an effort to bring him to
: Bobby is curled up in a chair waiting for his mother to come home
He's sleepy, but the excitement of what he has seen precluded any such possibility
From the hall we hear the front door opening as Helen and Tom come in
' (off scene) Why don't you come on in for a minute
Helen and Tom appear in the doorway, Helen is startled to see Bobby, who has Jumped up and run toward her
Bobby--
What are you doing up at this hour
(excitedly) couldn't go to sleep, Mom
had to tell you
Tell me what
(the words tadpole out breathlessly) followed Mr
Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went
Right into the space ship
(patiently disbelieving) Now, Bobby, just a minute-- Honest, Mom,  saw him
It just opened up and he walked right in
And that great big iron man was moving around
Bobby, you've been dreaming again
(desperately) No,  haven't, Mom
promise you
saw it
Helen and Tom exchange a glance of tolerant amusement
Where did you see all this, Bobby
On the lawn down at the mall -- in that place with the soldiers out front
(trying to trap him) Where were the soldiers all this time
That robot fella grabbed 'em and dragged 'em inside
(his lips trembling) like Mr
Carpenter -- but 'm scared, Mom
He rushes into Helen's arms, clutching her desperately, trying to hold back his tears
(holding him close to her sympathetically) Mustn't be frightened, darling -- It was just a bad dream
Here -- we'll prove it to you
(with a look and a nod to Tom) Tom, will you ask Mr
Carpenter if he'll come down for a minute
(Tom turns to go) The room right opposite mine
Nodding, Tom disappears into the hall and up the stairs
Still holding Bobby, Helen tries to dispel his fears by an appeal to logic
Now think back hard
You didn't follow Mr
Carpenter at all, did you
You haven't even been out of the house
Yes,  have
(determinedly) You didn't really see the space ship
You just thought you did
Bitterly hurt, Bobby faces his mother gravely, accusingly
'd never call you a liar
- Tom is knocking softly at Klaatu's door
Getting no answer, he tries the door, pushes it open and peers in
Then he steps into the darkened room
'  - Tom snaps on the light and looks around the empty room
The bed is still made
Glancing around, Tom's eye is caught by a flash of something bright on the floor below the dresser
He stoops down and picks up a fair-sized diamond
Tom studies the stone curiously, holding it up to the light
Thoroughly puzzled, he keeps the stone in his hand, switches off the light and goes out
- Closing the door, Tom hurries along the hall and down the stairs - Through the hall door Tom can be seen coming down the stairs
Helen and Bobby watch expectantly as he enters
He's not there
(crossing to Helen) But look what  found in his room (takes the stone and studies it, amazed by its size) Is it real
(with the shrug of an amateur) Looks real to me
Mr
Carpenter's got a lot of diamonds
(he digs into his pocket) He gave me a couple of them
Helen takes the two diamonds Bobby holds out in his hand, looking at them in amazement
He gave these to you
(guilty for his own sharp dealing) Well, not exactly
gave him two dollars
This doesn't make sense
think the guy's a crook
never did trust him
Helen tries to shush Tom, not wanting to re-stimulate Bobby's imagination, but it's too late
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler
(firmly) Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed
wonder if we ought to-- (cutting him off with a look) Bobby and  have had enough excitement for tonight
(seriously concerned) You think it's all right for you to stay here
(nods reassuringly) 've got a good lock on my door
(smiling at Bobby) And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight
Oh, boy -- can , Mom
Yes, dear
Come on now
(she happens to look down at his feet
Puzzled, and concerned, she feels his shoes) Bobby, your shoes are soaking
(reluctantly, with childish guilt) Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet
As the impact of this sinks in, Helen and Tom turn to stare at each other in questioning consternation
: : -
- It is a typical government office, with lots of desks in it
Helen is at her desk, straightening it up to go to lunch
This done, she moves briskly to get her coat
to follow her and suddenly, startlingly reveals Klaatu standing near the clothes rack, as though he had materialized out of thin air
Helen is thoroughly startled
(unnerved) Oh -- hello-- May  see you for a minute
--  was Just going to lunch
(quietly insistent) May  walk out with you
She is nervous and uneasy but obviously can't refuse
The telephone on her desk rings and Helen turns to answer it
(into phone) Mrs
Benson speaking
(recognizing the voice, she glances nervously at Klaatu) Oh, hello
- It's a rather swank shop
Tom is standing at the counter phoning
The Jeweler is behind the counter examining a stone through his eyepiece
(into phone, cheerily) 'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond
thought we might have lunch together
-
- (with a nervous glance at Klaatu) -- 'm afraid  can't -- not right now
Can  talk to you later
Yes, that'll be fine
'Bye
She hangs up and smiles uneasily as she rejoins Klaatu and leads the way out into the corridor
- with Helen and Klaatu as they go down the corridor
Klaatu's mood is one of quiet tension
(watching Helen's reaction) saw Bobby this morning before he went to school-- (glancing at him apprehensively) Yes--
want to know what he told you last night
(nervous and evasive) --  didn't really pay much attention-- (with a nervous little laugh) Bobby has such an active imagination
(refusing to be put off) Did you believe what he told you
(Helen hesitates, trapped by uncertainty) have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason
They are approaching the elevator at the end of the corridor
There is a large crowd of lunch-goers milling around the elevator, which is quickly filled
Half the crowd is left as the elevator doors close and it descends
- Nervous and distracted, Helen doesn't want to get caught up in this jam
There's another elevator we can use-- She nods toward a side corridor and starts for it, Klaatu following
them as they turn into the side corridor
Helen leads the way to a small, automatic elevator
She presses the button and the doors open
Klaatu follows her in
As Helen presses the first floor button, the doors close and the elevator starts down
She turns to face Klaatu
(her nerves raw and edgy) What is it you want
Before  ask you to be honest with me, perhaps  should be completely honest with you-- Without warning the elevator comes to a jolting, jarring stop as the power is cut off and the lights go out
The car is illuminated faintly and eerily by light that seeps through the ventilating grills from a skylight in the shaft
Helen is terrified
(gasping with fright) What happened
(a moment's hesitation; then he remembers) What time is it
Helen fumbles to get her wrist watch into a faint beam of light
Just twelve
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes
(preoccupied with her own thinking) We could try pushing the other buttons
(digging in her purse) have a flashlight in my purse
It won't work
Helen has the flashlight out and is snapping it on, but it doesn't work
She looks up at him blankly
Why not
(after a moment, quietly) You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world
The impact of this calm, quiet statement is shattering
Helen stares at him awe-struck
Then she speaks numbly, almost inaudibly
Bobby was telling the truth -- wasn't he
Klaatu stares at her evenly, as we-- : - All vehicular traffic in the street is at a dead stop
Automobiles, busses, trolley cars -- all are stalled
Drivers and passengers are climbing out of the vehicles in utter bewilderment
Except for the people, it is as though the street had been frozen in motion
The great generators and dynamos are silent and motionless in the dim, unlighted plant
huge automobile or airplane assembly line, with nothing moving, no machinery going
- The giant presses are threaded with newsprint, but they are silent and motionless
- couple of engineers are working feverishly over a huge and complicated control panel
They are working by the light of two incongruous and ineffectual candles
People carne pouring up the stairs wildly, feverishly anxious to escape the darkness below
Their eyes blink weakly in the unaccustomed sunlight
- Cars, taxis and busses are stalled, their frenzied drivers unable to figure out what's happened
junk peddler with a broken-down horse and wagon moves grandly and leisurely through the stalled vehicles
The peddler bears a happy grin of superiority
This is his moment of triumph over modern civilization
- with all traffic stalled
- of two cab drivers whose taxis have stalled beside each other in traffic
One has gotten out of his cab
The other is seated at his wheel, looking around in awe and terror, his tough Manhattan heart shaken
My ol' lady was right
We shoulda got a place in the country
-   - with all traffic stalled
(It is about 5:00
) - standing on the sidewalk, awe-struck at the weird sight before them
One of them speaks in terror, hardly daring to articulate his thoughts
It's that space man -- that's wot it is
-   - with all traffic stalled
(It is about 8:00
) - They are an elderly couple
Staring bug-eyed at the strange street scene, the woman mutters some terror-stricken comment in Russian
-
- with traffic stalled
(It is about 5:00
) - She is middle-aged and there are tears of fright in her eyes
She is mumbling a prayer in French
: '  - Barnhardt is seated comfortably at his desk with a book on his lap
He has been interrupted by the entrance of Hilda, his secretary
At the moment she`s beside herself with excitement
Barnhardt watches her with a half-smile of secret amusement
He has already deduced the cause of what's happening
You should see it, Professor Barnhardt
You should go out and see it for yourself
Thanks -- 'm enjoying it right here
The whole city has stopped
People are running around like ants
(musing admiringly on Klaatu's cleverness) What a brilliant idea
never would have thought of it
Hilda flings him a questioning look, annoyed that he won't share her excitement
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight
Have they all arrived
(nodding) talked to most of them this morning
They were all very curious about the meeting
Good
Did you speak to our friend Mr
Carpenter
(nodding) He'll be there at 8:30
(studying her for a moment) Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure
Yes, sir -- it certainly does
(nodding with a bland little smile) That's good, Hilda
'm glad
The poor woman flings him a look of shocked amazement as we-- : -
- Seated at a conference table are high-ranking officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps
There is the uneasy tension of people dealing with unknown forces
An Army Major General, who's Chairman of the meeting, is speaking
--as far as we can tell, all power's been cut off everywhere -- with a few exceptions: hospitals, planes in flight -- that sort of thing
wish could be more specific but, as you now, all communications are out telephone, radio, cable -- everything
(gravely) can tell you that the President is prepared to declare a state of national emergency
(pausing to let this sink in) Before we start discussing plans, want a report from Colonel Ryder
What about the robot, Colonel
Ryder is a Colonel of engineers, a man about forty-five
When it was discovered last night that the robot had moved,  was directed by the Joint Chiefs to find a means of immobilizing him
We accomplished that this morning by encasing him in a block of  93
(he hands a small block of plastic to the General) It's a new plastic material -- stronger than steel
Is it possible that he's broken out of this stuff
No, sir
've Just checked on that
He's locked up tight as a drum
All right -- that means we concentrate on the man
(to the group with force and authority) Up till now we've agreed on the desirability of capturing this man alive
We can no longer afford to be so particular
We'll get him alive, if possible -- but we must get him
(eyes the group sternly) Is that clear
: -
- The shop and its glittering display cases, which were brilliantly lighted in the previous scene, are now gloomy and dim
All artificial light is off
The Jeweler is a bright- eyed old man of seventy with a middle European accent
He is completely fascinated as he examines the diamond Tom has given him, and is annoyed by the lack of light
He speaks impatiently to one of the girls in the shop who happens to pass by
Eleanor, did you call the electrician
(she's not too bright) tried, Mr
Bleeker
But the phone doesn't work, either
(absently, as he studies the stone) Well, call the phone company
(plaintively) But the phone doesn't work
The Jeweler gives her a preoccupied glance of annoyance and turns back to the stone
Is it worth anything
have never seen such a stone
Will you please tell me where it came from
That's what  wanted you to tell me
(overwhelmed and absorbed by the stone, he shakes his head, bewildered) There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world
Impressed by the import of what the man is saying, Tom's mind is racing wildly
You sure about that
(eagerly, shrewdly) Would you like to sell it
(picking up the stone) No -- no, thanks
'd give you a very good price
Preoccupied with his own excited thoughts, Tom has already started for the door
: -   - In the dim light of the stalled elevator, Klaatu is finishing explaining to Helen the story of his mission
Overwhelmed by the staggering import of what he has told her, Helen is listening with great interest and concern
(speaking gravely) --'ve already told you more than told Professor Barnhardt, because my life, in a sense, is in your hands
thought if you knew the facts you'd appreciate the importance of my not being -- apprehended, -- before the meeting tonight
Helen is staring at him in awe, but also in complete admiration and sympathy
Yes, of course
Of course  do
Klaatu smiles at her warmly and she manages to return the smile
Their relationship is further cemented by the sharing of this vital secret
(studying his face anxiously) You hold great hope for this meeting
can see no other hope for your planet
If the meeting should fail, then 'm afraid there is no hope
Suddenly and without warning, the elevator starts moving and the lights go on
Startled, Helen looks at him
(calmly) It must be twelve-thirty
(looks at her watch, then back at him, awe-struck) Yes -- Just exactly
-
- Showing a section of street traffic as it comes back to life
From everywhere comes the sound of self-starters
Trolley bells start clanging
Then automobile horns
People climb back into there vehicles and traffic starts to move
of other streets, as the strident sounds of traffic build up and normalcy is regained
-     -
- as Helen and Klaatu come out of the elevator and start across the lobby,
Helen is preoccupied with concern for Klaatu's safety
Where are you going now
Back to the boardinghouse
'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and can keep an eye on Bobby
He's the only other person who knows anything about-- This recalls to Helen something she had forgotten and she stops in sudden concern
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else
Who
Tom
He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw
The look of concern on Klaatu's face heightens Helen's overwhelming fear and uncertainty
(worriedly) Of course, he doesn't know anything definite
He'd talk to me first, anyway, before-- (interrupting herself in sudden decision) We can't take that chance
'll get in touch with him right away and make sure
Helen turns and starts determinedly for the lobby door, followed by Klaatu, as we-- : Helen is nervous and worried as she speaks into the phone
(into phone) --But 've got to talk to him
It's terribly important
When is he coming back
'   -   - Tom's secretary has not yet recovered from the shock of what has happened to the world
don't know, Mrs
Benson
He left before noon -- before that awful electric business
'm scared to death, Mrs
Benson
-- No, he wouldn't tell me where he was gong
Said it was something personal
Tell him  want to see him the minute he gets in
No, 'll call back
Helen hangs up, thoroughly worried and distraught now
: - The headline reads: - : -
- at passenger loading gate
group of passengers is held back as soldiers close the gate to the runway, preventing their boarding their plane
The passengers mill about in consternation as a voice is heard over a p
a
system
Attention, please
All flights from National Airport have been canceled until further notice
All flights from this airport have been canceled
: -
- 's are blocking the gates leading to trains and ticket takers are busy explaining matters and remonstrating with irate ticket holders
: -
- Passengers are being herded off a loaded bus that was preparing to leave the depot
: - The Army has thrown a roadblock across a main highway on the outskirts of the city and is permitting no one to leave
From the line of halted cars we see and the insistent honking of horns we hear, we get the impression of hundreds of cars stacked up
: '   -   - It is 6:00
and growing dark outside, but the lights are not on
The office is small and unpretentious, the business habitat of a man who works in a big insurance agency
Tom's secretary is on the phone, reflecting the world-wide terror of the moment
(into phone, nervous and jittery) --Honest, Mary, 'm so scared  can't sit still
'd like to run some place, but  don't know where to go-- (hearing the door open, she cuts off) 'Bye now
The corridor door opens and Tom enters with an air of urgency
Call the Pentagon and find out who's in charge of this space man business
Whoever it is  want to talk to him
The secretary has a reaction of surprise, but she manages to stop Tom at his door
He has flipped on the lights in passing
Mrs
Benson's been trying to get you all afternoon
She says it's important
Get this other call first
Tom disappears into his office, closing the door
The secretary is getting out a telephone directory when the corridor door opens and Helen enters, tense and nervous
Oh, Mrs
Benson -- He just walked in
(misery loves company) Are you nervous, too
Yes,  am, Margaret
The secretary buzzes the intercom and speaks into it
Mrs
Benson is here
(turning to Helen) Go on in
Helen is starting for the door when it opens and Tom appears
Tom -- 've been trying to get you all afternoon-- (preoccupied with his own excitement) Come on in
'   - as Tom follows Helen inside and closes the door
He turns to her, his voice tense with excitement
've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr
Carpenter
(trying to appear calm) What about him
Helen, he's the man from the space ship
(she eyes him evenly, apprehensively, as he hurries on) had that diamond checked at three different places
Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that
After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me
Why is it nobody knows anything about him
Why hasn't he got any money
(evenly, with quiet tension) All right, Tom -- it's true
know it's true
How do you know
Never mind about that
(urgently, with great concern) You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody
Are you crazy
After what happened today
You don't understand
You don't realize how important it is
(impatiently) Important
Of course it's important
The point is we can do something about it
That's what 'm trying to tell you
We mustn't do anything about it
Believe me, Tom,  know what 'm talking about
(irritated by her opposition) He's a menace to the whole world
It's our duty to turn him in
(desperately) But he isn't a menace
He told me what he came here for
(dismissing this with annoyed contempt) He told you
Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy
(busy with his own thoughts) You realize what this'd mean for us
'd be the biggest man in the country
could write my own ticket
(eyeing him coldly) Is that what you're thinking about
(guiltily, defensive) Why not
Somebody's got to get rid of him
They are interrupted by the sharp sound of the interoffice buzzer
'm not going to let you do it, Tom
(with deep personal urgency) Believe me, this is literally the most important thing in the world
Tom picks up the phone and answers it
(into phone) Yes
What's his name, Margaret
General Cutler
(disappointed that the connection isn't completed) All right, 'll hold on
Realizing what he's doing, Helen crosses to him, pleading wildly, desperately
Tom, you mustn't --
You don't know what you're doing
It isn't just you and Mr
Carpenter
The rest of the world, is involved
(exasperated) don't care about the rest of the world
It is as though he had slapped her across the face
Suddenly he has revealed himself, naked and distasteful
Feeling guilty as he sees the contempt and revulsion in her eyes, he tries the old charm, holding his hand over the phone
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers
(staring at him starkly) feel different right now
(uneasily) You wait and see
You're going to marry a big hero
'm not going to marry anybody
She turns and runs quickly out of the room
Tom's inclination is to follow her, when his connection is completed
(into phone) Hello, General Cutler
(irritated) No,  don't want to speak to his aide
want to speak to the General
Tell him it's about the space man
My name is Tom Stevens
-t-e-v-e-n- s
: -
- Helen hurries out of the building, hails a cab, gets into it and the cab drives off
'  -   - Tom now has General Cutler on the phone
(into phone) That's right, General
That's where he's staying
Yes, of course 'm sure
'  -
The General is on the phone and is making notes
There are a couple of officers standing near his desk, a Colonel and a Lieutenant Colonel
(after listening for a moment) Thank you very much, Mr
Stevens
'll want to talk to you further but haven't time now
(hangs up and turns to Colonel) Deploy all Zone 5 units according to Plan  -- immediately
The Colonel nods and starts out of the room, as we-- : -
-  - The cab is traveling through city traffic
Nervous and edgy, Helen glances at her watch impatiently
- jeep filled with armed soldiers is moving down the street at a fast clip
Behind the jeep is an Army staff car
-  - shooting from outside into the car
In the front seat beside the driver is a full Colonel, wearing helmet and side-arms
The car is moving swiftly through traffic as the Colonel speaks into the transmitter of a radio
- It is filled with soldiers wearing helmets and carrying rifles and Tommy guns
It is traveling quite fast
soldier with a handy-talkie transmits an order to the driver
- The
and
car is seen to be at the head of a convoy of eight Army vehicles which are moving swiftly down the street
The trucks are filled with armed soldiers
- On this street also an armed convoy is racing by, headed by a Jeep mounting a
30 caliber machine gun
- On this street also a convoy rolls by
- Helen's cab rounds the corner into the boardinghouse street
with cab as it draws up in front of the boardinghouse
The cab waits as Helen jumps out and runs up the steps to the front door
couple of children are playing jump-rope in the light of a street lamp
-   - shooting in at the Colonel as he issues an order into the radio
- the rear of the convoy as it races down a main thoroughfare
As the convoy reaches each intersection, the last vehicle peels off the column and, turns into the side street
racing down another street, the rear vehicles peeling off at the intersections as in previous scene
- Following one of the vehicles after it has peeled off into a side street
It turns around in the side street and draws up facing the intersection, its motor still running
We get the impression of a methodical plan to block off each street
) - as Klaatu and Helen come hurrying down the steps and pile into the waiting taxi
The kids playing Jump-rope stop and watch as the door is closed and the cab pulls out, disappearing as it makes a right turn at the end of the street
- (This is opposite end of street from last shot
) Barreling across the intersection into the boardinghouse street is the jeep followed by the Colonel's staff car
- As the Jeep and staff car pull up in front of the boarding house, the soldiers in the jeep pile out and cover the entrance to the house
Meanwhile the Colonel, still in the staff car, is talking to the two kids playing out front
They chatter excitedly, pointing in the direction taken by the cab
-   - He speaks into his radio in tones of clipped and quiet efficiency
The car remains standing at the curb
(into radio) Attention, Zone 5
Yellow cab, moving north on  from Ninth Street
Man and woman in back seat
Get the license number and report
- The cab 's moving through traffic at a normal speed
Klaatu and Helen are tense and nervous
- The cab's moving through traffic at a normal speed
Klaatu and Helen are tense and nervous
'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting
Where is the meeting going to be
At the ship
- as he looks out to his left, approaching an intersection
From driver's viewpoint
and
car is parked in the side street, facing the intersection, its occupants armed and helmeted
- Abreast of the intersection now, he looks to his right
- shooting over the rear of a jeep which is halted in a side street facing the intersection
The cab crosses the intersection and the jeep driver squints to catch its number
Then he picks up his radio and speaks into the transmitter
-   - (The car is still in front of the boardinghouse
) The Colonel listens to his radio for a moment, then speaks into his transmitter
(into radio) Attention, Zone 5
license number of target vehicle is  4936
All vehicles maintain your positions -- and hold your fire
- shooting at the driver, over the shoulders of Klaatu and Helen, as he turns and points out the Army vehicles to them with a shrug of bewilderment
They look ahead at the intersection they are approaching
- looking ahead out of her side of the cab, at the intersection
- from Helen's viewpoint
There is an Army vehicle waiting in the side street
- as he looks out of his side of the cab
- In this side street, too, an Army vehicle is standing
- Their eyes meet for a moment, neither willing to conjecture what this might mean
The very quietness of the operation is ominous and menacing
Their faces show grave concern
-   - (into radio) Attention, Zone 5 -- report when target vehicle passes your position
shooting through the window at Helen and Klaatu, who are growing more tense and nervous
- shooting over the back of a jeep mounting a machine gun as the cab passes the intersection
The driver picks up his radio and reports into it
- shooting through the windshield as the driver reports by radio, his eyes shifting to follow the moving cab
-   - Helen is biting her lips nervously
She steals a sidelong glance at Klaatu to find him staring ahead, deeply preoccupied and concerned
(trying to give him encouragement) It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's
'm worried about Gort
'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me
Gort
(puzzled) But he's a robot
mean -- without you, what could he do
(slowly) There's no limit to what he could do
He could destroy the Earth
(with great urgency) If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort
You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto
" Please repeat that
(shocked and bewildered, she repeats nervously) "Klaatu barada nikto
" (gravely) Remember those words
Helen nods, repeating the words soundlessly
of vehicle drivers reporting by radio as their eyes follow the progress of the taxi
(These should be shot so we don't hear what is said
) - listening to these reports
Then he speaks into his transmitter with quiet tension
(into radio) Attention, Zone 5
Section number 2 -- block off Tenth Street at Massachusetts
All vehicles close in
The Colonel motions to his driver and the staff car pulls out
- as a convoy of eight vehicles moves down the street going very fast and swings around a corner
of individual vehicles that have been waiting at intersections, as they pull out and down the main streets to converge on the taxi
at a major intersection, as the convoy of eight vehicles previously seen dashes through the intersection and stops
The cars quickly arrange themselves so that they form a roadblock, completely sealing off the street
shooting over the driver's shoulder
The cab is proceeding down the street
When the road block comes into range of its headlights
The driver, who has been getting uneasy, turns to face his fares accusingly
Hey, what's this all about
As he slows his cab down, Helen leans forward into scene
Frenzied, she is about to urge the driver on when Klaatu puts a restraining hand on her shoulder
- shooting down the street from the barricade, as the taxi stops
Army cars are closing in behind the taxi, so it is trapped
The cab door ovens and Klaatu steps out, making a run for the entrance to a pedestrian underpass
- It is one of the lead vehicles in the group coming up behind the taxi
It mounts a
30 caliber machine gun and, with the Jeep still moving, the gunner fires a burst at Klaatu
- He's on one of the vehicles that form the barricade
He takes a bead on the running figure of Klaatu and fires
- He has almost reached the underpass
His hand is on the railing when he slumps to the ground, badly hit
In a moment, Helen rushes into scene, dropping down to hold Klaatu's head in her arms
He looks up at her with a feeble smile
Then his face takes on an expression of urgency
(weakly, insistently) Get that message to Gort
Right away-- Klaatu is unable to say any more
He is dead
Helen looks around wildly, helplessly, with tears and terror in her eyes
as the soldiers pile out of their vehicles and close in on the place where Klaatu lies
He is their first and all- important concern, and Helen finds herself pushed out of the way, toward the edge of the growing crowd of soldiers
Shocked and, staggered by what's happened, she realizes she must get to Gort
Taking advantage of the milling confusion in the dark, she edges toward the pedestrian underpass until she can slip into its entrance without being noticed
And she disappears
: -
-  - In the eerie light of the huge building, the great robot stands encased in a solid block of clear, transparent plastic
As    slowly, we hear a low whirring sound, as of power being generated
faint glow, visible through the plastic, emanates from Gort's body
His eyes, which seem to express rage, shifts as though he were straining to break out
As the whirring sound and the glow of Gort's body increase in intensity, the sharp edges at the top of the ice- like block melt into roundness and the plastic starts to drip away
(About 150 folding chairs are arranged on the floor near the space ship for the meeting tonight
) -
- The whirring sound can be heard faintly from inside
The two soldiers standing guard at the door hear the sound and listen apprehensively
The two men exchange an uneasy glance
After hesitating a moment, one of them decides to investigate
He turns and goes inside the door
-
- As he stops and looks up at the robot, his eyes go wide with terror
- Gort is an awesome and terrifying sight
His head is free now and he seems to be straining against the plastic, which is dripping down the sides of the block
- He glances around nervously to see that his companion has entered the building and is staring up at the robot, bug- eyed
Slowly the second soldier moves up beside the first
Wordlessly, they bring their rifles up to the ready and click them off safety
In spite of their terror, they advance slowly toward the robot
- The whirring sound is ominous and his body glows brightly
And his eyes are fixed on the two advancing figures
- as they move toward Gort
- From inside him comes a new and terribly sharp crackling
sound
And from his eyes two pencils of light dart out
After a moment the crackling sound stops and the light goes off
from same angle as scene before last
But the two soldiers have utterly disappeared
as Gort resumes breaking out of the plastic
There is no sign of the two soldiers
-
-  - Hurrying along a footpath, nervous and distraught, she pauses for a moment, looking at the entrance of the building
Then she starts determinedly across the grass toward the entrance
with Helen as she approaches the entrance fearfully
Rallying all her courage and determination, she forces herself to step inside
-
- as she enters the huge, weirdly lighted building
She stops short as her glance falls on the awesome figure of Gort
Loneliness and terror grip her and she wants to run -- but she realizes she can't
- He has seen Helen and his flashing eyes bore into her
His upper body and arms are free now, and the plastic is rapidly melting away
- She is held fascinated by the robot's staring eyes
For another moment it looks as if she would, break and run
But she summons all her courage, and moves slowly toward Gort, whose legs are still held captive
- as she moves slowly, fearfully toward him
- The plastic is dripping off his legs now
With great effort, he pulls his legs free and steps out of the stuff
huge figure in the heavy shadows, he moves slowly and menacingly toward Helen
- as she stops advancing, rooted to the spot in fear
Then she starts backing away, keeping her eyes on him
- As the great, hulking figure approaches, Helen can't stand her ground
She turns and runs wildly toward the far end of the building
Gort follows her with unhurried, inescapable strides
Unwittingly, Helen has run into a corner, and the robot is closing in on her
- Her eyes go wide with terror as she realizes she's trapped
In a wild effort to run around him, she stumbles and falls to the floor
Immobilized with fright, she lies breathless, looking up at him
Then she gives a piercing scream
- as the great robot bends over her menacingly, arms outstretched as though to grab or smash her
- All hope gone, she is blessed with a moment of lucidity, and she remembers the message Klaatu told her to deliver
Gort--
(with desperate clarity) Klaatu -- barada -- nikto
- He pauses as he hears the words
His face doesn't change expression, but the words obviously have an effect on him
He hesitates thoughtfully for a moment
- Helen watches him in an agony of suspense
Then the robot slowly bends down, picks her up in his arms and starts walking toward the space ship
with Gort as he carries Helen, speechless with fright, to the side of the ship
He touches the side, and the ramp moves slightly out
He mounts the ramp, still carrying Helen, and disappears into the ship with her
And the ramp closes silently behind them
- as Gort carries Helen through the dimly lighted corridor into the main cabin, where he flips a switch that lights up the cabin
The robot proceeds to a small door leading off the main cabin and disappears with Helen inside it
- This is revealed as a weirdly equipped laboratory, the walls of which are lined with the most complex array of mechanical and electronic apparatus
Gort sets Helen down on a stool and indicates for her to stay there
Too terrified to move, Helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus
He starts flipping switches and turning dials
As a result, lights begin to flash and there's a strange series of mechanical noises
- Unable to guess the reason for these preparations, she is gripped with a terrible fear
Ignoring Helen completely, Gort finishes his work
Then he moves to the door and goes out, closing the door behind him
Helen rushes to the door and searches frantically for the knob -- only to find, to her terror, that there is none
Frenziedly she beats on the solid metal door
- as the ramp comes down and Gort steps out
With grim, determined strides he starts toward the entrance of the building as the ramp silently closes
: - The Colonel who was in charge of Klaatu's apprehension is speaking into a phone at the desk of the Police Sergeant
Standing by are three or four Army officers, among them a Captain and a Lieutenant
(into phone) Yes, sir, we've got the body here now
Downstairs in a cell
No question about it, General -- he's dead all right
Yes, sir
Yes -- understand
The General has apparently hung up and the Colonel does likewise, turning to the officers in the room
General Cutler's coming down here right away
(to the Lieutenant) Take a squad of men, Lieutenant, and post a guard around that cell
(to Captain) Captain, don't let anyone in or out of the building
The two officers mutter their "yes, sirs" and start off about their business
: - squad of armed soldiers, led by the lieutenant, is admitted to the corridor by a Police guard and they start marching down the corridor toward a cell at the far end
- This is a cell on the ground floor
In the far wall is a heavily barred window, beyond which is as alley
In f
g
are Klaatu's feet, stretched out on a crude table
As , the huge figure of Gort appears outside the barred window, Seeing Klaatu, he reaches up and yanks out the steel bars as though they were chicken wire
With a crushing blow of his knee he crumbles the brick and mortar below the window and steps inside the cell
He moves without interruption toward the body of Klaatu
Hearing the sounds of clattering metal and mortar, the soldiers race down the corridor toward the cell
shooting over the backs of the soldiers as they reach the cell and look inside
There they see the giant robot picking up the body of Klaatu and starting deliberately toward the gaping hole in the side of the building
They raise their weapons and fire at Gort, but the bullets have no effect on him
Continuing uninterruptedly, he steps over the debris and disappears, carrying Klaatu in his arms
: - as Gort enters the empty building, still carrying the body of Klaatu
with him as he strides over to the ship
The ramp opens and Gort goes inside
Then the ramp closes after him
Alone in the cabin, Helen is still terrified
She looks up, startled as the door opens and Gort enters, carrying Klaatu's body over to a long counter
Once again he starts fiddling with knobs, switches and dials
As Helen watches, speechless, he starts to fasten strange-looking electrodes to Klaatu's wrist and ankle
- shooting from the outside, near the front entrance to the building, through a window into the main room where the Police Sergeant's desk is
The Lieutenant who was ordered to guard Klaatu's cell is excitedly reporting to the Colonel how Gort broke in and took Klaatu's body
Considerably agitated, the Colonel snaps orders to the other officers, glances at his watch and motions for the Lieutenant to follow him
He and the Lieutenant cross to the door and   with them as they come outside the building, hurry down the steps and get into a staff car
Several other Army vehicles join the staff car as it roars away from the curb
: -
- good many of the 150 chairs are filled, and more guests are still arriving
There is no one to greet them at the door, so they wander in and seat themselves
Gort is still working over the body of Klaatu
From a socket in the wall he pulls a strange-looking hypodermic needle on the end of a cord or tube and gives Klaatu a shot in the arm
- as she watches, fascinated in spite of her terror
Gort fiddles with the dials again and there are electrical cracklings and sputterings
Suddenly he flips a switch and all sound ceases
Gort removes the electrodes and watches Klaatu
on Klaatu and we see him start to breathe
In a moment his eyelids flutter
Then his eyes open and he looks around
as Klaatu slowly lifts himself to a sitting position
Helen watches breathlessly as he glances around the room, as though to orient himself
Then he lowers his feet to the floor and stands up
He blinks uncertainly, then smiles at them
(with a grateful glance at Gort, he turns to Helen) Hello
(staring at him) --  thought you were-- (nodding, with a smile) was
(looking at Gort in awe) You mean he has the power of life and death
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit
(indicating the equipment Gort used) This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period
It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people
(concerned for him) But how -- how long--
How long will  live
(he shrugs) That no one can say
Klaatu moves one of the sliding panels and reaches for a suit of his "other world" clothing from behind the panel
With a nod of apology, he steps behind the panel to change
-
- shooting from the door
In f
g
Barnhardt, who has just arrived, is greeting several friends outside the door
In b
g
a staff car and three or four other Army vehicles are driving up
- As the convoy pulls up to a halt in front of the building, the Colonel hurries out of the staff car and moves over to Barnhardt
Barnhardt is motioning his friends into the building as the Colonel comes up to him
- The Colonel speaks to Barnhardt with deference but with unyielding authority
'm sorry, Professor Barnhardt -- have to ask you to call off this meeting
Call it off
But  had permission from the Army-- know you did
But the robots on the loose now and it isn't safe around here
You'll have to get your friends out of that building
-   - as Klaatu steps out from behind the sliding panel where he has changed into his "other world" tunic
Gort and  will be leaving soon
Helen is genuinely upset at the thought of his leaving and the knowledge that he is to die
There is a compelling warmth of feeling between these two
(simply, sincerely) We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and
(smiling to conceal her real feelings) He won't have anyone to play with
He'll have you -- and Tom
(quietly -- definitely) No
That's all finished
'm sorry
(she is sensible and objective, but not unfeeling) think 'm very lucky
You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it
Klaatu looks at her in warm, considered admiration
Then he moves to one side of the cabin and flips a switch
Suddenly an entire section of the side wall is made transparent
Through it, as through a screen, we can see out into the building
Most of the chairs are already occupied, and latecomers are still moving in through the door
Facing the group, on a little dais, is Barnhardt
As Klaatu and Helen watch, Barnhardt raps for order and begins to speak
His voice comes in the ship through a speaker
Ladies and Gentlemen-- -
- He addresses them gravely, with a note of terrible disappointment in his voice
called you from your work and from your homes all over the world because we were to meet here tonight with a man from another planet -- the man who came here in this ship
(there are audible exclamations of surprise and disappointment) As you all know, this is no longer possible
can only say that  share the bitterness of your disappointment
with the above are group and individual shots of the people in the meeting
They are the cream of Earth's intellectuals -- scientists, churchmen, educators, leaders of social and political thought
There are several women among them
There are turbaned Indians, Chinese, Japanese, several Negroes
All religions are represented
Every important world power is represented
- Klaatu and Helen are watching and listening, as the last sentence of Barnhardt's speech above comes over the speaker
Klaatu flips off the switch, which cuts off the view of the meeting and also Barnhardt's voice
At this moment Gort moves across the cabin and Klaatu speaks to him
Gort -- berengo
Gort moves off obediently
-
- Full of chagrin, he continues addressing the meeting
--under the circumstances, the Army people have asked us to leave the building
And, since their concern is for our safety,  can do nothing but suggest that we comply-- Barnhardt is interrupted by the sudden and unexpected appearance of the ramp, silently opening out of the side of the space ship
- ' as they react in startled amazement to the mysterious appearance of the ramp
Then, as they watch, there is a sudden gasp of terror
- as Gort appears on the ramp and walks slowly down to the ground
In a moment, Klaatu and Helen appear at the entrance of the ship
Helen comes down the ramp to join Barnhardt, while Klaatu remains at the head of the ramp
The Colonel stands near the door, flanked by a group of soldiers, their rifles at the ready
The Colonel is startled by what he sees
His eyes are on the revered figure of Klaatu and he's debating what he should do
- He is a figure of intense dignity in his impressive otherworld tunic
He stares with even defiance at the armed soldiers, as though holding them off by sheer weight of his personality
He turns to look out at the audience, which is held spellbound
Then, after a breathless moment, he speaks
(straightforwardly, with almost stern authority) am leaving soon and you will forgive me if  speak bluntly
(he pauses, studying the faces) The Universe grows smaller every day -- and the threat of aggression by any group -- anywhere -- can no longer be tolerated
- of three of the delegates, listening intently
(These three are from Russia, India and France
) ' (over scene) There must be security for all -- or no one is secure
This does not mean giving up any freedom except the freedom to act irresponsibly
- He is an American
' (over scene) Your ancestors knew this when they made laws to govern themselves -- and hired policemen to enforce them
- We of the other planets have long accepted this principle
We have an organization for the mutual protection of all planets -- and for the complete elimination of aggression
sort of United Nations on the Planetary level
The test of any such higher authority, of course, is the police force that supports it
For our policemen, we created a race of robots-- (indicating Gort) Their function is to patrol the planets -- in space ships like this one -- and preserve the peace
In matters of aggression we have given them absolute power over us
- emphasizing his great size and inscrutable expression
The normal blinking of his piercing eyes as he gazes imperturbably at the audience is his only movement
' (over scene) At the first sign of violence they act automatically against the aggressor
And the penalty for provoking their action is too terrible to risk
- The result is that we live in peace, without arms or armies, secure in the knowledge that we are free from aggression and war -- free to pursue more profitable enterprises
(after a pause) We do not pretend to have achieved perfection -- but we do have a system -- and it works
(with straightforward candor) came here to give you the facts
It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet -- but if you threaten to extend your violence, this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned- out cinder
of four delegates, reflecting their stark terror and bewilderment
And a cut of the Colonel and the soldiers, impressed and held by what Klaatu is saying
- as he concludes quietly, incisively
Your choice is simple
Join us and live in peace
Or pursue your present course -- and face obliteration
(after a pause) We will be waiting for your answer
decision rests with you
By the time he reads the last line, the a
- along a row of their faces, stunned and silent, their minds unable to cope with the enormity of what they have heard
on Klaatu as he is saying goodbye to Barnhardt and Helen
He turns then and speaks to Gort, glancing up at the building as he does so
Gort -- veracto
- He looks up at the roof of the building, and once again we hear the peculiar generating sound from within him
including the delegates, the space ship, everything that is inside the building
As we watch, the roof and walls of the temporary structure suddenly disintegrate as the tanks did in the opening
The entire layout -- delegates, space ship and all -- remain exactly as they were except that instead of being under a roof they are out in the open Mall under a starry sky
The area is ringed with the debris of the building
Klaatu is standing at the head of the ramp as Gort comes up the ramp and disappears inside the ship
Klaatu is nodding goodbye to Barnhardt and Helen
- as they wave to Klaatu
Barnhardt is moved and impressed, and Helen's face shows her emotions at this strange parting
- He nods and smiles at them with warm affection
Then he turns and disappears into the ship, and the ramp closes behind him
- From inside the ship comes the muffled roar of great power generating -- not the sound of earthly motors, but of a tremendous dynamo
- watching breathless, stunned by what they have heard and seen
- As the sound from inside it builds to a climax, the great ship takes off with a tremendous roar
All are deeply moved and impressed
In the mind of each is the burning question that Klaatu has posed for them
- as it soars away into the inky blackness of the outer spaces from which it came
