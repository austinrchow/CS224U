"  " Screenplay by Tom DiCillo 1995 battered 35mm movie camera stands alone on a wooden tripod surrounded by blackness
Opening credits begin
An almost imperceptible  in toward the movie camera
The dolly forward continues throughout the credits ending in an of the camera's lens, filling the frame like a giant, glass full moon
Fade to
Suddenly a door opens directly in front of the camera, wiping the lens and revealing the following scene in Black and White
quiet, deserted industrial street
It is over an hour before dawn and the street is still cloaked in the heavy stillness of night
In the weak light filtering out of their battered van, and  -- the Craft Service Managers, finish setting out breakfast supplies on a 6' table
They work in almost complete silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep
cheap walkie- talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy Oreos, sputters and buzzes occasionally
Other items on the table include a mangled banana, seven grapes, and a box of chocolate covered donuts
What time is it
Four
Why
This milk is bad
(sniffs) When did you buy it
Tuesday
don't know
What's today
Monday
(pause) There's a deli on Broadway
Nothing closer
Nothing that's open
(sniffs the milk) Is it that bad
don't know
You're the one who said it was bad
At that moment a large truck grinds around the corner and shudders to a stop in front of the building
Bert replaces the carton of milk neatly beside the orange juice
/ Amid low, one-word greetings, the  tumbles out of the trucks and stands in a groggy cluster around the Craft Service table
-- the Cameraman, assumes a place of prominence
He wears a black leather coat, a black beret, and black leather half-fingered gloves
This is the worst fucking coffee 've had in my life
Then don't drink it
What're we doing today
(pulls out a wrinkled callsheet) "Interior
Living Room
Ellen talks to Mom
" Any nudity
Yeah, you have to take your fucking pants off
'll do it
like Ellen
Yeah, she's a babe
She was the nurse in that Richard Gere movie
worked on that
The shower scene
Start with the 5K in the window
Run feeders for three blonds into the living room
Two people
Sitting
Standing
Who fuckin' knows
(walks off) "Ellen talks to Mom
" / sits quietly in the back seat of a beat-up station wagon
She glances out at the empty city moving past her window and lets out a deep sigh
, the young intern assigned as her driver, glances into the rearview mirror
Tired
No, 've been up since four
've got a big scene today and 'm kind of nervous
"Ellen talks to Mom
" Have you read the script
No
It's on the callsheet
Oh
Well, it's pretty emotional tell my mother  never felt she really loved me
You're going to yell at each other
don't know
'm just going to go with how  feel
Which is the scary part
'm very close to this character
Problems with your own mom
Yes
But she died before , well before we could reconcile
You were great in that Richard Gere movie
Thanks
/ sidewalk
pair of women's orthopedic shoes enter the frame and begin pacing
Camera pans up to reveal , a small woman in her early 60s, pacing beneath the awning of her residential hotel
She appears to be rehearsing dialogue with herself
Ellen,  have no memory of this whatsoever
Ellen
Ellen  have memory of this whatsoever
Jeff pulls the car up to the curb and Cora gets into the back seat
/ Good morning, "Mom
" (gruff) Morning
Sleep well
Not a wink
Cora immediately lights a cigarette
Nicole instinctively wrinkles her nose and turns away
Cora notices this and makes an exaggerated effort to keep the smoke away from Nicole by blowing it hard out the side of her mouth
Jeff glances back at the two women in the rearview mirror
No one speaks
/ -- the Director,  -- the Cameraman and  -- the , stand in a loose triangle on the darkened set
All are holding coffee cups
The Gaffer can be seen in the background fumbling with a light
Look, 'm not blaming anybody, Wanda
'm just saying we left last night and  knew we didn't get that scene
'm sorry,  thought it was a great scene, Nick
It was ; and it's going to be alright
But 'm not settling for today
This is a big scene and 'm not leaving till we get it
Whatever it takes, Nick
We're here for you
Alright, here's what 'm thinking
Wolf,  want to do the whole scene in one shot
It's been done
know that but 'd like to try it anyway
Handheld
No, dolly
We go from Close-up to Wide-shot and back to Close-up in the same shot
'll use the 35, minimize distortion; 'll light it all from the ceiling
It could be kind of great
Sounds incredible
How long, Wolf
'll need to see a couple run- throughs
Not too many
It's a tough scene for the actors
want them to feel relaxed, fresh
We've got all day, Nick
Whatever it takes
What do you think, Wolf -- an hour, 45
don't know how you drink that shit black, Nick
got to dump in the milk
It's the only way  can cut the taste
Suddenly the Gaffer turns on the 5K, flooding the room with harsh, blinding light
Jesus
What the fuck
Flame on, asshole
The screen goes completely
/ Screen is still white
Gradually it shifts back to proper exposure revealing  in Medium
Her eyes are riveting; it is obvious she is emotionally primed for the scene light meter is thrust in front of her face
She barely registers it
, the entire Living Room set
Nicole sits on a sofa facing Cora seated opposite in an overstuffed chair
Two flats have been joined at right angles to create the Living Room corner
table lamp and assorted framed photographs complete the rather scrawny looking set
Most of the movie crew is seen, including Wolf looking through the camera
, picture's up
Quiet
Stop the work
Lock it up
Going for picture
Nick approaches Nicole and Cora
, nice and easy
Cora you're doing fine
Remember, really listen and really answer
(smiles at Nicole) 've got nothing to say to you
Just let it happen
It's all there
Ready, Nick
Look at this a second, Nick
Nick moves behind the camera and looks through the eyepiece
Another  of Nicole fills the frame
The image is visually and emotionally breathtaking
pushed in a foot
She's incredible
It's coming right through the lens
Nick grips Wolf's shoulder in gratitude
That's great, man
Beautiful

Let's go
Right away

Scene six, take one
(hits the sticks) Action
:  1 From the moment Nick calls "action" the film will cut directly to the shot the set camera is filming
The shot is fluid, graceful and in richly, beautiful
Nicole's performance is very strong; flawed only slightly by her nervousness
Dad hit me first and knocked me down
It didn't hurt that much but  started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone
He went over and started hitting Danny
Ellen,  have no memory of this whatsoever
You were just standing there looking at me
Then you pulled me up and said, "You're not hurt
" Like  was disgusting for faking, for doing the only thing  could think of to keep him from hitting me again
was worried about Danny
You do remember
He was smaller than you
Nicole turns to Cora with the heartbreaking gaze of an abandoned child
Nick and the rest of the crew watch in awe
You were so worried about Danny -- Suddenly the  dips all the way into the shot
/ Cut
Boom in
Sorry,  had to cut
Les, your boom was all the way in the shot
Well, where's the frame line
All the crew move around, all talking at once
, can we get a frame line
Hold it down
We're going again right away
Nobody moves

Nick is in ecstasy
Dad hit me first and knocked me down
It didn't hurt that much but  started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone
He went over and started hitting Danny
Ellen,  have no memory of this whatsoever
Suddenly a car stops right outside, a heavy, bass-driven rap song blasting out of its trunk-mounted speakers
/ Street noise
That's a cut
(into her walkie) What the fuck's going on down there
You call that a lock-up
Get that car out of there
Jesus Christ
Why doesn't the guy just get a flatbed trailer with about 600 speakers on it and tow it behind his car
Everyone nods in annoyed agreement; everyone except the Boom man who appears to be following the music with the mike, bopping to it through the headphones
Slowly, interminably, the music fades off into the distance
And
it's clear
(into her walkie) Do  have a lock-up

Then you pulled -- Suddenly the  drops into frame again
/ Boom's in
Jesus Christ
Where
The whole left side of frame, Les
Alright, can we please get a motherfucking frame line please
The frame keeps changing
That's the idea, Les
May  make a suggestion
Is it possible to maybe break the shot down
Maybe two shots instead
Might make it easier for Les
No
Then  need ten minutes to switch to radio mikes
Your call, Nick
There won't be any other sound problems
No more boom problems
Switch to radios
That's a ten-minute break
Release the lock-up
Stand by
(to the ) Get me a coffee
Half milk
/ Nick looks for Nicole but sees only Cora standing by the couch
Les has both arms up the back of her dress, running the wire to her radio mike
She's wearing stockings rolled down to just above her knees
Nick turns and spots Nicole by herself in a dark corner of the set and walks over to her
/ 'm sorry about all this, Nicole
It's not your fault, Nick
Is there a way to use some of the earlier takes
Not unless  change the shot; do a cutaway of Cora or something and intercut the takes
don't want to do that
It's a really nice shot and what you're doing is incredible
Thanks, Nick
The radio mikes are going to make everything easier
So, look
Take a moment
Let all this shit go
We don't roll till you're ready
Nick moves back to the set, leaving Nicole in the shadows
Camera stays on her as she begins emotionally preparing herself once again
(
) How was she in that Richard Gere movie
(
) So-so
Camera slips halfway through an open bedroom door, holding Nicole on one side of the frame while revealing  the Script Supervisor and  sitting on the floor smoking
Though separated by the wall, Nicole hears everything the two women say
Her career really took off, didn't it
saw her in a Michael Bolton video
She is nice; but  could do a better job
Camera slips into a  of Nicole
She closes her eyes as the two women continue talking about her
Screen goes
/ scrim, held by the Gaffer, passes in front of the camera, revealing the set with Nicole and Cora settling in for a take
Where's that flag going
It's a scrim

Nicole shows the first signs of losing her concentration
Dad hit me first and knocked me down
It didn't hurt that much but  started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone
He went over and started hitting Danny
Ellen,  have no memory -- Suddenly there is a tremendous  sending bits of glass flying through the frame
Cora jumps, clutching her chest
Oh, God
/ the light the Gaffer had been holding the scrim before
It is smoking and shattered
Jesus fucking Christ
(to the Gaffer) Kill it
Kill it
Pull the plug
Right there by your foot
That's a cut
Anybody hurt
Cora, are you alright
Cora nods wordlessly, gasping for breath
Props
Props
Let's get a broom up here right away
Clear the set
/ Nick, Cora, and Nicole stand in a corner of the landing
Nick is making obvious attempts to lighten the mood
Well, let's see
What do you think is going to happen next, Cora
'm going to have a heart attack
No, you're not
You're going in there in two minutes and we are really going to nail this scene
know it
have no doubt about it
Nicole
Nick turns to Nicole and stops in midsentence
He looks at her for a long moment
Nicole returns his gaze then suddenly looks away
(
) Nick
Nick
One second
Nick hesitates a moment then rushes back to the set
'll tell you this much right now; am never, ever doing another fucking low-budget movie
/ Nick joins Wanda and Wolf on the set couch and chair
What's up
Wolf and  were talking
Ellen's losing it a little bit
You got three quarters of the scene really, really incredible in the first take
Do a quick cut-away and all you need is a pickup of the last part of the scene
Wolf
You know how  feel;  love this shot
Hell,  designed it
Then let's just stick with the game plan,
It's a simple shot
We're going to get it this time,  feel it
We're here for you, Nick
Whatever it takes
Nick moves off
Wanda stares at Wolf who studiously inspects his light meter

:  6 As the scene begins again, it is obvious that both actresses are completely distracted
Nick's face betrays a rapidly increasing anxiety
Dad hit me first and knocked me down
It didn't hurt that much but  started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone
He went over and started hitting Danny
There is a long awkward pause as Cora realizes she can't remember her line
/ Cut
That's , Cora
What's the line
Just say it to me; no acting
(pause) "Ellen,  have no memory of this line whatsoever
" Amid general tittering from the crew, Wanda yells out

Scene six, take seven
(hits the sticks) Action
:  7 The scene begins again
Nicole is lifeless; she's merely saying the lines
Dad hit me first and knocked me down
It didn't hurt that much but  started crying anyway -- was worried about Danny
Nicole stops cold, completely thrown by Cora jumping her line
'm sorry, 'm lost
/ Cut
It's
No big deal
Nick's voice has the rigid tremble of someone barely able to keep from screaming
Everyone relax
We're just going to run the lines
That's all
No acting
Just run the lines
Then we're going to shoot this fucking scene
/ Nicole gets up quietly and sits next to Cora on the couch, wordlessly taking her hand in hers
(whispers) 'm so sorry
'm fucking this up for you
(whispers) Cora, don't even think that
You're doing great
'm the one who's fucking it up
If  get through this  swear 'm never acting again
She means it
Cora glances up at her, seeing for the first time how pain and defeat have drawn the life from Nicole's face
On an impulse Cora reaches out and gently lifts a strand of Nicole's hair from her eyes
sudden amazed alarm fills Nicole
The living room grows strangely quiet
(faintly, from a distance) And, action on the run-through
Nicole
She looks quickly toward Nick in confusion
to a nurse moving quickly past the camera and out the open door of the hospital room
Nicole, seated on the edge of the hospital bed
Still confused, she looks down at the old woman lying in the bed
The woman's face is pale and drawn
As Nicole leans closer her mother reaches out and gently brushes a strand of hair away from her face
The gesture is one of love, acceptance, and farewell
It is identical to the one we have just seen Cora make to her
(
) And action on the run-through
/ , the Living Room Set
Nick, Wanda, the rest of the crew standing quietly
Nicole glances over at Cora and instantly something unspoken and unexplained passes between them
The run-through begins
From the moment Nicole opens her mouth it is obvious there has been a remarkable change in her
Every word now has the stunning clarity of truth
Cora is completely engulfed in the moment
Dad hit me first and knocked me down
It didn't hurt that much but  started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone
He went over and started hitting Danny
Ellen,  have no memory of this whatsoever
You were just standing there looking at me
As Nicole continues, one by one the crew turn and watch this exquisite moment happening before them
Nick's face is lit with rapture
(whispering) Roll camera
roll camera
He glances over and to his horror sees that no one is behind the camera
He whispers frantically to the
Where's Wolf
(whispers) In the bathroom
he doesn't feel good
(whispers) Get him
Get him
Nick turns back to the scene, watching its beauty now in agony
Then you pulled me up and said, "You're not hurt
" Like  was disgusting for faking, for doing the only thing  could think of to keep him from hitting me again
was worried about Danny
You do remember
He was smaller than you
You were so worried about Danny
What about me, Mom
Why weren't you worried about me
There is a heavy, stunned silence as the scene ends
Nicole and Cora are in each other's arms
Pam and Cybil share a piece of tissue
: an extreme  of Nick
Where the fuck is Wolf
/ In the cramped confines of the dingy basement bathroom, Wolf pukes violently into the toilet
His face is pale and slick with perspiration
His eyes look upward toward the sound of Nick yelling
One second
Wolf tries to continue but another spasm of nausea wrenches him back toward the toilet bowl
/ The set is quiet, subdued
Nick sits on the couch with Nicole and Cora
Wolf sits groggily behind the camera wiping the sweat from his face
Wanda addresses the crew
, listen up
Nobody drinks the milk downstairs
It appears to be bad
Nick speaks uneasily to Nicole and Cora
He is a wreck and his insistent smile of encouragement looks absolutely demented
've had to, well 've changed the shot; we're just a little pressed for time
It'll just be a  of Ellen for the last part of the scene, starting with Cora's " was worried about Danny
"
'll find a way to cut this into the fourth take
We almost had it
That was unbelievable, both of you
But let's not think about it
That moment is gone, and
we'll, we'll get another one
have no doubt about it
Here we go
Nick walks over and stands beside the camera

Nick is so angry he can't even look at Wolf
Call it, Wanda

Scene six, Pickup, take one
(hits the sticks) Action
:  1 The scene begins at the pickup point
Miraculously, both Cora and Nicole are just as concentrated and engaged as they were in the run-through
was worried about Danny
You do remember
He was smaller than you
You were so worried about Danny
What about me, Mom
Why weren't -- In the middle of this final, delicate moment an insistent electronic beeping is heard
/ What the fuck is that
Sound
(frantically checking his equipment) It's not me
It's the camera
The fuck it is
It's off; it's not even running
The beep continues, growing louder
(into her walkie) What's going on down there
Do have a lock-up
Nothing
You don't hear a beeping sound
(to Nick) The street's quiet
Then what the fuck is it
It's somebody's watch
Everybody holds their watches up to their ears
Not mine
Not mine
Not mine
Not mine
And so on, until all watches have been checked with negative results
The beeping continues, growing louder and louder
Suddenly Nick loses it
He starts running around the set, ripping things apart, knocking over tables, lamps, chairs
He shoves Cora off the couch and whips off the cushions, heaving them against the wall with a startling violence
Where is it
You motherfucker
You cock-sucking motherfucking bastard
Where the fuck are you
Where
Where
Everyone watches Nick demolish the set in stunned, open- mouthed amazement
Nick turns to the crew in rage
Can someone help me please
Do have to do everything myself here
Nick loses it completely
Hey, Cora
Why don't you go learn your lines
Hey Scriptgirl, are you finally going to pay attention here
Hey, focus puller, you want to make a movie or get stoned
Huh,  got some great fuckin' Thai Stick here
Hey Wolf, you pretentious, beret- wearing motherfucker
saw your reel, man; it sucked
Who the hell would hire you anyway
Hey Wanda, next time can you wear a shirt that's a little more distracting to my actors
(to the Gaffer) Hey Bob
Hi Bob
Can you please make a little more noise on the dolly you creaky motherfucker
(to Cybil) What is your name
What do you fucking do around here
(to the Soundman) Hey Speedo, what's the matter
Can't even find a teeny fucking beep
of Nicole
She turns away, unable to watch anymore
The beeping continues
See what  have to put up with, Nicole
Maybe next time you'll do some of that magic on camera
But no, no -- wait till Wolf is puking his guts out, "Oh now 'll be good
" , the entire room
Nick's last word echoes throughout the silent set
Suddenly he stops in the center of the demolished set and lets out a long, wrenching scream
extreme  Nick's face, just as his eyes open
The film is in  now
The room is in heavy darkness except for the light on Nick's face
Nick reaches over and shuts off his clock radio
The digital dial shows 4:00
The beeping finally stops
Nick turns on a light and sits up in bed, drenched in sweat and still breathing heavily
God
(this is not a sigh of relief) The camera  swiftly back away from Nick
He stares at it in stunned amazement
Just then a  closes right into the lens turning the frame into complete
Out of the  a door opens away from the camera revealing  looking into her closet (the camera is inside the closet)
From this point on, the rest of the film is in except where specifically indicated to be Black and White
' She is wearing only a bra, black stretch pants, and cowboy boots
She rummages quickly through some blouses, selects the same garish one she wore in Part One, then walks away revealing  sitting on the edge of the rumpled bed
He is dressed exactly the same as when we last saw him, complete with beret
He struggles groggily into his socks and boots
The entire apartment is in disarray
bedside clock reads 4:13
Well, when did he ask you
Yesterday, when  was helping him check into his hotel
What, the guy can't even check into a hotel by himself
Listen, Wolf, having Chad Palomino in this movie will benefit us all
If being there when he checks into his hotel makes him feel better, then 'm happy to do it
Well, how did it come up
He asked me if  liked jazz,  said yes, and he suggested we meet tonight at a jazz club
like jazz
He did not invite you
(applies perfume) Why are you wearing perfume to work
Because  feel like it
You didn't wear it yesterday
Oh, stop it
You're acting like a child
Wanda playfully swipes at Wolf's face with a negligee she is returning to the closet
It misses him completely
My eye
Oh, God
Sweetheart, are you alright
Do  look alright
Let me see
Christ, we're going to be late
Wanda sits and perfunctorily examines Wolf's eye
The car is parked outside a rather seedy hotel
, the Intern and , the Director, sit quietly in the motionless car
Should we call up to the room again
He said he'd be right down
Nick lets out a huge yawn
Tired
'm exhausted
dreamt  was on the set all night
was just trying to do one shot and everything kept going wrong
That's an anxiety dream
Are you anxious about something
don't know
Sometimes  wonder what the hell 'm doing in this business
It's all just one compromise and disappointment after another don't know if  have the personality for it
Sounds kind of like an identity crisis
Maybe you're right
Who am
What am  really capable of
Maybe  should just get a job teaching at a women's college somewhere
How'd you get into cinematography
'm not a cinematographer
You're not
No
'm directing this movie
(pause) How'd you get into directing
In the dim light of the hotel room,   dresses quickly
He is young, handsome, with long blond hair sits nude on the bed, her back to the camera
The faint sound of a shower comes from the adjacent bathroom
They're waiting downstairs
Go ahead, 'll take a taxi
Oh,
Listen, 've got to tell you,  had a lot of fun last night, really, but for me, where 'm at right now in my life, a relationship is
Chad; hold it
This was a one-time deal
You know it,  know it
There is no need for melodrama
just thought you might
Look, all  ask is that you don't mention this to anyone
Hey, that's not my style
Good
So, 'll see you on the set
Palomino slips out the door
The woman falls back onto the bed, turning her face toward the camera
We see it is
God damn it
She lies for a moment, listening to the sound of the shower
The bedside clock reads 4:30
The car pulls up outside a  apt building
Jeff, Nick, and Palomino sit inside
got two films coming up right after yours, Nick
One  play a rapist that Michelle Pfeiffer falls in love with
The other 'm kind of a sexy serial killer who shacks up with Winona Ryder
That's great, man
Yeah, but 'm not into that hostess twinkie shit, Nick
Hostess twinkie
That Hollywood shit
It's all fluff, man
These are the kind of movies want to do, right here
'm glad you feel that way, Chad
And  just want to tell you, 'm really happy we can work together
Hey, me too
You're a great director, man
Your films are wacked
And 'm gonna be watching you, buddy
Like a hawk
want to learn from you, Nick
'm gonna pick your brain
Good
Then you can pick my nose
(big laugh) See what  mean
You're wacked
Hey, what are we sitting here for
We're waiting for Nicole
Nicole
She's takin' a tax -- (he stops) What
Probably taking a shower or something
Hey, how was her shower scene in that Richard Gere movie
Good
Really great
The three men sit in silence
, showing the car parked outside Nicole's apt, the men inside waiting
small, elegant bedroom set has been constructed in the middle of the huge empty space
One wall has a fake window
The  lies on the bed staring absently at the  sitting motionless beside the camera a few feet away
Neither speaks for a long moment
think we got nudity today
(reads from his callsheet) It just says "Scene Six: Ellen and Damian kiss
" Could be a kiss with nudity
like Ellen
She's my type
Why is that
She's pretty
Smart
Kind of kooky
Maybe 'll give her a part
That's right; 'm makin' my own movie pretty soon
Oh yeah
Yup
Feature
brought my script
The Gaffer tugs a thin, tattered , folded lengthwise, out of his back pocket
Palomino's perfect for the lead
'm going to give it to him right during lunch
Maybe right after
Alright
Got to be aggressive
You want to shoot it
Sure
You ever shot anything
No
That's alright; got to start somewhere
Suddenly the Gaffer reaches out and warmly shakes the 's hand
Nicole sits before the makeup mirror
, the male Makeup artist picks up a tube of Preparation  and begins applying it under Nicole's eyes just as Nick walks up
Jesus, what are you doing
Shrinking tissue
That's what this stuff is for
Let that sit for two minutes, pumpkin; 'll be right back
How'd you get here
Took a taxi
Oh
We've been waiting in front of your apartment for half an hour
God, 'm sorry, Nick
Something came up
forgot to call
'm sorry, feel like such an asshole
You're just saying that because you have Preparation  on your face
never should have gone out last night
hate jazz
God,  look terrible
No you don't
Don't bullshit me, Nick
'm not
You really look beautiful
Something in Nick's voice makes Nicole glance up at him
He looks away quickly
The moment is awkward, as if they both realize he has inadvertently revealed something
Just then Palomino approaches
Hey
How'd you get here, Nicole
took a cab
Oh, cause we were wondering how you got here
Nick looks at both of them in a moment of silence
Alright, good; everybody's here
We'll do a run-through as soon as you guys are ready
You got it, Chief
Lorde reenters as Nick leaves
Palomino sits in the chair beside Nicole and Lorde immediately begins his makeup
No one speaks
The crew is assembled behind the camera
Wolf is now wearing a black eyepatch over one eye
Nick is on the set, talking with Nicole and Palomino
Palomino wears a tuxedo and Nicole is in an elaborate low-cut gown
Hold it down, hold it down, people
Actors working
Great shirt, Wanda
(big smile) Why, thank you, Chad
, let's work out the rest of this blocking
Wolf -- (notices Wolf's eyepatch) What happened to your eye
little accident
You going to be alright
think so
It looks good on you, man
Nicole is standing here, Chad, you're there by the chair
Camera is close on Ellen: her first line
've always admired you from afar
Admired
That sounds rather professional
Good
"Professional," that's the cue; Damian steps up to the bed
Camera pulls back
The scene continues
Well, then: loved
How does that sound
It sounds like the champagne talking
've loved you from the moment we met
Why didn't you tell me
We were working together
didn't want anything to interfere
God
And all this time  thought
Then the kiss
How's that feel
Great
Nicole
Good
Wolf, any thoughts
Nope
've got a thought
What about Damian having an eyepatch like Wolf's
Let me think about that one, Chad
, you're the genius
Nick Reve, Living in Oblivion, Scene Six, Take One
Let's shoot it
One second, Chad
You ready for one, Wolf
Hell,  been ready
Alright, Wolfman
Good
Call it, Wanda
Going for picture
Lock it up
And roll sound
Speed
Roll camera
Rolling
Scene six, take one
And, action
Instantly the film cuts from color to /
Chad and Nicole begin their Love Scene
've always admired you from afar
Admired
That sounds rather professional
The camera starts to dolly, however Chad does not move
He goes out of frame forcing Wolf to pan abruptly to Nicole
Well, then: loved
How does that sound
It sounds like the champagne talking
've loved you from the moment we met
(finally moves to his mark) Why didn't you tell me
We were working together
didn't want anything to interfere
God
And all this time  thought
Palomino and Nicole embrace
Their kiss, like the entire scene, is flat, lifeless, and awful
Cut
Very good
Not for camera
Chad was completely out of frame
Yeah, Chad; what happened, buddy
Forget your cue
Oh no, man
held back
It really felt like something Damian would do; holding back to the last moment
Oh,  see
How's that for you, Wolf
don't care when he moves
Just give me a fucking cue
The Lone Wolf
What line did he move on
"Why didn't you tell me
" Alright, "me" is the new cue
Nicole, how does that feel to you
Fine, if that's what Chad wants to do
"Me, me, me," that's the cue
Let's shoot; 'm stoked
One second, Chad
Nick approaches the bed and speaks quietly to Chad and Nicole
Chad, how would you describe this scene, in one word
Great
It's a great scene, man
No,  mean it's a love scene
Right
Definitely
These two people really love each other
And we want to see that, especially in the kiss
Hey, say no more, Chief
Nicole
understand, Chief
Good
Here we go
Call it, Wanda
Going for picture
Lock it up
And roll sound
Speed
Roll camera
Rolling
Scene six, take two
And, action
've always admired you from afar
Palomino moves immediately to the bed, changing his blocking and causing the camera crew and Nicole considerable confusion
Admired
That sounds rather professional
Well, then: loved
How does that sound
It sounds like the champagne talking
've loved you from the moment we met
Why didn't you tell me
We were working together
didn't want anything to interfere
God
And all this time  thought
The scene once again is awful
Nick gives their listless kiss a few moments then calls
And, cut
Very good
Wolf
Chad missed his cue again; the whole dolly is unusable
Yeah, Chad
What happened;  thought you were going to hold back till "me"
The more  thought about it the more it didn't seem right
And 'm thinking, watch me here, instead of coming around the bed, what if just slip here like this and do the whole scene lying down
don't know, that seems a little
Hey, 'm just throwing out ideas here
Trying to get the juices flowing
Nicole, how does that feel to you
Well,  can turn to look at him
But won't you be shooting the back of my head
Plus Chad is completely out of the light down there
Hey, Wolf; 'm not worried about my face, man
It's about the acting; that's all  care about
It's your call, Nick
His acting or his face
For some reason  was hoping we could get both
(laughs) thought that's what we were trying to do here
'll have to set another light
We're ahead of schedule, Nick think we can afford a few minutes to set a light for Mr
Palomino
Good, let's do it
Ellen, Damian; let's talk for a second
As Nick, Nicole, and Palomino step off the set Wanda speaks to the crew in general
We'll pause to set this light and go again right away
How long, Wolf
Wolf doesn't answer, though he stands a mere foot away, watching the Gaffer set up a light
Wolf
Wolf walks away from Wanda without a word
The entire crew watches this
Nick, Palomino, and Nicole confer, all three smoking
, let's make sure we know what's going on here
These two people have loved each other for years, each of them not knowing the other was in love with them
And tonight, in this little room it all comes out
It's like a dam bursting
Does that make sense
Nicole
It makes perfect sense
just haven't found it yet
'll get it though
What about you, Chad
'm there, man
got the dam going, the river, everything
You watch, that little change in the blocking is going to open the whole scene up for me
(
) We're ready, Nick
Good
Let's go
Going for picture
Lock it up
And roll sound
Speed
Roll camera
Rolling
Scene six, take three
And, action
've always admired you from afar
Palomino saunters over and sprawls on the bed, forcing Nicole to turn her head completely away from the camera
Admired
That sounds rather professional
Well, then: loved
How does that sound
It sounds like the champagne talking
've loved you from the moment we met
Why didn't you tell me
We were working together -- 'm sorry, can we cut, Nick
Cut
That's a cut
Dammit
That was a good one
know, 'm sorry
But this feels really awkward; turning all the way around like this
Yeah,  think the lying on the bed is not quite working, Chad
Let's try one with the original blocking
Which one was that
There's been so many damn changes
Could somebody help me out please
The cue for the original blocking is "professional
" (intimate) Thank you
Thank you very much
, right away
Call it, Wanda
Nick
Could  just have a moment
Is that alright
Of course, Nicole; are you kidding
Hold the roll, Wanda
Holding the roll
Nicole remains seated on the bed, lowering her head and closing her eyes as she attempts to generate some emotion for the scene
Everyone watches her in complete silence
Palomino tiptoes over to the camera where Wanda and the Scriptgirl are standing side by side
As he leans between them, checking his lines on the Scriptgirl's script, he inhales deeply then exhales with a barely audible sigh
(whispers) Someone over here smells very, very nice
Thinking he means her, Wanda's lips flutter in a brief, involuntary smile
Meanwhile, the Scriptgirl turns away, blushing furiously
Palomino tiptoes again back to his spot
Nicole raises her head and nods once to Nick
She seems to have aroused some real emotion in herself
(with quiet intensity) Call it, Wanda
And roll sound
Speed
Roll camera
Rolling
Scene six, take four
(suddenly) Nick,  just had a great idea
Hold the roll
What is it, Chad
Just stop me if 'm out of line here, but she says "admired from afar," right
Doesn't it make sense to see Damian up close and her "afar
" You start on a Close-up of Damian, watch me here; as she declares her love, the camera moves with me into this primo two-shot that you and the Wolfmeister have set up here
What do you think, Wolf
don't like it
This is Ellen's scene
don't know; it sort of makes sense
Hey, you did it, man
It's all there in the writing
'd have to relight
Nick pauses, thinking hard
We're still ahead of schedule, Nick; if that means anything to you
Let's do it
(to the Gaffer) Get me a tweenie right here, with diffusion
, everyone stand by
We're pausing briefly to set one little light, then we're going again, right away
Stand-in please for Mr
Palomino
'll do it
Get the fucking light
Several members of the crew loiter around the table
The Scriptgirl approaches carrying a donut in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other
Palomino notices her and moves quietly to her side
Without a word he picks up the milk and pours some in her coffee
Nicole stands nearby and watches the following exchange
Thanks
My pleasure
Sugar
Just a bit
Palomino puts sugar in her coffee with extreme care
You like jazz
Very much
Maybe we could go hear some tonight
Palomino smiles and moves away just as Wanda comes up for a coffee refill
It's going well  think
Don't you think
Very well
What time do you think we'll finish
Early  hope
'm going to a jazz club tonight
Really
So am
He's wonderful, isn't he
Chad
He's so natural, like
air
Nicole approaches
wonder what his sign is
Do you know, Nicole
don't know his sign, but  think his moon is in Uranus
Wanda chokes hard on her coffee as Nicole walks off with a bitter smile
You don't have to be nasty
Palomino saunters onto the set as Wolf and his crew finish relighting
Yo, Wolfman
Is this my new mark
Until you change it
Where's my fucking eyepatch
Wolf walks off
The Gaffer slips the  a shrewd wink then walks over and stands next to Palomino, giving him a big, friendly grin
Hey, Chad
Hey, whatya say
'm Bob
'm lighting this show
Chad Palomino; Actor
(big smile) know
(to the ac) Hey, what's your name
Maurice
Maurice
Hey, Maurice Chevalier
Any relation
Probably not
Hey, smoking crew guys, really
The Gaffer slips his own script out of his back pocket and begins leafing through it
Hey thanks, Chad
Actually  wrote a script
Oh, yeah
Palomino takes the Gaffer's script and holds it up to his eyes, shading them from a light he's looking at across the room
He points to the light
Hey, Bill
See that light over there
Uh, yeah
Lower it about three feet
Palomino hands the Gaffer back his script and walks off
The Gaffer and  stand in silence for a long awkward moment
Nick intently scrutinizes himself in the mirror
Leaning closer he makes a careful adjustment to the way his hair falls over his ear, then steps back to examine himself
Would you care to have a drink tonight
Hey, Nicole, what do you say you and  have a drink tonight
Suddenly the door opens behind him and Nicole walks in
Oh, Nick
'm sorry
That's , no problem
'm just slapping a little water on my face
The two stand in embarrassed silence for a moment
Nick looks like he's gathering the nerve to ask her out
So, it's going pretty good, huh
Is it
Something feels off
Yeah, you seem a little tense
Do
But don't worry about it
Just take your attention off yourself and put it on Chad
Work off him a little more
, 'll try that
And listen,  know he's no Olivier
But he's got something, don't you think
Kind of a natural presence
Oh yes, he's very natural
Nick hesitates, again gathering his nerves to pop the question
So Nicole
anything else  can help you with
Actually there is
Could you maybe ask him to brush his teeth
Oh, sure
Wanda crosses the set and assumes her position beside the camera
Wolf sits behind it, barely a foot away
My eye is killing me
Put your eyepatch on
lost it
Is that little light set yet
That little light was set ten minutes ago
(into her walkie) Get me the  Team in here right away
Nick, Nicole, and Mr
Palomino
(to Wolf) Why didn't you tell me
Hey, you're not worried about the time, 'm not worried about the time
Oh,  am very worried about the time
know you are
What is that supposed to mean
What do you think it means
don't know what it means
Oh yes you do, you know exactly what it means
have no idea what you're talking about
Why are you -- You don't understand me, Wanda
You have no idea -- don't understand you
All  do is take care of you
Nick suddenly runs up just as Wolf and Wanda are on the verge of blows
Hey, hey, hey
What the hell's going on here
Jesus, Wanda
This is a very intimate scene and a lot of tension on the set doesn't help
Now, Wolf, let's just go through the first part of the move
Damian, on your new mark
Good
Close-up, Damian; Ellen in the background
Nick suddenly sees Palomino is wearing a black eyepatch
Chad, what are you doing
Hey, that's my fucking eyepatch
Wolf, could  borrow it
Cause 'm telling you, Nick; it really feels right
feel like this guy now, man
don't know, Chad
don't think it works
You're wrong, man
'm going to fight you on this one
Hey, it's my fucking eyepatch and don't want anyone wearing it
It's insanitary
Palomino removes the eyepatch and tosses it back to Wolf
Fine
'll get my own
Nick, send someone out for an eyepatch
'll fucking pay for it myself
Nick pulls Palomino aside and whispers to him confidentially
Listen, Chad
didn't want to say this in front of Wolf but it makes you look a little
gay
Really
Yeah, a little bit
Jesus
Palomino sneaks a glance back at Wolf then whispers to Nick
You're right
Thanks, buddy
Good call
Are you ready, Nick
One second
You need a rehearsal, Wolf
Let's just fucking shoot it
El Lobo
Palomino winks at Nick and walks back to his new mark, making a barely audible howling sound behind his hand
Call it, Wanda
Going for picture
Lock it up
And roll sound
Speed
Roll camera
Rolling
Scene six, take four
And, action
The scene begins again
Palomino milks his Close-up for all it's worth
've always admired you from afar
Admired
That sounds rather professional
Well, then: loved
How does that sound
Right on his cue, Palomino walks to the bed
As the camera moves into the 2-shot he begins stroking Nicole's hair with extreme care and concentration
It sounds like the champagne talking
've loved you from the moment we met
Why didn't you tell me
We were working together
didn't want anything to interfere -- God
Under the onslaught of escalating hair-stroking, Nicole suddenly jerks her head away hard
Palomino jumps up and begins pacing at the rear of the set
Cut
That's a cut
Hold the work, going again, right away
'm sorry, Nick
don't know why did that
'm sorry
Palomino suddenly stops pacing and addresses Nick with a curtness that is a little startling
Nick, could  talk to you a second
Palomino disappears behind the set, a jerk of his head indicating his wish for Nick to follow him
momentary delay
Everyone stand by
We're going again, right away
Excuse me, Ellen
You were a tad low on that take
Oh,
'll bring it up
Actually could  listen to the take before
The Sound man gives Nicole his headphones and rewinds the tape recorder for her
The first several lines of the last take are heard through the headphones
Nick follows Palomino behind the set, stopping just beside the fake set window
Palomino whirls on Nick and whispers fiercely
'm out of here, man
What's the matter
like you, but  made a big mistake taking this part
Have someone call me a cab
Wait a second, Chad
Just talk to me
What's going on
can't act with this woman
know she's a friend of yours but  got to tell you: she cannot act worth a shit
'm giving her everything
The whole thing  just did with the hair; did you see that
came up with that on my own because  thought it would help her
But no, she's giving me nothing
'm out of here
Nicole listens to the last line of the previous take
God, and all this time  thought
(the muted rustle of the kiss) The Sound man stops the recorder at the end of the take, sets the machine in standby mode, and picks up his crossword puzzle
Nicole is just about to take off the headphones when she realizes she can hear Nick and Palomino talking quite clearly
Glancing up, she sees the Boom man has left his boom leaning against the wall, the mike pointing out the open set window
(
) Why did you cast her
She sucked in that Richard Gere movie
(
) You're right
She is not the best actress in the world
see that now but you've got to help me, Chad
'm asking you to please help me here
We've got to get through this somehow
The camera begins a slow  in to Nicole's astonished face
This will be intercut with a similar  in to the microphone leaning against the wall, ending in an  of the mike
Camera is close on Nick and Palomino
'll tell you what this is about, man
You know why she took a cab this morning
Something came up
No
She was in my hotel room and she didn't want you to know it
'm sorry it had to come out like this but  told her this morning "thanks a lot, it was a lot of fun last night but let's get something straight -- it was just a one-time deal," and she didn't want to hear that
She wanted more, you see what 'm saying
It's rejection
The camera reveals Nicole now seated in her spot on the bed
She rises as Nick and Palomino reappear and approach her from behind the set
Nicole, listen
Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't working
apologize
Chad, apologize to you too
'm completely unfocused here and  think you're absolutely right; what we need to do is loosen the scene up somehow
Nick and Palomino stare at Nicole for a moment
What would you like to do
was wondering if we could try improvising the scene
More along the lines of what Chad has been doing
Maybe that would help me find something
Nick's smile of gratitude to Nicole looks almost drug-induced
That's a fantastic idea
What do you think, Chad
Hey, that's the only way  can work
Let's take it apart, let's cut loose
Good
And we'll shoot it
Hell, why not
Roll that motherfucking camera, Wolfie
Kiss my ass
Although Wolf says this quite loud, Palomino doesn't hear him because he suddenly yells: Yeah
Let's go
Alright, now we're making a fucking movie
Call it, Wanda
Going for picture
Lock it up
And roll sound
Speed
Roll camera
Rolling
Scene six, take five
And, action
Nicole stays seated, though Palomino moves around making a great show of loosening up
've always admired you from afar
Have you
That's, wow; that's incredible
But that sounds kind of professional doesn't it
Admired
You're right
How does despised sound
Great
(laughs) What's it mean
(laughs) It's sort of like  think you're a piece of shit
Palomino is somewhat startled by this
He looks to Nick in confusion
Nick silently encourages him to keep going
(another laugh) That sounds like the champagne talking
It's not
really do think you are a piece of shit
No, you don't
You love me
The fuck  do
can't stand looking at you
Then  guess  have nothing else to say
No,  think you have a lot more to say, Damian
Well,  am surprised you feel this way, Ellen
always thought you admired -- That's not what  meant
You should tell everyone what you just told Nick behind the set
Hey, this isn't part of the scene
Say it anyway: The reason this scene isn't working is because you and slept together last night
Did everyone hear that
fucked Chad last night
Nick and the rest of the crew stand in stunned amazement
See, Nick
told you this was about rejection
You fucking scumbag
You think give a rat's ass about you
was there to get laid and even that was a joke
You know, you are really starting to piss me off
Oh, does that mean you're not going to come wiggle on the bed anymore, or stroke my hair real soft and concerned, or kiss me like a soap opera acting piece of shit
Palomino snaps, and lunges for Nicole
She leaps to the other side of the bed
Come on
'll kick your ass
Come on
Nick steps between Nicole and Palomino
, guys,  think we can stop there
You bet your ass we can stop
Wanda, call me a cab
Hold on, Chad
Let's just try to calm down
Fuck you
'm out of here, man
This movie is bullshit
Now wait a second, Chad
There's no reason for hostility
Shut up, you fucking loser
The only reason  took this part was because someone said you knew Quentin Tarantino
You're nowhere, man
Hey, you want to go
Go
'm sick of your shit, you hostess twinkie motherfucker
What'd you call me
You heard me
Say it again
You hostess twinkie motherfucker
Palomino suddenly punches Nick in the stomach, leaving him bent over and gasping for breath
Nicole instantly leaps on Palomino's back and begins pounding her fist on the top of his head
Palomino spins wildly trying to dislodge her as Wanda rushes forward
Alright, everyone just stop
Stop
Stop this right now
As she tries to separate Nicole and Palomino, Palomino shoves her hard, knocking her down
Instantly Wolf leaps off the camera and runs up to Palomino
Alright, you've asked for it, Chad
Palomino suddenly punches Wolf in the teeth, dropping him like a stone
(shrieks) Wolf
Suddenly Nick staggers to his feet and rushes at Palomino
His momentum knocks all three backwards onto the bed, Palomino's head cracking Nicole in the teeth
Oh, God
Nicole rolls free as Nick and Palomino wrestle on the bed
Nick gets Palomino in a vicious headlock and starts pounding his head against the mattress
You want to pick my brain
This is the way  direct hostess twinkie scumbags like you
As Nick continues to pound Palomino's head the Gaffer notices Palomino's eyes are starting to bug out from the pressure of Nick's forearm around his neck
He and the Boom man rush forward and finally manage to pry Palomino free
Get him out of here
Someone take him back to his hotel
As the Gaffer and Boom man drag off the almost unconscious Palomino, the Scriptgirl takes one faltering step after him
(sniffling) Chad
Suddenly, everything becomes quiet except for Nick's labored breathing and the Scriptgirl's sniffles
Nick leans over and touches Nicole's shoulder
Are you alright
Don't touch me
The Gaffer and  help the still-groggy Palomino into the back of the production van
, the driver, watches them in sleepy curiosity
With Palomino safely propped in a seat, the  goes back to the set
The Gaffer waits a moment then slips his script out of his back pocket and slaps it into Palomino's motionless hand
It's called "Tsunami
"  Japanese tidal wave hits New York
You've an ex-Navy
frogman, working undercover
You save the city
You'd be perfect for the lead
That's my number; call me, or 'll call you
Either way it's been great working with you, man
As Palomino stares at him blankly, the Gaffer slams the door
The car pulls out
Nick and Nicole are sitting up on the bed, alone on the now empty set
Nicole, 'm sorry
didn't mean it
You were great in that Richard Gere movie
Shut up
You're no different than he is
You lie, you're deceitful
'm not lying
Christ,  tell everyone how great you are
've got nothing but respect and admiration for you
Oh God, now you're doing your own fucking script
Well, why do you think  wrote it
have no idea
It's about you
It's about how feel about you
Christ, did you get a bump on your head, Nicky
'Cause you're talking like an idiot
Nicole
've loved you since the day we met
Nicole sits for a long moment in stunned silence
Why didn't you tell me
didn't want anything to get in the way of us working together
God, and all this time  thought
Nick and Nicole move into a shy, trembling, heartfelt kiss
Nicole snaps awake with a jolt
She glances quickly at the clock which reads 4:35
The sound of the shower still running in the bathroom
Oh, God
Nicole leaps out of bed and races into the bathroom
As the camera follows her, she closes the bathroom door, right against the lens, turning the image to total
The frame is
The recognizable clatter and clunk of the   is heard
Wanda's voice is prominent
Don't go out that door
Suddenly a  opens away from camera and the  stops, a foot away from the lens
Behind him, Wanda and the rest of the crew can be seen through the door, preparing for filming
We see now the door and the plywood walls around it are
Why not
It's part of the set, goddamnit
Now go around
Next time
This is an emergency
The  rushes past and a moment later the camera slowly through the fake door toward Wanda pacing near the set camera
(into her walkie) Has Ellen showed up yet
ssss
kkkkkrrk
Get her into wardrobe right away
ssskk
ssssrrrk
No
Scene six; Scene five has been postponed
'm not going to say it again; Mr
Palomino is not working today
Now where is that smoke machine
, The  bursts through a door at the end of the hallway and walks quickly toward the camera
Without knocking he pushes open the bathroom door and suddenly stops short
Oh
Sorry
Standing on his tiptoes at the sink, straining to turn off the running faucet is,  a
He is dressed in a sky blue tuxedo with tails
top hat and white gloves rest on the closed toilet seat
Tito appears extremely annoyed
What do you want
need to use the bathroom
Kind of an emergency
Well, fucking knock
Tito grabs his hat and gloves and marches down the hall, the staring after him in astonishment
(muttering) swear to Christ, one of these days 'm going to punch somebody in the balls
Camera is close on Nicole, her eyes clenched shut as a thin white veil is placed on her head
Camera pulls back to reveal , the Costume Designer putting the finishing touches to Nicole's costume, which appears to be an elaborate white wedding gown
Nick stands nearby, smoking
Just as we pull up to your apartment Palomino suddenly says he feels so sick he can't work today
God
Was it something he ate
Stand up, please
don't know
Can he work tomorrow
Turn around, please
Don't know that either
But 'm not worrying about it
had this dream last night where  was on the set
You were in it, and another woman, someone older
Anyway, everything was going wrong
The harder  tried to hold things together the more they fell apart
And you know what that dream was telling me, Nicole
You just got to roll with it
And that's what 'm doing, 'm rolling with it
So, we'll just shoot the Dream Sequence today
Just then Tito walks in
Hey, Tito
You look great, man
feel like shit
No, you look good
Thanks for coming in on such short notice
This is Nicole; she's playing Ellen
Hello
Toto, is it
Tito
Oh, 'm sorry
Listen, if there's anything  can do to make you
if you need
uh, just let me know
Put a stool in the bathroom
Tito walks out, followed immediately by Sachiko, leaving Nicole alone with Nick
Did  just offend him
What did you say
"Short notice
" Come on; that was nothing
'm the one who called him "Toto
" Jesus, 'm out of it
dreamt  was on the set last night too
Oh yeah
Yeah
You were in the dream
Was  freaking out
Actually, you were
That's great:  freak out in my dream; freak out in your dream
No wonder 'm fucking exhausted
Nick
Yeah
Nicole stares at Nick for a long moment then smiles briefly and turns away
dented, ancient smoke machine squats forlornly in the middle of the set
(with eyepatch), the , ,  , and the   stand around it, scrutinizing it intently
Wolf seems in an unusually good mood
Alright, guys; special effects today
Could be fun
Who knows how to work this baby
It's the old -160
used it once in '85
Damn
'85
What's this
That's where the gas goes
No, that's where the oil goes
Is it
think so
You're right
It's coming back now
'm going to let you handle this one, Bob
This is your baby
And Les, if he needs help you give him a hand
, guys
We're all working together today
Wolf walks off
The Gaffer kneels to inspect the smoke machine closer
Yup, all coming back now
Like riding a bike
-160, 1985
1985, -160
Way to go, Bob
Wanda stands alone by the camera, looking around at the bustling crew like a battalion commander watching her troops in battle
Nick approaches her
How are we doing, Wanda
Not good, Nick
Not bad, but not good
We need to finish this scene and do Scene thirty-one today
Scene thirty-one
left my notes for Scene thirty-one at home
didn't know we were -- Nick, Nick
'll send someone to your apartment to pick them up
Now, relax
Oh,
Send somebody to my apartment to pick them up; it's the red notebook, under the bed
It's taken care of, Nick
Good
Great
Good
Nick walks off quickly, muttering to himself
moment later Wolf strolls up to Wanda
We're all lit, the smoke machine is under control; we're ready to go
(hard) What about the dolly
Just need to see a run-through and we're all set
'm going to make your job easy today, Wanda
Wandaful
(he slips his arm around her) Mmm, 'm glad you wore that perfume
And don't worry about Palomino; 'll take you to a jazz club tonight
Oh,  can't make it
have to go see Chad; he's extremely ill
Oh, by the way my eye's much better
Listen, Wolf, this may not be the best time to say this but our relationship is going nowhere
What do you mean
Please, don't take it personally
Because  care for you, Wolf,  really do
But 've had this feeling for quite a while and  think it's time we ended it
(pause) think it's better
So do
Well, good
Still friends
Sure
Great, cause we still have to work together and there's no reason it has to be unpleasant
Give me a hug
Wanda and Wolf move into an extremely wooden embrace
You're a real special guy, Wolf
Thanks
Wanda slips Wolf a tender smile then walks away
(into her walkie) , let's get the  Team in please
Nick, Ellen, Mr
Tito
Nick is working with the crew and the actors
The set consists of two flats (one with the fake door) joined to make a corner
The flats are painted fire-engine red
, here's the shot
We start wide with Ellen standing absolutely still right in the middle of the frame
You got that, Wolf
Yeah
(notices eyepatch) What happened to your eye
Nothing
It's a little sensitive today
Can you see
(snaps) Of course  can see
For a moment Nick looks like he might snap back at Wolf but he draws a deep breath and continues
, Ellen is standing there
The smoke is flowing in and: Ellen's line
am so hungry
Good, Tito, that's your cue
The fake door opens and Tito enters wearing his top hat and carrying a golden apple in his gloved hands
You walk around her once, hold the apple out, that's right; just beyond her reach
You're staring at her hard
Harder, good
Then stop right here
Can we get a mark, please
The  moves up to Nick and places a piece of yellow tape on the floor
the yellow tape
Then we dolly in to Tito's Close-up
Alright, Wolf
It should be hand-held
No,  think it's better on the dolly
Whatever
Nick, do  see him
No, just the apple
And Tito, right after we dolly in give me a little laugh there
little laugh
Big, little; anything you feel like doing
Good
Let's shoot one
Call it, Wanda
, here we go
Camera back to One
Action on the smoke
The Gaffer turns on the smoke machine which emits a pathetic wisp of smoke that immediately dissipates
And roll sound
Hold it, Wanda
Can we get a little more smoke
Is that possible
Oh, sure
The Gaffer adjusts a knob and another thin puff of smoke wheezes out
Good
Call it, Wanda
Going for picture
Lock it up
And roll sound
Speed
Roll camera
Rolling
Scene six, take one
And, action
Nicole stands motionless in the middle of the empty set
Her white wedding gown stands out sharply against the deep red walls
sad shred of smoke drifts by her head
am so hungry
Tito opens the door and walks in, staring hard at Nicole
His sky-blue tuxedo gleams in the rich light
He walks around her in a circle holding the golden apple just beyond her reach
He stops on his mark and the camera dollies into a of him
He doesn't laugh
Nick watches this for a moment in intense concentration
And
cut
That's a cut
Nick; comments
Yeah, just a couple
thought that was uh
good
Tito, that was very good, man, really
You didn't feel like laughing
laughed
Oh, ;  guess  missed it
You could make it bigger if you want
And Ellen, maybe just a little more tension when you see him
thought  didn't see him
Right, maybe you see him a little bit
Alright, 'm confused
Do  see him or not
You see him
, what is the tension
Who is Toto
(hard) It's Tito
(alarmed) What did  say
Toto
Oh, God
'm sorry, Tito
don't know why 'm doing that
'm really sorry
Ellen, come on now; concentrate
Remember; you're marrying Damian tomorrow
You're a little anxious
You have this dream
Let's call it an Anxiety Dream, and Tito represents the anxiety
Tito looking none too happy about this representation
It seems pretty simple
Let's just try it
Good
And Bob, let's really have some smoke on this one
, more smoke
still think it should be hand-held
Yeah, well,  don't want it hand- held
want it on the dolly
Where's my notebook, Wanda
On it's way, Nick
Good
Call it, Wanda
Lock it up
Going for picture
And roll sound
Speed
Roll camera
Rolling
Scene six, take two
And, action
Nicole stands motionless as a few more emaciated puffs of smoke hang in the air
am so hungry
Tito enters, walks around her holding the apple just beyond her reach then moves to his mark
The camera dollies into a He does not laugh
Cut
That's a cut
Going again, Nick
Yes
Going again, please stand by
, Ellen, good
You're on to something there
No, something's not right
It all feels fake to me
Nick's tone with Nicole suddenly takes on an almost imperceptible edge, tinged with annoyance
Well, it's not fake; it's real
Just remember, you really want the apple
Tito,  still think we could see more of a laugh at the end
What kind of laugh
Just a laugh
Show me
Oh,
laugh
'm thinking maybe like this
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Everyone watches Nick demonstrate the laugh
He seems unaware he resembles a drunken, slightly annoyed idiot
Something like that
And remember, Tito, this is a dream
Not everything has to make sense
laugh right there heightens our sense of
of
Anxiety
Exactly
Wolf, how was that for you
still think it should be hand-held
(snaps) Well, God damn it
It's not going to be
It's on the dolly so just forget about it
There is a strained moment of silence on the set as everyone witnesses this rebuke
And Bob, what the fuck is that smoke
Might as well get a couple hamsters in here blowing smoke rings for Christ's sake
The septic valve wasn't open
got it now
We're going to see some smoke now
Alright, let's try another take
And, lock it up
Nick, could  talk to you for a minute
What
In private
(sighs in exasperation) Alright
Nick follows Wolf off the set
Release the lock-up
Everyone stand by
We'll see some smoke now
Way to go, Bob
As soon as Wolf and Nick reach the darkened corner, Wolf whirls to face Nick
really don't like being spoken to like that, Nick
Yeah, well  don't like your attitude
don't have an attitude
The hell you don't
Every time  ask you to do something all  get is No, No, No and 'm sick of it
hired you to do a job; if you're not going to do it you better let me know right now
Wolf is about to yell back at Nick when suddenly he stops and lets out a deep, painful sigh
'm sorry, Nick
'm going through some heavy shit
What do you mean
can't really go into it
It's pretty heavy
Personal
Wolf makes a slight motion with his head toward Wanda who is standing some distance away watching them
Seeing the two men looking at her Wanda shoots them a hard glare which prompts Wolf and Nick to turn away quickly
Personal, professional, emotional
It's doing a number on me
And now you're telling me you're going to fire me
didn't say that, Wolf
Come on, 'm not going to fire you
You're doing a great job here
Am
Yeah,  don't know what 'd do without you, man
You've got a great eye just hope it's not the one under that eyepatch
Nick lets out a tense, strained laugh but Wolf's only response is to stare back at him sadly
Listen, Wolf
Let me tell you one thing 've learned; sometimes you just have to roll with things
You know
You're right
Roll with it, man
You'll be
Wolf lets out another deep sigh
Thanks, bro
The Gaffer, Boom man, and  kneel around the smoke machine
can of gas and a quart of oil stand beside them
That's where the oil goes
No, that's where the gas goes
'm tellin' you, Bob
That's where the oil goes
Lester, don't you think Bob knows where the oil goes
don't remember using oil in '85
Maybe both the oil and gas go in there
The Gaffer and Boom man turn and look at the  for a long moment
think he's right
think he is too
, three parts gas, one part oil
The Gaffer and Boom man pour liberal amounts of gas and oil into the -160
Nick rushes up to his position by the camera
Is my notebook here yet, Wanda
Any minute, Nick
Good
Call it, Wanda
Going for picture
Lock it up
And roll sound
Speed
Roll camera
Rolling
Scene six, take three
And, action
Nicole stands motionless in her white wedding dress, looking genuinely alarmed, possibly because of the huge clouds of smoke now spewing out of the panting smoke machine
am so hungry
Tito enters, stares at her hard and walks around her in a circle holding the apple just beyond her reach
The smoke is so thick both of them are barely visible
Just as Tito gets to his mark the smoke machine backfires with a tremendous explosion and begins filling the room with dense, blinding smoke
The smoke blanks out the entire frame
Frantic shouts are heard from unseen bodies
Cut
Cut
Cut
Turn it off
Turn it off
can't find the switch
Pull the plug
Bob
Pull the plug
Open the door
Get some water
got it
got it
The smoke machine emits a loud hiss and dies, filling the room with sudden silence
Slowly the smoke begins to clear as the crew moves around muttering and coughing
Clear the set
Ellen
Tito
Please step off the set
(
) 'm off the set
(
) So am
Then who is that
Who is that
Please step off the set
pair of fuzzy-slippered feet enter the smoky frame
The camera  up, passing over a woman's bare shins, a flowered, blue silk housecoat until finally coming to rest on the pleasantly smiling face of
This is the same woman who played Ellen's Mother in Part One; she is dressed exactly the same as she was in their scene
The camera pulls back to reveal  the Intern standing nervously beside her with a red notebook in his hands
Hi, Nicky
Nick gapes in utter astonishment
Mom
Wanda speaks urgently into the phone while Nicole stands beside her
Jeff (still wearing his hat) waits at a distance clutching Nick's red notebook
Cora Reve, ---
Blue housecoat, blue slippers
How do  know
Because she's sitting ten feet away from me
Well sweetheart, that's going to be a real fucking problem
Nicole turns away and walks past Jeff to the Craft Service table
She was waiting outside Nick's apartment when  went to pick up his notebook
She said she was looking for him so  figured  should just bring her up here
You look really pretty in that dress
Nicole nods politely then looks to the Makeup corner where Nick sits talking earnestly to his mother
How did you get here
took a bus in; went right to your apartment
How did you get out of your room
Oh,  just went right through the door
It was unlocked
No, it was locked
just went through it
It's something 've learned to do, Nicky
can walk through just about anything; like air
Mom, you've got to stop doing this
'm serious
'm a little upset with you
You could have gotten lost, or hurt
wanted to see you
've missed you
know, Mom; 've missed you too
But it's not really a good time
Nicole approaches, holding up the hem of her wedding gown
There is a subtle tension smoldering between her and Nick
They're sending a car
It should be here in a couple of hours
They didn't even know she was gone
Jesus,  don't believe this
'm sorry, Nick
If  knew there was going to be a wedding  would have worn my fucking hat
The camera holds on Tito pacing slowly, alone on the set
He is smoking fiercely, holding his top hat with one hand
Suddenly he begins laughing in a loud, stage bellow
Nick sets a chair for his mother and helps her sit down
Nicole joins Tito on the set and talks quietly to him
There
How's that, Mom
Can you see
Is the little fellow going to do gymnastics
Tito glances up at her quickly
Shhhh
No
Now come on, Mom
You've got to be quiet
Absolutely quiet
(whispers) Wanda and Wolf stand beside each other in tense, awkward silence for a long moment
How are you doing
Good; real good
Wolf looks as if he's about to burst into tears as Nick walks up
How's the smoke machine
It's dead, Nick
've got calls out to every Effects house in the city but  just can't seem to locate -- Forget it
We'll shoot without it
But Nick, it's a Dream Sequence
That's the way it goes, Wanda
We're just going to have to roll with it
Nothing else we can do
We've got to roll with it, right, Wolf
Wolf meets Nick's eyes and gives an extremely melancholy nod
Nick turns to address Nicole and Tito and the edge immediately slips back into his voice
, here we go
Ellen, you've got to keep reaching for that apple
don't feel that you really want it
mean, Christ, how many times do  have to tell you
Nicole glares at Nick for a moment then abruptly turns and walks off the set
Nick stares after her in confusion then quickly follows her
Everyone stand by
Nobody move
Going again, right away
Nicole stands with her back to the camera as Nick strides up to her with impatience
Alright, Nicole
What's the matter
You tell me
You're the one with the bug up your ass
Now wait just a second
You've been picking on me all day can't do anything right
'm sorry if  was short with you, Nicole, but  think you can see 'm under a little pressure here
'm shooting a Dream Sequence without a smoke machine, my mother's out there thinking she's at a circus wedding and you tell me the whole movie seems fake
never said that
You did too
You said, "Everything feels fake
" meant me
feel fake
Everything 'm doing feels fake
can't act should just do shower scenes in Richard Gere movies for the rest of my life
Nicole, that's ridiculous
You're a fantastic actress
All you have to do is show me you want that apple more than anything else in the world; don't give up
Understand
You cannot give up
Suddenly Wanda yells out
Ready, Nick
Ready
Nick rushes back onto the set
, here we go
Everybody focus, concentrate
And Tito, we're still looking for that little laugh, pal
Call it, Wanda
Picture's up
There will be no smoke in this scene
No smoke
No smoke in the Dream Sequence
And roll sound
Speed
Roll camera
Rolling
Scene six, take four
And, action
Nicole stands motionless in her wedding gown
am so hungry
Tito walks in, stares at her hard, then walks around her once with the golden apple just beyond her outstretched hands
He stops and the camera dollies into his -
Nick watches in hopeful expectation
He waits and waits but Tito does not laugh
Just then the door in the rear set wall opens and Cora steps in, looking oddly puzzled
Oh,  thought this was the  room
Cut
That's a cut
Going again, right away
Nick escorts his mother back to her chair
Mom, listen to me
don't want you to move from this chair
Do you understand
Oh Jesus, you sound just like your father
Mom, 'm serious
,
won't move
Thank you
Nick walks back on the set and addresses Nicole and Tito
, good
Very good
(laughs) Tito,  think we're having a little communication problem here
All want you to do is laugh
Why
told you why
Tell me again
Wolf (still wearing his eyepatch) walks over and sits quietly in a chair beside Cora
He does not speak to her and gazes blankly out at Nick, Tito, and Nicole on the set some distance away
Cora however stares at the side of his head with such intensity Wolf can't help but turn to her
Cora still doesn't take her eyes off him and in fact stares even more intently into his eye
Wolf glances away for a moment then looks back
Cora continues to stare at him
Suddenly, his eye is full of tears
Cora watches in rapt silence
Wolf is crying openly now
Cora reveals no hint of emotion as she reaches out and gently lifts the eyepatch off of his eye
tight smile of satisfaction creases her lips as a tiny pool of tears is released, streaming quickly down Wolf's cheek
No one sees this
Nick paces tensely in front of Nicole and Tito
Look, Tito
It's not that big a deal
It's a dream, alright
Strange things happen in a dream
All you have to do is laugh
Why is that such a problem
Why does it have to be a dwarf
What
Why does my character have to be a dwarf
He doesn't have to be a dwarf
Then why is he
Is that the only way you can make this a dream; put a dwarf in it
No, Tito; that's not -- Have you ever had a dream with a dwarf in it
Do you know anyone who's had a dream with a dwarf in it
don't even have dreams with dwarves in them
The only place 've seen dwarves in dreams is in stupid movies like this
Make it weird; put a dwarf in it
Everyone will go "whoa whoa whoa, must be a dream, there's a fucking dwarf in it
" Well, 'm sick of it
You can take this Dream Sequence and shove it up your ass
Tito hurls his top hat and gloves to the floor and walks out
Everyone stares at Nick who is frozen in stunned silence
Finally Wanda approaches him hesitantly
Nick
(no response) can get right on the phone
We'll try to get another
small person here as soon as possible
No
He's absolutely right
Nick sighs heavily and sinks to sit on the dolly in silence
Wolf appears behind him, still wiping his eyes
You want to just shoot Ellen, Nick
She could be in the dream by herself
No
We're not going to shoot anything
'm sorry
Thanks for all your help, but it's over
can't take it anymore
tried to roll with it but it's time to face the music;  can't do this
am not a director
The shoot is over
give up
Nick's speech has the simple eloquence of truth; he is not bitter or self-pitying
He seems unaware of how disturbing this is to the crew
They all stand around him in shock, afraid to move or speak
Finally Wolf turns to the  and puts his hand on his shoulder, like a father to his young son
Take the camera off the dolly
Start putting it away
Everyone watches the  unfasten the camera in silence
Nicole stands alone on the set in her wedding dress, still holding the golden apple
Her face is frozen in dismay
Suddenly comes through the set door and marches up to Nicole
Give me that apple
At the sound of his mother's voice, Nick looks up
He sees her snatch the apple from Nicole's hand and march back out the door, closing it behind her
(behind the door) 'm ready, Nick
Nick gets up slowly and whispers intensely to Wanda, Wolf, and the rest of the crew
Roll camera
Roll sound
Let's go
Right away
Wolf grabs the camera and puts it on his shoulder (hand-held) as the rest of the crew moves quickly and silently into position
On a terse signal from Nick the camera starts rolling
Nicole takes the silent "action" cue from Nick
am so hungry
Right on cue Cora walks through the door, holding the golden apple out in front of her
She circles Nicole with determination, seemingly oblivious to Nick and the rest of the crew hovering behind Wolf as he begins following her with the hand-held camera
Wolf is now in his element; gliding like Nureyev with the camera
When he pans suddenly with Cora the whole crew ducks wildly and dives out of camera range
Cora finally stops circling Nicole and stops abruptly
Suddenly she raises the apple right out in front of Nicole
Wolf glides forward with the camera, framing an amazing of the apple with Nicole seen behind it
Nicole reaches out, grabs the apple and takes a huge, resounding bite out of it
Nick's face, eyes wide in anxious delight
Cora takes one step forward
her fuzzy slippers stopping right on the yellow tape mark
Cora waits momentarily until Wolf has reframed both her and Nicole, then lets out a huge laugh
And cut
General mayhem erupts on the set
Wolf, talk to me, man
Did you get it
Got it, Nick
Everything
The Close-up
Perfect
See
That's what  meant about going hand-held
You're a genius, man
What about the focus
Nailed it
Fuckin'
Wolf slaps the 's palm, then the Gaffer's standing right beside him
He turns gleefully to the next person but seeing it is Wanda he rigidly turns away
Going again, Nick
How was the sound
could use another but definitely acceptable
Nick runs up to his mother and throws his arms around her
Nicole stands beside him
Mom, you kook
That was incredible
Did you know we were filming
(testily) Of course  knew you were filming
You were great, you're a natural
And Nicole, that was beautiful
Don't you dare tell me that felt fake
Suddenly, on an impulse surprising both of them, Nick and Nicole embrace
Just then Wanda steps up
Going again, Nick
Oh, hold on
Let me think a second
The set grows suddenly quiet as Nick begins pacing rapidly, muttering to himself
Can  use it for the Dream Sequence, that's the question
Does it work for the Dream Sequence
Nick suddenly looks up and sees everybody staring at him; Nicole in her wedding gown, Wolf with his eyepatch, his mother still eating the apple, Wanda, the crew
We're going with it, Wanda
Alright everyone, listen up
That is a wrap on Scene Six
The set erupts in applause
Hold it
Hold it
Hold it
What
need to record room tone
'll need thirty seconds of silence
Oh, alright
Quiet
Quiet
Shut up
Thirty seconds of room tone
The sooner you're quiet the sooner we're done
(whispers to Nick) What's room tone
It's for the sound, Mom
We just have to be quiet
At that moment a door opens at the rear of the set and a and  enter
The Nurse carries an extra overcoat
Jeff, the Driver, turns and sternly whispers for them to be quiet
And roll sound
Nobody move
Speed
The camera is wide, showing the entire set, actors, and crew
Everyone stands in perfect silence, as motionless as statues
As the silence continues the mood on the set gradually changes
One by one people drift into their own private worlds of reflection
the Sound man, alternately watching his recorder and his stopwatch
Behind him the Boom man holds the mike in position to record general ambiance while staring off into the distance
the tape recorder spinning in quiet precision
the stopwatch, its giant second hand showing five seconds have passed
Nick standing next to his mother who drapes one arm casually over Nick's shoulder
Nick glances up and sees Nicole beside him, absorbed in her own thoughts
Suddenly she looks up and her eyes meet Nick's
She slips him the barest hint of a smile
The camera  slowly through the standing, silent group, passing over faces in different degrees of thought
the Sound man's stopwatch, the giant second hand showing ten seconds have passed
Nick
He is so immersed in thought he looks at no one
The camera slowly  into a  of him
stands at a gleaming podium, looking radiant in an immaculate tuxedo
He holds an envelope in his hands
We have a new category this year: Best Film Ever Made by a Human Being
And the winner is none other than my Best Bud, Nick Reve
Amid thunderous applause Nick bounds on the stage and accepts an Oscar from Chad
He stands grinning like an idiot as the applause continues
Nick, still wrapped in thought, his lips starting to form the same idiotic smile
Nicole
The camera  slowly into her face, now tinged with a slight uneasiness
Wide shot at the counter
Nicole stands facing a large bald man with his back to the camera
She is wearing a cheap pink waitress uniform and has her hair under a hairnet
Had any experience
was an actress for a while
She pulls her headshot out of her shoulder bag and hands it to the man with a hopeful smile
He flips over the headshot and looks at her credits with confused annoyance
Yeah, but can you cook a hamburger
(doubtfully) Probably
Nicole
She jerks her head slightly in response to this moment of thought
the stopwatch, showing fifteen seconds have passed
Wolf
The camera begins a slow  into his
' Wolf stands like Thor in the middle of the Red Set, his arms crossed over his chest, his jaw set in determination
Smoke billows around him
At his feet, dressed in Nicole's wedding gown, Wanda sobs hysterically
Wolf, 'm sorry
Please forgive me
love you, Wolf
Please
Give me one more chance
Let me prove it love you
love you, Wolf
Wolf remains unmoved for a long moment
Finally he reaches out with a forgiving smile and pats Wanda's head
Wolf
He glances furtively at Wanda with a trace of hope still in his eyes
Wanda, looking off
The camera  into her
This is the same hotel room from Part Two, in which we saw Nicole and Chad Palomino
At the moment Wanda and Chad lie panting in the sweat-soaked sheets
What  love about you, Chad, is you're not afraid of my power
Oh God, Wanda
love your power
It's like an afferdesiac to me
Wanda
She shifts slightly and glances quickly around her
Her smile is tinged with the hint of sexual pleasure
the Gaffer, frowning, absorbed in thought
The camera into a  of him
Suddenly, a  of an incredibly beautiful hamburger being placed in a toasted bun on a gleaming white oval plate hand places a garnish of parsley on it then carries the plate to the lunch counter
Camera  to reveal the  sitting on the stool
He picks up the hamburger and takes a huge bite out of it
This shot holds for quite some time as he continues to chew
The Gaffer
hopeful, delicious smile spreading over his face
the Sound man's stopwatch, the giant second hand showing twenty seconds have passed
Cora
She gazes serenely out before her
In the pale afternoon light, Cora stands in the middle of her drab, barren room
She appears to be staring at the door
Suddenly she begins striding toward it
Effortlessly, easily, she walks right through it
Nick still stands at the podium with his Oscar
In closing 'd like to say to all the people who told me not to make this movie, who wouldn't meet with me or return a simple phone call
To my favorite professor at Film School whose parting advice to me was to take a job teaching at a women's college
To Delores DelSporto, the girl  loved in high school who left me for a Jr
Varsity football player: to all these people 'd like to say thank you but  can't because what really feel like saying is go fu -- Nick, his head and body jerking in a sudden spasm
He finishes the last word of his speech in a choked whisper and the Sound man frowns hard at him
the Sound man's stopwatch showing twenty-five seconds have passed
The camera stays on the watch until the final five seconds have elapsed
And, that's a cut on room tone
The room erupts with activity
Everyone moves and talks at once
Nick whispers something to Nicole then runs off
, strike the set
Props
Art Department
Redress for Scene thirty- one
Let's go
Right away people
Nick
Nick
Anyone seen Nick
the set
Suddenly the fake door closes right into the lens, turning the frame completely
