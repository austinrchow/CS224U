White gloved hands, in livery, rush to envelope the surfacing naked wet body in white towels

the Royal Coat Of Arms stamped in gold: lion and unicorn embrace a shield divided into four quarters with harp, thistle, and more lions denoting England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales
The shield is surmounted by a crown
This emblem is on a cuff-link fastened on a starched white shirt
Trousers, pressed to a knife-edge, are held for stockinged feet and gartered legs to be inserted
Mirror-polished boots are laced tight
Jacket, held ready
Arms, shoulders, chest received
Glistening medals attached to front of jacket create a dazzling field of ribbons and medallions
Epaulets, edged with gold braid tassels, are adjusted
Polished buttons are fastened
Multi-coloured collar clasped shut
White ostrich feathers, topping a tri-corner hat, are fluffed and placed upon brilliantined hair
to the handsome features of Albert, Duke of York, known to his family as
He's in his late thirties, the second son of King George , the reigning King of England
He conveys a sensitivity which appears in conflict with the manner in which he's been bedecked
Reflected in a full length mirror, Bertie tells himself: /Seidler/09/17/08                                    3
You look like a Christmas tree
He smiles wanly

Liveried footmen open the doors of a stately Austin Princess
Bertie exits York House with his young wife -  - considered by all to be one of the loveliest women in the land, truly an English rose
Golden Labradors and Corgis appear from all directions, weaving between them, barking boisterously, creating a happy chaos
Elizabeth and Bertie glance upwards and wave
Two little girls,  and  , aged eight and four, wave back from their nursery window

Buck up, Bertie

'  - Speaker's Corner with its assortment of orators, prophets, protestors, and onlookers gathered around soapboxs, agreeing, disagreeing, shouting comments
Others carry placards, sing protest songs
miners' strike is the focus of the day
large, rather untidy workingman with a florid rosacea nose spots the passing Austin and stares at the occupants
- Bertie's face stares back
The first drops splatter against the glass
Elizabeth sighs
(') Never trust the wireless
Bertie's face is obliterated by the increasingly heavy downpour, which segues into a  sound

The man in the tuxedo is a
He expectorates discreetly into the bowl, wipes his mouth fastidiously, and signals to   who produces an atomizer
The Reader opens his mouth, squeezes the rubber bulb, and sprays his inner throat
Now, he's ready
He looks to the control room
The   begins a count-down: five

Bertie and Elizabeth takes their places in a row of gilded chairs with the other dignitaries
They are: - a barrel-chested man with Naval beard and uniform, accompanied by his wife
- an elegant but icy grande dame
- a tall, unctuous, churchman with a high, domed, balding head, and a perpetual expression of moral superiority
- a politician of sixty, as portly as Lang is lean
They are bantering rivals in ambition
- the Prime Minister of the day
Heavy-browed
His hair, as always, parted down the middle
- Chancellor of the Exchequer
Tall, thin, lugubrious, with the expression of a quizzical chicken hawk
technician places a huge imposing microphone suspended on springs next to the stadium equipment
It looks frightening, even to us
Bertie's shoulders brace as though expecting a blow
Elizabeth sees his terror
/Seidler/09/17/08                                  5
Why wasn't he told
Ten million people listening around the world, Mam
Possibly more
(as though Bertie didn't exist) His brother, and father, have been broadcasting since last year
The King, growing impatient, hisses: Get on with it
Show what you're made of
Bertie moves forward diffidently, without an ounce of confidence, knowing deep within he's doomed
His stomach knots, chest muscles contract, constricting his breath
Luh-luh-lords, la-la-ladies, gen-tell-men
It is a shock to realize this is a man with a profound stutter
man who cannot speak in public
Lang whispers to Churchill
When Lang whispers, everyone can hear
wouldn't miss His Highness' maiden voyage for all the world
And on such an important occasion
Lang really is a piece of work
For ease of reading, Bertie's stutter is not indicated from this point on in the script
No doubt you wish the Prince Of Wales was standing before you today
- a sea of dripping umbrellas
No response
This is going to be a torment for him, and his audience

-                              7 glowing dial on the face of a studio radio
Everyone listening intently
/Seidler/09/17/08                                  6
( ) (stuttering profoundly) Be that as it may
my brother David is attending to other duties in the furthest parts of this vast Empire
The radio falls silent
Eyes widen in concern

-                                      8 Bertie stands frozen, his mouth agape, jaw muscles locked
He knows he's considered by all, especially himself, unfit for public life
Elizabeth is devastated
Just needs more practice

-                                        9 - rain splatters on brass plaques denoting Dr This or Dr That, specialists in various maladies

, ' ,   -      10 Umbrella stand, coat rack, wooden waiting bench: that's all
The door is flung open and Elizabeth enters, drenched, her hat decorated with white silk roses, now limp
veil covers her features
She waits
Coughs
No response
Calls imperiously: Are you there
From behind a door: (
) In the lav
Princess Elizabeth is not used to this sort of thing
She's further appalled by the loud gurgling of a toilet being flushed, and startled by the entrance of -
He's in his forties, tall, with piercing eyes and charismatic features
His demeanor is friendly, but professional
The accent, although Australian, is not heavy, he is after all a speech therapist

What wound did ever heal but by degrees

Just wants to be bad
Sorry, no receptionist
He offers to shake hands
She doesn't take it, even though she's gloved
(with sang froid) 'd be more comfortable in your office
That's for clients
Where's Mister
He doesn't know 'm here
That's not a promising start
My husband's seen everyone
They were all useless
He's given up hope
bit premature
Because he hasn't seen you
Lionel doesn't disgree
(') You're very sure of yourself
'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured
Of course my husband wants to be cured
His position requires public speaking upon occasion
torment
fear the requirement may grow more frequent
He should change jobs
/Seidler/09/17/08                                     8
He can't
Indentured servitude
Something of that nature
Well, have your `hubby' pop by and give his personal history
'll make a frank appraisal
Doctor
Logue tries to object but she over-rides
(') do not have a "hubby"
We never talk about our private lives
Nor do we `pop'
You must come to us
Sorry, this is my game, played on my turf, by my rules
The lady lifts her veil
Perhaps you'll make an exception
He recognizes her instantly, and is clearly impressed, yet refuses to be intimidated
thought the appointment was for "Johnson"
name used during the Great War, when the Navy didn't wish the enemy to know His Royal Highness was aboard
'm considered the enemy
You will be, should you continue to be un- obliging
/Seidler/09/17/08                                  9
For my method to succeed there must be mutual trust, complete honesty, and total equality
That process takes place in my consultation room
No exceptions
In which case
(re-lowering her veil) should have kept my pledge
promised my husband 'd stop seeking "The Great Cure
" 've wasted your time
And mine
She exits, closing the door firmly behind her
Bloody hell,  buggered that
The sound of something solid meeting leather

-                11 foot kicks a ball
Lionel is returning home from work
He's a well-known fixture locally
Some lads are playing footie
One of them passes the ball to Lionel who, despite briefcase and rolled brolly, dribbles skillfully before passing the ball and entering a modest brownstone
12
'    -         12 As Lionel mounts the stairs he's set upon by three sturdy boys - , , and  - with handkerchiefs tied around the lower portions of their faces and armed with broomstick swords
Stand and deliver

Jack The Ripper
The boys scream with delight and a sword fight ensues - Lionel using his brolly

We're Swagmen, not Highwaymen, Dad

Oh
(then) Beware, jolly Swagmen, 'll skewer yer gizzards
Lionel wife -  - appears at the head of the stairs; a sweet-faced, down-to-earth woman
You'll all hang from the gallows if you don't come for tea
Boys,  think we'd best go up

'   -                             13 Logue, Myrtle, and the boys are finishing at the table
Had a visit from a lady today
Another spoiled silly
May we be excused
You must stay, bored stupid, listening to your parents' inane conversation
(grinning) Thanks, dad
And mum
And mum
They start to leave
Take your plates
The boys grabs their plates and exit
After a moment
(') No wonder about the silly
You're so good at what you do
/Seidler/09/17/08                                      11
At what  do
(then, deliberately being `theatrical') Twas a Lady with a capital
Oh, Lionel, that'd get us home in grand style wouldn't it
She came on behalf of her husband
Which is not the proper way
told her  was fully booked
Myrtle is clearly disappointed (') She was
too high and mighty
Know what mean
She does
There's an unspoken code between them
We wouldn't want that
Covers her letdown
(') Hard to feel sorry for that sort
Silence, then: Had a call
Wish me luck
Course, Lionel
Loads and loads

' , 145  -                 14 Elizabeth, fashionably attired for an evening-out, is curled on a bearskin rug reading "Peter Pan" to the girls
"Mr
and Mrs
Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late
The birds were flown

Elizabeth closes the book

The two little girls clap with joy
Oh, to fly away
Weren't they lucky
Within his family, Bertie's stutter is virtually absent
One would have to learn to fly properly of course
Now a Daddy story
Can  be a penguin instead
He drops to his knees and waddles
In his tux he looks like a penguin
The girls giggle, but are undeterred
The horsie story, please
Ah well
Called upon to perform, the stutter returns slightly
But the two girls listen raptly, ignoring their father's minor impediment, and it fades
(') Once upon a time there were two horsies white horse that went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park
And a black horse that went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park
They met in the middle of Hyde Park
The white horse said "neigh"
The black horse said, "neigh"
The white horse continued on, clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park
The black horse continued on, clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park
And that's the end of the story
Now off to bed
As the girls exit: silly story really
But Father tells it rather well
The girls have gone

() Now
From the auditorium: Now
Someone pushes through a gap
Its Lionel
"Now

(') "Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of York
" His elocution is crisp and flawless
His acting, however, is unconvincing
(') "And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
" (interrupts crisply) Thank you
Beautiful diction
but  don't hear the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King
Lionel struggles to maintain a semblance of dignity
What do you suggest
Continue to do whatever you do, and hope it gives you a great deal of satisfaction
Crushed, Lionel retreats behind the curtain
16
-                           16 Cold and austere mausoleum illuminated by floodlights
On the parade ground, Grenadier Guards in red coats and black bearskin busbies drill stiffly like toy soldiers
Viewing stands are beginning to fill
The King's voice is heard: (
) Stride boldly up to the bloody thing, stare it square in the eye, and talk to it as you would to any decent Englishman
17
' ,   -              17 The King's study resembles a naval captain's cabin
Both men are uniformed for a state occasion
Bertie regards the microphone as though it were an alien
/Seidler/09/17/08                                    15
d-d-don't thu-thu-think  c-c-can
In the presence of his father, Bertie's stuttering returns in full form, his breathing short and shallow, the muscles in spasms
Show who's in command
If you don't, this devilish device will change everything
Used to be, all a King had to do was look reasonable in uniform and not fall off his horse
Now we must creep cap in hand into people's homes that smell of boiled cabbage, and speak nicely to them
We're reduced to that lowest, basest of all creatures
we've become
actors
Don't give me a look of defeated pathos
This is a family crisis
Father, we're not a family, we're a firm
His father shoots Bertie a surprised look
Does the lad have a brain after all
We're the oldest, most successful, corporation in the world and sitting on thrones is our business
But any moment now we may be out of work
Your brother came to me the other day, livid a certain lady has been refused an invitation to my Silver Jubilee
pointed out she wasn't a lady and most definitely wasn't his wife
What did David say
She made him sublimely happy
said: that was probably because she was sleeping with him
" give you my word we've never had immoral relations
" "As my son, as Prince of Wales, as my heir, do you solemnly swear your friendship with this woman is an absolutely clean one
" " do", he said
"Look me in the eye,"  said
"On my honour" he said
Stared straight at his father
and lied
Oh my brother
/Seidler/09/17/08                                    16
When 'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months
Who'll pick up the pieces
David's friend, Oswald Mosley
His black-shirt British Union of Fascists are marching through London
Hitler terrorizing half of Europe, Stalin the other half
Who'll stand between us, the jackboots, and the proletarian abyss
You
red light attached to the mike begins a series of warning blinks
What're you going to say
The usual guff
The Archbishop writes it
My people love to hear me say it
Spoken fluently, of course
They're interrupted by the entrance of the  News Reader and Technicians
(') That's the chap who taught me how to use this contraption
You touch your chin with your thumb and the `thing' with the end of your little finger
Splendid fellow
Assisted by the Technicians, the News Reader sprays his throat
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is the , broadcasting direct from Buckingham Palace upon the occasion of the Royal Silver Jubilee
His Majesty: King George the Fifth
(to the mike) " can only say to you, my very very dear people, that the Queen and  thank you from the depths of our hearts for all the loyalty and - may  say so
- the love with which this day and always you have surrounded us
dedicate myself anew to your service for all the years that may still be given to me
" The News Reader, terribly moved, whispers to his Technicians: /Seidler/09/17/08                                       17
That's how a King speaks
(adds with splendid false modesty) showed  how to do it
18
-                                 18 The edge of the crowd is visible
One can sense a vast sea of humanity
When the glass doors of the upper balcony open the murmur becomes a
When the King steps out, it becomes tumultuous
19
,   -                   19 The King is joined by Queen Mary and the Archbishop of Canterbury, other Royals, and dignitaries
The noise is deafening
The King beckons impatiently for someone still inside to join them
It's Bertie, with Elizabeth
They didn't come to see us, Father
Pretend
Where's David
Bedding his American whore
Come, join the fun
(aside to Elizabeth) You'll have to do a lot more of this
'm sending him to the Midlands
With all the factory noise they won't hear a word he says
The King goes back to waving
Elizabeth is stunned at the prospect
The  of the crowd segues into the  of machinery
20
-                                  20 Huge industrial wheels whir in neutral
are lined up dutifully to hear the visiting Royal
Bertie's lips move, but with the noise he cannot be heard
Elizabeth watches in relief
Then a , trying to be helpful, signals
The machinery halts, the factory falls silent
/Seidler/09/17/08                                     18
At first the momentum of speaking without being heard carries Bertie forward
What's needed is cooperation
Hearing his own voice reverberate through the cavernous factory brings Bertie's stutter back in full form
(') buh-buh-between the cuh-cuh-classses
One of the workers sullenly pulls a chain, releasing a blast from a steam whistle that drowns Bertie out
21
-          21 fluttering
22
-                                    22 Elizabeth and Bertie in the back
Is this necessary
You know perfectly well
As they pass a corner news stand, the headline chalkboard reads: "
" (') Neglects to tell them what must be done, how its to be done, and who's to do it
David has `the touch'
They adore him
As the Austin halts for lights, people stare to see who's inside
Some point
(') 'll wager they're saying: There's the useless one who can't speak

'   -                                 23 Bertie and Elizabeth enter
She explains in a whisper: /Seidler/09/17/08                                   19
There's no receptionist
Elizabeth glances nervously at the lavatory door
(') (loudly) The Johnsons
From the inner office
(
) Not finished yet
Elizabeth is relieved its not coming from the lav
How'd you find this physician
(poker-faced) Classifieds; next to "Saucy model, Shepherd's Market"
Bertie smiles despite his mood
(') Comes highly recommended
Charges substantial fees in order to help the poor
(realizes) Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik
'm not sure  want to see this fellow
'm not sure he wants to see you
The consultation room door opens and a working class young woman -  - comes out; then realizes with a gasp who they are
She retreats rapidly back into the consulting room
(') Perhaps this was a mistake
After an uncomfortable moment, Anna returns, attempting to be properly formal, and stutters: You can go in now, "Mr
Johnson"
'm not actually Mr
/Seidler/09/17/08                                   20

(then to Elizabeth) Dr Logue says
(
) Lionel
Lionel says
wait here if you wish
Or, it being a pleasant day, take a stroll
(to the consultation room) Was that alright
(
) Bloody marvellous
(choking up) Thank you
Lionel
Anna flees quickly
(
) Mr
Johnson, do come in

Well-worn Turkish rug
Hotplate and two chipped mugs
Model airplanes hanging from the ceiling

Here, in a doctor's office, Bertie's stutter returns
Glad we have something in common

What
You're too close
Five paces is the rule of thumb
That might be difficult in this office
Bertie perches uneasily on the edge of an armchair
(') Nice girl, Anna
Worried she wouldn't find a husband if she couldn't speak
Tried to convince her men will find her even more attractive as a silent partner
The perfect woman
Sorry, bad Australian joke
Why'd your wife change her mind and ask for an appointment
can't discuss that
What can we talk about
That's better
When speaking with a Royal one waits for the Royal to start the conversation and chose the topic
Your joking
That won't work here
admit if one waits for me to start a conversation one can wait a rather long time
Silence
They stare at each other
(') You call this making me comfortable
You call this being forthcoming
Aren't you interested in treating me
/Seidler/09/17/08                                   22
Only if you're interested in being cured
More silence
(') Cuppa tea
No thank you
need one
Turns on the hot plate
(') Any idea what you're letting yourself in for
Apparently a great deal of rudeness, Doctor Logue
Call me Lionel
prefer Doctor
prefer Lionel
My family calls me far worse
What shall  call you
The Duke of York is appropriate
Oh please
Your Royal Highness then
Much more informal
Prince Albert
Or Frederick
Arthur
George
've lots of names to choose from
How about Bertie
/Seidler/09/17/08                                   23
(flushes) Only my family uses that
That's what 'll call you then
We must be true equals
If we were equal  wouldn't be here, 'd be at home with my family and no-one would give a damn
Bertie starts to light a cigarette from a silver case
Don't do that
Bertie gives him an astonished look
(') Sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you
My physicians say it's good for stuttering, relaxes the throat
They're idiots
They've all been knighted
Makes it official then
House rules: no smoking
thought here we're "equal"
As a monarchist  thought you'd appreciate these are my digs and here  rule
No smoking
What was your earliest memory
beg your pardon
First recollection of the world
/Seidler/09/17/08                                     24
(stutter growing in intensity) 'm not here to discuss personal matters
Why're you here then
(exploding) Because  bloody well stutter
And you bloody well can't fix it
Temper
One of my numerous faults
Do you stutter when you think
Don't be ridiculous
One of my many faults
How about when you talk to yourself
don't talk to myself
Come on, everyone natters to themselves once in a while, Bertie
Stop calling me that
Shan't call you anything else
Then we shan't speak
Silence
The jug has boiled
Lionel makes himself a cup of tea
(') Must  pay for this
Loads
Now: when you talk to yourself, do you stutter
/Seidler/09/17/08                                   25
Of course not
Proving your impediment isn't a permanent internal fixture
When  give a speech
bloody stutter
Bet you a bob you can read flawlessly, right here, right now
(bitterly) Easy money
You're on
See your shilling then
Royals don't carry money
How convenient
Logue fishes a coin from his pocket and puts it on the table
(') 'll stake you
Pay me back next time
If there is a next time
Correct,  haven't agreed to take you on
During this, Logue has uncovered a piece of apparatus, a recording device with earphones
He sets a blank disc onto the turntable and positions a microphone, then hands Bertie an open book
Bertie glares at it defiantly
certainly can't read The Bard
`Easy money'
Bertie reads, stuttering badly and getting worse
"To be or not to be, That is the question
Whether it is wiser
" There
/Seidler/09/17/08                                     26
Reaches for the coin
Not so fast
proved  can't read
You proved you can't listen
Hands Bertie a pair of heavily padded earphones
Bertie doesn't want to take them

Bertie reluctantly puts on the earphones

Hear you're taking elocution lessons, lad
Pardon
Diction
Speechifying
That's the word around Town
Merely trying to overcome my dreadful impediment
(-) 'm the brother who speaks
Or do you wish to have a go
Good lord no

Replace me
Well
today's your chance
He thrusts a document into Bertie's hands, then pokes his head into the conference room
(') My brother will read the Coronation Plans
(whispers urgently) 'm not prepared
(whispers back) As a Boy Scout
and you are one, aren't you, very much a Boy Scout
you must always be prepared
Nice and loud, so everyone can hear
Bertie looks at the pages, his throat constricts, his chest tightens and his hands begin to shake
thu-thu-think we should tuh-tuh- table the document
He attempts to return it to David, but his brother won't accept
/Seidler/09/17/08                                      54

Now 'll be off
See you at Balmoral this weekend, Buh-buh-Bertie
In the room, they are appalled
Bertie stands frozen and shattered

Pulling his homburg over his brow, Bertie wraps his scarf around the lower portion of his face
Then catches his reflection in the rearview mirror
Tells his driver: Wait down the road

-                     50 Not wanting to draw attention to his destination, Bertie has disembarked several buildings away from Logue's address
He makes his way hurriedly
soccer football hits him on the back
He wheels around
The group of local lads look at him unabashed
Kick it `ere, aye, Guv
Bertie kicks it
fine high shot
(') Nice one
They go back to their game
Bertie rings Logue's bell
brief pause
Bertie glances nervously, hoping not to be recognized
Lionel opens the door
To be honest, wasn't sure whether to expect you
wasn't sure either
/Seidler/09/17/08                                   55

With a toothache
They disappear inside

You seldom stutter with me anymore
(referring to the mess) The boys are a bit untidy
Because you're paid to listen
Like a verbal geisha girl
52
, '  -                52 Bertie looks around the cluttered, but pleasant room: comfortable furniture a bit battered by the boys, antimacassars to hide the wear spots on the arms, family photos everywhere, well-used Turkish rug on the floor
Home
What more does a man need,eh
Lionel stares, unsure if he's being patronized
Coming from a man who's lived all his life in castles and palaces

You could've refused
Don't you know any rude words
What a bloody stupid question
just said one
Bloody
Bloodybloodybloody
Perhaps a touch more vulgar
Certainly not
To prove you know how
Bugger
public school prig could do better
Well bloody bugger to you, you beastly bastard
Hardly robust
Shit then
Shit, shit, shit
See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue
You don't stutter when you swear
/Seidler/09/17/08                                 57
Because 'm angry
Get angry more often
Do you know the f- word
Fornication
Oh Bertie
Fuck
Fuck, fuck, fuck
Bravissimo
Now a resounding chorus of
Bloody, bloody
bloody
Shit, shit, shit
Bugger, bugger, bugger
Fuck, fuck, fuck
pounding on the wall
(
) We have children
(whispers) This is your fault
Sorry, pet
Won't happen again
(
) should hope not
Apologies, Mrs
Logue
First time 've heard you laugh
Royals aren't allowed emotions in public
Which explains a lot
Bertie is in no mood to be provoked
/Seidler/09/17/08                                    58
What do you want me to do, dammit
Stage my next public appearance as an obscene operetta
Your next public appearance should be very well rehearsed
Without thinking, Lionel instinctively reaches out to pat Bertie supportively on the shoulder
Bertie pulls back in offended shock
All the warning signals instilled in him are going off
Don't take liberties
You're a dangerous man, Logue
Who sent you
Anyone in mind
The lurking shadows
Courtiers and peers
the whole panoply of a class which once ruled the nation which once ruled the world, afraid of losing their last vestige of privilege if the monarchy is further debased
Your wife was the one who sought me out
Because, dear sweet deluded woman, she believes in me
But you don't share her belief
Why come here
'm beginning to ask myself that very same question
Your sailing close to the edge, don't push me, Doctor Logue
Lionel
came here because  was taught from childhood to serve a purpose, and that purpose is to serve
Duty is our sole justification for privilege
() /Seidler/09/17/08                                   59
(') came here because  was under the illusion you might help me perform that function
Not to worry
They say the King can do no wrong
He can bugger things up
And  am not the King
Mrs
Simpson is seeking a divorce
The Coronation is set for the 12th of May
Her decree becomes final on the 27th of April
That gives them two weeks to marry and put this issue to rest
And if Mr Baldwin stops them
That would be a tragedy
pray to The Almighty they succeed
'll do anything within my power to keep my brother on the throne
Does that include debasing yourself
If necessary
Your brother knew perfectly well by giving you a document without warning
Are you saying he wanted me to fail
Are you insisting he didn't
In the future we can parse any document into manageable phrases
You can sing them, swear them, rehearse them til you get the rhythm and flow; that, combined with your growing confidence
Bertie doesn't want to hear
Growing confidence
Growing dread
You're a wicked man, Lionel Logue, trying to get me to thrust myself forward as an alternative to my brother
Trying to get me to commit treason
/Seidler/09/17/08                                    60
Trying to get you to   realize you need not be governed by fear
Again, why did you seek me out
To take   polite elocution lessons so you could   attend posh tea parties
How dare you
'm the brother of a King
the son of a King
back through untold centuries
You presume to instruct me on my duty
jumped-up jackeroo from the outback
The disappointing son of an embittered clerk
You're a monster, Doctor Logue
'm going to Balmoral to spend a pleasant country weekend with my beloved brother
And these sessions are over

-               54 Closed curtains
Someone fumbles behind it
( ) Now
Lionel pushes his way through the gap in the curtain replies from a seat in the auditorium

"The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half-light
" The door opens and Bertie enters the waiting area
Hearing Anna he stops outside the consultation room and listens

(') " would spread the cloths under your feet, But , being poor, have only my dreams
have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams
" Silence
(softly) Read it to him
If he doesn't profess his love, he's not a man
Anna nods earnestly
Thank you
Lionel
She exits via the Waiting Room and almost runs into Bertie
On recognizing him, she bobs her head
That was lovely
Don't take any guff
Can  tell my Harold that's what you said
'd be honoured
She dashes off
Logue comes to the door of the Waiting Room, in effect blocking Bertie's way in
Johnson, isn't it
Have you an appointment
Want me to beg
told you, Kings don't beg
believe this time a bit of begging might be required
Elizabeth says  must eat humble crow
Its "crow" or "humble pie"
Take your pick

(gathering resolve) was frightened and took refuge in being `Royal'
What  said was unforgivable
And
And
(blurts out) What's the one essential thing a King must do
He must believe he is King
How can possibly do that
For pity sake, Lionel, beg you: get me through
'll pay you another shilling
What're friends for
Logue steps aside, letting Bertie in

-                                   74 The double bed is piled high with clothing, a suitcase at its foot
Myrtle is sorting
She hears Lionel enter behind her
At first, she doesn't turn
Lionel remains silent
've got the boys sorting their things
Your office will be a chore
Realizing something is amiss, she turns, and knows instantly what Lionel's going to tell her
Her hand goes to her mouth to stifle her emotions
75
'  -                                    75 Bertie is with visitors: Churchill and Lang
There's a slight but discernible change in his demeanor
We asked to see Your Highness because there's the urgent question of what to call your brother
Aside from the obvious
Bertie is not pleased with His Grace's joke, but lets it pass
/Seidler/09/17/08                                   81
What do you suggest
Mr
Edward Windsor
All he deserves
What has my brother given up on his abdication, other than the throne
They look at each other, unsure
(') Wouldn't it be a good idea to find out before coming to me
He cannot be Mister, as he was born the son of a Duke
Which makes him a Lord at the very least
Very well, Lord
it is
And as a Lord of the realm, he's entitled to be elected to the House of Commons
Heading a King's Party
Unacceptable
So you prefer he takes a seat in the House of Lords
Again, on behalf of a King's Party
Is that acceptable
Certainly not
But if he's made a Royal Duke, and called His Royal Highness, he cannot stand for Parliament
Nor may he speak or vote in the House of Lords
(realizing) Oh  say
The Duke of Windsor it is
Gentlemen
He exits abruptly
Churchill and Lang gather their things stunned
/Seidler/09/17/08                                    82

The Owner keeps glancing worriedly in Myrtle's direction
The two men nod, shake hands
The fellow in the trench-coat leaves
The owner beckons another shop-girl over and whispers something to her
She heads towards Myrtle

: Splendid
Here's another
"She sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thick sieves
" At home, twenty-five times, in rapid succession
Those are my hardest sounds
Lionel gives him a look
(') Oh
Shall we invite your wife in now
/Seidler/09/17/08                                     83
Logue goes to the door and starts to open it
He shuts it quickly
(') wasn't expecting Myrtle for several hours
: Myrtle has entered, definitely unhappy
Seeing Elizabeth, she's even less happy, and flabbergasted
Milady
"Your Majesty", the first time
After that, "Ma'am"
Not Malm as in Palm, Mam as in ham
'm informed your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls your husband Lionel
trust, however, you won't attempt to call me Liz
: Lionel stands listening, ear to the door
How're they getting on
As to be expected
: Myrtle announces: You may call me "Madam Logue"
Myrtle's at a loss knowing what to do with a Duchess
(') May  offer you a cup of tea, Ma'am
Thank you, Madame Logue, but 'm waiting to be summoned
Silence
You don't like my husband
That's what was told
was told the same
: /Seidler/09/17/08                                   84
Do we remain in hiding
'm not going out there
: What do you dislike about my Lionel
don't wish my husband to be demeaned
What don't you like about mine
don't want my Lionel getting hurt
There's only one thing can save him now: success
: the men are growing increasingly nervous
We're being cowards
Of course
We're sensible men
You should go in
Me
You
Why me
You're the Royal
Being a monarchist,  recognize these are your digs
Therefore: here you rule
Therefore: you go in
Urged by Bertie, Logue opens the door
: Logue enters, pretending total innocence and surprise, followed by Bertie, also trying to keep the pretense
/Seidler/09/17/08                                    85
Oh
Hello, Lady Elizabeth
Oh
Hello, Myrtle darling
What a pleasant surprise
Myrtle stares at him and takes her revenge
Will the Yorks be staying for dinner
Logue and Bertie look panic-stricken
Elizabeth comes to the rescue
previous engagement
Some other time, love
Logue ushers Elizabeth into the study, giving Myrtle a nervous little wave
She glares and exits
: (') Glad you had a chance to meet Myrtle
Bertie stifles a snort
Elizabeth glares at him
(') (to Elizabeth) Good of you to come
Harley Street is far too public
What is my function here
For me to show you how to pitch in
Oh dear,  may not be a `pitch in' type
Piece of cake
(to Bertie) Please assume a supine position on the floor
What
Firm support is needed
/Seidler/09/17/08                                      86
Bertie dutifully lies on the floor
(') Breathe deeply
expand your chest
now your stomach
deep into the diaphragm
Splendid
How do you feel
Full of hot air
Well on your way to becoming a qualified political speaker
Again
Bertie inhales deeply
(') and hold
Now, Princess Elizabeth, be so kind as to sit on your husband's stomach
Good grief
Gently of course
Elizabeth sits gingerly on Bertie's stomach, asking solicitously: Are you alright, Bertie
Bertie nods
Now exhale slowly
down goes Princess Elizabeth
inhale slowly
nothing rushed, expanding your chest fully, extending the column of air til it hits the diaphragm
and
up comes Princess Elizabeth
Exhale
down goes Princess Elizabeth
inhale
up comes Princess Elizabeth
You get the idea
Doesn't have to be Princess Elizabeth of course, but thought you'd prefer your wife to one of the staff
Now comes the fun part
There's actually more
Bertie springs to his feet while Logue opens a window
/Seidler/09/17/08                                     87
You will now shout the vowel sounds, all five of them, as loudly as possible, each to last no less than 15 seconds
There's poor coordination between your larynx and diaphragm
Princess Elizabeth, you can be the official timer
Vowel sounds
Shouted at an open window
On a public street
Anyone who can stand at an open window vibrating loudly in full view of the world can learn to give a public speech
They can also be considered quite dotty
Don't even contemplate it
Sorry, dear, doctor's orders
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
(stops) She's right, those two chaps are staring at me
They're always looking at you
(startled) You're followed
Royal scrutiny, Doctor, best get used to it
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
(to Elizabeth) Are you timing this
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
ooooooooooooooooooooooooo

May we be excused
No
The unhappy meal continues
(mumbles) We don't want to hear you fight
We're not fighting
Your mother isn't talking
You wish me to speak my mind
Boys, leave
Thank you, Dad
Thank you, Mum
They exit hurriedly
Lionel
without warning,  arrive home to find the Queen in my parlour
Duchess, she hasn't been crowned yet
Lionel, don't quibble
What'd you think of her
Does it matter
She's the Queen and he's the King forgodsake
What're they doing here
Why'd you come home so early
Lionel
They came for help
/Seidler/09/17/08                                      89
What role are you auditioning for now
Royal saviour
Who's going to help us
This will bring us down, Lionel
You know it will
When that poor chap first walked into my office, he was a slim, quiet man with tired eyes and all the outward symptoms of the person upon whom a habitual speech defect has set the sign
You saw him today; once more there was hope
You're not listening to me
She gets up angrily and starts carrying dishes to the kitchen
He follows her back and forth
Myrtle,  love you
You say that, but you don't listen when say, in so many ways, how desperately want to go home, how  never, ever, intended to stay here
This was to be a holiday trip to see `Mother England', and you turned it into quite something else
What happened, Lionel
We went to Wembley Stadium, next thing
you'd cashed in our tickets
He's silent
(') Very well,  shan't talk of this ever again
will, as always, be supportive of your endeavours
Myrtle
don't deserve a wonderful woman like you
How right you are
But why'd you come home so early
Lionel
was let go
/Seidler/09/17/08                                   90
He's stunned
(') Inquiries were made
Mr Falkoff wouldn't say who
afterwards it was: `With your hubby treating a personage that high and mighty, you won't be needing employment with us, will you, Mrs Logue
' (anguished) Why
They're frightened, Lionel
Of what seems so far above them
sympathize
'm frightened too
Oh, Myrtle
My love

The center piece of this particular section is the throne of Edward the Confessor
Scaffolding is in the process of being erected to supply lighting for the Coronation
Archbishop Lang and Churchill inspect it with satisfaction
Only the vulgar ones
Churchill pours two nips of whiskey into metal cups nested in a hip flask
(') To our new King
Let's sincerely hope
They look at each other in silence
Is this a `slightly pregnant pause'
/Seidler/09/17/08                                   91
They say he is dim
Demonstrably untrue
They say he has epilepsy
Patently erroneous
Fragile, prone to illness
Some correctness in that
and will die prematurely
They predict he'll be unable to complete the Coronation
What do you propose
Shorten the ceremony
Or no ceremony at all
My idea exactly
believed so
But what we need is a pageant of pomp and pomposity to impress the world
What we need, and what we'll get, may be two rather different things
Did you hear his pathetic attempt at the Accession Council
He'll never be able to speak in public
So, we plonk a tinsel crown on his head and lock him in a closet
Who then will spiritually lead this great nation into war
Who will address the far flung corners of the Empire, rallying all to our defense
Well
The Head of our Church
Is that what you have in mind
/Seidler/09/17/08                                   92
Would it be such a calamity
Best ask our new King
Bertie has entered with Logue
Lang spins around
Your Majesty
Excuse me, sir, duty calls
He exits quickly
Cosmo continues nervously as they walk through the Abbey, the Archbishop pointing out the preparations in progress, particularly a booth for broadcasters
Is this the scene of the crime
What a peculiar thing to say
Referring to my assault upon the ears of the listeners
Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's Box
have, however, categorically said no to the 's new "radio-with-pictures" gadget
Imagine, the unwashed viewing us as we blow our noses or scratch our bottoms
Radio with pictures
It is called
"television"
Happily, with a transmission range of only fifteen miles this "" thing has no future
We shall, however, be forced to permit cinema; the product of which  shall personally edit
That'll keep you busy, removing all my stops and starts
Unless of course you'd prefer a quiet ceremony
/Seidler/09/17/08                                   93
What exactly do you mean
Something
discreet
private
We could pre-record an edited version to be broadcast to the world
Or even find an actor with a similar voice
Logue has arrived and comes out of the shadows
King based upon deception
Cosmo takes Bertie aside
If your gentleman from Security would give us space, we could discuss this in private
You mean my bodyguard,"Crusher
" Giving Lionel a scathing look, Lang continues speaking to Bertie confidentially
Fret not
As  assured our nation in my recent broadcast: "When his people listen to their new Monarch they will note an occasional momentary hesitation in his speech
But to those who hear it, it need cause no sort of embarrassment, for it causes none to him who speaks
" You see, 've paved the way
But should you wish to avoid further stress
Why not paint him pink and cover him with sequins
Pardon
If you wish to call attention to his anxiety
Does your bodyguard know to whom he's speaking
He certainly doesn't know his place
/Seidler/09/17/08                                   94
Doctor Lionel Logue, my speech therapist
Therapist
'd no idea
Had  known Your Majesty was seeking assistance  would've made my own recommendation
Dr
Logue is to be present at the Coronation
Impossibly to find room
Even for a Doctor
Just Lionel
Behind the chair of Edward the Confessor
The Royal Box
Your Family will be seated there
Which makes it most suitable
Perhaps  might be able to add a very small stool
Two comfortable chairs
One for Madam Logue
She's a close friend of my wife
The Queen
'll have someone attend to it
And now, if you don't mind, we need the premises
My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey
The Church must make preparations
So must Bertie
Bertie
We do not call the King: "Bertie"

During waking hours we'll need the facilities
It'll be a closed set
No observers
Those are my wishes, Your Grace
Lang nods curtly and exits
(') You've made a dangerous enemy
Wouldn't want him as a friend
And don't ever call me Bertie in public
moment of confrontation
Lionel knows he's overstepped
Tell me
sense one of your dreadful questions on the horizon
Do you really want to be King
Knew it
haven't any choice
You can be a wounded King who stumbles through his Coronation
Or, as the Arch of so archly suggests, no Coronation at all
Always a choice
What's this, you wait til Westminster Abbey, then ambush me
'm simply asking questions
which you seem unable to answer
'm a sacrificial lamb being led to slaughter
Damn you
/Seidler/09/17/08                                     96
Quite possibly
But at least  know what want
You haven't the foggiest
(explodes) His words reverberate through the empty abbey
That's quite different
Let's get down to work then, shall we
Bertie glares at him
(') As soon as you and Elizabeth enter the West door, you'll be greeted with the hymn " Was Glad When They Said Unto Me
" You won't actually be that glad, because they sing it for a great long time
Bertie follows Logue deep into the bowels of the `Abbey'
(') You'll then show yourself to the various sides of the Abbey as the Archbishop announces four times in a loud voice, "Sirs,  here present unto you
" Have you decided your name for when you become King
For when you become a different person
George
Like your father
Like my father
Not Albert
Given the current situation
too Germanic
"Sirs,  here present unto you, , your undoubted King
" /Seidler/09/17/08                                   97

-                           84 The last of the preparation crew are being scurried out by Lang
He gives a final, satisfied, look at the cavernous space, like a director preparing the stage for a final scene
He quotes Shakespeare, extremely pleased with himself: "The play's the thing, wherein 'll catch the conscience of a King
" He exits
explores various elements: The Throne of Edward the Confessor
Beneath it, a large rough-hewn stone: The Stone Of Scone
Leaning against the Throne, a huge sword, set there for the next Coronation rehearsal
Majestic stained glass windows of saints, kings, and martyrs
Rows of pews, worn with centuries of use
Graves of the mighty: kings, poets, and statesmen
This Abbey holds the history of a nation
Footsteps resonate
Lionel enters
Trips over one of the gravestones
Bertie
Blast
Stepped on Lord Byron

Lights snap on skewering Lionel
Bertie steps into view wearing a coat against the night chill of the stone cathedral
This is not a rehearsal, "Doctor" Logue

Ah, the Star Chamber inquisition wondered when that would happen
And 'd promised Myrtle a new frock
(barely controlled) "Just call me Lionel"
Never did you call yourself `Doctor'
We did that for you
No diploma, no training, no credentials
Just a great deal of nerve
Want to hear my side of the story
There isn't a "your-side-of-the-story"
This is my story
And you've ruined it
Its not just the Coronation, terrifying enough, its the radio speech to millions afterwards, and the speech after that, and for the rest of my failed miserable life

You dare remind me
was there
Then you knew from the start  was hopeless
My son, Valentine, asked, "Could you help that poor man

" Lying bastard
knew  could help you

failed actor
Actor
Father wanted me to be a doctor, but couldn't cut flesh
So  worked in the mines, recited in pubs
An actor
When the war came, by the time  was ready to be shipped out, the first casualties were limping home
Poor buggers, broken in bone and spirit
`Lionel, you're good with your mouth, see if you can help these poor sods
' The shell-shocked were the saddest
Most stuttered profoundly
Far worse than you
Muscle therapy helped somewhat, but found  had to go deeper, as you might well imagine
know nothing of those poor men
think you do
They had cried out, and the universe had not listened
So they'd lost faith in their voice
My job was to make them shout in righteous anger: " have the right to be heard
" suppose that helped them, did it
Make inquiries
Inquiries have been made
No credentials
But a lot of success
No training was given

simply knew what to do

" pretended it was our trip home to Mother England, the Great Australian Pilgrimage
To Harley Street

had three months rent
So you set yourself up on Harley Street as an actor
Harley Street, don't you know, is for doctors

My acting, however, did not
Well enough to deceive me
Lock me in the Tower

What crime
You've saddled this nation in its moment of peril with a voiceless King
Destroyed the happiness of my family
all for the sake of ensnaring a star client you knew you couldn't possibly assist

George

You can't sit there
Why not
It's a chair
It's the Chair of Edward The Confessor
The throne upon which every King for six and a half centuries has been crowned
It's falling apart
People have carved their initials into it
Needs a stone to keep from blowing away
That's the Stone of Scone
The Stone of Destiny that was once Jacob's pillow
You believe such ballocks  don't care how many royal backsides have sat on it, it's a building block with handles attached
You're just like me, an actor with tawdry stage props you choose to believe are real
Listen to me
Listen to you
By what right
Divine right, if you must
'm your King
Noooo you're not
Told me so yourself
Said you didn't want it
So why should  listen to a poor stuttering bloke who can't put one word after another
Why waste my time listening to you

Your Majesty
The Archbishop of Canterbury
You'll be relieved to learn 've found a replacement specialist
Impeccable credentials
There's a long silence
That won't be necessary
The matter's already been settled
For your own well-being
What did you say
Your Majesty's function is to consult
and to be advised
You didn't consult, but you've just been advised
Now  advise you, so listen carefully
in this personal matter  will make my own decision
May  remind you, you do not place the crown upon your own head
And may  remind you, it is my head upon which the crown is placed

Lang turns on his heel
Lionel ignores what has just happened
In hushed tones the  commentator paints a picture for the world, as you stand at the altar divested of your robes
Trumpets echo through the Abbey
The incessant rain clears miraculously as a shaft of sun streams through the stained-glass window catching your golden tunic and bathing you in light like a mediaeval knight
And you are King

) That's been edited

) More tears when our new Monarch started towards his throne, only to be brought to an abrupt halt owing to one of the Bishops treading on his robe

) To the world, all went splendidly
Amidst a vitrine of glittering jewels, bobbing tiaras, and heaving bosoms

The archive footage continues, but it is not of the Coronation
David and Wallis visiting the Fuhrer in Germany: Hitler gallantly kissing Mrs Simpson's hand while Goring and the Duke of Windsor beam; David giving the Nazi salute
The lights come on
For once, Churchill is speechless
(') There's no doubt: David is planning a comeback
And will succeed if our King continues to falter
Though Bertie miraculously survived the Coronation he continues to stumble very badly indeed
Soon he must broadcast to the world
Hitler will be listening
David will be listening
Stalin and Roosevelt will be listening
Everyone will be listening
God help us
(
) (stuttering very badly) "In this grave hour
" 86
'   -                      86 Bertie and Logue are rehearsing
"In this grave hour
" Sorry
Try again
"In this grave hour
" Turn the halts into pauses, during which you say to yourself, "God save the King"
say that all the time, but apparently no one's listening
Use the silence
Long pauses add solemnity to great occasions
Then 'm the solemnest king who ever lived
Lionel,  can't do this
/Seidler/09/17/08                                    106
Logue tries to protest, Bertie over-rides
(') If  am to be King
where is my power
May form a Government on my own, appoint or dismiss a Prime Minister, chose an Ambassador, levy a tax or declare a war
None of these things
Yet  am the seat of all authority
Why
Because the Nation believes when  speak,  speak for them
Yet  cannot speak
Logue totally ignores the outburst
Take it from the top
"In this grave hour
" (hesitates, then) "In this grave hour, p-p-perhaps
" Go on
The letter`' is always difficult
Get a running start, put the words all together

spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you
as if  were able
" In your head, now: "Bugger, bugger, bugger
Damn, damn, damn
All those bloody blighters are going to have to listen to me
" Can you dance
What
Helps relax the body
(goes to record player) Waltz

Thought you might
(starts a bagpipe record of "Scotland The Brave") Dance with me

in the lives of most of us

Dancing at arm's length with Logue, Bertie repeats: "For the second time
in the lives of most of us
we are at war
" One-two- three
(continues on) "Over and over again
we have tried to find a peaceful way
out of the differences
between ourselves
and those who are now our enemies

Fuck, fuck, fuck
You'll be ready

still have it
Of course
/Seidler/09/17/08                                   108
Bertie holds out his hand, demandingly
Somewhat hurt, Lionel hands it over
'll return it
Bertie leaves with the shilling, exiting the back way
Logue opens the waiting room door
Willie
Where's your mum
(stuttering painfully) She had to work
You've been waiting here, alone, all this time
Willie nods again
Then, haltingly: heard the King
Did you
He sang
And shouted rude words
He did
Willie beams
(') Would you like to sing, dance, and shout rude words
( ) would
Why am  not surprised
87
' ,   -            87 The dreaded  microphone
The room has been transformed into an ad hoc broadcasting studio for this all-important occasion
/Seidler/09/17/08                                    109
The  News Reader and Floor Manager are there, along with a small cluster of technicians putting finishing touches to their equipment
Think he'll manage
've heard he may not even show
The Floor Manager tries to warn him with his eyes
Bertie has entered with Elizabeth and Logue
The Reader wishes he could sink into the floor
Bertie says nothing, but approaches the looming microphone, while Logue and Elizabeth watch nervously
`Walk up to the bloody thing boldly, stare it square in the eye, man to man
' (placating) If you'll be so kind, to let me show you
already know
My father taught me
He spreads the fingers of one hand, touches the apparatus with the little finger, thumb to chin
The Reader scurries off and tells the others
His father taught him
taught his father
(testing the microphone) Bugger bugger bugger
bloody bloody bloody
Bertie, do make sure that's not switched on
You're going to be splendid
And if you're not
They'll bloody well have to listen to me anyway
Right
/Seidler/09/17/08                                    110
Bloody right
Lang and Churchill have entered
Elizabeth forces herself to greet them graciously
Mr
Prime Minister, Your Grace, how kind of you to join us
Wouldn't miss this for the world
(to Churchill) Congratulations
Neville didn't last long, did he
Talking to Hitler
My tenure will be shorter, if the King fails tonight
Bertie and Logue speak privately
No matter how this turns out,  wish to thank you
For asking such dreadful questions
What can  do in recompense
(lighty
yet seriously) 've always wanted to be knighted
Sorry
That would raise too many questions
(pause, then) Understood
Bertie takes something from his pocket
Your shilling
Told you 'd give it back
Keep it for good luck
No, you won this, fair and square
The object is a silver medal
Bertie pins it to Logue's jacket
/Seidler/09/17/08                                    111
(') Made from the melted coin
Designed it myself, hope you like it, Lionel old friend
May  call you that
My greatest honour, Bertie
(then) One final question
Oh dear
Do you believe you're King
very long pause
Almost
The red light on the microphone starts to blink
Logue joins the others
The Reader is at a smaller microphone near the ad hoc `broadcast booth
Five, four, three, two
Good evening, this is the  National and World programme, broadcasting from Buckingham Palace
His Majesty, the King
During this, Bertie's hands begin to shake, the pages of his speech rattle like dry leaves, his throat muscles constrict, the Adam's apple bulges, his lips tighten
all the old symptoms reappear
Several seconds have elapsed since the Reader finished
It seems an eternity
Elizabeth grasps the sides of her chair with white knuckles
Lang's eyes roll heavenward
Churchill studies the situation, ready to leap into the breach
Bertie and Logue stare at each other
Logue smiles, perfectly calm, totally confident in the man he's worked with
His confidence is contagious
Bertie takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly
His hands grow steady, his throat muscles relax
all the things he's practiced
/Seidler/09/17/08                                     112
88
'  -                                  88 The luminous dial of a wireless
Unbearable silence
Then: (
) In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history,  send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas
This is being listened to by Myrtle and the boys
The boys look at their mum
Suddenly they explode with cheers as the radio address continues: 89
/
89 -   , In homes, pubs (where we see the man with the rosacea nose), clubs, hotels, boarding houses, factories, mines, prisons, a shearing shed in New Zealand, cattle station in Australia, sites in India, South Africa, loci around the Commonwealth and Empire
China
Japan
The Kremlin
The White House
Hitler's mountain top wolf den
The South of France (where David and Wallis listen dolefully
) During this, the address continues, with dramatic pauses to be sure, but no real hesitations
(
) this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if  were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself
For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war
For we are called, with our allies, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world
It is the principle which permits a State, in the selfish pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the use of force, or threat of force, against the sovereignty and independence of other States
Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right, and if this principle were established throughout the world, the freedom of our own country and of the whole British Commonwealth of Nations would be in danger
() /Seidler/09/17/08                                     113
(
) (') But far more than this - the peoples of the world would be kept in the bondage of fear, and all hopes of settled peace and of the security of justice and liberty among nations would be ended
This is the ultimate issue which confronts us
End the montage with a return to the exterior of Buckingham Palace
Outside, stand solemn crowds, listening to the speech on loudspeakers
, the faces of England, stalwart and resolved
(') For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, and of the world's order and peace, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge
It is to this high purpose that  now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own
ask them to stand calm, firm, and united in this time of trial
The task will be hard
There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield
But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit our cause to God
90
-                         90 The two girls listen to their father on the radio
(
) If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, ready for whatever service or sacrifice it may demand, then, with God's help, we shall prevail
Lilibet's expression tells it all - she can hear it, her father is truly King
91
' / ,   -         91 Bertie, in his quiet way is totally in command, and utterly magnificent
Everyone in the room is awed as he concludes: /Seidler/09/17/08                                   114
(') We may all find a message of encouragement in the lines which, in my closing words, would like to say to you: ` said to the man who stood at the Gate of the Year, "Give me a light that  may tread safely into the unknown
" And he replied, "Go out into the darkness, and put your hand into the Hand of God
That shall be to you better than light, and safer than a known way
'" May the Almighty Hand guide and uphold us all
` '  - the Manager makes a `cut' gesture to Bertie, he's off the air, the red light on the microphone goes out
The Manager points, and the red light on the Reader's microphone goes on
This concludes the  broadcast of the King's Speech
Another `cut' gesture from the Floor Manager, the red light goes out and the transmission is concluded
The Floor Manager looks to the Reader
(') (softly) He wasn't perfect
(barely controlling his tears) Not perfect
But by God
He moved me
- Bertie waits for the verdict of his peers
Churchill first: Couldn't have said it better myself
The ultimate compliment
Lang next
'm speechless
(softly) Thank God
She goes to Bertie and kisses him tenderly on the cheek, takes his hand, then Logue's
/Seidler/09/17/08                                   115
(') Well done, Bertie
Well done
(for the first time) Lionel
Well done
She leaves the two men together
always called you Bertie
Today,  call you King
He offers his hand
But instead of taking it, Bertie takes him by the shoulders and gives him a hug
This is a long way from the five pace rule
The last barrier has fallen
