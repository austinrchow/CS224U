0in } - Gold light dappling across a valley that seems to reach on forever
We ease back, revealing more - taking in the visual feast - finally discovering a seated figure facing out over the valley - a  at his feet
, life ahead of him - someone seemingly at ease with himself
As we watch
him a moment -  become prominent - whistle of the wind through the grass - a bird's wings as it takes flight - a tree branch creaking under its own weight
And as he sits there, listening, we see the last rays of sunlight slip from the day
- and our  come up
Then out of the darkness come a pair of
- and we're: -   - An old  2002 making its way up the Taconic Parkway
- On the radio: Whitney Houston's "'ll Always Love You"
, 30's, driving, on the phone
'm lost Betsy, and you know me - don't wear lost well - wait, wait 'm losing you
(the cell phone glitches) 'm pulling over before you disappear forever
Amy pulls off the side of the road
Wrestles with a map and the phone
Sign
was looking for a sign
There's no
Her attention is caught by something off camera
She stares out into the night
-  small iced over pond - and in the middle - moving about is Virgil,   - hockey stick in hand - moving about the rink with an imaginary puck
(
) (distracted) Yes
took the first
no, no, 'm listening
Virgil winds up and takes a slap at the ice with his stick - throws his hands up in the air like he just scored
Amy smiles, peers off down the road
sign: 1
4 miles
Wait,  got it - yeah
No don't call me
right, unless you hear from Atlanta
And fax me the designs -  want to tinker with them a bit more 'm going to rest - bye - 'll see you in a week
Beep she hangs up
Looks back out to the pond
It's empty
Shrugs - about to pull out - that love song still blaring
Oh p-lease, Whitney
- she shuts off the radio - and pulls back out onto the road
- Amy pulling luggage out of her car
She takes a breath - clearly she's exhausted - and starts towards the entrance
-   - Amy at the front desk with the Night Manager , 30', annoyingly fit
we have a full weight room, lifecycles, stairmasters, a spa, yoga, aerobics, spin classes
'm really just looking for a quick fix, here
Do you have anything that just involves lying down
massage
Great
'll have one a day
Not too early
-    - Amy enters, wearing sweats, she checks her watch - looks toward a closed door - about to grab a magazine when she hears from behind the door: ' Virgil, Oh God
, right there
Yes
Amy's interest piques - the woman's murmur continuing - deep ecstasy
' Yes there - a bit more
(a small bell ) --wait - wait, you can't stop - one more minute - noo
' Sorry, Susan - time's up
've got someone waiting
And the door opens - and we see a woman, 60's, , Bette Midler type, backing out of the room
Virgil, you have to come live with me
' And what would your husband say
Amy, you out there
- c'mon in
That's it - 'm getting a divorce
Amy smiles as she passes Susan and enters
'   - Virgil has his back to us as he prepares the table
The room is very ordered - every vial, bottle, towel has its exact spot
Hey, Amy, 'm Virgil - why don't you get ready - hop up on the table
Amy sees Virgil - his head turned slightly away - she drops her sweats and lies on the table, face down - pulling the sheet to cover herself
Sounds like you're a genius at this
(laughs) That's right
Mozart, Einstein, Virgil Anderson, massage therapist
Now 'm going to start working somewhat deep - you let me know if you want anything deeper
Deeper is good - where  come from, all you get is shallow
like that - deep it is
- he hits a button on a  player and as we hear the soulful aria "Mira, 0 Norma" from Bellini's Norma
First time in Pinecrest
Came in late last night
missed the town completely
If you came in broad daylight, you could still miss the town completely
: Slow moving cuts of Virgil, working long strokes over Amy's body - - his hands gracefully  and  her muscles
Too much compute
work
Uh-huh
Bad chair - you should think about a change
(quiet) Absolutely
Virgil reaches his hands all the way down her spine and makes a move that causes Amy to release a very deep guttural sound
Too deep
No
just right
Amy is now lost in another world - as Virgil shifts - working gently - not caressing - but molding - like a sculptor
moment and Amy, surprisingly, begins to cry - softly
Virgil stops - takes a step back
- 'm sorry - it was too deep
She cries for another few beats - then takes a breath
No - it
It's not you
It's just things have kinda built up, don't know why 'm crying
look, this is embarrassing
Don't be embarrassed - you obviously needed it
We should stop for today
Yeah, thanks
You always make the girls cry
Not since grade school
'm going to go now - unless you'd like me to stay
Could you - just for a minute
Of course, whatever you need
Virgil sits next to her - then reaches out - takes her hand and starts a slow comforting massage - we see Amy visibly relax
You ever feel like a Martian's invaded your entire body
Every day
Amy, closes her eyes - smiling slightly in thanks
'   - pans slowly over to Amy asleep - and on the click of the door - her eyes dreamily open
Virgil
- Hallway outside the massage area
Amy exits the change room, now wearing her sweats - pulling on her sneakers
(
) (calling out) Hey Caroline, you look incredible today
(
) (laughing) Quite a compliment, Virgil
See ya tomorrow
(
) See ya
Amy looks down the hall - sees a glimpse of Virgil rounding the corner
She chases after hi~n into the reception area where she sees him exiting the door and moving of f down the driveway
Virgil - wait
He's gone
Hopping along, tugging on her last sandal - she decides to go after him - fighting her way through a large tour group just checking in
- Virgil in the distance, moving his way towards the main street
Amy exiting the building - trying not to slip on the ice as she, hurries after him - trying to get close enough to call out
Virgil stops at a main roadway as Amy comes up behind him
Virgil, hey
Virgil turns - sunglasses on - looks directly at Amy
Yes
It's Amy - Amy Tremont
Of course - you were sleeping, didn't want to wake you
Yes thanks - you're the skater, right - saw you last night, coming in
Pretty mean slapshot
You play on some team or something
Yeah, something
You a hockey fan
Always liked it - never get around to seeing a game
But  loved to skate as a kid - unfortunately  have two left feet
(playing with her) They look perfectly  with me
Amy laughs, starts relaxing - unconsciously starts to flirt
Head cocked, shifts her weight on one foot, moving slightly closer
love the view you get here
Same here -  never get used to it
Just then a    pulls up in front of him and the doors pop open revealing  , black, a hundred years old
Virgil turns as a few kids pile off the bus
Well, this is my ride
Hey Tommy, my man
And with his hand extended a kid high fives it
Amy looks up - a full of young school kids
Seems odd
Virge
As the kid moves off
Well,  just wanted to apologize for back there - blubbering like that -  was just in a weird place
And now
Now, 'm fine - so  wanted to thank- you
For what you did
For making you cry
No,  made me cry - and you handled it great - didn't freak or anything
(beat) Is my mascara smeared or something
(laughs) No
Why
You're just looking at me funny
Virgil - lets move it
As  said earlier -  just never get used to the view
Virgil starts towards the bus, reaching behind to his pack
Pulls something out
See you tomorrow
And , ,  - a   unfolds in his hand
And he taps his way to the bus
See you
oh my God
What
You're, you're -- 'm so sorry
(smile) Hey, you already apologized once - no need to overdo it
Bye now
Amy doesn't know how to respond
And he moves into the front seat of the bus - amongst "Hey Virgil's" from the school kids and Ca-chunk the doors close - the Yellow Bus steaming off - past Amy, as she stares at Virgil in the front seat - about to wave to him - then realizing he wouldn't see
As she turns and watches the bus move off down the street - a hand comes out - Virgil's - and waves good-bye
'
- The  stopping in front of Virgil's home - a side-by-side at the edge of surrounding woods
Virgil steps into the street and with a  the bus pulls away
He turns, grazes his hand across a tree out front - and starts towards his home
- he hesitates at the first door
Finds it with his hand - then raps on it
No answer
He moves over to his own door - and goes inside
'  - As he enters, Sophie, an aging , lays on the couch
Get of f the couch, Sophie
As the dog slides guiltily off the couch
Some seeing eye dog - more like sleeping eye dog
Virgil bends down as he passes the coffee table to pick up the placed just so
Click - a Game Show pops on
Met a girl today - nice voice - followed me out of the building
Sophie barks
No she wasn't a stalker
Virgil's hand flipping open a large book marked " " - it's completely  - all in
(
) Sophie's just worried about you - she watches too many horror movies
In the kitchen,  , older than Virgil, simply dressed, putting a just made dinner carefully onto a plate
Hey, you're here - so how are the kids today
Running his hand down the pure white page - he finds what he wants: - he hits the channel changer and the game comes on
The usual - need a lot of attention
So who's the girl
Moving into the kitchen, Virgil puts the remote to the side of the refrigerator where it  sticks to an exact spot
From the spa
made her cry
You haven't done that since-- / -- grade school
(smile) That's what  told her
Coke
Virgil moves past Jennie as she goes into the living room - hand up, door open and he's got a glass
Back to the fridge, he grabs a coke
'm fine
Your dinner's ready - chicken's at 3 o'clock - rice is at
6 o'clock, peas at 9 o'clock and news at 11
Jennie places Virgil's dinner down in an exact spot on a coffee table (facing away from the )
(laughs) One day 'm going to switch them on you
And one day 'll play forward for the New York Rangers
Four precise steps into the room and Virgil plops down on the sofa - finds his fork
Jennie moves to a counter where a pile of school books sit
Ha - ha
You need new jokes
Or a new sister
'd work on the jokes
Picking up the books she moves past Virgil - pecks him on the head and moves to the door
You want to watch some hockey
(at the door) You want to grade some spelling tests
(beat) 'll be next door you need me
She leaves and Virgil pats the couch and Sophie hops up next to him
You know this girl - for one moment - she actually thought  could (Sophie grumbles as she settles in) 'm not kidding
(beat) And she had this great voice - relaxing - soft like a breeze through (beat) Wonder what she thinks about "blind dates
" '  - Amy in bed - just out of the shower - the only light in the room comes from the
She has the remote, mindlessly switching channels - not staying on one for more than a second or two
Click - an Odd Couple rerun - click -  bowling - click - Three Stooges - Moe poking Curly in the eye - click - click - click
Bored, she stops - notices a small scarf on a chair next to the bed
She picks it up, holds it against her eyes and ties it tight around her head
She stands - hands out in front of her - starts to walk across the room - not so bad -  - right into a side table
Shit that hurts
Grabbing her leg, she hops - hits a lamp
Ripping the towel of f her head - hopping around on one foot - she hears: Coming
Rubbing her leg - she limps/half walks to the door - opens it to: Virgil: dark glasses, cane, smile Virgil
She pulls a towel in closer - then realizes it doesn't matter My turn to apologize
should have told you  was blind it wasn't fair
That's
You want to come in - just got out of the shower - give me a minute to get changed
(as he moves in) Sure,  promise  won't look
As Amy starts to get changed in the bathroom
Anyways,  was in the neighborhood -- actually the whole town's my neighborhood -- and since you've never been to our illustrious village,  thought maybe we could go into town - see what we see
See what we see
Figure of speech You mean right now, tonight
Great - 'm blind and you're deaf - what a pair
- few store windows lit up
Some people eating dinner at a streetside cafe
Virgil, holding Amy's arm as they walk down the street
: the Mechanic at the top of the street is Doug - smokes too much - but a good guy
Three steps down is Carlson's hardware - he's got a laugh like a donkey - we sometimes listen to games together - he's a Devil's fan
And just up ahead should be Grady's junk shop - he calls it "antiques"
Smells like junk
'd hate to see what it looks like woman bustles past,  , weighed down with groceries
(intuitively) Hey Nancy
Hey Virgil - got that book in for you
Nancy's our librarian, brings in any braille book  want
(to Amy) The guy's nuts about the pyramids - anything he can get his hands on
Thank-you Nancy - you should get your groceries home - your ice cream's melting
Nancy laughs - as she moves off
Nice place - you seem to know everyone here
Moved here when  was eight
My family figured it would be a good place for me to grow up
Tell me what you see
Well, there's a good structure to the town - genuine lines, good use of space
To be honest 'd find a better balance to a lot of these buildings
But that's me
What's you
The architect in me - can't leave well enough alone
Art school in college - made the arms for the Venus DeMilo
(realizing he probably doesn't understand) see, the Venus De Milo has no arms and
(laughs) know the Venus De Milo has no arms, and the Mona Lisa has this captivating smile and David doesn't wear a fig leaf
How do you
may not have been a lot of places - but  read about things, then make an image up here -- (points to his head) --that works for me
Grazing his hand across a telephone pole - Virgil stops - turns to Amy
This is the end of the street
We should turn back
What about past the end of the street
What's out there
He turns around
(shrugs) Nothing
No - there's an old run down building off to the side
Must be the old firehouse
It had a fire so they shut it down
(Amy laughs) Honest to God
(intrigued) What else do you see
wall of shrubs - a field with an interesting configuration of trees
The wind has picked up a bit
Tell me how you see it
(enjoying the game) , sure
Let's see - long and elegant
Like -- like a woman dancing with two lovers, trying to decide which one she loves
Virgil stops a moment - takes in the image
What
It's just - the image you just gave me - "Dancing trees
-  like that
Virgil stops - his head cocks slightly
We should go - it's starting to rain
(looking around) There's a bit of a breeze but-- - thunder - and the rain just drops
- They run in laughing - Amy closing the door behind them as Virgil moves his way into the center of the room - stands where the moonlight from a high window hits the floor
Water runs down the outside glass, causing the light to ripple across him
The room is empty - almost surreal
can't believe how fast it happens
(she sees Virgil - his head cocked towards the ceiling) Virgil
Virgil's head turns toward her
You like rain -  love the rain
(moving to him) What were you just doing there
Virgil slowly moves his head about, sensing the room
Listening - the rain - it brings out the contours of everything, gives life to a room  can't see
of the building as Virgil describes what he hears
You hear it
on the roof dripping down the walls on every side
On the right, on the drainpipe, it's drumming with a deeper, steadier sound - - like a timpani - echoing across the room - tells me the room is large - open
You feel it - in your chest
On the left, the rain says
(he listens) a fire escape, with it's own rhythm - ping - ping
Then listen - there
(he points) --what's that - over there
Looks like it's
No, listen for it - not what it looks like - what it becomes
Come here
Amy moves closer - Virgil puts his hands out on her shoulders - turns her to the sound
Now just listen to it - shut out everything but that sound - do you hear it
Amy strains to listen - closes her eyes - her head instinctively turning - no in unison with Virgil's Yes - there - it's soft - like a shimmer The wind blowing the rain against a window
(smile) Like a cymbal
It's like our own percussive symphony, isn't it
Amy opens her eyes - looks about the room - listening
The world is invisible to me - with my touch it comes alive
But only one thing at a time
But when it's raining, feel everything at once
Sometimes,  wish it could rain inside rain all around us
(musing) "Einfuehlung
" What
Einfuehlung - it's an architectural term
It means to share an empathy
Been a long time since  felt that
And as they stand listening to the rain, playing its music - Amy watches him - fascinated by him - then shivers slightly
You're cold, we should go
No, 'm fine, really
It was just something passing through me - can't explain it - a good thing
Amy smiles at him - then quietly realizes he can't see it
She moves close, her hand reaching out and taking his
What you just showed me
how feel - makes me smile
She takes his hand - hesitates - then puts it on the side of her face
see it now
Thank-you
We hold a beat - enjoying the symphony of rain - then cut to: - The sun warming the cool morning air
The school bus pulling away to reveal Virgil making his way into work
(
) thought after yesterday, you'd never get up on my table again
- Amy on the table
Virgil squirting oil in his hand - preparing
You kidding
today, 'm looking for a complete nervous breakdown
love a challenge
And as he places his palms carefully on her back - working her back slowly we hear opera play quietly in the background
: Virgil's hands on the small of her back - something amazingly sensual about how he works her muscles
Amy speaks to him in low tones - in a state of complete relaxation
Can  ask how long you've been blind
Of course, most people avoid the subject
You tell them you're blind and they act surprised
"You're blind
Reallv
didn't know - you hide it so well
" And then they wave their hand in front of your face just to make sure
(beat) It started when  was a little over a year old
Virgil's hands move down Amy's sides - slow - feeling each contour - the oil making her skin glisten
Amy moves her head slightly with his touch
She lets out a small breath of air
(quiet) You see shadows
No
Congenital cataracts
And a case of retinitis pigmentosa thrown in for good measure
This area needs to loosen up
think you're doing it
(beat) No bright lights, nothing
'm blind as a bat
Actually, blinder 'cause they emit sonar all the time
don't have a sixth sense, just don't have the fifth one
can't hear things in Vermont, can't smell if you're mad at me, and, no -  don't know Helen Keller, Ray Charles or Stevie Wonder
Amy murmurs in response to Virgil's touch
You say something
No,  just - this feels nice - too nice
Virgil moves his hands down her back - sensually kneading each muscle
It's clear he's enjoying this as much as she is
You're very good
at what you do
Another breath exhales from her involuntarily as Virgil hits a sensitive spot
Thank-you
You enjoy it
At times
Some clients make it more enjoyable than others
Virgil now works down her thighs - Amy's back arching slightly with the movement - both of them heating to the moment
Both their breaths quickening
And this client
Is very, very
- and the spell is broken
What
Sorry - it's time
've got Mr
Ketchum coming in next - all two hundred pounds
Sorry -  felt like we were just getting started
Amy sits up on the table - the sheet pulling away slightly revealing her
For a moment she watches him - his head turned towards her - but not seeing
Then she slowly pulls the sheet up covering herself
Thank-you
For last night as well - love to do it again
How about  cook dinner then, tonight
'd like that
- Aerobics step class
Amy working out
In front of her two rather large women in neon stretch workout clothes - Amy tries to avoid the view - a thought - and she shuts her eyes as she continues her exercise
- Amy, towel around her neck - coming in from the workout
Amy
'  - Onions frying
Tilt up to Virgil - cutting the last of it and putting it in the pan - sizzling as it hits
Vegetables and a box of pasta are arranged on the countertop
Sophie watches the proceedings
- the phone
Virgil stops cutting - his hand easily finds the phone
Amy: on the phone in her car on the Taconic Parkway
Virgil - it's Amy
-  can't make dinner - 'm really sorry - an emergency came up - they're dragging me back to New York
Oh
Yeah
Anything serious
The project we were working on was rejected - could go down the drain
'll deal with it quick - 'd like to come back
Yeah
Good
Well
'll be here
Virgil hangs up the phone - frustrated, he reaches for the frying pan - and promptly burns his hand
-
Dropping the pan - Sophie goes scurrying, as he kicks at it - sending it across the room
He turns - thrusts his hand under the sink - turning on the cold water
Shit - that was stupid
- Evening rush hour traffic surrounding the Flatiron building
( ) 'm just saying there seems to be something missing
-  - small cardboard model of what looks like a small mini-mall
Amy sits in front of it - drawing on a sketch pad
The office is sparse, functional
few  can be seen in the background through a glass partition
Absolutely Mr
Falk - something lj missing - we realize that now
We just need some time to figure out what
, 30's, leaning a little too ardently into a speaker phone
The voice on the other end is   - their would be employer
Their assistant  , early 20's, sits in the corner, taking notes
Fine - but you all know what kind of schedule we're on here
(watching Amy) And budget
Yes sir
Don't worry, we won't let you down
She takes a piece of paper, has an idea, starts sketching - Duncan hangs up
Don't say it,  know
You were never happy with the design
wasn't going to say that
But you'd have tinkered with it till the job went away
So now we've got him hooked, you've got your second chance
And Amy shoves her rough sketch across the table
Look at these site photos - see those trees - we were going to get rid of them - let's incorporate them into the design use what's natural about the location
(Duncan stares at her) And by the way - the 53rd St
lobby - coming back from Pinecrest,  came up with a new addition - add some life to that place
Duncan stares at the sketch - then looks up at Amy -- what's going on here
We sent Hydra the three headed monster off a few days ago and got back Mary Poppins in return
What
can't have a couple of ideas
(even Betsy stares at her) Fine, you want to know -  met a guy
Betsy stands
Too modern for me
Sit down
Betsy
We're all friends here
So - spill the beans
Nothing to spill - he's a good guy - smart, funny, blind
Whoa, whoa - wait a minute - Blind
Like tap-tap, white cane blind
Come on Amy -  mean,  know you like challenges, hell you married me - but
knew you'd be understanding
(standing) No, no  am
You're right, this is none of my business anymore - but a blind guy
If you're lonely - in my
opinion -- get a puppy
Duncan, don't be a jerk
You still work here
He's gone
He's just jealous
So much for the "we're all friends here" idea
-  - - Computer screen
cursor blinks - then the words - a  and a web page for the comes up
- we see Amy hovering over her computer - various sketches of the proposed building next to her - two giant Magnolia trees have been incorporated into the design
As we watch her search on the computer we move over her shoulder to see in the corner of her plans - a sketch of the intertwined "dancing trees" and the Firehouse
Betsy enters carrying her jacket
Everybody's gone for the day
Thanks
You go ahead - 'm just finishing up something here
She turns to look at Betsy who now peers over her shoulder - sees what she's doing
Amy looks up at her - sees Betsy's look
What
just want to know a little more about what's wrong with him
(pause) Amy
Friend to friend
Shoot hate to admit it but  agree with Duncan on this one
(back to the computer) Don't shoot
He makes sense sometimes
My father had a problem a few years back with severe cataracts
Do you have any idea what you're getting into
Amy spins in her chair - looks to Betsy
You ever listened to rain - mean really listened
This like that smell the roses thing
(turns to her) 've spent the last five years of my adult life with a man who has the emotional content of a soap dish
The only time saw him cry was doing our tax return three years ago
(beat) need more than that, Betsy
For once in a long, long time  feel like  can breathe again
Just the way he touches me  know  found someone  can connect with
Ah, here we go
No, no
can tell he's sensing everything about me with a simple touch
He listens to my every word as if it's the only sound on the planet - feel like even though he can't see me, he knows everything about me
He just moves me - does that sound crazy
(beat) Does he have a brother
:    - The  , nestled against a strand of pine
Virgil skates fast across the ice enjoying the speed - the wind using his hockey stick as a guide - he nears the edge of pond - feels it with the stick and slams to a stop
He shuffles his body around to face in the other direction - then starts skating again - passing  standing on the snow covered bank
- smiling, watching Virgil - enjoying his release of energy
-  - skating well, a look of relaxation we've never seen on his face
He skates in an arc coming back past Amy
Finally she speaks
Wayne Gretzky, look out
Virgil slams to a halt in surprise - nearly toppling over
Sorry -- sorry
Didn't mean to scare you
Amy
said 'd come back
How long
how long have you been
Watching you
Just got here - couldn't find you at the spa - took a chance you'd be here
You're very good
Skated since  was a kid
My dad taught me - wanted me to play pro one day
How do you like my pond
It's beautiful
Describe it for me
Let's see
Like cool blue silk - you know blue
think so - keep going
Blue silk stretched tight across a bowl - surrounded by white jacketed sentries of trees on the horizon, protecting it from the outside world
Horizon's a tough one
What
Never understood horizon - if touch it - don't know what it that's   liked the rest of picture
(he starts moving towards her) You want to skate
Sorry,  didn't bring my skates
Don't need them
Come on step hold of my stick
Excuse me
(smile) Hockey stick
Here
He holds the stick out like a cross bar
Amy moves cautiously forward and takes hold of it
Now hold on for balance
used to do this with Jennie when we were kids
And Virgil starts skating backwards pulling Amy with him
Amy is apprehensive at first then starts to enjoy the movement - the sensation - both of them laughing out loud
as we see them move about the rink - Amy sliding and being pulled by Virgil
As he picks up speed we hear Amy scream in delight
Look out - we're running out of ice
Virgil turns expertly, arcing around the edge of the ice but Amy loses her nerve - and balance - and lets go of the stick and goes flying into an embankment
The momentum carries Virgil off down the ice - both of them laughing hysterically
You
Fine
Never been dumped so fast in my life
Me, dump you
No way
Stay where you are - 'll come to you - just keep talking
Amy sits up on her elbows in the embankment
What do  say
Virgil starts gliding across the ice searching for Amy
(hearing her voice, veering in her direction) Anything - how'd you become an architect
God - let's see -  was in college - art school - a little aimless - and  met this guy -
an architect - opened up a new world to me
liked the structure the control - finding problems, coming up with solutions - when  graduated - we started a company together - on impulse got married - which was crazy - divorced a year ago - but we're still partners
which must seem even crazier
And Virgil's suddenly there - going a little too far - tumbling off the pond and into her
You'd think  meant to do that
patented move
They're close - in the snow together - face to face
(Amy smiles, realizes) This is tough
What
bat my eyelashes, toss my head just right, and there's this very sexy thing do with my eyes - then realize none of it matters to you
It doesn't matter
Tell me what you look like
1 don't know 'm
Wait
Let me
He puts his hand out, over her face -- hesitates, then slowly feels down the contours of her cheek, her eyelids, the shape of her lips - Amy moving with the touch, the sensuality of it - and as he continues - Amy's hand reaches up - touching his face - Virgil smiles
Eyes, mouth, chin, cheek
you are very beautiful
Thank-you
So are you - more than could describe
Virgil's hands move down her face - closing her eyes - letting her just experience his touch - his exploring
And as both their hands continue, enjoying the sensation of discovering each other - Amy leans forward, her eyes still closed, finding his mouth - grazing his lips with her own - softly, gently, then they fold into each other's arms locked into a warm, deep kiss
'  -  - It's dark - a pale moonglow highlights the two intertwined naked bodies
fire burns in the background
In flowing  we see them make love: Virgil - his head tilted down - Amy - puts her hand to his chin - lifts his head - then kisses each of his closed eyelids in rhythm with Virgil's movements
Amy - now astride Virgil - she closes her eyes - feels it the way Virgil would - moving faster now - in total rhythm - shuddering in mutual release -- and she collapses on top of him - a deep breath and she rolls over - cuddles into his arm
long beat - out of breath: So -- that's what a blind date is
They breathe - then both start laughing - quietly - then hysterically together as Virgil wraps her up in his arms - holding her tightly
- The horizon
The sun cresting it - bringing a new light to the day
'  -   Sounds of a shower in the background
Amy in Virgil's robe, pulls a juice container out of the fridge - pours herself a glass, putting the juice on the counter as she walks into the living room - taking in the sparseness of his surroundings
- an open Braille Book
The completely white pages with minute bumps
Amy pulls up a chair, sits - and flips through the book, running her hand across the pages - trying to understand his world
She then turns to the front cover to see what it is
Playboy
We hear the shower stop as Amy smiles, puts the book down - pushes the chair aside then moves to a series of pictures on the wall: Virgil as a young boy - his sister Jennie a few years older - and his mother and father
Then another picture next to it - Virgil in his skates and Jennie older - no father - Sophie at their feet
And a final picture - Virgil as an adult - he and Jennie on the front porch - his arms wrapped around his sister like he's never going to let go
(
) Hello
Amy turns to see - Jennie, carrying a bag under her arm
Hello
Jennie moves towards the kitchen
'm Jennie, Virgil's sister
And you are
Virgil steps out - bathrobe - drying his hair
Jen, this is Amy Tremont
Jennie now at the kitchen - stares at the juice container - places it back in the fridge - just so
was just at the market Virgil, picking up a few things before school - and  thought you might like some
(smells) Apples and bananas
Amy sees the fruit on the counter - impressed
He's being a show-off, Amy -  always bring him these
(putting them in the fridge) The apples are on the bottom shelf
At two o'clock
Oranges at 10
know, thanks
Amy -- you in town long
And  - Virgil moving into the room, collides right into the chair Amy moved - knocking into a lamp sending it to the ground
Jennie immediately rushes over
Virgil
'm fine
No you're not - you're bleeding
(turning to Amy, sudden) First lesson with a blind man, Amy - don't change anything - it's too dangerous (moving to Virgil) 'm sorry -  didn't know
It was my fault
'm
Jennie still dabbing at his leg
(embarassed, snaps) Goddamit, Jennie -  said  was - leave me alone
Jennie hesitates, then stands to go - sees the hockey book out of place
glance to Amy and she picks it up - quietly moves it back to it's rightful spot
've got parent meetings tonight - there's dinner in the freezer - left corner
(turns to Amy) Nice to have met you, Amy
Me too - and again - 'm sorry
And she's gone - leaving Amy and Virgil together - a moment of awkwardness
She seemed
nice
She seemed jealous
Your leg is still bleeding
It'll stop - happens all the time
Welcome to my world
We hold on Amy - taking this in: - Japanese lanterns criss-cross across an open area
Guests of the spa mingle about - drinks in hand - some dance on a floor set up over the aerobics area
Music plays in the background
Amy, carrying two trays of food, finds her way to where Virgil sits at a table off to the side - putting his food in front of him
Let's see if  can get this right
Chicken's at three - salad at seven - vegetables at ten
(picking up his fork) Very good - thank-you
This is nice
They do this every weekend
Every Friday - for the guests leaving
Supposed to make them want to come back
(sits, uneasy) Love the music - Gershwin - makes you want to
She stops
Virgil, fork poised over his food, senses her uncomfortableness
You like dancing
Hmmm
Yeah - don't do it much
(changing subject) Chicken's good
Amy resumes eating - Virgil's fork spears something on his plate - raising it to his mouth - both we and Amy now see it's a large pat of butter
Too late - it's in his mouth
Amy watches him - the reaction on his face as he tastes it - then surreptitiously swallows it
Then realizes Amy saw him
Nothing like a good pat of fat
What do you say we dance
No, really, 'm fine
Virgil is up - pulling her hand
Come on She stands and Virgil puts his hands on the back of her shoulders
Lead on
And as she ushers him to the floor the music changes - a salsa - lively
Amy stops: Different piece - maybe we should
You kidding - take my hand
And as she does - Virgil starts dancing to the music - feeling the beat - in perfect rhythm but his moves are his own, something we've never seen before - uninhibited, wild - a little funny, but also there's something sensual in his abandonment
All Amy can do is hang on for the ride - enjoying Virgil enjoying himself
People even clear back a little to give him some room - however he moves about the floor easily - somehow sensing where the other couples are
It's a whirlwind moment - a moment where the two of them get lost with each other - for a second shutting out the world and it's just them, the music and their movement
Then suddenly the music is over
And they stop - the moment gone
Virgil turns to Amy and she applauds Virgil's wild moves He takes a bow with a flourish
Spins to another angle - another bow
Spins back again - a step back and: - he's into the buffet table - sliding to the ground - food spilling on top of him
Amy, can't help but laugh, rushes to him
You have to teach me that move
And Amy reaches down to his guacamole covered hand - and pulls him up into an embrace and as they kiss amidst sauce and salad dressing - we see: '   - Amy - on the phone - looking out her window
Betsy - you were telling me about your father, his cataracts - you said he had a problem
How is he now
(she listens) Doctor - Dr
Aaron
- do you have his number
- handful of people on various pieces of equipment
Virgil, tank top, heavy sweat, on a stationary bicycle - working out
Amy next to him on a treadmill - trying to keep up as Caroline from the front desk comes and hands her something
Amy reads it briefly then hops off the treadmill moving to Virgil
Virgil,  just got some great news
(picking up speed again) The Atlanta project
No, no -  was talking to my assistant this morning - her father had these severe cataracts
(slowing) Oh
Really
She put me in touch with a Dr
Richard Aaron - the guy's the leading eye surgeon on the eastern seaboard - he's been working with techniques -  don't know all the jargon - but  spoke to him earlier on the phone at the Institute
You called this guy
Virgil stops riding - starts to get off the bike
(excited) told him all about you - he just faxed me back - he'd love to get a look at your eyes - he thinks maybe, mavbe - there might be a chance of reversal
Virgil faces Amy, best he can, while he pulls on his sweat jacket
don't get it - am  missing the sign that says it's help the handicapped week
Virgil starts to move away
Amy stops him
thought you'd be excited
What's the problem
Virgil turns on her
No problem
That's the whole point here Amy - there is no goddamned problem
And Virgil turns and bumps into a stationary bike, he  it off to the side, and makes his way out of the gym
- Virgil enters, visibly upset - passing a - coming out of the shower
- Hey Virgil
Virgil steams right past him - not answering - hands feeling down the lockers - finding his - he tugs it open - pulls off his shirt and throws it in
He takes a breath, settles himself - then the locker door shut
' are picking up their  from Jennie's school
As Jennie helps the last of the kids into her mother's car - she looks up to see Amy across the street
Amy, right
Amy nods - starts towards her
'd like to talk to you if could -- about Virgil
Something wrong
Sort of
There's something  don't understand
You see  spoke to a doctor who's apparently doing breakthrough work on cataracts - (Jennie turns to Amy) - but when  brought it up to Virgil he acted as if
What don't you understand
If  was blind almost all my life -- and there was even a remote possibility could see - 'd jump at it
When there's something you've adapted to, accepted - you'd just want to change it without even thinking about it
(beat) We're very comfortable here, Amy
Virgil has everything he needs
thought just maybe he'd like to not be falling over things for the rest of his life
Look,  see
(cuts her off) Yes you do and Virgil doesn't
He spent the first eight years of his life having his eyes prodded, pierced and poked by doctors, faith healers, spiritualists, shamans and medicine men
My father had them lined up out the door
It hurt and disappointed us all and it almost killed him
He doesn't need to go through that again
Now - maybe you understand
And she turns on her heel and is gone
'  - Amy making her way up to the porch - hearing from inside
(
) No, no - why - why
She hurries up the steps, reaching the open door where she sees Virgil, his head in his hands
(
) can't believe you're doing this to me
What - Virgil
Virgil turns sharply - Sophie jumps up - starts barking
Sophie - stop it
Amy
'mon in - it's just the Rangers
could check better than these guys today
They lost
prefer to think of it as not winning
thought you would have been long gone after that outburst from my evil twin brother
We've had him committed you know
Rikers Island - hard time
(standing) Can  get you something - - Coke - beer
No -  - 'm fine
just wanted apologize for stomping around in life like Bigfoot today
Virgil turns towards Amy
Amy, you see the big tree outside
How far is it from my front porch
Guessing, about thirty feet
To you
But to me, it's fourteen steps exactly
Fourteen steps and  arrive right where  want to be
But -- if  run or rush, 'll lose count and slam into it
'm sorry
Told you - can't leave well enough alone
-  guess  should get back, start to pack
Rushing into trees again
Off Amy's smile we  : '  - On the Porch - the two of them - sipping glasses of wine - we see their dinner - Hungry Man beef entree - each category of food in it's own perfect little compartment
You know this dinner - this is really quite
Ordinary
(she laughs) It's an acquired taste - trust me
Jennie thinks it's the only way 'll know where my food is
But  have a secret weapon
(holds up a little bottle) Hot sauce
Let's you know you're eating something - like some
He starts to sprinkle liberally on Amy's food
Amy, laughing grabs the bottle
That's  - 'll do it
Don't want to overdo it
She puts the bottle down - looks to Virgil - sips her wine
Time to face it
Virgil -  have to go home tomorrow
Wait, wait - you smell that
No - what
The winter pines - it's so strong at night - drifts on the wind - wait - hear the breeze then
There
Amy closes her eyes - takes in the scent - and they both sit there - close - taking in the night air - enjoying the moment
And on Virgil's face we see him lost in thought
'  - - eyes closed - we hear a sound - like night crickets
His eyes slowly open
He rolls over - his arm reaching out for her: But there's no one there
Virgil sits upright
Amy
Amy is sitting in a chair by the window
'm here - trouble sleeping
'mere
And she crawls back into bed, Virgil takes hold of her and as she settles into his arm, he strokes her face gently - a blind man's version of watching his lover fall to sleep
- then we hear voices '  - : Amy's face - the voices awaken her - cutting into her dreams
She looks out the doorway - sees Virgil and Jenny arguing on the front porch
She can't hear what they are saying - but it's clear there's a problem
'   - Amy pulling a robe around herself - comes into the room - as Jenny turns on her heel and walks away from Virgil
- Virgil stands there a moment - taking in what just happened
Amy steps out onto the porch
Everything alright
Yeah, yeah
Morning - Look, something  want to say
The leaving thing -  know - hate it too
The other night - when we were dancing - being with you -  felt different - special -  don't know - whole
That was whole
Virgil puts his hand out - she takes it - he turns to her
(smile) Just for a second  felt like  could see you - all of you
(beat) What you said about this Doctor, this eye guy - know how important it is to you
(turns to him) Are you sure you want to do this
We're just going to talk to the guy - what could it hurt
Off Amy's smile: : - soaring shot
Amy's car - travelling across the bridge - heading towards Manhattan
(
0
) You're going to love the city - so many things to see
- Virgil in the passenger seat - windows open - taking in all the sounds - new and exciting
Amy watches him as she drives
(laughing) Waitwaitwait - he hasn't said he can even do anything yet
know  just feel good about this
(Amy looks to him - sees him feeling the light against his face) Virgil, before you lost all sight, do you remember seeing anything at all
Yeah,  do
was just a baby when it happened - but there is one thing
(beat) Something
puffy
That's all remember about it
Everyone says it's "clouds," but  know  had it in my hands - so it couldn't be clouds
This puffy thing - that was something special - it's stayed with me all these years - don't know why
-   - , wire rims, short, stylish haircut - is finishing a high-tech examination of Virgil's eyes
Cups attached to wires sit over his eyes
The machine, an , emits an irritating strange flat line sound
The room is very dimly lit
Aaron adjusts an intensity dial on the machine - a series of flashing lights hit Virgil's eyes
The doctor jots down a reading - then with a flourish, spins the machine away from Virgil's face and pops a button emitting a detailed computer print out
In the corner sits an older gentleman - Dr
Goldman - focused on papers in his hands
- we're done
Aaron bumps up the lights and wheels his chair back over to Virgil as Amy moves to join them
Some good news
You have grade 4 posterior subscapular cataracts
And this is the good news
Good news in that  should be able to remove them with little or no damage to your cornea
So -- what does that mean - they're gone - then what
The cataracts are acting like a curtain - covering the window of sight
If the disease to the retina is reduced as much as  think it is - there's a very good possibility we can give you sight
Amy looks to Virgil - apprehensive
Virgil's expressionless - taking this all in
Sounds expensive
(looks to Goldman who nods imperceptibly) We feel there's an opportunity for us all here - think  can get the institute to pick up the bill
So
Say you remove the cataracts - do you have any idea what kind of vision 'd have
Aaron looks to Goldman
At this time - no
Unfortunately the cataracts are not allowing me to see the retinal wall
can't tell how advanced the retinitas pigmentosa has become
So you're suggesting an operation that may or may not be successful
But there is a chance he could regain his sight
There have been a few cases of restored vision in adulthood to a patient blind since birth
(moves near Virgil) The operation is delicate, 'll admit - but nothing as invasive as what you went through as a child
Of course there is always some risks with any operation - infection, swelling - long shot stuff
would do both eyes at the same time - it's basically out patient surgery
Virgil - an exhale of air
lot to take in
What if it doesn't work
What if  have the operation - with all it's risks - and you remove the cataract - and it doesn't work
Aaron looks to Amy
(somber) It would be evident that you will never be able to see
Virgil's head shifts slightly
Not what he wanted to hear
Amy reaches out takes his hand
What do you think
That's what  need - to think
'  -  - Virgil and Amy stepping out of a cab
Virgil using his cane - seems blinder than we've seen him before
The city sounds an assault on him
This is my place - there's a park across the street and
She stops - realizes he wants to walk in silence
They enter her loft building, an old converted industrial space
- There is an odd, loud sound which echoes three times after every bounce
As they come up on the second floor landing, a basketball comes flying down the hall which Amy fumbles with - then catches
Ethan
From around the corner comes  , eight, oversized Knicks shirt
Amy tosses him his ball
Sorry - my mom won't let me go outside till she gets home from work
Well, if the super catches you playing ball in the hall, he'll have a coronary
what
Never mind
Ethan, this is my friend Virgil
Hey, Ethan (seeing his cane) Are you blind
Yeah
Cool
See ya
And he turns and runs back up the stairs
(apologetic) Virgil
Hey, the kid thinks 'm cool - what's so bad
'  - Amy's loft is a wide open space - a  facing onto a small living area - a  in the corner of the room - a   with and   fill one side of the room
By a window stands a plaster  stuck in the corner as if forgotten
This is where  hang my hat - it's a bit of a mess but
Amy stops, realizes he can't see it
Virgil puts his overnight bag down
Now, Blind 101
Help me out with a mental map
Walk me down a straight line and show me your place, all the obstacles
Remember once you've told me, they can't be moved - otherwise
Got it - here take my arm
(they start about the room) Couch, chair,  to the left, low table at
at 4 o'clock, has the phone on it
They come to the Sculpture, Virgil's hand grazes across it
What's this
Nothing
sculpture
It's yours
My art school days - not very good
Virgil continues to feel the sculpture from top to bottom, not stopping during the dialogue
It's a mother
- holding her child - up in the air - like she's proud
It's beautiful
It's not done yet - one day 'll finish it
Virgil turns - his hand to the wall - feels a window: Does this window open
could use some air
(moving to the windows) think so
As Amy throws open the window, a wind blasts through - catching a stack of plans on her drafting table - blowing them across the floor
Damn
Virgil turns, concerned, makes his way to her
What happened
The wind - knocked over my plans
Amy down on the floor picking them up - Virgil senses her down there - crouches down beside her - tries to help her pick up
What is this - these plans
Amy looks at Virgil - - his hand running across one of her plans
Just my work - - some plans for the Atlanta project we're bidding on - drawings of a lobby we're finishing up, some other smaller stuff
It's -- it's what  do
Amy realizes they mean nothing to him - he hands them back - stands
She watches him - then standing, moves to him
've got to get to work
Tonight we'll do something - we could listen to music or go out for dinner
How about a movie
movie
Yeah
haven't been in years
Alright
movie
won't be long
And Amy gives him a quick kiss and dodges for the door - a beat - she forgets her purse - steps back in to see: Virgil standing there quietly - his hand out on her plans again - feeling the paper - searching for the design - wanting to know her - wanting to understand her - finding nothing there
Amy feels uncomfortable - quietly steps out - closes the door
- - the theater half full playing Woody Allen's "Annie Hall" the very funny scene where Woody and Diane Keaton wrestle with the lobster
We move in slowly and discover Virgil and Amy leaning in close to each other - Amy quietly describing the scene to him
There's these big pots and Woody's got a huge lobster in his hand
Lobster - what's a lobster
(trying not to use her hands to describe) It's a
kind of like
it's got
Then she looks to Virgil - sees he was kidding her
(laughing) That's it - you're on your own
Off Virgil's laugh: - - a subway train explodes past us
- collection of typical night riders - everyone keeping to themselves
Two kids sit in the corner - blasting their boom box Virgil stands in the middle of the train - enjoying the vibrations
Amy sits on a seat watching him
And they lived happily ever after
Woody and Diane
And the lobster
Stop with the lobster
song comes on the radio - Virgil's head turns
Hey - you here that
All she hears is the clatter of the subway
What
Virgil turns towards the music -  his hands rhythmically on the subway car wall
Hey - can you turn that up
The  shrugs -  it up
It's Gershwin's "Can't take that Away from Me
" Virgil turns to Amy - picks up on the song - hands - he starts singing: "The way you comb your hair, The way you sip your tea
" He finds Amy, pulls her up and into an embrace as he saunters them down the aisle
Virgil
(loudly) "Can't take that away from meee" - what
People are watching
Watching
Watching what
You
Me
Everyone is staring at us
And
Well - it can be embarrassing
(kidding) Oh -  see
No - you don't
Touche
"The way you make me see
" (turns to him) What do you mean
(Virgil gives her a look - want the operation) You mean it
mean  only want you to have the operation
Amy
want the chance to see
The chance to see Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge, apples, raisins, a buffalo, a carbuerator and the man in the moon
(beat) But  would give all that up - just to see this face
And Amy folds herself into Virgil - a moment - they hold each other - then - Amy starts to sing along with the song - Virgil joining in - and they dance - together - in love
: - / (
0
) "You can't take that away from me
" And the car explodes past again - and as the music dies we cut to: - : a platter of silver utensils - fine, exacting scalpels gloved  comes into frame - picks up a clamp - and we follow it to: '  - the clamp being used to hold it open
The work we are seeing is grueling - difficult to watch - but at the same time so fascinating it is hard to take our eyes off
Dr
Aaron followed by Dr
Goldman - hands in the air - mask on - leans over Virgil - looks to the  who nods - then to no one in particular
Virgil - let's get to it
And as he is handed a , we watch as it moves down to cut open the white section of the eye - and just as it feels almost unbearable to watch- - -   - We see Amy, coffee cup in hand, grab a second just poured cup out of a vending machine
She makes her way over to reveal Jennie who sits quietly reading a book
Coffee
It's really bad
Jennie looks up - smiles takes the cup
Amy sits down next to her
They both sip for a moment
Virgil never mentions his parents - do they know
Our mother died when  was 20 - Virgil wasn't even a teenager
And our father - he's been gone for quite awhile
'm sorry
didn't know
Jennie looks into her coffee - takes another sip
(smile) You're right this is bad
It must have been very tough on you - taking care of Virgil alone after your mother died
He's my brother
Simple
You don't like Virgil doing this - do you
don't like Virgil getting hurt
Hope is like fire, it can keep you warm - - or it can burn you
-   - Dr
Aaron: - focused on his exacting work
His hands move deftly
: Virgil's eye
Cut open
Aaron's probe working right in the middle of it
There you are
And Aaron pulls out the cloudy cataract tissue - holding it up for all to see - before he  it on a tray
Switching instruments - he gingerly picks up a plastic implant - moving back towards the eye - he glances at the nurse assisting him: You know what they say, Virgil
The eyes are the windows to the soul
Virgil can't move - listens intently as he carefully places the implant into Virgil's eye
(with a wink) That makes us the Windex to the soul
(he focuses) , both eyes done
Let's patch him up
On a large monitor we see an  - of Virgil's eye - waiting
- Virgil being wheeled down a hall - head wrapped in bandages
- As he enters: Hello
Jennie's there - takes his hand
Jennie
How're you feeling
- a little pain, like a tequila hang over - is Amy here
Right here - Dr
Aaron said you did great So how's my hair - 'd hate the first time see myself to be a bad hair day
(Virgil reacts to a sound) What's that
There's camera guys here too
- we now see the room has a small   in it preparing to document the event
Camera guys
(entering) For posterity
We're going to make you famous
We're also sending this closed circuit to one of our conference rooms - there's a lot of people interested in our results today
So how you feel Virgil
Good
Great
Fine
(a laugh) Nervous
Aaron moves about the room closing blinds to let in just a few slats of light
Nothing to be nervous about
Now Jennie and Amy, if you would stand off to my right --  want Virgil to get just a slight bounce of light
(returning to Virgil) Ready Virgil
Let's go
Both Amy and Jennie subconsciously adjust their hair as Aaron starts to unravel the bandages
When the bandages are completely off - all that is left are two gauze patches on both eyes
Okay - last phase - we remove these patches and
(suddenly apprehensive, hand up) Okay - wait
So - so - what do  do
mean, what will  see first
Well - we're all here - Amy, your sister
This is new for us all
Why don't we find out
Aaron reaches up and plucks the two patches from his eyes - and everyone waits
Virgil slowly opens his eyes - he just seems to be staring blankly, bewildered - not focusing at Aaron who stands before him, still holding the bandages
Amy looks to Jennie - to Aaron - what's happening
Then finally: Well
And Virgil reacts - a startling look of recognition mixed with fear crossing his face
What is it Virgil
It's - it's -  don't know
And now for the first time we see Virgil's : There is light, movement, color, shadow - but somehow it is foreign to us
There is no perception of depth -
no sense of definition of shape or shadow - it is as confounding to us as it is to Virgil - like an explosion of Picasso, Dali and Monet on screen
Suddenly in the midst of this chaos of images - there is movement - and a voice emits out of what we now for the first time recognize as a mouth
Dr
Aaron speaks again - leaning in to Virgil, who reacts back
Virgil - what do you see
Something's wrong
Jennie's reaction comes pouring out of her eyes in tears, first slowly, then a dam break
Virgil what's wrong
What's happening
Everything's fine - it's going to take
It's not fine - don't say it's fine
Tell me what you're seeing Virgil
Virgil suddenly pulling back - his eyes dancing around in his head - trying to take it all in - trying to focus
(over everyone) don't know - it's all screwed up - this can't be seeing - something's wrong - too confusing - what the hell's happening
- the camera crew coming toward him for a closer shot - it's like a giant monster violently moving towards us
What is it - Stop
Virgil's hand lashes out towards the camera crew - even though they are 15 feet away
What
The camera
(to the crew) Stop moving
Virgil, it's just the camera
The room has heightened into chaos - Virgil reacting to everything he sees, any quick movement - Amy moves next to him - Aaron trying to remain calm - Jennie assuring Virgil everything's
Alright - alright - they've stopped
Let's everybody just calm down - we'll take it slowly
Everyone settles - takes a breath
Virgil
What can we do
They all look to Virgil - breathing heavy - his eyes swinging back and forth
gotta focus - gotta think - gimme a second - ,  - get me a coke
Somebody
He's thirsty - someone get him a drink
No - just a can - a bottle -- put something in my hands
Amy reaches over - grabs an empty coke can
Here - how's this
Virgil takes it in his hands - closes his eyes - feels it
Then slowly opens his eyes - trying to focus on what is in his hand - Aaron catching on
Good, Virgil - that's it - use your touch - associate - now, tell me - what do you see in your hand
Long moment
Virgil holds it up - stares hard
can
Is it a can
What's going on
They all look at Virgil turning the can over and over in his hand - staring intently at it - learning it
(beams) He's associating - one sense to the other
His fingers tell his brain - then his brain tells his eyes and he recognizes the image in front of him
(realizing) He's seeing
Aaron looks to Amy and Jennie - they're still doubtful - he motions to them to meet him outside
Virgil - let's rest your eyes for today and we'll check them again tomorrow
We should all be happy - we've got something
Virgil: not happy, just very confused
As Aaron leaves, Jennie takes Virgil's hand while Amy stands there upset - watching him just staring at a Soda Can
- In the corridor, Dr
Aaron shaking hands with Dr
Goldman - people exiting the near-by conference room all congratulating the two doctors
As Amy exits the room - Aaron moves to her
What just happened in there
You saw it
Success
Success - wait a minute - then why can't he see me, his sister, anything
He sees you
He just doesn't understand that he sees you
But he'll overcome it -  mean - this is temporary right
There's a very real possibility the part of his brain area allocated to vision is atrophied - given it's lack of use, Virgil has probably used it for some other function
Jennie has stepped into the waiting area - has just heard Aaron
You didn't think of this
This is as much an accusation of Amy as of Aaron
We had no way of knowing what his faculties were until we gave him the operation
If you remember - we didn't know what to expect - though it's clear his retinal disease must be in remission
So what are we supposed to do now - you saw him - it's like he's another person in there
He won't need to stay here - take him home - let him rest
But  will need to see him every couple of days for the next month
Isn't there some kind of therapy he should be doing - someone to help him
Aaron stares at her - hadn't thought of this
, there is a visual therapist - Ray Webster - a little unorthodox - that's why he's probably your best bet, especially considering the unique aspects of Virgil's condition
'll contact him for you - but there's no guarantee he can help
(can't believe this) No guarantees
Jennie,  told Amy here when we first talked - this is whole new ground - for all of us
And Jennie quietly turns and goes back into Virgil's room
Amy just stares at Dr
Aaron - a little overwhelmed
-   - Virgil - starting to dress
He stares at his clothes on a hangar - not comprehending what it is
He closes his eyes - his hand going out to feel it - then opening his eyes - he takes the shirt turns - and notices someone watching him
Hello
- it's his own reflection in a mirror next to his clothes
Virgil stares at himself standing stock still - waiting for a response from the person staring at him
Is there
Slowly realizing that what he sees is himself
He starts moving towards the mirror fascinated
Virgil's  - Focusing on the image as it slowly takes shape - becomes clearer to him
His hand going up to his nose - moving it back and forth - laughs at it's absurdity - then is taken with his own smile
He tries a smile - comes off awkward as he starts to stare at his teeth
Touching each part of his face he investigates his chin, ears and finally his hair
Then he stops - and just stares - and stares at a face that is his own - but so incredibly foreign to him
Who is this person
'  - Jenny starting to pack up Virgil's things
Suddenly there is a burst of laughter from the other room
She looks up quizzically - - Amy in the check-in area - pacing - on a cellphone
Duncan -  know the additions to the mall will cost more
look,  can't do this on the phone - 'll be in tomorrow
yes,  remembered they're putting the fixtures in the lobby - 'll get there as well - 'm just asking for one more day
- Jenny - finishing packing up Virgil's things
(
) Amy
Jenny looks up - Virgil standing in the doorway, dressed
No - it's Jennie
She moves toward him - Virgil pulls back - hands out in front of him
'm sorry - 'll move slower -  just
And Virgil's hands are on her face - eyes closed - feeling
He opens his eyes - staring blankly - trying to figure this out
This is you
This is me
- Angle on Amy moving down the hall - hearing the voices
- Everything's going to be alright - we just need to get you home
No, no -  can't go home
need to be here - see the therapist - doctor's
want to be here
But  can't stay here - and you can't do this alone--who's going to take care
She stops
Realizing
On Amy - outside the door - not wanting to go in
Amy
She's going to look after you
She doesn't know anything about the blind
'm not blind anymore - and 'm not going to let someone  care about walk out of my life again
(moves to him) It's not your fault he left
You can't keep blaming yourself
(beat) 'm staying here
pause - and Jennie moves her hand out to him - touches his arm
- Amy feeling uncomfortable - starts to step away
(
) Amy
Amy turns - Jennie in the doorway
Virgil's finishing getting ready
Could you walk me to my car
Amy nods - sees an element of defeat in Jennie's eyes
- Jennie and Amy stand on the curb near Jennie's car
moment of uncomfortableness - then: You alright
'm scared to death
've spent my whole life looking for any holes he might fall in
'd run up ahead and cover them
Everywhere look here,  see holes
Please believe me -  don't want him to get hurt anymore than you do
Amy - when Virgil was very young, he couldn't see those close to him - so he never learned to reach out
(turns to her) Don't expect him to reach out when he's in pain, or confused, or unhappy
If you really care about him you have to just be there for him
And before Amy can answer, she gets into her car - starts it up and drives off
/ '
- Virgil slowly gets out of the cab, looks up at the buildings - immediately gets dizzy and nearly falls over
Amy lunges to help him
Virgil is laughing in spite of himself
This is just great -  don't believe this
What's that saying - stop the world  wanna get off
(
) Hey Virgil, it's Ethan
Virgil turns to the familiar voice
Ethan, basketball under his arm, coming out of the building with his Mom,
Virgil scans, tries to focus on them
That you Ethan
It's me - and this is my mom
Virgil - Karen
Hi, Virgil - heard a lot about you
You look funny
You should see how  look from this side
Let's just get you inside - then you can rest
We'll see you later Ethan
Karen
And she gives Karen a small glance as she takes Virgil's arm as they start towards the stairs leading into the building - Virgil suddenly slamming to a halt
Wait, wait, what are we doing - '
Virgil's  - the staircase
flat image - a solid wall with horizontal lines
Ethan, surprised, what's up here
It's  - it's not a wall - it's just a staircase
You're going to have to trust me on these things
God,  feel like
like such a child - just thought seeing would be different
We'll get a hold of this Ray Webster guy - we'll get his help
Virgil steps slowly forward - giant baby steps - each foot reaching out to feel the step before making the commitment
- the 'wall' of stairs changing perspective with each step
Like an accordion spreading itself out to us
This is all a very bad acid trip
'  - '  - multi-colored balloons, dozens of assorted flowers, bowls of colorful fruit and streamers intertwined across the room candyland of seeing
Man
Something exploded in your apartment
Amy laughs - pulls him into the room
Virgil trying to take it all in - not understanding anything
wanted to do something special for you
It's making me a little bit dizzy - but it is special
Virgil's hands go out - Amy moves to him - he holds her shoulders
He stares at her
As she turns her head slightly, Virgil is able to focus on her - her eyes - her smile
Okay - so - this is what beautiful looks like
Thank-you
You want to see the rest
Focusing on her, Virgil smiles, takes her face in his hands - leans in and kisses her
She pulls back a little
can't believe this - how nervous  am
She kisses him then takes a step back
What if you don't like what you see
Do you want me to turn off the lights
No - no
This is your first seeing day
(she starts to unbutton her dress) want you to see everything
And she drops the dress from her shoulders - it hits the ground - a beat - and she stands there naked
Yes, very
And she takes a step towards him and folds into his arms and as they kiss we slowly fade to black
'  - The sound of heavy New York rain
Amy awakening, and sees Virgil is gone, his side of the bed empty
She looks across the room - where she sees silhouetted against the moonlit window - - Virgil standing next to Amy's sculpture, his face and body pressed up against the pane of glass
(wrapping a house coat around her) Virgil
Virgil turns around - half faces her - the rain on the windows decorating his face
can't sleep - 'm afraid if  close my eyes
It'll be black when you open them again
Virgil nods
moment and his hand goes out to her sculpture
You enjoy sculpting
At first
liked the idea of molding - taking the way  saw things up here- - (touching her head) - and making it take shape with my hands
But you never finish them
Pieces never come out the way  wanted - the way  saw them
end up working on them forever - like this one - never getting them right
Virgil stares out the window at the rain
This is what rain looks like
Yeah
It looks lonely
Not what  expected
But  like it
Amy smiles - moves into him as he pulls her in close and they look out at the night rain
- - Amy working over a  computer with & draftsman
You've got to alter each of the windows by five feet
These are the specs you gave me
know - 'm changing them - this is better
(calling out) Betsy
Betsy pokes her head in
Can you get me some research on those Maple trees we're leaving in
They're too big -  want to change them so they fit in with the design better
Get rid of the dead weight
Don't you have an appointment
Amy looks to her watch
Starts for her jacket and the door
Yes, yes
Thank-you
Evan here will print out the new specs - give them to Duncan - tell him 'll be back in two hours
(
) Amy
Duncan steps out of his office
She turns - virtually out the door
Just give me two hours
And she's gone
- few  smoking on the steps
Others entering, laden down with books - a small sea parting to allow Amy helping Virgil up the steps and inside
- They make their way down the hall - past a - room where a group of learn to read Braille
Amy can't help but stare at these young faces struggling to learn
It's a whole different world
'  - strange space, dark, as all the windows are covered
In a jar on the desk - two pickled eyeballs stare back at Virgil and Amy waiting patiently
There are books everywhere - periodicals stacked and overflowing on shelves
dead plant in the corner
- 60's, almost completely bald, wearing a worn sweatshirt, sits at the desk in front of them - flipping through a file in front of him
Right - , Virgil - says here you went blind at one - before you developed a visual vocabulary
(Webster stands - moves towards a bookshelf) You have no sense of depth of field, no knowledge of space, shape, size or distance
Basically your eyes work but your brain hasn't learned to process the information
(beat) You are mentallv blind
Neurologists call this "visual agnosia"
call it pretty screwed up
Better term
'll make a note of that
Webster plops down a large book - flips through some pages, then searching his pockets: Dammit What
Glasses, can never find 'em
(calling out) Mrs
Fenster
Mrs
Fenster pops her head in the door - this must be a ritual they have as she instantly pulls her  off and hands them to Webster who drops them over his nose
They are clearly woman's glasses - pointed in the ends - little jewels
As Mrs
Fenster leaves
(referring to the book) Alberto Valvo "Sight Restoration after Long Term Blindness" - blah-blah-blah
- ah here
(reading) "One must die as a blind person to be born again as a sighted person
However it is the interim, the limbo- -between two worlds, one dead/the other powerless to be born - that is so terrible
" (slamming the book shut) There
You're in limbo
What do you mean - there - he's in limbo
That's all you have to offer
What
- 'm Anne Bancroft all of a sudden
'm a professor -  teach people, how to teach the blind how to become independent
(beat) There's no book on what you're going through - 'd like to help - but like the rest of things in life - it's up to you
Wait a minute - up to me
thought you were going to help me here
Webster rummages in his desk - pulls out a magazine photo - then digging in a brown paper bag - he pulls out an apple
You want a lesson
Right - here
What's this
He holds out the apple for Virgil - who reluctantly takes it - holds it in his hand, eyes closed, feels it - then opening his eyes he holds it out in front of him, trying to focus on it
- as the apple slowly takes on dimension and shape
It's an apple
Good
Good
(holding up the photo) What's this now
Virgil stares at the photo
- a photo of -- an
Not that different from the real apple he holds in his hand - he holds the real apple up to compare - using his eyes
It's an apple
(holding the paper out to Virgil) Good
Good
But is it an apple or just a picture of an apple
And Virgil feels the paper and suddenly realizes - it's not an apple - just a representation of one
Virgil is visibly disappointed
So this is a joke
Is that what you're saying - your eyes lie to you
Great - looking forward to this
Your eyesight can and will play tricks on you Virgil
Remember that
No matter what could teach you - no matter what exercises could give you - they'll still play tricks on you
That's all it is right now - one big trick
Nothing makes any sense
can't function like this
(he moves to his chair) Virgil - look - you have to learn to see - just like you learned to speak
Only this is not like learning a new language - it's like learning language for the first time
(he leans forward) Perception - sight - life, is about experience - about reaching out and exploring the world for yourself
It's not enough to just see Virgil -- (he points two fingers into his eyes) -- we've got to look as well
And Webster turns the fingers from his eyes outward - to the world
(wound up) Well, thank-you Obi Wan Kenobi - but that doesn't tell us anything
What we need is some assistance here - some kind of program - a set of exercises - we're kind of adrift and
Amy - last  checked - this isn't a game of Parcheesi, it doesn't come with a set of rules
can't believe you're just
Amy
Let's go
No, wait, Virgil
Let's go
(standing) Thank-you Dr
Webster
You want me - 'm always here
And Virgil turns and half steps - half shuffles towards the door
We hold on Amy's befuddled face - then: - Virgil feels his way down the steps - Amy rushing out after him
'm going to call Aaron - get him to recommend someone else
He's right, Amy
've got to do this on my own
No one taught you how to see
Virgil starts walking stiffly towards the street
Amy hurries after him - grabs him just as he was about to step into traffic
was a baby then -  had years to learn - you don't - you need to
(anxious) --we don't even know what to do - where to start
Virgil's hand goes out - brushes a mailbox
What's this - this thing
Amy looks over
(shrugs) What - it's a mailbox
What color is it
Blue
Virgil stares at it - tries to take it in
Blue
, good - that's a mailbox - it's blue
There - we've started
She says nothing
Virgil senses her apprehension
Let's just get a cab, get you home - and tonight we can work on it
(hand out) Cab
cab veers across traffic - pulls up to them
want to walk
want to see what's out there
Fine
Let's walk
Don't you have a job
'm going to make time for this
promise
Go to work
If  need you - have your number
beat, she looks to Virgil then climbs into the cab and it pulls away
Virgil looks left, right - trying to decide where to start his journey when we see the cab back up in front of him and Amy climbs out
Screw work - let's go try those eyes
- Aaron at a podium
The room filled with colleagues records the lecture from the back of the hall
Now just two weeks after surgery--the patient is still having difficulty understanding images, shapes, contours - - Virgil - determined to see - making his way down a street - trying to dodge people coming at him from all angles
Amy walks a short distance behind him - coaxing him along
- people seem to explode out of two dimensions into three
This is clearly exhausting
(') - and his progress with depth of field has been especially slow
- Virgil collides with a kid on a skateboard - Amy winces as he quickly regains his balance - shakes it off - starts his journey again - determined
-   - Amy trying to help Virgil take in the confusion of images - explaining to him items hanging about the stalls
It's clear he's a little overwhelmed - when something familiar catches his eye
He moves toward it: - focusing - trying to give it shape - it's a   - just like the one Amy drove off in - again he focuses - reaches out - surprisingly wrapping his hand around the car
(') Virgil is still very reliant on his touch to interpret objects in his surroundings - He then realizes it's a porcelain toy from a souvenir shop
Amy watches him examine it like a child as we hear: - (') - and his understanding of three dimensionality is extremely limited and confounding to him
Virgil - his hands all over a small long haired
He looks to Amy as he stands
It's a dog
Amy on her cellphone - trying to get work done - nods - yes that's a dog
Virgil looks back at the pup - which has now turned around backwards
Now what's that
On Amy - disturbed by his slow progress
- Amy and Virgil being led through a series of plants and trees by a believe we have just the tree you're looking for your lobby
Needs very little light - slow growing - ah here we are
Amy and Virgil stop at a large Ficus Tree
Nice
Good
What do you think Virgil
(') He is also still having great difficulty "scanning", basically putting a whole picture together
Virgil stares at the large tree
Up - down - up - down - up - down - up - down - Amy and the Saleswoman watch him, Amy wants to help but can't comprehend what he's going through
(') If he looks at the top of a tree - then scans to the bottom - he's forgotten the top by the time he reaches the trunk
'  - Virgil in Amy's office - staring at a construction sign - etc
Using his finger to outline the letters of the sign - he tries to read the word
He mouths the letters - tries to form the word
(') This includes the ability to read
In reading a word - he forgets the first letter by the time he gets to the last
Amy working with a draftsman - glances up to see Virgil struggling with reading
-   - Bathed in a bank of lights, Aaron at the podium continuing
Virgil quiet - is seated behind him
(') -- meaning
he has a total lack of visual memory
This is an unexpected physiological flaw
We are hopeful Virgil can overcome this
(beat) Thank-you - that's all for today
- Virgil and Amy exit the hall, are immediately surrounded by and
There's a sudden
Virgil reacts, pulling away
What's that
camera - it's  - taking your - picture
What, by flashing me in the face
- there's another - Amy tries to block the light
Please
- It's not good for him
Suddenly - there's a mike in his face, as   reporter from Channel 2 news steps forward with   in tow
Mr
Anderson
Christie Evans Eyewitness news
We heard the Doctor speak about your progress - and we're wondering what your expectations are
As Virgil stops - stunned by the lights in his face
As he looks to Amy we cut to: - - Virgil turns to camera - starts talking to the reporter
As we pull back we hear less and less as we reveal a modest living room
doing homework on a table in the corner and a  - early 60's, rugged - sitting on a couch watching the news
Oh my God
He leans forward - his interest piqued and he picks up the phone
Information
Pinecrest
For a Jennie Anderson
-   - silver fork held up in front of us
What's this
Virgil and Amy sit on the patio of La Mela
Virgil's hand goes out for the fork
Amy pulls it away
Uh uh uh
See it first
No cheating
Concentrate
Virgil stares hard at it
(guessing) pen
don't know - let me touch it
She hands it to him
fork
Right
Now put it down in front of you
How far is it from
Twenty feet You're not looking
Dammit, Amy, Amy,  spent all day in front of that panel feeling like a guinea pig
Every time  open my eyes  have to look
Can we just sit and have dinner for once
Amy just stares
It's clear they're both tired
'm just trying to help you see
know
But that's all it seems we're about
How was your day - what goes on at work - how about those Rangers - did the stock market hold today - is there anything else going on in our world besides my eyes
(beat) , we've been invited to a party - Duncan's birthday
An   appears - putting a large plate of spaghetti in front of Virgil and Amy
Virgil is a little repulsed by what he sees
What's this - looks like worms
It's spaghetti - it's fine
As Virgil tries to maneuver his fork - Amy reaches behind her
brought you a present - good for hand eye coordination
She hands him a    bag
He peers inside
Great - you go to work building buildings -  go home with building blocks
- - Amy - looking a little worn - staring blankly at her computer three dimensional rendition of the mall rotates on the screen
Duncan pokes his head in
'm here for you to wish me happy birthday
How's it going
(distracted) He's progressing, slowly - doing the best he can
was actually wondering about the mall designs
We're expected in Atlanta tomorrow - with these plans
can't go to Atlanta tomorrow - not with Virgil's problems,
Ok, ok (Duncan moves in behind her) 'm sorry
Things aren't going so well
(stares at her work) He seems blinder now than he ever was
Duncan puts his hands on her shoulders - starts to knead them
Amy starts to relax
Do you ever wonder why you do the things you do
Didn't get what you expected did you
Sometimes  think he's not going to make it - that he's never going to be able to see
Amy - listen to me
You liked this guy -  saw that
You wanted to help him - it didn't work out so hot
You can't punish yourself
Sometimes things just don't work out the way we want them to - look at us
Amy smiles warmly
Yeah
Thanks Duncan
Anytime
(beat, a joke) Now back to work
As he starts out of the room, Amy turns stops him
Hey, Happy Birthday
'  - Virgil sits at the kitchen table staring at everyday kitchen utensils - being held by Ethan
Measuring cup
Ethan shakes his head - no - it's a cheese grater
Virgil stares again
Ethan mimes grating cheese
Cheese grater
Yes - my man
Ethan holds up something new - one of those strange spaghetti strainers
Now they are both staring at something they don't understand
Virgil looks to Ethan
Got me
(laughing) You're no help
How am  supposed to do my homework if
Homework - dude - ain't doin' homework
Virgil continues to look at the strainer as Ethan gravitates towards his cane folded up on the table
(beat) You're lucky you got a cane
Virgil looks over - sees his fascination
You want it
've been thinking about throwing it out
Ethan's up in a flash
Man - really -  can have it
Cool
(picking it up) could be a Ninja Darth Vader fighter with one of these - protect my mom from the evil super
Virgil is up - with the spaghetti strainer in his hand
But first you'll have to fight off the evil --- whatever this is
As they joust about - Virgil enjoying himself - there's a knock at the door
Could be the super - go for cover
As Ethan ducks behind the couch, Virgil makes his way to the door, fumbling with the handle - he opens it to: Virgil stares at her
We soon realize he has no idea who this is
Yes
Jenny looks at him, her eyes welling
Virgil - it's me
And suddenly Ethan is there - cane drawn like a sword
En garde
Jennie startled - looks to Ethan then Virgil
What's going on
Jennie
Jennie
God, 'm sorry - c'mon in - this is my friend Ethan - what are you doing here
Off Jennie's look: - Virgil and Jennie standing across the street from a building being torn down
Hard hatted  hover about the large trucks at work
You want to tell me what we're doing here
Jennie points
That's him
That's our Father
Virgil looks in the direction she's pointing - tries to focus on a figure moving across the lot
The  we saw watching
can't -  can't see him
Jennie looks to him
thought your eyes were better
No
-  don't want to see him
My eyes aren't good enough - not yet - he won't understand
It won't be enough
Virgil takes a step back
He's our father
He heard about the operation and he's asked to see you
Look here he comes
Jennie -  don't want to see him -  don't even know why you brought me here
And Virgil takes another step back then turns and starts of f down the street leaving Jenny alone
'  - Amy making her way up the stairs - roll of plans under her arm
Opening her door to: '  - totally dark room
She drops her things
Virgil
Virgil
She flicks on the light - to reveal Virgil has been sitting in the dark
She looks over - sees the scattered blocks on the floor
'm here
forget about the lights sometimes
Look - about this party tonight - it's no big deal - maybe we should just
It's your partner's birthday
We should go - besides you wanted me to meet your friends, right
Yeah
Right
- Noisy, crowded -  mill about carrying drinks - black and silver balloons float about the ceiling
Moving through the crowd - music blasting - Amy introducing people to Virgil over the noise
walks up to them holding a tray of wine
Glass of wine
Red - white
Amy reaches out - takes one
Which is the red
Amy looks at the waiter - then points to one
Virgil's hand reaches out slowly - hovering - it's clear it's confusing - trying to separate out one glass
The Waiter looks to Amy like "is he
" Virgil - here let me
Her hand darts in front of his
(quick) No
Sorry -  mean - 'm almost there -  think  got it
And she backs off as his hand wraps around a glass - pulling it back
At the last second knocking over two other glasses
Dammit
Sorry
The Waiter - trying not to spill on himself
Trust me - you're not the first - or probably the last
Let me get a cloth
Thanks The Waiter smiles - and as he walks off
Virgil nervously takes a large drink of wine
hope you're driving
Suddenly from the front of the room - , the host calls out: He's coming up the stairs
Everybody get ready - kill the lights
Excitement - a buzz - Virgil looks around then  - all the lights go out
Virgil panics momentarily
What - what's happening
Amy moves to him in the near dark room
It's for the surprise - they turned off the lights
Surprise - yeah
And suddenly the lights flood back on, everyone screams:
Duncan - at the door with Betsy - genuinely surprised - catches his breath - then fakes a quick heart attack and drops to the floor
The room explodes in laughter - Amy included
This action is even more confusing to Virgil
Is he
Hearing this - everyone breaks into bigger laughter - Virgil now the focus of attention - good naturedly laughs - Amy smiles, embarrassed
Virgil takes a gulp of his wine, finishing it off
: The Music is cranked
Many couples dance
Virgil exits the bathroom - glances back in the mirror again, at his hair - not sure he likes its style
He tries brushing it to the other side - it's
How about the other way - not so bad - maybe
It's clear he's a little tipsy as he keeps playing with his hair
(
) Here ya go Virgil
Virgil turns - the Waiter stands there holding a glass of wine - placing it carefully into Virgil's hand: Cheers, Kevin
(
) (over the noise) Virgil
Virgil embarrassed, turns - can faintly hear Amy's voice over the music
Searches the room - bopping bodies - balloons being bashed round - lights dim
The number of drinks he's had isn't helping
Virgil--over here
Amy, standing with Duncan and Betsy
Maybe he's blind again
Don't even think it
'mon -  want the both of you to meet him - he'll never find us here
With  - smiling as he sees Amy, Duncan and Betsy move towards him
Virgil - 'm sorry -  went to get Duncan
Duncan - Virgil
And this is Betsy
Hey Virgil good to meet you
Heard a lot about you
Heyyy
Yeah
Good to meet you
Virgil thrusts his hand out - colliding it into Duncan's
Sorry - things still get a little cockeyed sometimes
(holding up his drink) Few more of these and 'll be the same
Lemme get Kevin - my man - he'll top you up
-
Virgil
What
Uncomfortable - everyone stops
Nothing
It's ok
Amy, in Atlanta tomorrow
Duncan -  told you
spoke to Falk and he
(can't hear) What
Duncan pulls Amy in close to talk - shutting Virgil and Betsy out
Amy said you had great hands
(laughs) She did, did she
Virgil holds them up in front of his face - tries to see them
Then looks past them and watches Amy and Duncan - more importantly looks at Duncan's hair, his clothes
It's clear he's becoming aware of appearances
His own especially
As they break their tete a tete
You know my father was blind for several years, he had cataracts as well
Somehow this comes out patronizing
Really
'm surprised  don't know him
It's a club you know
Kevin, the African American waiter comes up
Yes
Virgil throws his arm around Kevin
Kevin - Duncan here the birthday man - could use himself a drink
Kevin here tells me he's black - did you know that -  mean look at him - look at me - isn't that the damnedest thing
He's black
Amy is mortified, Kevin laughs
'll get you a drink
Virgil looks to Amy
What's that look
What look
've never seen your face that way before
It's
weird
What does it mean
Before she can answer - a dance song breaks out - Betsy wraps her arm around Duncan's
Come on Duncan - let's dance - move those old bones
Duncan only acknowledges Betsy's contact with a raised eyebrow to Amy
What the hell it's my birthday -- nice to meet you Virgil - see you at the opening
And they're gone onto the floor
Virgil watches him - sees the ease with which Duncan moves, handles things
Opening
The lobby we designed
Virgil - you can't
Let's dance
Virgil takes her arm and pulls her out on the floor
Amy - ready for one of Virgil's wild dances takes hold of his hand
The music blaring, Virgil starts to get into it - Amy starting to relax - then Virgil slowly notices how everyone else is dancing - more conservative
He's even getting some looks from people
Slowly he winds down - tries to mimic what everyone else is doing - ends up in just a slow shuffle
Amy watches him - sees he's uncomfortable - moves to him - but Virgil turns on his heel and strides away
Amy follows after him
-  - Virgil stands near the glass doors leading to an outdoor balcony
Amy comes up to him - finds Virgil facing a wall - eyes shut
What are you doing
Virgil's head cocks slightly towards her - just like when he was blind
feel like Rip Van Winkle
've woken up from a thirty year sleep - and the world's passed me by
It's just dancing
Who cares
Virgil whirls on her - his hand on her shoulder to steady his look at her
No-no-no-no
It's not the Goddamn dancing
wanted to come here tonight - show you could "fit" in
Like the big boys do
Big seeing boys
Yes
Well,  don't
Don't
It's just going to take time
You weren't ready
We shouldn't have come
No -  - me, shouldn't have come
You want me to see - but you know what - you know what - shit -  don't belong in the wonderful world of seeing
Amy reaches out to him
Virgil
look
Amy realizes what she just said - Virgil pulls his arm away
No,  won't
'm tired of looking
Fuck looking and the horse it came in on
And he spins to get away from her and takes a step crashing right into the sliding glass door which explodes in a shower of little crystals
The party slams to a halt - Amy stands stunned
Virgil shaken - tiny cuts on his face
Oh my God, are you alright
Virgil slams his eyes shut
Yeah, 'm just fine
Take me home
'  - Virgil, small nicks on his face, wakes up - rolls over - feels the empty bed beside him
Looks up to see Amy pulling her coat on - suitcase at her side
Didn't want to wake you
You're going
'll only be a couple of days
This isn't working
What - we're not working - your eyes - what's not working
get up every morning -  look in the mirror - and  stare at a total stranger
stare and stare - and no matter how hard  look - don't see Virgil there anywhere
And the more look at you
What
You don't see me
saw you better when  was blind
Well, you're not blind any more
'm sorry if that disappoints you
(beat) 've got a plane to catch
'm going to go before we say things we don't mean
And she grabs her bag and is out the door
As we hold on Virgil's face
- Virgil looking out - watching Amy get in the cab
As she drives away we see Virgil watch the car recede - then his hand goes out
- his hand grasping at the tiny disappearing cab - trying to hold onto it like in Times Square - trying not to let it go
- - Amy's sketches
The Mall has been integrated into the two large trees - giving it shelter and shape
(
) love it
Amy and Duncan sit across from Falk, a man in his 40's - earned everything he's got - no bullshit kinda guy
But we already cut those trees down
- Kids milling about
young couple neck unabashedly against a wall
We see this is Virgil's  - he's watching - people together
- Virgil makes his way down the hall
Stops at an open doorway - a sign next to it with raised letters in Braille
As his hand feels across it - he also reads the visual letters - Dr
Ray Webster
Peering inside - he sees a Lab - full of the   - some - a couple of  - a handful of   - all learning to use a cane
The rapid tapping of their cane like a room full of typewriters
Virgil watches - the Blind working their way around a small obstacle course - many of them running into desks, tables - it's tough, frustrating work
Suddenly Virgil feels someone next to him
Webster
You want to join us
Virgil watches the blind
No - no - 'll wait for you out here - when you're done
As Virgil moves off to a hallway bench: Virgil Virgil turns as Webster tosses his something
Virgil misses it - it hits the ground - he reaches down - finding it, he picks it up - it's an apple
He looks to Webster who smiles back at him
'll be done in a minute
-  - Amy and Duncan walk through the lobby to their rooms
little combo plays music in the adjacent bar - a few people on the tiny dance floor
You'd think he would have told us
mean those trees were in the photos
We'll just have to win him over tomorrow
Let me buy you a drink - get those creative juices going
(looks at her watch) Aw - no -  really
But Duncan has her by the arm - and in one spin has her in a dance embrace
This move seems comfortable, familiar to them both
'mon - listen, they're playing our song
(laughs) Mack the Knife was our song
'  - Webster is cleaning up after class
Virgil watching some of the Teenage kids and Adults find their way out of the room
As the last of them leaves
- 'm just about done here -  got a place for you - relax those eyes a bit
- table front and center
Some empty beer glasses in front of them
Two full ones in their hands - they're both a little in their cups
grinds and weaves her way about the small dance floor to the sounds of Talking Heads "Burning down the House"
(eyeing the girl) You want to know the truth -- God's honest truth
Seeing's been the shits
You got to be kidding me son
You can say that - sitting here in these prime viewing seats
Forget fixing your eyes - we're going to get your head examined
'm serious
was better off blind
People don't have these expectations of you you can't live up to
You're blind - fine - they deal with it
Didn't get what you expected did you
When  was blind -  had an image of what everything was, up here
(points to his head) now - it's all different - not at all what 'd expected - not what 'd hoped for
Virgil, let me explain something here
When you were blind - you dealt with things one at a time - sequentially right
wall led to a door to a tree to a car
That's how you got to what you wanted - right
(beat) Seeing people - for better or worse - deal with everything all at once - taking in the whole picture - which sometimes confuses the hell out of what they want
(beat) Virgil, my advice after three beers - don't be afraid to take in the whole picture - just don't lose sight of what you want
What  want is to make it work with Amy
And what does she have to say She just wants me to see
It's that important is it
You know what  learned a long time ago
Seeing girls like seeing guys
(beat) 'm not going to let her down
-  102 Amy and Duncan are dancing - they seem good together
Nothing fancy - but they move as one about the floor
See - not so bad
Not so bad
It's nice to dance together again
Yeah
You remember
First time we danced - Connecticut
We watched the leaves turn - so much to see - 'd love to go back
So would
(beat) What happened to us Amy
You're so intent on fixing everything - why'd you give up on us
learned some things can't be fixed
We got married for all the wrong reasons
don't think  fell in love with you as much as  fell in love with architecture
(serious) never fell in love with architecture - but  know  fell in love with you
Now - that's bullshit
It used to work
They smile at each other - everything's easy right now - pause - they dance - Amy looks up at Duncan - who hesitates - then leans in and kisses her
moment and Amy pulls away slightly - looks down for a second - then she leans back in and they kiss again
We hold on this kiss, then cut to: - - we hear movement - then a light comes on in the bathroom
Amy stands there clutching her clothes - staring into the mirror
In the background we see Duncan curled up asleep in bed
Amy stares at herself long and hard
(whisper) Oh, God
And she starts to dress: Amy
- what's going on - what time is it
Click - he flicks the bedside lamp on - squinting - finds Amy
She doesn't talk - keeps dressing
What's wrong
What's wrong
This was' a mistake - a big mistake
Go back to sleep - you've got an important meeting tomorrow
've got
- hold on here - you're not bailing out on me -  need you
(flat) For the meeting
Of course for the meeting
Dressed, she moves toward the doorway - Duncan sits up in bed
'm going home
To be a babysitter
She stops at the door
Can't we for once be adults - face the fact that we've just made a colossal error
Fine - this was stupid, there - happy
- but goddamit Amy -  still care about you
Where do you actuallv think any of this is going to lead with this guy
don't know - but the one good thing to come of this mess tonight -  know  want to find out
And she's gone -
'  - cab pulls up - Amy gets out - looks up at her loft - it's dark
'  - Kitchen light on - a pile of Ethan's blocks on the table
Amy makes her way over to see it reads: '  - Amy opens the door and sees Virgil leaning against the parapet wall, staring out at the night Manhattan skyline
After a moment, he walks back to the other end of the roof, turns and slowly walk - toward the parapet wall again - all the time staring at the skyline - with a smile and look of amazement on his face
Hi Virgil turns - finds her
Hey
Amy starts toward Virgil
Whatcha doing
It's the craziest thing
You start back over there - focus on a building
And when you walk towards it - it changes - each step makes it look different
started out just looking for the horizon
You can't see it from here - too many buildings
But it's still there - even though you can't see it - right
You gotta have faith it's there
Things exist beyond what  can see - just have to take it on faith
She comes up next to him - Virgil, looking out over the wall turns to her - studies her face: You have so many looks
There's something  have to tell you
was getting confused - which is no excuse for how 've acted, but
Wait - no - this isn't your fault - 'm the one's been a shit
You're too hard on yourself - expect too much of yourself
Virgil
(stopping her) Let me say this
Every day of my life - 've wished for just one thing
To see
To be whole
For just one month
For just one day or one minute
For one goddamned half a second
And not just to be able to run, or ride a bike, or drive a car
(beat) But for once not to have a bruise from bumping into something or to stand in a room and have to ask "is anyone here" and here that dead silence, knowing someone is there
Not to have food on my sweater, or have to put my finger in my glass to know when it's full
just want to be whole
(beat) went to see my father the other day
Amy moves toward him
couldn't face him
felt like was letting him down
feel like 'm letting you down
No
No, listen
gave up years ago - 'm not going to give up now
Amy - that day  met you - for the first time in my life  felt someone needed me as much as  needed them
don't want you to give up on me
Amy out of breath - feels a surge of love for this man - moves in kissing him
long kiss - then: Besides  couldn't leave you - owe too much in back rent
And as Amy pulls him into embrace - we hold on her face - then: - - Dr
Aaron - harsh lights washing him out
Up until the operation five weeks ago - Virgil had been a touch person - someone who's vocabulary, whole sensibility, his picture of the world was based on tactile -- non-visual terms
- - 50's Jack LaLaine type - is giving Virgil the tour of the facilities
They enter the weight/workout room
Various shapes and sizes of people work out on various shapes and sizes of workout machines
Aaron's voice-over continues as Jack motions to Virgil to follow him
Virgil hesitates
- chrome, iron, plastic - but somehow it's more defined than we've seen before
Determined - Virgil starts his way into the gym - hand' out brushing by what he sees in front of him
(') But - now - as a sighted person - by focusing singlemindedly on his goal, Virgil has a new found ability to understand his own physical relationship to objects in his life around him
Virgil now drops his hand - starts moving through the maze of people and equipment - actually "seeing" his way
(') Distance, size, shape - perspective - now all have profound meaning to him
- Virgil negotiating a glass door - exiting the building
(') and though there are still miles to go in his learning process - for all medical intents and purposes - he is becoming a seeing person
Virgil walking down the street - deftly dodging a kid on a skateboard - throwing out his hand to hail a cab
(') This is an extraordinary achievement and advancement for medical science and a tribute to Virgil's determination to see
- (') Ladies and Gentlemen - Virgil Anderson
Applause and Virgil looking to Amy in the audience, stands - a seeing man - and easily makes his way to the podium
Standing in the lights he readjusts the microphone - moving it up from the much shorter Aaron
(clears his throat) Since this may be one of our last sessions - are there any questions
Mr
Anderson - is there something you were surprised to see for the first time - something that looked quite different than you thought
Breasts
(laughter) No, really
Don't get me wrong -  love them - they just weren't what  expected
What about your girlfriend
Whose did you think  was talking about
Laughs
Now that you're fully seeing - what are you looking forward to most
Not having to do these sessions
(laugh) No - actually - being independent
Can you read yet
No, but
Will you ever be able to
don't know
If you can't read - will you ever be able to drive
(suddenly somber) don't know
Well how can you say
(interrupting) Virgil
After so many years of darkness - describe what it is to actually see
Angle on the Voice in the dark
Webster
- Virgil - as he thinks about the question
- - '  - - the Atlanta project
Miniature size
And a set of plans laid out across Amy's desk
Virgil's hand comes into frame - touches the model - moves to the plans - touches them
- alone in Amy's office - looking at her work
We go to his face - his eyes - we see that he is seeing Amy's work
(
) You're here
Virgil looks up - Amy at the doorway
The Atlanta project -  thought it went away
Duncan did some song and dance - Falk's coming to the lobby opening tomorrow - see our work
see it Amy
What's that
Your world
What you do
The plans - the work the ideas
The molding
For the first time  really see what you do - and not just up here
(he points to his head) but in here
Virgil's hand goes out to her chest - places it on her heart
(moves in close, sexy) Tonight is your night something special  want to show you What is it
: - (
0
) Everything
The sun starting to set - the whole of the five burroughs of New York laid out in front of us
Virgil moves to the edge - looks out over this amazing panorama
Amy moves up next to Virgil - they take it in a moment
That's the Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State Building, Chrysler building just over there
Amy, look at me
What
This face - this is everything
It's all 've ever wanted to see
(he watches her) You have so many looks
What do all those looks mean
Well
Let's see
This
(makes corresponding face) is sad
This
is frustrated
This
is tired
This
is confused
This
is happy
And this
(her face softens) is what in love looks like
Virgil puts his hand on her face - looks at it carefully
This look - this look  love
Amy leans forward and kisses him - and he soon forgets it even happened
As they kiss we pull slowly back and away as the sun goes deep gold and we start to hear what sounds like rain: We cut to: '  - And they are still kissing - and we realize they are in the shower - together - kissing - exploring - very sensual
As Virgil moves to kiss her neck - her breasts - Amy's head tilts back in to the spray
Virgil - it's raining
And he moves up again - looks her in the eyes - and for a moment his eyesight shudders ever so slight1y - it goes away and they kiss again
'  - Amy and Virgil on the street - each hailing separate cabs
So - eight o'clock tonight
Eight o'clock - building opening - haven't forgotten
She blows him a kiss and she's gone
Virgil watches her cab pull away - clear something is bothering him
- his vision going in and out
Then clear, then clouded again
- Virgil's massage room
Not as organized as he had at Bear Mtn
Virgil is working on an   - his back is splotchy from too much sun
Virgil massaging - becomes preoccupied with his skin's imperfections - losing his concentration
Hey, Virgil - 'm the one supposed to fall asleep here
Yes - sorry
He closes his eyes - gets back into his rhythm
- Virgil, pack over his shoulder leaving for the day - about to cut through the weight room - when it suddenly comes to a halt
His  - his vision fading in and out - and then suddenly quick flashes of black
On the final : We smash to: - Virgil at the desk
The Nurse looks up
Daphne -  need to see Dr
Aaron - right away
It's an emergency
-   - Dr
Aaron is again examining Virgil on the Electroretinogram
Done, Aaron pulls the machine out of the way
Looks at Virgil - rubs his hand across his face
What does that mean
What
What you just did
Virgil imitates him
It means - the machine is only registering sparks of activity - retinal sparks - followed by nothing
How long has this been going on
don't know - first  thought  was tired - some blurs - occasional cloudiness but it's been getting worse
Today 'm getting complete blackouts
Your retinal function is down ten percent
'm afraid - your retinal disease seems to have returned
You're afraid
What does that mean - thought you corrected it
You told me was a 'seeing person'
Now, you've every right to be upset
Maybe you didn't have the blood vessels to supply enough oxygen to the retinas
- Possibly some trauma - there are so many variables
(beat) to be honest,  don't know
wish to God  did
Virgil stands, anxious - starts pacing
You're the expert
Tell me - what do we do now - how do we repair this
Virgil
--  wish there was a nice way to say this
Virgil backs away - doesn't want to hear it
No - there is no nice way to say it is there
No nice way to let the man know it's all over - that
he's going blind again
Virgil,  understand what
No you don't
Don't ever say that
You'll never understand
Ever
Aaron stands there - says nothing - tries to let Virgil's anger dissipate
long moment
How long
Hard to say
Month - few weeks - (beat) Days
Virgil stands there stunned - then looking to Aaron
God, what do  tell Amy
What do  tell her
On Virgil's face
- Virgil steps into the hall - Sees: - blind - eyes half shut - hands reaching out, plodding it' a half circle over to where his mother waits for him
And we see the realization on Virgil's face of seeing his past - and what he will return to: - Virgil , , best he can - through the crowded street - hands out - bumping into people - desperate - scared - trying to run from himself - from his fate
- he comes to a stop - out of breath - he looks left - right - where do you go - then sees something off screen
His face torn with fear - he moves forward - hand out - reaching to a window - to his own
And we push slowly in on the reflection as he touches the window - his hand on his face - a face he may never see again - and a cloud passes overhead and his reflection is gone
- Virgil stands at the site - amidst the rubble and mud
His Father walks slowly over to him - raising his arms to embrace him
Virgil takes a step back - not, ready - his father stops, understands - looks his son up and down
You look good
Hey - how do  look
need some answers
Why'd you leave
Because 'm blind - or because  quit trying to see
To the point -  like that - something you got from me
Cut the bullshit - "dad"
don't hear from you for over twenty years - then you find out  can see and all of a sudden you show up
(looks around) Hey
Virge - can we talk about this later, huh
No, not later
Now
Was my blindness so wrong that made you tear our family apart
Virgil's riled his father
He steps towards Virgil tries to speak under his breath
Every morning  woke up and looked at you and saw my own failures
If  couldn't get my own son to see then
What difference does any of this make - you can see now - hell,  knew you could
Virgil watches his father - this stranger
His eyes start to well
'm going blind again
His Father looks at him - stunned
He reels from the news - takes a step back
No
The doctor told me today
You're the first person 've told
wanted to come see you before it was completely gone
(speechless) beat and Virgil's father takes another step back, then turns and walks away - forever
- Virgil standing across the street
Trying to take in the building - Standing at the front as a security guard opens the door
Sorry the building doesn't open until tonight
know
'm Virgil Anderson
with Roswell Tremont
We did the lobby
'm here to check some details for tonight
Oh, okay, sure Mr
Anderson
- The lobby is pretty, straightforward
Open - a few plants - a large central check in desk
Simple - unobtrusive - nothing exceptional or unique
Virgil moves his way about the lobby - looking at it carefully from every possible angle - his hand grazing across walls, entranceways - desperately committing as much as he can to memory - finally ending up in the middle of the room in a final attempt to absorb as much as he can
(
) You want to see that the thing work
Thing
What thing
This thing The Guard reaches over - hits a switch - and against one section of windows a wall of water comes dripping down - causing a shower of indoor rain - the sound instantly echoing off of the walls
Virgil smiles - moves toward it - closing his eyes - listening to the indoor rain - really taking in the room having total empathy with what Amy has created
'  - Virgil, wrapped in a towel, is shaving
But he has his eyes closed
Amy comes in, dressed beautifully - using the mirror to put her earrings in
Virgil quickly opens his eyes
You nervous
No - not a bit
What do you think
She pivots for him
You look great
Really
Not too flashy
(she looks in the mirror, she is nervous) 'm going to change
Virgil lets her go - calls to her
This is an important night for you
But you know what's most important
(she pokes her head in) That you're going to be there to see it
Virgil turns to the mirror, stares at himself - contemplating what he's up against
- The lobby is filled with business types, waiters circulating with champagne, tiny hors-d'oeuvres
Virgil and Amy enter - standing at the top of the stairs leading to the party
Virgil immediately going into a performance for Amy
So
Amy, it's good - very good
'm proud of you
love the detail - planted pots in the corners, the moldings
(beat) It's got genuine lines
(excited) Look around - do you see it
What
He looks about the room - then turns towards the indoor rain
- clear - then slight haziness - a momentary flash of black - then back in focus
He turns to Amy
Puts his arm around her
Our rain
Your rain
Hey Virgil
He extends his hand
Virgil, obliged slowly extends his - having trouble focusing - but Duncan helps him - taking hold of it and shaking it
Still working on that hand shake you'll get it don't worry
Congratulations - the place looks great
Thanks - here's the genius though - just get the gigs
Can  steal her away Falks' over there and  can't tell if he's impressed with our work or just has gas from the pate
Go - do your thing
'll be right back
There's food and drinks down on the floor
Duncan and Amy start down the stairs as Virgil tries to find a safe place to stand
His eyesight fading in and out - he looks around - decides to negotiate the steps: He takes one step on the stairs - looks down - is able to see Amy with Falk and Duncan, looking up at him - she smiles - he does his best - smiles back - lets go of the handrail - takes another step - finally reaching the bottom floor
He stands there for a long moment - lost as to where to move glimpse towards the rain sculpture and he starts towards it using the sound to help guide him
Amy looks over - sees Virgil moving across the floor - gives him a little wave - he doesn't notice her
At the rain Virgil stands taking in the sound
comes up next to him
Quite a party
Love the detail of the building
Sometimes the detail doesn't matter
Virgil stops - turns to Webster
Ray
What are you doing here
Aaron called me
He was worried
've been trying to find you - Amy's office told me you were here
It's bad
It's almost gone
Last few days have been pretty bad
Obviously Amy doesn't know
It's going to break her heart
This is her big night -  didn't want to ruin it
Thought  could pull it off
(beat) You can't avoid this forever
Virgil turns back towards the rain
know (beat) So Ray
Is it better to have seen and lost than never to have seen at all
thought it was loved and lost
Amy comes up to them
Dr
Webster - this is a surprise
Virgil invited me - wanted to show you off  think
The place is terrific - he's got every right to be proud
Thank-you
need Virgil for a moment - schmoozing time
Shmooze away
(as he's led away) Thanks Ray
'll call you
- Duncan standing anxiously with Falk and his wife Donna as they arrive
Virgil - 'd like you to meet Jack Falk and his wife Donna up from Atlanta
Pleased to meet you
Amy tells us you were blind
Amy spurts out a glass of wine
Virgil deflects the comment
That's  - nice to see someone so honest
Amy tells us you're her inspiration
Any help you can give us with our project
'm a little biased but  kind of liked Amy's original design
But could we do better
Amy jumps in with
We could do better, Mr
Falk - a lot better
Good,  like that attitude
Let's keep trying for perfection
Everyone smiles - Amy wraps her arm around Virgil
That's right - that's why 've got Virgil
Pleasant laughter all around - and as Amy and the others continue - we push in on Virgil as he takes in this thought
- Virgil and Amy out front
People leaving - Duncan getting into a town car with Falk and his wife - he looks back - gives the thumbs up and climbs in after them
The car pulls away into the night
You wanna walk -  feel like some air
See what we see
Sure
Can  take your arm - eyes a little tired
As they walk
You really made the place come alive with that fountain
Thank-you
(beat) You know 've been thinking - you're doing so great now - and if we get this new design job we'd have some extra money -  think we should go on a big seeing celebration
(taken aback) seeing celebration
Yeah, maybe in a couple of months
looked into Egypt - we could see the pyramids - we could see it together for the first time
What do you say
You know - there is something 'd like to see
Of course, anything
The Rangers play tomorrow
Season'll be over before we know it - could be our last chance
The Rangers
Sure, why not
Then a tiny pinpoint of light ahead - one that grows increasingly larger as we move towards a
hum that grows in intensity until the light fills the frame and  - we exit the tunnel and we are: - That glorious first view - people - the white ice shining below like a giant jewel- and the players - in bright colors scurrying about the playing surface below
This is amazing - isn't it
She looks to Virgil who is awed by what he is seeing
Then suddenly on his face - a flash - one of those moments of darkness
Should we find our seats
Looks like the game's already started
Yeah -  - 'll follow you
-  - Virgil and Amy in the loge seats - on the aisle - up behind the goal
Amy looking at the stadium while Virgil next to her, watches the game best he can
love the stadium the way it's structure
Amy - the game
Right - the game
- a hard check into the boards deep in the Rangers end of the ice
The puck squirts out Gretzky picks it up - fires it across ice - one, two it's back to him and he has a wide open break from center ice - the crowd is out of their seats - Virgil included - Amy quickly getting caught up in the enthusiasm
On Virgil's face - watching Gretzky skate towards him - excited - then losing him - another flash of blackness - like a blow to the head - and we hear the crowd suddenly explode - and as Virgil's vision regains we see the players mobbing Wayne after his goal - the little red light behind the net the only evidence of it happening
We see the frustration as Virgil realizes he'll never see it
He scored, he scored - you see that - it was amazing
As the players make their way to center ice - the crowd sits and Amy sees the expression again on his face
What
That was good right
Yeah - it was great -  was just
Suddenly Virgil becomes transfixed
Walking down the aisle, away from him: - carrying a tray of
Virgil stares at it a moment - transfixed - then like in a trance - he stands - stepping out into the aisle - a man on a mission
Virgil, where are you going
And he's on the stairs - carefully moving down the stairs toward the vendor
Then she sees the Vendor - handing Virgil a large cotton candy - round and puffy like a cloud - but something he can hold in his hand
Amy can't believe it - watching Virgil - his fascination at finding this long lost memory
The puffy thing
Angle on Virgil turning - admiring his prize - then looking up, trying to find Amy - who waves to him excited
- scanning the crowd - it's hazy - then flashes of dark
Amy's face - suddenly drops - it's clear, even though she is only four rows up - he doesn't see her
- Game is over - Virgil is packing up his stuff - Amy staring
at him
Virgil, what's happening
Just having a bad eye day
lot to take in
Tell me
What's going on
Nothing
see almost nothing
Amy: she feels like she's about to explode
Oh God
It's
It's  for you to cry
(recovering) No, no - 'm not going to cry
Solve the problem
We made it through one operation - we'll make it through another
We won't give up
We'll get this right - we just need to
saw Dr
Aaron
There's nothing they can do
Then we'll find another Doctor
There's got to be someone else
We'll find something that works
Don't you get it - can't go through this again
So just like that - we just forget it - give up
Why the hell haven't you told me what was going on
(whirls on her) Because of this
What this
You
Not letting it go - thinking there's a solution
Goddamit, 'm not design flaw in your fucking work that you can just change to make work Or throw away because it doesn't meet your expectations
(beat) Let's face it - it's over
Virgil, give it time, you'll see
No
won't
This conversation is ended
'  - The door swings open - Amy and Virgil enter - Virgil moves towards the bed - pulls out his duffel bag
What are you doing
'm leaving
What do you mean leaving - you're leaving this apartment - you're leaving New York - you're leaving me
Virgil turns - they stand across the room from each other - miles apart
'm going home
Amy walks toward him, picking a battle, rejection
So you're big sister can take care of you - feed you  dinners for of your life
Virgil tries to side step her
'm not going to go through this bullshit again
Amy moves in front - confronting him Is that what this has all been to you - bullshit
Yes
Who the hell were we fooling
'm blind - 'm not meant to see -  don't belong here
God damn right you're blind
You want to live in your own little world - this perfect world that your sister built for you - where no one can touch you
where no one can reach you
Do you know the reason why  remembered the cotton candy all those years
Because  went to the game with my father
And it's the only good thing  can remember about him
The rest is him pushing me to be something 'm not - then turning his back on me the minute his plans fail
am not turning my back on you
You want me to give up on you - you love the self pity
don't want you to give up on
But you won't give up on me seeing
Because there must be other options
Not anymore
Virgil, avoiding her, sidesteps quickly past her - straight into the lamp, which crashes to the ground and breaks
Dammit
short few steps then a much larger crash - the sound of a large heavier thing breaking
Virgil
Amy feels her way to the lights - and turns them on
We see that Virgil has collided with Amy's sculpture of the woman
He sits among the pieces on the floor
Virgil - feeling the damage
(going to him) Is anything broken
No - no bones are broken
Virgil uses the wall to stand - then - with his hands out in front of him he finds his way to the bed
It's finished - can't you see that
We both didn't get what we wanted
(quietly) never meant to hurt you
When you asked me to come here - did you ever think this wasn't going to work - that for one minute  may not be able to see
(beat) Did you ever think it would be to have a relationship with a blind man
Amy - a pause
Too long
There's my answer
And he grabs his duffel and pack - throws the last few things in - and moving to the door - leaves
-  - Virgil riding - crossing the George Washington Bridge - going home
He looks out the window - sees the receding city - and he closes his eyes - listens to the rain
-   - The Bus comes down the main street of Pinecrest
Stopping - the bus door opens and Virgil gets out - and turns to face up the street - the street he knew so well that is so foreign to him right now
' - The door opens
Jennie smiles warmly, reaches out to him
Welcome home
- Virgil and Jennie entering his place - to be greeted immediately by: bounding across the floor towards them - tail wagging - tongue hanging out
Sophie
And he bends down to hug her
Sophie laps at his face
Virgil holds her back to get a good look at her
Let me look at you
You're so beautiful
yes
Jennie watches her brother - happy to have him home
Hoping to get him back to 'normal'
'  - Virgil walks around, touching things, seeing the simplicity of his life
Nothing on the walls - no decorations - no plants
Everything functional
He realizes this is a home designed by his sister
He moves over to the photo of the family
He on his dad's shoulders
Stares at it - at his father and mother for the first time
Mom and dad
Virgil just stares
Everything's as you left it
Nothing's changed
Jen - 'm pretty tired - 'd like to be alone
The  rings
Rings again
Virgil doesn't move - his apprehension is clear - he knows who it is
Jennie sees this and moves toward the phone
Virgil turns and walks out onto the front porch - followed by Sophie, as his sister picks up the phone in the background
'  - He sits down - looks into the night as we hear Jennie faintly on the phone
beat and she hangs up
We hold on Virgil: - Virgil walks down Main street
Seeing his town - a town he grew up in but now seems so foreign
Virgil seems oddly disturbed by what he sees
The yellow bus drives by - full of kids - Carl at the helm
Somehow it's not what he expected
-   - Amy organizing all her work on the Atlanta project - - the original designs - the new design with the trees - then she sees: The sketch she made of the "dancing trees"
Her eyes hold - and she slowly shuts them - and with them tightly closed - her hand reaches out and runs along the drawings
-     - We find Virgil standing - looking out at the end of the street where he stood with Amy
In front of him he sees: The "dancing trees"
'  - a retinal spark - a quick glimpse of the intertwined trees - one lover choosing between two others
- Virgil - stands in the middle of the room
Looks about at what was at one time so special to him
Now it just seems old and dingy - the magic is gone
He closes his eyes for a moment - listens - cocks his head to the left - the right - but there is nothing there
- Virgil standing outside - staring at a building he's never seen - never been inside
: flickering a moment
- Virgil now sits at a table
Stacks and stacks of  magazine splayed out in front of him
He is flipping through them at a rapid rate - like a drowning man searching for air
- cars, , the pyramids, Martin Luther King, houses, flowers, Marilyn Monroe, that Napalm burned little girl in Viet Nam, African masks, Dachau prisoners, Nixon, Warhol paintings, the Mona Lisa, that vulture watching over the little baby, the Eiffel tower, First Man on the moon, the Venus De Milo, that guy in front of the tank in Tianaman square
and the Pyramids
The pictures go by fast and furious - Virgil soaking them up like a sponge - life, beauty, horror, great people, great events
And we move in on his face - absorbing these images for the last time - a face filled with anguish at a world disappearing
And we cut to: '  - Golden rays of the late afternoon sun
Amy on the roof - leaning on the parapet - watching the horizon
Then a thought comes to her
And mimicking what Virgil had done - she walks back to the other end of the roof, turns and looks out towards the skyline again
then starts slowly walking towards the parapet till she reaches the wall again
The reaction on her face - she doesn't "see" it - not like Virgil did
'  - Virgil is shifting furniture in his house
table - moves it to the window - moves a chair to join it - stands back to have a look at it
- a moment of clear - then haze - then dark - then haze
Virgil rubs his head - these last days of sight have been painful and exhausting for him
(
) Hello
She's at the door
Virgil cocks his head in her direction
picked up some things at the store - -shirts, 'm sure you're out, some socks
Jennie, what's at the end of Main Street
Well -  think it's Vivian's little stationery
Beyond all the stores - past firehouse
What happens when this is no more Main Street
Well - there's nothing really - you know that
~ No
You told me that's all there was
That's wrong
There's a helluva lot out there
Jennie surprised at where this is going
told you what you needed to know
What was within my reach
What more do vou want
Isn't there anything more that vou want
Is this about our father - he called told me
No
This isn't about him
Jennie - you've spent your whole life as blind as  was
The world doesn't stop within our reach
Virgil, please
This is your home
Stop thinking about what's out there - things that will never matter to you
You're safe here where everyone
Where everyone what
Knows you
Can protect me
(beat) Jennie, this place was a wonderful safe haven for me growing up
know that
(looking around) And  can only imagine what you gave up to keep this world for me
thank you and love you from the bottom of my soul
But now  want to give you your life back
Virgil,  -  can't
You can Virgil reaches out his arms for her to join him
'm reaching out, Jennie
This gets Jennie and she goes to him, really hugging him for the first time as tears flow from her eyes
'  - Amy, dressed in sweat pants and tee shirt sitting on the ground, trying to piece the sculpture back together
It's a difficult fix
Amy - you in there
Go away
She scrapes some plaster into a dust pan
We hear enters a key in the door - and the door opens
Duncan knew keeping this key would come in handy one day
What a mess - what happened
It broke - 'm trying to fix it
So - guess what
'm not in the mood for games
We got it
The goddamned Atlanta mall - we got it
Now - pull yourself out of this slump -  want you to fly down this week to
Continuing to work on the sculpture
'm not going
What are you ta1king about
What's the problem here
The problem
Everything
Nothing is right thank-you very much
You know what the problem is - you're the problem - you met a blind guy you thought was cool and spent the first two months trying to change him
Are you finished
Not even close
Let me tell you something - you can't change people to solve you
You tried to do it with me - you tried to do it with Virgil
You ever think some of the things you try to fix - ain't broke
And he's gone - as Amy slumps into a chair - confused, tired - then slowly she starts to hear: -  -
- The  of a  in the stairwell
Amy's heart starts racing - she takes a breath - jumps up quickly and moves her way over to the door - unlocking it and swinging it open: (excitedly) Virg
The  - being held by Ethan - as he taps his way down the stairs
Hey Amy
Hi, Ethan
Sorry -  thought
He's not coming back is he
No - he's not
Ethan sees she's covered in dust - looks past her into the loft
Whatcha doin'
He looks past her at the sculpture half repaired
Cleaning up a mess - going to start over
- Virgil walks the path, Sophie following close behind
By the way he walks, counting steps, touching landmarks, we realize he is using sight very little
- Coming through the clearing, to the plateau where he took Amy, the leaves now starting to turn golden colors - he stops - stands over top of the pond
'  -  retinal spark
The view across the valley, with white clouds against the bluest sky
His hand reaches out - to touch the edge of the world - to touch the horizon
And as he drops his hand, we see the clouds start to race by - while the blue sky goes golden then drifts into darkness
Virgil doesn't move from the spot
The screen goes almost black - then slowly the sun starts to rise in the east
Virgil makes no movement
long beat - then - as the sun moves across him - he realizes it's day
He stands and unfolds his cane
It's clear he has returned to being completely blind
As he turns and starts his way down the hill we hear: (
) Growing up blind -  had two dreams
One was to see
The other - to play for the New York Rangers
-
- Virgil stands at the podium speaking - dark glasses on, cane in hand
After the 'miracle' of my short period of sight -  realize - 'd rather play for the Rangers
(laughs from the dark) It's not that it was so awful -  saw many things - some good, some back some that 'm already forgetting
'  - (
) But  realized that our eyes aren't what make us see
We only live in darkness when we don't look - look at what is genuine about ourselves - genuine about others - you don't need eyes for that
Virgil sitting with three young blind children - working through Braille with them
Webster watches from the corner of the room
- Virgil - small brown bag in one hand - cane in the other - exits the building and makes his way across the street to Washington Square
- Virgil - taking in the sun - finishing off the last of his sandwich
Balling up his paper bag - he taps his cane out - finds the garbage can nearby - and tosses the bag - rim shot - it misses, hits the ground
hand reaches into frame and puts the bag in the garbage
Virgil looks up - senses the presence
Did  miss
(
) By a mile
Amy
Amy: watching Virgil - realizing his sight is gone
Ray told me you were living in town - said  could find you here
(beat) rushed, didn't
Fourteen steps to the tree and  made us smash right into it
We tried
Amy sits next to him
finished the sculpture
'd love you to see it
Figure of speech
Figure of speech
Virgil - when first met you - you saw more than any sighted person 've ever known
didn't mean to take that away from you
Amy
saw
actually saw the horizon
You did that for me
It's out there
You showed me you just have to reach for it
Amy smiles - her hand goes out - hesitates - then lands lightly on his
You want to walk
See what we see
Yeah
Just see what we see
Virgil smiles, nods
As he stands - he takes her arm - and as they walk off into the park, we slowly  to  and just , listen to the  of the day - the percussion of the city
