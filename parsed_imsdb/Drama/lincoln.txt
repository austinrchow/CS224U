Written by Tony Kushner Based in Part on Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln By Doris Kearns Goodwin Final Shooting Script December 20, 2011 , ' ,  - Heavy grey skies hang over a flooded field, the water two feet deep
Cannons and carts, half-submerged and tilted, their wheels trapped in the mud below the surface, are still yoked to dead and dying horses and oxen
terrible battle is taking place; two infantry companies, Negro Union soldiers and white Confederate soldiers, knee- deep in the water, staggering because of the mud beneath, fight each other hand-to-hand, with rifles, bayonets, pistols, knives and fists
There's no discipline or strategy, nothing depersonalized: it's mayhem and each side intensely hates the other
Both have resolved to take no prisoners
(
) Some of us was in the Second Kansas Colored
We fought the rebs at Jenkins' Ferry last April, just after they'd killed every Negro soldier they captured at Poison Springs
, - Rain and fog
Union Army companies are camped out across the grounds
Preparations are being made for the impending assault on the Confederate port of Wilmington, North Carolina
Two black soldiers stand before a bivouacked Negro unit: , an infantryman in his late thirties, and , a cavalryman in his early twenties sits on a bench facing Harold and Ira; his stovepipe hat is at his side
So at Jenkins' Ferry, we decided warn't taking no reb prisoners
And we didn't leave a one of `em alive
The ones of us that didn't die that day, we joined up with the 116th
Colored, sir
From Camp Nelson Kentucky
What's your name, soldier
Private Harold Green, sir
2
'm Corporal Ira Clark, sir
Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry
We're waiting over there
He nods in the direction of his cavalry
(') We're leaving our horses behind, and shipping out with the 24th Infantry for the assault next week on Wilmington
(to Harold Green:) How long've you been a soldier
Two year, sir
Second Kansas Colored Infantry, they fought bravely at Jenkins' Ferry
That's right, sir
They killed a thousand rebel soldiers, sir
They were very brave
(hesitating, then) And making three dollars less each month than white soldiers
Harold Green is a little startled at Clark's bluntness
Us 2nd Kansas boys, whenever we fight now we - Another three dollars subtracted from our pay for our uniforms
That was true, yessir, but that - Equal pay now
Still no commissioned Negro officers
am aware of it, Corporal Clark
3
Yes, sir, that's good you're aware, sir
It's only that - (to Lincoln, trying to change the subject:) You think the Wilmington attack is gonna be - Now that white people have accustomed themselves to seeing Negro men with guns, fighting on their behalf, and now that they can tolerate Negro soldiers getting the same pay - in a few years perhaps they can abide the idea of Negro lieutenants and captains
In fifty years, maybe a Negro colonel
In a hundred years - the vote
Green's offended at the way Clark is talking to Lincoln
What'll you do after the war, Corporal Clark
Work, sir
Perhaps you'll hire me
Perhaps  will
But you should know, sir, that get sick at the smell of bootblack and  can't cut hair
Lincoln smiles
've yet to find a man could cut mine so it'd make any difference
You got springy hair for a white man
Lincoln laughs
4
Yes,  do
My last barber hanged himself
And the one before that
Left me his scissors in his will
Green laughs
have come up, two young kids, nervous and excited
President Lincoln, sir
Evening, boys
Damn
Damn
We, we saw you, um
We were at, at - We was at Gettysburg
You boys fight at Gettysburg
can't believe it's - (') (to Green, with mild ) Naw, we didn't fight there
We just signed up last month
We saw him two years ago at the cemetery dedication
Yeah, we heard you speak
We
Uh, hey, how tall are you anyway
Jeez,  up
Could you hear what  said
No, sir, not much, it was- (he recites, fast and :) "Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the 5
proposition that all men are created equal
" That's good, thank you for - "Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure
We are, we are, we are met on a great battlefield of that war
" Thank you, that's - "We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live
It is
" (He chokes up a little
) His uncles, they died on the second day of fighting
(
) know the last part
"It is, Company up
Move it out
uh, it is rather -" Soldiers all over the field rise up at the mustering of the troops
Names of regiments, brigades, divisions are called: all across the field, the men put out fires, put on knapsacks
(to the two white :) You fellas best find your company
( :) Thank you, sir
God bless you
God bless you
The second white soldier salutes, and the two move out
6
Green salutes Lincoln as well and glances at Clark, who remains, looking down
Green leaves
Clark looks up, salutes Lincoln and, turning smartly, walks toward his unit
Then he stops, turns back, faces Lincoln, who watches him beat, and then, in a tone of admiration and cautious admonishment, reminding Lincoln of his promise: "That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in -- " Clark salutes Lincoln again, turns again and walks away
Lincoln watches him go
As he walks into the fog, Clark continues reciting in a powerful voice: (') " - That this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth
" Lincoln watches Clark until the fog's swallowed him up
: , 1865 ' - - huge, dark, strange-looking steamship, part wood and part iron, turreted like a giant ironclad monitor, is plowing through the choppy black waters of an open sea
Lincoln is alone, in darkness, on the deck, which has no railing, open to the sea
The ship's tearing through rough water, but there's little pitching, wind or spray
The deck is dominated by the immense black gunnery turret
(
) It's nighttime
The ship's moved by some terrible power, at a terrific speed
Lincoln stares out towards a barely discernible horizon, indicated by a weird, flickering, leaden glow, which appears to recede faster than the fast-approaching ship
7
(
) Though it's imperceptible in the darkness,  have an intuition that we're headed towards a shore
No one else seems to be aboard the vessel
'm alone
' ,       - The room's cozy, attractive, cluttered, part dressmaker's workshop, part repository of Mary's endless purchases: clothing, fabrics, knicknacks, carpets
Books everywhere
Lincoln reclines on a French chair, too small for his lengthy frame
He's in shirtsleeves, vest unbuttoned and tie unknotted, shoeless
He has an open folio filled with documents on his lap
sits opposite, in a nightgown, housecoat and night cap
She watches him in her vanity mirror
She looks frightened
: could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space
were it not that  have bad dreams
reckon it's the speed that's strange to me
'm used to going a deliberate pace
Mary looks at him, stricken with alarm
(') should spare you
shouldn't tell you my dreams
don't want to be spared if you aren't
And you spare me nothing
He looks down at the carpet, then back up at her
(') Perhaps perhaps it's the assault on Wilmington port
You dream about the ship before a battle, usually
8
(rapping lightly on his :) How's the coconut
Beyond description
She delicately touches her head
(') Almost two years, nothing mends
Another casualty of the war
Who wants to listen to a useless woman grouse about her carriage accident
do
Stuff
You tell me dreams, that's all, 'm your soothsayer, that's all  am anymore, 'm not to be trusted with - Even if it wasn't a carriage accident, even if it was an attempted assassination - It was most probably an - It was an assassin
Whose intended target was you
How's the plans for the big shindy progressing
don't want to talk about parties
You don't care about parties
Not much but they're a necessary - Mary studies Lincoln, thinking
Then a revelation: know
know what it's about
The ship, it isn't Wilmington Port, it's not a military campaign
It's the amendment to abolish slavery
Why else would you force me to 9
invite demented radicals into my home
Lincoln closes his folio
(') You're going to try to get the amendment passed in the House of Representatives, before the term ends, before the Inauguration
(:) Don't spend too much money on the flubdubs
Mary stands, goes up to him
No one's loved as much as you, no one's ever been loved so much, by the people, you might do anything now
Don't, don't waste that power on an amendment bill that's sure of defeat
Seeing that he's not going to discuss this, she turns away, walking to an open window
(') Did you remember Robert's coming home for the reception
Lincoln nods, though Mary isn't bothering to look at him
(') knew you'd forget
She closes the window
(') That's the ship you're sailing on
The Thirteenth Amendment
You needn't tell me 'm right
know am
She watches as he leaves the room, smiling in bitter victory: she's right
10
,  '  - Lincoln encounters  , a light-skinned black woman, 38, Mary's dressmaker and close friend, holding a dark- blue velvet bodice embroidered with jet beads
It's late, Mrs
Keckley
(holding out the bodice:) She needs this for the grand reception
Lincoln bends down to look at the intricate beading
(') It's slow work
He nods, smiles, straightens up
Good night
He continues down the hall
Mrs
Keckley starts to enter Mary's boudoir, then stops, sensing something amiss
She calls quietly after Lincoln: (concerned, a little :) Did you tell her a dream
' ,  ,   - working room, sparsely furnished
Lincoln's desk is heaped with files, books, newspapers
The desk's near a window, now open
Comfortable chairs and a rocker are in a corner
Near the fireplace, in which embers are dying, there's a long table, eight chairs around it, settings by each chair of inkwells and pens
Dozens of maps cover the walls and the crowded bookcases
Lincoln opens the door and enters to find his 10 year-old son near the hearth, sleeping, sprawled on a very large military map
Lead toy soldiers are scattered across it
large mahogany box, imprinted   , is open near Tad's head
The box contains large glass plates, each framed in wood; these are photographic negatives
Tad's been looking at several, which lie near him on the map
11
Lincoln kneels by Tad and looks down at the map, a topographical and strategic survey of the no-man's land between Union and Confederate forces at Petersburg
He scrutinizes the precisely drawn blue and grey lines
He lifts one of the glass plates and holds it to the firelight: it's a large photographic negative of a young black boy
There's a caption, in elegant cursive script: "Abner, age 12 - $500" And another: "Two young boys, 10 & 14 - $700" Lincoln puts the plates back in the box and closes the lid
Carefully brushing the toy soldiers aside, he lies down beside Tad
He touches Tad's hair and kisses his forehead
Tad stirs as Lincoln gets on all fours; without really waking up, knowing the routine, Tad climbs onto his father's back
Tad holds on as his father stands, weary, and maybe a little surprised to find his growing son slightly heavier than he was the night before
( :) Papa
Hmm
Papa  wanna see Willie
(:) Me too, Taddie
But we can't
Why not
Willie's gone
Three years now
He's gone
Lincoln carries Tad out of the room, closing the door
,  - new flagpole is being dedicated
Lincoln, in a black overcoat and his stovepipe hat, and Treasury Secretary , 59, stand by the pole
They face an audience of officials, clerks, dignitaries, wives, soldiers
Marine band finishes a jaunty instrumental rendition of "We Are Coming Father Abra'am
" 12
Two soldiers fasten a flag to the halyards
Lincoln moves into place; as the crowd applauds, he takes a sheet of paper from inside his hat and glances at it
Then he looks up
The part assigned to me is to raise the flag, which, if there be no fault in the machinery,  will do, and when up, it will be for the people to keep it up
He puts the paper away
The audience waits, expecting more
(') That's my speech
He smiles at them
They applaud, some laughing
As Lincoln turns the crank, hoisting the flag, a solo trumpet plays "We Are Coming Father Abra'am" and the audience joins in
Among them, Secretary of State  , 64, in a thick, exquisite winter coat and hat, and Lincoln's dapper assistant secretary,  , 27
Seward looks pleased
"We are coming, Father Abra'am, three hundred thousand more, From Mississippi's winding stream and from New England's shore
" We leave our plows and workshops, our wives and children dear, With hearts too full for utterance, With but a silent tear
We're coming Father Abra'am
" ,  ,  - In a four-door carriage, top down, Seward sits opposite Lincoln
Hay, next to Seward, organizes papers in a portfolio on his lap
Even if every Republican in the House votes yes - far from guaranteed, since when has our party unanimously supported anything
- but say all our fellow Republicans vote for it
We'd still be twenty votes short
Only twenty
13
Only twenty
We can find twenty votes
Twenty House Democrats who'll vote to abolish slavery
In my opinion - To which  always listen
Or pretend to
With all three of my ears
We'll win the war soon - It's inevitable, isn't it
Ain't won yit
You'll begin your second term with semi-divine stature
Imagine the possibilities peace will bring
Why tarnish your invaluable luster with a battle in the House
It's a rats' nest in there, the same gang of talentless hicks and hacks that rejected the amendment ten months back
We'll lose
Lincoln smiles
like our chances now
' ,    - Lincoln is at his desk, Hay feeding him documents to read and sign
Seward warms himself by the fireplace, holding a brandy
Consider the obstacles that we'd face
The aforementioned two-thirds majority needed to pass an amendment: we have a Republican 14
majority, but barely more than fifty percent - Fifty-six
We need Democratic support
There's none to be had
Since the House last voted on the amendment there's been an election
Sixty-four Democrats lost their House seats in November
That's sixty-four Democrats looking for work come March
know, but that's - They don't need to worry about re-election, they can vote however it suits `em
There's a knock at the office door
But we can't, um, buy the (to Hay:) vote for the amendment
It's Might as well let `em in
too important
(') said nothing of buying anything
We need twenty votes was all said
Start of my second term, plenty of positions to fill
Hay opens the door to the outer office, admitting the sound of a sizable crowd
, 33, Lincoln's rather severe German-born senior secretary, ushers in
, mid-40s, mud-spattered coat, hat in hands, followed by
, similarly road-worn, holding a suitcase
Lincoln stands
Mr
President, may  present Mr
and Mrs
Jolly who've come from Missouri to - From Jeff City, President
Lincoln shakes Mr
Jolly's hand
Mrs
Jolly curtseys
15
Mr
Jolly
Ma'am
This by the fire's Secretary of State Seward
Seward nods slightly as he lights a Cuban cigar
(') Jeff City
Lincoln looks at the Jollys
They are worried and a little awed
(') heard tell once of a Jefferson City lawyer who had a parrot that'd wake him each morning crying out, "Today is the day the world shall end, as scripture has foretold
" And one day the lawyer shot him for the sake of peace and quiet, presume, thus fulfilling, for the bird at least, its prophecy
Lincoln smiles
The Jollys don't get it
Mr
Jolly looks back at Seward, who gestures for him to speak, then exhales a plume of smoke
(launching into his :) They's only one tollbooth in Jeff City, t' the southwest `n this man Heinz Sauermagen from Rolla been in illegal possession for near two yar, since your man General Schofield set him up there
But President Monroe give that tollgate to my granpap and Quincy Adams give my pap a letter saying it's our'n for keeps
Mrs
Jolly got the - (to his wife:) Show Mr
Lincoln the Quincy Adams letter
Mrs
Jolly opens the suitcase and begins to dig frantically for the letter
That's unnecessary, Mrs
Jolly
Just tell me what you want from me
Seward exhales more smoke
16
Mr
Jolly starts coughing, while Mrs
Jolly tries to fan away the cigar smoke with the Quincy Adams letter
Mr
Jolly's emphysema don't care for cigars
Madame
Do you know about the proposed Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution - Yes sir, everybody knows of it
The President favors it
Do you
We do
You know that it abolishes slavery
Yes sir
know it
And is that why you favor it
What  favor's ending the war
Once't we do away with slavery, the rebs'll quit fighting, since slavery's what they're fighting for
Mr
Lincoln, you always says so
With the amendment, slavery's ended and they'll give up
The war can finish then
If the war finished first, before we end slavery, would - President Lincoln says the war won't stop unless we finish slavery- But if it did
The South is exhausted
If they run out of bullets and men, would you still 17
want your, uh - Who's your representative
Jeff City
That's, uh, Congressman Burton
"Beanpole" Burton,  mean, Josiah Burton, yes, sir
(to Mrs
Jolly:) Republican
Undecided on the question of the amendment, believe
Perhaps you could call on him and inform him of your enthusiasm
Yeah
Madam
If the rebels surrender next week, would you, at the end of this month, want Congressman Burton to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment
Mrs
Jolly is puzzled, and looks to Mr
Jolly
Then: If that was how it was, no more war and all,  reckon Mr
Jolly'd much prefer not to have Congress pass the amendment
Mr
Jolly nods
Seward glances at Lincoln, then turns back to : And why's that
Mr
Jolly's surprised: the answer's so obvious
(in a hoarse voice:) Niggers
If he don't have to let some Alabama coon come up to Missouri, steal his chickens, and his job, he'd much prefer that
18
Seward takes the letter from Mrs
Jolly and hands it to Lincoln
(to Lincoln, quietly:) The people
begin to see why you're in such a great hurry to put it through
(to Mr
Jolly:) Would you let me study this letter, sir, about the tollbooth
Come back to me in the morning and we'll consider what the law says
Lincoln stands
(') And be sure to visit "Beanpole" and tell him that you support passage of the Amendment
As a military necessity
The Jollys nod, skeptical now
(to the Jollys:) Thank you
Nicolay escorts them out
Before he closes the door: Oh, Nicolay
When you have a moment
Nicolay nods and steps into the anteroom, where dozens more petitioners are waiting to speak with Lincoln
Hay confers with the doorman
Seward closes the door behind them
Lincoln kneels at the fireplace, stoking the fire
He puts more wood in, then stands
Seward watches him, then: If procuring votes with offers of employment is what you intend, 'll fetch a friend from Albany who can supply the skulking men gifted at this kind of shady work
Spare me the indignity of actually speaking to Democrats
Spare you the exposure and liability
19
There is a sharp knock on the closed door, followed by two long ones
Pardon me, that's a distress signal, which  am bound by solemn oath to respond to
Lincoln opens the door
Tad enters, cross
Tom Pendel took away the glass camera plates of slaves Mr
Gardner sent over because Tom says mama says they're too distressing, but- You had nightmares all night, mama's right to - But 'll have worse nightmares if you don't let me look at the plates again
Perhaps
We can't afford a single defection from anyone in our party
not even a single Republican absent when they vote
You know who you've got to see
Nicolay enters
Lincoln turns to him
Send over to Blair House
Ask Preston Blair can  call on him around five o'clock
(a shudder, a swallow of :) God help you
God alone knows what he'll ask you to give him
,  ,  - Lincoln's perched on the edge of an ottoman
20
If the Blairs tell `em to, no Republican will balk at voting for the amendment
The room is baronial
, patriarch of his wealthy and powerful family, 72 years old, sits facing his son, , 50, whip-thin
fire blazes in a massive fireplace behind Monty
Preston's handsome, elegant daughter, , 45, sits across from Monty, next to Tad, who's wearing a Union infantryman's uniform, a real musket by his side
No conservative Republican is what you mean - All Republicans ought to be conservative,  founded this party - in my own goddamned home - to be a conservative antislavery party, not a hobbyhorse for goddamned radical abolitionists and - Damp down the dyspepsia, daddy, you'll frighten the child
( :) You need us to keep the conservative side of the party in the traces while you diddle the radicals and bundle up with Thaddeus Stevens's gang
You need our help
Yes, sir,  do
Well, what do we get
Whoo
Blunt
Your manners, Monty, must be why Mr
Lincoln pushed you out of his cabinet
He was pushed out -  wasn't pushed
21
(') ( :) Oh of course you weren't
He was pushed out to placate (to Tad:) the goddamn radical  agreed to resign
abolishonists
(') (a nod at Tad:) Oh Daddy, please
You don't mind, boy, do you
He spends his days with soldiers
They taught me a song
Did they
Soldiers know all manner of songs
How's your brother Bob
He's at school now, but he's coming to visit in four days
For the shindy
At school
Ain't that fine
Good he's not in the army
Oh he wants to be, but mama said he ' - Dangerous life, soldiering
Your mama is wise to keep him clean out of that
Now your daddy knows that what want, in return for all the help give him, is to go down to Richmond like he said  could, soon as Savannah fell, and talk to Jefferson Davis
Give me terms 22
can offer to Jefferson Davis to start negotiating for peace
He'll talk to me
Conservative members of your party want you to listen to overtures from Richmond
That above all
Two black servants who have entered begin to pour and serve tea
(') They'll vote for this rash and dangerous amendment only if every other possibility is exhausted
Our Republicans ain't abolitionists
We can't tell our people they can vote yes on abolishing slavery unless at the same time we can tell `em that you're seeking a negotiated peace
The Blairs look at Lincoln, waiting for an answer
- light snow's beginning to fall
lacquered coach stands outside the house, the Blair crest in gold on its doors
Elizabeth Blair Lee, a blanket in her arms, comes out of the house, talking to , an elderly black servant, formerly a slave belonging to the Blairs
They're followed by an elderly black woman in a housekeeper's uniform
Leo, it's a hundred miles to Richmond
Get him drunk so he can sleep
Yes'm
Elizabeth goes to the carriage, where Preston awaits
She passes the blanket through the carriage window and tucks it around her father
Here, daddy
23
Oh
Thank you
(fussing with the :) Let's fix this up
Where's my hat
Leo has your hat
All right
As Leo climbs into the carriage, Elizabeth kisses her hand, then slaps the kiss on her father's cheek
(') Go make peace
' ,   - The cabinet has assembled
Lincoln heads the table, Seward at his left and
, Secretary of War, 51, barrel- shaped, long bearded, bespectacled, at his right
Next to him are Secretary of the Navy  , 63, luxurious white hair (it's a wig) and a flowing snowy beard; Postmaster General  , 50; Secretary of the Interior , 49; Secretary of the Treasury  , 59; and Attorney General  , 53
Nicolay and Hay are in chairs behind Lincoln, taking notes
( :) Thunder forth, God of War
Stanton clears his throat
He's noticed the singed edge
We'll commence our assault on Wilmington from the sea
(:) Why is this burnt
Was the boy playing with it
It got took by a breeze several nights back
This is an official War Department map
24
And the entire cabinet's waiting to hear what it portends
bombardment
From the largest fleet the Navy has ever assembled
( :) Old Neptune
Shake thy hoary locks
Welles stands
Fifty-eight ships are underway, of every tonnage and firing range
Welles gestures on the map to the positions of many ships
We'll keep up a steady barrage
Our first target is Fort Fisher
It defends Wilmington Port
Stanton indicates the lines tracing artillery trajectories
These converge particularly heavily on Fort Fisher
steady barrage
hundred shells a minute
There's a moment of shocked silence
(') Till they surrender
Dear God
Yes
Yes
Wilmington's their last open seaport
Therefore
Wilmington falls, Richmond falls after
25
And the war
is done
The rest of the cabinet applauds, foot stomping, table slapping
Only John Usher doesn't join in
Then why, if  may ask are we not concentrating the nation's attention on Wilmington
Why, instead, are we reading in the - (he smacks a newspaper on ) - that the anti-slavery amendment is being precipitated onto the House floor for debate - because your eagerness, in what seems an unwarranted intrusion of the Executive into Legislative prerogatives, is compelling it to it's
to what's likely to be its premature demise
You signed the Emancipation Proclamation, you've done all that can be expected - The Emancipation Proclamation's merely a war measure
After the war the courts'll make a meal of it
When Edward Bates was Attorney General, he felt confident in it enough to allow you to sign - ( :) Different lawyers, different opinions
It frees slaves as a military exigent, not in any other - don't recall Bates being any too certain about the legality of my Proclamation, just it wasn't downright criminal
Somewhere's in between
Back when  rode the legal circuit in Illinois  defended a woman from Metamora named Melissa Goings, 77 years old, they said she murdered her husband; he was 83
He was choking her; and, uh, she grabbed ahold of a stick of fire- 26
wood and fractured his skull, `n he died
In his will he wrote " expect she has killed me
If  get over it,  will have revenge
" This gets a laugh
(') No one was keen to see her convicted, he was that kind of husband
asked the prosecuting attorney if  might have a short conference with my client
And she and  went into a room in the courthouse, but  alone emerged
The window in the room was found to be wide open
It was believed the old lady may have climbed out of it
told the bailiff right before left her in the room she asked me where she could get a good drink of water, and  told her Tennessee
Mrs
Goings was seen no more in Metamora
Enough justice had been done; they even forgave the bondsman her bail
'm afraid  don't - decided that the Constitution gives me war powers, but no one knows just exactly what those powers are
Some say they don't exist
don't know
decided needed them to exist to uphold my oath to protect the Constitution, which  decided meant that  could take the rebels' slaves from `em as property confiscated in war
That might recommend to suspicion that agree with the rebs that their slaves are property in the first place
Of course  don't, never have, 'm glad to see any man free, and if calling a man property, or war contraband, does the trick
Why  caught at the opportunity
Now here's where it gets truly slippery
use the law allowing for the seizure of property in a war knowing it applies only to the property of governments and 27
citizens of belligerent nations
But the South ain't a nation, that's why  can't negotiate with 'em
So if in fact the Negroes are property according to law, have the right to take the rebels' property from `em, if  insist they're rebels only, and not citizens of a belligerent country
And slipperier still:  maintain it ain't our actual Southern states in rebellion, but only the rebels living in those states, the laws of which states remain in force
The laws of which states remain in force
That means, that since it's states' laws that determine whether Negroes can be sold as slaves, as property - the Federal government doesn't have a say in that, least not yet - (a glance at Seward, :) - then Negroes in those states are slaves, hence property, hence my war powers allow me to confiscate `em as such
So  confiscated `em
But if 'm a respecter of states' laws, how then can  legally free `em with my Proclamation, as done, unless 'm cancelling states' laws
felt the war demanded it; my oath demanded it;  felt right with myself; and  hoped it was legal to do it, 'm hoping still
He looks around the table
Everyone's listening
(') Two years ago  proclaimed these people emancipated - "then, thenceforward and forever free
" But let's say the courts decide had no authority to do it
They might well decide that
Say there's no amendment abolishing slavery
Say it's after the war, and  can no longer use my war powers to just ignore the courts' decisions, like sometimes felt  had to do
Might those people  freed be ordered back into slavery
That's why 'd like to get the Thirteenth Amendment through the House, and on 28
its way to ratification by the states, wrap the whole slavery thing up, forever and aye
As soon as 'm able
Now
End of this month
And 'd like you to stand behind me
Like my cabinet's most always done
moment's silence, broken by a sharp laugh from Seward
(') As the preacher said,  could write shorter sermons but once  start get too lazy to stop
It seems to me, sir, you're describing precisely the sort of dictator the Democrats have been howling about
Dictators aren't susceptible to law
Neither is he
He just said as much
Ignoring the courts
Twisting meanings
What reins him in from, from
Well, the people do that, suppose
signed the Emancipation Proclamation a year and half before my second election
felt  was within my power to do it; however also felt that  might be wrong about that;  knew the people would tell me
gave `em a year and half to think about it
And they re- elected me
() And come February the first, intend to sign the Thirteenth Amendment
' ,   - Nicolay opens the door to the crowded outer office to admit perpetually worried  , 42, (, )
Tad eyes him from a chair by the window
29
Lincoln enters the room with Seward
Well, Mr
Representative Ashley
Tell us the news from the Hill
Lincoln shakes his hand and warmly claps the discombobulated but flattered representative on the shoulder
Well
Ah
News - Why for instance is this thus, and what is the reason for this thusness
James, we want you to bring the anti-slavery amendment to the floor for debate - Excuse me
What
- immediately, and - You are the amendment's manager, are you not
am, of course - But - Immediately
And we're counting on robust radical support, so tell Mr
Stevens we expect him to put his back into it, it's not going to be easy, but we trust - It's impossible
No,  am sorry, no, we can't organize anything immediately in the House
have been canvassing the Democrats since the election, in case any of them softened after they got walloped
But they have stiffened if anything, Mr
Secretary
There aren't nearly enough votes - We're whalers, Mr
Ashley
30
Whalers
As in, um, whales
Lincoln moves in, standing very close to Ashley
We've been chasing this whale for a long time
We've finally placed a harpoon in the monster's back
It's in, James, it's in
We finish the deed now, we can't wait
Or with one flop of his tail he'll smash the boat and send us all to eternity
On the 31st of this month
Of this year
Put the amendment up for a vote
Ashley is agog
'     - The room's redolent of politics, ideology (a bust of Robespierre, a print of Tom Paine), long occupancy and hard work
On the wall opposite a massive desk hangs a faded banner: "-  ,  , 9TH ,  "
At the desk sits   (, ), 73, bald under a horrible red wig, a gaunt, powerful face resembling Lincoln's, though beardless and bitter
In the office are Ashley, Speaker of the House (, ), formidable Senator   (, ), who's never smiled, and    (, )
Whalers
That's what he said
The man's never been near a whale ship in his life
( :) Withdraw radical support, force him to abandon this scheme, whatever he's up to - He drags his feet about everything, Lincoln; why this urgency
We got it through the Senate without difficulty because 31
we had the numbers
Come December you'll have the same in the House
The amendment'll be the easy work of ten minutes
He's using the threat of the amendment to frighten the rebels into an immediate surrender
imagine we'd rejoice to see that
Will you rejoice when the Southern states have re-joined the Union, pell-mell, as Lincoln intends them to, and one by one each refuses to ratify the amendment
If we pass it, which we won't
( :) Why are we co-operating with, with him
We all know what he's doing and we all know what he'll do
We can't offer up abolition's best legal prayer to his games and tricks
He's said he'd welcome the South back with all its slaves in chains
Three years ago he said that
To calm the border states when we were- don't
This confuses the room
Stevens turns to Vintner Litton
(') You said "we all know what he'll do
"  don't know
You know he isn't to be trusted
Trust
'm sorry,  was under the misapprehension your chosen profession was politics
've never trusted the President
never 32
trust anyone
But
Hasn't he surprised you
No, Mr
Stevens, he hasn't
Nothing surprises you, Asa, therefore nothing about you is surprising
Perhaps that is why your constituents did not re-elect you to the coming term
(collecting his cane and :) It's late, 'm old, 'm going home
Stevens limps to the door, opens it, and turns
(') Lincoln the inveterate dawdler, Lincoln the Southerner, Lincoln the capitulating compromiser, our adversary - and leader of the godforsaken Republican Party, our party - Abraham Lincoln has asked us to work with him to accomplish the death of slavery in America
(:) Retain, even in opposition, your capacity for astonishment
Stevens leaves, shutting the door
They watch him go, Ashley excited, Litton unmoved, insulted, skeptical

On the table, a leather folio lies open: prospectuses for jobs in the administration
Latham and Schell study these
Bilbo is studying Seward
The President is never to be mentioned

Hell, you can have that for nothin', what we need money for is bribes
It'd speed things up
No
Nothing strictly illegal
It's not illegal to bribe Congressmen
They starve otherwise

Bilbo and Mr
Latham that we're offering patronage jobs to the Dems who vote yes
Jobs and nothing more
That's correct
Congressmen come cheap
Few thousand bucks'll buy you all you need
The President would be unhappy to hear you did that
Well, will he be unhappy if we lose

Bilbo takes a mallet to a crab, smashing it

It subsides enough for Colfax to be heard from his chair atop the central : The House recognizes Fernando Wood, the honorable representative from New York

On the Democratic side, 81 members applaud   (, ) as he takes the podium
The Democratic leadership, including   (), has gathered around House minority leader  ()
On the Republican side of the aisle, enraged booing from the 102 Republicans, including   (),   (), Vintner Litton and Ashley, all gathered around Stevens's desk
Estimable colleagues
Two bloody years ago this month, his Highness, King Abraham Africanus the First - our Great Usurping Caesar, violator of habeas corpus and freedom of the press, abuser of states' rights - (loud:) - radical republican autocrat If Lincoln really were a ruling by fiat and martial tyrant, Mr
Wood, he'd'a had law affixed his name to his your empty head impaled on a heinous and illicit pike, and the country better Emancipation Proclamation, for it

Murmuring from the floor and the balcony, in the front row of which Mary and Elizabeth Keckley sit
Mary turns her gaze from the floor to watch Latham and Schell, a few seats away, scrutinize the floor, whispering, Latham taking notes
Schell holds the leather prospectus folio in his lap
Bilbo sits behind them
They study the other  Democrats -  , ,  ,  ,   - who 35

Wild cheering and booing

He should serves shall oppose- be cheering right now, but
Looks like he ate a bad oyster
Thaddeus Stevens calls out from his desk

Speaker, if you please
When will Mr
Wood - Mr
Speaker,  still have the floor and the gentleman from Pennsylvania is out of order
- when will Mr
Wood conclude his interminable gabble
Some of us breathe oxygen, and we find the mephitic fumes of his oratory a lethal challenge to our pleural capacities
Wild cheering, applause from the Republicans
37
We shall oppose this amendment, and any legislation that so affronts natural law, insulting to God as to man
Congress must never declare equal those whom God created unequal
The Democrats cheer
Mary watches with concern
Mrs

Slavery is the only insult to natural law, you fatuous nincompoop

They've lined up along both sides of the wall and are hooting, laughing, clapping and cheering, egging on Tad as, with furious concentration, he drives a cart pulled at considerable speed by a large and seriously annoyed goat down 38

Your goat got big
Robert disentangles himself from Tad and hands him a suitcase
(') Here, help me get one of these to my room

As Robert hoists the rest of the luggage himself, Tad chatters and   comes forward
He grabs the trunk as Robert's lifting it

Jefferson Davis is sending three delegates: Stephens, Hunter and Campbell: Vice President of the Confederacy, their former Secretary of State, and their Assistant 41
Secretary of War
They're coming in earnest to propose peace
Both men look into the fire
Preston moves closer

Now hear me:  went to Richmond to talk to traitors, to smile at and plead with traitors, because it'll be spring in two months, the roads'll be passable, the Spring slaughter commences
Four bloody Springs now

Think of all the boys who'll die if you don't make peace
You must talk with these men

And in return,  must ask you - No, this is not horsetrading, - to support our push for this is life and - the amendment when it reaches - There's a knock on the door

Robert enters
Nicolay stands behind him, apologetic

Fit and rested
Mr
Blair

Thank you
He turns to Preston
Robert, stung, hesitates, then leaves the room, Nicolay shutting the door behind him

You've always kept your word to me
Those Southern men are coming

Preston,  understand

Graylor looks over the prospectuses
(
) We have one abstention so far - (
) Jacob Graylor - Graylor selects one and hands it to Bilbo
(
) He'd like to be Federal Revenue Assessor for the Fifth District of Pennsylvania
- small room, two beds, in disarray: newspapers, overflowing ashtrays, whiskey bottles empty on the floor
Latham and Schell stand at a table strewn with the remnants of a poker game
Bilbo lies on one of the beds
All three are in their shirtsleeves
Seward is at the table
43
- so the total of representatives voting three weeks from today is reduced to 182, which means 122 yes votes to reach the requisite two- thirds of the House
Assuming all Republicans vote for the amendment
Seward nods, less assertively than Latham would like
(') Then, despite our abstention, to reach a two-thirds majority we remain 20 yeses short
,  - Bilbo is drinking schooners of beer with   (, ) and   (, )
Hawkins listens as Bilbo gives his pitch
LeClerk looks at the prospectuses
(
) For which we're seeking from among 64 lame duck Democrats
Fully 39 of these we deem unredeemable no votes
LeClerk throws his beer in Bilbo's face, soaking Bilbo and the prospectuses
Hawkins looks shocked
LeClerk storms out
- The kind that hates niggers, hates God for making niggers
The Good Lord on High would despair of their souls
(:) Thank you for that pithy explanation, Mr
Bilbo
We've abandoned these 39 to the Devil that possesses them
44
- Schell stands at the door of a small, grubby row house
He presents the folio, warped from its beer bath, to (, ), eyes red from crying, dressed in mourning black
Hutton slams the door in Schell's face
funeral wreath that adorns the door falls to the ground
daguerreotype attached to the wreath depicts a young officer, Hutton's brother Frederick
- The remaining lame ducks, on whom we've been working with a purpose - Schell hands Latham a stack of folded prospectuses, each with a name scrawled on it
Charles Hanson
- Representatives Merrick, Lanford, Benson, Stuart and Hanson, the New York lame ducks, descend the stairs, discussing the opening of the amendment debate, to which they've just been listening
Latham smoothly holds Hanson back from the group, extending a hand, the still pristine portfolio under his arm
He smiles as the other  lame ducks proceed down the stairs, unaware, then nods his head back up toward the Capitol steps, where Bilbo and Schell wait
Latham opens the folio as he talks to Hanson
- Giles Stuart
- In the grand lobby there are Federal bank windows
Schell is in line at one of these behind Giles Stuart, who completes a transaction and leaves, counting money
Bilbo, barrelling the other way, intentionally slams into Stuart, causing him to drop his money
Bilbo and Schell both kneel to help
45
Schell places the open folio in Stuart's hands
As the men pile his recovered money into the folio, Stuart's puzzled, then intrigued
Schell gives him a meaningful look
folded prospectus, now with the name "Stuart" scrawled on it, is added to a growing file
,  - Visitors file past cabinets containing animal and plant specimens and inventions; the line circles around a large case in which an amputated leg capped with a brass plate is displayed
sign identifies it: ,  ,  5, 1863
(
) Nelson Merrick
Latham looks through the case at Schell, who's next to Nelson Merrick, who nods, solemnly staring at the leg
Schell proffers Merrick the folio
Merrick flips through the folio
(
) Homer Benson
' ,  - hall packed with working men, soaped-up windows saws away
Homer Benson, incongruous in a suit, slurps
As he lifts his spoon to his mouth, the folio is placed in front of him
He looks over, puzzled, as Schell smiles and extends a hand
Benson takes the folio
Schell slides his chair closer
- Another prospectus joins the pile: "Benson" And lastly
Bilbo retrieves a paper from the floor and hands it to Seward
Clay Hawkins
Of Ohio

Bilbo has a small covered wicker basket slung over his shoulder
Hawkins follows, happy and sick with fear
-tax collector for the Western Reserve
Th-th-that pays handsomely
Don't just reach for the highest branches
They sway in every breeze
Assistant Port Inspector of Marlston looks like the ticket to me
Uh, boats, they, they make me sick
Bilbo retrieves a snare; a small bird is trapped by the foot
Bilbo stuffs the bird in the basket
(') So just stand on the dock
Let the Assistant Assistant Port Inspector's stomach go weak
Bilbo eyes Hawkins, who anxiously eyes the folio
' ,   - Seward hands the last prospectus to Nicolay, who unfolds it, places it on top of the other prospectuses, and records details about Hawkins's appointment in a notebook
Seward smokes a cigar, Nicolay a pipe
Lincoln sits, feet up, examining a newspaper
And lastly, Democratic yes vote number six
Hawkins from Ohio
Six
Well, thus far
Plus Graylor's abstention
From tiny acorns and so on
What'd Hawkins get
47
( :) Postmaster of the Millersburg Post Office
He's selling himself cheap, ain't he
He wanted tax collector of the Western Reserve - a first-term congressman who couldn't manage re- election,  felt it unseemly and they bargained him down to Postmaster
( :) Scatter `em over several rounds of appointments, so no one notices
And burn this ledger, please, after you're done
Lincoln stands
( :) Time for my public opinion bath
Might as well let `em in
Nicolay helps Lincoln trade his shawl for his overcoat in preparation to meet the public
(') Seven yeses with Mr
Ellis
Thirteen to go
One last item, an absurdity, but - My associates report that among the Representatives a fantastical rumor's bruited about, which immediately disavowed, that you'd allowed bleary old Preston Blair to sojourn to Richmond to invite Jeff Davis to send commissioners up to Washington with a peace plan
Lincoln is silent
horrifying reality dawns for Seward: (') , of course, told them you would never
Not without consulting me, you wouldn't
Because why on earth would you

The officers exchange documents and salutes
:  ' , 11 The ranking Confederate trots to a buggy in which three Confederate officials sit: Vice President  , 53, short;
, Assistant Secretary of War, 54; and Senator
, 56
They're well-dressed for winter, Stephens especially heavily bundled
Stephens, Campbell and the indignant Hunter leave the buggy and are escorted by Confederate officers to the waiting company of Union cavalry and infantry
Union Army ambulance, a large American flag painted on one side, driven by   , stands near broken wagons and a derelict cannon
stands at attention by the ambulance's rear door
The soldier, staring coldly at these men, gestures brusquely to the ambulance
The Confederate peace commissioners hesitate; Hunter stares in horror at the black soldiers
Then Stephens pushes past Hunter
He nods to the soldier
(with polite dignity:) Much obliged
He boards the ambulance
His fellow delegates follow in his wake, Hunter glaring with defiant hatred at the soldiers before climbing in
' ,   - Seward stands, stunned
Lincoln sits at the cabinet table
Nicolay is gone
Why wasn't  consulted
'm Secretary of State
You, you, you informally send a reactionary dottard, to - What will happen, do you imagine, when these peace commissioners arrive
49
We'll hear `em out
Oh, splendid
And next the Democrats will invite `em up to hearings on the Hill, and the newspapers - well, the newspapers - the newspapers will ask "why risk enraging the Confederacy over the issue of slavery when they're here to make peace
" We'll lose every Democrat we've got, more than likely conservative Republicans will join `em, and all our work, all our preparing the ground for the vote, laid waste, for naught
The Blairs have promised support for the amendment if we listen to these people - Oh, the Blairs promise, do they
You think they'll keep their promise once we have heard these delegates and refused them
Which we will have to do, since their proposal most certainly will be predicated on keeping their slaves
What hope for any Democratic votes, Willum, if word gets out that 've refused a chance to end the war
You think word won't get out
In Washington
It's either the amendment or this Confederate peace, you cannot have both
"If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow and which will not, Speak then to me
" Oh, disaster
This is a disaster
50
Time is a great thickener of things, Willum
Yes,  suppose it is - Actually have no idea what you mean by that
Lincoln stands
Get me thirteen votes
(in a thick Kentucky :) Them fellers from Richmond ain't here yit
- The ambulance has come to a stop
The rear door opens and the soldiers immediately hop out
The commissioners squint, blinded, into the dazzling sunlight, at the River Queen, Grant's side-wheel steamer, docked on the banks of the James River
: , 12 ' ,       - Tad, in fancy military uniform, sits on the bed, Gardener's box of glass negatives open beside him
He holds up a plate to a lamp: An old black man with a thick beard and hair, shirtless
Tad looks at another plate: young black woman, headscarf, huge ugly scar across her cheek and down her neck
He studies these with solemn concentration
(
) You drafted half the men in Boston
What do you think their families think about me
51
Lincoln is being dressed in formal wear by his valet, , a light-skinned black man in his 40s
Robert, already in his morning suit, is standing by the door
(') The only reason they don't throw things and spit on me is `cause you're so popular
can't concentrate on, on British mercantile law,  don't care about British mercantile law
might not even want to be a lawyer - It's a sturdy profession, and a useful one
Yes, and  want to be useful, but now, not afterwards
Slade hands Lincoln his formal gloves
ain't wearing them things, Mr
Slade, they never fit right
The missus will have you wear `em
Don't think about leaving `em
You're delaying, that's your favorite tactic
(to Robert:) You won't tell me no, but the Be useful and stop war will be over in a month, distracting him
and you know it will
( :) 've found that prophesying is one of life's less prophet-able occupations
He accepts the gloves
Slade laughs a little, Robert scowls
Tad holds another glass negative up to the light
Why do some slaves cost more than others
52
If they're still young and healthy, if the women can still conceive, they'll pay more - Put `em back in the box
We'll return them to Mr
Gardner's studio day after next
Be careful with `em, now
(tugging at his gloves:) These things should've stayed on the calf
(to Slade, putting the :) When you were a slave, Mr
Slade, did they beat you

Nobody beat me except  beat them right back
There's a knock on the door and Mrs
Keckley enters
Mr
Lincoln, could you come with me- ( :) Mrs
Keckley was a slave
Ask her if she was beaten
Were you - (shakes his head) Tad
( :) was beaten with a fire shovel when  was younger than you
( :) You should go to Mrs
Lincoln
She's in Willie's room
She never goes in there
Lincoln starts towards the door just as John Hay enters, dressed in the uniform of a Brevet Colonel
53
The reception line is already stretching out the door
Robert shoots an angry, envious glance at Hay's uniform as Lincoln, Slade, Mrs
Keckley and Hay leave
Robert calls to : 'll be the only man over fifteen and under sixty-five in this whole place not in uniform
'm under fifteen and  have a uniform
Robert storms out
- Lincoln enters a dark room, its heavy drapes closed against the dim afternoon light
There are two beds
One is stripped bare
The other is canopied with a thick black veil
Mary, dressed in a deep purple gown with black flowers and beading, perfectly pitched between mourning and emergence, is seated at the head of the canopied bed
On a nightstand next to the bed there's a toy locomotive engine, a tattered book of & railroad schedules
Mary holds a framed photograph: an image of , 12, handsome, bright-eyed, confident
Lincoln crosses to the window
My head hurts so
() prayed for death the night Willie died
The headaches are how  know didn't get my wish
How to endure the long afternoon and deep into the night
know
Trying not to think about him
How will  manage
Somehow you will
54
( :) Somehow
Somehow
Somehow
Every party, every
And now, four years more in this terrible house reproaching us
He was a very sick little boy
We should've cancelled that reception, shouldn't we
We didn't know how sick he was
knew,  knew,  saw that night he was dying
Three years ago, the war was going so badly, and we had to put on a face
But  saw Willie was dying
saw - He bends and kisses her hand
Molly
It's too hard
Too hard
Mary stares up at him, her face heavy and swollen with grief
,   - Mary, radiant, her charm turned to its brightest candlepower, is greeting the Blairs, who are part of a long receiving line
The Blairs proceed from Mary to Lincoln
: 15 The enormous room is splendid, decked with garlands of flowers, tall candelabra burning, flags from Army divisions
An orchestra plays
Lincoln and Tad stand together
Slade is near Lincoln
Mary's a distance away from Lincoln, to his right
Robert takes his place next to his mother, as conspicuous as he'd feared he'd be in his civilian clothes
55
sea of people surround the President and his family
Nicolay, Hay and several clerks channel the crowd waiting to greet the Lincolns into the line: wealthy people, many more middle-class people, some working people and farmers, and many officers and soldiers
Tad watches his father shake hands
Lincoln is in his element
He stands close to each person, touches each one gently, stoops to be nearer them; he puts everyone at ease
He's bothered only by the white kid gloves he's wearing
He tugs at the right-hand glove
(with a glance in Mary's) She's just ten feet yonder
'd like to keep my job
Lincoln takes off the right-hand glove - his hand-shaking hand - but keeps the other glove on
Approaching Mary on the line, Stevens, Ashley, Senators Bluff Wade and  , all in formal wear except Stevens
Senator Sumner, it has been much too long
"Oh, who can look on that celestial face and -" Cutting him off, she pretends not to recognize Ashley
And
() James Ashley, ma'am, we've met several times - But she ignores him and greets Stevens
(her Southern accent becoming more lustrous:) Praise Heavens, praise Heavens, just when  had abandoned hope of amusement, it's the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee
Stevens bows to her
56
Mrs
Lincoln
Madame President if you please
() Oh, don't convene another subcommittee to investigate me, sir
'm teasing
Smile, Senator Wade
( :) believe  am smiling, Mrs
Lincoln
'll take your word for that, sir
As long as your household accounts are in order, Madame, we'll have no need to investigate them
You have always taken such a lively, even prosecutorial interest in my household accounts
Your household accounts have always been so interesting
Yes, thank you, it's true, the miracles  have wrought out of fertilizer bills and cutlery invoices
But  had to
Four years ago, when the President and arrived, this was pure pigsty
Tobacco stains in the turkey carpets
Mushrooms, green as the moon, sprouting from ceilings
And a pauper's pittance allotted for improvements
As if your committee joined with all of Washington awaiting, in what you anticipated would be our comfort in squalor, further proof that my husband and were prairie primitives, unsuited to the position to which an error of the people, a flaw in the democratic process, had elevated us
57
Lincoln, suddenly without anyone in line to receive, looks to see the backlog forming behind the radicals
He notes the exchange, but says nothing
Robert sees him looking
(') The past is the past, it's a new year now and we are all getting along, or so they tell me
gather we are working together
The White House and the other House
Hatching little plans together
Robert leans in to her
Mother
What
You're creating a bottleneck
Oh
( :) Oh, 'm detaining you, and more important, the people behind you
How the people love my husband, they flock to see him, by their thousands on public days
They will never love you the way they love him
How difficult it must be for you to know that
And yet how important to remember it
She gives him a slight, lethal smile
He holds the look; his poker-face yields to a barely perceptible smile, amused and perhaps a little admiring
- The kitchen's piled with unwashed cookware, eggshells, flour bins, muffin and pastry molds, spoons and knives, the detritus of the preparations for the finger food served at the reception, which has now transitioned into a dance and is still underway upstairs
Music, the tramp of dancing feet and rhythmic clapping is audible
carrying a huge tray laden with dishes and cups comes down the stairs
He hastily beats a retreat when he sees Lincoln and Thaddeus Stevens quietly talking amid the mess
58
Since we have the floor next in the debate,  thought 'd suggest you might
temper your contributions so as not to frighten our conservative friends
Ashley insists you're ensuring approval by dispensing patronage to otherwise undeserving Democrats
can't ensure a single damn thing if you scare the whole House with talk of land appropriations and revolutionary tribunals and punitive thisses and thats - When the war ends,  intend to push for full equality, the Negro vote and much more
Congress shall mandate the seizure of every foot of rebel land and every dollar of their property
We'll use their confiscated wealth to establish hundreds of thousands of free Negro farmers, and at their side soldiers armed to occupy and transform the heritage of traitors
We'll build up a land down there of free men and free women and free children and freedom
The nation needs to know that we have such plans
That's the untempered version of reconstruction
It's not
It's not exactly what  intend, but we shall oppose one another in the course of time
Now we're working together, and 'm asking you - For patience,  expect
When the people disagree, bringing them together requires going slow till they're ready to make up - 59
Ah, shit on the people and what they want and what they're ready for
don't give a goddamn about the people and what they want
This is the face of someone who has fought long and hard for the good of the people without caring much for any of `em
And  look a lot worse without the wig
The people elected me
To represent them
To lead them
And  lead
You ought to try it
admire your zeal, Mr
Stevens, and  have tried to profit from the example of it
But if 'd listened to you, 'd've declared every slave free the minute the first shell struck Fort Sumter; then the border states would've gone over to the confederacy, the war would've been lost and the Union along with it, and instead of abolishing slavery, as we hope to do, in two weeks, we'd be watching helpless as infants as it spread from the American South into South America
Stevens glares at him, then smiles
Oh, how you have longed to say that to me
You claim you trust them - but you know what the people are
You know that the inner compass that should direct the soul toward justice has ossified in white men and women, north and south, unto utter uselessness through tolerating the evil of slavery
White people cannot bear the thought of sharing this country's infinite abundance with Negroes
Lincoln reaches over to Stevens and gives his shoulder a vigorous shake
Stevens endures this
compass,  learnt when  was surveying, it'll - it'll point you True North from where you're standing, but it's got no advice 60
about the swamps and deserts and chasms that you'll encounter along the way
If in pursuit of your destination you plunge ahead, heedless of obstacles, and achieve nothing more than to sink in a swamp, what's the use of knowing True North
' ,    - Spectacles on, Lincoln unlaces Mary's corset
Robert's going to plead with us to let him enlist
He's unlaced enough; she unhooks the front and steps out of her corset and petticoats, turns to him in her plain thin chemise and drawers
Make time to talk to Robbie
You only have time for Tad
Tad's young
So's Robert
Too young for the army
Plenty of boys younger than Robert signing up
Don't take Robbie
Don't let me lose my son
There's a knock on the door
Mary turns to it, furious: (') Go away
We're occupied
Lincoln opens the door
Nicolay's standing there
Secretary Stanton has sent over to tell you that as of half an hour ago, the shelling of Wilmington harbor has commenced
61
Lincoln leaves with Nicolay
Mary watches, frozen, unable to let him go, knowing she can't stop him
,   - The telegraph office looks improvised, even after four years
Formerly the War Department library, it's lined with bookcases stuffed with bundled dispatches
Telegraph cables stretch across the ceiling to the cipher-operators' desks
Stanton, perpetually exhausted and impatient, storms down the stairs with Welles and the chief telegraph operator, , 40, in his wake
They cannot possibly maintain under this kind of an assault
Terry's got ten thousand men surrounding the Goddamned fort
Why doesn't he answer my cables
Fort Fisher is a mountain of It's the largest fort they a building, Edwin
Twenty-two have, sir
They've been big seacoast guns on each reinforcing it for the last rampart - two years - They reach the desks for the key operators
Among these, , 25, and the key manager,   , 22, sit at their silent keys, waiting to receive news
Stanton scribbles furiously on Beckwith's small notepad
(') They've taken 17,000 shells since yesterday
The commander is an old goat
want to hear that Fort Fisher's ours and Wilmington has fallen
They said - (') Send another damn cable
Stanton thrusts the cable at Beckwith, who taps it out immediately
Stanton turns to a table where the large map of Wilmington from the Cabinet meeting is laid out, heavily scribbled-on
, assistant Secretary of the Navy, and , Stanton's clerk, are checking the marks on the map against a stack of dispatches
62
(') The problem's their commander, Whiting
He engineered the fortress himself
The damned thing's his child; he'll defend it till his every last man is gone
He is not thinking rationally, he's - (
) (hollering
) "Come on out, you old rat
" Everyone's startled, and confused
They all turn to Lincoln, who sits in Major Eckert's chair, wrapped in his shawl
(') That's what Ethan Allen called to the commander of Fort Ticonderoga in 1776
"Come on out, you old rat
" `Course there were only forty- odd redcoats at Ticonderoga
But, but there is one Ethan Allen story that 'm very partial to - No
No, you're, you're going to tell a story
don't believe that can bear to listen to another one of your stories right now
Stanton stalks out, shouting down the corridor as he goes: (') need the & sideyard schedules for Alexandria
asked for them this morning
Lincoln pays no attention to Stanton's fulminations and continues with his story
It was right after the Revolution, right after peace had been concluded, and Ethan Allen went to London to help our new country conduct its business with the king
The English sneered at how rough we are, and rude and simple-minded and on like that, everywhere he went, till one day he was invited to the townhouse of a great English lord
Dinner was served, beverages imbibed, time passed, as happens, and Mr
Allen found he needed the 63
privy
He was grateful to be directed thence - relieved you might say
Everyone laughs
(') Now, Mr
Allen discovered on entering the water closet that the only decoration therein was a portrait of George Washington
Ethan Allen done what he came to do and returned to the drawing room
His host and the others were disappointed when he didn't mention Washington's portrait
And finally His Lordship couldn't resist, and asked Mr
Allen had he noticed it, the picture of Washington
He had
Well, what did he think of its placement, did it seem appropriately located to Mr
Allen
Mr
Allen said it did
His host was astounded
Appropriate
George Washington's likeness in a water closet
Yes, said Mr
Allen, where it'll do good service: the whole world knows nothing'll make an Englishman shit quicker than the sight of George Washington
Everyone laughs
(') love that story
Beckwith's and Bates's keys starts clicking
They transcribe furiously
There's a general rush to the operators' desks
Lincoln walks quickly over, and is joined there by Stanton, who arrives just as the first dispatch has been completed and is being decoded
Stanton and Lincoln hold hands, as they've done many times, waiting for news of the battle
Bates hands the decoded cable to Benjamin, who reads it quickly, then announces to the room: Fort Fisher is ours
We've taken the port
And Wilmington
64
Eckert shakes his head as Beckwith hands him the next telegram
We've taken the fort, but the city of Wilmington has not surrendered
beat as this sinks in
Then: How many casualties
Eckert looks up at Stanton and Lincoln, stricken
- One representative's reading a paper with the headline: , followed by hundreds of names
Pendleton and Wood are conferring
Heavy losses
And more to come
Sours the national mood
That might suffice to discourage him - To what
To bring this down
Not in a fight like this
This is to the death
It's gruesome
( :) Are you despairing, or merely lazy
This fight is for The United States of America
Nothing "suffices" rumor
Nothing
They're not lazy
They're busily buying votes
While we hope to be saved by "the national mood
" He looks over at Stevens, who's at his desk consulting with Ashley and Julian
65
(') Before this blood is dry, when Stevens next takes the floor, taunt him - you excel at that - get him to proclaim what we all know he believes in his coal-colored heart: that this vote is meant to set the black race on high, to niggerate America
George, please
Stay on course
Bring Stevens to full froth

Colfax gavels the chamber to order, as George Yeaman approaches the podium
The floor belongs to the mellifluent gentleman from Kentucky, Mr
George Yeaman
thank you, Speaker Colfax
The Democrats applaud as Yeaman takes his place at the podium and surveys the chamber
(') Although 'm disgusted by slavery rise on this sad and solemn day to announce that 'm opposed to the amendment
We must consider what will become of colored folk if four million are in one instant set free
Cheers and boos
They'll be free, George
That's what'll become of them
What'll become of any of us
That's what being free means
Schell, Latham, and Bilbo are perched in their usual gallery seats, taking notes
66
Think how splendid if Mr
Yeaman switched
(shaking his head:) Too publicly against us
He can't change course now
Not for some miserable little job anyways
And, and
We will be forced to enfranchise the men of the colored race - it would be inhuman not to
Who among us is prepared to give Negroes the vote
He's momentarily silenced by cheers and boos throughout the chamber
(') And, and
What shall follow upon that
Universal enfranchisement
Votes for women
Yeaman is stopped, baffled and dismayed by the explosion he's provoked
,   - Hawkins enters and stops when he sees Pendleton and Wood
It's a trap
LeClerk follows, closing the door
Bless my eyes, if it isn't the Post Master of Millersburg Ohio
Hawkins looks at LeClerk, who guiltily avoids his glance
Mr
LeClerk felt honor-bound to inform us
Of your disgusting betrayal
Your prostitution
Is that true, Postmaster Hawkins
Is your maidenly virtue for sale
Hawkins sinks

- Bilbo and Clay Hawkins are again in the woods
Bilbo, with his basket, clutches a pair of noisy snared partridges
My neighbors hear that  voted yes for nigger freedom and no to peace, they will kill me
deal's a deal and you men know better than to piss your pants just cause there's talk about peace talks
(') My neighbors in Nashville, Look, 'll find another job

Hawkins runs away from Bilbo
Bilbo chases him

But  got no courage
Hawkins runs away, sobbing
Bilbo pursues
Wait
You wanted, what was it, tax man for the Western Reserve, hell you can have the whole state of Ohio if you - Bilbo stops, winded
(') Aw, crap

Eleven votes
Two days ago we had twelve
What happened
It's the goddamned rumors There are defections in the regarding the Richmond ranks
Yes
The peace delegation

Groundless
told you that
And yet the rumors persist
They are ruining us
Among the few remaining representatives who seem remotely plausible there is a perceptible increase in resistance
Seward has reached the carriage, Bilbo alongside him
Before the Secretary of State can climb on board, Bilbo shuts the carriage door
Seward is outraged
Resistance, hell
Thingamabob Hollister, Dem from Indiana approached him, the sumbitch near to murdered me
- Bilbo is talking to   (, ), who pulls out a derringer
Bilbo bolts, dropping the folder
He stops, runs back, and bends to retrieve the folio as Hollister fires the gun over Bilbo's head
,    - Seward, now inside the carriage, slams the door
Perhaps you push too hard
push nobody
Perhaps we need reinforcements
If Jeff Davis wants to cease hostilities, who do you think'll give a genuine solid shit to free slaves
69
Get back to it, and good day, gentlemen
Schell and Latham lean in to the carriage
We are at an impasse
Tell Lincoln to deny the rumors
Publicly
Tell us what you expect of us
expect you to do your work
And to have sufficient sense and taste not to presume to instruct the President

Schell steps up on the running board, intent
Is there a Confederate offer or not
,  - , 43, 5'7", beard, uniform worn and rumpled, crosses the dock, followed by three aides
They approach the gangway for the River Queen
,  ,  - Grant and the commissioners stand in an expansive cabin at the stern, patriotically decorated, large windows
Grant hands the commissioners' peace proposal back to them
He's scribbled notes all over the document
suggest you work some changes to your proposal before you give it to the President
We're eager to be on our way to Washington
70
Did Mr
Lincoln tell you to tell us this, General Grant
Grant fixes Stephens with a look - bemused, a little disappointed
It says
"securing peace for our two countries
" And it goes on like that
don't know what you - There's just one country
You and , we're citizens of that country
'm fighting to protect it from armed rebels
From you
But Mr
Blair told us, he, he told President Davis we were - private citizen like Preston Blair can say what he pleases, since he has no authority over anything
If you want to discuss peace with President Lincoln, consider revisions

If we're not to discuss a truce between warring nations, what in heaven's name can we discuss
Terms of surrender

After four years of war and near 600,000 lives lost
He believes we can end this war now
My trust in him is marrow deep
Seward looks up at Lincoln, then down again at the telegram
He stands and crosses to Lincoln
You could bring the delegates to Washington
In exchange for the South's immediate surrender, we could promise them the amendment's defeat
They'd agree, don't you think
We'd end the war
This week
Lincoln has closed his eyes
72
(') Or
If you could manage, without seeming to do it, to - Lincoln shakes his head "no

Particularly with the fighting around Wilmington
Within ten days time, we might pass the Thirteenth Amendment
,    - Lincoln, shawl still wrapped around him, walks the long empty hall
' ,   - Lincoln sits before an open window
He's dishevelled, in shirtsleeves an unbuttoned vest, next to an inkwell, papers and books of law scattered about, and a lit candle in a candlestick, guttering
Grant's telegraph is in one hand, and in the other hand, his spectacles and, dangling from a chain, his open pocket watch
His bare left foot keeps time with the watch's loud ticking
He stares out into the cold night
'  - The room is spare and neat
Nicolay and Hay are asleep in their beds
Lincoln is sitting at the foot of Hay's bed, spectacles on, reading a petition, the others in his lap, pencil in hand
Now, here's a sixteen year old boy
They're going to hang him
Hay startles awake, then settles
He's used to this
(') (he reads a little :) He was with the 15th Indiana Calvary near Beaufort, seems he lamed his horse to avoid battle
don't think even Stanton would 73
complain if  pardoned him
You think Stanton would complain
Nicolay stirs in the next bed
Ummm
don't know, sir,  don't know who you're, uh
What time is it
It's three forty in the morning
(not waking up:) Don't
let him pardon any more deserters
Nicolay's asleep again
Mr
Stanton thinks you pardon too many
He's generally apoplectic on the subject - He oughtn't to have done that, crippled his horse, that was cruel, but you don't just hang a sixteen year old boy for that - Ask the horse what he thinks
- for cruelty
There'd be no sixteen year old boys left
(a beat, then:) Grant wants me to bring the secesh delegates to Washington
So
There are secesh delegates
(scribbling a note, signing the petition:) He was afraid, that's all it was
don't care to hang a boy for being frightened, either
What good would it do him
He signs the pardon
Then he gives Hay's leg a few hard thwacks and a squeeze
It hurts a little
Hay winces
74
(') War's nearly done
Ain't that so
What use one more corpse
Any more corpses
Putting the rest of the petitions on Hay's bed, he stands to leave
Do you need company
,    - As before, Lincoln continues his slow and solitary walk
(
) Times like this, 'm best alone
,   - - Lincoln is seated at Eckert's desk, shawl wrapped around his shoulders, glasses on; he stares down into his hat, held between his knees
Homer Bates and Sam Beckwith are waiting for him
Lincoln draws a handwritten note from his hat and carefully unfolds it
"Lieutenant General Ulysses
Grant, City Point
have read your words with interest
" Sam Beckwith transcribes Lincoln's words into code on a pad with a pencil
(') " ask that, regardless of any action  take in the matter of the visit of the Richmond commissioners, you maintain among your troops military preparedness for battle, as you have done until now
" He stops for a moment
Beckwith waits, pencil poised
Lincoln looks at the note, folds it, tucks it in a band inside his hat
75
(') "Have Captain Saunders convey the commissioners to me here in Washington
" ( ) "
Lincoln
" And the date
( :) Yes sir
Lincoln places the hat on the floor
(') Shall  transmit, sir
(a beat, then:) You think we choose to be born
don't suppose so
Are we fitted to the times we're born into
don't know about myself
You may be, sir
Fitted
( :) What do you reckon
'm an engineer
reckon there's machinery but no one's done the fitting
You're an engineer, you must know Euclid's axioms and common notions
must've in school, but
never had much of schooling, but read Euclid, in an old book borrowed
Little enough ever found its way in here - (touching his cranium) - but once learnt it stayed learnt
76
Euclid's first common notion is this: "Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other
" Homer doesn't get it; neither does Sam
(') That's a rule of mathematical reasoning
It's true because it works; has done and always will do
In his book, Euclid says this is "self-evident
" ( ) 'you see
There it is, even in that two-thousand year old book of mechanical law: it is a self- evident truth that things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other
We begin with equality
That's the origin, isn't it
That balance, that's fairness, that's justice
He looks at his scribbled note, then at Sam and Homer
(') Read me the last sentence of my telegram
"Have Captain Saunders convey the commissioners to me here in Washington
" slight emendation, Sam, if you would
Beckwith writes as Lincoln dictates
(') "Have Captain Saunders convey the gentlemen aboard the River Queen as far as Hampton Roads, Virginia, and there wait until

Do not proceed to Washington

,   - The chamber's noisy and packed
In the balcony's front row, a wall of newspapermen, notebooks at the ready
: 27 Ashley, Colfax, and Stevens approach Stevens's desk
Colfax nods towards the journalists in the balcony: The World, the Herald and the Times, New York, Chicago, the Journal of Commerce, even your hometown paper's here
( :) Say you believe only in legal equality for all races, not racial equality,  beg you, sir
Compromise
Or you risk it all
Stevens sees Mary, with Mrs
Keckley, claiming front seats from two journalists
,   - Stevens, at the podium, is being challenged by Fernando Wood, standing at his desk
've asked you a question, Mr
Stevens, and you must answer me
Do you or do you not hold that the precept that "all men are created equal" is meant literally
All eyes are on Stevens, the chamber quiet except for a scratching sound: the journalists have begun scribbling
(') Is that not the true purpose of the amendment
To promote your ultimate and ardent dream to elevate - The true purpose of the amendment, Mr
Wood, you perfectly-named, brainless, obstructive object
78
You have always insisted, Mr
Stevens, that Negroes are the same as white men are
The true purpose of the amendment - Stevens looks up at the balcony, at the waiting journalists, and Mary, who raises her eyebrows, then at Ashley and Litton at their desks
Seward watches from the balcony
Stevens returns to Wood
(') don't hold with equality in all things only with equality before the law and nothing more
(:) That's not so
You believe that Negroes are entirely equal to white men
You've said it a thousand - (leaping to his feet) For shame
For shame
Stop prevaricating and answer Representative Wood
don't hold with equality in (stands:) all things, only with After the decades of fervent equality before the law and advocacy on behalf of the nothing more
colored race - ( :) He's answered your questions
This amendment has naught to do with race equality
Pendleton persists, through cheers and catcalls
You have long insisted, have  don't hold with equality in you not, that the dusk- all things only with equality colored race is no different before the law and nothing from the white one
more
79
Among the amendment's supporters, including Vintner Litton, a in the balcony, and Elizabeth Keckley, there's visible, audible shock and dismay at Stevens's capitulation
Mary's surprised by Stevens, and impressed
(whispering to Mrs
:) Who'd ever've guessed that old nightmare capable of such control
He might make a politician someday - ( :) need to go
Mary's startled
Mrs
Keckley leaves the balcony, pushing past journalists
On the floor: Your frantic attempt to delude us now is unworthy of a representative
It is, in fact, unworthy of a white man
(giving in to his anger:) How can  hold that all men are created equal, when here before me - (pointing to Pendleton:) - stands stinking the moral carcass of the gentleman from Ohio, proof that some men are inferior, endowed by their Maker with dim wits impermeable to reason with cold pallid slime in their veins instead of hot red blood
You are more reptile than man, George, so low and flat that the foot of man is incapable of crushing you
General uproar
Yet even you, Pendleton, who should have been gibbetted for treason long before today, even worthless unworthy you ought to be treated equally before the law
And so again, sir, and again and again and 80
again  say: Ashley sits, nearly weeping with relief, while the chamber explodes: laughter, applause, boos
, - The journalists pack up their notebooks; this is fun, but not newsworthy, and only a few bother to record it
Stevens limps out through the aisle to wild Republican applause
He looks up to the balcony; Mary is looking down approvingly
He looks down before she can see him smile
- Stevens sits on a bench, alone, thinking, troubled
Asa Vintner Litton approaches him
You asked if ever  was surprised
Stevens nods
(') Today, Mr
Stevens,  was surprised
You've led the battle for race equality for thirty years
The basis of, of every hope for this country's future life, you denied Negro equality
'm nauseated
You refused to say that all humans are, well
human
Have you lost your very soul, Mr
Stevens
Is there nothing you won't say
Stevens nods, then, quietly: 'm sorry you're nauseous, Asa, that must be unpleasant
want the amendment to pass
So that the Constitution's first and only mention of slavery is its absolute prohibition
For this amendment, for which  have worked all of my life and for which 81
countless colored men and women have fought and died and now hundreds of thousands of soldiers - no, sir, no, it seems there is very nearly nothing  won't say
- Lincoln and Robert are in the buggy driven by the old soldier; a young bodyguard soldier sits beside the driver, his rifle uselessly tucked under his legs
Lincoln is on one side reading over a stack of documents
Robert's on the other side of the buggy, staring sullenly at his feet
The buggy stops outside an army hospital
Lincoln packs up his papers
'm not going in
You said you wanted to help me
This is - This is just a clumsy attempt at discouragement
've been to army hospitals, 've seen surgeries,  went and visited the malaria barges with mama
She told me she didn't take you inside
snuck in after - 've seen what it's like
This changes nothing
At all rates, 'm happy to have your company
Stepping out of the buggy, he hands his folio to the bodyguard and enters the army hospital
- He's met in the antechamber by an
Morning, Jim
82
Hello, Mr
President
Good to see you again
They move into the main ward, Lincoln removing his hat
(') Well, boys, first question: You getting enough to eat
He walks from bed to bed, shaking hands with each patient
Most are amputees
Hello, sir
What's your name, soldier
Robert
Robert
Good to meet you, Robert
Nice to meet you
What's your name
Kevin
Tell me your names as  go past like to know who 'm talkin' to
Kevin
Mr
President
John
John
've seen you before
Mr
President
- Robert, brooding, waits in the buggy
83
Hearing a creaking, rumbling sound, Robert turns to see in grey uniforms wrangling a large top-heavy wheelbarrow, covered with filthy canvas
One orderly pushes while the other keeps the barrow from tipping over
Robert notices, in the barrow's wake, a trail of blood
He gets out of the buggy and follows as the orderlies turn a corner of the building
Behind the building, where the ground is bare, pitted with puddles of water, Robert watches as the orderlies reach the edge of a shallow pit
One orderly pulls the canvas back, revealing severed legs, arms, hands, rotten, burnt, shattered by bullet or bomb
Robert watches as they toss the remains into the pit
Quicklime is shoveled atop the limbs
Robert walks away, unsteady
Around the corner, he fumbles through his pockets for rolling paper and tobacco
He locates these and tries to focus on rolling a cigarette, his hands shaking
He tries harder to control his hands, his feelings, but he can't
He has a panic attack, crying, hiccupy shallow breathing, face flushed
Frustrated, he throws down the cigarette and tries to hold back tears
(
) What's the matter, Bob
Robert looks up, mortified, to see Lincoln watching him with concern
He wipes his eyes, his mouth
have to do this
And  will do it and  don't need your permission to enlist
That same speech has been made by how many sons to how many fathers since the war began
" don't need your damn permission, you miserable old goat, 'm gonna enlist anyhow
" And what wouldn't those numberless fathers have given to be able to say to their sons - as  now say to mine - "'m commander-in-chief, so in point of fact, without my permission, you ain't enlisting in nothing, nowhere, young man
" 84
It's mama you're scared of, not me getting killed
Lincoln slaps Robert in the face
It shocks them both
Lincoln tries to embrace Robert, but Robert shoulders past him and walks back toward the front of he building
He turns
(') have to do this
And  will
Or will feel ashamed of myself for the rest of my life
Whether or not you fought is what's gonna matter
And not just to other people, but to myself
won't be you, pa
can't do that
But  don't want to be nothing
He hurries away
We can't lose you
' ,       - Outside, driving rain and wind
Lincoln sits by the window, in his coat, vest and tie, hair combed neatly
He'll be fine, Molly
City Point's far from the front lines, from the fighting, he'll be an adjutant running messages for General Grant
Mary sits at her vanity in a beautiful evening dress, pale with rage
The war will take our son sniper, or a shrapnel shell
Or typhus, same as took Willie, it takes hundreds of boys a day
He'll die, uselessly, and how will  ever forgive you
Most men, their firstborn is their favorite, but you, you've always blamed Robert for being born, for trapping you in a marriage that's only ever given you grief and caused you regret
85
That's not true - And if the slaughter of Cold Harbor is on your hands same as Grant, God help us
We'll pay for the oceans of spilled blood you've sanctioned, the uncountable corpses we'll be made to pay with our son's dear - Lincoln rises from the window seat, angry
Just, just this once, Mrs
Lincoln, demand of you to try and take the liberal and not the selfish point of view
You imagine Robert will forgive us if we continue to stifle his very natural ambition
(with a mocking smile:) And if  refuse to take the high road, if  won't take up the rough old cross, will you threaten me again with the madhouse, as you did when  couldn't stop crying over Willie, when  showed you what heartbreak, real heartbreak looked like, and you hadn't the courage to countenance it, to help me - That's right
When you  was in the room with refused so much as to comfort Willie,  was holding him in Tad - my arms as he died
- the child who was not only How dare you
sick, dangerously sick, but beside himself with grief
Oh but your grief, your How dare you throw that at grief, your inexhaustible me
grief
86
And his mother won't let him  couldn't let Tad in near her, `cause she's couldn't risk him seeing how screaming from morning to angry  was
night pacing the corridors, howling at shadows and furniture and ghosts
ought to have done it,  ought have done for Tad's sake, for everybody's goddamned sake, should have clapped you in the madhouse
(') Do it
Don't you threaten me, you do it this time
Lock me away
You'll have to, swear, if Robert is killed
Silence
Then: couldn't tolerate you grieving so for Willie because  couldn't permit it in myself, though wanted to, Mary
wanted to crawl under the earth, into the vault with his coffin
still do
Every day  do
Don't
talk to me about grief
(:) must make my decisions, Bob must make his, you yours
And bear what we must, hold and carry what we must
What  carry within me - you must allow me to do it, alone as must
And you alone, Mary, you alone may lighten this burden, or render it intolerable
As you choose
She opens her mouth to make an angry reply, then stops, and watches as he leaves the room
' ,  - Onstage, Gounod's Faust, Act Three, scene eight, the garden outside Marguerite's cottage, a gorgeously romantic night
and  are alone singing
The Lincolns, in their box, watch quietly
Elizabeth Keckley sits next to Mary
87
Mary turns to Lincoln
They speak in whispers
Mrs
Keckley tries not to listen but she can't help hearing what they say
You think 'm ignorant of what you're up to because you haven't discussed this scheme with me as you ought to have done
When have ever been so easily bamboozled
() believe you when you insist that amending the constitution and abolishing slavery will end this war
And since you are sending my son into the war, woe unto you if you fail to pass the amendment
Seward doesn't want me leaving big muddy footprints all over town
No one ever lived who knows better than you the proper placement of footfalls on treacherous paths
Seward can't do it
You must
Because if you fail to secure the necessary votes, woe unto you, sir
You will answer to me
- The carriage has pulled up and Mary is entering the White House
Lincoln helps Mrs
Keckley down from the carriage
She hesitates before proceeding in
Then she faces Lincoln
know the vote is only four days away;  know you're concerned
Thank you for your concern over this, and  want you to know: They'll approve it
God will see to it
don't envy him his task
He may wish He'd chosen an instrument for His purpose more wieldy than the House of Representatives
Then you'll see to it
88
Lincoln looks at her, considering
Then: Are you afraid of what lies ahead
For your people
If we succeed
White people don't want us here
Many don't
What about you
don't know you, Mrs
Keckley
Any of you
You're
familiar to me, as all people are
Unaccommodated, poor, bare, forked creatures such as we all are
You have a right to expect what expect, and likely our expectations are not incomprehensible to each other
assume 'll get used to you
But what you are to the nation, what'll become of you once slavery's day is done,  don't know
What my people are to be,  can't say
Negroes have been fighting and dying for freedom since the first of us was a slave
never heard any ask what freedom will bring
Freedom's first
As for me: My son died, fighting for the Union, wearing the Union blue
For freedom he died
'm his mother
That's what  am to the nation, Mr
Lincoln
What else must  be
- The room is far filthier and more cluttered than before
Bilbo and Latham are playing cards
Schell is asleep in bed
My whole hand's gonna be proud in about five seconds, let's see how proud you gonna be
89
Oh, it is
What you got goin'
There's a quick knock on the door
Yeah
Go away
( ) That watch fob, is that gold
You keep your eyes off my fob
Seward enters, displeased, as they show their cards, laughing
Nines paired
Oh my God damn
Gentlemen
You have a visitor
Latham jovially collects his winnings
He stops short when Lincoln steps into the room, cloak and stovepipe, very tall
Well, 'll be fucked
wouldn't bet against it, Mr
Schell startles awake as Bilbo puts down his cigar and wipes his hand on his vest
Bilbo
Mr
Bilbo
Gentlemen
Sir
Why are you here
No offense, but Mr
Seward's banished the very mention of your name, he won't even 90
let us use fifty-cent pieces `cause they got your face on `em
The Secretary of State here tells me that, uh, you got eleven Democrats in the bag
That's encouraging
Oh, you've got no cause to be encouraged
Sir
Uh
Are we being
fired
Lincoln sits at the card table
"We have heard the chimes of midnight, Master Shallow
" 'm here to alert you boys that the great day of reckoning is nigh upon us
The Democrats we've yet to bag, sir
The patronage jobs simply won't bag `em
They require more
convincing, Mr
President
Lincoln nods
He turns to Bilbo
Mm-hmm
Do me a favor, willya
Sure
Snagged my eye in the paper this morning
Governor Curtin is set to declare a winner in the disputed Congressional election for the - Pennsylvania 16th District
What a joy to be comprehended
Hop on a train to Philadell, call on the Governor - 91
(looking askance at ' :) Send Latham
Or Schell
( :) No, he'll do fine, just polish yourself up first
Bilbo, cigar back in mouth, laughs
The incumbent is claiming he won it
Name of, uh
Coffroth
That's him
Coffroth
He is a Democrat
understand he is
Silly name
Let Governor Curtin know it'd be much appreciated if he'd invite the House of Representatives to decide who won
He's entitled to do that
He'll agree to it
( :) Then advise Coffroth, if he hopes to retain his seat, that he'd better pay a visit to Thaddeus Stevens
Pity poor Coffroth
' ,   - Stevens is at his desk, paperwork piled high
There's a knock at the door
It opens
nervous man enters hesitantly: Alexander Coffroth
92
Stevens glares at him with what looks like horror
Coffroth's frightened smile transforms into a rictus of pain
Then: (') You are Canfrey
Coffroth, Mr
Stevens, Alexander Coffroth, 'm, 'm - () Are we representatives of the same state
-yes sir
We sit only three desks - Stevens waves him into a chair
haven't noticed you
'm a Republican, and you, Coughdrop, are a Democrat
Well,
Um, that is to say
- The modern travesty of Thomas Jefferson's political organization to which you have attached yourself like a barnacle has the effrontery to call itself The Democratic Party
You are a Dem-o-crat
What's the matter with you
Are you wicked
Well,  felt, um, formerly,  - Never mind, Coffsnot
You were ignominiously trounced at the hustings in November's election by your worthy challenger, a - No, sir,  was not, um, trounced
Uh, he wants to steal my seat didn't lose the election - 93
What difference does it make if you lost or not
The governor of our state, is
Democrat
No, he's a
(baffled, terrified:) , um, a Ruh
Re
Re
() Pub
Pub
Li
Li
Can
Can
Republican
know what he is
This is a rhetorical exercise
And Congress is controlled by what party
Yours
Coffroth doesn't know whether to answer
He shakes his head
(') Your party was beaten, your challenger's party now controls the House, and hence the House Committee on Elections, so you have been beaten
You shall shortly be sent home in disgrace
Unless
94
know what  must do, sir
will immediately become a Republican and vote yes for - Coffroth will vote yes but Coffroth will remain a Democrat until after he does so
Why wait to switch
'm happy to - We want to show the amendment has bipartisan support, you idiot
Early in the next Congress, when tell you to do so, you will switch parties
Now congratulations on your victory, and get out
- Continue with Lincoln and his operatives around the card table
Now give me the names of whoever else you been hunting
Schell, Latham and Bilbo exchange looks, then: George Yeaman
Yes
Yeaman
Among others
But Yeaman: That'd count
() ----- Lincoln looks up from his notepad, smiling
got it
95
Kentucky
' ,   - Seward sits at his grand desk, looking on with an anxious scowl
Lincoln sits on the edge of Seward's desk
Yeaman sits in a chair facing him
can't vote for the amendment, Mr
Lincoln
saw a barge once, Mr
Yeaman, filled with colored men in chains, heading down the Mississippi to the New Orleans slave markets
It sickened me, `n more than that, it brought a shadow down, a pall around my eyes
() Slavery troubled me, as long as can remember, in a way it never troubled my father, though he hated it
In his own fashion
He knew no smallholding dirt farmer could compete with slave plantations
He took us out from Kentucky to get away from `em
He wanted Indiana kept free
He wasn't a kind man, but there was a rough moral urge for fairness, for freedom in him learnt that from him,  suppose, if little else from him
We didn't care for one another, Mr
Yeaman
() Well, 'm sorry to hear that - Lovingkindness, that most ordinary thing, came to me from other sources
'm grateful for that
hate it, too, sir, slavery, but - but we're entirely unready for emancipation
There's too many - 96
() We're unready for peace too, ain't we
When it comes, it'll present us with conundrums and dangers greater than any we've faced during the war, bloody as it's been
We'll have to extemporize and experiment with what it is when it is
Lincoln moves from the desk to take the seat beside Yeaman, no longer towering over him
He leans forward and rests a hand on Yeaman's knee
(') read your speech, George
Negroes and the vote, that's a puzzle
No, no, but, but, but - But Negroes can't, um, vote, Mr
Lincoln
You're not suggesting that we enfranchise colored people
'm asking only that you disenthrall yourself from the slave powers
'll let you know when there's an offer on my desk for surrender
There's none before us now
What's before us now, that's the vote on the Thirteenth Amendment
It's going to be so very close
You see what you can do
Lincoln leaves Yeaman, considering
- Lincoln stands in front of William Hutton's row house, talking to Hutton
The funeral wreath still hangs on the door behind them, displaying the marks of time passing: faded, weatherbeaten, dusty
can't make sense of it, what he died for
Mr
Lincoln,  hate them all,  do, all black people
am a prejudiced man
The door opens slightly behind Hutton
His wife looks out
Hutton exchanges a glance with her, and the door shuts again
97
'd change that in you if  could, but that's not why  come
might be wrong, Mr
Hutton, but expect
Colored people will most likely be free, and when that's so, it's simple truth that your brother's bravery, and his death, helped make it so
Only you can decide whether that's sense enough for you, or not
Hutton walks slowly back to his house
(') My deepest sympathies to your family
Lincoln goes back to his buggy
Hutton pauses at his door to watch Lincoln's buggy drive away
'  - Lincoln is seated at the head of the cabinet table along with Seward
Ashley, Preston and Montgomery Blair
Hay and Nicolay sit in their usual chairs
(:) We've managed our members to a fare- thee-well, you've had no defections from the Republican right to trouble you, whereas as to what you promised - Where the hell are the commissioners
Oh God
( :) It's true
You, you
lied to me, Mr
Lincoln
You evaded my requests for a denial that, that there is a Confederate peace offer because, because there is one
We are absolutely guaranteed to lose the whole thing - 98
(') - and we'll be discredited, We don't need a goddamned the amendment itself will be abolition amendment
Leave tainted
What if, what if the Constitution alone
State these peace commissioners by state you can extirpate - appear today
Or worse, on the morning - can't listen to this anymore can't accomplish a goddamned thing of any human meaning or worth until we cure ourselves of slavery and end this pestilential war, and whether any of you or anyone else knows it,  know  need this
This amendment is that cure
We're stepped out upon the world's stage now, now, with the fate of human dignity in our hands
Blood's been spilt to afford us this moment
He points around the table at Ashley, Monty, Preston
(') Now now now
And you grousle and heckle and dodge about like pettifogging Tammany Hall hucksters
See what is before you
See the here and now
That's the hardest thing, the only thing that accounts
Abolishing slavery by constitutional provision settles the fate, for all coming time, not only of the millions now in bondage but of unborn millions to come
Two votes stand in its way, and these votes must be procured
We need two yeses, three abstentions, or four yeses and one more abstention and the amendment will pass - You got a night and a day and a night and several perfectly good hours
Now get the hell out of here and get `em
Yes but how
99
Buzzards' guts, man
Lincoln rises, and keeps rising, till he seems eight feet tall
(') am the President of the United States of America, clothed in immense power
You will procure me these votes
- The chamber is quiet and dark
Pages and clerks prepare the desks, laying out pens and paper, filling inkwells
: 31, 1865 is draping red-white-and-blue bunting on the desks of representatives from seceded states
These will of course remain unoccupied during the vote
The first Congressman to arrive, Thaddeus Stevens clumps in
He goes to his desk and sits
He looks around the empty chamber, ready and waiting
- , Thaddeus Stevens is at his desk
The House is in session, the floor full of congressmen caucusing and arguing
The balcony's packed
Mary and Keckley sit at the front, Nicolay and Hay behind them
The Blairs are among other officials, rich people, foreign dignitaries
There's a sudden quiet, then murmuring
Ashley, Stevens and everyone on the floor look up, Ellis, Hollister, Hutton and Hawkins among these
In the balcony, twenty --  , mostly men, are escorted by several Senators, including Sumner and Wade, to a reserved section of the balcony
The black people glance at their surroundings but are rigidly composed
Asa Vintner Litton sees them enter
He looks about, at the representatives caucusing, or staring up at the visitors
Something powerful strikes him
In a voice coarse with emotion, he calls up to the black visitors: 100
We welcome you, ladies and gentlemen, first in the history of this people's chamber, to your House
There's tense applause
Some of the black guests bow; most aren't sure how to respond
Yeaman watches this, deeply moved
Bilbo catches Hawkins's eye and waves
Hawkins looks anxiously around, blushing
Everyone is seated, and the place is packed
Schuyler Colfax is in his high seat atop the rostrum, the -- to his right
Colfax gavels the House into session
Ashley is at the podium
Mr
Ashley, the floor is yours
On the matter of the joint resolution before us, presenting a Thirteenth Amendment to our national Constitution, which was passed last year by the Senate, and which has been debated now by this estimable body for the past several weeks
Today we will vote
Cheers, boos, applause
(') By mutual agreement we shall hear brief final statements - General cheering for this, laughing
(') - beginning with the honorable George Pendleton of Ohio
Applause, boos
Pendleton, taking the podium, is handed several letters by Wood
He holds them over his head
The chamber's quiet
've just received confirmation of what previously has been merely rumored
Affidavits from loyal citizens recently returned from 101
Richmond
They testify that Commissioners have indeed come north and ought to have arrived by now in Washington City
Bearing an offer of immediate cessation of our civil war
The chamber explodes
Through the ensuing ruckus: (to Ashley, fake shock:) Are there Confederate commissioners in the Capitol
don't
have no idea where they are or if they've arrived or - If they've arrived
appeal to my fellow Democrats, to all Republican representatives who give a fig for peace
Postpone this vote until we have answers from the President himself
In the balcony, Hay and Nicolay exchange worried glances
Postpone the vote
Ashley turns to Stevens: "
" as Pendleton's Democrats begin to chant "
" Mary, worried, looks from Mrs
Keckley to Preston Blair, who is focused on the leader of the conservative Republican representatives,   (, )
Haddam looks up at Preston, awaiting instructions
Democrats and Republicans rush to the Speaker to support or protest the motion
In the balcony, Preston slowly stands, saddened and angry
(') have made a motion
Does anyone here care to second - Preston nods at Haddam: "Go ahead
" Haddam rises
102
(in a powerful voice:) Gentlemen
The conservative faction of border and western Republicans cannot approve this amendment, about which we harbor grave doubts, if a peace offer is being held hostage to its success
Joining with our Democratic colleagues,  second the motion to postpone
The debate swells again as, in the balcony, Schell scribbles in a notebook while Latham whispers furiously in his ear
Latham rips the page out before Schell's finished; Bilbo snatches it from him
Quick, man
Quick
Bilbo pushes his way out of the balcony
Nicolay, then Hay, follow on his heels
Mary sees this; she's concerned
- Hay and Nicolay emerge
They see Bilbo running, far ahead
Hay immediately sprints after him and trips
Nicolay continues running
/
, ,  - Bilbo puffs his way across the portico, through the door, and up the stairs
Hay gains on him
It's become a race
In the second floor hallway, Bilbo gets winded, and Hay dashes past him
Hay reaches the doors to Lincoln's office and flings them open
' ,    - Lincoln is at his desk, working, when Hay bursts in
Bilbo appears in the doorway, beet-red and gasping for air
Hay's too winded to speak
Bilbo holds out the note, limp with sweat, and brings it to Lincoln
Lincoln reads it
This is precisely what Mr
Wood wishes me to respond to
103
Tad runs into the room, excited by the commotion
He wraps his arm around his father's neck, then tears wildly out of the room
(') Word for word
This is precisely the assurance that he demands of me
Yes sir
As Nicolay heaves into the room in last place, wheezing terribly, Lincoln deliberates for a moment, then writes a note
He blots, folds and hands it to Hay, who immediately reads it, Nicolay looking on
Give this to Mr
Ashley
Hay looks at Nicolay, who can't speak; he waves at Hay to speak for him
feel, um,  have to say, Mr
Lincoln, that this - (annoyed, impatient, to :) Could you please just step outside
You gonna have a chat now, with with the whole of the House of Representatives waiting on that
Nicolay continues gasping, trying to speak
He can't
( :) Making false representation to Congress is, it's, um - It's, it's - Impeachable
've made no false representation
But there are - (:) 104
There is a delegation from Richmond
Give me the note, Johnnie
Hay gives Lincoln the note
Lincoln takes it, holding on to Hay's hand; with his free hand, Lincoln passes the note to Bilbo
(') ( :) Please deliver that to Mr
Ashley
- Bilbo, pushing past the pages, runs in, holding the note, Ashley snatches it, reading as he makes his way to the podium
All eyes are on Ashley
From the President: The chamber falls silent
(') "So far as  know, there are no peace commissioners in the city nor are there likely to be
" Applause, booing, furious discussion
"So far as  know-"
That means nothing
Are there commissioners from the South or aren't there
In the balcony, Mary looks to Mrs
Keckley
The President has answered you, sir
Your peace offer is a fiction
That is not a denial, it is a lawyer's dodge
Mr
Haddam
Is your faction satisfied
105
Preston, in the balcony, hesitates
He looks at his daughter, who gives him a questioning look: "Do you want this on your head
" Preston doesn't
He indicates to Haddam with a small shake of his venerable head: "Drop it
" The conservative Republican faction's satisfied, and we thank Mr
Lincoln
move to table Mr
Wood's motion
Tabled
There's an angry response, but Wood and Pendleton sit, thwarted
Speaker Colfax,  order the main question
motion has been made to bring the bill for the Thirteenth Amendment to a vote
Do  hear a second
second the motion
So moved, so ordered
The Clerk will now - (a rap of the gavel) Quiet please
The noise of the chamber and balcony reduce to a rumble
(') The clerk will now call the roll for voting
Thaddeus Stevens sits silently, tired, concentrated: the moment has come
We begin with Connecticut
Mr
Augustus Benjamin, on the matter of this amendment, how say you
The chamber is completely silent for the first time
106
Nay
The clerk records his vote
Mr
Arthur Bentleigh
Nay
Mr
John Ellis, how say you

Angry shouts from Ellis's fellow Democrats, forcing Colfax to gavel for order
What
Shameful
Missouri next
Mr
Walter Appleton

Mr
Josiah Burton

He is very, very tall and thin
Beanpole Burton is pleased to vote yea
Mary watches from the balcony, pleased, but anxious
The State of New Jersey
Mr
Nehemiah Cleary
No
Mr
James Martinson
107
Mr
Martinson has delegated me to say he is indisposed and he abstains
Mr
Austin
Roberts
Also indisposed, also abstaining
Shocked anger from the Democrats
Pendleton starts calculating votes on a sheet of paper
Wood grabs it and begins to calculate more rapidly
In the balcony, Mary keeps track on her own list
She writes carefully next to Roberts's name: "15  " Illinois concluded
Mr
Harold Hollister, how say you
Hollister glowers next to Hutton, who's silently praying
No
Mr
Hutton
Mr
William Hutton, cast your vote
Hutton looks up from his prayer
William Hutton, remembering at this moment his beloved brother, Fredrick, votes against the amendment
' ,    - Lincoln watches Tad stacking books to make a fort for his lead toy soldiers
/
- field telegraph has been set up near the steps, at the front of the enormous crowd that's assembled before the Capitol
Poles are held up in the crowd by soldiers along which the telegraph wire is stretched
108
soldier stationed at the door of the Capitol relays the vote to another soldier manning the cipher key: Webster Allen votes no
The cipher operator instantly transmits

Webster Allen, Illinois, Democrat, votes
no
The cipher key clicks again
(') Halberd Law, Indiana, Democrat, votes
no
Grant observes this from the balcony above
Robert, in a captain's uniform, stands near him
Like his mother, Robert has a scorecard, and he's keeping track
Grant turns his back on the proceedings to light a cigar
He's concerned at how close the vote is
Behind him the count : (') Archibald Moran
yes
Robert has been looking at Grant; he returns to his score keeping
(') Ambrose Bailer
yes
- The Clerk continues
Mr
Walter
Washburn
Votes no
And Mr
George Yeaman, how say you
109
Yeaman doesn't respond
The silence this causes lengthens, till representatives begin to look to see what's happened
Yeaman sits, staring ahead, not responding
Thaddeus Stevens, sensing something's happening, looks in Yeaman's direction
Yeaman, still staring ahead, mumbles something, but it's inaudible
(') Sorry Mr
Yeaman,  didn't hear you - (rising to his feet) said aye, Mr
McPherson
Great surprise, loud cheers and angry shouts
Yeaman looks ready to faint
To the consternation of the Democrats, a mob of gleeful Republicans rushes across the aisle that separates the two parties; they surround Yeaman, shaking his hand, slapping him on the back
Colfax bangs the gavel
Order
Pendleton is speechless
Litton turns to Ashley, both astonished; Ashley turns to Stevens, who watches, sharp, observant, giving nothing away
Mary updates her tally: "8  " (') Order in the chamber
Yeaman collapses back into his seat
The room quiets
(') Mr
MacPherson, you may proceed
Mr
Clay
Hawkins of Ohio
Hawkins seems to have been startled out of a reverie
Sick with fear, he looks up at the sound of his name
He can't speak
Wood and Pendleton watch this, deeply alarmed
Hawkins snaps out of it
Goddamn it, 'm voting yes
110
huge reaction to this
LeClerk gapes at Hawkins
(') (right at Pendleton and Wood
) don't care, shoot me dead
You shoot me dead ,  am voting yes
Mr
Edwin
LeClerk
LeClerk, seated next to Hawkins and transfixed by his courage, turns dazedly to McPherson
No
(then, standing abruptly:) Oh to hell with it, shoot me dead too
Yes
The noise gets wilder
Pendleton fixes LeClerk and Hawkins with a murderous look
(') mean, abstention
Abstention
Disgust briefly flashing across his face, McPherson crosses out and changes LeClerk's vote to an abstention
The cheering and booing degenerates to intense argument about what this means for the vote count
In the balcony, Bilbo looks at Hawkins, well-pleased
Mr
Alexander Coffroth
Coffroth looks towards Stevens, who doesn't look at him
(proud of himself and happy about the reward ' :) Vote
Yes
Applause
Stevens still doesn't look at Coffroth, but, tickled, he grins and nods

The roll call concludes, voting is completed, now - Mr
Clerk, please call my name, want to cast a vote

The Speaker doesn't vote
The Speaker may vote if he so chooses
It is highly unusual, sir - This isn't usual, Mr
Pendleton, this is history
How does Mr
Schuyler Colfax vote

(a look of surprise that this needs to be asked, then, stating the :) Aye, of course
Laughter in the chamber
The Clerk tallies the vote, then passes the recorded vote to the Speaker
There's absolute silence
In the balcony, Mary checks her own tally, not quite believing it
(') The final vote: eight absent or not voting, fifty six votes against, one hundred nineteen votes for
With a margin of two votes - ' ,    - Lincoln stands, waiting
The only sound is the ticking of the clock
And then the ticking is slowly drowned out as bells begin to peal throughout the city
Lincoln raises the window as Tad rushes to him
The bells are joined by a cannonade
The sound of jubilation fills his office
Lincoln turns from the window to Tad, who stares out eagerly, seeking out the source of the noise
Lincoln puts his hand on Tad's head
He looks down at his son, silent
,   - Representatives throw papers in the air, embrace, weep, shout, dance, climb on desks
In the balcony, Mary stands slowly, beyond tears or joy; Mrs
Keckley stands with her, smiling, crying
Preston Blair applauds vigorously
The black visitors join the general exultation, overwhelmed, some praying, others embracing and weeping
Latham's, Schell's and Bilbo's seats are empty; they've gone
Ashley, grinning from ear to ear, tears streaming down his face, is hoisted up on shoulders and marched around the room, as on the floor and in the balcony, people start singing "The Battle Cry of Freedom
" Pendleton, with the face of someone who's seen his world collapse into ruin, walks straight at Yeaman, who's listening to the singing, deeply moved, his face full of wonder
Pendleton turns, without a word, and leaves the House
114
Yeaman laughs, and loudly joins in singing
Stevens clumps over to the Clerk of the House, who is placing his tallies and the official copy of the amendment bill in a folio
He looks up
Congratulations, Mr
Chairman
The bill, Mr
McPherson, may
The Clerk hands the bill to Stevens, who folds it and pockets it
That's
That's the official bill
'll return it in the morning
Creased, but unharmed
,  - Celebrating crowds move towards the Mall, singing, carrying placards proclaiming the passage of the amendment
Thaddeus Stevens is hobbling in the opposite direction, making difficult headway against the crowd, pushed and shoved, unrecognized; he shoves back, his ferocious scowl utterly at odds with the prevailing festive mood
He reaches a modest house, unlocks the door and steps inside
'  - Stevens is met at the door by  , a black woman in her fifties
As she helps him off with his coat, he takes a piece of paper from his pocket
gift for you
She takes it

Lincoln walks across the gangway
Seward greets him amidst the cheers

Seward looks concerned at Lincoln's fatigue
Let me be blunt
Will the southern states resume their former position in the Union speedily enough to enable us to block ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment
'd like peace immediately
Yes, and
'd like your states restored to their practical relations to the Union immediately
Silence
If this could be given me in writing, as Vice President of the Confederacy, 'd bring that document with celerity to Jefferson Davis
Surrender and we can discuss reconstruction
Surrender won't be thought of unless you've assured us, in writing, that we'll be readmitted in time to block this amendment
117
This is the arrogant demand of a conqueror for a humiliating, - You'll not be conquered people, Mr
Hunter
You will be citizens, returned to the laws and the guarantees of rights of the Constitution
Which now extinguishes slavery
And with it our economy
All our laws will be determined by a Congress of vengeful Yankees, all our rights'll be subject to a Supreme Court benched by Black Republican radicals
All our traditions will be obliterated
We won't know ourselves anymore
(a nod, then:) We ain't here to discuss reconstruction, we have no legal basis for that discussion
But don't want to deal falsely
The Northern states'll ratify, most of `em
As  figure, it remains for two of the Southern states to do the same, even after all are readmitted
And  been working on that
Tennessee and Louisiana
Arkansas too, most likely
It'll be ratified
Slavery, sir, it's done
Hunter storms out of the cabin
(') If we submit ourselves to law, Alex, even submit to losing freedoms - the freedom to oppress, for instance - we may discover other freedoms previously unknown to us
Had you kept faith with democratic process, as frustrating as that can be - 118
Come sir, spare us at least these pieties
Did you defeat us with ballots
How've you held your Union together
Through democracy
How many hundreds of thousands have died during your administration
Your Union, sir, is bonded in cannonfire and death
It may be you're right
But say all we done is show the world that democracy isn't chaos, that there is a great invisible strength in a people's union
Say we've shown that a people can endure awful sacrifice and yet cohere
Mightn't that save at least the idea of democracy, to aspire to
Eventually, to become worthy of
At all rates, whatever may be proven by blood and sacrifice must've been proved by now
Shall we stop this bleeding
- Like a vision of apocalypse, a city on the banks of a broad river is being consumed in a hellish fire, as artillery shells rend the dark sky asunder, raining down destruction
,  - The morning is grey, and a dense fog covers a vast field
Lincoln, his stovepipe hat atop his head, is mounted on a horse on a rise at one end of the field
Behind him, several are also mounted
It's chilly; the breath of the men and the horses is visible
:  , 3 Lincoln flicks the reins of his horse, which starts down the slope
The officers follow behind him
No one speaks
119
Lincoln rides slowly, his focus on the ground before him
Debris is scattered all around him, along with the bodies of fallen soldiers
He looks up and across the battlefield; a terrible battle has concluded a couple of hours ago
Looking down, as he rides, he sees soldiers killed by artillery fire, whose bodies lie twisted, burned, headless, limbless, torn in two, blown out of their clothing or charred too badly to tell
He sees soldiers killed by rifle and bayonet, whose corpses are intact
At the beginning of his ride, all the dead and wounded are in Union blue, the casualties of Confederate cannon fire, felled as the Union army, about six hours earlier, began its final, successful drive to break through Confederate lines
As Lincoln and his escorts move across the battlefield, grey and blue uniformed corpses and badly wounded men intermingle
He reaches the other side of the field, passing a Confederate flag to enter the now-ruined town of Petersburg
, ' ,   ,  - Grant, smoking his cigar, his uniform dusty and rumpled, is sitting on the small porch
He stares piercingly at Lincoln, in a rocker next to him, watching his troops pass by as they move in to secure the conquered town
Lincoln closes his eyes
He has grown older, the skin around his eyes is cobwebbed with fine creases, and his hair's thinner, softer, suffused with grey
His brow has grown smoother
Once he surrenders, send his boys back to their homes, their farms, their shops
Yes sir, as we discussed
Liberality all around
No punishment
don't want that
And the leaders - Jeff and the rest of `em - if they escape, leave the country while my back's turned, that wouldn't upset me none
120
When peace comes it mustn't just be hangings
By outward appearance, you're ten years older than you were a year ago
Some weariness has bit at my bones
() never seen the like of it before
What  seen today
Never seen the like of it before
You always knew that, what this was going to be
Intimate, and ugly
You must've needed to see it close when you decided to come down here
We've made it possible for one another to do terrible things
And we've won the war
Now you have to lead us out of it
,   ,  - stand around in the afternoon sun
Everyone's solemn, even stunned by what's just happened
No one is speaking
:  , 9, 1865 comes down the steps of the McLean house, as a brings his horse to him
His face is blank
Lee mounts his waiting horse
Lee should leave, having just surrendered to Grant inside; but he's immobile
Some of the officers of both sides look at Lee, some can't bear it
Lee tries out various expressions: pride, defiance, blankness
Grant stomps onto the porch of the house, followed by his staff
Among them is Robert Lincoln
121
Grant, lost in thought, stops, taken aback, realizing that Lee's still there, astride his horse
Everyone looks at the two men who look awkwardly at one another
Then Grant removes his famous slouch hat
Everyone freezes for a moment, and then one by one, the officers of the Union Army remove their hats
Lee is visibly moved by this gesture of respect
He raises his hat, briefly, only an inch from his head
Then, pulling slightly on his horse's reins, he rides away
- beautiful spring afternoon
Lincoln and Mary are riding in the buggy, driven by the old soldier
You've an itch to travel
'd like that
To the West by rail
(shaking her head no:) Overseas
The Holy Land
(a laugh, then:) Awfully pious for a man who takes his wife out buggy-riding on Good Friday
Jerusalem
Where David and Solomon walked
dream of walking in that ancient city
She seems sadder
They ride in silence
All anyone will remember of me is was crazy and  ruined your happiness
Anyone thinks that doesn't understand, Molly
She nods; then, tenderly: 122
When they look at you, at what it cost to live at the heart of this, they'll wonder at it
They'll wonder at you
They should
But they should also look at the wretched woman by your side, if they want to understand what this was truly like
For an ordinary person
For anyone other than you
Lincoln laughs, takes her hand
She leans against him
We must try to be happier
We must
Both of us
We've been so miserable for so long
'  - Lincoln's in the shirtsleeves and vest of his formal evening wear, his hair brushed down and plastered in place
William Slade is working the tie and gloves
James Ashley and Schuyler Colfax stand with him, holding glasses of scotch whiskey
Slade waits with Lincoln's coat, clothes brush, the stovepipe hat and gloves on the table
John Hay tears down several of the military maps, heavily marked, from the bookcases where they're tacked
He drops these on the floor
As they watch Hay: did say some colored men, the intelligent, the educated, and veterans,  qualified it
Mr
Stevens is furious, he wants to know why you qualified it - No one heard the intelligent or the educated part
All they heard was the first time any president has ever made mention of Negro voting
Still,  wish 'd mentioned it in a better speech
Mr
Stevens also wants to know why you didn't make a better speech
123
They laugh
There's a knock on the door; Nicolay enters
( :) Mrs
Lincoln's waiting in the carriage
She wants me to remind you of the hour, and that you'll have to pick up Miss Harris and Major Rathbone
Lincoln nods
Slade enters with Lincoln's hat, coat, and gloves
Lincoln begins to dress hurriedly
Am  in trouble
No, sir
Thank you, Mr
Slade
Slade hands Lincoln his gloves as Colfax and Ashley drain their drinks and rise
(') suppose it's time to go, though would rather stay
He leaves the room
,       - On the way out, Lincoln tosses the gloves on a side table
Slade grabs them, considers chasing after Lincoln, then thinks better of it
He walks back towards the office
Then some strange feeling stops him, and he turns around again
Lincoln is walking away, past the petitioners' chairs, down the empty hallway
Slade watches till Lincoln turns the corner, and he's gone
- The theater is adorned with patriotic bunting
Onstage, a Caliph's palace
duels with scimitars against a huge, hideous
in chains cowers in distress
The young man gymnastically avoids being killed, then plunges his scimitar into the afrit's heart
The demon screams and topples to the ground
The audience gasps as a 124
flame-colored, bejewelled bird rises up from the dead afrit's heart
The audience applauds
In the center box, Tad Lincoln is joining in, as is his companion for the evening, Tom Pendel
Onstage, the bird flies off, the young man is freeing the young woman, when the scene is halted by the red curtain lowering, surprising actors and audience
The music dies, the gas lights in the house are being raised as the owner of the theater,  , steps out before the curtain and walks to the center of the stage, pale and badly shaken
In the box, Tom Pendel glances quickly at Tad, who's fixed on the stage, eyes open, alarmed
The audience knows something's wrong
Their rising murmur of concern dies immediately when Grover raises his hands
( :) The President has been shot
There are screams of horror from the audience; people leap from their seats
(') The President has been shot at Ford's Theater
The theater is a scene of complete pandemonium
People cry, jam the aisles, call to each other across rows of seats, shout questions at Grover, who's calling for calm, inaudible in the uproar
Tom Pendel is frozen in shock, then turns to draw Tad close to him
Tad pulls away and begins shrieking, clinging to the railing so tightly that Pendel can't pry him loose
Tad can't stop screaming, his eyes wide open, seeing nothing
'   - Mary is gently escorted into a tiny room
small, hissing gas jet in the wall bathes the scene with green light
Stanton, Speed,    and a , are standing
Welles sits by the head of the bed , a young army surgeon, and
, the Lincoln family's doctor, stand uselessly by the foot of the bed, while
, the Surgeon General, listens to Lincoln's faint breathing
125
Robert, in uniform, red-eyed, pale as a ghost, sits at the bedside and stares at his father, barely breathing
Lincoln lies in a crooked diagonal, his knees bent, on a bed he's too tall to fit properly, clad only in a nightshirt
Barnes moves his head closer, then closer
The room is utterly still
Barnes takes out his watch, looks at the time, softly clears his throat
It's 7:22 in the morning, Saturday the 15th of April
It's all over
The President is no more
No one talks, or moves
Stanton looks at Lincoln's body
Now he belongs to the ages
Robert begins to weep
(
) Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away
- Lincoln, wearing spectacles, stands at a podium before the Capitol Dome, still under scaffolding, under cloudy skies
He reads from the two pages
Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said "the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether
" He glances at his audience: 40,000 people from all over the country, wounded soldiers, civilians in black
And for the first time, in the crowd, not at its edges, hundreds of African Americans, civilians and soldiers
126
(') With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations
