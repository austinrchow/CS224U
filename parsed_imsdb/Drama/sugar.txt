game is currently in progress

the pitcher,   (aka / - 19, lean, Black and handsome)
Sweat drips down his face in the oppressive midday heat
He steadies his glove and ball at his chest, peeking over at the  on first base
Miguel lifts his leg high into the air, rears back his right arm, and the ball toward the plate
cloud of dust pops off the ' mitt as the ball slams inside
Strike three
The  lowers his head, helpless in the face of Miguel's overpowering fastball
, Miguel's   him on (dark-skinned, 30s) nods approvingly,
, a dozen rookie players also in Kansas City uniforms cheer for their team
Two clocking Miguel's pitches look at each others' radar guns, which read 92 and 93
As the next batter steps up to the plate, Miguel's catcher, (18), taps his index finger on his thigh, calling for an outside fastball
The next pitch is popped up on the infield between first and home
Miguel locates the ball, points to the sky, but Jose and first baseman,  , nearly collide, as the ball lands between them and the runners reach base safely

C1     , Miguel glares at Pedro, who averts his eyes, and     C1 kicks the dirt
Miguel looks in for the sign from Jose, nods, and delivers a tight fastball that sends the batter stumbling backwards to the dirt
Some players  and heckle the batter
Others point angry fingers at Miguel, who greets the batter back to the plate with a friendly, but authoritative, grin
He sends in the next pitch and the batter swings right through it, getting nothing but air

The mood is friendly and playful as players tease each other across the tables
Miguel, sitting with his friends  (2nd base) and (3rd Base), works on a second helping of dessert
Check out Sugar
Puts on twenty pounds in two months; now he's going for twenty more
(mouth full of food) All muscle, baby
Rock solid
For some  , distinguishable in the sea of uniforms by their  "tryout" jerseys and ragged sneakers, it is their first healthy meal, and they eat as if it were their last
One of them,  (Black, scrawny, 17) holds his plate up to his mouth, shovelling food down his throat
Slow down, kid, it ain't going nowhere
few of the guys
(to Pedro) If you hustled half as much as him, maybe you'd be hungry too
The other guys "ohhhh" Miguel's insult, as Salvador and Miguel exchange subtle grins

As he repeats the terms, he enthusiastically pantomimes the meanings of each

Kevin Costner asks his father to play catch in a voice that sounds nothing like Kevin Costner
Miguel passes through the room, and we follow him out of the rec room down a hall, and into

Their talks on a cell phone nearby
Alvarez, the academy director, approaches one of the kids, whispers in his ear
The kid smiles tentatively
Alvarez joins Rudy and they speak in English
What'd you tell him
told him to grip the ball more gently
Like a tit
They both crack up
The kid looks over to the two men pow- wowing about him
He breathes in, nervous

Pedro Berroa
Third year
Hasn't developed like we hoped
How much he sign for
Forty-five
Jesus
These kids keep getting more expensive
How much did you sign for back in the day

Salvador Torres
Been practicing with the team for almost a week
Still raw, but he's got a lot of potential
We gonna sign him
Soon
Soon
We want to play it low- key, see what his agent says
How much you think
They've gotten two offers from other clubs
Agent says they were around a hundred
Rudy raises his eyebrows
(firm) He's good
Rudy looks over to Miguel
What about him
Miguel Santos
Great arm
We signed him two years ago for fifteen
Miguel fires in a pitch
Rudy nods, impressed
Good deal
He throw any junk
(in Spanish) Sugar
Miguel looks over, sees the American with Alvarez
Show us your curve
Miguel nods, nervous, focuses
He pitches
The ball curves very subtly over the plate for a strike
Not bad
Mind if  try something
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    6
Miguel looks back to the men
Hey, kid, do you mind
May
Miguel stares blankly at Rudy, not understanding
(in Spanish) Give him the ball
Miguel hands Rudy the ball, and Rudy demonstrates how to handle a knuckle curve ball, which looks strangely unorthodox, with the index finger tucked against the baseball
Spike curve
Gives you more rotation, more movement
(hands Miguel the ball) You try
Miguel struggles to emulate Rudy's grip, so Rudy maneuvers his fingers into the correct position
Alvarez laughs
Vamos
Let's go
Pitch it
Miguel looks over to his catcher, Jose
Winds up the next pitch, and soars it 5 feet wide of the mark
Rudy and Alvarez laugh
Miguel looks back over his shoulder
It's okay, son, these things take time
You'll figure it out
Rudy pats Miguel on the back and walks off with Alvarez
Miguel stares at them hard as they go
He turns back to his catcher, determined, squeezes the ball in spike curve formation
Delivers
Misses badly again
take us through a half-dozen more bad curve attempts, as other players take notice and gather around, some laughing, until
finally a perfect curve twists dramatically through the air, landing centered in Jose's mitt
The other players erupt in amazement, while Miguel stares straight ahead
After a beat, he smiles wide

They see Miguel and rush toward him as he paces up the block, his name
As Miguel approaches home, he makes eye contact with a girl, (15), buying water from a delivery truck
She smiles
With the kids still clamoring around Miguel, he stops, unzips his duffel and hands out some used baseballs
The kids grab the balls, then run off to play
Miguel approaches Erica
She puts down her water bucket, gives Miguel a hug
How are you, sis
Any news about the States

Is that all you have to say
Miguel helps Erica with the water bucket and walks with her towards their home - a small wooden construction with peeling paint and a rusted aluminum roof
On the lot next to their house, the cinder-block frame of their future home dwarfs the others on the block

The reception is still crappy, though
Miguel's grandmother, , sits upright on her mattress in the corner of the room
Hello, Abuela
You're looking beautiful
She smiles big at her oldest grandson, opens her arms for a hug
Erica sits at the kitchen table, where her schoolbooks lay open
What's up my people

Not during American Idol, anyway
Miguel's mother,  (late 30s) emerges from behind a hanging bed sheet, which acts as a "wall" separating two rooms

How long till it's done

Um, another month, maybe two
You know we just did it where Abuela's room is going to be

We can do it in mom's kitchen next
Right over there

The mood is festive

She was cute, but
liked my hair more

Then why'd you cut it last week

Sofia punches Miguel in the arm
Watch it, baby, that's a million-dollar arm you're messing with
He's right
All hail the golden arm
Javier and the girls drunkenly salute Miguel's arm, pretend to dust dirt away, but Jaime doesn't play along
He looks on, a little jealous
You call that flabby rubberband an arm
Oooh
This flabby rubberband can throw 95
What can yours do
threw 98 in double- Portland

Then why you washing windshields now

Good bat speed

His mom tells me he's missing school
say, yeah, but

They laugh

Frank shrugs, as Miguel's sister calls out from the street-- Miguel, Luis
Dinner is ready

Maybe
Miguel shakes his head, gets up
Wanna join us for dinner

Your girlfriends, sisters and brothers, grandparents

Just when was starting to like you guys, you go and do something stupid

But Alfonso was there too-- --No excuses
This is unacceptable behavior
You guys need to learn discipline
Miguel and Marcos lower their heads

First, there's getting your shot in the American Minor Leagues: rookie ball, single, double, triple  - all that before you even set foot in a major league ballpark
So, you better pull it together quick

After taking her in, Miguel closes his eyes
And finally, Lord
Please look kindly over the Swing this season
May all the players stay healthy and
well, why not
if there's anything you can do to help us win another championship, we'll take that too
Amen

You didn't cook it

Miguel sits behind the majority of the group, not sure what's going on
Anne stands before them
'm so glad you all came
Last year, we didn't have half as many people in our group
So,  think this just goes to show the great work we've been doing in spreading the word
But this year, want us to work harder
Now,  know a lot of you are studying for SATs or working on college applications
And all of that is important, but we need to remember that our spiritual accomplishments are more important
What we do in school or for a job
that's just a small part of who we are
We're only here by the grace of God, so let's get out there and share that grace
Miguel watches, still unsure what's going on

Take it easy
Don't force it
How's it feel
(translating) Don't push it
Does it hurt
'm okay
Let him toss a few warm-ups
The umpire grants Miguel a few "test" pitches

Miguel notices this, as he sets up for another pitch
The trainer shakes his head, no

Stu puts his arm on Miguel's shoulder for comfort
You're okay,  know, but let's just be sure

When  was little,  wanted to eat some cherries from a tree
It wasn't our tree, and there was a fence to keep us kids away

He readjusts the wooden rails on the faulty side of the drawer by sanding them down and re-gluing them into place
Miguel hobbles over, opens it to find Anne, carrying a casserole dish and a couple empty platters
These are grandma's from the other night
Miguel lets her pass into the kitchen, put the dishes on the table
They stand awkwardly for a beat, looking at each other
We missed you at our meeting, Thursday

He pounds a few players hello, then freezes upon seeing Brad's empty locker
Stu approaches Miguel
There was an injury to the Wichita right-fielder
They called up Brad this morning
He left you this

Miguel opens to the first page, where Brad has inscribed a note, "See you in Kansas City, Mamanema

Yo

Miguel turns around to find Salvador Torres (the once scrawny kid from the Academy) running at him
They hug
Holy shit
How'd you get here
On a airplane, motherfucker
Miguel playfully flips Salvador's cap bill down over his face for being a smartass
Great, you guys know each other
Sal's our new middle-relief man
Throws a nasty cutter
You could learn a thing or two from him, Santos
Okay
Stu walks back towards the coaches' office

Helen turns it down
You started dropping your arm in the third
think that was your problem
He lost control of his breaking pitches and they just zeroed in on the fastball, which isn't as fast as it used to be
Earl
Don't matter, he can't understand anyway

He glances over to the entrance, where the clubhouse manager stares at him, disapproving

'  -                              156 Miguel sits across from Stu, staring off, embarrassed
know it's hard when you don't perform up to your own expectations for yourself
But you need to learn self- control
Can you understand what 'm saying
You need to learn that your actions have consequences
So we're gonna take the cost of the water unit you broke out of your next check
That's not something your family back home's gonna be too proud of
Is it
Miguel turns his gaze to Stu
Though he doesn't fully understand what he's saying, Stu's intention is clear
So you should think real hard next time
Think about channeling that frustration you're feeling onto the field
Into practice
Channel it into working harder-- -- am work hard
Everyday  work hard
So work harder, goddamnit
You think you're the only one on this team works hard
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   80

It's a mess
The sound    and the image blends to - again

It's just a nasty part of the game
Nobody likes to admit it, but it is

Back when he first arrived, 1951, 52, he was playing in the minors
Little Rock, Arkansas
So the story goes, one day before a game, Vic stops into this diner for lunch
Hadn't been here long, so he knew very little English
Didn't even notice the "whites only" sign hanging in the window
And Vic was Black looked him up on Google
mean Black like you
So he sits down at the counter and the little waitress comes up to big Vic and says, "'m sorry, we don't serve colored people
" Osvaldo pauses for dramatic effect, as Miguel and Estella eagerly await what comes next
So he leans close to the waitress, tells her in his best English, "That's okay,  don't eat colored people
" After a beat, Estella laughs, but Miguel is unsure
Osvaldo does his best to explain the joke in Spanish
