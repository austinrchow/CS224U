very buxom  are being handcuffed by a plain clothes special agent,
Another  has his gun to the spread eagled  's head
The  inside the bus are screaming
The phone inside Chester Desmond's car starts to ring
Desmond walks to the car

'  - Desmond picks up the ringing phone
Yes

(very loud) Okay, Gordon
Desmond electronically lowers the aerial adjusting the volume
Smell something fishy, huh

It's a pleasure

walks to them from another room
She goes into a contorted dance
8
' Things we notice
--  She makes a sour face
--  She walks in place
--  She puts one hand in her pocket and makes a fist with the other
--  While she is doing this, she blinks with both eyes
--  She is wearing a red wig
At one point during this Cole adds a sentence
'  ' '
Cole holds four fingers in front of his eyes
(noticing the fingers) Federal
Cole gives him the thumbs up
Lil finishes her dance
,
(turns to Sam) ,    , ' (back to Chet) Right, Gordon
We'll be in touch
9
- Desmond's car on the highway
10
'  - As they barrel down the highway - That was really something
That dancing girl
(after a beat) What did it mean
Code
If you work with Gordon you learn that right away
Code, 've heard a lot about this
Desmond pulls his arm back so that only his fingers come out of his sleeve
Sort of shorthand
(missing the humor) Shorthand
really
We're heading into a difficult situation
How do you figure
'll explain it to you
Do you remember Lil's dance
As Desmond explains we - : 11
:  ' In slow motion
' Lil was wearing a sour face
What do you mean
Her face had a sour look
that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities
They are not going to be receptive to the
Both eyes blinking means there is going to be trouble higher up
the eyes of the local authority
sheriff and a deputy
That would be my guess
Two of the local law enforcers are going to be a problem
(continued) If you noticed she had one hand in her pocket which means they are hiding something, and the other hand made a fist which means they are going to be belligerent
(continued) Lil was walking in place which means there's going to be a lot of legwork involved
'
(continued) Cole said Lil was "his mother's sister's girl"
What is missing in that sentence
The Uncle
Oh, the uncle is missing
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime
' Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation
Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her
noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in
It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight
Gordon said you were good
The tailored dress is our code for drugs
Did you notice what was pinned to it
blue rose
Very good, but  can't tell you about that
Stanley rides along quietly for a while
What did Gordon's tie mean
What
That's just Gordon's bad taste
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things
He talks loud
And he loves his code
see
He does talk loud
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation
It must be a high priority situation
12
- Desmond's car drives off
: 13
'  - Desmond and Stanley arrive
The Sheriff's Station is in a sorry state outside
They walk up to the old steps and enter
14
' ,   - Agent Desmond and Stanley walk into a very small reception area
At the counter Desmond shows his badge to  , the Deputy
Good afternoon, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond
'd like to see Sheriff Cable
Cliff just smiles for a long minute
Why don't you folks have a seat
Make yourself at home
It's gonna be a while
Desmond stays standing and Stanley sits
After another long moment, Cliff joins the  in a conspiratorial giggle over the long wait they are planning to give the
In the middle of a giggle Cliff smiles up at Desmond
(continued) Why don't you have some of that coffee
It was fresh two days ago
Cliff has a good laugh over this and leans again over the secretary pretending to look at some paper work
They both laugh
Okay, that's it
've had enough of the waiting room now
(still smiling) Oh
Desmond walks towards the door that obviously must go to Sheriff Cable's office
Cliff blocks his way with his arm across the doorway, daring him to do something
While they stare eye to eye, Desmond's hand goes up slowly towards Cliff's face in a slow mesmerizing way
Cliff tries to knock Chet's hand away
Chet counters by grabbing Cliff's nose and pinches a nerve to its side injecting Cliff with a great amount of pain
(continued) Desmond spins the deputy 180 degrees placing himself on the inside of the office and then still pressing the nerve guides Cliff down into a chair
While the Deputy's eyes tear copiously Desmond turns to the secretary
You can start that  pot of coffee right now
Desmond stalks to Sheriff Cable's office
Stanley remains behind continuing to observe every detail
15
'  - looks up from his work
How the hell did you
Desmond shows his credentials
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond
Cliff, still holding his nose, appears just behind Desmond, who turns to him
(continued) That's all right, Deputy, Sheriff Cable can take it from here Cable signals Cliff to leave
(continued) 'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here
don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods
In fact, when the state boys called me about a "
Edgar" coming up think  said, "So what
" Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government
You're lucky  am not wasting you
Well, little fella, let me put it this way
The operative word here would be "Federal"
With or without the semantics of all this,  am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased
Cable retrieves a box with the paper work and some personal effects
He throws it to Desmond
basic kill
Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her
My boys have been all over this
It's a dead end
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable
Where's the body
Out back in our morgue Desmond starts to leave
(continued) It's 4:30
We close at five
We've got our own clock
We'll lock up
As Desmond turns to leave he notices on the wall a framed Newspaper clipping with picture
The caption reads: "  " The newspaper shows a picture of Cable in a He-Man pose bending a steel  into a  shape
He turns to leave and Stanley seems to have appeared right on time
Desmond moves down the hall and Stanley follows
16
'  - As Desmond and Stanley walk to the adjoining morgue they see a pile of steel  similar to the one they saw Cable bending in the picture
Stanley moves up to Desmond and speaks confidentially
You know, Agent Desmond,  figure this whole office, furniture included, is worth 27,000 dollars
Desmond doesn't know what to say to him
They enter the morgue
17
- Teresa's body is on the platform in the middle of the room,  Stanley hangs his recorder on the hooks at the end of the autopsy table and puts on rubber gloves
Desmond opens Teresa Banks file
(reading) Teresa Banks lived at the Canyon Trailer Park for a month
We'll check that
And worked as a waitress at Hap's Truck Stop
Worked the Night Shift
Good place for dinner when we're thru here, Sam
(flips to another page) No one came to claim the body and no known next of kin
As Desmond is doing this, Stanley takes out his
Desmond looks up from his work and notices
Solved the Whiteman Case with this
That's what  heard
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this
And no one had a machine like this
That's good
Yes, it is good
(looks around) What do you think is in these other drawers
don't know, Sam
Maybe, later we could take a look
Sure, but let's finish up with this first
Getting to work, Stanley's face goes right over Teresa's
(into his recorder) Crushed skull
Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object
Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age
Cole said she was 17
Stanley's eyes drift to Teresa's left hand
wonder where her ring is
Desmond notices the mark on her hand as well
Yeah
(looking into the personal effects) Personal effects include a watch, under garments, and a blue waitress uniform
the ring is missing
It says the rest of her things haven't been removed yet from the trailer
Let's hope it's there
Stanley picks up her left hand
: In Stanley's hand
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand
Oh
Stanley peers underneath the fingernail
laceration
Stanley brings over his "Whiteman" instrument
Works the left hand under it
Accidental
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me
There's something up there
He gets whatever it is with a long set of tweezers
What is it
It is a piece of paper with the letter "" imprinted on it
Take a look
Desmond comes around and takes a look
On a piece of paper
: Pondering what he has seen
We move across to a clock on the wall that reads:  5:04
: It now reads 3:33
Stanley zips up a regulation body bag around Teresa
: 18
- Desmond and Stanley come out of the morgue
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning
Where are we going to sleep
We're not
You and  are going to get some food
Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten
didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond
Desmond takes a long look at Stanley
(continued) You've got your own
, don't you, Agent Desmond
Desmond gets in and starts the car
19
'  - Establish
20
' , '  - Desmond and Stanley talk with , the manager who has black wavy hair with a black full mustache to match, shiny silk shirt with silver strands sown in and an Indian turquoise belt
He has a sign on his shirt that says, "Say 'Goodbye' to "
in the room is working on a light that keeps buzzing and shorting out
He doesn't really know what he's doing so he is poking at the wiring
Had the  here once before
Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place
Where's Hap
He's dead - good and dead
Sorry to hear it
He didn't suffer
'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks
She worked nights for a month
That's it
Any friends
No
Ever see her with someone else
No
Did she ever mention any friends
No
(pointing) Ask Irene over there
He gestures thru a door that leads out to the diner, pointing out a woman behind the counter
(continued) Now, her name _is_ Irene and it _is_ night
Don't take it any further than that
There's nothin' good about it
21
'  - They sit at the counter and  comes over to them
Behind her is the coffee and she is working on a cigarette
Lipstick smeared on the coffee cup
Take a good look around
There's nobody in this place - you're meetin' the reason why
What'll it be
How come Jack let's you work here
Jack and  are united in holy matrimony
Say no more
Stanley is casing the restaurant as Irene pours them a couple of cups of coffee
(showing credentials) Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond
'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
Jack said you knew her
How well
She only worked here a month
Nice girl
Never seemed to get here on time though
Ask me she had a little problem with -- She makes a sniff to indicate a "cocaine problem"
(continued) Came looking for a job with a friend of hers
Pretty girl
Could've been her sister
What happened to her
There was only one job
Teresa took the job
Her friend took a hike
Never saw her again
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine
No
Do you take cocaine, Irene
No,  do not
never took cocaine or any other drugs
don't take drugs
Nicotine is a drug
Caffeine is a drug
Who's Shorty
Those drugs are legal
He's with me
(back on the track) Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out
've thought about that
think her death is what you would call a "freak accident"
Thanks
An  , long and skinny, smoking, gets Desmond's attention
You talking about that little girl that was murdered
You have something to tell us
Yeah
What
can tell shit from shinolah
Gets me along way down that road
Desmond moves away from him
You think we ought to question him
Desmond looks down at the coffee cup in Stanley's _left_hand_
What time is it, Stanley
Stanley checks his watch pouring hot coffee on himself
Oh
Desmond guides his laugh into a cough
(looking at his watch while his legs burn) Agent Desmond, it's
It's late, Sam
(to himself as be dabs his pants with napkins) It's not late, it's early
Really early
Irene comes up to them with her purse in her hand
She is going off duty
You know,  never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead
What do you mean
Her left arm
It was numb
She said she couldn't use it
Said it had no feeling
Probably from the drugs she was taking
(after a beat) just thought  ought to tell you
Thanks
Stanley watches her leave
doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve
could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland
think that's a good idea
22
'  - As Desmond and Stanley head towards their car
think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park
Are you speaking to me in a code
No, Sam, 'm speaking plainly and  mean just exactly what  say
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park
Irene walks past them and towards the parking lot
Thanks, Irene
Good
(catch themselves) Good morning
Thank god it is morning
23
- Desmond and Stanley drive thru to the manager's trailer which is surrounded by a small white picket fence
They park and step to the trailer
Desmond knocks twice on the door
From inside they hear a voice that makes Cole's voice sound like a whisper
, ,
Just then Desmond and Stanley notice a sign on the door that reads
"     9 " '
Nine's really late
We are really early
They both fumble for their badges as they hear the manager coming closer to the door
They meet the manager,
God damn, this better be important
He stops in the middle of this when he sees the badges
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley
Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse
(takes one step out of his trailer) , Carl steps thru the little picket fence's gate and leads them towards Teresa's Trailer
(continued) Mrs
Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town
Teresa rented it about a month ago
Did she have someone with her
Right
She had a friend with her
The friend took off
Was there an argument
Not that  know of
But arguments do happen, don't they
Yes they do
Did she have visitors
No, hey,  already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff "Not-Quite-Able"
Here's the trailer now
He swings open the door
(continued) And this is exactly the way she left it never touched a
(frustration rising) Desmond and Stanley go in
24
' Desmond smells the room
He and Stanley look around
Stanley leans over to Desmond
(whispers) She lived alone
She must have known someone
Desmond notices her personal effects on the dresser, but no ring
(continued) You better dust this place, Sam
'll get my kit
25 Stanley walks towards the car
He writes in his note book
(to himself) 5,600 dollars
26
' Desmond notices a picture hanging on the wall
Takes the picture down and looks at it thru his magnifying glass
(more) - Teresa Banks is wearing a ring
Stanley returns with his equipment
Desmond shows him the photograph
Take a look at this
She's wearing a ring
Stanley studies it
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway
(squinting at the picture) May  see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond
(takes a look, then looks at Desmond) There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring
Carl leans in from the outside
'm gonna make myself some Good Morning America
You want some
Both nod "yes"
: 27
'  - Stanley is finishing up his work
Carl brings them their coffee
Desmond tastes the coffee under Sam's watchful eye
You weren't kiddin'
This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend
That's right
That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here
(watching Desmond drink) We really do need a good "wake me up", don't we, Agent Desmond
(after a long look from Desmond) We really do need a good "wake me up", don't we, Agent Desmond
sticks her head into the trailer
She has an ice pack over one eye and a load of idle curiosity
Desmond notices her
Did you know Teresa Banks
She just nods in the negative and leans back out
Behind her is Deputy Cliff, who looks into the trailer
Hey, how's
Edgar doin'
(to Carl) Bet you appreciate them bustin' your mornin' in half, eh, Carl
Bet they woke you up
They're only doing their job
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy
Maybe  just live here, what do you think about that
Can  ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered
You can tell
Edgar that  was at a party and  got fifteen fuckin' witnesses
Maybe if you did a little less partyin' that little girl would still be alive
Is that right, Mr
Jack Daniels
Did you know Teresa Banks
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her
That's it
By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman could ask you the same question
No you couldn't
Chet steps towards Cliff who looses his balance and has to step off the trailer steps
28
- Desmond stands in the doorway of the trailer and watches Cliff get into his car and drive to work
Stepping away from the trailer Desmond spots something underneath
He bends down and retrieves a Titleist Golf Ball
Is there a golf course around here
Not a lot around here, no
Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls
Desmond drops the ball in a plastic bag and gives it to Stanley who puts it in his kit
Desmond turns to Carl
Thanks for your help, Carl
Sorry we woke you up
That's alright
was having a bad dream
was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline
Desmond and Stanley nod to Carl and walk to their car
couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer
You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond
He's not the murderer
(after a beat) But he's a bozo
Yes, he is like a clown
Desmond walks around the car to the drivers' side and gets in
29
'  - The     sits outside as Desmond and Stanley pull up
30
,  '  - Cable and Cliff meet Desmond and Stanley as they come in the door
The    sits nearby
The secretary is behind her desk
What the hell is that thing doing out there
You're not taking that body anywhere
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it
Maybe not _a_ thing, but maybe _two_ things
Teresa Banks had a ring
Any idea what happened to it
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring
(turning to Stanley) Sam, get the body and put it in the van
(to Cable) Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered
(flexing the muscles in his arm) My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel
He reaches out and stops Stanley from going out to get the body
Cable smiles menacingly at Desmond
(continued) Cliff told me you asked him the same thing
Why don't we step around back and we'll have our final "discussion" out doors
Cable exits followed by Cliff and the giggling secretary
(coming close to Desmond) When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond
don't take it, Sam
give it
31
'  - Desmond, Cliff, Stanley, Cable, the secretary and the  van driver all have stepped outside by the pile of iron bars
Now,
Edgar, 'm going to take off my badge, here
Do you mind
(takes his badge off) The only way you're going to get that body is over mine
He picks up a steel bar and bends it ala the picture in his office
(to Desmond) You try that you little monkey
think 'll take off my badge as well
Desmond takes his coat and badge off
Cable takes his shirt off and Desmond follows
Cable is bare-chested and Desmond is in  issue underwear
Desmond goes to pick up an iron bar and Cable hits him with a sucker punch
As Desmond bends away from this Cable rushes at him
Desmond stops him with a few well placed punches to his face
Cable falls down and Desmond stands over him
Chet picks up the steel bar and bends it
He then tosses the bar away
Cable stands up and rushes at Desmond who flips and flops him around
Cable tries one more grand roadhouse punch which Desmond expertly ducks
(eyeing Cable's glass jaw) This one's comin' from
Edgar
Desmond blasts him in the jaw and Cable goes over - lights out, all systems down
The no longer giggling secretary and Cliff stand and stare
Desmond looks at them
Who's next
After a moment of unbearable humiliation they shuffle away
: 32
'  - Stanley and the driver finish loading the body into the van
Desmond and Stanley talk
Take the van back to Portland, Stanley
'm going to take one more look at the trailer park
They walk towards the van until Stanley stops
(confidentially) One thing that has been troubling me
That lamp at the diner
Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring
Faulty wiring
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond
(extends his hand) 'm Sam Stanley
If you ever need me
Thanks, Sam, for the good work
You have a good eye for detail
We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond
Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose
Desmond smiles at Stanley as they shake
' As he enters the van, Desmond can barely make out what Stanley says as he points to the driver
(very muffled) 83,000 dollars
33
- Desmond is standing in front of Teresa's trailer with Carl Rodd
(motioning behind and to the right of Teresa's trailer) And that's Deputy Cliff's trailer over there
The red one
Right
'll be in my trailer if you need me
Carl walks away towards his trailer
Desmond walks over and around Cliff's red trailer
He gets a strange feeling
He looks past Teresa's trailer to the edge of the trailer park, where he sees a appear in the window of a trailer
Then the hand disappears
Desmond walks to that trailer
He knocks on the door but no one answers
He looks under the trailer and sees a _mound_of_dirt_with_ _a_small_indentation_at_the_top_
In the indentation is _Teresa_ _Bank's_ring_
As he reaches out and touches it, _he_disappears_
34
' ,  - Cole and   talk
,
Six to eight hands clapping
was referring to the possibility of a little silence
The phone rings and Cole answers it
35 , in the doorway across the hall, talks to  in the next room
While he talks he does some isometrics against the door frame
know you haven't changed your hair and 've seen that beautiful dress before, but  must say, Diane, you look sensational today
Diane says something else that we cannot hear
(enjoying this) No,  am not trying to buy time
It's Thursday and  know you have changed something in the room
and this time you've done very well
(stalling) And  am going to tell you exactly what it is
in a moment
you have moved
(snaps his fingers) Got it
It's the clock, you've moved it 12 inches to the left
(a laugh) Another triumph for the dashing Agent Cooper
And you, Diane, now have to clean the coffee cup, get fresh ground coffee from Sally and make a damn great pot of coffee
Cooper with a triumphant smile walks over to join Cole and Albert
But Cole's stern look takes his smile away
What is it, Gordon
, 36
' ,  - All around the walls of Stanley's apartment are work benches with adding machinery sitting on top of them
In the middle of the room is a portable plastic pool, with milky white water and crystallized salt formations clinging to the sides like quartz rocks
From one odd looking piece of machinery there are wires which extend into the pool
Cooper's eyes go to the pool and back to Stanley as Sam talks about Desmond
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time
He had me drive the van with the body back here
Which we did
It was 105 miles
Anything else
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil
'm up to speed, Stanley
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant
And neither will
(understanding) Oh, alright
(reflecting) You know,  liked Agent Desmond
He had his own
Stanley turns to one of his work tables and shows Cooper the Whiteman machine
cracked the Whiteman case with this
(trying to stop him) Stanley,  heard all about it
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this
Tell me about the letter
Take a look at this
Chet and  found it under Teresa Banks' ring fingernail
Cooper looks under the microscope to see the letter they found on Teresa
And no one found the ring
No, sir, we did not
Cooper straightens up from the microscope
Stanley extends his hand
'm Sam Stanley, if you ever need me
37
- Carl Rodd shows Cooper to Teresa's trailer
'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system
Don't you folks talk to one another
That's her trailer there and  haven't touched a god damn thing
Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer (gestures to the red trailer) which  showed him
went back to my trailer
(gestures back to his) After that  never saw him again
Thank you, Carl
Cooper starts walking in the opposite direction from Cliff's trailer picking up on the same odd vibe that struck Desmond
(turning back) That's not the way to Cliff's trailer told you
am not going to Cliff's trailer
Well, where are you going
am going over here
(coming along with him) God damn, you people are confusing
Cooper reaches a pack of dirt which is now creased with tire tracks
What was here, Mr
Rodd
trailer was here
What the hell do you think
Can you tell me who's trailer it was
and who stayed in the trailer
An old woman and her grandson
Can you tell me what their names were
Chalfont
Weird
Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did
Two Chalfonts
Cooper kneels to examine the tracks left by the exited trailer
As he kneels and inspects the tracks he is overcome by the presence of
Cooper struggles to his feet and looks around
Under a tree and close to the tracks is a car
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle
Yep, it sure is
Cooper walks to it
' Cooper inspects the car
Coming around to the front of the car he notices the windshield
On the windshield someone has written the words, "Let's Rock"
38
,    - Cooper stares into the stream
(dictating into his recorder) Diane, it's 4:20 in the afternoon
am standing here at Wind River where they found the body of Teresa Banks
Diane, this case has got a strange feeling for me
Not only has Agent Chester Desmond disappeared but this is one of Cole's Blue Rose cases
The clues that were found by Agent Desmond and Agent Stanley have lead to dead ends
The letter below the fingernail gives me the feeling that the killer will strike again
But like the song says, "
who knows where or when"
39
- Shot of the Twin Peaks Sign
Then on screen it reads: - 40
- walking towards us
The picture of a Homecoming Queen
41
,  - Re-establish
On screen it reads: ", " 42
' Cooper talks with Cole
Gordon, it is 10:10, on February 15th
was worried about today from the dream  told you about
(not sure what to say) Cooper looks at the calendar in the room and checks his watch
He walks from the room
43
- Cooper stares into the lens of the camera for a moment
Then sprints to the Surveillance Room
44 Cooper stares at the monitor
Sees nothing on the screen but an empty hallway
45
- Nice sunny day
The dity in all its glory
On screen it reads: " " 46
- checks into the hotel
Here's your key, Mr
Jeffries
hope you enjoy your stay here at The Palm Deluxe
(grabs a note) This is for you
The joven
ah
young lady
she left it
Rings the bell
appears
Young, sweating, and eager
Jeffries hands him the key
612 --- very nice
He picks up Jeffries' bag and heads for the elevator
47
- Cooper runs out to the hall again stares into the camera
He stays there for a moment then runs back to the Surveillance Room
48
- Cooper stares at the monitor which still shows an empty hallway
49
- He runs back out the door into the hallway
Behind him at the end of the hall a door opens and _Phillip_Jeffries_who_moments_ago_was_in_ _Buenos_Aires_ enters the hallway headed towards Cooper, but Cooper doesn't see him because he is staring intently into the camera as he has done twice before
50
- Cooper races into the room and stares into the monitor
51 This time Cooper is amazed to see himself staring into the camera, and behind him is Phillip Jeffries coming towards him and the camera
On the screen Jeffries walks past Cooper
(shouting) Gordon
Cooper runs into Gordon's office

' As Cooper gets to Gordon's office, Albert and Cole are standing there staring bug eyed at Phillip Jeffries
Albert stands up
Phillip
Jeffries moves into the room
Cooper steps into the office
Phillip
, Jeffries stares at the threesome
'm not going to talk about Judy
Keep Judy out of this
But
Cole calms Cooper
,
(pointing at Cooper) Who do you think that is there
(trying to calm Jeffries) Suffered some bumps on the old noggin', eh, Phil
(pointing at Cooper) '
(focusing on Jeffries) , want to tell you everything, but  don't have a lot to go on
But 'll tell you one thing:  Judy is positive about this
How interesting
thought we were going to keep Judy out of this
Jeffries stumbles to a chair
Listen to me carefully
saw one of their meetings
It was above a convenience store
Who's meeting
Where have you been
, , ' It was a dream
(takes Albert by the arm) We live inside a dream
And it's raining Post Toasties
(shouting) ,
found something
in Seattle at Judy's
And then, there they were
Albert is about to say something, but is stopped by Cole's gentle pressure on his arm
They sat quietly for hours
53
- in a large, barren, filthy room
Cheap plastic storm windows flap in the cold wind
In the foreground the Man From Another Place (Mike) and  sit at a formica table
Behind them on plastic torn chairs huddle
and her with full beards sit quietly
(subtitled) We have descended from pure air
(subtitled) Going up and down
Intercourse between the two worlds
(subtitled) Light of new discoveries
(subtitled) Why not be composed of materials and combinations of atoms
' (subtitled) This is no accident
(subtitled) This is a formica table
Green is its color
He touches the table
(subtitled) Our world
(subtitled) With chrome
Any everything will proceed cyclically
(subtitled) Boneless
(subtitled) Yes, find the middle place
Bob begins to scream with anger
(subtitled) ' (subtitled) Fell a victim
The Man From Another Place raises his hand

Bob claps his hand and a circle of fire appears in the room

Jeffries begins to cry quietly at his table
(to himself) The ring
ring
(hinting) , ' After a hesitation, Albert gets the "message" and discreetly leaves the room
(continued) , ' Cole tries to raise someone on the intercom but it doesn't seem to have any juice
(continued) (into the speaker) He is getting nothing
The static begins to build on the intercom
The wiring in the wall and the flourescent lights start to hum as well
(continued) (pounds on the intercom) Hearing "May", Jeffries turns and stares at a _calendar_on_the_wall_
Move into Jeffries
May
1989
: Staring at the calendar
it is 1989
Cooper looks out of the room to see if anyone is coming to help Cole who is still trying to get the intercom to work
The static grows even louder
Cole turns back to Jeffries
_But_there_is_no_one_there_
Jeffries is gone
Papers from Cole's desk are now sticking to Jeffries chair
'
(coming back into the room) What
,
' (on the phone) 've got the front desk right now
He never was here
No record of him entering the building
and the doctors should be here any minute
(frustration building) , , What's going on
Albert rushes back into the room
, Teresa Banks
Tylenol
(to Cooper) ,
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed
'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again
,
No offense, sir, but after a day with you it is mandatory
55
- Jeffries is suddenly standing in the second story hallway of the Buenos Aires Palm Deluxe Hotel
The wall behind him is seared black and smoking
terrified  is whimpering and scampering away from Jeffries trying to stave away an epileptic fit
She is looking at him like he is the devil personified
The bellhop had run further away, but has turned back to see Jeffries reappear
He is afraid to come any closer
(to Bellhop) Hey
hey
(half crying) Oh, Mr
Jeffries
De shit it come out of my ass
Santa Maria, where did you go
They stare at each other as the blackened wall continues to smoke

On screen it reads: " -   " Laura stops and turns
We suddenly find ourselves in front of the Hayward House
Donna
Donna
' gathering her books and coming out the door
Just a minute, Laura
58 Donna joins Laura
If  am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick
You didn't do your homework
Noooo
(a pal) Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems  told you about last week
You remember the
Don't tell me now
Tell me right before the test
won't be able to remember long enough
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen
Thanks
Laura tweaks Donna's cheek
James called me last night looking for you
When
The usual, 9:15
He probably wanted to drive over
Were you with Bobby
Or are you two still fighting
No, and yes
don't know what 'm going to do about Bobby
know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks 'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"
don't know what to do
You know what your problem is
(smiles) You're just too adorable
(smiles back) You know,  think you're right
'm just too adorable
Donna grabs her and shakes her shoulders
(sing-song) Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable
(joining her - laughing) 'm just too adorable
'm just too adorable
They continue up the sidewalk laughing

of their  watch Laura and Donna with love and worship
They sing a kind of pining but cool  with knees bent and arms outstretched
"Laura
Donna
Laura
Donna
" On Donna as they continue down the hall
cool   snaps his fingers ala Bobby for Donna to come to him
Without missing a beat Donna changes directions
Mike has to hustle to catch up with her
(putting his arm around Donna) That's why you need a real man, Babe, you're tough to handle
And you're the real man
61
' moves up behind Laura and pushes close to her
James
Laura, 'll meet you at 2:30 after phys
ed
Okay
James smiles and walks off
Laura enters the girls' room
62
'  - Laura ducks into a stall and does a quick hit of cocaine
The school bell rings simultaneously
63
- saunters into school - late as usual
The corridor is empty
Everyone else is in class
He walks to Laura's portrait in the trophy case
Kisses the glass protecting it
Hey, Baby
He continues on happy and ultra-cool to his class
: 64 It reads:  2:30
65
'  - James waits for Laura amidst the cleaning drums and brooms
The door swings open and Laura slides in wearing only a towel
They embrace in the half light
Laura, do you love me
Yes,  love you
've told you, but it doesn't really matter
Why
It does
No, it doesn't
just kiss me
It does matter
We're in love
James, you don't know what you are talking about
Quit trying to hold on so tight
'm gone
long gone like a turkey through the corn
You're not a turkey
turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth
(small smile) Gobble, gobble, gobble
He smiles
She kisses him and he responds
Don't ever leave, Laura, ever
'll never leave you
Laura moves into him
hopeless embrace
His eyes full of hope and Laura's empty
She pulls him to the floor to make love
66
- bell rings and, after a moment,  and  start to move out
Bobby catches up with Laura and Donna
66
: Where were you for the last hour
've been lookin' for you
was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around
(laughing with Donna) If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down
Bobby grabs her roughly and spins her around
Students stop and stare
(very angry) '  '
Get lost Bobby
Oh, yeah
You'll be callin' soon and maybe 'm not gonna be there
(very smooth, cooing) Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles
Bobby can't hold onto his anger
Slowly a huge smile spreads across his face
(smiling) Love ya, Babe
: 67
,   - Donna and Laura
Eating nuts
Donna is stretched out on the sofa and Laura is in a chair with her legs over the top
She is almost upside down
Nothing going on
rolls through the living room in her wheelchair and makes a quick check of the nut supply
Hi,
(with a nod to Laura) (to Donna) Mom
Eileen motors out
(continued) (to Laura) Are you going to see James tonight
Why are you suddenly so interested in who  am going to see at night
Nighttime is my time
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it
you're not going to see Bobby, are you
Maybe
Oh god, Laura
Well, why not
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself
He's a goon
(she sighs to herself) James is the  one
(getting very dreamy) He loves you with that "lasting love"
"true love"
Laura looks at Donna
Yes, James is very sweet
Why don't you get out your violin, Donna
Sweet
God, he's gorgeous
James is very sweet and very gorgeous
Donna drifts off
wonder if Mike could ever write a poem
Both of them drift off
(continued) Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster
Faster and faster
For a long time you wouldn't feel anything
Then you would burst into fire
forever
Donna studies her friend and thinks about what she has said
After a beat
Maybe  better start our homework
Okay,  suppose  should go home
Call me
Sure
What do you want me to call you
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner
They laugh
68
- Laura coming home from Donna's
69 Laura comes in the front door
No one seems to be home
Mom
Mom
No answer - she heads up to her room
70
, Laura moves up to her bedroom
71
'  - Laura comes into her room and drops her books on her bed
She goes to the window and opens it - takes a package of cigarettes out, pulls one out and lights it
She goes to her "public" diary which she keeps on her desk
Opens it to page one takes out a packet full of cocaine
Like a pro she takes out her "cocaine gadget" from her purse and takes a snort
Then another
Big sigh of relief
Now she moves to her "private" diary behind her dresser - gets a pen, ready to write and starts to freak out
Pages are missing
First, she discovers one, then more
Laura panics
Dropping her cocaine gadget back into her purse and taking her private diary, she sprints from the room
72
,   - Laura runs down the steps nearly colliding with her mom,  , coming home with a load of groceries
cigarette in her mouth
Laura, honey
(smoke going into her tearing eyes) Cigarette
Cigarette
Laura takes it out of her mouth
Can  take the car
Sure honey, what's the hurry
forgot my books at school
Laura runs from the house
Laura
What
Laura looks back to see her mom dangling the car keys in front of her
Laura comes back to get the keys still holding the burning cigarette
Sarah sternly takes the cigarette from Laura's hand
As they make the exchange
You'll never be a smoker if you don't (continued) start
mean it
Takes a drag
With barely a nod, Laura is gone
73
- Laura speeds through Lotown in her mom's '56 Roadmaster Buick
74
'  - Laura skids up outside the apartment
Then backs the car up to a darker, more enclosed area amongst some trees
Cautiously, she gets out of the car and then hurries to Harold's door
Laura frantically knocks at the door
answers
Laura
75
'  - Laura rushes past him to the sofa, opening the book for him to see
My secret diary
There are pages missing
Who would do that
Bob
But Bob isn't real
The pages are gone
That's real
Maybe
Bob is real
He's been "having" me since was 12
Stunned, Harold doesn't know what to do
(continued) The diary was hidden too well
He's the only one who could know where it was
He's getting to know me, now
He's real He speaks to me
What does Bob say
(whisper) He wants to be me
or he will kill me
No
No
(strangely) Oh, yes
yes
Laura starts towards him frightening Harold
What
Please
She allows the feeling of Bob to come over her and she begins to scream
Harold steps back, but Laura grabs him
To his face with a horrifying expression on hers
She buries herself on his shoulder
(whispers) The trees
the trees
They break
(continued) You have to hide the diary, Harold
You made me write it all down
He doesn't know about you
You'll be safe
She stares at Harold
Her eyes widen, terrified with suspicion
You're not Bob are you, Harold
If you are, you can kill me right now
Kill me right now, if you are
Laura, no, 'm not
'm not Bob
(begins to shake and cry) Poor Laura
wish  could help you
He holds her
hate him,  hate it
Sometimes  love it
But now 'm afraid
am so afraid
But you're strong Laura
so much stronger than
How can  help you can't
can't even go outside
Laura reaches up and tenderly touches his cheek
(continued) What about James
Can't James help you
You two are so in love
(flat) He's in love with a girl who's dead
(handing him the diary) It _is_ dangerous for you to have it
'm sorry
(thinking only of her) 'm so sorry, Laura
She pulls him to her and kisses him passionately
don't know when  can come back
Maybe never
Laura slowly goes out the door
Harold can only watch
76
'  - Laura goes out to the car
77
/
- Laura starts the car and takes a snort of cocaine
Laura pulls out onto the highway
We stay with her watching her face - struggling with the prospects of the terrifying future
78
- Laura rushes in to find her mom setting the table
Sarah stops and stares at Laura
You lied to me about those school books
found them upstairs on your bed
(suspicion and paranoia) What were you doing in my room
was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which  found balled up in the bottom of your closet
Now why did you lie to me
Where did you go
had to see Bobby
know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and  didn't think you would understand
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me
Ever
You can tell me anything
'll understand
'm sorry, Mom
Now hurry, dinner's almost ready
Your father says he's starving
: 79
- Laura is already at the table
Sarah puts the rest of the dinner on the table and sits down just as   enters from the kitchen
He is pretending he is a giant
Using a voice like a giant
(big giant voice) Hello, Laura
Hello Sarah
Where's my axe
(singing) "'m hungry"
Oh, Leland
(embarrassed) Dad
(suddenly speaking Norwegian) Hyggelig a mote dem
Jeg Heter Leland Palmer
Translation is:  How are you
My name is Leland Palmer
Laura and Sarah stare at him
The Norwegians are coming next week and  want you to learn to say what just learned in Norwegian
So you can talk to them
want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer"
But my name isn't Leland Palmer
Neither is mine
And can't we talk about something serious for a change
This is serious
Mr
Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and  want both of you to learn to introduce yourself
Sarah, you first
Leland repeats his phrase for Sarah's benefit
Hyggelig a mote dem
Jeg Heter Leland Palmer
Sarah stumbles through it
Hyggelig a mote dem
Jeg Heter Sarah Palmer
Leland repeats his phrase back to her
Extends his hand in a friendly handshake
Good
We'll practice some more
Laura, now you try it
54
79
: (2) Laughingly, Laura does the same thing
Hyggelig a mote dem
Jeg Heter Laura Palmer
After Laura is done
All together now
Leland extends a hand to each of them
An air of insanity seems to come over the Palmer dining room as they all begin to laugh hysterically and talk in broken Norwegian
: 80
'  - The clock reads:  11:30
Laura's hands open the window and release the screen
Laura silently sneaks out the window and down the side of her house
81
- big semi comes to a stop at a wide spot in the road
Laura climbs into the truck
82
- The  smiles
Eager
Friend of Leo's, right
Partyland
Laura begins to unbutton her blouse
Turns and sneaks a toot of cocaine
(continued) (catching her) Wait a minute
Leo says this is my party
Laura puts her hand between his legs
If you can fuck and drive the party starts right now
Momentarily taken aback, the trucker stares at her
Laura takes his hand and puts it on the gear shift
(continued) You shift that one
This one's mine
She climbs over on top of him
83
- The stack blows
The truck rolls away onto the road
We watch it as it moans into the distance - the sound slowly diminishing and fading
Natures' nighttime sounds take over
Finally, we hear the _hooting_ _of_an_owl_
84
- Reestablish
85
- Albert and Cooper
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads
Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association
The world is a hologram, Albert
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper
Albert
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder
Yes
Either right now or right when thought of it
The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me
Lately have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again
Because it is only a feeling,  am powerless to stop it
And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it
Let's test it for the record
Will the next victim be a man or a woman
woman
What color hair will she have
Blonde
Tell me some other things about her
She's in high school
She's sexually active
She's on drugs
She's crying out for some help
You're describing half the high school girls in America
(off Cooper's look) What is she doing right now
(closing his eyes to see a mental picture) She is preparing a great abundance of food
Albert lets go a small laugh of disbelief and shakes his head in exasperation
86
- Establish
87
- Laura comes out of the kitchen stacking some of her "Meals on Wheels" on the counter
On screen it reads: " -   " and   watch from the cash register
Shelly is ringing someone out, handing back their change
Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"
'm kind of busy, Norma
You're not busy, sweetheart, now go
With a little squeeze of the hand and a gentle shove, Norma moves Shelly towards Laura who is at the end of the counter
The door opens to the Diner and  and   come in
Nadine stops when she sees Norma
changed my mind,  don't want any coffee, Eddie
Nadine goes out
As she walks past Ed he looks at Norma and makes a "What can  do" gesture
Sorry, Norma
Ed goes out
Shelly approaches sheepishly
Can  give you a hand getting the dinners together
That's alright, Shelly
know you have better things to do
(disregarding the jab) Norma asked me to give you a hand
Okay
You can help me carry them to the car
Shelly gathers up a pile of the dinners and takes them out to the "Meals on Wheels" car
88
- Shelly loads her stuff in the back
She returns to the diner and Laura follows doing the same
As Laura places her dinners in the back something catches her eye and she turns
' Mrs
Tremond and her grandson are standing in the parking lot staring at Laura
Mrs
Tremond waves to Laura to come over
When Laura comes to them Mrs
Tremond holds out a framed picture
This would look nice on your wall
She hands Laura the picture
It is a picture of a room with flowered wallpaper and a dark doorway in its corner
Laura's study of it is interrupted by the grandson
He's looking for a book with pages torn out
He's walking towards the hiding place
He's moving under the fan now
Shelly comes out of the Diner with another load of meals
Laura turns back to her and then back to the Tremonds, who are walking away from her and are farther away than they realistically could be
Laura comes to Shelly in a panic
Shelly, you really can help me
can't do the "Meals on Wheels" today
just can't
Okay
Laura runs off
Shelly puts her load into the car as she watches Laura
89
- Shelly goes to Norma
Laura just took off
She asked me to do the run today
Should  do it
What's with that Laura
Yeah, sure, take a look around
There's no one here anyway
You're right
There's no one here
There's no one here
Norma, are you alright
Norma just turns away and picks up some dirty dishes
Come back as soon as you can
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that am out doing the "Meals on Wheels"
Don't worry, Shelly, 'll handle Leo
Shelly leaves the diner
In the empty diner Norma walks over and sits in a booth
She studies the empty diner
After a while the cook, , calls from the kitchen
distant forlorn call
Kind of quiet
: She starts to cry
90
- Laura runs home
Holding the picture from Mrs
Tremond throughout
(frantic whispers) He's looking for the book, he's going to the hiding place
' She stops and stares
Her house suddenly looks very frightening to her
She slowly crosses her front yard and enters the house
91
- Laura comes in the front door still holding the picture
She crosses thru the dining room
92
,  - Laura moves ever so slowly up the stairs - the fan still and silent above her
At the top of the stairs, she stops and stares at her bedroom door
Her whole body is shaking
Her hand goes out in front of her
She touches her bedroom door and inches it open
93
'  - The opening of the door reveals more and more of her room
Suddenly it reveals Bob standing in her room at her dresser
He has pulled the dresser away from the wall looking for something
He is frozen
Smiling at her
With a scream, Laura bolts from her room
94
- Laura races out of the house still holding Tremond's picture
95
' ' Laura runs across two yards to a large tree and falls to her knees, crying
She looks up and sees her father come out the front door of her house
She watches him cross to his car and drive away
(frantic whisper) What
It can't be
It can't be him
no
no
Laura is coming apart, sobbing
Behind her, on the sidewalk, a  has noticed her
Laura
closer look reveals how upset Laura is
What
Laura are you all right
Laura turns away so the woman can't see her crying
The woman takes a couple of steps off the sidewalk onto the grass
(trying to hold it together) lost my necklace
it must have fallen
Laura mimes that she has found her gold half-heart necklace
She pretends to be clasping her gold half-heart necklace which was already around her neck
(clumsily) Oh, here it is
Woman moves back to the sidewalk
Well, 'm glad you found it, darling
Slowly, Laura stands and moves away - leaving Mrs
Tremond's picture on the grass under the tree
96 Laura stands in front of her house
Terrified
97
- No Bob
Listens to the house
stands in the entrance way
98
- Laura listens
Hears nothing
99 She stops and stares at the fan then slowly makes her way up the stairs towards her room
100
'  - No Bob in her room
The dresser is back in its place
Laura races out
101
- Laura runs down the sidewalk
102
- Donna answers the door
Laura stands there out of breath
Laura
Donna, are you my best friend
Of course
Laura dives toward Donna and into a hug
What is it Laura
What's wrong
just want a friend
Just one friend for just one minute
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life
Yes, that's what  want
Thanks
Okay,
(looks into Laura's eyes, a step toward confronting something unspoken) am your friend
always
But sometimes
lately
feel that you don't like being around me because  am so uptight
(off Laura's look) No,  am uptight
hate it
don't want to be this way, but Laura  don't mean
'm your friend no matter what way you are
You know, even when  think about your face  get happier
They go in and sit down on the couch
Do you want to talk
No,  want to smoke
She digs for a cigarette in her purse
'm in a mess today, too
(takes a breath) 'm thinking about doing it with Mike
What do you think
(still looking for a cigarette) Donna, you are such a crack up
You don't even like Mike
Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight
This is about sex, not like
(yells to the kitchen) Mom, Laura's here and  think  will have one of those huckleberry muffins
(to Laura) You want a muffin
If  can smoke it
You want a muffin
Donna, you are a muffin
They hear   in the kitchen
He walks in with a magician's handkerchief
With a flourish he tries to pull something out of it
Instead he stands there empty handed
The red rose
Where is the red rose
(frustrated) You know the light at Sparkwood and 21
It worked right there
just did it right there
Laura finds a cigarette finally and lights it
(stands and stares at Laura smoking) Why is it that you can't smoke at your home and 'm a doctor and  don't allow smoking in my home and  let you smoke in my home
(smiling her killer smile) Because you love me so much
do love you, you little smoking whipper snapper
Eileen Hayward brings out the muffins on her lap in her wheel chair
All four have muffins
These muffins each have at least seven full huckleberries in them
While eating Doc takes out a piece of paper and stares blankly at it
The girls exchange glances about what Dad is doing as they chew on the muffins
Doc is struggling
Dad, what in the world are you doing
What the hell is this
Donna peeks over his shoulder
It's a prescription
Is it
Dad
My handwriting is so bad that now can't even read it
You girls better hurry up and graduate from high school so you can take care of me
We'll take care of you
They go over to Doc and give him a knuckle rub
Eileen laughs along with the two girls
The phone rings and Doc gets it
(on the phone) Yep, she's right here, Leland
(to Laura) It's for you
It's your father
Laura goes tentatively to the phone
Hello
' Time to come home for dinner, honey
Laura hangs up the phone
gotta go
Donna leads Laura to the door
There is something wrong and Donna is beginning to feel it
Donna tries to cheer her up
Goodbye, Muffin
No, you're the muffin
Laura leaves
As Donna closes the door, Laura calls back to her
No, you're right
am the muffin
103
- Laura comes in the door and there is Leland at the dining room table ready for dinner
Leland sees her
Hi, honey, how's Donna
Fine
School
school's fine
Sit down
sit down
Are you hungry
Not really
66
103
: Laura just plops into her seat
You didn't wash your hands before you sat down for dinner did you
From across the table Leland looks at her fingernails
He stands to come for a closer look
Let me see
Dad
: ' Your hands are filthy
look, there is dirt way under this fingernail
Sarah, cigarette draped from her lips, is delivering some mashed potatoes to the table
Leland, what are you doing
Look at this finger here
He is looking at
Leland
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner
(noticing the necklace) And look at this
He reaches for it
Laura's hand flies up and stops him
Leland's other hand comes up and she lets him take the   out
Oh, is this from a lover
Laura has no response
(continued) Did you get this from your lover
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland
Bobby didn't give you this
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that
Leland starts pinching Laura's cheek
(as he is pinching) Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new
Leland leave her alone
She doesn't like that
Stop it
How do you know what she doesn't like
beat then a return to what is normal
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner
Oh, 'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands
Leland sits stoically
Laura rises from the table
104
- As Laura washes her hands, she stares at her reflection
Terrified
: 105
' ' It says:  10:35
106
' Sarah and Leland get ready for bed
Leland stops, stands frozen for a moment, then begins to cry
What is it, Leland
Leland can barely speak
can't remember the last time  told Laura that  loved her
Sarah goes to Leland
They embrace, tenderly, across the many years of their strained marriage
Well, honey, go in and tell her now
107
' Laura stares at the hands of the clock
With a start, she looks up
Her father is in her room
He stands in the doorway
Laura, honey
He moves to her and touches her face
(continued) love you
love you so much
Laura can hardly speak
She squeezes his hand
Goodnight, Princess
He leaves the room
Laura watches the door close
She sits frozen for a moment, with a tear in her eye, then she remembers something
' The picture lies there in the night dew under the tree in the neighbor's yard
108
,  '  - Laura goes down the trellises and runs across the lawn
109
'  - Laura hunts around the tree for the picture, finally finds it
She runs back towards her house
110
'  - Laura climbs through the window and hangs the picture on a little hook on the wall and crawls into bed
She turns off the light and stares at the picture in the dark
: 111
'  - She is asleep
112
' We hold on the picture
As if by magic, we suddenly begin to move into the picture - into the room in the picture and thru the dark doorway in the room in the picture
On the other side of the dark doorway there is another room
Mrs
Tremond is standing in that room
She is beckoning us towards her and beyond her thru yet another doorway
We move thru the second doorway and on the other side of that doorway there is another room
Mrs
Tremond's grandson is standing in that room
He is holding his hands above him as if he is grasping an imaginary glass ball
As we move towards the space between his hands a ring of fire appears there and we move thru that into
113 The     walks into the red room to a table
ring lies upon the table
The Man From Another Place turns toward Cooper
Is it future
Or is it past
Do you know who  am
am the Arm
And sound like this
The Man From Another Place puts his hand in front of his lips and makes an Indian Whooping sound
The Man From Another Place picks up the ring and moves it very close to us
We recognize it as Teresa Banks' ring
The symbols on the ring are identical to the symbols of Owl Cave
Cooper seems concerned
(to camera) Don't take the ring
Laura, don't take the ring
The Man From Another Place moves the ring towards us till the ring fills the screen
114
' Laura in a somnambular state is half awakened by a noise
She tries to move her left arm, but it has fallen asleep
She moves it with her right arm
: It sounds as if someone is calling her name
She turns to her right to see who it is, then turning back to her left she discovers   lying in bed with her
Annie has blood around her mouth
She tries to raise herself and strains to speak
My name is Annie
've been with Laura and Dale
The good Dale is in the lodge and he can't leave
Write it in your diary
' Her mother calls her name
The sound is distant and mournful
Laura looks towards her door then turns back to Annie but she is gone
Filled with fear she looks down and in her hand is Teresa Banks' ring
Again, her attention is drawn to her door and her mother's distant call
Still holding the ring she gets out of bed and goes to her door and slowly opens it
It is dark on the other side of the door
' In the doorway Laura gets a strange feeling in back of her and turns to look at Mrs
Tremond's picture
There in the picture is Laura (herself) in the doorway looking back into the darkened rooms where Mrs
Tremond and her grandson were
115
' Laura is in the picture
In the picture Laura turns around in the doorway of the picture and looks down at her room
116
' Laura sees herself asleep in her bed
: Asleep in her bed
She wakes up from her dream
Trying to clear her head
Looks at the photo and nothing is there -- looks like the day before
She looks in her hand and the ring is gone
Laura gets out of bed and goes to Mrs
Tremond's picture hanging on the wall
She stares at it
She slowly takes it off the wall and places it in the trash
Trembling she does two lines of cocaine

- Reestablish
On screen it reads: " -   " James comes by on his bike
He beeps out a signal on the bike's horn
After a beat Laura runs out to him
Where were you last night
We were supposed to get together
You didn't show up
You were supposed to show up
Maybe wasn't
We were supposed to be together
How can  be together if 'm not together
You're on somethin' again, aren't you
James
When am  going to see you
Leland comes out the door of the house
Looks at Laura and James
Laura can feel him staring
gotta go
James just looks at her then guns his bike and roars away
Laura walks back to the front door where her father stands
Who was that
friend from school
special friend
Laura looks at her Dad, eyeball to eyeball for a moment
Then she walks past him to the stairs
118
- The fan turns slowly as Laura goes up the stairs
' Laura
Laura's head snaps around
No
No, go away
' 'm glad you let me talk to you
You used to not let me talk to you
Go away
am not talking to you
' want you
Sarah Palmer is at the bottom of the stairs
Laura
Laura jumps
Laura, now  can't find that blue sweater
Did you take it again
Mom
what are you wearing
Sarah looks down
She is wearing the sweater that she is looking for
My god,  am going to have another breakdown
God, god
Mom, take it easy
Laura starts down the stairs towards her mother
No, no
this can't be happening
Laura holds her mother
Mom, you're not having a nervous breakdown
Sarah pulls away from Laura and wanders into the living room
Laura watches her go feeling helpless
119
'  - is ragging on Shelly
He is down on his hands and knees showing her how to scrub the floor
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot
Shelly,  know where everything in this house is
Sometimes on the road mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is
Lay off the bennies, Leo
(continuing his tirade) Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere
To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface
(shouting) ,
He scrubs more
(continued) That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -
It takes scrubbing, Shelly
There is no easy way
,
As if  didn't know
'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it
Come off it, Leo
'm late for work
What did you say
Leo goes over the top pulls Shelly down to the floor
Shelly,  am not fooling around anymore
The first thing you've got to  on is a good attitude
That's the key
Anybody will tell you that
Gives her a good shot to the back of the head
Shelly falls to the floor
The phone rings
Leo gets up to get the phone
Don't even _think_ about going anywhere, Shelly
'm not finished with you
He answers the phone
What are you doing calling me here
No way, you already owe me money
Five thousand, to be exact
Leo looks over at Shelly suspiciously
(Did she hear him mention the five thousand
) (silently mouthing it) Five Thousand
120
- Bobby is calling from the pay phone at the diner
We hear the end of the conversation with Leo
Bobby hangs up
He puts in another quarter and dials again
The phone rings on the other end
121
- nearly empty Roadhouse
answers the phone behind the bar
How come you only call me when you are desperate
Are you desperate, baby
: 122
- You interested or not
Maybe, Bobby, baby
Maybe
have friend who has what you want
His stuff is the best
Bobby starts to write information down on a napkin
(excited) Jacques
you crazy Canadian
This sounds
123
- Donna drives up in her car and gets out
124
,   - Laura is having a quick shot from the family liquor cabinet
knock on the door
Laura pulls a jacket on and goes to the door
Opens it and sees Donna
Donna looks at her coat
Where are you going
No place, fast
(a warning) And you're not coming
Come on, Laura
'm your best friend
They move back into the living room
(change of subject) Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink
Laura shoots her a look
Where are the Cookies
You mean Fred and Ginger
Dancing
Donna looks around at all the ashtrays filled to the brim with butts
(looking at the cigarettes) If  had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, 'd be dead
Gotta go, Donna
'll call you tomorrow
Laura leaves the house
Donna trails behind
125
- Laura gets into her Mom's Roadmaster and takes off
Donna watches her go and gets in her car and follows
126
- At the first stop sign Laura takes another hit of cocaine
127
- Laura parks her car and gets out
At the entrance to the Roadhouse she meets the  , who seems to be waiting for her
She steps close to Laura
When this kind of fire starts
it is very hard to put out
The Log Lady touches her
Her hand is cooling on Laura's head
Laura moves in behind it
Pushing the cool hand into her face and forehead
(whispers) Margaret
The tender bows of innocence burn first and the wind rises - then all goodness is in jeopardy
They look into each other's eyes
The Log Lady turns and leaves
128
- and the usual gang
On stage a  sings
As Laura comes in she makes eye contact with Jacques Renault who is behind the bar
Laura sits at a table
Jacques nods to a  of   who come over to Laura with drinks
One of them slides her a fifty with a packet of cocaine inside
Let's go around the world, babe
This isn't going to get you to Walla- Walla
They all take a drink
You do go all the way, don't you, little girl
Sooner or later
Laura reaches below the table grabbing him hard by the balls
You willing to go all the way
Huh
You wanna do it for me
All the way for me means all the way -
The trucker turns a couple of shades towards white
Donna comes in just as a beautiful song of lost love begins
Laura and Donna see each other -- As the truckers toss down bourbons and beer chasers, Laura gets _lost_in_the_song_and_starts_to_cry_
Donna just stares at her from the other side of the Roadhouse
Donna stands and walks over to Laura's table
She reaches down, picks up one of the trucker's bourbons and downs it
Let's boogie
(to Donna) You part of the deal
(answering for her) No, she isn't
Laura and Donna stare at each other
For Donna's benefit, Laura turns and gives a big, juicy French kiss to one of the truckers
(to the trucker) What was your name again
Buck
Buck, that was really nice
Donna grabs Buck's buddy, , and gives him the same type kiss
(continued) (very serious) All right, Donna
Let's go

21 - The car barrels down the highway
It's a beat up Chevy Biscayne, with a hot monster engine under the hood
130
() - Tommy drives sitting next to a case of ice cold beer
Donna and Laura sandwich Buck in the back seat
Donna takes a long swig of beer
Laura hides a hit of cocaine from Donna
(to Laura, a little afraid) What are you doing
Nothing
Laura laughs at Donna then holds a beer up to show Donna, then turns and French kisses Buck
Donna reaches forward to the front dash and turns the radio up full blast
Buck and Tommy start to whoop and yodel like cowboys
Buck does an Indian whoop in Laura's face
Laura freezes in horror
131
: The Man From Another Place (The Arm) yodels
132
()/ 21 Slowly Laura reaches over and touches Buck's face and arm
Buck uncorks another yodel
The fear leaves Laura
(to Laura) 'm goin' for it
Donna starts making out with Buck
133
- Establish
Tommy takes the car like a rocket into the parking lot and does a complete three sixty before rocking to a stop
Several big rigs shadow the lot
They all pop out of Buck's car sporting "long necks"
Laura takes a hit of cocaine and looks up to see Donna watching
Buck circles Donna with his big arm and puts a toot under her nose
No
(turns to Laura) don't need to take this to be you friend
,
What a downer you are
(pointing to skid marks behind a heat popping car) Hey, Tommy, Jacques beat us here
Hold on, 'm chokin' the farm fed
Tommy stands in the lot with his back to them, pissing
134
- The front room is a bar and restaurant with about
Above the bar is a sign that reads: -  -  and
' "" The  presses a release underneath the counter that allows Laura to take her three friends thru a door over which a sign hangs announcing in red neon letters: "" 135 The group enters a large room with the filthiest wall to wall carpet imaginable
In the back corner is a small stage
On it a three piece -  is building up toward oblivion
The is dressed in a buffalo skin complete with at least half the buffalo head and horns
He wears spray painted, day glow orange cowboy boots
Some    and  are dancing to the band
In darkened corners away from the stage other groups are racing the band to oblivion
Laura leans over to Donna noticing her shocked look
Don't expect a turkey dog in here
Jacques Renault comes up to the group
Hey, slow pokes, guess what
There's no tomorrow
He grabs Laura up and gives her a big, sloppy wet kiss
Baby, you know why
Cause it'll never get here
Hey, Jacques
(slurred) No "Jacques"
am the Great Went
(for Donna) am The Muffin
And what a muffin you have
The two truckers laugh with Jacques
He mimes a gun with his right hand and pointing it to his forehead pulls the trigger with a weak, slack cheeked puff sound
(slurred) am as blank as a fart
Laura winks at Buck as he  drops a red depth charge into Donna's beer
Hey, Donna, chug-a-lug
As the cowboys gather around and begin to chant, both Laura and Donna chug down their drinks
They finish and Laura smiles and pushes Donna out onto the dance floor
They start to dance expertly and smile at each other
Soon Buck and Tommy cut in separating the two
Buck dances Laura over to  of his buddies
The two of them start to unbutton Laura's blouse as they dance
The hell-metal band kicks into high gear
In the pulsating red and black light Donna sees Laura now topless dancing and kissing with Buck and his friend
Donna stops
Jacques sweeps in
Oh, Laura's friend
am "The Great Went"
Jacques holds her head in his huge hands
(continued) There is no tomorrow
' The room starts to spin
: 136 completely stoned Donna is being dances around by Tommy, who is falling in love with her
Through some dancing legs and feet she spots Laura's blouse on the floor
Teetering she leans over, picks up the blouse, and ties it around her waist
, flying high, makes her way through the crowd to Laura
They spot each other and give each other a hug
You smell nice
Haven't seen you since  was thrown out of One Eyed Jacks
(trying to focus on Laura) What else did we do together
Oh, remember
(tries to dance with Laura) Hey, you know what
It's been a year
She's been dead a year
she's been dead a year
Jacques comes up to them
The party twins
My high school sandwich
Let's put some meat inside
The three of them move around together
She's been dead a year
Who
Teresa
Teresa Banks
Yeah, a whole year
Yeah, she was going to get rich
she was blackmailing somebody
That's right
She called me
She even asked me what your fathers looked like
(jolted) What
She asked about my father
But it wasn't him
she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose
She said he looked just like a boxer
Speaking of sandwiches
think Bobby was arranging something for you
(gets the idea) Speaking of arrangements
(louder) Why don't you two come up to the cabin this week
Leo and  know that Santy Claus is coming to town
Thursday
Ronette, Laura, and Jacques sway with distorted smiles
(as they hug and almost kiss) Okay, Jacques
(turning to kiss Jacques) "The Great Went"
Buck and another  move in on Laura and Ronette
Buck pushes Laura down on the carpet and gets on behind her
His friend does the same to Ronette
The two girls find themselves face to face
Here we go again
Like we're back at One Eyed Jacks
(moaning with pleasure) Oh, god
It sure is
Ronette looks over Laura's shoulder
Shit, is that Donna Hayward
Laura looks across the rug through dancing legs and sees Donna's head tilted way back with some   on top of her
: ' Seeing Donna
' (screaming) ,
Laura stumbles and runs to Donna grabbing Jacques on the way
(continued) (screaming to Jacques) Get her out of here
get her out
He doesn't seem to be listening
(continued) (shouting) Laura falls full of panic to Donna
(continued) Donna, what are you doing
Rips her blouse off her waist
Donna is completely gone
Laura shakes her and screams into her face
(continued) Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff
Never
(mumbling) Okay,  won't wear your stuff
Why can't  wear your stuff
Jacques, help me get her home
Jacques lifts Donna up and Laura follows Jacques and Donna out of Partyland
Donna continues to mumble
won't wear your stuff
(then laughing) promise
(crying, holding Donna's hand) Not you, Donna, not you

'       - Out in the yard of the Hurley House Ed Hurley tries to skin a deer which is hanging off a branch of a tree
He is not having much luck and is not showing much enthusiasm either
Nadine Hurley comes storming out the house with her own very large butcher knife - very upset with Ed's progress
(pushing him away) 'll take over here
Ed backs off and Nadine dives in slicing
You were cutting this deer like a sissy
Sit down and watch while  do it
Ed slowly backs into the house
139
- Ed joins his assistant, , and they stand in the living room gazing out the window at Nadine ferociously skinning the deer
(with a wink) Works every year
They laugh
Sure wouldn't work at my house
My wife couldn't take the wrapper of a twinkie
140
- and   break from a kiss
Smiling, Truman goes back to gently strumming his guitar
Josie,  think we should go public
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died
What are you afraid of
What people think
don't want to offend the customs of your country
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country
For instance,  don't eat fish eyes
Fish eyes
Even if it offended someone,  wouldn't eat a fish eye
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry
saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle
He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat
guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble
His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing
And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy
They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling
Splat
It just stuck up there and spread out
It was about the size of a half dollar
And that's why  don't ever eat fish eyes
He plays the guitar for Josie
Then stops
(continued) 'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way  feel
It's the custom thing  was thinking of
In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides
We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head
understand
We throw away the _whole_ head

142
,   - Donna and Laura sit across from one another on the couch
can't remember anything about last night
Is there something  should remember
No, you should forget about last night
Laura,  am your friend
know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it
You're not mad at me
No
feel so bad
had nightmares all night long
(studies her friend) They all knew you at that place
What can  tell you
How did the car get back here
got it back, that's all
How did  get in the house
How did get into my bed
can't help you there
Was  wearing something of yours and you got mad at me
All my things have me in them
don't want you to be like me
But  love you, Laura
And  love you, too
But don't wear my stuff
Why do you do it, Laura
Cause  like it
She takes Donna's head into her hands and kisses her
Leland is standing at the other end of the room
As he stares at the girls we move in on his face
143
/ Leland looking into another room seeing Laura and Ronette sitting face to face on a bed
144 Leland looking at the girls
Excuse me, honey
Laura turns to him with a start
(continued) We're late to meet Mom for breakfast
(to Laura) Catch you later
Leland and Laura leave
145
'  - Leland and Laura drive along
Leland becomes preoccupied with something in his rear view mirror
Laura turns to see a car erratically coming up behind them
Leland slows down and stops for a red light at Sparkwood and Twenty One
In front of them is a huge logging truck
Laura smells something
Dad, is the engine on fire
Something is burning
Leland turns and gives her a look
The car that was tailing them races around them, races around the logging truck, and comes back around stopping on Leland's side of the car
Leland spots Gerard, the one armed man, behind the wheel - sweating like crazy
(continued) Something is burning
Leland starts to rev his engine while holding the brake with his left foot
It's the engine
You stole the corn
had it canned above the store
Leland is panicked
The car is slowly screeching towards the large lumber truck in front of them
(shouting at Laura) Miss, the look on her face when it was opened
There was a closeness
Like the formica table top
The car is now smoking and making a horrendous sound
Gerard continues to yell, but we can barely hear it
The thread will be torn, Mr
Palmer, the thread will be torn
Leland turns to Laura
Sweat pours from his forehead
While Leland is turned away, Gerard holds up his hand with a ring on the little finger
He is shouting over the engine noise and the horn which Leland has begun to blow frantically
(shouting) It's him
It's your father
Laura can't make this out over the noise
The light turns green
Gerard takes off away from them
As soon as the logging truck moves Leland lets go of the brake and the car flies into a service station on their right
Everyone around there has been watching a commotion on a Sunday afternoon
What was that all about
Who was that
runs up to their car
Mr
, Mr
, you shouldn't do that to your engine
You ought to take it easy, Mr
, you're going to burn your engine out
What the hell was all that
Why doesn't someone do something about all of this
My god, that guy came out of nowhere
He was harassing my daughter
Leland stares at Laura trying to compose himself
Dad, are you all right
146 / The Title "Fleshworld" on a magazine
In the magazine we see Leland find a picture of Teresa Banks
He whispers
Teresa Banks
You look so much like my Laura
Leland dials the phone
147 She is talking on the phone
That sounds like fun
Where did you see my picture
Okay, come to the Blue Diamond City Motel
Yes, that's just your side of Blue Diamond City
'll be there
Room one two three
Right, as in "Get Ready"
On top of Teresa in bed
All whispers
(smiling) When's the next business trip, big fella
Soon
How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about
can arrange that
like that
He kisses her and covers her eyes with a hand
What are you doing
Who am
don't know
That's right
End of flashback
149 Leland is still sitting and staring at Laura
(trying to get his attention) Dad
Dad
Who was that
How do you know him
He looked familiar
Have met him
No, you haven't met him
Have you met him
No
We're late to get to your mother
Just sit here for a moment
You seem very upset
(mumbling to himself) Guy just pulls up out of the blue mean
what is this world coming to
150
- Open on a sign saying Blue Diamond City Motel
Leland comes down an outside walkway towards an open room
Suddenly, he stops short and jumps back
He cautiously takes a second look and sees Laura and Ronette sitting on the edge of a king size bed talking
Leland is about to leave when there is a tap, tap, tap on his back
He spins around to see Teresa Banks who has come up behind him
What's wrong
(moving further from the room) Nothing,  chickened out
He shoves a wad of money into her hand and practically runs away
Teresa cocks her head and wonders, while she watches him hurry away
End of Flashback
151 Leland and Laura are in the car
Leland starts the car
Are you sure you're okay
Yes
Leland pulls out onto the road
After they drive for a bit
Dad
Yes
Did you come home during the day last week
No
Oh,  thought  saw you
You know,  did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday
had a severe headache and  was driving in the neighborhood so  just darted in and out of the house
(studies Laura) Where were you, Laura
didn't see you
was down the street
Laura studies the look in her father's eye as long as she dares and then turns away
: As he drives along
: 152
- Teresa watching with her head cocked as Leland hurries off
: 153 Hey, Teresa
what
' What does Ronette's father look like

heavy set
balding
' What does Laura Palmer's father look like
Very handsome
wavy black hair
He looks like a movie star

Six four
Nose broken
like he was a boxer
Teresa hangs up the phone and redials - smiling as though she has won the lottery
155
' He answers the phone
Hello
' Hey Handsome, this is your little party girl

It is the same ring
161
'   - Then she remembers being in the Blue Diamond City Motel with Ronette when Teresa entered the room
The guy split
Teresa sits down between them and brings them close to her in a sexual embrace
Teresa brushes away some hair that has fallen over her face
As she does this Laura sees the

We hear the gurgling of the Wind River behind her

He wipes some sweat from his forehead

It is the last stuff she has -- she puts the empty packet into her diary

You and  are going to make a big score tonight

Thank you, Bobby
big score
Maybe our biggest
'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00
Don't be late
She takes off down the hall
Rounding another corner she sees James coming towards her
James looks around to see if the coast is clear and seeing it is, moves close to her
've got to see you
Not now
This afternoon
Okay
(remembering) Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today
What about tonight
can't tonight
What's going on

Laura keeps going
Donna comes around next to James
Together they watch Laura walk away

Then discover that Leland is staring at Laura's picture
Wider we see   trying to blow up a large rubber Indian for his son
and   stand nearby supervising
Johnny comes up one inch in front of Leland's face
Happy Birthday, Johnny
Happy Birthday, Johnny
Johnny moves to one inch in front of Jerry's face
Happy Birthday, Johnny
Happy Birthday, Johnny
Ben reacts to a huge moccasin print in the middle of the birthday cake in the middle of his office floor
Why did we have to have the party here in my office
Because Johnny wants it in your office
What's so "private" "private" about your office, anyway
Why can't we have the party in your precious office
It's a lovely place for a party, Ben
And look at the new decorations Johnny's provided
They look down and see Johnny's foot completely ringed in white frosting roses
Frosted footprints trail behind him everywhere
Johnny goes one inch in front of Laura's picture
Happy Birthday, Johnny
Leland looks again at Laura's picture
He looks up at Ben

The French liking wood anymore than anyone else likes wood
Are you three crazy
Sarah's cousin is French and she can't stop talking about the trees around here
History is on our side, Ben
It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette

He digs into his pockets for the pages torn from Laura's secret diary

He goes to the centre of the circle of the twelve sycamore trees
The red curtains appear and he passes between them entering the red Room

Gerard is just leaving the other side of the room

He walks down a corridor and _into_the_Red_Room_again_
There on the other side of the room Leland sees Gerard and the Man From Another Place sitting side by side in a chair facing him
Leland stops when he sees them
He divides
One half becomes Bob - opaque
The other half floats up and becomes Leland - transparent
