Anyone
with jet-black hair turns to a sitting at a desk in the back of the classroom
He is , 19
Like  a moment before, he is staring out the window
Let me get this straight
The girl with the big lips is depressed because, each night, when her father goes off to work at the bakery, her mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the house
Not only does this girl have to listen to her mother working this guy in the next room, she has to wash the sheets each morning before Daddy gets home
After a few weeks of this, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy takes her to confession--only, once she gets in the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and realizes he's the mother's secret lover
Is that it
James Leer says nothing, huddling lower in the he wears
mean, Jesus
What is it with you Catholics
All right
Let's try to keep it constructive, shall we
Howard, what about you
hated it
That's not exactly what  meant by constructive, Howard
think James should try to be more constructive
This is my second semester with him
His stories are brutal, man
They make me want to kill myself
glances at James, but his face remains impassive
Then--with a visible sense of relief-- notices the raised hand of the achingly beautiful
Yes, Hannah
think maybe we're missing the point
It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand
He treats us like adults
He respects us enough to forget us
That takes
courage
nods, smiles subtly
Appreciative
Well put, Hannah
And a good note to end on, think
(as the students rise) Don't forget about WordFest this weekend
And remember: those of you driving
s to tonight's cocktail party need to have them at the Chancellor's house no later than 5:30
Hannah Green gathers her things, pauses by Grady
Thanks for that
He all right
think so
What about you
Me
Sure
Why

She is talking to a  with an armful of

This means we have no programs for the weekend
This means that tomorrow morning, at 9AM, several hundred people will walk into Thaw Hall and have absolutely no idea where they are going
(shaking her head) It's all right, Elliot
'll take care of it
watches Sara take the programs, turn, and spot him
There is the slightest of hesitations, then
Professor Tripp
Chancellor
got the message you called
got the message you called too
This hangs in the air, awkward somehow, then both nod and continue on, without so much as a backward glance

Grinning devilishly, Crabtree whispers something in the woman's ear, then spots Grady
Tripp
How are you, Crabtree
Brimming
Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia
uh
Sloviak
took the liberty of inviting Antonia to tonight's festivities
You don't mind, do you
Trip
(a slight beat) The more the merrier
Terry was telling me about you on the plane
It was ail so interesting
was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published
What you do as a writer, what do as an editor
sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling
(indicating Crabtree) That's exactly what he said
We know each other pretty well
(to Grady) So where's Emily
Emily
Your wife
Oh
We're picking her up
Downtown
Perfect
Well then, shall we
nods, but lingers briefly--studying the architecture of Miss Sloviak's ankles as she  off in her spike heels, arm in arm with Crabtree

-  - and Crabtree watch suitcases tumble as Miss Sloviak sits across the way, inspecting her face in a compact
Do you know how many times 've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me
Particularly while 'm on my way to Pittsburgh
Lay off Pittsburgh
It's one of the great cities
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me
She's a transvestite
You're stoned
She's still a transvestite
Mm
Isn't she
Crabtree ignores Grady's question, smiling placidly as he watches the carousel spin
So how's the book
stiffens
He had been expecting this, but not so soon
He tries to act casual
It's fine
It's done
Basically
'm just sort of
tinkering with it
Great
was hoping  could get a look at it sometime this weekend
Think that might be possible
don't know
'm sort of at a critical
juncture
thought you were tinkering
just mean
Forget  asked
don't want to pressure you, Tripp
But
(pointedly) get pressure
Know what  mean
ponders this, troubled by it
Suddenly, Crabtree's face brightens again
Ah
well now
What do you suppose that would be

That would be a tuba

'  -  -                  8 As the Galaxie emerges from a ,  watches the great city of Pittsburgh reveal itself in the distance, then glances in the rearview mirror
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia
It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it
Why yes
How did you know
Lucky guess
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you
Trip
It was Jerry Nathan's
He owed me money
He owes God money
You know, he queered himself for good with Esquire
takes a joint from the ashtray, snaps a Scripto butane
He said something about being between things
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs

- with a crumpled exits the building and-seeing  parked in front of a fire hydrant--stops, a puzzled expression on her face
As she approaches,  roils down the passenger window
Hi, Tanya
(to the others) This is Tanya
My wife's secretary
and   smile and nod
Tanya smiles and nods back, her eyes passing uneasily over Grady's joint
Grady
Emily's not here
just smiles, nods
(cont'd) Is there anything  can do for you
watches a tiny stream of water trickle through Tanya's sad umbrella
You're leaking, Tanya
Tanya nods--at a loss-then turns away into the rain
Trip
She left me
Crabs
Left you
Who
Emily
This morning
found a note in the kitchen
But
why didn't you say something, Tripp mean, what are we doing here
gazes at the glittering scene beyond his windshield, turns on the ignition
thought maybe  made it all up
10
- Through the windows, a rabble of writers, faculty and select students can be , mingling under a haze of cigarette smoke
brings the Galaxie to a lurching halt across the street, parks in front of another fire hydrant
As the trio steps out
notices a , shimmering quietly in the chill night air
That's a nice greenhouse
It's Mrs
Gaskell's
Her hobby
thought you were Mrs
Gaskell's hobby, Tripp
Piss off, Crabs
lost a wife today
Oh, 'm sure you'll find another
You always do
11
- As the front door swings open, Sara Gaskell appears, riding a wave of jagged party  onto the porch
Well, hello, everyone
Terry, good to see you again
Chancellor
Don't you look ravishing
Aren't you sweet to say so
was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to--oh
As Sara steps forward, her heel-catches and she pitches forward
into Grady's arms
Easy there
'm sorry
It's these goddamned shoes
don't know how anyone actually walks in these things
Practice
Sara looks at Miss Sloviak, a faint glitter of scientific curiosity in her eye
don't believe we've met
Antonia
Antonia Sloviak-- Just then, a -  with very strange skitters around the corner,   in the general direction of Grady
Poe
(mildly) This wouldn't be Walter's dog, would it
Poe continues to rage, his paws doing crazy eights on the hardwood floor, until he's spun himself completely around and is barking at the living room
Who ' s he barking at now
He's still barking at me
He's blind
Poe' Hush
Now stop this
Honestly
As Poe simmers to a deep growl,  leans forward
need to talk to you
That's funny
need to talk to you, too
(strategy in her tone) Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp
(reading her) don't believe  know where the upstairs guest room is
Well then
'd better show you
Terry-- We'll just make ourselves at home
(kneeling by Poe) Won't we, Poe
Yes, yes

In one somewhat-dated  a (a younger Walter Gaskell) stands with at an old-timers game
As Sara eases the door shut,  nods to a 1951 ' hanging over the mantle
New
(nodding) Walter just got it back from the framer today
Sara takes Grady's hand, drawing him away from the pennant and down onto the coat-covered bed
You go first
All right
This morning-- 'm pregnant
flash of  flutters from the living  room below
starts to speak
'm sure
Well
This is
surprising
Does Walter
think Walter would find this a little more than surprising
nods, getting her drift, then roils onto his back
Emily left me this morning
She's left before
She's left the room before
She always came back
Sara nods
Considers this
So
guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right
Simple
Simple
and Sara stare at the ceiling
Sara sniffs the coat lying beneath her
Miss Sloviak's coat
Is that Cristaile
Hm
(weary) My God,  wear the same scent as a transvestite
She  a transvestite, isn't: she
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening
Has he asked to see the book yet
Yes
And
Are you going to tell him
No
Maybe
don't know
don't know what 'm going to do
(distantly) Neither do 1
starts to pull up, but his arm is underneath Sara
Sara, my arm
'm stuck, honey
guess you're going to have to chew it off then
13
- Poe noses blindly through a forest of legs, pauses by Miss Sloviak's high heels and scores a Rye Krisp
Crabtree, returning with a pair of , tiptoes around him, finds chatting with a trim  in his 50's
Walter
see you've met my friend
Yes
She' s charming
(taking her drink) Walter's been telling me the most fascinating things about Marilyn Monroe and
who was it
Joe DiMaggio
Simply put, Antonia, it' s my contention that their marriage tapped into the very id of American popular culture
Joe DiMaggio represented, metaphorically speaking, the Husband as Slugger
And, though it may be controversial,  personally believe every woman, in some way, desires to be Marilyn Monroe
Oh,  couldn't agree more
works his way through the crowd, spies Walter, and changes course
Directly ahead is an oddly commanding ("")
From the behavior of the people in his vicinity it's clear he is someone of interest
Presently, he is putting the make on Hannah Green
And while my latest has been on the New York Times bestseller list for 40 weeks,  can't help but lament that my first book, which contains what  consider my finest writing, was remaindered in less than five
So,  find myself conflicted
Ask him if he's conflicted about his house in the Hamptons
(brightening) Grady
eyes  over his wine glass
Hello
Professor
,
Hannah's had two stories published in The Paris Review
You'd best dust off the '' material for her
As  moves off, he sees Poe sniffing, and goes the other way, heading directly into the crosshairs of a , who is talking to another, shorter
(to short man) supermarket for the mind, my ass
'm telling you, they're nothing but a big, fat mob laundry
Have you ever been to Davenport, Iowa
Let me tell you, they need a 30,000-square-foot bookstore like they need another goddamn cow
(as  passes) Grady
Hello, Nathan
My God,  haven't seen you since, what
The /Faulkner Awards
That was a big night for you, Grady
(to his friend) was there for Arsonist's Daughter, The short man blinks, impulsively takes Grady's hand
Douglas Triddly, Amherst
kid you not when say Arsonist's Daughter belongs in the pantheon of late twentieth century fiction
've had it on my Graduate Studies syllabus three years running
(pulling away) No wonder it's still in print
As  flees, he passes a  holding a cigarette
can take my word for it, writer's are lousy fucks
Poets aren't bad, but then you've got to deal with the sweater thing
They'll discover the cancer in your heart every time, but God forbid they find a decent dry cleaner

- comes out the back: door and ferrets a  from his pocket, lights it
He takes a long draw, walks around the side of the house
As he passes a window, a accosts him
' There you are
starts, but when he looks through the window, he sees that the  belongs to   and the person to whom he's talking is Sara
They are standing in the kitchen, near an elaborate
could swear  had a '63 Chateau Latour in here
You haven't seen it, have you
doubt 'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if was sitting on it
You'd recognize it if you tasted it
doubt it, darling
(angling & bottle to the light) Well,  certainly will
And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour
You want to keep him happy
If he' s happy
(kissing her as he exits) 'm happy
As Walter goes,  studies Sara as she stands alone in the quiet little room, looking small and tired
Finally, she takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off, returning to the clamor inside her house
sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a  of coming from the darkness beyond
is watching him from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskell's garage
blinks, chagrined that he's been caught eavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the porch
James
James Leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class, a hanging off one shoulder
looks at what appears to be a sliver of moonlight in James' palm
It's fake
James' face betrays his own fragile chagrin and peers more closely at what lies in his extended hand
The sliver of moonlight is, in fact, a shiny - It was my mother's
She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school
It's very convincing
It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore
The caps
reaches for the gun, but James closes his fingers and slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat
It's just
for good luck
Some people carry rabbits' feet
You carry firearms
As  exhales a plume of smoke, James' eyes pass briefly over the jay notices, offers
No, thank you
don't like to lose control of my emotions
nods, accustomed to James' weirdness
'm not supposed to be here, in case you were wondering
crashed
mean, not intentionally
James nods toward the house, where Hannah Green can be seen in a window, still fending off the determined
(cont'd) but the other night, Hannah and  were together, at the movies, and she asked me
Since she was coming
So  ended up coming
Too
nods, ponders this over-elaborate explanation
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James
No
What gave you that idea
Relax, James
'm not her father
just rent her a room
She likes old movies like  do, that's ail
(glancing back at the window) Besides, she doesn't really know me
She thinks she does, but she doesn't
Maybe it's because she's Mormon and 'm Catholic
Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way
James looks away from the window, at Grady
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp
You're not like my other students, James
So what was the movie you two saw
Huh
Oh
Son or Fury
With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer
She went crazy, Frances Farmer
So did Gene Tierney
She's in it too
Sounds like a good one
(a crooked smile) It's not bad
considers James' fragile face
Listen, James, about this afternoon
In workshop
'm sorry
think  let things get a bit out of control
They really hated it
think they hated it more than any of the other ones
Well
It doesn't matter
It only took me an hour to write
(truly impressed) Really
That's remarkable
have trouble sleeping
While 'm lying in bed  figure them out
The stories
As James gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse, looks down at the left front  of James' overcoat
Like a nervous tic, James' hand- hidden-twitches against the modest bulk of the cap gun
You cold, James
(distant) little
So what are you doing out here
It's colder in there
- (laughing) You're right
James blinks, startled by Grady's laughter, startled that he's said something funny
He looks back to the greenhouse Actually,  saw the greenhouse
So  thought thought 'd come out here and take a look at it
You don't see one of those every day
It looks like heaven
Heaven
saw a movie once
Part of it took place in heaven
Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses
Like that
At least that's the way  remember it
Abruptly, James glances at his watch
should be going
James turns away, then stops
He stands like this a moment, then turns back
Holds out his right hand
(cont'd) Goodbye, Professor Tripp
hesitates, then shakes James' hand
James moves off then, leaving the light of the house behind
James
(as he stops) Don't leave just yet
There's something think you ought to see
'll miss my bus
This is worth it
James looks conflicted
(cont'd) Trust me
15
- It's quieter now, the party winding down, as  sneaks James past the departing guests and toward the stairs
Hey, you two
stops, sees Hannah slipping on a coat in the foyer
(cont'd) Are you riding with me, James
No, 'm going ho-- He's going with me
You take Crabtree
And his friend
All right
Ail right
By the way, his friend
The answer's yes
think
Yes
don't know
Where are they exactly
Here we are
appears at the top of the landing with Miss Sloviak
Her lipstick is blurry
(spying James) Nell, hello there
steps down the stairs, hand extended
James Leer's pale fingers rise as if on a string
James
This is my editor, Terry Crabtree
James'll know about George Sanders
George Sanders
Mr
was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how
Pills
August 25, 1972
In a Costa Brava hotel room
The few people within earshot glance oddly at James, but Crabtree's eyes glitter with intrigue
How comprehensive of you
Oh, James is amazing
He knows all the movie suicides
Go ahead, James
Tell them who else
There's so many
Just a few then
The big ones
James glances at the loose group of people around him, watching, then
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills
Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again
Charles Butterworth, 1946,  think
In a car
Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know
(a trace of irony) He was distraught
Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965
Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself
He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach
Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again,  forget when
George Reeves, Superman on , shot himself
Jean Seberg/ pills of course, 1979
Everett Sioane-- he was good--pills
Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills
Gig Young
He shot himself and his wife in 1978
There are more but  don't know if you would have heard of them
Ross Alexander
Clara Blandick
Maggie McNamara
Gia Scaia
haven't heard of half of those
You did them alphabetically
James turns, finds Crabtree's laser eyes on him
James blinks, as if he had forgotten about Crabtree, then shrugs shyly, looks away
That's just how my brain works,  guess
Fascinating
Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture
There's a place on the Hill  always get Trip to take me
Actually
just want to go home
Oh, don't be silly
No one your age just wants to go home
Besides, faculty will be present
Just think of it as a field trip
As he exits,  raises an eyebrow to Grady, as if to say: "Bring him
"     follows, eyeing James glacially as we  : The dull  of a   is , a opens, and a triangle of  falls on a  of on their wedding day
16
- and James Leer stand in the doorway
Just below the photograph of Marilyn and Joe--hanging next to a - bearing the number 5--is a trimmed with an
Is that really it
That's really it
The one she wore on her wedding day
So 'm told
James, in the presence of the holy grail of suicide garments, stands speechless
(cont'd) Go ahead
Really
Really
James swallows, then'-goes to the jacket
Carefully, he reaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar, barely making contact, as though it might crumble to dust
They're glass
The buttons
Like the lady herself
says this airily, ironically, riding his buzz a bit, but James nods solemnly, eyes transfixed on the jacket, as if Marilyn herself were inside it
She was small
Most people don't know that
The shoulders are small
(touching the satin) It looks so perfect
bet it's the only time she wore it
That day
She must've felt so happy
studies James as he takes the fringe of the jacket, lifts it lightly
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or
something
It must've cost Dr
Gaskell a lot
guess
Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things
You're really good friends with the Chancellor, aren't you
Grady's eyes slide, paranoid, but James' face remains unchanged, consumed with the jacket
(carefully) Pretty good
'm friends with Dr
Gaskell, too
guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this
Right
downstairs and  and James jump
The of a woman's   sends  to the bedroom window, where he watches Sara slide into a DS23, turn on the ignition, and motor away
We, better skedaddle
Close that closet-- James
You ail right
James is slumped on the Gaskell's white linen bed, knapsack between his knees, head in hands
'm sorry
Professor Tripp
Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her
It just looks
really lonely
Hanging there
In a closet
Maybe 'm just a little sad
Maybe
'm feeling a little sad myself tonight
You mean, with your wife leaving you and ail
(off Grady's look) Hannah mentioned something about it
About a note
Yes
Well
It's complicated, James
think we should go now
Without thinking,  flicks out the bedroom light, leaving James Leer in the dark for the second time today
James just sits there, a shadow in a room of shadows
17 freezes as he enters the hail
few feet away, Poe lies belly to the ground, his blind blue eyes trained, more or less, in Grady's direction
Okay
Easy now
Eee-zy
starts to take a step, when
Poe shoots forward and sinks himself deep into Grady's ankle
Jesus
hops gracelessly, momentarily lifting Poe off the ground as he swings his leg up
Poe, countering, rolls his head in a snapping motion and drops  in a clumsy heap
Get off of me, you son-of-a-bitch
Poe regains his feet, but doesn't let go, whipping his head back and forth, back and forth, over and over, growling low, dark, and hideously from the back of his throat, until there is a sharp
Poe , goes perfectly still, then topples heavily onto Grady's legs turns
James Leer stands in the doorway, posed with the little pearl-handled pistol like Steve McQueen
looks at James
Then Poe
Then back to James
Shit, James
You shoe Dr
Gaskell's dog
had to
Didn't
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me
No
He was crazy
didn't-he looked-- 1 thought -- Okay, okay
Take it easy
Don't freak out on me
roils down his sock
Apparently, Poe went through life with a slight overbite
Do you have a mirror
It's the best way to see if someone's breathing
He's dead, James
Believe me,  know a dead dog when  see one
James looks miserably at Poe
What are we going to do
rises awkwardly, holds out his hand
First you're going to give me that little cap gun of yours
18
- and James stare gloomily out the windshield
Professor Tripp
Can   ask you a question
Yea, James
What are we going to do with
James glances in the backseat, where Poe lies, strange blue eyes gleaming
don't know
'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor  murdered her husband's dog
You
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors
've got tenure
19
--   () As sporadic  wafts from the high windowpanes of Thaw Hall,  leans into the Galaxie's trunk, creates a space between the tuba and a
Okay
James totters forward, arms hooked under Poe's front legs looking like a sorry marathon dancer
frowns, limps forward, and takes the hind legs
He's still a little warm
They lay him down, push him deep into the trunk--until there is a  like a pencil
Yuck
grabs Crabtree's garment bag, frisks the pockets
That's a
big trunk
It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly
(searching) That's just what they used to say in the ads
Come on, Crabtree,  know you're holding
Whose tuba is that anyway
Miss Sloviak's
Can  ask you something about her
She is
Ah
Here we go
unravels a pair of boxer shorts, finds an airplane- size bottle of  , then grabs another pair of boxers
Oh
So
Is--is your friend Crabtree-- is he-- gay
Most of the time he is, James
Some of the time he isn't
Now what do we have here
rattles a prescription bottle, then shakes out a pair of  , each etched with a tiny numeral 3
Looks like
our old friend Mr
Codeine
That should take the pinch out of my ankle
(handing the bottle to James) Have one
No thanks
'm fine without them
Right
That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight
You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle
opens the tiny bottle of Jack with his teeth, drinks down two number 3's, then looks at James
'm sorry, James
'm sorry  said that
Recklessly, James takes a pill, tosses it in his mouth, and tips back the tiny bottle of Jack
Half a second later, he spits it all out
looks down, peels the soggy pill from the lapel of his jacket
How 'bout we try that again
20
- On the stage
Walter Gaskell stands alone at a podium
really needs no introduction
Walk down the aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any hotel and you'll see his face beaming back at you
You all know the name, you all know the books, so welcome if you will, the man those of us who know him simply call
As the audience ,  and James slink into the auditorium
It's standing room only
As they head for an open space against the back wail,  squeezes past a with a
who regards him warily
Good evening
stares, over the gleaming sea of heads before him, watching as  pauses,
for a very long moment
waiting until the auditorium is consumed in a heavy, anticipatory hush
Finally, he speaks again
am a writer
As the audience  with glee,  frowns
He glances to his right, sees James' left brow crinkled with a similar look of bafflement
(cont'd) As a writer, one thing you learn is that everyone you encounter has a story
Every bartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an idea or a
story that would make a "great book" or a "great movie
" Presumably, each of you has an idea
(gestures to the audience) But, how do you go from there to here
How do you go from having an idea to having a book
How do you get across
What is the bridge, the bridge that allows you to walk on air from the shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of accomplishment
Faith
Faith that your story is worth the telling, faith that you have the wherewithal to tell it, faith that the carefully woven structure you create won't collapse beneath you
glances at James, sees that his eyes are unblinking and glazed, then sees, beyond him, Sara standing by the far blink later, she is gone
(cont'd) and faith that when you get to the other side someone will be waiting who gives a damn about the tale you have to tell
leans back, listening to the  of his own , the soft  of the chandeliers hanging by a thread forty feet above his head
Abruptly, James   --some private amusement: bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the auditorium
As  looks and four hundred other heads turn, James ducks down--mortified
Crabtree, sitting a few rows away, studies James with amusement, then winks at Grady
blinks, turns to James
'll be right back

' Grady
Grady
opens his eyes, finds Sara's face swimming above him
He is lying on his back in the corridor, his corduroy blazer bundled under his head like a pillow
You had another one, didn't you
You have to see a doctor, Grady
First thing Monday morning
All right
Is the thing-is it over
Almost
Wane to sit up
(as he winces) What's the matter
Nothing
think  twisted my-- looks at his ankle and feels a rush of guilt
have to tell you something
Something
hard
Sara's face stiffens, becomes more Chancelloresque
Then stand up
'm too old for all this roiling around on the floor
lets her pull him up, watches her light a cigarette
Well
Don't
know what you're going to say
No, really, Sara,  don't think you-- You love Emily
know that
And you need to stay with her
don't think  really have a choice in, that
Emily left me
She'll come back
That's why 'm going to
to not have this baby
watches her flip her hand up, bring the cigarette to her lips, and inhale
then grimace and drop it to the floor
Not have it
No
There's no way
mean, don't you think there's no way
Well, no,  don't see any way
(taking her hand) And  know how hard it is for you to-- to lose this chance
(jerking away) No you don't
And fuck you for saying you do
And fuck you for "saying
(quietly) for saying there's just no way
Because there could be a way, Grady
Somewhere deep in the building,  swells
(composing herself) He must be finishing
We should go
looks sadly at Sara then stoops to retrieve his coat
As he grabs it, James Leer's little pistol to the floor
Who's gun is that
It's-it's a souvenir
Of Baltimore
Before  can close his hand, Sara has it in her own
Heavy
Smells like gunpowder
Caps
She points it-at Grady's chest
He smiles nervously
Pow
You got me
love you, Grady
places his fingers gently over Sara's
and removes the gun from her hand
love you, too
23 The auditorium doors swing open and James Leer emerges, arms draped over  and a
Woah
The doors made so much noise
As they make for the restrooms, Sara and  appear
This is so embarrassing
You guys had to carry me out
Is he ail right
(rolling his eyes) He's fine
He's narrating
We're going to the men's room
Only we might not make it in time
Terry  and James Leer
Leave it to you to make that mistake, wait here
As Sara heads off after James,  turns toward the lobby
directly into the hostile gaze of Miss Sloviak

There's an explanation

Onto the open tray of the glovebox, she places a  of  , a  of , and a cloud of
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing
James is
don't know
Disturbed
And when your friend  gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed
'm not sure that's possible
Sure it is
watches   peel the wig from her forehead
Listen, Antonia-- Tony
Now that 'm home
Tony
'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight
With Terry
Forget it
should've known better
Your friend is just,  don't know, into collecting weird tricks
Mind
Tony angles the rearview mirror toward himself
He's writing his name in water
What's that
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit
He'd call it habit
But now
get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit
Tony peels off a pair of false eyelashes, blinks
You mean because his career's ruined and all
Jesus
Is that what he told you
He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of a
As Tony re-sets the rearview mirror,  gets a glimpse of his own swollen eyes

All we have is a Japanese beetle trap
It's a bathtub

The   conies on and a , - squints through the screen door
There's Pop
(turning) Let me see it
The gun
reaches into his pocket, hands it over
Tony smirks
Figures
It's like the kind of gun Bette Davis would carry
In a little beaded purse
studies the gun in Tony's hand, then glances at the front screen door
Pop is still there
'd better go
think  may have to rescue James Leer
returns the gun,
steps out of the car, and peers in at Grady
You know, Grady, if  were you
'd think about going home
You look like you need a little rescuing yourself

- - parks near a  that has ' stenciled on the side
He watches a  frisk a patron in the   of the Hi-Hat Club's entrance, then slides -James Leer's little  into the glovebox
27A
- - As  steps to the door, the bouncer gives him a perfunctory pat-down
(kidding him) Clean tonight, hub, Professor
As a whistle
28
- Hannah Green is dancing with a sweat-drenched  as enters this -    club
She beckons with a finger, but Grady--Nervous at the sight of her glistening Mormon skin--merely pantomimes an exaggerated shrug and she points
and James Leer sit at a dark corner table
James slouches, eyes half-closed, while  stares in the general vicinity of the dancers, his hand extended beneath the table, in the general vicinity of James' lap
Grady, looking a little alarmed, grabs a passing Double Dickel on the rocks
29 As  arrives,  withdraws his hand delicately and James' eyes flutter open
briefly,
then close
Is that just beer
Primarily
Although  gather you two staged a little raid on the  pharmacopoeia
You missed a few bottles, by the way
'm sure
Where is everyone
Sara and Walter declined
Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog
cuts James a glance, trying to determine if he's copped on Poe, but James is winking out
His head drifts back against the wail, settles with a gentle
thunk
Jesus
He's out
glances over, nods
He has a book
know
He started it Fall semester
He finished it Winter Break
looks up, unable to disguise his surprise
He glances at James' slack face tilted against the wall
So
Is he any good
No
Not yet he isn't
Well, 'm going to read it anyway
Come on
Crabs
Don't do this
He's
one o my students, for Christ sake
'm not even sure if he's- He is
Take my word for it
think it's more complicated than that
Besides, he's a little
scattered
He almost did something stupid tonight
At least, think so
Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now
On the contrary, it 'could be just the ticket
(ducking in) Double Dickel
Thanks
notices the waitress's nametag () and realizes she is conspicuously
He watches her disappear beyond the blur of bodies on the dancefloor, where Hannah Green's slinky form seizes his attention
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor
Shut up and drink
grins, brings his bottle up, then stops
Oh my goodness
Do you see what  see
follows Crabtree's glance and finds Oola again, but it's not Oola is eyeing, it's her
President of the James Brown Hair Club For Men
Sitting alone in the dark booth is a    with big hands, a face peppered with scar tissue, and--most noticeably--a tsunami of hair sprouting from his scalp
(initiating an old game) He's a boxer
flyweight
Huh uh
jockey
His name's, um, Curtis
Curtis Hardapple
Not Curtis
Vernon, then
Vernon Hardapple
The scar's are from a--from a horse
He fell during a race and got trampled
And now he's addicted to painkillers
He can't piss standing up anymore
He lives with his mother
And he had a younger brother who
was
a
Groom
Named Claudell
And his mother blames Vernon for his death
(stumped) Because
because
(sleepily) he was killed, when a gangster named Freddie Nostrils tried to shoot his favorite horse
He took the bullet himself
and Crabtree turn to look at James Leer, who opens one bloodshot eye to regard them
Vernon, over there, was in on the hit
James' eye closes
looks over at Grady
That was good
He heard everything we were saying
Just then, Hannah Green bounces up in her red boots
Come on
Teach
want you to dance with me

-                            30 and Hannah, reflected in bits and pieces in the jack 'o lantern wail of  , slow-dance to a sexy, measured blues
've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter
It's so beautiful, Grady
So natural
It's like ail your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down
thank you
And  love the inscription you wrote to me
Only 'm not quite the downy innocent you think am
hope that isn't true
We need all the downy innocents we can get
spies the corner table, watches  say something to  and then, casually, stroke a lock of hair from James Leer's forehead
So what are you going to do
Do
just mean, -- guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home
looks down into Hannah's translucent face, then catches a glimpse of himself in the fractured, wail
The tile that would reflect his head is missing
Are you holding me up or am  dragging you down
Hannah snuggles closer, lays her head on Grady's chest
Shush
31
- -  (2 ) Grady, limping on his bad ankle, carries James to Hannah's rumpled , props him against the fender
Look, Hannah
When you get him home
make sure he's ail right
Before you leave
Okay
would if  knew where  was taking him
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives
Some apartment somewhere
But 've never seen it
That strikes me as odd
James is odd
know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights
dropped him there once, but
(remembering) Come to think of it, it-wasn't even his Aunt's house
He said she worked there
Or something
don't remember
James , starts to slide onto the hood of the car
Mmhmmm
knap
sap
What's he saying
His bag
You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around
He must've left it inside
Hh-uh
Last time  saw it was
glances at the idling Galaxie across the street
and  huddle inside
Shit
He must've left it back at Thaw
In the auditorium
(delirious, but insistent) Mmrrmmm
frowns in annoyance, opens the passenger door
(cont'd) All right
Take him to my place
He can crash on the sofa
The one in your office
It's the best one
for naps
don't think it really matters, Hannah
We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point
As  lowers James into the seat, he , curls into a bail
Hannah turns her puppy dog eyes on Grady
Ail right
In my office
As  starts to turn away, Hannah's fingers graze his face
Hey
If you want to talk later
'll be up
watches her fold her lovely self into the car and drive away
He sighs, crosses to the Galaxie, and just has his hand on the doorhandle when a   appears
Vernon Hardapple
You driving this car
Excuse me
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500
You driving this car
It's mine
Bullshit
It's mine, motherfucker
You must be mistaken
Bullshit
shakes his head wearily, opens the door
Go home to your mother, Vernon
32 slides in next to , puts the car in gear, and starts to pull away
As he glances in the rearview, he sees smiling darkly in the backseat
All right, what's the matter
just keeps smiling
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do
The kid's practically in a coma
Tripp
Yes
Hit your brakes
flicks his eyes from the rearview mirror just as a looms in his headlights
As he squashes the break pedal, 's  go flying into the windshield
(squinting) Oh my God
What is that
It's Vernon, waving his arms, his shadow enormous in the beams of light
What's this guy's problem
Just go around him
taps the accelerator, but each time, Vernon dances back in front of Grady's grille
Shit
Back up
Go out the other way
throws the car in reverse, backs straight up, then turns up a one-way street
He shoots down the alley behind the Hi-Hat, turns onto the adjoining street,
and watches in amazement as Vernon materializes from behind the high wooden fence that runs parallel to the Galaxie
As  pinches the brakes, Vernon grins
Now what
(mischievously) You could always go over him
Then, as the three men watch, Vernon rocks back on his heels and--with a gymnast's precision-pitches himself onto the Galaxie's big hood
He -lands on his ass, slides smoothly off, then takes a deep bow and disappears into the night
What just happened
peers at the wrinkled asterisk on his hood
just had my car jumped on
33
-  (  ) Grady stops the car in the red zone and gets out
Wait here
'll be right back
Where would we go
34 The , the same shaggy-haired kid  saw rigging the WordFest banner earlier, is struggling with a balky as  steps up to the double doors and slaps his hand against the glass
It's open
pushes on the door and it opens
(cont'd) Hey, Professor Tripp
(off Grady's look) Traxler
Sam
took your class freshman year
Then  dropped out of school
hope it wasn't my fault
(taking him seriously) No
guess you're here for the backpack
Oh
yeah
35 The knapsack is sitting on one of the metal folding chairs as Sam and GRADYenter the silent hail
saw the manuscript inside
So when you showed up,  figured
lifts the knapsack, peers inside
There is no title page to the , Just the words The Love Parade and then, halfway down,
Is it good

It might be

stops
Crabtree
The car
Gone

'  - Traxler gives  a ride in his Honda, one of the original Hondas best suited for sidewalk driving
The backseat bulges with a huge  and
Say, Professor Tripp, is ail that stuff true about Errol Flynn
How he used to put coke on his dick
To make himself, you know, like, last longer
Christ, Traxler
How the hell should  know
Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you
Sam points and  glances at the knapsack riding on the seat between him and Sam
'-bearing  ' -- tucked into the side pouch
Oh, right
Yeah, that's true
He used to rub ail kinds of things on it
Paprika
Ground lamb
Sick

'  -  ( ) Sam brings the car to a coughing idle across the street from the Gaskell's house
Wow, check out that greenhouse
Is that your wife

vaporous blur in the greenhouse
No, my wife's out of town
Just then, the Honda
loom, then a   sweeps into the Gaskell's driveway
Walter appears on the front steps
(cont'd) Who's that guy
Her husband
Traxler looks anxiously at the police car
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp
(staring at Sara) Taking the long way home
39A
'  -  - As Traxler drives away,  mounts the porch with James Leer's knapsack hanging from one shoulder
He reaches above the door, feeling for a key, but his fingers come away with only dust
He stands, dispirited, then an idea strikes
He takes the doorknob, turns it
It opens
40
- ' enters, closes the door quietly behind him
41 The room is dim but the  is on, throwing crazy slashes of light onto the wails and ceiling
As  limps by, he finds a sleeping Hannah Green, bundled in a blanket, - shirt, and little else
On the floor, near her dangling hand, Woolf's  Common Reader lays open next to a Diet Coke
considers the smooth geography of her body, but his eyes 'are most powerfully drawn to
her feet
He steps forward, lifts the blanket gently, but finds-to his disappointment--only the red cowboy boots
He picks up the remote, turns off the , and exits
42
' James Leer slumbers on a green sofa, draped in an old sleeping bag
drops behind his desk, lets James' knapsack slide to the floor
He lifts his cuff, inspects his ugly ankle, then glimpses something in the knapsack
Something yellow
Something soft

glances at the young man on his sofa, then, looking very tired, reaches for the desk lamp
and turns out the light on the both of them

-   ( ) steps outside in a '   and plucks the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette from the second porch step
He fishes out a charred , starts to light it, then notices the Galaxie sitting in the driveway

44A
- eases the door shut, starts to turn, then stops, his eyes drawn to the door just across the landing from Crabtree's room
44B
' pushes open the door with the tips of his fingers, lets it glide open
The room that is revealed is bright and well-ordered, in direct contrast to the lazy clutter of Grady's office
There is a   and a , pads and pens neatly arranged alongside
hangs on one wall, bearing an intricate mosaic of multi-colored index cards
There are , framed, from various art exhibits, and two of Grady's --including, most prominently, Arsonist's Daughter
There are  of  too
In a black turtleneck with friends
In a sundress with Grady
In a billowing Burberry, floating like a dark butterfly against a  of on a street in Manhattan

Stops
James awakes with his back to the floor, James leer's quizzical face floating like a cloud above him
'm okay
just lost my balance
put you on the floor
Oh
thought you might--l don't know-- swallow your tongue or something
(nodding to Grady's robe) guess you really miss her, huh
peers down at the geraniums blooming on the pockets of the robe, its overall fuzziness
Huh
Oh, no
This isn't Emily's
just write in it
guess there's probably a story behind that
There is, but it's not that interesting
James nods
Down the hallway, in another room, the Want me to get that
Sure
As James shuffles away in the sleeping bag,  rises delicately and turns toward the window,
just in time to see a   roil slowly by on the screen below
(returning) He didn't give his name
Who
The guy on the phone
What'd he say
He wanted to know if a  Trip
lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior
What'd you tell him
Yes
Good, James
If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right
thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something
Is that single-spaced
James has noticed the towering stack of 20 Ib
bond on Grady's desk
Afraid so
That's a big book you're writing
think it's sort of writing itself at this point
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but-- But
Nothing, it's just that,, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people--some of the kids in workshop--thought maybe you were
Washed up
Blocked
Ah
don't believe in writer's block
James takes another glance at the mammoth manuscript
No kidding
is
and James turn, watch Crabtree, wearing only a pair of striped boxers, materialize in the hallway
Good morning, boys
James
James waves feebly from beneath the sleeping bag
(re: James' "attire") If-you 're planning on staying for breakfast, 'd put on something a little less comfortable if  were you
As  moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the page curling from the typewriter, James continues to stare into the emptiness of the hallway
The sight of seems to have made him suddenly queasy
Professor Tripp
Hm
How did  get here last night
No one seems to know where you live, James
Hannah thought you'd like my couch
And
and before that
Did  do anything
Anything bad
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia
As James contemplates this, the looks up, sees the   he noticed earlier, now parked at the bottom of his driveway
Do yourself a favor, James
Hide
46 not much older than James Leer waits
As the door opens, appears
Good morning
(eyeing Grady's robe) Professor Tripp
Sorry to bother you, sir, but understand you attended an event at Sara and Walter Gaskell's house last night and were one of the last to leave
47

) was just wondering if maybe you saw anyone
Someone you didn't know
Who seemed out of place
Suspicious maybe
48 is  scratching his head in mock thought
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but  can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious
Wait
There was one guy
Tiny fella
Claimed to be a jockey
jockey
You mean, like-- Horses, right
Vernon something
(thinking
) Hardpple Pupcik stops on his pad, looks up
Hardapple
could be wrong
What happened anyway
Huh
Oh, someone pulled a & on Dr
Gaskell's closet
And the dog's missing
That's weird
We figure the perpetrator let him out
He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over
The perpetrator
No, the dog
Just kidding
Pupcik nods slowly, as if re-filing  under "Dealing With Assholes
" One other thing
About this kid, this student of yours- Leer--James Leer
You wouldn't know how  could get in touch with him, would you
might have his number on campus
That's all right
We'll find him
Pete Pupcik smiles, tips his big blue police hat, and turns away
frowns, starts to close the door

) There you are

Last night
Oh
Well
Hannah stretches and the t-shirt slides dangerously up her thighs
It's okay
'm here when you want me

He watches Pete Pupcik drive away in his big police car
What do we do now
#####Before  can reply,
the  sitting on the table next to him #####
Hello
' Grady, it's Sara
Thank God you're there
You won't believe what's happened
Could you hold on a minute, honey
With a look of wonderment,  watches his hand ever- so- gently
hang up the phone
How 'bout we get the hell out of here

'  -  ( ) James, now wearing one of Grady's flannel shirts beneath his ratty overcoat, follows Grady-to the Galaxie, knapsack swinging from his shoulder
tosses him a ring of You start her up
As  runs a plastic  over the  of ice blanketing the windshield, James stares curiously at the keys, as if they were some strange artifact, then slides behind the steering wheel
(as the engine roars) How's that
Well done, James
As  works, James' face comes into view, then

Where exactly do you live, James
James, in the midst of chugging from a 64-  of , stops
Apparently not even Hannah Green has a clue as to the location of your apartment
tosses the tin of band-aids into a small plastic hand basket, begins to move down the aisle
got kicked out
Well, not exactly kicked out
was asked to leave
guess there's probably a story behind that
There is, but it's not that interesting
So where have you been staying
(a long pause) The bus station
stares incredulously at James
It's not -so bad

And there's a broken locker  can put my stuff
(trying to fathom this) But James

How long

That's why
that's why  had the gun
For protection

Nice

It's about half-down
You better ease off that stuff, James
It's pretty acidic
James takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat, studies it curiously
can't help myself
don't know what's the matter with me
Shit, James, you're hungover
What do you think's the matter with you
As  turns away, James ponders this, then considers the ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re-sets the donut in precisely the same place

Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom

That was fast

Hello
Oh
Right
Ha
Listen, about last night
There is something  need to tell
Are you limping
Why are you limping

Well, actually, yes
Sort of don't remember

But this is not just about me anymore

know what's at stake here
No,  don't think you do
And besides haven't decided yet
About the baby
That
and you
goes still, watches Sara strip off the gloves, drop them on  a table
'm not going to draw the map for you on this one, Grady
Times like these you have to do your own navigating
Sara turns to leave, then stops, squinting far down the street
Who's that sitting in your car
James Leer
What's he doing out there
'm sort of helping him work through some issues
Sara raises an eyebrow, then pushes through the door
Isn't he lucky
watches her ripple across the glass, head for the house, and wave
James, slumped low in the Galaxie, offers a limp hand in return, but it's too late
She's already gone
54
-  -  54 cradles the wheel in his bandaged paw, while James sits stiffly, the orange juice jug bobbing between his thighs
She seemed to take it pretty well
Yeah, well, actually
James looks over
(cont'd) The moment didn't really present itself
James nods, unsurprised, then turns back to the window, staring at the landscape, still sitting oddly still glances at him
At the orange juice jug
(cont'd) You' re not planning on puking in my car, are you, James
Nothing
Don't be proud, James
We're in Sewickley Heights
We could find you a nice golf course to barf on
(sharply) No
looks over, surprised by the James' tone
James blinks, looks embarrassed
(cont'd) mean
'm fine
'm sorry
just
James peers out the window at passing landscape
(cont'd) 've got a thing about,
places like this know what those houses are like
know what the people are like
Your aunt
James turns, eyes flashing with surprise
(cont'd) Hannah mentioned something about an aunt
James nods vaguely, then reaches into the ashtray, takes a  between his fingers, sniffs it
Humboldt County
(surprised) Maybe
It's my father
He gets it from his doctor
Glaucoma
Colon cancer
Jesus, James
Wow
James puts the joint back in the ashtray
' It's a bit of a scandal
My parents live in a small town
Where's that
Carvel
Carvel
Where's Carvel
Outside Scranton
never heard of it
It's a hellhole
Three motels and a mannequin factory
My dad worked there for thirty-five years
Your father worked in a mannequin factory
Seitz Plastics
That's where he met my morn
She was a fry cook in the cafeteria
Before that, she'd been a dancer
What kind of dancer
Whatever kind they wanted her to be
(in disbelief) James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper
'm telling you what  was told by my uncle
And he should know
He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school
When we fall, we fall hard
Amazing
takes the joint from the ashtray, lights it, then notices-with surprise--James has his hand out
(cont'd) thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions
Maybe  just needed the moment to present itself

James still has the -now only a tiny nub-pinched between his fingers
This is so nice
It's like where Andy Hardy would live
What's it called again
Kinship
Kinship
And what's here
Unless  miss my bet
my wife
James' heavy eyelids flutter with surprise
The one that left you
That's right
That one
56
- on the front door, then cups his hands against the glass of the living room window, squints inside
Nothing
As he turns away,  sees James sitting on the hood of the Galaxie with the box of powdered donuts
He's sitting in the indentation
Someone jumped on your car with their butt
- How can you tell
You can see the outline of a butt
As  nods, James holds out the donut box
(cont'd) Want one
They're incredible
Incredible
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box
58
-   ( ) As  steps onto the back porch, James follows
Maybe she didn't come here
She came here
We'll just wait
In the meantime,  need you to shimmy through
James stares at the "Doggy Door" cut into the back porch door
Relax
Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old
And your hips are as slim as hers
It's not that
It just reminded me of-- you know-of what's in the car
In the trunk
(a pang of guilt himself) Oh
Right
Well, let's try not to think about that
James takes another sad glance at the little door, then drops onto ail fours
59
-   - leads James through the house
Everything about it speaks of family
Even the furniture seems arranged so that people will gather together, light a fire, talk
It feels really
good
here

It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning
(moving off) Make yourself at home
'll be right back

60 Grady, laboring badly on his ankle", enters and finds a open on the floor, its contents a tangle of quickly-packed clothes
Everything else in the room feels of another time
are everywhere, documenting a ' life, from first recital to cap and gown
One photograph lies face down
turns it over and finds the pretty girl grown into a beautiful young woman, standing in a white gown next to a younger Grady--on their wedding day
61 James enters,   in hand, and sees a atop the
Taking it, he points it at the - imbedded in the opposite wall and, seconds later,   walks into his -
There's no such thing as a good influence, Mr
Gray
All influence is immoral

She should be in the main hall Thank you

Sara
Hi
It's Grady
' Where are you, Grady
An elevator
'm in Kinship
Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about
' (evenly) You're in Kinship
Yes
But that's not why  called

Good Morning

For Christ sake, will you turn that thing down
' James
He's still with you
65 James, in the midst of pouring himself a tumbler of Bushmills, smiles as   and   sing their hearts out in Babes In Arms
/ We talked the whole night through
66 shakes his head, carries the phone toward the bedroom
Look, Sara
'm not here
'm not here to As  watches, a late-model  BONNEVIlLE turns into the driveway below him

' Are you there to not reconcile with her
The Bonneville's trunk pops open, revealing , and  and  , both in their 60's, get out
An enormous  vaults from the backseat
Sara, eating phone static this whole time, interprets Grady's silence her own way
'  (cont'd) Goodbye, Grady
No
Sara, you don't understand
' Trust me,  understand
just want to say something to you, Grady
(dreading it) Yea
' How you choose to live your own life is your business
But you be careful with that boy, Grady
With James
He belongs to somebody else
As the line goes dead,  watches Hank and Irene Winters disappear below him
69
69 James--Irish whiskey in one hand, the pride of Humboldt County in the other--watches with deep absorption as Judy and Mickey have a heartfelt conversation
Then, sensing something
he turns
Hank and Irene Winters, grocery bags in arm, stand frozen
Hullo
are  on the staircase and  hobbies into view
He tries a smile
Mom
Dad
70
-   - (  ) Hank Winters emerges from the bathroom with a roll of tape, a bottle of alcohol, and some cotton wool
Well, it's infected,  can tell you that
'm just going to clean it up a bit
It's up to you to-find someone who knows what they're doing
Here
Put your foot up
puts his foot up on Hank's lazy-Boy, then notices a lying face down on the seat
The  on the back cover looks as if he's trying very hard to look consequential
To his surprise,  realizes the author is himself
So he's one of your students, this boy
glances into the living room, where James and Irene sit on a long couch together, sipping something hot
James is looking out the window, a curious expression on his face
looks out his own window, sees the Newfoundland sniffing curiously at-the Galaxie's trunk
When he glances back into the living room, he and James make brief eye contact, then blink, look away
Yes
He's a good kid
Maybe a little messed up
Well, 'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine
tries to read Hank's face---is he messing with him
--but Hank gives nothing away
nods to the book
What made you pull out that old thing
(shrugging) was thinking of you
And
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but  guess you know that
It's a young man's book
It got me remembering how it felt to be young
Maybe  should read it
Oh,  don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady
doesn't have to read Hank's face this time
Where's Emily, Hank
'don't know if she'd want me  to tell you that, Grady
'm not going to stalk her
Hank
just
want to know where  stand
Hank looks up, incredulous
Where you stand
(embarrassed) l-just want to say 'm sorry
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby
The neurologist
Neurologist
Why
What's wrong
(frowning) Nothing's wrong
They went to Wellesley together
(sheepishly) Oh
Right
Linda
haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately
My editor's in town and have the book to finish and-- Ah, right
The book
starts to continue, then stops, cowed by something in Hank's tone, something dismissive
Instead, he looks away, toward the living room, and catches sight of James again, sitting alone now with his big cup of cocoa
Listen, Hank, 'm sorry about ail this didn't come here to upset you and Irene
want you to know that
Why did you come here, Grady
gestures vaguely
-just wanted to see her,  guess-- Emily
And to see you too-you and Irene
And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this-everything that's happening-it's not forever
It doesn't mean "Goodbye
" Give me a break, Grady
Hank snaps off the tape, slaps Grady's ankle
You're done

-  -    71 glowers darkly at the road, then puts his hand up against the   which, apparently, is not putting out any heat
'm having a really good time, Professor Tripp
glances over, sees James burrowing into the Ziploc
'm really happy for you, James
But do me a favor, will you
Lay off my dope
That stuff's not for amateurs
James looks at Ziploc as  fiddles with the heat just wanted a little sip
(squinting at him) just wanted a little sip
Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy
Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night
stops with the heater, glances over at James, whose face bears not the slightest trace of irony
Jesus
(thinking, then
) Look, James, you appear to possess-like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way-a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made
However,  'think it's best if, for the moment at least (taking the Ziploc) we abstain
You're mad at me, aren't you
What
You're mad because  shot your girlfriend's dog
It wasn't her dog
It's her husband's-- (stopping) Who said anything about girlfriend
James eyes shift slowly, as if to 'say: Who are you kidding
Okay, James,  wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog
Even though Poe and  weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest
Still, the fact remains that 'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom
'm the one who has to take the blame
- don't know what the hell  was thinking
Sure you do
You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat
' You were thinking ' can't let that kid get on
the bus alone-he might never get on the bus again
' You were thinking: ''ve got to find a way to distract this kid
' So you did
It was--in its way--a noble act
Thanks for the halo, James, but 've
never done that much thinking ahead in my" life-ever
James looks -out the window, pondering this
So, why did you take me up there
(feeling for the heat again) -don' t know, James
don' t know why  do half the things  do
Who does
(looking over) Why do you wear that coat
James looks down, a little defensive
It's warm
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat
James just blinks, no ready answer-available
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop
Because of my coat
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time
Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you
(smirking) Jealous
Of me
Not you
Your talent
James' face hardens
He looks away
You're lying
The hell  am
Yes you are
My stuff stinks
know it
You said so yourself
never said that
Yes you did
Last night
To your friend Crabtree
"Is he any good
" he said
And you said: "Not yet he isn't
"  heard you myself
didn't mean it that way
It's okay, Professor Tripp
Carrie, Howard, the others--they 're right
My stories are annoying
They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and-- Shut up, James
You're annoying
Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay
The entire class combined- including the lovely Hannah Green-has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay
James stares blankly at Grady, then turns his face to the window
He ponders Grady's words, the praise inherent in them
hint of pleasure glints in his eyes
But, last night
Who cares what-
said last night, James was drunk,  was stoned
'd been bitten by a dog
My wife had left me
How 'bout cutting me some slack
(quietly) 'm sorry
And don't be so goddamn sensitive
Who cares what anybody thinks anyway
You want to
be a good writer
You want to be-a great writer
Then stop giving a damn what other people think
Most of them haven't thought in
years
James turns, studies Grady's face as it flickers in the first headlights of the evening
Let me spell it
out for you, James
Books don't mean anything
Not to anybody
Not anymore
Arsonist's Daughter meant something
smiles contemptuously
mean it
It means something to me
It's one of the reasons  came to school here
To be in your class
To be taught by you
(quietly) It's one of the reasons  wanted to become a writer
stares ahead, watching the darkness tumble away before the wide sweep of the Galaxie's headlights
Well, for that, if nothing else, James, 'm sorry
72
/ -    - rolls into a space near the coffee shop and James slides out stays put, hands still on the wheel
You coming
In a minute
Get us a table
James nods, pushes past the glass doors into the coffee shop, and a big  in a waitress cap leads him to a table with a view of the highway watches James-- stick figure in black brogues--slide into the booth and open his big, laminated menu
Finally, as if concluding some internal debate, kicks open his door, steps out

You have no listing
Okay, well, lady-- at this very moment, as we speak, 'm looking of a resident of Carvel, Pennsylvania
think he'd be pretty interested to learn that the good people of Bell Atlantic have misplaced his entire hometown
It's not like 'm making this up as  go along-- stops, his own words ringing in his head
(cont'd) Never mind
My mistake

Want a bite
No thanks
That's why you're having them
Your spells
Spells
Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play
don't have spells
What would you call them then
don't know
'Episodes
' James shrugs, spears a fluffy chunk of pie
It's because you don't eat

When
When nobody's looking
watches a pair of headlights approach
(mouth full, garbled) just worry about you, that's all
then pass
James' words finally register
looks at him
You just worry about yourself, James
Okay
Okay
Just then, a long, pale  of  splinters against the coffee shop windows and a  sweeps into the parking lot
follows it with his eyes, rises
(cont'd) Where you going
Nowhere
You just sit here and

Hardly
We were on our way to a benefit
But, as luck would have it, the club was on the way, so
(snapping shut the visor) We were able to put in an appearance
Otherwise we would've been here earlier
Ah
Well, that's ail right
James and  'had a little dinner
Well, certainly we'll reimburse you
That's not necessary
just felt
it might be good for James to be with his family this weekend
Well, of course, we can understand that

They seem to be waiting
Just waiting
Well
Let me go get him

did you ever attend Catholic school
Amanda Leer's eyes narrow ever-so-slightly
Excuse me

'm not going with them
James
Listen
Things-things are a little weird with me right now and -- well-- have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you
And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me
That's why  need you to go home
Understand
'm not going, with them
James, like it or not, they're your parents
Parents
They're not my parents
They're my grandparents

the basement of my own house
It's mine
My parents left it to me
glances toward the parking lot, studies the contours of Fred Leer's face
Frowns
James, come on
That man is obviously your father
You look just like him
James looks down at the table, takes a deep breath, and speaks in a voice heavy with implication
There's a reason for that
Grady's addled brain grapples with this dark little riddle, finally deciphers what James is suggesting
Get out of here
That's why she hates me
That's why she makes me sleep in the basement
In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado
Come on
Up
As  lifts him from the booth, James attempts a plaintive tone, but his heart's not in it

Thank you
Professor Tripp

We'll take care of him
You can be sure of that

No, it's okay
just can't believe  left it out in the open like that

Poking around
don't know--maybe-  don't think so
Grady's  mind races with unfortunate possibilities, but only briefly: his immediate thoughts are elsewhere
Listen, Hannah
You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you
James' aunt
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he
The blind one
Actually, He's not the Chancellor' s--What
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr
Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet - Jesus
said it sounded like something James would be messed up in
Crabtree
He doesn't even know James
Who does
Just then, Crabtree's  bellows in the hallway outside

Where are you' looks anxiously toward the door
The aunt, Hannah
Where did you take James that day

But where
need the street

) Trip
Shit
As  starts to turn away, Hannah hooks her finger inside his belt buckle
No
Don't go
've been waiting ail night for you

He looks terrified
Listen, Hannah, 'm flattered, really, but right now -- (bursting in) Tripp, where the hell
stops, takes in the tableau before him
(cont'd) Oh, 'm sorry
Am  interrupting a
student- teacher conference
delicately removes Hannah's hand from his buckle, points at Crabtree
You stay there
What
Ohhhh
Is that
it
cocks his head toward the reams of paper stacked on Grady's desk
Honestly, Tripp
Do you actually think  would sneak in here and read your book without asking you
Gee,  don't know
Crabs
don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room
Sometimes we have to improvise
(ignoring him) Think, Hannah
Does James have any friends mean, besides you and
me
James
My James
What's happened
Nothing, he's just been sort of,  don't know
kidnapped
Kidnapped
By who
His parents
Good God
Let's go rescue him
Good idea
Crabs
Only one problem
don't know where they live
Ah
Wait a minute
The university must know where he lives
It's a little late to call Admissions
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor
Maybe

You know--based on what 've read-- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade
Love
It's Love facade--and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'
You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines
've been doing this a long time, Tripp feel this kid in my bones
Only in your bones
smirks, glances at Crabtree, but gets a surprise; offers no snappy come-back, no antic wordplay
He just stares out the window, his voice distant
No
think  might be right
've felt it before
As Crabtree's voice trails off,  studies him
How bad is it for you
Bad enough
And God knows  don't exactly fit the new corporate profile
Which is
Competence
and  look at each other a moment, then smiles, gives a little shrug, and picks up James' knapsack, rummaging through the contents

Plenty, 'm sure

Yes
'His heart

reads on: 'His heart, once capable of inspiring others so completely, could no longer inspire so much as itself
It beat now only out of habit
It beat now only because it could

'm ready
James stops, sees the two men looking at him
You all right, Professor Tripp
He's great
Come on, let's blow before ol' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast
Oh, well, that's just it
She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me
If 'm not here, she might
call the police or
something
Hhhuh
So we decoy her
Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference
(brightening) Yeah
Like in Against All Flags
Only they use a couple big hams
No
and James turn

Nothing
The door closes, the  , and  is left alone, the bossa nova floating softly in the air

' Hannah Green lies tangled in the sheets, surrounded by little colonies of Grady's manuscript

The red boots
Delicately, he lifts the sheet

Sorry

Don't sweat it
Well
'Night, Jeff
Oh, Professor Tripp
You know, last semester, what  said that time in office hours- hope there's no hard feelings
No
mean,  was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and-- well-- was pretty bent in general
It's cool, Jeff
Really
just want you to know that's why  dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo-Faulknerian nobody

) Hello
Hello

It is Walter Gaskell's voice
Walter

It's Grady, Walter

That's not right, is it
' It's three-thirty, Grady
This is important
' Oh
' What is it, Grady

' Excuse me
Sara

Silence
Then Walter's  returns: even, administrative
' Are you drinking
Professor Tripp
Right now
sips on his roach, responds in a pinched voice
No
' Nevertheless, 'd like to see you in my office Monday morning
As the line goes dead,  stares at the phone, wondering if he has, in fact, just done what he thinks he's just done

Just then, the   of an  is

Sara
97
- ' steps onto the porch, unintentionally punting a of Iron City Beer onto the front lawn
Sara
tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong
Sara leans down, replaces the uncradled phone
(cont'd) with your phone
Unfortunately, mine was ringing loud and clear this morning
doesn't know what this means, but he's pretty sure it's not good
Oh
It seems one of our students is - missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed
(slumping to the porch) 'm sorry, Sara
've been trying to tell you
It's all my- Sara raises her hand, silencing him
'm not very happy with you right now, Grady
But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved
They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this
You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady
Inside
And the jacket
Over there
In the backseat of the
Grady's hand hangs in mid-air, gesturing pointlessly to the driveway, where the only thing that exists is an oil stain roughly the shape of North Dakota
(cont'd) Someone stole my car
Grady
Honestly
Someone stole my car
parked it right there last night
Are you sure you parked it there
Of course, 'm sure
Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back
Sara turns, sees Officer Pupcik cruising to the curb
'll deal with this
You dig up James

'  - sits in bed, flipping through the pages of The Love Parade while stroking a tiny  of  that is the sole visible part of
James Leer
(swinging in) Is he awake
'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid
Nevertheless
There's a police officer standing on the porch and  don't think he's going away
(from under the covers) That same guy
peels back the blankets and James Leer opens one eye
You snore
So  hear
(studying Grady) No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy
He's right, you look horrible
Thank you, Frankie and Annette
James swings his pale little legs to the floor and walks bare assed across the room to retrieve his BVDs
It's the Chancellor
Ah, right
Well,  gave you my opinion
And we both thank you for that, but we're
we're
fine
'm fine, right
Fit as a fucking fiddle
squints at James as he pulls on his pants
Shut up, James
So what's the problem
(a tad tense) There is no problem
Did  say there was a problem
As James' head pops through Grady's fully-buttoned flannel, he and exchange a knowing glance, at once referring to and excluding Grady
(0
) How's it coming back there, Professor Tripp
Who's that
Who do you think it is
The Chancellor's here
Now
Evidently
(calling) Coming
Does she mean--does she know about
her dog
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does
Know
But let's spare her the details
Come on, your shoes are in the hail
James
This book of yours
It's not bad
Not bad at all
James stops, considers this piece of news with a look of deep seriousness, then nods
Thank you
You're welcome
As James shuffles off into the hail,  looks at Grady, his eyes dancing with excitement
want to publish this
've got to
think they'll let me
With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant
Great
Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet
It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail
99
'  - Sara and  stand by as Pete Pupcik deposits James in the back of the squad car,  the door
As  told the Chancellor, Professor, 'm
just going to run James here over to the university
It'll be up to Dr
Gaskell where we go from there
nods, leans in the window to James
Don't worry, James, 'll figure something out
'm not worried
You're not worried, are you
Professor Tripp
'm a little worried, James
Don't be
don't care if they expel me probably should be expelled
Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening
James nods and  starts to step back from the car
Professor Tripp
Yes, James
Even if  end up going to jail
James smiles his crooked grin
(cont'd) You're still the best teacher  ever had
On this,  Pete Pupcik pulls away, leaving  standing on the curb, watching the back of James' head, framed in the rear  window of the police car, growing smaller
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady
Would Walter really press charges
It's within the realm
He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously
And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning
Grady, detecting something in Sara's tone, turns, watches her take a drag on her cigarette
(cont'd) You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady
think  might have
And what do you think you might have said
think  might've said  was in love with you
Sara's face remains
unchanged
(cont'd) He told you
He told me
And what did you say
said it didn't sound like you
Sara tosses her cigarette in
the gutter, gets into her car, and dives away
looks after her sadly, then turns, sees  standing on the porch wearing a shirt which claims "Ativan Chases the Clouds Away
" So- what do we do now
, Find the jacket
Oh' huh
Exactly how do we do that
First  see if Hannah will let me borrow her car
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas
100
'    - 100 Hannah, wrapped loosely in cotton sheets,  as she listens to the Goatee Kid, who sits cross-legged at the foot of-her bed, fully clothed
'm telling you, the tango is ail about latent homosexual love
Look at the way they dance-- it's sodomy
(laughing) Stop it
Hannah looks up, sees  in the doorway and blushes
She pulls the sheet up, gives an oddly formal wave
Grady
Hi
What's up
Jeff eases off the bed, past  uneasily
'll be
somewhere else
Hey, Jeff
If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall
Jeff nods--puzzled--then goes
smirks
He cribbed that from Borges
It beats 'What's your major
' nods, detecting a new aloofness in her voice
Right
Anyway,  was wondering if  could borrow your car
Mine's sort of out of commission
Sure
The keys are on the dresser next to
to your book
The hitch in Hannah's voice hangs in the room like a cloud
uh,  didn't finish,
fell asleep
That good, hub
No, it's not that, it's
Hannah glances at the huge stack of paper sitting on her dresser, then, hesitantly, looks back to Grady
It's just that, you know,  was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us '-that writers make choices--at least the good ones
And, don't get me wrong
'm not saying the book isn't really great- mean, really great- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and ail the dental records and so on-and don't know, maybe 'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like
(with trepidation) you didn't make any choices at all
And  was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always
under the influence
(stung) Hh huh
Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, 'm not the first writer to sip a little weed
And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book wrote, as you say, 'under the influence, ' happened to win a little something called the award which, by the way,  accepted 'under the influence
' Hannah nods, averts her eyes, and immediately  feels ridiculous
He starts to say something, but instead gathers his manuscript and exits
101
- Crabtree, dressed now, studies the freight 'in Grady's arms as he reaches the bottom of the stairs
Want some help with that
(passing by) Don't touch it
102
'  - sucks on a Kool, driving Hannah's rattling Renault too fast, shifting gears apparently at random
rides shotgun, still wearing the robe over his clothes, the Wonder Boys manuscript sitting like a watermelon on his lap-looking, all in all, fairly pathetic
Let me get this straight
Jerry Nathan owes you money
So, as collateral, he gives you his car
Only now 'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give
So whose car is it
My guess-Vernon Hardapple
The hood jumper
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his
Such as
'That's my car, motherfucker
' Hh hub
So
We find Vernon, we find the car
We find the car
we find the jacket
There's only one problem, Tripp
We don't know his real name
We just made it up
In fact, we made the whole guy up
No wonder he screwed us over
: legendary Pittsburgh Pirate second baseman, large as a Macy's Day float, his weathered image scaling three floors on the  face of a 103
' takes a corner recklessly, immediately slows, and blinks in amazement
Christ, Tripp
How did you know
Call it a hunch
Parked in front of '   is the white van
few feet behind, the battered Galaxie
'd call it genius

It's good to know 'm still talented at something
Keep the motor running

104 peers into the backseat, squinting against the that swirls around him
Errol Flynn's face leers back at him
But no jacket
slides in, pops the glove box, and frowns at the  of Humboldt County
He pockets it anyway, then spies something else
James Leer's little -
takes it, rotates it-in his palm off the chrome barrel and everything slowly turns to a ,
105
' stomps on his Kool
looks very much like a man who has pulled off the road to take a nap
What the hell
106 As  lolls behind the steering wheel, a appears, hovering, then slowly mutates, and  realizes it's not a cloud at all, it's standing by the side mirror, wearing a bright pink dress under her wedding jacket
know you
Marilyn's face swims before Grady's eyes, but there's something wrong with it
This girl's eyes are brown and besides, she's
fat
(cont'd) Double Dickel on the rocks
The last of the fairy dust evaporates and  finds- standing before him in a pink jersey dress and Marilyn Monroe's wedding jacket--0ola, the pregnant waitress from the Hi-Hat Club
Oola
never forget a drink
never forget an Oola
Suddenly, there is a
'  (0
) Forget me
starts to turn, but his head won't  move: largely because the  of a   is pressed to his temple
Grady's eyes slide
Vernon
(to Oola) Move away, cupcake
He's got a gun
Who's got a gun
You've got a gun, motherfucker
Drop it
Relax, Vernon
Why's he calling you Vernon
Why's he sitting in my car
He's crazy, that's why
He probably calls everybody Vernon
Not true
You're the only Vernon  know
Actually, 'm wrong
once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin
Shut up
(to Oola) Cupcake
Please
Inside
You' re not going to shoot him, are you
'm going to shoot him
If he doesn't put that gun down
It's just a souvenir
They don't even make the caps anymore
Bullshit
know a gun when  see one
And that's a gun
No, really
lifts his arm, points the little pearl-handled pistol to the   overhead
107
' jumps as the tiny pistol at the end of Grady's arm , makes a   in the wind
Holy shit
108 Vernon stands half-hunched, stunned
Are you crazy
The gunshot seems to have cleared Grady's head
He stares at the gun, watches Vernon wrest it from his hand
(cont'd) Get out
What's the matter with you
Can't you see the condition my girl's in
As  gets out of the car, Vernon places his hand on Oola's tummy
You all right, cupcake
Who's Vernon
rude  breaks the silence--rubber scratching asphalt--and Grady, Oola, and Vernon turn to see Hannah Green's rattling Renault lurching awkwardly toward them
What the
Gears , tires smoking,  fish-tails wildly, then kicks open the passenger door
Tripp
Run
doesn't move an inch, watching in mute amazement as whistles by, proceeds halfway down the block, then turns back for another pass
Who the hell is that
Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch
The car bucks crazily, picks up speed, and Crabtree-- swiping aside a flutter of   that have taken flight inside the car--begins to veer right toward Grady, Vernon, and Oola
Woah
Vernon steps into the street, levels the German Nine
(cont'd) Pull off, you crazy motherfucker
Frantic,  steps between Vernon, the German Nine, and the oncoming Crabtree
No
Don't shoot
He's just a lousy driver
fans the wheel wildly, goes into a slide and the passenger door snaps wide, releasing what looks to be a into the wind-whipped sky
Only, these ain't birds

my
God
These are

As Hannah Green's  ,  steps free of the car and looks skyward
It's a ticker-tape parade ail the way down the street, ending in the frigid waters of the Ohio River
(cont'd) (to Vernon) take it back
Shoot him
109
- Vernon drives, Oola at his side
In-the back, puffs philosophically on a Kool while  sits grimly with the sad remains of his manuscript: , one of which bears the watermark of a shoe print
Naturally you have copies
have an alternate version of the first chapter
You'll be all right then
Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage
That was MacCaulay
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories
He was never able to reproduce them
Bad examples
Look, Tripp,  don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps--in a sense- this-- (nodding to the pages) is for the best
Grady's eyes shift, study Crabtree
Kind of a sign, you're saying
In a sense
don't think so
In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle
Let me get this straight
All that paper that went into the river
That was the only copy
'Fraid so
(glowering at Crabtree) And you're saying it's some kind of sign
What the fuck's the matter with you
'm just saying that sometimes, subconsciously, a person will put themselves in a situation-perhaps even create that situation- in order to have an arena in which to work out an unresolved issue
It's a covert way, if you will, of addressing a problem
Vernon stares at  as if he's from another planet
'll tell you the problem
You behind the wheel
There's your fucking problem
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens
Excuse me
Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head
He was trying to steal my car
Ail right, all right It's done
There's no need to talk about it
It's done
They ride in silence for a moment, then Oola turns, glances at and his little sheaf of pages
So what was it about
(as  looks up) Your book
What was the story
stares into Oola's sweet, brown eyes
don't know
Oola's brow wrinkles
glances at his old friend, genuine compassion in his eyes
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes
It-lives in the mind
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right
mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it
couldn't stop
110 Grady, James Leer's hollow knapsack in hand, stands with at the campus entrance as Vernon and Oola prepare to leave in the Galaxie
Hey, Vernon
Can  ask you a question
Shoot
glances at little round Oola
Boy or girl
As long as it looks like her,  don't care
You know what 'm saying
watches Vernon give Oola a kiss on the forehead
Right
Well, thanks
For the lift
No sweat
Only do me a favor
Sure
Stop calling me Vernon
leans into Grady,
The jacket, Tripp
We need the jacket
(cont'd) Oh, right
Oola
About that jacket
Yea
looks at the waitress in her pink jersey dress, snuggled up in the silk wedding jacket
It used to belong to Marilyn Monroe
She had small shoulders, like you
Most people don't know that
As Oola smiles, pleased, Vernon shakes his head
Man, that book of yours must've been one nutty motherfucking ride
Vernon points an imaginary gun, fires a friendly cap into Grady, and pulls away
stands stunned
You mind explaining what you just did
watches the shrinking Galaxie sail under a drooping , lost in thought
Came to my senses Ah
Well
Congratulations
Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do
Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs
know that
Do you know he won't expel him
No
But  don't think that matters
That's very enlightened, Professor
It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher
blinks, ponders this briefly, then looks toward the buildings of the campus, his  still distant
Nobody teaches a writer anything
You tell them what you know
You tell them to find their voice and stick with it, because that's all you have in the end
You tell the ones who have it to keep at it and you tell the ones who don't to keep at it, too
Because that's the only way to get where you're going
(ruefully) Of course, it helps if you know where you want to go
(thoughtfully) Maybe that's the only thing--that and Sara-- that's made the last seven years worthwhile
slides James' knapsack off his shoulder, smiles cryptically as he considers it
- (cont'd) As for James, he doesn't need me anymore
Without warning,  tosses  the knapsack
(cont'd) He's got you
stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands, watches  walk away
Me
What can  do
Gee,  don't know, Crabs
(over his shoulder) Improvise
You're good at that
continues on, leaving  to stand alone, as he walks toward the buildings in the distance
'm sorry, Tripp
stops, turns
You peeked, didn't you
peeked
considers this
Nods
It-doesn't seem to matter anymore It really had the makings, Tripp
There was a lot to admire
've
never read anything quite like it
If there was a Kentucky Derby for editorial bullshit, Crabtree's last three utterances would finish win, place, and show
And  knows it
You're not just trying to make me feel better
looks directly at Grady, his old friend
Scout's honor
and  stare into each other's eyes
Both are acutely aware of the subtext of this conversation
Well, thanks for that, Crabs
111
- Dead quiet
Gradually,  are heard, coming from the stairwell, then  limps into view
112
'  - surveys the room
Empty chairs
Empty desks
He walks to a , the same window he stood at two afternoons ago when reading James Leer's story
chill breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the barren benches and icy walkways of the quad
Finally, he-
turns away, settles behind his desk and, reaching into his pocket, removes the seven remaining pages of his manuscript
He considers them, then folds them in half length-wise
He continues, folding the top right corner down into a triangle along the first crease
113 moment
Then-from the third floor window-a glides into view, soaring then dropping, soaring then dropping, again and again, graceful as a dove
114
-   - hobbles into the lobby just as one of the auditorium doors swings open
and he spies Sara standing inside, talking to a
Sara
Sara turns
as the door glides shut
As  hustles forward, , wine glass in hand, intercepts him
Grady
have to tell you
took another look at Arsonist's Daughter the other night
There's a description of a bald cypress that left' me breathless
(pushing past him) Thanks,
felt the same way about the bank teller's breasts in your last one
115
-  - enters, but Sara is
gone
He picks his way behind the back row, scanning the aisles
' Hey, Professor Tripp
It's Carrie McWhirty, James' tormentor from workshop
takes another look around, then drops into the seat- next to her
If you're looking for Hannah, she's on the aisle
No
But  looks anyway
Hannah sits a dozen rows down the aisle, hair pulled back in a clip, glorious skin gloaming
The Goatee Kid sits close beside her
Who's that guy she's with
Didn't he used to be in workshop
Jeff
He comes from a long line of tango dancers
116 Walter turns over the last page of-his prepared notes
And now, as those of you who've been with us in previous years know, we have a tradition of sorts here at WordFest
'm speaking, of course, of The Plums
An anticipatory  sweeps through the audience as Walter begins to read from a separate list
This weekend, Susan Lowery, of North Braddock, found a publisher for her children's book
The Loneliest Prawn, Susan, stand up
117
-  ^ As a   stands to acknowledge the applause, cranes his neck, searching the sea of seats
To his surprise, he finds  sitting prominently in the front row, in his shirtsleeves, smiling his spookily complacent smile
James is next to him, now wearing '    over Grady's flannel shirt
And Robert Wilkenson--who many of you know for his City Beat column in the Post-Gazette--has found a home with Putnam for his new Three Rivers thriller
Blood Patterns
Robert
,   stands briefly then Walter's takes a shift in tone
Now, this next one,  think, is especially exciting to announce, because it concerns a student here at the university
Our own James Leer, a sophomore in English literature, has found a publisher for his first novel, which believe is called The Lovely Parade
blinks, leans forward, and watches Walter smile warmly toward the front row
gives James a jab in the ribs and slowly, awkwardly, James rises
Stunned, Carrie McWhirty turns to the  next to her
have a class with him
James hangs-like a scarecrow from a nail, waiting as the slows, then sputters, then dies out altogether
The guy's kind of an alien probe, if you know what  mean
Grady, in a last attempt to save James from himself, cups Hi his hands around his mouth
Take a bow, James
James turns, spots  in the back row, then-a sheepish grin on his face--spreads his arms, hangs his head, and takes his first sweet public bow
(cont'd) (softly) Wonder Boy
And finally--and perhaps not least importantly--Terry Crabtree, of Bartizan, has also decided to publish my own book--a critical exploration of the union of Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio and its function in American mythopoetics-which, tentatively, 've entitled The Last American Marriage
" Wild, obsequious
smiles cynically, watches Walter take a brief, dignified bow of his own
: Until next year
Thank you, everyone
The  come up
As the auditorium empties, shakes Walter's hand and Jeff and his goatee escort Hannah Green down the aisle, where she drapes her lovely arms around James
watches them ail, sitting alone in his row, when suddenly Sara appears over James' shoulder
She says something congratulatory, turns, and exits out a side door
blinks, scrambles up
118
-   - bursts into the corridor
' Sara
Its empty
Quiet
pauses
Somewhere, a rushes on
119 Grady, limping badly, turns a corner and sees a
He moves to it, pushes past
120
- and finds himself standing in a stairwell
He leans out over the railing, peers down
It's a steep drop, very
steep, ending in a small rectangular space, a kind of basement office, with  ,  , and a
turns back to the door he came through, pushes against it
Locked
He sighs, looks back at the stairs, his ailing ankle, then sits
He fishes out the Ziploc of- marijuana, considers the perfectly roiled  floating atop the bag of buds, but, for once, isn't up to it
The of  echoes far below and, hopeful they're Sara's,  pulls himself up, peers over the railing
It's Traxler, with a broom, a big plastic bag
Yo, Traxler
(looking up) Hey, Professor Tripp
considers the Ziploc in his hand, looks down again
Do you get high, Sam
Only when 'm working
hangs-over the railing and lets fly the Ziploc
It pinwheels through the vortex of stairs, lands at Sam's feet
Holy shit
Are you serious
As a heart attack
Thanks-Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful ^here
is still hanging over the railing-but looking dizzy now
His eyelids flutter and he tips forward-a Steinway on a window ledge-and as he starts to drop
there is a   on his- , a caroms off his cheek, and slowly, he is hauled back
Grady, what are you doing, you idiot
looks up into Sara's freckled face
Looking for you
He wants to say more, he opens his mouth, but then '
faintly at first, then more forcefully, calling Grady's name, calling so insistently that the earth seems to upward until we see that she is
him or something, and all goes softly
Blue
121
- lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue plastic curtains in a blue room
Through a gap in the curtains, he can see the bottle of- that drips slowly into his arm, and beyond, a window
Flakes of fall outside
The  , a  ripples across the blue, then the curtains part and a  with a clipboard appears
His  says
passed out
You did
've been doing that a lot lately
So  hear
You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana,  understand
Do you think that's why 've been having these
(grabbing James' term) spells
How long have you been having them
The last month maybe
How long have you been smoking marijuana
Spiro
Agnew was vice president,  believe
That's probably not the problem, then
What about your lifestyle
Any major changes recently
've been trying to finish a book
And your wife left you
Is that in my chart
spoke with the woman who saved your life
You're lucky she came along when she did
considers the larger ramifications of this statement know
(tapping the glucose bottle) You need to see a doctor, Mr
Tripp
An internist
And  think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well
She told you about
Her dog, yes
Actually, it was her husband's dog
Greenhut glances up, looking  in the eyes for the first time, and stops
Look, Mr
Tripp
You have a drug problem, all right
On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected
We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot
As for your spells
'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately
They're anxiety attacks
That's a little disappointing
Better luck next time
So is my friend
is Sara still here
No
There's no one here
have to see her
As soon as possible
Greenhut studies Grady, calibrating the desperation in his eyes, then takes a quick glance at his watch
Look, Mr
Tripp
If you really want to leave, can't stop you
But 'm going to write you a prescription for a course of ampicillin and want you to follow it to the end-no matter how stupid you decide to be with everything else
All right

/  - sits in a , watching the snow fail around him as a  escorts him through the tunnel of glass that connects one building to another
wonder if you could show me something
123
-  - stares through the glass
There are only on display, heads dented from natural delivery, skin purple and crazy with veins
Are these the only ones you have
The nurse's eyes crinkle
(cont'd) Kidding
124
- pays a   , then turns,     looks at the Gaskell house
125
- Nothing
Peers into the living room window
Dark
He stands helplessly, then spies the greenhouse, standing ghostly across the yard, feathers of snow drifting onto its roof, melting
126
-  LATER12S hobbles to the greenhouse, puts both hands to the glass as he looks inside
Quiet
Empty
Dispirited, he pulls away, but not before leaving
the  of his hands, perfectly etched in the frost of the glass
127
127 The snow continues to fall as  lumbers down the street
Finally, wearily, he stops, sits his crippled self on the curb
He plunges his fist into his jacket and
straight through the lining, James Leer's silly little pistol at the end of his hand
He considers the pistol, then looks up into the sky
'  - of the
dark and menacing
Suddenly, a  shatters the silence
-
still sitting with the gun in his hand
(as if addressing God) Is that a suggestion
sits, blinking the snow out of his eyes, then of- dance across his shoes
white Citroen DS23 appears
It passes
Slows
Stops
stares at the car, burbling at the curb, then lifts himself up and makes his way to the driver's window
Sara makes a face, bugging her eyes a little-mad at him, but- not without humor
Then she rolls down the window
'm so glad to see you, Sara
believe you
Did that nice doctor let you out
Or-is this you improvising again, Grady
'm through improvising
Terry told me about Wonder Boys
Is  it true
Did you lose it all
lost it ail
Oh, Grady
You're such a putz
know
And you're old
Sara strokes his scalp, takes a gray hair between her fingers
Yanks
Ouch
How many
Dozens
It's very sad
Sara smiles at Grady, but the mischief leaves her eyes when she looks into his, and-she glances away
went and looked at-some babies just now
Oh
(trying to make her laugh) guess you have to go on faith
(she doesn't) Some times
studies her as she traces her finger around the still encircling his wrist
Did you tell Walter
told Walter
Does he still love you
It didn't come up
studies Sara's freckled cheeks, her anxious profile, then turns her chin gently toward him
Well  do
've always loved you, Sara didn't know it at the time, but 'd always been waiting for you
My whole life
Because you're who  need
Because nothing makes sense without you
Because the best moment of every day is the moment  first see your face
And because when you leave a room, there's no reason to be in it any more
It's just a room again
Sara cocks her head
Did you just make that up
(shaking his head) In the hospital
"was kind of excited about it at-the time, but then  was on pretty heavy painkillers
She frowns good-naturedly
(cont'd) Even so
it's still true
Every word
Sara just nods, looks away, her face unreadable
(cont'd) Sara,  promise, even though commonsense might tell you
Sara turns, puts a finger on 's lips
Don't write a page when a paragraph will do
nods, takes her hand
Looks at it as he speaks
You don't deserve me, you know
know, but sometimes
Sara turns, looks at Grady
Her eyes are glistening
(cont'd) You just go on faith
looks into her eyes, then rises, and we do too, drifting above the streetlights as  limps to the other side of the car and gets in
As  snaps shut his door, the car drifts off, gradually losing itself in- the soft veil of falling snow
After a moment,  and Sara are lost too, nothing more than a blur
