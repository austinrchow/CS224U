Written by Daniel Taradash (Second Draft - 8/29/1952) : - The quadrangle of Army buildings is quiet and deserted broken-down taxi drives in at one corner and slowly makes its way around the quadrangle
over shot is the : , 1941 The taxi pulls up across the street from camera
soldier gets out, pulls two heavily loaded barracks bags after him
He pays the driver, hoists the bags to his back, moves toward camera
The taxi drives away slowly
The soldier walks toward steps leading to a low building
He is  (called "" for short), 22 years old, well-built, good-looking
He wears an enlisted man's uniform and on the sleeves are marks where chevrons have been removed
He pauses, looks up over the door
to sign which reads:   - , 219TH
small thin soldier in an undershirt and fatigue pants backs out of the screen door and into shot
He is wielding a frayed broom
This is
He is violent and funny and sour and friendly
He sees Prewitt's legs but not his face, speaks as he sweeps a cloud of dust off the porch
Fine way to pass the time
Good for the mind
Hello, Maggio
Maggio turns and stares at Prew, astonished
Prew
() transferred out of Fort Shatter
Maggio notices the marks on the sleeves where the stripes have been removed
Prew follows his glance
You quit the Bugle Corps
2
Prew nods
Maggio jerks his head toward the sign
To here
() That's what the orders say
You made a bad mistake
This outfit they can give back to Custer
Prew smiles slightly, starts toward door
The Captain ain't in yet
Prew puts down his barracks bags
'll look around
(smiles for first time) Maybe we borrow some money from a twenty per cent man and take a real trip to town some night
Maybe
Prew walks slowly down the raised porch alongside the street
He takes the mouthpiece of a bugle from his pocket, jiggles it idly, a habit of his
He comes to the Dayroom, glances through the screen door, goes in
- The Dayroom has a pool table, ping-pong table, a radio, etc
Moth-eaten, upholstered chairs line both walls
The place is empty as Prew enters
He looks around casually, sees the pool table in an alcove
He moves over to it, puts the bugle mouthpiece in his pocket, picks a cue from the rack on the wall
He switches on the light, chalks the cue
The triangle of balls is already racked on the table
Prew addresses the cue ball, shoots and breaks the rack solidly
He watches the balls hurry around the table
3
'  (
) What're you think you're doing
Why ain't you out in the field with the Compny
What's your name
The voice is brawling, brash, vigorous
Prew turns slowly
to     , almost at Prew's elbow
He is thirty-four, big and powerful, has a neatly-trimmed moustache
Prewitt
Transfer from Shafter
Yeah
heard about you
heard about you, too, Warden
Well, put up that cue and come along
This here's a rifle outfit, Prewitt
You ain't suppose to enjoy yourself before sundown
The Man's very particlar about little things like that
Warden goes out of the Dayroom
Prew puts up the cue and follows him
as Prew and Warden walk along the porch, Warden a few paces ahead
They go into the Orderly Room
- as Prew and Warden enter
Maggio is sweeping the room
, a bespectacled, intellectual-looking Private First Class, is at the clerk's desk, opening it, taking out papers, etc
Prew sits on a bench as Warden goes over to Mazzioli
Mazzioli
Grant went to the hospital yesterday
Did you make up his sick record
Did you make a note for the morning report
You're the Compny Clerk
The lousy Sickbook is your job
4
Those medics didn't get the Sickbook back till late yesterday -- 'll tend to it right now -- Thanks
already done it for you
Maggio has swept his way over to Prew
He stops sweeping now, stares at the other man as if still incredulous
But you the beat bugler they got over at Shatter
You probly the best on this whole Rock
In b
g
, Warden has turned from Mazzioli and is looking at Prew
Prew looks back coolly, answers Maggio thoughtfully
That's true
Maggio wags his head, bends over to pick up wastepaper basket
Well, friend,  feel for you
But from my position  can't quite reach you
Ten-sh-
Prewitt, Mazzioli and Maggio spring to attention
The screen door bangs and    enters shot
He wears cavalry boots and spurs
He is about forty, unsure of himself, therefore always too certain with his men
He nods pleasantly
At ease
Good morning, men
Anything special this morning, Sergeant Warden
've only a few minutes
New man here, sir
Oh, yes
Bring him in
5
Holmes goes into his office
Warden jerks his thumb toward the door
Prewitt goes into the office
Warden follows him
'  - Holmes is seated at his desk as Prewitt and Warden enter placard on it reads:
smaller desk nearby has a placard' reading: 1ST
Warden seats himself at this desk
On the walls are framed photographs of prizefighters as well as one of a large golden trophy
On Holmes' desk is a small framed photograph of a very attractive blonde woman
Prewitt comes to attention in front of Holmes' desk
Sir, Private Robert
Lee Prewitt reporting to the Compny Commander as ordered
At ease
(takes papers out of drawer, glances through ) They sent your service record over
Twenty-two years of age
born in Kentucky
enlisted first at Fort Myer, Virginia
Bugle Corps
re-enlisted for overseas duty
Fort Shafter
First Bugler
() Prewitt,  always make it a policy to talk to my new men
It's important for an officer and his men to understand each other
Now have a fine smooth-running outfit
Holmes cannot see Warden who is grinning at Prewitt with unholy glee
Plenty of room for advancement for a man who knows how to soldier
But he's got to show me he's got it on the ball
don't know what you've been used to in the Bugle Corps, but in my outfit we run it by the book
What kind of trouble were you in over there
6
No trouble, sir
What made you transfer out, then
It's a personal matter, air
Oh
see
He studies Prew for a moment, sees Warden on the edge of his chair, watching hawk-like
Something you wanted to ask, Sergeant
( ) Who
Me
Whv, yes, air
You had Corpral's stripes in the Bugle Corps, Prewitt
You took a bust to buck Private to transfer to an Infantry Compny
Why
Because you like to hike
dint have no trouble if that's what you mean
( ) Or was it just because you couldn't stand to bugle
It was a personal matter
That's up to the Compny Commander's discretion to decide
(looks straight at Warden) All right
was First Bugler at Shafter for two years
The topkick had a friend who transferred in from the states
Next day he made him First Bugler over me
7
And you asked out on account of that
Maybe  just ain't sensible
But that's the reason
() His feelings were hurt
Kids they send us now
Warden swings his chair around, absorbs himself in work at his desk as if the Prew situation is too absurd to concern himself with
Holmes speaks blandly, winningly
've got a mighty sour Company Bugler here
but  suppose you wouldn't want that job
No, air
() Well, we'll get your stripes back for you, maybe an extra one for good measure
You know why you were sent over here when you requested transfer
No, sir
pulled a few strings
'm the Regimental Boxing Coach, Prewitt saw your fight with Connors in the Bowl year before last
With any luck you should have won it thought for a while, in the second round, you were going to knock him out
() Thank you, sir
8
() My Regiment got beaten last year in the finals, as you know
( ) But  mean to win this year
And will
All 've needed was a top middleweight
(waves at pictures) Next year 'll hang your picture up there with the others, my boy
'm sorry, air
But  quit fighting
Quit fighting
When
What for
just stopped, sir
After -- Maybe you heard about what happened
You mean that fallow you hurt -- the one that went blind
Prew's lips are drawn tight
He nods almost imperceptibly
During this shot Maggio can be seen in b
g
through door to Orderly Room
He pretends to be sweeping, but stops now and then to listen
Yes, it's too bad about that
can understand how you feel
But those things happen in this game
man has got to accept that possibility when he fights
That's why  decided  would quit, sir
( ) But on the other hand, look at () 9
(') it this way
What if all fighters felt like that
They don't
Would you have us disband our fighting program because one man got hurt
No, sir
dint say -- You might as well say stop war because one man got killed
Our fighting program is the best morale builder we have off here away from home
don't want it disbanded, sir
() But  don't see why any man should fight unless he wants to
It looks to me like you're trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf, Prewitt
You should know that in the Army it's not the individual that counts
If a man wants to get ahead he has certain responsibilities to fulfill that go beyond the regulations
It might look as though  were a free agent, but 'm not
Nobody is
Holmes waits hopefully for a moment, then realizes Prew is not going to respond further
He stands
Prew snaps to attention
Maybe you'll change your mind
In the meantime just don't make any mistakes in my outfit
( ) 've got to go into town
Is there anything else for me today, Sergeant
10
(holds up papers) Yea, sir
The Compny Pond Report's got to be made out
It's due -- You make it out
Is that all
(holds up more papers) No, sir
Well, whatever it is, you fix it
If there's anything that has to go in this afternoon, sign my name won't be back
He goes out, crossing Warden's desk and knocking a wire basket filled with papers on the floor
In a moment, the sound of the screen door slamming is heard
Warden picks up the papers
He'd strangle on his own spit if weren't here to swab out his throat for him
( ) Come on
'll show you the Supply Room
Warden goes out to Orderly Room, Prew following
- as Prew and Warden enter and walk through
Maggio bobs his head approvingly at Prew
- as they come out of the Orderly Room
Prew hoists his barracks bags to his shoulders, balancing them delicately
with him and Warden as they walk down the porch
(one of his unexpected ) Know what you did just now
() 11
(') When you turned down Dynanite Holmes' boxing squad
You put your head in a noose
Things are soft for a boxer in his Compny
Otherwise, you better know how to soljer
can soljer with any man
This ain't the Bugle Corps -- this is straight duty
'll take my chances
convertible, top down, drives by and pulls up outside the Orderly Room
, a tall, lean blonde woman, gets out
Her skirt hikes up a little as she goes up the stairs to the Orderly Room
Warden and Prew stop walking and watch her
Karen stops, glances at Warden momentarily, then goes into the Orderly Room
Since when is this place gettin to be the Royal Hawaiian
Who's she
His wife
Captain Holmes'
They resume walking
You'll fight, Prewitt
You'll fight because Captain Holmes got a bee in his hat he needs a winnin team to make Mayor
And if you don't do it for him you'll do it for me
only been in this outfit eight months myself but  learned one thing
My job is to keep him happy
The more he's happy the less he bothers me and the better  run his Compny
So we know where we stand, don't we, kid
know where  stand
don't believe that's the only way a man can get along
() 12
(') man's got to make up his own mind and go his own way
It he don't, he's nothin
Maybe back in the days of the pioneers a man could go his own way
But not in our time, kid
Today you got to play ball
You got to divide it all by two
They have reached a Dutch door, top half open
sign over it reads:
is eating a candy bar with one hand and leisurely typing up a form with the other
He is a foolish- looking man, about thirty-five
Lava
Can't  once walk by this Supply Room and find you workin with both hands
(comes up to door) can't do no better on what you people pay me
Draw some supplies for this man
( ) That's  Compny barracks over there
Get rid of your bags and come back here, and Leva'll find you a cart to lug your stuff over in
Save you makin four five trips
(surprised, pleased) Okay
just hate to see energy wasted
Any kind
Besides, you'll be needin yours
Prew walks off, toting the barracks bags
The bang of the Orderly Room door is heard and Lava and Warden look in that direction
' as she walks along porch toward them
She is at a considerable distance
Karen is about thirty
She wears a 13
sweater and skirt
She is aware the men are studying her
watching Karen
Leva leans over the counter
Her and them sweaters
' as she continues toward them
As much as a man can make out, she is probably not wearing a brassiere
Warden's and Lava's voices, loud at first, get softer and softer the nearer Karen gets to camera
At end of the shot, as she is only a few yards away, they are practically whispering
' Army women
They're cold, they got no more warmth than a diamond
There's no pleasure in them
' Yeah, but this one knows the score
Like  been tellin you
' () Is that right
' Okay, not around here
But  was back at Fort Bliss with Holmes
When they was married only a year or two
heard plenty about the lady then
Plenty
' You heard
' Okay, never me
But a lot of them
know some of the Use she played 'around with, don't tell me
' ain't tellin you
You're tellin me
Karen stops, a few paces from camera
Good morning, Sergeant
14
Lava watches, listens avidly but discreetly in b
g
During the dialogue, Karen seems irritated by Warden, who looks at her coolly, appraisingly, physically
'm looking for my husband
Captain Holmes just went in town, ma'am
Oh
Of course, He was to have left some things for me
( ) That he was to have purchased
Do you know anything about them
No, ma'am,  don't
Is there anythin  can do for you
No, thanks, Sergeant
She makes slight move to go, pauses
He's been telling me quite a bit about you lately
My husband
He says you're very efficient
Yes, ma'am
What is it that makes you so efficient, Sergeant
couldn't help it if  was born smart, ma'am
Karen laughs suddenly, loudly
love that
Well, good-bye, Sergeant
Karen turns and walks back up the porch toward her car
Warden and Leva watch her
When she is out of earshot Leva speaks
15
But man, she sure is one, ain't she
One what
One woman
() 've seen better
: '  - 22 Karen, in a negligee, is seated at a dressing table, brushing her hair -- steadily, gracefully, enjoying the sensual pleasure of it
Karen is a woman of moods and tempers, spontaneous, quick to impulse
car is heard pulling up in the driveway, the motor stopping
Karen's brush strokes become faster, rougher
The front door is heard opening and Holmes' voice calling, "Karen
" She does not answer
Holmes enters
He seems to have had a few drinks
Through the following, Karen continues brushing her hair
'm sorry 'm so late
And about dinner,  -- It doesn't matter
--  got tied up with General Slater
Bumped into him at the Officers' Club
Yes
What did the General have to say
Success, he said
Success in war, success in peacetime
And not a word about my promotion
There are times  think the Old Man's just waiting to ship me down
(slumps into chair) 've had a bad day all around
() 16
(') started right off this morning
trouble with a new man
If you'd spend less time buttering Generals and more time with your Company, maybe you'd get that promotion
The Company takes care of itself
Or my Topkick takes care of it
went over there this morning looking for you
() had some business to attend to in town
During the afternoon
() From the way you look  gather your business wasn't too successful
Now what does that mean
Dana
Give me credit for a few brains
How many, times do  have to tell you  haven't any other women before you'll believe me
Karen laughs sharply, loudly, then stops suddenly as she looks at herself in the mirror, sees the repugnance in her face
She puts down the hairbrush, picks up a long comb
If it were so, don't you think 'd admit it
The way things are between us now
What right have you to always be accusing me
What right
17
They are both tense now
Holmes is out of the chair and pacing
Karen combs her hair spasmodically
That again
How long will it be, wonder, before 'm allowed to live that down
After eight years, how many times do  have to tell you It Was An Accident
That makes it all right,  suppose
didn't say that
know what it's done to you, but -- You know  hate to talk about it
He moves over to her
How many times do  have to tell you 'm sorry, about that
How many times that  had no way of knowing - He puts his hands on her shoulders
Karen shakes away, rises, faces him
You had a way of knowing, Dana want to go to bed
Please get out of my bedroom
Holmes looks at her sullenly, then exits to adjoining room, closing the door behind him
There is a moment of silence, then a sharp snap as Karen breaks the comb in two
: - The room is fairly well filled with soldiers
The click of pool balls is heard over shot
Warden is reading a newspaper
column heading, conspicuous in shot, reads: Warden drops the paper on his lap, looks toward pool table, squinting thoughtfully
Maggio, Prew and  , a Corporal, are playing pool
Choate is a full Choctaw Indian, a man of great bulk and tolerance
He speaks in a tremendously deep bass voice
The 18
table on one side is surrounded by the prizefighters of Company
They are  , an ape-like, bent-kneed man weighing about two twenty, with a widow's peak almost to his eyebrows;  , chunky and tough, his head as bald as an orange;  , a stringy, chinless Mississipian; , a tall, hard Texan;  , wiry and good- looking
They are all Sergeants except Wilson, who is a Corporal
The men have been heckling Prew and are watching with cold belligerence
Choate, bending over his cue, shoots and misses
'm coldern a Idaho winter tonight
Prew shoots, makes a brilliant shot
Man, what  would not give to have this character in the corner poolroom in my home town: 'd dress him up on overhalls and a straw hat and put a grass in his teeth, and would make a whole mint of ghelt off him
Choate laughs deeply
Prew sizes up a new shot
We'd of won last year if we had a good middleweight
You box as good as you used to over at Shatter we're a cinch this year
Prew doesn't respond
He bends over his cue again
You ain't forget the Division champs get ten day furloughs, did you, son
Ey
You no talk now, Prewitt
But out in field with us you sing different song
An don't think you are tough guy
Quickest way to stockade is guy
You heard him
Better think it over
19
Lissen, it's his right not to fight if he don't want
Without bein kicked around
Now, we playin pool
Whyn't you take off
You want a busted head, Maggio
() No
Then keep your big nose out altogether
(turns back to Prew) Trainin season starts next week -- Prew has been growing more and more agitated, as much by an inner turmoil as by the men
His control snaps suddenly
told you  quit fightin
'm through
An that's all she wrote: You guys want to put the screws on, go ahead
can take anything you hand out
Okay, Prewitt
No halts barred
The five men move off, file out of the Dayroom
His paper still on his lap
He has been watching
He wears a faint smile of respect
, , Prew chalks his cue, hands trembling, turns to Maggio
Thanks
just hate to see a good man get it in the gut
20
You might as well get use to it, kid
You probly be seein it often before you die
: - In b
g
a few of the men are moving to and from the latrine but most of them are in their bunks
Over shot the sound of a bugle blowing Tattoo is heard
Lights are being extinguished in various parts of the room
Prew and Choate are lying on adjoining bunks, smoking
Choate's voice is almost linked to his last speech of preceding scene
oh, sure, we got a few bad non- coms and we got Dynamite Holmes for a Captain
But  been around twenty years in this Army
They even up
In b
g
Warden and   ()  come through from the latrine
The latter is a grizzled, crumbled dog- face, about fifty
Take  Compny
They got the best Compny Commander  ever saw
But their Topkick -- he ain't no Warden
Warden stops beside Prew and Karelsen moves on, going in to a small room off the main squadroom
Warden's big, powerful body is covered only by a towel around his loins
He smiles at Prew
Hello, kid
Everythin nice and comfy
Never better
'at's the lull before the storm, kid
Set yourself
He moves off, goes into the room he shares with Karelsen
21
What's the deal with him, anyway can't figure him
The lights are almost all off and activity in the room has ended
The Warden
He's a wild man
He was in the 15th when they seen their action in the Settlement in Shanghai
heard about it down in the Philippes even
He got himself a  and a Purple Heart out of it but you'd never know it if  dint tell you
This next war comes, Warden'll be right in there, standin up on the skyline, trio to get himself killed, but nothing will ever touch him
He'll come through maddern, wildern, craziern ever
All  know is he's the best soljer  ever saw
The lights are all out now and the room is in darkness
: - carrying rifles, marching at attention
Prew is  in shot; a light smile of pleasure as he moves along
Choate, bringing up the rear, is singing the Regimental Marching Song in a wonderful basso
Dhom marches on one side of the platoon, Galovitch on the other
Dhom calls out the "huts
" They are in perfect unison
' Prewitt
Get in step, Prewitt
Prew frowns slightly
He hops once, changing stride, realizes he is now out of step
' Prewitt
Dis a drill, not picnic
Get in step
22
Prew hops again, changing step
He marches along
Dhom's voice commands "Platoon -- Halt
" Prew and men around him come to halt
Prewitt
Step out
Prew steps to the front, still smiling faintly
You march like a drunk gooney bird
Corpral Paluso
Take this man to the track
Send him 'round seven laps double-time rifle at high port
: - Prew running around track, his rifle at high port
He wears a slightly contemptuous smile
sits on the grass infield watching him
: - kneeling over their rifles, laid out on shelter halves
Prew is  in shot
His shirt is wet and he is sweating heavily, as if he has just come from the run around the track
Henderson stands in front of the group, instructing
-- rifle's your beat friend
In case them weapons jams in combat could mean life or death
You got to know 'em inside out
Now  want you to strip them weapons and put it together again
(holds up stop watch) Go
The men start taking their rifles apart as fast as they can
Henderson walks around watching them
stripping rifles
Prew is efficient and brilliantly fast, Maggio fumbling and slow
Maggio keeps looking over at Prew, admiring his speed
23
as he strips the rifle
(This mechanical operation should be interesting to audiences; a good man can field strip the weapon in thirty or forty seconds
) Prew finishes the job and to  on shelter half where all the parts are laid out
' 'at's fair time
Now lemma see you put it together
Prew's hands start to work over rifle parts, putting them together
: - in Prew's hands, assembled,    as Prew stands up, holding the weapon
The rest of the men are still working over their rifles, Maggio is staring up at Prew in awe
Henderson grabs the rifle from Prew, turns his back to him, pretending to squint along barrel
looking along barrel
his thumb as he flips the rear sight to one side
Henderson turns around and to include Prew
He throws the rifle at Prew, who catches it, staggering back
Your rear sight's way off
You'd be fifty feet off your target at three hundred yards
(to others, mockingly) That's what comes when a soljer don't know how to assemble a rifle
( ) You better get down to the track and carry it around a few times
Maybe that'll teach you
: - running around track to sun, rifle held before him
The smile is fainter but still there
: 24
- The platoon is divided into teams of two
Thornhill is the instructor
This is actual hand-to-hand training
Prew wields his rifle, bayonet fixed, in expert thrusts
Maggio is fighting in next lane
Thornhill walks behind Prew, trips him quickly as he passes
Prew falls off balance
His opponent smashes his rifle against Prew's, knocks it to the ground
Prew whirls on Thornhill in protest
Wide open, ey, Prewitt
Maybe seven laps'll teach you to watch yourself
Maggio, wielding his rifle madly, yells over
Hey,  saw that --  saw what you -- : - toiling around track together, holding rifles
: - Maggio and Prew trudge wearily along the porch, rifles on shoulders
Their sweaty uniforms are plastered to their bodies
use to think a shipping clerk was a dog's life
(sighs, shakes head) What  would not give to be back in Gimbel's basement
As they come up to the Supply Room, Warden, neat and cool, is leaning on the counter
He steps aside to let them pass, beams at Prew
Chow's almost over, men
Better hurry up and wash
`less of course you'd rather go in the way you are
25
Maggio gives Warden a dirty look
Prew's expression is noncommittal
They carry their rifles into the Supply Room
Leva comes up to the door as Warden turns to go back to the Orderly Room
As he does, Karen's convertible comes down the street
Warden stops, watches it
' as Karen drives by, turning her head slightly toward Warden
There is the vaguest trace of i smile
as he turns to watch the departing car
'm tellin you, Top, she's trouble
You better keep your mind off what you're thinkin
of Warden, still looking after the car, thinking
: '  - It is a gloomy, rainy day and the lights are on in the office
Warden is at his desk, working
Holmes is buckling on his trench coat
He wears a happy smile
won't be back in time to take Retreat
(winks at Warden) Or Reveille either, probably
Yes, sir
(strides back and forth; ) All work and no play, Sergeant
All you do is sit around sweating over this paper and that
There are other things in this world beside work
Warden carries some official papers to Holmes' desk
(bending over, tying ) () 26
(') You ought to get out more yourself, Warden
Warden is looking directly at the picture of Karen on Holmes' desk
've been considering it
He turns aside as Holmes straightens up
Well, 'm going
He claps Warden on the back fraternally
'm leaving it in your care, Sergeant
It'll be here when you get back
Holmes goes out
Warden turns back to Holmes' desk
He is still holding the papers in one hand
He looks at Karen's picture, picks it up with his other hand, squints at it, considering the chances very, very carefully
: '  - standing on the open porch, in the rain
He wears a raincoat
He is squinting at the door with the same expression he used looking at Karen's picture
He takes a deep breath as if he were going off a high diving board, then knocks briskly
shadow moves across the room behind the curtains
Then Karen opens the door
She is in shorts and a blouse
Oh
If it isn't Sergeant Warden
You better step inside or you'll get wet
Warden opens the screen door and jumps in past the water running off the eaves
- as Warden jumps in
He takes off his rain hat
27
am wet
If you're looking for my husband, he isn't here
(taking the long chance) And if 'm not looking for him
() He still isn't here
If that does you any good
() Well, 'm looking for him
Do you know where he is
haven't the slightest idea
Perhaps he's in town
guess it was `in town' the way you put it, wasn't it
Or perhaps he's at the Club
Having a drink
(fishes in his pocket, brings out papers) got some papers it's important for him to sign
Today
() 'll try phoning him at the Club for you
never like to disturb a man drinking
( ) What is it you want, Sergeant
could use a drink myself right now
Bad
Anyway,  got a faint suspicion the Captain's `in town
' Ain't you going to ask me in
28
Karen finally smiles, faintly
She goes into the kitchen, leaving the door open
Warden follows her
- The kitchen is small and undistinguished
Karen takes a whisky bottle from a cabinet, pours a straight, stiff drink, puts it on the sink
Warden puts the papers down and drinks
Karen sits on a high kitchen stool
You're taking an awful chance, you know
My maid is liable to be home any time
No she won't
Thursday's her day off
He takes off his raincoat, drops it on a chair
You think of everything, don't you, Sergeant
try
In my position you have to
(goes to sink, picks up ) Are these really important
Yes
But not important they get signed today
Tomorrow's okay
Karen suddenly, deliberately, rips the papers in half
Then she tears them into bits and throws them into the wastebasket
Warden appreciates the gesture, relaxes for the first time
He grins widely
got carbons of those back at the office
So it won't be much work to fix them up
Warden's control has begun to affect Karen's now
She is losing her poise
29
That's what  like about you, Sergeant
You have confidence
It's also what  dislike about you
It's not confidence
It's honesty
Honesty
How did you acquire such an old-fashioned virtue
figgered out one day it was the shortest distance between two points
Well, he's clever as well as virile
No -- it's just that  hate to see a beautiful woman goin all to waste
He moves close to Karen, is on the verge of embracing her
Greatly tempted but greatly disturbed, she turns away
During next she pours herself a drink, the bottle shaking in her hand
Her tone is no longer brittle
It is bitter
Waste, did you say
Now that's a subject  might tell you something about
There's we
And then there's waste
Positive and negative
The negative is sometimes more interesting
more evil
For example -- what about the house without a child
Tell me your thoughts, Sergeant
You're going to cry
Not if  can help it
Please don't cry
can't stand to see somebody cry
30
Karen turns to face him as he picks up his raincoat, is about to put it on
What are you doing
'm leaving
Isn't that what you want
() don't know, Sergeant
To be honest,  don't know
They stare squarely at each other, both puzzled and a little afraid of their emotions
This is something neither had counted on
know a beach near Diamond Head
Nobody ever goes there
The cars on the highway pass above and they never know it's there
You feel like you used to feel when you were a kid, hiding by yourself in a cave, watching the others hunting you
Karen turns, goes to the sink, puts the whisky bottle back in the cabinet
Maybe
why not
How about Payday
Karen is trying hard to regain her glassy composure
She is unsmiling again
You don't have to spend money on me, Sergeant
just like to have some on me when take out a woman
Can you get away
Maybe
31
Warden grins as he puts on his raincoat
He goes to the door to the pantry, pauses there
'll be in Kuhio Park
Say, nine o'clock
Payday
Karen leans back against the sink, watches him go out to the pantry
moment later the sound of the door is heard as he leaves the house
She turns on the faucet, starts to rinse, the glasses they have used
Suddenly she turns the faucet on full force, watches it pound into the sink
: - The men are grouped around Holmes
He is pressing hard to pretend equanimity
The Sergeants appear somewhat baffled but determined
-- this man Prewitt's been here over a month now
expected you mend have him around before this
We've been runnin him pretty hard
But he don't faze
Maybe he needs a good dose of The Treatment
The men react to the phrase; The Treatment is obviously reserved for very special, intractable cases
They consider it silently for a moment or two
double dose needs him to be given
() The Treatment'll bring that puppy boy around
You understand
don't want any rough stuff
() 32
(') But we all know good athletes make good leaders
And good leaders -- The music of the forthcoming  drowns Holmes' words as he continues
: The  consists of a continuous stream of depicting Prew's growing humiliation and exhaustion at the hands of the non-corns
Mingling with the background shots are   of  of Prew
As the speed of the sequence increases, the stubborn smile on his face gives way to hurt, bitterness, anger
Over shots we occasionally hear stray shouts of the non-corns as they belabor Prew, but for the most part these and other dialogue are obliterated by The  can be selected and created from the : --
, ,   ( ) in all of which Prew excels
riding Prew, mocking him, grinning at him, thumbing him to the track, etc
is Galovitch, who takes particular Joy in baiting Prew
running around track, staggering despite a tremendous effort not to show his fatigue
with the platoon going through, crouched low, live ammunition spattering around them
Prew, nearest camera, is lower than any man in the line
Over shot we hear a snatch of Wilson's Voice yelling at Prew to get lower
Wilson bawling Prew out, thumbing him to one side of obstacle course
chinning himself on bar setup near obstacle course; he is near physical exhaustion
going through alone, on his belly in deep mud
( ) 33
coming - into camera as he bellies through the mud of the obstacle course
Snatch of mingled voices of non-coms yelling "Keep it downs", "Get that nose in the mud
", etc
Prew is utterly spent
His face drops into the mud, which splatters up, obscuring the screen
: - bent over the sink, scraping, washing and rinsing cooking pans and mixing basins
He hangs the soap bucket on the hot faucet and turns it on full force
As he does, , a fat, whining cook, dumps an additional huge pile of pans before him
Prew looks at them ruefully
Willard says something to him with a "hustle up" gesture
The faucet drowns the words
Men are working in the steady, helpless motion of the
Waiters swing in and out of the entrances leading to the mess halls, carrying large trays
The Mesa Sergeant, a tall, gaunt man, surveys the scene possessively
Maggio, Dining Room Orderly today, wearing a soiled white coat, flashes by to the mess hall, almost dropping his loaded tray in his haste
slow, lazy, heavy man, peeling potatoes
There is a large kettle filled with dirty water in front of him in which the potatoes are floating
Treadwell stabs at one with a long fork, misses it
He stabs again, almost in slow motion, misses again
He sees Stark glowering over him
Ah+m suppose to be a automatic rifle man, not a spud-cutter
() Rifle man, huh
All somebody'd have to do would be holler war at you and it'd be over the hill and far away
Stark walks off
34
they just give me my chance they'll see
He is surprised and pleased as he spears a potato this time
He raises it triumphantly like a caught fish
The faucet is still on and we cannot hear what Willard says as he dumps more pans before Prew
However, he is obviously complaining that Prew is slow
Prew, sweating and angry, barks something back at him and turns the faucet off
No cook ever used that many panel Not even for an officers, banquet, ladies invited
Want me to grow couple more arms
Stark, always alert to trouble, comes into shot
Willard sees him and speaks with whining dignity, for Stark's benefit
All  ask is that you keep the pans washed up so they're clean when need them
In order that  am allowed to cook the kind of food required for men who work hard all day and who need good nourishing food to get their nourishment
Hole up 'at noise
This man's hot as a forty-five shootin downhill
( ) How you think  can do my job if the Mess Sergeant takes sides with a goldbricking
What do you think  am
think you're a fat cook who can't cook
As Willard retires, Maggio pours through from the mass hall
Screaming joyously, he shoves two empty platters in front of him
Comin through
Comin through
Me and my table waiters
() 35
(') We workin our tail off
They runnin us to death
Hot stuff
Comin through hot stuff one side
Nobody pays any attention but Prew, who smiles at him
Maggio winks back
Hello, Prew
Bettern being threwn in jail, ain't it
Maggio passes camera, leaving the shot and disclosing Warden, who has entered from the mess hall in his wake
He carries a dish of eggs and sausage and is leaning against a pastry table
He is grinning lovingly toward Prew
He strolls over to Prew
He eats through following
The smile never leaves his face, broadens as the scene progresses
You look awful tard, kid
working over the sink
' How do you like straight duty
Life in a rifle compny, eh
Prew stops working, turns toward Warden
What makes you think  mind it
', , , , as something electric transmits itself and they all stop what they are doing to look over toward Prew and Warden
didn't say you minded it, kid just said you looked tard
Drawn to a fine edge
( ) don't mind it, Top
It's a great life, this
find a pearl, 'll cut you in
Fifty-fifty, If you hadn't put me here,  wouldn't have had no chance to find it
36
Well, well, there's a man for you
'll see if  can fix you up with a lot more since you like it so much
How you like the garbage detail
Thanks, Top, 've had it
You give it to me Tuesday
Remember
(nods, as if just ) Well, then, how 'bout street cleaning detail
That, too
Yesterday
() You got a better memory than me
Guess the best thing to do is leave you right in the kitchen a while, huh
He pretends to turn away, then stops, turns back
Course if you was an ath-a-leet you wouldn't have to pull
Or any fatigue duty for that matter
(not smiling now) If you think you can push me into fightin, Warden, you're wrong
Not you and Dynamite and The Treatment
'm twice the man you are
If you dint have them stripes 'd take you out on the green and beat you to a pulp
(smile growing bigger) Don't let the stripes worry you, kid
can always take my shirt off
Take it off right now
You'd like that
You could get me a year in the Stockade for that one, couldn't you
37
' closing around a heavy mug in the sink
Warden looking at Prew's hand
Warden's grin broadens with something more than sarcasm
He is 'impressed and pleased by Prew's honest anger
Don't throw it, Prewitt
It might break on my head
And that would cost you one thin dime next Payday
Warden deliberately turns his back and walks off
Prew looks after him
to  his hand on the mug
He grasps it tighter, then lets it fall back into the soapy water, : - He is blowing the bugle, sounding Pay Call
The rays of a blinding sun flash on its shiny surface
- The bugle is heard over shot
line of spruced-up men stretches through the mess hall
blanket is spread over a table and behind it sits Holmes, flanked by Warden and Mazzioli
In front of Holmes is a pile of greenbacks and a cigar box filled with silver
He is paying out the man at the head of the line
-- and just see you don't drink all this up in one place
The man smiles, appreciating the whimsy, salutes, moves off
Prewitt
Prew, next in line, steps up to the table
Robert
Lee,  345071
He is crisp, sharp, expressionless
He holds out his hands for fingernail inspection
38
Holmes looks them over, then up at the perfect knot in his tie
He stares at Prew as if trying to fathom him
Have you given any thought to the boxing team recently, Prewitt
() feel the same way, sir
Holmes' hands clench
He seems about to fly into a rage when he senses a motion at his side
He turns to see Warden looking straight at him
Warden's face has the same meaningfully expressionless look as Prew's
Holmes wilts before it, turns to Mazzioli
What's this man's pay
(reading from Payroll) Private Prewitt, thirty dollars base pay
Deductions-laundry, insurance,  checks
to   of Holmes# hands laying money out on blanket
' Total due twelve dollars thirty cents
: ,  - Payday night
gay, noisy jamboree
Soldiers, mostly in civilian clothes, and uniformed sailors swarm down the street
Taxi drivers arguing with their fares as they pull up at bars
Filipinos padding in twos and threes
: - Maggio and Prew, dressed in slacks and Aloha shirts, stand in front of what looks like a renovated residence
They give evidence of having already accomplished a little substantial drinking
The sound of loud piano playing is heard from within
sign over the door reads:    - -  -  -
The door opens 39
and
stands at the threshold
She is a sophisticated-looking woman with upswept hair, wears an evening gown with a corsage of orchids
The piano music, louder with the opening of the door, continues through all of the following
The pianist is hammering out " Don't Want To Set The World On Fire" (or a similar hit of 1941)
Greetings, Mrs
Kipfer
() Why, it's Angelo Maggio
He barges past her through the door
Mrs
Kipfer frowns and follows him
Prew shrugs and goes in after her
- as Prew enters behind Mrs
Kipfer
The vestibule has an old South feeling of mustiness and respectability
Maggio is handing some bills to , a young, brash-looking girl, who sits behind a reception desk
Okay
so there y'are
Dues all paid up
Who ya got playin the piana -- a hippo
Angelo,  don't believe 've met your friend
And you know how hate to find you boys in this condition
There
You see
Any time women see a soldier, think he's drunk
Why
You know why
Because he is
Heavy drinking simply doesn't mix with the entertainment business
Every respectable place must consider its future
Mrs
Kipfer, ma'am,  give you my solemn word your future will be safe with us
40
Maggio nods vigorously in agreement, then pushes through the heavy curtains which separate the vestibule from the room beyond
Mrs
Kipfer looks after him a little unhappily
Angelo is one of my favorites
Annette, dear, take care of this gentleman, will you, please
Mrs
Kipfer exits through the curtains
Annette takes a card from file, picks up pen
It'll be eight bucks, Babyface
Four for initiation fee, four for April dues
Say, what do  get for it
(rattling it off) Members are entitled to all privileges of the club which includes dancing, snack bar, soft drink bar, and gentlemanly relaxation with the opposite gender so long as they are gentlemen and no hard liquor is permitted
(takes a breath) Got it
Prew grins, digs in his pocket for money
got it
-    - Several rooms branch off from this main one
There are about a dozen soldiers in civilian clothes -- and about a dozen hostesses
Several couples are dancing
The man at the piano is banging away, his music clashing cacophonically with a jukebox record from an adjoining room
as Mrs
Kipfer moves to and fro encouraging the men to enjoy themselves
The New Congress is a sort of primitive
, a place of well-worn merriment
It is not a house of prostitution but the girls look available for goosing
all but one we see at the end of the
She sits alone on a couch
This is
There is an innocent, child-like look about her
Her hair is done demurely in a circular roll low on her neck
She is about twenty-four
She is reading a 41
magazine, untouched by the din around her
"" pounding the piano as if he is trying to knock the keys out
He has an enormous head and a hogshead chest
He resembles Porky Pig
His dead eyes look like two beads of caviar spaced far apart on a great white plate
Maggio is attempting some serious dancing with , a very tall girl
Fatso's furious tempo and tune keep drowning the langorous tango coming from the jukebox
Maggio keeps switching his style as he tries to get out of the range of the piano but cannot
He is very annoyed
He and Sandra dance out of shot, as Prew and Annette enter from the vestibule
them to a trio of girls on a couch
Girls, here's some new poison
This is Billy and Jean and Nancy
The girls smile, ad-lib hellos
Prew is looking over the girls' heads at someone in rear of room out of shot
' As if she senses someone is staring at her, she looks up from the magazine, smiles serenely across the room
as she reacts sourly to Prew's reaction to Lorene
He seems transfixed
Don't tell me the Princess is your style
Annette takes his arm, moves him toward two quite good- looking girls talking to a soldier
Meet Suzanne and Roxanne
The girls greet him heartily but Prew is looking back over his shoulder at Lorene
Annette plucks his sleeve with haughty disdain
Much as  adore your company, you must allow me to tear myself away
see a few friends at the door
() Also  can see  will be of no use to you much
42
She walks off
The other girls resume talking to the soldier
Prew continues to gaze across the room
smiling back
Her head tilts up slowly as if someone is coming toward her
Prew comes into shot and stands before her, tongue-tied
She pats the couch
Her voice is low- pitched, poised
Would you like to sit down
() Oh
sure
'm Lorene
(enchanted by the name) Lorene
haven't seen you in here before
Prew gestures with the membership card
dint know about this place till now
friend of mine brought me
We're stationed at Schofield
Oh
Somehow  didn't think you were a soldier
(bridles a bit) Well,  am
And 'm in for the whole ride
'm a thirty-year man
suppose it's different when a fellow is going to make a career of it
There ain't anythin wrong with a soljer that ain't wrong with everyone else
Lorene smiles her fatal smile at Prew's seriousness
43
like you just the same
liked you the minute  saw Annette bringing you in
() Me, too
mean when  came in saw you over here -- There is a commotion across the room
group of man and girls are surrounding the piano
Fatso has stopped playing and a shouting argument is going on between him and Maggio
Prew looks over, concerned
' 'll play loud as  want, ya little Wop
babble of voices drowns out Maggio's reply
Friend of mine
() You wait right here for me, will ya
( ) Surely
where two men are holding Fatso and three girls are restraining Maggio
The others are amused by the quarrel, but Fatso and Maggio are deadly serious
Mess with me, Fatstuff, 'll pull you apart
You're the kind of character  eat for breakfast, ya little -- Maggio breaks away from the girls and rushes toward Patso but Prew, stepping through the group, grabs him
Mrs
Kipfer bustles into the melee
Now, you gentlemen know  will not have any of this sort of thing
44
Shut up, you Wop, he says to me
Little Mussolini here tryin to tell me what way to play the piano
Yeah, my ear drums fit to bust already with that noise
You man can simply leave if you're not going to behave yourselves
Come on, Angelo, come on -- -- Ony my friends can call me Wop -- where Prew hauls Maggio away from the piano
(has been watching) You know who that guy is, buddy
Sure,  know who he is
Whadda care
Who is he
Fatso Judson
Sergeant of the Guard at the Post Stockade
settling down at the piano again
He glances over in direction of Maggio with a mean smile
Then he starts to hammer the keys viciously
as the music starts, Maggio stiffens, turns as if to go back
Prew holds tight, to his arm
-- 'm tellin you, leave him be
Nets danger
seen him nearly murder a guy once
He likes it
45
Sandra comes over, disengages Prew's arm from Maggio's, puts her own around him
All right, bully boy, now you won the war, let's dance
(beginning to quiet down) First  got to calm my nerves
Come on with me to a phone booth or some thin
(slaps himself on belly) Where  will unveil this fifth of whisky  got under this loose flowing sports shirt
He and Sandra start off toward an adjoining room
Prew smiles, turns back toward Lorene
The smile fades
' Lorene is looking at another soldier, on the couch beside her, with her rapt, innocent expression
as he crosses room to Lorene, hurt and disappointed on   as he comes up to her and the soldier, a talkative man named
-- you go along as fast as forty miles per through that surf and your balance has got to be letter perfect
Hey,  thought you were gonna wait
(looks up, smiles) Bill here was telling me about surfboarding
Hello, friend
( ) Sit down and just listen
He describes it thrillingly
Prew sits down, disgruntled
Bill notes his expression
46
You know anything about surfboarding
No
Nothing
Not a thing
You must be stationed inland then
'm at DeRussey so  get lots of chances
Yeah
But then we got mountains
You know anything about mountain climbing
little bit
Are you a mountain climber
No
You know anything about flying an airplane
Lorene is frowning now
've had a few lessons
Well,  can't fly either
What do you know about deep sea diving
Do you want to move into another room, Bill
Sure
The air in here seems to have gotten very smelly, hasn't it
Yeah,  noticed that, too -- Listen, fellow -- Shall we go, then
47
She and Bill rise
She smiles tremulously at him as she takes his arm and they start off
She throws a severe glance over her shoulder at Prew
He settles lower in the couch, the picture of frustration and hopelessness
He pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it
- Karen sits on the bench, her ankles crosses primly, very ill at ease
There is Payday activity here also; amorous strolling couples; men in ones and twos looking for pickups
Several unattached men pass Karen, ogle her
She is about to get up and leave when Warden comes into shot, stands over her
His civilian suit is neat and well-cut
Both are strained, awkward, antagonistic
Now that the step has been taken they are not at all sure it was a clever one
Why, hello
didn't think you were coming
Why not
'm not late
No,  guess you're not
But then came a little early
must have been overanxious
You weren't overanxious though, were you
You got here right on the dot
Maybe 'd of been early too only stopped to get a drink
You certainly chose a savory spot for our meeting
Would you rather it'd been the cocktail lounge of the Royal
No, but 've had five chances to be picked up in the last few minutes
48
(sits beside her on the ) That's par for the course around here
Well,  don't care for it
never went in much for back-alley loving
Didn't you
You probably think 'm a tramp, don't you
What makes you think 'd think that
Don't try to be gallant, Sergeant
If you think this is a mistake, come right out and say so
() Listen, what started all this, anyway
Why'm  shakin inside like a school kid out with teacher
Where'd  come up with a yen for of all things the Compny Commander's wife
And her actin like Lady Astor's horse all because  only got here on time
Warden's burst shatters the tension
Karen breaks into laughter
After a moment, Warden joins in
On the other hand, 've got a bathing suit under my dress
Funny
got one in a -Drive-It parked around the corner
He takes her hand
They rise and walk away, backs to camera
They merge with the other couples in the little park
-   - 49
Fatso's piano music o
s
Prew is slumped on the couch
He stubs out the cigarette, which is almost burnt down
He sees someone coming toward him, slowly raises his eyes
Lorene comes into shot, looks down at him
How's the surfboard rider
That was a terrible way to have acted
What you did
was jealous
() You're a funny one
What do you dames want
To take the heart out of a man and tie it up in barbed wire
(angry because she really ) Now, look here, what do you think Mrs
Kipfer pays us for
We're hired to be nice to all the boys
They're all alike
Is it so important
(; ) Yes, it's important
Maybe we seem all alike but none of us is ever all alike
() All right, 'm sorry about before
(touched by his outburst) That piano is about to drive me out of my mind
Let's go up to Mrs
Kipfer's suite and sit there
She lets us use it sometimes
for somebody special
Are you mad
50
No, 'm not mad
Because if you're still mad 'd just rather we called the whole thing off
(takes his arm) You certainly are a funny one
They walk away from camera, merging with the others in-the room
: - sweeping over camera, spray flying
tiny beach set among rocks
The pale sand glows in the moonlight
Warden, in a bathing suit, is lighting a fire about ten yards from the water's edge
Karen is just stepping out of her dress; her bathing suit is underneath
couple of blankets near the fire
Her teeth are beginning to chatter in the chill of the night air; she raises her arms to the sky longingly, happily
hope the ocean's ice cold
hope freeze in a solid chunk
(sudden, intense laugh) Just so long's you melt afterwards
love the way you laugh
He stands, moves to her
She laughs, turns and runs into the water
He runs after her
near shore, as Karen dives into it
Warden follows her
The wave washes over them
-
'   - 51
so we see only back of the divan
We hear soft chuckles from Prew and Lorene o
s
, then silence for several moments
as we hear a few more low, intimate laughs, then Prew and Lorene are disclosed on the couch, their heads close together as if they have just kissed pleasantly but not passionately
Mrs
Kipfer's living room is on the order of the vestibule; it, too, has a faded lavender feeling
door leading to another room is half open in b
g
door leading to a hall is closed
Prew's arm is around Lorene's shoulder; he is very relaxed, regards her with something like wonder
Lorene is mellower, too, making no effort now to be "the Princess
" She speaks as if resuming a conversation
enlisted, too
came out here on my own
To get away from my home town
In Oregon
How come
had a boy friend
was a waitress
He was from the richest family in town
He just married the girl suitable for his position
After three years of going around with me
() It's a pretty story, isn't it
Maybe they could make a movie of it
They did
Ten thousand of them
Lorene smiles
So  left and went to Seattle, as a waitress
And  met a girl just back from Hawaii
She said she'd made a lot of money working for Mrs
Kipfer
caught the first boat
've been here a year and two months
You like it much
52
Oh,  don't like it
But  don't mind it
Anyway,  won't be here forever
No
Sure not
mean, why should you
have it all figured out
In another year 'll be back home, with a pile of bills big enough to choke a steer
And then  will be all set for life -- There is a sound at the door and they turn towards it
as it opens slowly and a disembodied arm pokes through, its hand gripping the neck of a whisky bottle
After a moment, Maggio's head follows the arm through the door
He is grinning like an amateur conspirator
dint hear no sounds of combat
So figgered maybe you'd like a drink
as Maggio comes into the room
Or otherwise old Sandra would of drank it all by herself
She's a fine girl
But she drinks like a fish
There are glasses on a cupboard near the divan
Maggio sets three of them up, starts to pour whisky into them
No, thanks
never drink much
Maggio stops short of the third glass
He takes a big gulp from the first
think it' a a weakness
( ) grant you that
53
And  don't like weakness
( ) ) Do you
No
don't like weakness
(rises, takes a drink) But  like to drink
He comes back to the divan
With you it's not a weakness
With you it's more like a virtue
That sounds like a very profound remark
Maybe that's why  don't get it
(snuggles to Prew) Well, it's so
Hey
What you gonna do, marry this guy
Way you grinnin at him you look like his wife
Get outa here
(picks up bottle) Okay
Back to old long-legged Sandra
love 'em tall
Acres and acres
He goes out, closing door behind him
Suddenly the door opens again and Maggio pops back in
He puts the whisky bottle on a table next to the door
Enjoy yourself, pizon
You need it more than me
You be back with The Treatment tomorrow
He pops out again, the door closing after him
Prew's gaiety dims with the reference to The Treatment
Lorene sees this
Prew rises, goes to whisky bottle
54
That was nice before
The way you snuggled up
In front of him
What's he mean, The Treatment
Prew doesn't answer
He pours a drink, gulps it
What did he mean
Some of the guys puttin me over the jumps because  won't fight
Fight
On the boxing team
don't want to fight
don't want to talk about it
don't want to think about it
And they make me think about it
Every day
He drops down on the divan beside her
It's a personal thing
His dread of telling the tale crumbles before his overwhelming need to tell it, to have someone understand
Over at Port Shafter
used to fight
Middleweight
was pretty good
used to work out with Dixie Wells
He was a light-heavy, but he was fast
And good
He loved boxing
He was gonna come out of the Army and go right into the upper brackets
People on the Outside had their eye on him
(rises, paces) Dixie didn't want, to use the six ounce gloves this time
And we neither of us wore headgear, anyway
was set flat on my feet when  caught Dixie wide with this no more than ordinary solid cross
Dixie just happened to be standing solid, too
() 55
(') (sits on chair) From the way he fell  knew
Dead weight, square on his face
He dint roll over
He was in a coma a week
Then he finally came out of it
The only thing was that he was blind
(rises, paces) went up to the hospital to see him
Twice
Then  couldn't go back
We got to talking about fighting the second time
And Dixie cried
Seein tears comin out of those eyes that couldn't see
There are tears on Prew's face
He turns away from Lorene
Lorene, very moved, goes to him, stands behind him, puts her hand on his shoulder
Prew does not turn but his hand grasps hers
of the hands
- wave sweeps by camera, Karen and Warden riding it into shore
with them as they walk out of the water, hand in hand
They stop at edge, as if by a mutual impulse
He swings her to him and kisses her
as they kiss
The embrace is impassioned
When their lips separate, their arms remain around each other, holding tight to something they find is more than sex alone
as Karen and Warden kiss again, a tenderness in him not seen before and which he normally takes great pains to hide
as their lips separate again
Nobody ever kissed me that way
not really
They are both disquieted by the quality of their reactions to the kisses
The jump to banter is a quick defense
Nobody
them as they walk to the fire
Karen smiles at him
56
No
Nobody
Not even one
Out of all the many men you've been kissed by
Well, that will take some figuring
How many men do you think there've been
as they sit, beside the fire
Karen wraps one of the blankets around her
wouldn't know
Can't you even make me a rough estimate
Not without an adding machine
Do you have your adding machine with you
No,  forgot to bring it
Then  guess you won't find out, will you
Maybe  already know
The defense has given way and there is no mirth in the questions and answers now
What's the matter
What are you hinting at
Why
Is there something to hint at
don't know
Maybe a lot
Or maybe you just think there's a lot
Maybe  do
Maybe there's been a long line of beach parties -- 57
You must be crazy --
Am
Listen, baby, maybe not here
But what about when you and Holmes were at Fort Bliss
Karen flings off the blankets, snatches her dress, stands up, raging
She speaks as she pulls the dress over her head, wriggles into it
had to go and forget you were a man -- with the same rotten filthy mind the rest of them have
For a minute  had to convince myself you were different -- Only it's true, ain't it
Yes, it's true
part of it, some small part of whatever sewage you've been listening to
Some day perhaps you'll get all the story
( ) All what story
You're getting to sound so much like a typical male
So you just sweat it out like a typical male
She starts toward the rocks at the end of the beach, walking fast, then almost running
Warden runs after her
as Warden catches up with Karen
He grasps her arm roughly, hauls her down onto the sand
He stares at her bitterly, waiting f or her to speak
All right
've never told it to anyone before
But  think now is the time
'll tell you the whole bloody messy thing
You can take it back to the barracks with you
58
She speaks rapidly, pouring it out in bursts
For much of the story her face is in shadow, as if a cloud is passing across the moon
'd been married to Captain Dana
Holmes two years
Only he was a First Lieutenant then
Back at Fort Bliss
We lived right on a little lake where we could fish and swim and be alone, our 'dream cottage'
'm sure you must be able to picture it
It was off on a back road, four miles from the highway
Two miles from a neighbor and a telephone
(pauses, then rushes on) hadn't been married long when knew my husband was stepping out on me
But -- you get used to that
Your mother tells you that it's life, that i t happens to a lot of women
Of course, she doesn't tell you until after it happens
reacting with fury toward Holmes, compassion for Karen
Then, by that time, you're pregnant
And at least you've something else to hope for
think was almost happy that night the pains began
Even though they were weeks too early, a whole month too early
remember Dana was putting on that dapper silk gabardine uniform he used to wear
He was going to an officer's 'seminar
' He was kidding me about false labor didn't think it was humorous told him to get home early, to bring the doctor with him
He smiled tenderly and told me about the psychic reactions of women to pregnancy
But never fear, he'd be back early
And maybe he would have
if the 'seminar' hadn't been with the hat-check girl in one of the night clubs
59
Listen
He was only a little drunk when he came in
at five a
m
He looked alarmed when he saw me
guess it was because of my screams
was lying there on the floor, you see -- No, don't say anything
'm not finished yet
Of course, the baby was dead
It was a boy
But they worked over me at the hospital and fixed me up fine
They even took my appendix out, too
They threw that in free
It was all fine
Listen
Listen
Please
And, of course, one more thing no more children
Do you know what that means
You're not a woman
You're not anything
You're a gutted shell
Sure,  went out with some of the men after that few months of it
'd been made dirty and  wanted to be clean
You can see that, can't you
Anyway, got my revenge on Dana
kept on living with him
The hateful, miserable -- You hunt so hungrily for love
love, if you can find it, you think, might give things meaning again
Listens Listen to me -- All right
'm listening
Warden shakes his head, inarticulate with his rage and love
Karen moves closer to him
60

Until  met you  didn't think it was possible, either
: - Over shot soft strumming guitars and two voices singing a quiet blues
There are scattered groups,about fifteen men in all -- playing pool, ping-pong, reading, writing letters, talking
and Friday Clark, playing the guitars and singing
Clark plays only passably, but Anderson is highly accomplished, effortlessly sounding off chord progressions in diminished minors
Friday, the bugler, is about twenty-four, with shy, trusting eyes
Anderson is the same age, also quiet, non-aggressive ,  a soldier reading a newspaper who shakes his head and mutters, "
ain't it terrible about Lou Gehrig dyin
", then   to  on a group at a window seat, bulling
Prew is stretched out wearily, looks as if he's been through another recent dose of The Treatment
Maggio perches in the frame of the window like an aggressive robin
Treadwell slouches at the end of the seat
Pete Karelsen is in a chair nearby, reading a magazine
Ah'm in the Army because Ah can live better on the Inside than on the Outside
It ain't the reason 'm in
Now he's gonna give us that snow about bein a Thirty-Year Man again
That's right
Look at Karelsen there
Only seven years more for rockin chair money
Karelsen hears his name, looks over
so we see he's reading a full-page advertisement featuring a girl in a revealing negligee
He is feeling sorry for him;elf
61
The Profession wears you down, though, young man
Down thin like a knife what's been honed and honed
All that good steel just rubbed away
He turns back sadly to study the figure of the girl
Anderson peels off a flourish as he and Clark end their song
Man, that's blues
Where'd you drag that one up Prom
() Oh, just stumbled on it
He strums aimlessly again
Prew and Treadwell come over to listen, prop themselves on chairs
During following, several others stroll over and a soldier writing at a desk nearby stops, turns to listen
warmed by the friendliness of the music and the moment
They got Truckdrivers' Blues
Sharecroppers' Blues
Bricklayers' Blues
We oughta have a Soljers' Blues
as Anderson repeats a theme he has happened on
It has a haunting melody
Hey, look
betcha we could make one out of what you just played
Do that again
Anderson repeats the melody
could bring it down to a third line major ending
Regular twelve bars blues
bet  got two hundred blues records back home
() 62
(') But there ain't one could touch that
And that includes Saint Louis
And it could be ours
The men wear pleased smiles, delighted by the idea of possessing something quite rare and truly their own
Prew flips his cigarette into a can
got it
We call it the `Re- enlistment Blues'
There is a chorus of approval
Lookit, w e could start it with the guy getting discharged
(reaches over to desk) Hey, fella, can  use this
The soldier at the desk nods, and Prew takes his pencil and paper
He writes down the words of the song as they are composed during following
How's this
'Got paid out on Monday
Not a dog soljer no more
They gimme all that money
' He stops, stuck
Anderson plays the melody and Prew sings the words to this point
Friday Clark chimes in suddenly
'They gimme all that money
So much my pockets is sore
' They laugh
Anderson sings
Prew writes furiously
'More dough than  can use
Re- enlistment Blues
' Anderson plays a series of chords, then repeats the last two lines as the whole group joins in
'More dough than  can use
Re- enlistment Blues
' : 63
- Raucous, hammering music sweeps away the melancholy blues
On the floor of the gym Dhom is punching the bag
In a corner of the raised ring Ike Galovitch is skipping rope
In the center of the ring Thornhill and Henderson are sparring
Holmes hovers beside them, issuing instructions in a strident voice
He is in fatigue clothes, on his knees, scrubbing the floor
There is an expression of stubborn hate on his face
Above his head in the shot are Galovitch's feet jumping the rope
In b
g
of shot is Wilson, seated near ring
' Some day you get sense in your dumb head, Prewitt, you be up here instead down there
fine spray of spit accompanies the words and showers over Prew but he keeps about his work
Still makin out you like it, huh
There are two water buckets near Galovitch
He skips near one of them, kicks it
The bucket falls on its side and dirty water spills over the ring and down onto Prew
Clean up dis mess, Prewitt
Prew gets to his feet
Galovitch resumes skipping rope
And look a life, hurry it up
You on fatigue detail, not vacation
Prew climbs into the ring, gets on his knees, starts to swab up the canvas
He is nearly finished when Galovitch "accidentally" kicks over the second bucket
Clean up, Prewitt
Prew suddenly stands, no longer able to contain his rage
He throws his sponge and scrubbing brush on the ring floor
Clean it up yourself
64
How
What
You heard me -- rub your own nose in it a while
What
Prew starts out of the ring
Holmes intercepts him
What's the matter with you, Prewitt
You know better than to talk back to a non-commissioned officer
Yes, sir
But  have never liked being spit at, sir
Even by a non- commissioned officer
think you owe Sergeant Galovitch an apology
() don't think  owe him no apology
In fact,  think one's owed to me
() Sergeant Galovitch, take this man to the barracks and have him roll a full field pack, extra shoes, helmet and all, and then take a bicycle and hike him up to Kole- Kole Pass and back
And see that he hikes all the way
And when he gets back, bring him to me
Yes, Sirr
Prew climbs out of the ring, Galovitch following him
: - 65
Par below in the shot are Prew, hiking, and Galovitch, riding behind him on the bicycle
The dirt road is steep and the sun pours down, steaming hot
Prew is hunched under the seventy-pound pack as he plods along
He is sweat-soaked, puffing, dog-weary
Galovitch's bicycle is just behind him; he runs the wheels up on Prew's heels
Move along
You not half way yet
Three more miles to top
jeep rounds a curve a couple of hundred yards above and moves down the road
It slows its speed and pulls up when it nears Prew and Galovitch
The jeep is driven by an enlisted man
Sitting next to him is Galovitch hops off the bike and he and Prew snap to attention
General Slater leans out of the vehicle
He seems puzzled and interested by the odd sight of the two men
At ease
Where're you men headed
Top of pass, Sir
This man insubordinate
The Captain is teaching him lesson
() What's your outfit, Sergeant
Company , 219th, Sir
The General, still frowning slightly, nods
He signals his driver to move on
The jeep starts down the road
Galovitch gets on his bicycle
Prew starts hiking again
: '  - Prew and Galovitch are standing in front of the Captain's desk
Prew is at attention, the heavy pack on his back; his face is drawn and tired; his clothes are plastered to him
He has regained his old expressionless look
Warden has swung his chair around and is surveying the scene
Holmes looks 66
Prew up and down, half-smiles
take it you're ready to apologize to Sergeant Galovitch now
No, sir, 'm not
Holmes' face sets; he jerks his head toward the window
Take him back up there again, Galovitch
He hasn't had enough yet
(nods unhappily, sick of ) Yes, air
Prew about-faces and goes out
Galovitch follows
Warden watches Prew go out, then looks toward Holmes whose back is to him
Disgust is reflected on his face
Holmes slams his fist on his desk
1 know that kind of man
He's an againster
bitter-ender
You can't be decent to a man like that
You have to tame him, like an animal
( ) Warden,  want you to prepare court martial papers
Insubordination and insolence to an officer
Yes, sir
Warden swings around to his own desk
He thinks for several moments, tries to sound quite casual
Too bad you got to lose a middleweight like that
Why
Do you see any other way of breaking him
67
don't know
But even if he only gets three months, he'll still be in the Stockade when the boxing finals come up
He looks over at Holmes, sees him scowling, weakening
How about just giving him a good stiff Compny punishment for now
Holmes ponders the situation unhappily, rubs his hand over his face,
shakes his head as if the whole thing is too much for him
All right, all right
But throw the book at him
(pleased but impassive) Yes, sir
: '     - He is trimming his moustache
'm sick of it
They ain't got no right to keep breakin it off in that kid
Sooner later Holmes is going to hound him right into the Stockade
,  Karelsen across the room, undressing tiredly, achingly
Warden is sharp and blustering, using Karelsen as an escape valve
During following he goes to his footlocker, opens it, takes out whisky bottle, drinks
'm through
'm turnin in my stripes
mean it, Pete
could transfer out tomorrow
In Grade -- get that
To half a dozen Compnys in this Regmint
68
Oh, sure
could be Chief of Staff, too, except  can't stand leaving all my old buddies
Karelsen is naked now except for a bath towel knotted around his middle
He slips his feet into Japanese-style, wooden clogs, starts slowly for the door
Where you going, Little Sir Echo
To take my stinkin shower, if the First Sergeant's got no objections
Where'd you think
To the movies in this towel
() Hurry up
Let's go over to Choy's for some beer and tear up all the tables and chairs
(smiles, moves faster) Okay, Okay
: ' - An aged Chinese, at least seventy-five,   has a long white beard and wears a black skull cap and an embroidered robe
He is motionless, surveying the pandemonium which we hear over shot: the sounds of men laughing, talking and shouting blend with jukebox music blasting Chattanooga, Choo Choo
, Old Choy's son, passes; he is thirty, white- aproned, bustling, Americanized
him, the small beer-house; it has unpainted cement walls and a cement floor; the only thing that might be called decorative is the jukebox
The place is crowded with men from Schofield, a raucous assemblage; everyone is drinking beer and the smoke hangs in thick layers
At a table near the door sit Prew, Maggio, Clark, Anderson, Treadwell and Mazzioli
At a corner table behind a forest of beer bottles and cans are Warden, Stark, Karelsen and Chief Choate
' 69
China's the place
Your money's worth ten, twelves times as much
'm gunna ship over soon as my time's up in this pineapple Army
(pinching beer off his ) The Canal Zone for me
This girl down there
She was a planter's daughter, see
She lived a very sheltered life
very moral young lady, Milt
took her out to a high class dinner and then dancing
It was a great shock to her to learn about life
But she took it well
She got to like me very much after that
The last time  heard it you told it different
Well, what did you expect
was in a different mood, then
' Maggio, Anderson and Treadwell are comparing snapshots from home, spreading them out on the table
Mazzioli is talking to Prew with great earnestness
it's in regulations
You've got a right to complain
You've got a right to take your case to the Inspector General
Any soldier has, even a plain dogface
know it
'm not complainin to nobody
They ain't goin to get the satisfaction of seein me squirm
Clark begins to play the bugle softly along with the jukebox music, noodling an uninspired obligato
(pointing to pictures) believe it nor not, this is one soljer who's got a family -- look, fifteen of 'em
() 70
(') See that old man with the handlebars
() Mr
Maggio is my father
Listen, Prew
guess  ought not to tell you but --
Warden hasn't had you on  much lately, has he
Only my reglar turn
Well --  was working in the Orderly Room this afternoon and heard the Captain telling Warden you're to pull  every weekend from now on
You know what that means -- you can' t even go into -- Whadda they want
They done everything, now they look me in a box
What else they gonna try
Clark hits a sour note an the bugle
() When you gonna learn to play a bugle
In overwhelming, uncontrollable protest, Prew slaps the bugle away from Clark's mouth
In one motion he wipes the mouthpiece on his sleeve, raises it to his lips and blows his own wild, violent obligato to the jukebox music
' as Prew plays on, the bugle's pure tone pealing through the room
Everyone puts down his beer, stops talking and turns toward Prew
reacting
He frowns, moved by the cry behind the music
' as he watches and listens, an exultation for his friend nakedly revealed on his face
' Hitting an almost impossibly high note, he stops as suddenly as he has begun
He has played perhaps fifteen seconds in 71
all
He puts the bugle down on the table, embarrassed now, the violence gone, some of the wrath unloaded
The room is quiet for several moments, except for the continuing jukebox music, which sounds pale and thin now
Fatso Judson strolls in, stands at the door
Some of the men see him, but no one greets him
Fatso threads his way between tables as the room slowly begins to return to normal and the men turn back to their beer
' as Fatso passes
He stops, leans over Anderson's shoulder to look at the snapshots on the table
He points to one picture, a pretty young girl of about fifteen, posing Hollywoodishly in a bathing suit, cracks his knuckles loudly
Who's that
Who's that dame
() My sister
Fatso whistles
He picks up the photograph, stares at it, whistles again
Whoever
Say, she's a real good piece of whistle bait
'd sure like to get my mitts around her
He laughs complacently at his own wit, tosses the picture on the table, starts to move on, Maggio rises, picks up the heavy wooden stool he's been sitting on and smashes it down on Fatso's head with all his strength, as again the laughing and shouting in the room stops abruptly
Fatso reels a little with the terrible blow but does not go down
Why, holy --  You hit met You hit me
() You bet your life
( ) And about to do it again
72
(still blinking from the ) What
But what for
That's no way to fight
(reaches hand to head, brings away blood) Why, you dirty yellow sneaking -- Wop
You yellow little Wop
If that's the way you want to play
With his last sentence, Fatso whips out a knife and snaps open the blade
The blade is at least five inches long
It glints evilly as he raises it
There is a concerted whisking intake of breath from the room
Murder is clear on Fat sots face
'  ( ) Maggio, holding the stool high, backs up a few feet as Fatso advances toward him
Men sprawl away from them
' Hey, it you want to fight, fight with fists
Take it outsides There is a murmur of agreement from the crowd
couple of men are about to rise
Fatso whirls toward them
'm gonna cut this little Wop's heart out
Anybody steps in here, give it to him first
side by side
Old Choy watches, immobile, his slit eyes almost closed
Young Choy is shaking with fright
Fatso turns toward Maggio, who circles back around the table as the other stalks him
(scared but brave; shouts) 'm gunna de-brain ya, Fatso
One step closer an 'm gunna kill ya
Fatso has his knife poised at his shoulder, ready to strike
Warden comes into shot suddenly
He brandishes a beer bottle wildly, looks like an avenging spirit of authority
73
Nobody's gunna do nothin
Anybody's killin anybody around here, it'll be me
Warden snatches another beer bottle from a table, now has one in each hand
He steps between Fatso and Maggio
Look outs here, Warden
This a private affair
No it ain't
This man's in my Compny an 'm responsible for him
And you ain't makin two weeks extra paper work for me by killin him
Nor him you
Put that knife down
He smashes the neck off one of the beer bottles, points the wagged edge at Fatso, roars: Put it down
Fatso slowly lowers the knife to his waist, but keeps it pointed towards Maggio and Warden
Warden deliberately turns his back to Fatso, spits his words at Maggio
Killer
You unweaned punk& Come on, you want some killing, come on
(whirls on Fatso) Come on, barrelbelly
Ain't you comin
Neither Fatso nor Maggio moves
(with mammoth contempt) Killers
You'll get plenty of killing, all right
More than you got the stomach for
You'll be in a war one of these days
When you feel that lead from a sniper's rifle hit you between the eyes, come and tell me how you like it
Killers
(turns to Maggio) Now put down that chair
Maggio puts down the stool
Warden turns to Fatso
74
Throw that knife on the floor
Fatso drops the knife
It clatters on the floor
There is another audible whoosh of breath from the room
Almost scared there wasn't anybody going to stop you for a minute, weren't you
(finally lowers his voice) Is there any other little things you punks'd like me to take care of for you
He drops the beer bottles on a nearby table, strides to his own table
The room settles back, still hushed
Warden has broken the mood of certain death, but Fatso, still facing Maggio, bites off his words with sadistic, ominous venom
Tough monkey
Hard sister
Guys like you get to the Stockade sooner later
One day you walk in there 'll be waitin
'll show you a coupla things
He walks away, drops into a stool at the counter
' Warden stands beside the table, watching
He seems satisfied as Fatso moves away from Maggio
Still standing, he raises his half-filled bottle of beer, drinks
' Maggio drops onto the stool, sidles it over to the table
He half-whispers to Prew
made a mistake  guess, but don't see how  could of done anything else, after that big stoop said a thing like that
Prew leans over and picks the knife off the floor
'll tell you your mistake
You didn't hit him hard enough to put him out
75
hit him hard as  could
His head must be solid ivory
In b
g
Warden puts down the beer bottle and stalks towards the door
Maggio and Prew turn to watch him pass
Anyway, 'm glad he stopped it
He's a good man, you know it
As if on impulse, Prew rises and follows Warden out
' - as Prew carves out
Choy's is on a wide road across from the entrance to the Post
Prew looks around for Warden, sees him off to one side
Prew as he goes over to him
leaning against the building, undergoing a delayed reaction to the fierce moment in Choy's
He is white-faced, sweating heavily
He looks as if he's going to be sick
astonished yet appreciative that under Warden's confidence and control in Choy's there has been a human frailty
That was a near thing
Yeah
Prew holds out Fatso's knife
Warden is beginning to get control of himself; he manages a weak smile
You keep it, kid
Keep it for a souvenir
Prew puts the knife in his pocket
They stare at one another a few moments, each inarticulate, each wanting to express some deep emotion of respect
You ain't enjoying life much, are you, kid
76
( ) They can kill you but they can't eat you, Top
Warden studies Prew thoughtfully
Prew turns to go back into Choy's
Prewitt
Prew stops, turns back
Could you stand a weekend pass
Prew stares at him for a second, incredulously, unable to find his voice
thought -- You thought what, kid
How about Dynamite
Leave Dynamite to me
He signs most anything  put in front of him `thout readies it
Though Prew is overjoyed he is somehow unable to say "thanks"; Warden grins broadly at him
hear you gone dippy over some dame you met at the New Congress Club
He slaps Prew on the shoulder roughly
What'd you say her name was
Lorene
Pretty name
77
Warden walks off across the street
Prew stares after him
: - Lorene is covering Prew with sand and has him almost completely buried
Only his face remains uncovered
He is griming up at her
She seems thoughtful
Lorene
She throws a towel over his face
He chuckles under it
My name's Alma
The chuckle from under the towel dies
Alma Schmidt
There is a sound as of strangling from under the towel
Mrs
Kipfer picked Lorene out of a perfume ad
She thought it sounded French
Lorene whisks the towel away
Prew's face is comic in its surprise and chagrin
: - (: From this point on "" will be used instead of "

An orchestra in b
g, is playing "Someone's Rocking My Dream Boat
" Alma and Prew are seated at the bar
She is dressed modestly and becomingly, might well be taken as a society girl
Prew is wearing a civilian suit; he looks bound and choked in it
Alma
She smiles ruefully, realizes her real name has rubbed off some of the enchantment
78
No, honest,  like it
Alma's a -- swell name
It was great you gettin away today
told Mrs
Kipfer  was sick
But bet she doesn't believe it, There's no tellin when 'll get into town next
The Warden gave me a break this time
But Holmes and those others, they got me on the edge
just about went off the deep end the other day
You must hate the Army
Hate the Army
Sure
Look what it's doing to you
It's not the Army that's doing it
It's Man
love the Army
Love it
Well, it sure doesn't love you in return
When you love something it doesn't mean they got to love you in return
Yes, but a person can stand just so much from something -- No

The Army
enlisted at Fort Myer and  learned how to box and learned how to play a bugle never had much call for the boxing - - but if it weren't for the Army 'd never of learned how to play a bugle
bugle
Prew nods
He takes the mouthpiece out of his pocket, shows it to her
This is the mouthpiece  used to play a Taps at Arlington
Alma takes the mouthpiece, looks it over, seems unimpressed
(as if saying " was ") They picked me to play a Taps -- at Arlington Cemetery
She still looks dubious, hands the mouthpiece back
He tries desperately to communicate
Look
Think
You ever think how strange a tree would look to one who had never lived upon the earth
Well, somehow that's how  feel when  play a bugle
There is a boisterous shouting nearby
' Hello, citizen
told ya 'd meet ya, dint
They turn and   to  Maggio, who has just come up to the bar
He is in uniform
Prew is pleased to see him but also alarmed; there is something near-desperate under Maggio's drunkenness
80
How'd you get a pass
dint get no pass
just took off
meant to bring a girl with me but -- You better get your tail back to the Post
Right away
Maggio shakes his head violently in the negative
'm out for the night
got a bellyfull
nail, Prew
stinkin nail
'm thirsty for a nail
Prew gives him a cigarette
Maggio hops on an empty bar stool a few places removed from Prew and Alma
Climb up on my shoulders, Prew
You can see everythin from up here

MPs watching Maggio, attracted by his voice and behavior
Maggio talks across others at the bar to Prew and Alma

Oh, lose

You look like a movie star, Lorene
yes, you do
How long 'fore we get in the war, Prew
don't know
Maybe we won't get in
Tha's what you say
He jumps off the bar stool suddenly, tears off his tie
Hot in here
He throws tie on the bar, The Bartender starts to protest
Swimming It's a great night for swimmin

He is unbuttoning his shirt as he abruptly dashes away, People around are laughing at him again
as Prew watches Maggio rush out
He sees something else o
s, which worries him
' The two MPs cross toward direction Maggio has taken
They are obviously going after him
Alma follows Prew's troubled look
You better go look out for him, Prew glances at her gratefully, then slips off his stool
He picks up Maggio's tie and shoes and hurries out after him
: - Tall pale royal palms contrast with thick dark plants and bushes
An ornamental lamppost alongside a walking path a little distance away
Prew comes into shot cautiously, carrying Maggio's tie and shoes
He moves quickly, bends over
and we see it is Maggio's shirt and trousers which Prew has discovered on the ground
He looks at them wryly, picks them up, moves on
Prew, carrying Maggio's clothes, stops as he sees what looks like a shadow lying across the bench
( ) Is that you, Angelo
The shadow does not move
Prew approaches the bench
Maggio is stretched out on the bench, seems to be sleeping blissfully
He is clothed only in his shorts
Despite himself, Prew smiles
He shakes the reclining figure
Maggio, you nut
Get up
Wake up
83
Maggio mumbles without opening his eyes or moving
'm sorry, sir
won't do it again
Just don't lock me up, sir
Honest,  won't
Here's your clothes
He throws the clothes on Maggio
(opens his eyes) Well, give 'em back to the Indians
The Indians need clothes
All they wear is  strings
Boy, are you drunk
maybe a movie star comes outs the hotel right now and picks us up and takes us back to the States in her private plane
and installs us in her private swimming pool -- Prew pulls Maggio off the bench and starts to drag him across the path away from the light
() Take it easy, Prew
You scrapin my tail on the sandy sidewalk
You'll get worse than that scraped - - Listen
The ominous sound of leggins brushing each other is heard, not far away
Prew looks off
The two MPs are on the street just outside the grounds
They are still looking for Maggio, somewhat aimlessly now
Prew whispers to Maggio as he pulls him to his feet
Come on before you're in trouble -- 84
Maggio pushes him away
Stop it
Shut up
'm sick of its Can't a man get drunk
Can't a man do nothin
Can't a man put his lousy hands in his lousy pockets on a lousy street man gotta be hounded every minute of his life
ain't gain to take its  ain't no cowards  ain't yellows  ain't no bums  ain't no scum
MPs
MPs
() Now you done it
The two MPs came running onto the path, spot Maggio and Prew about thirty yards away
Maggio picks up his shoes, suddenly whips away from Prew and runs toward the MPs
MPs as they stop, surprised
Maggio is shouting, "Can't a man do nothin
" as he hurls first one shoe, then the other, directly at the MPs
One  is hit in the shoulder, staggers back
Maggio dashes between him and the second , but the latter reaches out and grabs him
Maggio wrenches loose but instead of running, suddenly wades in, arms swinging wildly
In a moment, he is hanging crab-like on the man's back
The first  charges Maggio
Maggio grabs the second 's club and hits the first  over the head
Horrified, he starts toward the fracas
MPs
The second  has managed to get out from under Maggio
He smashes his fist into Maggio's face as the latter continues to wield the club
Maggio sees Prew coming toward them
85
Get back
'm handlin this
Take off
The first  starts to intercept Prew
Maggio tackles him around the knees and brings him to the ground
Club gone, his partner on the ground, the second  fishes for his pistol, tugs to get it from the holster
' This ain't your affair
Keep out of this
MPs
Prew sees the second  raise his pistol, point it toward him
him as he turns quickly and dives headlong into bushes nearby
him close to ground as he knees and elbows his way along deep into the bushes
He stops, breathing hard
The sound of the MPs fighting with Maggio can be heard, the ugly sound of fists and the uglier sound of clubs smashing bone and flesh
' (screaming, crazed) Come on
Is that the best you can do
bet you eat Wheaties, don't you
Come on
You can't even knock me out -- no matter -- Maggio's voice stops suddenly
of Prew on the ground, his face contorted
The voices of the MPs are heard now, panting
' wonder what was wrong with this guy
He must be same kind of madman
' Come on, let"s get him into a wagon
convulsive sob escapes Prew as his head drops in the dirt
: 86
- Warden is pinning some notices on a bulletin board
Prew sits on the bench against the wall, miserable, elbows on knees, chin in hand
There is a quiet tenseness in the room
Warden looks over at Prew, turns back to the bulletin board
Mazzioli gets up from his desk, wanders aimlessly to a window
The screen door slams and Leva enters, eating a candy bar
Any word on Maggio's Court Martial
It's on right now
At Headquarters
Lava sits on the bench beside Prew, shakes his head
He'll get the Stockade sure
The others tense at the word "Stockade," glare at Leva as if he had no right to mention it
Their fear of the place, now that it is imminent even for another soldier, is shown on their faces
There is a long pause
Maybe he won't get it
All he did was get drunk and run wild
That's a soldier's nature
It's almost his sacred duty once in a while
There is another pause
Warden barks suddenly, fiercely, at Leva
What you hangin around here for
Can't a man rest himself for a min-- What man
can't stand to see people restin themselves
'm eccentric
If you ain't got no work maybe  can scare you up some
Mumbling, Leva rises and goes out
Warden goes over to Prew
Whyn't you go on over to the Day Room, shoot a little pool
() 87
(') 'll let you know when the word comes through
Prew looks up, nods, rises
He is half-way to the door when the phone at the Clerk's desk rings
Prew turns
Mazzioli stares at the phone as if afraid to touch it
Warden goes over, answers
( ) Compny , First Sergeant Warden speaking
Yes, sir
Yes, sir, will
'll have his things in order
Yes, sir
Warden puts down phone
He looks at the waiting men
He got it
Six months
: - Prew and a group of  Company men, including Sergeants Dhom, Thornhill and Henderson, are on the steps and porch as a Reconnaissance car pulls up and halts
Maggio sits between the driver and another , both armed
(: These are not the same MPs with whom he fought
) The Company men cluster around the car, ad-libbing greetings, kidding Maggio, bucking him up
Even the Sergeants join in this; nobody likes to see a man on his way to the Stockade
Hello, men
Who's got the beer
Shut up
Okay, Brownie
Whatever you say
as the Driver gets out of the car and goes to pick up Maggio's stacked barracks bag on the porch
Prew moves up close to Maggio
'm sorry, Angelo
It's my fault -- 88
You crazy
You -- shoulda stopped you somehow -- It was all my party
Don't worry about it
(pronounces "e" as in "") Anyhow, 'm gunna e-scape
If Gimbel's basement couldn't hold me, neither can no lousy Stockade
You heard him say
(smiles at the men) 'm a prisoner
And prisoners ain't allowed to talk
They allowed to breathe though
If they good, that is
During last speech the Driver returns, dumps the barracks bag in the car, and gets in
The motor starts
The men shout good- byes
heartsick as he looks at Maggio
as the Recon pulls out and Maggio's last hearty shout drifts back
' e-scape to Mexico and become a cowboy
: - as the Reconnaissance car drives through the chain-mesh gate
In the distance is the Stockade, a building that looks something like a country schoolhouse
Music sweeps up as the gate clangs shut
: 89
- Maggio walking across the yard flanked by the tall MPs
He looks around as if surveying the chances of escape
Music rises
: - as the MPs march Maggio up to a door and gesture him to enter alone
He goes in
- from behind a man seated at a desk
Prominent in shot is a wicked-looking chopped-off hoe handle lying on the desk
Maggio enters, recognizes the man
He walks, up to the desk, his face set in defiance
Music is rising in a fearful crescendo
just enough to  desk sign reading: "
" The man stands up and the music stops abruptly
Fatso Judson as the man, on his face the same murderous expression as at Choy's
He cracks his fingers
Tough monkey
his eyes following a movement of Fatso's hand
Eyes on Maggio, his hand gropes on the desk
Hard sister
' as it finds and tightens around the hoe handle
The music sweeps in abruptly
: -  () Music of preceding shot segues into an ancient, savage Hawaiian chant which continues through following
90
- - Shot covers the continuation of all the above activity
This is a native luau - definitely not for tourists
Shot includes long ditches, heated by red-hot stones and lined with layers of banana leaves, containing pig, chicken, rock crabs, fish
Pots of native stew
Bowls of exotic fruit
Peels of raw cane
Working over the food are the natives, many of the men stripped to the waist, the women arrayed in colorful Hawaiian costumes
group of male dancers swaying with the insistent beat of a group of old Hawaiian instruments
This is far removed from the night club Hula
This is a thing of swift, agile angularity, primitive and powerful
At end of ,   Warden and Karen in the group
They are the only whites in the group
her face lit by the flames
She watches the dancing breathlessly
The native instruments playing a thin, weird melody
The men laugh and grin as they dance, taunt and tease somebody o
s
They shout and laugh and squeal with delight as they watch
It is Warden the dancers are teasing
Several of the dancers break out of the group, dance over to Warden, continue to prod him, apparently urging him to join them
protesting, joining in the laughter
Suddenly he kicks off his shoes, rolls his slacks up to his knees
He snatches a gardenia from the hair of a pretty Hawaiian girl next to him, sticks it over his ear, jumps into the firelight and dances with the others
The music comes up louder and faster as the spectators and dancers roar
91
They are all laughing as they dance, but as Warden moves with them it is apparent he is as good as any of them
nodding, pointing at Warden, their hilarious laughter fading to delighted smiles
astonished and thrilled at Warden's ability
His laughter now also diminished to a happy grin as he dances
In all he dances about thirty seconds
Then he breaks out of the group and runs over to Karen
as the spectators and dancers shout their applause
Warden comes up to Karen and puts the gardenia in her hair
Karen is glowing, tingling
You just love to shock people, don't you
Where on earth did you learn to dance like that
( ) Believe it or not -- Chicago, Illinois
She flings her arms around him passionately
The onlookers howl with approval and merriment
Between Karen and Warden and camera, an enormously fat Hawaiian woman pours water on the stones in one of the trench-ovens
cloud of steam rises, hiding them
-  () a thousand feet into Palolo Valley
Bonfires and smoke rising from the floor of the valley
The thinnest carry of the ancient Hawaiian music from precipice and  Prew and Alma as they trudge into shot, climbing up the steep cliff road
holding hands as they walk
92
-- If  dint get to see you once in a while The Treatment would've cracked me long ago
Alma, fairly winded from the climb, smiles but doesn't answer
We could have taken a cab
Except ain't got cab fare
It's just around the bend
as they walk on around a bend in the road
' The small house is perched precariously on the very edge of the cliff
Alma and Prew come around the bend, come up to the door, Prew marvelling at the house
This other girl and  were lucky to rent it
() It's a very fashionable district
She hands Prew her key
As he is unlocking the door: 'll get an extra one made for you
Prew swings open the door and they go in
'    -  () Prew stops on the threshold, stares at the room in happy amazement
It is large, smartly furnished
In the rear, glass doors lead to a porch
One of the panelled walls is filled with bookshelves, floor to ceiling
The bookshelves are filled with books
hearty feminine voice calls "Hi
" from the kitchen, and as Prew and Alma come into the room, enters from the kitchen
She is a very tall, very gay, good-looking girl
This is Gorgette, my roommate
Gorgette, this is Prew
told you about him
93
Don't mind me
'm going out in a little while
Prew grins, can't keep his eyes off the astonishing books
Gorgette follows his glance
belong to the Book of the Month Club
always take every book
That way  get all the dividends
She giggles and goes off to the bedroom
She'll be great for Maggio when he gets out of the Stockade
He'll be crazy about her because she's so tall
Alma smiles, presses him into a chair
Now you just get comfortable and 'll make you a Martini and see what's to cook for dinner
She starts oft to kitchen
Hey
She turns
This is just like bein married, ain't it
(over her shoulder as she exits to kitchen) It's better
: - through smoke rising from one of the trench-ovens
As it clears we see the enormous Hawaiian woman and one or two others cleaning up and putting out the remnants of the fires
The merrymakers and dancers have gone; the luau is over
In b
g
, quite alone, are Warden and Karen, sitting on 94
the trunk of a fallen palm tree
The abandoned gaiety of the earlier scene gone
They survey the emptiness
The fat Hawaiian woman comes near, rakes ashes over one of the dying fires
She speaks to Warden in Hawaiian
He answers her in the native tongue
The fat woman stares, shrugs, goes off
What did she say
She said it's over -- time to go -- Home
beach, a car, a park
Warden puts his arm around her tenderly
It'll work out
It can't go on like this much longer, Milt
know
He rises, paces a moment
If there were only a way
Your lovin husband'd probly give you the divorce
But even if he didn't know what for, he'd never let me transfer
(bucking up courage; ) There is a way
've been thinking about it
Warden looks at her apprehensively
You've got to become an officer
What
95
You're eligible for the extension course that came in with the draft
When you get your commission they'd ship you back to the States -- new officers aren't kept at posts where they've been enlisted men
Then -- You sure made a thorough study of it
Then  could divorce Dana and follow you and marry you
An officer
've always hated officers
That's a fine, intelligent point of view
Suppose  said 've always hated Sergeants
That would make a lot of sense, wouldn't it
He sits, thinks it over unhappily
Okay, suppose  did it
-- And don't think it's a cinch -- the exams are tough
Then you'd be getting your divorce here while 'm in the States
We'd be apart maybe six months
We'll probly be in the war by then -- You can't be certain of that -- () Put it down on your calendar
On October twenty-third, 1941, Milt Warden told you we'd be in the war in less than a year
() Why don't you tell the truth
() 96
(') You just don't want the responsibility
You're probably not even in love with me -- You're crazy
wish  wasn't in love with you
Maybe could enjoy life again
don't know what's happened to you -- you were honest at first -- At first
You were tough and solid as a rock -- and now you're a whining crybaby -- He stops abruptly
And so they were married and lived unhappily ever after
They are silent for several moments
've never been so miserable in my life as  have since  met you
Neither have
() wouldn't trade a minute of it
() Neither would
Warden rises and paces again
Suddenly he stops, turns, looks down at Karen, speaks in the same gloomy tone
'll probably make the lousiest officer they ever saw in this Army
happy smile creeps over Karen's face
Despite himself, he begins to smile also
97
() You'll make a fine officer remarkable officer
: '  - The porch is at the rear of the house, leading off from the living room
It is on the very edge of the cliff
Prew and Alma are dancing to the music of a portable victrola
It is playing "Why Don't We Do This More Often
"  table still contains the dinner plates
Prew's expression holds the wonder of a child at a magic show
He misses a step, stumbles
never caught on to dancing much
You're a very good dancer
The record ends and Alma goes to change it Prew to the edge of the porch as he looks out over the view
' magnificent panorama -- strings of lights in the valley and across on St
Louis Heights -- in the far distance the neon of Waikiki
working with his thoughts, afraid to broach them
He lights a cigarette, his fingers trembling
been wanting to tell you a long time now -- ( ) love you
looking through records for a new choice
She speaks quite conversationally, as if offered a pleasant compliment
That's nice
Because  love you, too
She puts on a record -- "It All Comes Back To Me Now
" It plays throughout the sequence
98
as Alma comes over to Prew
mean it
need you
( ) 'm glad
Because  need you, too
() thirty-year man is movin all over, goin all the time
Up to now never thought a thirty-year man had any business to think of gettin married
She stares at him, amazed, a touch angry
You're a funny one, little Prew boy
() Yeah
Must be the altitude
very funny one that  cannot figure out
Why's it funny if a guy wants to marry you
Because 'm a girl you met at the New Congress Club
And that's about two steps up from the pavement
Okay -- 'm a private no class dogface soljer
And the way most civilians look at it, that's two steps up from no thin
There is a silence
Alma is honestly distraught
Oh, Prew, Prew,  thought we were happy: Why do you want to spoil things
99
Lissen,  ain't think in of now
But  got a plan cookin in my head
You want to go back to the States in a year
Well, you could stretch it some, make it two years
And could swing a Sergeant's stripes -- If  were a non-com the Army'd let me pick my duty when  re-enlist
(lost in the picture of ) And there's some posts back in the States -- like Jefferson Barracks -- The married noncoms rate solid brick houses
with lawns with new- cut grass and walks with big old oak trees
Now  know you've lost your mind
How do you expect to become a Sergeant under this Captain Holmes of yours
It's all you can do to keep out of the Stockade
could fight
It  go out for boxin he'd send me to non-com school
The Regimental Championship is next month
bet could win the middleweight even without training
used to be pretty good  could do it
Alma is deeply moved
She speaks gravely, sincerely, not at all immodestly
No
don't think you should give in to The Treatment
even to marry me
This'd be worth it
100
( ) Prew -- it's true we love each other now
But back in America, it might be different
We might not even want each other
Okay
But that ain't the real reason
All right
It's not
What's the real reason you won't marry me
won't marry you because  don't want to be the wife of a soldier
Well, that's the top  could ever do for you -- Because nobody's going to stop me from my plan
Nobody
Nothing
Because want to be proper
Proper
() Yes, proper
Respectable
Secure
In a year 'll have enough money saved
'm going back to my home town in Oregon and 'm going to build a new home for my mother and myself and join the country club and take up golf
And then 'll meet the proper, man with the proper position
And 'll be a proper wife who can keep a proper home and raise proper children
And will be happy because when you are proper you are safe
(bitterly disappointed but ) () 101
(') You got guts, Alma
hope you pull it off
The victrola record ends
Alma turns away from Prew and goes to the victrola
Now that shots had her say with such certainty, she deflates
Except for the fact that she looks like a girl who never cries, she looks as if she might cry
She lifts the record off the turntable
But  do mean it when  say  need you
Because 'm lonely
Sometimes 'm dreadfully lonely
You think 'm lying, don't you
No
Nobody ever lies about being lonely
Alma puts the same record on again
Prew looks out over the beautiful view
: : - -- 've known about it for a long time
've sensed it
And 'm not going to ignore it any longer want to know where you met him and just who he is
at breakfast in a nook off the kitchen
Holmes is a mixture of petulance, anger and frustration
He doesn't touch his food, but occasionally takes a sip of coffee
'm afraid 'm not going to tell you
You can't keep a thing like this & 'm not going to hide anything
'm just not going to tell you
102
She applies herself to her food, anxious to drop the matter
One thing  know
know it's a civilian
You'd be too discreet to pick an Army man
don't think it's any of your business who he is
It is my business
'm your husband
What do you think a scandal would do to my chances for a promotion
So if you're thinking of a divorce, you can forget it
Karen stiffens
She struggles to maintain her self- possession
She manages it, keeps outwardly calm through the scene
Now -- how does it feel to know you'll have to live with a horror like me the rest of your life
Not very nice
But then there's the compensation of knowing you'll have to live with me the rest of your life
Her attitude makes Holmes progressively sorrier for himself
with him as during following he rises, goes to stove, pours himself another cup of coffee
He spills a little and the liquid sizzles on the burner
You don't know how a man feels about a thing like this
It breaks a man all up -- inside
() gander why men feel so differently about it than women
It's -- it's just not the same
with him as he returns to the table, decides to try another tack
103
Why do you think 've done all have
Done all what
Tried to be a Company Commander when  hate it, worked my fool head off with this miserable boxing squad, tagged after the General whenever  could
don't know
Why
Why, for you and for me
For our home, that's why
() always thought you did it because you wanted to get ahead
She finishes the last of her food, stands
It's a lovely day out
think 'll go for a walk
Holmes catches her wrist, stops her
'm willing to forgive you
Tell me who he is
Make a clean breast of it
And 'll forgive you
wonder which is hurt more -- your pride or your curiosity
She disengages her wrist
() When 'm ready to ask you for a divorce we can discuss it again
She goes to door to pantry, pauses there
104
() And do eat your breakfast, Dana
It's getting cold
She goes out to pantry
We hear the sound of the door to rear porch opening and closing
wretched, completely at a loss
He stares into space, then looks down at his food, picks up a fork and ruefully begins to eat
: - Prew, on hands and knees, is on a weeding detail with three other men, one of them Sal Anderson
Another is  , a tousle-headed, sentimental man we have not seen before
Sergeant Thornhill, in charge of the detail, lolls on the ground, his head propped against a tree, reading a comic book
Prew works his way over to Nair
You just get out of the Stockade
() It was rugged, sam
But  kept my mouth shut and watched my step and wasn't in no trouble
You see Maggio
Nair nods, tells his tale in half-humorous, half-reverent fashion
Fatso's workin him over with a hoe handle
Places where it won't show mostly
You know, the back and the chest
The kidneys
Once in a while in the face
Know what Maggio does when that happens
Spits in Fatso's eye
() Oh, he's a hot one
Ain't he a hot one
105
He's a good boy
Course, he throws up a little blood now and then
And he passes out a lot
But Fatso sure ain't reportin none of that
So there's no way they goin to find out
Why don't he go to the
We tried to get him to
But he won't peep
He says he got a lot more scalp to lose first
That boy is about the hardest artery in the hospital
(with great sentiment) But he's got a heart just like a great big baby
Prew's face has been growing in fury
He pulls up a clump of sod, throws it down with all his might
You think he's gonna be all right
Your guess is worth mine, sam
Maybe he's crackin a little at that -- cause after Fatso put him in the Hole -- that's what they call solitary -- a couple times he began talkin about how he's gonna e- scape
He said to tell you he'll look you up one of these nights
shadow falls across the grass in front of Prew
' from near the ground, the Galavitch's ungainly, ape-like figure
He looks down at Prew, full of venom
Still on knees, eh, Prewitt
Well, boxing finals next month
December f if teen
You s till got time help us make champions
' 106
Prew is at the breaking point
Controlling himself, he weeds around Galovitch's shadow
It moves in front of Prew again
' Are proud dis Compny to be or not
Bites de hand dat feeds it der shoot dogs for
Infortunately, ony dogs day are allowed to shoot, not men
The other men have stopped weeding, are looking over at Prew and Galovitch
Thornhill, in b
g
, puts down the comic book and comes over to them during following
Get outa my way, Ike
ain't gonna move around you again
You need better lesson than up to now
Maybe  give to you myself
Maybe right now
He steps on Prew's hand
As Prew jerks away from the heavy shoe Galovitch hauls him up by his fatigue shirt
Thornhill steps between them
( ) Ey, leave him alone
`e's in my -- Prew shoves Thornhill aside, cold decision in his eyes
He starts unbuttoning his shirt
( ) All right
It's gonna be your way
Galovitch rips off his shirt, bursting some of the buttons as he does
Stripped to the waist, his whole appearance seems to change; he looks as he did in the ring, a hard-muscled prize fighter
Ey, wait a minute, you guys --
Prew is barely able to get out of his shirt before Galovitch charges him
During following men run from across the quadrangle and from out of the barracks to watch the affair, form a circle around 107
the fighters
Prew is a skillful boxer, moving around Galovitch quickly and cleverly
Galovitch is more lumbering but not awkward
His heavy blows stagger Prew several times
Prew drives his attack at his opponent's body
He never throws a punch at the other's head
The head, Prew
Hit him in the head
The other men around shout similar advice
puzzled by Prew's concentration on his body and by the shouts of the men
He seems to be wondering if Prew is pulling a trick
fear, not born of cowardice, is reflected on Prew's face as he sets himself, stares at Galovitch
He seems haunted by the memory of Dixie Wells
' flinching without being hit
He seems mesmerized by the other's eyes
' fighting
Galovitch draws blood from a cut over Prew's eye
He is getting the better of the battle
In b
g
Thornhill breaks out of the crowd and runs across the quadrangle
don't get it -- Why don't Prew go for the head
He blinded a guy once
Must be scairt of the same thing
as Galovitch batters Prew back against the crowd
right to the temple sends him to his knees
He shakes his head a moment, gets up and goes into a clinch
The windows are crowded with men watching the fight
108
- To heads of men watching, out to Prew and Galovitch on the ground
Dispassionate, professional ad-libs from the men: why does Prew continue his attack to the body only, a good little man and a good big man, etc
'  - Warden is at his desk filling out an application blank
Holmes is glancing over his shoulder
: Warden's hand in shot filling out answers to sex, age, race, etc
' 'll be glad to recommend you, Warden
You've got service, experience, grade
You'll make an excellent officer
: Holmes waits for thanks
( ) Thank you, sir
The screen door in the Orderly Room bangs
Thornhill runs into the office, breathless
He comes to a shaking attention as he sees Holmes
At ease, Sergeant
What's the matter
They fightin on the green, sir
Galovitch and Prewitt
Ike looks like `e goin to murder him, sir
pleased look crosses Holmes' face
Warden jumps up, starts for door
Holmes catches his arm
109
There's no rush
'll take care of it
Holmes goes out
Thornhill follows, turns at the door
Ain't you want to see it, First
( ) No
ain't want to see it
Nor you either
Get out of here
Thornhill goes
The screen door in the Orderly Room bangs
Warden walks to his desk, stares down at the application form, picks it up
He carries it over to Holmes' desk
He looks at the picture of Karen on the desk
He stares at the picture, then looks at the application blank
Then he looks down at the chevrons on his arm
He rubs his hand over the chevrons gently, fondly
He looks at the application blank again very thoughtfully
- continuation of the fight
Prew is tiring, his face is cut and bleeding and there is a welt under one eye
Galovitch is unmarked but grunting now from Prew's constant jabs at his stomach
He seems perplexed, as before, by his opponent+s tactics
the non-"ath-a-leets" of  Company, including Anderson, Clark and Treadwell
Ad-libbed shouts of "In the face, Prew
In the face
" the "ath-a-loots," including Dhom, Wilson and Henderson
They are watching quietly, nodding with approval as Prew feints, then darts several punches into Galovitch's ribs, It almost seems as if they are admiring Prew's courage, inwardly rooting for him
Holmes enters the group, Thornhill tagging after him
Holmes stops and watches the fight
There is a look of satisfaction on his face
The fight continuing
110
near rear of crowd
An officer, walking across the lawn, is attracted by the noise
He steps into the crowd
This is He wears the insignia of the Inspector General's Department
He watches the fight, is about to step through to break it up when he sees Holmes
He stops, watches Holmes' reactions
Prew, backed up against the crowd, trips over somebody's feet
He falls without being hit
Galovitch kicks at him and Prew rolls away
The crowd murmurs angrily
Sergeant Stark steps out into the open circle, faces Galovitch
This ain't no rassle, Ike
You got to fight this man fair
Approving shouts from the crowd
Stark steps back
Ike waits for Prew to get up
looking up at Galovitch
' ' His eyes narrow, harden as if his inner struggle has been resolved
Prew gets to his feet
As Galovitch comes to him, Prew feints for the stomach, then throws a hard right to Galovitch's face
It hits him flush on the nose
Blood spurts
The crowd roars
Galovitch, surprised and hurt, throws up his hands
Prew drives both fists to his solar plexus
Galovitch drops his guard
Prew smashes him in the face and Adam's apple
Galovitch falls to his knees, hawking and choking
The whole nature of the fight has changed
Galovitch, hurt and reeling, rushes Prew, bull-like, head down, defense wide open
Prew dodges easily, slamming hard with rights and lefts to the head
Holmes, seeing Prew is now clearly in command, steps out of the crowd and up to the two fighters
111
() All right
Let's cut it
There is a look of relief on the faces of both Galovitch and Prew as they stop fighting
What started this
() Prewitt talk back to non-com
Refuse order  give him, start fight
teach him lesson
laugh from the crowd
You won't disobey any more orders in my Company, Prewitt
Warden saved you from a court martial once but he won't this time -- Anderson steps into the circle
Sir -- 'm sorry, sir but Private Prewitt's not to blame for this
Sergeant Galovitch started it
Holmes reacts, momentarily at a loss
He turns to Thornhill
() Thornhill, you're in charge of this detail
How about it
Thornhill steps into the circle, nods toward Anderson
`e's right, sir
(points to Galovitch) `e begun it
Prewitt done nothin
From the crowd step Sergeants Dhom, Wilson and Henderson
They face Holmes and Galovitch implacably
No, sir, this wasn't Prewitt's fault
112
That's right, sir
Everybody knows Galovitch started it
Wilson nods
There is a murmur of agreement from the crowd
Holmes looks at his fighters, rocked by this betrayal
They stare back at him
Still near the rear of the crowd, he watches the scene with much interest
Holmes pulls himself together, turns to the crowd
That's all
Break it off
Let's get back to our jobs
(to Prew and Galovitch; ) 'm giving you two a break
'll ignore this
He walks off
He does not see Colonel Williams
Galovitch moves off toward the barracks
Wilson, Henderson and Thornhill remain grouped around Prew
You guys figure this means 'm steppin into a ring, you're wrong
It's your show, kid
Run it the way you want
You better put same iodine on them cuts
Yeah
An come over to Choy's tonight
We buy you a beer
The non-coms walk off, Prew stares after them
: ' - Sounds of gaiety from the beerhouse mingle with the mournful twang of guitars being played by Clark and Anderson toward the trio until the beerhouse noises are 113
low
The men are surrounded by many empty beer bottles
, ( ) Woke up sick on Thursday Feelin like my head took a dare Looked down at my trousers All my pockets was bare That girl sure was bad news Re-enlistment Blues
The guitars finish the stanza with a flourish as on
The men chuckle
Some day 'm goin back to Scranton and play it for my folks
And tell em it wan composed in the Hawaiian Islands
Clear across the Pacific Ocean
(finishes long swig of ) Hey, Friday
Yeah
Why you called Friday
Don't know
was borned on Wednesday
(plucks guitar, sings) Went back around on Friday Asked for a free glass of beer
The three laugh, sing in unison
, My friends had disappeared Barman said, `Take off, no credit here'
' The music from across the road almost lost in the laughter and shouts from the beerhouse
Warden comes out, wobbles a bit
He has One On
He cups his hand over his ear, straining to hear the singing
He stumbles into Choate, coming along the sidewalk
114
Top, you sure plastered
( ) am off duty
Off duty if  want to get plastered -- But Choate has gone into Choy's
with Warden as he wanders to the road, still trying to locate the singing
Half-way across the road he unceremoniously sits down, crosses his knees Buddha-wise
Here the singing is more audible
He listens contentedly
, () Ain't no time to lose Re-enlistment Blues
Anderson, as usual, finishes the stanza with a brilliant display on the guitar
Prew stands up
In the glow of a streetlight his face shows the marks of his battle with Galovitch
He wobbles and we realize he, too, really Has One On
Where you go in
Back to Choy's
Get nother drink
The guitars and singing continues in b
g
through following
with Prew as he weaves to the road
as Prew crosses
He can see the seated figure but the light from the street is too dim to identify it
' () Halt
Prew stops automatically
' Who goes there
friend
115
' Advance, friend, and be reconized
Prew moves closer,   him, until he recognizes Warden
(roaring, laughing) Quiet
At ease
Fall out
Right dress
`bout face
Hit the track
Garbage Detail
Latrine Detail
Dis a drill, not picnic
Hello, kid
Whatever you doin out all by yourself
'm goin to get a drink
Siddown
got a bottle
He pulls a bottle of whisky from his field jacket, holds it up to Prew
Prew takes the bottle and drinks
Then he sits down in the road as matter-of-factly as did Warden
He gives the bottle back to Warden
hand it to you, kid
They called off The Treatment this afternoon
When you beat up Ike
never heard of no soljer before ever lickin The Treatment
(drinks; then holds out ) Here, old buddy
Have a lil drink
Prew drinks
This is a terrible crummy life, you know it
Miserble
Perfeckly miserble
What if a truck or somethin was to come along and run over us
Awful
Awful
We'd be dead, wouldn't we
116
( ) An nobody to even mourn
You better not sit here any more
You better get up and move over to the side of the road
What about you
You got more to live for than me
You got to take care of your Compny
'm old
Don't matter if  die
But your life's ahead of you
You get up
No, sir
Never deserted a friend in need
'll stay to the bitter end
(shakes head stubbornly) We'll stay together
They square their shoulders heroically
(as if to an invisible ) No blindfold
Save it to wipe your nose on, you skunk
Amen
Each takes a drink
Prew,  got the biggest troubles in the whole world
The whole world
() Take love
Did you personally ever see any of this love
Prew nods gravely
117
You'll unerstan, then
This girl, see, she wants me to become
Become what
(after long hesitation) An officer
Can you see me as an officer
Sure  can see it
You'd make a good officer
You both can see more'n  can
You know what, Prew
'm scared become an officer
You ain't scared of nothin, Warden
Yes,  am
tell myself diffrnt but it's a fack
Where'd  be as an officer
How could  handle him
That's the one thing 'm scared of
be an officer in the Army
() Army of the
man should be what he can do
Warden nods solemnly as if Prew has uttered a great truth
They pass the bottle once more
How's your girl
Wha'st that name again
() Lorene
Oh, yeah,  remember
Lorene
Beautiful name
118
Warden claps Prew on the shoulder as if he is a lifelong friend
They smile
They look as if they are sharing a great secret, a secret known to them alone in the world
The mournful guitars and singing comes over a little louder
The headlights of a jeep descend upon Warden and Prew
Then the vehicle skids into the shot with a screeching of brakes, comes to a halt directly in front of the men
Warden and Prew look at the car calmly, don't move
The headlights are blazing on them
Stark hops out from the driver's seat, furious
Whatsa matter with you, you crazy, dumb screwballs
You tryin to get killed
What you doin with that jeep, Sergeant Stark
borrowed it
'm goin to town
What you doin in the middle of the road
The music of the guitars has stopped
There is a strange whine now, far in the distance, not identifiable
It grows during following
My friend Prew and  sittin here discussin the weather
Your friend, huh
You beard me
said my buddy Warden
My good friend Warden that you better not run over is what said
( ) Don't you know you got to look out for this man
Get him off the road before you run him over
He's the best stinkin soljer in the Compny
119
You both must be plumb nuts
You heard me
Get this man to some safety
Why, he's the best stinkin soljer in the Compny
guess 'm the one who's nuts
as he stumbles around the side of the jeep directly into the blaze of the headlights
There are scars, new and healing on Maggio's face
One of his ears is cauliflowered, enough to give him the lopsided ribald look of a punchy
couple of teeth are missing
Weirdly outlined in the glare, he is a nightmare figure, an apparition
The whine in the distance is identifiable now
It is the siren of the Stockade
figgered you might be at Choy's
The men gape at Maggio, unable to accept the shock of his appearance
Then Prew and Warden jump up and catch him as he is about to fall
The drunkenness drains out of them
Stark watches in bewilderment
(spewing words out) done it like  said
e- scape
e-scape like  figgered
Under a tarp inna back of a truck from the Motor Pool they rode me right out just like  figgered like said
Ony the tailgate came down 'bout a mile back
an  fell inns road
() shoulda seen me bounce
musta broke somethin
(clutches Prew's shirt) Prew
lissen
Angelo
Warden steps back as Prew holds Maggio
During following Anderson and Clark come over, watch pop-eyed
120
Fatso
Fatso done it to me
yestiday he did it for keeps
He likes to whack me in the gut with a hoe handle an then he asks `that hurt
' and then  spit at him
Ony yestiday he done it ten times runnin an somethin bust
you know, like they was a fish swiminin aroun inside you
( ) Come on, let's get him to the hospital
Maggio grasps him tighter
He is crying now
Prew
they gonna send you to the Stockade
No, Angelo -- () Should they do, watch out for Fatso
You gotta make like it's a game
He'll try to crack you but you ain't gonna crack
He's gonna see you but he'll never see you saw
`n' when he puts you in the Hole you just lay there `n' be still
`at's the ony way -- be still
`n' remember things
but not people
Not people
Things like nature
woods you been in
trees is awys good
He goes limp in Prew's arms, slides to the road
Warden bends over Maggio
The others watch, scared
staring down at Maggio
Warden looks up
121
He's dead
Dead
But he was here just a minute ago
Prew bends over, picks up Maggio, holds him in his arms gently, unbelieving
Fatso's lucky
They'll figure he got killed fallin out of that truck
He ain't dead
of Prew as he carries Maggio to the jeep, the others following
He lifts Maggio into the rear of,the jeep
Warden puts his hand on Prew's arm
He's dead, Prew
Prew stares at Maggio, lying in the jeep
Stark gets into the front of the jeep
'll take him, Prew
He starts the motor
Prew leans over, moves Maggio's body a little
( ) See his head don't bump
The jeep drives off
: - Framed beautifully in the moonlight, the Quadrangle and Barracks area look like a college campus
Silence
No movement
figure can be seen far in b
g, at the Bugler's post beside the megaphone
Another figure stands near him
The silence continues, then is broken by the sound of the bugle beginning 122
Taps
The first note is incredibly clear and loud and certain
It is held longer than most Buglers hold it
The second note is daringly short, abrupt
The last note of the first phrase rises, peals out, heartfelt
Two men come into the shot, smoking
They stop, turn toward the Bugler, listen attentively
One of them flips away his cigarette
The Taps continues through the following
- Most of the men turn in their beds toward the sound of the bugle
Some prop up on their elbows
as he listens
look of mingled longing and satisfaction
listening
strange look of pride
listening, his face also betraying emotions normally concealed
listening
Their bunks are next to each other
(a reverent whisper) bet you it's Prewitt
- Three men come out of the barracks, lean over the porch rail, listening
Their faces are thoughtful, sad
'  - The office lit only by a light over his desk
He is working late, a sheaf of papers spread out before him
He listens to the bugle call, moved, sorrowful
He snaps off the light, listens in the darkness
- at the Bugler's post
He is finishing the last phrases, full and wonderful
Behind him stands Friday Clark, motionless
The final note quivers to silence
Prew swings the megaphone for the repeat
Then the repeat begins, the clear proud notes reverberating across the silent quadrangle
123
'     - lying on his back in his bunk, arms clasped behind his head
He listens, his gnarled face the picture of the old soldier
He breathes heavily as if he is hearing his own requiem and epitaph
- There are eight or nine men here now, listening
There is a choked kinship on all the faces
- More men are propped on their elbows, their heads turned toward the Bugler
The dim figure of Treadwell can be seen, at a window now
(almost inaudible whisper) told you it was Prewitt
- continuing the Taps
There are tears in his eyes now
- half dozen men are sitting on the steps, listening, among them Stark and Wilson
Stark shakes his head sadly
- listening now on the porch alongside the street
- Several groups of two and three scattered about
They are standing in no particular places, as if they have been walking and stopped suddenly
They are all looking toward the Bugler
124
- as the Taps repeat is drawing to a close
He is lying on his side, turned toward the Bugler, a look of serenity, of peace on his face
His eyes close as he falls asleep
- coming to the end of the Taps
to a
Prew's face is wet with tears
His lips are pinched and red
He blows the final notes
Prew lowers the bugle slowly and lets the megaphone rest in its swivel
He withdraws the mouthpiece, puts it in his pocket
He hands the bugle to Clark
Clark looks at the instrument as if it has become hallowed
Prew walks off into the darkness
: - along street, passing a lone pedestrian
It the sign   ,  beside an open window through which is heard the sound of harsh piano playing; the pounding style and lack of shading are clearly Fatso Judson's
Prew, leaning against the building
He is watching the entrance to the Club patiently
There is relentless hatred on his face
The music stops
Prew does not move
: - Hearty male laughter from within
The door opens and Fatso and a couple of sailors cane out
They are about to start down the street
' Hello, Fatso
Fatso looks around in direction of voice
, Prew, still leaning against the building
Fatso squints, not recognizing him
125
You want me
Yeah, Fatso
Fatso takes a couple of steps toward Prew, squints again
don't like that nickname
You want to see me about somethin
Yeah
Let's step around the corner here where we can talk
Prew's voice is so toneless as to be ominous
() Okay
Good night, gents
The sailors go off
Fatso walks into the darkness of an alley next to the building
Prew follows
- Just enough light from the street lamp to illuminate about ten feet into the alley
Okay
You sore about somethin
No
just don't like the way you play the piano
Fatso throws back his head and laughs loudly
You know Maggio
The little Wop
The one who bust out of the Stockade
Sure
He was a real tough monkey
But crazy, see
You killed him
Did
If  did, he ask for it
126
hear they're gonna court martial you, Fatso
But before the Army gets you,  want a piece of you myself
There is the snick of a blade snapping open as Fatso pulls a knife
He moves toward Prew, who steps swiftly to one side
kinds thought you'd try that
There is the same sound as Prew pulls a knife from his pocket, snaps it open, holds it out flat in his hand, showing it to Fatso
This here's the one you pulled on Maggio once
Reconize it
Fatso darts at Prew, knife raised
Prew moves back, but Fatso is on him and they both roll to one side along the building
The movement throws them deep into the shadows
The two figures feint and dart
There is the occasional silver flash of the knives as light hits them
The men go deeper into the shadows, are all but lost to view
There is a startled, pained cry
Then one of the figures falls to his knees and starts to crawl toward camera
as the figure comes directly to camera,  the anguished face of Fatso
It slowly turns, is upside down in the frame
Fatso is on his back, his stomach gushing bloods his eyes already glazing
Prew staggers into the light now
His left side has two vicious cuts; he is bleeding badly
He stares down at Fatso, who manages a small, reproving voice
You've killed me
Why'd you want to kill me
Prew backs away from Fatso, turns, staggers down the alley away from camera
: 127
- Prew comes toward camera, laboriously struggling up the road
His side is hemorrhaging steadily, his shirt and trousers blood-soaked
He stops close to camera
He wads his handkerchief, sticks it inside his shirt near the knife wound
He smiles wearily, crookedly
(mumbles to himself) Gonna have an awful bad scar there
He lights a cigarette, his fingers shaking
The flame from the match illuminates his left wrist
There is a deep scar on it
It seems to fascinate Prew as he stares at it, rubs his fingers across it
scars
He turns, moves on up the road;    behind him, as if overhearing his thoughts which come over on sound track
'  (
) got that one fallin off the barn back home
gashed it on a spike
Dad laughed
Dead now
Uncle John+s dead, too
Prew moves away from camera out of shot
: - Prew, as he keeps in shadows, moves slowly up the cliff
He is in much pain now
His hand rubs across his face; his fingers linger on his forehead near his eye
'  (
) that cut over the eye
in the ring at Myer
wouldn't let `em stop it
knocked the guy out
sixth round
Prew again as he stumbles into shadows
: 128
- - Prew, who is now fighting hard to keep his feet
His hand is pressed tight to his side
'  (
) ten stitch gash in the hip
workin in the gym attic
fell through the skylight
where was that
so many scars
so many years
where they all gone to anyway
He moves on around bend in road out of shot
: '    - The radio is blaring the "Hut Sut Song
" Alma is crocheting
Gorgette is reading
across them to the front door
The doorknob moves slowly, the door opens
Prew falls into the room and pitches to the floor
-- She rushes to him, bends over him
Gorgette runs to the radio, turns it off
Her face agonized as she leans over Prew
Prew
He pushes himself up on one elbow, seems pleased by her stricken expression
He manages a smile
() Don't worry
Ain't gonna die
They savin me for better things
Gorgette kneels into shot
Prew's smile becomes silly as he turns his head to her
129
just came up to borrow a good book
: '  - The American flag, the General's flag and the Division flag are the only colorful elements in a rather severe office
Colonel Williams is reading from a typed report
--- In addition to inefficiency in administering his command and neglect of duty, Captain Holmes has been guilty of indefensible cruelty to the aforesaid Private Prewitt
This extended to instigating and encouraging wholly unauthorized and discreditable tactics to force the soldier to join the inter-regiment boxing team
These findings are the result of personal investigation by the Inspector General and are corroborated by numerous members of Company
Colonel Williams puts his report on the General's desk
Holmes' face reflects a weary resignation as if underneath he has really expected something like this for a long time
He makes no move to speak
The General is angry clear through
'm waiting for your reply to this
haven't any, sir
The charges -- are true
Holmes, the first thing  ever learned in the Army was that an officer takes care of his men
It seems to be the first thing you forgot
It's monstrous to think of anybody like you in command of troops
And believe me, you won't be for long
My only regret is that we have to keep you in uniform until a court martial is concluded
() 130
(cont'd) In the meantime, of course, 'm relieving you of your present duties
He indicates the meeting is over
Holmes rises, is about to leave, pauses
If there were any way to avoid a court martial, sir
Any way
The General frowns, is unresponsive
Holmes looks to Colonel Williams helplessly
There is one alternative, General
if you're so disposed resignation for the good of the service under  600-275
(thinks a moment) 'll give you a chance you don't deserve, Holmes
Write a letter of resignation and have it on my desk this afternoon
'll consider accepting it
Only because as far as 'm concerned, the quicker you're out of the Army the better for everybody
Especially the Army
: '  - He confronts her, waving a sheet of stationery
His voice is strangled, almost hysterical
--- that's right, it's a letter of resignations 'm through
've already been relieved
So you can begin packing
We're sailing for the States next week
She shakes her head, not wanting to believe; she takes the letter out of his hand, starts to read it
She stops after a sentence or two
Her hand falls to her side
Holmes sits on the bed heavily
The bluster bleeds out of him
He shakes his head, emotionally bewildered
For perhaps the first time in his life he is nakedly honest
131
Where has it gone, Karen
What happened to it
The gay, cheerful life we were going to have, you and What happened to me
The proud, dashing officer was going to be
The leader of men
've known all along how the men felt about me
They despised me
What's happened
don't remember losing anything
Where has it all gone
reacting; she is surprised, a little afraid of her own emotion
The outcry, so lost, so despairing, moves her
She is sorry for him
Karen -- you're coming back with me, aren't you
Trembling, Karen puts the letter on the dressing table
Abruptly, she runs out of the room
: '  - placard reading
We hear Ross' first few words over this, then    to Ross is forceful, clean-cut, gives the impression of toughness but fairness
As he talks he takes down the photographs of prize fighters and prize fighting from the wall
Watching and listening are Sergeants Dhom, Thornhill, Henderson, Leva, Stark and Karelsen and Corporal Wilson
Ross is such a complete switch from Holmes that the men are almost unnerved by him
But a definite respect is reflected in their expressions
Warden, beside his desk, shares this
--  don't intend to have a sloppy outfit
don't intend to have a goldbrick outfit
don't intend to have a soft soap outfit
've called you noncoms in because you're the backbone of any Company
() 132
(') From now on you'll have to prove you're entitled to have those stripes here
And not in the boxing ring
He bands the pictures to Leva
Get rid of these, Sergeant
Yes, sir
That's all  have to say
If you've any questions, speak up
Nobody speaks
Dismissed
The men troop out, passing camera
As last man leaves, Warden
He is looking at Ross with considerable approval, even admiration
He resumes a more normal expression as Ross turns toward him
One non-com was missing, sir
Sergeant Galovitch
know
Private Galovitch is in the kitchen
In the kitchen
As of now, he's an assistant cook
busted him
On a blanket charge of inefficiency
What are you grinning at
() think the Company Commander made a wise decision, sir
The phone rings
Warden goes to his desk, answers
133
( ) Compny , First Sergeant Warden speaking
Karen's voice is heard on the phone; we cannot understand what she is saying, but a flood of words pours through
With Ross looking on, Warden is embarrassed
( ) Yes
Yes,  know
(glances over toward Ross) Yes, the - uh - parcel has already arrived
Yes
What
( ) No
No, we'll have to talk about it soon
Right away
-  don't know
Ross perceives Warden's distress
He starts toward the door
Warden nods gratefully
Ross smiles, leaves the room
( ) Lissen, 'll get away somehow, tonight
'll meet you in Kuhio Park
At eight
Right
He puts down the receiver
He stares at the desk
Then he slowly pulls out the top drawer
The Officers Application Blank is lying on top of a pile of other papers
He takes it out, looks at it somberly
to an  of the Application
We see Warden's answers to sex, age, race, etc
the page to the place for the signature of the applicant
It is unsigned
: - In b

Warden, in uniform, and Karen are sitting on the same bench as in their first meeting in the park
We cannot hear what they are saying at first
past a few pedestrians and  on a
There is a defeated, tired look about them, as if they have been talking for a long time to no avail
guess  felt it that night asked you to become an officer
When you didn't say yes right away
() 134
(') guess  knew deep down you wouldn't do it
But -- (a hint of tears) It seemed such a simple plan for us
wanted to --  tried -- but couldn't
He runs his hand through his hair
He seems to be groping inside himself for some way to explain
Lissen -- there's a kid in our outfit named Prewitt
Robert
Lee Prewitt
He came in from the States about a year ago
thought he was a fresh punk at first
until  got to know him a little
He's  right now -- probly in some kind of real trouble -- he ain't the kind to go otherwise
Anyway,  keep remembering somethin he said to me the first day he came in
He said a man has got to go his own way
if he don't, he's nothin
'm an Enlisted Man
'm a First Sergeant
Milt Warden
Once  cross that line and tried to be an officer, 'm somebody  don't know
stranger
And a man has got to be what he is
guess that's the trouble with Dana
He's always tried to be something he isn't
Poor Dana don't think he ever needed me until now
(shaken herself out of it) Well, here we are saying goodbye
And talking about two other people
We're not saying good-bye -- we'll figger out a way for you to stay -- 'm going back with him, Milt
There's something in being needed
It isn't love
But it's something
135
() Lissen, two people who love each other just don't stop loving each other
Nothin and nobody is goin to break us up l 1111 transfer out somehow and get back to the States
Maybe it'll take a little time but 'll do it
() That sounds like Milt Warden, all right
He bends toward her to kiss her
She presses him back
No, Milt
don't want to kiss you any more
just want to remember you
And you to remember me
Put it down
Put it down that on December 6th, 1941, Milton Anthony Warden told you he'd remember you

They begin to talk again, quietly, undemonstratively
We are too far away now to hear what they are saying

g
Prew is disheveled and slovenly, needs a shave badly
His face is lined with pain
He is drunk from several days of steady drinking, stone drunk, as if in a trance
He wears crumpled civilian clothes
He is at a table laboriously writing out the Re-enlistment Blues
He finishes writing a stanza and sings softly
Slep in the park that Sunday Seen all the folks gain to church Your belly feel so empty When you're left in the lurch -- Alma looks up from the paper
136
Here it is -- they're putting it on an inside page already

still no clue in the fatal stabbing of Staff Sergeant James
Judson
' Prew, who has stopped singing but not turned his head, resumes the song
Dog soljers don't own pews Re-enlistment Blues
() Did you hear me
Are you listening or not
Prew nods blankly
He rises slowly and walks across the room toward Alma
But his eyes are fixed on a whisky bottle on a table beside her
He moves stiffly, favoring his side, his face contorted
He picks up the bottle, pours himself a drink
() Are you trying to set a new world's record
He smiles faintly, holds the glass high
Yeah
To the memory of Robert
Lee Prewitt, Holder of the New World's Record

And all you've done since you fell in here is drink and drink and drink and try to remember that old song of yours
And  want to know what you're going to do
Prew looks at her, hurt
He moves back to his table, mumbling
might ship out on a tramp and go to Mexico and be a cowboy
Oh, be sensible
Prew sits at the table again, continues to mumble
'm goin back to the Compny
soon's my side heals
Goin back under my own power
Goin into the Ordrly Room 'n' say hello, Warden, Private Prewitt reportin
() Oh, Prew
Prew
Why did you have to do it
Why did you have to kill that man
Prew shakes his head sadly as if he doesn't know the answer
He picks up the paper he has been writing on, sings softly, testing the last couple of lines affectionately
Recruitin crews give me the blues Old Re-enlistment Blues

- clock on wall reading 7:52
About half the Company is at breakfast
There is considerable laughter and horseplay
Near the kitchen a dozen men are in the chow line
Warden at the  table
He rises, carries his plate with him towards the chow line
sudden, deep-toned, earthquake-like blast shudders through the room
The cups on the tables rattle
Warden stops, cocks his head
The men stop eating, look at each other
(to the room) Must be dynamitin down to Wheeler Field
Them engineers mighty ambitious Sunday mornin before eight o'clock
The men resume eating
Warden moves a couple of steps toward the chow line when the second blast hits
It is much heavier and fuller
He has a hunch about this now
He reaches out to put his plate down, holding it very carefully in both hands
However, he doesn't bother to see if there is anything under it
The plate falls and crashes on the floor a fraction of a second before the third groundswell of blast shakes the room
- man sprints toward the mess hall, yelling to right and left at the top of his lungs
As he approaches camera we see it is Mazzioli
The Japs're bombing Wheeler Field
It's the Japs
They're bombing Wheeler Field
The Japs
It's the Japs
saw the red circles on the wings
The roar of the plane over shot
The figure of Mazzioli gets closer and closer as the plane 139
dives toward him, machine guns spitting
as the Jap plane flashes by close above him
The stones in the pavement pop up
Mazzioli flops on the street
The plane zooms
as the men rush out
In the front ranks are Warden, Karelsen, Stark and Choate, Choate carries his half-filled plate in one hand, a mug of coffee in the other
The men stretch their necks, following the plane

g, a column of black mushrooming to the sky
Warden dashes to Mazzioli to a   as Warden bends over him, hoists him to a sitting position
He is extremely gentle
Mazzioli's knee is laid open and is bleeding freely
Warden whips out a handkerchief and starts to apply a tourniquet
Some of the men continue to crane at the sky
few pick up metal links from the Jap bullets
Say
This'll make me a good souvenir
bullet from a Jap plane
This ain't jawbone
This is for record
Theme real bullets that guy was usin
Get inside -- all of ya
Warden gets Mazzioli to his feet, turns to first man in group surrounding them
It is Anderson
Help him over to the hospital
Anderson starts Mazzioli down the street
pair of planes are diving toward the street
' The men rush for cover, all except Choate who is left alone in shot
He takes a big bite of his sausage and eggs, hastily downs a swig of coffee
Then he throws the plate and cup into the street and dives for cover as the terrifyingly loud noise of the Jap planes indicates they are directly overhead
140
- The men are pouring in from the Company street, all shouting at once
Warden pushes his way through them and jumps up on the pool table
His big voice booms
All right, all right, you men
Quiet down
Quiet down
It's only a war
Ain't you ever been in a war before
The men begin to quiet down, look to Warden respectfully
Through the scene the heavy earth shudders are felt and heard as bombs hit in the far distance
Also the sound of the strafing planes
We're gonna organize a fire umbrella defense
want the non- coms to get BARs and ammunition from the Supply Room and get up on the roof
Henderson, you're in charge of the loading detail
Get movin
The non-coms push out the door
Hey, what about me
been waitin all my life to git to shoot a at somethin
Okay
It's your life
Treadwell hurries after the non-coms
The rest of you guys - the  will unlock the rifle racks
Every man get his rifle and go to his bunk and stay there
And  mean stay there
'm making each squad leader responsible to keep his men inside
If you have to use a rifle butt to do it, that's okay, too
There are shouts of protest
The men are over the first shock now and beginning to get angry, anxious for action
141
You heard me
This ain't no maneuvers
You go runnin around outside you'll get your ears shot off
You want to be heroes, you'll get plenty chances later
You'll probly have Japs in your laps before night
What if they bomb us
You hear a bomb comin, you're free to take off for the brush
But don't worry -- the Japs'll probly drop all their bombs on Pearl Harbor and Hickam
They ain't gonna waste `em on us
So let's can the chatter
We're wastin time
Squad leaders, get `em upstairs
Squad leaders begin to herd their men out
Warden jumps off the pool table
Stark and Karelsen come up to him
What you want me to do, First got a hangover, but  can still -- You stick in the kitchen and make a big pot of coffee
No -- make a barrel of coffee
think  could get one of them Japs with a machine gun, Milt
We'll put the tripod over a chimney
And hold her down by the legs
Whatever you say, Pete
They smile at each other affectionately, then push into the crowd leaving the Day Room
- The non-coma are arguing violently with Leva at the door to the Supply Room
Jap planes are loud overhead
142
don't care
can't issue any live ammunition without a signed order from an officer
But there ain't no officers yet, you jerk
Lieutenant Ross lives off the post
( ) 'm sorry fellows
Lieutenant Ross give me them orders himself
No signed order, no ammo
And that's all they are to it
Warden hurries up to the group
He won't let us have no ammo, Top
Hats got it locked up
An the keys in his pocket
Gimme them keys
can't, Top
got to obey my orders
No live ammo without a -- They flatten against the wall as a Jap plane roars building- high down the street, machine guns flaring
After it passes, they rush back to Lava, What's the matter
You blind
You see them planes --
Lava puts his hand in his pocket protectively, shakes his head
ain't gonna do it, Top
-- Okay
Chief, bust the door down
( ) Get the hell out of the way
143
Choate, Henderson and Dhom back up for a run at the door
Leva moves in front of the door
Go ahead
Bust it down
He'll get out of the way
Remember  warned you
did my best
Okay
'll see you get a medal
Warden dashes up the porch steps as Choate, Henderson and Dhom launch themselves at the door
Leva steps aside
The door rattles ponderously, then flies open
The three battering rams careen into the Supply Room
The men standing by cheer and rush in after them
Leva shakes his head grimly
- The men are sitting on their bunks, unhappily, holding their rifles
Others who have slept through breakfast are dressing hastily
Warden rushes into the room
The men immediately bark ad-libbed questions at him: ( ) What's the deal, First
Why can't we go up on the roof
Where's the ammo, Top
Are we soljers -- or Boy Scouts
() Start rollin full field packs
We may have to move out of here
Squad leaders, get `em packin
In b
g
Henderson and others are going up the porch stairs to the roof
They tote BARs and loading clips
Karelsen and two helpers follow with a heavy machine gun and belt boxes
Warden starts for the porch stairs
He is attracted by something, stops, looks out of scene
' lying under an empty bunk with three mattresses piled on it
He is in his underwear and a helmet, hugs his rifle
144
You'll catch a cold, Turp
Don't go out there, First Sergeant
You'll be killed
They're shootin it up
You'll be dead
You'll not be alive any more
Don't go out there
You better put your pants on
Warden hits the floor as a plane is heard so loud and low it sounds as if it's coming right into the room
dotted line of bullets crosses the floor and moves into Warden's and Karelsen's room
Warden jumps up and rushes into the room
'     - as Warden runs in
Broken glass lies all over the floor
Bullet holes are stitched across the top of Warden's footlocker
He throws back the lid fiercely
His linen is polka-dotted with holes
He tosses out shirts, shorts, etc
, digs underneath them
He pulls out a quart bottle of whisky; it is untouched
Warden smiles with relief
He lifts the bottle to his lips, drinks long and heartily
- About twenty of Company GIs men, including almost all the non- cams, are on the roof, They are crouched behind the chimneys or down on their knees in the corners
The BARs are propped on the low walls or chimney tops, their muzzles pointed to the sky
Three Jap planes, forming a , are heading straight for camera
() Come on, you dirty sons -- The scream of the planes drowns Dhom's voice
There is a tremendous clatter as the men fire
The Jap planes pass, untouched
145
From this moment on there is no letup of the noise -- there is a wild cacophony of Jap planes, BARs, Karelsen's machine gun, the deep sound of bombs hitting in the far distance
And Chief Choate, singing the Regimental marching song, loudly and lustily
as Warden comes up on the roof through the skylight
He shouts incoherently at the men
They shout back in a wild cheer
They are like a pack of hungry men enjoying their first big meal in years
In b
g
the Jap  has swung about and heads back
Warden grabs a  from the roof
grinning as his plane dives, its guns roaring
His silk scarf ripples out behind him
firing the , standing, as the Jap planes roar over
He staggers back from the recoil
The men fire in unison
They rise after the planes pass, shake their fists
Henderson and others of the loading detail appear on the roof, bringing up more ammunition
He lets out a hoarse yell of glee and pride
"These are my boys
This is my Company," it seems to say
The men answer back with a great answering shout
Warden makes a tour of the roof, laughing, exhorting, slapping the men on their buttocks like a quarterback
They respond with tremendous spirit; they are having one hell of a time
We get only a snatch of what Warden is yelling
-- Don't worry about wasting ammo
Throw your empty clips down into the yard
The loading detail will pick 'em up -- The sound of a bugle blowing insistently is now heard, blending into the rest of the noise
Treadwell runs to the edge of the roof, looks over
At the Bugler's post, Friday Clark is sounding a call
Treadwell turns, yells at the men
146
Friday's gone crazy
He's blowing the Cavalry Charge
- His cheeks puffed, blowing the bugle madly
'  - He is lying on a couch in pajamas
He has not shaven, his hair is unkempt
Radio Announcer is heard over shot
Prew wakens, groggy with hangover and near-delirium, wrestles with the blanket over him
to  , Alma and Gorgette
They have negligees over their nightgowns, are listening to the radio
The Announcer's voice tries hard to be calm and official but he cannot keep the tremor out of it
(: Transcripts of the actual broadcast have been requested
) ' This is a real attack, not a maneuver
The Japanese are bombing Pearl Harbor
Please keep in your homes
Do not go on the streets repeat, this is a real attack
Japanese planes are bombing our naval and army installations
Civilians will remain in their homes
This is a real attack - The Announcer's voice goes on as above
() Oh, those dirty Germans
Those dirty sneakin Germans
What Germans
(points to the radio) Them
It's the Japs
The Japs
147
' Attacks are now taking place at Pearl, Wheeler, Hickam and Schofield
dirty Germans
Alma shakes Prew, hard
He falls back on the couch, passes out
- The Jap strafing attack is continuing
Their planes are making a figure 8 in the sky
Silhouettes of men on the roof can b e seen
Friday Clark is blowing his Cavalry Charge
In b
g
men of the loading detail are scurrying around
Lieutenant Ross runs into shot
him across the quadrangle toward the barracks
Lieutenant Ross is hailed by the loading detail -- about ten men
He grabs a  and ammunition from them and runs into the barracks
The loading detail is working feverishly, same carrying ammunition into the barracks, others picking up empty clips as they are thrown from the roof and hustling them toward the Supply Room
- He is working hard, passing out ammunition to members of the loading detail
But he shakes his head dourly as if the whole thing is still very unofficial
- As before, pandemonium -- but controlled and efficient
The men are hoarse from shouting, red-eyed, puffing from excitement and exertion
Two Jap planes swoop past and the full-throated umbrella of fire lets loose
Lieutenant Ross clambers onto the roof, stooping under the burden of the and loading clips
The men greet him with a concerted cheer
Ross looks around the roof, nods with evident approval, claps Warden on the shoulder
' ,
148
Sound of Jap planes comes up ear-splitting loud
Ross drops down behind a chimney, swings his , fires Karelsen at the other side of the chimney, firing the machine gun
Two soldiers hang onto the bucking legs of the tripod
Two Jap planes pass in b
g
of shot, zoom off into the sky
() Nuts
Led him too tar
as the men on the roof reload
In the distance the Jap planes have turned and are heading back for the roof
Their lips curled bitterly as their planes head for the roof
firing a  at the planes
firing
firing Joyously
singing as he fires
firing the machine gun
He yanks the tripod away from his helpers, picks up the gun, stands and swings it after the plane
The recoil staggers him half way across the roof and deposits him on his rear
He jumps in his seat like a man tied to a hot stove, throws up his arms helplessly
The Jap plane bursts into flame and crashes
The men rise as one with an uproarious cheer
They rush to Karelsen, pick him up
Warden lets go with another of his rebel yells
You got him, Pete
You got him
149
(spits over roof) Ah, nobody'll ever know which of us got that guy
as the men return to their positions
Two planes head for them, pass over as Company  lets go again with everything it has
(pointing after second of ) Hey
That last one was one of ours
That was an American plane
Well, he ain't got no business here
We're takin care of this sector
swooping across the quadrangle about ten feet from the ground
- ' Friday Clark, blowing the Cavalry Charge madly, abandons the megaphone as he sees the plane coming
He drops on his chest, hugging the bugle
The plane passes
Clark jumps up instantly, resumes blowing the Charge
The same plane has gained altitude so that it is a few feet above the barracks as it heads straight for the roof
The men flatten, all but Warden
He stands, swings his toward the plane
so that Warden is silhouetted against the sky as he fires at the Jap plane
It misses the roof by a foot or two, zooms up at a weird angle
thick cloud of smoke pours out of the engine
The plane falls off on one wing and crashes into trees at the end of the quadrangle
crashing
The gas-tank explodes
cloud of fire and black 150
smoke obscures the screen
: '  - There are improvised blackout curtains over windows and the glass doors
The radio is on, volume low, and an announcer (not the one of the morning) is droning out an account of Pearl Harbor
Prew, still on the couch in his pajamas, looks as if he has just struggled to wakefulness
He listens to the radio for a few moments in confused disbelief
He shakes his head vigorously as if to throw off his grogginess
He shakes his head again, slowly, more knowingly now, nodding as if he remembers something from the broadcast of the morning
Then as if all of it hits him suddenly and fully and terribly he wrenches himself off the couch
He looks around at the dimly lit room
Alma
Alma
He goes to the blackout curtains, peeps out
Then he turns back to listen to the radio
Abruptly, he runs into the bedroom
' Alma
The room remains empty for a few moments as the radio announcer goes on, continuing previous remarks
' -- ready to fight and die for us, our Regular Army and Navy have this day upheld the faith and confidence we have always placed in them
They have proved their right to the esteem we have always had for them
Prew comes back into the room
He has his shoes on, holds civilian shirt and pants in his hand
He starts to put them on hurriedly, his attention still focused on the broadcast
The front door opens and Alma and Gorgette enter
They are surprised to see Prew up
He nods at them, turns back quickly to listen to the radio as he continues dressing
' the attack caused serious damage to many installations of which Pearl Harbor suffered the worst
() 151
' (cont'd) We will not forget this day -- and we will never let the Japanese forget it
(yells at radio) You said it
Who they think they're fight in
(incoherent with rage; to ) They're pickin trouble with the best Army in -- the best riflemen -- you know we the ony country on the face of the earth that uses the shooting gunsling, not the carrying gunsling
You know that
The radio continues on under the scene
Alma and Gorgette speak breathlessly, in a rush
We've been at Queens Hospital -- giving blood -- The town's a madhouse
Trucks, busses, jeeps all over -- house on Kuhio Street was bombed -- And the drugstore on McKully and King is smashed flat
And the man and his wife were killed -- Prew gestures to radio as if he's heard all about it
He sticks his shirttails into his trousers
gotta get back to the Post -- 'll try to get in touch with you in a couple days -- The Post
Tonight
Prew nods vehemently, moves across room to a table
But why
152
Why
There's a war goin on
But you can't
You're not fit yet -- you're weak as a kitten -- you're -- they'll throw you in the -- ( ) They'll be throwin `em out of the Stockade
They need every man they can get
He picks up the sheet of paper with the "Re-enlistment Blues" written out on it, starts to fold it
Desperation is reflected on Alma's face; she turns to Gorgette, as if pleading for aid, Your side'll open up -- And they'll find out it was you who killed that soldier
Prew shakes his head, as if obsessed by only one thought
Once  report in to the Compny 'll be all right
Once  get there gotta get back -- But you'll never make it
There's MPs all over -- 'll make it
'll go along the back roads
They'll let me in the West gate -- they'll know 'm a -- He puts the folded piece of paper in his pocket and starts for the door
Stay till morning
Prew glances at Alma incredulously
She sobs suddenly, violently
153
Maybe if you stayed till morning you'd change your mind
She throws her arms around him, clings to him
Don't go, Prew
'll do whatever you want
We'll figure out a way to get to the States together
We can even get married
If you go  won't see you any more
know it
Prew holds her closely for a moment, then moves her away from him
He turns toward the door
(tears turning to ) What do you want to go back to the Army for
What did the Army ever do for you
Besides treat you like scum and give you one awful going over and get your friend killed
What do you want to go back to that for
Prew frowns as if he's not sure he heard correctly
What do  want to go back for
'm a soljer
( ) soldier
soldier
Regular
From the Regular Army
thirty- year man
Sure
thirty-year man
() With only twenty-six years to go
He opens the door quickly and slips into the darkness
: - MPs The night is inky black except for a little moonlight and the 154
dimmed headlights of the jeep
driver onto the highway as the jeep moves slowly along
The two other MPs clutch Thompson guns, try to scan the dark countryside
They say they seen parachutists land up in the mountains
ain't worried about them
Sabatoors is what worries me
Yeah
Theys the creepy ones
Walkin around just like ordinary civilians
betcha they operatin all over these islands
The headlights pass along the road as the jeep moves on out of sight
As its sound fades we hear Prew's heavy breathing, are barely able to distinguish his figure in the darkness
He is crouched, watching the car go down the highway
We hear his thoughts
The voice is labored and agonized
'  (
) almost home
ony across the golf course
now
now
no
wait
gotta be care
gotta sweat it out
He groans, puts his hand to his side
In the feeble light from the moon we see blood on his shirt and hand
He looks up and down the road
'  (
) it's clear now
gotta get home
Still crouched, Prew starts across the road
We see nothing but the strip of road, then Prew+s figure is visible, bent low, weaving a little
As he approaches the camera, he is taught square in the twin beams of dimmed headlights which flash on from the side of the road
Now we see that a jeep is parked near camera, heading in the opposite direction from the jeep which passed before
It is also manned by three MPs
There is a startled cry from Prew
' Halt
155
Prew starts to run back across the road
white spotlight flashes on, its harsh brilliant light following him
Prew slips to one knee
looking toward the jeep, blinded by the blazing light
He has the appearance of a terrified animal
There is a wildness, a senselessness about him
The blotch of blood oozes and spreads over his shirt
He picks up a rock from the road
Prew rises, staggers away from the jeep
' Prew flings the rock desperately toward the lights
There is a crash of glass and one headlight winks off
Prew runs across the road and onto the golf course
The motor starts, The jeep moves out from its hiding place and starts across the golf course
Prew, in a skirmisher's zigzag, is trying to elude the spotlight
He is about twenty yards in front of the jeep
He heads for a high sandtrap
The spot is full on him as he reaches the lip of the trap
He turns, yells something back at the jeep
It is barely heard over the sound of the jeep
-- 'm a soljer
-- That guy ain't no soljer -- he dint -- standing on the lip of the trap, the jeep bearing down on him
He turns, starts to dive into the trap
blast of gunfire from the jeep hits him
He falls sideways into the trap, rolls over on his back, The jeep moves into the shot, crawls half-way over the trap, stops, its spotlight pouring down on Prew
His eyes are open, looking up to the sky
to Prew from top of trap
portion of the jeep is in shot, but we are not able to see the MPs
' (quavering, almost ) () 156
' (cont'd) -- maybe he was a soljer --  dint mean to kill him --  dint mean it, guys -- you know we got orders -- ' Shut up
The voices are lost as     toward Prew's open eyes
We hear his thoughts on the sound track, clear and fast at first and slow and almost inaudible as the ' sweat it out and sweat it out and wait and wait and wait for it
and now it's here
it's here
gotta see to do it well
gotta do it well
won't take long
of Prew's open eyes
' just a little more now
gotta do it good
it'll be over
nobody lies
lonely
a man has
got to have some place
Prew's eyes close
There is no sound as the screen remains black for several beats
: - They are looking down to camera, which   as if from point of view of Prew's body in the sand trap
The dimmed headlights of two jeeps illuminates them
Warden is fighting to control his emotion, to remain the professional soldier
The Lieutenant Colonel is disturbed, but kindly
Where's your Company Commander
He's at Headquarters, sir
'm the First Sergeant
157
Did you know this man personally
Yes, sir
They are standing on the lip of the sandtrap
The hoods of the jeeps that chased Prew and the second jeep are just behind them in shot
He didn't have any regular identification
But they found a card on him with his name -- (holds card close to ) -- seems to be a membership in a club
The -- New Congress Club
Yes, sir
The Lieutenant Colonel hands the card to Warden
'll turn this over to you
And these other things that were on him
This -- He unfolds a sheet of paper, holds it to the headlight
He and Warden squint at it
:       : "Re-enlistment Blues" is written at the top
The stanzas of the song are beneath the heading
' Seems to be acme sort of poem
' Yes, air
Very softly, so distant that we can only distinguish a word or two now and then, we hear the voices of Clark, Anderson and Prew singing the "Re-enlistment Blues
" The plaintive melody continues under the rest of the scene
And this
Whatever it is
158
He holds Prew' s bugle mouthpiece up to the light, gives it to Warden
Warden holds it in his hand, stares at it
Under the "Re-enlistment Blues," even softer, farther away, we now hear Prew's bugle blowing Taps
It continues, with the song, to the end of the scene
It's the mouthpiece of a bugle
The Lieutenant Colonel looks at Warden closely
Are you all right, Sergeant
Was this man a friend of yours
Warden speaks very formally
Sir, this man was a good soldier
He loved the Army moren any soljer ever knew
would like to make a formal request that this body be buried in the Army's permanent cemetery at Schofield Barracks
believe  can attend to that for you
Thank you, sir
'm sorry, Sergeant
The Lieutenant Colonel walks off
Prew's body in the shot as Warden looks down at it
He looks at it for several moments
The Taps is just coming to an end
Warden speaks very quietly
No, sir
hardly knew the guy
: - Taps and the Re-enlistment Blues are swept away by the lush strains of Aloha Oe
The Hawaiian music continues through the scene
159
- She is looking back at the city
Around her neck is a garland of leis
' ' It's very beautiful, isn't it
She turns and   to  Alma in shot, standing beside Karen
She is dressed in black, quite severely
() think It's the most beautiful place  ever saw in my lire
No one would know there was a war, from out here
Karen takes off her leis, begins tossing them over the rail
There's a legend
If they float in toward shore, you'll come back some day
If they float out to sea, you won't
won't come back
had to get away from here
You see, my fiance was killed on December seventh
Oh,  am sorry
(quickly, as if rehearsed) He was a bomber pilot
He tried to taxi his plane off the apron and the Japs made a direct hit on it
Maybe you read about it in the papers
They awarded him a Silver Star
They sent it to his mother
She wrote me she wanted me to have it
160
(tossing the last of leis ) That's very fine of her
They're very fine people
Southern people
He was named after a General
Robert
Lee -- Prewitt
Karen looks at Alma numbly
Alma is looking out across the water
Who
Robert
Lee Prewitt
(on verge of tears) Isn't that a silly old name
They are floating on the water behind the ship
They are being carried out to sea
choppy wave washes over it, submerges it
