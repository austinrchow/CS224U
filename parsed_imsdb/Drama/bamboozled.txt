It is a commune

Entrance
Cheeba is putting the portable floor down on the sidewalk
Manray sits on the curb, taking the sneakers off and putting on his tap shoes; bottle caps are on the soles of the shoes instead of real taps
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen

But don't sleep us

Manray, he pounds out some intricate steps and freezes at the end of the move
Crowd, who applaud as Cheeba unfolds a brown shopping bag and holds it out in front of them

Delacroix moves towards the revolving doors of
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street
Well do something about it

- Delacroix gets off the elevator, takes out his , slips it through the scanner and enters the reception area of
Good morning, Marie
It's not gonna be a good morning for you if you don't get into Dunwitty's staff meeting
What staff meeting
The staff meeting that started 30 minutes ago
- Delacroix walks, or better yet, slithers into the staff meeting that is already in progress
sit around an oval table, all are Caucasian except Delacroix, again he's the lone person of color, the "fly in the buttermilk
" , Senior
of the Entertainment Division of looks at Delacroix and waits for him to sit down before he continues
6
Monsieur Delacroix, this very important meeting commenced
Dunwitty looks at his Rolex Chronograph - Daytona Model
(') exactly thirty-two minutes ago
'm sorry 'm late
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone
didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until
Delacroix looks at his Jaeger-LeCoultre
(') Four minutes ago
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you
wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as  got off the elevator
All eyes are on Delacroix and he feels it
People, you can attempt to pull a Rodman like our friend Delacroix, but  guarantee you'll be sent packing just like him
Dunwitty via remote turns off the lights and turns on an overhead projector
(') These are the standings
Read 'em and weep
As you can plainly see the Continental Network System is languishing

(
) (') Look at 'em people
We are , We are -
Doo-doo on a stick, if you will
Dunwitty
(') do not like to be the laughing stock of the broadcast industry have pride and people, you better start getting some too
These numbers have to go up
Dunwitty turns on the lights
, one of the writers, raises her hand
(') Question
So what do you want us to do
What  want everyone to do is write some material that is
The junk you've been writing is about as funny as a dead baby
It's not funny, it's not new
It's not sexy
It, it, it
Fish
Sucks
Conference room
Thank you, Fish
This meeting is over but  want everyone to seriously think about what said and how you can deliver
People scurry out
(') Monsieur Delacroix, in my office now
8
- The writers, beat down, come out of the conference room and move past  , a highly attractive African- American "sistuh
" Delacroix sees Sloan and holds her arm as they walk
He talks under his breath
How was it
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting
Nobody told me anything
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this
It wasn't my fault
If  would have known,  would have known
'  - Delacroix enters his corner office, which has huge action photos of , , , ,  and  on his walls, it is also decorated with African art throughout
Office
Dunwitty looks at the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking mid-town Manhattan
Do you know what
Time is
Time is Colored People's Time
The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late
That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance
They both laugh
Let's sit down over there
9
Dunwitty and Delacroix sit on the sofa
(') 'm sorry about my blowup but have to have a whipping boy every meeting
understand
But again, in all honesty  was not informed
Forget it
believe you're my most creative person 've got on staff
You're hip
You know what's happening
got some corny white boys and girls writing for me
Delacroix doesn't join him in his laughter because he doesn't know how to take that comment or where Dunwitty is headed with it
(') understand Black culture
grew up around black people all my life
If the truth be told  probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix
Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote  word
got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so  feel  have a right to use that word
don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right
Nigger is just a word
If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can
would prefer you not use that word in my presence
Delacroix pounces on top of Dunwitty like a cat on a mouse and gives him a quick
Say it again
'mon, say it again
Dunwitty
He's a bloody pulp
10
Delacroix
He straightens his tie
(') Who's a nigger now
This is a fantasy in Delacroix's mind
We go Everything's how we left it
The material you've been creating is too white bread
White people with black faces
The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary
But that's dead
We can't go down that road again
don't agree
The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom
'm telling you it's not
He goes to his desk, picks up Delacroix's scripts and starts throwing them one by one against the window
(') The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave
The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the
The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter
The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter
The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son
And so on and so forth
It's too clean, too antiseptic
to white
still feel all of my scripts would make good shows
11
Delacroix, wake up, brother man
The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and mean  - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk
've never been given a fair shot
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways
Brother man, 'm blacker than you
'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white
'm an oreo, a sell out
Because don't aspire to do , ,  's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show
'm a Tom
'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black
Is that what you think
That's exactly what  think want you to create something that people want to see
Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and 'm including 35 million African-Americans
You know and know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles
This is a golden opportunity now
These idiots have to be led to the water
'm not sure if  can deliver what you want
You will or you'll be back at so quick you'll never know what hit you
need a mid-season replacement and pronto
It will be on the fast track
12
What is it you want from me
Some plantation follies
Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch
Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads
You want me to go back to the ante bellum days
Yes
Yes
Yes
want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week
want advertisers dying to buy on this show
'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you
- a street lamp, and coming out of it are some wires
the wires into a tenement building
The residents have tapped into a street light courtesy of for power
- Cheeba stands in front of the makeshift kitchen, which includes a hot plate, and prepares a gourmet meal of a tasty Spanish dish
The clean apartment is furnished with stuff people have thrown out that they picked up on the street
'm starvin' like Marvin
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon
Hurry up,  wanna watch
Did we get our bill yet
They both laugh
guess that will come with the rent, gas, and Con Ed bills, too
13
Ahh, the luxuries of life
Yo, check it
This is good and all that but one day soon  want to have much Benjamins so  can have a nice crib and pay all my bills
You hear me
Chill, 'm the brains behind this outfit
And 'm the feet
Yo, you gotta show some patience
You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation
Son, there is no such thing
'm tired of waiting
'  - He sits in front of a large flat-screen television, watching the Yankee game and eating his takeout Chinese food
On top of the monitor, he has attached a sign that reads " " '   - She sits in front of her television, hand on remote, flipping channels and eating takeout Chinese food
'  - They both are devouring the chicken with rice, as they watch bootleg
'  - Delacroix sits at his desk, a ream of white bond paper in front of him, a box of number-two pencils and an electric pencil sharpener
(
) was never good at performing under the gun
14
Pencil after pencil gets inserted and sharpened to a knife like point
(
) (') Well, this wasn't a gun, it was a bazooka and it was pressed dead blank right against my dome
Delacroix, staring at the blank ream of paper
It is very intimidating
Monitor
Bernie Williams is at the plate for the New York Yankees
Sign atop monitor
Again, it reads "
" ' She too is blank
screen saver bobs and weaves on her laptop
' Delacroix grabs a pencil and put it to paper
Paper
He doodles
- Manray screws out the bare light bulb which is the sole source of illumination and lays down onto his mattress on the floor
' Sloan closes her laptop and jumps into her bed
' Delacroix is already in the bed, the lights are out
Delacroix, who's wide awake
15
- Manray and Cheeba are both sound asleep
Cheeba, he has a sheet pulled over his head
Manray, who's sawing logs, snoring loudly
-,    , yelling
Police sirens, cars and trucks
Apartment
Cheeba and Manray run to the window and look out
The street is filled with police cars, vans and wagons
Helicopters hover overhead with their searchlights on the building
Oh snap
It's a raid
Cheeba and Manray jump into their cloths
- Cops in riot gear storm into the tenement
police chief barks over a speaker system
Please evacuate this building
All of you are illegal residents of this condemned building
Please leave immediately, by order of the Mayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani
- Stairwell
It's bedlam
The hundreds of  who have been living here all making a bad dash trying to flee the as they "bumrush the show
" Floor
Cheeba and Manray try to push against the crowd
16
Not this way
Out through the fire escape
The  are running up the staircase
People try to escape with as many of their belongings that they can hold
My tap shoes
' He jumps out of bed
' Oh my God
She too jumps out of bed
It is a ,
It's
The Squatters are being seized as soon as they come out of the tenement
Searchlights go back and forth, as the cops make their arrests and fill the "Paddy" wagons
Street
The Squatters are like  in a dark kitchen at night, scrambling as the lights turn on
Do you remember those old "" commercials
"Let's scram, '
" '  - The phone rings
Delacroix picks it up
They yell in unison
Manray
Manray
17
How did you know
It hit me like a ton of bricks
How can this be
You and me at the same time, the exact same thought
It's scary
The idea was out there in the universe
Now what
- Cheeba and Manray run down the fire escape and just elude a group of cops
Fence
They lay still as the Fuzz run past them
We ran out without my shoes and the floor
gotta get my stuff
What about our savings
Are you crazy
The joint is crawling with cops now
You wanna go to Rikers
Go to the hoosegow
Manray looks at his friend, he knows he is right, at least this time
- Delacroix and Sloan sip hot coffee as they stand in front of their office building
Manray was under our nose the whole time
Do you know how you will use him
Not yet, but this thing will never get made
18
You lost me
Dunwitty wants a Coon show
And that's what 'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air
Hence 'll prove my point
What point is that
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons
Sounds risky to me
You getting cold feet
'm in till the end
Good
'm going to need your support
Can't you just quit
Walk away
And lose out on my money
The only way  get paid is if  get fired
And that's what  intend to do
- It is pouring rain and Delacroix and Sloan huddle under an umbrella
(
) Everything was going according to plan
was working on the outline
Dunwitty was off my back for now
Delacroix
19
(
) (') But there was a catch
big catch
Sloan
(
) (') Manray and Cheeba were nowhere to be found
- Manray and Cheeba are soaking wet
They stand together in a doorway, trying to stay out of the elements
Street
They run in the downpour
(
) It was like they had disappeared off the face of the earth
Cheeba
(
) (') had no contact numbers, no address, no beeper
Manray
(
) (') No nuthin', no clues
- It is a sunny and pleasant morning
Again, Sloan and Delacroix hold vigil
Maybe something happened to them
Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death
Manray better not be bleeding to death
need him
After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours
20
You're beginning to sound like Dunwitty
- Manray and Cheeba stand across the street from their former residence
All of the doors and windows have been boarded up and two cops stand watch
They both look defeated, dirty and hungry
- Sloan gets off the elevator and sees a skirmish are trying to escort Manray and Cheeba out of the building
His name is Delapoint
#1 have no one by that name
Delapot
Dela-something
#2 De La Soul ain't here either
Let's go
Out
Off the premises
Manray turns around and sees Sloan
Sloan
She knows us
The security guard stops
It's alright
They are associates of Mr
Delacroix
#1 Sorry, Ms
Hopkins
They both walked in off the street without an appointment
#2 Do you need an escort
That won't be needed
21
'  - He sits in front of his  and watches a tape of the old "Amos 'n' Andy" show
Sloan leads Manray and Cheeba in
Eureka
Where've you been
He hugs them both
(') Sloan and  have been looking all over for you
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short
No offense
Manray needs a job
Delacroix smiles at Sloan
We got evicted from our home
We've both been on the streets for the last week
We was coming to see you
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food
We're starving
apologize
What would you like to eat
Anything you want
'  - feast of McDonald's is taking place
Cheeba and Manray are stuffing Big Macs, Fish Deluxes and large french fries into their mouths
They were famished
22
have this concept for a  pilot
There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money
How much
First things first
have to know if Manray is up for this
What do  have to do
Some tap dancing, some singing
Where do  sign
What kind of show is this gonna be
Different
How different
Trust me
Of course  still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other
DeLa, 'm aboard
As long as  get to hoof and get paid too
That's right
Money turns the wheel
What about in the mean time
Not the in between time
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me
Bet
23
would like to change your name
To what
You're now Mantan
Mantan
don't even care as long as 'm dancing
Which reminds me, need some new kicks
- Manray holds two Capezio shopping bags of shoes as he walks next to Sloan
never had a really real pair before
You've never had any formal training, either
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself
wish  had your natural talent
God only makes that visit once in a while
You sing and dance
little
just graduated from film school
Cinema studies
So what's up with you and DeLa
What do you mean
Are you and him kicking it
Knocking boots
'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout
24
No, we're not knocking boots got this internship while  still was at , DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant
'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with
You look beautiful like that
If that was suppose to be a compliment,  thank you
You're welcome
You shouldn't give up on performing
Why do you say that
You've never seen me
think that would probably make you the happiest
When 'm hoofing, mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world
envy you
That's the way  want to feel about my work
- Sloan walks from the subway to her block
Street
huge black Chevy Suburban follows her, all the windows are tinted jet black, you cannot see it all into it
She notices the vehicle and starts to walk faster
Corner
As Sloan tries to cross at the corner, the Suburban pulls up in front of her, blocking her path
Suburban
tall black man jumps out of the Chevy
This is 25
Li'l Sister
Corner
You idiot
You almost gave me a massive coronary
didn't mean to scare you like that
Well you did
Give me some
'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street
You must be crazy, Julius
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'
done told you 'bout that
Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name
My true name is
'm not callin you Big Black Africa
Mommy and Daddy named you Julius
is the first name and is the last
He hugs her, she becomes lost in his huge arms and laughs
'   - Big Black is rummaging through his sister's refrigerator
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece
order out mostly
So what do owe this visit to
26
My group we need some exposure
Was wondering if you could hook a brother up
Hook you up
The Mau-Mau's
You must be smoking
Why in the world would  want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies
So now  see where you're coming from
Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo
Who are you revolting against
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color
And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the
of
Please
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours
What's his name again
Delacroix
Yeah, him
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's
'mon, why not
The Monkees had a show
Look at all that other junk that's on
We got underground cult following
27
You don't have the demographics
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting
'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'
That'swhatI'msayin'
'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you
Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga
If you think 'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative
You got your ways to affect change,  have mine
And  would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house
My own sister throwin' me out hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right
Don't bother letting me out
That's mighty black of you
Big Black slams the door
'  - One by one, the team enters the office and sits down on the sofa
Delacroix, 'm glad you got your mind right
It's right and tight
Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody
You know my assistant, Sloan
28
Hello
This is Cheeba
Nice to meet you
And this is Manray
How do you do
Good
like the names
Very theatrical
We're all happy to be here and 'm going to paint a picture for you
'm wid it
've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right
In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial
have never really dug deep
Not anymore
As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way
Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder
If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony
It's about promoting racial healing
Go on
Good so far
know you're familiar with minstrel shows
They came about at the turn of the 19th century
It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits
Dunwitty,  ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air
Carol Burnett
HeeHaw
29
Word
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium
The name of the show
It is called:  - 'm lovin' it
You know how  know
Because 'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister
Dunwitty starts walking around his office, pumping his first
(') 'm feelin' dis'
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the  to get this on the air
In fact, would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial
Don't worry about that, that's my department
Now who do we cast
We need a star
Can Whoopi sing or dance
don't know if Whoopi is the way to go
Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose
Which one is Mantan again
That's me
30
And Cheeba is Sleep 'n' Eat
Cheeba
look of surprise is on his face
Complete, utter surprise
That's a great handle
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat
Two real coons
know we're way out there but it's satire
want you take it there
All the way to the edge and back
Sloan looks at Delacroix with concern
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat
The Dusky Duo
What are there character traits
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky
Exactly
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick
Yep, you guessed it
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy
" 31
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air
Could stop us from ever getting on
Let'em try
will kill to make this happen
Delacroix looks at Sloan
Negroes would be in an uproar
So what
We would just give the a donation that would be the end of that
No such thing as bad publicity
So what
Earlier you said singing and dancing
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer
He has educated feet
Who are the other characters
Do we have characters
How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima
Dunwitty is dying with laughter
He's the only one
We gonna hit 'em wid da on dis' one
What's the setting
In the projects
Like Eddie Murphy's "The 's
" Ya first bad move
Projects been done
That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, , are set in the urban jungle, da hood
That's so tired
Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation
In Alabama
() 32
(') And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity
Make us feel good to be alive
don't know about that plantation angle
What are you talkin' 'bout
It's the move
Stay wid me now
We're movin' fast
What does everybody else think about this
We'd get a lot of mail
She laughs, it's a fake one at that
(') Mr
Dunwitty, there wouldn't be another show like it
've always wanted to be on television
like you
Sleep 'n Eat
That's funny
Mantan, how do you feel about performing in black face
As long as the hoofing is real, that  can do my thing,  can blacken up
Let me hit it, beats and rhythms, express myself
Show me a little somethin' somethin'
Mantan starts to put on his new tap shoes
(') Delacroix, you dug deep, deeper than deep
Mantan is ready
33
'm gonna give you just a taste
My tap shoes are brand new haven't trained 'em yet
He starts to work out
(') Rhythms, rhythms, rhythms
Beats, beats, beats
No Fred Astaire here, baby
Just rawness
Dunwitty clears his desk of everything, just knocks stuff flying onto the floor
And Mantan taking the cue, jumps up on his desk and really starts hitting it
Delacroix, as he watches his creation, it's not a happy face
Mantan, he's bringing it home
With the final move, he leaps off the desk into the middle of the office, and
The office
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout
He's off the hiz-hook
We think so
Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do
play the straight man
do some singing and dancing also
also manage Mantan
Oh you do so
'm the man behind the man behind the man
You da man
34
No, you da man
'm gonna run upstairs with this
If  doesn't want to do this, somebody else will have da balls to pull the trigger
want to thank each and every one of you
This is great, Delacroix
'll get back to you later today
- Cheeba and Mantan are walking in midtown Manhattan
They both have a pep in their step, money in their pockets, and a roof over their heads
Life is beginning to look up
It's all good in da neighborhood
You might be right
Why are you smiling so
His smile is a mile wide
'm not smiling
Naw, not you
It can't be

'  - Delacroix sits with Manray and Cheeba in the living room
want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind
Why
You have to start getting into your character
At the risk of sounding ignorant
Cheeba turns quickly towards Manray
(') don't say a word but who is this cat Mantan you keep talkin' 'bout
Delacroix hits the remote button
The  and  are powered
Television
We see   in some obscure movie

(
) This is Mantan Moreland
Television
Mantan reacts to seeing a ghost
(
) (') He was a clown, a buffoon but he was funny
Living room
That ain't funny
DeLa,  don't know 'bout this
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical
You know what that is, don't you
Trust me on this one
We might need some mo' money behind this
That can be done
Mantan

They pass around joints that look like they've been on steroids and 64 ounce  of     - liquid crack, the preferred alcoholic beverage of All the members of the -'s are except one
There is one Caucasian member
He goes by the name 1/16th , the engineer tech-whiz kid computer geek
37
1/16TH Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint
How 'bout
Big Black takes a long, long drag on a joint, then he quickly empties a 64 oz
in one swing without missing a beat, without missing a head nod
(') Black Iz Black
The whole group goes crazy with the title of the song
That's da bomb
That's gonna give me some inspiration
Gonna make me get my flow on
We should call dis da  album
Everyone starts high-fiving each other
Yo, check it out
We have never conformed to none of the white man's rules and regulations and later for that ole slave owner Webster
Therefore  respectfully submit   that we from now on, hence forth and whatnot spell : ---, not ----
feel dat
1/16TH ---
The darkest of all colors, the opposite of white member of an African people

Listen to the full connotations

1/16TH  (') Need  say more
--- it is
- middle-aged African-American woman is working in the kitchen
Delacroix sits at the kitchen table talking with her
This is his ,
Orchid puts a plate of food in front of her son
You must think 'm some kind of fool
It looks delicious
You hear me talkin' to you
The only time you come up here when something is wrong
'mon, Mommy, don't start with that 'm an ungrateful son stuff
said no such thing
All  said is that something must be wrong
She sits down with him
(') How's the food
Can't beat it with a hammer
Well, since you asked, it looks like may have a new show, a pilot being shot
That's wonderful
Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own
He talks between mouthfuls
39
It was
It is
But this is a different kind of show
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless
Mommy, please don't call me that
Son, Peerless is your name
Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate
know what's on my birth certificate
You heard from Daddy
guess he's still on the road
What kind of show is this
Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons
Peerless,  didn't raise a buffoon
We have enough of those on television already
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something
will
And good luck with your show
hope it's a huge success
You've worked very hard
You deserve it
Delacroix gets up from his seat and hugs his mother
40
- celebration is going on as Delacroix, Sloan, Cheeba and Mantan sit at a table
Table
Cheeba and Mantan are giddy
Sloan looks at Delacroix who is visibly not happy
You okay
feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer
DeLa - what's the matter with you
You ain't happy about the green light
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral
'm happy for all of us
It's just we have a great responsibility now
The pressure is on
Pressure
DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is
This is lightstuff
Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with money and  prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure
didn't mean it to sound like that
41
That's the way it came out
Let me ask you one question
Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life
Now 'm privileged
Why
Because didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare
Because  didn't call home a cardboard box
No,  never ever went to bed hungry and 'm proud of it, too
Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you
The point 'm trying to make is that this is a blessing
It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way
Delacroix gets up from the table and leaves
What's wrong with him
Must be the pressure
Cheeba and Mantan laugh, give each other some dap
highly attractive   female walks over to their table
This is
Sorry 'm late
Cheeba and Mantan are in awe
Hey, girl
This is my best friend, Jessica Grillo
invited her down to celebrate with us
'm Cheeba
'm Mantan
They both rise
42
Please, have a seat
Sloan never told us she had friends like you
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period
Later for you
She has a lot of friends Male
Yes
lot
Enough
Sloan and Jessica laugh at the expense of these guys
propose a toast
She grabs an empty glass and pours herself some champagne
(') To the success of your show
Good luck
Everyone raises their glasses
Excuse me
Sloan gets up from the table and takes after Delacroix
Steps
Sloan catches up with Delacroix at the rest room area
(') Wait here
43
She goes to the ladies' cubicle
Delacroix
He leans against the wall
Bathroom door
Sloan comes out, grabs him inside
'  - Sloan locks the door
What is your problem
My problem is Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made
It was the principle
Dunwitty had to be enlightened
was making a point
take pride in my work
Plus,  already told you  wasn't gonna walk away from my money
Fuck da money
Why do through all this effort
Why
Are you looking for love from Dunwitty
For respect
Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you
So now what are you gonna do
Someone begins to pound on the bathroom door
'  (
) Will you please let me in
have to use the toilet
You're gonna have to hold it in because we're not finished yet
She returns her attention to Delacroix
(') then
44
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous
What's the chances of  being picked up
wouldn't bet against it
My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place
Like  said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal
Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it
The banging starts again
'  (
) Please open this bathroom door immediately
You are being very inconsiderate
Sloan unlocks the door and they exit
Ladies' bathroom
Sloan and Delacroix file past the strange looks of the manager and   waiting to use the bathroom as they rush in
'  - strongly feel that a Negro should direct this
This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm
One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy
"  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain
To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right
It's un-American will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job
45
was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after
want a hot, young white director
Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot
just want you to meet him
Keep an open mind
Besides, what does he know about Negroes
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go
Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective
black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter
With this kid, the possibilities are endless
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot
That's exactly my point
Has he even directed actors before in anything
No
Just meet the guy
That's all 'm asking
Look, 'll even let you choose your own musical director
You can have that
46
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman,
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas
didn't want it bad enough
Delacroix, do you want it
Bad enough to kill for it
Do you want it that much
Delacroix stares at Dunwitty
- Delacroix, followed by Sloan, enters the room full of writers
Delacroix He surveys the room
- All of the writers are Caucasian - male and female
Every single last one
Conference room
Delacroix and Sloan sit down at the head of the long oval table
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, 'm Pierre Delacroix
'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins
Hello
've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch
'm a fair person, a straight shooter and  don't hold my tongue
Everybody up in here should know had nothing to do with you being hired
() 47
(') would have preferred at least one other Negro writer
Any questions
Comments
raises her hand
(') Yes, your name
He, 'm Mona
Hi, Mona
perfectly understand where you're coming from
As a minority  can relate to your struggle also
But think you should give us all a chance
We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you
Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness
Oh, is that what 'm doing
jumps in
think because of our background we can bring a unique perspective to Mantan
pipes in also
fresh pair of eyes
new look, insight, new angle that hasn't been seen before
've heard this somewhere before
David raises his hand
48
My name is David
do think it would be better to have some African-American writers but for whatever reason they are not here
don't know if they couldn't find any people with experience, they wouldn't work for the pay or refused to work for the show don't know and nobody in this room probably knows either
'm looking at this as a unique opportunity
We all should
'm a damn good writer and 'm ready to go to work
Everyone in the room applauds
Sloan looks at Delacroix
(
) This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in
Could Don King be near
Good thing Sloan had my back
She's my rock
This was going to be a whole lot of work
- (') David,  appreciate your comments
Anybody got an ideas
Everybody just talk out loud
've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "-
" That could be cool
What about something like "The Jeffersons
"   grew up in Idaho so that's how  got my understanding of black people
Through Sherman Helmsley,
"Good Times" was better
Kid Dy-no mite
49
You pole are going to far back for me
think we have to go after a hipper feel
Like the stuff Eddie Murphy used to do on "Saturday Night Live
" Or Martin
You go girl
What about the  black exploitation films
No one has ever tried making that work on
And for reason
Have you ever seen "Scream Blacula, Scream
" think, and Delacroix will agree with me, the politics of this show have to be right
We should always be laughing with our characters, not at them
Delacroix, as the writers continue to ramble on, he lets them jerk off
(
) The mission was accomplished
All of these people left the room thinking they would have real input
was writing this pilot alone, myself, me
- long line reaches down the block and around the corner
It's a "cattle call," open auditions for "Mantan
" (
) Now came the fun part, finding the talented performers to cast in the show
past the hundreds and hundreds of unemployed African American actors, many of them dressed in various costumes
50
(
) (') Everybody and their mother was trying to get in, trying to be seen
Trying to get their piece of the rock
- Delacroix sits in the first row with Sloan, , an African American casting director
, the musical director, also black, is on the stage at the piano
singers, magicians, dancers, acrobats, comedians, rappers
Some good, most are terrible
Many come out on stage dressed like mammies, Stepin' Fetchit, slaves, pimps, ho's, hustlers, and basketball players
It is a cavalcade of all the stereotypical roles one has seen
Space
, a spoken word artist, goes her rendition of "
" (
) This was amazing
Who had told these Negroes that this was what we were looking for
The same old image, it damn for sure wasn't me
Lulu
(
) (') Were people this desperate to get work
Delacroix
He interrupts Lulu
(') Thanks, Ms
Lulu
But  had several more poems
That's good
We've seen enough
We'll get back to you
Lulu scurries off stage
51
(
) Next
The Mau-Mau's run onto the stage, yelling and screaming
They are all fired up, in fact several fire their 9mm's into the ceiling
- Delacroix and Sloan
This is the group  was telling you about
Which one is your brother
The big one
Ruth
Let's get started here
Big Black preens around on the stage
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place
That's right, the Mau-Mau's
(
) What's your name
My righteous name is
(
) And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today
We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding
The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists
We drop science

If she sits any lower she'll be under her seat
We're ready when you are

The booming track starts and the Mau-Mau's do their thing, bouncing all over the stage
The lyrics about everything that is

(
) Needless to say, the Mau-Mau's did not fit into our plans
She's in shock, horrified
(
) (') As  told Sloan, there's a black sheep in every family
- Delacroix is screaming at the top of his lungs
(') Finland
This is a travesty debacle
mockery
Dunwitty approaches Delacroix in the lobby of the rehearsal space
He is with , a young, very young blonde kid
Delacroix
This is the director was telling you about
Jukka Laks
So nice to meet you
Nice to meet you
If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you
just turned twenty
'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone
Dunwitty, don't leave
54
Dunwitty is out
(') Where are you from
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland
Finland
You know, Finlandia vodka
Yes
Yes,  know
Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before
Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before
What's a Negro
Delacroix continues to rant and rave
Sloan is unsuccessful in attempting to make him be quiet
fiasco
disaster
boondoggle
An abomination
Did you just ask me what's a Negro
'
Ahhh
never heard of that term before
thought you were of African-American
No
Well before there was  or , there were '
Thank you for correcting my ignorance
'm looking forward to working side by side with you feel we make a good team
55
How did you get this gig
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot
This is a  show, not a music video
Then will you teach me what  need to know
Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no
- This is a travesty
debacle
You've said that already
'm gonna slit my wrists
Cut my throat
For the love of Joseph
'  - He's sitting behind his desk, reading new "pink" revisions of the "" pilot
He screams
For the love of Joseph and Mary
Delacroix bolts out from his office
'  - Delacroix charges in as Dunwitty and Jukka go over the same "pink" revisions
will not be held responsible for these revisions
These changes are not the way  want to go
This is an outrage
This is a sham violation
Calm down, please
In Finland, when we get upset
56
don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from
We just punched it up a bit
Made it funnier
Funnier to who and at who's expense
Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, 'm giving them your home address
Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut
seriously doubt that will ever happen
Didn't  tell you  know your people better than you do
But if by some miracle you're correct, 'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings
- Much activity is going on
People are moving to and fro
Delacroix and Sloan

Just want to say good luck
Break a leg
She gives Mantan a kiss on his cheek
Wait a minute
Hold up
They all laugh

Naw
'll take the zero
You feel good, not nervous

The material is fine
Sloan cuts a look at this liar

We're trying to do something new here, some groundbreaking stuff
' It's the bone breaking stuff 'm worried about
58
Everything's gonna be alright
You and Mantan will be huge stars after tonight
' You really think so
Your life will never be the same
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready
We both lied to him
What do you want me to say
Just don't lie to me
- , a rotund, elder black man who is one of cast members, is warming the audience up
It's very young and diverse
They are laughing at the comic stylings of Honeycutt

Good luck, Jukka
Do a good show
Thank you very much
always try my best

Honey, this is Pierre Delacroix and Sloan Hopkins
Nice to meet you
Same here

Congrats in advance
Verna and Dunwitty go to the front of the control booth
Delacroix and Sloan
Divine inspiration
She laughs

The  is aghast
Mantan has picked up the pace
He's tapping fast and furious
Cousins,  want all of you to go to your windows
Go to your windows and yell
Yell, 'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents
'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks
'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes
Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's

Slowly more black people begin to applaud
Slowly it sweeps up into the black people

The  , of course, has been waiting to see how their black brothers and sisters would react
Now feeling comfortable and safe, they too being to join the applause
The applause changes into laughter
It is not nervous laughter we hear, but straight out
The laughter is contagious
Mantan starts to move, he's coming back from the dead

We're on in 3 weeks

He wants you to come and see him
He said that
Yes he did
Where is he
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia

Richmond is not all the way down south
don't even know why you're still concerned over him
Daddy's not with you
Regardless, he still is your father
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off
Even more reason to see him
He'll be overjoyed with your success
'mon, Mommy
Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything 've ever done
From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present
Peerless, last time, go see your father

He sits up and starts to do a dance for her
To her
Mantan is doing that "Mating" tap dance
Are you trying to seduce me
He puts his index finger over his mouth - "Quiet

He quickly jumps up on the bench, does some intricate steps then pulls Sloan up from her sitting position

What's in style down here is a lot different from what's happening en Nueva York
Many of the men are dressed like  from 70's  , the ladies like   from "Luke" video
Delacroix works himself through the crowded / into another small room
He walks into a small space where his father  is on the stage

He is a good-looking man, the only speckle of gray in his hair betrays his age
As he walks around the small stage doing his comedy stylings, he keeps a drink in one hand and sips it often
Delacroix sits in the back so his father can't see him
He looks around
It's dead in here
The room is nearly empty
couple gets loud, arguing over something

Can you please show me some respect

(') Don't need yo money for drinks
Besides, she's drunk already
'mon, let's go
The guy grabs his friend by the wrist and drags her kicking and screaming out the room
Don't bring your woman out if you can't keep her in deep check
If my woman ever did something crazy like that 'd put my size 12 dead up in her ass
This gets the biggest laugh of the night
- Delacroix knocks
(
) What do you want
want to speak with you
(
) Go away, unless you got my money
It's me, Peerless
He enters into a closet, it's a makeshift dressing room younger lady, much younger than Junebug -  - stands behind him as she massages his neck
72
Junebug gets up from his chair, rushes to his son and they embrace
Son
Good to seeya
Good to seeya
It's been a long time
Pull up a chair
Oh, excuse me, this is my lady
Pleased to meet you
Glad to meet you, too
You are all your father talks about
Is that so
Honey, pour me and my son a drink
They both sit down as drinks are poured
'll leave you two alone
She kisses Junebug on the forehead before leaving
Good woman
trained her right
Daddy, she's younger than me
My game is still strong
No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals
Just my tonic
He holds up his drink and kills it in one gulp
(') Purely for medicinal purposes
thought you had promised Mommy you stopped

'm not an alcoholic just like to drink
How did you end up here
How did  end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny
Is that what you're asking ya Daddy
Delacroix takes a sip of his drink
That's what 'm askin'
Because  had too much pride
Too much integrity
wouldn't lick nobody's butt
Some material refused to do
Daddy, it can't be just because of that
There had to be other factors
Junebug pours himself another stiff one
That's the only reason, period
They only want one certain kind of black comic
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back
All  know is what happened to me
All that other mess  just file into the "life's too short" category
He downs another one
Junebug drinks like a fish
(') Enough about me, what's happening with you
The same old, same old
Trying to get my stuff through
74
Dem white boys giving you a hard time
Nuthin'  can't handle
The truth is never let them seeya sweat
You do that, that's half the battle
Where do you go from here
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina
didn't mean that, in life
In life
'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh
Haven't  always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers
The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless
- Delacroix and Dot are on either side of Junebug as they hold him up
Delacroix struggles to put the key in the door
The door is kicked open as the trio comes in
Junebug is drunk as a skunk
'm not an alcoholic
just like to drink
We know that baby
75
Let's get him over to the bed
Baby, you treat me so good
Peerless, you're a good son,  love you
You never gave me no trouble
They lay him down on the bed
love you too, Daddy
Always keep 'em laughing
Dot takes off his shoes
He's out like a light
Gone
How long has my father been like this
Not that often
He was excited to see you
So he drank himself into a stuper
The drinking is for the pain
It doesn't kill it, just dulls it
So what's up with you
was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and  had never laughed so hard in my life
He asked me to come with him quit my job and we've been together ever since
Delacroix pulls out his billfold and gives Dot five crisp new model hundred dollar bills
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it
Your father is proud of you
76
He never showed it
He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you
Delacroix kisses his sleeping father of the forehead
(') 'll take care of him

- (
) My Daddy
'm not mad at him
Not at all
Junebug was the reason got into this business in the first place

However, it did me no good seeing him in that state
Daddy was a broken man
He had been a strong man, with conviction, integrity, principles and look where it had gotten him

First,  would like to say  love the show
It's very courageous
My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr
King
Why are you here
Good question, straight to the point
like your style
Because of the content of the show we can expect some spirited reactions
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy

Let's get right into it
You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom
Why does your show generate such feelings
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country
Gary,  have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when  get mad
No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be

And  say yes because who is to judge
Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not
Who
Who can play God

Sloan is looking around this boisterous crowd when she sees -' In one of the side boxes
He waves to his sister
She knows her brother and his clan are up to no good as the house lights go black
Honeycutt walks out on stage
The audience goes crazy
Thank you so very much
Show me some love
He laughs
(') Thank you
My name is Honeycutt and  want to welcome you to a very special evening
It's always great coming back to the World Famous Apollo Theatre
The audience applauds
(') As everybody knows if you can make it here on this stage in front of the most discriminating audience in the world you can make it anywhere
Ladies and gentlemen, let's show some real Uptown love for Mantan The Marvelous
The curtain goes up and Mantan the Marvelous stands there, arms raised
He starts to do his thing
107
- Led by Big Black, they start shouting insults at Mantan
Mantan is a pro, he doesn't stop
In fact, this makes him dance harder and harder
She leaves her seat and goes to stop her brother
Mantan is moving and grooving
The unrest in the audience has picked up
They start to "boo
"  The tide has turned
Encouraged, the Mau-Mau's pick it up another notch
He's human after all, and he does hear the boos
Don't let those athletes in the papers fool you
You hear the boos and nobody, nobody except Dennis Rodman likes to be booed
Mantan is getting rattled
-' Sloan rushes into the box and they are quiet
They don't have to say or shout a thing
The rough Apollo crowd is doing it all themselves
The sister and big brother look at each other
There is no love between them
This doesn't change a thing will still love him
Big Black can't believe what he has just heard
Now projectiles are raining down upon Mantan
This has turned into a , a , a
Honeycutt races onto the stage to pull off the still tap dancing Mantan as the Harlem natives  the stage 108
-' Mantan, led by Honeycutt, runs for his life
They chase him
Mantan is hauling ass
The door crashes open, Mantan rockets out into an open car door
The door slams
- The car spins away
- Delacroix is behind the wheel
This is the most shaken we've seen Mantan to date
Pull ya self together
Mantan is distraught
(') What are you
man or a mouse
Are you a punk
Punking out on me
No
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece
109
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost
Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat
'knowwhatI'msayin'
Yeah
And now is definitely not the time to bitch up
- Delacroix speeds away
- Mantan is on the  show with host
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan
Thanks for coming in
Tavis, thank you for having me
Before we begin,  want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview
You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here
'm more comfortable around my people
Let's jump right into it
Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue
How do you see all of this
Yo, Tavis, check it out
This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money
Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins
" 110
Money and nothing else
Money makes the world go round
It ain't no joke being poor
know whatI'mtalkin''bout
'knowwhatI'msayin'
've lived on the street
've been homeless
've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game
Is it inevitable that the game plays you
No if you go with the flow, Tavis
That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand
Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing
If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it
Or better yet write your own show
Do it better
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort
don't know what a retort is, but it's simple
Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem
This is America
Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else
'm not gonna box myself in
This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time
admit, that's a very hard thing to do
Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, 125% 125%  - -
() 111
(') Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn
Go 'head
(
) Microphone check, one, two
One, two
Yo Tavis,  be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul
Why you perpetrating
You a sellout
That's our opinion
(
) You're a traitor to the race tool for the Caucasoids
Why
Because 'm successful
Because  don't use "Causcasoids" as an excuse for not fulfilling my dreams
(
) ain't hearing all dat noise
You getting played and you don't even know it
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do
(
) What do  do
What do you do
(
) 'm a revolutionary
That's a job
(
) That's a full time job, especially when sellouts like you are running around, acting insane
That's enough
112
(
) And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there
We can all agree to disagree without making threats
'  - Sloan turns off the
Why'd you do that
don't want to hear it
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out
You're the one that put us together
We're friends
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so
He's just playing big brother
Oh, is he
You getting jiggy with Mantan
Please don't go there
Dunwitty and  feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up
can't lie to him
If he asks me something,  tell him what  think
Do you have to be so damn forthright
113
DeLa, you should try it sometime
Come into the light
Light
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light
This bucket of blood
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody
know where  made my big mistake
have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you
- Delacroix and Sloan are taking off their clothes
This is crazy
That's why it will be so much fun
They kiss, fall half undressed upon the motel bed
: '  - That was a mistake, but  don't regret it
The first and only time
big mistake
'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore
Work related or otherwise
114
Otherwise
trust you know the difference
You're an intelligent woman, finished at
DeLa, kiss my big black ass
And that's how you got me in the first place
Sloan pulls a 3/4 inch cassette out of her bag and hands it to him
want you to please view this
It may save your Life
'  - Mantan and Delacroix are in the middle of a heated discussion
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan
What you did is dead wrong
Oh, is it
Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired
Sloan is the hardest working person 've ever met
Let me ask you a question, if  may
How do you think she got the job in the first place
don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity
don't believe it
Do  have to spell it out for you
In fact, go ask Sloan yourself
115
'   - Mantan is grilling Sloan
How did you get this gig
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position
You leave something out
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant
And
And what
Stop playing me Sloan
Just ask me what you want to know
Oh, you gonna make me say it
Say what, Manray
Did you ever sleep with DeLa
We did it one time, only once
It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid
Everything 've got 've earned
Aw, c'mon
That's ancient history
That has nothing to do with you and
116
So you say
Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela
Work it to the top
never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "
"  'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa
Don't try to change to the subject
Why don't you answer
know  won't be your puppet
You can go now
wuz leaving anyway, for good

1/16TH Yo,  got da bomb plan
We gonna hook homeslice Mantan up nicely
He holds up a floppy disk
'  - Delacroix sits behind the desk
He's bought even more Black Collectibles, he's surrounded by them

When are you coming up here to see your mother
Soon
Delacroix hangs up the phone
He takes out some change from his pocket and puts a quarter in the hand of his Jolly Nigger Bank
Delacroix flips the lever and the quarter flies into the as the  roll to the top of its

Delacroix does this several times
of the in the office
Delacroix is staring at the  when its  , a quarter flies in and its  roll to the top of its
He is incredulous
(
) (') When  thought or imagined that my favorite Jolly Nigger Bank, an inanimate object, a piece of cold, cast iron, was moving by itself
Delacroix slowly, carefully approaches the bank and picks it off the table
(
) (') knew  was getting paranoid
Did  really see what  saw or was buggin'
It's stopped moving

Honeycutt, 'm a really real niggress
Stacy gets a standing ovation

Delacroix

Dunwitty looks at him

You better talk to him
He won't listen to me

Let's do the taping
You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up

122
Cousins,  want all of you to go to your windows
Go to your windows and yell, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised amd battered bodies
'm sick and tired of being a nigger and 'm not gonna take it anymore
Black and white
Male and female
Young and old
All in black face
He collapses onto the stage and the  sits on their hands
Manray gets up and begins to dance
Dunwitty runs to Bunning
Drop the curtain
Drop the curtain
Bunning drops the curtain
Security rushes onto the stage and grabs Manray
(') Escort him out the building now

But you are finished
Done
Nigga's like you are a dime a dozen
'm gonna slide Honeycutt right into ya spot
We won't miss a step
Get him outta here
The security guards move Manray as Dunitty glares at Delacroix
Honeycutt is all smiles, he's being bumped to the top
(') DeLa, 'll deal with you next
123
The security guards toss Manray out the stage door
Manray looks down the alley and it's empty except for a parked
He picks himself up and does a joyous dance
This is Manray's dance of Freedom
The Big Black Chevy Suburban creeps down the alley to a dancing Manray and comes to rest right in front of him
Manray tries to shield his eyes from the hi-beam headlights
Whaddup
No one comes out
(') Whaddup
The doors open and the Mau-Mau's file out
You truly are a dancing fool
1/16TH Yo Black, you looking for trouble
Don't start none, won't be none
The Mau-Mau's are dying laughing
Manray tries to walk through them
They block him
Manray attempts to climb over the suburban
He's quickly nabbed, give a good ole Brooklyn Beatdown, then thrown into the rear of the vehicle
- The Mau-Mau Mobile rolls up to an abandoned factory
The Mau-Mau's quickly carry Manray out from the back of the vehicle into the factory
- Manray sits, feet and hands tied, in the middle of a cavernous space
digital video camera stands on a tripod in front of him
You is one dead nigger
124
What did  do
What did you do
The Mau-Mau's laugh
(') Brothers, he asks what did he do
If you don't know there is nuthin' we can do for you
Nigga, you will be executed
His face says he can't believe this is happening
For singing and dancing
1/16TH You will be done in front of the world
The whole world will be watching
1/16TH Via the internet
(
) The Mau-Mau's had come up with a brilliant, sadistic plan to broadcast Mantan's execution over the internet
1/16TH We have pirated broadcasting facilities
No way we can be found out
We're in cyberspace
Nobody will find you till it's too late
Various newsrooms, computer screens, people running, shouting, yelling over phones
125
(

It was an invite to witness the Dance of Death, 9 , prime time, tomorrow night on a site to be designated at a later date
- Delacroix and Cheeba are being interrogated in two adjoining spaces
seeing them through the two-way mirrors

We know you're involved in this abduction
- You know more than me
Why would do something like that to my best friend
Why
#2 You tell us
- It's a mob scene as the media frenzy heightens
Delacroix and Cheeba try to fight their way through the print and broadcast journalists trying to question them as they leave headquarters
(
) Somehow, someway, somebody had tipped the sharks off
It was a feeding frenzy
Delacroix and Cheeba start pushing people out of the way as they get in to their waiting car
126
-   - There is a flurry of activity - people man phones, computers all -
(
) The -Force was brought onto the case
When something involves the internet, these are the people , , the , , even the Government go to

It reads "6  16
" Police squads,  Teams are busting into the wrong homes, apartments, projects, hi-tech computer labs looking for the Mau-Mau's
(
) teams all up and down the East Coast busted in on known dissidents looking for Manray
All the tips called in, info gathered through surveillance proved for naught
- The both of you should go home
We will keep you abreast
This is looking like a needle in a haystack
It's hopeless
Delacroix holds Sloan as he leads her out
She is having difficulty breathing with her asthma
Thank you for your help
The -Force always gets their man

The Mau-Mau's shoot at the feet of Manray
Dance nigger
Manray taps
You got anything to say for yourself
If you're gonna kill me, kill me
Don't worry
'  - She is having an asthma attack, it was brought on by the proceedings
Sloan uses her inhaler
- Each Mau-Mau has a 9mm and is firing it at the feet of Manray
They scream "Faster
" and "Dance
" Manray is hoofing
He's never tapped this fast, at this breakneck pace, ever
But it's evident his dance is one of defiance
He's not dancing to stay alive
'  - He screams at the monitor
Don't dance
Don't do it
The Mau-Mau's have noticed Manray's strong will, his pride and they don't like it
They shoot even more at his feet
You ain't Blak
Blak you ain't

You a Oreo
Not Blak
Not
The Mau-Mau's start to chant, "Blak, blak, blak
" ' She hears this and quickly picks up the phone to call the authorities
There is nothing you can do to me
'm wearing the taps of Bill "Bojangles" Robinson
Manray is shot in one foot
Then the other
Let's seeya dance now, Mr
Bojangles
Manray somehow manages to right himself and starts to dance again
The Mau-Mau's can't believe it
He dances like his life depends on it
Despite the fact his feet are a bloody mess
(') You ain'
He shoots Manray in the chest, the Mau-Mau's follow him and he does a spastic last jig as the 9mm bullets riddle his twitching body
It goes black
Helicopters fly through the night sky
Cop cars and trucks, team vehicles are on the move
' Delacroix's head is on his desk
He has been crying
On cue the Black Collectibles start to move
The Jolly Nigger Bank, Aunt Jemima's, Mammies, etc

He too is in In a rage, he starts to throw them against the wall
Leave me alone
Get away from me
You spearchucker
You black sambo
You nigger pickaninny
Fat Mammie
Delacroix has finally lost it
He looks at the shambles he's made of his office
- The Mau-Mau's come out of the factory high as a kite
Each has a big fat joint or a 64 oz
of
They're also doing a free-style rap about their execution
They get in when the squak of police walkie-talkie's clicks
It's the man
What follows is a horrifying display of firepower
All the Mau-Mau's bodies are doing the Bonnie and Clyde Sonny Corleone Dance of Death as bullets tear into them and the Suburban
Not one of them is able to get a shot off
The shooting stops
The twitching stops
All's quiet
1/16th Black comes out with his hands up
1/16TH Don't shoot
Don't shoot

It's Sloan and she has a gun in one hand and her inhaler in the other
She's wheezing like mad
Get up and put that tape in

She points the gun at his head
(') Do what  say
Delacroix takes the cassette tape off his desk and puts it in the 3/4 inch desk
(') Don't make me have to use this
didn't think this was in your studies at
Delacroix hits the  button
Sloan has put together a tape of the worst, most racist, stereotypical images from cinema and  over the last 100 years
With these images there's also a laugh-track
Watch this
This is what you contributed to
Because of you, Manray is dead
Mu brother's dead
It's all because of you
Delacroix can't watch the monitor
'm sorry
didn't know anyone would get hurt
'm sorry, please give me that gun before you hurt yourself
Give me the gun
He reaches for it
Sloan screams

You never listened to me
Give me the gun
She reluctantly hands it to him

Go home
Sloan runs out
Delacroix slumps to the floor, off the revolver

He looks at the monitor, the tape still playing
