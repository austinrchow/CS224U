Drake Berlin
Season is March
Action of the picture takes place in approximately 36 hours
Picture commences at approximately 12:35 in the day
Time: The Present
Show general natural action of people going in and people coming out but in it is the definite inference of people arriving and people leaving the big hotel
-- very quickly like a human being, seeing and hearing
: Clock
It is twenty minutes to one -- and then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid-day business jumble
pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the steps that lead up to the restaurant
In its journey, it passes Kringelein looking up
He is not pointed
then saunters -- getting a slow profile movement across -- near Senf's desk
Senf is very busy now passes -- profile -- the desk of Senf
General action
Senf stands before his background of slots and keys until we are facing the elevator
At that moment the elevator is opening
Among the people who emerge is Suzette, who moves too quickly for us to distinguish who she is
quickly with her and in the distance we hear her saying to Senf: Madam Grusinskaya will not want her car
This line is only just above the general clatter of action but it is picked-up sharply first by Senf then by Bell-Captain -- and as the    , we see the boy going towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance, saying: Cancel Madam Grusinskaya's car
The  now backs away from the scene into the
(a section
) It backs to the back of the bar and proceeds -- in profile -- behind the backs of the barmen
mixed crowd of people drinking before their lunch
We pick up the Doctor, leaning his head upon his hands, looking into space
The woman next to him, a noisy blonde, is laughing
The doctor glances up at her -- she glances at the doctor
She and the audience see the scarred side of his face -- the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to her companion, who is the Baron
We do not get much of a chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at his watch, his shoulders are turning away from and he moves out towards the lobby
a few feet and   as you move into the main aisle of busy room in restaurant
Great activity of waiters
The bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime string orchestra is playing
Among other things, we pick up the smiling face of the pompous Maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone important to a table
watches his face and follows him
His face just as  reaches service table
The pompous Maitre d'hotel now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter: ' Where is that gentleman's soup
The waiter, frightened and perspiring, doesn't bother to argue -- he tears off quickly (  ) to another service table
The waiter seizes buss-boy's arm: Where's that soup
Boy goes off at great rate of speed,   , into service room of kitchen
Boy stops at soup chef's counter
He is not the only waiter wanting soup at that moment
He pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket forward
Quick -- come on -- come on
The soup chef, used to impatient waiters, makes no exception of the young man
He looks at him as much as to say: "'ll slap you on the mouth
" At the same time he is pulling over a cauldron of soup
: being pulled over -- it dislodges a small cauldron that is near the edge
We see the soup fall and hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face -- She has been scalded
General steamy confusion
The chef has filled the plate
the buss-boy out
Half way down the aisle, the waiter takes it from him
follows the waiter who places the soup before Mr
Preysing
Preysing has been waiting, with his serviette carefully tucked in his collar
His spoon is in his hand horrible man, ready for action
The soup is in front of him, he tastes it, pushes it away, frowns, we feel he is going to tear the place down
(anxious voice) Yes
(grimly) Cold
(near Preysing's elbow) Mr
Preysing
(in same voice) Yes
Telephone -- from Fredersdorf -- Preysing rises, struts from restaurant
-- He walks out through the door
: Between two operators heads
Odd effect at board as Preysing's head looks right down at girl
Bellboy is with Preysing
Mr
Preysing from Fredersdorf -- his call
Yes, Mr
Preysing -- Preysing begins drumming his fingers on the top of switchboard
(nervously) They've gone -- Just a moment, sir
(to boy) You told me it was on -- you said the call was through
(he waits irritably) (to first) Who's in number three
Senf -- the hall porter
(Girl looks off at
) : Yes, it's Senf, the head porter, Grand Hotel
Are you at the Clinic

,
Patience
It's easy for you to talk
Get away
,
No, can't -- 'd lose my job
It's like being in jail
Oh,  hope the child comes along all right
At the conclusion of Senf's speech, Thru the glass door we see Preysing approaching from desk
He enters booth and commences conversation: Hello
Long Distance

Oh

Suzette is already in the booth and she is waiting for Mr
Meierheim to come on
(starting to speak) Hello, Mr
Meierheim

Meierheim
This is Suzette
Suzette, Madam Grusinskaya's maid
No
Madam Grusinskaya will not go to the rehearsal
No
Madam is in a terrible state, she didn't sleep all night -- She's very tired
No, 'm speaking from a booth --  didn't want to speak in front of her gave her a tablet of veronal
She's sleeping now
You had better come to the hotel, 'm afraid
just entering booth
He is lighting a cigarette
(receiver down - trick) (speaking into telephone) Baron Gaigern speaking
Yes, Baron Gaigern himself
Where are you
,
Good
No -- first,  need money need it right now

That's my business hope to do it tonight

But money -- for the hotel bill, for tips

Now, listen

Who is that, This is
Hello, hello
Who is that
Heinrich
This is Kringelein
Hello, Heinrich
This is Otto Kringelein
Hello
Can you hear me
've got to speak very quickly
Every minute costs two marks ninety
What
Otto Kringelein
Yes, 'm in Berlin, staying at the best hotel, the Grand Hotel
No, don't you understand want to explain, but  must do so quickly, it costs so much
Please don't interrupt me -- hello
Hello
Listen
You know that will  made before my operation
gave it to you
want you to tear it up
Destroy it
Because, listen,  came to Berlin to see a great specialist about that old trouble of mine
It's pretty bad, Heinrich
The specialist says can't live much longer
(louder) haven't long to live
That's what's the matter
Hello, hello
Are you on the line
No, it isn't nice to be told a thing like that
All sorts of things run through your head
am going to stay here in Berlin
am never coming back to Fredersdorf
Never
want to get something out of life, too
You plague, and bother, and save -- and all of a sudden you are dead
Heinrich
You don't say anything
am in the Grand Hotel, do you understand, the most expensive hotel in Berlin
'm going to get a room here
The very best people stay here
Our big boss, Preysing, too saw him -- not five minutes after was here
Sometime, 'd like to tell him exactly what  think of him
Listen, Heinrich --  have taken all my savings; my life insurance, too; cashed in all my policies, the sick benefit fund, the old age pension, the unemployment insurance, the burial fund and everything
What's that, miss
Hello, Heinrich
have to hang up now
have to pay three times overcharge
Just think, Heinrich
There's music here all day long
And in the evening, they go around in full dress
Yes, sometimes have pain, but  can stand it
Everything is frightfully expensive here
You can imagine, the Grand Hotel
What
Time's up
Near the conclusion of Kringelein's speech, we see the Doctor approaching through Kringelein's booth
He is looking down at something
: -   - Doctor is looking down at parcel
Kringelein's voice on same track
Show doctor as he passes various booths -- voices of respective people come up sharply
'm a sick man -- Heinrich -- Hello - hello -- Operator -- every minute two marks ninety
Doctor passes Baron's booth next
Dangerous
That's my business
'll do it tonight --
'll do it alone
Doctor passes Suzette's booth
Madam is afraid -- she will never dance again -- there was no applause last night -- Doctor passes Preysing's booth
Yes -- the merger -- Manchester -- it is my business as much as yours -- we've already lost eighty-five thousand -- Doctor passes Senf's booth
'm on duty --  can't leave the Grand Hotel -- it's like being in prison -- the baby -- Doctor crosses to telephone operator: (to operator) Any calls
No, Doctor
(half to himself) Grand Hotel -- people -- coming -- going
Who cares
nothing ever happens
"#1" showing electric sign -- odd angle --    -- unlighted
: small section -- Engineer pulling down lever
sign flashes on
: : Shooting directly on swinging door -- normal crowd action
Tea-dansant at this hour is daily rendezvous for smart demi- mondaines, gigolos, out-of-town travelers, etc
-- These types indicated
In the distance we hear music
: - This same music is being played by the Eastman Jazz Band in the Yellow Room of the hotel
does not wait but backs down the room
It is the hour of the tea-dansant
As the        which is in reality the restaurant converted -- the tall figure of the Baron -- he proceeds through the door of the restaurant -- Note: Question here as to whether Yellow Room will be the restaurant converted, or not
In which case it will be necessary to add scene of Baron walking through corridor upstairs -- giving sense of distance
The Baron is whistling the tune of the orchestra, he proceeds through the lobby as if on a mission
He glances at a pretty woman who passes and nods good evening to the Doctor, who is seated in his chair, not far from the desk
He enters
: Pretty girl is there, she has seen him coming
She turns from the door and hands him a box of orchids, already tied in ribbon
Good little girl -- nice ones
Yes, Baron
The Baron would stay and flirt but he has a mission; he leaves
: In the lobby we pick up the Baron leaving the florists with small box of flowers -- he crosses quickly to Senf's desk
'  as the Baron puts the flowers down
Senf is busy
The Baron is whistling gaily -- tapping his fingers on the flower box -- he is good-natured and patient
(to Clerk -- as telephone bell rings) Is that for me
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought
(he replaces the receiver) (to one of the bellboys) Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought
Boy leaves
We hear his voice out of scene at the door
' Madam Grusinskaya's car
to be brought
Good evening, Baron
(amiably) Good evening
Will you send these up to Madam Grusinskaya
Yes, Baron
(he hands the box of flowers to the clerk) Madam Grusinskaya
Clerk hands box to bellboy
Room one-seventy -- Madam Grusinskaya
(to Senf) Have you my tickets for the theatre
Oh yes, Baron -- (to Clerk) Baron von Gaigern's seats for Madam Grusinskaya
Telephone rings again
Clerk picks it up
(to Clerk) For me
(at telephone -- shakes his head) No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought
(to boy) Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought
The Clerk hands Senf the tickets which Senf hands to the Baron
Charge them
As the Baron is picking up his tickets he looks around quickly as he hears the voice of Pimenov, who has arrived apparently from his afternoon walk from the rehearsal at the theatre
(to Senf) Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight
Good evening, Mr
Pimenov
Oh -- good evening, Baron
How's the beautiful lady
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous
Were you at the theatre last night
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances
Well -- last night was not so good
thought she was splendid
Yes -- but the audience
At that moment they are interrupted by a vehement little Japanese with his wife
They are arguing with the Clerk
The Japanese speaks in Japanese to his wife
(to Japanese) The parquot loges are behind the parquet chairs
Then they've put me back and  want to be up in front
How is that, chairs in front of loges
Senf is speaking to a lady at the same time
The train leaves at seven-thirty, Madam
That is the only through train -- the dining car goes along
The Baron and Pimenov exchange glances as the little Japanese speaks volubly to his wife
(sarcastically) It's always so quiet here
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby
My dear sir,  would gladly change rooms with you
(effeminately) No doubt you would, Baron
But do you know, 'm quite indispensable to her
'm her ballet master and her nurse
hardly belong to myself anymore
But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her
At that moment, Zinnowitz pushes past them
Pardon me
(addressing Senf) Is Mr
Preysing in --  am Doctor Zinnowitz
(to bellboy) Mr
Preysing -- from Fredersdorf -- (quickly -- paging) Mr
Preysing -- Preysing steps quickly into scene
Ach
Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz
Have  kept you waiting
Waiting -- 'm waiting for news from Manchester
No news yet
No
No word
Everything depends on the Manchester merger
know --  know
saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer  made it my business to broach the matter --- As they begin to move out of scene, Zinnowitz calls back to Senf
'm expecting a young woman -- a stenographer -- she will ask for Mr
Preysing
Ask her to wait
Yes, Doctor Zinnowitz
As they move out of scene, telephone bell goes
(to Clerk) For me
No -- letters to two-eighty
(to Clerk) If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc
This just covers the scene
The Baron and Pimenov are laughing at something one of them has said which brings our attention to them again
At that moment the Doctor enters the scene
Any letters
No, Doctor
Telegrams
No, Doctor
Anyone asked for me
Nobody, Doctor
The Doctor turns slowly away, taking out a cigarette with his one hand
(glancing at Doctor) The war
(looking up from his letter -- glances off at the doctor) That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes
The war dropped him here and forgot him
(beams) Yes,  was in the war
:    -- He turns as he hears the Baron say this
He pulls at his cigarette and looks grimly at the Baron
then he looks off at Kringelein -- who is trying to get Rohna's attention (the reception Clerk) -- at the reception desk, which adjoins that of Senf's
' Please -- please pay some attention to me --  have no time
Pan back to desk: (engaged with a lady and gentleman, who have just arrived) If you will wait one moment, sir
won't wait --  can't wait -- waited three days before  got a room at all and what a room that is
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir
Did  say  wanted a cheap room to live in -- when  came here did ask for a cheap room
Did
Rohna, sensing a scene with this strange dirty little gentleman, looks furtively around for the manager
Just one moment, sir
No,  won't wait --  can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute
Second Clerk is looking straight at him
Kringelein turns his attention directly to this man and proceeds: came here because  wanted to live here, two weeks, maybe three -- God only knows -- 've told you 'll pay -- 'll pay anything you ask
'm tired -- 'm ill --  can't wait
As he finishes the Doctor draws into the scene -- he is watching
Assistant Manager enters
Has the gentleman a complaint
Rohna and Kringelein speak together
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine
certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one
He senses an audience and warms up
The Baron and Pimenov enter the scene
The lady and gentleman have turned
The bellboy stands watching curiously and even Senf pauses and looks up
(continuing) came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel
want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- 'm as good as Mr
Preysing --  can pay like Mr
Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang
(he bangs at the desk with his fist) This gentleman can have my room
(turning) Oh
Send his bags up to my room
Oh -- but --  -- You're tired
can see that
Yes -- yes --  am tired
have been ill
You are ill
During this scene the manager has been talking with Rohna quietly
The manager how turns
Mr
Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms
It is large and on the front with bath
(subdued -- exhausted --) Does that mean that the bath is my own
--- Private
Certainly, sir
Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks
That's what  want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what  want
can pay now if you like
He takes out his wallet and nervously commences to extract money
That will not be necessary
The manager is instructing the bellboy to take Kringelein to the new room
Kringelein accidentally drops a bill -- the Baron, who has noticed the money, stoops to pick it up
In bending himself, Kringelein drops his hat
Baron picks up the hat and considerately brushes it with his sleeve
Thank you, sir
(amused) Not at all, sir
(he beams) (finding a friendly face) Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf
'm Baron von Gaigern
Oh, a Baron
(he is impressed) Baron catches the mood of making this gentleman suddenly popular
And this is Doctor Otternschlag
(turning to Doctor) Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- am -- know --  know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- know he is ill
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- (his finger goes nervously to his collar) Zinnowitz passes through scene quickly on his way out
At that moment, Pimenov returns from the news-stand, where he has bought the evening papers
Well, Baron --  must go and dress
(to doctor) Is this gentleman a Baron, too
(laughing) Unfortunately no
The Manager comes into scene
Will Mr
Kringelein kindly register
Again
Please
Kringelein turns to the desk
The Doctor turns up with him
At that moment the Baron's chauffeur touches his arm
Have you a minute now
No --  told you not to come in this lobby
Time's getting short
've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth
Chauffeur takes the cigarette out of his mouth -- but still holds it in his hand
want to speak -- Not now
Yes, sir
The Baron leaves
General moving off, towards elevator, of Baron, Pimenov, Kringelein and the Doctor
' On another shot, shooting profile onto Senf's desk, bring in Flaemmchen
Flaemmchen enters
Her back to
(we hear her ask) Mr
Preysing
Will you wait please
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr
Preysing telephoned
Mr
Preysing -- one sixty-four
Thanks -- (calling off to elevator) Heigh
-- Wait
She crosses to elevator
, As she enters the elevator and the gate shuts, she turns around, back pressed against the Baron -- who is looking down at her
The look on her face is the look we often see on Flaemmchen's in elevators when they are pressed
: Good introduction, for Flaemmchen
The lift ascends
Flaemmchen steps out of the lift
She is looking around for the numbers
She moves out of scene
The Doctor, Kringelein and the bellboy with the bag, move straight down the hall
Pimenov is chatting volubly
(to Baron) Poor Grusinskaya -- how can she receive anyone
She can't -- theatre, trains, hotels -- hotels, trains theatre
We see Flaemmchen being directed by the floor clerk to Mr
Preysing's room
(continuing) must go and dress -- she'll be waking up and calling for me
He proceeds up the passage, pompously, humming the air of his ballet
At that moment, Flaemmchen, who has been directed to Preysing's door, by floor clerk, passes the Baron and there is an amusing exchange of glances between them
Flaemmchen knocking at Preysing's door hears a voice
' Come in
She opens the door
: ' Preysing has had a bath and is actually steaming from it
He stands before a long mirror, rubbing himself with a towel
He sees her through the mirror, wraps the towel around him very cutely, for a big man, and turns upon her
What
-- 'm the stenographer
Then you will please wait outside
He is very much affronted
Flaemmchen, who has seen many large gentlemen in the altogether -- (lightly) Don't hurry -- take your time
She goes out of the room and shuts the door
: Flaemmchen emerges from Preysing's room
Baron loitering in the hall
(Whistling as outlined)
Baron approaches, he is also whistling -- the same tune that Flaemmchen is whistling
She glances at him, as he continues whistling with an amusing dance step, as much as to say: "Are you mad
" Like dancing
Not with strangers
Baron glances back up the passage; it is apparent that he is going to make conversation here with this girl, in order to keep legitimately in the passage until Grusinskaya comes out
(turning to Flaemmchen) Never
You're a fool
Yes,  am rather
He glances down the passage again, his hands in his pockets
She glances impatiently at her watch
He must be very nice
Who
(gallantly) Whoever is keeping you waiting
(indicating Preysing's door) Have you seen it
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really
That
(indicating Preysing's door) That
(with meaning) You
(quickly) Oh -- work
(with meaning) Oh
Dictation
(she twittles her fingers) You know
Oh
poor child
If you were free, 'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but -- Tea would spoil my dinner
(lightly) One meal a day, 'd hate to spoil it
Reducing
(she turns invitingly) No -- why
-- should
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day
(laughing in his face) Money -- Ever heard of it
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a
(moves fingers) a stenographer
Don't little stenographers earn little pennies
Very little
Too bad
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on
-- One that she'd bought herself
Poor child -- (enthusiastically) wish  were free tonight -- we could -- (with invitation) Aren't you
(quickly) What
Free -- (glancing up passage) Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though
Tomorrow
What time tomorrow
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs
Where downstairs
Yellow Room where they dance -- (business) You're very funny -- (with great meaning) Yes
-- Tomorrow
Of course
Really
Flaemmchen laughs at him
We'll dance
(slowly) All right
We'll dance
At that moment we hear Kringelein's voice calling from his doorway at the end of the passage
' Baron -- Oh, Baron
The Baron turns and looks off at --- Kringelein is in his door in the distance -- radiant
He waves
If  could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room
have ordered champagne
Perhaps the Baroness could join us
: , Waiter, oh waiter
Wait a minute
(to Baron and Flaemmchen) We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- see the Baroness is laughing
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me
At that moment Grusinskaya's door opens suddenly and Suzette comes out into the hall
Ssshh
Please
Madam is asleep
Oh
By this time the others are entering Kringelein's room
The Baron turns back for a moment
(calling back quietly to Suzette) Asleep
-- Ssshhh -- sorry
Suzette turns back into the room
: ' It is typical hotel
Half-open trunks, etc
Curtains are drawn -- room is in semi-darkness
There is a sense of silence, except for distant music coming from the Yellow Room below
In Suzette's hands we see one of Grusinskaya's ballet slippers which she has been mending
She is about to tiptoe to her seat when she stops suddenly and looks off dramatically at
Shot from her angle
She is sleeping beneath a Chinese robe, on the chaise-lounge
Apparently she has changed her position, because the hand which is outside the robe moves
The , as though it were Suzette, moves up towards Grusinskaya
Her eyes are closed
Suzette crosses to the chaise-lounge and is looking down
Grusinskaya's eyes open suddenly
She looks at the ceiling and then her eyes turn and look straight at Suzette
' (quietly and reverently -- almost a whisper) Madam has slept well
No,  have been awake -- thinking -- thinking
' It is time for the performance
The performance
It is time
Like a soldier called to attention Grusinskaya sits suddenly upright -- Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance
(she pauses and droops suddenly) think, Suzette,  have never been so tired in my life
(she takes the bottle of veronal which is nearby) Veronal didn't even help me to sleep
(laughs a little) (speaking into telephone) Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought
While she is speaking Grusinskaya rises -- with the grace of a dancer she picks up the Chinese robe that has fallen to the floor and although there is only one other woman in the room -- she holds the robe around her
She crosses to the mirror and looks at her face, running her fingers through her hair
She gently massages under her eyes and the  sees Grusinskaya for the first time
There is silence in the room -- neither of the women speak
Suzette gets madam's clothes ready
She crosses, puts the case of pearls down on the dressing table and opens them
Grusinskaya looks into space -- silence -- dead silence
Suzette kneels as if to put Madam's stockings on for her
Grusinskaya pulls her foot away
can't dance tonight -- It will pass -- it will pass -- come
Let us cancel the engagement
But, Madam
cannot do that
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely
feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough
She leans forward against the dressing-table and her hands unconsciously touch the pearls
(very quietly) The peals are cold -- everything is cold -- finished -- it seems so far away -- so threadbare -- the Russians -- St
Petersburg -- the Imperial Court -- the Grand Duke Sergei -- (long pause as though she were reliving incidents of the past) -- Sergei -- dead -- Grusinskaya -- it's all gone
She throws the pearls away, down upon the floor
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break -- The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- hate them
Suzette crosses replacing the pearls
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us
Last night for instance -- Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet
Grusinskaya's eyes are looking off into space -- she is away in Russia -- she does not look -- Telephone rings -- Suzette crosses to telephone
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam
Send it away --  shan't need it
There is a knock at the door -- a certain kind of knock
Come in
She picks up the telephone and as she does so Pimenov enters
Suzette quickly gives Pimenov a signal that there is trouble
As Pimenov is closing the door we hear Grusinskaya speak into telephone
(authoritatively) Madam Grusinskaya will not require her car -- no -- she will not be going to the theatre
(she turns) Pimenov (at heart a clown) makes a grand comedy bow
He will deliberately try to tease Madam out of her mood
She glances at him, without smiling, crosses to the dressing- table and sits
It is time for the performance
(under her breath) The performance -- the performance -- the performance
(during this scene the orchids fall to the floor) It is a hysterical out-burst
It is not a woman who is just temperamental, it is something deeper than that
She is very near a nervous breakdown
We, the audience, must feel with her a revulsion against the word performance
(tenderly -- as he touches her shoulder gently) Poor little Lisevata -- she still has her stage frights -- it will pass
Pimenov kneels by Grusinskaya -- he is chafing her hands, he attempts to soothe her
Now Grusinskaya draws her hands suddenly away
It is not stage fright -- it's something more -- (tenderly) What -- what is it
Last night
Last night
There was no applause
(quickly) There was -- there was
That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few --  was frantic -- finished -- the last beat and
(she reclines her head as the swan finishing the dance) waited --  listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov
We are dead -- it's finished
There is a sudden knocking at the door
Meierheim -- The door opens suddenly
Meierheim bursts into the room
What is this that you have cancelled your car
Who am  that  should wait like a fool at the door
And here on a whim, you cancel your car
Have you forgotten there is a performance
Do you know the time
Or, are we all mad
Am  your manager
Have we a contract
Have we obligations
Am  blind
(glances at his watch) Or is that the time
'm cancelling the engagement
Oh
Business of Pimenov signaling to him
Oh
Madam is cancelling the engagement
Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke
Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on
Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock
The house is jammed to the roof
The house is not full -- Is it really full
Packed to the ceiling
Hurry -- get dressed
And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er -- (to Suzette) Oh -- but it can't be
Oh, come, Madam -- please come
(she holds up her frock) (changed mood) All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry
We will wait
You are late
Hurry
Meierheim goes over to telephone, he picks up receiver and says: Tell Madam Grusinskaya's chauffeur to bring the car
Show few feet of Grusinskaya getting dressed
: Pimenov and Meierheim
Meierheim is pushing the bell
How is the house
Terrible
After this, no more ballets for me
Jazz -- (snaps his fingers) Just jazz
If the house is empty again,  don't know -- When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right know these people
They are walking towards Kringelein's room
They are pacing rather like men who walk the deck on a liner
They turn almost together, but when they turn back past the  the on into Kringelein's room
The to a burst of laughter
Champagne bottles open, caviar, smoke, etc
In the room are the Doctor, Kringelein, the Baron, Flaemmchen, and a very fat waiter -- comedian
You may laugh
Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal
You see, 'm ill and all of a sudden  got a fear of missing life
don't want to miss life -- do you understand
You are funny
You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch
Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute
Let's drink
The Baron offers Flaemmchen a glass of champagne
She shakes her head
'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think
Velvet upholstery -- '-number one'
'm in the textile trade and  know
(he has a slight case of hiccups from the champagne
He touches the drapes) And these are real silk drapes
(amusedly) Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too
(who hasn't stopped talking) Have you seen the bathroom
-- Hot and cold running water -- You see, can get a bath whenever  like
At that moment Preysing's voice is heard calling to the Floor Clerk
The stenographer
Flaemmchen, hearing this, turns and looks off, apparently through the door
Her manner changes, she puts down her glass
Her master's voice
(turns to Baron) must go now -- goodbye -- thanks
Oh, don't go
'm engaged for the evening
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening
To take dictation -- a Mr
Preysing -- (to Baron) Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock
(she is moving out) Kringelein's optimism has left him for a moment, he stands looking out of door undecided, he is drooped suddenly, as though years had returned to him
What's the matter, Mr
Kringelein
(to himself) General Director Preysing
(possibly he turns to Baron) Baron, when  was sixteen years old, started as an office boy in that man's factory -- Then you know him
Do  know him --  know him through and through
They start to leave
Oh, gentlemen, please don't go
must --  hope to see you again, Mr
Kringelein
Baron leaves
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do
have nothing better to do, Mr
Kringelein
They move into the room
: : 24 and 25 Sequence omitted from original script
Pimenov and Meierheim are standing there
Meierheim is pushing the elevator button
The Baron stands near and pauses, he is now a changed man
He looks off as he hears the voice of Grusinskaya, off in the distance
Grusinskaya's Voice Hurry, Suzette
Shot from the Baron's angle
Grusinskaya is sweeping down the corridor, followed by Suzette
: , Perhaps you could present me now, Mr
Pimenov
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is
Grusinskaya sweeps into scene
The Baron leans forward quickly and pushes the bell with a glance at her
They look at each other
He fixes his eyes on her characteristically
She glances at him
This is the first time they have met in the picture
She is impatient
As if to break an awkward silence, she turns to Suzette
My coat
Suzette is carrying the coat over the pearls
As she takes the coat off her arm, Grusinskaya glances down at the jewel case
Suzette --  told you not to bring the pearls
will not wear them tonight
Why not
Take them back, Suzette
You haven't time
Suzette hesitates
Hurry, Suzette
Such nonsense
Suzette toddles off with the pearls
The elevator opens, collects its passengers, all except the Baron and descends
shot of Grusinskaya's eyes as she goes down, glancing up
shot of the reverse of him looking down
The Baron pauses, hesitates, thinks
We are interested in his action
For the first time he becomes furtive
- Music swells up from the Yellow Room
great deal of noise, confusion and activity as the elevator stops to emit Grusinskaya, followed by Pimenov, Meierheim and some other people who are rather excited to be in the elevator with the great Grusinskaya
(off scene) The car for Madam Grusinskaya
The bellboy hears it and passes the word around
It seems to be echoed through the lobby
People turn, as Grusinskaya's spirit seems to rise with the attention she is getting
precedes her through the revolving door, as she sweeps outside of the hotel
The Baron's chauffeur, Schweinke, is seen to watch her go
He looks furtively around and enters the hotel
: - As he watches Suzette returning from Grusinskaya's room
She is about to push lift button - then decides to run downstairs
: "#1" ' Zinnowitz and Preysing are standing by door
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference
Good heavens no
That'd create the very worst impression
You must be optimistic
You must convince them
You know as well as  do that the merger must go through
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But  am used to making my deals on a solid basis
am not a liar
am an honest business man -- a good husband and father --  have a sense of honor --  have nothing to conceal
couldn't live happily otherwise
Well, don't get excited about it
We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through
want to dictate my statement for tomorrow
can't speak without notes
like to have things down before me in black and white
'll see you in the morning then, at the conference
Everything'll be all right, Preysing
Don't worry
Goodnight
Good night
Zinnowitz leaves
"#2" ' We hear the distant voice of Preysing and the keys of the typewriter rattling
The reason for the blackness is that Preysing's back is flat into the camera
His hands are behind his back and his fat fingers are moving restlessly
It is an odd effect
We don't know quite what it is
' Both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages
Preysing moves forward showing that we are in Preysing's room
The change of light shows us plainly the time lapse
Flaemmchen is seated at a small table typing
Preying strides forward As he strides he says: Moreover -- (repeating) Moreover -- Preysing paces the room
(repeating) Moreover -- (he pauses, thinking
Picks up telephone quickly -- into telephone) Is there a telegram for me yet
Oh -- when it does, send it up
During this, Flaemmchen, who is tired sits back and rubs her fingers that have been over-worked
She glances at her wrist- watch
Preysing comes and stands behind Flaemmchen
Now, where was
(he looks over the sheet in her typewriter -- accidentally his arm touches her neck) Oh -- sorry
(he puts his cigar in his mouth and walks away
As he walks away) Where was
As he turns, he catches a down shot on her from behind as she stretches back showing her busts
Seeing his face looking down on her she pulls herself together and seats herself at attention
Moreover
Moreover
It seems a silly kind of lull
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office
No -- only occasional jobs
(she yawns suddenly) Tired
You pay me
You're a very unusual stenographer -- Moreover
Moreover
(as he paces the room, it is obvious that he is trying to collect his thoughts) She looks at him, waits a moment and then begins characteristically to, change the sheet of paper
don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly
don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices
Personally, hate offices -- 'd much rather be in the movies
Movies
Yes,  photograph very well
Look -- She tosses magazine -- as if it were nothing at all over to him
He looks down at it without touching it
What is this
got ten marks for that
He picks it up
You
(without looking up) Me
As he looks at picture -- he lowers his voice two notes
You
(reading) Moreover
(quickly) What
(reading) Only in mutual advantages -- moreover
What brown hands you have
That's from skiing
Skiing
(he holds her hands) (natural -- unabashed) Yes
man  know took me to Switzerland last month
He drops her hand suddenly
man
-- To Switzerland
-- That must have been nice -- for him
(reading) Only in mutual advantages -- moreover
Preysing paces the room trying to get his thoughts back to the work in hand
Moreover
He was a lucky man -- that man
Perhaps
(she waits at attention) He paces back and forth again
Don't misunderstand me
'm a married man -- with grownup daughters
Uh -- Moreover -- Do you mind if  smoke
(she takes cigarette) went to Florence once, too
With the same friend
By this time she is smoking her cigarette
(without looking at him) No
(quickly) Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company
Not too quickly
What
You're a little too fast
Can't you understand me
understand you perfectly
Have you got it now
(typing) Cotton Company -- Should throw a great weight into the balance
(as he turns his back looks at him significantly) weight into the balance
There is a sudden knock at the door
Come in
Boy enters with telegram
Telegram for Mr
Preysing
With almost hysterical speed, Preysing snatches the telegram -- opens it
Flaemmchen powders her nose
it is bad news
He wipes the perspiration from his forehead
Oh -- oh
(he throws the telegram away from him, onto her desk
Paces the room
) Flaemmchen, believing the telegram to be something that she must copy, picks it up quite naturally and reads it
Deal with Manchester Cotton Company definitely off
Preysing turns and snatches the telegram from her
Sorry
Preysing paces the room with the telegram
Flaemmchen rises, stretches
Quite naturally she glances at the pictures on Preysing's dressing-table
How nice -- your daughters
My daughters -- yes, my daughters
(he is talking more to himself) Is that Mrs
Preysing
(to himself) Definitely off
Oh -- too bad
Did you quarrel
(she is looking at picture of Mrs
Preysing) (turns, speaks quickly -- definitely) That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock
(he turns, goes out onto balcony with telegram) Flaemmchen, delighted and with alacrity, crosses, piles up her papers and is prepared to leave
: Trim Flaemmchen out of Preysing's room
Take her down to elevator
At the same time,    and shows the Baron's chauffeur knocking at the Baron's door
' (calling) Come in
Trim the chauffeur into the Baron's room
' Baron is busy changing his clothes
Chauffeur steps in, he closes the door behind him and stands there with an inquisitive look
You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre
(very nonchalantly) Well
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know
(very nonchalantly) Yes
(ready to explode) And what are you going to do
The pearls are in her room
(threateningly) Now listen to me
The others are getting suspicious of you
was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared
've been careful, 've been waiting my chance
You've been waiting your chance
You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you
told you 'll get the pearls tonight
Need any help
No
Have you got that skeleton key
He takes the skeleton key out of his pocket and produces it to the Baron
No -- Why
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything --- (contemptuously) could take care of her
How
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you
No -- no -- no -- no
Why
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache
know -- had it in the war
Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but -- You're no good for this business
It's just a joke to you
(swings suddenly on him) don't like your tone
(comes up to him -- face to face) No -- Baron is suddenly seized with uncontrollable temper -- twists his wrists -- backs him to door, speaks quietly
Get out and leave it to me
be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam
With the pearls
With the pearls -- The Chauffeur leaves
The moment he is gone -- Baron looks the door -- business ad lib
Crosses to window
The Baron peeps out onto balcony -- it seems to be clear
He proceeds along and peeps into Preysing's room
Preysing is apparently in the bathroom
Baron skips nimbly past the room
Working at thrill of pass through to Grusinskaya's room
' Baron is pretty shaken by jump
: ' Darkness -- light from transom and building opposite
Business of finding key and getting pearls
Preysing coming out onto his balcony, bringing out with him, loud speaker of radio -- which announces noisily as follows: 'You are listening to the music of the Eastman Jazz Band, in the famous Yellow Room of the Grand Hotel
' : ' Baron starts suddenly -- when he hears voice and with pearls in his hand, looks cautiously out of window -- only to see: : ' : Preysing seating himself upon his balcony -- Radio loud speaker seen
Possibly Preysing commences dinner scene bullying waiter
' The Baron knows he is trapped, if he jumps onto Preysing's balcony, Preysing is the man that will cause the alarm
Quickly he moves across the room -- tries the door -- it is locked securely
He looks for skeleton key and then remembers refusing it from the chauffeur
He is trapped in an absurd way
As he moves back from the door, he knocks the telephone off of the table
He watches it for a moment, realizing that the operator must now know that there is someone in Grusinskaya's room
He picks up the telephone, replaces the receiver, wipes finger prints off with his handkerchief
He is moving back to window when telephone starts to ring suddenly
The thought crosses his mind they they will want to know who is in the room
He lets the telephone ring
Crosses to the door again
Above the din of the telephone we hear the chambermaid's voice singing an absurd song
He listens
She is coming in
The key turns in the door
Quickly he hides behind the curtains
Slowly and amusingly the chambermaid, tired and dragging, enters the room
He is looking for an opportunity to dash through the door
After all, this maid should be an easy person to get around
We have a feeling he wishes to dash through the door
The chambermaid might be singing the same tune that we hear from Preysing's radio
The telephone commences ringing
Chambermaid does not answer it but continues her duties
At last, because of the noise of the telephone, she picks it up and speaks
No -- no -- there is no one here
(she replaces the receiver) At that moment, the Inspectress, a large stout woman, appears at the open door
(to Chambermaid) You're late
What have you been doing
(grumbling) Everyone -- all the time says, 'Come back - come back
' They won't get out of their rooms
The Inspectress, in a very businesslike way, proceeds around the room, coming nearer and nearer the Baron
She is looking at ashtrays and running her fingers over the woodwork looking for dust
She tries the door to the next room, to see if it is locked
Telephone bell rings again
Inspectress picks it up quickly
No, Madame Grusinskaya is not here
The Western Theater
No
Suddenly, out of scene, we hear the voice of Suzette
Suzette is calling out to the night clerk in the passage
' Have you seen Madame
' (replying) Isn't she at the theatre
Suzette comes in and hurries to telephone
Hello, hello, Mr
Pimenov
Yes
Mr
Pimenov, have they found her
No, she is not here
Yes, 'm at the hotel
With the Baron watching
' During this action the Inspectress has waven the chambermaid out of the room
Business ad lib
Meierheim enters, he has heard the word 'Pimenov' on the telephone -- he takes the receiver from Suzette
(into telephone) Pimenov
What's happening
No, haven't found her
Is Desprez dancing
How is it
Oh, all right
Keep the show going
(bangs down receiver) Wait till  see her, she'll pay for this -- this little trick is going to cost Grusinskaya a suit for breach of contract
Madame is ill -- her nerves
Her nerves
What about my nerves
Who is she anyway
Where does she think she is -- Russia
Those days have passed
He turns and sees Grusinskaya standing at the door
She is in costume, very pale, very beautiful
Her coat, over one shoulder, is ragging, she lets it drop and moves slowly into the center of the room
Her hair, dressed for the dance, make-up is on her face -- she is breathless
Madame -- Well
want to be alone
The other women in the room draw out, leaving Suzette to pick up the robe that has fallen to the floor
Where have you been
Should  -- Does madame wish
Suzette, please go,  want to be alone
Suzette obediently crosses to door and pauses on threshold, waiting for Meierheim
Meierheim approaches Grusinskaya
suppose  can cancel the Vienna engagement
wish to be alone
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame
This is the end
(he stamps out) Suzette, with a frightened look through the door, closes it on Meierheim's exit
,
It is some time before Grusinskaya moves
She crosses to door -- turns the key -- takes the key out of the lock and throws it away from her -- out upon the floor
She crosses slowly to the mirror, regards herself, silently
We hear the strains from Preysing's radio playing a light Viennese waltz
Grusinskaya begins suddenly to sob
Watching her
Quite suddenly -- as if with resolution she begins to undress
Then she becomes weary again
With a garment in her hand, she moves slowly toward the curtain -- where the Baron is standing
We see him tense himself
She drops the garment listlessly to the floor -- moves out of scene
He peeps around the curtains
: She is in a thin robe
She sits before mirror -- looks steadily at her face
Her head goes down suddenly in her hands and we hear her say: The end -- over -- finished -- Suddenly she moves quickly across the room
Goes to bathroom
Baron half starts out toward door
He watches -- darts across the room as if towards the door
He hears her coming and darts quickly into the half open door of the closet
She re-enters -- carrying a glass of water
She crosses, places the glass down beside the bed -- her movements are quick and furtive -- then she crosses, picks up the telephone -- asks for the theatre
The Western Theatre -- She leaves receiver down -- crosses quickly to mirror -- stands there and brushes back her hair -- crosses back to telephone speaks: Western Theatre
She glances up at the clock
The stage -- Mr
Pimonov -- the ballet master
Grusinskaya -- hurry -- hurry
Again she puts the receiver down -- picking up a pencil she commences hastily to scribble a note
She writes frantically
Her other hand goes up and picks up the receiver
Yes -- yes, 'm waiting
She finishes the note -- commences suddenly to speak into the telephone -- Hello, Pimenov
-- 'm at the hotel
couldn't go on --  couldn't
No, no don't -- (long pause) Just alone
Good night, good night, my dear -- goodbye
Pimenov, how is it going, badly
Uh
Who's dancing
Desprez
Oh -- and how is it
Oh, -- oh,  see -- they didn't miss me
They didn't miss me
(she lets her hand drop with the receiver and goes on talking into the air) They didn't miss me -- good night, Pimenov
She is about to replace the receiver
She sits with it in her hand, unreplaced
The music has stopped
The room is strangely silent
Behind her the Baron peers from the closet
Her head sinks down upon her hands
funny, singing noise comes from the telephone
She lifts the receiver to her ear
In a very strange voice, the voice of Opehlia, she speaks: (with great humility) Oh -- 'm sorry, yes
have finished
(she replaces the receiver) The foregoing scene is much better played than described
It is in fact, ballet
Quite calmly, Grusinskaya finishes the notes on the table
She folds it up and places it in a prominent place on the table, or hangs it over the telephone
She crosses to the window pulls back the curtains -- the Baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before
We see the Baron watching
He glances at the door quickly
"No, there is not time
" She is returning calmly
She crosses to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer
She looks at it thoughtfully, her lips are trembling a little
She moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth
She sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded hands which contain the veronal, she seems to pray
The Baron comes from the closet -- now is his chance, he looks at the door but can't make it
Looks on the floor for the key which Grusinskaya has previously thrown there, his eyes fall upon the note on the telephone -- he reads it
It is a death farewell note to Suzette -- do not insert it
At this moment she has finished, the Baron returns to his hiding place
She makes the sign of a cross and goes to her bed
She looks around nervously, apprehensively -- like a deer who has heard something, then reassured
She places the veronal on the night table beside the glass of water
She is quiet and deliberate
She arranges the pillows under her head and lies down
She reaches for the bottle of veronal and empties it generously in her hand
She has to lean away upon one elbow, from the Baron's position, in order to balance herself
The Baron steps like a cat from his hiding place
He goes to the bedside noiselessly and stands there
She reaches for the glass-her hand stretches out for the glass
The Baron takes her wrist suddenly
She turns quickly looking at him
The glass falls to the floor with a crash and breaks
As she moves, the veronal falls out of her hands upon the bed
She struggles up to a sitting position
Please, do not be alarmed, Madam
She glances up at him
She is bewildered
She seems to be coming out of a trance
Again she wants to jump from the bed
Careful -- there's broken glass on the floor
Now she becomes conscious of almost nakedness
She draws her kimono tightly around her, glances across the wide expanse of bed
We see her consider passing over that way, but she is now a woman again -- a woman of the earth -- it would be a silly movement
There
(takes a pillow from the bed throws it upon the floor over the glass, steps back) She gets up quickly and crosses, putting on her robe which was lying across the back of a chair
Her first movement is not one of alarm but of -- shame
She draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the Baron puzzled
She thinks, dreamily, "What is this
" She glances back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that this man must have watched her preparation for bed
We get a sense of relief with her
She is trembling
The Baron has controlled his nerves perfectly
He senses his danger
He is caught red-handed with five hundred thousand marks worth of pearls in his pocket
He is wondering if she will ring the bell
For an instant he thinks of escape
He could dash for the balcony
He could strike her dead or silence her with threats
There is in the room an intoxicating sense of romance and danger
(It should be in the scene
) Please do not be frightened, Madam
(after a silence) What do you want here
Nothing -- only to be here
Why do you hide in my room
But surely you must know -- because love you
Because you love me -- you love me
She looks at him for a few moments and then suddenly she throws herself upon the bed and begins to weep more and more passionately
(going over to her) Poor little Grusinskaya
Does it do you good to cry
Are you afraid
Shall  go
was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that
(sitting up) No
am not afraid
It is strange
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that
(regaining control) Nerves -- just nerves
You must forgive me
have had a bad evening
am very tired
Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence
'm afraid not --  usually do just what  feel like doing at the moment
look in his eyes reminds her of the strangeness of the situation
She rises with returning dignity and pulls her robe around her -- she is becoming the Grusinskaya of Imperial Russia; she is the woman Grand Dukes have fought for
She sweeps across the room
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come
What now
(following her) 'd like to smoke a cigarette
Certainly
She gets her cigarette box from the writing table and holds it out to him
He takes a cigarette and lights it
She watches him curiously
She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale the smoke
She crosses and sits before her looking glass
She brushes her hair back and powders her face
She looks into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to live
He crosses and looks at her in the mirror
He smiles
Why do you look at me like that
did not know you were so beautiful
and -- (bitterly) And then --
No irony
You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired
feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever
(involuntarily closing her eyes) And -- and -- How tired you are
Yes -- tired
So alone
Alone
All alone
(whispers in Russian) Oh, you strange -- strange creature
You mustn't talk Russian to me
Strange man
Am  quite strange to you
Not quite strange now
It is as if had been expecting you
You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer -- And
He disappeared
Later he was found dead
never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone
(he embraces her) Go away
Who are you --
man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you
You could love me
It is so long since  have heard that word
Nobody has loved me for a long time
It is so icy-cold to be famous
One is so cruelly alone
How is it that you -- Let me look at you
Your hands
Your eyes
Why could you love me
saw you just now -- then  saw you cry -- and now  see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya
Grusinskaya
Oh -- oh if you knew how  slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya
and what is she now
Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand
--  want you to understand
Yes --  do understand
think you must go now -- the key is on the floor
'm not going -- You know 'm not going -- Let me stay here
want to be alone
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone
(he looks back at the bed as if remembering the suicide
) want to be alone -- No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If  left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget
Tell me that  can stay with you -- tell me
(whispering) Just for a minute then
Outside the distant noise of Kringelein is heard -- What
Say it again --  didn't hear
She whispers
You -- man
The way she says it, the word goes home
It hurts him
She has looked into his eyes for a moment with a strangely melting and almost happy expression
She gets up suddenly
(: The other side of the bed -- not where the glass is) She reaches with her feet for her slippers
She puts one on
She can't find the other
Business as he gets other slipper for her
He kisses her ankle and looks up at her
She smiles down
Thank you -- you are gallant
(she turns, her mood has changed) What a sentimental scene
Grusinskaya weeping is a sight worth seeing
It is many years since she did such a thing
You frightened me -- badly
You're responsible for this -- painful scene
He watches her
The sound of her own voice reassures her
She is generating warmth
Her cry has done her good, she speaks quickly, volubly
The stage frays one's nerves
the discipline -- it's so exacting
Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing
Do you know what  mean
Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline
-- Oh, no
do only what  take pleasure in doing
Grusinskaya turns, she is graceful again
see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing
You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come
You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it
And what is your pleasure now
(naive as he says frankly) should like to smoke
She rises
She had expected something else
His reply strikes her as chivalrous and considerate
She crosses to the writing table brings back her little cigarette box which she holds out to him
He takes a cigarette and lights it
She watches him curiously
She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale the smoke
She crosses and sits before her looking glass
She brushes her hair back and powders her face
She looks into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to live
He crosses and looks at her in the mirror, he smiles
Why do you smile
Because  can see something in the mirror that you cannot
My dear -- (he pauses suddenly) What can you see
You are beautiful
No
Beautiful but so sad
did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom
Suddenly he stoops, takes her shoulder in his hands and kisses it
long tender and sincere embrace
Her eyes close
tremor passes through her
Suddenly his whole being is aware of her
She turns, rises and disengages herself
think you had better go now
The key is on the floor
He glances back
He speaks suddenly with an air of command
'm not going
You know that 'm not going
Do you think  could leave you alone here
After that --
What
The veronal -- you
'm going to stay here with you
want to be alone
That is not the truth
(he catches her wrists) You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone --  know you're afraid
know you
You were desperate, just now, if  go away you'll be more desperate than ever
Say  am to stay with you
say it
(he almost shakes her) Her head falls slowly on his breast
(whispers) For just a minute then
(she pulls away, crosses the room, quickly to the door, with almost a cry
She looks around for the key to the door) No -- oh, no
He crosses quickly to her and holds her in his arms
Just for a minute, Grusinskaya -- Outside the distant noise of Kringelein and the doctor
approaching the  with the Doctor
They are returning from the bar and are passing Grusinskaya's room
precedes them
The Doctor is characteristically drunk
He is silent, tense, cynical distinct contrast to Kringelein, whose soul is warmed for the first time by alcohol
Kringelein's hat, the same, eccentric one, is twisted upon his head jauntily
The carnation is in his buttonhole
backs into Kringelein's room and pauses, because the Doctor has paused at the door
Oh, but Doctor
Isn't this wonderful
To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel
(with a deprecating gesture) The Grand Hotel
Oh, but Doctor
The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life -- Life
-- Mr
Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night
(he leaves) (to doctor) But Doctor -- But the Doctor has gone
Kringelein re-enters his beautiful room
He crosses to the mirror, regards himself
Business ad lib
He looks at himself in the mirror and raises his hat
Imitating the doctor, he repeats: Mr
Kringelein -- you are drunk -- good night
He puts his hat on the knob of the bed
He takes off his coat, holds it up and carefully takes the carnation out of his buttonhole
With the coat over his arm and the carnation in his hand he looks around for a glass and some water which he sees standing on the night table by his bed
He puts the carnation in the glass, having filled it with water and then his eyes fall upon his small group of medicine bottles
His demeanor changes
He immediately becomes a thing of pain
He glances at his watch -- it is long past his medicine time -- his spirit droops -- he might almost be in pain
He picks up a small bottle and carefully counts eight drops into the glass
He is about to take it, he smells it, a sudden impulse of well-being surges over him
He flings the medicine away
With a great wave of optimism he commences to sing the song that we have heard during the evening -- the chambermaid song - the Preysing radio song -- the love song
He saunters around the room, undressing
: His voice is still heard in the passage
Rows of shoes outside the doors
The dozing night clerk hears the voice and looks up, startled
: with his clock, hears the voice
: ' He is dozing in a chair with his clothes on
He looks up suddenly, hearing the voice
: ' He is snoring
The distant voice disturbs him
He turns in his sleep
: ' beautiful picture -- the distant voices -- shadows
' 've never been as happy
' What did you say
' 've never been as happy
' Say it again -- say it
' have never been so happy
: ' He is now dressed in an absurd night dress
He crosses to the bed, still singing, climbs into the huge bed -- the great pillows
His hand goes out -- he pulls out the light
He might be an Emperor as he turns with a happy, tired sigh
: "#2" "#3" : It is the first time we have seen it
There are about eight girls very busy
Morning confusion
(parts to be written) We pick up essential lines as we ' , assuming the  to be the board
Grand Hotel -- good morning -- no, Baron von Gaigern's room does not answer
Yes,
all right
Baron von Gaigern's chauffeur calling
: Good morning, nine-thirty Doctor Otternschlag
No, Doctor, no messages
No, Doctor
: Grand Hotel -- good morning
who is calling Madam Grusinskaya
Oh, Mr
Pimenov
Madam Grusinskaya is not to be disturbed, sir
no, sir
yes, sir -- The word passes down repeated
Mr
Preysing's calls to one sixty two for today
: -- good morning
Mr
Preysing -- (she plugs through) : Telephone bell ringing
General shot
Gerstenkorn, an old business man and Doctor Waitz, counsel for the Saxonia organization are sitting at a gree table, smoking and waiting
(glances at watch) Nine-thirty, Mr
Preysing keeps us waiting
(who has returned) He likes to play the great man
(glancing at market report from table) The Preysing stock is holding its own today on the market
Ask Preysing what it's costing him to keep it up
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down
Exactly
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself
Shhh -- here he is now
The door opens and Flaemmchen enters
She is agreeably surprised to see the room full of men
She likes men
(beams) Good morning, gentlemen -- Mr
Preysing will be here in a minute
Business of Schweimann and Flaemmchen
Gerstenkorn, making notes, glances at his watch again
Door opens suddenly
(enters) Good morning, gentlemen
Good morning
Sorry 'm late, 've been waiting for Justice Zinnowitz, my legal advisor
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us
-- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple
Very simple -- 've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it
(disturbed) What
(quickly) They turn out marvelous material in Manchester
Manchester -- yes
Yes, yes, they do
Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning
-- Have we cigars -- water and everything
Flaemmchen, who has been busy preparing her little table for work is seen in several : (with a wink to Gerstenkorn) Manchester is a very interesting city, don't you think so, Preysing
(stalling) Manchester -- yes -- yes
man in the textile industry naturally has to know Manchester
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company
They've the whole English market right in their hands
Have you any connections with -- Manchester
(quickly) We have a good many connections in England, naturally
mean with the Manchester people
(looking at Gerstenkorn impudently) We are here to discuss our merger
Naturally  can make no statement at this time
We must begin at the beginning
(winking at Schweimann) All right
(far-away commencing to read his report) Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages
this speech, which if played by Beery will be interesting, with signals, winks and signs between the other three men
Oh -- yes --  beg your pardon
'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern
Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags -- Mop rags --
Business between Preysing and Flaemmchen finding papers on 'Mop Rag' report
What we want to know about is Manchester
Yes, Mr
Preysing -- that's what we want to know
'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before  commit myself
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing -- No water -- What a place
All you have to do is phone for it
Flaemmchen, who is on her toes and busy every minute, rushes to the telephone and gives an order -- her conversation is heard over the conversation of the men in the room -- : Water -- seltzer, three or four bottles and cigars -- good ones
can see this session is going to be exhaustive
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious
Oh -- now let's talk like adults
You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do
We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good
When you first approached us
We did not approach you
(quickly looking through the papers) Letter on file September fourteenth would show that you approached
(snatching the document from his hand -- losing his temper) It isn't so -- this was a response to a tentative feeler of your own
(snatching the document violently away) Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door
Scratched -- (he nearly chokes) We did not take the initiative
Of course you took the initiative
Zinnowitz enters the room
Good morning, gentlemen --  see the conference is already underway
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- 'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation
But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me -- (he clears his throat) How clear is Manchester
Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, 'm told
(to Preysing) Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr
Preysing
can make no statement about Manchester at this time
Well -- gentlemen
There is dead silence for a moment -- he clears his throat, commences in almost the same tone as Preysing
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger
(over Zinnowitz's voice -- with a sigh -- sits back) Thank God we're beginning at the beginning
(stops suddenly -- takes glasses from his nose -- he is speaking, not reading) As you remember it -- when you approached us
(bangs the paper down) We did not approach you
know you did --  said you did -- And  said we didn't
And  know we didn't
During all this commotion Flaemmchen is paying no attention whatsoever
She is calmly spraying herself with a perfume atomizer and smiling at a gentleman
The noise continues over her
: 61 Sequence omitted from original script
' The atmosphere has changed, the sun shines
Grusinskaya is reclining on the chaise-lounge -- her Chinese robe drawn about her
She speaks voluably
Oh --  was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping
We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St
Petersburg
was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping
And then -- became famous and whoever is famous is alone
But why should  be telling you this
Last night  did not know you at all -- who are you, really
--  do not even know your name
am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern
My mother called me Flix
Flix
-- And how do you live
What kind of a person are you
'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock --  shall die on the gallows
Really
Really,  haven't a bit of character
None at all
No
When  was a little boy  was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery,  learned to pray and lie -- and --- And
And then, in the war, to kill and hide
That's all
And what do you do -- now
'm a gambler -- 'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me,  really belong in jail Oh
What a picture -- and what else
(seriously) 'm also a criminal and a hotel thief
(he turns away) That's a silly joke
(turns -- takes both her hands) Please look at me
You must believe me -- you must believe that  love you -- that  have never known what love is -- until last night
(he releases her hands and turns away again
) What is the matter
He does not answer
Flix
The Baron takes the pearls out of his pocket and lays them before her
There
(with a little cry of pain) Oh -- (in the silence Grusinskaya puts her head in her hands and thinks) The Baron makes a gesture as if to stroke her hair and then holds back
(softly) Did you come here just -- just for that
Oh -- it's horrible
Pause
She is suddenly cold
You may keep the pearls --  don't want them any more -- 'll make you a present of them
(passionately) don't want them now
(broken) 'll not denounce you
know
So -- Yesterday  was a thief -- but now, -- But now, you must go
give you the pearls
But now you must go --- wanted money desperately -- Can you understand
-- That's why  wanted the pearls
was threatened -- was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money
've been following you -- 've admired you
But  have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last,  managed to came into your room and -- and now
(softly) And now
couldn't go through with it
(his head goes down into her lap -- he sighs:) Remarkable
His hand touches her hair -- tenderly
Do you understand
Yes -- yes -- yes
There is a sudden knock at the door
Quickly -- here
With a quick gesture Grusinskaya beckons the Baron to the bathroom
He disappears into the bathroom
She opens the door, after finding the key and radiantly addresses Suzette
Good morning, Suzette
(delighted to see her in a good mood) Good morning, Madam
She puts the coffee down on the table
Charming piece of business as Suzette, in putting the coffee down on the table must necessarily push back the heavily crested cigarette case of the Baron
Madam has slept well
(enthusiastically) Oh, yes, Suzette
Madam will dress now, it is late
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes
'll ring
Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it
She is a French woman
She is pleased
Madam is beautiful this morning
As Grusinskaya hurries Suzette to the door she says: Yes, Suzette
Suzette goes out
Quickly Grusinskaya crosses and flings open the bathroom door
The Baron comes out
You must go now
As she speaks the telephone goes
She gives the telephone a dirty look
Telephone rings again
She pulls him across to the telephone
There -- it begins
With a hand in his she lifts the telephone receiver and speaks
Hello -- hello -- Meierheim
Yes
During this scene the Baron is touching her shoulder charming light moment
She continues to speak into telephone
His touch probably tickles her, she laughs -- quickly covers the receiver so that Meierheim will not hear her laugh
(to Baron) No -- During this scene she is listening to Meierheim
She frowns suddenly -- What
Cancel Vienna
Are you mad
We always have great success in Vienna
Certainly not
Come here and see me
yes
good-bye
She turns to the Baron and their arms go around each other
The telephone rings again
(quickly) There -- the day begins
must go to rehearsal
She lets the telephone ring
Grusinskaya -- Yes
You do believe that  really love you
Yes -- If  didn't believe that, 'd die after last night
want to be good to you -- madly good
Suzette will be back here in a minute
'll go -- good-bye
Shall  see you again
-- Telephone bell rings again
Suzette will be back here any minute
When are you leaving Berlin
Very early in the morning
For Vienna
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too --  think it would be better -- for us -- for us both
Oh -- yes but -- later
Why later
have no money now --  must get some first --  must get some
'll give you what you need -- have money
Oh no -- that would spoil everything
'll --  will manage somehow -- 'll manage myself
will go with you
When does the train leave
Six twenty-seven in the morning
But the money
Never mind -- 'll get it
have a whole day
'll be on that train
They move towards the door
shall dance and you'll be with me and then -- listen -- After that you will come with me to Lake Como, have a villa there
The sun will be shining
will take a vacation -- six weeks -- eight weeks
We'll be happy and lazy
And then you will go with me to South America -- oh
Telephone starts ringing
You must go now
Be careful on your way to your room
'll go
--  love you
(he kisses her) 'll be on that train
'll get the money
She holds him back
The telephone is ringing
Don't do anything foolish -- 'm alarmed about you
Don't worry
'll be on the train
(he kisses her) He leaves
Alone with the telephone bell ringing, Grusinskaya breathes deeply, stretches herself
She goes to the glass and looks at herself -- smiling
Happily she takes the pearls, kisses them, drops them into the casket -- picks up the telephone
(speaking into telephone) Yes, Pimenov
Yes
where are you, in your room
Come,  will see you now
hurry
She rises from the telephone flutteringly, she is humming a tune
She crosses to the mirror, pulls back her hair happily, she is indeed younger
Suzette is putting out a dark dress
Not that dark dress -- something light -- bright -- it's a sunny morning, Suzette
Suzette happily glances at her
There is a knock at the door
Come in
(sings) Pimenov enters, before he can speak -- Good morning, Pimenov
(a little puzzled at change in her) Good morning, Gru -- your -- Before he can start speaking of last night she quickly speaks: Pimenov,  have an idea -- a new ballet -- it must have mad music -- 'll explain it to you later
But now, hurry to the theatre --  want full rehearsal -- properties -- full ballet and some musicians
Hurry -- Quickly
will be there -- During this scene Grusinskaya has not looked at him, she is busy in the glass
Nice photography on hair and face
Side scene between Suzette and Pimenov, as Suzette shows him the cigarette case on the table
As he goes through the door Grusinskaya crosses and almost sweeps Suzette to the door with him
Gru -- you are positively radiant
Yes, Pimenov
(quickly to Suzette) One minute, Suzette,  will call you
They leave
Grusinskaya shuts the door
She sweeps happily to the telephone
(very very softly - her voice is like music to operator) Hello -- will you -- will you get me Baron von Gaigern, please
yes
Baron von Gaigern -- yes
While she waits, she moves with a sense of dance
(again into telephone) Will you get me Baron von Gaigern, please
(she speaks quietly) Cherie
yes
it is you
nothing
good morning, good morning, cherie
nothing
no
just to tell you 'm happy
: Bring music up
"#3" "#4" - Music effect over sign "Grand Hotel
" Precisely the same angle as before
The sign lights
: -  ' The music comes up on the  into the original key shot of the lobby
Senf is busy
The Baron's chauffeur is standing impatiently by his desk
Business ad lib of Senf
He turns to the chauffeur who is barring the way of an important looking alien
Step back please
Chauffeur makes no effort to move
Against the normal busy, happy traffic of the evening he is a sinister figure
He does not move but glares at Senf
've told you three times -- Baron von Gaigern is out
Did he leave any message for me
No, he did not -- there is no message
This whole scene is played in a very low key, almost in a whisper, it is interrupted by the entrance of the Doctor
(to Senf) Any letters
No, doctor
During this short scene the chauffeur saunters off
Kringelein comes to the doctor
Oh, Doctor, such a day -- such a day
They move away from the scene
Kringelein's voice diminishes as the   following the chauffeur
The chauffeur saunters unthoughtfully past the florist shop and out of the door
As we pass the florist shop we see the back of the Baron in the shot
chauffeur out to door
He has not seen the Baron in the florist shop
back to florist shop waits for the Baron who emerges carrying his usual box of orchids
back to Senf's desk
Key shot
(to Senf) Madam Grusinskaya
(taking the flowers and handing them to clerk) For Madam Grusinskaya
(to page boy) Madam Grusinskaya -- at once -- (to Baron) Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron
(Quickly -- shortly) All right
(he glances around apprehensively) Kringelein is speaking to the doctor
The Baron approaches them
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least
Yes, quite
(to doctor) We've been together all day
and in an aeroplane
Life is changing you, Mr
Kringelein
Yes, thanks to the Baron
The best shops, the very best
Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin
a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks
Look, the price is on it
That was half my salary before
The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron
The Baron smiles
He slaps his gauntlets on his dusty coat
'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are
(amused) Where the music's playing and the ladies are
The Baron leaves
No pain, Mr
Kringelein
Pain
Oh, no, Doctor
think if had pain 'd be too happy to notice it
: Find cut here
While Kringelein is talking, they move away from the
: ' The Baron enters, throws his gloves down on the bed, turns up the light, picks up a piece of paper that's been pushed under the door, glances at it
In scrawl: " " "" : We again see the apprehension on the Baron's face
He crosses, closes the window
As he does so we hear the noise from the conference room
Bring up noise from the conference room
: We must have the feeling that these men have been arguing all day
Cognac bottles, cigar ends, selzer water, remains of some sandwiches
In other words it is a business battlefield
Preysing is drawn and tired
Zinnowitz is on his feet
Flaemmchen is fast asleep in her chair, making a pretty picture
and let me say again for the tenth time
(he is hoarse and tired) you people were quite ready for the merger
You declared yourselves
fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up
've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now
The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days
Preysing jumps to his feet
Evil days -- 've shown you here -- (he bangs the paper) -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different
What
(to Gerstenkorn -- with a sigh) Shall  tell them again
(glancing at his watch) Why waste time -- it's getting late
You see -- what we are interested in -- (interrupting) Ah, come on -- we're going home
Due to the long tedious session the men's collars are wilted
(rising) Mr
Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now
His hand goes to his pocket
Slowly he takes out the telegram and glances at it
The following scene is played over this closeup
Sorry, Preysing
(he gets his hat) (nervously) You've decided against the merger
Yes -- Then, it's all over
Yes -- (to Zinnowitz) Well -- well -- You could call my office
There is a general movement to go
Trembling in Preysing's hand
" " Gerstenkorn crosses to Preysing
Goodbye, Preysing,  hope you pull through
This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis
We've
(interrupting) Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished
You've broken off negotiations
You did it
You're calling them off
You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester
(he develops almost a passion) You don't suppose for one moment that 'm such a fool as not to have something that  could say definitely about Manchester
(he is generating almost a passion) What
Oh no -- no -- the session is over
Let's go, it's off
Thank you, gentlemen
(he starts packing up his papers
) If you actually have news from Manchester then
Gentlemen,  am now free to announce
(he is perspiring, his hands are trembling) that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated
Preysing, you're joking with us
You're a deep one
In that case give us the articles
We'll sign at once
We know all the details
(smiling, slowly folds up the telegram and puts it back in his pocket) thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter
Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign
By this time, Waitz and Zinnowitz have the articles out upon the table
Preysing is perspiring
Gerstenkorn puts his arms around Preysing's shoulders
Come on -- business is business -- Come on -- Preysing stands, looking ahead of him
Gerstenkorn picks up the papers glances at them, looks at Waitz
Flaemmchen is awakening
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here
What a session this has been
While Preysing is signing
It's twenty-five to six
We should celebrate this with a bottle of wine
(with his hat and coat) See you soon, Preysing
Next week we'll meet and discuss further details
Next week
Hasty hand-shaking, business of exits
Waitz, Gerstenkorn and Schweimann out
Preysing has not moved
Zinnowitz takes the agreement and waves it in the air to dry the signature
(to himself) Next week
You let me talk till 'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time
Why
Preysing does not answer
Zinnowitz amiably shrugs his shoulders
Well -- the deal has been put through
Preysing commences to laugh suddenly with increasing violence
Yes, it has been put through -- it has been put through
During this scene, Flaemmchen has risen, piled up her papers, glanced at her watch
During this action Flaemmchen motions to Zinnowitz that she is going down to dance, etc
, Preysing is unaware of this action
Flaemmchen leaves the room trying not to attract attention
(to Preysing) What's the matter with you
(hysterically) Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff
What's bluff
(throwing the telegram on the table) That
(reading at out loud) 'Deal with Manchester definitely off
"Preysing, oh -- 'd never have thought it of you
No one would have thought it of me
've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf
Well, if bluff is what the world wants  guess  can put up as big a bluff as anyone
From now on
(he turns away) You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through
Yes --  must go to England --  was desperate -- Now  don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head
What you need is some relaxation
Yes -- that's what  want -- 'd like to tear loose -- 'd like a drink
'd like to go down to that dancing place
'd like to start something
can understand that -- after your -- uh -- Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that 've ever
Where's that stenographer
Miss Flaemm
What do you want with her
want to see her,  want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty
Pretty as a picture
Let's go down and find her --  need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz
(he is picking up papers) don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years
Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it
Goodnight
Preysing is very excited, they start to leave -- at that moment the telephone rings
Aeh
He crosses to the telephone
(into telephone) Hello
Father-in-law
Is that you
The agreement is signed -- did it
yes, father-in-law
but now  must go to Manchester
When he picks the telephone up his hands are shaking -- : -- which shakes more
Music crashes up -- : Kringelein and the Doctor are just entering
Kringelein is changed
His hair has been cut short and his moustache is gone, he looks almost saucy
(to barman) Barman -- whiskey -- (to Kringelein) For you, Mr
Kringelein
For me
-- Oh, please, something sweet and cold
Louisiana flip, sir
Louisiana flip, that sounds very nice -- sweet, eh
-- During the following speech Kringelein keeps reaching for the moustache that is not there
He is thoroughly happy
What do you do in the Grand Hotel
Eat -- sleep -- loaf around -- do business -- flirt a little -- dance a little
hundred doors to one hall and nobody knows anything about the person next to him
When you leave another takes your room and lies in your bed -- the end
At that moment Flaemmchen enters
Good evening, Mr
Kringelein -- Where's the Baron
'm waiting for him here
The Baron and  have been together all day hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous -- Mr
Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm
Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip
(to barman) Louisiana flip
(to barman) No - absinthe
(amazed) Yes -- that -- Kringelein is beating time to the music -- a little carried away
Flaemmchen laughs
You like music
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might -- (mischievously) man might what
don't know -- 'd like to do anything -- (very quietly) Oh -- you would
The Baron enters quickly
(to Flaemmchen) Hello -- sorry 'm late
Oh -- here you are, Baron
drink -- Louisiana flip
Hello, Mr
Kringelein
How do you feel now
little strange, Baron
'd given you up
(to Flaemmchen) Sorry
drink, Baron --  Louisiana flip
No thanks -- keeping my head clear
Dance then
(they exit) (to Doctor) She's beautiful -- isn't she
(to Kringelein) Oh -- there are plenty of women
What have you been doing all day
Chasing around
Chasing what
Money
They dance a few steps, in silence
You were very different yesterday
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday
They dance into the crowd
: Well, Mr
Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for
What, Doctor
masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing
had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr
Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you --  mean -- Are you all alone in the world
(quietly) 'm always alone --  have been everything
Everything
was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa
Stinking climate
Taken prisoner
Home on parole not to fight
was a surgeon in the Great War till the end
Grenade in the face
Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920
Isolated two years
(pause) 've been everything
The music has stopped
: That was lovely
Will you do me a big favor
'll do anything for you
Would you like to make a man happy
(quietly) Yes -- 'd love to
Then dance the next number with Kringelein
Why
feel sorry for him
You're not a bit like you were yesterday
fell in love last night -- the real thing
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist
thought that, too -- but  found that it does
Come along, dance with Kringelein
Anything for you
They move off
As they approach the bar, happily Preysing pushes into scene, touches Flaemmchen's arm
Miss Flaemm
Hello
must speak with you, Miss Flaemm
(with the Baron) Presently, Mr
Preysing
It's urgent
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me
(to himself) Insolent -- Berlin manners
At that moment Kringelein has descended from the stool and crosses to Preysing
wish you a very good evening, Mr
Preysing
You are staying here, too, Mr
Preysing
don't know you
Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant
Assistant bookkeeper, building , room twenty-three -- third floor
(quickly) Come and dance with me, Mr
Kringelein
must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business
(lightly) Tomorrow morning
No -- now
Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr
Kringelein -- Mr
Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern
They bow stiffly
Mr
Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance
could not think of not accepting
You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr
Kringelein, think we will look into your books
Kringelein stands watching Preysing, his eyes narrowing
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office
Let's have our dance
(her arms go around Kringelein
They dance off) 'll remember you, Mr
Kringelein
Oh, let the poor devil alone
did not ask your advice
The two men eye each other; for a moment there might be a fight
think it would be much better if you went away
We shall see who remains here the longer
(shrugging his shoulders) As you will
Preysing leans against the bar, orders a cognac
The Baron turns his back to him, watching the dancing
: You must look at my face and not at the floor
Yes
You're trembling
never danced before -- in public
You dance splendidly
'm happy, Miss Flaemm
Really
For the first time in my life, 'm happy
Kringelein shows signs of exhaustion
Flaemmchen watches him quickly
Let's stop -- 'm tired
It is obvious that she has stopped because of Kringelein's distress
Thank you, Miss Flaemm
They move back to the bar
Preysing catches Flaemmchen's arm
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm
You may go, Mr
Kringelein
Does the world belong to you, Mr
Preysing
What is this insolence
Do you think you have free license to be insulting
Believe me you have not
You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man
Go away -- go away
Please -- please
You don't like to see me enjoying myself
Who are you
-- An embezzler most likely
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to
You think 'm dirt, if 'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr
Industrial Magnate Preysing
You're discharged
Me
Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged
Kringelein's hat has fallen from the stool upon the floor
Flaemmchen picks it up, brushes it
Kringelein starts to laugh
The Baron steps into the scene
The Doctor slowly comes from the bar
You can't discharge me -- 'm my own master now -- at last
'm ill, 'm going to die -- do you understand
'm going to die very soon
Nothing can happen to me now
Nobody can do anything any more to me
By the time you can have discharged me  shall have been dead already
(his laugh becomes a convulsive sob) The Baron steps between the two looking straight into Preysing's face
Come, Mr
Kringelein
(he pulls him out of the scene towards the bar) (his fists clenched, between his teeth) The man's insane -- he acts as if he is glad he is going to die
(hesitates -- to Flaemmchen) shall see you in the lobby in half an hour
"#4" "#5" : ' General activity
The house detective, later identified, is talking to the chauffeur
He leaves the chauffeur and crosses to Senf
Better let him stay -- 've sent for the Baron
How's your wife coming along
was at the hospital all night walking up and down the corridor
They wouldn't let me in to see her
She has the pains, but the child doesn't come and  have to stay here chained to this desk
It will be all right
hope so
At that moment Preysing enters
Did you send that page
The young lady's there, sir
Preysing glances off to see Flaemmchen standing looking around
Preysing crosses to Flaemmchen
Oh, yes, Mr
Preysing
Sit here
(calls to a boy) Cognac -- for you
Nothing
At that moment the Baron and Kringelein pass
Preysing glances up at Kringelein as he passes
'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow
'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel
Well -- you want me
(looks straight at her) Yes
Well
must go to England -- at once
Well
You see, 'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- 'm nervous --  need somebody -- don't know if you quite understand me
You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and  mean -- understand perfectly
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip
Wait --  must figure it up
(she smokes and thinks) First, 'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, 'll need a suit
You'd want me to look nice
Of course -- of course
(he is fidgeting) thousand marks -- (she waits anxiously thinking it might be too much) It's agreed --  will get a room here for you
She is looking away
can get a room here in the Grand Hotel for you
She still looks away
Can you pay some attention to me
Oh, yes
(looking off) Insolent young cub
You mean Baron von Gaigern
Baron
Well, he's a gentleman
Who is leaning against a chair by a pillar with Kringelein
They are not speaking
The Baron is looking off at: Sauntering between the door and Senf's desk
: He slumps on the arm of the chair
(watching him) The Baron is tired
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just -- (he shrugs his shoulders) Well -- well -- Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights
'd like to Kringelein, but  can't -- am broke
Broke --  Baron
But, Baron -- The Baron looks off, sees the chauffeur -- : Arguing with Senf
: Excuse me, Mr
Kringelein
(he strides off) Keep the  on Kringelein as he watches the Baron
He takes out his pocket-book and looks at his money commencing to count it
The thought is in his mind of offering the Baron money
Charming scene
: Moving into position
They are talking
(quietly) 've quit
You can't
'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you
What about the money
'll pay you back
How
have an idea working in my head
(he glances at Kringelein) You might find a bullet through that head
If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you
If you wait -- 'll give you your six thousand back -- At that moment a voice is heard
Madam Grusinskaya's car -- Madam Grusinskaya's car
It is passed along
(calls through his little telephone) Madam Grusinskaya's car -- (outside) Madam Grusinskaya's car -- (quickly to chauffeur) Later
(Chauffeur exits with bad grace
) Baron looks off
-- Like a pageant Grusinskaya sweeps forward -- pretty shot
Music comes up
Grusinskaya is followed by Suzette, Pimenov and Meierheim
People turn to look at her
She sweeps forward
As she gets to the door she faces the Baron
She steps quickly aside to him
Pimenov and Meierheim pause
(to them) Go on please -- go on, Suzette
She and the Baron are alone
(quietly) Bless you
Are you coming to the theatre
Oh -- shall dance tonight -- How  shall dance --  want to feel that you are in the theatre
can't
No
No
can't explain now
Oh, look -- the pearls
You wear them now
Why do you think -- Why
They've brought me such good luck -- you -- He takes her hand, kisses it quietly
'm worried about you
Don't
On the train
Yes --  will be on the train
Till then
Bless you -- During this scene Kringelein has been hovering nearby
As Grusinskaya turns away and exits, Kringelein approaches the Baron, who is standing perfectly still, looking off, -- his mind miles away
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits
(lightly) Absolutely true, Kringelein and have to raise some money immediately
If the Baron -- if you would permit me -- The Baron looks at him suddenly
What
would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me
Three hundred
If  could get into a game  might win some
Gambling
'd like that
have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me
If we could scare up some men to play
We could come to my room
(with enthusiasm) Good
At that moment Flaemmchen passes
Going
Yes -- Flaemmchen hesitates as though she wanted to say something that is on her mind
curious little scene
She doesn't speak, she just turns suddenly through the door
The Baron glances after her a little puzzled, turns back to Kringelein
Ready, Kringelein
Ready, Baron
They move off and are last in the crowd
: "#5" "#6" No scenes 88-93 inclusive Sequence omitted from original script
: ' Possibly ten men are gathered about a green table
They are playing cards
There are champagne bottles, glasses, etc
, on the table -- a great deal of smoke
Good atmosphere
The game is [
] fer
There is a dead silence except for the monotonous words of the players
White faced, the Baron has the bank
Otternschlag is seen to close the door quietly and approach the table
Kringelein's back is to us
They are smart people, not professional gamblers
There is a tension in the room
The men are gathered around tightly
We do not see the cards
The following voices are heard: ' All right, gentlemen
play --  play -- Here -- Up -- Playing -- ' Yes -- me
Several men glance at Kringelein and the size of his stake
Is that too much, Baron
(glances down at his own money) No -- not at all
All right then
All right then
There is tension in the room
The Baron deals two cards
Kringelein takes cards
(quickly) Don't show them
Kringelein turns it down
He is like a little boy learning a new game
The Baron deals himself a card
(to Baron) What do  do now
The Baron is serious
There is enough money on the table to take him to Vienna
(next to Kringelein) Turn 'em up
Oh yes -- that's right -- look win, don't  -- (he turns the card up) The Baron rises
There you are gentlemen
(to Kringelein) Will you take the bank, sir
Yes -- 'll take everything gentlemen -- please, let us drink -- champagne --- champagne is expensive and good
'm winning more than  used to earn in a year -- double what  used to earn
(he is counting his money) They hand him the cards
Kringelein kisses the Baron -- he looks around
Where is the Baron -- where are you, Baron
At the side table the Baron is standing -- he is drinking -- his face is white -- he has lost
(rising quickly) Excuse me, gentlemen
(sitting down in Kringelein's place) 'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen
Kringelein has come to the Baron
That was my last
You've lost everything
've no luck
Pardon me, Baron
Permit me again
(he puts bills in Baron's hand
) Baron pours out a glass of champagne -- he has been drinking plenty -- he hands glass to Kringelein
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance
(earnestly) do drink, Baron --  drink to you, Baron and to win
(he drinks) It's good, -- come along, Baron
They both move back to the table where the Doctor holds the bank
take five hundred
All of that at once, Baron
The Baron picks cards, shows them to Kringelein who doesn't understand
Eight
(he is triumphant
) ' (rings in background) Nine
The Baron throws the cards into the middle of the table and turns to Kringelein: That's it
The luck's with you
(he walks away
) Come along, Mr
Kringelein
Sit here
'm having luck for the first time in my life
Your bank, Mr
Kringelein
Kringelein seats himself, puts his glass of champagne down on the table
Doctor leaves table, crosses to Baron who is pouring another drink
Out, Baron
(bitterly) For a while -- 'll recover -- in ten or twenty years
(he points) Look at that
He has pointed and turned off because we hear Kringelein's voice: ' 've won again, Baron -- 've won again
Baron moves out of scene followed by Doctor
As Baron approaches table
Baron,  drink and win --  drink and win --  win and drink
(he is pulling money towards him, counting it, eagerly, frantically, not the movement of a miser, not a greedy movement, but the movement of an excited child liberated
Money has become so much mad paper to him
) During the foregoing scene, one of the men at the table has answered the ringing of the telephone bell, he comes back now
There are complaints in the hotel about the noise
What time is it
Getting late
Let's break it up
(to Kringelein) You've been very lucky
Where's my coat
Let's go
He's drunk anyway
Goodnight, Baron
Let's wind up the game, 'm broke and tired; you can't play against him
put my hat down here, somewhere
think 'll have a drink before  go
By the way, 've got to see you tomorrow morning
How've you been, Doctor
Business ad lib
General business of slow normal exit
Kringelein looks up from counting his money
He has been like a little boy with a Christmas stocking
He looks up suddenly, sees men are leaving -- Oh, don't go, gentlemen
-- Stay a while
(he stands to his feet) Be my guests
By this time the men are pausing by the door
oughtn't to presume, but  -- (he is a little drunk) 'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous
The first time in my life  have gambled -- 've danced
Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life 've ever tasted life
(slapping him on back) Splendid
There is a general feeling in the room that although this man is drunk he is terribly sincere, and that there is no wish to embarrass themselves or him
In fact, there is a nervous impatient movement among the men
But Kringelein has reached an emotional pitch
Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous
You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful
You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but  -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life
(sings) Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns
General noise among men, some are ribald, others are serious
Two men come and shake hands with Kringelein, bidding him goodnight
The Baron puts his hand restrainingly on Kringelein's shoulder
Kringelein almost staggers towards the sideboard
The men are nearing the door
(starts singing) It's a short life and a gay one
(seizing a glass of champagne) Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it
(turns to Baron) Baron, you know -- 've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- (he collapses suddenly onto the floor) Business ad lib
The doctor is there quickly
The Baron next
Drunk
Poor fellow
General normal business ad lib between the men
Perhaps three of them help him up, including the Baron
They carry Kringelein to the bed
(of players mingling) Drunk
No, he's ill
Looks ill
(well paused over:) He's a doctor -- The doctor's here -- He's just drunk
Gentlemen, this man is ill -- very ill -- if you will leave
Certainly, Doctor
Goodnight
Goodnight, Baron
Bad luck
He's not used to champagne -- why does he drink it
Little comedy on exit
Ad lib
-- Kringelein's face -- white, drawn, tragic
One man, perhaps, remains
Can  help, doctor
No, the Baron will stay
Certainly
Man leaves
During this scene the Baron has been carefully making Kringelein comfortable on the bed, bolstering pillows behind his head
Kringelein's eyes are shut tightly, his hands are limp
By the business of the Baron, although we do not of course know it, this is the time that he takes the wallet from Kringelein and puts it in his own pocket
We might perhaps remember a sudden turn away in which we see his back and his right hand raised as though reaching in his inside pocket -- He stands looking down at Kringelein
(drops Kringelein's hand) It will be over in a minute
Kringelein's eyes flutter
His voice sounds hoarsely: Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun
(he closes his eyes suddenly) Oh, the pain
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid
(mutteringly) 'd like to live a little longer but -- 'm not afraid to die -- 'm not
(touching his shoulder gently) You'll be all right, Kringelein
(he moves from the bed -- takes out a cigarette, moves to the table
He seizes his drink) ' (out of scene) My pocketbook
my money in it
' What do you say -- what
We watch Baron's face, he looks back over his shoulder
' You what -- Oh, isn't it there
' No -- But no  -- Baron, 've lost my pocketbook
Baron turns in this scene
He walks forward toward them
The Doctor's hands are on Kringelein's coat
There is no pocketbook here
On the floor probably
(He glances down) (starting up suddenly) More than fourteen thousand marks
were in that pocketbook
(looking at Baron) Fourteen thousand marks
One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron
(with a shrug) Quite possibly
At that moment, Kringelein, who has been staring up at the ceiling, his hands clenching and reclenching, starts up
Oh, 've got to find it
Stay where you are
No --  must find it -- (he starts talking) Fourteen thousand two hundred marks
(he pulls himself to the side of the bed) The doctor goes to restrain him
'm all right, Doctor
There's no pain now -- only you don't know what that money means to a man like me
He is suddenly on his hands and knees, crawling along the floor, looking for it, like a little boy; his drunkenness, his condition, makes the situation tragic
He actually gets under the card table
The Doctor looks at the Baron
The Baron only watches Kringelein
He follows him, fascinated
(talking at intervals as he crawls looking for money) You don't know, because you've never lived like a dog -- in a hole -- and saved and scrimped
My life hangs upon that money, Baron
Nobody gives you anything
You have to buy everything and pay cash for it wanted to pay for my last days with that money
Every hour costs money
've nothing -- nothing but that pocketbook
(he crawls along the floor on his hands and knees talking to the carpet as he looks) must have it back
(he pauses breathless -- like an animal along the wall -- looking up at the men) The foregoing speech is intercut with the following action in which Kringelein's voice is heard throughout -- thus it is not a long speech: The Baron watches
He throws his cigarette away -- he bites his lip -- sweat breaks out upon his forehead; again he is a thief
When he wanted pearls the love of a woman stopped him
Now he wants this money and pity, a slow growing pity for this tragic, dying thing is stopping him -- and all the time the Doctor watches
The one, whole eye pierces into the Baron's melting conscience
Twice during the speech at a spot, through and during rehearsal, to be selected, the Doctor's voice, droning but piercing, says: He must find his money, Baron
(next time) Mr
Kringelein should find his pocketbook, Baron, shouldn't he
These are two interjections
And now, Kringelein lies upon the floor, a troubled little sack of pain, his head down
The Baron turns away
He bends down as though he were looking for the pocketbook
We see him take it from his pocket and turn
There is a very light, almost triumphant ring in his voice as he says: Here -- here it is
Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein
(his head coming up) Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron
(quickly) Goodnight, Kringelein
(he moves towards the door
) No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein No
Come, get up -- come let me help you
: If he is a strong actor he can pick Kringelein up -- If not, he and Doctor lift Kringelein to bed
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay
Baron bites his lip
It is the first and only time in the play that we see a tear near -- the strong man almost breaks
' Goodnight, Baron
Goodnight
(his hand presses on Kringelein's shoulder -- he exits) : Baron shuts door and pauses
In front of him is the door of the woman he loves
Down beyond is his own empty room
In his pockets nothing
In his  he makes the audience feel his problem with him
This man who has lived and whistled and love through the play becomes a tragic, lonely, harrassed figure
The Baron has broken
His fists dig into his eyes -- he brushes his hair back
Over this comes with almost an impertinence, a tiny whistle
He looks up and away down the corridor
The figure of Flaemmchen stands there, a small black bag in her hand
The Baron pulls himself together and smiles characteristically
He walks down the corridor
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six
You live here
For tonight
(she points to door -- she looks at him a long time) Oh
Yes -- oh
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen
And Baron, thanks so much for everything
They both go into their respective rooms
Here are our two gay young characters
The gay, fresh Flaemmchen and the debonair Baron, crucified for lack of funds
Both trying to smile, both trying to be light about themselves
Yet, each about to involve themselves tragically for the want of a little money
' Flaemmchen enters her room cautiously
Except for one lamp burning the room is in darkness and empty
From the adjoining door to Preysing's room a thin stream of light
She puts down her bag quickly, tiptoes through the bathroom to his door
She peeps through
: ' from her angle
Preysing stretched on bed flat, his stomach a mountain and on it the magazine that he has been reading with Flaemmchen's picture
He is looking at the ceiling
She knows he is awake because a thin stream of smoke comes from his cigar in his hand
An idea occurs to her
She could possibly sneak into bed and he would go to sleep and there would be nothing that night
as she tiptoes to her room
She closes the door noiselessly and listens
She throws off her hat and takes off her coat
Opens her bag and takes out night dress, lingerie, etc
The lid of her bag falls suddenly
She starts at the noise
"Has it awakened him
" She looks off
The thin stream of light is filled suddenly, the door of the adjoining room opens and back-lighted from the other room the huge form of Preysing appears
In this odd lighting he is a little more than Preysing
He comes forward
He speaks hoarsely, quietly
Flaemmchen
(he seizes her to him) She goes to his arms passively
He rubs his face in her hair
She is passive -- cold
(breathlessly) You are late
've been waiting for you -- waiting
had to arrange about the trip
You're sweet
You think so
He holds her again, trying to kiss her
She deliberately avoids his kiss
(awkwardly) Come here
(he sits heavily on the bed, sitting on her night dress
) Here, hold up
Preysing rises while she pulls her night dress from under him
He draws her to him
Oh -- careful, Mr
Preysing
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name
(pulling away, glad of an excuse for conversation) Oh, no
Why not
couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen
can't make you out
It's not funny at all
One can't get intimate just off hand
could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing  met you next year and  said: 'How do you do, Mr
Preysing
And you said: (she imitates him) 'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'
Preysing laughs
She laughs
That's all quite proper
(she is happy again
She would rather talk than be squeezed) But supposing  met you when you were with your wife and  called out: "Hello you big baby -- remember Manchester
' And you with your wife, how would you like that
There is a pause for a moment
Please, Flaemmchen -- we'll leave my wife out of this
Flaemmchen yawns straight in his face
All right
'll get undressed -- get out
He moves towards the windows which are open
She pushes his fat body out, almost playfully, through the doors and onto the balcony
Preysing stands out on the balcony
He looks down in the street below, then off
He starts suddenly because he sees a shadow over the railing of his own balcony
He is puzzled
Shadow crosses again
"Who can be in his room
" He moves forward and peeps through the window
One side of the French window is closed
From his angle we see the Baron furtively searching the room
He is now wearing an overcoat, the collar is turned up
Business ad lib
He finds Preysing's wallet
He stuffs this in his overcoat pocket
Preysing's face watching him
As Baron turns to exit, Preysing surges forward, pulling the window after him
The two men face each other
Aha
-- The Baron
What do you want here
must have made a mistake
Made a mistake -- remarkable
We shall soon see if you made a mistake
(the Baron starts to leave
) (bellowing) Stay here
Give me that money
The Baron hands him the pocketbook without a word
So that's how we stand, Baron
Look here, sir -- 'm completely at your mercy -- 'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death --  had to get some money -- tonight
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must
Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief
Be quiet
'm going to call the police
'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police
Aristocrat
Aristocrat
(he picks up the telephone) The Baron makes for the door on the other side of the room, pulls at the knob
The door is locked, Baron
The Baron makes one dive across the room
Preysing grasps at his coat and tears it
With one hand holding the telephone, (the receiver dropping on its cord towards the ground) and one hand holding the Baron
(into telephone) Hello
Hello
-- Don't do that
(he tries to snatch the telephone from Preysing
) Preysing wrenches the telephone suddenly away from the Baron
The action excites him
Strike me, would you
Attack me would you
Attack me -- With a terrific lunge, Preysing brings the telephone down upon the Baron's head
The Baron sways, stunned
(as in book)
In his mad rage, Preysing, hits again with the telephone
'll strike you -- 'll strike you -- 'll strike you -- Strike me
By this time the Baron is a heap on the floor
We see Preysing come out of his blind trance
He even repeats again
strike you -- (with telephone foolishly in his hand, he looks down at what he has done
) : Sharp sound of buzzing
Dozing night girl plugs in, lazily
Yes -- yes -- Operator -- Operator -- (she listens -- says to herself) They are having a nice little game up there with the telephone
With nonchalance she flicks plug out again, as she does so: : ' New angle
Preysing is on his feet
He has replaced the receiver on the telephone, he is putting it back slowly
He is terrified
Door opens behind him
Flaemmchen, with a dressing gown on, light, filmy thing, crosses and looks down at the Baron, without a word
Preysing seizes her
Her hand goes to her head, her eyes roll; for a moment we think she is going to faint right on top of the Baron
She is trying to collect her senses, it cannot be true
We can hear nothing but the heavy breathing of Preysing and the traffic below
Suddenly a motor horn in the street below sounds strident, it is the first time we have been conscious of it
With a swift movement, Flaemmchen dashes towards the door
It is locked
She rushes back as if to cut through her own room
He reaches for her and rips her dressing gown from her, leaving her almost naked
He lunges after her
She tears through her own room
: Flaemmchen enters from her room
She looks this way and that
After all, it is Flaemmchen and not Lillian Gish, running across the ice in "Way Down East," -- it is Flaemmchen, a Berlin girl
She pauses to try and clear her brain
"What the hell is this -- what is it
" The impulse naturally is to scream in alarm
She doesn't -- Flaemmchen's don't
She looks around
At the end of the passage is Kringelein's room
She will go there
We watch her run down the passage uncertainly
Without knocking she pushes open Kringelein's door
: ' It is in darkness
The only light comes through the windows
The form of Kringelein lies prone upon the bed, the Doctor had just thrown a coat over him
He is still in his trousers and shirt
Like a ghost, Flaemmchen, the shreds of her filmy clothes hanging to her, crosses
(hoarse whisper) Mr
Kringelein -- Mr
Kringelein -- where are you
She sweeps to bed
She shakes him
Kringelein starts up
Quick -- Mr
Kringelein
Oh -- what -- what -- (he is looking up at what seems to be a ghost
) She pulls on the light by the bed, it flames up on their faces
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen
It's you -- Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened
Go -- go at once, -- Mr
Preysing -- Preysing
It occurs to him that this girl with her torn clothes must have been roughly treated by Preysing
He suddenly assumes a strength
Oh, don't wait -- go -- it's awful -- it's awful
She slides down to the floor, by the side of the bed
Kringelein climbs out of bed, tries to help her up
Stay here
She waves him away
Don't wait now -- go -- Preysing
Kringelein assumes suddenly a strength
He is a man for a crisis -- he forgets that he was ever ill -- he leaves
He pauses outside Preysing's door, uncertain of the rooms, then he knocks
(calling) Mr
Preysing -- Oh, Mr
Preysing -- He feels there must be a mistake -- he steps back, sees Flaemmchen's door open next to it
He enters
: ' He enters
Looks around
Looks through bathroom
Goes quickly forward
: ' Preysing is still leaning against the table, his mouth is open, he is gaping -- stunned
The two hundred and four pounds has collapsed and sagged
He is staring, his victim lying -- a heap upon the floor, very still and quiet
His eyes come around as Kringelein enters
Kringelein crosses, looks down
Touches the Baron's hand
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron
He tried to rob me -- he is dead -- My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that
-- We must do something
(quickly) Yes, the police must be called
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron
(suddenly) Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room
Her room -- oh --  see, Mr
Preysing -- understand, Mr
General Director Preysing
(frantically) can answer for this, it was self- defense --  can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them
Yes,  know them -- The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue
Then you can travel -- 'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you
We must call the police, your excellency
Preysing takes him by the shoulders
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing
Don't worry about me, Mr
General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself
(he picks up receiver) There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four
: Telephone girl plugs in
Hello -- hurry up
hurry up
someone in one sixty-four says there has been a murder
: The scene gradually grows intense
Porter calls night man
Here - quick - here -- go to one sixty-four immediately
(calls back on telephone) Give me Mr
Rohna -- Rohna the manager
: ' Darkened room
Bell ringing
Rohna sits up in bed, turns on light, picks up telephone; on his face we see him hear the news
Where
murder
who
all right, 'm coming
Wait a minute
(speaks in a monotone) Instruct everyone to use the utmost tact -- we must have no scandal in the Grand Hotel
Answer no questions, 'm coming now -- inform the police
(he replaces the telephone commences dressing quickly) : ' Trunks standing around everywhere
Suzette is finishing packing
Grusinskaya is sitting in front of the mirror in a loose night wrap -- she is doing her hair
Madam should sleep
've done my hair differently -- do you like that
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently
(rising) In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral
Laurels and tube-roses
(she pushes the window closed, shivers, it is chilly
She crosses the room turning out one of the lights) Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette
(quietly) Yes, Madam
And now Madam will sleep
It is not long 'till the train
Goodnight, Suzette
Suzette leaves -- turning out a light
Alone, Grusinskaya goes to the telephone
She raises the receiver
Hello -- can you tell me if Baron von Gaigern is in his room -- ring him
(talking to herself) Cherie,  must wake you or you'll miss the train
(into phone) yes
are you ringing, he may be asleep
(to herself) Cherie, you must get up and fetch me from my room -- 'm longing for you, Cherie --  have not been to sleep -- kept thinking you would come to me
(into phone) Oh, but he must answer
Ring -- ring -- ring
at discretion the: ' Telephone is ringing
: ' (to herself) Cherie, hurry -- hurry -- hurry
Answer the phone -- what is the matter
(into phone) Ring him -- ring him
(to herself) Where are you -- where are you, Cherie
Why don't you answer
(into phone) Well, ring him -- please -- please
: "#6" "#7" Music up as we -- : - The trees and the milk cart effect and other curious signs of dawn, which we remember after the climax of the first sequence
Music cold and eerie
: General early morning bustle and activity
From one van, fruit and vegetables are being unloaded
From another, huge hind quarters of beef are being carried in and in a monotonous way a baker throws two loaves at a time, to another man, from a van backed up -- (counting) Forty-two -- forty-four -- forty-six -- forty-eight -- fifty -- fifty-two -- Waiters coming to work
noisy racket
Sandwiched between the bread and butcher vans, is backed a hearse
At the moment we come upon it, the men are pausing in their work to glance
The men take off their caps, as; proceeded by the hotel detective and others, who will be there, the corpse of the Baron in the basket, used at such time, is brought out and placed in the hearse, which drives noisily away
policeman rides with the driver on the box
By this time the man with the bread is counting: One hundred and eight -- one hundred and ten -- one hundred and twelve
Stay with him for a moment
: - Shooting onto door - day lighting
man comes out and signals a black closed limousine, which pulls forward
: - Early morning
Sense of chill and desolation
Some chairs stand on tables
vacuum cleaner is at work on the carpets
Newspaper boys are delivering papers at the news stand
The various shops are slowly being opened, the windows being cleaned
The general feeling of the beginning of another day
waits at a distance shooting from door as Preysing, with a plain clothes man on either side of him, leaves, moving towards
He is grim, his hat is drawn over his eyes
His hands deep in his pockets
When he has passed the : ' (the old shot) Meierheim is entering quickly goes through the door
He crosses now to Pimenov
They talk eagerly out of earshot
But it is apparent that Meierheim is, as usual, in a hurry
Rohna is there too
One of the men carries a telephone stand, wrapped loosely in paper
But we know it's the telephone stand
Senf comes on duty, looks around, it is apparent that he is late
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late
Man --  was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered
And the child isn't coming
No -- no -- not yet
Well,  mustn't let it interfere with my duty
Any news here
News
Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four
What
-- Who
-- Whom
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern
Good heavens
What for
don't know
Man -- that's terrible
He was a nice fellow --  am sorry about him
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter
don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman
know people
'm so tired  can hardly see out of my eyes
No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work
But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow
Most imposters are -- number of bellboys march up and form a line
Senf comes from behind the desk and inspects them
Good morning
(in chorus) Good morning
Show your hands
They show their hands
(to one boy) You have dirty nails -- you little pig -- you're no good
Caps off
-- Let's see your hair
(Boys take off their caps) Good -- caps on
(Boys put on their caps) Where is number seven
Not here
(to clerk) Take his name -- if he comes late again today, he's fired
Dismissed
The boys sit down on the bench
Kringelein and the police officer move towards the desk in ear shot
Please, officer
That will be sufficient for the present, sir, you may travel in peace
Kringelein exits
: As Kringelein emerges from the elevator, Suzette speaking to the Floor Clerk
And they've taken him away
Yes -- it's terrible
Madam must not know -- you understand -- Madam must not know
will tell the maids
cannot answer for downstairs -- Suzette hurries down corridor
By this time Kringelein has arrived at his door, he opens it
: ' Kringelein opens the door and enters
Flaemmchen is looking into space
lovely picture
Morning light over her hair, she is dressed
What's the matter
Oh --  was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open
You loved the Baron, didn't you
Yes -- So did
He was friendly to me as no man ever was
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that
He was in desperate straits
He'd been trying to raise money all day
He laughed -- Poor devil
And then a man like Preysing kills him
(naively) didn't like Preysing right off
Then why did you have anything to do with him
(simply) Money
Yes, of course, -- money
You don't understand that do you
Of course  do --  never knew what money really meant till  started spending it
Do you know -- (he is silent a moment) can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- 'll take care of you
Will -- will you let me
What
You'll have a good time with me
Want to
've got enough money
Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook
Three thousand four hundred that won
It will last a long time
can win more -- we'll travel
Yes -- to Paris
wanted to go there always
Wherever you like
Here 'll give you the money  won, three thousand four hundred
Later you can have more
Later
When  -- 'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- 'll not last long
Will you stay with me until
Nonsense
We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you
They can cure anything these days
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing
Oh yes, of course
(takes her hands) Do you like me better
You're a good man, Mr
Kringelein -- a very good man
Kringelein straightens, happy, inspired, a smile on his face
He assumes in his gestures
Takes the telephone
(into telephone) When is the next train leaving for Paris
-- Yes
Get two tickets for me
and my bill please
and the lady's -- Miss Flaemm's
(puts down telephone) (to Flaemmchen) We have to hurry let's pack -- we'll have breakfast on the train
: The figure of Grusinskaya is standing at her door, there is no one with her
Suzette steps out
Madam, it is Mr
Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs
Where is Pimenov
Where is Pimenov
(she looks off
) coming out of the elevator
Grusinskaya hurries down to Pimenov -- they meet
(breathlessly) He will be on the train
But when did he go
How do you know
She crosses and looks in the Baron's room
maid is there changing the bedding
The room is unoccupied otherwise
Baron von Gaigern has left
The maid nods
When
How long ago
Maid shrugs her shoulders
The Baron left about half an hour ago, Madam
Oh -- Gru -- come, come -- we'll lose the train
While they are waiting for the elevator Grusinskaya is like a live electric wire
The elevator arrives
They are stepping in
: General activity
We hear the cry go up: Madam Grusinskaya's car
Grusinskaya comes out of the elevator followed by Suzette and Pimenov
Meierheim meets her
Come along, oh, Madam, come along
The train will be going
Wait a minute
've got to ask myself
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting
You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning
Come, Madam, are you mad
Grusinskaya crosses to the desk
She speaks to Senf
Have you seen Baron von Gaigern
(comes over quickly) The Baron is not here, Madam
He is gone
Yes, Madam
Four minutes past
Please come
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there
(calling) Madam Grusinskaya's car
Grusinskaya, followed by the others, sweeps out towards the door
: Grusinskaya emerges, followed by the others
The sunlight hits them
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo -- Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna
Sold out for three days
know --  know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo
We'll have a guest then
(knowingly) Yes, Madam
Madam Grusinskaya's car
Grusinskaya moves forward
: (at telephone) Grand Hotel, Head Porter
What
There's been -- a child born
boy
Yes
My child born
It is healthy
and my wife
Doing well -- all well
(to Clerk) The child has come
They are both alive
My child
: At this moment Kringelein and Flaemmchen are coming out of the elevator, Kringelein is carrying his suitcase
bellboy attempts to take his bag but Kringelein, still confused draws his hand with the suitcase away from the bellboy
Let him take it
Your bag, your Excellency -- Hearing the word 'Excellency' Kringelein goes through a transformation
He stands and with a flourish hands the suitcase over to the boy
He is a big man now
(very definitely to boy) Cab please
Cab, for his Excellency, Mr
Kringelein
(to Flaemmchen) And now we travel, Flaemmchen
Glad
Am
(to Senf) Is the bill ready -- the lady's too
At once
Any forwarding address, Mr
Kringelein
Yes, Paris -- Grand Hotel
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel
Oh, there must be one in Paris
They have everything in Paris
Your bill, Your Excellency
Kringelein pays and taking Flaemmchen's arm starts to move away from the desk, General business ad lib of tipping
Boys line up, making a deep bow
There is almost a triumphant march as Kringelein and Flaemmchen move towards the door
(in chorus) Come again, your Excellency
With head erect, happy smile on his face, Kringelein leaves the lobby
Normal activity in lobby, reminding us of opening scene
Doctor comes up to desk
Was that Mr
Kringelein leaving
