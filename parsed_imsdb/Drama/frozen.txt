Written by Adam Green January 28, 2009 -                                     1 Peace
Fresh snow glistens in the sunlight and reflects off of the giant pine trees covering the serene mountain side
It's quiet
So quiet
: : 2
-                                      2 Tight on a gloved hand as a lever is released
Tight on the cables at the top of a rickety chair lift as they kick into motion
Wider as an empty chair swivels around and beneath the asses of a threesome of
Even wider to reveal a long line of Skiers and awaiting their moment to step up to the chair
The camera finds a group of three standing off to the side of the line, decked out in their winter gear
3
-         3 Angle on   (college age, shaggy hair, holding a snowboard and a helmet in one hand) as he studies the situation
Next to him stands an impatient (college age, goggles on his head and a face full of fresh stubble, standing on skis)
don't see her
The shift change is late
Just wait
' (college age, red hair, holding a snowboard) sighs and stares back at the lift lane
2
Are you sure about this
We've been doing this forever
Trust me
This lady loves Lynch
She always goes for it
Lynch smiles at Parker
'm cute
Just then,  (a ski mountain employee) approaches the front of the line and excuses the employee working the chair
Is um
is that her
Shit
Dude
It's cool, it's cool
(to Parker) Look, all you have to do is smile real pretty and tell him- -What
Me
No way
This is your thing
Parker, listen, listen
It's so easy
All you do is tell the guy that you and your friends- -GIRLfriends
Say "girlfriends"
-you and your girlfriends forgot your credit card and you can't pick up your lift tickets
He grabs a wad of cash out of Lynch's glove and shoves it in Parker's hand
3
(cont'd) Start at $50
That's what we usually give the other lady
He'll take it
Trust me
Dan, no
You do it
feel stupid
You've got this
You can totally do this
Parker, you've so got this
The worst thing that happens is he says no
He won't say no
No one ever says no
Why me
`Cause you're a girl
very beautiful girl with a very charming smile
(then) Just
He unzips her jacket a little bit, showing some more of her body
(cont'd) There
My charming smile
Dan and Lynch smile back at her
She exits reluctantly towards the lift line
4
-                                 4 Parker pushes her snowboard forward and moves up the side of the line, passing all of the skiers who are waiting
She approaches Jason who is now running the lift
He lights a cigarette
4
Hey
Jason looks up at her
(cont'd) Could  bum a smoke
She flashes an adorable but forced smile and he quickly obliges with a cigarette
(cont'd) Thanks
He lights her cigarette
(cont'd) 'm Parker
He looks around, not all that sure why a cute girl is talking to him for more than just to get a smoke
Jason
Oh, cool
My brother's name is Jason
Yeah, so  don't want to waste your time and bullshit you cause you seem like a wicked busy guy and everything
but
this is gonna sound so stupid
Jason is all ears
(cont'd) My girlfriends and  drove all the way up here from Salem State, and was sort of the dumbass who told everyone that  could cover the lift tickets on my Mom's credit card
but then  left her credit card at the gas station
and so
Jason totally sees where this is going
5
Right
No- but  mean, we totally have some cash and stuff
We just don't have enough to cover all 3 lift tickets, you know
Jason exhales two lungs full of smoke as the next group gets onto the lift
How much
Like
fifty
Jason scoffs and starts the lift
could lose my job
He looks around
5
-         5 Lynch and Dan watch Parker at work
He's not going for it
Will you shut up
He's gonna go for it
It's either stand there and do the job for minimal
minimal, what is it
Minimum
-Minimum wage or do it for minimum wage plus a little bit more
Lynch sighs, then changes the subject
She had to come skiing with us
Dan looks back at him, offended
6
You said you didn't mind
don't
don't mind
Don't mind at all
beat
(cont'd) 'm just saying, you haven't done dollar pitchers at Fezziwigs with us since last semester
You never come around for Monday night football, nobody has seen you at- - watched the game with you last week
For ten minutes, Dan
Football games are more than ten minutes
They're lots of ten minutes-es, you know
Dude,  have a girlfriend now love this girl
don't know what you
No, no it's fine
'm just saying, the Mount Holliston day trips were our thing, you know
She doesn't even know how to board yet
She's getting better
(then) Now  feel like a dick
You should have said something if it was a problem
It's not a problem
It's not
Forget  ever said anything
They see Parker hand Jason something
He pockets it and she glides her way back to the end of the line
She looks up at the guys waiting on the hill and then excitedly waves
Proud of herself
7
Dan smiles at Lynch
6
-                              6 Lynch and Dan join Parker and slowly work their way up the line
Good work
See
They always go for it
did good, right
You did great
Oh, so where's my change
There isn't any
You gave him the full hundred
He wasn't going for it at 50
So what happened to the other fifty numbers in between there
Like, don't know, $51 or maybe even $75
You gave me two 50's
What was supposed to do, ask for change
would have asked for change
It's still way cheaper than paying for tickets, right
Dan is disappointed
would have definitely asked him for change
8
They get up to the front of the line
Jason looks at Dan and Lynch behind Parker
(scoffs at Parker) "Girlfriends"
Parker gives him an apologetic smile
The three get in front of the chair
It descends under them and scoops them off of the ground into the air
7
-                                   7 The threesome float high above the mountain as the chair slowly makes it's way to the top
Look at that
See
All these other idiots are paying top dollar to ski
Not us
All thanks to you, baby
(teasing) Oh, now 'm "baby"
You never call me pet names
'm just not a `pet name' guy
(to Lynch) He calls me "Parker
" It's your name
Yeah but you're supposed to call me something affectionate, you know
Like "honey" or "sweetie"
hooked up with a girl last semester that called me by my last name in bed
It was so weird
"Oh, Lynch
Your hair is so soft
Do me harder, Lynch
" It was like was throwing it to Dan over here
Dan looks back to Parker
9
See
At least  don't call you "'Neil"
You don't touch my face enough either
Dan laughs
(to no one imparticular) Third wheel
Parker reaches across and playfully taps Lynch
Watch it, Lynch
Hey, that's not fair
'm not dating you, you don't get to make my life suck
Parker shoots Dan a look: "Oh, really
" Wha-
never said that
never said you make my life suck
(then, forced) Sweetie
After a beat he awkwardly reaches out and touches her face
Nothing sweet or sensitive about it, but he's trying
(sarcastically) Aww
(to Parker) Dan tells me you're getting the hang of that board
wouldn't say that
But last time we went  did pretty good, right
You did awesome
'm telling you, the first few times are frustrating but once you get the hang of it, it's like riding a bike
() 10
(cont'd) (to Lynch's skis) Are you gonna trade in those ancient things for a board
Please
Snowboards are too  for me
Give it ten more years and that fad will be dead
That's what they said about rap
Parker removes a cigarette and lights it
Mmm-mmm
Smell that fresh mountain air, huh
Kind of smells like
cancer
You know what,  am so sick of potheads giving me shit about smoking butts
At least pot does something for you
Cigarettes are just gross
Especially out in the cold
It like sticks to you and then you smell like a mixture of ash tray and an old man's used floss
Used floss
Where do you come up with this shit
Have you ever sniffed your floss
It's nasty
Dan and Lynch both crack up at this, huge
No,  have never- why would  ever sniff my floss
Why am  friends with you
Parker blows more smoke out
(cont'd) Gimme a drag
He takes her cigarette from her
11
What time do you think we'll get back
have about 2 weeks worth of chapters to read tonight
Oh no
She broke the rule
(to Parker) Parker you just broke the first rule
What
No worrying about the bullshit of real life
The whole point of this is to relax and have fun
Worry about school when you get home
But,  haven't read a- The chair suddenly stops and lurches forward slightly
The sound of the chair lift cuts out
deep silence takes over quickly, like the type of silence that used to suddenly happen in school when you were taking a test and the radiator that you never even noticed was on would suddenly shut off
Random  and  in the surrounding chairs express their disgust for the delay
Parker instinctively grabs Dan's hand
It's alright
Uh-oh
Is someone afraid of heights
No
So it doesn't bother you when  do this
Lynch rocks the chair back and forth
Parker grabs hold of the safety bar
12
Quit it
Dan motions to Lynch to stop
(cont'd) 'm not afraid of heights
just don't like them
Baby, in the whole history of time, only one chair has ever fallen off of a lift
Points for calling me "baby" but you just made that statistic up
Yeah, statistics don't work on smokers
(nervous laughter) Oh, shut-up
Lynch turns around and yells behind him
,   ' Laughter echoes from the chairs behind him
He yells forward
(cont'd) , Actually,  paid good money
Yeah, but 'm gonna pay you back so it's like the same thing
With a lurch, the chair starts moving forward again and the whirring sound of the cables above them start up again
Applause is heard from all of the other chairs
13
(cont'd) '  '
Dan lets go of Parker's hand and gives her a smile
She smiles back
He playfully sticks his tongue out at her and she laughs as their chair moves forward exiting frame
8
-                                 8 The three begin to get situated with their boards and skis
Why do  have to wear a helmet
Safety first
But you guys don't wear them
She looks around
(cont'd) only see little kids wearing them
Cause they're still learning, too
Come on, 'm not gonna argue about this
Even extreme boarders wear helmets
Nobody makes fun of them
She begrudgingly puts on her helmet
She's not happy about it
Dan and Lynch smile
/ Awww
You're just doing this to make fun of me
Dan's laughing
14
No, 'm not
swear
You look hot in a helmet
Off to the side, Lynch spots  (cute, brunette, 20's) struggling with her boot strap
She falls down on her ass
Lynch nonchalantly maneuvers over to her side
Need some help
(laughing) Do you think
Lynch puts out a hand to help her and pulls her up almost directly into his face
Parker and Dan watch from afar as Lynch helps her with her boot strap
He has one hand innocently on the back of her knee and he is fastening the strap with his other
Aww, check out Lynch
From their point of view, they watch Lynch helping the girl
See
Chick magnet
Almost as if on cue,  (an enormous dude, 20's) stomps over and shoves Lynch down into the snow
What the hell
Lynch tries to get up
Woah
Shit, man
was just trying to help
Instantly, Dan moves over to Lynch's aid
Parker follows slowly behind him
She's clearly not too good on her board
Ryan, what the hell
He had his hands all over you
15
No he didn't
can take care of myself
She shoves him back
Ryan just shakes his head at her and shoves off, away from the group
He waits for her down the hill a few feet
Dan and Shannon help Lynch to his feet
(cont'd) am so sorry about that
He can be such an asshole sometimes
was seriously just trying to help
mean, how could  even compete with a catch like that
He waves to Ryan
Ryan just looks away
(laughs) Are you
Yeah, 'm fine
Well, thank you for your help am so, so sorry about that
(then) 'm Shannon, by the way
Joe
(calling to her) Shan
Shannon rolls her eyes
Well it was nice to meet you
She takes off after Ryan
(to his friends) was like one second away from beating that guy's ass
16
know you were, man
Come on
Don't sweat it
Seriously, that guy was such a dick
Come on boys
We can talk about how tough you both are at the bottom
Lynch starts down the hill
'm tough
know you are
They push off out of frame
9
-                                           9 Dan, Parker, and Lynch move down the mountain on their snow boards and skis
Quick cuts of Dan helping Parker learn
Lynch impatiently waits
Finally, Parker comes to a stop on her own next to Dan and he claps for her
Look at you
See
Having fun
Are you kidding
We are totally doing this every weekend
In fact, if they were open during the week 'd say we should cut class, too
Lynch suddenly flies over the hill and sprays both of them down with powder
Last one to the bottom is buying dinner
He eats it mere seconds later and lands on his ass
17
Parker and Dan take off laughing while Lynch feebly tries to get back on his feet
10
-                              10 Parker gets herself some hot chocolate in the distance while Dan and Lynch pick at what's left of a pizza on the table in front of them
We gotta take a weekend trip up North one of these days
Hit up Killington or Okemo and really do it up right
Why don't we just do it over Christmas
You and me
Done
When  stayed with my cousin out West two years ago it was like the stuff you see in commercials
We had to take like 3 lifts to get to the top and it was powder as far as you could see
Well, speaking of good skiing
it's been cool doing the bunny hill all day but do you think we could get one real run in before we leave tonight
Dan feels bad
Dude, you didn't have to stay with us
It's totally cool if you want to go off for a few
Parker is now walking back to their table behind Lynch and is pretty much right on top of them
No, it's fine
'm just saying let's step it up a notch at some point
It's been cool watching Parker fall on her ass all day but would like to actually ski at some point
18
Parker feels horrible
You know, 've probably had enough for today anyway
can just stay in the lodge if you guys want to go- Now Lynch feels horrible
-no, no, no that's not what meant
didn't mean it like that
Parker looks to Dan
told you  didn't have to come
Parker,  didn't not want you to come
Dan tries to help
It was his idea that we invited you in the first place
Exactly
Remember
was like "Hey man, why doesn't Parker come with us
" And you were like- - was like, " that would be cool"
Parker isn't buying it
She puts on a smile
It's , you guys
The last thing a girl wants to do is intrude on "guy time"
won't be offended
've got stuff  could do anyway
(to Dan) Actually, can  have the key should check my messages
19
No
No locker key
can tell you right now that every message on there is going to be from your Mom giving you more aggravation about whatever the hell
Parker laughs
She does not
Dan looks to Lynch
Ready for this
Two nights ago we were watching a movie and her Mom kept calling and calling
(to Parker) And what did she want
Parker laughs
(cont'd) She wanted to know if we wanted to have chicken soup or vegetable soup with Christmas dinner
Christmas dinner
Four weeks away, and she had to now right then and there what kind of soup we'd prefer
What did you say
You said chicken
Hell yes,  said chicken, but that's not the point
(to Parker) The point is you can go a few more hours without hearing from Annette
Parker looks to Lynch
'm sorry if  ruined skiing for you today
20
You didn't
You didn't at all
You missed the part before you walked over here when  was all like, "Dude, this has been so cool
you know
doing
" Parker and Dan are beaming at him
He knows he's beat
(cont'd) (frustrated) What
11
-  ,                    11 Parker, Dan, and Lynch come out of the lodge
From their  the chair lift is still moving but the line is empty
They start to move to the empty lift line when
(
) Joe
(to his friends) Wait up
Lynch walks over to Shannon while Dan and Parker move towards the lift line
Hey
just wanted to apologize again
Oh, no big deal
He's just lucky he didn't make me mad
You know, just look half your boyfriend's size
Ex
He's my ex-boyfriend
We're, you know, trying to still be friends and everything but as you can see, that's not really gonna work
(teasing) No way
21
group of us all agreed to go skiing this weekend and well, whatever
It's a whole story and- She looks over at Dan and Parker
(cont'd) - don't want to hold you up
But that was just really embarrassing
So  just wanted to say sorry
(then) Are you gonna be here next weekend
Where, here
Yeah, probably, yes
Cool
Well, my roommate and  come like every Sunday, so maybe 'll see you
That would be
a nice time
See ya later
She turns and starts walking away
Lynch walks away
He gets a few steps and then turns back and jogs after Shannon again
Actually, you know what
Would it be cool if  got your number or something
That way 'll
know how to catch up with you and stuff
Yeah, sure
Lynch pats his pockets
Shit
Don't ski with my phone
It's in the locker with everyone else's stuff
Do you have a pen
She laughs and shakes her head no
Don't ski with a pen
Sorry
22
Just shoot then
've got a really good memory
've only smoked pot like 500 times so 'm good
Shannon gets serious
You know it's a gateway drug right
Joe is nervous
(cont'd) Kidding
Whew
You
That's so like you
12
-                           12 Dan and Parker are in a heated debate with Jason the chair lift operator
He puts a red flag on the back of a chair that heads up the mountain
But we gave you a hundred bucks and we've only gotten like 4 runs
It's not my decision, man
They're closing early
You're only open three days a week
You can't afford to close early
Why don't you write a letter
Lynch pushes himself up behind them
(to Dan) Remember "429"
What
23
Just remember "429"
(to himself) "5022"
"5022
" "5022
" (to Jason) Come on, just one more run
Sorry
Honestly, 'd slide you some more money but we gave you everything we have
(to Jason) Hey man, do you have a pen
Jason ignores him
It's not about the money
They need to clear the mountain
We've got weather coming in
There's nothing  can do
What if we promise to run straight down
Like the quickest run ever
Wicked fast
Jason struggles
He sighs and looks around
There are still plenty of skiers coming down
Fine
But hurry
Thank you
Thank you so much
We'll be wicked fast
Like the wind
Jason sends them up the lift
He checks to make sure no one is watching
24
13
-                          13 Parker, Dan, and Lynch slowly move up the mountain yet again
Seriously
For a hundred bucks you'd think he could cut us some slack
know right
They're supposed to stay open until 10 on Sundays
Whatever happened to night skiing
Wachusett still has night skiing
We should have gone there
It's kinda like Ward Hill but not as lame
(then) Hey, you remember the numbers told you
"429"
Good for you, Lynch
You got her number
What did He-Man have to say about that
That guy
Who cares
Steroids shrink your dick
(then) Wait, shit
What were my four numbers
"5022"
Parker, will you remember "5022"
Nope
14
-                          14 Jason reaches for his cigarettes
He's all out
Disappointed he tosses the empty pack in the trash
25
fellow employee () approaches
Early night, huh
You're not gonna hear me complain
Pendergraft wants you to stop by the office
Something about next weekend's schedule
'm not working next weekend
Rifkin gives him a look
"That's what you thought
" (cont'd) Oh, come on
It's my brother's bachelor party
put in for it two months ago
Go talk to the boss
He's getting ready to leave
'm the best man
(under his breath) Shit
Rifkin takes his place
Ready to shut down
As Jason runs away he turns back
There's three more on their way down
Wait for them, then it's all set
15
-                               15 The three continue to talk
'm not waiting til we get back to campus to eat
'm starving
26
Why didn't you have some pizza
You mean the cardboard with tomato sauce that you guys ate
That wasn't pizza
That was like, `roller skating rink birthday party pizza'
There's a Papa Gino's on our way back
It's like 15 minutes down the road from the mountain
Sweet
am gonna eat a whole real pizza myself
Dan spies something
Check it out
They look down to see   hit a huge jump, one after the other
(cont'd) We are so hitting that jump
Last run
Gotta make it count
The wind blows the chair really hard
Parker holds on
Jesus
The guys just laugh
It's just wind, Parker
Don't you mean, "baby"
Parker starts laughing
(to Lynch) Who invited you
27
16
-                             16 Rifkin warms his hands with his breath
The temperature is dropping fast
He checks his watch, dancing back and forth
(another employee) runs by him on his way to the lodge
Heyman
,
Do me a solid
Heyman looks back him
His face already says "no
" (cont'd) 've gotta piss so bad  can taste it
Can you just take over for 2 minutes
Heyman points to his ears as if he can't hear what Rifkin is saying to him
He keeps running
(cont'd) Asshole
17
-                                    17 low, distant thunder roll echoes far away
Shit
Do you hear that
It's the mountains
It snows every night
Relax
The chair moves on in silence for a few moments
Seriously
'm gonna eat a whole pizza
(a few beats) 'm not even kidding
28
18
-                        18 Rifkin kicks his feet around
He spies Jason's discarded cigarette box on the top of the trash and he inspects it for any left over cigarettes
Nothing
He sighs
Just then, the three skiers that we saw taking the jump a few minutes earlier come flying down the mountain and past him
voice from the top lift cuts through the radio
(
) Last chair is through
Rifkin picks up the radio and calls the top of the mountain
Cool
Last three just hit
'm clear
(
) Clear up here
He hangs up and moves over to the lever
Tight on the lever as he pulls it back towards him
19
-                               19 The chair lurches to a stop
Once again, the comforting white noise of the motorized cables goes away, leaving them in silence
The wind blows hard against them
Oh, come on
Parker instinctively grabs his hand
The cold bites through their layers of clothing
Bur
29
(yelling to the sky) ' They sit and wait in silence for a few seconds
It's gonna start again, right
(quickly) Yes
(then) Anyone got any jokes
What did the fourteen year old girl from New Hampshire say to her father when she lost her virginity
"Get off me, you're crushing my Marlboros"
Beat
told you that
: 20
-                           20 From this distance the mountain looks like a giant night- light of converging white strings
Even in this darkness, the menacing clouds are visible over the trees
: 21
-                                  21 The three sit in the freezing chair
Lynch is really getting impatient
What do you think the worst way to die would be
30
That's not morbid
Yeah, seriously
That's kinda spooky, Dan
think getting eaten by a shark would be the worst way to go
(beat) Not if it was like one of those surfers where they get hit from behind and they don't even know what happened
(beat) You know
Cause it like came up from beneath them
(beat) Like on the Jaws poster
The chick on the Jaws poster was hot
She was
don't know
She was naked
Naked chicks are hot
But if you actually like saw the fin coming for you in the water
That would be worse than actually getting eaten
Knowing that this animal is coming for you but you can't get away
And that it's going to eat you
Like you're gonna get eaten alive
Have you guys ever seen that footage of the great white jumping out of the water to eat that seal
That's why  only swim in pools
think burning to death would be the worst
31
Well yes and no
Because most people die of the smoke inhalation before any fire even hits them
remember watching  for like 3 days straight after 9/11
That footage that they kept showing of all of those people leaping off of the top of the Trade Center
Can you imagine how bad it was inside to know that jumping was a better way out
But they say that when you jump from that high up your heart stops before you hit the ground and you don't even feel it
, then Lynch
What is the worst way to die
(defensive) What
No, you have an answer for everything
What's your biggest fear
Lynch has been waiting for this
Easy
The Sarlaac pit
The what
The Sarlaac pit
From Return of the Jedi
Hel-lo
being slowly digested over 1,000 years
Worst
Death
Ever
(teasing) " don't know why  never have a girlfriend, you guys
" 32
Shut-up
The wind starts blowing again and Parker nestles close to Dan
Why hasn't it started again
Give it a minute
This is nothing man
At Stowe last year, me and Solet were stranded for like 25 minutes
This big chick fell getting off up top and twisted her leg
It was like- "move her to the side and keep the line going people"
But no
They had to stop and celebrate it right there and we all had to- The lights go out
A21
-                            A21 Across the mountain all of the trail lights go out, one by one
B21
-                                 B21 They sit in darkness
At first no one can speak
Dan reacts first
(yelling) Come on now
This is messed up
Dan tries to laugh in frustration
33
Are they fucking kidding
kind of just shat in my pants a bit, 'm not gonna lie
-
Parker is starting to shake
(quietly) No one knows we're up here
They forgot that we're up here
No they didn't
They couldn't have
'm sure they have a system or something
There's probably security cameras on us right now
He starts waving around his hands
(cont'd) '
What if they don't start it again
What if everyone went home
(angered out of panic) Will you stop
(recovering) They didn't go home
Stop freaking me out
(then) Remind me to knock down that fucking lift operator when we get down
This is horse shit
What did you say to the guy
Me
Nothing
Well, clearly you pissed him off enough to do this
34
didn't do anything
He knows we're still up here
Then why are the lights off, Dan
Is that part of their policy
Shut off the lights and scare the customers
They just lost power or something
'm sure it's gonna come back on any second
(then) They didn't go home
That's retarded
After a few more moments
This is so messed up
It's a power outage
They'll come up with a ladder if they have to
Parker is starting to whimper
In a few more seconds she may even be teetering on full-on panic
We need to get down from here
We can't just sit up here
Why isn't the goddamn chair moving, Dan
What the hell
Well you being all psycho about it isn't gonna make it move
Just chill out
Another few beats
Don't yell at me
wasn't yelling at you but you need to relax
This stuff happens all the time
Can you imagine the law suit if they left everyone on this lift up here all night
35
Free lift tickets
What other people on the lift
There was no one in front of us
She made a good point
But still
We won't be stuck here all night
No
You're right
We won't be here all night
It's Sunday
(she starts crying) Its fucking Sunday and they aren't open again until Friday
(sobbing) We'll be stuck here all week
Silence as Dan and Lynch take this in
(cont'd) We're gonna die up here
Lynch tries to be the voice of reason
We're not going to be stuck here
Parker
Parker, look at me
Even if by some strange reason they really did forget us up here- we can jump
see people jump off of chair lifts all the time
It's true
've done it before
You just get tired of waiting, you wait for a spot with some serious powder and you just jump
It's actually kind of fun, but they can ban you from the mountain for it
Looking below them, it is way too far a drop to be jumping off of the chair
(hysterical) - -
She cries into Dan's shoulder
36
Shh
know you're scared
'm scared, too
But any minute now they're gonna turn the power back on and we're all gonna be laughing about this
More moments pass in silence as they survey their situation
Finally
have to pee
They all share an uncomfortable laugh
(cont'd) have to pee wicked bad
That makes two of us
Ew, Lynch if you pull out your junk in front of me 'm gonna puke
Well, what do you want me to do gotta go
How am  supposed to go
Dan moves the safety bar a little
Well if we just lift the bar up you could probably just bend over if we hold on to you
Parker instantly starts freaking out with the bar up
Are you crazy
Put the bar down
It's just the safety bar
It doesn't really do anything anyway
Well  like the safety bar and like it down where it's supposed to be
37
Then how are you going to piss
can hold it
For a whole week
Dan and Parker glare at him
(cont'd) Sorry
(then) She's the one who said we'd be here for "a week"
Parker takes a deep breath
can hold it
'm telling you, five minutes from now we'll all be laughing
'm pissing
Lynch lifts the safety bar up, whips out his business and starts to pee off the side of the chair into the snow below them
hope they catch you and throw you out
hope they ban you from the mountain
That's so nasty
Ban me from the mountain
You couldn't pay me to come back here
Make me sit up here in below zero weather forever while they get their damn Fisher Price lift working
Sorry
Not coming back
Lynch finishes his business
(cont'd) There
Much better
low thunder clap rolls in across the trees and the chilling wind picks up
38
/  / / -
/
They continue to scream their heads off for a few moments until freezing sleet starts falling all around them, soaking them through to the bone
Almost instantly, giant balls of hail stream down at them
"Ping-ing" off of the metal chair and pelting their faces
The wind blows hard as their flimsy chair swings back and forth in the foul weather
Parker sobs quietly into Dan's shoulder
(quietly) Put the safety bar down, Joe
(louder) Put the bar down
- Lynch pulls the bar down and sulks, looking away from Dan
The hail/sleet mixture keeps pelting against their skin as they sit together in silence
Another loud thunder clap hits
This time, much closer
: 22
-                            22 The sleet begins to ice over the leaves and vegetation below
Ski tracks fill in with the wet rain
: 39
23
-  ,                   23 The entire mountain is covered in dark clouds
: 24
-                                24 The three stranded kids huddle together for warmth as the hail pours down around them in sheets
Suddenly, a beam of light begins to shine up at them
Dan's head snaps up
: 25
-                             25 Snow Cat slowly makes it's way down the hill towards the bottom
It's headlights shine across the trees in front of it
: 26
-                                  26 Dan begins to cheer
What did  tell you guys, huh
- Oh, thank God
: 27
-                             27 The Snow Cat is now really close
It is literally coming right for them
: 40
28
-                                  28 Dan and Parker wave their hands in the rain
: 29
-                             29 The Snow Cat continues on right underneath them
It doesn't look like it's going to stop
: 30
-                                  30 Panic sets in yet again
Why isn't he stopping
: 31
-                                    31 (the driver) concentrates on the path
The roar of his engine is almost deafening
His radio chimes in
(
) Steve
Steve picks up his radio
Go for Steve
41
(
) We got a problem here
: 32
-                                 32 Below them, the Snow Cat slows down to a halt
The three kids cheer
/  / /
/
: 33
-                                   33 Steve listens
(
) It's nothing but ice at the bottom of Wildcat so you're gonna have to cut over to the south hill and come around the side
That's gonna take me 20 minutes
(
) Sorry brother, but it's a frozen swimming pool down here
10-4
He puts the Snow Cat in gear and begins to back up
: 34
-                                 34 Below them, they see the Snow Cat start to back up and turn to the right
What is this asshole doing
The Snow Cat switches back into drive
42
No
No
Quickly Dan and Lynch start to ball together the slush on the sides of the chair
They throw them at the Snow Cat, but keep missing by a few inches
Desperately, Lynch throws his goggles at the Snow Cat
They land just shy of the driver's side window
Parker takes off her helmet and throws it down
: 35
-                                    35 Steve turns the headlights in the opposite direction, just missing the helmet falling past his windshield
Though we can briefly see the light shine off of the three kids, unless you knew they were there or were looking for them
you would have missed them, too
As the windshield turns the other way, one of Lynch's skis slams into the ground, just out of the headlight's view
: 36
-                                  36 The Snow Cat drives away
Lynch throws one of his ski poles but doesn't even come close
Parker sobs hysterically
: 37
-                                  37 It has stopped hailing
43
The moon shines down on the mountain
It glistens like a block of ice
Silence
: 38
-                                    38 The three shiver uncontrollably
Finally
My face is burning
The power is coming back on soon
No it isn't
It has to
The wind makes eerie sounds as it whistles through the frozen trees
(cont'd) Anyone know what time it is don't wear a watch
Me neither
use my phone
Hold on, let me just run back to the locker real quick and 'll find out
No one laughs at his attempt at "humor"
(cont'd) , top 3 breakfast cereals of all time
Go
Silence
(cont'd) 'll go first
Stop
44
Crunch Berries
Please, stop
Apple Jacks
Dude, quit it
and 'm gonna go out on a limb and say Lucky Charms pre-purple horseshoes
Silence
(cont'd) There's just something weird about eating purple horseshoes, am right
Silence
Everyone went home
They left us up here
More silence
Top 3 celebrities you'd do
(then) Me first again
Fine
Someone has to jump
They steal glances at each other
They are soaked through
Parker's hair is frozen
(cont'd) We can't just sit up here until next weekend
We'll die
No one acknowledges him
He sighs and closes his eyes
Parker starts to cry
Neither of the guys even try to console her
45
Finally, Dan puts an arm around her
(cont'd) Shhh
It's
His voice is getting hoarse
(aside to Dan) don't want to die up here
(aside to Parker) You're not gonna die, baby won't let you die
promise won't let you die
Parker cries
(aside to Dan) 'm so scared
(aside to Parker) It's alright
It's alright
Snow starts to lightly fall around them
(cont'd) Hey
It's snowing
They shiver together
Great
(then) Best Christmas present you ever got
Go
Parker chimes in first this time
Shayna
My puppy
Disneyworld in 8th grade
46
Hmm
guess that leaves me
'm gonna go with
oh yeah
these skis
Get it
How ironic, huh
Silence
Parker takes off her glove to light a cigarette
As she struggles with the lighter, the glove falls out of her lap and lands on the ground below them
Shit
See
That's where smoking gets you
Shut-up
She keeps struggling with the lighter but eventually gives up
She throws the cigarette away and puts her exposed hand back in her pocket
The snow falls around them
Dan pushes the safety bar up
(cont'd) -what, what are you doing
'm jumping
'm gonna get help
Dan
woah
Let's talk about this
No
No, don't leave me up here
Dan takes her face in his hands
Tenderly
And probably for the first time
correctly
Parker,  can do this
Even if get hurt, as long as  can get to the bottom
your skin is so red
You're getting frost bite
47
You can't get frost bite that fast
It's only been- what, like
how long has it been
few hours, tops
Dan inspects Parker's face
It's tough to see in the dark, but the tip of her nose and her right cheek (the side facing into the wind) is discoloring
(quietly) Don't leave me
'll get help
Lynch is here
He'll be with you
Lynch is looking down below them
It's far
Dan, it's a far drop
don't know
(heated) Do you have a better idea
'm telling you, 've totally jumped off of a lift before
If we can wait `til morning  bet someone will come up here
Like a snow groomer or some shit
Really
And why would they come groom the snow on a day when they aren't open, Joe
day when they still have a full work week before they open again
Lynch says nothing
(cont'd) can do this
He positions himself to try and jump off
Parker grabs his arm
No, no, no
Please don't jump down there, Dan
You'll get hurt
48
How are you going to find your way in the dark
'll stick to the trail
'll ride to the bottom
(then) You don't get a fresher run than this, right
Dan drops his snowboard down
It lands sticking up straight in the snow
(cont'd) Parker and Lynch look back at him
They don't know what to say
Lynch tries to grab on to Dan's arm
Walker, no
Dan shrugs free
He is determined
Concentrating
One
Parker's tears are freezing on her cheeks as the seconds tick by
(cont'd) Two
Lynch takes a deep breath
When enough time has elapsed to think Dan's gonna jump, he suddenly looks up at Lynch instead of jumping
(cont'd) Remember when  was saying how jumped off one of these things before
Lynch stares back at him
(cont'd) totally lied
'm scared shitless right now
Lynch musters a laugh
It's forced, but it's a laugh
49
Dan laughs back at him
He turns to face Parker
She tries to smile but is frozen with fear
Dan whispers to her
(cont'd) (whispered) You're gonna be , baby
and he is gone
From his point of view (the camera pointed down at his feet) we drop (without cutting) from the chair all the way to the frozen ground below
: 39
-                              39 Both of Dan's legs shatter from the impact
Viscera protrudes out of his snow pants as his leg bones shoot out the top of his knees
: 40
-                                   40 Parker calls down to him
Oh my god
Dan's cries turn to quiet breaths below them
It is tough for Parker and Lynch to make out what exactly is happening
Dan, say something
Are you alright
More quiet breaths from below
Finally
(
) My legs
broke my fucking legs
Oh, shit
50
Can you move
Dan
(she starts to panic) Hold on
Hold on, baby
Lynch stops her
What are you doing
gotta
have to get to him
You'll just get hurt, too
Stop
Calm down
Calm down
(to Dan) Talk to me, Danny
: 41
-                            41 Dan struggles
Stay there
Don't get off the chair
(
) How bad is it
Dan can see that his legs are shattered and that he is bleeding
Bone protrudes from his bloody ski pants
It's bad
It's really fucking bad
(starting to cry) : 42
-                            42 Dan's screams can barely be heard from this distance
The blanket of snow muffles all sounds of life on the mountain
: 51
43
-                                 43 Parker sobs into Lynch's shoulder
Alright
You gotta stay strong for me, Parker
Can you do that
He looks every which way, trying to come up with a solution
(cont'd) If we go to pieces we're never gonna get through this,
What are we gonna do
We're gonna die up here
(to Dan below) Buddy, can you move at all
: 44
-                            44 can't even stand up
: 45
-                                 45 You can't, like
don't know, slide down the hill or something
: 46
-                            46 My legs are shattered, asshole
'm bleeding to death- ,  ' (
) Alright, alright
Um
52
so much blood
: 47
-                                      47 (to Dan below) Can you stop the bleeding
(
) With what
Here
She takes off her scarf and tosses it below
It blows away into the trees
It doesn't even make it halfway
(cont'd) Lynch removes his scarf and balls it up
Here you go, Dan
'm throwing mine down
(
) can't see
Just feel for it,
Here it comes
He drops the balled up scarf
: 48
-                                 48 The scarf lands right next to Dan
What do  do with this
53
(
) Tie it over your leg
Tie it off above wherever it's bleeding
Like a tourniquet thing
Dan fumbles with the scarf and ties it just above his right knee as tight as he can
'm so cold
: 49
-                                  49 Parker starts to take off her coat
Here, take my coat
(
) No
Don't you take off your coat
You need it
No, 'll be
can huddle next to Lynch
Please- : 50
-                             50 -Parker, keep your coat on
Dan takes off his snowboarding gloves and ties the elastic strings together
His fingers are so numb that it takes several tries
Once tied, he tries to stretch the gloves around his left knee, but it is useless
(cont'd) Shit
(
) Dan, buddy
You gotta let us throw something down so you can stop the bleeding
54
've got it
Are you sure
Dan's left leg is definitely still bleeding
Yup
Thunder shakes the mountain side
Moments pass with only their breathing
(
) Are you sure you can't try and get down the hill, buddy
Dan falls onto his back, panting from the pain
He struggles to flip himself over, but it hurts too much
No, man
can't move
can't move
: 51
-                                  51 Lynch holds his head
Alright
Hold on
Once again, Lynch starts looking all around
Above, below
(cont'd) Maybe
if  could climb up to the lift cable
Maybe  could like, scale across to the other chairs until  find one that isn't quite so high up from the ground
You think you can pull yourself across that many chairs
Lynch looks back at her
can't even do a pull-up
55
(
) You never even tried to do a pull up you asshole
You had your Mom write you a note to get out of climbing the rope in gym cause you're a pussy
There was no reason to embarrass myself
knew  couldn't do it
(
) You can too
Remember Jenny Bluth
She fucking did it
You can do it
Even if  made it across to the next chair
how many more would it take before  found one closer to the ground
(
) Every lift pole has an emergency ladder on it
They look forwards and backwards
The chair behind them is not near the pole
But the one behind that one is
The chair that's two back
Does it look like it's near the pole
don't know
can't see
Shit, that's far
He and Parker just stare at it
(cont'd) Just
Just give me a second
He starts taking deep breaths
Trying to psyche himself up
What if you fall, too
56
Parker
if we just sit here, we're gonna freeze to death
Maybe
maybe in the morning someone else will come up here
Maybe, they'll need to do maintenance on the lift or something, you know
(
) What's going on up there
You guys
We're right here, baby
Yeah, man
We didn't go anywhere
think
think 'm gonna try and climb back to the pole
If the chair is close enough, maybe
maybe  can jump to it
: 52
-                            52 Dan is in agony
Do it
Please do it now
: 53
-                                 53 Just hang in there, Dan
It's gonna be
Lynch starts to maneuver himself in the chair
Slowly he pushes himself up so that he is sitting on the chair back and holding onto the connecting post
The chair swings back and forth in the wind
Above him it is a solid 5 feet before the chair arm connects to the wire
57
It's funny
But  was never afraid of heights, until like
right now
What can  do to help
Just hold on to my legs
You can't really stop me from falling
but it's, you know
psychological or something you know
Parker maneuvers herself to hold Joe's legs
Joe tries to move into a standing position, but panics
(cont'd) just give me a second
think we should wait til morning
We can make it a few more hours
(quietly) Us
Maybe
(then) But not him
The gravity of this settles in
As Lynch gets ready to try and stand again
we hear something in the surrounds
They freeze
Again, a sort of "moan" rings in the distance
Baby, is that you
(
) What
Shh
They listen again
: 58
54
-                            54 This time, clear as day
a
Oh, motherfucker
: 55
-                                 55 Lynch tries to control the panic
It's alright man
It's just a coyote or something
They're scared of people
It probably won't even come anywhere near us, (
) That sounded like a fucking wolf
Just relax
When's the last time you heard of a wolf attack in New England
: 56
-                            56 Even in the pale moonlight, it is easy to see how white Dan is becoming
read about one on-line somewhere last year
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
: 57
-                                 57 Wolves around here are pussies
They aren't even that big
They stop and listen
but there is only the sound of the rain
59
It could be worse, right
(
) How the hell
could this be worse
Long pause
It could be the Sarlacc Pit
They can't believe it
but Dan and Lynch both actually laugh
It's uncomfortable and forced as hell
But it's a laugh
Parker- coming through with the tension breaker, look out
(to Dan) She's alright, Walker
Your girl is alright
He focuses on the task at hand again
(cont'd) here we go
Slowly he pushes up on the back of the chair again
With one hand on Parker's shoulder and another on the back post of the chair, Lynch gets to his feet
Looking down at the drop, he instantly crouches down again
(cont'd) Holy shit, is that high up
What can  do
Nothing
Just be quiet
He psyches himself up again and starts to rise up
(
) You can do this, Lynch
You've got it
Please stop talking
He puts one foot up on the top of the chair back
but it slips off to the side
60
(cont'd) Woa-
The whole back of this thing is ice
Together, he and Parker start hitting the chair back
: 58
-                             58 Shards of ice fall down around Dan
He covers his head for protection
(
) Hold on, down there
think once can stand on the back-  should be able to reach the top
More chunks of ice shower down around Dan
Finally the falling ice subsides
Dan takes his gloves away from his face
only to freeze in horror
Not even 10 feet away, stands a
Silently the wolf watches him from the bushes
Lightly growling
(quietly at first) You guys
The wolf gives a low growl
(cont'd) (really loud) : 59
-                                  59 What
What's wrong
(
) There's a wolf down here
61
Lynch and Parker look down
From their  they can see that the wolf is standing right next to Dan, watching him
No fear
(gasps) Oh shit
: 60
-                                60 Dan doesn't take his eyes off of the wolf
He is shaking in fear
What the hell do  do
The wolf sniffs at the air and then growls again, this time baring it's teeth
It smells the blood
(cont'd) The tension builds in the stand-off
Neither the wolf or Dan look away
When
Lynch's other ski lands between the two of them
(
) (screaming) The wolf steps back and snarls
Parker's snowboard comes down and skids away into the trees, pushing the wolf further back
The wolf darts back into the bushes
Though it can no longer be seen, we can hear it moving away through the brush and back into the darkness
Growls come from the surrounding bushes as the wolf angrily retreats
: 62
61
-                                  61 Are you alright man
(
) Yeah
'm alive
Lynch slides his remaining pole in between the bars on the chair back and rests it there
See
What did  tell you
They're more scared of you than you are of them
(
) don't know
'm pretty scared, gotta be honest
It's just a dog
That's all it is
He won't be back
Are you keeping warm down there
: 62
-                             62 As warm as  can
(then) can't feel my legs anymore
Is that bad
mean, it doesn't hurt as much
but that's bad right
: 63
-                                  63 No, no
You'll be alright
(quietly to Parker) That's probably really bad gotta move, so  need you to- 63
He looks closely at Parker's face
The tip of her nose and the tops of her cheeks look as if there is black soot on them
(cont'd) Hey
go like this
He motions wiping his face
Parker follows suit, but winces in pain
Ow
It feels like
like sunburn
Pieces of her chapped skin are stuck to her icy glove
'm not an expert but  think that's frost bite
What
Look at me- is my face changing color anywhere
Parker looks as closely as she can
don't
can't see anything don't know, it's too dark She starts rubbing at her cheek again
No
Stop touching it
Don't touch it
But it itches now
know- but if you keep touching your face it's gonna rub off
Parker is terrified
(cont'd) Just try and cover your face
Try and stay warm
64
Staying warm is absolutely impossible
Parker hides her exposed hand deeper inside her wet jacket
Icicles dangle from the bottom of the chair and their clothing
(
) (winded) You gotta move faster up there
'm trying man, 'm trying
Lynch slowly lifts himself up onto the back of the chair, which bends at an awkward angle
From above him we can see the long drop down, and as he slowly starts to maneuver his body up to the top of the chair arm- the height looks `stomach droppingly' scary
Careful
Stop talking
(
) Lynch
think the- ,
Silence
Lynch gets his gloved hands around the top of the cable
It is frozen over with a thick layer of ice
The distance to the next chair seems about 10 times as far now
(cont'd) (to himself) can do this
If Jenny Bluth could climb the rope,  can totally do this
Slowly, he wraps his arms around the wire, now with his full body weight on the back of the chair
The bolt holding the arm into place on the cabling starts to creak
It bends slightly, but seems to hold firm
65
(cont'd) He starts to pull himself up onto the cable
Don't look down
With one hand in front of the other, Lynch hoists himself about two feet off of the chair and into the air
(gritted teeth) Slippery
Do you got it
Shh
He slides out a little bit more, his feet dangling high above the ground
The cable clangs somewhere to the front and back of Lynch
The noise is almost refreshing in the silent ice covered wilderness
With another deep breath, Lynch moves another two feet out over the sky
He is straining hard
Another two feet out
He looks down for the first time
He sees something that scares the shit out of him
(cont'd) Oh god
What's wrong
Please no
Please no
He starts to pull himself back to the chair, quickly
(
) Come on, Lynch
You had it
Lynch gets his foot on the icy chair back and tries to balance his weight on it
66
His foot slips off of it and he almost falls
but Parker grabs onto his coat
got you
Lynch scrambles into the chair and huddles next to Parker
(cont'd) What's wrong
He looks at her, icy tears in his eyes
His face is white
(cont'd) What happened
Finally Lynch grabs her face in his hands
He gets close to her
Don't look down
What
He grabs her head forcefully, trying to cover her ears
Don't look down there, Parker
The camera booms up and above them
As it tilts down at them
we reveal Dan splayed out on the ground below
Out of the darkness of the bushes
a pack of slowly and silently descends on him from all angles
(
) Lynch
What's wro- : 64
-                              64 Dan hears the first growl
Oh shit
Oh shit
The hungry wolves circle around him
The smell of his freezing blood makes them drool
67
(cont'd) (yelling up) : 65
-                                      65 Lynch doesn't look down
He just stares at Parker
(fighting tears) ,
(
) (crying) '
'
(
) '
Lynch is trying to cover Parker's ears
but she can hear what they are saying
She forces her head free and steals a glance down
She sees Dan's untimely death approaching and instantly starts to scream and cry
Lynch holds her head in a vice grip
He presses his forehead into hers
Her tears and snot overflow onto his gloves
Shhhh
Don't listen to it
Don't listen
Don't listen
As we push in tight on the two of their faces, below them we hear the wolves begin their attack on their defenseless prey
First one growl and a bite
Dan shrieks in pain
(
) Don't let her look
Below we can hear him put up a fight
But the attacks and bites get more frequent and his screams even more painful
68
(
) (cont'd) Don't look
Don't you fucking look down here
The sound of several wolves attacking in unison over powers his cries
Lynch continues to hold his hands over Parker's ears and keep her eyes pointed at his as the sounds of Dan's demise echo through the night
The sounds of clothes being shredded, flesh being torn, and bones popping from their joints creates a chorus of pain below
Dan doesn't scream as much as does cry out in pain and agony
The camera never sees it
Only Lynch and Parker's faces
After what seems to be an unbearable minute
the sounds from below begin to dissipate
Eventually Dan's remains can be heard dragging away
Silence once again
Finally, Lynch let's go of Parker's head
He sobs into his own frozen gloves as Parker hysterically screams out into the night
: 66
-                              66 Parker's screams echo across the dark wilderness
Somewhere in the distance, birds take off in fear
: 67
-                                    67 Lynch and Parker sit on the frozen chair, shivering
They are now in the devastating silence that has fallen after what must have been endless screaming and crying
Only the occasional sniffle lets us know that they are even awake
Finally Lynch breaks the silence
should
try and
69
He starts to try and sit up on the back of the chair again to continue his climbing effort
(emotionless) Why did you let him jump
Lynch turns and looks at her in disbelief
You can't be fucking serious
It was too far
He said he could do it
You didn't try and stop him
(then) can't believe this
You're blaming me
'm not
'm not blaming you
You're his girlfriend
didn't see you throwing yourself in front of him
He wasn't going to listen to me
Oh, but he would have listened to me
said it was a bad idea said it was too far a drop
But didn't hear any better ideas out of you except for crying about it
Don't you fucking blame me
You've been his girlfriend, for what year maybe
've known him my whole fucking life
But you
You should have
What
Say it
Parker looks at him, uncertain
70
(cont'd) Say it
It should have been me
didn't say that
But you want to
It's
get it
It should have been me down there cause who gives a fuck about me, right
Parker feels terrible
She puts her hand on his shoulder
No, no, - Lynch shrugs her hand off of him
You know what
If we hadn't spent the whole fucking day on the bunny slope watching you fall on your ass we would have gotten some real runs in and we could have just gone home
'm sorry
You're sorry
Maybe if you hadn't fucked with our thing
maybe if you had just stayed home and not forced yourself into every aspect of his life
maybe my best friend wouldn't be dead right now
That's not fair
And it's not fair that my best friend is
Parker begins to sob
'm sorry
didn't mean it
'm just- 'm just- -Fuck you
71
Lynch is numb
He sits expressionless
Seething
In her crying, Parker slowly keeps moving towards him
Like a puppy who knows they did something wrong and only wants you to love it again
Finally she gets next to him and buries her head in his chest, letting it all out
Eventually, Lynch can't help but feel compassion for her
He puts his arm around her
(cont'd) (quietly) 'm sorry
'm sorry, Parker
A67
-                                 A67 Snow has now almost completely covered any of Dan's remains that were left on the scene
Only the tip of a boot and a piece of jacket are visible
B67
-                                 B67 Parker and Lynch are shivering together
After a beat, they begin to banter again
Everything is said in a monotone voice
They never even look at each other
They only speak to be speaking
429
5
5
shit, what was it
5520
5020
5022
5022
429-5022
'm so gonna call that girl when we get home
And you know what
'm gonna marry her
No messing around
'm just gonna be like "Hey Shannon, it's me Joe from the chair lift
Will you marry me
" And then we're gonna get a house and have 2 kids and a dog named Steve
72
Parker's face is expressionless
Who's gonna pay for the house
She will
Shannon's got a great job
What does she do
Lynch makes something up
but continues to have no expression in his words
Despite his talk, his spirit is shattered
She
an orthodontist
Orthodontists make a lot of money
Yup
bet you guys will be really happy
429-5022
68
-                           68 wolf settles in the bushes and looks up at the two "pieces of food" on the chair high above
Another wolf lays down in the snow by a tree
They wait like vultures
69
-                                69 Silence
Then
Who names their dog "Steve"
will
73
Steve's a "people" name
Says who
You don't like walk into someone's house and have them say "Here's my dog Steve
" Why not
Steve's a good name for a dog
"Here, meet my cat Chris
" No cats
Just a dog
Steve
Silence
Shayna must be so hungry
Lynch tries to change the subject
What kind of pizza should we get at Papa Gino's
Parker doesn't hear him
As she continues, wet snow starts to fall around them and the icy wind starts to pick up
The poor thing
She's just a puppy
She won't understand that died
She's gonna think  left her
That  forgot about her
All she wants is for me to come home
She's probably waiting by the door for me right now
Every sound she hears in the hallway she's probably cocking her little head to the side, waiting to see if 'm going to walk in
But  won't
won't ever walk in
And Shayna's going to starve to death
The poor thing is gonna wither away and die waiting by the door for me and it's all my fault
74
She won't starve to death and you're not going to die
No one else has a key to my place
The neighbors will break the door down if she doesn't stop barking
Someone will figure it out
She'll be fine
(beat) And so will you
So will we
He puts an arm around her and huddles closely trying to shield the wind
would have had Shayna for a year this month
got her a year ago for Christmas
know
But you'll see her again
Dan and  were spending Christmas with my parents this year
We won't be there though
(then) want to see my Mom and my Dad
(then) want to open presents in the morning and then wait for my grandmother to show up so we can eat
She's always late
But she brings all of the desserts
And she makes this special hot apple cider thing with cinnamon and nutmeg
It's so good
And after dinner my Dad always passes out on the couch `cause it's his one day off and he's had too much eggnog
And my sister, my Mom, and  watch Christmas Story until the marathon is over
And that's how you know Christmas is really over
When Ralphie gets his Red Rider carbine-action two-hundred-shot range model air rifle that last time and they go back to their regular programming
() 75
(cont'd) It's kind of sad because then you know you have to wait another year for Christmas again
(then) It's the same routine every year
(then) just want to see my Mom and Dad
The camera pulls back wider and wider until their chair is lost in the wet snowfall and darkness
Slowly we fade to black as the wind howls and thunder gently rolls
: 70
-                              70 Dawn is breaking over the trees
Lynch and Parker are still
Their bodies are huddled together, but neither is moving
In fact, at a first glance, one might think they are both human popcycles
The dark splotches of frost-bite on Parker's nose and cheeks have now grown to what almost looks like patches of black fungus on her skin
Lynch has the start of his own frost-bite on his ears and nose
Slowly, Parker's eyes flutter and she awakens
Her eyes search around as the realization that this was not all just a bad dream sinks in
She adjusts in her seat and feels something pull
She winces and looks down
Slowly the camera follows her stare down to reveal her bare hand, gripping the icy safety bar
She pulls
but her skin is stuck to the frozen metal
Beginning to panic, she jerks her hand hard, taking the bar up about half an inch with it
Uhh
76
Painstakingly slow, she begins to peel her hand off of the bar
sound that resembles `jeans slowly tearing' can be softly heard as she moves her arm forward and separates her hand from the skin that is attached to the metal
After what feels like an eternity, she gives her hand one last jerk, freeing it from the safety bar
(cont'd) Ruuugh
Her movement startles Lynch awake, and he bolts upright as if from a `falling nightmare'
Discombobulated, Lynch turns back and forth frantically trying to get his bearings
Parker is crying and holding her bloody hand, (cont'd) Shhhh
Lynch, bug-eyed, takes in the world around him
fresh coat of snow has covered everything in several inches of peaceful white bliss
Below them, the snow has completely covered Dan's remains
There is nothing left to show that there was ever even a struggle
Parker hides her bloody hand back inside of her coat, away from Lynch's eyes
thought  was dreaming
This
thought this was a dream
He turns to look at Parker
It takes everything he has to not jolt back in horror at how bad her face looks
What
Your frost-bite
It's getting
worse
She starts to touch her face
77
Really
How bad is it
Lynch stops her
Don't
It's bad
It's not as itchy any more
Just don't touch your face,
When we get out of here, we'll get you to a doctor right away and they'll fix it
You have some dark spots on your face, too
They'll fix me, too then
Just don't touch it
He looks around, front to back
In daylight it's easier to see the other chairs
His breath blows out of his body in huge plumes of mist
(cont'd) Well, it's morning
Maybe someone will come up here now
For what
don't know
Mountain maintenance
Besides, when none of us show up for class people are going to start looking for us
No one's gonna look for me
skip class all the time
By the time anyone notices 'm gone 'll be dead
Can you please just think positive thing
Please
78
Besides
No one knows we're here
(to the sky) -
His voice echoes off of the frozen trees, almost as if taunting him
He turns around to look at the chairs behind him
(cont'd) Alright
Look
If  can get to that chair
two back
could make it to the ladder on that pole
think  could make it down
Parker doesn't speak
(cont'd) Help me
Are you sure you don't just wanna give it a few more hours
What if you're right
What if someone is going to come up here, even though they're not open today
Lynch doesn't respond
The look on his face says that "no one is coming" but he decides there's no harm in waiting just a little while longer
Lynch tries to yell for help again, though his soar throat is making it almost impossible to scream
Once again
only echoes
He re-settles in his chair
just wish  could stand up
Get out of this position for a minute
If you want, you can stand on the chair and  can hold onto you
79
No
can't
Well, if anything's gonna get you over your fear of heights, it's this
(quickly, sternly) No
'm fine
Alright
: 71
-                                      71 The bottom of the mountain looks like it has been abandoned
Empty ski racks
An empty lodge
An empty parking lot
still chair lift
All covered in white, still snow
: 72
-                                           72 Lynch is sleeping
His head is leaned to one side in a position that is sure to give him the worst stiff neck he's ever had
Parker is ancy
She looks all around
Thinking
Finally she squeezes her eyes shut
embarrassed
Her snow pants turn dark around her bottom
Slowly a puddle of urine forms on the chair between her and Lynch
Below them, the urine falls into the snow and disappears
Parker's eyes swell as she begins to cry what's left of her tears
She is emotionally degraded and devastated
80
As her nose begins to run, she instinctively wipes her hand across it
taking a small piece of the dead flesh off of her cheek with it
She doesn't even feel it
: 73
-                                         73 They both sleep
Finally, Lynch stirs and checks Parker to see if she is still breathing
It appears she is not
Hey
hey Parker
He lightly shakes her
Nothing
(cont'd) Parker wake up
He shakes her harder and she comes to with a gasp
What
Shit,  thought you stopped breathing
He notices her skinned cheek
Her ear tips are now completely blackened
What's wrong
Nothing
She studies his eyes
Clearly something is very wrong
(cont'd) How about you help me up again and we try and get out of here
81
Yeah
74
-                                       74 From beneath the chair we see shards of ice and snow fall onto the ground
Lynch is once again trying to maneuver himself up onto the chair back as Parker holds him steady
1
2
3- He hoists himself up onto the cable briefly, but after just a few seconds, he returns his feet to the chair back
Parker holds onto his legs tightly
(cont'd) feel like  gained about 100 pounds overnight
It was all that pizza talk
have no strength
Then don't do this
Lynch tries again
He hoists himself up, but bails instantly
like a trainer giving up on his 100th pull up
Damn it
He settles back down into the assumed position on the chair
Maybe later
What
Like 'm gonna feel better if  wait a little longer should have done it last night while  still had some strength
82
There's more snow fall on the ground and it's all fresh
Maybe the jump won't be as bad now
Even if it was a foot deeper- it wouldn't break that fall
should have just climbed across last night
had strength
had adrenaline
What do you want me to do
Nothing
Let's sit and do nothing
She reaches into her pocket and removes her cigarettes
The box is damp, but the cigarettes inside are still dry
She starts to remove one but her gloved left hand and her numb right hand make her fumble the pack
: 75
-                                75 The pack of cigarettes falls into the snow
(
) : 76
-                                  76 The two are bundled together as the evening winds start to pick up
Again, they speak without emotion
It's conversation just to let themselves know that they are still alive
How come you never have a girlfriend
How am  supposed to answer that
83
mean, you're a decent guy
Girls dig you
But you never stay in a relationship
had a serious girlfriend once
High School doesn't count
No, post-high school
Freshmen year
Who
This girl Annie
met her at orientation
We emailed all summer and when we started school, it was like we were already going out totally just felt it with her, you know
We were into a lot of the same stuff, which was cool
She was way into Aerosmith
had seen them fifteen times, she had seen them twenty
How cool is that
What happened
She um
same favorite movie as me
It was like soul mates and that stuff you read about
So then
what happened
Same old shit
(then) No
You know what happened
She liked another guy
This fucking fraternity douchebag named Dean who kept sending her flowers and stuff
don't know who it was exactly, but every time 'd go to her room some guy named "Dean" had left her notes and shit
84
Why did she keep it
Was she trying to make you jealous
don't know
think she just liked getting attention
So she dumped you for a frat guy
No
dumped her
We were in the cafeteria, right
And  was sitting facing her, facing the wall
and she was facing everyone in the cafeteria behind me
And kept seeing her smiling at someone behind me and like, almost laughing
So  was like, "who are you laughing at
" You know
Like "what the hell is going on
" And she's like, "Dean's making fun of you
" (beat) So  turn around, and 'm like ready to kick the shit out of this guy
And all  see is a sea of fucking random people
Just all of these faces
This guy could see me and was making eyes with my girlfriend
but  couldn't see him
That's messed up
've never felt so stupid and bad in my life
(then) So  left
You just walked out
Yup
Told her to go laugh with "Dean the Frat guy"
was out
That sucks
85
Maybe
maybe  shouldn't have been so quick to walk out
Maybe needed to have a thicker skin and not be such a sensitive bitch, don't know
Sometimes  think was just insecure and maybe screwed up
You should call her
When you get home
You could tell her that
can't
(laughs) She's dating Dean
Emotion has fought it's way to the surface again
Parker and Lynch share a nervous laugh together
She turns away from him
After a few seconds, her laughs turn to tears
should have done something
There was nothing either of us could have done
sat here and let him die
No, you didn't
We didn't let him die
There was nothing we could have done
He jumped down there to try and save us,
He was the one
He was the boy was gonna marry
Funny story
First grade, we all get left there for the day by our mom's
You know, alone in real school for the first time without our folks around
And Dan
Dan was this sort of chubby kid when he was little
86
Parker laughs
(cont'd) Nah, fuck it
He was a fat ass
Parker laughs harder
(cont'd) And all the mom's left and he just wouldn't let go of his mom's hand
He just stood there after she left, at the front of the room, crying like a total pussy
Sounds like Dan
You have no idea
But then, the teacher
Mrs
What was her name
Mrs
Schifrin
She was trying everything to get the fat kid to stop crying
And so she says, "Well Dan, is there anyone else in the class that you know
" You know, like, "Maybe there's a friend you'd like to sit with
" And the fucker points right at me and says "him"
had never seen this kid before in my life, you know
But for whatever reason, he points right at me
And so he had to sit with you
For a week
For my whole first week of school 'm sharing my little cubby desk with his fat ass
Parker laughs through her tears
(cont'd) Douchebag
never let him forget it
loved him so much
Lynch is determined
87
But if he died only for you and me to give up and die up here, that's bullshit
Yes
So  need you to pull it together, and we're gonna get out of this shit
We're gonna get out of this for Dan
Alright
Yes
Lynch bites his severely chapped lips
Help me up
: 77
-                                77 Lynch feebly climbs up on the chair back and reaches up for the cables
let's try this again
He steadies himself on the chair, which sways in the wind
the bolts connecting the arm to the cables
The metal is bending with a light squeaking sound
Are you
Do you have it
Lynch just grunts as he reaches and tries to steady himself on the chair that is swinging at an odd angle under his weight
The camera swivels up to reveal his shaky feet trying to find footing on the chair back and the ground far below him
Rrruh
He pushes off hard and grabs on to the cabling
88
As his foot pushes fast on the chair, it swings at an impossible angle
the connecting bolts as one of them
Oh my god
The chair leans hard to the right side, forcing Parker to slide down into what is now the bottom corner of the chair
The chair is still in place, but it is now hanging by one bolt and at a severe angle
(cont'd) Joe
Joe tries to look back over his shoulder, struggling to keep himself on the cable against his own body weight and wet clothing
Shit
Hold on, just hold on
Another grunt and Lynch makes another big move forward
The camera booms up above him, shooting straight down at the distance between his dangling body and the frozen ground
Tight on his gloved hands as they slowly slide forward on the metal cable
Lynch squeezes his eyes shut and takes another reach forward
Behind him, Parker looks on in agony
She is holding her breath and whispering
(whispered) Please God
please God
please God
The metal arm above her groans under the pressure that the one remaining bolt is under
Looking at the arm in this state, it is especially eerie to imagine how these metal chairs even stay attached to the cables in the first place
Lynch takes another move forward
Rrrugh
89
You can do it
Please do it
Lynch reaches forward again
and his hand slips on the icy cable
He momentarily hangs by one arm
Arrrrr
He reaches up and grabs hold again
his strength is weaning
(through gritted teeth) Got it
Another few quick reaches forward and he is more than halfway across to the next chair
From Lynch's point of view we can see his feet floating above the earth and hear the sound of his own heart beat
His own pained breathing fills his ears
It's only now that he sees two of the wolves watching him from the bushes
(cont'd) Motherfucker
The wind blows hard against him, swaying his body back and forth as he momentarily rests
(cont'd) 've got an audience
Parker looks down, just in time to see one of the wolves duck back into the bushes
Her movement makes the chair groan harder
The cable twangs loudly between Lynch's shaky movements and the twisted metal that holds the arm in place
The chair is gonna fall
No
No it's not
Slowly he makes his way the remaining distance and positions himself over the other chair
90
He drops down onto it, sending shards of ice cascading down into the snow below
He quickly sits down, breathing heavy and clutching the sides of the chair
(cont'd) Take that Jenny Bluth
You made it
Not yet
Halfway
He looks behind him at the next chair
Just a few feet back from it is the giant green lift pole
and a ladder
(cont'd) Please
He stands up on the chair and reaches up to the cable
He is weak
Very weak
(cont'd) Parker
want you to throw my extra pole as far as you can this way
She can't quite hear him
What
said When  get on the ground 'll need some defense
Parker nods
She takes Lynch's ski pole and tries to throw it as far as she can back at him
The action forces another terrifying metallic groan from the arm above her, and her chair swings back and forth from the motion
Oh shit
91
The pole lands under the second chair, splitting the distance between where she is and where the tree is
(cont'd) Sorry
Hey
Halfway to me is better than up there with you, right
(to himself) Shit
He starts to pull himself up again, but turns back to Parker one more time
The chair has settled down
(cont'd) Stay perfectly still
'm gonna get you home,
He pulls himself up, straining hard
(cont'd) Rrrrugh
This gets the wolves attention
In the bushes their ears and eyes perk up to the sky, watching their potential next meal grapple with the high wire cable
With reserved strength, Lynch shimmies across the cable as quickly as he can
Back at Parker's chair, she eyes the bending metal bolt that is keeping her from plunging to the ground
Tears stream down her face again
(whispered) Please god, don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
He stops once to catch his breath, but begins moving as quickly as possible
Finally, he reaches the second chair behind them and drops down into it
Looking at the lift pole from this position, he can clearly see that it wasn't as close to the chair as it looked
92
But it's possible
Shit
Parker needs to yell to hear him now
He assesses the situation
It's going to take a big leap to try and get near the ladder and he is winded beyond belief
'
'    ,
(to himself) The two stare at each other from the distance
Both of their weather beaten faces are a mess
Parker is buried in the corner of the chair closest to the ground, holding on to the back of it to keep herself steady
Stoically, Lynch turns away from her and takes a deep breath
He climbs up onto the chair back and looks down
Parker closes her eyes and prays
The wolves below do not break their stare
Their hungry eyes are willing Lynch to fall from the chair
It's now or never
(cont'd) Yaaaaugh
He throws himself off of the chair and towards the ladder
93
He lands and hooks his arm around a rung
With a  his arm dislocates from it's socket, but he is hooked on to the ladder
(cont'd) Rrrrugh
With his bad arm dangling by his side, Lynch works his way down the icy metal ladder
Finally he reaches the ground and his body falls with a into the snow
Oooof
The wolves' ears are at attention
They watch carefully from the safety of the bushes
One, the , takes a cautious single step forward and waits
(then) The wolf leader begins a dangerously slow and cautious walk towards Lynch's body
One step at a time
: 78
-                               78 As the camera tracks away from the approaching wolf and towards Lynch
it is revealed that he is only winded
He feels his body for damage, wincing at what can only be a broken rib or two
His right arm is twisted at an odd angle and by the look on Lynch's face, it must be either broken or fractured in addition to being dislocated

The wolf surveys the situation and stops in his tracks
The other wolves watch from the bushes

-                                     79 Hurry
Please
: 80
-                                80 Lynch gets himself to his feet
His body is in massive pain, but his adrenaline is going strong enough for him to fight through it
He moves quickly back up to the area underneath the middle chair
The leader growls
Drool drips down from beneath it's hungry mouth as it takes a step back
(
) '
The wolf leader advances on Lynch
Lynch makes it to the ski pole just in time and brandishes it defensively at the creature
(cont'd) Come on
Try something, fucker
The wolf stares back at him, growling
Their eyes are locked
Lynch swings the pole at it angrily
(cont'd) 95
The leader shies away but growls harder
(cont'd) second wolf rushes Lynch from behind and grabs his injured arm by the jacket and pulls back and forth
(cont'd) The rest of the wolves quickly reveal themselves in the bushes and slowly saunter up towards the impending kill

-                                  81 Parker looks from Lynch to the ground way below her
(crying) : 82
-                             82 Lynch tries to fight off the wolf with his free arm
Finally, he is able to plunge the ski pole deep into the wolf's body
The wolf  in pain and scampers away towards the safety of the pack
The impending wolves, stop their slow march and wait
This food still has some fight left in it
He moves as fast as he can towards the area under Parker's chair, swinging his weapon like a madman all the while
The wolves only stare
96
Finally, he reaches the area and grabs Dan's snowboard, still sticking up in the snow
(cont'd) Parker, 'm gonna go get help
Don't move and 'll be back as fast as  can
Parker sobs
Just don't move
'm getting help
Without hesitation, Lynch throws down Dan's board and lays his body on top of it
Pushing off he begins to slide quickly down the hill
: 83
-                                       83 From Parker's , she watches him disappear down the hill
But mere seconds later, the pack of wolves gives chase and follow suit behind him over the horizon
Only the creaking of the strained metal chair arm can be heard now
Parker sobs quietly to herself
: 84
-                                     84 From a distance, Parker's broken chair dangles dangerously in the night air
Her body is slumped in the corner
Still
: 97
85
-                                       85 Parker is not moving in her chair
: 86
-                                     86 The morning sun hits Parker's pale face
Is she dead
Parker opens her eyes
She must have drifted off for the night
She looks to the tree-line around her
The sun is coming up
She tries to move her body to look back in Lynch's direction and the chair argues back at her with another loud groan and cable noise
(to herself) Lynch
There is no sign of anyone or anything in the direction down the hill behind her
Slowly a look of great determination comes over her face
She raises the safety bar
There is no more time to think
She is going to die one way or another
Slowly, Parker turns her body around towards the seat of the chair
Holding on to the metal beams that make up the chair, she beings to lower herself, inch by inch, off of the side
-
The lone metal bolt protests the movement and makes metallic threats to snap
Parker keeps lowering herself until her entire lower body is dangling below the chair
gust of wind pushes against the chair, straining the arm
98
Parker concentrates and slowly tries to hold up her weight as she inches her body even lower
Smoothly, slowly, almost there-
The bolt gives way
The chair lurches down at an even greater angle, sending Parker off of the side
(cont'd) No longer attached with the safety bolts, the chair falls several feet and then stops
It is now hanging only by the one weak thread of cabling that was used to initially wire it to the main line
Parker's hands catch at the base of the chair, and she is dangling fully beneath it
While it is still a long drop
her feet are now a good 10 feet closer to the ground, if not more
The metal wire will not hold for more than a few seconds
The chair is going to fall
Parker closes her eyes
All sound cuts out except for her quick breathing and her heartbeat
The camera shows us how much the last flimsy wire does not like this movement as it stretches and the chair sways in the wind
Slowly she looks down and prepares herself to fall
The camera inches closer in to her face from below
Her heartbeat and breathing are all we hear until finally
She let's go
As her body falls from the chair, the flimsy wire finally gives way and the rickety metal seat plummets straight down to the ground after her
: 99
87
-                              87 Parker lands hard and sound instantly returns to her
She rolls to the side as the chair crashes down in her very spot
She is in tremendous pain but feels the solid ground beneath her like a sailor who has found land for the first time in years
Surveying the damage- her ankle is badly broken underneath the side of the chair that landed on it
Her boot is at an unnatural angle
Adrenaline overtakes her pain as she lifts the chair up and removes her foot from beneath it
She looks around for her snow board, but with all of the fresh snowfall it is buried and gone
Parker lays her body down flat on her jacket and begins to push herself down the mountainside as quickly as she can
: 88
- ,                  88 Parker comes down the hill, gaining some speed on her awkward coat/sled
As she makes her way she spots a tree
with bright red blood splayed out in the snow around it
Cautiously she slows herself down
(meekly) Joe
From Parker's , the camera slowly reveals what is just beyond the bloody tree
But the look on Parker's face tells us everything we need to know first
There, in the brush on the side of the trail beyond the tree, is the pack of wolves
Some still feeding
Others resting attentively
They are circled around Lynch's bloody, half-eaten remains
100
Quick shots of his jacket, his boots, and his gloved hand all flash before Parker's devastated eyes
She slows herself to a complete stop now
Not knowing what to do
One of the feeding wolves hears this and looks back to see Parker just a few feet away
It is the pack leader
Lynch's blood pools from it's jaws
It's ears go back and it growls loudly at Parker
She makes eye contact with the beast, who stares back at her, almost daring her to try and take it's treasure
Others from the pack look up, distracted briefly, but then go back to feeding
Parker and the pack leader lock eyes
Finally, the leader turns away from Parker, back to his food
Back to his family
Though her face is emotionless, Parker's eyes are swollen with tears as she continues on her way down the mountain side
She is free
: 89
-                                  89 Parker continues down the treacherous trail as the snow falls around her
Occasionally she hits bumps and turns that cause her to spill from her awkward coat/sled
but she pulls herself back on and continues to make her way down the hill stoically
: 90
-                                  90 Parker reaches the bottom of the hill
Grunting and crying from the pain, she crawls over on her belly and begins to drag herself towards the parking lot
101
91
-                                       91 Parker drags her devastated body into the street
Just as she gets there
races past with it's windshield wipers blaring
Narrowly missing being splattered, she collapses in the dirty road
There are no more cars to be seen
She is alone
All that she can do is clutch the ground
And then
Another car approaches in the distance
She holds her hand up weakly
Please
Stop
: 92
-                                          92 (male, 50's) is cautiously driving down the wet icy road
He reaches down to adjust the radio
He looks back up to reveal Parker's body in the road in front of him
93
-                                     93 He swerves with a loud
Partially off the road in a skid, his car comes to a stop
Instantly he jumps out and runs to the body on the road
Hey
Are you
Hello
Parker is not moving
102
He runs over to her side
(cont'd) Lady
Are you alright
Parker looks up at him and starts to cry with relief
(cont'd) Hold on, hold on- we're gonna get you help
He lifts her up into his arms and races her back to his car
: 94
-                                      94 The driver drives frantically, speaking into his cell phone
(into phone) don't know
found her laying in the road alone
Looks like she was in some sort of accident
Right outside of Mount Holliston
'm taking her to you now
95
,   -                            95 Through the passenger side window we see Parker's blank face
If we didn't know better, we'd think she was a rotten cadaver at this point
Reflected in the glass are the lights of a  ' restaurant store front that goes past
Her eyes blink at the sign
Hold on, Ma'am
The hospital is 10 minutes away
You're gonna be
The camera is tighter on her eyes
(cont'd) You're gonna be
Tight on just one eye
103
(cont'd) (now in Dan's voice) You're gonna be , baby
Her eye closes
