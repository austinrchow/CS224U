We're in a  studio
The presenter is , (40)
Today we welcome Brian Clough as he starts his new job as manager of Leeds United, taking over from Don Revie - the most successful manager in the club's history, under whom Leeds have won everything
not  everything
Not won the European Cup
but pretty much everything else
Daunted
Daunted
Not at all, Austin
Looking forward to it
The biggest challenge of your life, and you'll be without Peter Taylor, for the first time
Your lifelong professional colleague
Yes, Pete's at Brighton now
He had the opportunity to come with me, but Brighton was his choice
Leeds was mine
surprising choice, some might say
Because you've been very vocal in your criticism of them over the years
have
(  ) 5      :                                                5 You've accused players of dirty tactics, cheating, dissent, foul play
You called Norman Hunter, Norman "Bites yer legs" Hunter, you've said Peter Lorimer falls when no one touches him
And  was right
'm curious
Why do you now show such alacrity to joining them after such vituperative criticism of them for so long
Goodness, it's going to take me half an hour to explain all those words for a start
Laughter from the camera
(cont'd) Football is a beautiful game, Austin
It needs to be played beautifully think Leeds have sold themselves short

( ) they've been champions but they've not been good champions in the sense of wearing the crown well
They've not been loved
But then that's hardly surprising, given the type of operation there's been in place there
5B
-                              5B continues
Football clubs are like families, footballers are sensitive people
'd like to bring a little warmth into the set-up

who has long been regarded as a father figure in Leeds
And now you're coming in as the outsider, the enemy even, after all the things you've said in public, coming in and taking ouver as STEPfather

(  ) 5D     :                                                  5D Don't you expect some degree of resentment to this
would accept and expect a strangeness, initially, it's   perfectly normal
But it won't be long   before they realise 'm a fair man
kind man
And maybe under me they   can experience what it's like to   be in a happy family, after all
How can you be sure they weren't happy with Don all along
They wouldn't have played football that way if they were happy

We've had a phone-call
Not so much a phone-call
Bloody tirade
From Don
They only went and rung him
And ran some of your quotes by him
About how unhappy the players were
What "bad champions"
Looking for a response
(shudders to himself) Bloody got one, as well
He's gone berserk
He had it coming
He shouldn't have done that piece in the Mirror should he
Saying he thought  was a daft choice
He's entitled to his opinions
And 'm entitled to mine

Thank you
'm the best old one, too
also did it under the assumption that you'd be coming here wanting the best for the club
For the city of Leeds
So why do  still get the feeling this is all about you and Don
Of course it's just about me and Don
Always has been
But instead of putting frowns on your foreheads, o ye elders of Leeds, in your blazers and brass fucking buttons, it should put big white Colgate smiles on your big white faces, because it means  won't sleep and won't eat until  take whatever that man's achieved and beaten it -- beaten it so  never have to hear the name "Don Fucking Revie" again -- beat it so the only name anyone sings in their Yorkshire ale houses, raising their stinking jars to their stinking mouths, is Brian Clough

What  ' come into it for was to be lectured by a cocky little twat from the North East
But the way  see it, there's no point being in this game unless you want to beat the best, and be the best, and that's all the people of Derby want
To see their team on top of the tree, Derby, Derby Uber Alles, and if it's really their interest you have at heart, not just impressing your friends in the Director's box, suggest you keep your eyes on your road haulage business, keep your opinions to yourself and start signing some fucking cheques, there's a good lad
Leave the running of this football club to the professionals
But professionals ' run the club, Brian, the Chairman does
And if it's true, that football is all about money, and that's the way it's going, that's suits us Chairmen just fucking fine

If  could offer Mr

some of these allegations against Leeds United and his fellow professionals are an absolute disgrace

Ooooh
(shudders playfully) Don't mention that name to me
It's really like the other House of Commons
You hate to mention him
Why
hate to mention him why
Because he's a very talented man and  don't like him
The audience laughs
(cont'd) He's a very, very talented man and his record is unsurpassable
But  just happen not to like him
And  don't like the way he goes about football either
Football is a game of opinion and there are perhaps people in your profession who don't like the way you do your bit
Sure

Brian, you've been called big-headed, arrogant, brash, the lot - By your profession, John, yeah
Sure
And a whole of it right too
And a whole lot of it wrong
Fine
'll concede that
So how would you define your approach to management, apart from being brilliant
All laugh
(laughing, rubbing eye) Good lad
Thank you for the compliment
It's very, very difficult when you get asked a question like that

It's come to you very young
Are you surprised

It's nice isn't it
For the good guys to win for once
Which for you was the most important match to win and the best performance from your point of view
Beating Leeds United, obviously
Always a particular pleasure that
Brian, you've also done it on comparatively small gates, which know has niggled you a little bit during the season
Niggled me, David, it's absolutely made me blazing
To be honest,  know what  want to achieve,  know what the people of Derby want us to achieve, but when you've got a chairman not wanting to put his hand in his pocket
, the highest rating talk show on
(cont'd) You ever see eighty five or perhaps ninety percent of chairmen talking - 'd love a few chairmen on your programme occasionally -  believe the very sight of them brings the game into disrepute (some clap in the audience)
And every time they open their mouths it kills it
Because the very thing they've given me a lot of stick about over the years - about talking too much and going on television too much, there are the very people who can put two words together and its rather embarrassing to me that a man - or men - can stop me talking to people like you
love football
It's deep, it goes right down through
It's in every nerve, vein, you name it
It consumes me
And when  have to come and talk about like the passions of football to come out
Because there are not enough in the game

accept without any shadow of a doubt that  talk too much, apart from on this show

Full stop
And that's where you'd still fucking be if it wasn't for me; at the foot of the bloody Second Division, where nobody remembered you and nobody had heard of you

Nobody else but him

The Post Office Tower
And then he jumps off
And he's falling down, down and down and down, the sixteenth floor, the fifteenth floor, the fourteenth, and that's when he hears the phone ringing

And gets two unexpected shocks
The first is that his  is already asleep
The second is, there is a tear running down his own cheek

This is Martin Hughes
He runs Mercedes here in the North
(double-takes) What
We hear that's what you like to drive
Mercedes
It's
what  used to drive at Derby
Yes
Well, we can't have Leeds United being outdone by Derby County, can we
So Martin here is going to take you over to his showroom and get you sorted out

You're picking the wrong enemy

Have you seen where they are
Bottom of the third division
And we can get them out of there
Like that
We did it with Hartlepools
We did it with Derby
We cared about Hartlepools and Derby
We're from the North, Pete
What do we care about Brighton
Bloody Southerners
Look where we are
We're almost in France
Hey, they've got money, this lot
And ambition
And get a lungful of that air
It'd be good for my health
You can't manage a team that's not your own people
Not what you know
Anyway the Protest Movement in Derby is still in full flow
We could still get our jobs back
No, we won't
It's over, Brian
They'll never take us back
Not now
What about proper clubs
Like Manchester United
Or Spurs
Or England, now Alf's gone

Then what are you doing here, Keith
Because from what 'm reading in my paper, and from what  hear on the jungle drums, you've got a bit of a problem at home with your manager flirting with the England job

Good evening
Tonight the football world was stunned by the news that Brian Clough has been sacked as manager of Leeds United
We'll be talking not just to Brian Clough, but also to the man he replaced, who's success he couldn't emulate, Don Revie
turns to
(cont'd) To Brian Clough first of all
What's your reaction to being sacked in this fashion
Obviously, Austin, my initial reaction is one of shock at finding myself here with Revie
See
Not so easy to make accusations when it's to someone's face
but in answer to your question, six weeks is hardly a long time to be given a chance in any job
would hope Revie would get a lot longer time in his
(  ) 89A 144     : (2)                                           144 Do you consider it was possible to step into your shoes, Don Revie
To replace you
Being very, very honest,  think it was a difficult job for anyone to do
But  do feel Brian Clough,  won't call him Clough because  won't take him down like that
Thank you
(  ) 90 144     : (3)                                               144 do feel he made it harder for himself than he need have
How did  do that, Don
Shooting his mouth off about how dirty my players were
Well, you  dirty, Don
That's not true
The last four seasons, we've topped the charts for entertaining football
And before that, you also topped the disciplinary charts
You should have been docked points and sent to the second Division
And in fact, you went on record and said so, Brian Clough
Again and again
That Leeds should, in fact, be relegated
And  was right
Do you think that might have hurt your chances of success when you then came to manage them
Of course it did
The things he said
Why, man
Why did you take the job in the first place
Because  thought it was the best job in the country
Of course it was the best job in the country
was taking over the League Champions
(  ) 90aA 144     : (4)                                          144 You were
You were taking over the best bunch of players you'd ever seen
(  ) 90A 144     : (5)                                           144 And  fancied winning the league, and winning Europe, and doing it better than you
There's no way you  win it better
But that's the only hope 've got
only lost four matches
Well,  can only lose three
No, no, no, no
And still play attractive, clean football
Without cheating
See, there he goes again
Listening to you,  am struck that this is not just a business matter for you both
It's more than that
It's personal
Am  right
Well, we're very different people, Don and
We have different styles
In football and in life
'm a warm man
An idealist
do believe in faeries, and that is my outlook
Don is different
There's a hardness to him
hardness
Maybe he's not even aware of it
But he's a cold person
You don't  me
(  ) 91 144     : (6)                                               144 And that lack of warmth
That coldness was there
Permeated the club when arrived
totally refute that
The atmosphere at Leeds was like a family
happy family
You ask any of my players signed most of them personally
Knew their backgrounds
Their parents
Their streets
was a father to them
In that club every morning
Massaging those boys
Did you do that for them
They would never have let me
Did you try
You didn't even try soaped those boys down with my own hands
You just went to Leeds with no thought for the club, no thought for the players
Just on some kind of mad personal vendetta with me
Well are you surprised
What else was going to do
After what you did
What did  do
'mon, Don
You know exactly

See
even remember the date
You came to Derby County, the third round of the  Cup, and you refused to shake my hand
looks up
The  look up
Never
Matter of principle
always shake the other manager's hand
You shook Peter Taylor's hand, and my trainer, Jimmy Gordon's
Then  probably didn't see you
No, you saw me Don
But considered me beneath you
Looked down on me
And dismissed me
Just like you did every other club and every other manager in the country
(  ) 93 144     : (8)                                               144 Never would  knowingly refuse to shake a colleague's hand
The truth is,  probably just didn't know who you were
(a knowing smile) "Didn't know who  was
" Pull the other one
It's the truth
(  ) 94 144     : (9)                                           144 (blurts out) Well, you certainly know it
All heads turn
That came out unintentionally loud
Oh, we  know it now
(a beat) We know you as the man who's constant outbursts, his defaming of fellow professionals, have brought this game, this beautiful game into disrepute
Who had one of the best jobs in the country, at Derby, and managed to get the sack
Who had one of the best partners in the game, in Peter Taylor, and threw him away
Who was given the greatest gift in British football Leeds United, a team that in ten years hasn't finished outside the top four, and took them to the bottom of the first division
Yes, it's fair to say we all know who you are now
's eyes widen
, gentlemen, we're going to have to leave it there
Well, let's see where we are in a year's time, Donald Revie
Dear oh dear
Let's see where we both are in five
That's it for tonight's show
'd like to thank Brian Clough and Don Revie for joining me
Thank you, Austin
