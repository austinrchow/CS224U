, Screenplay by Ann Peacock Based on the novel by Lewis Transcribed by Stuart Random German Ejaculations Edmund Get Away from there
What do you think you're doing
Peter
(grabs Edmund) Come on
To the shelter, now
(grabs things from next to her bed with a flashlight, notices Lucy in bed) Lucy, come on
Lucy
Pevensies are running to the shelter, we hear them shouting, Hurry up
and
Edmund turns around, as if forgetting something
Wait, dad
Run inside, grabs picture gets blown against the wall Come on idiot (Throws Edmund onto the ground and starts shouting) Why do you always have to be so selfish
You only think about yourself
Why can't you ever do as you're told
Peter slams the shelter door Attention, would all parents ensure that their parents have the appropriate identification papers
You warm enough
Now honey you have to keep this on you
Be sure and keep this on
If Dad were here, the war would be over, and we wouldn't have to go If dad wasn't fighting and the war was over we wouldn't have to go
You will listen to your brother, won't you Edmund
Look after the others will mum You be a big girl now Susan, There now
off you go
Come on, we've got to stay together now
Everything's going to be okay Peter
(Susan Snatches papers) know how to get on a train Bye Mom, we'll miss you Good-Bye my darlings The Professor knew we were coming
Perhaps we've been incorrectly labeled
Mrs
Macready
'm afraid so
Is that it then
Haven't you brought anything else
No, ma'am
It's just us
Small favours
While driving the horse over the lawn, some comments like giddy up, good girl The professor is unaccustomed to having children in his house, and as such, there are a few rules we need to follow
There will be no shouting' or running', no improper use of the dumbwaiter, touching of the historical artifacts and above all, there shall be no disturbing' of the Professor
- German aircraft carried out several attacks on Great Britain last night The sheets feel scratchy Wars don't last forever, Lucy
We'll be home soon
If home's still there
Isn't time you were in bed
, Mom
To Lucy You saw the outside
This place is huge
We'll be able to do whatever we want
Tomorrow's going to be great
Really
** Gas-tro-vas-cu-lar
Come on, Peter Gas-tro-vas-cu-lar Is it Latin
Yes
Is it Latin for worst game ever invented
We could play hide-and-seek but we're already having so much fun
Please, please, please
One
two
three
four
(pushes Lucy) Get out
was here first
Lucy finds wardrobe with Peter counting in the background
Eight four, eighty five
/ (Gasp) Looks behind and finds Narnia
Tumnus shows up (slowly walking out as Lucy picks up packages) Uh,
gk, ch (random noises) Were you hiding from me
Huh, um, n
n
no,
didn't want to scare you, if you don't mind my asking
what are you
Why, 'm a faun
And you must be some beardless dwarf
'm not a dwarf, 'm a girl
And actually 'm tallest in my class
But you're saying, you're a daughter of Eve
Well, my mum's name is Helen
Yes, but you are, in fact, human
Of course
What are you doing here
Well,  came in through the wardrobe in the spare room, and- Spare Oom, is that in Narnia
Narnia
What's that
My dear girl, you're in it
Everything from the lamp post, all the way to castle Cair Paravel on the Eastern Sea, every stick and stone, every icicle, is Narnia, This is an awfully big wardrobe 'm sorry, please allow me to introduce myself, my name is Tumnus Glad to meet you, Mr
Tumnus
*extends hand* 'm Lucy Pevensie
Oh, you shake it
Why
- don't know
People do it when they meet each other
Lucy Pevensie, from the shining city of War Drobe in the far land of Spare Oom, how would it be if you came and had tea with me
Oh
Well, thank you very much
But probably should be getting back
Oh, come on
It's not every day  get to make a new friend
And there's a
roaring fire
And toast and cakes
And maybe
we'll even break into the sardines
Well, maybe for just a little while
if you have
sardines
By the bucket load, Come Along
' Can  help you with that
Why thank you
Lucy looks at the picture
Oh
That is my father
He had a nice face
You look just like him
No, were not alike at all really
My father is fighting in the war
My father went away to war too
but that was a very long time ago
before this dreadful winter
Winter isn't all bad
There's ice skating and snow ball fights
Oh
And Christmas
We haven't had Christmas in a hundred years here
(shocked) No presents for a hundred years
But, oh, you would have loved Narnia in spring
The Dryads and the Fauns would dance all night
but we never got tired
And oh, the music
Such music
Would you
like to hear some now
yes please (gets flute out) Now, are you familiar with the Narnia lullabies
(shakes her head): No, 'm afraid 'm not Good, because this probably won't sound anything like one
Oh  must go It's too late for that now 'm such a bad faun No
You're the nicest faun 've ever met
Then 'm afraid you've had a very poor sampling
'm sure you're very sorry, and you'll never do it again
It's not something  have done, Lucy Pevensie
It's something 'm doing
What are you doing
'm kidnapping you
It's the White Witch, the one that makes it always winter, and never Christmas
She told me that If  ever was to come across a son of Adam or a daughter of Eve,  am supposed to turn it over to her
But  thought you were my friend / We must move quietly the woods are full of her spies, even some of the trees are on her side think so
(Tumnus starts to return her handkerchief, but she gives it back) Keep it, you need it more than  do
Tumnus laughs, and touches Lucy's nose
Go
Come on, go
Lucy runs off, and Mr
Tumnus returns to his home Lucy heads for the wardrobe 98, 99, 100
Ready or not here  come
'm back, 'm back, it's alright, Shhh, he's coming
You know, 'm not sure if you two have quite gotten the idea of this game
but weren't you wondering where  was
That's the point
That's why he was seeking you
Does this mean  win
don't think Lucy wants to play anymore
Susan looks in the wardrobe
The only wood in here is the back of the wardrobe
One game at a time Lu, we don't all have your imagination
But  wasn't imagining
that's enough Well  believe you
You do
Yah, didn't  tell you about the football field  found in the bathroom closet
Why don't you just stop it, you always have to make everything worse
Grow up
Shut up
You think you're dad, but you're not
(storms out) well, that was nicely handled
(walks away too
) It was really there
Susan's right
That's enough
Lucy closes the wardrobe and she dissolves to night Pan down on candle burning out, Lucy gets out boots and not slippers and takes candle
Flushing toilet as Edmund comes out and sees Lucy Follows her to wardrobe Candle blows out when she opens it and walks in as Edmund does Lucy, Lucy
hope you're not afraid of the dark (shuts door) Lucy, Lucy
Edmund is soon in Narnia, he walks around
and is amazed by it all Lucy
Lucy
think  believe you now
Hears bells
Lucy
Yah
(whipping sound) Edmund dives out of the way into the snow and then the dwarf jumps out and throws a whip around Edmunds legs Dwarf puts knife to Edmund's throat What is it Ginarrbrik
He won't let go
Is that how you address the Queen of Narnia
didn't know
Well, you shall know her better afterwards
Wait
What is your name Son-of-Adam
Edmund, your majesty
And how was it, Edmund, that you came to enter my dominion
walked through a wardrobe following my sister
Your sister
How many are you
four Edmund you look so cold
Come and sit with me here on my sledge
(Edmund joins her) Now, would like something warm to drink
Yes
your majesty
(Take vial and drops a green drop on snow that become a hot drink that the dwarf gives Edmund) How did you do that
can make anything you like
Could you make me taller
can make anything you like to eat Turkish Delight Drop once again comes down and makes the box of Turkish Delight and the Dwarf gives it to Edmund 'd love to see your family They're nothing special have no children of my own and you are such a good little boy ( never could hear those words right) where could see, one day, you becoming prince of Narnia - maybe even king
(mouth full) Really
(nods) Of course you'd have to bring your family
They're nothing special Oh, Peter will be king too
No
But a king needs servants
- guess  could bring 'em
Beyond these woods, do you see those two little hills
My house is right between them
You'd love it there Edmund, it has whole rooms simply stuffed with Turkish Delight
Couldn't  have some more now
(smiles) Don't want to ruin you appetite
'm going to miss you Edmund
But we are going to see each other soon
hope so
Until then
dear one
( drives of and Ed is left alone) Edmund
Oh Edmund
(hugs her brother) saw Mr
Tumnus again and he's fine
The White Witch hasn't found out about him helping me
The White Witch
She calls herself the Queen of Narnia, but she really isn't
Edmund
Are you okay
You look awful
Well what do you expect
It's freezing
How do we get out of here
Come on
this way
(turns on the light and jumps on Peter) Peter, Peter wake up
It's there, it's really there
(rolls over still half asleep) Lucy, what are talking about
Narnia
It's all in the wardrobe, like told you
Susan comes in
Oh Lucy, you've been dreaming
No  wasn't,  saw Mr
Tumnus again
Oh, and this time - Edmund went too
You saw the faun
Well, he didn't actually go there with me
What were you doing Edmund
- was just playing along
You know what little children are like these days, they just don't know when to stop pretending (sits on his bed looking smugly at Lucy) Lucy starts to cry and runs out of the room
Susan runs after her and so does Peter - who shoves Edmund over Ow
Lucy runs down the hall and smack into the Professor, she looks up a little frightened and then starts her crying all over again, hugging him You children are one shenanigan shy of sleeping' in the stable- oh, Professor
told them you were not to be disturbed
Oh, it's alright Mrs
Macready - 'm sure there's a logical explanation
But  think this one needs some hot chocolate
Yes Professor
Come on, dear
Mrs
Macready takes Lucy down the hall
Peter and Susan turn to go *Ahem* (the two turn and follow him into his office and the Professor sits at his desk and takes some tobacco out of it's silver apple case and puts it in his pipe) You seem to have upset the internal balance of my housekeeper
We are very sorry sir, it won't happen again
It's our sister sir, Lucy
The weeping girl
Yes sir, she's upset
Hence the weeping We can handle it
(takes Susan's sleeve) Oh,  can see that
She thinks she's found a magical land in the upstairs wardrobe
What did you say
The wardrobe upstairs, Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside
Susan and Peter sit on a couch and the Professor sits in a chair across from them What was it like
Like talking to a lunatic
No, not her - the forest
You're-you're not saying you believe her
No, not her - the forest
You
you actually believe her
Well don't you
Well, logically it couldn't possibly be there
What do they teach at these schools
Edmund said they were only pretending And he's the more truthful one is he
No, this would be the first time
Well then, id your sister isn't lying and isn't mad then logically we must assume that she is telling the truth
She's your sister, isn't she
You're a family
It's high time you start acting like one
Peter winds up, goes for the bowl
Ball hits Edmund in the leg Ow
Whoops
Wake up, Dolly Daydream
Can't we play hide and go seek again
thought you said that it was a kid's game
Besides, we can all use the fresh air
Not like there's air inside Are you ready then
Are you
(smacks his bat on the ground and gets ready to hit the ball) Peter pitches the ball, hard, and Edmund whacks it good and it smashes through an upstairs window and crashes into a suit of armor
The children are looking at the broken window and the suit of armor on the floor Well done, Ed
You bowled it
Listen, Mrs
Macready is coming Run
(runs to the wardrobe and opens the door) Come on
You have got to be joking
Go
Get back
Susan and Peter fall backwards
Impossible
Don't worry, it's probably just your imagination don't suppose saying we're sorry would quite cover it
No, it wouldn't
But this might
Lucy nails Peter in the face with a snowball, he throws one back at her and a snowball fight begins
Susan hits Ed in the arm with one Ow
(rubs his arm) Stop it
(They all realize that Ed lied) You little liar
You didn't believe her either
Apologize to Lucy
(He just looks at her) Say you're sorry
(Peter steps up to him) Alright
'm sorry
That's alright, some little children just don't know when to stop pretending
(looks at him smugly) (mutters): Very funny
Maybe we should go back Can't we at lease take a look around
think Lucy must decide
all want you to meet Mr
Tumnus
Well Mr
Tumnus it is (walks into the wardrobe again) We can't just walk around in these clothes
(comes out) We can use these coats
Peter, they don't belong to us
Well  don't think the professor will mind
And if you think about it logically we are not even taking them out of the wardrobe
(Hands coat to Edmund) But that's a girl's coat
know
Start walking toward Mr
Tumnus' cave through snow and tea and
(Sees open door and runs off) They all run to Tumnus' house Who would do something like this
Edmund steps on broken picture of Tumnus's dad Peter what is that on the wall
The Former occupant of these premises, the Faun Tumnus, is under arrest and awaiting his trial on a charge of High Treason against her imperial Majesty Jadis, Queen of Narnia, Chatelaine of Cair Paravel, Empress of the Lone Islands, also to comforting her said Majesty's enemies, harbouring spies and fraternizing with Humans
signed Maugrim, captain of the Secret Police, Long live the Queen
Now we should really go
But we have to help him
It's out of our hands now Lu
You don't get it do you
'm the human
He helped
Maybe we should call the police These are the police
Besides, he's a criminal
Don't worry Lucy, we'll think of something Psst
Did that bird just 'psst' us
They step outside, they hear rustles from the bushes
Mr
Beaver approaches It's a beaver
Peter approaches the beaver, clicking his tongue Here, boy *clicks* come here
*clicks* Peter let's out his hand, Mr
Beaver stares at it then sits upright Well,  ain't gonna smell it if that's what you want
It's a talking beaver
Lucy Pevensie
Yes
Mr
Beaver hands her the handkerchief This is the handkerchief  gave to Mr- Tumnus
He gave it to me just before they took him
Is he alright
Further in
(Mr
Beaver scurries off, Susan grabs Peter by the arm) Peter, we don't know what you are doing
She's right
How do we know we can trust this beaver
He say's he knows the faun
He's a beaver
he shouldn't be saying anything
Is everything alright
Yes
We were just talking That's better left for safer corners
He means the trees
Walk to Beaver's dam through the cliffs under a bridge and then they see the Dam There is home sweet home
Oh, what a beautiful dam Mr
Beaver
Merely a trifle
Is that you Beaver
find out you've been out with Badger again 'll
Oh, they're not Badgers
never thought would see this day to Mr
Beaver You couldn't give me ten minutes warning
look at this fur
would have given you a week if  thought it would help (hee hee) Well you must be cold and hungry
Let's get you inside for some food and civilized conversation
Lucy, Susan & Peter follow Mrs
Beaver inside, Edmund see's Jadis's castle
right where it's suppose to be Enjoying the scenery, are we
Edmund shakes off that comment, & enters the dam
Mr
Beaver follows him Fish and sticks, dear
is there nothing we can do about Mr
Tumnus
well
there's hope
Yeah, there's a load full of hope
Aslan is on the move
Who's Aslan
Mr
Beaver laughs
Mrs
Beaver sees they are serious and lays her hand on Mr
Beaver Aslan
you silly little blighter
you don't know do you
Well we haven't actually been here very long He's only the king the whole wood, the true king of Narnia
and he's waiting for you
waiting for us
You got to be joking
Look, Aslan's return, Tumnus' arrest
the secret police
They're all happening because of you
You're blaming us
Not blaming you dear, thanking you
There's
a prophecy, When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone sits in if Cair Paravel in throne the evil is over and done
You know that doesn't really rhyme
know, but you're missing the point
It's long been told that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve will appear to defeat the White Witch, and restore peace to Narnia
And you think we're the ones
Well you'd better be, Aslan's already fitted out your army
think you've made a mistake; we're not heroes
We're from Finchley
think it's time we were going
But what about Mr
Tumnus
Sorry Lucy
It's out of our hands
Thank you for your hospitality
Ed, time to go- Ed
(looks around the room) 'm going to kill him
You may not have to
Has Edmund been to Narnia before
Shot of Ed walking to the Witch's castle without his coat - shot of the others trying to catch up to him Hurry up
They reach the top of the hill and see Ed going through the Witch's castle gates (shouting) Edmund
Shh
They'll hear ya
Peter starts to run after Edmund but Mr
Beaver grabs him by the sleeve of his coat Get off me
We just can't let him go
Don't you get it
He's the bait
She wants all of ya in there
To kill ya
This is all your fault
None of this would have happened if you had just listened to me in the first place
So you knew this would happen
didn't know what would happen
Stop, this fighting isn't going to help Edmund She's right
Only Aslan can save him now
Then take us to him
' Edmund is walking through the courtyard and see's Giant Rumblebuffin
He walks further in and see's a stone lion - he draws glasses and a moustache on it Edmund continues through the courtyard, he steps over what he thinks is a log of some sort
only to be lurched on by Maugrim
Stand still stranger
'm a Son of Adam,  met the Queen in the woods
Maugrim gets off him
My apologies, fortunate favourite of the queen - or perhaps not so fortunate
walks into the throne-room Wait here (Edmund sees the glorious throne, and sits on it longingly
Then, the witch comes up behind him and says, scaring him half to death
) You like it
(he jumps up startled) Ye
yes, your majesty
thought you might Tell me, you sisters, are they deaf
No and your brother, unintelligent
Well  think so, but mom says
Then how dare you come alone
Edmund, ask so little of you They just don't listen to me
Couldn't even do that
did bring them half way
There at the dam at the house of the beaver's
Well
guess your not a total lost then
Edmund approaches again
Is there any chance  may have some more Turkish delight now
Ginnabrick, our guest is hungry This way
for your num nums
Maugrim
You know what to do
Maugrim let's out a howl, Edmund realizes the horrible truth as wolves surround the castle
they charge from the castle Take them Hurry Mum, they are after us
right then
What is she doing
Don't worry, you'll thank you me later
it's a long journey and a beaver gets cranky when he's hungry
'
Do you think we should bring jam
Only if the Witch has toast
This should lead to Aslan's thought it lead to your mums
Lucy falls howling
They're in the tunnel
(run further, comes to dead end) You should have brought a map
There was no room next to the jam
He jumps out of the hole
Everyone else follow
Once Peter gets out, Lucy falls on a bunch of stone things
Lucy gets up
They all see stone animals
He was my best mate
(cries) What happened to them
This is what happens to the enemies of the White Witch
Stand still there traitor
Relax, 'm one of the good guys Well you look mighty like one of the bad guys
An unfortunate family resemblance, but we can discuss family breeding later right now we need to move
What do you suggest
The Fox stays on lower ground, The Beavers & the children are in a tree
the wolves approach Wolves break through barrier as Fox is out in centre Evening gents, Did we lose something
Don't patronized me,  know where your allegiance lies
We are looking for some humans Humans in Narnia, now that's some valuable information Where are they
Lucy cries out, Peter shushes her the fox looks around hopelessly, and then hangs his head in shame They , they , were heading North
Quickly, smell them out
they cast aside the fox , where he lays whimpering on the ground Mrs
Beaver is patching up the Fox, as the children listen to his tale are you all right
Well,  wish  could say their bark was worse than their bite
He winces in pain, and continues to talk Stop squirming
You're worse than beaver on bath day Worst day of the year Well  am afraid that is all the healing have time for
You're leaving
It has been a pleasure my Queen
have been asked by Aslan  to gather more troops
You've seen Aslan
What is He like
Like everything we have ever heard
He'll be a good help fighting the White Witch We are not planning fighting any witch Surely King Peter
We just want to get our brother back
Edmund, in chains at the witches palace
He attempts to eat the food he is given, but coughs and spits it out, because of its taste
He then attempts to drink a cup, which is frozen
He then throws it on the tray
Are you gonna eat that
(from the other prison) Edmund gives him the food
Mr
Tumnus
Your Lucy Pevensies brother
'm Edmund
You have the same nose
Edmund rubs his nose
Is your sister alright
(no answer) Is she safe
don't know
White Witch comes in and they go back to their places My wolves tore that dam apart, your little family was nowhere to be found
(Lifts Edmund off the ground) Where are they
don't know
Then you are no longer any use to me
Guard Wait they said something about Aslan Aslan
Where
Stranger has only been in Narnia a short
(Hit in head) left before  could hear anymore wanted to see you again
Guard
Yes, your majesty Release the Faun (Guard hit chains and Tumnus cries out in pain as they drop him by the Witch) Do you know why you are here
Because  believe in a free Narnia Witch stares at him coldly You're here because he (points at Edmund) turned you in
for sweeties
(turns to dwarf and guard) Take him (Tumnus) upstairs and ready my sleigh, Edmund misses his family
Now Aslan's camp is just over there by the stone table just across the frozen river
River
It's been frozen for 100 years It seems so far It's the world dear, did you expect it to be small
Smaller
They continue their journey
Dwarf brings Edmund up and he sees Tumnus turned to stone Whenever you are ready Son-of-Adam
Sleigh goes off into forest with Edmund looking at the cold White Witch Come on, before we're old If he tells me to Hurry up one more time 'm going to turn him into a big fluffy hat Hurry up Son-of-Adam
We don't have all day
He is getting kinda bossy (Bells ringing) It's her
Run
Quick down here
Maybe she's gone
'll go and have a look No, you're no good to Narnia dead
Neither are you Beaver
Thanks dear
Long pause and some noise then
hope you've been good, because there is someone here to see you
Father Christmas stands there
Merry Christmas, Sir
It certainly is, Lucy
Thanks to you
thought there was no Christmas in Narnia
It hasn't been for a hundred years
But now the Witch's power is crumbling
(he goes to his bag and throws it to the ground) Presents
Lucy, Eve's Daughter
These are for you
The juice of the fire flower
If you, or one of your friends are wounded, one drop of this cordial will restore them
And though  do not expect you to use it, this
Well,  think  could be brave enough
'm sure you could
But battles are ugly affairs
Eve's Daughter, Susan
Trust in this bow, for it does not easily miss
What happened to, 'battles are ugly affairs
' And, though you don't seem to have trouble making yourself heard, this
When you put this horn to your lips and blow it, wherever you are, help will come
Thanks
And, Peter
These are tools, not toys
The time to use them may be soon at hand
Bare them well
best be off, winter is almost over and things do pile up when you've been gone a thousand years
Long live Aslan
(he gets in his sleigh and rides off) Bye
Merry Christmas
Told you he was real
Did you hear what he said
winter is almost over
You no what that means
no more ice
Wait, maybe we should think about this
We don't have time
was just trying to be realistic No, you're trying to be smart
as usual
Wait, maybe  should go first
Maybe you should
You've been sneaking second helpings haven't you
Well you never know what meal is gonna be your last, especially with your cooking
if mum knew what we were doing
Mum's not here
(sees wolves) Oh no
Run
Wolves leap infront of them, growling & sneering
Put that down boy, someone might get hurt
(pinned down) Don't worry about me
Slit his throat
Leave now while you can, and you're brother leaves with you
Stop Peter, maybe we should listen to him
Smart girl
Don't listen to him
Kill him
Kill him now
Look, just because some man in a red suit hands you a sword doesn't make you a hero
So just drop it
No Peter
Narnia need ya
What's it gonna be Son of Adam
We're not going to wait for ever
And neither is the river
Hold onto me
Stabs sword into the ice, and they float away
They get to shore
Peter has Lucy's coat in hand, but no Lucy
What have you done
Lucy
Has anyone seen my coat
Your brother has you well looked after
Everyone laughs and embraces
don't think you'll be needing those coats any more
Walk through and see spring coming about and flowers budding as they leave there coats and head toward Aslan's Camp ,  , It's so warm here
(Cold look from Witch) think 'll go check the sleigh
We found the traitor (Carrying the Fox) He was gathering troops near the sharwood forest
Nice of you to drop by
understand you were so helpful to my wolves last night
Forgive me your majesty Don't waste my time with flattery
Not to seem rude, but  wasn't actually talking to you (Looks at Edmund) (Looks first to Edmund and than at Fox) Where is
Answer me
(About to hit him with wand) Wait
The Beavers said something about the Stone Table and an army
Thank you Edmund
It is good for this creature to see some honesty before he dies
(Fox to stone and White Slaps Edmund across face) Think who's side you are on
(turns his head) Or theirs
If it is a war Aslan wants (turns butterfly to stone) It's a war he shall get
' Why are they all staring at us
Maybe they think you look funny
Peter smiles
Oh stop your fussing Mrs
Beaver
You look lovely
Peter pulls out sword
(To Oreius) We have come to see Aslan
Tent starts to blow in breeze and everyone kneels
Aslan comes from the tent and the children kneel Welcome Peter Adam's son, Welcome Susan and Lucy daughters-of-Eve
Welcome Beavers
You have my thanks, but where is the fourth
That's why we are here
We had a little trouble along the way
He's been captured by the White Witch Captured
He betrayed them your Excellence
Then he has betrayed us all Peace Oreius
It is my fault really
was too hard on him
We all were
Sir, he's our brother
know dear and that makes the betrayal all the worse
It may be harder than you think That is Cair Paravel of the four thrones one of which you must sit as High King
(
) You doubt the prophecy No, that's just it
you're not who think  am Peter Pevensie formerly of Finnchley
Beaver also said you wanted to turn him into a hat
light laughes Peter there is a Deep Magic that rules over Narnia
It defines right from wrong and helps us fulfill destinies, both yours and mine
don't think  will be able
You were able to get your family here
Not all of them
will do what  can for Edmund
too want my family safe
Mother hasn't had a dress like this since before the war Maybe we had bring back a whole trunk load when we go home
If we go home
Sorry  guess  am like that
Remember when we use to have fun
Yes, before you go boring
Oh really (Splashes water and this continues as Susan goes to get towel and
) Now, We're very tired
We'd prefer to kill you quickly
(Throws towel) Peter and Aslan Susan's horn is blown, Peter runs to her direction, Aslan follows him Susan and Lucy Susan and Lucy are in a tree and wolf trying to get them
Peter come back through the river Aslan pins the second wolf to the ground and says to his group Stay back
This is Peter's battle
The wolf attacks him
And everyone thinks he is dead Peter
no
They run up to him, and see he is alive and looks disgusted by killing the wolf
Aslan lets go the other wolf Follow him
He'll lead you to Edmund
Peter, clean your sword
Rise, Sir Peter Wolfsbane--Knight of Narnia
Peter looks at Aslan in awe All embrace him and are excited about this Edmund is tied to tree as the Dwarf taunts him The Minotaurs on the left, send in the dwarfs first
White Witch looks at the plans and then
Aslan's army comes in and there is confusion
White Witch goes through camp and see Dwarf to tree, knife in hat and him tied and gagged
She takes the knife and looks like she's going to kill him then cuts him down You're not going to kill him
Not yet
We have work to do (turning to Otmin) ' Aslan and Edmund are on the rock above camp Peter comes out and see him and then the girls Peter stops her
Aslan motions Edmund down and they go to the group of his siblings What's done is done
There is no reason to bring up the past with your brother
Hello
Oh, Edmund (Hugs him and Susan does too) How are you feeling
'm feeling kinda tired Get some rest
and Edmund try not to wander off again
Some time later, breakfast Narnia isn't going to run out of toast Edmund then you better pack some for the journey So were going home
You are,  promised 'd keep you three safe but there's no reason  can't stay and help
but they need us
All four of us Lucy it's too dangerous
You almost drowned, Edmund was almost killed
Which is why we have to stay
They all look at him
've seen what the White Witch can do and 've helped her do it, and we can't leave these people behind to suffer for it
Lucy holds Ed's hand
Well  guess that's it then
*gets up* Where are you going
(picks up bow and quiver) To get in some practice
Susan and Lucy practice shooting at the target
Then it cuts to Peter and Edmund practicing sword fighting Come on Ed, sword hand up like Oreius showed us
The beavers come running up
Edmund's horse rears Whoa horsey
My name is Philip
Oh, sorry you better come quick the White Witch has requested a meeting with Aslan
Jadis
Jadis
Jadis arrives at the camp, Cyclops carry her bed-thingy
She hops down, and walks towards Aslan You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan
Everyone gasps
His offence was not against you
Have you forgotten the Deep Magic
Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch
was there when it was made
Then you will know that the boy belongs to me
(turns to crowd) That boy (points to Edmund) will die on the Stone Table
Come and take it then
You think that a simple threat will deny me my right, little king
Aslan knows that if  do not have blood as the law demands, all of Narnia will be overturned, and perish, in fire and water
Enough,  shall talk with you alone
(time passes and the Witch exits tent) The Witch has denounced her claim on Edmund Narnians cheer
How will  know your promise will be kept
Aslan roars
the White Witch falls into her seat and the Narnians laugh
The White Witch leaves
Aslan sighs and walks into his tent
Lucy is quietly resting, when she see's a shadow
she wakes Susan Susan
Susan see's the shadow, the two leave their tent
Aslan is leaving the camp
they follow him
and follow him
and follow him
Until- Aren't you suppose to be in bed
We couldn't sleep Please, Aslan
Couldn't we come with you
would be glad of the company tonight
(Walk further) It is time
From now on,  must go on alone
Thank you Susan
Thank you Lucy
And farewell
(later after lots of jeers towards Aslan as he walks to the Stone Table) Why doesn't he fight back
Bind him
Wait
First let him be shaved
More jeers and catcalls
Tonight, the Deep magic will be appeased, but tomorrow, we will take Narnia, Forever
You know, Aslan, 'm a little disappointed in you
Did you really think that by giving your life you would save the Human boy
Ha
You are giving up your life, and saving no one
So much for love
In that knowledge
Despair
and She plunges in the knife and Aslan's growls in pain and his eyes slowly close The great cat is
Her army cheers loudly
General, gather your army and prepare for battle
However short it may be
Otmin lets out a huge roar The girls come up and cry and lean on Aslan
Lucy gets an idea, unscrews her potion It's too late
He's gone
'm sure he knew what he was doing
We have to go
We can't just leave him here
Lucy there's not time
We have to tell the others
The Trees Back at Aslan's camp in the boys' tent Fear not my princes
come with tidings of grave news
Peter walks out of the tent
It is true, he's gone Then you'll have to lead us
There's a whole army out there waiting to follow you
can't Aslan believed you could
And so do what are your orders
Peter looks at map
you see the battle field They come, you highness, in numbers and weapons far greater then our own
Numbers do not win a battle No, but  bet they help Arrival of the Witch's army take no interest in prisoners
Kill them all Army charges, gryphons attack Look to the sky Are you with me
To the death
,
' Back to the girls at the Stone Table Lucy and Susan wake up
We should go
'm so cold
They start walking away
Stone Table cracks Susan
What have they done
Aslan appears, sending shivers down ' spine
Aslan laughs
We saw the Witch, the knife
If the Witch knew the true meaning of sacrifice, she might have interpreted the Deep Magic a little differently
For she would know that if a willing victim who had committed no treachery died in a traitors stead, the Stone Table would crack and death itself would begin to unwind
We sent the word that you were dead
Peter and Edmund would have gone to war
(draws knife) We have to help them
We will, but not alone
Now, climb on my back
We have a long ways to go and little time to get there
And you might want to cover your ears
Fall back
Draw them to the rocks
That's the signal
Get ready
Swish
Bang
Grunt
Crash
Clash
Roar
Aaaahhh
Ouch
Peter falls off his unicorn
Oreius and the rhino charge Stop
They don't
Witch ducks attack, parries blades, spins her wand and turns Oreius to stone Back to Aslan and the girls
at the Witches house Cuts to stone centaur in the Witch's castle
Lucy and Susan are looking for Mr
Tumnus
Lucy finds him and starts to cry, while Susan hugs her
Aslan walks up and breathes on Mr
Tumnus, and Mr
Tumnus is restored
He falls forward into Lucy and Susan's arm Susan this is
They hug
then they see Aslan Come, lets search the castle - others may still be trapped inside and Peter will need all the help he can get
Ed
There are too many of them
Go
Get out of here
Get the girls, and get them home
Come on, you heard him
Ed starts to leave, then sees the Witch
And starts to go back Peter said to go
Peter's not King yet
Edmund rushes down the hill and breaks the witch's sword, then she stabs him with the remainders of her wand
so the next thing that is actually said is a grunt issued from Edmund and
Edmund
(silenced) Peter and the Witch fight, then they see Aslan Impossible
Aslan rushes to kill the Witch, everything disappears It is finished
The three Pevensies reunite Where's Edmund
The dwarf hobbles up and is about to finish Edmund Edmund
(shoots arrow, kills the dwarf) Edmund coughs and gasps
Lucy pulls out her cordial and places one drop on Edmund's lips
He stops moving momentarily before gasping and sitting up When are you ever going to do are you're told
Laughing and hugging  Group Hug Lucy gets the idea to heal everyone and she walks over too someone else who is hurt
Then you see Cair Paravel, and horns blowing
The coronation of the Pevensies began
They walk up the aisle happily, and stand next to their cool chairs
Bring forth the crowns
Tumnus and Mr
Beaver bring out the crowns
(As they put on her crown) To the glistening eastern sea,  give you Queen Lucy the Valiant
To the great western woods, (puts his crown on) King Edmund the Just
To the radiant southern sun, (puts crown on) Queen Susan the Gentle
(crown put on) And to the clear northern skies, King Peter the Magnificent
Once a king or Queen of Narnia, always a king or queen
Long live King Peter
Long live Queen Susan
Long live King Edmund
And long live Queen Lucy
Aslan walking on the beach in the sunset Lucy runs out to the balcony and see him walking away We'll see him again
When
In time
you mustn't press him, He isn't a tame lion
No, but he's good
Here (pulling a hankie from his person) think you need this more than  do
she takes it and sees that Aslan has disappeared and begins to cry softly, her and Tumnus hold hands as she looks into the sunset
, You alright there Philip
Not as young as  used to be
Come on Ed
Just catching my breath What did he say, Susan
You girls stay at the castle, 'll go get the stag myself
What is this
(they get off their horse) It seems like a dream
Or a dream of a dream
Spare Oom Not again Come on She always running off These aren't branches
There coats (Voices start to change) Stop pushing
ah
(Wardrobe door flies open and all four fall on floor, the door to the room opens and the professor walks in with the ball) There you are
Now what were children doing the wardrobe
You wouldn't believe us if we told you (Professor throws ball to Peter and with a twinkle in his eye
) Try me Lucy tries to get into the wardrobe and then
don't think you'll get back in that way
you see 've already tried
Will we ever go back
expect so, probably when you least expect it
