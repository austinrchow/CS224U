Black  boots, black skin-tight pants, and a mane of thick, black hair presents a beautiful and imposing  figure
Her eyes are large and dark -- her look open and ripe
She knows what she's got, and doesn't make any excuses for it -- but the fact is she's scared as hell, possessing a  vulnerability that surprises her by its suddenness
An expensive gold chain is fastened on one boot
She scrounges through her bag -- pulls out her remaining cash
It's drastically short of what she owes and she knows it
She tosses it onto the front seat, from the cab, streaks across the street
The  lets out a  and out after her

-- stands in the shower, steam whirling about his face
He's 22 years old, matinee-idol sexy with large, dark, bedroom eyes
He headlines a slick techno-funk group called   which sports gangster suits and wide-brimmed hats
He's gifted with a wealth of self- laudatory humor which he uses like a knife, moving through life with a calm, but ruthless grace
Make no mistake, Morris is nobody's fool
His seeming out-raceousness, his charm -- every move he makes is for a calculated effect
He knows exactly what the ladies need, and doesn't mind reminding them should they forget
He breaks into a wide grin
Hair standing up like Don King, he wipes off a hand mirror, regards himself unabashedly as he brushes his teeth

,  '  -- Prince sits in front of the mirror, finishes applying his makeup
Black hair flowing, eyes wide and fantastic, he regards himself a moment before jumging up
He puts on a high-collared overcoat, grabs his guitar  moves quickly to the basement window
He hoists himself through it, disappears into the night

The Cabbie stands on the sidewalk gesticulating angrily to a
Vanity stands by the police car, obviously board, another  by her side
Her eyes are fastened on a good- looking  standing nearby
silent negotiation seems to be going on
Understanding wafts between them like a passing breeze
Without taking his eyes off her, the Businessman approaches the Cabbie, starts talking

yellow bandanna holds up his hair
The bedroom is a stands like a sentry in the middle of the floor
He turns it on, blazes a path to his closet
He yanks out a well- pressed suit, holds it against him, strikes a sexy, half-lidded pose only a mother could love-- (awed) Oh, Lord

Prince, riding his , weaves between jammed cars, then blasts down a narrow alley leading to the rear entrance
His guitar is slung across his back
He chains up his bike, moves past a of , cuts inside

#2 -- sweeps to a stop
The Businessman is at the wheel
Vanity steps from the car languidly and offers a curt wave goodbye
The car pulls away
She stands serenely a moment as the twists around the corner
She grabs her bag, rushes into a dark alley
She pulls a handful of  from her pocket, counts through it quickly

'  -- The  opens -- Morris steps confidently into the night
The change in his appearance is breathtaking cashmere coat is draped over his shoulders, a white scarf hangs loosely about his neck
Wearing a sharp, gangster-style suit, his hair is a pompadour, and Stacy Adams on his feet - - Morris is the very picture of elegance
He doesn't just walk to the curb, he slides -- his promenade punctuated with a dip at the knees you could snap your fingers to
is at the curb, buffing down the bumper of a yellow, 1970 Fleetwood Cadillac
Jerome is solidly built, smooth-faced handsome with a boyish charm all his own
He's a member of The Time, and acts as Morris' chauffeur, valet, and all-purpose shadow
He moves quickly to the door, holds it open as Morris settles himself into the backseat
He closes it with a flair, hops behind the wheel, pulls out
'Let's Get Crazy" continues as we

,  -- Prince is , practicing spins in front of the mirror
The other of his  are scattered throughout the room
sits off to the side, his drumsticks tapping against his knee
puts on his doctor's smock and  finish applying their makeup
runs his fingers up and down the neck of his bass guitar
Suddenly a  pokes his head into the room, holds the door open as Prince and his band cut quickly to the stage
'Let's Get Crazy' continues as we
: (12)
-- The  opens --   goes on
Vanity stands in the hallway,  peers cautiously into a squalid, rundown room
She hesitates briefly, seems to sigh, then indicates she will take it
The closes the door as he leaves
She stands a moment, surveys the room
bed and bureau, sink, a chair, hotplate -- simply the essentials
She pulls a dress from her bag, a pair of hi- heels, some gloves, underwear
She hangs the dress on a rod, places the shoes beneath it, arranges the rest in a bureau drawer
She looks around once more -- flowered wallpaper peels from the walls
She rushes to the window, tears open the shutters -- iron bars obstruct her view
(13)
--  (' ) are crowded in front of the up in front

The night is electric -- the scene beckons

: (15)
(1st
) -- Jerome opens the door of the , helps Morris out
The  recognizes them immediately, rushes in for a closer look
Morris loves the attention, plays to their enthusiasm with a relish
Jerome snaps a comb into his hand, holds up a pocket mirror
Morris combs his hair dramatically, the Crowd encouraging him on
Jerome gives him the  sign, ushers him into the club
"Let's Get Crazy" continues as we
: (16)
(1st
) -- Prince onstage performing "Let's Get Crazy
"   He's locked into a guitar solo, moving provocatively with Wendy
The  is packed onto the , thick against the stage
Jerome makes his way through the crowd, blazing a path for Morris who is surrounded by a dozen
Occasionally Morris glances at Prince -- discloses by his look that he doesn't care much for his act -- or his music
He breaks off from the Girls, follows Jerome to the backstage entrance where they're joined by other  of The Time --  and  among them
Morris casts another glance toward Prince, breaks into a self-satisfied grin-- We're going to slay him
(screams) Whawhak
"Let's Get Crazy" continues as we

-- The  has become unwieldly --  is snarled all around
are
try desperately to ward off the inevitable grid lock
Vanity runs against the light, moves to the head of the queue to the accompaniment of  and
She doesn't budge an inch, rapidly on the glass door, catching the attention of , a burly, 6'5", 285 pound bouncer with a white beard and long flowing hair
An ex-Marine, Chick's function is obvious
He cracks the door-- What
have an appointment with the manager
No you don't -- he doesn't see anybody
Suddenly a  breaks out at the Chick spins instantly,  the door -- but Vanity jams her boot into the narrow space
The door crashes against her instep, she winces in pain --but Chick doesn't notice
He's already upon the ,  heaving them against the wall
Vanity streaks inside, blazes up the stairway, ducks behind a  of turns instantly -- the door is closed -- , gone
His eyes dart up the stairway -- nothing
He shrugs, drags the Two Guys off
(18)
--    -- watches as he moves away
She jumps up, lunges onto the dance floor, into a waitress, , whose tray  to the floor-- What are you retarded or something
Why don't you look where you're going
She's 18 years old, blonde and pretty in a cute, innocent way
Daisy Mae-type whose emotions form so quickly, she has trouble sorting them out
Right now she's mad as hell -- she thinks-- Sorry
where's the office
Jill squats, picks up the broken glasses- Do you think you can just come in here and take over
said 'm sorry -- what do you want me to do
Where's the office
Jill points -- Vanity hurries away  -- (triumphantly) No one's in
Vanity stops dead in her tracks, does a slow burn
She walks back to Jill-- Okay, so you got  me back, fine
Listen, 'm from out of town
have to see the manager, it's important
'm a real good singer and dancer
know he could use me
Do you have any experience
Vanity simmers, enunciates every word-- Yeah
definitely
Follow me
And she turns on her heels, makes her way through the club, moving into the vicinity of the stage
Vanity follows her reluctantly, casts a look to the band
She spots Prince for the first time -- stops instantly
His effect on her is instantaneous
Passion surges through her like a tidal wave
His hair, face, eyes -- it all conspires to make her weak
It's like meeting someone for the first time, but seeing so much of yourself in them, that their lips, eyes, mouth -- you're certain you have touched, and the desire to be with them becomes so strong that the very act of touching will release you in a way you never thought possible
Prince brines "Let's Get Crazy" to a rousing, blistering end
Suddenly the stage is plunged into darkness
The goes
Vanity snaps out of it
Jill is tugging at her arm, a puzzled look on her face-- Here, fill this out -- 'll have him call you
don't have a phone
When will he be back
Well
you can try tomorrow
You can count on  it
Vanity hands the card back  to her -- Jill reads the name, address -- looks up puzzled-- Vanity
as Morris and The Time pass Prince on their way to the stage-- Why don't you stay awhile, see how it's done
The Band Members bust up -- but Prince ignores them, then-- Ladies and gentlemen -- please welcome The Time
Sudden  and
Vanity and Jill turn directly into the path of Prince, descending the Steps of the stage
Vanity gasps,  eyes with him
Jill seems to jump out of her skin -- it's obvious she has a crush on him something  awful-- Hi ya,  Prince -- God  liked that song, it's real fun
She fidgets uncontrollably, Vanity's card buring a hole into her hand
Prince glances at the card, then stares at Vanity,  the ripeness of her look paralyzing
He tears his eyes away, puts on his sunglesses, looks toward the stage
(18A)
--   -- and The Time rip into a funk tune called "Jungle Love
" Their stranglehold on the audience is instantaneous
Morris struts across the stage like a panther, playing to the audience with a relish
His eyes fastened on Prince -- his pride umistakable
watches Morris a moment, then eyes Vanity again
The heat between them is apparent
Vanity's heart is pounding, she's not sure what to do
She keeps her eyes on Morris, hoping that a Solution will present itself
watches as Jill tacks the card to a board behind the bar
Sizing up the situation quickly, he again glances at Vanity -- but her eyes are fastened on Morris
Feeling terribly shy and thinking there's nothing he can do to divert her attention away from him, he reluctantly heads for the front door
Vanity finally hits upon something to say, turns-- really liked your song too
But he's gone
Her eyes scan the room frantically -- catches a glimpse of him leaving
She takes a sudden step, then stops, paralyzed with indecision
Jill regards ger coldly
meanwhile is beside himself
Some gorgeous, dark-haired babe, eyes wide as saucers was starlng at him from the bar
Prince has left, and this girl is his
He motions to Jerome,  and they direct their act in her direction
gazes at Vanity, fidgets intensely, suspicious and resentful of her
She glances up and notices Morris, look
She seizes upon an idea,  forces a friendly smile, taps Vanity on the shoulder-- Hey
She points to the stage
Vanity looks at Morris, and he goes crazy, entertaining her with his own special blend of showmanship
The  loves it
Vanity is held a moment, but her thouchts are elsewhere
She finally comes to a decision, pulls away, cuts through the club
(18B)
-- as she runs down the stairs, cuts behind Chick,  out the door
(19)
-- The  are thick with She scans them wildly -- nothing
Suddenly Prince, astride his motorcycle,  past her from the opposite direction
She starts running, shouts-- Hey  wait
But Prince is too far away, the traffic too coneested for him to hear
He whips down the street, disappears around the corner
Vanity continues running, then slows, dejection overcoming her in waves
She looks around --  are staring at her, passing  jokes
Embarrassed, She moves to the front door but Chick is there, his eyes upon her cold, impassionate
Exhausted and slighlty tearlul, she cuts across the street, heads back to her apartment
(20)
'  -- Prince  down the street, cuts his motor, coasts up the drive
He comes to a stop against a wooden gate
His house is a nondescript, one-family structure with a wide front porch
He lives in a neat and tidy, homogeneous, lower middle- class neighborhood whose occupants are hard-working type fiercely protective of their privacy
He climbs the steps to the porch, opens the front door
his mothers  is like ice in his veins
Fear trickles into the hollows of his body like cold water,  His pain commands him to move, but the impulse short circuits somewhere at the waist, leaving his legs twitching uncontrollably
Then another from his mother, and his father's voice now,  and -- (
) Listen to me
You come home when  say come home
You've got no business in the streets
His mother  -- Prince into the room
(21)
Prince's   -- Prince's  is at the far side of the living room  uncontrollable
She's in her early 40's, a dark-haired, faded beauty, with large, wild, anxious eyes
There's a detectable scent of liquor in the air, and her slurred speech pins her as the source
His  is in his late 40's, a squat, but solidly built black man, with a cherubic face, and graceful expressive hands
He's upon her now,
at her horribly, trying to get to her face-- You do what  say, do you hear me
You've got to keep this place clean
You here, no place else
You're crazy
Asshole
Motherfucker
The Father lunges,
her across the face
She topples to the floor, a lamp  to the ground
Prince cuts through the room, lunges desperately in front of him-- (pleading) Please, Dad
she's heard you
She's had enough
His Mother drags herself up along the wall-- (hysterical) He's  trying to kill me
He's crazy
Look what he's doing to me
(tearfully) Dad,  please
she's-- Prince's head snaps back, his feet lift from the floor, his body in a heap by the door
Stunned
Prince, flat on his back, fights vertigo with everything he's got
His Mother lets out a , rushes into the bedroom,  the door
His Father stands motionless, sullen-- Get up
you ain't hurt
Prince opens his Mouth,  gushes from a gash in his tongue
He hoists himself up slowly, using the wall for support
He moves into the kitchen, disappears down the basement steps
(22)  --    -- naked   snaps
It dangles like a pendulum, casting strange shadows
The basement is partitioned off into a series of rooms, interconnected by a labyrinthine coimbination of passages
An old washer and dryer stand in the corner
Prince descends the steps slowly
He comes through a door, closes it behind him
He moves down a narrow passageway, enters a small cramped
He closes the door and locks it behind him
filters in throuch the cacement windows
The total effect is like entering a womb, a deep dark chamber of security and safety
Lying heavily onto his bed, he sighs long and deep, his eyes piercing the darkness
: : (23) wafts through the sun-drenched Jill is seated at the , 'a la Marlene Dietrich,  to her heart's content
cigarette dangles from her lip, a police cap is perched jauntily on her head
It's a simple bar tune, delivered slightly off-key, but with an openness that is endearing
Chick is working in the corner, chuckling to himself, stacking chairs, sweeping up
Suddenly she stops -- listens intently
She jumps up, deliberately spills her orange juice on the piano
Prince comes around the corner, stops short-- (surprised) What are you doing here
She's a bundle of loose, embarrassing ends -- the cigarette, hat,  juice-- What
what are you doing here
He feels caught out --  the earnestly for Vanity's info   -- tries to think of something to say-- Huh
it's kind of dead in here
Where is  everybody
In bed  guess
(to herself) Oh, God
(changes subject) Guess what,  bought a dog
That's nice
(he spots vanity's card) Ah,  guess 'll come back at a better time
You think tonight the the place'll be jumping
Well, 'll be here --  always like what you do
He smiles, moves to the door -- Jill connects with a thought-- Wait
've got something for you
What
subpoena
(embarrassed) No
She rumages through her bag, pulls out a cassette-- It's a song Lisa and Wendy wrote
He stiffens, doesn't reach for it-- (suspicious) Why didn't they give it to me themselves
Well,  liked it and wanted to listen to it
They told me to give it to you when  was done
He puts his sunglasses on, hesitates, then takes it from her gingerly
He regards it for a long time-- You really liked it, huh
(24)
-- throbs throuch the crammed, rundown
Hardwood floors, a wall of mirrors, and a bank of windows provides the setting streams through tattered yellow shades
The Time is set up on one side providing the music for "Sex Shooter" a saucy number with an irresistible beat
Morris, with Jerome by his side, stands in the middle of the floor, instructions to
and , gamely trying some intricate dance steps
Brenda is 21 years old, blond, sexy, with an alluring new-wave look
Susan is 16 years old, with dark, lustrous hair and a sexy baby- doll quality
Right now they're tired as hell, and a little angry-- One, two, three, kick
One, two, three, kick
Four, five
Oh, Lord
Cut
Cut
The  stops, the girls come to a halt -- Morris regards them evenly-- You ladies don't seem to realize how valuable my time is
You're going to make my boys look bad
Why don't you let us come up with our own steps
Morris glares at her-- We tried that
(sweetly) remember
The Girls  fidget-- Now you're in the best possible position you can be in, so what' s the matter -- your shoes on too tight or something
(claps his hands) Let's have some action, let's have some asses wiggling, want some perfection
Whawhak
The  starts up -- the Girls start dancing
Morris looks woefully to Jerome--- think 'm going to need a drink, a strong drink
(a beat) Let's get the hell out of here
(25)
--  -- Morris and Jerome move briskIy down the sidewalk-- This just ain't happening
The bitches are okay, but we need something more exciting- You're right
We could be doing much better
Any ideas
That powder fine babe we saw last night
Oooh, yeee
-- Why don't we find out who she is
Morris snaps an address in front of his face-- already know that
Jill gave me everything last night
Whawhak
Then what are we waiting for
Let's go
No, no -- that ain't classy enough
want the bitch to come to me -- 'm the only star in this town
Suddenly  a   lunges into the sidewalk from the alley-- (yelling) Morris Day, who do you think you are
waited up all night for you
'm so tired of you doing that  to me
You think you're so hot
You're nothing special
This is the third time you pulled that shit
Who the fuck do you think  am
Jerome
Jerome puts the girl in a headlock, her into the alley-- (screaming) Leave me alone you ape
-- What are you doing to me
Morris
He flings her into the dumpster, the lid with a
Morris pats his brow-- Lo-rd
Such nastiness
(a beat) Hee, hee -- Let's break
They streak across the street, double- time it to the
sweeps by, gives them a curious look
Morris puts on a dignified air, then stops, stupified-- Jerome, this car -- it's
it's lacking something
What do you think
Hmm
don't know

The hubcaps
We need something sweeter
think  know what it needs
Morris is pondering his Stacy Adams-- Yeah
know what these need
(26)
--  -- Morris sits in the chair, his Stacy Adams worked on by an old, grizzled in his mid-sixties, with large jowls and silver close-cropped hair
Jerome stands nearby, watches intently-- (musing) The girl has expensive tastes
wonder if she can sing
As fine as she is
she doesn't have to know how to sing
(grace) know that's right
(to Shoeshine) Hey -- watch it now
The Shoeshine Boy looks up balefully -- Morris smiles, then grits his teeth-- want you to stay out of the set tonight

What for

You stay by the door, you see her, you come get me, cool
Cool

The Shoeshine Boy looks  up slowly -- regards them with a soulfull look-- Either of you do heavy drugs
(27)
--  -- The  are alive with bustling Vanity walks aimlessly past store windows, staring longingly at the expensive items
as she stops suddenly and stares transfixed
, startingly similiar to her in looks and coloring, tries on a beautiful bridal gown as a adjusts the hem
The entire scene is warm and endearing
Vanity is struck by lt's beauty and seems to sigh
The Young Woman looks up suddenly, catches Vanity's gaze, and gives her an affectionate smile
Vanity smiles back avidly, then-- (0
) Give me that
She looks up startled-- There
on your boot
She looks  down -- it's the expensive gold chain
She hesitates, then hands it to him
He drops it into his pocket, walks away-- Hey, wait
She runs after him-- Give it back to mel He continues to walk briskly -- she starts pulling on his coat-- You can have it back later
want it back now, okay
Who gave it to you
person Female or male
Huh
You're lying
can tell just by your reaction that you're lying
He moves away briskly -- Vanity stands her ground, amused-- So you gave it to me -- it's not yours anymore
He stops short -- something has caught his eye
She's curious, comes up behind him, then-- You see something you like
He puts on his sunglasses stands prominently in the window
Let's go for a ride
He flips her the gold chain' -- turns hastily
She weighs it in her hand, studies the guitar-- It's pretty
(28)
-- Prince and Vanity on his blazing down the , twisting through
The  is behind them, receding into the distance
(29) Ext
-- They pull off an access road, drop down a small embankment, ride down a narrow, dirt road
The pull to a stop
stretches before them
Vanity gets off the bike, walks around exploring, casting curious glances at Prince
He stands by the water, idly tossing stones-- My psychic told rne  was going to be famous
How much did that cost you
Fifty bucks
It was a good investment
He doesn't respond -- she suddenly feels shy-- No seriously -- My psychic did tell me
was in a play once
Oh, yeah -- what did you play
Isadora Duncan
She stretches her arms like a butterfly, does a little step-- That means  can sing and dance
(a beat) Want to help me
(swiftly) Nope
(surprised) Pardon me
Nope
She's Perplexed-- Want to know why
(defensively) Nope
(a beat) Because you wouldn't pass the initiation
What initiation
Well, for starters ycu have to purify yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka
What
You have to purify yourself in Lake Minnetonka
Her brow furrows, she looks out across the lake
He's calmly throwing stones
Recognizing a challenge when she sees one, she formulates a plan, faces him seductively, shoots him an open look
He stops suddenly, locks eyes with her, feels his knees go weak
Her hold on him is unmistakable
She pulls off her blouse in one fluid motion, tugs off her boots, drops her pants to the ground
She's exquisite, takes a step toward him
Passion rings in his veins
Suddenly she turns on her   heels, moves purposefully toward the water
He's shocked,  realizes that she's about to go in-- Hey, wait a minute
Thats-- But she silences him savagely-- We made a deal
And before he can react she scampers along a log,  beneath the surface
He can't believe it -- her spirit really impresses him
She breaks the surface coughing and sputtering, hops and jumps to the shore-- Hold it
What
That ain't Lake Minnetonka
He tries to keep a straight face, jumps on his motorcvcle,  it up
His words take a moment to sink in, then-- (enraged) You bastard
don't believe it
How could you do that to me
She gathers up her clothes, tries desperately to put them on
She slips and falls -- Prince can't help laughing- Damn you -- 'll kill you
She starts throwing stones
He laughs, blasts up the path-- (screaming) You prick
Are you sick
Is this some kind of ritual   -- getting your kicks
How many girls have you done this to
He blazes up the embankment, through the air, drops expertly onto the road
He fishtails to a slick stop
Vanity is by the lake, flailing about, throwing things, trying to get into her boots-- Bastard
He laughs heartily, wants to kid her, rides down the road as if he's leaving
Having his fun, he slows, turns to go back
his smile dissolves instantly
Vanity is in the middleof the road, flagging down a small
She hops in, slams the door
The truck peels out, bears down upon him
He gesticulates his arms wildly --  wants to explain-- Hey
But the truck streaks past -- Vanity's look is cold, triumphant
(30)
(1ST
) -- The  is is onstage, a hi-techno funk group, performing their trademark, a frenzied song entitled "Modern Aire" The floor is dense with , all performing the same syncopated dance
moves through the club slowly, seems to be searching someone out
His face is drawn and haggard, his spirits strained
He cuts past the , barely acknowledges Jill, or the other by her side,  and
Jill looks concerned-- Honey, you still chasing after that fool
Kim is 21 years and gorgeous, with dark eyes, a smooth sculpted face, and taut shapely legs
She is street-educated and doesn't need encouraging to speak her mind
Katy is also in her-early 20's, a tall, alluring Oriental, with an attractive, intelligent face-- 'm doing what 'm doing
It's my business
He doesn't even look at you
That's the last thing you want from a man
You just don't know him like do
Honey
Look, Listen, and then Feel
If you do them in any other order, you're headed for trouble
Matt and Bobby (members of Prince's group) stroll up-- Hey, Jill -- where's our drinks
They're coming -- just wait
Matt stares hungrily at her breasts-- What you want isn't on the menu
Jill, in ten years they'll be on the table
She swats him with her order pad -- Bobby ducks, taunts her-- 'mon, c'mon
She goes to swing, Matt moves in, squeezes her breasts-- (horn sound) BooPoo
Get out of here, you jerks
Sweetheart
do you have a real hot place where  could stick my nose
Sure -- try a microwave
The Guys bust up, head for their tables- Those guys are deep
Yeah -- deeply retarded
(31)
/
--   -- Vanity stands in line waiting to get in
She wears a short, black dress and red heels, carries a black and red clutchbag
Her hair is swept back and wind-blown, her eyes dark and dancing
She looks wickedly wonderful and knows it
stands by the window, arms folded, as massive as a Sequoia
He regards her suspiciously-- (sweetly) 'm paying
see
(to cashier, gruff) Keep the change
Chick advances on her -- her eyes widen with fear-- The manager wants to see you
Really
Oh, great
like to see him too
She breaths a sigh of relief
watches as Chick escorts Vanity to the upper level
He stays short distance behind
(32)
-- as Vanity and Chick come to a  halt in the middle of the f Ioor-- He'll be right with you
Chick walks away
Jerome makes a move toward her, but pulls himself up short - -   has approached her-- Hi, 'm Billy Sparks,  manage this place
Vanity turns around -- her eyes widen with surprise-- He's 38 years old, 5'3" tall and weighs about 180 pounds
He's dressed in a baby-blue running suit
and white tennis shoes that come to a point
dark- skinned, smooth-faced black man, he's wearing small, white sunglasses and a base-ball cap perched on his head
Fred Flintstone in Harlem
hip, fast- talking jive motherfucker who uses profanity like a light saber
Chubby, cuddly, cherubic Billy Sparks
He'd sell his mother if he thought he could make a buck
They size one another up in
about three seconds-- Hi --  really like your club
Really
What time is it
Nine, sweets
Oh, that's a really nice watch
Very pretty
Billy lights a cigarette, offers her one, she accepts-- You  look like a guy  used to go out with -- he was a lot older, but  like older men
Really, what a coincidence
just came off a Broadway play
My grandmother got sick
Does she live here
No, in New York
(catches herself) But, huh,   have a sister here, lives in Saint
huh Paul
Amazing
Ye-es
(smiles) What do you want to do
You don't want to be a waitress do you
No
no
Actually  was thinking more in the way of the stage
Of course
how about dinner
Theatre
Dinner, then the theatre, my sweets
Oh, huh
Jerome appears-- Hi ya, Billy
Good evening, Jerome
Vanity sees her escape-- Jerome --  was looking all over for you
They  look at her surprised-- You know each other
Of course
Jerome goes along with it-- Yes, we've met
have something to show you
Great
See you later, Billy
She walks away with Jerome, arm in arm-- You rescued me
(smiles) Ye-es
(33)
-- Prince and his band (Mark, Bobby, Matt, Lisa) sit backstage, waiting to go on
An air of tension permeates the room
Lisa sits in the corner and fidgets, casts sidelong looks to Prince
He sits apart from the group, deathly silent, locked in thouqht
Wendy walks in and shares a look with Lisa
She goes up to Prince, her voice filled with nervousness-- Hi  ya, Prince
heard through the grapevine you had a new tune written by two great girls
By chance did you hear it
He stares at her -- if looks could kill Wendy would be dead-- knew it -- he didn't listen to it
He probably dropped it under his bike and rolled over it
Prince grunts, turns away -- Wendy is amazed-- Wow
Okay
you think about this
'm going to be real honest with you
You're really being full of shit
Forget about it, Wendy
Let's get out of here-- But Wendy, agitated, silences her with a fierce gesture-- (to Prince) Every time we give you a song, you say you're going to use it, but you never do
You always think that we're doing something behind your back
You're just being paranoid as usual
Wendy
(upset) Shut up, Lisa, please
(to Prince) You should know by now that we wouldn't hurt vou
We're not out to put a dark cloud over your head
It's just to make you feel good, Prince -- that's what it's all about
You've been this way with us before, remember
(maliciously) The nominees for the best actress are-- -- Fuck it, Wendy -- let's break
Wendy is shaking, tears spring to her eyes-- Do you know you can really, really hurt people
Doesn't that mean anything to you
Doesn't that make you feel like shit
'mon
'm tired of this
'm really tired
They leave the room, Wendy  the door behind her
Prince casts a look to Bobby, Mark, Matt-- You tired, too
God got Wendy's periods reversed
About every 28 days, she starts acting nice
Lasts about a weekend
Thud
The joke hangs suspended like a ball and chain
Bobby gets up, the others follow him to the door-- What difference does it make, Prince
We're still a group, right
They cut out the door
(34)
-- Bobby, Matt and Mark move briskly to the stage-- Headcase
Telling you
'effed up headcase
People with talent usually are
Matt dons his surgeon's mask -- Mark rolls his eyes-- Of course, there are a number of headcases without great talent too
(35) / / -- Morris stands by the door surrounded by several delicious
One of them, wearing a tight, red dress, looks especially enticing
Morris leans in closer -- her tasty breasts strain against the spandex material-- Honey -- don't you ever try and breastfeed no baby now
Why not
Never mind
Jerome appears-- What
What
Right
What
What
You got it
Be snaps his head to the side -- Morris looks, sees Vanity sitting at a table
His eyes dance mischievously-- Ye-es (to Girl) What time is it
(coyly) Tea time
So, right
(36)
-- as Prince sits by himself in front of the mirror, staring at a cassette on the counter
We recognize it immediately as the tape Jill gave him earlier, containing Lisa's and Wendy's music
He picks it up, snaps it into a ghetto blaster
, without lyrics, fills the room
He adjusts the dials, sits back and listens a moment
Suddenly the door opens-- Prince, five minutes
Be snaps off the music, drops the cassette into his pocket, cuts out the room
(37)
-- He comes to the stage-area
His Band
Members are standing about anxiously, watching the final moments of The Modern Aires' performance
He cuts behind the curtain, peers at the crowd
his eyes fall on Vanity -- his face brightens instantly
Just then Jerome and Morris approach her
Prince shakes his head knowingly, offers a wry smile, then joins his band
(38)
VAN1TY'    -- She sits demurely
Morris' eyes are wide and shining -- her beauty up close astonishes him-- Vanity, 'd like you to meet Morris
Day
Hold it now -- just leave the '' alone
(clears throat) Vanity
this is Morris Day The pleasure's all mine
she offers her hand -- he takes it decorously-- If you'd excuse me
Morris signals him -- whispers into his ear-- Too sexy
(a beat) Have  a waitress bring
a bottle of their best champacne
He seats himself, fastens her with a sexy, half-lidded look-- Your lips would make a lollipop too happy
You think so, huh
Ye-es
Kim appears with a bottle of champacne in ice-- Who's paying for this Morris
think you know that
(a beat) Jerome
Jerome appears, opens the bottle with a flair, performs a classy taste test
Morris pulls out some cash, pays him, who snatches the money, leaves-- Huh, keep the change-- He whispers to Jerome-- Get my change, will ya
Jerome leaves, Morris purses his lips-- Oh, Lord
either somebody put something in my drink, or you are the finest (motherfucker) 've seen in ages
Excuse me, what did you say
Huh
you look nice tonight
He leans in, speaks with a sexy voice-- It's rare that  out my cards on the table when it comes to meeting younq ladies, but
'm going to make you love me
Is that a  fact
He folds his legs dramatically, his Stacy Adams reflecting the light-- Just as sure as my Stacy Adams are shiny
Just then-- (
) Ladies and Gentlemen -- please welcome Prince
The  erupts in
Prince hits the stage, launches into "-spot," a fast, high-spirited funk tune that gets the crowd hopping
Vanity watches as Prince whips the crowd into a frenzy
Morris listens with a complacent grin on his face, his eyes searching out various members of The Time who are scattered through-out the club
When he connects with one of them he makes a series of absurd faces which sends them into hysterics
For Prince is playing music that The Time is noted for, and, as far as Morris is concerned, performs better
Not everyone in the club is dancing, or paying attention, and this does not escape his notice
Suddenly "-Spot" comes to a rousing end
The  cheers wildly
Prince moves quickly to the piano and launches into "Electric Intercourse," a love ballad which, as it progresses, becomes a personal statement for Vanity and Prince himself
She listens intently, her eyes fastened on him
The words have a profound effect on her -- and the audience
Without being consciously aware of it, they're moving closer to the stage, searching for their personal fix
Prince surrenders himself to the music totally, releasing from himself all that is hurtful -- releasing the sincerity and truthfulness that escapes him in his daily life
We are entering  realm where life and music are inextricably bound, and the impact on the performer and listener is profound
He's directing his music toward her, and she receives it gratefully, almost anxiously
It fills a void in her, hewn by a life of meaningless promises
He searches her face with his magnificent eyes, and ends the song with a heartrending cry which connects with the souls of all present
Everyone is paying attention now
The stage is plunged into darkness
The goes
Vanity applauds vigorously, wipes the tears from her eyes
Morris, who was more affected by the performance than he'd care to admit, doesn't like what he sees and searches for a winning line-- He doesn't like girls
She's equal to the challenge-- know -- he likes women
But Morris can barely suppress a smile, and settles himself comfortably into his chair -- for he knows what Vanity has lost
at least this round-- Well
he don't do too good with them either
She flashes him a quizzical look -- he simply smiles
(39)
-- Jubilation time
Prince and his Band move through the hallway briskly, past the outstretched arms of admiring fans
There's a lot of back-slapping going on as the Musicians bask in the glow of well-wishers
Prince moves past Billy Sparks, who has an angry look on his face-- What's this intercourse, shit
Hey; man -- don't worry about it
'm warning you
But Prince ignores him, cuts into the dressing room-- (40)
-- --then stops suddenly, surprised
He's muzzle to muzzle with a cuddly , held up lovingly by Jill-- Surprise
and
by  the entire group
Jill hesitates, then kisses Prince's cheek compulsively
He's surprised, touched-- Hey -- wait till we're married, now
She fidgets, her face blushes red
Wendy is studying the dog-- Oh, my God -- look at this
Everyone looks -- Jill grins like the Cheshire Cat-- Notice anything
What
It looks like you
She thrusts the dog into his arms -- the Band laughs uproariously
Jill is beaming-- His hair
Prince gazes into the mirror -- and sure enough the dog's hair has been groomed to match his
He can't help smiling-- Shit
(softly) wanted to cheer you up
Thanks
'm hungry -- where's the food
He grabs the dog, 'a la The Werewolf, starts chomping on it's neck
The Group busts up, starts fooling around
Prince glances into the mirror -- Vanity is there
He whirls around to the door -- nothing
huge smile sweeps his face instead
The Band continues fooling around, and Prince joins in with a relish
(41)
#2,   -- Vanity leans against a brick wall, hiding in the shadows
Suddenly approach
Prince appears, gets on his Motorcycle-- Hey
He doesn't look up-- We have to go to your place
What for
want to show you something
She's embarrassed by her apartment-- No
no, we can't
Why -- is there someone there
Why do you always think there's somebody else
He averts his eyes -- kick  his bike-- Let's go
(Getting on) Yeah -- but we're not going to my place
He remains silent, snaps the bike into gear, blasts down the ally into the street
(42) '    -- Prince and Vanity whip down a residential street
As he approaches his house he slows, moves past it quietly
He makes a deft -turn, crosses his house again -- seems to be listening intently
After a moment, he cuts down a narrow path, turns up a back alley
He rides to a wooden gate, detaches a hidden lever
The wood slats rotate like a garage door -- Prince coaxes his bike through
Vanity's mesmerized
They ride down a narrow sidewalk, cut through a garden, and emerge from the back of a garage
He leans his bike against it-- That was a grand entrance
Where am
He silences her with a look, moves quickly across the grass, comes to a window
He stands on a pipe, looks in-- (43) '  --
-- His Mother and Father in the living room
His Mother is sprawled out on the sofa, obviously drunk, her dress hiked along her thighs
Her head rests in his Father's lap
(44)
-- Prince hops from the pipe, leans coolly against the house
Intrigued
Vanity looks in-- (45) '  --
-- The mother and father kissing tentatively, then violently, finally pulling away
The Mother seems to be taunting the Father, coaxing him into a trap
He kisses her mouth lustily -- she pulls back snarling--
(46)
-- Vanity's scared -- tries to be cool-- So -- friends of yours
Yeah -- the freak show
He walks off
She jumps off the pipe, follows
as they emerge around the corner
Prince squats by a basement window, adjusts an old coal chute, then slides down it-- Hey
(
) 'mon
She hesitates a moment, then slides down too
(47)
, '  -- He turns on a , disappears into an Vanity looks around amazed
She stands in a small - whose walls are covered with thicks pads and foam
Colorful  hang suspended from the ceilings -- various  lie about: a drumset, an electric guitar, and a small upright piano
stereo and cassette player
are perched on a shelf, and  two speakers are recessed into the walls
The entire room looks hand- built, the wood carefully painted, or stained
She peers through the doorway into the adjoining room
filters in through the casement windows
Various  are painted on the walls, are suspended from the ceiling
bed sits in the middle of the floor, a vanity table and mirror nearby
She stands idly a mement, then moves around the antechamber
Various catch her attention
Small wind-up  lie about:  a soldier, a bear banging on a drum, a tractor and car
small   sits on a shelf
She turns the handle, a little fills the room
cassette sits in the player
She snaps it shut, hits the play button fills the room, followed by a ' , seemingly speaking in a foreign tongue
The combination is hypnotic and sensual -- she finds herself drawn in
Suddenly Prince grabs her by the waist, lets out a
She draws a out breath, jumps-- If you think you scared me, you didn't
Oh, yeah
He puts his index finger directly in front of her nose, moves it back and forth hypnotically
She follows it earnestly with her eyes
Suddenly, he pulls his hand away, stretches it to the ceiling like an escaping bird
They both smile, lock eyes
Passion rings in their veins
The Woman's  begins to moan deeply, pleasurably-- Who's the lucky girl
Sounds like she was having a good time
She's crying -- it's backwards
It makes me sad when  hear it
It sorta sounds like she's laughing, doesn't it
So what did you do to her
Do you always treat your women like that
don't have anybody right now
Heat floods into her womb like soft fire- You look pretty
She touches his chest delicately, fluffs up his hair-- King Kong
Stop
She hesitates -- but he reaches out tentatively, touches her breast-- No
But their mutual desire is too strong
Their lips seek one another out timidly, almost deferentially
then fervently
: (48)
--  -- Vanity sits at the foot of the bed, Prince stands before her
Her dress is hiked along her thighs, her stockings attached to garters
Their hands search delicately across the contours of their bodies, drawing quick breaths from their lips
They kiss one another ardently, then quickly, like sparrows pecking seed
She goes to remove her dress, but Prince stays her with a gesture, moving his hands along her thighs, touching delicately that spot between her legs
low, whispery moan escapes from her lips
Vanity lies back, drawing Prince toward her
His lips move across her mouth, her neck, her breasts
She moans softly, pulls her dress above her thighs, goes to remove it
Once again he stops her, slowly turns her onto her stomach
She stands
on her knees, her head resting on a pillow
His hands move up along the back of her thighs, past the garters to her panties
He tugs at them gently, then rubs his hand firmly between her legs
She moans suddenly, the shudder moving through her like a whirlwind
: (49)
--  -- glows throuch the casement windows
stir gently in the night breeze
Prince and Vanity are asleep
He rests on his side, his hands gently surporting his face
She lies behind him, one leg dangling off the bed, one shoe discarded on the floor Suddenly a distant --
Vanity awake
Fear sweeps her like a shadow from a passing cloud
She listens intently, then-- -- Another  ,  , and Prince's Mother in the dark-- (o
s
) (upstairs) Please
bottle  to the floor
Then silence
deep silence like snow in the room
Vanity's racked with fear
She sits up slowly, her eyes searching out Prince -- he's sleeping
Suddenly more , a   and the Father's -- (o
s
) No
Something heavy  to the floor
Vanity rises from the bed in a panic
She smoothes down her dress, searches for her other shoe
She shoots another look to Prince, but he sleeps peacefully
Casting a glance upstairs, she climbs throuch the casement window, disappears into the night
is resting on his side, his eyes opened
(50)
'    -- Vanity moves quickly along the side of the house, trying desperately to find her wav
Suddenly a  reaches out of the darkness,  her by the throat
She , swings her bag desperately -- something , into the bushes-- Damn, baby, hold it
Hold it
(wails) Oh, God -- God
You broke my nose
She sees it's Morris -- she's beside herself  with fear and rage-- You shit
What the hell are you doing here
He struggles in the bushes --  start -- Shh
Shh
Shh
oh, Lord help me outta here
(a beat) Hee, hee --  know you wouldn't want to spend the whole night with ol' pencil dick
Your nose alright
My nose is fine, 'm just wondering if  fucked my shoes up
(a beat) 'mon
They cut across the yard, head to the street
The  is parked at the curb
Jerome leans against it, reading a newspaper-- Hi, Jerome
Wow
Nice hubcaps
He grins proudly from ear to ear -- the Caddy sports new chrome wire wheels-- You like them, huh
Beautiful
Morris  dismally-- Jerome
you think these can be fixed
His shoes are badly scuffed, the leather torn across the top-- think they're dead, man
God, 'm sorry
Shit -- it's so rough out here
Just then a   cruises by
The regards them suspiciously
Morris and Jerome snap to attention-- You lock the door, baby
Let's go
They pile into the Caddy, pull out
(51)
-- The  blazes by in the night
The glimmer spectacularly in the distance
(52)
/
-- Jerome drives
Morris and Vanity sit in the backseat
He gazes at her ardently-- Jerome
Jerome snaps a look in the rear-view -- Morris gives him a deft nod
Jerome opens the glove compartment, searches through the cassette tapes
He finds the one he wants, snaps it into the player
fills the car
Note:  The restaurant ambiance will grow in volume, and will be followed by exaggerated dinner music, punctuated with strings and delicate cymbals
The plays throughout this scene -- and Morris times his words to the ebb and flow of the piece to insure the proper dramatic effect
dinner  begins-- Cocktails before dinner
Yes -- two pina coladas
Uh
make mine a virgin
Okay
Jerome braces his knees against the wheel, pours two premixed coladas into plastic glasses-- (to Morris) Will you be having a virgin as well
Ye-es
For dessert
Whawhak
Jerome stifles a laugh, pours a rum miniature into Morris' glass
He hands them back-- Thank you
Here you are, dear
They savor their drinks -- Morris' fervor grows by leaps and bounds-- Jerome, uh, get your pad and pencil,  think it's gonna be kinda right
If my judge of character is correct, it's going to be about loving tonight
(a beat) Stop me when  get to seventeen
Jerome places a pad by his side, pencil at the ready
He settles the Caddy to a cruising 55 -- Morris looks deeply into Vanity's eyes-- Excuse me, baby
bet you didn't know  had a piece of this restaurant, did you
(a beat) May  taste that
He takes Vanity's drink, slurps a little, burps-- Huh, excuse me, that's kind of weak
here, try mine
She does, and begins coughing violently- Good God
'know
they say that saliva is an aphrodisiac
(a beat) You look so lovely tonight
(couching) Why
thank you
Probably you'd look better under exotic
red
liqhts
(another though) wish you could see my home
It's
it's so exciting
He leans close to her, speaks in a soft, sexy voice-- In my bedroom,  have a brass waterbed
Oooh
have an Italian cook, Gino Izogochograchi, or something like that
She giggles, looks at him deeply-- It's funny
your eyes -- when you stare at me like that, it causes my stomach to qui- quiver
Oh, Lord
An idea flashes across his mind-- Do you like diamonds
Uh, huh
Yeah
Yeah
know it's rather masculine, but -- try this one on
He slides a large glass diamond on her finger-- Ohhh
My God, darling it fits
He studies her hands closely-- You must have strong hands, but -- they're so soft
like oils in my bubble bath
(a beat) Damn
He leans close to her-- Darling
Yeah
'm not usually so forward, but -- would you like to make love to me
can make it so nice
She giggles freely, looks at him with big eyes-- Do you know what is meant by the words, huh,  hate to use them, they're so harsh, so American
mean, and yet on the other hand, they're exciting words
The words
(pause) chili sauce
Oh, Lord
(a beat) You know,  haven't made love in so long, but with you know it would be just like riding a bike
'd remember everything 've ever learned
(a beat) Baby, if the kid can't make you come, nobody can
Jerome checks off his pad-- (whispers) Morris
Yeah
Seventeen
Morris fixes Vanity with his half- lidded, pouty-lip look-- Huh, what's it gonna to be baby
She's on the spot, thinks fast-- What
What
Over there -- that's where live
Jerome  the car to a stop
They're directly in front of a slick, hi-rise apartment building-- Here
Yes
Uh, what one is it
That one, right there, see
On the 14th floor
It's nice, huh
Oh, it's great
Real pretty
Big open rooms, balconies, fireplace -- the works
He smiles lovingly-- Jerome
Jerome puts the Caddy into gear, pulls off into the night- Hey, wait
'mon
(a beat) Okay -- where are you taking me
Home
(smiling) You and me are a lot alike
- like that
So, 'd like to help you out
think  have something you may be interested,  in
Oh yeah -- what
Jerome hands Morris a cassette -- Morris waves it in front of her nose-- little song and dance
That is, if you can sing and dance
(defensively) Prince is goinq to help me
Jerome and Moris suppress their laughter- Motherfucker needs a haircut
Hee, hee, uh, excuse me
No he won't
He's never done anything in his whole life for anybody but himself
Guys better than you have promised me things before
know that's right, but-- Jerome hands him a card with an address on it
Morris hands the card to her-- (con't) -- not Morris Day
(he smiles) Jerome pulls up in front of her motel
Vanity reads the card-- Come by any time
(53)
/
-- She gets out of the car, stands on the sidewalk
Morris pushes the window button -- nothing happens-- Jerome
Jerome leans over, taps the glass -- the window glides down-- (to Vanity) One more thing
Jerome snaps the glove compartment, hands Morris a neatly folded camisole
Morris presents it to her-- Here's a little something for you
If you get cold when you wear it, call me
He snaps his fingers -- Jerome pulls the Caddy away with a screech
(54)
'  -- Vanity stands on the sidewalk a moment, slightly bewildered and very amused
She watches the Cadillac screech around the bend
She turns, goes into the motel
stands in the alleyway across the street, his motorcycle parked nearby
He watches as Vanity cuts inside
(55)
/'  -- She comes down the , opens her door with a key
(55A)
'  -- She goes inside, drops the tape and card in her bureau
unfolding the camisole, she holds it against her, gazes into the mirror
It looks beautiful
Suddenly a at the door-- Morris
Another two , something like a confirmation
She smiles, cuts to the door, flings it open -- but Prince is there
She's shocked, but recovers instantly-- had a feeling it was you -- knew it
It's amazing -- could tell it was you
His face remains placid as he puts on his sunglasses-- How'd you get home
Took a cab
Oh yeah
Where'd you get that
She stares at the camisole in her hands- adore camisoles
He nods dispassionately, walks into the room, gives the place the once over, then-- Let's ride
(56)
-- Prince and Vanity on his motorcycle whipping down the highway
The breaks over the horizon
(57)
-- Streaking down a two-lane blacktop obviously exhilarated by the velocity of their ride
The landscape becomes lush, the trees a riot of autumn splendor
(58)
-- as Prince and Vanity whip up to the top of a small hill, skid to a stop
He scans the area quickly, gets his bearings
He pops the clutch, skids off to the valley below
(59)
-- ride cautiously through a series of hiking paths, then twist down a small embankment flows before them
They climb off the bike, look around quietly-- God, this is beautiful
It reminds me of where  grew up
My father used to
He waits for an answer, it's not forthcoming-- Your father used to what
Nothing
it's just
(changes subject) You must like places like this
He goes to the stream, balances on several rocks, moves to the other side
The stream flows between them-- So, have you reconsidered my proposal
What
What we talked about last time
You can't be serious
She starts a little dance step, climaxes it with spins and twirls-- Oh, come on -- you know you really want to
You've been waiting for this opportunity all
your
life
He can't help laughing -- she freezes, looks at him coldly-- 'm sorry -- excuse me
God -- so why do you come around
You don't want to help me, not that you have to
You don't want to sleep with me, not that you have to do that either
So why am here
He smiles, walks off-- There's a lot of things you don't know about me
You'd be surprised how many things could do
He disappears around some trees-- Take me home immediately want to go home
can't stand this
can't take this anymore
Prince
moves through the trees smiling, studying nature-- (
) don't need this
was doing alright before  met you
Motherfucker, you need a haircut
He comes to a tree, leans against it contentedly, studies the foliage
paces back and forth frantically along the stream-- (to herself) don't get this
(yells) Prince
Who do you think you are
You don't care
You don't care about anything never wanted you to help me anyway
rests by the tree, observes walking down the path toward him- (0
) You think you're a good musician
You're nothing
Morris is better
never wanted to make it with you anyway
The Hikers pass him startled-- Good morning
,
Good morning, sir
And they walk down the path, disappear around the bend
Just then-- is standing by his side, a wildflower in her hands-- (softly) 'm sorry
shouldn't have said those things
Will you forgive me
(softly) Yes
He takes the flower, slips it into his jacket, kisses her forehead
(60)
-- as they ride down a leaf-strewn path and pull to a stop near an old, weathered, dilapidated
It stands laarge and silent like a painting
low rolls across the land
(61)
-- burns through the wooden slats
rises from the wet hay scattered throughout
The air is thick and damp
It begins to
Vanity stands in the middle of the barn, gazing at the storm
Beads of perspiration glisten on her forehead
She turns slowly, watches as Prince retrieves old blankets from a nearby stall
Their eyes search one another out, their breathing becomes short, expectant
She hesitates a moment, then pulls off her blouse, discards it to the moist, dusty floor
(62)
-- patters srtongly against the barn
deep  rolls
She's on top of him, moving deliciously, her body glowing in the purple, dawn light
Moist, purple water shadows streak and course her skin as she moves slowly, then deliberately against him
He watches her avidly,  his hands firmly on her thighs, and thrusts into her again and again
and again
(62A)
-- Leaves scatter as the bike whips thru the wet path
(63)
, '  -- The  glisten with the rain
Prince and Vanity pull up in front of her motel
She hugs him fiercely, steps off the bike, her face alive and fresh as a flower
His eyes sparkle-- See you later
When
Why
'Cause  have to do something first
What
(coyly) secret
Tell me
No
Okay, come by -- eight o'clock
He kicks the bike into gear -- she touches his jacket longingly-- Bye
He blasts off
She watches him a moment, her eyes glowing
She heads to her motel, then stops short -- a single lies oon the sidewalk
She looks around quickly, almost expecting someone to claim it
But no one's around, so she picks it up, goes inside
(64)
, '  -- She enters the , closes the door behind her
She turns -- another is on the stairwell
She's intrigued, glances up the stairs -- there's another one, and yet another further up
She's confused, but grabs them, disappears up the stairs
as she comes to a halt outside her room, picking up carnations along the way
She opens her door, cuts inside
(65)
'  -- She goes into the bathroom, fills the sink with water, arranges the flowers within
She smiles radiantly -- they look beautiful
Suddenly something seizes her thoughts
She opens her bureau drawer quickly, pulls out the yellow pages, leafs through it hurriedly, We : Parking, Passport, Paving
then Pawnbrokers
She stops, runs her finger down the page, then hunts quickly through her drawer
Her eyes dance mischievously when she pulls out her gold chain
She places it on her bureau, hurries to her clothes rack
Suddenly, a quick  at the door-- (
) Miss
She looks around the corner -- a flower delivery  stands in the hallway, holding a bouquet of roses-- Yes
Delivery
(surprised) Come in
He cuts inside, and is followed by another , holding a bouquet of daisies-- Hey -- wait a minute
What's going on
The Men leave the room-- Downstairs
She hurries to the window, looks out-- (66)
--  -- ' -- Morris and Jerome standing by the curb, their eyes fastened excitedly on her window, leaning against a flower truck
We catch a glimpse of a Man bringing her a dozen chrysanthemums-- Good morning, dahling
(67)
'    -- () You're crazy
-- What are you doing
(excited) Come down -- come down
can't -- 've got things to do
'mon, ten minutes
want to show you something- She shakes her head-- 'm sorry, but thanks for the flowers
You're really crazy
She disappears from the window
They stand expectantly a long time
Finally Jerome looks at Morris-- Well
what do you think
Morris is staring intently at the window -- he purses his lips sensualy-- Chili sauce
Just then Vanity steps outside, looks stunning in her tight, black pants and boots
Her eyes dance vivaciously, a red sash is tied around her waste
Morris gives Jerome his sexy, half- lidded, pouty-lip look-- Oh, Lord

We  11:25 Prince cuts through the back entrance, walks onto the floor
Lisa and Wendy are onstage  a  we immediately recognize as the one they had given Prince to listen to
The is provided by the Linn Machine (a synthesized drum unit)
Wendy plays guitar, her back to Prince
Lisa, at the keyboards, spots him and stops-- What's wrong
Lisa points to Prince
Wendy immediately rips into the guitar solo of "-Spot
"  She stops suddenly-- Is that better
Do you like that
He ignores her-- Where is everybody
You're late -- they left
So what are you doing here
Lisa immediately launches into the opening bars of "Let's Get Crazy"-- (imitating Prince) But 'm here to tell you that there's something else -- our music--
The Girls bust up -- he glares at them-- Can't you guys get off it
Can't you just leave it alone
Wendy meets his glare with one of her own
Yeah -- we'll get off it
She turns, snaps off the Linn Machine angrily, plunging the club into silence
(69)
-- The Time is  like , deep in the heart of "Sex Shooter
"  Brenda and Susan move furiously to the beat, trying their best to get it right
They are watched by
Morris, Vanity  and Jerome standing off to the side
Morris has a contented look on his face, even though his girls are screwing up
Vanity's eyes are wide with excitement As you can see, we need someone with your special qualities
(70)
'    -- --Clock
We See: 8:15
Prince sits, on his bed, staring at the clock, seemingly lost in thoucht
He gets up, rummages through his coat pockets, pulls out Lisa's and Wendy's tape
He snaps it into the player, settles back
fills the room
He listens intently a moment, his face placid
He closes his eyes, tries to relax
Suddenly a   in the far reaches of the house
Harsh  echo through the upstairs hallway
Prince remains still, his eyes closed
Then another deathly dissolves in its frame and trickles to the floor like icicles
Resentment surges in him like a tornado
He rises purposefully, turns the  up
And then his door  open and his Mother  into the room in a She flings herself onto his bed as his Father streaks in and
at her with a strap, at her with an ominous growl of rage-- You ain't got no business leaving here
All your sneaking around -- you're just a sinner
You're nothing but a low life sinner
The Mother throws herself at him drunkenly, starts slapping, scratching at his face-- Shut up
You don't care about me
Leave me alone
Prince claws desperately at his Father's back-- Don't  keep the heat on
Isn't there food in the refrigerator
(crying) don't like it here
You never talk to me
'm always alone
Prince drags his Father away-- Dad, please
(shouting) What's the matter with this house
Isn't it nice and warm here
The Mother stands on the bed -- You're crazy
Shut up
Asshole
Shut up
(triumphantly) Motherfucker
The Father lunges, drags Prince along the floor,
the Mother in the face
She topples in a heap to the bed
He's over her now, breathing fire, flailing about savagely-- Shut up
Shut up
Shut up
(desperately) Dad
He lunges, drop  his Father with everything he's got
His Father backwards against the wall, slides to his buttocks on the floor
He sits there dully, exhausted
spent
Prince crawls up along the side of the bed
His Mother buries her head in the pillow, choking back sobs-- 'm just trapped here
His Father's eyes well with tears
He leans close to her, speaks softly-- You always got a roof overhead
You don't let me have any fun
His Father sighs wearily, pulls himself to his feet
He moves to the door-- could make you happy
Just believe in me
You never
would die for you
He leaves the room, closes the door behind him
stares at  the door a moment, tears welling in his eyes
His Mother is motionless, whimpering softly scent of liquor permeates the air
He moves toward her, reaches out tentatively
Suddenly she jumps up, starts pacing franticaily-- It's nice here
It's a nice house
Nothing wrong
(a beat) It's a good family
Believe me,  know
Nothing wrong here
(a beat) Your father is okay
He's a good man
You could learn somthing
She catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror, stops-- My, my
Don't you think have a good figure
Your Father did
She sits in front of the mirror, studies her face, her eyes
her breasts-- was beautiful when your Dad met me
was out-a-sight
She giggles, starts applying makeup-- looked just like a movie star
The minute he saw me singing,  knew just what he wanted
She fixes him with a conspiratorial look, whispers-- He wanted to get into my panties
She makes funny, "jazzy" eyes at him, then stops suddenly, staring
His face, mouth, eyes
a sudden stirring in her loins
Her lips part, she moistens them unconsciously
She turns from the mirror and stares at him -- his look connects with her groin
She rises suddenly, walks slowly toward the bed, sits facing him-- You look so pretty
Just like me, honey
You coulda been a girl
She outlines the mole on his cheek with a makeup pencil, then draws one on herself
She takes her earring off, and puts it on his ear
They are face to face -- identical-- So pretty
She looks at him drunkenly
He tries to hold it in, but can't
tear, hot and hard as a bullet flows down his cheek
She puts her index finger in front of his face, moves it back and forth hypnotically
Suddenly she pulls her hand away, stretches it to the ceiling like an escaping bird
He swallows, tries to smile -- she leans close -- (secretly) have to go now, see some friends
Don't tell your father, okay
She gets up, leaves the room-- Bye, skipper
bye
(71)
'  --  () Vanity climbs over a fence, moves through some bushes, emerges along side Prince's house
She has an excited, ravenous look on her face
She hurries to the casement window, climbs into the basement
(72)
' BEDROObt -- She drops down into the basement, turns excitedly, leaps into Prince's arms-- missed you
Missed you
Missed you
She hugs him tight, showers him with kisses, topples them both to the bed
Laughing, hugging, kissing -- fast and furious
Suddenly she jumps up like a panther, fluffs her hair wildly in the mirror, fixes him with a wanton look
His eyes devour her-- Come here
Where were you
She moistens her lips, walks lasciviously toward the bed, sits facing him
She laughs suddenly, pushes him back
and they're at each other again - - faces two inches apart;  touching, whispering, kissing, hands searching -- shutting out the rocm, shutting out the world
She jumps up suddenly
She can't be contained
She practically levitates-- have a big surprise for you
She rushes to the coal chute, climbs halfway through
Prince, puzzled, cracks up watching her ass and legs dangling
She drops back into the room, holding a large
His eyes widen
She struts to the bed, lays it down majestically before him-- (sings) Da
da
What is it
Open it
He starts peeling the tape off, careful not to rip the paper
Vanity's bursting with excitement though, and demolishes it in a flash
He laughs, opens the lid -- stares in shock-- Oh, no
(happy) Oh, no
He pulls out a gleaming new , and we immediately recognize it as the one they saw in the window
He's deliriously happy, and speechless-- How'd you do it
She shouts with delight, attacks him again, pushing the guitar aside
Fast, furious kisses and he responds in kind
They're twisted in a heap on the bed
After a moment they come up for air, stare at each other playfully
Something flashes across his mind-- Here
Her eyes widen
He takes off his Mother's earring, fastens it to her ear
Eyes dancing, she jumps up, studies it closely, in the mirror-- love it
She twists around, kneels beside him, showers him with bites and kisses
Suddenly she stops-- 'm going to join Morris' group
His face  drops, shocked-- What
She backs away from  him, stands, strikes a defensive stance-- 'm going to join Morris' group
He  savagely before he knows it
His hand lashes out,  her in the face
She falls back,  into the mirror
She slips dully to the floor, tries desperately to brace herself on a chair-- He's horrified-- 'm sorry
Oh, baby, 'm sorry
Are you alright
He helps her up, she turns away from him- Just
leave me alone
His heart staggers in his chest-- Please
it's just
(a beat) don't want you around this at all
just don't want you in my life this way
You don't have to prove anything to me or anybody else
(a beat) Vanity
Don't  make you happy
Don
t you like the way we are
(another thought) Do you know Morris
Do you know what he's about
He doesn't care about you
She  twists viciously-- Jealous
She rushes into the antechamber, climbs through the coal chute, disappears into the night
: (73)
-- Matt, Bobby and Mark are onstage
Prince emerges from behind the curtains
He looks drawn
and haggard, his face unshaven
The Guys spot him, and the  trickles to a stop
Tension fills the room in an instant
Mark glances at his watch, fixes Prince with a disgusted look
Prince climbs the steps to the stage, cuts across it-- Where's Lisa and Wendy
They haven't shown up yet
They call
The Guys shrug, look away
Prince simmers a moment, straps on his guitar - - immediately gets ear-splitting He stomps on the floor pedals angrily
Just then Chick comes up to the stage-- Prince
Billy Sparks wants to see you
Tell him 'm rehearsing
Uh, uh -- now
(74)
-- as Billy cuts down the stairs quickly
Prince, walking to meet him, pulls himself up short-- What do you want
You wanted to see me
Billy still moves -- Prince keeps up-- You having trouble
(shrugs) No
No
No
Where's Lisa and Wendy
He stops abruptly at the front door, studies Prince for a long time
Then he cuts outside
Prince follows
(75)
,  -- Rush hour
Billy sets the pace down the sidewalk -- Prince keeps up-- Morris called me this morning
Seems he's got himself a new group called Vanity Six
You know anything about them
(a beat) No
He tells me they're great
Thinks 'll be interested
That's cool, but now 've got a problem
What's that
book three acts --  can't afford four
If they're as good as Morris says they are, one of you will have to go
Suddenly a   off screen
Billy looks up -- a   in a black  waves-- Go around the block
The Babe pulls into the flow of traffic- It won't be The Time -- they're playing backup to Vanity
So it's either you or the Modern Aires
(a beat) What would You do in my position
Prince has a sinking feeling in his gut- (musing) like the Modern Aires
They have a good following -- they show up for practice -- and the kids like all their music
The  sweeps up to the curb
Billy opens the door, slides in-- 'Nough said
Get smart
Straighten up your shit
(76)
-- The  is
Once again The Time is deep in the guts of "Sex Shooter," but now there's a difference
The  is fiercer and crisper -- the tailored, more defined
Morris and Jerome stand off to the side sporting huge grins
They're avidly watching
Vanity, Susan, and Brenda dancing up a fierce storm
Vanity fronts the two Girls and moves panther-like in front of the mirrors
She's a dynamo, her face drawn tightly, her movements crisp and precise
She urges the Girls on, suggests and cajoles, strengthening their resolve
Sweat lathers their bodies and forms rings on their Danskins
The act is still very rough, but the potential for success can be felt
suddenly enters the hall
Morris spots him immediately and halts the The Girls dance on a moment, then stop perplexed
Vanity catches Prince's look, shakes her head in disbelief-- want to talk to you
She's out of breath, waves him off-- Not now,  'm busy
Now
goes through the Band Members - - Vanity wipes her face, fixes him with a glare-- said 'm busy -- we'll talk later
Uh, uh
He grabs her suddenly, pulls her to the door-- Leave me alone
've got a show to do
She pulls away savagely-- can't just come in here and take me away
We'll talk later
Morris is enraged-- Man -- why don't you just do the walk
Prince glares at him, cups his genitals- Why don't you kiss the one- eyed snake
The Band lets out a condescending -- the tension rises Jellybean
Jellybean, 6'4", 210 pounds, steps from behind the drums, moves up behind Prince- Let's go, Jack
Fuck you
He lunges, grabs Vanity again -- she -- Leave me alone, dammit
Get out of here
Jellybean lurches, grabs Prince in a , lifts him off his his feet
Prince kicks at him wildly-- (enraged) Fucker
He twists Prince's head backwards, his body to the ground-- Stay still, motherfucker
But Prince continues fighting him with everything he's got
Jellybean is astonished-- Shit
He twists Prince's neck savagely, his legs to the floor again and again-- Stop
Vanity is crying-- Jellybean, please
Prince drops to his hands and knees exhausted
Everybody is frozen now -- scared
The Girls are crying, the incedent has already gone too far
Jellybean settles his weight on Prince, twists his head down painfully, trying to break the resistance he alone can feel
Prince remains silent, the anger coursing through his body in tremors-- The Guys surround them, grabbing Prince's arms, legs, and feet
He's like a trapped animal now-- Lift him
(crying) Don't hurt him
They pick him up, move him toward the door
He resists them slightly, his body lurching in fit and starts
Suddenly he breaks free, faces them with his back to he door
But the Band Members surround him, their wills united, the obviousness of the situation apparent to all
He searches for Vanity's eyes, but she can't face him and walks away
Anger again surges in his veins
He cuts out the door,  it behind him
(77)
,   -- Prince  down a dirt access road locked in thought, the pain and anger in his eyes apparent
Suddenly a just behind him, sending a shot of fear through his guts
He twists backwards in amazement around the bend its  violently
Prince shudders with fright, loses control of his cycle for an instant
He hits a series of ruts that almost topple him to the ground
He looks back at the train confused, when another  seems to  him in the teeth
He twists wildly to the side of the road, kicking up dirt and debris, lurching him into the handlebars violently
The   abreast of him
Prince snaps an angry look at the engineer
The Guy coolly gives him the finger and the  violently
Prince becomes enraged
He snaps a look to the speedometer: 65 mph
He snaps a look to the Engineer -- the Guy sends him another obscene gesture and his
Prince grits his teeth, twists the throttle full
He lurches forward in an instant, blazing in front of the train, The Engineer  the mercilessly, and throws on the coals
They blast down the stretch neck to neck, twist round a wide bend
Prince edges in front
The Engineer the  and moves up

They blast around another bend neck to neck Suddenly Prince's eyes widen with horror

He shoots a look to the Engineer -- the Guy is laughing hysterically now, his  wildly, mouthing the words:  Bye Bye
Prince screams like  a
He twists his  throttle
He blazes ahead of the train,
up the embankment,  through the air
a   cuts the access road in two
He  in bloody terror
He hits the road and fishtails wildly, locking his brakes
The  comes at him like a locomotive
He's going to hit it, knows it and
He twists his throttle violently
directly into the path of the train
The Engineer looks on in horror
Prince throws his weight forward and
the train  past him as he fishtails wildly to a stop
The Engineer sails off into the dusk, his mouth agape
Prince sits there breathing fiercely, the adrenaline shrieking though his veins, watching the train disappear into the distance
(78)
--  -- flood the sidewalks, rushing for the buses that take them home
clogs  at the 77 intersections while  walk against the lights
Prince rides down the streets, hugging the right shoulder, impatient with the delays
He blasts down a side street, sees up ahead
are already crowding around
He moves through the  slowly, glides past a  , and a small has run onto the sidewalk, knocking down the marquee to a rundown, neighborhood bar
Something catches his eye -- he stops suddenly
His Mother stands against the wall, idly watching the goings on
He jumps off his bike hurriedly, walks up behind her, taps her on the shoulder-- Ma
She turns, he gasps out loud
Her left eye is swollen shut-- (drunkenly) Hi, ya, baby
Her drunken breath washes over him -- his head spins-- Ma
what happened
She rubs up against him-- Can you give me some money
'mon, just some money
She gropes for him drunkenly -- he suddenly realizes she doesn't know who he is-- Here
here
She tugs at her wedding ring-- Give me something for this
just a little
It'll be okay
'mon
'll take you home
Just then a  moves through the Crowd- Okay, c'mon now -- break it up
Let's go
The Crowd moves out
Police cackle
Three  stagger over, one of them grabbing his Mother-- 'mon, honey -- we're goin' in
She fixes Prince with a glare-- You're a little young aren't you
Get out of here
Leave her alone
(79)
-- Prince  down the , sweeps into his drive, and jumps off his bike, practically smashing it into the gate
His eyes are burning with anger
He flies up the steps three at a time, cuts across the porch, bursts throuch the front door and-- (80)
'  -- -- stalks through the living room, eyes blazing-- Where the fuck are you
He spins like a top, streaks down the hallway, throws open several doors violently-- Where are you
He cuts into the kitchen raging-- Answer me you fucker
He twists around frustrated; exhaustion, anger, and pain competing for the same space
Suddenly he stops, listens intently a moment
We  it now -- a Someone's
Prince throws a look at the basement door -- it's ajar
(81)
, '  -- naked   snaps
Prince hesitates a moment, descends the steps, pauses at the door
The  wafts delicately in the night breeze
He moves down the halllway uncertainly, but steadily, the  growing, drawing him in
He stops, peers into the antechamber
His Father is at the piano, his back to him
He's perched on the broken stool, playing with all he's got
Prince moves slowly into the room, his knees weakening, his anger flowing from him with every step he takes
Seeing his Father this way, he doesn't know if he should laugh or cry
He sits down silently behind him, listens as his Father plays
The  ends
His Father sits a moment, stretching his hands idly along the keys
Feeling a presence in the room, he spins around and jumps slightly at seeing his son
He fixes him with a threatening look, then shrugs, hunches over the keys-- Is that yours
'Course it's mine
Who else's is it goin' to be
Got all kinds of them
They're different too
'd like to see them
You got them written down somewhere
No, man --  don't write them down -- don't need to
That's the big difference between you and me
Thought you weren't going to play no more
His Father looks at him sullenly, then looks down, stares at the keys
Prince's eyes well with tears-- saw Mom up the street
She looked pretty bad
Any idea how she got that way
His Father bites his his lip, rubs a hand over his face, stares at the keys
His voice comes with difficulty-- Yeah
(a beat) got a girlfriend
You gonna get married
(long pause) don't know
His Father shares a hurtful look with him, then stares darkly at the floor below-- Never get married
(82)
-- The  is
Prince is onstage, stripped to the waist, seeping from his pores in torrents
He's deep into the pit of "Computer Blue, " locked into a provocative, obscene graphic with Wendy
She's on her knees in front of him, his crotch moving directly in front of her lips
She's made up fiercely, looks like Prince himself
The total effect is unnerving -- Prince is going down on himself
Billy Sparks stands by the bar pretty upset
Jill stands slack-jawed
The have stopped dancing, drinking -- they staring at the display,
shaking their heads confused
The  is
Prince is in his own world, living his own private hell
Suddenly the  crescendos, then winds down like a roller coaster sweeping everyone along
The changes radically
He turns his back to the audience and plays
and we suddenly recognize the as his Father's -- the song he played on the piano the night before
But it's Prince's now, stamped with his own signature
He's bent at the waist, his back to the audience, alone with his father's, and his, pain
The  fidgets
Billy Sparks fastens his eyes on Prince angrily

) -- are hanging out in front of the club
The usual queue, however, is noticeably absent
The yellow Caddy sweeps up
Jerome is at the wheel, Morris and Vanity sit in the back
Morris is dressed elegantly, resplendent in a 5O's-style suit
She's beautiful in a sleek black dress, with long black gloves, and heels-- What are we doing here, Morris
What do you mean
don't want to be here don't want to hurt anybody
It's not about hurting anybody
This is business
We can use the exposure
Just then Brenda and Susan come up to the car excitedly
Brenda is dressed in a 40's-style dress, Susan wears a form- fitting leopard one
They both look gorgeous-- Hi -- you coming in
Their excitement and nervousness is endearing
Vanity's heart goes out to them
She forces a smile, climbs out unaided-- Your horns are showing, Morris
Yeah
but they're holding up my halo
(84)
-- Prince is on-stage, deep into the closing moments of "Computer Blue
"  He paces back and forth frantically, still locked in his own private hell
The Crowd's attention has wandered, however, and very few remain on the dance floor, finding it too much trouble to keep up with the changing shifts in the music
Even his band members are edgy, casting quick looks to each other, wishing to get on with more compelling audience- pleasing sounds
as Billy Sparks shakes hands with Morris and Jerome and is introduced to Vanity Six for the first time
We can tell by his reaction that he likes what he sees
He kisses Brenda and Susan, saves a special squeeze for Vanity herself
He escorts the whole group to a table across the floor
Vanity brings up the rear, casts a quick look to Prince onstage
fastens on her and brings "Computer Blue" to a rousing end
The Crowd applauds, but it's more out of respect than eagerness
He doesn't seem to notice though, or care
He confers quickly with his group
, then moves center-stage
The Band Members trade frustrated looks with each other -- it's obvious that they have some trouble with the next song
Prince presses his lips to the mike, and the  starts
He begins "Darling Nicky"-- knew a girl named Nicky, guess you can say she was a sex fiend
met her in a hotel lobby masturbating in magazines
She said, How'd you like to waste some time, And  could not resist When  saw little Nicky grind
shoots a fierce look to Prince, helps Morris, Jerome and the Girls to their table
Vanity is watching Prince, a puzzled look on her face-- Hee, hee
little empty tonight, huh, Billy
But guess money isn't everything
Jerome busts up-- Oh no
that's cold
But Billy agrees-- The Duke of Dick is in rare form tonight
They all look toward the stage-- is fastened on Vanity and it's apparent to all
He launches into the next verse- She took me to her castle And  could not believe my eyes
She had so many devices Everything that money could buy
She said, Sign your name on the dotted line, The lights went out, And Nicky started to grind
flushes with embarrassment
Billy and Morris notice this and glare at Prince
looks dead-center at them, and then to Vanily-- woke up the next morning
Nicky wasn't there
looked all ov'r all  found Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you for a funky time, Call me up when ev'r you want to grind
stands suddenly, fighting back tears
She backs from the table quickly, knocks the chair over
Morris tries to help her, but she sweeps past him, hurrying for the exit

Chick sees her, reached out to help-- Hey
But she pulls away, runs out the door, cuts across the street

He strips off his guitar, cuts from the stage, ignoring the grave looks from his Band Members

He Cuts into the dressing room

Suddenly the  flies open
Billy Sparks enters angrily-- What the fuck's wrong with you, Prince
don't have time for your bullshit, Billy
What do you want
My stage is no place for your personal shit
That's life, man
Life my ass, motherfucker
This is a business, and you're not too far gone to see that
(a beat) 've told you this before
You're not pulling them in like you used to
The only person who gives a fuck about your music is yourself
Fuck off
But Billy can't help laughing-- Just like your old man
Prince shoots him a threatening look-- Yeah -- you got it
Tell me 'm wrong
(a beat) You're not blind
Look around you
No one's digging you
Prince turns away-- Look at your band
Are they in here right now
They're out there 'cause they can't stand being in the same room with you
(a beat) What a fucking waste
like father, like son-- Lay off that
Billy turns to go-- Take your head out of your ass, Prince, check it out -- unless you like the view up there
Your music doesn't make sense to anyone but yourself
He closes the door behind him
Prince stands dully a moment, then sits heavily in a chair
Exhaustion suddenly overwhelms him
He rests his head in his hands, moments tick by
He shakes himself awake -- Morris and Jerome stand by the door-- That was fucked up what you did man
Morris doesn't like it
And being a part of this - -  don't like it either
don't care
Hee, hee
huh, it's obvious you don't have what it takes to be on top
He pulls an envelope from his pocket-- But to show you that 'm sympathetic to your problems - - here's a pass to our show tomorrow night
Enjoy it
They leave

Jerome tries to smile, but his nervousness is simply too strong
The Clown hands him another flower, trying to elicit a favorable response
Jerome is patient, but attempts to ignore the Clown in a polite way, indicating he'd rather be alone
The Clown persists, however, going through a little routine, handing him flower after flower
Suddenly Jerome throws them into the air, grabs the Clown by the throat and flings him headlong down the hallway
The Clown gives Jerome the finger and walks off in a huff
cuts from the dressing room, closes the door behind him
He joins Jerome at the curtain, and they move down the back stairway to the -- (nervously) guess this is it

The  is slick and fierce, the Girls sexy and sure
Wearing black bikini panties, black tails and boots, Vanity dances center-stage and begins She's mesmerizing, her look so alluring, so profound that the audience sits slack-jawed in amazement
The is hers and she soaks it in, radiating a sexiness that has the audience at her feet
The entire concept -- dress, dance, music and staging -- is overwhelming, with just the right degree of playfulness to allow the Crowd easy passage into the fantasy world the Girls create
Brenda and Susan play off her wonderfully, sharing secret looks with the Crowd, balancing the wickedness of the act with an innocence that is enticing
They're working strongly as a unit now, the roaring their approval

The pull off their shades immediately, sit back and glow in the audience's response

Her strength and sureness in front of the Crowd is breathtaking
The audience loves her and he suddenly feels very alone -- as if another wall has gone up between them
He looks away a moment and spots
Morris looking at him with a self- satisfied, triumphant grin on his face
Prince looks away, moves out of his eyesight
"Sex Shooter" comes to an end
The stage is plunged into darkness

The Girls, slighly over-whelmed by the response and flushing deep red, hold one another

watches the Girls bowing to thunderous Suddenly Vanity looks at him and touches the earring she's wearing -- it's his Mother's
His knees weaken instantly, and he locks eyes with her
The heat between them is unmistakable
She smiles vividly, gives him an endearing wave and steps back as the curtain closes
He's  through the Crowd before he knows it, trying to get to the backstage door
The Crowd is thick, his path momentarily blocked
He spots Billy Sparks cutting across the floor and congratulating Morris and Jerome
Prince turns from them, tries once again to make his way through the Crowd
(94)
,   --   -- and the Girls rush into the dressing room and jump up and down with excitement
They are beside themselves with happiness, kissing and hugging one another avidly
Suddenly Vanity pulls away, indicates she will be back and cuts out the room
as she runs down the hallway to the backstage area, peers from behind the curtain, scanning the club earnestly
(95) '
--   --   -- as Prince waits impatiently in the long line
Billy Sparks comes by, spots him and stops-- Morris is squeezing you, kiddo
You better kick ass tomorrow night or else
He cuts outside, disappears into the Crowd
Prince stands there steaming, the wind knocked out of him, his joy a memory
He turns back to the line, but it has grown, the Crowd now jammed up against the door
Frustrated, he cuts outside
as Vanity watches Prince leave profound sadness sweeps her face
Suddenly Susan is by her Side, hugging and kissing her happily
Brenda runs up, pouring champagne
Morris, Jerome and The Time are at the end of the hallway and beckon her excitedly into the room
Vanity forces a smile, goes down the hallway, casting another look at the exit door
(96)
,   -- Morris and Vanity stagger down the obviously very drunk
Morris pulls from a
Vanity is still in her lingerie, wears an open coat over it
Her speech is slurred-- Did you hear these people applauding
They loved us -- they wanted to rip us apart, and this is just our first night
can see it now, we're all going to be big stars
can feel it
(singing) Ain't nobody bad like me
She kisses him spontaneously on the cheek-- Morris, you're a genius
Ye-es
He fixes her with a sexy look, takes a healthy look from his flask, then gives it too her
Vanity throws her head back, drinks fully, the liquor coursing over her cheeks
He devours her with his eyes, opens the door to the Caddy-- Let's go, Bebe
She stops as if remembering something-- Huh, where's Jerome
In his skin
hee, hee
He's trying to nudge her into the Caddy- Is he coming
gave him the night off
Why
He staggers back from the car, undulates his hips wantonly-- Whawhak
She busts up
Just then a can be heard off screen
They look around drunkenly, trying to discern its direction
Suddenly Prince around the corner
He streaks by Morris and  him flat on his ass into the garbage-- (wails) Oh, no -- Oh, God
No
Prince skids to a slick stop
Vanity is transfixed
The entire episode  took less than five seconds
He twists the throttle,  down upon her
She breaks in a panic
She runs clumsily down another alley, her coat flying
He  after her like a madman
She flies around the corner -- a dead end
He fishtails to a slick stop-- Get on
There's no way out
Suddenly she lets out an excited , jumps on
He guns the bike,  up the alley
Morris jumps into his path drunkenly, his arms extended-- Stop
Stop
But Prince  down upon him, sending him slipping and sliding to safety
He around the bend-- Motherfucker
You long-haired faggot
(97)
-- Prince and Vanity  down the highway
(98)
-- They streak down the road, slow, then move down a small embankment
He stops the bike and gets off
She's in a foul mood, staggers around dully, her head pounding, her speech slurred-- So here we are again
So this is it, huh
What do you want this time
He looks at her painfully, upset about her drunken state-- What's your problem now
What's your main problem
No problem
just wanted to talk, alright
just want us to be okay, to really get along
No big deal
She cackles, falls flat on her ass, hoists herself up-- No big deal, huh
She pulls Morris'  from her jacket -- his eyes blacken-- Give me that
No, definitely not
Who are you
You can't tell me what to do
She puts it to her lips-- Please don't drink that
Give it to me
She holds the flask to her lips defiantly, then goes to drink
He lashes out suddenly,  it from her grip
She  wildly,  him hard across the face
He stands shocked a moment, his rage surging within him, smashing through every safety valve he's acquired in his life
He  her savagely across the jaw
She hits the ground like a rag doll
He looks at her curiously, bends over her - - she sucker-punches him with everything she's got
He  in rage and grabs her hands as they flail about his face
He squeezes her fingers back while the tears stream down her cheeks and her mouth forms a silent "ow"
She bares her teeth angrily and he sucks at her mouth, biting and kissing her in a fever pitch
She kicks at him violently, hot tears streaming down her cheeks
He jams his leg between hers, rubs it firmly against her bottom
She struggles helplessly against him as he covers her breasts, her stomach, her thighs with his lips
Quick breaths escape from her -- her breathing begins to race
He snaps her panties in two, pulls them from between her legs
She spreads herself as he releases his pants
She squeezes his buttocks, pulls him toward her -- but Prince resists her coldly, regards her with contempt
Suddenly he flips her onto her stomach, forces her to stand painfully on her knees
He rubs his hand between her buttocks, then thrusts into her painfully, driving himself to the very depths of her
but she stifles a cry, arches her back, and meets his thrusts fiercely, moving quicker and quicker, banging her buttocks against his thighs again and again
She's drawing from him now, turning the humiliation around, obtaining all that she needs and desires
He's powerless -- her thrusts set the pace
She rises, Prince still inside her and tugs on him rapidly, causing him to ejaculate suddenly, drawing from him a sharp and sudden cry
She moves away, draws her coat tightly about her, fixes him with a contemptuous look-- You're nothing, Prince, absolutely nothing
You think you're so special --  but deep down you're just like all the rest
(a beat) Your whole life you've been hiding, hiding behind your music
But now you don't even have that, because last night
last night you used it to hurt someone, someone who really cares
She runs up the embankment, wipes away her tears, faces him-- If you put your hands on me like that ever again, 'll be the last person you touch
She pulls off his Mother's earring, throws it at him
Tears flowing, she streaks into the  blindly, directly into the path of a  - spots her in his ,  on his brakes
He  wildly across the road, comes to a , stop inches from her thigh
shoots a look at Prince, her lips trembling, her love for him, written plainly on her face
But his eyes flash defiantly
She bites her lip sadly, then snaps a hot look at the Driver-- need a  ride
She cuts around the car, hops in
The Driver skids off into the night
Prince stands there trembling, watches as it disappears into the distance
: (99)
'  -- Prince pulls up to the wooden gate, cuts the motor, gets off
He walk wearily across the porch, moves to the front door -- it's wide open
He thinks nothing of it, cuts into the house, closes it behind him
(100)
'  --    -- He stands by the door motionless, a curious look on his face
The  is on, the  skipping monotonously along the record
His mouth opens into a spasm-- Dad
Silence
sudden dread courses through him, leaving a hollow in his stomach
His feet are like lead
He moves heavily into the room-- Mom
Nothing
Panic sets in
He down the hallway, twists open the bedroom door -- it's empty
Blue glows through the windows
play delicately in the breeze
He's thoughtful, walks back into the living room
the   is
He looks at it curiously, wondering stupidly if it had always been like that
Then sudden bolt of fear makes his head swim
lamp, a porcelain dish, some knickknacks on the mantle -- all smashed
He rushes into the kitchen, looks around crazily-- Daddd
Nothing but the decay of his scream
The  door is ajar
He cuts to it quickly, pulls it open, peers frantically into the darkness below
He snaps  the light
(101) (102)
'  -- The  is a riot of and

, '  -- The  is  with Prince's father is strapped into a gurney, staring dully at the ceiling
snap pictures as work feverishly over him
are pushed into his veins
An   is placed over his nose and mouth
Huge white bandages are bunched up along the back of his head
His Mother is kneeling by the gurney, crying hysterically, grasping his hands in a white panic
support her
Someone is  instructions
crackle incessantly cries-- Lift
And the gurney is hoisted up the stairs quickly, the bulk of the crowd following, his Mother supported as she ascends the stairs
Prince sits on a tattered sofa in the corner, his head bowed
Cops standing and kneeling beside him
Somebody finished taking notes, closes his pad
One Cop rests a hand on his shoulder, talks to him in soft tones
Prince shakes his head slightly
The Cop gives the group a signal and everyone disperses, moves up the stairs
The Cop looks at him sympathetically, then closes the door behind him
(104)
-- sits motionless a long time
Moonlight floods the basement with a foreboding light
dog  somewhere in the distance
He looks up suddenly, his face agitated, his eyes red from tears
' -- on the floor outlining the body of his Father
There's a  in his Father's hand clearly marked
train  in the distance
He's staring at the gun
He shakes his head, rubs a hand over his face vigorously and looks up again
the  in his Father's hand
He can't get it out of his mind
The is
He lurches to his feet, paces back and forth crazily
His Father's head, the gun
the gun
the
The  is
He throws himself into the chair, buries his face deeply into his hands and cries
Huge racking sobs spasm through his body
His Father, his Mother, his entire life, his music, his guitar
He looks up suddenly -- the gun in his Father's hand
and he stares at it
The  is
His heart is pounding in his ears
He squeezes them shut, looks up
The gun
He bolts to his feet, paces back and forth in a panic
The train is
rope in the corner of the room, his face, the gun
He sits dully, gazes at the rope as if in a trance
The  is  past the house, it's
The rope, the gun, and his body dangling from the rafters in the night breeze-- (screaming) Noooooo
He lurches to his feet, cuts through the basement like a madman
He grabs a stick and starts  things crazily, moving through the room swinging his stick wildly again and again
He's lost to himself now, deep in the pit of an unknown terror, expurgating a horror that has been festering in him for years
He flings his stick at the wall, unends shelves and bureaus, trampling old memories that have lain dormant for years
Drawer after drawer is flung against the wall, their contents smashing and scattering about
He opens a large, oaken chest and flips over
Thick three inch piles of yellowed paper fall out
He snaps through the rubber bands holding them together and flings the paper at the wall again and again
he stops suddenly, shocked
He musical notes written down on the paper
his heart pounding in his chest, he searches frantically through the rubble scattered about him
More and more musical notes, sketched ideas, simple melodies, entire songs and scores -- all meticulously recorded on lined yellowed paper, dated for the last 20 years, and signed
by his Father
He's shocked to a standstill
Then the full significance of what's before him hits him like a sledgehammer
He collapses in agony against the chest, tears flowing down his cheeks
(105)
--     (  ) Prince lying outstretched on the basement floor, sleeping fitfully, feverishly
His body is lathered in sweat, the droplets glisten in the pale light
Cool, gray dawn
He's in a dead sleep on the floor, his arms outstretched, his legs twisted beneath him
His Father's outline seemingly rests by his side
Just then the basement window begins to glow with
It inches slowly across the floor, then sweeps him majestically, bathing him in its warmth
He wakes slowly, stretches his limbs like an opening flower
After a moment he sits up, shades his eyes
The basement is littered with debris
The destruction is complete, but in the midst of it lies his Father's music
The yellow parchment is scattered about glowing in the sunlight
Something seems to flash across his mind
he stands, moves quickly down the hallway to the antechamber
Suddenly we  a
After a moment
and we immediately recognize it as Lisa's and Wendy's
It plays a moment, then snaps off abruptly
He stands locked in thought, then sits behind the piano, hunts for the first few notes of Lisa's and Wendy's song
: (105A)
-- Prince's Father is lying on the bed, sleeping peacefully
large bandage is wrapped along the back of his head
His Mother sits by his side, her forehead resting on the covers, her hands holding his
She's in deep sleep, and it's obvious at once that she's been by his side the entire time
Prince steps from the shadows of the room and gazes at them fighting back the emotion that wells within him
He leans close and kisses them both gentlythen-- (over) (excited) Let's bring them back
Ladies and gentlemen, The Time
(106)
(1ST
) -- The  goes
Morris, Jerome and the Time return to the stage to a frenzied throng
The  is , the  applauding like strobe the house in a frenzy
It's a glorious night, and Morris struts back and forth imperialistically criss- crossing the stage like a lion, urging the audience on
He grabs a mike-- You love us right
You want us right
can't hear you
The  is  -- Morris flashes a wide, exaggerated grin-- What time is it
(a beat) Whawhak
And
The Time launches into "The Bird" and Morris, laughing heartily, does 'The Bird" (dance) with Jerome as the audience  their approval
(107)
/ -- as Prince and his Band sit in grave silence, the exuberant  of the filtering through the open door
Jill is also in the room, sitting on a table, holding the dog silently in her lap
She casts sidelong looks to Prince, tears welling in her eyes
The Band Members fidget nervously, knowing full well that their jobs are on the line, and feeling awful about the personal tragedy that has befallen Prince
The entire situation is very tense, and it's made worse every time the crowd lets out a delighted  of approval
But Prince sits placidly, his face an enigma, his feelings a mystery
(108)
-- And it couldn't be more of a contrast
The place is a riot of color and raucous carryings on
"The Bird" is a smashing success with everyone on the dance floor trying gamely to get the steps right
Morris and Jerome are flushed with pride, surprising even themselves with their impromptu adjustments to the act
The  crescendos, then comes to a rousing blistering end
The stage is plunge into darkness
the goes
Billy Sparks shakes his head happily-- Jesus
(109)
-- Morris, Jerome and The Time cut briskly past admiring , laughing and shouting crazily-- (ad lib) It's all over now
He better watch out
He doesn't even need to go on
He might as well go home
(110)
-- As Prince, Jill and the Band sit in dead silence listening to The Time's bluster off screen
Suddenly The Time crosses the doorway -- Morris does a double- take, sticks his head into the room-- How's the family
Whawhak
The Time busts up, drags Morris from the room
Prince's group is shocked, casts furtive glances to him -- but he remains serene, then-- (over) Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Prince
Applause offscreen
Prince stands abruptly, straps on his guitar
His Band Members look at him closely, trying to discern his feelings
He gives them a cursory glance, cuts out the door
(111)
-- Prince hits the stage and the grows, but it' s nothing like the exuberance that greeted Morris
He moves center-stage and plants himself there, his eyes staring into the audience
leans against the bar, a smug look on his face
walks slowly up the stairs, gazes at Prince
does not move
The  trickles away
He continues to stare in the audience making no attempt to direct his Band, or start a tune
nervous ripples though the crowd
Those who know about the tragedy feel a profound embarrassment for him -- but no one turns away
Then his voice comes clear and mellifluous-- would like to do a song that two of my friends wrote
, cuts through the Crowd like a riptide
Prince snaps a look to Lisa and Wendy and confirms that it is indeed their song
They can't believe it
Tears spring to Wendy's eyes before she knows it
Prince smiles at her, then gazes at his entire Band
Their eyes fasten on him in an instant
He counts softly and
The opening bars of "Purple Rain
"  He turns to to the audience and It's a ballad, a poem really, a plea for understanding, love, and survival
It's a testament, a pact if you will, between himself and others
The  is mesmerized, all  are upon him -- but Prince doesn't notice
Lips pressed against the mike, dark eyes streaming, he's lost to himself now, loosening all that's within him, cleansing himself of his rage, hatred and pain
is crying
Every moment she has shared with him is expressed in this song, and the effect on her is unnerving
Her heart leaps to him in a way she never thought possible
But she lets it go willingly, as the words draw her in, seducing her somehow, making her free
as if the music, his words, all that he has experienced and  understood, is purging what is confused and ugly within herself, leaving her with an understanding and joy that burns in her womb like soft fire
smile springs to her lips as tears continue to flow, and she finds herself moving closer
as the Audience moves closer, drawn somehow to the stage, to the person who so truly, to the person who gives of himself unselfishly to all that he feels
Prince begins a long sustained  that cuts though the hearts of all present
The  builds awsomely, and he continues to sing out, emptying himself of all the remaining pain lying within
The  crescendos and comes to a quiet end
Stunned
silence so profound you could hear a pin drop
Prince sighs, assumes the worse, then cuts across the stage purposefully
Now some And a  from the back and the
And more  and some even
And the and the  and the  growing and growing as
(112)
-- Prince cuts from the stage in a frenzy, rushes toward the rear exit
The is building and building until it's a , an onrushing , an avalanche of  that rocks the club mightily
is still running though, his face streaming with tears, past the surprised look of Jill, past the , past everyone -- stripping of his clothes fiercely, flinging off his jacket, his shirt, his scarf-- (113)
,
--  -- He  open the door, outside
He sucks in the night air as if he was drowning
He wipes away his tears, rushes to his bike, starts to undo the chain
they're  his
Not randomly, not haphazardly, but
in unison
And relentless, very demanding, downright urgent, and
it's beautiful
wry smile crosses his lips
He heads back to the door
Jill is there, scared, her face a map of tears
He flashes her a smile-- Hi
She's thunderstruck, can barely squeak it out-- Hi
And he whips into the hallway
Her face dissolves into a smile of pure joy
(114)
-- now,  and
The is  with
They reach for him as he passes, touching him, showering him with their love
Someone hands him his shirt, another his scarf -- it's so intense
He's moving quickly now, his jacket up ahead, closer
he stops suddenly, stunned
Vanity is holding his jacket
He's struck speechless -- she hands it to him smiling, tears streaming down her face-- love you
His knees go weak, she kisses him spontaneously, pushes him lovingly to the stage
(115)
-- He's half-running now like crazy -- his Band is on-stage, peering anxiously into the hallway
They spot him and relief sweeps their faces like a tidal wave
He whips his jacket on, rushes up the stairs
(116)
-- Prince walks center- stage
and bows
The  goes He acknowledges Wendy and Lisa, and then the entire Band
The is jumping out of their skin
He straps on his guitar, gives a deft signal and-- The Band launches into " Would Die For You
"  Vanity squeezes her way through the crowd and stands watching Prince from the wings
He presses his lips to the mike and
The  continues as we
: (117)
, '  -- Prince walks through the slowly, gazes at the smashed table, the broken lamp and dishes
Every item in the room suddenly takes on a profound significance
His father's slippers under the sofa, his mother's knickknacks on the table, her pen and ink drawings on the wall
After a moment, he picks up his father's slippers, studies them a long time
(118)
-- The  opens -- a  snaps
He walks into the room, places his father's slippers in the
His Mother's dress is lying in a heap on the floor
He picks it up, and puts it away
(119)
-- as he descends the steps hesitantly
The  is covered with rubble
He sits on the steps, stares at his father's  on the floor
" Would Die For You" continues as we
: (120)
-- Prince on-stage  " Would Die For You
"  The  is captivated, locked into his grip again
His eyes seem to be focused on something far away
He closes them tightly, presses his lips against the mike
The  continues as we
: (121)
, '  -- He's in the final stages of cleaning the basement floor
The debris has been swept up, shelves righted, smashed items thrown away
He stacks his Father's music neatly, tears welling in his eyes
He places it in new boxes, stands wearily, a fulfilled look on his face
Suddenly he stops -- stares at the awful chalk marks on the floor:  his Father lying down, the gun gripped in his hand
" Would Die For You" continues as we
: (122)
-- Prince on-stage   " Would Die For You
"  He's lost to himself now, locked into a personal horror he alone can see
The  is pressed against the stage, mesmerized by his performance
Billy Sparks is also drawn in, amazed at the power being generated from the stage
Prince sweeps the audience with his eyes, then fastens on Vanity earnestly,  directly to her
The  continues as we
: (123)
, '  -- He pulls a  from behind the washer, draws it on to the floor
He hesitates a moment, gazes one last time at his Father's outline, tears welling in his eyes
He turns the water on, watches as the dusty yellow chalk gives way reluctantly, mixing with the water, swirling down the drain
Calmness sweeps his face like a passing cloud
Just then  blazes in through the casement windows
Water droplets glisten brilliantly in the morning light
He turns the water off, goes to put the hose back -- stops suddenly, surprised
his Mother's earring lies on the floor
He's entranced, picks it up, stares at it a moment
Everything he's been through comes rushing at him like a loco motive
The confusion, the shouting and violence, the darkness that eclipsed his parents' life -- it's all there, lying just below the surface, settled into his heart
But now there's a difference -- he knows it's there and has discovered what could happen when it takes control of your life
So as he stands in the basement, on the clean cellar floor, he realizes that
he'll just take one thing at a time, and do it right
Better than anybody else
He smiles, realizes that in the last few weeks, he's never felt better than he feels right now
He turns quickly, flips the earring to the stairwell
Vanity plucks it from the air
Their eyes lock and they share smiles of pure joy
He picks up his father's music, and they both head up the stairs
" Would Die For You" continues as we-- : (124)
-- Everyone is  up and down
Prince is radiant, strutting across the stage, his hands upraised
The  goes
He flashes a wide grin to Vanity, then twists, eyeballs the  wickedly, wonderfully
It's too much
Everyone is joining in now
Even Morris and Jerome, standing in the wings, start like crazy
Then suddenly they catch themselves, stop, act dignified
But Vanity sees them and busts up
They catch her look, laugh heartily and join in again
The  segues into a fierce
The  lets out a
Prince strips off his guitar, streaks center- stage
The Band launches into "Baby, 'm  Star
" And the  laughing, dancing, shouting and loving
The  is
And the  continues
forever
