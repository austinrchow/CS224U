"' " by Bruce Joel Rubin - swarm of helicopters swoops out of a yellow sky and deposits an army of men over a Vietnamese hillside
The  scramble over the terraced rice paddies for the protection of the jungle
Falling into coulmns, like strands of soldier ants, seventy-five men, at combat readiness, assemble on the edge of a sweltering wilderness
It is dusk
The mood is lazy, soporific
Members of one platoon huddle close to the ground smoking a joint
Strong stuff
(to , a soldier squatting several yards away) Hey, Professor, how many times can you shit in an hour
Don't bug 'im
Where are those gooks already
Some offensive
don't even think they're out there
Jesus, this grass is something else
returns to the group, pulling up his pants
Why even bother to pull 'em up
You jackin' off out there again, huh Jake
Hey, get off his back
It's called philosophizing, right Professor
gives them the finger
Up yours, you adolescent scum
Laughter
(
) Mount your bayonets
(frightened) Oh shit
Goddam
Gimme that joint
Hey, something's wrong
What is it
My head
It's nerves
Take another toke
reaches out, extending a joint
Suddenly he gasps and falls to the ground, his body convulsing uncontrollably
The others stand back, startled
grabs him and shoves a rifle barrel between his chattering teeth
What's going on
Before anyone can answer  grabs his head, screaming
He turns frantically in all directions
Help me
Help me
What the hell
In seconds  is spinning wildly out of control, his head shaking into a terrific blur
He crashes into  with the force of a truck
slams into the ground as all the air rushes from his lungs
He begins gasping and hyperventilating
His eyes grow wide and frenzied as he gulps for air
Fear and confusion sweep across his face
The watch, horrified, as 's terror escalates beyond reason into all- out panic
Suddenly  begins howling
He lunges for his bayonet and, without warning, attacks the  around him
God Almighty
spins out of the way as 's bayonet impales the ground jumps on top of  and wrestles him into the tall grass
rushes to his assistance
stares at 's face as  struggles beneath him
It is the face of a madman
Good God
What's happening
The sudden chaos is intensified by the sound of fighting erupting behind them
Guns crackle and bursts of light penetrate the darkening sky
Behind you
Look out
This is it
The  spin around
panics and jumps to his feet, leaving alone with
's eyes burn with demonic force as he gathers his strength
Don't leave me
Dark figures, silhouetted by the setting sun, are storming at them
squint to see
It is a horrifying vision
They're coming
Gunfire explodes on all sides
Suddenly  flips out
He begins screaming uncontrollably, ripping at his clothes and skin
is struggling like four men and  is weakening in his effort to restrain him
Bayonets glimmer in the exchange of fire
Bodies fall
More bodies keep coming
The first wave is upon them
shoots into the air
Shadowy forms hurl forward screaming like banshees
, squinting, jabs with his bayonet, piercing the belly of his attacker
Agonizing cries accompany his fall
yanks the bayonet out and stabs again
In the midst of this madness  shoots to his feet and slams the butt of his rifle into 's back
There is a cracking sound
's eyes freeze with pain
His hands rush for his spine
As he spins around one of the  jams all eight inches of his bayonet blade into 's stomach
screams
It is a loud and piercing wail
to a sudden rush through a long dark tunnel
There is a sense of enormous speed accelerating toward a brilliant light
The rush suggests a passage between life and death, but as the light bursts upon us we realize that we are passing through a   far below the city of
- screech through the station , sitting alone in the last car, wakes up
The sounds of the scream and the grating wheels merge
He is dazed and confused, not certain where he is
glances around the empty car
His eyes gravitate to overhead advertisements for hemorrhoid perparations and savings banks
Gradually his confusion subsides
Shifting uncomfortably he pulls a thick book out of his back pocket, "The Stranger" by Albert Camus
He begins reading
Another station blurs by
is a good-looking man, of obvious intelligence
He is in his mid- thirties
It is surprising that he is wearing a mailman's uniform
He doesn't look like one
The subway ride seems to go on interminably
is restless and concerned
He glances at his watch
It is 3:30
Putting his book in his back pocket,  stands up and makes his way through the deserted car
- enters the rumbling passageway between the cars
The wheels spark against the rails
The dark tunnel walls flash by
He pulls the handle on the door to the next car
It is stuck
He struggles with it sitting alone inside turns to look at him
She seems threatened by his effort
He motions for her to help
She turns away
look of disgust crosses 's face
He kicks the door
It slides open
The  seems frightened as he approaches her
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet
(she doesn't answer) Excuse me
(she does not acknowledge his existence) Look, 'm asking a simple question
Have we hit Nostrand Avenue
fell asleep
(speaking with a Puerto Rican accent) no from around here
(glad for a response) Yeah, you and everyone else
walks to the other end of the car and sits down
The only other passenger is an   lying asleep on the fiberglass bench
Occasionally his body shudders
It is the only sign of life in him
The train begins to slow down
peers out of the window
Nostrand Avenue signs appear
He is relieved
He gets up and grabs hold of the overhead bar
The   shudders and stretches out on the seat
As he adjusts his position, tugging at his coat,  catches a brief glimpse of something protruding from beneath the coat's hem
His eyes fixate on the spot, waiting for another look
There is a slight movement and it appears - a long, red, fleshy protuberance
The sight of it sends shivers up 's spine
It looks strangely like a tail
Only the stopping of the train breaks 's stare
- is the only passenger getting off
The doors close quickly behind him
He glances at the  sitting by the window
There is a fearful expression on her face as the train carries her back into the dark tunnel, out of his sight
reaches the exit, a huge metal revolving door surrounded by floor to ceiling gates
He is about to push when he notices a chain locking it shut
He stares at it in disbelief
Goddam it
He turns in a huff and hikes to the other end of the platform
As he approaches the far exit, his eyes widen
The gate there is also locked
His hands reach for his hips as he studies an impossible situation
stepping cautiously onto the ladder going down to the tracks
rat scampers by and he gasps
No way
He starts to climb back up the ladder but sees that there is nowhere else to go
He juts out his jaw and steps back down
is not comfortable on the tracks
He cannot see where he is stepping
His shoes slpash in unseen liquid which makes him grimace
The steel girders are coated in subway grime
The oily substance coats his hands as he reaches for support
Goddam fucking city
He wipes the grime on his postal uniform as he steps toward the center track
He reaches for another girder when it begins to vibrate
Two pinpoints of light hurl toward him
Then the noise arrives confirming his fear
train is bearing down on him
looks frightened, not sure which way to go
He steps forward, up to his ankle in slime
He cannot tell which track the train is on
It is moving at phenomenal speed
The station is spinning
The train's lights merge into one brilliant intensity
In near panic  jumps across the track as the train spins by
Its velocity blows his hair straight up as though it is standing on end
He clings to a pillar for support, gasping in short breaths
few  are staring at  from the train
Their faces, pressed up against the glass, seem deformed
lone figure waves at him from the rear window
The train bears them all away
Then it is quiet again
For a moment  is afraid to move but slowly regains his composure
He continues to the other side of the tracks and stumbles up the ladder to the
: smiling
The smile, however, is one of irony, not amusement
This exit too is locked
heavy chain is wrapped through the bars stares at it with an expression of total bewilderment
sudden muffled scream alerts  that he is not alone
His head turns but sees no one
He hears the scream again
He senses its direction and walks toward the '
crack of light appears under the door
He can hear someone moaning inside
knocks softly and the moaning stops
The lights click off
Hey, is someone in there
There is no answer
stands silently for a moment, not sure what to do
He can hear whispering
He chews his lower lip nervously and then reaches for the door
It pushes open
The light from the station penetrates the darkness
He gasps
He sees a tied naked to the stall with    grabbing quickly for his clothes
The   screams
Fuck off
Mind your own business
spins out of the shadows, pointing a kinfe at 's throat
You cocksucker
Get outta here
The 's face is barely human
Before  can even react the door slams shut
The lock engages
The crack of light reappears
can hear laughter coming from inside, followed by a scream
He backs away from the door
His face is white
turns with full fury and storms the gate
The chain gives wayto his anger
It flies apart and the gate flings open
He stands in amazement, observing the chain as it slides from between the bars and drops to the concrete below
The gate squeaks loudly as  pushes it aside and clangs with an almost painful burst as he slams it shut
- walks toward the towering shadows of a massive It is dark and the moonlight silhouettes the huge monolithic structures
passes through a vast  dominated by the imposing shapes
Aside from his moving body everything is still

He uses three keys to unlock the door to his

- enters the darkness without turning on the light
He tries to navigate his way to the , illuminated by a tiny nightlight in the distance
His effort is unsuccessful
He bangs loudly into a table
"s voice calls out
(
) Jake, is that you
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture
(
) Why didn't you turn on the light
didn't want to wake you
(
) (sleepy but pleasant) Gee, thanks a lot
Where is the lamp
(
) Where are you
If  knew  wouldn't have to ask
What did you do

That's all

light suddenly goes on
"" , 33, is standing in the  door tying a man's terrycloth bathrobe around her waist
Although sleepy, disheveled, and not looking her best, it is obvious that  is a beefy woman, juicy and sensual
That help
(nearly sprawled over the couch) Thanks
He pushes himself up
What do you think
What do you mean
The room
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow
It is tomorrow
Four
How come you're so late
Roberts didn't show up
What could say
Besides, it's double time
(seeing the grease on his uniform) What happened to you
(unbuttoning his shirt as he walks to the ) Don't ask
steps into the  and pulls at his clothes, leaving them in a pile on the floor
He reaches for the faucet and sends a stream of water pouding against the porcelain tub
enjoys 's nakedness
She reaches out to his chest and squeezes one of his nipples
His body tenses slightly
drops her robe
They enter the shower together
- falls on a dark night filling puddles of water
is crawling through the underbrush in the Vietnamese
His shirt is bloodsoaked
He moves slowly, creeping on his right forearm
His left arm is holding his intestines from spilling onto the grass
Help me
Someone
Suddenly a flashlight beam can be seen in the distance
It dances around the bamboo trees and draws closer to
It is impossible to see who is carrying it
The light darts near the ground where  is lying and then bursts directly into his eyes
'
- pours through the  window
is sleeping fitfully as a bar of light saturates his face
His hand rushes up to cover and protect his eyes but the damage is done
He is awake
lies in bed for a few moments, dazed
Slowly his hand gropes along the shelf at the head of the bed, searching for his glasses
He has trouble finding them
As his hand sweeps blindly across the headboard it hits the telephone and sends it crashing to the floor
He sits up with a disgusted look on his face and searches the out-of-focus shelf behind him
Suddenly  enters
You up
No
Have you seen my glasses
(shaking her head) Where'd you leave 'em
don't know
Did you look around the headboard
(wearily) Jezzie,  can't see
(she scans the shelf) Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom
She leaves and returns moments later with his glasses and a large paper bag
She tosses them both onto the bed
Thanks
(he puts on his glasses and notices the bag) What's that
Your kid dropped it off
Who
Jed
(stooping to pick up the phone) No
The little one
Eli
Why can't you remember their names
They're weird names
They're Biblical
They were prophets
Well, personally,  never went for church names
And where do you think Jezebel comes from
don't let anybody call me that
(shaking his head) You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie
Jesus, how did  ever get involved with such a ninny
You sold your soul, remember
That's what you told me
Yeah, but for what
good lay
And look what  got
The best
must have been out of my head
Jake, you are never out of your head
(ignoring the criticism and reaching for the paper bag) What's in here
Pictures
Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school
lifts the bag and pours the photographs onto the bed
There are hundreds of them
He examines them with growing delight
Look at these, will ya
don't believe it
Jesus, these are fantastic
Look, here's my Dad
And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida
Lemme see
(rummaging excitedly through the pile) Here
Look
This is me and Sarah when was still at City College
(looking closely) That's Sarah
(she studies the photo) can see what you mean
What
Why you left
What do you mean you can see
Look at her face
real bitch
She looked good then
Not to me
Well, you didn't marry her
He digs through more photos
Suddenly he stops
What's wrong
To 's surprise and his own, tears well up in his eyes
For a moment  is unable to speak
He just stares at one of the photos
looks at the picture
It is an image of  carrying a small child on his shoulders
Is that the one who died
(nodding) Gabe
is silent
grabs a Kleenex and blows his nose
(continuing) Sorry
it just took me by surprise didn't expect to see him this morning God, what  wouldn't
He was the cutest little guy
Like an angel, you know
He had this smile
(choking up again) Fuck,  don't even remember this picture
Hiding his emotions,  scrambles over the bed and reaches for a pair of pants
He pulls out his wallet and then carefully puts the photo of  inside
It joins photos of his two other boys begins shoving the remaining pictures back into the paper bag
Wait
Don't
don't like things that make you cry
just want to look
He reaches into the pile for other snapshots
We see an array of frozen moments, happy, unfocused, obscure
Suddenly he stops and stares at a yellowing snapshot
God, this is me
(he holds up a baby photo) Look
It's dated right after  was born
(he stares at it intently) What a kid
Cute, huh
So much promise
surveys the scene
It's amazing, huh Jake
Your whole life
right in front of you
(she pauses before making her final pronouncement) What a mess
- carries the garbage to an   down the hall
She is carrying several bags
Two of them are tossed instantly down the chute
She hesitates with the third
After a moment she reaches into it and pulls out a handful of photos
They are pictures of  and
With cool deliberation she drops them down the chute
An apartment door slams shut
Quickly she disposes of the pictures remaining in her hand
opens the door to the tiny room as the bag filled with the memories of his life falls to the fire below
Ready
Just gettin' rid of the garbage
and , both wearing postal uniforms, head for the
They are surprised that it has arrived promptly
reaches out and playfully sticks her tongue into 's ear
He pulls her into the They disappear, laughing, behind its closing doors
- is driving a mail truck through the crowded streets of midtown Manhattan
As he drives he is humming to himself a rendition of Al Jolson's "Sonny Boy
" stops his truck in front of a  on West 46th Street
He opens the back door and pulls a stack of boxes toward him
He lifts them with effort and slams the door with his foot
It doesn't close
He considers giving it another whack but the boxes are heavy
He turns instead and waddles toward the store
- heavyset  with a dark tan is standing behind a counter cluttered with laundry
picture of Richard Nixon is still stapled to the wall
She looks at
Where do you expect me to put those
don't have any room
She tries clearing the counter, but it doesn't help
(continuing) How 'bout over there
(she points to a table) No wait
Do me a favor
Bring 'em to the back room
They're awfully heavy
know
That's why 'm asking
waddles reluctantly toward the back of the store are hovering over piles of clothes
Steam from the pressing machines shoots into the air
(huffing and puffing) Where's Wong
That's what 'd like to know
If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired
stoops to put the boxes on the shelf
There is a snapping sound and he winces in pain
Massaging his back,  unfolds some papers for the 's signature
How was Palm Springs
Hot
Where do  sign
(pointing to the line) You got a nice tan, though
Tan
What tan
It faded on the airplane
'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask
(she looks heavenward) Two hundred dollars a night, for what
She hands  the wrong sheet
No
'll take the other one
(he takes it) Right
Well it's good to have you back
See you tomorrow, probably
If you're lucky
smiles to himself as he leaves the store
He walks carefully
His back is out
- stuck in traffic
Nothing is moving
Horns are blaring and drivers are agitated
reaches for a newspaper lying on top of his mail bags
To his shock one of the bags appears to move
Curious,  pokes at it
Instantly a terrifying figure pops out from beneath it and stares at him with a frightening glare
jumps back, stunned
It is a moment before he realizes that he is looking at an old  who has been sleeping in the truck
The man's face is covered in strange bumps
Goddamn it
What the hell
(pleading) didn't take nothin'
was just napping
Don't hit me
was cold
(lifting the man up) What the hell do you think you're doing
You can't do this
This is government property
He begins opening the door
The  begs
Don't throw me out
They're gonna get me
They'll tear me to pieces
He holds on to 's leg
tries to pull away
Come on
You can't stay here
Please
never hurt anybody when was alive
Believe me
don't belong here
gives the  a strange look and then escorts him from the truck
hundred eyes peer out of motionless cars and follow him as he leads the  to the sidewalk
pulls a dollar bill from his pocket and places it in the 's hand
The   crumples it into a ball and turns away
He has a frightened look on his face returns to the truck shaking his head
New York
He climbs into his seat and glances into his rear view mirror
He notices the  edging fearfully along the side of a building
horn honks and traffic begins moving
When  looks back the  is no longer there
- drives his mail truck into the huge     on 34th Street
His mind seems distracted
He has difficulty parking
- We see a vast room filled with hundreds of  sorting and moving mail
, carrying a bag of McDonald's hamburgers, walks stiffly through the aisles, his left hand rubbing his back
Several workers greet him and grab for his french fries
He offers them around
a conveyor belt sorting mail
hand reaches in, correcting mistakes
Suddenly a hamburger passes by
looks up and smiles
Jake
How's it going
She takes the hamburger and shrugs
(continuing) 'm going home
What's wrong
don't know
One of these days, 'm gonna see Louis
My back's killing me
Now
What about the boss
He's not gonna like it
shrugs
(continuing) Well, 'll miss riding home with you
was looking forward to it
'll be glad to avoid the crush
enjoy crushing into you
She grabs him and hugs him tightly
Gently
My back
ignores him and squeezes again
- to  in a '
He is lying on a long leather padded device that looks like an instrument of torture
, the Chiropractor, is a giant of a man, 280 pounds
He is adjusting 's spine
Come on, Jake
That didn't hurt
How do you know
know you
How come you're so tense today
What can  tell you
saw Sarah the other day
Her knee acting up
bit
What did she have to say
Turn on your right side
(he turns on his left) How about the other "right
" ( turns back) don't understand you philosphers
You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left
was absent the day they taught that in school
What did she say
Who
Sarah
Not much
She's like you that way
Two clams
No wonder your marriage didn't last
Put your hand under your head
Take a breath and then let it out
He makes a rapid adjustment pushing down on 's thigh groans
(continuing) Ah, good
Now turn to your left
She talk about the boys
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months
She told you that
(he shakes his head) Did she tell you about the $2,000 'm still paying for the orthodontist
'll bet she didn't mention that
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you
thought you said she didn't say much
She didn't
That's about all she said
Put your hand up
Good
think she still loves you
Take a breath and let it out
He makes an adjustment
screams
Loves me
She hasn't said a kind word about me in years
Right
She doesn't stop talking about you
You're always on her mind
That's love, Jake
She hates me, Louis
You should go back to her
What
She threw me out, remember
She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn
Only we didn't make it
She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office
What can  tell you, Louis
After Nam didn't want to think anymore decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos
(looking at  with affection) If it was any other brain but yours, might agree
Relax, this is going to be strong
can't relax
Wiggle your toes
wiggles his toes
At that instant,  twists 's neck rapidly
There is a loud cracking sound
- rushes at the camera yelling
found one
He's alive
He shines a flashlight into the lens creating rings and halos
- Suddenly  reappears, a halo effect still visible behind his head
God almighty
What did you do to me
had to get in there
deep adjustment
Rest a moment and let it set a bit
had this weird flash just then
What
don't know
've been having them recently
(he thinks a moment, then changes the subject) You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub
Anyone ever tell you that
Yeah
You
Every time  see you
No more Errol Flynn, okay
Your back won't take it
You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you
Louis, you're a life saver
know
- is walking down Nostrand Avenue
He is singing to himself and imitating Al Jolson
When there are gray skies,  don't mind the gray skies, as long as there's you
He hums
It is near dusk and lights are just coming on
The shop windows have a particularly garish look about them
The mannequins are dressed in inexpensive, almost tawdry, clothes and have a pathetic appearance
few shops have set up their Christmas decorations
The ornamentation seems strangely out of place; almost blasphemous
passes a street gang standing in the doorway of a local drug store
They chortle and make taunting sounds
(shaking her tits, singing) "Hey, Mr
Postman
" stops and stares at them
To their surprise, he begins to sing with them
He knows the words
They like that
It is a sweet moment
continues walking
He comes to a cross street
The light is green
He is still singing to himself and does not notice a sharging around the corner
The car is moving at full speed, heading straight toward him
walking a few steps behind yells out
Look out
turns and sees the car
He scoots out of the way but it swerves in his direction
The   calls out again
Jump
With a huge thrust,  hurls himself onto the curb as the car shoots by
Two  are peering at him from the back seat
They are laughing like madmen and shaking their heads
They do not look human yells and waves his fist, to no effect
After a moment he turns to thank the   whose scream had saved him, but he is gone
'
- and  are lying in bed
They are a sensual couple and even in quiet, reflective moments such as this, their positioning is erotic and stimulating
Both of them are nude
's hands are clasped behind his neck and he is staring mournfully at the ceiling
is lying on her side, her left leg draped across 's pelvis
Her head is propped up on her right arm while her left hand strokes the bayonet scar on 's stomach
Neither are talking
Suddenly, out of the blue,  speaks
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake
The money
Things like that
Or your wife
Why do you bring her up
'Cause she's always on your mind
When was the last time  said a word
It has nothin' to do with talkin'
She pauses for a while, long enough to suppose that the conversation is over
Then she continues
(continuing) Or maybe it's the war
closes his eyes
(continuing) It's still there, Jake
(she points to his brain) Even if you never say a word about it
You can't spend two years in Vietnam
(annoyed) What does that have to do with anything
Does it explain the barricaded subway stations
Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures
New York is filled with creatures
Everywhere
And lots of stations are closed
They're like demons, Jez
Demons, Jake
Come on
They're winos and bag ladies
Low life
That's all they are
The streets are crawling with 'em
Don't make em into somethin' they're not
(she rubs his forehead) It's the pressure, honey
That's all it is
Those guys tried to kill me tonight
They were aiming right at me
Kids on a joy ride
Happens all the time
They weren't human
Come on
What were they, Jake
doesn't answer
He turns over on his stomach
stares at his naked back and drags her fingernails down to his buttocks
Scratch marks follow in their wake
You still love me
He does not respond
'  - and  are sitting at the breakfast table
is reading the National Enquirer and chewing at her lip
Suddenly a drop of blood forms and falls onto the formica table top
Staring at it for a moment, she wipes it with her finger and then licks it with her tongue
is nursing a cup of coffee and staring out the window at the housing project across the way
The toaster pops
jumps
She gets up, butters her toast, and returns to her paper
Says here the world's comin' to an end
The battle of heaven and hell they call it
Should be quite a show; fireworks, -bombs, and everything
You believe them, Jake
doesn't answer
(continuing) Me neither
God, look at this
Two heads
Only lived two days
day for each head
Could you imagine me with two heads
We'd probably keep each other up all night - arguing and whatnot
You wanna see the picture
He does not respond
gets up and walks over to
Standing in front of him she slowly unties her robe and lets it fall apart
She is naked underneath it
Sensuously she leans forward, unbuttons his shirt, and strokes his chest
She waits for a response from him, but there is none
He sits silently, disinterested
Furious,  turns away
Grabbing the vacuum cleaner from the broom closet she angrily unravels the cord and switches it on
Breasts flash from beneath her gown as the vacuum roars back and forth across the floor
(continuing) Goddamn you son-of-a-bitch
My uncle's dogs used to treat me better than you do
At least they'd lick my toes once in a while
At least they showed some fucking interest
bangs on the wall, shouting
All right
All right
All right
peers at the courtyard eighteen stories below and watches the patterns of early morning movement
Tiny figures drift purposefully over the concrete
Suddenly the vasuum cleaner goes off
In the silence,  realizes that  is crying and turns to see her curled over the kitchen table
He walks to her side and strokes her hair
begins to sob
After a moment she looks at him with puffy eyes
You love me
He nods his head "yes
" She smiles coyly and rubs her hair like a kitten against his crotch
After a few moments she speaks
(continuing) Della's party's tonight
Why don't we go
It'll take your minf offa things
And  won't make you dance promise
Huh
(he nods his head in consent
hugs him) You still love me, Jake
He nods his head again, only heavily, as though the question exhausts him
- is in the "Mental Health Clinic" at   walking through the
It is overflowing with people
Some are handcuffed to their chairs
are with them approaches the main
He speaks nervously
'd like to speak to Dr
Carlson, please
Carlson
Is he new here
New
He's been here for years
She shrugs and looks at a log book
Not according to my charts
Do you have an appointment
(shaking his head) Look,  need to see him
know where his room is
Just give me a pass won't be long
Ten minutes
Our doctors are seen by appointment only
Damn it
was in the veteran's out- patient program
He knows me
(not happy) What's your name
Jacob Singer
She walks over to a file drawer and goes through it several times before coming back over to
'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files
Whataya mean, no record
You want me to spell it out
There's nothing here
That's ridiculous
've been coming here for years
Listen to me
'm going out of my fucking mind here need to see him
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers
There's about an hour's wait
'll be glad to take your name
Why don't you just fill out this form
Goddamn it
don't want a social worker
Carlson knows me
pounds the desk, rattling a tiny African violet and knocking the 's forms to the floor
She grunts angrily and stoops to retrieve them
Standing up her cap hits a drawer handle and slips off
-  protrude from her skull where the cap had been
's eyes lock on them like radar
He backs away
She immediately replaces her cap and breaks the spell, but her eyes glare at him with demonic intensity
, freaked, angry, turns and runs toward the "In Patient" door
Hey
You can't go in there
doesn't stop
, guarding the entrance, runs after him
charges through the interior corridors of the aging institution
, all holding hands, is moving down the hall
They break ranks as he charges by and begin to scream
Their tries to calm them down but the sight of the  increases their hysteria
They grab hold of him as he tries to get by
- dashes out of view
He runs down another corridor, wildly searching for a specific room
He finds it and rushes inside
He is surprised to find       seated in a circle
They all look up at him
Can  help you
'm looking for Dr
Carlson
Isn't this his office
The  stares at him uncomfortably
After a moment he gets up and takes  into a corner of the room
Everyone is watching them
The speaks quietly
'm so sorry
Obviously you haven't Dr
Carlson died
(stunned) Died
car accident
Jesus, Jesus
When
Last month, before Thanksgiving
How did it happen
No one knows
They say it blew up
(growing pale) Blew up
What do you mean it blew up
The  shrugs and tries to put his arm around , but he pulls away
Do you want me to get someone
No
No
It's okay
'm okay
He backs quickly to the door
As he turns to leave he realizes that all of the  in the group are watching him intently
Unsettled,  hurries back into the hallway
He is frightened and confused
Suddenly a voice calls out
turns and sees the  waiting for him
His gun is drawn
Hold it
Just hold it
Where the hell do you think you are
This is Bellevue, for God's sake
People running around here get shot
The   pokes his head out of the door and motions to the It's alright
He's okay
(nodding, reholstering his gun) Come on, get out of here
wouldn't want to interfere with the
Mail
He leads  toward the lobby
does not look back
'
- is with some at a crowded party in a small apartment is telling a bad joke and trying to hold a glass of wine at the same time
It is constantly on the verge of spilling
is fixated on it
In the background, we see  dancing and motioning for  to join her
He nods no
The , who keeps asking people if they "get it," takes 's head nodding as a sign of confusion and keeps trying to re-explain the joke
hears a strange noise and looks around
It seems to be coming from a covered bird cage
He goes over to it and lifts the cover
The is flapping its wings wildly as if trying to get out
The sound, loud and insistent, startles him
He lowers the cover
In the  , several people are gathered around , an attractive black woman who is reading palms
She sees  and calls over the music
Hey, you
Let me look at your hand
shrugs
, dancing nearby, calls out
Go on Jake
She reads 'em like a book
No, thanks
It's fun
'
is squeezing the mounds and examining the lines
What begins as a playful expression on her face turns suddenly serious
She reaches for his other hand and compares the two of them
looks over from her dancing and eyes the scene jealously
You have an unusual hand
could have told you that
You see this line here
It's your life line
Here's where you were born
And this is where you got married
You're a married man, huh
Oh oh
Nope
Divorce
See this split
She studies his life line with growing concern
tries to get 's attention
He ignores her
(continuing) You know, you got a strange line here
(examining it) It's short, huh
Short
It's ended
(laughing) Oh, terrific
It's not funny
According to this
you're already dead
(smiling) Just my luck
: Their movements are loose and getting looser
The music is strong and insistent
The smokey atmosphere disfigures the dancers and gives them a strange, distorted appearance
Suddenly  breaks from the crowd and reaches for
He pulls away
Some of the call out to him
Come on man, show your stuff
is easily intimidated
Relenting, he glares at  and nods apologetically to
It is obvious that he is embarrassed at his inadequacy on the dance floor
Come on professor
You got feet, too
tries to smile but it is pained and unconvincing
is playing with him, mimicking his movement
number of  notice and laugh, which only increases his discomfort
's taunting has a strange effect on
He grows distant and withdrawn, even though his body is still going through the motions of the dance
taps  on the shoulder
She spins around, smiling, and begins dancing with him
is left alone, dancing by himself
He looks away, uncomfortable
In the shadows a  kneels close to the floor
She seems to be urinating on the carpet
is shocked
Several  obscure his view
He turns around
stands half naked in the kitchen
cannot believe what he sees
In the next room, past ,  glimpses a terrifying image, a whose head seems to be vibrating at such enormous speed that it has lost all definition
Something about the image compels and frightens Slowly he approaches it
As he draws nearer to it the tortured image lets out a scream of such pain and unearthly terror that backs away
, laughing, grabs , spins him around, and begins dancing with him
He is totally disoriented
Hold me, baby
She takes 's arm and guides it to her back
follows his hand as it reaches the smooth skin beneath her sexy, loose fitting dress
He runs his fingers up to her shoulder blades
Then, suddenly, he recoils
Her back is a mass of shoulder blades, hundreds of strange, bony protrusions
gasps
Out of the blue,  leans into him and wiggles her tongue in his ear
, startled, jerks his head and his glasses go flying to the floor
Shit
He stoops down blindly to pick them up
Shoes just miss his fingers as he digs between dancing legs trying to recover them
Miraculously, he grabs the spectacles just before they are crushed and slips them back on
Instantly his world comes back into focus
As he stands,  is surprised to find  facing him, gyrating in wild abandon
There is a huge, satisfied smile on her face
She grabs his hand as if encouraging him to dance but it is obvious that she is dancing to her own rhythm
stares at her, confused
It takes him a moment to realize that her smile is not for him
Standing behind  is another , his hands around her waist
They are moving together, locked in erotic embrace
It appears that he is mounting her from behind
Looking down we see that the 's feet are deformed
They have a bizarre clubbed appearance and look very much like hooves
They skid and careen amidst the dancing feet
Something horrible and winglike flaps behind 's back
We cannot make out what it is, but it elicits a primal terror
Before  can react,  opens her mouth
With a roaring sound, a spiked horn erupts from her throat
It juts menacingly from between her teeth and thrusts into the air
scream out in excited approval
's face as it registers terror and disbelief
He stares at the  who are crowding around him
They have become perverse, corrupt aspects of their normal selves
grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from his head but it won't go away
The music throbs
His actions become spastic, almost delirious
is out of control
His frenzy becomes a kind of exorcism, a desperate attempt to free himself from his body and his mind as his eyes pass beyond pain
The dark walls of the fade away
- Strange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness, outlined by a bright moon that is emerging from behind a cloud
The faces are looking down and voices are speaking
He's burning up
Total delirium
That's some gash
His guts keep spilling out
Push 'em back
(
) Help me
His eyes focus on the moon
Rings of light emenate from it filling the sky with their sparkling brilliance
The rings draw us forward with a quickening intensity that grows into exhilarating speed
The rush causes them to flash stroboscopically and produces a dazzling, almost sensual, surge of color
The display is spectacular and compelling
Music can be heard in the distance, growing hard and insistent, like a heart beat
Heavy breathing accompanies the sound
The stroboscopic flashes are replaced by intense flashes of red and blue light
The music grows louder and reaches a thundering crescendo
Then silence
'
- The  reappears in all its normalcy
The neon sign is still flashing outside the window
are smiling and sweating
Cheers and applause ring out for  and  but  barely hears them
hugs him tightly
smack him on the back
You are out of your mind, man
Out of your fuckin' mind
Jake, you little devil
You never told me you could dance like that
Jezzie, what did you put in his drink
smiles while pulling  to a corner chair
He plops down
His chest is heaving and he is grabbing hold of his stomach
Hie face is frightened and distorted
You okay
wanna leave
Get me out of here
Oh, come on
It's early
(pulling  close to him, his voice filled with paranoia) Where are we
(surprised by the question) We're at Della's
Where
What do you mean
Where do you think
Where's Della
Bring her here
Why
What for
Show me Della
(confused) Hey, 'm here
eyes her with a pleading look
Annoyed,  leaves  and crosses the room
He watches her as she goes
is holding his stomach and rocking painfully
Moments later  returns with
Hiya Jake
That was some dance
(staring at her closely) Della
(feeling the strangeness) You want to see me
Well, here  am
see
What do you want
Just to see you
That's all
(a bit uncomfortable) Well, how do  look
Like Della
Suddenly  breaks out in a dense sweat and begins shaking
His entire body is convulsive
Are you feeling all right
Shit, you're burning up
Feel his forehead
(checking his forehead and cheeks) Damn, that's hot
Maybe from dancing
think you should lie down
is shaking uncontrollably
People are gathering around
(continuing) Can't you stop it
If  could stop it, 'd stop it
Is he sick
He's on fire
Let me help you
She reaches out to
Unexpectedly he recoils, jumping to his feet like a wild man
He begins to scream
Stay away from me
Don't you come near me
All of you
Go to hell
Go to hell, goddamn you
Stay away
stares at  with a confused and embarrassed look whispers to her
'll call a cab
'
- is lying in bed in his own  with a thermometer in his mouth
is pacing the floor with great agitation
've never been so mortified in my whole life
Never
Screaming like that
don't understand what's gotten into you, Jake, to make you do a thing like that
You're not acting normal
've lived with too many crazies in my life
don't want it anymore
can't handle it
'm tired of men flipping out on me
Shit, you'd think it was my fault
Well you picked me, remember that
don't need this
The  pounds on the wall
(continuing) All right
All right
jabs her finger at the wall
(continuing) If you go crazy on me you're goin' crazy by yourself
You understand
reaches for his mouth and pulls out the thermometer
She looks at it closely and then squints to see it better
What's it say
hundred and two
don't believe this
'm calling the doctor
She runs out of the room
calls after her
What does it say
(
) It's gone to the top
How high is that
(
) The numbers stop at 107
is on the phone to the doctor in the next room
begins shaking again and reaches for the extra blanket at the foot of the bed
He pulls it up around his shoulders
The whole bed vibrates with his shivering
Suddenly  rushes through the and into the
SHe turns on the bath water
What the hell are you doin'
Get your clothes off
What are you talking about
'm freezing
Get your clothes off
gives her a confused look as she rushes back to the
What'd the doctor say
(
) That you'd die on the way to the hospital
Now get into that tub
stares at her as she bursts back into the  carrying four trays of ice cubes
She hurries into the  and dumps them in the tub
(
) He's coming right over
Coming here
(
) Goddamn it
Get in here
can't stand around waiting
She rushes out of the  and pulls  out of bed
He is shaking violently and she has difficulty navigating across the room and undressing him at the same time
She maneuvers him into the next to the tub
He looks down at the ice cubes floating in the water
You're out of your mind
'm not getting in there
'd rather die
That's your decision
Look at me
'm ice cold
You're red hot, damn it
Get in there
've got to get more ice
She runs out of the room
The door to the apartment slams shut sticks his toe into the water and pulls it out again instantly
Oh Jesus
He sticks his whole foot in and grits his teeth as the ice cold water turns his foot bright red
He keeps it in as long as he can and then yanks it out, quickly wrapping it in a towel
rubs his foot vigorously to get rid of the sting and stares at the water, afraid of its pain
- is running up and down the  knocking on doors and collecting ice cubes from those who will answer
She hurries back to the  with several  behind her carrying additional ice trays
One of the  is shifting the trays in his hands to avoid the burning cold
' As  enters the ,  is sitting on the rim of the tub with the water up to his calves, shivering vigorously
can't do it
What kind of man are you
She unloads two trays into the water
Don't gimme that
Lie down
(pleading) Jezzie
My feet are throbbing
(calling out) Sam, Tony, come in here
Hey, 'm not dressed
You got nothin' we ain't seen before
and  grab hold of  who wrestles to get away
Get the hell off me
He's like a hot coal
It's for your own good, Jake
Let go of me, you sons of bitches
The   struggle with  and force him into the water winces when the water hits his arm
nearly flies out of the tub
The   fight to hold him down
screams and cries for the to let him go but they keep him flat on his back
(continuing) 'm freezing
'm freezing
Goddamn you
(his hand turning red) Sam,  can't take it
Don't you let go
Jez, get help
My hands are killing me
Help me
Help me
(to ) Here
'll do it
Take his legs
Run your hands under hot water
comes in
have some ice from the machine
Bring it in
Is he all right
He doesn't like it
don't blame him
What should  do with the ice
Pour it in
On top of him
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in
Okay
My husband's got two more bags
He's coming
They're heavy
helps her pour the ice into the water
yells
Oh God
You're killing me
Stop
- lying in a  we have not seen before
He is tossing and turning in his bed as though struggling to get out
Suddenly he sits up and looks over at the window
It is open and the shade is flapping
Cold air is blowing in and he is shivering
Damn
You and your fresh air
He jumps out of bed and goes over to the window
He pushes at the frame and it comes flying down with a loud bang
woman in the bed sits up
It is
What was that
It's freezing
'm not cold
Of course not
You have all the blankets
It must be ten degrees in here
'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape
From now on that window is closed
It's not healthy with it closed
This is healthy
'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy
He settles back into bed and pulls the covers back over to his side
He lies quietly for a moment, thinking
(continuing) What a dream  was having
was living with another woman
You know who it was
don't want to know
Jezebel, from the post office
You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party
was living with her
God, it was a nightmare
There were all these demons and  was on fire
Only  was burning from ice
Guilty thoughts
See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind
She was good in bed, though
Go to sleep
She had these real beefy thighs
Delicious
thought you said it was a nightmare
Suddenly, out of nowhere, we hear the tinkling sound of a music box enters the room, carrying a musical   in his arms
He is wearing a long -shirt nearly down to his ankles
We recognize him from his photograph
It is
Daddy, what was that noise
(surprised to see him) Gabe
(he stares curiously at his son) What are you doing
There was a bang
It was the window
It's cold
Tell your mother
Mom, it's
heard you
Go back to sleep
Will you tuck me in
(not happily) Oh
all right
She starts to rise
stops her and gets up instead
He whisks upside down and carries him into his '  - , licking his belly and tickling him all the way
laughs and snuggles into his pillow as soon as he hits the bed
, 9, and , 7, are both in bunk beds across the room
looks up
Dad
Jed
It's the middle of the night
(he kisses  and goes over to  in the lower bunk) What's up
You forgot my allowance
Your allowance
It's five
We'll talk at breakfast
Okay, but don't forget
Suddenly another voice pipes in from the top bunk
love you, Dad
smiles
What is this, a convention
love you, too, Pickles
Now go back to sleep
He turns to leave
Wait
Daddy
Now what
Don't go
Don't go
(he smiles) 'm not going anywhere
'm right here, Gabe
(he looks at his son tenderly) Come on, go back to sleep
You can still get a couple of hours
He hugs him warmly and then walks to the door
love you
There is deep emotion and seriousness in 's words
is struck by them
(continuing) Don't shut the door
nods and leaves it a tiny bit ajar
(continuing) bit more
a bit more
adjusts the opening enough to please  and make him secure
smiles and cuddles in his bed
'  - settles back into bed
turns over and gets comfortable
lies on his back facing the ceiling
He pulls the blankets up to his neck
He is overcome with feelings of sadness and longing
love you, Sarah
She smiles warmly
His eyes close and in a matter of seconds he is back asleep
- ,  and
The image of trees materializes overhead and a beautiful pink sky, just before sunrise, can be seen through the branches
It is an idyllic setting
Suddenly a strange sound can be heard in the distance, a metallic humming, growing louder
There is a scramble of feet and a sound of heavy boots moving through the tall grass
Voices can be heard
Men's voices
They're here
Thank God
Move 'em out
Bust your balls
Move it
Move it
There is an instant swell of activity
Trees and branches blur and speed by overhead
The idyllic image of moments before reveals itself as a
The  races out of a  covering and into a huge
High overhead a helicopter appears
Its blades whirl with a deafening whine
Long lines drop from its belly and dangle in mid-air leap up into the air reaching for them
The air is filled with turbulence
Tarps fly off dead bodies
hold them down
Voices yell but the words are not clear
They are filled with urgency
The  leaves the ground
The edges of the sky disappear as the helicopter's gray mass fills the frame
It grows larger and darker as the  approaches
Rivets and insignias dotting the underbelly come into view
Suddenly the stretcher begins spinning, out of control
Hands emerge from inside, reaching out to grab it
Watery, womb-like sounds rise out of nowhere, the rippling of water, a heart beating
Gradually voices can be heard mumbling; distant sounds, warm and familiar
- 's  reaches down to help him out of the tub
Surprisingly and
are standing there too
stares at them in total confusion
You are a lucky man, my friend lucky man
You must have friends in high places, that's all  can say
and  appear next to the
They are extending their hands to the
' arms, nearly blue, reach out to them
Slowly they lift him from the icy water
takes one step onto the tile and collapses to the floor
: '  - sounds of feet shuffling across the carpet
glass rattles on a tray
television is on low in the background
Slowly the opens from 's
and we see  puttering around the Suddenly she is aware that  is watching her
She smiles
Jake
(she places her hand on his head and strokes his hair) You're gonna be all right, Jake
You're gonna be fine
Am  home
You're here
Home
The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil
(she smiles) What a night, Jake
It was crazy
You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over
And talkin' to your kids
Even the dead one
Weird
You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours
Amazing, huh
Are we in Brooklyn
You're right here, Jake
You just rest
(she puffs up his pillow) The doctor said you had a virus
That's what they say when they don't know what it is
You can't do anything for a week
He says you gotta recuperate
(she strokes his forehead, and gets up) Now you just lie here
Mrs
Sandelman made you some chicken soup
It'll warm you up
leaves the room
watches her as she goes
He seems lost and confused
'  - , unshaven, wearing his bathrobe, is sitting at the
on demonology are spread out before him
He studies them to distraction
is standing by the counter making sandwiches
She wraps them in plastic Baggies and puts one in a lunch box, another in the refrigerator
She is dressed in her postal uniform
You know, you really ought to get out today
You can't just sit around like this all the time
It's not healthy
It's not good for your mind
Go take a walk, or somethin'
Go to a movie
Christ, who's gonna know
You think care
don't give a shit
Go
Enjoy yourself
One of us should be having a good time
( knocks on 's head) Hello
Anybody home
(she looks in his ear) Anybody in there
What
just stares at him
She does not respond
returns to his books
, real demons, with spindly horns and long tails
's huge finger, magnified, scans page after page of ancient images and archaic text
, enraged at his lack of attention, returns to packing her lunch box
Suddenly she spins around
Goddamn it
can't stand it anymore
've had it up to here
Go ahead and rot if you want
You son-of-a- bitch, 'm talking to you
to the
Suddenly a crashing sound catches 's attention as a   flies by his head
He looks up to see knocking pots and pans off the kitchen counter and kicking them wildly across the room
The noise is terrible
The intensity of her rage is shocking
The pots crash into every surface, knocking all his books onto the floor
And then, suddenly, she stops
stoops down to the floor and picks up her sandwich, stuffs it back in its plastic Baggie, and puts it back in her lunch box
She is about to leave when she stops and looks at
(continuing, her anger in check) made you a tuna fish sandwich
It's in the fridge
Eat a carrot with it
The aspirin's on the bottom shelf
We're out of soap so, if for some reason you decide to wash yourself again, use the dishwashing stuff
(she walks out of the room and returns with her coat) 'm sorry  yelled, but you get on my nerves
(she bends down and makes eye contact with ) Hello
Listen,  gotta go
sits on his lap, gives him a big kiss, and then, unexpectedly, raises two fingers, like horns, over her head
The gesture catches 's full attention
(continuing) Look, 'm horny
Keep it in mind
(she kisses his cheek) Love me a little
(speaking with affection) You are the most unbelievable woman have ever met
One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale
Who are you
That's what  want to know
Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up
Suddenly the telephone rings
It startles them
Oh shit
Tell 'em 've left
grabs her jacket and shoves her arm in it upside down pocketful of change falls on the floor
smiles
curses as she struggles to pick it up and get the jacket on right
gets the phone
Hello

) Jacob Singer

) Paul Gruneger
Paul Gruneger

But 'm kind of laid up here

pats  on the back
Jesus, man, you look terrific
You must have put on twenty pounds
work in a bakery
You're lucky
How many vets you know are even employed
Count 'em on one hand
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh
No joke
Fuckin' army
That goddamn war

It's not worth it
You'll never win
You tellin' me
How many times can you die, huh
looks in his rear view mirror before changing lanes
He sees a black car tagging close behind him
He pulls out
So does the car
(continuing) Still married, Jake
Nope
You and everybody else
God  hate this area
Makes me nervous
Why the hell we drivin' here
just need to talk
You can't talk in Brownsville
'm not sure where  can talk anymore
What's wrong
Let's get a couple drinks, okay
(he looks at his rear view mirror) Hey, take a look behind us
Do you think that car is followin' us
(turning to look) That black car
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor
( does) Just watch 'em
What's goin' on Paul
don't know
You in trouble
Yeah
notices 's left arm
It is shaking
The black car passes on the left
Both  and  stare at it as it speeds by
- and  are sitting in a dark booth in an obscure It is nearly empty
is leaning across the table in a very intimate fashion
Somethin's wrong, Jake
don't know what it is but  can't talk to anybody about it
figured  could with you
You always used to listen, you know
nods
takes a sip of his drink and stares deliberately into 's eyes
(continuing) 'm going to Hell
's face grows suddenly tense
(continuing) That's as straight as  can put it
And don't tell me that 'm crazy 'cause  know 'm not
'm goin' to Hell
They're comin' after me
(frightened, but holding back) Who is
They've been followin' me
They're comin' outta the walls
don't trust anyone
'm not even sure  trust you
But  gotta talk to someone
'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind
cannot contain his fear
He jumps up suddenly and walks away from the booth
follows him with his eyes but does not go after him in the next booth observes the scene with interest
He looks vaguely familiar, like we have seen him before
stares out the window for a moment and then walks over to the juke box
He pulls a quarter out of his pocket and drops it in the slot
His finger pushes a selection at random
Some '60's rock hit blares out
's mind is reeling by the time  sits back down
(continuing) Sorry
Sometimes  think 'm just gonna jump outta my skin
They're just drivin' me wild
Who, Paul
What exactly
don't know who they are, or what they are
But they're gonna get me and 'm scared, Jake
'm so scared can't do anything
can't go to my sisters
can't even go home
Why not
They're waitin' for me, that's why
's hand starts to shake
The tremor spreads rapidly to his whole body
The booth begins to rattle
(continuing) can't stop it
try
Oh God
Help me Jake
slides quickly out of his side of the booth and moves in toward He puts his arm around him and holds him tightly, offering comfort as best he can
is obviously terrified and grateful for 's gesture
few at the bar look over in their direction
It's okay, Paul
It's okay
(crying) don't know what to do
Don't do anything
( begins to relax a bit and the shaking subsides) Paul,  know what you're talking about
What do you mean
've seen them too
the demons
(staring at ) You've seen them
Everywhere, like a plague
God almighty
thought  was the only one
Me, too
had no idea
It's like was coming apart at the seams
Oh God
know
know
What is it Paul
What's happening to me
They keep telling me 'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire
(he fumbles in his coat pocket and pulls out a small Bible and silver cross) carry these everywhere but they don't help
Nothing helps
Everyone thinks 'm crazy
My mother filed a report with the army
(stunned) The army
She said  haven't been the same since then
Since that night
There's still this big hole in my brain
It's so dark in there, Jake
And these creatures
It's like they're crawling out of my brain
What happened that night
Why won't they tell us
don't know
don't know
They're monsters, Jake
We're both seein' 'em
There's gotta be a connection
Something
leans back in the booth, his mind racing
The   in the next booth is watching them with rapt attention

Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself
've seen 'em take people right off the street
used to go home a different way every night
Now can't even go home
You come home with me
What about your girlfriend
You don't think she'll mind
Are you kidding
We've put up more of her cousins
You wouldn't believe how they breed down there

It is cold outside
Christmas lights seem ludicrous dangling in the bar's front window

Merry Christmas
steps into the street and walks to the driver's side of his car
He pulls out his keys and opens the door
looks down on the sidewalk and notices a dime
Goddamn, this is my lucky day
He bends down to pick it up
inserts the key into the ignition and steps on the gas
He turns the key
Pieces of metal and flesh fly into the air sprawls out flat on the ground as the debris hurls above him
He covers his head
suffering an air bombardment
Flack is exploding all around it and the shock waves are rocking the craft violently
's eyes peer to the left
are firing rockets into the  below
pair of are huddled over him
sudden gush of arterial bleeding sends a stream of blood splattering over the inside of the windshield
The , unable to see, clears it away with his hands
screams over the roar of the chopper
One of the  presses his ear close to  to hear
Help me
We're doing the best we can
Get me out of here
- from the bar grabs  under the arms and drags him down the sidewalk
Just hold on
Where am
Who are you
The   yanks  around the corner just as another explosion consumes the car
The air is filled with flames and flying debris
The pulls  into the bar
Just lie still
You're okay
You're not hurt
The  are in a state of bedlam
Part of the wall has blown apart and bricks and glass are everywhere
The cross from around 's neck is buried in the debris
Sirens are heard in the distance speeds off down the street
looks for the   who had helped him
He is gone
- heads down Ocean Parkway
'  - and  are driving in an old Chevy Nova
They are dressed up
's face is bruised and he has a gauze pad over his ear
They drive in silence
appears very sad
Slowly his right hand reaches across the seat, seeking 's
Their fingers embrace

Cars park along the length of the narrow road

They are the  we have seen at the opening of the film, only they are older now

They carry the casket in semi-military formation to the grave

'  is with her and they seem to be having a lively, almost intimate, conversation
and his  are drinking beer
They all have a tired, defeated look about them
Did anyone see the police report
It sounds like a detonation job to me
The paper said it was electrical; a freak accident
Bullshit
Someone's covering somethin'
That was no accident
Why do you say that
Cars don't explode that way
Any simpleton knows that
But the paper
That was set
'm tellin' you
By who
Why
Paul didn't have an enemy in the world
How do you know
Hey, you're talkin' about Paul
Who'd want to hurt him
What did he talk about when you guys went out
Did he say anything
He was upset
He thought people were following him
You're kidding
Who
He didn't know
Demons
(obviously struck by the word) What do you mean, demons
He told me he was going to Hell
The statement has a surprising impact on the group
There is immediate silence and eyes averted from one another
What'd he say that for
What made him say that
Strange, huh
Strange
What else did he say, Jake
He was scared
He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork
They were tryin' to get him, he said
(his arm shaking) How long had that been going on
couple of weeks,  think
He notices 's beer can rattling
He say what they looked like
No
Not really
Excuse me a minute
'll be right back
In one end, out the other, huh George
tries to smile as he hurries to the bathroom
His arm is nearly out of control and beer is spilling on the carpet as he walks
(continuing) Still a spastic, huh
hope you can hold your dick better than you hold that can
No one laughs
There is an uncomfortable silence
- The   are walking quietly through an unpaved alley
It is already gray and getting darker
know what Paul was talking about don't know how to say this
but in a way it's a relief knowing that someone else saw them, too
You're seeing
They're not human, 'll tell you that
car tried to run over me the other day
It was aiming straight for me
saw their faces
They weren't from Brooklyn
What are you tellin' me
They're from the Bronx
It was no joke, Rod
Something weird is going on here
What is it about us
Even in Nam it was always weird
Are we all crazy or something
Yeah, ever since that
He hesitates
They all understand
What's that have to do with anything
It was bad grass
That's all it was
Grass never did that to me
You know, 've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist
Nothing penetrates that night
Nothing
It's not worth goin' over again and again
Whatever happened, happened
It's over
've seen them, too
Shit
So have
Look, there's something fucking strange going on here
You know Paul's not the only one who's died
You remember Dr
Carlson over at Bellevue
His car blew up, too
Dr
Carlson's dead
An explosion, just like Paul's
No
Jesus
You think they're connected
(he nods) think something's fucking connect- ed
mean, a car tried to run me over the other day
Doug too, right
We've got six guys here going fucking crazy
Not me, buddy
Okay, not you Rod
But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason
They're tryin' to kill us
Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on
Do you think it has something to do with
the offensive
It's got something to do with some- thing
think we've got to confront the army
If they're hiding shit from us, we better find out what it is
Come on, Professor
The army's not gonna give you any answers
You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall
Maybe that's the only way to get through
Besides, six heads'll be better than one
Not my head, buddy
Not me
'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you
We should get ourselves a lawyer
say you should get a shrink
Too late
've tried
think you're right, Jake
'm game
Me, too
You guys are fucking paranoid
It was bad grass
That's all it was
There's no such thing as demons
- , , , , , and  are sitting on plush chairs in the   of
, a red-faced man with three chins, is sucking on an ice cube
He looks at each of the men, and then spits the ice cube into an empty glass
It clinks
'm sorry, Mr
Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world
It'd break your heart
This isn't injustice, Mr
Geary
The army did something to us and we've got to find out what
The army
The army
What is it with you guys
We're not talking about a trip to the library here
This is the United States Government for God's sake
This is red tape coming out of your ass
You know what  mean
Exactly
And we need someone to cut through it
We hear you're the man
Oh yeah
What am  - Perry Mason here
stands up and grabs a bag of Cheetos from a file drawer
He chomps down a few and offers the bag to the others
There are no takers
Thirsty, he downs the ice cube and cracks it between his teeth
(continuing) Okay
'll look into it
The  are surprised and excited
Wow
Do you think we have a chance
What do you want, a fortune teller or a lawyer
'll need sworn depositions from each of you and a list of the other members of the platoon, or their survivors
Hey, this is great
'll tell you, if we find the military is implicated in any way, you could stand to recover quite a lot of money
Not that  can predict anything, but some class action suits of this kind have been awarded fairly generous judgements
That wouldn't be so bad, would it Mr
Singer
Doctor
( looks at him oddly) Ph
Ah
thought you were a mailman
am
(confused) Then why aren't you teaching
Why aren't you in a university
'm too messed up to teach
(smiling) Ah
Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they
The  all nod in agreement
- and the others exit the
They are jubilant, clasping hands and smacking each other on the back
We watch as they break up
heads for the subway
and another group hop a cab
As the cab pulls away we notice that a black car pulls out behind it
It follows them out of sight
'  - and  are making wild and unadulterated love on the kitchen floor
The wastebasket flips over
's hand splashes into the dog's bowl
Nothing impedes their passion
laughs, hollers, and swoons
Hands grab hold of table legs
Chairs topple
Feet bang wildly against the stove
It is all mayhem and ecstacy
And then it ends
's face is ecstatic
He can barely talk and simply basks in 's glow
She looks especially lovely and radiant
They lie exhausted and exhilarated on the linoleum floor
So tell me
am  still an angel
(smiling broadly) With wings
You transport me, you know that
You carry me away
kisses him softly around his face and gently probes his ear with her pinky

We're all angels, you know
(she bites his earlobe
He winces) and devils
It's just what you choose to see
love you, Jez
know
Underneath all the bullshit, just love
Remember that
You know what
feel
exorcised like the demons are gone
How come
The army
In a way
At least now  have some idea of what was happening
If we can only get them to admit
to explain what they did
don't know
Maybe it'd clear things up in my head
'll tell you something, Jez, honestly thought they were real
Silence
Suddenly  roars like a monster and scares  half to death
They laugh and tumble back to the floor

It's in the fridge

Don't drink it all
Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called
He did
When
(grabbing her coat) While you were in the shower
Why didn't you call me
He didn't give me a chance
(she pauses nervously) Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case
(stunned) What
What do you mean
He said you didn't have one
What's he talking about
don't know
That's all he said
He wasn't very friendly
Oh, yeah
He said your buddies backed down
They chickened out, he said
don't believe this
Baby, 'm sorry
feel terrible
'd stay and talk but 'm so late
Look, don't be upset
We'll talk when  get home
See you around midnight

And don't brood
Watch

- The door slams securely
The locks set
begins instantly rifling through a desk drawer
He comes up with a frayed address book and looks up a number
He dials
(
) Hello
Frank
It's Jake
Jacob SInger
We see  standing at a window fingering the Venetian blinds
He does not reply
The scene intercuts between the two men
(continuing) Listen,  just got a strange call from Geary
He said the guys backed down
What's he talking about
(fingering the Venetian blinds) That's right
We did
What does that mean, Frank
don't get it
Why
It's hard to explain
(angry) Well, try, huh
don't know if  can
It's just that war is war
Things happen
Things happen
What the fuck are you talking about
They did something to us, Frank
We have to expose this
There's nothing to expose
Jesus Christ
Who's been talking to you
(silence) What's going on
How can you just turn away
(no response) What about the others
They're not interested, Jake
Shit
You know it's not half the case if  go it alone
We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank
The army is to blame
They've done something to us
How can you not want to know
(pausing) Maybe it's not the army, Jake
What do you mean
Maybe there's a larger truth
What are you talking about
Maybe the demons are real
Goddamn it
What kind of bullshit is that
Listen, Jake
gotta go
What the hell
What kind of mumbo jumbo
'm hanging up
Hey, wait
Don't bother to call again, okay
hangs up
stands holding the phone for a long time, until the high pitched whine from the receiver reminds him it's off the hook
The sound frightens him and he slams the receiver down
QUickly tears through his address book looking for other phone numbers
They aren't there
Shit
'
hurries into the  and pulls an old shoe box from the closet
The box is filled with yellowing army papers, dog tags, and photos of old comrades
Beneath his discharge papers he finds a sheet scribbled with the names and addresses of platoon buddies
grabs it
Then his eyes fall on the frayed remains of an old letter
He picks it up and unfolds it with great care
The letter is written in a child's handwriting

is running alongside him, holding onto the seat
Plastic streamers trail from the handlebars
is a bit wobbly, but determined
After a couple of false starts,  lets go and  is riding by himself
For an instant,  looks back at his father with a huge grin on his face
is grinning, too
as he pulls away from us and heads into the distance
: '
- swallows hard as he stands there, holding the letter
Suddenly his eyes lift off the page and glance at a full length mirror mounted on the bedroom door
Something in the mirror, like the image of a child, seems to move
He looks over
There is nothing there
Curious, walks toward the mirror
As his image appears, he gasps and stops moving
To his horror and ours, it is his own back that is reflected in the mirror
The impossibility of the moment startles him
He lifts his hand
The reflection moves with him
Frightened but defiant, moves toward the mirror
The image in the mirror spins around
It is the     he saw at the party with
An unearthly scream comes from both their mouths
- huge wooden door slams open
charges through it
He is chasing his lawyer,  , through a crowded court house corridor
, sweaty and unshaven, is cradling a Coke in one hand, a sandwich and a briefcase in the other
His stomach bounces wildly as he walks
Geary
Mr
Geary
Listen, goddamn it
You can't just walk away from this
keeps walking
catches up to him
(continuing) Who's been talking to you
The army
Have they been talking to you, huh
Nobody's been talking to nobody
You don't have a case, you hear me
It's pure and simple
Now leave me alone
Okay
grabs the back of 's jacket and pulls him up short
(continuing) Take your hands off me
lets go
He stares into 's eyes
Listen, will you listen
They're trying to get me
They're comin' out of the walls
The army's done something to me
need you
You need
a doctor
doctor
And what's he gonna do, tell me 'm crazy
They've fucked with my head
've got to prove it
You've got to do something
gives  a pitiful look
There's nothing  can do
He turns and walks away
stands there a moment, and then rushes after him
is biting into his sandwich
Mayonnaise spills onto his hand
He licks it with his tongue catches up to him
You mind
'm eating, huh
Something's going on here
You're not telling me something
What the hell's gotten into you
'll tell you what's gotten into me
don't know you from Adam, right
You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand  look into it
Okay
said 'd check it out and did
Now  don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and  don't like it
Used you
talked to the Army's Bureau of Records
You've never even been to Viet Nam
What the hell is that supposed to mean
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand
(stunned) War games
Thailand
That's not true
How can you believe that
Can't you see what they're doing
It's all a lie
We were in Da Nang, for God's sake
You've got to believe me
don't have to do any such thing
'm eating my lunch, okay
takes a swig of his  and begins walking away
, enraged, charges after him
With a wild swipe he sends the   shooting out of 's hand
It reverberates down the corridor
is stunned
You slimy bastard
You goddamn piece of shit
With a powerful thrust,  rips the sandwich from 's other hand
Tossing it on the floor, he grinds his heel in it
Tomato and mayonnaise squirt onto 's shoe
turns away
walking down the    to the elevators
There is a look of satisfaction on his face
He picks up a telephone and dials
Someone comes on the line
speaks quietly
He's on his way
stepping onto the elevator
The doors close
The Muzak is playing "Sonny Boy" with Al Jolson singing
is surprised to hear it
He presses the down button for the main floor
The elevator stops at the
The doors open swiftly are standing there
They approach
1 Let's go, Singer
is shocked to see them
He tries to get away but two of the yank him toward the  doors
2 You're coming with us
- is hustled to a waiting car and shoved inside, in between two officious looking
The doors lock from the 's command
#1 Mr
Singer
What an appropriate name for a man who can't keep his mouth shut
The car drives off
Who are you
What do you want
#2 We've been watching you for a long time
You and your friends
You've been exhibiting some very odd behavior
Frightening people with foolish talk about demons - and experiments
tries to speak but the other  grabs his mouth
#1 You're in over your head, Mr
Singer
Men drown that way
The army was another part of your life
Forget it
It is dead and buried
Let it lie
#2 hope we have made our point, Mr
Singer
stares at the men for a moment and then goes totally berserk
Letting out a howl, he begins pounding and thrashing like a madman
He is totally out of control
With a wild leap, he grabs for the door handle
The door flies open
It flaps back and forth, slamming into parked cars
tries to jump out, but the men yank him back in
One of them pulls out a gun sees it and goes crazy
His feet kick in all directions, slamming the 's nose into the steering wheel and shattering the side window
The car careens around a corner sending the gun flying to the floor
The men dive for it
It lodges beneath the seat
In the mayhem, throws himself out of the flapping door and sprawls onto the pavement
People look down at him as the car speeds away
- grabs his back
He is in excruciating pain
He tries to get up, but can't move
He reaches out to people passing by, but they ignore him and hurry past
has been watching the entire scene
After a moment's consideration he leaves his post and ambles over to
He leans down and steals his wallet
Merry Christmas
- as an  races through the streets
- rushes  to a
He's been screaming like a madman
You better get something in him
(approaching ) Hi

Can you tell me what happened
My back

They said he slipped on the ice
May have hit his head
Does he have any identification
No waller
Nothing
They stole it

Who's Louis
He's out of it
'm taking him down to -ray
An  pushes the gurney through a pair of sliding doors tries to get up but the pain keeps him immobilized
- begins a journey down what appears to be an endless series of corridors
The wheels of the gurney turn with a hypnotic regularity
The smooth tile floor gives way to roguh cement
The 's feet plod through pools of blood that coagulate in cracks and crevices along the way
The surface grows rougher, the wheels more insistent
Body parts and human bile splash against the walls as the gurney moves faster
Where are you taking me
Where am
You know where you are
, panicked, tries again to get up but to no effect
He glances to the side and sees mournful  being led into dark rooms
No one fights or struggles
We hear muffled screams from behind closed doors
Occasionally he glances inside the rooms and sees mangled bodies in strange contraptions, people in rusty iron lungs, and hanging from metal cages
Dark eyes peer out in horror
In one room a baseboard heater bursts into flame
No one seems concerned
door opens bicycle with plastic streamers on the handlebars lies crushed and mangled
One of its wheels is still spinning
cries out but it is not his voice we hear
Rather it is a familiar unearthly roar
His whole body stiffens
As he rounds the corner he sees a figure, its head vibrating in endless terror
it is the same image he has seen before
screams
- is wheeled into a tiny
numer of "" are waiting
As they draw closer  notices that something about them is not right
They bear a subtle resemblance to Bosch-like , creatures of another world
tries to sit up but winces in pain
He cannot move
He tries to scream but no sound comes out
Chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling
They are lowered and attached with speed and efficiency to 's arms and legs
He screams
Oh God
The "" laugh
There is the sound of a huge door closing is left in semi-darkness
Suddenly a new group of "" emerges from the shadows
They are carrying sharp surgical instruments
They surround , their eyes glistening as bright as their blades is panting and sweating in fear
One of the "" leans over
He gasps with horror
It is
She pays no attention to him
He stares at her, As it gets to her foot we see it is a decaying mass, swarming with maggots
The "" laugh
They take great pleasure in his suffering
Their voices are strange and not human
Each utterance contains a multitude of contradictory tones, sincere and compassionate, taunting and mocking at the same time
The confusion of meanings is a torment of its own
(continuing) Get me out of here
"" Where do you want to go
Take me home
"" Home
(they all laugh) This is your home
You're dead
Dead
No
just hurt my back
'm not dead
"" What are you then
'm alive
"" Then what are you doing here

"" What isn't happening
Let me out of here
"" There is no out of here
You've been killed
Don't you remember
"" approaches
As he turns, we notice with horror that he has no eyes or eye sockets
He extracts a long needle from his belt and positions it over 's head
Like a divining rod it locates a particular point near the crown of his head
With a powerful thrust the "" shoves the needle into 's skull and pushes it slowly into his brain
howls
- and a replay of flashes of the opening sequence of the film
with bayonets are charging over rice paddies in the dark of the night
charges at  with a long bayonet blade and jams it into his intestines
cries out
- ""
"" Remember
No
That was years ago
've lived years since then
"" It's all been a dream
No
The army did this to me
They've done something to my brain

Sarah
'm not dead
want my family
The "" laugh and back away, disappearing into the darkness
- Suddenly a fluorescent light flashes overhead materialize instantaneously around him
enters the room followed by , , and
They approach  who is lying in traction, suspended over a hospital bed
He's still pretty doped up
don't think he'll be able to talk yet and doubt that he'll recognize you
just want to see him
(eating a Snickers bar) Dad
Hi
It's us
We just found out
You look terrible
Does that hurt
'll be outside if you need me
Jake
It's me
We heard what happened
(his voice hoarse, nearly whispering) 'm not dead
am not dead
No
Of course you're not
You've just hurt your back
That's all
You're going to be fine
It'll just take some time
month, they said
(trying to joke) You just hang in there, Dad
(smacking him) That's not funny
(she reaches over and rubs 's brow) What a mess, huh
God  wish there was something  could do
love you, Jacob
For whatever that's worth do
There is a sudden sound of "" laughing
jerks his head painfully, but does not see them
"" (
) Dream on
(yelling at the unseen voice) No
Oh God
Jacob, what can  do
Save me
's plea confuses
She responds with a kiss

He is still in traction and looks very uncomfortable
new  enters holding a plastic container with a straw poking out
Well, don't we look better this morning
That was a hard night, wasn't it
Where am
Lennox Hospital
'm awake
You look awake to me
Here
(she holds the straw to his lips) Drink some of this
(staring at her intently) Where's Sarah
Where did she go
(the  gives him a strange look) She was here
No
No
You haven't had any visitors
That's a lie
My family was here
'm sorry
Last night
They were as real as you are
The  smiles and nods in appeasement
This is not a dream
This is my life
Of course it is
What else could it be
She giggles nervously
There is a funny glint in her eyes

He doesn't want to see it
- There is a loud commotion in the
We see  , 's chiropractor, screaming 's name

Jacob Singer

Louis

In here

You're going to have to leave
stares furiously at  stretched out on the traction apparatus
He begins to yell
Good God, Jake
What have they done
(he examines  and screams at the ) What is this, the Middle Ages
And they call this modern medicine
This is barbaric
Barbaric
(turning to ) It's okay, Jake
It's not serious
'll get you out of here
(yelling at the ) What is this, the Inquisition
Why don't you just burn him at the stake and put him out of his misery
charges over to the traction equipment and begins working the pulleys that suspend  over the bed
The  and become instantly hysterical and start screaming
What the hell do you think
Don't you come near me
2 You can't do that
What is this, a prison
Stay back
1 You can't
Call the police
One of the  lunges at  who swings back at him with one of the pulley chains
It just misses
(to the ) You take one step and 'll wrap this around your neck
lowers  into a wheelchair while holding the others at bay
(continuing) Hold on, Jake, we're getting out of here
and  part as he pushes him quickly from the room
- helps  over to an adjusting table in a room that, compared with the hospital, is comfortable and serene
He pushes a lever and the table rises to a vertical position
leans against it and rides it down to a horizontal position
Every moment is agony for him
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself
Mark my words
( barely hears them) Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you
(nearly whispering) Am  dead, Louis
( leans over to hear) Am  dead
(smiling) From a slipped disc
That'd be a first
was in Hell
've been there
It's horrible
don't want to die, Louis
Well, 'll see what  can do about it
've seen it
It's all pain
(working on 's spine like a master mechanic) You ever read Meister Eckart
( shakes his head "no") How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart
( takes hold of 's legs and yanks them swiftly) Good
Okay, let's turn over gently
Right side
turns to his left
shakes his head in dismay
The other "right," okay
(he helps  turn over) You're a regular basket case, you know that
(he moves 's arm over his head) Eckart saw Hell, too
positions 's other arm, bends his legs, and then pushes down on his thigh
His spine moves with a cracking sound
groans
(continuing) You know what he said
The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of your life; your memories, your attachments
They burn 'em all away
But they're not punish- ing you, he said
They're freeing your soul
Okay, other side
He helps  and repositions him
Again he pushes and the spine cracks
(continuing) Wonderful
So the way he sees it, if you're frightened of dying and hold- ing on, you'll see devils tearing your life away
But if you've made your peace then the devils are really angels freeing you from the earth
It's just a matter of how you look at it, that's all
So don't worry, okay
Relax
Wiggle your toes
's toes dance as  gives him a quick, unexpected jab to the lower vertebrae in his back
(continuing) Perfect
We got it
( pushes a lever and the table rises back up) Okay
Let's just give it a little try
See if you can stand
What
By myself
You can do it
Come on
Easy
Just give it a try
steps cautiously away from the table
He moves hesitantly, with deliberate restraint
encourages him like a faith healer coaxing the lame
His first steps have an aura of the miraculous about them
walks slowly, without help
smiles impishly
He looks like a giant cherub
Hallelujah
puts his arm around him
Then  tries again, gradually rediscovering his balance and strength
With each step his confidence returns
is pleased
Then, suddenly, without warning,  turns and heads toward the door
What are you doing
There's something 've gotta take care of, Louis
What are you talking about
You can barely stand
'm walking, aren't
Jake, you need to rest
Not tonight, Louis
No more rest
He walks slowly out the door
starts to go after him
turns around and shakes his head "no
" The look on his face is firm and defiant
stands back and lets him go
love you, Louis
- and a fire engine racing through the streets of lower
is forming
Banks of lights and television cameras amass in the cold night air
Police cars and mobile units rush to the scene
In one hand he is holding a brightly lit torch
In the other he is holding a container of gasoline and pouring it on the steps of the
The volatile liquid splashes against his pants and shoes and runs down the pavement
five gallon container lies emptying nearby
Gasoline belches from it insistently and pours onto the street
Bystanders back away as the gasoline snakes toward them
Television cameras and microphones are pointing in 's direction, but at a safe distance
He is yelling at them, his teeth chattering from the cold
Listen to me
There were four companies in our batallion
Five hundred men
Seven of us were left when it was over
Seven
Four companies engaged in an enemy offensive that not one of us who survived can remember fighting
Use the torch
Shut up
Let him talk
are arriving at the scene
ready hoses at nearby hydrants
are rolling
(shouting) You don't forget a battle where 500 men were killed
They did something to us
want to know the truth, the goddamn truth
We have a right to know
(he yells toward the cameras) Are you getting all this
want this on national
want the whole country, the whole world to know
He holds up the torch
loudspeaker blares through the crowd
Throw that torch away, young man
Give yourself up
You're under arrest
For what
For seeking the truth
Please come quietly
You come near me and 'll blow us all up
We're not going to hurt you
Give him a chance to talk
The army will deny it
They've falsified my records
They've lied to my lawyer, threatened my buddies
But they can't threaten me
You tell 'em
Use the torch
Okay, let's clear the area
Everyone out
Suddenly a lighted match flies in 's direction
is enraged
He brandishes the torch at the crowd
What the fuck do you think you're doing
Another match hurls toward him and dies in mid-air
on the fringe of the crowd begin to run
does not move
Clear the area
This is an order
What is wrong with you
We hear laughter from  in the crowd
As  looks out into some of their eyes he sees demons looking back
One of them throws another match
Crazed,  runs toward them
jump back
Suddenly  freezes
Standing on the sidelines, he sees one of the who trapped him in the car
He is reaching for a gun
, stunned, yells at the top of hhis lungs
With a defiant roar, he hurls the torch straight up into the air
We see it from high above the crowd spinning higher and higher
All eyes stare upward watching it in a kind of wonder
Then, reaching its apex, just below the camera, it begins its descent
The eyes of the crowd turn to fear
yells
He'll burn us all
Screams fill the air as  scramble to escape the potential conflagration
Only  remains motionless, standing silently, almost heroically, in the middle of it all
Suddenly the torch hits the ground and a pool of gasoline ignites with a blinding flare that sends flames shooting in all directions panic
and  run for their lives
The run, too
The flames travel toward the Army Headquarters and rush along the curb
Water hoses are trying to douse them as they spread
, surprisingly untouched by the fire, walks slowly through the frightened crowds, as if in a daze
Viewed through the flames the scene momentarily resembles a vision of Hell
'
- , stark naked and covered with goose bumps, runs his hands under a shower spray
The water is freezing and taking forever to warm up
Anxious, he dashes past his gasoline drenched clothes, grabs a suitcase from the  closet, and stuffs it with clothes
Then he hurries back to the shower, tests it, and jumps in
Lather covers 's hair and hangs over his tightly closed eyes
His entire body is covered in suds
He is washing as quickly as he can
Suddenly he hears a noise as someone enters the
He tenses
Who's there
Who is it
struggles to rinse the soap from his eyes
They are burning
There is a shadow behind the curtain
(continuing) Goddamn it
Who's there
rubs his eyes, fighting to see
Suddenly the shower curtain is thrown back
backs against the wall
hand reaches in and pulls his nipple, pinching hard
It's just me
Jezzie
Who else were you expecting
Let go
Where were you, Jake
Where've you been
Why haven't you called
Stay away from me, Jez
want to know
You tell me
You wanna know
Turn on the
Watch the fucking news
He pushes her away and jumps out of the shower
dressing and piling the last of his clothes into his suitcase
, in a robe, is watching him
Why are you doing this to me
You can't just go away like that
can do anything  want
She stares at him with confusion
Don't
It might be for me
'm not here
You haven't seen me
(picking up the receiver) Hello
No
He's not here haven't seen him all night don't know when
What
Tell him what
( looks up) Vietnam
What experiments
lunges for the phone
Hello
This is Jacob Singer
(he listens with growing fascination) God almighty
Yes
Yes
Right
Where would you like to meet
(he listens) How will  know you
( seems uncomfortable) Okay
'll be there
He hangs up the phone and stands silently for a moment
Who was that
chemist
Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon
He said he knows me and that 'll know him when  see him
How
have no idea
(he thinks) was right
There were experiments
knew it
knew it
My God
How do you know he's telling the truth
stares at  for several moments but does not respond
The 11:00  is coming on
's image can be seen on the screen
We hear the  speaking
Leading the news tonight, a bizarre demonstration on the steps of the Army Recruiting Headquarters, in downtown Manhattan
Jacob Singer, an alleged Vietnam vet
Alleged
Alleged
challenged the United States Army to admit conducting secret experi- ments involving hundreds of American soldiers during the Vietnam war
stares at the
, dumbfounded
takes his suitcase and hurries to the front door
He opens it a crack and peers into the hallway
runs after him
(almost threatening) Don't leave me, Jake
- gazes at  for a moment and then hurries down the
He stops at the stairwell and looks back
is still standing there
She is very angry
just stares at her for a moment and then disappears down the stairwell
- is standing near the
in black leather jackets are crusing the area and look at  with curiosity
One  in particular cruises by several times and then approaches him
Jacob
Hi
'm Michael Newman
Friends call me Mike
is startled when he sees him
He is the same   who has appeared throughout the film, assisting  in moments of crisis
(continuing) Surprised, huh
told you you'd know me
've been tracking you for a long time
just wish 'd spoken to you before tonight
don't get it
Who are you
Why have you been following me
Observation, mainly
Clinical study
You were one of the survivors
passes them on the street
grabs 's shoulder and turns him away nervously
(continuing) Come on, we're not safe around here
- and  are sitting on a deserted    that juts into the Hudson River
is wide-eyed as he listens to 's story
So first 'm arrested, right
Best ever made, right down the drain
figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if 'm lucky
That was '68
Long time ago
(nodding his head) Next thing  know 'm on Rikers Island
Ever been there
( shakes his head) Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know
Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side
They tell me if 'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean
Well, 'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and  already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse
Shows how much you knew
No shit
They had me by the balls
Next thing  know 'm in Saigon
in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs
Not the street stuff mind you
They had us isolating special properties
The dark side, you know
They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies
Yeah, sure
We were losing the war
Right
They were worried
They figured you guys were too soft
They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know
And we did it
The most powerful thing  ever saw
Even a bad trip, and  had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder
The Ladder
That's what they called it
fast trip right down the ladder
(he makes a downward dive with his hand) Right to the primal fear, the base anger
'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff
But  don't need to tell you
You know
can barely catch his breath, the information he is receiving is so powerful to his mind
(continuing) We did experiments on jungle monkeys
They bashed each other's heads in, gouged out their eyes, chewed off their tails
The brass loved it
Then they made us try it on Charlie
(he pauses) They took these 's, just kids really, and put 'em in a courtyard
We fed 'em huge doses of the stuff
(he stops for a moment; a tear rolls down his cheek) They were worse than the monkeys never knew men could do such things
The whole thing still blows me away
stands up and begins walking in circles around the
, astounded, gets up and walks beside him
(continuing) Anyway, this big offensive was coming up
Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley
And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win
Morale was down
It was gettin' ugly in the States
Hell, you remember
Like it was yesterday
couple days later they decided to use the Ladder, on one test battalion
Yours
Just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field
They were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive
And you did, too
But not the way they tnought
is beginning to shake
pulls a container of pills out of his jacket pocket
(continuing) Hey, want something to calm you down
Made 'em myself
shakes his head no
None of us can remember that night get flashes of it but they don't make sense
We saw shrinks for years
But nothing they did could ever touch it
What happened
Was there ever an offensive
couple of days later
It was fierce
You guys never saw it
But there was an attack
can still see them coming
There was a fight, wasn't there
Yeah
But not with the Cong
Who then
He hesitates, obviously uncomfortable
His eyes grow puffy
He looks at the river for a moment and then turns to
You killed each other
's mouth drops open
The words hit him like a truck
- Gunfire explodes in the darkening sky
We are in Vietnam
is at the bottom of a trench fighting with
Chaos surrounds them
Men are screaming
The  is storming at them from the rear
raises his bayonet and jams it into the belly of his
It is only after a series of jabs that he sees it's another American he's killed
's eyes go blank with confusion and terror
Oh my God
'
looks up from the trench and sees a continuing wave of bearing down on them
jumps up, knocking  to the ground and slamming his rifle into 's back
As he spins around sees another  charging at him
His bayonet is aimed at 's stomach
For the first time  remembers the face of his attacker
He is a  , about 19 years old, clean cut, wearing glasses
The two men stare at each other in terrible confusion
It seems like a moment out of time
And then the  lurches forward and rams his bayonet deep into 's abdomen
is ashen-faced
It was brother against brother
No discrimination
You tore each other to pieces
knew it would happen warned them
But  was just a hippie chemist, right
Jesus
And  helped 'em make the stuff talked to the guys who bagged the bodies
They're in worse shape than you, believe me
They saw what was left
It's a blessing you don't remember
Of course the brass covered the whole thing up right away
Blamed it all on a surprise attack
he pauses) needed to find you
The Ladder was my baby
Tears start flowing down 's face
He wipes them with his sleeve
It takes him a moment to regain his composure
is shivering
takes off his jacket, drapes it over , and leads him to the wooden planks overhanging the water
They sit and gaze at the in pre-dawn light
always suspected the effects might come back
That's why  had to follow you
had a hell of a time getting hold of your records
If you knew, why didn't you say anything
The truth can kill, my friend
Five hundred men died out there
This isn't a story they'd ever want out
When Paul's car blew up  realized the scope of the thing
knew they meant business
So why tell me now
Because  can get rid of the demons
can block the Ladder
have an antidote
We can kill them off, chemically speaking
They'll all disappear
It's chemistry, my friend
know
created it
Come with me can help
- and  enter a sleazy  near the docks, obviously frequented by a gay clientele
is uncomfortable as they check in
, however, seems to know the ropes
They go to a small room
You come here often
Sometimes
When it's convenient
How do  know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something
Hey, 'm not the problem
You've got bigger problems than me
reaches into his pocket and casually extracts a vial
(continuing) came up with the formula back in Nam but  never got a chance to use it
Never
'd hoped 'd never have to
Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue
What is it
Don't worry
Take it
It'll free your head
Come on
(fearful) don't know
"Yea though  walk through the valley of the shadow of death  shall fear no evil," but no one ever said wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh
( smiles, his mouth open) Stick out your tongue
( obeys as an eyedropper deposits a drop of liquid on the back of his tongue) That'a boy
Now why don't you just lie down and relax
One drop
It's strong stuff
stretches out on the bed
He stares up at the ceiling and examines its pock-marked lunar look
Long cracks and shallow craters erode the surface
It is an alien terrain
think 'm falling asleep
Pleasant dreams
The words send a jolt through 's body
He tries to get up but can't
He's frightened
can't move
Just relax
What's happening
Help me
The ceiling begins to rumble
Cracks split wide open
Huge crevasses tear through the plaster
's world is crumbling
He stares in horror as   attempt to surge through the rupture above him
Piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the darkness
Hooved feet and pointed claws clamor to break through
(continuing) Instantly  appears standing over him
He is holding the vial with the antidote
He draws an eyedropper full of the fluid and holds it over 's mouth
Take it
fights him, but  forces the entire contents of the eyedropper down his throat
gags
He tries to spit it out, but can't
Suddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks break off and collide like continental plates
The collisons wreak havoc on the , chopping and dismembering them
Body parts fall from the ceiling like a Devil's rain
Horrible screams echo from the other side
(continuing) Don't fight it
It's your own mind
It's your own fears
Flashes of light and dark storm over 's head, thundering like a war in the heavens
It is a scene of raw power and growing catastrophe
It builds in fury and rage until suddenly the ceiling explodes
's eyes stare into the formlessness expanding around him
All space is becoming a dark liquid void
Gradually the liquid grows bluer, clearer
There is an undulating sense to the imagery, a feeling of womb-like comfort
Strange lights appear and sparkle before us like sunlight on the ocean
is rushing upward, toward the surface
With the delirious sound of water giving way to air,  breaks through
To his amazement, he finds himself floating out-stretched on shimmering sunlit water
Above him are clouds of such wondrous beauty that they cannot possibly be of the earth
Pillars of golden light reach down from the heavens creating a cathedral of light
It is a vision of heaven, a vast, almost mythic paradise
is awed
sudden movement catches his attention
He looks over and sees standing before him
Only  looks different
His face seems to radiate an inner light, a transcendental beauty
is nearly blinded by his presence and must shield his eyes to look at him
So, how you doin'
The casualness of the words catches  by surprise
He sits up
To his shock and amazement, he finds that he is back in
is standing at the foot of the bed
is totally disoriented
His eyes move slowly around the room, taking everything in
He doesn't speak
(continuing) It was better than you expected, huh
just stares at him for a while and then suddenly begins to laugh
It is a huge laugh, full of energy and life
(continuing) And no more demons
told you they'd be gone
don't believe this
It's a miracle, Michael
miracle
Better living through chemistry, that's my motto
- and  are walking through the
It is early  and the sidewalks are bustling with stares into their faces and beams when they smile back
enjoys 's happiness
- and  walk through
It was paradise, Michael
You showed it to me
You were there
Well that's good to know
Mike, it was real
It was glorious
Glorious
'm not surprised
fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven
'm just glad you came back
would have stayed there if  could
'm sure
You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here
He points to two  on the far side of the
(taking 's arm) Come on
- The   head up to   and stop in front of the Reaching into his wallet,  pulls out a huge stack of credit cards and hands one to
Here
've got every credit card ever printed
Take this
Stay here till you can arrange to get away
It's on me
No
couldn't
What
You want the Plaza
Don't be foolish
Here
Take this, too
(he pulls out a business card) This is my place on Prince Street
It's got my phone, everything
Call if you need me
but you won't
Everything's gonna work out
You just get outta town as fast as you can
The New York police can be effective when they want to be
don't know what to say
Save the words
Just send back my credit card
laughs, hugs , and walks away
- is in a lovely   overlooking
He is sprawled out happily on the bed when there is a knock at the door
He jumps up and opens it
is standing there
She looks at quizzically
He smiles and takes her in his arms, swinging her into the room
What are you doing here
Are you all right
How do you expect to pay for this
( smiles) Everyone's looking for you, Jake dodged people all over the place, reporters, police
don't know what you're gonna do
'm gonna make love to you
That's what 'm gonna do
Are you out of your mind
Yep
Finally
love you, Jez
God,  can't keep up with all your changes
Me neither
What's gotten into you
grins
and  lying in bed gently caressing one another
For all his ardor  is exhausted from the events of the preceding day
While stroking 's hair he begins to fall asleep
crawls on top of him and shoves her hand down his pants
smiles
and  making love
: and  lying in front of the
watching a romantic movie
snuggles up to
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back
It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next
tell you, it was so wonderful felt like a little boy
saw Paradise, Jezzie
It's so hard to believe
There is a knock at the door
throws on a bathrobe
jumps under the sheets
Who's there
(
) It's your dinner, sir
's eyes brighten
opens the door
wheels in a table set for dinner
He sets it in a corner of the room
jumps out of bed, runs to the table, sniffs at the food, and squeals excitedly
This is one of my dreams, Jake
Ever since  was a little girl
never thought it would happen
Stick with me, kid
smiles
: to  and  sitting next to a large window overlooking They are sipping champagne
want to go with you, Jake
Wherever you go
It's not practical, Jez
It'll be hard enough alone
can waitress
'm good
No
Things are too hot
Later
'll send for you
Bullshit
promise
Please
No
'm a marked man, Jez
'm the only one left
don't want to expose you to that
It's not right for you or me
Be reasonable
Reasonable
Reasonable
Jake
You're gettin' me angry
love you when you're angry
Oh yeah
(her eyes twinkle suggestively) Try leavin' without me
laughs

Unexpectedly she grabs  and pushes him onto the bed
In seconds they are all over each other, their clothes flying in all directions
They seem as happy as could be

While he is waiting  notices a  looking at him
The stare unsettles him
The  hands  his ticket
He takes it and hurries into the
Looking back he notices the  is following him
'  - enters the '
He hurries into one of the stalsls, drops his pants, and sits
He eyes the graffiti on the walls and then notices a wad of tissue stuffed into a hole between him and the next stall
It is moving
Suddenly the tissue falls to the floor
glances at the hole curiously and leans forward to examine it
He is shocked to see an eye staring back at him
Goddamn it
(he covers it with his hand
pencil jabs his palm
He yells) Fucking pervert
Two lips form around the hole
tongue wags obscenely
Dream on
(shocked) What
The mouth is gone
hears the stall door fly open and feet running from the room
He jumps up and grabs his pants
He dashes out of the '
He hears footsteps and chases after them
- bursts into the
He sees someone rushing toward the main doors and speeds after him
, huddling along the corridors, watch as they run past
Escaping to the street, the disappears in the holiday throngs
, crazed, stands gasping for breath
His fists dig into his coat pocket
Suddenly he feels something and seems surprised when 's  emerges in his hands
- runs up the stairs in a
It is a dingy, industrial staircase, poorly lit
He reaches a door with 's name painted on it in large black letters
He knocks loudly
There is no answer
He pounds on it
Another door opens on the floor above
head sticks out
You lookin' for Mike
(panting hard) Where is he
Don't know
Hasn't picked his mail up in days
It's not like him
has a frenzied look in his eyes
He searches around the staircase and sees a pile of lumber stacked in a corner
He grabs a two-by-four and lunges at the door
What the hell are you doing
doesn't answer
He smashes wildly at the door until the lock flies open
'  - charges into the dark space groping for a light
He finds it
The is a disaster area
Nothing is standing
runs from room to room
In the back he discovers a large private chemistry lab
Glass vials and bottles are shattered on the floor
rifles through the cabinets
few bottles are intact but their labels mean nothing to him
He reaches for one cabinet and notices a reddish liquid oozing out from the bottom
He opens it
's severed head stares him in the face
It is smiling
scream rings out as the  from upstairs sees what  has seen
jumps back, trips, and falls over 's headless body
It is lying sprawled across the floor
Oh my God
stumbles to pull himself up
He is in a state of unrelieved panic
He runs past the  and spills out the doorr
He takes two and three stairs at a time, nearly flying to the street
- rushes into the icy air and runs wildly down the sidewalk as fast as his legs will move
With unexpected violence he charges into the side of a building
Over and over he hurls himself against it
He grabs for the bricks
His fingers insert themselves into the crevices
It is as though he is trying to merge with the wall
Suddenly  turns and dashes into the street
taxi is speeding toward him, its lights the only sign of life and warmth in the dark night
steps into its path
It is hard to tell if he is trying to stop the cab or waiting to be hit
The taxi screeches to a halt stares at it a moment and then steps to get in
The  tries to pull off but  yanks at the door and drags himself inside
- Rain is beginning to fall
It streaks the windows
(barely audible) 'm going to Brooklyn
Sorry, Mac
Not with me you're not get lost in Brooklyn
know the way
reaches into his pants pocket, pulls out a twenty dollar bill, and hands it to the
He takes it
(continuing) Look, this is all the money 've got in the world
Take me home and it's yours
Where's your home
heading down  , approaching the , crossing the  , and driving through dark 's face passes in and out of dense shadows
Every time he is bathed in light his image seems to alter
Something in him is falling away
'   - gets out of the  and approaches the  of ' is greeted by the
Dr
Singer
It's been a long time
(greeting him warmly) Hello, Sam
(noticing 's battered condition) Are you all right
'm okay
Do you want some help
can call upstairs
No, don't
But thanks
- stops in front of the  door and reaches his hand underneath a section of the hallway carpet
It comes back with a key
He inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door
He calls out
Hello
It's me
'  - Some lights are on
The  looks comfortable and cozy
Hello
Is anybody home
Jed
Eli
Daddy's here
There is still no answer
is surprised
He peers into the dark and then walks to the
No one is around
photo of , ,    is sitting on the counter
He picks it up and carries it with him through the apartment
He walks into his old and then into the '
The beds are still unmade
There is no one home
He sees his image in the  mirror and turns away in disgust
He walks back to the
He is about to switch the lights on when he hears footsteps coming down the hall
He calls out
Sarah, is that you
hope you don't mind
needed to come home
is startled to see  enter the room
She does not seem he usual self
She appears larger, more imposing
Hello, Jake
knew you'd come here in the end
is nervous
What're you
Where's Sarah
Where are the boys
Sit down, Jake
Where are they
Sit down
No
What's going on
Where's my family
It's over, Jake
It's all over
Where have they gone
Wake up
Stop playing with yourself
It's finished
stares at  with a frightening, powerful glare
The edge of her coat rustles and flutters as she moves toward him
It is an innocent sound at first, but after a moment it transforms into something else, an obsessive flapping noise, the sound of a wing
's body feels the first waves of an inner tremor
His legs are shaking
What's going on
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr
Singer
begins walking around the dark living room as she talks to him
Something about her walk is very unnatural
eyes her fearfully
In the darkness 's movements become increasingly strange and elusive
We see her pass before a shadow and disappear within it, only to reappear, seconds later, in a doorway on the other side of the room
spins around, confused
Suddenly  is inches from his face, although it seems like there has been no time for her to get there
Her movements are totally impossible, defying all logic, all physical laws
(continuing) What's wrong, Jake
(she mocks him) Forget to take your antidote
Who are you
What are you doing to me
You have quite a mind, Jake
loved your friends
That chemist - the Ladder
What an imagination you have
freezes
(continuing) And your vision of paradise
fantastic
You're a real dreamer, you know that
Only it's time to wake up
has disappeared in the darkness of the room
Only the sounds of flapping wings remain
They grow louder and more menacing, whooshing past him with no visible source
(continuing) Your mind is crumbling, Jake
No more "army
" No more conspiracies
You're dying, Dr
Singer
It's over
, frightened, turns toward the door as if to hurry out
"" laughs
(continuing) Where's to run, Jacob
Where's to go
pauses a moment and then turns to confront the terror behind him
How many times have you asked me that
How many times
,
(with consummate power) appears from the shadows
Her coat collar obscures her and it seems for a moment that she has no face
Then, to 's horror, she turns around
He is staring at the vibrating creature he has seen so often before
Glimpsed almost in abstraction it is a living terror, dark and undefinable
Its face is a black and impenetrable void in constant vibration
Its voice is an unspeakable demonic cry, the essence of fear and suffering
pulls away from it, overhwelmed by confusion
He is rooted in fear
sudden wind howls through the room, great gales blowing 's hair straight up
It is like a hurricane pushing him into the wall
He can barely stand
He struggles to pull himself away
The flapping sound returns, charging at him from all directions
It is as if the darkness itself is swooping down, trying to envelop him
(whispering to himself) This isn't happening
New terrible sounds arise, chain saws slashing through the air, knives, and sabers ripping through space with unrelenting anger
Guns fire and explode past his head
It is as though all the sounds of destruction are closing in on him
yells but his own voice is lost in the melee
Terrified, he looks heavenward, as if crying for help
Suddenly, from the noise, a calm voice rises, speaking, as if from a distance
It is
is shocked to hear him
He stands motionless
(
) If you're frightened of dying you'll see devils tearing you apart
If you've made your peace then they're angels freeing you from the world
The voice fades
just stands there, not sure what to do
And then the sounds return
Only now they are more terrifying than ever
Hideously loud, they become a cacophony of sounds, voices of parents, friends, lovers, the sounds of battle, fighting, and dying
looks up and sees the creature in the center of the room
All the sounds seem to emenate from it
The more  stares at it the louder they become
After a moment,  takes a huge breath
We sense a great resolve forming inside him
Then, slowly, courageously, he begins moving toward it
NEw and more terrifying noises assault , attempting to drive him back, but he will not be stopped
He continues walking toward the creature
In the hallway a standing lamp slams sparking to the floor
It rolls back and forth like a living thing, with a maddening hypnotic regularity
Doors slam open and closed, unlatching, snapping, shutting, with deafening force
The room itself seems like an organic presence
It is alive, angry, and threatening
The  sits in the midst of the insanity like the source of madness itself
It writhes, contorts and vibrates with unstoppable fury
, terrified, but unrelenting, continues to approach it
'  the density of its featureless form overwhelms the screen
It is like staring into emptiness itself, the ultimate darkness
With superhuman effort  grabs hold of the creature
It is like grabbing hold of a live wire
His body begins shaking uncontrollably like a man being electrocuted
He is flying in all directions but does not let go
His fingers claw at the creature's head
struggles defiantly with the monster
Suddenly a terrible voice emerges from within it
'
does not respond
It cries out again
' Deep inside the darkness  begins to make out the presence of a form, something writhing and tortured lurking before us
It looks briefly like an animal until we realize it is the image of a human face
It is covered by a dark suffocating film, like a mask
digs into it with all his might and pulls it off
: as      staring back at him from beneath the mask
It is   as we first saw him on the battlefield in Vietnam
Only now his image is pale and lifeless
It takes  a moment to realize that he is dead
The recognition is one of terrible confusion and pain
stares at himself for a long time as a huge cry wells up inside him
It bursts forth with devastating sadness
As that instant the whole of space seems to explode in a flash of catacylsmic power
Hundreds of images from 's life flash before us, his birth, his childhood, his adulthood
The demons, the room, , , , , all seem to assail us in a rush of blinding intensity
We are flying over a landscape of memories, zooming across a constantly changing field of images
Some of the images move, some of the people in them speak
They are not particularly significant memories, in some ways they are quite banal, but something about them is infused with life and joy
Even the painful moments resonate with vital force
Some of the moments we recognize from the time we've spent with
Some we have not seen before
There is no order to them, no logic to why they have been recalled
newborn baby takes its first breath and screams
pulls clothes off a clothes line on a rainy day
's  stands in the Florida surf as sea foam laps gently at his legs
, , and  play cards on the edge of a rice paddy
rides his bike into the path of an oncoming car
child puts his ear next to a bowl of cereal, listening to it talk
young girl standing in a doorway lifts up her blouse to show her new breasts
and  slice a wedding cake that topples to the floor
looks at  and asks "Love me a little
" And then it is over
Total silence overwhelms the screen, a wonderful soothing calm
's eyes open and he is shocked to find himself sitting on the floor in 's apartment
He is all alone
The first rays of early morning sunlight are filtering through the window
Something about the apartment seems transfigured, magical
sits motionless, stunned to be back there
The faint sound of music can be heard coming from the hallway
It is warm and familiar, the tinkling of a music box
listens to it for a few moments and then something registers inside him
Curious, he gets up and approaches the corridor
Hello
There is no response
Suddenly the music stops
freezes for a moment
He sees someone standing in the shadows at the other end
(continuing) Who is it
Who's there
Tentatively  moves forward
As he draws closer he begins to see the outline of a child
Then, all of a sudden, he realizes who it is
His eyes well up as he stands there, the full impact of the moment registering inside him
It's his son,
He is carrying the same musical lunch box we have seen before
The young boy smiles warmly at his father
It is the smile of an angel
swallows hard
(continuing) Gabe
Gabe
runs to his son
Unable to hold back the tears, he embraces him in a rush of love and emotion
(continuing) Gabe
Oh God
don't believe
They hug one another over and over
, overcome, sits down on the stiars
After a moment  puts his arm around his father's shoulder in a gesture of surprising maturity and compassion
We sense for an instant that their roles have reversed
reaches for 's hand and gently encourages him to stand up
With a sweet tug  leads his father up the steps
Sunlight streams down from the top of the stiars, hitting the first landing
is bathed in its warm glow
As  reaches the landing, he too is surrounded by the comforting light
hurries up the last set of stairs
turns to follow but is stunned by the brilliance of the light pouring in from above
Squinting, he cannot see his son
Then suddenly  steps back out of the light and takes his father's hand once more
His eyes sparkle with excitement
Come on Dad
You know what we've got
sandbox just like the Williston's, only it's bigger and the sand's all white
You won't believe it
smiles at his son
smiles at him
It is a moment of total euphoria
as they continue up the stairs
(continuing) And my parakeet
Remember, the one grandma let out of the cage
He's okay
And he's talking now
He knows my name
's voice slowly trails off as he and his father disappear in the intenstity of the light
on the image
For a brief but stunning moment there appears to be a huge ethereal staircase shimmering before us
It rises up into infinite dimensions
Then the brilliance of its blinding light overwhelms the screen
Suddenly the brightness condenses into a smaller light source
It holds for a second and then flashes off
An overhead surgical lamp remains stubbornly in view
- leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his mask
His expression is somber
He shakes his head
His words are simple and final
He's gone
lying on an operating table in a large in
The  steps away
rudely pulls a green sheet over his head
The  turns to one of the aides and throws up his hands in defeat
wheels 's body past rows of other  and fighting to save lives
pulls back a screen door to let them out of the tent
It is a bright, fresh morning
The sun is rising
"' " ( ) by Bruce Joel Rubin --- 1: -- - a huge ampitheatre-style   at
It is almost empty
No more than   are scattered near the front of nearly three hundred seats
All are listening to who is nearing the end of his lecture
Thus at the core of today's discu- sion we find four fundamental doc- trines
First, that the world of matter and individual consciousness are both manifestations of one Divine Reality
One of the  seems about to fall asleep and keeps nodding his head
Even you, Mr
Palmer, are part of it, as amazing as that may seem
sits up quickly in his seat as other  smile
Second, human beings are capable not only of kowledge about this Divine Re- ality by inference but can realize its existence by direct intuition, superior even to reason
door opens in the upper reaches of the lecture hall enters and walks quietly down the stairs to within hearing range of the professor
Third, man possesses a double nature, an ego and an eternal self, what we call "spirit" or "soul
" takes a seat at one of the desks
There is a pencil lying on it which he fingers distractedly
Fourth, and most important, man's life on earth has only one end and purpose, to learn to let go of the separate ego and to identify with the Divine spark within
is nodding off again
Almost impossible to believe, isn't it Mr
Palmer, that somewhere in that unconscious head of yours lies the source of all consciousness
Yes, Sir
Very hard
(nodding his head) Well now, having reached this apotheosis there seems little, if anything, left to say
So rather than try, you are dismissed
The  seem surprised but not unhappy with the sudden dismissal
They quickly gather their books and begin the long climb to the exits
Only  remains seated
Hello Prof
looks up and stares at  for several seconds before recognizing him
My oh my
Doctor Singer
Isn't this a happy surprise
comes down the aisle and clasps hands with his old (looking at 's uni- form) Are you in the service
The postal service
'm a mailman
(surprised but non- judgemental) Ah
Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night
always admired that
(smiling) It's good to see you
Likewise
- walk down the city streets that constitute the  of
And how is your wife
Sarah, no
(shrugging his shoul- ders) haven't seen her in months
(understanding) Ah
'm with another woman now
We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch
Hmm
don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office
Oh, you'd be surprised
They just don't have their doctorates, that's all
(he smiles) Last  heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere
Tuscon was it
Oh, that goes way back
They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things
Bad timing for me though
Middle of the war
The draft
( nods his head
They walk a moment in silence) 'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam didn't want to think anymore decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos
(looking at  with affection) Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours,  might agree
(he pauses) Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with
(smiling coyly) doubt it's my mind that interests her
tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady
(with a fatherly demeanor) Well, try not to get burned
You have a great mind, Jacob
Don't let anyone tempt you away from it
- and   are sitting at a quiet table in a nearly empty coffee shop
They are both fixing cups of tea, not speaking
Suddenly  looks at
've got a problem, Prof
More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what  mean
( looks at him questioningly) need to know about
demons
(surprised) Demons, Jacob
Why demons
Are you writing
No
(he pauses a moment) see them
See them
(he smiles uncomforta- bly) What do you mean
Physically
(hesitantly) Yes
pauses
He looks at
The intensity of his gaze is unsettling and  reaches for his tea
The cup rattles
know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway
know them as literary figures, biblical ones Dante, Milton
but Jacob, (he pauses) this is the 20th Century
We don't see demons now
see them, Prof
Everywhere
They're invading my life
look of concern fills 's eyes
(continuing) Christ,  know how it sounds
Have you considered a doctor
psy- chiatrist
Yes
(suddenly uneasy) don't want them
'm not looking for analysis or drugs
It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis
(he pauses uncomforta- bly) It's more than that
can feel it need you Prof
You're the only one can talk to
don't know what to say
need your insight, your intuition
sips his tea slowly
He is thinking
Demons
don't know what to tell you
It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me
The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it
You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud
How the hell am  supposed to make it fit
'm afraid, Prof
Nothing makes sense
(he pauses) Please help me
(trying to be delicate) Jacob,  don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense
don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls
don't believe in enternal damnation
don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us
We don't need them
We do a good enough job on ourselves
(disturbed) But  see them
Look
don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head
For all know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart
But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me,  admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own
What can  say
It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls
But to be pursued by
demons no less
There are no guides, Jacob
(he muses) You wanna know what 'd do if  sud- denly started seeing demons
'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment
'm no saint
Hell, you think  am
'venever understood you, you know that
You were by far the best pupil 've ever had, bar none
Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative
Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons
Maybe you're in touch with
some- thing
Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob
Nothing
gazes at his old friend and mentor, frustration blazing in his eyes
They are both surprised to see tears form and run down his cheek
reaches for a napkin and dries them quickly
, uncomfortable in the face of emotion, turns away
--- 2:    ' --- Suddenly a strange and terrifying spectacle unfolds before him
The  undergo a shocking transformation, a full three- dimensional alteration of their physical forms
Clothes fuse to their bodies like new skin
Horns and tails emerge and grow like exotic genitalia, exciting a frenzy among the
New appendages appear unfolding from their flesh
Dorsal fins protrude from their backs
Armored scales run in scallops down their legs
Tails entwine sensuously
Long tongues lick at the undersides of reptilian bellies
The metamorphosis holds a biological fascination
Bones and flesh mold into new forms of life, creatures of another world
's face as it registers terror and disbelief
He stares at the
They are perverse, corrupt aspects of their normal selves
He is mesmerized by
Her flesh has grown hard and wrinkled and has the markings of a snake
Her tongue, long and curled, darts in and out of her mouth repeatedly
Her eyes are thin and domineering
They lock  in their gaze
He wants to stop, to run, but  won't release him
grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from them but it won't go away
The music throbs
His actions become spastic, almost delirious
His hysteria attracts the attention of the other
circle forms around  and  as their frenzy transcends the boundaries of dance and erupts into an almost orgiastic display
is out of control
His fury becomes a kind of exorcism, a desperate attempt to free himself from his body and his mind
as his eyes pass beyond pain
The dark walls of the fade away
- Strange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness, outlined by a bright moon that is emerging from behind a large cloud
The faces are looking down and voices are speaking
He's burning up
Total delirium
He'll never make it
That's some gash
His guts keep spilling out
Push 'em back
(
) (crying weakly) Help me
His eyes focus on the moon
Rings of light emanate from it filling the sky with their sparkling brilliance
The rings draw us forward with a quickening intensity that grows into exhilarating speed
The rush causes them to flash stroboscopically and produce a dazzling, almost sensual, surge of color
The display is spectacular and compelling
voice can be heard in the distance
think we're losing him
Suddenly the flickering rings begin to define a tangible image, a kind of  , rising up into infinite dimensions
As we speed toward it, it grows increasingly majestic
The image is so awesome and other-worldly that it is difficult to grasp what is being seen
Music can be heard in the distance
It too is celestial in its beauty
Then, unexpectedly, it grows hard and insistent, like a heartbeat
Heavy breathing accompanies the sound
The image of the  shatters and disappears, replaced by intense flashes of red and blue light
The music grows louder and reaches a thundering crescendo
Then silence

screen
The battleground is being readied
Our planet is the battlefield
Our souls are the prize
All the signs point to the inevitable confrontation between the forces of good and evil
People must choose sides
There is no draft evasions in this war
All are called
All must take up weapons
Are you prepared
That's the question we ask
The toilet flushes and  walks back into the   and turns down the sound
Do you find people scoffing at you, Reverend
After all, there have been doomsayers for thousands of years and we're still here
People are less apt to laugh these days
The prophecies are too close for comfort
mean, all you have to do is watch the news
There are some who claim that your pessimism is defeatist and what the world needs now is hope, a positive thrust
think the time for hope has passed
The seeds have been planted
We shall reap what we've sown
(he pauses) Pessimists, no
think we are percieved as the only realists around
Other movement leaders agree
In an interview
Suddenly the telephone rings
It startles

It rings again

His eyes continue to stare at the blank screen as he talks

hurricane lamp casts a warm glow over their bodies
Its flickering light plays games with 's eyes and for a moment seems to disappear
reaches out for her breasts and his hands seem to vanish into the shadows dancing across her
With sudden, hallucinogenic impact,  feels himself drawn into a starry universe opening from inside her
plunges through her image into a galxy of stars and rushes toward one that is twinkling brightly
Pulsations of its light whiten the screen
Out of the whiteness appears a momentary flash of the  , accompanied by sounds of sexual climax
The  sparkles for an instant and then it's gone
The sparkle becomes a glimmer in 's eye as her face fills the screen
She looks especially lovely and radiant
Her image moves with the lamplight
's face is ecstatic
He can barely talk and simply basks in 's glow
Slowly, she leans forward and whispers in his ear
So tell me

You carry me away

He is reading
The room is dark, lit only by a reading light
The walls are mostly in shadow
The light, however, falls on one section of the wall, a portion that has been lined in fake wood paneling
's eyes suddenly lift off the page and roam over the wood grain on the wall
All of a sudden he notices something strange, an image in the grain
He stares at it
The more he stares the more precise its definition
The image of a  appears in the wall
sits up quickly and stares at the walll
It is impossible to get the 's image out of the grain
It seems etched, even imbedded, in the paneling
looks away and returns to his book
He is reading about archetypes and the primordial mind
But the book does not hold his attention
He is obsessed with the wall
Its molecules seem suddenly active, the wood grain suddenly animate
Layers begin to appear in the surface of the wall as the grain patterns slowly define a rocky, barren landscape
The  is growing solid
Cries and screams rise up in the distance
Flames and a red glow emanate from the space extending rapidly into the wall
The image of Hell erupts before him
stands up
He can see bodies suffering beyond the wall, masses of  wailing and enduring the torments of a fiery world
The 's arm slowly extends from the plane of the wall and reaches into the room
He is huge, covered in flames and skulls, a living horror
He grabs hold of  and pulls him toward the wall
tries to back away but he cannot
His face is white with fear
The  draws  toward the inferno
(yelling at the top of his lungs) Suddenly  appears, the light from the  flooding the paneled wall
The  vanishes instantly
Jake, are you all
She stops dead in her tracks
pressed up against the wall, defying gravity and logic, as though about to merge with the solid surface
His body holds there for a moment and then collapses to the floor goes to him
Jake
Jake
He doesn't answer
He looks at  with a blank stare
His body begins shaking
'  - is lying on the bed, curled up in a fetal pose
is stroking his hair and trying to calm him
It's going to be all right, Jake
It's going to be all right
Don't be afraid
've got you now
Hold me, Jezzie
Hold me
wraps herself around his shivering body and warms him with her own
The image seems tender and comforting until we notice 's tongue darting nervously in and out
It looks strangely like a snake's

His eyes fixate on the
It is white and sterile
Within moments it begins to emit a reddish glow
watches with astonishment as the wall's two-dimensional surface separates into three-dimensional planes
The solid surface gives way to a that was not there before
Out of the transmuted space  begin to form
Bosch-like with horns and tails, undeniably of another world
Slowly several of them emerge from the wall and approach
They look like parodies of doctors and nurses, wearing traditional hospital gowns
Without a word they wheel him through the space where the wall had been

Chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling
They are lowered and attached with speed and efficiency to 's arms and legs
The devices are manipulated smoothly and  is lifted off the stretcher
The chains retract, stretching him spread-eagle in the air
He screams loudly
Oh God
The  laugh
There is the sound of a huge door closing

The darkness is hallucinogenic
Fires appear beyond the boundaries of the wall; images of Dante's Inferno, souls of the dead in endless torment
is but one of countless beings sharing a vastness of torment
His own screams for help are lost in the magnitude of voices crying
Suddenly, out of the meancing shadows, a contingent of emerges
They are carrying sharp surgical instruments
They surround , their eyes glistening as bright as their blades
is panting and sweating with fear
For an instant, one of the  looks like

Jezzie
Help me
The  laugh as she changes form
They take great pleasure in his suffering
Their voices are strange and not human
Each utterance contains a multitude of contradictory tones, sincere and compassionate, taunting and mocking at the same time
The confusion of meanings is a torment of its own

She looks and is shocked to discover a can of gasoline and boxes of kitchen matches
It takes her a second to understand the implications of what she has found

You're completely off your rocker, you know that
You'd think you fell on your head instead of your back
What are you planning to do, burn down the apartment along with your demons
She begins to remove the gasoline can
(yelling) Don't you touch it
(he glares at her) lets go of the can and grabs the vacuum
She moves it furiously across the carpet
Suddenly  sees her tongue darting in and out, unconsciously
She looks strange, not human

He yells out
Who are you
The sound of the vacuum cleaner drowns out his voice
He yells again
sees him and turns off the machine
His voice booms out
(continuing) Who the hell are you
ignores the question and turns the vacuum cleaner back on
rolls over and pulls out the plug
Why won't you answer me
(angry) Cause you know goddamn well who  am
don't know you
You've lived with me for two years
That doesn't mean shit
Where do you come from, huh
And  don't mean Indiana
What do you want me to say
My mother's tummy
You know goddamn well what  mean
You're out of your fucking mind
'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you
Well leave then
Go to Hell
(furious) You son-of-a-bitch
Who do you think you are
don't deserve this
Who takes care of you day and night
Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear
Well, 've had it
You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard
'm done holding your hand
don't want anything to do with you, you hear
Nothing
She storms out of the room, kicking the vacuum cleaner as she goes
can see flashes of her through the open crack of the bedroom door
Occasional curses and epithets hurl through the opening along with a flood of tears
catches glimpses of her as she grabs her coat from the hall closet and as she pulls her money out of the desk drawer
He can see the lamp as she shoves it to the floor and hears it shatter as she stomps on it with her foot
There is a blur as she heads to the front door and a deafening bang as she leaves
's eyes drift up to the ceiling
They hardly blink
He stares at the plaster, chipped and cracked, above him
Suddenly the cracks begin to move
jumps up
is materializing over his head
yells and grabs hold of the extension pole for the vacuum cleaner
With a furious cry he begins jamming it at the ceiling
Rather than blot out the evolving image his attack helps to define it
slams harder
Plaster and wood lath cover the floor
The  is gone
Panting hard,  reaches for matches and the gasoline can
He stops and stares at them with great intensity
--- 8: --- The ceiling begins to rumble
Cracks split wide open
Huge crevasses tear through the plaster
's world is crumbling
He stares in horror as   attempt to surge through the rupture above him
Piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the darkness
Hooved feet and pointed claws clamor to break through
(continuing) Instantly  appears standing over him
He is holding the vial with the antidote
He draws an eyedropper full of the fluid and holds it over 's mouth
Take it
fights him but  forces the entire contents of the eyedropper down his throat
gags
He tries to spit it out, but can't
Suddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks break off and collide with one another like continental plates
The collisions wreak havoc on the , chopping and dismembering them
Body parts fall from the ceiling like a Devil's rain
Horrible screams echo from the other side
Flashes of light and dark storm over 's head, thundering like a war in the heavens
It is a scene of raw power and growing catastrophe
It builds in fury and rage until suddenly the ceiling explodes
Matter atomizes instantly
Trillions of particles hurl chaotically in all directions
The walls shatter into a dazzling brightness
For a moment there is a sense of intense forward movement, a rush toward oblivion
And then, suddenly, it stops
There is absolute quiet and stillness
's eyes stare into the formlessness sparkling around him
All space has become a shining void
Gradually faint pastel colors appear like colored molecules, dancing and spinning, redirecting space into new formations
They weave patterns of intricate complexity and stunning beauty
As the colors grow brighter and more vivid their abstraction gives way to solid form
emerges
It is a , a vast, almost mythic, Rousseau paradise
It radiates an intense shimmering light
's eyes are cpativated by the vision before him
sudden movement catches his attention
He looks up and notices still standing beside him
, however, is rapidly changing form
It is a full, plastic, three-dimensional metamorphosis
His very flesh seems to expand and glow with its own inner light
His face shines and radiates an almost transcendental beauty
is nearly blinded by 's presence and must shield his eyes to look at him
smiles an extraordinary and joyous smile that radiates such intense luminosity that  has to squint to see it
Suddenly  steps off the ground
He rises into the air and floats above
can barely breathe as he watches him
rises into a sky filled with orbs and blazing lights
The lights shine on 's head
He effervesces and shimmers in their glow
One of the orbs sends a burst of light exploding over
So intense is the light that  grabs his eyes
As he opens them again he sees that the  is fading back into pure light
, too, is fading
Another burst of light and the  is reabsorbed by the void
Only the brightness remains
It is many seconds before we realize that the   is coming together, reconstructed by the light
In moments it is fully formed
Sunlight is pouring through the window
is sleeping lightly in a chair
He hears stare and sits up
is sitting on the bed
He does not seem to know where he is
His eyes are filled with awe
They move slowly around the room, taking everything in
He doesn't speak
gets up and sits beside him
He respects his silence

She stares at him for a mo- ment, concerned) Jake
is it the antidote
Goddamn it
Why do you say that
Look at yourself
You look like you've seen a ghost
Shit
Can't  just have a bad day
You can have anything you want
Then don't bug me
'm not bugging you
Come and lie down
'll give you a massage
(she taps the mattress again and  joins her
She unbuttons his shirt) Where'd you go today
(evasively) Mid-town mostly
Oh yeah
What was happenin' there
(looking away from her) picked up my ticket
(he pauses) 'm leaving in the morning, Jez
(tensing) Oh
(acting innocent) Where you going
(nervously) West
(growing angry) Where's West
New Jersey
Don't be funny
always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway
But you gotta give me time to pack
Stop it, Jez
Don't do that
Do what
haven't done a thing
Don't play games with me
There's nothing more to say
There is a quiet rage building in 's eyes as she continues to stroke 's chest
He tries to relax and give himself over to the movement of her hand
Silently she leans over and begins licking his stomach
's eyes close
His stomach hardens
He reaches back and adjusts the pillow beneath his head
Slowly, works her way back up to his chest
Her tongue darts in and out suggestively
He eyes are burning with anger
Her mouth poises itself over his nipple
She toys with it for a few seconds and then chomps down hard
The bite draws blood
screams
His eyes shoot open
For the flash of an instant he sees a  hovering over him, a hideous horned creature licking his blood
flies off the bed as the creature hurls to the floor
is ready to pounce on it when he sees that it is  lying at his feet
His head begins reeling
He backs away from the bed, not taking his eyes off  for a second
He backs to the closet and grabs his coat
Jake
What are you doing
Look, 'm sorry,  didn't mean to bite
Let me get you a towel
grabs his wallet and his glasses
He backs toward the door
Jake, don't
You can't leave
You're not seeing things clearly
The drug's wearing off
She stands up and begins to approach him
lifts up a desk chair and holds it in front of him
Blood is running down his chest
Jake, don't leave me
throws the chair at the floor, opens the door, and hurries into the
scurries around the chair and runs to the door
She yells after him, but he is already gone
--- 10: --- - stoops in front of the  door and reaches his hand underneath a section of the hallway carpet
It comes back with a key
He inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door
(calling out) Hello
It's me
'  - The lights are on and the  looks comfortable and cozy
Hello
Is anyone home
Jed
Elie
Dad- dy's here
There is still no answer
is surprised
He walks into the and then the
No one is around
He walks into his old  and then the '
He is surprised to hear footsteps coming down the hall
He turns around and calls out
Sarah, is that you
hope you don't mind
needed to come home
is startled to see  enter the room
She does not seem to be her usual self
She seems larger, more imposing
Hello, Jake
knew you'd come here in the end
is nervous
Where's Sarah
Where are the boys
Sit down, Jake
Where are they
Sit down
No
What's going on
Where's my family
It's over, Jake
It's all over
Where have they gone
Wake up
Stop playing with yourself
It's finished
stares at  with a frightening, powerful glare
Her lips snarl
Her tongue begins darting in and out, only now it is not a nervous habit but a conscious act
's body feels the first waves of an inner tremor
His legs are shaking
What's going on
smiles at him
Her tongue wags and suddenly shoots from her mouth beyond human extension
recoils
(whispering to himself) This isn't happening
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr
Singer
's head begins to tighten and squeeze, as though she is suffering from cramps
watches in horror as her skull gives birth to pointed horns
Oh God
What's wrong, Jake
(she mocks him) Forget to take your antidote
(screaming) Goddamn you
(smiling and then laughing) loved your chemist, Jake
The height of fantasy
And your vision of paradise
(she laughs with a hu- miliating tone) most romantic creation
You're quite a dreamer, Jake
Only it's time to wake up
's eyes are locked on
His mouth is wide open
His body is shaking badly
He tries to back away from her but his legs barely move
There is nowhere to run, Jacob
You're home
Suddenly the pictures on the wall crash to the floor
Plaster from the ceiling breaks off in huge chunks and slams to the carpet
Light bulbs and lamps explode
runs to the door
He pulls it open and screams
He is on the edge of a fiery abyss
laughs with a new intensity of demonic force
spins around
How many times have you asked me that
How many times
,
(with consummate power) You know who  am
Suddenly  reaches for her tongue and pulls at it with all her might
It is an act of total, unrelieved grotesqueness
With each yank the horror grows as  literally pulls herself inside out before 's eyes
The emerging creature is  transfigured, a demonic presence beyond anything we have seen before
It is black and covered with a thick oozing slime
Its head, still recognizable as , is rodent-like, with piercing green eyes and terrible horns protruding from its brow
Its powerful arms have long spiked claws
Its feet are cloven hooves
Extending from its back is a long, thick, muscular tail that whips around the room with devastating force
It throws furniture crashing through the air
sudden cracking sound emerges from the 's back
Dark forms penetrate the air
is breathless as huge wings unfold and spread out to the living room walls
The sound of their flapping is deafening
The walls shatter from their blows
As they crumble darkness appears on the other side
There are no other rooms
The envelops them
The  emerges in all directions
The roars
(with 's voice) Still love me, Jake
(it laughs and reaches out to him) 's face
He has gone beyond fear
An intensity of rage is building in him that we have not witnessed before
His whole image seems transformed by it
He glows like a volcano before it erupts
Suddenly he explodes
The full fury of the Ladder detonates inside him
He yells at the  with all his might
With a power and energy of devastating force he attacks the is battling for his very soul and tears at the with an animalistic fury that takes it by surprise
Its giant wings flap furiously, lifting them both up off the floor keeps fighting
He claws, bites, and rips at the wings, decimating their delicate fabric
The , shocked, and trying to gain control, crashes up through the last fragments of the ceiling
does not let go
They burst into the fiery darkness
The room crumbles beneath them and disappears into the void
The abyss opens beneath them
continues his attack
His legs are locked around the 's waist
His hands dig into her eyes
The  shrieks and surges downward with awesome velocity
The  charges into a rocky slope, smashing  into its cliffs
claws at her wings, shredding as much of them as he can reach
The  takes a huge chunk out of 's arm screams, grabs a rock, and shatters the 's teeth
The falls to the ground
holds on
All of a sudden the  begins to shrink
is shocked and struggles to contain it
As it dwindles in size it reorders its shape
Within seconds a powerful  is cupped in his hands
tries to crush it but it stings with such force that 's entire body recoils
The stinging persists
hurls himself to the ground on top of his arms to hold the down
So massive is the 's attack
however, that 's whole body heaves off the ground with each sting
Then the attacks subside
waits for the next blow
Suddenly 's body shoots straight up
His hands fly apart as a new life form erupts between them
He holds on tightly as flesh and blood mold and expand between his fingers
The new body takes rapid shape
It is a
grasps it with all his might as it completes its identity
He is horrified when he sees it
It is his son
Daddy
Oh God
You're hurting me
(yelling) Stop
Daddy
Let go
What do you want from me
does not let up
In an instant his  explodes into a gelatinous form, constantly undulating and changing shape
Within its translucent mass a new body is forming
stares at it with growing terror
It is himself
terrible perplexity fills 's eyes as he struggles to dig in and destroy his own image
He recoils as his own voice calls out to him
Who the Hell do you think you're fighting
The words shock him and for the first time, he lets go
Instantly the image disappears and the jelly-like mass dissolves into an oily liquid rapidly encircling his feet
looks down at the shallow pool spreading out beneath him
Its surface reflects a smoky, unearthly light
gazes into the darkness
He is all alone
The quiet overwhelms him
The only sound is his own breath
He looks around, in all directions, but can see nothing
The  holds on him as he stands waiting for the next assault, but nothing comes
He is left only with his anticipation and with hinself
He stares at the terrible darkness
subtle phospheresence begins to glow in the liquid beneath 's feet
He steps away from it, but it follows his movement
Suddenly, as if by spontaneous combustion, it bursts into flames
screams and tries to run but the flames move with him, lapping at his legs
He cannot escape them
As far and as fast as he runs the fire is with him
He yells and cries and screams as the fire eats at his lower limbs
He falls and jumps back up again, his hands charred
His eyes grow wild
Oh God, help me
Instantly the flames roar and engulf him
It is total conflagration
's skin blisters and turns black
His flesh crackles
Writhing in pain he runs through the flames but can find no freedom from his suffering
All at once  stops running
He throws his hands up into the burning air and stands motionless, in absolute agony
It is a gesture of total submission and surrender to forces beyond himself
His flesh bubbles and chars but something is suddenly quiet inside him
Through the flames 's dark form can be seen as it slowly sits down, like a Buddhist monk, in the midst of the holocaust
He appears a figure of sudden nobility as the flames annihilate him
Gradually the fire dies
's body, his flesh like a charred and brittle shell, sits motionless, beyond pain
An orange glow from the embers of his body slowly fades, leaving him in the final darkness
The  stays dark for as long as possible
Then, slowly, an eerie light appears in an unfamiliar sky
It backlights , revealing his silhouette
The  dollies slowly toward him
It approaches the burned and unrecognizable remains of 's face
It is the face of death
The  holds on the image
Suddenly, with shocking impact, 's eyes move
Within the crumbling shell of a body something is still alive, still conscious
The eyes survey the darkness and the first stirrings of a new light
It is dawn
's dark remains are suffused by a preternatural glow
Slowly, huge orbs begin to appear on the horizon
's eyes open to the growing light as they seek out the familiar in the still dark lansdcape
Gradually the orbs begin their ascent like a thousand suns rising at the same time
's eyes widen as his new world stands revealed
He is sitting in a , the Rousseau paradise he has visited once before
sudden burst of light fills the sky directly overhead
The vegetation around him is instantly illuminated with its soft glow
Like a gentle breeze  descends from the light and stands radiant before
He smiles and the air itself seems to brighten
quietly approaches 's body
am with you, Jacob
stares at him through dark eyes with a mixture of awe and disbelief
(speaking with a gentle compassion) It's all right now
It's over
You've won
You're here
( stares at him questioningly reaches out his hands) Trust me
Softly  places his hands on top of 's head and begins to peel at the charred flesh
Layer by layer he strips it away
Then, with an unexpected gesture, he rips away a whole section with one quick pull
bursts through the gaping hole in 's head and beams into the air around them
It is an astounding sight
Come on
Don't make me do it all
(his eyes sparkle) Stand up
('s eyes are burst- ing with wonder) You can do it
Slowly  begins to stir
He moves feebly at first, like an old man
His black flesh creaks and cracks and through each sudden fissure another beam of light blasts out with laserlike intensity
Stop hobbling
Your flesh can't hold you anymore
nods in response and takes a huge, gigantic breath
His lungs expand and suddenly all the old flesh bursts from his body as a radiant being of light breaks through beneath it stands transfigured, filled with his own luminosity
His face is like a child's as he stares in amazement at his own hands, glowing with light
directs 's vision to the sunrise
It is majestic, almost Biblical in its grandeur
Great rays of light penetrate vast cloud formations and descend into the
Slowly the clouds, as if orchestrated by some higher power, begin to part massive light complex emerges from behind them
watches, awestruck, as the   stands revealed
It reaches down from unknown heights, radiating an infinite power and grace
It touches down far in the distance, hovering over many acres of teh
's eyes are filled with its splendor looks at him and nods
Go on, Jacob
It has come for you
cannot speak
His eyes are fixed on the  dazzling him from afar
He can see   moving up and down it
Suddenly, as if transported by light itself, he feels himself floating up into the air
He looks down upon  sparkling below him
His mouth is wide open as he soars above it
The light pulsating from the  is brilliant and thrilling
's own inner light intensifies as he approaches it
The grows increasingly wondrous as we draw nearer
It pulls toward it
enter the  like a fast flowing river
It carries them instantly within its current up beyond the visible reaches of the glittering sky
Billowing clouds glow in a parade of colors and the starry heavens seem to part as the reaches beyond all known dimensions
stares at the light that is about to absorb him
It is a moment of total euphoria
He surges into the stream as the brilliant light of the  overwhelms the screen
Slowly the brightness of the screen condenses into a smaller light source
An overhead surgical lamp remains stubbornly in view
- leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his mask
His expression is somber
He shakes his head
His words are simple and final
He's gone
lying on an operating table in a large in
The  steps away
rudely pulls a green sheet up over his head
The  turns to one of the aides and throws up his hands in defeat
wheel 's body past rows of other  and fighting to save lives
pulls back a screen door to let them out of the tent
It is a bright, fresh morning
The sun is rising
