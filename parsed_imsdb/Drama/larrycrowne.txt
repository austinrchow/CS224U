2009 Big and orange and full of hope, as sure as fate
dawn as promising as, well, this new day
Sun is rising over
flat roof that stretches to the horizon
vast expanse
plain of gravel-embedded tar, studded with
units and power lines, the kind that service a huge commercial building
In fact this kind of building
store
flagship of savings; a mother lode of low, low prices
100,000-and-then-some square feet of the Consumer Economy
Empty thus far
few  autos arriving in their assigned slots far from the entrance
One of those cars is a old, not so vintage nor classic convertible
-- Belonging to
-  man as reliable (and predictable) as that rising sun
Actually, he's a Team Leader of this Unimart, dressed in his un-sexy, un-fashionable, un-flattering khaki pants and Company Polo
Larry has had the ragtop down
He wrestles it up, locks the cover into place
He doesn't just walk to work, but s t r i d e s across the asphalt field like a Sultan of Sales; a Viscount of Discount
He cheers co-workers at the start of the day, shouting encouragement, flashing thumbs up, knocking on car doors and squeezing shoulders

Where United, you save
Larry Crowne leads the High Fives
- Larry controlling the aisles like an Admiral at a Battle Map
stacking a mountain of tube socks
stocking those briefs
hanging "Metallica" Speedos on little hangers
helping  - a very skinny and disinterested Janitor - clean up some baby up-chuck as the baby up-chucks again
3
Too much mac & cheese for this little pickle bug
They do love the comfort food
Don't you, Li'l Pickle Bug
Imagine any duty and see how Larry gets it done
- Larry is collecting loose shopping carts, steering them into pairs, triplets, sextuplets, then riding them into the cart pen like a Trail Boss
That same up-chucking baby was riding on the coin-pony and up- chucked again
Larry is cleaning it all up
beat-up  with a    sign stuck on its roof pulls right up to the front of the store, parking in the Handicapped Space
Buddy
Park there and you'll get a ticket
Call a cop, doof
'm gone in sixty seconds
(a dozen pizza boxes) You guys having a party

reads "Good Luck Dorothy Genkos
" The name has been printed over the last person to retire
People are cutting loose as best they can at a - Corporate Fete
None more than Larry
Who is organizing a   for , an old lady
This is a fun group
Over in the corner, though, is the Front Office Staff: , ,  and  (Female)

Finally
Dotty
and her forty-two- a year are history
Who else would do us that favor
Wish they'd all sail off like her
Save us some grief
The "" Bomb is going to do some collateral damage to this place
Hurley is shocked
"-Bomb"
Oh my god
Restructuring
Separating the chaff from the wheat
Chaff is the bad stuff, right
Chaff is the waste matter, correct
When are we restructuring
Before
Them's our orders
Hurley looks sick
She hates this
What say we drop a brick in the pond to warn the herd
How
Firing someone
Someone they'd never expect to be let go
To look fair
like it
Like a Team Leader
Team Leader
5
Suggestions on who it should be
say Crowne
Larry Crowne
Strang rolls his eyes
Who else
Avery won't retire
We fire him, it's a law suit
- Old
Black
Happy
(') Alvarez is about to drop a kid
She'll go part time in a week
- Heavy with child
(') Crowne's pink slip will save 'da "" big green backwash
What Salary Tier is Crowne at
Top of the pyramid with a
bump at the first of the year
Sweet
We'll need Actionable Cause, of course
They all agree: "Yeah
Sure
Of course
" (') How's his review record
He's a candidate for Employee of the Month
His 22nd time
Okay
So
Sluggers, gimme a reason
Larry has organized a Limbo Contest
6
We could use the Limited Horizons strategy
() Larry will always be passed over for Management
He never went to college
You're that familiar with his record
She was his squeeze for a few weeks, weren't you, Vick
That was before the New Employee Covenants
That you even remember
The memory haunts me
He'll sock us for severance
Big brick in the pond, though
Let's call it
Today, end of shift, UniMart bids Crowne adieu
is dancing up a storm
-   - Less cars
Fewer shoppers
Heading into the night shift
-  - Larry is the only Team Leader still on duty and sober
He is fastidious in his work
The
System blares
It's incomprehensible
He pays no attention
-- a  Security Guard -- comes by
Why still here
7
Team Leaders zone departments before punching out
It's policy
mean here here
You just got paged to Meeting Room 2
The
blares again
Now they can hear it -- sort of
Probably to clean up after the party
Isn't it Employee of the Month Day
Larry brightens
That is what it must be
Speck-tack-alar
Flushed at the prospect, Larry gives Terrorist Fist Bumps
You're the only one around here who deserves it
How many will this be
Ah, who's counting
He flashes his fingers: twenty two
#2 - Larry Cr wne soars into the room
Cubby is cleaning up the substantial mess
The Front Office Team has taken seats
Remember how we saw "The UniMart Way" video, Vick
You and me, alone in this room, and look at us now
Hurley has a frozen face
Larry looks at Andrews' smile
Cubby
Make tracks
The Janitor literally drops everything and leaves 8
think  know what this is about
don't think you do
Crowne
At UniMart, we care
So we take care
Which makes moments like these tough for all of us
Sounds like you're firing me
Larry is joking
take it back
Corporate has mandated a restructuring in all UniMart stores
That's the word they use
call it a pain in the touchas
() It is touchas, right
Where you get kicked
Yeah
yiddish word
Like the buttocks
Touchas and buttocks
Synonymous
Hurts to get kicked back there, no matter what language you speak
Larry now gets it
UniMart is firing me
Crowne-ie, you did a heck of a job
Why me
9
Who do you suggest
Alvarez
Avery
don't think so
Why not Strang
Strang snorts
(') 've been here longer than you, Jack
started 21 years ago as an Inventory Associate at the store on Euclid
Hurley takes over, as blank as a tax-form
Seniority would preclude this reality, Larry, but UniMart's policy is to never limit your horizons
Larry Crowne has no idea what that means
Here's the prob: your lack of a graduate degree will forever retard any move up the management ladder
Becasue you never went to college you're forever retarded
won't make the Front Office
Never
(shows his college ring) Class of '86
Go 'Stangs
It's true
went in the Navy
Right outta high school
Five years, and by then
Thank you for your service to our country, Larry
And, in total seriousness to UniMart too 10

In a way, you are

From his hands-free speaker jerry-rigged on his dash, we hear - Music
Then, we hear the engines of  -- at least a dozen of them
They surround his car -- both lanes -- and the chatter of the riders as they scream over their engines as they - "Remember, you always have a friend at RiverBank

What happened to Barry Raphael

Larry stops
This may be futile
He looks about to give up
But then, he thinks
He stands
Thinks some more

Larry Crowne is ironing his nicest shirt and his best khakis to perfection

Oh,  remember you
Larry Crowne
never forget anyone who quits on me
As  recall,  gave my notice and worked all my shifts and that was 12 years ago
As  recall,  had to hire and train a line cook to take your place
Walking out doesn't happen in a vacuum, you know
() Doesn't mean  wouldn't give you a job again
But you've been out of the business a long time, and look around
don't need you

Larry Crowne
With an 'e'
'Larry'
don't think so
used to be Kathleen but one day  looked in the mirror and saw a girl named Talia
(then in her phone) Putting you in as 'Lance'
Check your texts and we'll do us some scooting
() Gotta tell you, Lance
Tucking a polo shirt into khakis makes you look like a cop
Not much fashion sense
know
Gotta change that
Larry sees Mercedes Tainot walking from the Faculty lot, and doesn't want to be late again
Gotta go
Then get going
Talia watches him go
Likes him thus far
217 - Mercedes is at a desk in the back
Bored and, yes, a bit hungover again
You can tell by the way she takes long pulls from her Thermo-cup
Busik is sitting in on the class, not far from Mercedes
In front of the board that says "
" Calimeris is demonstrating an exercise for her speech
With the push-up added, the 4-count Burpie becomes the 6-count Burpie and works out the pecs and biceps
It's an all-in-one exercise perfect for Cheerleader conditioning
The 6- 37
The class is too shy to applaud though Busik claps like a fan
We now all know how to Burpie
Thank you

No one volunteers

Larry goes to the podium - armed with a huge stack of 3x5's
Busik shoots him a 'thumbs up
' He looks at Mercedes for the starting cue
(') Go
My presentation will be on the subject of a very particular procedure
"How to make French Toast", but 'll speak English
Larry has used up one card
Mercedes rolls her eyes and talks to herself in a   way
classes were once filled with e rnest young men ready to learn all  had to teach them
Cute boys fresh out of High School who all had crushes on me from day one
Now look at my cadre
Dibiasi
Bound for jail
Mack
Treating college like another tour of combat
Crowne
If this was Hamlet, he'd be Osric in Act 5
The part that is always cut
38
Larry checks on Ms
Tainot in the back
She is not talking, only listening (the   mentioned above)
(') Busik,  am going to kill you
You can't suggest these saps take Shorthand or Oral Hygiene
Bring me in at this ungodly hour for 2 minutes on French toast
Busik looks at Mercedes, signals a 'not bad, eh
' about Larry
She is a stone face
Most people think syrup comes out of a plastic bottle
(still talking to herself) Great
The history of the sugar maple tree now
Thank you Wikipedia
Larry still has a dozen cards to go
But the speech is over
(') Ah-ooo-gah
Time's up
That went fast
Breakfast may never be ready
Larry gathers his cards
Busik gives him a 'bravo

Larry is taking notes, beside Lala, when his phone vibrates
He flinches to turn it off before getting into trouble
On his phone a message: : "Scoot

His phone buzzes again

He sees Talia, phone in hand, miming riding a scooter -- you and me -- wind in our hair

-    - Some of the Scooter Gang have assembled as Larry and Talia walk up
and  are talking about today's route
Hey Monkey
Dell Gordo plants a kiss right on Talia's lips
She kisses him back
Larry sinks a little

It only figures Talia would have a boyfriend like Dell Gordo
(') This is Lance Corona
Classmate and good guy, so far
Dell Gordo
You want to ride with us
Why not
There is a beat of a stare down between Dell Gordo and Larry, but then Dell starts to snap his fingers -- -- the other join in until they are all snapping fingers like the Jets vs
Sharks
Talia too
Snap along, Lance or you can't join the gang
Larry, clumsily, starts snapping too
After a few bars
Okay
You're in for a trial run
And just like that, everyone goes back to their wheels
Not many of these '66 Wasps left around
They had low torque
How's the torque
He means Larry's scooter
just bought it and ride around
Someone yells "Saddle up
" Stan knows engines and junk
Let's go, Sweets
We ride, Monkey
Larry's heart breaks a tiny bit, suffering as he does from Talia-on-the-heart
41
The squad pulls out through the cars of the parking lot with Larry trying to speed his machine along with the crowd
They roll through town - a multi-wheeled dance troupe
Swaying
turning
slow-motion sometimes
elegant always
They make riding look fun
being in a group a gas
rolling with the wind in your hair something you'd like to do
As Larry and the Squad pass it by, Larry can't help but eye the place he once worked
He sees staffers collecting carts in the parking lot
He misses that place
After many shots, riders begin to peel off -- scooting done
Talia waves at Larry who guns his throttle and pulls even with her
(') You good, Lance
Other than school,  have nothing to do
Let's troll Buena Vista for junk stores
We hit those last week

That Larry believed there were signs on posts marking the Equator
And that, when it's a first time, they make the rookies dress in drag and sing Abba songs
Mercedes missed a lot of that
Everything, in f ct

What do men see in irritating free spirits
Mercedes starts walking
Seriously

Seriously

Larry shuts off his scooter, pushing it along with his feet 've yet to give anyone a lift on this but  think  can get you home with a scraped elbow, worst case

Major consequences sure to follow

Fine

Mercedes is singing "Sixteen Miles on the Erie Canal"

Where am  taking you
Down to Portola and left to Havenhurst

Take one step inside and  call security
Larry steps away from the door
(') And forget this ever happened
What
This whole sorry chapter tonight
What
You passing up Gidget for a flat old coot like me
What are you talking about
What, you have no short-term memory
Larry has been tying to be polite
When  say 'what', it means  get it and have already purposefully forgotten everything
Call it irony
Sarcasm
Irony is when Gallant lands in the drunk tank while Goofus scoots me home
Goodnight, Ms

That's a long story and it's late
() My helmet
Help yourself
She sticks her neck out
If this were a movie, they might kiss right now
Larry pauses
Mercedes looks at him
He's not a bad looking guy
He starts to undo the helmet strap
(') noticed something on the ride
You smell good
Thanks
He gently removes the strap and helmet from her head
be a bit sexy
Her hair tumbles out
Do you have a crush on me
Single student
Unattainable teacher
It's common
Larry has no idea what to say
We all have crushes on you
Even the gals
You want to make out with me, you can
know 'm not a third rate Audrey Hepburn wanna-be but  still Come on, Gramps
Take this ride
() 85
(') My spouse won't be home for 3 to 5 years
Larry ponders this moment for as long as he can
He shouldn't, of course
But, damn
She is Mercedes Tainot
Bang
It's a pretty good whammy kiss
Makes her splay her arms and everything
Larry pulls back
After a bit, though
She could have kept at it, too
Wow
Pretty dang good
still got it, no
Yes, you do
() In you go
(Mercedes goes in) Close the door
( ) Lock it
Larry hears the sound of the bolt
He walks away
- Mercedes leans against the door
What did she just do
(
) Goodnight, whoever you are
Whoever  am
- Larry wistfully starts his bike, looking back at the door
He will not forget that kiss or this night
He drives off
- is pulling up
Out of the back, Dean, looking like he 86
He pays the cabbie, pissed off about everything
Then his world gets much more complicated
All his possessions, stacked up in front of the door
On the top of the heap, his computer
Turned on and showing porn Oh, Jesus Hell and tomorrow
() Mercy
'   - Mercy feels terrible, stepping from her car, brutally hungover
As she straightens up, her eye catches
On his scooter
Heading towards the Scooter parking
She smiles -- a rare thing on a morning like this but the memory of last night warrants it
She heads in that direction
- Mercy is trying to 'accidentally' run into Larry, but is caught by surprise when
He is walking right towards her
Oops
That would be uncomfortable
She  behind a pillar
Still wanting to 'bump' into the man who kissed her last night, she circumvents his path, stalking Larry like a birdwatcher tracks a blue-tailed swallow
Hopping behind a tree, Mercy's  gets caught in some mud
Bending down, a branch catches her sweater and  a seam
Stepping onto the pavement, the tree branch  her in the head
Still, she keeps and eye on Larry
And pursues
87
Staying out of his eye line, Mercy navigates her way around to the other side of the Bench Area and preps her appearance before making a 180 degree reverse, guaranteeing a 'Meet' with Larry
Then she sees her
Sitting with others, greeting Larry with laughter and hugs and hoots
Talia is announcing to all how she left Larry with a drunken teacher last night, with her arm around his waist and affection in her eyes
Is crushed
For the obvious reasons sh s ill can't understand
She was hoping to have Larry to herself for a minute or two
Amid the others
Oh, come on
left you all set up
What went down
Epilog
School today
Lance
Betty on your Scooter after midnight
Holding on, her arms around you, pressed against your back, is a license to at least cop a feel
If we had ended up making out, you still wouldn't hear it
Talia slugs him
All in play
Convinced Larry is gossiping about last night, Mercy backs away from the scene, and slinks away toward her class
88
217 - Mercedes is in the back, wearing the darkest glasses allowed a teacher in a classroom, hiding the fact that Mercy is looking at Larry
Larry is listening to Lala with delight
Seeing them -- the Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis -- should have been beyond me, but  was a little girl in Coach class still awake, a window seat, a moonless night somewhere over Greenland with a shimmering curtain of emerald, gossamer light dancing just for me
() That is something  will remember forever
The  is over
The class erupts in applause for Lala, who has hit a home-run
Foremost of the fans, Larry, who rises in applause for the once quiet classmate
Then the applause is over
The teacher says nothing That was a knockout speech, Lala
Made the news
Caused riots downtown
School's out til 2019
The students look at each other, shrug their shoulders, and head ou
Mr
Crowne
moment please
Why doesn't she just throw herself at him
This is bordering on harassment now
Quiet down
'm watching the show
Why doesn't this ever happen to me
89
need a few moments alone with Mr
Crowne thank you
Move along folks
Privacy's a right in this great nation of ours
You want  should close this door, lock it, and barricade it so you won't be disturbed
We hear them cackling like geese in the hall
How are the Triplets
Groggy, Puffy, and Grumpy
He means the hangover
Last night was a confluence of too many things happening in too short a time span
Last i ht
Let's see, what was doing
Studying some
Working some
Can't recall
've forgotten everything that happened last night as best a gentleman can
had no right to judge you or your relationships
Date who you want
Larry has no idea what that means
(') But what happened last night -- between adults -- was inappropriate
If gossip were to circulate, the problem could be more than just embarrassing
My status as a professor could be tarnished
wouldn't want that
happened before
() 90
(') With parking attendants
Strangers at parties when 've had a bit too much of the demon rum
This was the first time with a student
() hope the entire thing will be forgotten
Larry has just had his feelings hurt by his teacher
Sure
Nothing happened
At all
So there will be no bravado among you and your pals
None
Thank you, Mr
Crowne
'd better scurry along to Dr
Matsutani's class
hope  don't have this same conversation with him
Larry leaves - a good mood ruined
Mercy watches him go
What is going on behind those dark glasses
'  - Larry and Lamarr are sitting on the curb, watching kids play down the street
They run back and forth in front of them with a soccer ball
They both have pipes, with Lamarr showing him how to light up
Puff
Don't suck
Then
relax
() See
Works
have to sell my car
Put a new top on it
91
If  could afford a new top  could afford to keep it
What's the job paying you
Half my UniMart salary
You're down, Larry Crowne
Down as dirt
'm looking back on the year Denise left as the good old days
Hang in there, neighbor
Everyone keeps saying that
was in the same spot
Look what happened
The odds of two people on the same street winning the lottery are worse than one person on the street winning the lottery
read how the universe is expanding, Larry, taking us along with it
That is a wild concept to grasp, but what it means is, we all have to hold on tight sometimes to get to where we're going to be
( ) This thing must be making me dizzy
What
Keep your grip
You'll be okay
It's like the wife always says
Shoppers pull up to Lamarr's Yard Sale

Shopping carts are herded into their corral by
former Team Leader Larry Crowne
- Larry stands where he was once king
The place looks different
Shabby
Unkempt
Understaffed
He recognizes no one
No one is there to help Larry pick out two 'For Sale by Owner' signs
And, he can't help it: he straightens out some messed up racks and shelves

What up
Are we making a mistake here
94
Point made
We could change things
We could start right now
We could
Why should we
Because we have history, Dean
But first, my thoughts
've got to address drinking
should be able to comprehend and respond to both sides of our conversations
And the morning shower should be refreshing, not a hangover cure
'd like that too
Really
You're not a pleasant woman after a few glasses
Mornings with you are to be survived
Okay
Now, you
Dean is caught short
see
'm what this is all about
There are plenty of items on the relationship agenda but let's start here
You're talking about you but you really mean me
() am not yelling or begging or saying you have to stop doing anything
So you don't get to either
'm not saying that
95
We've both been here before
Why prolong the process
White flag give up
This ain't working
() 'll sign papers and checks, see if there's enough for a cool sports car as a reward for the last few years and eventually  will be fine and you will too
But  am never once going to look at myself as another poor divorced guy who could still be married if only he had done the mea culpa bit for all his faults
() just now came up with that, and it is going to be my next posting
He pulls out his Blackberry and makes a note to himself
(') don't think there is anything else to talk about
Do you
Mercedes looks at him
She has been a fool
- Mercy -- Margarita pitcher handy -- is still writing words on paper, and drinking
Alone
Not good
- The sign reads " :

wanted something in Japanese so check this out
She shows it to him, just above her butt-crack
It's two Japanese characters

That one says 'spirit'
Courageous Spirit
Dell Gordo knocks on the window as Larry has his hands on his gal's butt
"What's this, Lance

Oh shut up
It does
Soy sauce

Quitting school is for dopes

Larry comes into frame, with a hammer and stake
'  - He is pounding the   sign into his front lawn
Laurie Gammelgaard pulls up her new  Bug with a  in the back seat
They get out and Larry nods as he waves them to the door
He remains on the lawn, looking at his neighborhood -- the kids, the dogs -- Lamarr across the street
It's all over
99
'   - Frances and Mercedes have pulled up in her car
- This place anonymous enough
As long as alcohol's out of my grasp
- They have good pie, they say
Great
Sugar can replace tequila in my bloodstream, my thighs, and the folds in my neck
They pass a car prominently parked - Larry's Convertible Karmann Ghia with a sign on its windshield: " " - (-) So
You're a mess
'   - They sit in a back booth where she would never see Larry
Yep
- You'd think leggy blondes like us would be impervious, right
At that moment, Larry Crowne happens to come out of the kitchen to help himself to a cup of coffee
Mercedes sees him just as Perry comes up with menus
Ladies
Bring an appetite
- The mark of a restaurant is their Key Lime pie
Mercedes is surprised to see Larry in a chef's hat

- No Key Lime
Cream pies  got

Perry leaves to put in the order
(') You won't believe how far  fell on the Hooch-o-meter

kissed a boy
- When, third grade
One of my students
- You Hoor
() Gimme the friggin' details
He's not a minor is he
101
Older than me
- Hugh Hefner in your class
What went down
He sort of
rescued me
And
he smelled nice
- He a fireman who bakes bread
wanted to be kissed so asked if he wanted to and he did
- Bold
Who is he
Perry slides over a plate of French Toast -- with one bite out of it
Larry looks up from his Econ
1 Textbook
You're slipping, Larry
( ) Lady says it's not French Toast as she knows it
She's insane
Take it up with her
Larry heads out of the kitchen
(') No shouting, okay
This is a family friendly establishment
Here comes Larry, not yet seeing Mercedes
Frances Taylor-Briegh
You have a problem with your order
102
Knock Larry over with a feather
Mrs
Tainot
- ( ) The student of yours
This is Larry Crowne
There's no way in creation  screw up French Toast
It was fine, actually
() wanted to see if it was really you cooking back there
And say, howdy
Howdy doody
During the following, Frances is trying to get a whiff of Larry -- to find out how he smells
(') Ready for the final
You'll be the judge of that
The is a beat of silence
(') So, your meal is satisfactory
Absolutely
Would you let my boss know so don't lose this job
Yes indeed
Shall  prepare you another batch
No
Thanks
103
Then  will return to my station
Mercedes watches him go
- You kissed the cook
() got a whiff
He smelled like bell pepper
Look at the men in my life
- Blame it on the booze
and collect yourself
() You hoor
That's my problem
'm a drunken hoor
- That ends
right now
() Check please
Larry comes back through the door, humiliation wracking his face
He tosses the French Toast down the disposal
- Mercedes and Frances are  the house with vacuums, cleaners, and fortitude
on Shakespeare and Shaw go on shelves where Dean's tomes used to rest
Computer wires are not even untangled, just chucked
The cupboard is open
Where there was once booze go coffees and teas
is playing as these girlfriends reconstruct Mercy's life
104
' -- - The street is empty
Larry is on his scooter, riding around and around and around the block that he will soon leave
He can see his  through the open windows -- bouncing on a couch
playing cards and laughing
a  playing on a big
This was Larry's street
: - Mercedes exits the door, crisp, clean -- like we've never seen her in the mornings
See the way she holds, not clutches, her Thermo-Cup
'  - He's wearing a zipped up jacket
Kids and dog-walkers pass as his scooter starts pronto, he is off
The   sign on his lawn has an addition: 217 - On the projected computer screen:  portrait of
Dibiasi is giving his speech, but we are hearing Mercedes
What a difference from day one must be a better teacher than thought
() Dibiasi is nailing it
Calimeris stopped up-talking
Lala you can't shut up
Mack spoke about Australia for three minutes and mentioned kangaroos only twice
And Larry Crowne
Larry is listening to Dibiasi, wearing what was once his UniMart polo, with his nametag and everything
Compared to the man he is now, that polo looks out of place
105
(') was tough on him
But he learned fast
How he connected the Circle of Sales to the expanding universe is impressive as hell
'll never forget about the Value Index now
He gave a perfect speech
() And
He's polite
Instead of fighting me off that night, what does he do but kisses me one and then all but tucks me in
What kind of guy does that to a loopy tramp like me
He could have ravaged me
misread this guy and if  had a brain 'd find a way to steal him away from that cutie pie and keep him for myself
wonder if he'd like that, if he would
What did just say
() What did  just say about Larry Crowne
The class has stopped
It seems that Mercedes just said that last bit out loud and everyone heard it
The women eye each other
The men stifle laughs
Nothing
And  was just wrapping up here
'm so sorry
Please go on
Larry
It okay if  get to my climax and denouement
Larry nods
(') Thank you
If it was the romance novelist in him that made Victoria the Queen become such a pal, chalk it up as another brick in the legacy of Ben Disraeli -- Earl of Beaconsfield - Educator - and Prime Minister of Great Britain
Not bad for a Jewish guy, huh
Dibiasi is done
Applause

They all say Lala
It's unanimous
They start chanting her name
"La la

Larry sits her down in her chair and gets the other guys to pick her up like she's the bride at a wedding
It's a spontaneous party that Mercedes has to back out of
As she leaves, she looks back long enough to see Larry Crowne leading a parade around the room
1 - Everyone is taking the final
Dr
Matsutani
Looking around the class
Using his hands like a pair of binoculars
Lala is using a thesaurus and dictionary to polish answers
Larry is finished
He walks up to Dr
and hands in his Blue Book
The first to finish
No surprise
Dr
Matsutani hands Larry his confiscated phone
Larry leaves
107
'  - The final utensils are going into a box
Larry is doing this part himself
He sits for a moment -- in the breakfast nook -- surveying his kitchen, what was once his
Mack comes in with a box of his 's
This is the last of them
Damn, you have a lot of records
Priceless at a buck apiece
'  - His furnishings are out on the lawn
Lamarr and Patience are looking them over
Mack and Dibiasi are putting the last of his things into Mack's huge  and Larry's car
two-bedroom apartment and you don't have room for your furniture
Selling this futon-sofabed
All those years across the street and you've learned nothing
() What's the minimum you'll take for this stuff
You'll get me top price
You did learn
Pizza at last
Here's lunch as promised
The     pulls up in a different car but the same sign

Son of a cock

The Pizza guy is none other than Jack Strang

Wow
This is irony
Two extra large

Box of Frosty Cinnamon Eggs

Larry hands him the coupon and a Twenty

Times are tough
Tell me about it
Ah
Forget it
Keep the change
Strang leaves
Larry watches him go

That could have been '   - Raul and Perry are talking when they see Mercedes Tainot enter
My next wife just walked in
Perry looks

Larry is arranging his station

Larry, your Speech 217 teacher has a question about the menu
Larry can see her
She looks gorgeous

There's Larry Crowne
Are you allowed to sit

You killed on the final and have an
Way to go
She offers him a Terrorist Fist Bump
With the hand that no longer has a wedding ring on it
(') Actually, everybody got an , but you got the special  where  tell you in person
Didn't expect that
Thanks, Mrs
Tainot
Class is out

Or Mercy, for short

Just wanted to congratulate you
Your girlfriend will be thrilled

Cars not much
Devices some
They rise
'   -   - Mercy is opening her door, starting her car
Please enter your destination
Oh be quiet
That's a MapGenie
111
It is Hellspawn
In my old job, 'd have steered you to a Vortex unit
The MapGenie interface is clumsy and the menu needs too many inputs
He is reaching into the car, across her to tap the unit
It was working fine
Then  think pressed too many buttons

While he was doing that, Mercedes was smelling what she could of Larry
She liked it
She looked at his neck, his ears
And smelled him
(') How long was this broken
Seemed like years and years
All better now
Should be able to find your way
Nothing to do now but say goodbye
They hear a pounding
Raul is at the window inside the cafe, signaling the break is over
(') My Boss
Back to work
() Thanks for the good news
'   - Perry greets him at the door
112
Kimosabe, holding off til after school to woo the teacher is the move of a class act
Larry turns to watch Mercedes drive away
- The sign says "New Term Beginning
$20 a unit
Ask about Financial Aid
" Did you notice
The cost of an education just went up
- Mercedes has just written "Care" next to "Welcome to Shakespeare
" up on the board
She turns
And does a quick head count
Only 6 students are enrolled
She's going to lose this one, again
Clumps up the wooden steps are heard
Calimeris, Mack, Pinedo, and Dibiasi come tramping in
Twelve students now
(on his phone) gotta get off, Baby, or 'm in hot water with Professor Tai-bo
Mercy does a Shakespearean dance of joy
Is Larry with you
Um, no
Should we track him down and drag him in here
Mercedes does her best to hide her disappointment
Seeing you all
just thought
() Choose a seat and lets get started
The four smile at each other
113
Carrying a torch for Larry til it burns her hands
- Mercedes is walking to another building, another class
She may not realize it, but she is looking for Larry Crowne
Busik is busy chatting her up
Seriously chatting her up
All the excitement of first day of term,  don't want to go back to my empty apartment
Do you
need a drink and some talk and some wind- down time
Don't you
(
) Ms
Tainot
She turns
Dr
Larry Crowne is taking six units from me, devouring the material like a starving man
Larry's enrolled
He's continuing his education and tells me it is because of you
That your class changed his life
Mercedes finds herself smiling -- beaming
Larry said that about me
Oh yeah
put that guy in your class
So technically,  changed his life
He is a good student 114
And handy on a scooter
() Is there any chance you would consider having drinks with an older faculty peer who holds a PhD in Economics
Well, no
No offense Dr
The rumor is you are newly single and  was just taking a shot
Mercy looks right at Busik
News travels fast
Busik pretends he knows nothing
If you're going out, 'm not doing anything
Have you ever been to Hooters
For the spicy wings, yes
'   - There is a note on Mercy's car
She takes it
"To test your MapGenie: 4225 Harbor Blvd
2nd floor
An '' student
" Her breath catches in her heart
'  - Mercedes is driving
Right Turn
Got it Turning right 115
Your destination is ahead on the right
It is
That was a breeze
Thank you
'   - Open for business with bunting and everything
Talia is eating take out sushi and reading the soy sauce packet
She is tying to check out her ass-crack tattoo to see if it really does say 'Soy Sauce'
Mercedes has arrived
Talia sees her and comes out
Lamarr is around
Patience, too
We might notice that Dell Gordo and Larry now dress exactly alike, as we've seen the same jacket once on Lance Corona
love that blouse with that skirt but 'd show more leg if  were you
'm Mercy Tainot Bambi Romp in the Glen
Looking for Lance
4225 Harbor
This is 4227

You'll see the stairs
The tattoo parlor
Larry's scooter is right in front
As she goes
(') Little higher heels'll get you wolf whistles
116
- Music is playing
nice view is revealed as Mercy arrives on a nice little porch
On a little table sits a potted plant
In the potted plant is an Altoids tin
Mercy gives it a rattle
In the tin, a brand new key
Mercy takes the key
Slides it into the lock and slowly opens the door
The music gets louder
She can't see much into the tiny flat, but she can make out
Larry, arranging the last of his stuff
Mercy stands at the door until he sees her
When he does, he says nothing
But steps to her and smells her - her neck, her hair
Did you tell Ed Matsutani taking my class changed your life
Yes
How
met you
That's it
They kiss
Damn fine whammy kiss
'  - No larger than the nook of his old house
Breakfast is being served
The most beautiful woman ever to wear a bathrobe has made French Toast and is settling into the Breakfast Nook
Larry Crowne has his hair all on one side of his head -- post- Afternoon-Of-Amok-Loving
His arm shows a Navy tattoo that may be old or new
Mercy Tainot glows in and out
She slides next to him, close to him The meal is perfect 117
- Mercy is still in her robe, riding on Larry's scooter, back and forth in front of the Parlor and Talia's store
Larry is having coffee, sitting on the steps, watching her ride back and forth
She is getting good
Talia and the gang spill out of the store to watch her
Hoots and laughter
Larry uses his robe as a matador's cape, Mercy as the bull
As she passes under his flaring cape
