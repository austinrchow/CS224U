by Ronald Harwood adapted from the play by Ronald Harwood Final Draft, 1988 : (1944) - man conducting Beethoven
Air raid in progress
Bombs falling nearby
The orchestra continues to play
Suddenly the lights go out
The music stops
,   - beam from a torch, bouncing, making shadows
An , carrying the torch, hurries down the corridor
The air raid continues
He comes to a door, knocks, opens it and looks in
(agitated) Dr
Furtwangler, the Reichsminister
The sound of heavy footsteps approaching
The attendant turns his torch to light the way for three men in Nazi uniform, also with attendants and torches, marching down the corridor
The attendant bows deeply as the  and his aide go through the door
The other man remains in the corridor on guard
'  - Candles light the room where the conductor shakes hands with the Reichsminister
Dr
Furtwangler,  want to apologise personally for this power failure
was so enjoying the performance
In times like these we need spiritual nourishment
bomb explodes nearby
But  welcome this unexpected opportunity of talking to you
(with great care) When you came on to the platform tonight,  thought you weren't well
You looked tired, (a warning) Get away from this bombing
Away from the war
Yes, you look tired
(a crooked smile) Even in this light
- Dark
: scenes from Leni Riefenstahl's triumph of the will
Over this: ' Look at them
Men, women, kids
Boy, did they love him
You see, Steve, Adolf Hitler touched something deep, real deep and savage and barbaric, and it won't just go away overnight
It's got to be rooted out
You know what  think
think they were all Nazis
And let's face it, their leaders, those bastards now on trial in Nuremberg, couldn't have done it alone
It's these people, they gave all the help that was needed
Willingly
The film changes with a scratchy music soundtrack - Wagner
of high-ranking Nazis in an audience including Josef Goebbels, listening
And they're listening to and watching Wilhelm Furtwangler conducting
At the appropriate moment: ' That's him
Furtwangler
Wilhelm Furtwangler
The Nazis applaud
Goebbels shakes hands with Furtwangler
The film ends
Sitting in the ruined cinema are two men:  , with files on the table, and, beside him, is standing in the door of the projection room
So, you never heard of him
Nope
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is
Sure
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger
In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one
Jeez, and  never heard of him
Wallace glances at the file
You were in insurance before the war
Right
Claims assessor
Conscientious, determined, dogged
(amused) They said  was dogged
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it
(looks up at Steve
) Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although would like to; it's an impossibility
So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture
Like this bandleader
(a smile) Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve
He's a great conductor, a gifted artist
But we believe that he sold himself to the devil
Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party
Don't be impressed by him
want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war
Find Wilhelm Furtwangler guilty
He represents everything that was rotten in Germany
Steve wants to rise, but Wallace puts a hand on his shoulder to make him sit again
Stay put, Steve
There is some other stuff that 'd like for you to see here
Background
He nods to the projectionist, then starts to go, but stops
Oh, one thing that may be a problem
Our Occupation Authorities in Wiesbaden have a duty to help these poor unfortunates with their defence
They keep repeating: 'We must be just, we must be seen to be just
' Well, 've only one thing to say to the liberals in Wiesbaden: fuck 'em
(as he goes) You answer to no one but me
Is that understood
(to the projectionist in the door) Show him the film
Yes, sir
Roll it
Wallace goes
The projectionist starts the next reel
: a Berlin sequence
Bombs falling
Ruins, a city devastated, empty
Flags of the four allied nations
Posters of Truman, Stalin, Churchill
That is the hand that dropped the bombs on defenceless Rotterdam, Brussels, Belgrade
That is the hand that destroyed the cities, villages and homes of Russia
That is the hand that held the whip over the Polish, Yugoslav, French and Norwegian slaves
That is the hand that took their food
Steve watches expressionless
Next reel, please
:  of camp survivors
Then  of emaciated corpses being bulldozed into mass graves
Sanitary conditions were so appalling that heavy equipment had to be brought in to speed the work of cleaning up
This was Bergen Belsen
The moment this appears, Steve rises and goes quickly
: piles of cadavers
'  (I945) - Steve having a nightmare, twisting, turning, moaning
He wakes with a cry
He is sweating
He turns on the light, looks at a clock, reaches for a cigarette, lights it
He smokes
He stares at the ceiling
Later: Early morning
Cold
Steve is at the basin in his small room, shaving
radio on a shelf
Remember, men, no fraternisation
In a German town, if you bow to a pretty girl or pat a blond child, you bow to all that Hitler stood for
You bow to his reign of blood
You caress the ideology that meant death and destruction
You never know who was a member of the Nazi Party
Don't be fooled
Don't fraternise
'  ,  - Steve's car swerves round the corner and comes to a halt
small crowd watch workmen on ladders hammering away at a stone swastika above the portico
American soldiers supervise
Steve gets out of the car, carrying an attache case, and he, too, watches as the stone swastika falls and crashes into pieces on the road
One or two people clap, most just stare
The American soldiers immediately hoist the Stars and Stripes
Steve goes into the building
The sentry salutes
The driver of the car goes to the trunk and takes out a labelled duffel bag, cans of film, a case which holds a 16- mm projector
small  sidles up to him: Cigarettes, chewing gum
- Steve and Sergeant Adams ascending a grand, winding but damaged staircase to the rear of a spacious entrance hall
once impressive building
Signs of bomb damage everywhere
German workmen doing repairs
American military personnel coming and going, saluting Steve, who barely acknowledges them
They reach the landing
Adams opens double doors and they go through
We're gonna have the heating fixed by tonight
few gilt chairs, a workman trying to repair the stove
Adams opens another door for Steve
- is hanging the standard photograph of President Truman on the wall
She turns to see Steve and Adams and is covered with confusion
She gives Steve a little curtsey
Fraulein, this is Major Arnold
Sir, this is your secretary, Fraulein Emmi Straube
Her file's on your desk
They sent her over from Admin
'll leave you to it
He goes
Steve scrutinises Emmi
She's embarrassed, keeps her eyes downcast
Steve goes to his desk, opens a file, reads
You live here, in Berlin
Yes
You do shorthand and typing
Yes
He nods, goes on reading
Okay, let's see
How long were you in the camp for
Three months
Says here because of your father
What's that mean
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler
They arrested the plotters and their families
Your mother, too
Yes
She suffered longer
She was in Ravensbruck
And your father was executed
She nods, keeps her eyes averted
He smiles sympathetically
'm gonna call you Emmi, you're gonna call me Steve
Okay
No response
got a list of stuff here 'd like you to get for me
He searches his pockets
If you need anything, let me know
Major
Steve
There have been messages for you
(She consults the pad
) Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden
don't know who he is
Steve starts to unpack his attache case
Then there have been three calls from Dr
Furtwangler wanting to know when you wish to see him did not speak to him personally
She hands Steve a typewritten sheet
He ignores it, finds a list which he hands to her
He waits for her to read, then: Think you can get me any of that
(pleased) Oh yes, Major,  have recordings of all his symphonies
kept them safe during the bombing
My favourite is the Seventh Symphony
Mine's the Eleventh
(puzzled) But
he only wrote nine, Major
'm kidding, Emmi
What about a record player
You have that, too
No
Ours was damaged
(surveys the room) What's in those files
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires
Major, what am to tell Dr
Furtwangler
You tell him nothing, Emmi
If he calls again, you say you know nothing
We're gonna keep him waiting while  get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses
And, God help me, with Beethoven
He smiles
She tries to smile back
,  - Freezing weather
narrow street, crowded, busy, noisy
Some makeshift stalls set out, trestle tables, open suitcases, people buying and selling every imaginable commodity
Emmi wanders through the crowd, passing a violinist, Helmuth Rode, wrapped up against the cold, playing Handel's Air on a  String, a bowl for money at his feet
passer-by drops a cigarette butt in it
Immediately, Rode retrieves the butt
Emmi comes to a stall selling piles of gramophone records
She asks the stallholder a question
He points to another stall across the way
'  - Steve at his desk, paging through files
knock on the door
Yeah
Lieutenant  , aged twenty-four, enters, comes to Steve's desk, stands to attention, salutes
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold
Sir
For Chrissakes  hate that shit, cut it out
'm very sorry
'm Steve
What's your name
David
David Wills
'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee
Sir
Sounds a lot of run
(studies David
) So they sent the big guns to check up on me
We recruiting children now
(smiles') guess so, sir
You call me sir again and 'll make you listen to Beethoven
David half-smiles
Where you from, David
was born here, in Leipzig
escaped in '36
My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia
They were to follow
But they delayed and
Breaks off
Nothing from Steve
Our family name was Weill
But that doesn't sound well in English
My uncle changed it to Wills and
The door opens and Emmi enters carrying a record player, sees David and starts to back out
'm sorry
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too
Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills
They nod briefly
He is here to watch over us
flick from Emmi
guess you admire musicians
Some
Don't
This is like a criminal investigation, David
Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks
They're all the same
For Emmi's benefit too
She becomes still, listens
We have a duty, a moral duty
David takes a few files, sits and starts to look through them
Steve returns to his files
Emmi, by now, has put on a record and starts to play it: the opening of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony blasts out
The two men look up, startled
Emmi beams: It works
Hallelujah
'  - Emmi at the door
Steve at his desk
David present
Herr Rudolf Werner
enters, bows to Steve and David
Emmi goes to her desk
Sit down, Werner
Indicates the upright chair; Werner sits
want you to understand why you're here
This is an investigation into Wilhelm Furtwangler, former Prussian Privy Councillor, banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24 and who's applied to come before the Tribunal of Artists of the Denazification Commission
'm interested in what he was up to from 1933 to the end of the war, understood
Werner nods
Rudolf Otto Werner
Wind section since 1936
What instrument did you play
First oboe
have your questionnaire here
It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party
Absolutely not
Long silence; Steve watches him
Werner is made more anxious
At last, in a rush: No,  was never a Nazi,  have no interest in politics, 'm a musician - Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say
Werner swivels round to look at Emmi
Straube
Any relation to Colonel Joachim Straube
My father
It's a great honour to meet you, Fraulein
Your father was a great patriot
Brief silence
Dr
Furtwangler is a great musician
He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor
It was Hermann Goering
was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked
Although Dr
Furtwangler stood up to him
And to Dr
Goebbels
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute
He kept his baton in his right hand
In Hitler's presence
That was a brave act
Brave
To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute
Bravo
It was Beethoven's Ninth
Do you really think it was brave
Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand
'  - Another man, , is in the chair
Only Steve and Emmi now
Pale, yellow electric light
Silence
Schlee, too, is very nervous
At last: No, no, no,  give you my word was never a member of the Nazi Party
Never
am in the percussion section
play the timpani
Steve just stares at him
Anyway, they would never have allowed it
My brother was married to a Jewess, may she rest in peace
And Goebbels said
(to Emmi) please take this down carefully, because it's most important, Fraulein
Straube
(acting surprised) Straube
Are you by any chance related to Colonel Joachim Straube
My father
He was
he was a great hero
Steve lights a cigarette
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr
Furtwangler has not intervened
' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr
Furtwangler
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday
He was forced to do that
But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler
He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand
And what about the Nuremberg Rally
No, we
we played on the evening before the Rally
(straight-faced) Oh
The evening before,  see
Yes, Dr
Furtwangler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate
Politics and art must be kept separate
'll remember that
But let me see if you can help me with something  just don't understand
'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him
What's his secret
Schlee tries to find words
Well, it's hard to explain
can only tell you from my own experience
Soon after  joined the orchestra, we were rehearsing the Third Symphony of Beethoven, the Eroica
There are several rather difficult passages for the timpani
One particular crescendo
During the break,  asked how he wanted it played
He was studying his score
He didn't look up
He said, 'Just watch me
'  So, of course, did
never stopped watching him
The moment came
And suddenly, he turned to me and our eyes were locked
There was something in his look that
that simply demanded the crescendo
shall never forget his look
It was a moment of
of magic
Steve nods, thinks for a moment
Then: You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech
've seen 'em on films
Yes
Was looking at Furtwangler like that
don't know what you mean, Major
When you got to the crescendo
Schlee looks at him bewildered
/
(),    - In the back, David and Steve
Military driver
The car's making its way along a road that skirts a lake towards a grand mansion from which fly the four Allied flags
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated
guess it's possible
So, what does the Russki want
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you
'Dim-shits'
- huge, cavernous room, once the ballroom
In the centre, a table with four chairs
To one side, antique furniture, objets d'art, paintings
Four Allied officers are surveying the treasures:  , (American),   (British) and (French)
What they say is barely audible, low mumbles
They're accompanied by aides with clipboards, taking notes
Beyond, and some distance away, a row of gilt chairs for observers where David and Steve take their seats
What the hell are they doing
(whispered) They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories
Who really owns what
That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side
Dymshitz, small, intelligent face, cunning eyes
' art historian, head of the famous Leningrad Museum of Art
He is an expert on German culture
Green, correct, formal, precise, immaculate
Richards, bespectacled and nondescript
Vernay, upright, proud
(suddenly raising his voice) Je suis navre, Colonel, cette peinture n'est pas la propriete de 'union sovietique mats bien cette de la France
What's he saying
Henri, what is you saying
He's saying that picture is the property of France 'est un Braque qui avec Picasso etait un des pionniers du cubisme
(in French) know who Georges Braque is, Captain
(almost simultaneously) It's a Barque
We can produce the provenance of this Braque, you say provenance
/
- Outside the club room for the participants
Buzz of conversation, clink of glasses, cups
The terrace is deserted
waiter carries a tray with various refreshments to a quiet corner where Dymshitz, Green, Vernay, his aide , Steve and David sit in comfortable armchairs
The waiter serves them
During this: Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz
'm glad to see you
Colonel
Pleasure
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr
Furtwangler
Not yet
've had two meetings with him
He's a great musician
Maybe the greatest conductor in the world
His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled
Steve makes a non-committal gesture
'll come straight to point
've offered him a very attractive position
Conductor of the Staatsoper Unten den Linden
He refused
But  want him
want him badly
And  want your help
Hey, just a moment, you should have discussed this with me first
'm discussing it with you now
Major,  want you to drop your investigation, save everybody time and trouble
We can't drop a case just like that
'll give you another conductor in exchange or writer, musician, actor what
what do you care
But like Furtwangler
He's my favourite conductor
(chuckles
) Mine and Hitler's
He's our favourite conductor
- Rode is seated, waiting
Nervous, tense
The sound of laughter, David's laughter from the office
It makes him even more uncomfortable
'   - Emmi and David laughing
clicked my heels, saluted and bowed at the same time
He demonstrates
She laughs again
That's because you had a proper upbringing
That's right
was raised very strictly
So don't speak before you are spoken to
Oh
And don't wave your hands about
Respect your elders and your betters
And no elbows on the table
Eating is eating
and
And talking is talking
Well, think we better get on
Right
So, this is going to be very formal, too, now
Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares
She smiles just as Steve bursts in
He's in a bright, cheerful, energetic mood
David draws back guiltily
Emmi, embarrassed, hesitates then turns to the typewriter and types furiously
Seeing this, Steve stops, but just for a brief moment
Then, as he goes to his desk: David, need to ask you something
You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive
Yes
So what is it
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've
they've discovered his secret archive
What's that mean
don't know, but the British are excited about it,  know that
The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich
Jeez
And you think the British'll share it with their Allies
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know
That's big of him
He looks from David to Emmi as if trying to work out something
Then: Okay, better question the next witness
bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes
Five minutes
It's a bet
You're the witness, Emmi
Later
Rode in the witness chair
Steve studying the file
David and Emmi ready to take notes
Helmuth Alfred Rode
Second violinist since 1935
What's it mean, second violinist
It means  wasn't good enough to be a first violinist
He chuckles, looks around for approval
Steve grins encouragingly
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party
Me
Never
Never
Long silence
know everyone now says they were never Nazis but in my case it is absolutely one hundred per cent true
am a Catholic, it would have been totally against my conscience
Silence
Steve lights a cigarette; Rode eyes it hungrily
Is it true you're going to interview Dr
Furtwangler today
'll ask the questions, Helmuth
Excuse me
Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience
Steve flicks David a glance, waggles his finger like a baton
The problem was how could he avoid giving the Devil's salute when Satan was actually sitting there
(modestly taps his chest with his thumb
) And,  said, 'Dr
Furtwangler, why not enter with the baton in your right hand
Hitler will be sitting in the front row
If you give the salute with the baton in your right hand it'll look like you're going to poke his eyes out
' Chuckles
David mouths  win to Steve
He was
He was really grateful to me for that
After the concert, stole that baton as a memento of a great act of courage
still have it
should have brought it to show you
hope 'm not going too fast for you, Fraulein
- Straube
Steve and David exchange a brief look
Straube
Any relation to Colonel Joachim Straube
My father
(standing) am deeply honoured to be in your presence, Fraulein Straube
Your father was a true patriot, a man of God
He crosses himself
Silence
David raises a discreet finger
You have a question for Helmuth, David
Yes
What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th
Do you know Hans Hinkel
(alarmed) Do  know Hans Hinkel
That's what  asked
Do  know Hans Hinkel
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it
Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could  know such a man Brief silence; a smile
hear the British have his
his archive, files, records
Do you know what's in this archive
How could  know what's in the archive
Steve nods, smiles
Okay, you can go now, Helmuth
Get out
Rode stands and bows
'  - The final bars of the Fifth Symphony
Snowing
Dim light
There is more furniture now: two chairs, one comfortable, the other upright
sitting area by the window with the telephone extension
The 16-mm projector set up in another corner
Steve, at his desk, wrapped up against the cold, going through files, making notes
He stops, seems to listen, then goes to the window, looks out
The music ends
The record hisses
Steve just stares out at the night and the snow
The record continues to hiss
/ ,  () - The tram packed to overflowing
Then, a sudden stir among the passengers as people push through trying to find space
One of them is
He's recognised
Whispering
He stares ahead or keeps his eyes downcast
An elderly man tugs at his coat, half-rises, offering his seat
Furtwangler manages a smile and shakes his head
The tram rattles on
, '  - Furtwangler approaches Adams at his desk
He crosses to the stairs
German workmen stop what they are doing to let him pass
One of them bows
On the upper landing, Emmi is making her way to Steve's office
She stops, sees Furtwangler on the stairs and then dashes to Steve's door
Furtwangler
'  - Emmi bursts in on Steve and David
She's overawed: Major, Major
he's here
Shut the door, Emmi
Sit down, Emmi
We're going to keep him waiting, too
Emmi glances out again and reluctantly closes the door, Steve sits calmly, relaxed
Emmi, get us some coffee, will you
And, Emmi, don't offer him coffee
Don't even greet him, okay
- Furtwangler sits, waiting
Emmi, deeply embarrassed, hurries through
Furtwangler is about to ask her something, but she's gone
He waits
'  - Steve and David preparing papers
- Furtwangler waiting
Emmi enters from the landing door carrying a tray and three mugs of coffee
She hurries towards the office door, eyes downcast
Fraulein
Emmi stops
How long am  to be kept waiting
Emmi bites her lip and, without looking at him, disappears into the office
Furtwangler closes his eyes, breathes deeply
He stands, goes to the window, looks out
'  - Silence
Steve studying his notes
David watching him
Emmi staring forlornly into space
Okay, Emmi, go get him
Emmi rises, opens the door, nods, turns back to Steve
Dr
Furtwangler
Furtwangler enters
As he passes her, Emmi gives him a small curtsey
David nods
Steve doesn't look up
Furtwangler waits a moment, glances round, sees the more comfortable chair and sits in it
Steve looks up
didn't hear anyone invite you to sit down
Furtwangler stands
Steve points to the other chair
Sit there
Furtwangler sits
want you to understand why you're here
You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24
We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission
You understand that
have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit
Okay
have your questionnaire here, (reading) Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwangler, born Berlin, January 1886
Orchestral conductor
And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party
That is correct
very long silence
When the silence is unbearable Steve speaks
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor
How did that happen to a non-Party member
received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor
was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse
After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, stopped using the title
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you
But then  suppose you had no choice there either, because  suppose Dr
Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr
Vice-President
don't think Dr
Goebbels sent me a telegram
was simply told
In a letter,  believe
don't remember exactly
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you
One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture
was simply a pawn
Anyway,  resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra
In 1934
David puts up a hand
Steve nods
Why was that
Why did you resign, Dr
Furtwangler
wrote an open letter to the newspapers condemning what they were doing to music, making these distinctions between Jews and non- Jews
For my part, the only divide in art is between good and bad
Eventually, Goebbels summoned me and told me  could leave the country if  wanted to but under no condition would  ever be allowed to return
always believe that you have to fight from the inside not from without
asked myself, what's the duty of an artist, to stay or to leave
And then Goebbels demanded that  acknowledge Hitler as solely responsible for cultural policy
Well, that was a fact and it seemed pointless to deny it simply acknowledged that Hitler and the Minister of Culture appointed by him were solely responsible for the cultural policy of the Reich
What  wanted to express was that , personally, had no responsibility whatsoever for their cultural policy
have always had the view that art and politics should
should have nothing to do with each other
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies
(flaring) did not conduct at at the rally, conducted on the evening before the rally
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm
And what about April 19, 1942
The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you
Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other
(flustered) That
that was a different matter, was tricked
How come
Could  have a glass of water, please
Please, Fraulein
Straube
Steve looks expectant but Furtwangler remains silent
Steve nods to Emmi, who gets the water
Furtwangler drinks
Steve waits
Thank you
was in Vienna, rehearsing the Ninth Symphony of Beethoven, when Goebbels called and said  had to conduct at Hitler's birthday
'd always managed to wriggle out of such invitations, pleading previous engagements, illness, having my doctors state  was not well and so on and so on
was also fortunate that Baldur von Shirach, who controlled Vienna, hated Dr
Goebbels and would do anything to thwart his wishes
But this time Goebbels got to my doctors before me; they were frightened off, and von Schirach was threatened, bullied and gave in
So,  had no alternative but to conduct for Hitler
Believe me,  knew  had compromised, and  deeply regret it
(playing with him) Doesn't sound much of a trick to me
Sounds like you made a deal
made no deal
don't buy that
It's the truth
Silence
Steve paces
Then suddenly turns on Furtwangler
keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape
How did you do that
don't remember in detail, there were so many
Did you call someone you knew
may have, as
as  said, simply don't remember
Let me me help you, then
You picked up the phone and made a call - (Mimes a telephone
) 'Hello, Adolf
Wilhelm speaking
Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician  want you to help
He needs a permit to get to Paris
' Emmi sticks her fingers in her ears and shuts her eyes tight
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering
You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them
May  ask a question
Sure
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal
Your guess is as good as mine
need to work
need to make my living
live off the generosity of friends
Tough, tough
(now more and more agitated) Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while  have to wait and wait and wait
don't know, he wasn't my case
Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended
It was because  learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me
Why were they going to arrest you
believe it was because of another letter 'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies
You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right
No response
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr
Furtwangler, you should go abroad for a while
'  knew exactly what he meant
You sure knew a lot of people in high places
It would be truer to say,  think, that a lot of people in high places knew me
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert, (flaring) So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean
What was your Party number
If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework
You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are
Steve is stung
His eyes narrow dangerously
David, you remember  said  had a question that he wouldn't be able to answer
Well, 'm gonna ask it now
You ready for this, Wilhelm
It's a tough one
Why didn't you get out right at the start when Hitler came to power in 1933
Why didn't you leave Germany
No response
have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33
Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt
They were Jews, they had to leave
They were right to leave
(He breathes deeply, summons strength
) could not leave my country in her deepest misery
After all, am a German
stayed in my homeland
Is that my sin in your eyes
See, David
He can't answer the question
'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit
The telephone rings
No one moves
Then Emmi picks up the telephone
Major Arnold's office
Yes, he is
Offers the phone to David
It's Major Richards for Lieutenant Wills
David takes the telephone
David Wills
Yes, sir
(listens
) Well, you want me to tell him
Okay, (to Steve) Major Richards wants a word with you, sir
Steve indicates he'll take the call on the extension
Furtwangler stands
As Steve crosses to the extension: (muttering) Why can't he just ask for me
Why does he have to ask for you first
Goddamn British, so correct
He picks up the extension
Emmi puts down her receiver
Steve Arnold
've had enough of this, 'm leaving
He goes quickly
David dashes after him
-  Furtwangler is at the door when David reaches him
Dr
Furtwangler
Dr
Furtwangler
Please, please
(a warning) Don't
It's not advisable
The sound of Steve laughing with delight
Furtwangler hesitates
Emmi comes to the waiting-room door, watches, as if on guard
David comes round to face Furtwangler
(he gathers courage) When  was a child, my father, he took me to
he took me to one of your concerts
remember you conducted Beethoven's Fifth Symphony
was deeply moved
And 've loved music ever since
was grateful to you
And 've admired you
How could you
how could you serve those criminals
He falls silent
'  - Emmi, at the open door, has been listening
She's shocked, turns away to see Steve, on the extension, chuckling, grinning from ear to ear
How many
Jesus, that's dynamite
Okay
- David and Furtwangler haven't moved
Both are looking towards Steve's office and Emmi in the doorway
Again the sound of Steve's laugh
Then Emmi steps into the room, approaches Furtwangler
Dr
Furtwangler
He gives her a wonderful smile
And, suddenly, Steve stands in the doorway, smiling
Well now
Aren't we all sociable
The others are made awkward
've got to hand it to the British, David
You know what those guys are
Decent
(He sits, crosses his legs
) Tell me, Herr Dr
Furtwangler, do you know Hans Hinkel
Yes, a despicable human being
He was in the Ministry of Culture
His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts
Yup, that's him, that's the guy
You know what else the little creep did
He kept files, close on 250,000 files
And you know what's in those files
Certainly not, but  knew he had informers everywhere
Even in my orchestra there was someone Who
wasn't told
just knew it
How
(uneasy) was warned
Who warned you
(lowering his head) Goering
Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels
What did Goering say
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me
He read a report on me - everything said was quoted word by word
Oh boy, you're gonna love this
Take your time with this now
Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country
Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful
Furtwangler goes to the door
David opens it for him
Furtwangler nods, then turns to Emmi, bows to her and smiles
He goes
,   - Your name, please
David Wills
Over there
There is a long trestle table running the length of the room, with chairs, as if in a library
notice requests 'Silence'
British and American servicemen, a Russian and a French officer studying papers, making notes
At the furthest end, Steve, David and Emmi
Fantastic
The only condition is we have to do the work here want you to collect all the files on the boys in the band
,   - David discovers that the archive room was originally a synagogue
He is moved
He lays stones on the rail of what was once the ark
,   - Emmi and David surrounded by files, sifting through, making notes
They examine the Hinkel Archive
,   - Another day
Sunshine pouring in
Steve seated as before, but Emmi and David again in different places
Emmi rises, goes to Steve, shows him something
Maybe you can have a look at this
He reads
He is not pleased
He writes furiously
Emmi returns to her place
Suddenly, a movement causes Steve to look up
: David slides a note across to Emmi
Emmi reads the note
David watches her
She looks at him
She almost smiles, nods surreptitiously
(a whisper) Schubert
She feels Steve's eyes on her, and returns quickly to her work
Steve is displeased and even more suspicious
- Summer evening
The first movement of Schubert's String Quintet in  Major, D956, played by three men and two women to a large audience packed into the ruins, partly open to the sky, Dymshitz  among them
At the rear of the church, Emmi and David, enraptured, seated side by side
The first movement ends and the Adagio begins
After the music gathers momentum: Rain
Thunder and lightning
The musicians continue to play, unperturbed
They are coming to the end of the Quintet
David and Emmi huddled together
Some umbrellas up and then movement which catches David's attention
He nudges Emmi,  indicates with his chin
People have moved to reveal Furtwangler: seated, wearing a hat, still ' as a statue, soaked, listening, expressionless
Much applause
The musicians bow
The audience start to leave
Emmi and David emerge from the ruins
Furtwangler passes them
They nod awkwardly
He doesn't respond but is about to walk on when Dymshitz pushes through, nods to David, who salutes
Dymshitz catches up with Furtwangler
They are near to Emmi and David
Dr
Furtwangler - Furtwangler stops
Moving, you agree
Whenever  hear Schubert  am moved
You agree
The tempi were a little too correct for my taste
But  expect that is because of the rain
He nods politely, is about to go - (also for David's benefit) Wait, Doctor,  understand you have difficulties with the Americans
want you to know, am your champion
We can help
Furtwangler allows himself a faint smile, tips his hat, and then hurries off into the night
Dymshitz goes, too
David and Emmi watch them
Then: (frowning, worried) What does he mean, too correct
don't know
Huddled under their umbrella, they dash off
' ,   - Steve, fully dressed, lies on the bed in his small, shabby room, staring into space
He is suddenly startled by a loud roll of thunder and then a fierce crack of lightning
He goes to the window, watching the rain
He stands motionless for a second, then makes a decision
He grabs his cap, a raincoat from the back of the door
Another loud thunderclap
'  - Dancers jitterbugging and jiving
Among them, David and Emmi also dancing, imitating the others and having a good time
The music ends
Scattered applause
The band leaves the platform
The dancers return to tables or the bar
Later: David and Emmi at their table, eating
She eats voraciously, eyes glazed, all her concentration on the food in front of her
David is fascinated, can't stop watching her
Steve enters the club, makes his way to the bar, orders a drink
Steve turns to survey the room, almost at once spots David and Emmi, their backs to him
He observes them
David and Emmi at their table: They have finished their meal
Emmi is silent now, staring at her empty plate
Steve is suddenly at their table
Well, what is this, the office party
David and Emmi are frozen with embarrassment
May  join you
(sits down, beams
) So, what have you two been up to tonight
Hey
Don't  owe you a bottle of French champagne
Tries to get a waiter's attention but fails
No response
You know, David, you're a lucky guy
invited Emmi here but she turned me down
You must've hidden depths, David
he band starts to play; he stands, holds out a hand
'mon, Emmi, let's dance
'll teach you how to jive
She is horribly embarrassed, doesn't move
David suddenly stands and takes Emmi by the arm
'm very sorry, Major, but promised her mother, we have to go
They leave quickly
Steve watches them
He sinks down, angry and jealous
, ,    - David and Emmi enter the hall, each locked in their own thoughts
They reach the foot of the stairs and pause
They want to kiss but both are too awkward
She starts up the stairs
Don't see me to my door, there's no need
But  promised your mother
She stops, turns
Well, sleep well
She continues on her way
- Steve and Emmi at work on the files
One or two present, and David, who is working at the far end of the table
He has a cold
Emmi, who also has a cold, opens a file and is immediately alert
She reads
She blows her nose
She is uncertain
She looks up at Steve
She makes a decision
She rises, takes the file to Steve
Excuse me, Major
found this on Helmuth Rode
You remember
The second violinist
Look, he's Austrian not German
But it's this that's more important,  think
She points to something
Steve laughs loudly
Sssh
David looks up at them, puzzled
Then a British comes into the doorway
Lieutenant Wills, telephone - David rises and as he goes: (exasperated) What is this, a railway station
,   - In a booth near the front desk, David is on the telephone
(into telephone) David
Wills
Hello
Who
Who in Wiesbaden
Irritated, he taps the receiver but the line's gone dead
,  - Steve lies, shirt off, taking the sun
Children playing
Noise behind him of someone in the bushes
Steve doesn't move
Rode, carrying a slender leather case, pushes through to Steve, who remains with his eyes closed
Major
(eyes still closed) Helmuth
Guess what  am holding in my hand
You like guessing games
Love 'em, Helmuth
give up
What are you holding in your hand
Rode takes from the case a conductor's baton
Steve opens one eye
It's Dr
Furtwangler's baton, which stole
The one he kept in his right hand
Yes, you remember
Yes, you remember
How could  forget
Sits up, takes the baton
Somewhere a child laughs; suddenly Steve thrusts the baton at Rode
Show me
Show you
Yeah, show me,  want to see you do it
Pretend 'm Adolf
You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see
please, please, Major
Do it, Helmuth
After nervous looks over his shoulder Rode, salutes half- heartedly
Do it right
Rode thrusts his hand out in the Nazi salute
People by the lake: Mostly elderly, but some younger ones see Rode saluting
Some turn away
Others stare
' You look great doing that
Rode and Steve: Rode looks around nervously, lowers his arm
And  see what you mean
You nearly poked my eyes out
Exactly
Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret
ball comes bounding towards them
Steve catches it
Then a  runs in, looks hopeful
Mister, mister, here, here, mister
Steve tosses the ball back to him
Great catch, kid
The boy runs off
So
You wanted to see me
Steve pats the spot next to him and Rode sits
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth
Or should  call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one
What
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one
Or d'you mind if  just call you 'one'
Rode makes an attempt to go but Steve grabs him
You know what  say you are, Helmuth
say you're a piece of shit
Rode suddenly starts to retch
That bastard
People by the lakeside: Faces turning at Rode's sobs
Impassive
Blank
Steve and Rode: Who's the bastard, Helmuth
Hinkel
Rode nods
Why
He promised to remove your file
Rode vomits
And what about before that
What were you a member of in Austria
After a moment: Was a member of
Speak up
(barely audible) was a member of the Communist Party
was a communist
That's what Hinkel had over me
He knew everything
He held that over me
That's how he made me co-operate
Oh,  see, he made you co-operate
And now are you a communist again
(angry) You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - (he stops
) Brief silence
Steve stands
Further along the lakeside: Steve and Rode walk
People about
Boats on the lake
would never, in my wildest dreams, have ever been a second violinist in the Berlin Philharmonic
When they got rid of the
the Jews in the orchestra, it gave people like me a chance
- Rode rowing Steve in a small boat
Rode, exhausted, stops
The boat drifts
Steve watches him for a moment, then: Helmuth, you ever heard of plea- bargaining
Rode, trying to catch his breath, shakes his head
Talk about power,  have the power to give you work, make your life easier
Your past won't be mentioned
could give you a job tomorrow but  have to get something in return
See, Helmuth
That's plea-bargaining
No response
Rode keeps his head bowed
can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth
But  need something in return
Major, we're discussing a man of genius,  don't want
Fuck that, Helmuth
You want to discuss symbols here
This guy was a front man
He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning
'm not interested in small fish, 'm after Moby Dick
Come on, Helmuth
Hard facts
Silence
Then Rode slowly raises his head
The only thing  know is he's an anti-Semite
Of course
You, too
Like everyone else in this goddamn country
,  - Rode and Steve walking
Rode suddenly turns to him: 've remembered something else
Yeah
Furtwangler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday
He did
One of your people told me
One of my people
They start to walk away from the water
Yes
corporal
Army
Jew
He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery
Son-of-a-gun
We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram
He stops, takes out a cigarette, offers one to Rode, lights them both, gives Rode the packet
They smoke for a moment
But  need documentary proof
You know of anything like that
No
But that's why we hated him
We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us
He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad
He got everything from them, everything
He was filthier than any of us Party members
The sun is setting
Rode stops suddenly
There's a rumour
don't know if it's true or not
but ask him about von der Null
Never heard of him, who is he
Edwin von der Null
Music critic
He gave Furtwangler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan
Who's he
Also a conductor
Very brilliant
Young
Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'
Furtwangler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army
The same thing happened to another critic
True or not, it's not such a bad idea
Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front
(Chuckks
) But if you really want to get Furtwangler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan
The Miracle Kid
Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he
he refers to him as
Rode tries to make up his mind about something, then decides
He reaches into an inside pocket and takes out a small black notebook
And ask him about his private life
His private life
Rode hesitates, then he hands Steve the black book
Yes, it's all in here
His women
- Steve going along the shelves filled with files
He's at the , then , then
He stops at the letter
With his forefinger, he runs down the files
He stops, pulls out a fat file: ',
' He opens the file
: - the file: of an energetic-looking young man and two Nazi Party membership booklets
- David makes his way from the counter
He carries a tray with two cups of coffee
He goes to a table where sits, papers and files spread before him
David gives him his coffee, then sits across from him, blows his nose
Silence while they sugar and milk their coffee
David aware of Martin's eyes on him
Where do you stand on all this
On all what
On Furtwangler
don't know
He breaks off
You represent the United States now
We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too
Our duty is to help Furtwangler with his defence, (carefully) That's why  want you to look at this
(he selects papers from the table
) These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg
We can't get them translated fast enough
But  guess you understand German, right
Passes papers across to David
That's the evidence of a guy named Dahlerus
He's a Swede
Friend of Hermann Goering
want you to study it
And  want you to use it
David tries to sneeze but fails; he starts to read
We're going to find more stuff to feed you
We'll have some other suggestions
We need to build a case for the defence - based not on feelings, not on prejudice, but on facts
He watches David read
David is engrossed
Almost imperceptibly, he shakes his head
- half-ruined cafe with tables on the sidewalk
, the timpanist, , the oboist, and two others seated at one of the tables, drinking coffee
David carries an attache case and walks towards the cafe
He scans the people at the tables, sees the musicians and approaches
They stand
Lieutenant Wills
David nods Herr Schlee, timpanist, Herr Romer, cello and Herr Schmidt, viola
They are willing to help
We have already ordered ourselves coffee
hope you
Yeah, of course
The whole orchestra will vouch for him
He was always there to support us
We need names, if possible with addresses, because it's urgent
Names of musicians saved by Dr
Furtwangler, people he helped to escape abroad
Let's go somewhere public
David leaves money on the table and then walks off with the four men
They talk as they make their way down a side street
'  - Steve and Dymshitz sit opposite each other and clink vodka glasses
They have been drinking but are not yet drunk
To co-operation
They drink
Dymshitz pours more vodka
was in Vienna
had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps
We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything
said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em
'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major
These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics
' You get the point, Colonel
The point is they're all full of shit
Furtwangler's in a different category
We're dealing with degenerates here
He is still for a moment, then grabs the bottle and pours himself a drink, downs it
Dymshitz watches him, then: Degenerates
, '   - German modern paintings stacked untidily
Dymshitz, carrying a vodka bottle and his glass, shows Steve the paintings
Steve, too, has a glass
great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone
That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance
put that to him, he couldn't answer
Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini
Dymshitz pours vodkas, raises his glass, drinks
So does Steve
Now, their moods swing with the drink
Dymshitz drinks; then sits, sinks into his own world
(lost for a moment) Perhaps
perhaps he believed he could at least try to preserve something important, things like an orchestra, a school
That's his country
Maybe he has an old mother who can't be left alone
Maybe he has brothers, sisters
you can't
forlorn look at Steve
His eyes are misty, he is visibly drunk
(a wry smile) Colonel
He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship
Why
But what
before that turns rotten
What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel
(suddenly exploding) Don't talk about things you know nothing about
He was in a dictatorship
(dismissive) Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah,  heard all about that
(angry) In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party
If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra
And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power
All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises
This is what 'm saying
He must have had Party contacts
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you
Of course, they gave him privileges
Pause
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you
They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example
What museum
'm sorry
Museum
Not
said orchestra
Sorry
Believe me
(another sudden change of mood to earnest, intimate) Help me, Steve
You say you answer for someone from high up
, too, have orders from high up
Very high up
We want Furtwangler
'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors
need him, Steve
No can do
Let Furtwangler go
Please
have a duty
(flaring) Duty
am sorry, duty
Duty fucking duty
Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you
We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you
Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture
Dymshitz bursts out laughing
Stung, Steve advances on him, almost as if he's about to attack him physically
He stops, sways a little, then, after a moment, drops down in a chair near to Dymshitz
They drink
Intimate: 'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel
No deal
No fucking deal
Then you're going to kill me
'  - Drunk, Steve is clumsily, almost frantically, threading film into the 16-mm projector
He switches off the lights then stumbles back to the projector, turns it on and directs its beam towards a blank square of watt
It's an American military propaganda film
You'll see ruins, you'll see flowers, you'll see some mighty pretty scenery, don't let it fool you
You are in enemy country
The Nazi party may be gone, but Nazi thinking, Nazi training and Nazi trickery remain
Somewhere in this Germany are two million ex-Nazi officials
Out of power but still in there and thinking, thinking about next time
Remember that only yesterday every business, every profession was part of Hitler's system
Practically every German was part of the Nazi network
They believed they were born to be masters
Don't argue with them
You are not being sent Germany as educators
You're a soldier on guard
You will observe their local laws, respect their costumes and religion and you will respect their property rights
You will not be friendly
You will be aloof, watchful and suspicious
Steve, swaying slightly, watches, with the film continuing
- Bright summer's day
Emmi pushing her way through the crowded market
She comes to the stall with gramophone records
David is with her, staying behind a little so as not to disturb her
She starts to look through the records, blowing her nose from time to time
Then she finds a box of records, opens it, is delighted
She bargains with the stallholder, and she hands over money
She shows her purchase to David happily
They struggle on in the crowd
David suddenly stops
He has spotted a tandem
The bicycle with two seats is old and rusty but seems to be in working order
David steps up to it, touches it
- Two persons, Emmi and David, riding the tandem
Emmi in the front, pedalling, David behind
The road going up into the hills is full of potholes
They change seats
David is in the front, Emmi at the back
Suddenly the road begins to descend
They change again, Emmi sits in the front, David at the back
They speed down the hill
-   - The tandem, ridden by Emmi and David, rolls into a huge building, black and burnt out
In the middle of the vast hall, surrounded by the staircase, there is a Christmas tree, almost burnt to cinder
Emmi and David stare at it, mesmerised
Yesterday  read that Furtwangler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it
Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything
Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement
Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness
But you have no idea how people lived here
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased
don't know
But you and  already know that he has saved lives
'  - Steve and David studying files in silence
Furtwangler's baton is on Steve's desk
Steve drinks black coffee
Emmi enters
Curt nods of greeting
She goes to her desk, then takes the Bruckner record to Steve
Steve looks at the record, then glances up at Emmi
He does his best to exclude David, who tries to hear what is said
Emmi glances at David
She's embarrassed
Bruckner's Seventh, Major
Do you know where the Adagio begins
Of course
Put it on ready to play, and 'll tell you when to play it
He returns to his desk
Emmi looks through the album for the appropriate record
'  - Steve by the open window, looking at his wristwatch, smoking a cigarette
David and Emmi both watch him
The door opens and Furtwangler bursts in
It is now nine o'clock precisely
do not intend to be kept waiting again
(dangerously calm) Don't talk to me like  was a second violinist
Go back into the waiting room
Miss Straube will come and get you when  am ready to see you
Furtwangler goes out
Jesus God, who the hell does he think he is
Who the hell does he think he is
David and Emmi gaze at him as he tries to regain control
- The door to the landing is open and Rode is there pretending to sweep
He looks in to see Furtwangler sitting, holding his handkerchief over his nose and mouth
Would you perhaps like to have a glass of water, Herr Professor
Furtwangler doesn't seem to hear
Rode hesitates, then continues to sweep
'  - David and Emmi look at him, puzzled
She goes to the door, opens it, nods
Rode quickly disappears
Furtwangler looks at Emmi
What is this man doing here
Emmi doesn't answer
All eyes on the door
Furtwangler enters
Dr
Furtwangler
Come in, come in, sit down
Furtwangler, deeply suspicious, goes for the uncomfortable chair
No, no, take this one, it's more comfortable He holds the other chair for Furtwangler, who sits
If it's too hot, open your tie
(interrupting) wish to say something
Go ahead, be my guest
Furtwangler takes from his pocket a piece of paper with notes
He blows his nose
The room is warming up
It will become like an airless court room, a pressure cooker
When  last saw you,  was unprepared
did not know what to expect
In these past weeks, have been thinking more carefully and making some notes
(glances at the notes
) You have to understand who  am and what  am
am a musician and believe in music
am an artist and  believe in art
Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs must confess, however, to being extremely naive
insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics
My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because  thought that  could, through music, do something practical
And what was that
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty
'm going to try to remember that
Liberty, humanity and justice
Beautiful
But you used the word 'naive'
Are you now saying you think you were wrong
That art and politics can't be separated
believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate  learned to my cost
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram
Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag
What telegram
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm
' Or words to that effect
That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win
You're the number one man
Have a swell party
' have no idea what you're talking about
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider
never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings
Think carefully, Wilhelm
maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President
don't have to think carefully
This is utterly ridiculous
David and Emmi exchange the briefest of looks
David raises his hand
Yes, David
Why not show Dr
Furtwangler the evidence
It may refresh his memory
You won't find it because no such telegram exists
Well,  tried, you got to admit tried
thought  might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me
Smart move, David, smart move
No,  don't have the telegram, but  know it exists
And  want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because  believe you sent it
Then you are wrong
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics
Let's look at that
You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered
Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad
We always performed as a private ensemble
As  think already told you,  was a freelance conductor
You know something
You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity
What do you imagine people thought
The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate
Is that what you believed ordinary people thought
have no idea what ordinary people thought
No
No, because  had only one intention
My only intention whatever  did was to show that music means more than politics
Tell me about von der Null
(taken off-guard) Von der Null
Yes, von der Null
Von der Null
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm
say von der Null, you say von der Null,  say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day
You know who von der Null is, don't you
Edwin von der Nuell, music critic
Yes,  know who he is
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since
That's an outrageous lie
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me
The greatest conductor on earth want him out the way
He had the nerve to accuse me  am not playing enough modern music
Send him to Stalingrad
Isn't that what you did
You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm
You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you
Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels
(uncomfortable) Well
Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me
And what did he say
He said, 'Don't mind him
His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct
' And what happened to Von der Nul
have no idea
You've really no idea
'll tell you what happened
He died in Stalingrad
'm sorry
Now, that young conductor what's his name
(playing with Furtwangler) That miracle kid, you know who mean
Von Karajan
But you called him something else
'mon
What did you call von Karajan
Silence
Say it
Silence
'll say it, then
'Little
' Is that right
You couldn't even bear to say his name
Furtwangler rises angrily and starts to pace
Please stop playing these games with me
Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding
'll tell you why
You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday
And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked
Yes, that's what happened
He sits heavily, wipes his brow
He is sweating now
have a different story to tell
don't think you were tricked
Not in the way you describe believe something else happened
've seen the Hinkel Archive, 've seen records of phone calls, and putting it all together, this is what  think happened
think Goebbels said, 'Wilhelm, if you won't conduct for Adolf's birthday, we'll get the Miracle Kid, the guy that critic, von der Null, thinks is the greatest conductor in the world
He's not just willing to conduct for Adolf, he's offered to sing "Happy Birthday" as a solo
' Silence
Come on, admit it
worried you, didn't he
He always worried you
In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six
And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little will
' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because  don't care how great you are
It's the oldest story in the book, (a wry look at David) The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck
The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little
This is absolute nonsense
Well, 'm just beginning to develop my theme
Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme
Okay, so they played on your insecurity
That's human, understandable
But, there is one guy who doesn't like little  as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf
He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says,  want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm
So, Josef calls and threatens you with little
And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, 'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin
That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed
Hard
Why did you stay
Why did you play for them
Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime
Jealousy
(interrupting) Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad
Brief silence; all eyes on him
You see, Wilhelm, 'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons
Which is why  want to discuss your private life
How many illegitimate children do you have
Major,  don't see how this line of questioning could
David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now
( (to Furtwangler) Did you hear the question
(barely audible) have illegitimate children
What
said  have illegitimate children
don't know how many
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm
No response
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true
(indicating EmmI) Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant
You bet
and totally irrelevant
(continuing to Furtwangler) Not so, Counsellor
That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she
As many and as often as you wanted
Stop this, please, stop this now
No, 'm not going to stop it
Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter
absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter
But you see what 'm getting at
You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid
What are you gonna do, stay or leave
One voice comes back at me: stay
Major, that's not a good argument
If Dr
Furtwangler did indeed enjoy all these
these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is
That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world
But it still doesn't make them saints
They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they
They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me
Well, just like me
Can't they
No response
To Furtwangler: Okay, Wilhelm, go home now
Go home and think about these past twelve years
don't understand what you mean
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm
You understand nothing
We'll call you
Go
Furtwangler leaves
Major
Steve goes to his desk and, as Furtwangler rises uncertainly: What
Your manner
My manner
Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down
What's the matter, Emmi
What's going on with you
What's wrong
'm sorry but  have to leave
'll find other work
You'll have to get someone else, that's all
What is this, Emmi
can't do this
It's not right
What's not right
have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that
Just like you questioned him
Emmi, stop
want to show you something
Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please
His friends, they did this
And he gave them birthday concerts
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea
only realised what was really going on when  got arrested
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving
This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country
Why, if people had no idea
would like to go now, please
But Steve turns on the projector and the Bergen-Belsen film flickers into life
'  - Band playing
Couples dancing
David and Steve at the bar, each with a drink in front of them, lost in their own thoughts
Then: Steve signs to the barkeeper to fill their glasses but David puts a hand over his glass
Then: Can  ask you a favour, Major
Yeah
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect
With more what
More what
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect
(flaring, hissing) David,  don't understand a thing about you
You're a Jew
Are you a Jew
Yes, 'm a Jew
But  like to think first 'm a human being
human being, oh, good, 'm relieved,  thought you were going to say you were a music lover
This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe
got letters
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and 'll show you the gates of paradise
(over-reacting and overlapping) What is it with you, David
Where are your feelings
Where's your hatred, your disgust
Where's your fucking outrage, David
He starts to go, then comes back to them
Think of your parents, David, and then think of him conducting 'Happy Birthday, dear Adolf'
mean, for Chrissake, whose side are you on
Grow up
Just grow the fuck up
The customers stare at him as he stalks out
The band plays
: - David and Emmi, sitting
want you to come back to the office
May  come in
If you are there you can influence what happens
What good can you do by leaving
If you go, you are giving up and how can you help Furtwangler or me
Don't think about leaving
Stay
'  - Hot, Windows closed
Furtwangler seated
David and Emmi present
Steve looks up from his notes
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews
But-- (holds up a sheaf of papers
) have things here you said and wrote
Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International
' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music
' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots
' You deny you said these things
Those attitudes do not exist in me
believe that
But just answer the question, don't give me explanations
Speaking to Party members  used their language, of course  did, everyone did
(with some irony) Major, sorry to interrupt, but maybe we have to
maybe we have to balance those things against his assistance to his Jewish colleagues
Steve tenses
This is a transcript of the proceedings at Nuremberg
Swedish businessman, Birger Dahlerus, testified in cross- examination that he had several meetings with Hermann Goering
' first saw Goering,' Dahlerus testified, 'embroiled in a stormy interview with Wilhelm Furtwangler, the famous conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, who was vainly seeking permission to keep his Jewish concert master
Holds up his package of letters and dumps them on Emmi's desk
Emmi, pick one of these, any one, read it out loud
Emmi is uncertain
Steve shrugs indifferently
She picks an envelope and takes out the letter
(reading) 'Please remember that Dr
Furtwangler risked his life to help anyone who asked him personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help
He never turned anyone away
After he heard me play
am a violinist
he gave me money because  was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden
He helped countless people in similar ways
' And this, only one of these letters, Major
have lots of them
(smiling) How many times have  got to tell you  was in insurance
You think can't smell a phoney policy when it's shoved under my nose
Sure, he helped Jews, but that was just insurance, his cover, because all the while he was maestro of all he surveyed, (turning on Furtwangler) See, Wilhelm,  think you're their boy, their creature
You were like an advertising slogan for them: this is what we produce, the greatest conductor in the world
And you went along with it
The truth of the matter is, Wilhelm, you didn't need to be a member of the Party
made a mistake when asked you for your Party number should've asked you for your non- Party number
Just like some other well-known artists
(suddenly, to Emmi) Emmi, put that record on
Emmi puts on the record of the Adagio from Bruckner's Seventh Symphony
After a moment: Do you know what that is
Of course  know what that is
Okay, so what is it
Bruckner's Seventh
The Adagio
Who's conducting
am
You know the last time it was played on these air waves
How can  know such a thing
'll tell you, then
The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself
Listen to it
They listen
Did they pick little 's recording
Did they pick some other conductor
No, they picked you, and why
Because you represented them so beautifully
When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march
You were everything to them
The music plays
(near to breakdown but struggling for control) have always tried to analyse myself carefully and closely
In staying here,  believed  walked a tightrope between exile and the gallows
You seem to be blaming me for not having allowed myself to be hanged
David takes the record off
didn't directly oppose the Party because  told myself, that was not my job
If  had taken any active part in politics  could not have remained here
But as a musician,  am more than a citizen
am a citizen of this country in that eternal sense to which the genius of great music testifies know that a single performance of a great masterpiece was a stronger and more vital negation of the spirit of Buchenwald and Auschwitz than words
An uncontrollable surge of anger wells up in Steve, causing him to pace alarmingly
He grabs the baton from his desk, stands trembling before Furtwangler, and snaps it in half
He pushes his face close to Furtwangler, who recoils, terrified
David half-stands, ready to intervene physically
During this Emmi puts her fingers in her ears
(quiet, terrifying) Have you ever smelled burning flesh
smelt it four miles away
Four miles away,  smelt it
Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria
Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses
You talk to me about culture, art and music
You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm
You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals
They had orchestras in the camps
They played Beethoven, Wagner
The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families
don't understand the Germans' relationship with music
What do you need music for
Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated
Yes,  blame you for not getting hanged,  blame you for your cowardice
You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse
You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and  say to you, lies
(breaking down) love my country,  believe in music, what was  to do
Look around you
See the country you served
Look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives
Like Emmi's father
He sees Emmi has her fingers in her ears, yells at her
Emmi, take your fingers out of your ears
She does so
'm talking about your father
She screams
Stillness
All eyes on her
My father only joined the plot when he realised that we could not win the war
She cries quietly
(desperate) What kind of a world do you want, Major
What kind of world are you going to make
Do you honestly believe that the only reality is the material world, so you will be left nothing, nothing but feculence
more foul-smelling than that which pervades your nights
(near to breakdown) How was  to understand, how was to know what they were capable of
No one knew
No one knew
He breaks down, buries his face in his hands, weeps
don't want to stay in this country
Yes,  should have left in 1934, it would have been better if 'd left
He is suddenly overtaken by nausea and faintness, stands, a hand to his mouth
Emmi goes to him
Get him out of here
Emmi helps Furtwangler out
Steve strides to the window, opens it, puts his head out into the fresh air
- Emmi helps Furtwangler to a chair
She watches him solicitously
He breathes deeply
Thank you, Fraulein
You have been most kind
(he rises
) He smiles at her
She is embarrassed
'  - Steve is trying to get a number on the telephone
David is packing up his papers
David turns to the records, starts to son through until he finds what he's looking for
He removes the Bruckner and puts another record on the turntable
(into the telephone) Major Arnold
Get me General Wallace
General
Major Arnold, about Furtwangler
don't know if we've got a case that'll stand up, but sure as hell we can give him a hard time
At full volume the sound of the subdued opening of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony
(to David) Hey, turn that down, would you
Can't you see 'm on the phone
(into the telephone) Never mind, we got a journalist who'll do whatever we tell him
But David ignores him, sits, implacable, listening
'  - Furtwangler walks slowly down the stairs, a broken man struggling to regain his composure
Emmi watches him
'  - The music at full blast
David, at an open window, keeps his back to Steve, still on the telephone
Turn it off
- Furtwangler, on the stairs, stops, hearing the music echoing through the building
Furtwangler left hand begins to tremble, but it is only his way of sensing the tempo
Furtwangler slowly continues down the stairs
' We handed Wilhelm Furtwangler over to the civil authorities and he was charged with serving the Nazi regime, with uttering anti-Semitic slurs, performing at an official Nazi Party function and with being a Prussian Privy Councillor
Dr
Furtwangler was acquitted
didn't nail him
But  sure winged him
And  know  did the right thing
Furtwangler resumed his career but he was never allowed to conduct in the United States
He died in 1954
Little  succeeded him as head of the Berlin Philharmonic
() Furtwangler conducting
Goebbels and other high-ranking Nazis in the audience
When the music finishes, Furtwangler turns and bows
Goebbels rises and shakes hands with him
Furtwangler takes his handkerchief and wipes his hands
The film replays this gesture several times - Furtwangler wiping his hands
