href <b>// --> </b> Midnight Cowboy by Waldo Salt : - Susskind-type  is speaking into camera: Tonight we'll discuss a subject most of us seem to consider either bad taste or frivolous or funny
But if our experts are right, we face what might be called a masculinity crisis
Every fourth American man uptight, threatened by the increasing sexual demands of American women
- An   speaks into camera: They always put it that way, but well, all it means, you know, is every fourth American woman's never satisfied
That's it
never am -- have been, you know
- speaks into camera: This, this image of the, the man eating woman
It isn't our increasing demands
think it's the shrinking American male
- speaks into camera: No,  never had, well, whatever it is you call it
But the hours he works,  can't blame him
() - Full frame -- a scandal sheet picture of a sex-starved wife, naked while her husband sleeps, captioned '
' but it's a problem
big problem
With so many women know
Camera pulls back to show the picture among other pinups of women -- rich, beautiful or naked, but all blonde -- steam wilted on the wall over a dishwashing machine
grins at the wall as he scrapes garbage
Just keep your pants on, ladies
, gradually surrounded by lonely women
' Before World War One -- American men outnumbered women by over six percent
Today American women not only outnumber men, but live five years longer -- leaving them in control of vast corporate wealth and seventy-five percent of America's purchasing power
The Lady Commentator is replaced by Joe, stacking dishes, surrounded by frustrated ladies
He laughs tolerantly
'all,line up and take your turn
- The Moderator smiles into camera
My question is this -- will American know-how come up with a marketable male to replace all the men who are worrying themselves into an early grave over women's increasing sexual demands
- Joe sings as he soaps himself, "Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies, for you know New York will be your new home
" Sound and image freeze on Joe's open mouth
follow as indicated, sound and action continuing after each credit
- Joe's song continues over a sweating , glancing up
Where's that Joe Buck
- Wrapped in a towel, singing in front of his dresser mirror, Joe sprays himself with deodorant, aiming a last playful blast at the unseen crotch -- freezing song and image as continue over
a calendar girl on the wall blushing orange, mouth frozen in a tiny , staring wide-eyed
Joe's song continues as
Joe rips the wrapping from a new Stetson and sets it on his head, freezing song and image as  continue
- , an aging black man, faces a mountain of dirty dishes
Where's that Joe Buck
- Singing as he buttons his new cowboy shirt, Joe interrupts himself to answer Ralph
Yeah, where's that Joe Buck
continuing his song as he pulls up and zips his tight thighed black slacks, freezing song and image for
- , a pretty middle-aged blonde, smiles down at camera, You look real nice, Joe baby
- Joe sings as he pulls on his new cowboy boots, arranging his cuffs to show off the yellow sunburst at the ankle, freezing song and image for
- The pink  scowls at his pocket watch
Where's that Joe Buck
- Joe hums as he piles a complete wardrobe of cowboy clothes, still in their wrappers, into a shiny new suitcase of black and white horsehide
Yeah, where's that Joe Buck
- Holding his watch, the Manager wags a finger at camera
You're due here at four o'clock
Look at those dishes, look
- Joe laughs as he locks his suitcase
Know what you can do with those dishes
And if you ain't man enough to do it yourself, 'd be happy to oblige
Joe picks up his suitcase, a portable transistor radio, walks away from the mirror, then pauses to run a comb through his hair, hook a cigarette at the corner of his mouth and strike a match on his thumbnail before he turns back for one admiring glance at himself in the mirror -- proud, exultant, ready -- freezing the image as
- Joe leaves the hotel, carrying his suitcase
- The pink Manager points at his watch angrily
Four to midnight, understand
Angle widens to include Joe, holding his suitcase and radio
Ralph stares at him curiously, stacking dishes
Say, look, uh,  gotta have a word with you, if you got a second
Later
Later maybe
The Manager hurries away, carrying a basket of dishes
You ain't coming to work
Don't guess
Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you 'm heading East
Joe tilts his Stetson as the Waitress appears at the door
Cups
but she disappears without noticing Joe
Ralph offers his hand
Joe takes it, holds it
What you gonna do back there, East
Lotta rich women back there
Yeah
Men, they mostly faggots
Must be some mess back there
Well, ain't no use hanging around here
Ain't gonna collect your pay
got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money
(slaps hip) He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay
And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself,  be happy to oblige
- The door marked   swings open and Joe appears, measuring his effect on the customers and his fellow employees as he crosses the sterile white dining room, observing the drab details of the life he has left behind - garbage on greasy dishes, limp food in steam table trays, coffee-soaked cigarette butts, caked mustard and ketchup on formica table tops -- two pimply high school girls slurping suggestive noises after Joe through the straws of empty coke glasses
a Tiomkin-tradition chorus sings, "From this valley they say you are going -- we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile for they say you are taking the sunshine
" - The song ends as Joe comes from the cafeteria "
that brightened our pathway a while
" Tough tiddy, ladies, you had your chance
From a high angle -- Joe starts his long walk toward the bus depot along the street of a small Western town struggling to urbanize itself
The click-clack-click of his boots is loud but somehow lonely The radio at his ear drones grain prices on the Commodity change
Joe's pace slows as he passes
'   - a gilt-lettered sign in the window, glittering in the sun, momentarily hiding the fact that the shop is deserted
Joe grins as he hears remembered sounds and voices incomplete flashes, more significant in tone than content a girl giggling sexily -- "Keep your meat hooks off my beauty operators, sugar" -- tinkling noises of a busy beauty parlor - Sally Buck singing "Hush, little baby, don't say a word, Grammaw gonna buy you a mockingbird
" a shift of light revealing a row of tarnished driers, a broken mirror, a   sign in the window
Joe turns toward the bus depot, radio pressed to his ear
' Benson and Hedges One Hundreds makes special awards from time to time for anything that's longer than anything
Care to get out your yardstick, gentlemen
At the same moment, a recognizable variant of the "Big Country" theme blares loud
Gary Cooper (or John Wayne) walks a frontier street
- High angle of the departing bus, intercut "Big Country" fashion, alternating high shots with close-ups of the bus wheals
- Through the bus windshield -- a dizzying montage of traffic lines, arrows and signs as the bus sweeps around and up onto the freeway
- Joe sits at the front, opposite the driver, cracking his gum as he watches the huge billboards streaking by, promising him power, happiness and beautiful women if he chooses the right breakfast food, hair oil or automobile
Joe listens to the humming tires, the roar of the engine, shaking his head
This is a powerful mothah, ain't it
Ignored by the driver, Joe rises and walks back to his empty double seat, glancing around to see what impression he's made on his immediate fellow travelers -- an   in front of him -- a hostile young sailor with acne behind him -- two teeny-boppers flirting with Joe hysterically -- a directly across the aisle, smiling at Joe weakly
Do you have a stick of gum
Joe leans across, snapping his gum as he offers her a stick
He watches her nibble it daintily on her front teeth
(') Thank you
Plenty more where that came from
Thank you, no, it's just till the Dramamine works
get carsick
only get carsick on boats
(waits, then) But seems to me that's more the fish smell than the bouncing
Joe realizes that her eyes are closed
Mildly depressed, he stretches himself across both seats and turns on his radio, finds only static and snaps it off
Further depressed, he examines his reflection in the bus window, squeezes a black head and runs the comb through his hair, picks a piece of tobacco off his tooth and lights a cigarette, watching the flame die in reflection, forgetting to discard the burnt-out match as he stares out at a vast lonely prairie, a solitary cowboy in the distance, a row of sharecropper shacks apparently deserted, a barefoot little girl motionless at the roadside, watching the bus pass
Through this, leading into the next scene, Sally Buck sings softly "
if that mocking bird don't sing, Grammaw gonna buy you a golden ring
" - Sally Buck, relaxing in the middle of a busy day, eyes closed wearily, while little Joe massages her neck
Her song continues over the noises of the busy beauty parlor "
if that golden ring turns brass, Grammaw gonna buy you a looking glass
" No, a little lower, sugar, yeah, yeah, that's good
Grammaw's beat
' You gotta sell yourself, that's the whole trick
- seedy   with badly-fitted dentures and a frayed collar has taken the aisle seat next to Joe
As he lectures Joe on salesmanship, he figures his expenses in a worn leatherette notebook, nervous fingers and eyes unconsciously revealing the extent of his failure
It ain't the product and it ain't the price, no sir, and it ain't what you sell, it's personality, pure and simple
ain't shined my own shoes or shaved my own face in forty years, how's that
Not bad for a kid that didn't pass the eighth grade, right
Yeah, hell, yeah
And that's my golden rule
Make 'em love you
Put yourself over and you can sell them anything
If they like you, they'll buy horsemeat for prime beef
- gawky, adolescent Joe sits sprawled on the couch, leafing through a magazine while Sally Buck bleaches the roots of a young woman's hair
You get him to the church, honey
He ain't gonna find out you ain't a real blonde till after you're married, then's too late
Sally Buck turns, pretending to be stern as Toe laughs
(') You getting too big for your britches, sugar
- The headlights of the bus flash past a huge sign, painted on the slant roof of a barn:
- Joe is alone again
The Salesman has disappeared
The bus is dark, most-passengers trying to sleep
Only one reading light still burns, over the head of the old-Lady in the seat ahead of Joe
Joe squirms, restless, trying to lull himself to sleep with the music of a revivalist gospel group on the radio
' Don't forget to say your prayers, honey
Joe leans forward to help the old Lady, irritably struggling with the release button on her seat
She scowls as Joe leans over to release her seat, then pulls her blanket around her and turns away from him
Joe switches off her reading light
want it on
Joe switches it on again, fakes a good-natured grin, settles back with his radio, aware of an   seated opposite him, replacing the Pale Blonde
The Old Cowhand is appraising Joe's wardrobe curiously
He looks away when he sees Joe watching him
Joe settles back, unable to think of a way to open a conversation
' Oh, my friends,  say unto you, invest with Jesus, put your dollars to work where they'll pay off at compound interest
The Good Book says money answereth all things
The Old Cowhand has rolled-himself a cigarette
Joe quickly lights a match on his thumb and holds it across the aisle
Light
The Old Cowhand's "thanks" is lost in a fit of coughing as he inhales his first drag
He settles back, wiping his watery eyes on a faded bandana
' everyone who sends a dollar to the Evangelical Congregation of the Air will get free gratis a genuine leatherette hymn book so you can sing along with Sister Rosella and the Evangelical Choir
You throw in Sister Rosella and you got a deal, right, old timer
Joe glances across the aisle
The Old Cowhand manages a faint, humorless smile
(') Going far
Up the line
Not far
'm bound for New York City
The Old Cowhand reappraises Joe's wardrobe even more curiously
(') Ever happen to come across a cowman name of Woodsy Niles
Friend of my grammaw Sally Buck
The Old Cowhand considers, shakes his head
Joe leans back, laughing to himself
- Little Joe's head is lost in a beat-up cowboy hat, similar to the one worn by the old Cowhand
Sally Buck smiles on -- a long-legged cowboy with a shock of black hair -- who stands at her dressing table, admiring himself in a new Stetson
Like it, honey
Does it fit
You do me good, Sal, you do me real good
You know what  gonna give you for that Stetson
Woodsy grabs Sally Buck, lifting her off her feet, carrying her to the bed
Struggling, they fall across the covers together, Little Joe laughing with them
Woodsy Niles
The boy
He don't know what makes little apples by now, it's time he found out
- Joe shakes his head, grinning, offering the old Cowhand a cigarette
Smoke
The old Cowhand shakes his head, showing the rolled cigarette Joe lit for him
Joe nods, still bemused
- Little Joe is cuddled in Sally Buck's arms, under the covers, watching Woodsy, sitting cross-legged on the bed, naked except for his Stetson and guitar, singing drunkenly
git along little dogies
- From a high angle -- the bus slows to a stop
- Joe awakens, stiff-necked, momentarily confused
He straightens in his seat as he sees the old Cowhand lifting a sweat-stained saddle down from the overhead rack, starting toward the front of the bus
Joe calls after him
Nice talking to you, old timer
Joe stuffs a stick of gum in his mouth, turns to wave at the Old Cowhand through the window as the bus pulls away
' She-dogs squat, boy
He-dogs stand up and lift their leg
'  - Woodsy, in his new Stetson, watches Little Joe in his beat-up cowboy hat, trying to balance on one foot, one leg lifted in front of the trough
Woodsy roars with laughter
but he-men stand and shoot from the hip
- Joe laughs, flushes, checks his hair in the mirror
- The bus streaks past a brightly-colored billboard -- ,
- Joe is now sitting in the wide rear seat, between two young and a group of  wearing campaign caps and convention buttons, passing a bottle, singing "From the Balls of Montezuma to the Shores of Tripoli
" Joe follows the conversation between a  and a , participating only because he's sitting beside them, adopting a remembered military stance
Ever stationed at Kennedy
Those Florida chicks
Instant -goddam-
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built
Ten bucks she wanted
Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right
You got it
No
You got it
Jesus goddam Christ,  ain't laughed so hard since  was out at Fort Benning, Georgia
Did you make the Viet
What
Oh, hell no
Motor pool mostly
(shakes his head) Kee-rist
- plump, aging  laughs up into camera
Hey, hey, what you try to do to me
You gonna cost me money, soldier
- Joe laughs as he passes the bottle, trying to sing along without knowing the words as the Veterans segue into "Over hill, over dale, we will hit the dusty trail, as the caissons go rolling along
" - Sally Buck fondly wipes lipstick from Joe's lips
Keep your meat hooks off my operators, sugar, hear
- Joe slaps one of the Veterans on the back, trying to follow the song into "Off we go, into the wild blue yonder
" - clutches a younger Joe, eyes wild, gasping
You're the only one, Joe, the only, only one ever
- Joe is leaning across the two Marines, staring out of the window as the Veterans switch to "Anchors aweigh, my boys, anchors aweigh
" - stunning view through the bus window past Joe's reflection
' Gonna swing my lasso and rope that whole goddam island, yeah
- Drum majorettes leading the parade -- ticker tape and confetti -- girls at skyscraper windows
Charles Lindberg (or James Stewart) waving at the crowd
- Girls lining the piers -- flags, banners, bunting -- ship horns, whistles, bells
- Joe crowded as the veterans prepare to leave the bus, lifting down banners and flags
- The bus suddenly surrounded by converging traffic, horns honking, segueing into the noises of Times Square
- Flag draped, reading:
-  - Flapping in the wind --
- The marquee announces
a singing radio station break blares "---
" - The sign flashes  "
ten-ten on your dial
"  torchy woman's voice sings from a lonely echo chamber -- introducing a love theme which will haunt Joe throughout the film
1014 - Joe sets his radio on the dresser, his suitcase on the bed, then turns to examine his new home -- as anonymous as his Texas hotel room -- but boasting a coin-operated television set
Fascinated, Joe inserts a quarter
the love song continues over a television talk Show featuring a   defending his profession against a Joe Pyne-type  , "
well,  perform a real service, there's a need, so many people, you know, really live in their pets,  mean, lonely,  grant you, but their feeling is real
They want to lavish as much love, give them as much, yes, pamper them like they were really human children or whatever
" ' There's a  dinner in the fridge, lover boy
- Little Joe stares sullenly at an antique  box while Sally Buck puts her hat on at the fireplace mirror
There is a framed picture of Woodsy Niles on the mantle
You be okay, won't you
Maybe bring you a treat if you're a good boy
1014 - Joe watches the Panel Host, "
you're a nut case, fella, a real nut case
" - Little Joe massaging Sally Buck's neck -- continuing the earlier scene
'm so beat, no point you waiting round, toots, think 'll stop in for a beer or two
1014 - Joe sits on the edge of the bed, watching the poodles primp
- Little Joe stares unblinking at the  screen as Sally Buck kisses him on the forehead, dressed for the street
Expect me when you see me
Looks like  got me a new beau, lover boy, how's that for an old grammaw
'll leave you movie money
Sally Buck tucks a dollar bill under a framed picture of Jesus, who has replaced Woodsy Niles on the mantle
1014 - As a fairy godmother's magic wand removes sticky hair spray from a pretty model's head, Joe's quarter runs out and the screen goes blank
At the same moment, the love song is cut off by a singing station break "---  " Joe rises, flipping the dial of the radio to a cultured woman's voice reading "
the Dow Jones averages, brought you by Morgan Vandercook
Up your income with sound investment counseling
" Up yours, lady
but Joe leaves the lady on, savoring the expensive sound of her voice reading the stock quotations
Joe seats himself at the desk, pleased to find a postcard photograph of the hotel
He picks up a ballpoint pen, counts ten floors up from the street and marks a huge  --   , then turns the card over, pen poised over the address blank
- Ralph stares at the card, surrounded by dirty dishes
Hell, he know  can't read
1014 - Joe's pen wavers, starts to write and stops
'   - As we saw it last, deserted, a   sign in the window
Joe's reflection appears, staring at himself, dressed in his dishwasher's clothes
' After all them dishes are washed, what
' Then they bring some more dishes and  wash them and then , uh, sleep some and then wash some more dishes and then
' Say it, lover boy
' Die
1014 - Joe stares at the postcard, bemused, ' Well, you better just shake your tail, lover boy, and root, hog or die
Joe rises abruptly, rips up the postcard and tosses it out the window
Goddam if  came to this town to write postcards
- The torn fragments flutter down on the crowd -- a woman brushing irritably at her hair -- a man grimacing, glancing up -- a cop removing his hat to examine it
- From a low angle -- identical with the postcard photograph -- an unseen hand scrawls a huge ---
Camera zooms up to a close-up of Joe at the window
- From on high -- as though Joe were watching himself -- the Stetson moves through a crowd of Fifth Avenue shoppers
- passing a glass bank, lady tellers counting money
- passing a display of imported luxury cars
- passing a window which features a single gem -- pausing as horns blast
and a mod blonde in a stalled sports car motions to Joe -- she needs a push
Joe grins, glances at himself in the window, runs a comb through his hair, then turns back to see a cop helping the mod blonde
- Joe's heels drag as he walks a deserted block of luxury apartment houses
The torchy woman's voice sings Joe's love theme in counterpoint to the blasting horns, a siren, a fire bell, a screech of brakes
Joe's spirits rise as he hears the tic-tac-tic of high heels overtaking the heavy click-clack-click of his boots
He adjusts his pace to arrive at the corner at the same time as a smart and -- in Joe's eyes -- very
Joe grins boyishly, holding his Stetson over his heart
Beg pardon, ma'am, 'm new here in town, just in from Houston, Texas, and looking for the Statue of Liberty
The delicate profile gives no signs of hearing
Joe follows her to the parkway in the middle of the avenue
There she stops and turns, neither friendly nor hostile
Were you looking
About the Statue of Liberty
Joking
No, ma'am
Oh no
mean business
'm sorry
thought you were -- never mind -- 've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, think, to the end of the line
You sure are a pretty lady
The Rich Lady tries to frown, taken aback, blushing
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all
No, ma'am, 'm not
Why, that's perfectly dreadful
Aren't you ashamed of yourself
twinkle of amusement and sympathy reveals the age lines at the corner of her eyes
Then she continues on quickly, just as the light turns
Joe's view is blocked for a moment by traffic, then he sees
the Rich Lady, newly aware of her flanks as she climbs the steps of a brownstone and searches for her key
Still from Joe's viewpoint, he sees himself move into frame and follow the Rich Lady up the steps
The love theme swells
as the Rich Lady leads him into the house and closes the door
leaving Joe standing alone on the parkway island, surrounded by towering wealth
The love theme continues over
- a pair of high-heeled pink slippers, walking a miniature poodle -- slowing slightly, reacting to Joe's cowboy boots as they pass, pause and turn back
' Hurry up, Baby
Do um goody-goods for Mama
Joe grins, holding his hat over his heart as he approaches , a blonde lady in a tight black dress, with the look of a movie star who wrecked her career with food
Beg pardon, ma'am
'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty
You're hoping to get a look at what
The Statue of Liberty
It's up in Central Park, taking a leak
If you hurry, you'll make the supper show
Now get lost
But as she turns, Cass winks, dimpling the corners of her mouth, signaling Joe to follow her
- Cass holds the   button till Joe enters the elevator, then the doors close with a soft expensive little kllooosh and Cass turns with the smile of a very tiny girl
Hi
her lips closing on Joe's as the poodle yaps shrilly at their feet
Superimposed, almost subliminally, a golden dollar sign appears, halating like a star, and the bell of a pinball machine rings
'  - princess telephone is ringing on a gold and white desk
Cass runs to grab it
Hello
as Joe steps from the elevator, which opens directly onto Cass's penthouse
Cass beckons him toward her, hooks a finger into his neckerchief and pulls his mouth toward hers while she talks on the phone
(') Morey
Hi-ee, honey
Cass gurgles happily as her free hand unbuckles Joe's garrison belt
(') 'm just out of breath, honey, running to catch the phone
As her fingers reach for Joe's zipper, cut to
Joe's hand unzipping her dress
(') was walking Baby
Him got to do him goody-goods, right
The poodle tugs at Joe's slacks until they fall
Cass steers her ear to Joe's mouth, shuddering deliciously
(') Oh God, oh stop
can't stand that
just die
(quickly into phone) It's Baby, Morey
Him trying to say hello
Say hello to Morey, Baby
Cass holds the phone toward the yapping poodle, twisting herself against Joe as she wriggles out of her dress, passing the phone from one hand to the other
(') Okay, old goosie
Now lookie, when do you want me to meet you
Whatever you say
'll take a nap, watch , you know, kill time
Okay, but just one, a big wet one
Cass hangs up
The poodle yaps hysterically, disentangling himself from her tumbling dress -- hops onto the couch glances off and flees again as an overturned lamp crashes '  - The poodle bounces onto the bed -- remaining long enough to establish a     lying on the satin coverlet -- then leaps down in panic as he hears Joe and Cass explode into the bedroom, laughing lustily
the remote control tuner buried suddenly under the full flesh of Cass's hip, activating
a twenty-five-inch television screen, blasting at full volume
Cass's eyes widening, profoundly impressed
Ye gods
the images and sound of the television set flicking joyfully from channel to channel
Joe laughing, engulfed by Cass's abundance
Cass wild-eyed, overflowing the frame
a gleaming slot machine -- three Sahara cowgirls clicking into line for jackpot -- silver dollars overflowing the frame
- the Mutual of New York tower flashes
' Holy shee-it, this is a goddam penthouse you got here, Cass, a real goddam penthouse
'  - Joe turns away from a small terrace, buckling his belt, glancing off toward the sound of Cass in the shower
He flicks the  remote control, enjoying his power, ignoring the silent images on the screen -- battle casualties, a pretty girl recommending aspirin, a man's stomach flashing animated pain, starving war refugees, a dog eating pzazz -- flicking it off to concentrate on the costume jewelry and perfume bottles on Cass's dressing table
' Don't look, baby
Joe turns to look as Cass comes from the bathroom, holding a towel around her as she runs behind the closet door
Say, Cass, , uh, sure have enjoyed being here
Believe it's as fine a time as 've had in my life
' Me, too, lover
That's good, it is, cause, well guess  didn't tell you why  came to New York, did
tower of black bugle beads emerges from the closet door
Zip this thing, will you, Tex
Joe zips her dress, follows her to the dressing table, where she sprays her hair with lacquer
Truth is, Cass, 'm, well, 'm in business
Oh, poor you
Morey's got terrible ulcers
Cass stretches her upper lip across her teeth and she smears it with, orange lipstick
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- 'm a hustler
(lips stretched) Hers'n zodda meg a livig
Beg pardon, ma'am
Said, a person's gotta make a living
You sure you heard what  said
Scuse me, hon, fraid 'm only half here
Maybe you oughta run on along
But why don't you take this phone number
Joe grins, relieved as she takes out a gold lame purse and opens it
He frowns as she folds; it upside down, empty
(') Darn
didn't get to the bank -- Tex -- could you let me have a little coin for the taxi-waxi
Joe stands mute as she cups his chin in her hand, seductively
(') You're such a doll
hate money, don't you
God, it's been fun
Funny thing, you mentioning money
was just about to ask your for some
Joe tries to laugh but it sticks in his throat as Cass speaks -- an impassioned whisper -- still holding Joe's chin
You bastard
You son of a bitch
You think you're dealing with some old slut
Look at me
You think just cause you're a longhorn bull you can get away with this crap
Well, you're out of your mind
am a gorgeous chick, thirty-one, that's right, you said it
Sobbing suddenly, she throws herself on the bed
Joe stands bewildered by the vastness of her grief
Hey
Hey, Cass
Did you think meant that
Christ, would  be asking you for money with a wad like that riding on my hip
Joe waves his wallet at her, but she only cries louder
He hands her a kleenex
She clutches it to her face, wailing
Joe leans over the bed, whispering in her ear: (') Hey
You are a gorgeous-looking piece, Cass
Guy gets horny, just looking at you
It's a fact
How much you need for that taxi
Ten
Twenty
There you go
Joe tucks a twenty-dollar bill into her bosom, tilts his Stetson and starts out
Cass blows her nose, looking after him
chorus sings, "From this valley they say you are going -- we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
" - From a high angle, Joe walks away from the apartment house, chorus continuing
"
they say you are taking the sunshine that brightened our pathway a while
" '  - Joe sits at the bar, staring morosely at his image in the mirror, already quite drunk, oblivious to the assorted types hiding from daylight in the barn-like saloon, waiting for night to fall
' Excuse me, 'm just admiring that colossal shirt
studies Joe across the corner of the bar -- a sickly, child-size old man of twenty-one -- hopefully nursing an empty beer glass, contemplating the money on the bar in front of Joe
That is one hell of a shirt
bet you paid a pretty price for it, am right
Oh, it ain't cheap
mean, yeah, 'd say this was an all right shirt
Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back
Ratso spits as  leans on the bar next to Joe -- a feminine young person, heavily made-up, hair teased, wearing earrings and a lace-trimmed blouse over shocking pink  levis
Got a cigarette, cowboy
(a stage whisper) More goddam faggots in this town
Reaching for a cigarette, Joe glances at Jackie, startled as Jackie twitches his pink levis angrily and turns away
Shee-it
(shakes his head) Kee-rist, you really know the ropes
Wish to hell  bumped into you before
'm Joe Buck from Texas and 'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx
Don't mind if  do
(slaps bar) Same all around
For my friend, too
The  screen over the bar features a mating game program as Jackie cruises down to join a tall farm boy with plucked eyebrows
The   points to three young men, visible only from the shoulders up, from whom a pretty   in blindfold must choose an escort
and for the losers, who don't get the girl, we'll give as consolation prices -- a six month supply of underarm deodorant
In a booth now -- the  screen in the background, continuing the game -- Joe is refilling Ratso's beer glass as he speaks, loud over the laughter of the  audience
you see what 'm getting at here
She got a penthouse up there with color  and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when  ask for money
For what
For money
For money for what
'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that
How would  know
You gotta tell a person these things (shakes his head) hustler
Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management
think you just put your finger on it,  do
My friend 'Daniel
That's who you need
Operates the biggest stable in town
In the whole goddam metropolitan area
stud like you - paying
-- not that  blame you -- a dame starts crying,  cut my heart for her
' 'd call that a very minor operation
Ratso grabs the neck of a bottle, sliding back in the booth
Joe scowls as Jackie appears with the tall farm boy
in fact, you just sit comfy and 'll cut it out with my fingernail file
You won't even need Blue Cross, Ratso
The name is Rizzo
That's what  said, Ratso
(suddenly) Hey now, you heard him
On the  screen -- the Date Girl announces: pick Number Two
He's cool
That's okay, Joe
'm used to these types that like to pick on cripples
Sewers're full of 'em
May  ask one thing, cowboy
If you sit there and he sits way over there, how's he gonna get his hand into your pocket
But 'm sure he has that all figured out
(to Ratso) Good night, sweets
May present your chosen mate
The  host pulls aside the screen which has concealed the lower half of the three young men
Number Two, her chosen mate, is a dwarf sitting on a high stool
The girl's spontaneous dismay starts everyone laughing hysterically, including the dwarf
- Joe has difficulty keening up with Ratso, who swings himself along with surprising agility, his half skipping little gate favoring one game leg
Look, with these chicks that want to buy it, most of 'em are older, dignified, right
Social register types
They can't be trotting down to Times Square to pick out the merchandise
They need a middleman, right
That's 'Daniel
Joe hesitates as Ratso darts into traffic against a red light, yelling unheard obscenities at a cab driver who blasts his horn
Joe runs recklessly forward as Ratso slams the taxi fender with his fist, pretending to be hit, falling into Joe's arms
The taxi stops, halting traffic
Ratso, recovers, strolls casually in front of the cab, biting his thumb at the driver
(') It is a crime, a stud like you passing out double sawbucks to a chick like that
With proper management you should be taking home fifty, a hundred bucks a day
More if you wanta moonlight
- At,the corner of Central Park South, Ratso points toward a young man with diamond cuff-links, sitting with a blue-haired matron who puffs on a small cigar
Ratso waves jauntily at the young man, raising his thumb and forefinger in a circle, leaving the young man baffled as Ratso hurries Joe on
Him  placed with 'Daniel just two weeks ago
And look
Not much of a stud either, what  hear
- Ratso automatically checks the coin return boxes of the phone booths they pass
Walking the park side of the street, looking across at the limousines and taxis waiting outside luxury hotels and apartment buildings
Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister 'Diddle bird right now
Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and 'd be doing you both a favor, but why
What'm  dragging my bum leg all over town for
It's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what
Ratso stops opposite the Plaza hotel, pointing across at an aristocratic blonde stepping out of a Rolls Royce
(') Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be
Nedicks
Hold it, just hold it
You think 'm that kinda sombitch
Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now
Five
Ten, how's that
Joe peels a ten from his wallet and offers it to Ratso
Joe, please
You know what 'd ask anyone else
Oh hell, tell you what 'll do, 'll take the ten
(he does) but when  hand you over to Mr
'Daniel, 'll have to have another ten, Joe; just to like cover expenses
- Ratso is on the phone
Joe holds the door open, listening
This boy is just your meat, Mr
'Daniel, believe it, 'm telling you -- what
-- Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx
The point is he needs you
Right now
Tonight
(aside to Joe) got his tongue hanging out
- Camera moves slowly up the anonymous wall of a drab hotel, following the line of dim red lights marking the fire exits
' Name's Joe Buck
Cowboy
Just in from Texas, don't know the ropes, new to the city, but very promising material, sir, and ready, if you get what  mean
Fabulous
Right away
What's that room number there again
- As ancient open cage lift rises at the same pace as camera in preceding shot
Joe grins excitedly at Ratso, who nods but glances significantly at the elevator operator
Ratso follows Joe to door as the operator grinds to a stop
- Ratso steps out with Joe, gesturing to the corridor
Hold it a second
but the operator slams the door and starts on up
Ratso leans heavily on the down button, glancing at Joe
(') Nine-oh-one, got it
Ratso glances up the elevator shaft nervously, rings again and turns back to Joe
(') Let's see how you look
Fine
You look fine
Now 'm gonna have to have that other ten
(digs in wallet) Ten, ten --  got a twenty -- take that
Oh hell, forget it
Now take it
Go on
(gives it to him) Listen, where can  reach you
Cause 'm gonna make this right with you soon's  get me set up
Forget it
mean, dammit, where you live
Ratso leans on the  as the cage grinds slowly down into view and stops
Sherry-Netherlands Hotel
Now get your ass in there
He's waiting
Ratso steps into the elevator as the door opens then closes, leaving Joe alone, repeating "Cherry Neverlin" as he starts along the corridor looking for 901
- Ratso bursts from the hotel, almost running as he disappears
- Joe finds 901 at a dark end of the corridor, knocks confidently, hearing a few bars of his love theme as he stuffs a fresh stick of gum in his mouth
Then the door is thrown open by ' -- for an instant appearing to wear a diamond-studded skull-cap, the naked overhead light bulb bright after the dark corridor, halating in Joe's eyes like the earlier dollar sign
' You must be Joe Buck
Come in
'Daniel, fat in a worn-out bathrobe, examines Joe like a prodigal son as he leads him into the room -- as anonymous as Joe's own room
' (') Am  tickled to find you, boy
Come on in and let's get a look at you
Turn around
Good strong back
You'll need it
So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself
Cowboy, huh
No sir, 'm no cowboy really, but 'm a first class stud
' Take it,easy, boy
(laughs) Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me
Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but 'd say you knew exactly what you want
You bet  do, sir
' But 'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys
'll bet you're lonesome
Well, not too,  mean, a little
'Daniel rises suddenly in a fury of self-righteousness, pacing, his voice simpering, whining sarcastically
' 'm lonesome
'm lonesome so 'm a drunk
'm lonesome so 'm a dope fiend
'm lonesome so 'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger
Poop, say, poop
've heard it all and 'm sick of it, sick to death
Yessir,  can see that
' Lonesomeness is something you take
You bear
Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all
Well, uh, 'm raring to go
' Yes,  believe you are
Cowboy, huh
Uh, yessir
' Ready for hard work, son
Ready for anything
' got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most
Gonna be like money from home
' Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son
warn you 'm gonna use you, 'm gonna run you ragged
Joe laughs, driving an obscene uppercut into the air
'Daniel laughs with him
' (') You're a wonderful boy
You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless
Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now
Get down -- where
' Right here, why not
prayed in saloons,  prayed in the street, prayed an the toilet
He don't care where, what He wants is that prayer
'Daniel drops on all fours, crawling to find the plug of an electric cord
He shoves it into a wall socket, switches off the overhead light and suddenly a hollow, tinted plastic Jesus glows on the dresser
a revivalist congregation sings
And now we notice, with Joe, placards and flags, horns and tracts, all the paraphernalia of a street corner evangelist
Shee-it
' That's the ticket, just open your heart and let it flow
It ain't the words, it's the love beyond 'em
- Sally Buck sings with the congregation while a rawboned preacher stands in the river, preparing to immerse little Joe
'' Don't fight it, boy
- 'Daniel tries to pull Joe down beside him
' Pray and you shall be heard
- Camera becomes little Joe, glimpsing the fevered faces of Sally Buck and the congregation singing on the riverbank, just before being plunged under the river
'Daniel's voice reechoes, filtered through water
' Don't be frightened, son
- Joe runs in aimless panic, pushing through the crowd, pursued by 'Daniel's voice and the singing congregation
' Don't run from Jesus
Joe stops short as he sees the front page of a tabloid on a newsstand
There is a picture of Joe being led away by two deputies, under a headline
-  - Joe searches the faces of the crowd, running forward suddenly as he sees Jackie and the farmboy picked up by two men in a large convertible
Joe chases the car to Eighth Avenue but stops, frightened as he sees himself in multiple image on the front of every newspaper displayed on a newsstand
'  - The saloon is almost empty during the after dinner lull
The doesn't look up from his newspaper as Joe approaches
Say, you know that runty little bastard  was with
don't know nothing
Joe tenses as he sees the
tabloid picture of himself on the back of the bartender's paper
Joe's hand closes around an empty beer bottle, a terrible violence surging very near the surface
women scream
- Reflected in the mirror, we see little Joe wildly smashing bottles and glass display cabinets -- the voices of women screaming
-- little Joe hurling a perfume bottle which shatters the mirror and his own image
'  - The empty beer bottle stands where it was
Joe has disappeared
On the  screen over the bar, sound drowned out by the jukebox, we see a blowup of the tabloid photograph, revealing a young man very similar to, but clearly not Joe
- Colorful lights still flash seductive promise
The vertical, lights on the  tower reach bottom and freeze momentarily
Joe at his hotel window staring out blankly
Gun fire
- The radio at Joe's ear is drowned out by a kid in cowboy hat, shooting alone in the gallery
Two policemen idly slap their thighs with night sticks
Joe moves on, unconsciously checking the coin return box of a pay phone
Joe curled up on his bed like a baby, fully dressed, his radio on the night stand
his love theme, remote, hollow
-  - Joe's radio is at his ear "
never too late to look great, Ben's Bargain Basement's open 'till five a
m
, miles and miles of Western styles, worth more at any store, money talks and nobody walks
" For the first time, Joe is aware of the other midnight cowboys lurking in doorways, the cruising queens, the middle-age men in sport shirts
Joe moves on self consciously as he sees a scar-faced policeman, unconsciously massaging his night stick
Camera holds on a window display of gag buttons, featuring      , Joe soaking in the tub, eyes closed
- Joe's radio promises job opportunities for young men eighteen to twenty-five in the
Air Force
He stands with a crowd staring up at a girl go-go dancing in the window of '
Joe staring in the mirror
static over his love theme
- By work-light, the tarrier in metal helmet leans on a jack hammer, beyond the sign   , drowning out Joe's radio
Joe flexing his muscles in his jockey shorts while -- -- a physical culture personality finishes push-ups and starts pitching his own extra protein bread
- Joe's radio continues the super-break commercial while a fry cook flips flapjacks in the window
But Joe's eyes are on a sign
Joe looks up and his eyes meet those of the young man scraping garbage behind the counter
It's Joe
Shee-it
Joe sits in the hotel lobby, staring out at the street, unable to concentrate on his comic book
On two-way radio, a woman's voice giggles as she speaks, "When  can't sleep, well,  just dial the time and listen to those old seconds clicking by like, you know, counting sheep
" - Joe watches a young man hold a taxi door for an older lady, at the same corner where Ratso waved to another young man
The woman's predatory eyes linger momentarily on Joe before she leads the young man into the Cafe
The two-way radio continues over, "
that's what  do about insomnia
" Well, now, ma'am, next time you got that feeling coming on, you dial Joe Buck
'll show you what to do
Joe straddles a chair, staring at a blank  screen
Need a little easy money
It's -
Want a little easy cash
It's -
- As the jingle continues, we follow Joe and his radio into the loan office, the depressing reality photographed and edited in the style of a  commercial: Easy locations to get to Easy ladies to greet you Easy chairs to seat you Easy payments to meet Let - set you On Easy Street Joe arrives confident Harassed - receptionist Lines of uneasy customers Desperate, angry faces Reams of - forms to fill Clerk's sneer, says Joe has to be kidding - Joe's image frozen -- as if another still photograph - standing at the desk, waiting for his key
' Key to 1014
Action continues as the   hands Joe a folded paper instead of a key
Joe opens it, deeply perplexed
Looks like you been locked out of your room, buddy
Till you pick up your tab
Uh, what about my things'n all
We keep them nice and safe till you get this straightened out
Room 1014 warm and inviting, Joe's suitcase on the bed
Listen, tell you what, you can keep all the rest of the goddam junk if you let me have just the suitcase
That suitcase means a lot to me
The postcard photograph marked  --
We keep everything
House rules
- Joe stands outside the hotel, stunned, seeing the bright colored lights turn suddenly grey
The film continues in black and white as Joe walks into the crowd
'   - The   sign flapping in the wind
- Joe nurses a short beer, like the regulars
He looks up as a crippled panhandler approaches, vaguely reminiscent of Ratso
Screw off
1014 - The bed turned back, clean sheets, a soft night light
- Joe is stretched on a bench, his Stetson over his eyes loud speaker announces a bus "departing for Texas" but Joe does not move
policeman taps Joe's boots with his night stick
Joe rises and starts away with mixed anger and apprehension
'  - Two matching Ivy Leaguers exchange a glance as they see Joe washing his feet in the basin
Joe stares back with a belligerent grin
Any objection, gentlemen
- Joe balances a cup of coffee, walking past the other solitary night people, avoiding each other's eyes
Joe spots what he's looking for and seats himself next to a gaunt woman and her ten year old son, both freaked out, erratically touching things, themselves, each other in a futile effort to make contact with reality
But Joe is only concerned with the plastic-wrapped crackers left by their empty soup bowls
'ain't gonna eat them
The woman stares at Joe blankly
The boy runs a toy mouse across the table, up his mother's arm and around her face
With a polite nod, Joe opens the crackers and squirts one with ketchup
Joe upsets his chair as a great gob of ketchup spills onto his pants
Shee-it
glancing around with an embarrassed laugh, but the only one looking is a cop, scratching his calf with a night stick
Joe keeps his back to the customers as he moves to the water dispenser, wets a paper napkin and tries to wipe away the stain
But the water has only spread the stain across his pants and down his leg
He blushes as a blonde young streetwalker giggles
' Wet your britches, lover boy
- Joe tries to hide the stain with his jacket as he checks the coin boxes of vending machines, wary as he passes a burly policeman, abstractedly snapping his handcuffs in front of a bakery window display of bride-and-groom wedding cakes
Joe barely glances at a confused -
- How do  get to Grand Central
Shuttle
Follow the green light
Automatically,checking the trough of a gum vending machine, Joe unexpectedly faces himself in the mirror, the eyes staring at him tired and hopeless
His hand reaches unconsciously for a cigarette, The package is empty
He crumples it in his fist but holds it
(') Alright, cowboy
Enough of this shee-it
You know what you got to do
(nods) Then go do it
-  - Joe hurls the crumpled package into a ' basket as he emerges from the subway, his radio at his ear
The torchy voice belts his love song, merging with street noises crying danger -- an ambulance, a burglar alarm, a policeman's whistle -- the lights flashing lurid color for the first time since Joe was locked out, no longer promising but threatening, clashing, warning as
from a high angle, across the street, Joe joins the other midnight cowboys, offering himself to all comers
His figure is momentarily obliterated by traffic then
zooming in, we see Joe self-consciously trying to hide the stain on his pants, embarrassed as a large sedan slows then moves on to stop in front of a motorcycle freak
Joe is briefly obliterated again by a passing police car
the receding flash of its turret light revealing Joe in close conversation with a frightened young  , whose eyes plead for reassurance as Joe scowls
1014 - Joe's black and white suitcase gleams on the bed
' Twenty-three bucks,  got to have twenty-three bucks
- From an apparently empty balcony -- an old science fiction film grinds endlessly through the night -- a lost spaceman trying to make contact with a tantalizing Martian maiden across an invisible time barrier, theremin voices calling, "Earthling, where are you
" ' Okay
Sure
got twenty-five
At the top of the balcony, Joe leans back, turning his face away as the Fat Boy embraces him, kissing Joe's cheek and neck, his head moving down out of frame to show -- on the screen -- the spaceman and Martian maiden meeting, arms outstretched
But the Martian maiden moves right on through the spaceman, crying, "Earthling come back, however many centuries it is, 'll wait
" Joe closes his eyes, forcing his memory back
- repeating the remembered image of Anastasia and a younger Joe, behind the movie screen
You're the only one, Joe, the only, only one ever
the remembered passion continuing, mounting -- intercut with flash impressions, like flipping pages of a nudie magazine -- naked, half-draped blondes gazing into camera with sultry eyes, including one comic strip sexpot and the calendar girl in Joe's Texas hotel room
' You're the best, the very best, yes, yes, kiss me, oh God please kiss me, Joe, now, now, now
Joe's face in extreme close-up, sounds of both movie houses merging, confused, dominated by the voices of adolescent boys
' Hey, Joe, give someone else a chance
What's he doing for chrisake
He kissing Anastasia
You better swallow a whole goddam drugstore, man
an adolescent ratpack waiting in line behind the screen, laughing in coarse whispers, watching Joe and Anastasia
theremin voices call "Earthling, where are you
" - On screen, the Martian maiden moves through the spaceman, crying, "Earthling, come back, however many centuries it is, 'll wait
" - Joe watches the Fat Boy doubled over, retching
'm awful damn sorry you're sick, kid, but you gonna have to gimme that money like you said
was lying
don't have it
What're you going to do to me
(controls fury) What you got in your pockets
Eagerly, the boy produces a family photograph, a subway token, a dirty handkerchief
Joe grabs his wrist, revealing a watch
(') How much's that worth
can't go home without my watch
My mother'd die
She'd die
Take my books
Not my watch
She'd die
But Joe has already kicked open the door
Theremin voices drown out the Fat Boy, calling "Earthling, where are you
" - Joe sprawls, trying to sleep, his feet on the balcony rail, the radio at his ear
On screen, once again, the Martian maiden moves through the spaceman, crying, but we hear the voice of a desperate woman on two-way radio
As she speaks, a policeman moves along the aisle, slapping his palm with his night stick
Bill, can  call you Bill, Mister Bonner
feel like  know you from listening
What  called about, Bill, 'm gonna kill myself
- From a high angle, only Joe's Stetson and radio can be seen above a passing bus, its side panel advertising  ' ,
' Why call me, baby
If you want to do it; just do it, don't talk about it
Are we drunky
Feeling a little sorry for ourselves maybe
Joe appears in full figure as the bus passes
He stands looking at the suitcases in a luggage shop window
Well, Bill, what  got thinking, didn't want the neighbors to have to find me, this young couple with the boy  want to have my cat, see, Bill
- , tough in a grey crew-cut, talks on the phone
Okay, baby, now listen, just hold on while  leave the line for a minute
And think about all the kids that are dying overseas for you, okay, baby
Got that
'll be back in exactly sixty seconds
After this message from
taxi born blasts, interrupting the sponsor's message
- Joe's fist slams a fender violently, using Ratso's fake injury trick to stop traffic, running across the street toward
' - Ratso staring out at Joe, paralyzed in the act of lighting a cigarette -- intercut in flashing close-ups -- Joe outside the window, Ratso inside -- reflecting their conflicting emotions -- Joe's murderous rage -- Ratso's panic -- one almost subliminal flash of each revealing something like pleasure at finding a long-lost friend
' - Ratso staring up into camera, holding his breath
Don't hit me, 'm a cripple
Joe's hand falls on Ratso's shoulder
Oh,  ain't gonna hit you, 'm gonna strangle you to death
The cigarette in Ratso's mouth burns into his lip
He jerks spasmodically, choking on smoke as he rips skin away with the butt and drops it in his coffee cup
(') only first 'm gonna turn you upside down and shake you out right here and now
Coughing, eyes tearing, Ratso empties his pockets on the counter, finally producing: sixty-four cents, a few sticks of gum, an almost empty cigarette package, a book of matches and two pawn tickets
He raises his eyes, somehow ashamed
Joe kicks the toe of Ratso's loafer
What's in your socks
Not a cent,  swear to God,  swear on my mother's eyes
Ratso removes his loafers and shakes them, glancing at the counter man
His socks don't even conceal his toes
Disgusted, Joe shoves Ratso's small pile back at him
(') You keep the sixty-four cents want you to have it
It's sticky
What you do, slobber on 'em
wouldn't touch 'em
Joe should leave -- Ratso obviously has nothing tangible to offer -- but Joe hesitates, lighting a cigarette as Ratso pulls on his loafers
How do you like that 'Daniel, flipping out like that
wanted to get in touch with you when  heard, but  been laid up with this cold
Ratso touches his chest, forcing a cough which continues itself beyond his intention
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night
Okay, right, right, okay
Another subject
Where you living
Still at the hotel
1014 - The black and white suitcase lies open on the bed
' - Joe turns abruptly and walks away
Shee-it
got better things to do than talk to you
- Joe strides north, pretending he doesn't hear
' Hey, wait up, for crissake
Ratso hop-skipping to overtake Joe at the traffic light
Listen, keep away from me, hear
You come near me again,  snatch you bald-headed
'm inviting you
mean if you're not located,  got a place
'm inviting you, goddamit
You inviting shee-it
- contractor's sign announces    in high-rise co-op, under construction beyond a raw of tenements with 's taped on the windows
Ratso's voice continues over the click-clack-click of Joe's boots and the flip-flap-squeak of Ratso's loafers as camera moves toward a condemned building
' The  on the window means the landlord can't collect rent -- which is a convenience, hey
-- on account of it's condemned
- Footsteps climb past rubbish piled outside empty flats
' The electric's off
Another convenience
don't mess with Con Edison, hey
What the hell,  got candles, right
- Light from the  window shines on a Florida tourist poster as Ratso leads Joe into an abandoned tub-in-kitchen flat, barely furnished with a table and chair, a rumple of blankets on a burnt-out mattress
got no heat, but by that time, you know, cold weather, hey, 'll be in Florida
Stretch out
Make yourself comfortable
You hungry
'll put up some water for coffee
Ratso fills a saucepan from the tub-sink, sets it on a Sterno stove
Joe sits himself on the mattress-bed, pretending to test it, weeks of exhaustion and tension overwhelming him suddenly, his only immediate problem being the effort to restrain a large, comfortable yawn
Comfortable, kee-rist,  slept on subways softer than this
Joe stretches himself, yawning, his eyelids drooping heavily
The sounds of the city recede
Joe's love theme plays softly on a distant radio
Joe's eyes close momentarily in spite of him elf
- vintage dashboard, radio dial glowing, Anastasia's face
Love me, Joe
- huge metal ball arcs on chain, demolishing a brick facade
- Ratso's face seems to radiate evil as he lights a Sterno can
Joe forces his eyes half-open
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here
Whatsa matter now
Joe shivers, pulls a blanket around him, resisting sleep, but the noises of demolition fade, the love theme lures Joe back
You don't seem like no fag
What's that supposed to mean
Joe's eyes close, his voice continuing out of half-sleep
Want me to stay here, y'after something
What y'after
- Joe's thumbnail flares a match, exposing Anastasia on the car seat with Joe, both nearly naked
Anastasia butterfly-kisses Joe's chest as he lights a cigarette
Say you love me
Just say it
Okay
love you
Anastasia purrs as her lips find Joe's breast, trying to nurse
flashlight flares suddenly through the car window
- Low angle Ratso bending over Joe, into camera
Sally Buck shocked, hand still on switch
Joe blinded by halation
Anastasia's mouth screaming soundlessly

running into the arms of the police
Ratso laughing as police beat Joe
- Joe awakens in a cold sweat, fighting the blankets, wild-eyed as he sees Ratso at the table, examining Joe's radio by candle-light
Joe lunges across the room to snatch the radio from Ratso's hands
For crissake
Still wild-eyed, Joe suddenly points at his stocking feet
Where's my boots --
- Joe facing the crowd, naked except for his boots
- Ratso points to the boots on the floor by the mattress
How'd they get off me
took 'em off
What for
So you could sleep
mean Christ
Joe inspects the boots, seats himself on a battered Army cot - which has been added while he slept -- swinging a boot by its strap, considering whether to stay or go
(') drug in a cot, if you want to stay
Well now, Ratso, 'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette
Ratso offers a cigarette from his crushed package, Joe strikes a match on his thumbnail and lights up, staring at Ratso
(') You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea
ain't forcing you, like,  mean, who's forcing you
Oh
Guess  got the wrong impression
Joe makes a slow move to pull on one boot
want you to stay, okay
goddam invited you, didn't
Well,  hope you know what you're in for
'm a very dangerous person
Someone does me bad like you
If  caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now
Hear
'm impressed
You're a killer
So if you want me to hang around for a few days,  thought you should know
Joe yawns, picks up a few blankets and spreads them on the cot
He puzzles out the faded printing on one blanket
(') Property of the
You make me wanna puke sometimes, Ratso
Ratso blows out the candle and wraps himself in blankets
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am  wrong
You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo
Shee-it, man,  can't say all that
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place
Rico
Rico
Rico
Is that enough
(then) And keep your meat hooks off my radio
- Ratso wears a threadbare raincoat of faded black, several sizes too large, as he shops with housewives at a sidewalk vegetable stand -- elbowing his way through the ladies, testing fruit, picking up vegetables and putting them back -- till the  spots him
You
Out
Out
told you,  calla cops
The other shoppers deliberately turn their backs, avoiding involvement
As the Greengrocer grabs Ratso, Joe ambles into the scene, wearing his dangerous little smile
Hey, looka here, that ain't nice, picking on a cripple
Joe intervenes just long enough for Ratso to escape, then ambles on, leaving the Greengrocer in frustrated fury
Camera holds on a tray of coconuts
- Joe lies on his cot, watching Ratso struggle to penetrate the fibrous husk of a coconut, experimenting with a variety of rusty tools in an old cigar box
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk
That's a known fact
If  can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out
This is an okay setup you got here, but 'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not
been sick
Hold this, will ya
Joe takes his time rising to hold the coconut while Ratso tries to poke a hole with a bent ice-pick
(') In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat
Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin
Tough, hey
think finding you's the smartest thing  ever did, for both of us
You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder  need to get me hustling in this town
Hey
Joe jerks his hand away just in time to avoid the ice-pick
The coconut bounces on the floor
Ratso picks it up, holds it, while Joe tries to crack it, swinging his boot like a hammer
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler
Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world
They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes
What's all this sweet talk about Florida
Your friend 'Daniel got a stable down there now
Joe swings violently
Ratso yelps, hopping on his one good leg, sucking his thumb
Cowboy killers
Break my finger, Christ
got news for you, baby, no chick with any class buys that big dumb cowboy crap
Ratso holds his thumb under the tub-sink faucet
(') the cowboy bit's out, except among fags of a certain type, which take a certain, type hustler to exploit
Like  could handle it -- being a stealing operation basically -- but take your average fag, very few of them want a cripple
Joe holds the coconut like Yorick's skull, thinking hard
* Well,  am dumb, that's for sure don't talk right
can't think too good
Just only one thing  ever been good for's loving
Women go crazy for me
Fact
Crazy Annie
Had to send her away
So  don't cash in on that, what am
'm shee-it
May's well flush me down that hole with the dishwater
Joe sets the coconut on the floor, holding it with both hands while he tries to smash it with the heel of his boot
(') That's why you gonna stop crapping about Florida and get your skinny butt moving to earn twenty bucks worth of management you owe me
1014 - The suitcase lies open, displaying Joe's wardrobe
' Make that twenty-three bucks
- Joe slams his heel down
The coconut shoots out from under him and he lands on his ass
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell
For a stud in this town that's a handicap
You talk like a man with a tin twat
Ratso sets the coconut on the window sill, balancing it as he raises the  window
You ain't got a chance in hell
You need threads and glitter, baby front, hey
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue
Joe slams, the window down
The coconut flies down to crash on the sidewalk below
- An alley cat laps up the milk of the broken coconut
- Joe stands naked in the middle of traffic
siren shrills
Anastasia, catatonic in a hospital smock, moves toward Joe like a sleepwalker, passing through him
- Wearing only his boots, Joe sits like an Indian chief, wrapped in a blanket -- angle widening to show Ratso, spotting Joe's jacket, slacks and shirt with cleaning fluid -- his eyes on a very pregnant Italian lady
As she starts to load a coin cleaning machine, Ratso intervenes solicitously, speaking in Italian
woman in your condition shouldn't do that
Let me help
adroitly slipping Joe's cleaning in with her load as she turns to seat herself beside Joe
' It ain't right, stealing from a pregnant lady
- Joe and Ratso stand waiting at the counter
What did it cost her
The laundromat syndicate lost a couple coins
'm crying
The owner brings Joe's clean and blocked Stetson from the rear of the shop
Joe sets it on his head and examines himself in a mirror as the owner hands Ratso, the bill
(') Where's mine
The black homburg brought it in the same time
The owner glances at the slip, puzzled, returns to the rear of the shop to search for the nonexistent homburg
Ratso quickly drags Joe away from the mirror and out of the shop
- The rhythmic duet of boots and loafers follows Joe and Ratso - checking coin boxes and telephone booths -- till they reach a shoeshine stand, locked for the night
They loiter till a young couple has disappeared, then Joe kicks loose 'the padlock on the equipment drawer, mounts one of the chairs and Ratso goes to work on his boots with furious expertise, flourishing double brushes, snapping the rag like a jazz drummer
Hey, you're good
bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried
And end up a hunchback like my old man
You think 'm crippled
You shoulda caught him the end of a day
Ratso demonstrates a chimpanzee walk
Joe laughs
Ratso turns back in panic as another man takes a chair next to Joe
Ratso is about to retuse when a cop takes the third chair, swinging his handcuffs around to the front, tapping his shoe with his night stick
Ratso quickly drops a rag over the broken padlock, cursing under his breath as he starts working on all three customers at the same time
' You think it's funny
- Joe is seated in a straight-back chair near the  window, a towel tucked around his neck as Ratso trims his hair, almost as expert a barber as shoeshine boy
Stupid bastard coughed his lungs out breathing that resin all day
They buried him with gloves on
Even the fag undertaker couldn't get his nails clean
As if by conditioned reflex, Ratso chokes on the cigarette in his mouth, coughing painfully
He crushes it out, opens the window to spit, shivering, then slam it and turns back to remove the towel from Joe's neck
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp
You like it
Take a look
Don't rush me
How  do it, see, get myself primed, like  was turning on the charm for some pretty little blonde lady, then kinda mosey away slow and easy and - swing around
-- and there you are, you handsome devil
Joe performs his ritual as he speaks, but more relaxed, faintly laughing at himself with Ratso
The wall mirror has been added since we last saw the flat, along with a legless overstuffed chair with burnt-out cushions, a tasselled table cover, pinups, calendar girls and several new Florida tourist posters, Ratso moves to Joe's side, arranging the neckerchief, nodding
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay
What 'm gonna do, 'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid
How about that
Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff
Joe slaps his hat on Ratso's head, tilts it, hooks Ratso's thumbs in his jeans and shoves a cigarette into the corner of Ratso's mouth
Ratso laughs till he chokes -- for one instant, self-consciously, mimicking Joe -- then removes the hat and reaches for his threadbare black raincoat
(') Okay, you got yourself one handsome, sweet-smelling cowboy, strut your stuff
- Joe and Ratso peer down through a basement bay window, into the office of      -- endorsed by leading travel agencies and credit clubs offering discreet companionship and personal guided tours in any language
large-busted matron, on a French phone, fills out a memo and hands it to an immaculate young , who slips the memo into his topcoat pocket as he comes from the office and hails a cab
Ratso darts forward, limping exaggeratedly, holding the door, lifting the memo as he brushes off the Escort's topcoat
The young man waves him away with out a tip
Ratso slams the door and bites his thumb after the cab, unfolding the memo as he joins Joe on the sidewalk
How do you like that
Cheap bastard
(reads, then) think we struck gold
This is one high-class chick
The Barbizon for Women
- The Mutual of New York tower flashes
- Ratso consults the memo as he speaks into the phone
Mr
McNeill, 'm calling for Miss Beecham at the Barbizon Hotel for Women
She won't need you tonight
- doorman helps a young lady into a limousine
' Would you believe a whole goddam hotel with nothing but lonely chicks
Joe and Ratso watch from across the street
Score once in that setup, the way chicks talk, Christ
Joe cracks his gum, tilts his hat, starts across the street
(') Get the money
Remember Cass Trehune
Cash
These rich bitches write a check at night, call the bank and stop payment in the morning
Get the cash
In Ratso's eyes -- as Joe enters the hotel -- its facade suddenly wipes away to reveal rich ladies in negligee waiting in every room
- Joe starts up the stairs, two at a time
grabs him
Hey
No men upstairs
- Ratso warms his hands at a chestnut vendor's cart, seeing
zoom close-up, a lady in a window grabbing Joe
- Joe picks up a house phone, watched by the Bellhop
- Ratso sees Joe zip from room to room in wild animation
- The lobby watches Joe blow a gum bubble at the elevator
- Staring at a window display of Florida sportswear, Ratso's imagination soars, seeing
- Ratso, like a model in a travel poster, in gaudy sport shirt, talking on the phone against a background of hotels
Ratso like James Bond, surrounded by bikinis, dictating while girls serve coconut milk and massage his game leg
Ratso like George Raft, in evening clothes, running a posh casino, flicking a coin
Ratso simply himself, dressed as he is, sitting on the beach, at peace in the sun
the same identical picture with Joe sitting beside Ratso
- Joe faces  , a reserved and rather plain young lady in evening dress, She tries to speak softly
'm afraid there's been a terrible mistake
- Ratso leans against the window, flipping a coin
- Miss Beecham is flushed with humiliation, the entire lobby watching Joe in the hands of two bellboys
want my money, goddamit, you owe me my money whether you get laid or not, lady, shee-it
- The lights in the window suddenly switch off, blacking out Florida
Ratso glances toward the growl of a siren
- police prowl car slows in front of the hotel
Ratso swings across the street with incredible speed to meet Joe as he's tossed onto the sidewalk
Ratso picks up the Stetson and brushes it off, then helps Joe to his feet
- From a high angle -- the two figures move slowly along the deserted avenue, their rhythmic musical duet growing more and more faint in the distance, a broken grasshopper and a six foot tarnished cowboy -- passing a tuxedo rental store, next to a lighted sign --    ,  89 -- their pace slowing to a dead stop
- Joe and Ratso frozen -- rain on the  windowpane freezing into sheet ice
a radio commercial plays warm, sentimental music while a cozy voice explains how easy it is to heat with Humble oil
- Joe and Ratso frozen in a narrow shaft of sunlight, watching the huge metal ball demolish the building next door
a radio announcer sells
- Joe and Ratso frozen, staring significantly at Joe's radio
a singing commercial, "Don't wheeze and sneeze the winter away
Drink Frozen sunshine every day
" - Through the window -- Joe and Ratso watch the pawnbroker examine Joe's radio, "Be healthier, wealthier, life can be fine, when you drink Frozen" -- Sunshine is clicked off by the pawnbroker
- Joe and Ratso frozen, wrapped in blankets as
the canned heat dies with a faint puff
water dripping in the tub-sink freezes into an icicle
the candle burns down and out, leaving the screen dark
- Joe and Ratso warm themselves on the smoke and steam rising from a subway grating -- watching two officials in fur collared coats inspect the front of their  flat building
Reading their doom, Joe and Ratso, continue on, disappearing into the subway
-  - Joe stands alone, watching the midnight cowboys ply their trade
Camera pulls back as Joe turns away and enters a store front blood bank, offering ten dollars to blood donors
huge hypodermic fills the frame, sucking Joe's blood
Ratso coughs uncontrollably
- Ratso leans over the tub-sink, dry-heaving while he coughs, wearing a sheepskin coat much too large for him
He controls the cough with effort -- hearing the door open and close
-- wipes his mouth and turns to grin at
Joe, trying to light the empty Sterno can, deliberately ignoring Ratso
Ratso shrugs, washes his mouth at the faucet, finds a cigarette butt and lights it, careful to avoid inhaling the first puff
Shee-it
Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag
You make me puke
Where'd you steal it
In the movies
The coat
guy  did a favor once gave it to me
Christ
Who'd you ever do a favor for
You just let some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn't you
Joe slams ten dollars on the table
Ratso glances at Joe with curious concern
Where'd that come from
Forty-second Street
Where'n hell you think it come from
You wanna know the truth
You dumb bastard,  got it for you
Look at it
Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me
Ratso pulls off the coat and throws it at Joe
Wear it yourself
wouldn't put it on my back
Joe throws it back at Ratso
Goddamned if 'll wear it
Ratso hurls it in a corner
Joe shoves the ten at Ratso
Go get your medicine
Before you die on my goddam, hands
- High angle -- Joe and Ratso cross an foot, chilled by wind, neither wearing the sheepskin coat
The Queens riverfront and factories appear cold and bleak, deserted on Sunday
- Camera moves into acres of tombstones, piled like low-rent housing projects for the dead, the various faiths segregated by crumbling boundaries
' Shee-it
hate boneyards
' So split
He ain't your goddam, father
- Ratso leads Joe past a Negro family at a grave -- glances around -- snatches an elaborate floral piece from a headstone and hides it under his black raincoat as he darts toward a low dividing wail and swings himself over into
- an endless section of plain stone markers
Joe touches his hat to two nuns, guiltily hurrying to overtake Ratso at ibis father's grave, indistinguishable from the other graves except for the name on the headstone
Ratso places the floral piece on the grave with almost absurd solemnity
Joe laughs
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect
Respect shee-it
You even steal flowers for his grave
Can he smell the difference, eh
Joe reads from the ribbon on the floral display
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'
He can't read
Even dumber than you
Couldn't write his own name -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone
One big lousy  like our flat
Condemned
By order of City Hall
Joe is frowning, standing at the,headstone, momentarily depressed with an undefined sorrow
My Grammaw Sally Buck, she died without letting me know
'   - Through the window, past the   sign, the tarnishing driers are lined up like tombstones
- Joe frowns, puzzled, as Ratso pulls out a black skullcap, leading Joe toward a group of professional mourners, whispering: Just keep your hat on and cry a little
They tip you when it's over
Joe and Ratso join the mourners as the funeral moves to the grave, Ratso mouthing an authentic double-talk
Joe standing self-consciously, aware of the covert glances of the other mourners, automatically reaching up to remove his hat, remembering when Ratso elbows him in the ribs
Joe scowling, tight-lipped, embarrassed by the tip that is thrust in his hand
- weary Santa Claus, in a rented beard and over-large costume, warms his hands over the steam of his coffee cup
Joe and Ratso are arguing farther down the counter
Just ain't right, cheating someone dead and can't cheat back
In the background, as Ratso speaks,  and enter the lunch counter, inspecting the customers one by one
Both wear black turtlenecks and jeans, dressed as twins, both blond and pretty
You and my old man
Same kinda mind
Putting me down till the day he died
(mimics) why can't you be like your brothers
Sons a father could be proud of
Yeah, sure
My brothers
Too goddam busy making something of themselves to show up when the old man's dying
Conditioned reflex, Ratso starts to cough
Joe sees the MacAlbertsons in the mirror, standing behind him, studying him
Gretel nods, Hansel hands Joe a large black card, smiling vaguely, then moves on
(') What was that all about
Joe studies the black card, frowning at first, suddenly smiling, turning as if to call after the MacAlbertsons, but they are disappearing around the corner
Joe hands the card to Ratso
You wanna read something, read this
been invited somewhere
Shocking pink letters on the black card read -- -
(') They picked me
The only one in the whole goddam place
You see how they looked me over, up and down before they give me that
So
Joe sees a young man washing cups behind the counter
Joe shakes his head, wonderingly, turning to study himself in the mirror
Well, this thought just struck me
It wasn't too long ago  was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas
Yeah, well, so
Now 'm here
'm in New York City
Getting picked for things
Don't you see what 'm driving at
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party
Did  say that
Did
(studies card) It don't say nothing about you
Don't say nothing about you either
But they picked me, right
So what 'll do, 'll just say, now look, you want me
Well,  don't go nowhere without my buddy here
(shrugs) Well, what the hell,  got nothing better to do
- Snow swirls in the aureole of a street light as Joe and Ratso run, heads lowered, turning into
- a drab entrance hall, dimly lit -- signs identifying various commercial tenants -- a pink-on-black placard reading ,
Joe has started up before he notices Ratso, leaning on the bannister at the foot of the stairs, struggling to catch his breath
His face and hair are wet with perspiration, his lips lavender-blue
In swift flashes -- intercut -- Joe reads the panic in Ratso's eyes, so intense that Joe shares it, unable to speak or offer reassurance
Better dry your hair some
You sweating all over the goddam place
Joe pulls out his shirttail, grabs Ratso by the neck and rubs his head dry
(') You got a comb
Don't need a comb
Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess
Joe hands Ratso his own comb
Ratso swipes at his tangled hair angrily until two teeth break in the comb
He hands the comb back, tugs at his hair with his fingers, pats it in place, then looks back into Joe's eyes
Okay
look okay
In a moment of silence, distant sounds can be heard -- a siren, the grinding teeth of a garbage truck, the twang of an electric guitar upstairs at the party -- then Ratso makes a quick gesture of impatience and starts up the stairs, pulling himself on the bannister
'  - bank of lights blinds Joe and Ratso as they enter -- electronic rock blasts their ears -- a bearded cameraman on a step-ladder photographs them as they stand confused -- facing a monstrous collage of tabloid photos blown up, showing the murder of a hippie known as Groovy -- in-huge black letters, --
Joe shouts over the amplified music
Better get a hold of someone and tell them 'm here
Ratso points to his ear -- he can't hear -- following Joe across the room
The huge loft is crowded with a random selection, gathered to serve as dress extras in an underground film
The party is the scene
The MacAlbertsons merely supply the ingredients and allow it to happen, with cameras strategically placed to record the happening
Hansel with tape recorder, Gretel with hand-held camera drifting through the crowd -- catching words and images in a detached, whimsical fashion
Gretel turns her camera on Joe and Ratso as they approach
(') Well,  made it
This here is Ratso Rizzo and
Rico
Rico Rizzo
Gretel smiles without recognition
Hansel gestures vaguely
Do you need anything
mean there's beer and so forth
Whatever your thing is
The twins move away together, pausing to confer with the operator of a tripod camera -- focused on an emaciated flower girl with long hair and dirty feet, stretched in a sarcophagus, clutching a dead daffodil, her eyes glazed
Scrawled in huge letters on the wall over her head --
If you want the word on that brother and sister act, 'll give you the word
That Hansel's a fag and Gretel's got the hots for herself
So who cares, right
Load up on the salami
Ratso heads for the refreshment table
Joe starts after him but pauses, intrigued by an alcove under the balcony where a light show is in progress -- surreal images of naked bodies projected against abstract currents of color and strobe light
a bored fat lady in a muu-muu, squatted like a Buddha at a low table, rolling joints for the guests
She lights a joint and offers it to Joe as he wanders in to watch the show
Joe laughs delightedly when he realizes what it is
Shee-it, this is one helluva party
glancing around at the others, imitating their techniques -- the quick inhaler, who follows with sharp gulps of air - the deep inhalers who draw air as they inhale -- the stylist who lets the smoke drift out and inhales through the nostrils -- Joe puffing himself slightly dizzy, starting to laugh at the silent flick effect of the strobe light -- the action around him slowing almost imperceptibly, overcranked -- a veil of smoke hanging over the fat woman's face, transforming her into a laughing witch -- a similar veil around Joe's head, relaxing the self-conscious tension of his face, spontaneously curious about the play of light on his hand, grinning at
a serious young technician handling the light show, scattering psychedelic stars across a sky of magenta flesh
Joe reaching for the stars as he rises and wanders back to the crowded loft, fascinated to see
a crew with cameras and lights, on the balcony at one end of the loft, photographing the scene below
a dark-haired lady by the name of  -- chic in the style of a gangster's moll -- drinking beer from the bottle, predatory eyes searching the crowd
Ratso surreptitiously stuffing his pockets from the buffet table, glancing nervously over his shoulder, unaware of Gretel and her hand-held camera, photographing Ratso as he steals, turning away casually, disinterested
Joe laughing as he dances for a moment with a tall black girl -- the lights swinging around them -- faces swimming
Shirley in fleeting close-up, gone in an instant, reappearing
- her face in the mirror smiling in a dark, provocative way -- Joe standing at the bathroom door, forgetting to be embarrassed as Shirley turns away from the mirror, unhurriedly, running her fingers through her hair, boldly meeting Joe's eyes
can tell, can't you
Yeah, oh yeah
What'll we do
Leave now or what
Your place or mine
Oh God, the second  looked at you  knew
Did you
Joe grins, watching Shirley's lips move, unable to keep her in sync, startled to hear Ratso's voice
' She's hooked
'  - Joe realizes he is back at the party, Ratso whispering hoarsely
'd say she was good for ten bucks, but 'll ask for twenty
But Joe is watching with terrible fascination as Hansel and Gretel lift the flower girl from her sarcophagus
' Did you know
We were going to make it
Joe glances down to see himself flanked by Ratso and Shirley
You really want to do business
Who's he
Oh God
Don't tell me you two are a couple --
The flower girl, hypnotically dazed, accepts a broom dipped in black paint and smears a huge  across
Joe laughs
' Why are you laughing, Joe
Hansel holds a microphone toward Joe, who shrugs, grinning at Ratso and Shirley
Gretel's camera moves down Joe's body
Are you for real, Joe
Well,  ain't a f'real cowboy, but 'm one hell of a stud
Shirley glances at Ratso, who nods, whispering in her ear
very expensive stud
And  happen to be his manager
The scene -- from Joe's viewpoint -- becomes increasingly confusing and fragmented, dialogue and image moving in and out of focus, cameras and lights surrounding him, keeping the center of attention in his own blown mind
Shirley's eyes unnaturally bright, inspecting his body, lingering on his thighs, moistening her lips
It's too much -- to come face to face with a walking talking sex fantasy -- to buy a man's -- God
the tall black girl dancing in stroble light, starting to remove her clothes -- Gretel following her with a camera
' can't wait to tell my man Monday
should be taking notes
Look at my arm
Shirley's talon-like fingernails caressing the gooseflesh on her tanned arm
' gotta sit down
feel crummy
Ratso stretched out on a Victorian love seat -- the flower girl walking unsteadily, passing out dead daffodils, placing one in Ratso's hand Gretel photographing his reaction
' Eat it -- a man in your line of work has to keep his strength up
Shirley bringing Joe a massive sandwich on a paper plate, watching him bite into it
It's fantastic, now  know, everything you do has sexual implications
If  you know, bought it -- could take pictures of you naked
That's part of it, isn't it, kinky kinda things
the tall black girl and a few others are trying to promote an orgy
scrofulous old wino dances spastically, working his toothless gums, preparing to expose himself to two girls dancing together
' We want you, Joe
You've been chosen
five youths stand beside the sarcophagus -- two sailors, two cycle freaks, a weight-lifter -- waiting to be pallbearers
Joe joins them
All lights and cameras are turned on the slow funeral procession, carrying the flower girl out of the loft to the tune of "Moonlight and Roses"
Strobe light adds to the unreality of the scene
' had a thing for him
Before knew
Why should knowing make it more of a thing
Shirley talks to Gretel as she photographs the funeral
Naturally 'll have to ask myself why a cowboy
And why a cowboy whore
But not tonight
- Shirley is pulling her coat out of the pile on the bannister
Incidentally, how much is this going to cost me anyway
Joe turns to Ratso, whose attention is fixed on the coats
Tell her, Ratso
Twenty bucks
Sold
Let's go
and taxi fare for me
Get lost
agree
And for that service charge one dollar taxi fare
She takes a dollar from her purse and hands it to Ratso, takes Joe's arm and starts down the stairs
Ratso lingers, starting quickly through the coats, frisking them for loose change
- At the foot of the stairs, Shirley kisses Joe violently
Your name's Joe
Which is fabulous
Joe could be anyone
Kiss me, Joe, move over, Joe, go away, Joe
It's just perfect
They glance up as Ratso appears, swinging down too rapidly on the bannister
He misses a step and falls -- a clown's fall, unable to stop but apparently not hurting himself
Shirley and Joe are laughing when Ratso lands at the foot of the stairs
(') He fell
Hey, fella, you fell
Is he all right
(rises, mimics) Is he all right
Well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister
Can you walk or not
Walk
Naturally  can walk
He's got taxi fare
Sure you're all right
(shouts) said yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
- Joe and Shirley are kissing
Shirley rolls away, flushed, fanning herself
Joe rolls down the window
- Joe leans out of the taxi window, waving his Stetson, bellowing at the snow
Whoopee ti yi yo
- Ratso makes his way slowly from the building to the curb, whistling between his teeth sharply, hailing a cab
The cab slows to a stop
Then the driver sees Ratso, shifts into gear and drives on
Ratso bites his thumb after the cab, rests for a moment on the lamp post, then starts painfully inching his way along the deserted street
'  - Joe lies on his back, staring fixedly at a fragile mobile hanging from the ceiling, stirring listlessly
' That happens
Don't worry about it
Shirley leans on one elbow, looking at Joe sympathetically, fighting an almost irrepressible desire to laugh
Still avoiding Shirley's eyes, Joe finds a cigarette on the side table, searches for matches
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar
Uh, where's the matches, ma'am
Top drawer
Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better
Joe finds the matches, lights up and lies back, staring at the mobile as he smokes, still not looking at Shirley
First goddam, time it ever quit on me
Fact
The repressed laugh finally breaks through
Shirley stifles it quickly as Joe sits up, looking at her
(') You think 'm lying
(controls herself) No
Of course not
Just something struck me funny
Close on Joe -- watching Shirley closely, reacting
' just put myself in your shoes had this image of a bugler without a horn, a policeman without a stick, etcetera, etcetera and
(giggles) think 'd better shut up, 'm making it worse
Shirley composes her face, reaching out to touch Joe
But that doesn't help either
He reacts sharply
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens
ain't sleepy
know
Scribbage
Extreme close-up of Joe -- frowning, puzzled
Shee-it
camera pulling back to show Joe concentrating on a game, spread out on the sheet, consisting of nine dice lettered on all sides, the object being to build as many words as possible, Scrabble fashion, while a sand timer counts the seconds
Shirley watches Joe's efforts to think with sympathetic amusement
The only word Joe has composed so far is
That's pretty Freudian, Joe
What
It's a perfectly good word, ain't it
How much time  got
(glances up) Goddam sand thing drive you crazy
Kee-rist
Spelling never was a very strong point with me
Even in school
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more
Talking helps
Don't talk, you get muddled in your head
Hey
Now you just look at this here
Joe spells out , down from the  in
There's an  in
If that's your word
--- -- 'm right
That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here
---
(stifles giggle) Okay
Never argue with a man
-- what in hell starts with
Shirley slyly trails the tips of her fingernails across Joe's chest as she leans over to study the game, breathing softly into his ear as she speaks
It can end in  day, pay, lay -- hey, pay lay
One predatory hand rests on his knee -- as if by accident - disarranging the sheet, talon nails lightly brushing his thigh
Cut it out
That's cheating, teasing me so  can't think
Just one bitsy  word and  gonna beat you
You gonna beat me, Joe
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think
Gay ends in
Fey
You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem
show you what problem -- But the end of his sentence is swallowed by Shirley, taking his kiss in her open mouth, crushed by its impact, an animal noise snarling deep in her throat -- the agonized alley cat wail of pleasure -- Joe's problem is solved
Joe's love theme swells triumphant
At the same time, Shirley half-rises, trying to force Joe's head down, her own on top
The issue is joined
Shirley has named the game
Her objective is to force Joe onto his back
Joe's objective is to retain his initiative
Camera ignores the classic action on the central front, concentrating exclusively on peripheral tactical maneuvers
Joe's elbows pinning her shoulders
her eyes bright, accepting the challenge
his tight smile revealing clenched teeth
her fingers searching out then tickling his underarm
Joe laughing as he falls lopsidedly
Shirley laughing triumphantly
his hand closing on her wrist
her talon-nails clawing the air
her toes walking up his calf
her legs suddenly locking around his knees
her free hand grabbing his hair
her shoulder rising as she forces his head back
her lips pressing down on his
his hand swatting an unidentified mass of flesh
her eyes popping, teeth clamping his ear lobe
his hand catching her ankle
her teeth losing the ear lobe as she screams
her foot appearing upside down beside her face
her talon-nails furrowing flesh, drawing blood
his head rearing back, roaring
both rolling to the floor, out of view
her feet suddenly flying up into view
her hand tugging rhythmically at the blanket
her other hand wildly exploring Joe's back
her ankles locking spasmodically
her eyes and mouth wide, gaping
the blanket suddenly ripping free, flying into the air as her arm flings itself around Joe
the bedclothes spilling down around them, muffling her ascending shrieks
' Whoopee ti yi yo
'  - Shirley has difficulty reverting to her nine-to-five role as a Madison Avenue career girl
Half-dressed for work, she is talking on the telephone, her eyes on the open door to the bathroom, through which Joe's voice continues singing
Well,  really can't talk now, if you know what  mean, but believe me when  say, Myra, it's an experience every emancipated woman owes herself
'm not
'm not exaggerating
Well, what's Phil's poker night
(yells off) Joe -- are you available next Thursday, eight-thirty
'  - Thoroughly shaved, bathed and groomed, Joe is sprinkling an expensive cologne into his boots
He yells back enthusiastically
Well, lemme think now, Thursday, eight-thirty, yeah,  guess  could be available
Hell, yeah
'  - Shirley turns back to the phone
Joe appears, grinning
Why don't you just come here
'll be working every night this week
'll leave a key with the super
' Well, ma'am -- Shirley --  sure hate to trouble you, but
Shirley opens her purse, savoring the moment
As she places the money in Joe's hand
'  - Joe slaps a bill on the counter, admiring a fine new cowboy shirt in the mirror, wriggling new white socks into his boots
Suddenly remembering, he goes to the sock rack and buys two pairs, one large and one small
Gradually dominating, Joe's love theme recurs, continuing over
- Joe slaps down money to pay for an assortment of medicine
- Joe takes the stairs two at a time to burst in on
- Ratso huddled in the overstuffed chair -- wearing the stolen sheepskin coat -- wrapped in blankets, his teeth chattering, in spite of the sweat on his forehead
Joe stops abruptly, his mood shattered by Ratso's alarming condition
They simply stare at each other for a moment, then Joe turns away to see soup heating on the Sterno stove
Joe tosses one of his paper bags onto Ratso's lap
See what you think of that crap
'll pour your soup
Got some of that junk you like to swill, too
Mentholatum
Aspirin
All that shee it
Ratso opens the paper bag, trying to control his shivering, pulling out the socks and a suit of long underwear
He sees Joe watching him for a reaction
The best Ratso can do is a slight shake of his head
(') They wrong
No
But while you was buying the underwear,  could have lifted the socks
You couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl
Can you hold this
Joe hands Ratso the soup
Ratso seems steadied by the warmth in his hands
He nods, sipping the soup
But thanks
(hesitates, then) Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything
You promise
Yeah
Well,  don't think  can walk
(embarrassed) mean,  been falling down a lot and, uh
And what
'm scared
What of
What'll happen
mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ
Who
don't know
Cops
Or the -- how should  know
Ratso is trembling so violently that the sou, starts to slop over
Joe takes it and sets it on the table
Okay
Here it is
You gonna go see the doctor
got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and  gonna be riding high before you know it
So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what
No doctors
No, sir
Not me
Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics
Fix one-thing, unplug another
Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver
My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n  am when he went to the doctor
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do
Die on me
'm going to Florida, that's my only chance
You know what's wrong with you
You got fevers
You kinky as a bedbug
How you gonna get to Florida
'll find the money
If you just get me on the bus, that's all ask
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this
don't even want you to go
Whaddya think of that
got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women
One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City
It's laughable
Joe sets his Stetson on his head
When  put you on that bus down to Florida tonight, that'll be the happiest day of my life
- Joe strikes a match with his thumbnail and watches it curl away while he waits, hearing a phone ring
Then the phone is answered by a woman's voice
Hey, Shirley
Miss who
Oh, yeah, well, when will Missus Gardner be home
'm a friend of hers, a goddam good friend
Shee-it, can't wait till then
Joe hangs up while the answering service's voice is still talking
The match has burned out
Joe flips it away
Headline --
- Joe loiters outside a gag headline print shop, his eyes following a man in homburg and chesterfield
/
- Joe lingers momentarily, identifying with the violence in a jazz drummer, his eyes searching for a pickup
- Joe tests his skills in a shoot-down with a large metal cowboy and kills him, a recorded voice sneaks, "Got me
" as the cowboy slumps
Joe glances off as he hears polite applause
' Bravo
-- a stout, round-faced man -- clasps Joe's hand between both of his own, like an old friend
How are you
(more quietly) Townsend
Locke, from Chicago
Call me Towny
'm here to attend a paper manufacturers' convention and, frankly, to have a little fun, dammit
Towny grips Joe's elbow, almost forcibly leading him away
- Towny's face appears huge at Joe's shoulder
This is my first night in town and 'll consider it a ghastly omen clouding my entire ten days, if you don't consent to have dinner with me
Anywhere you like
Towny's mouth continues speaking at an incredible rate, but his words are drowned out momentarily by the grinder of a sanitation truck, chewing up a discarded Christmas tree with tinsel clinging to it
Towny is still talking when they've passed the truck
(') never mind how you're dressed
They know me
'll say you're with the rodeo
There's always a rodeo in New York, dammit
Besides, you look very elegant
- Joe hardly notices 'Daniel on a far cornet, his whining scarcely audible
"Ye are the salt of the earth, Jesus said, but if the salt hath lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted
" But, dammit all,  just remembered, we'll have to eat in my room because  have this phone call coming at nine-thirty
'   - An ancient open cage lift
What  like about you, you're such a wonderful conversationalist
So won't that be nice to have dinner sent up
'   - threadbare, carpeted but spacious hallway
Fifty years ago this was the only hotel in Manhattan
My mother always calls me at her bedtime, so 've got to be there
' -  - The room has little to recommend it except its size and large French window, through which -- ignored by Joe -- the Mutual tower flashes
Towny waves Joe toward the couch, quickly slipping several physical culture magazines from the coffee table onto a shelf beneath
drink
've got some nice gin
If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up
Gin's okay
It's so exciting
New York
The mad forward thrust of everything
My sense of time here is completely altered
- Joe carries Ratso down the stairs, wrapped in a blanket
' -  - The coffee table is littered with empty cartons of Chinese food, soaked through with brown sauce
Joe finds the last egg roll and eats it as Towny's voice drones on
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago
There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die
But he didn't
Isn't that amusing
What
Towny's dialogue moves out of sync
Towny's eyes seem to look into camera -- from Joe's viewpoint -- but slightly past it
The quality of the scene grows increasingly disjointed as Joe glances around the room, looking for something to steal, losing personal contact with Towny, viewing him as an object to be used for a specific purpose
Enough about me
'm through talking for the evening
Now  want to hear about conditions in the West
The romance of the West holds a tremendous power over me
Mother was actually a pioneer woman, can you believe it
When she calls, 'll introduce you and she'll be so thrilled
- Ratso sits an a stoop while Joe hails a cab
'  - Towny's voice is only a shrill monotone from here, Joe searches with increasing desperation for something of value
An old electric razor is too bulky for Joe's pocket, probably worthless anyhow
Towny's array of medicines merely recalls Joe's purpose
' Mama, a coincidence
Guess who was being discussed
Discussed
Not disgusted
Discussed
Do you have that thing turned up
Why aren't you wearing it
This is impossible
- Joe lifts Ratso from the taxi and carries him inside
' Listen, Towny, did  mention  got a sick kid
'  - Joe is rehearsing the speech in the bathroom mirror
Well, he is, he's sicker'n shee-it
And 've gotta get him South quick as  can
- Joe stands in a long line, glancing impatiently at the clock while Ratso waits on a bench, wrapped in his blanket
' -  - Towny is stretched out on the couch, staring morosely
was so childish with her
Joe moves into frame past camera, standing in front of him, so that we can see the scene from behind Joe's waist
What d'you want
What
What you got me up here for
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult
You're a nice person, Joe -- should never have asked you up -- a lovely person
Oh, how  loathe life
loathe it
Please go
Please
You want me to leave
No, yes
No,  mean yes please go
Help me to be good
Come back tomorrow
Promise
'm going to Florida
This is terrible
meet someone who -- then -- wait,  want to give you a present
For your trip
You'll let me please
- Joe's face is expectant, next in line at the ticket window
He nods reassuringly toward Ratso
' -  - Joe's face is puzzled then angry as Towny takes a Saint Christopher medal from his sack and hands it to Joe
His eyes are looking past Joe, his speech out of sync
Please take it
You don't have to be Catholic
Saint Christopher is the patron saint of all travelers
want you to have it
For helping me be good
- It's Joe's turn
The clerk looks at him expectantly
' -  - Joe's voice is angry
Listen,  gotta have money
Oh
Yes
Of course
should have thought
You shouldn't have to ask
That was thoughtless of me
Yes
Wait here
Towny hurries across the room to the bedside table
Beside the telephone is a picture of a prosperous pioneer woman wearing a hearing-aid
Towny tries to conceal his movements as he takes a wallet from the drawer, lifts out a bill and tucks the wallet back and turns -- terrified to see Joe close behind him -- almost knocking the lamp off the table in his fright
Pressed against the table, protecting but calling attention to his wallet, Towny holds out the bill
(') Here
Don't even thank me
(takes the bill) gotta have more'n ten
gotta have fifty-seven dollars
simply don't have it, Joe
Get outta my way
You're wasting your time
There's nothing in there
Towny clutches the table, staring at Joe, shaking his head like a bad little boy
Joe backhands him angrily
Trying to duck the blow, Towny stumbles and slips to the floor, but grabs the table in his arms, watching Joe out of the corner of his eyes, whimpering
Joe grabs his hair, turning his face up
Let go
Let go of the table
Joe slaps him, but Towny clings more fiercely to the table as Joe tries to jerk it free
Joe strikes him with his fist
deserved that,  know  did
But he clutches the table wildly
His mother's picture falls unnoticed
Joe stands in panic, sickened, unable to fulfill the role Towny has assigned him
(') brought this on myself
'm bleeding, my nose is bleeding, isn't it
Towny's eyes shine, teeth clenched in a crazy smile, blood trickling from his nose
Suddenly Joe jerks the lamp free of its socket
You wanna gimme fifty-seven dollars or you wanna busted skull
Towny simply stares at the lamp
(') Please let go of that table
Joe threatens, swings the lamp down, but stops short of hitting Towny
Towny shrieks -- eyes rolling back as he falls limp -- loosing his grip on the table, leaning on the bed, laughing and crying hysterically
Joe has to step over him to reach the wallet in the drawer
He takes all the money -- probably twice what he needs -- desperate to get out of the room
- Joe carries Ratso up the steps onto the bus
' -  - Towny's shrill little whisper says
Thank you, Joe
provoking Joe to glance back
Towny is reaching for the telephone, his eyes on Joe with wild brightness, holding his hand on the receiver
Joe knocks the phone from his hand, hits Towny in the mouth, jerks the cord from the wall as Towny falls -- gagging -- finally dislodging his dentures on the carpet
Joe stands sick and confused, holding the useless phone in two hands
- The bus driver revs the powerful engine, shifting gears
' -  - Joe is about to hang the dead receiver on its hook when on sudden impulse -- he shoves the small end of the receiver into the toothless mouth of the man on the floor
- The bus roars into the tunnel
- Joe and Ratso sit near the rear of the bus
Ratso's teeth chatter, wrapped in the blanket
Thirty-one hours
They ride a few moments in silence
(') The trip is
Nine-thirty in the morning we get there
Not this morning but the next one at nine thirty
Both nod for a moment in silence
These guys're good drivers
They gotta be
Yeah
- The bus tires sing as it speeds South
- Joe and Ratso have reversed places, putting Ratso by the window
Joe watches a middle-aged couple try on their new straw hats, unaware that Joe is watching them
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that
read it
Shee-it
You believe all you read
- The metal grating rings as the bus soars onto it
- Two aging young ladies in brand-new resort wear are casually examining Joe, along with the other men on the bus, but Joe is frowning at Ratso, who shivers despite the bright sun
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more
been thinking
hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there
Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway
Keep the goddam blanket on
mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you
Sounds like they knew you
Sounds like crap, admit it
And 'm not gonna have it
'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me
That's agreed, okay
We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico
Joe nods
Ratso closes his eyes, momentarily at peace
- The bus passes a Florida hotel sign too swiftly to read it
- Joe frowns in his sleep, awakens, lifts his Stetson to see Ratso wide awake, in misery, wiping tears from his eyes
Hey -- whatsa matter
(barely audible) 'm wet
You're what
wet my pants
My seat's all wet
Hell, don't cry about it
Here  am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough,  gotta pee all over myself
Joe laughs suddenly, uncontrollably
(') 'm falling apart, that's funny
(nods, laughing) You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule
Ratso begins to laugh with Joe as if it were the funniest thing they'd ever heard
Then Ratso's face pales as he starts to choke and cough
Joe pats him on the back
(') Hey, what size pants you wear
- The bus is parked in the distance
Joe comes from a clothing store, bare-headed, wearing plain slacks and sport-shirt
He carries the boots, Stetson and cowboy suit in one hand, a bundle under his arm
He dumps his cowboy regalia in the trash bin of a sandwich stand and calls to the
Couple crullers'n coffee to go
The Waitress draws coffee, wraps crullers
Where you from
New York
Joe pays
She smiles, gives him change
Joe smiles, starts on toward the bus, hardly aware that he has accomplished something rare and remarkable for Joe -- a simple human contact without fear or threat, a pleasant everyday happening
- Joe and Ratso have moved to the seat farthest back, wider than the others
Joe blocks the view of the other passengers as he helps Ratso into a new pair of corduroy pants and a Florida shirt
In the middle of the operation, Ratso dozes off
Joe shakes his head, scowling, annoyed, but continues, lifting Ratso enough to slide the pants around his waist
Ratso awakens as Joe zips the fly
Hey, what the hell you doing
'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think 'm doing
They both smile
It isn't funny enough to laugh at
Joe arranges the blanket, takes out a package of cigarettes, glances at Ratso and puts it away
- Palm trees are streaking past the window
The sun is glaring hot
group of kids in bare feet and straw hats wave to the bus as it passes
- Ratso's eyes squint in a dazed half-sleep
Joe leans across to pull down the shade
He hesitates a moment, watching
past his reflection, a group of young men on their way to work, carrying lunch pails, dressed exactly as Joe is now dressed
then Joe lowers the blind and seats himself
Ratso nods slightly, his voice practically inaudible
Thanks, Joe
Shee-it, you know,  got this thing all figured out, Ratso
mean Rico
When we get to Miami, what 'll do, 'll go to work
gotta do that, 'cause see,  ain't no kind of a hustler
ain't even any goddam good as a bum
'm a nothing, that's what  am
So reckon 'd better go to work and get me a goddam job
Okay
Joe glances at Ratso, but there is no response
Surreptitiously, Joe takes out a cigarette, turns his face away from Ratso and lights it, hiding it cupped in his hand as he smokes
(') Yeah, guess that's what 'm gonna do
They ride for a moment in semi-darkness, Joe smoking, looking at the other people on the bus, brighter without the shades down
Joe turns, checking the blanket around Ratso, noticing that Ratso is sitting in a peculiarly stiff, awkward position
Joe leans over to straighten Ratso's head, blocking our view for a moment
Then Joe leans back, frowning, thoughtful
We still do not see Ratso's face
Joe rises slowly, starting forward in the bus
passing an older couple, a schoolgirl, two ladies with straw hats, a young man trying to read, pausing when he reaches
the , staring out at the Sunshine Parkway with the Driver, leaning over so he won't have to speak too loudly
Yes, sir
, My friend's dead in the back seat
Your friend's what in the back seat
Dead
Dead as a doornail
Is this some kind of
He glances at Joe, then pulls off the road and stands up
(') Okay, folks, everything's fine
Nothing to worry about
The passengers crane their necks as Joe follows the Driver to the rear of the bus
The passengers at the rear are staring ahead, trying not to see what is going on
The Driver touches Ratso, straightens, touches his hat, but doesn't remove it
(') Is he kin to you
Joe nods no
(') Don't you want to close his eyes
Close them
Just reach over and close them
That's all
Joe closes Ratso's eyes
(') guess we'll just drive on, right
Nothing else to do
No, sir
Not till Miami
'll see to burying then
The Driver moves to the front and turns to the passengers
Just a little sickness, folks, nothing serious
We'll be in Miami
(looks at watch) in forty minutes
- Joe sits stiffly, very frightened, as the bus starts on
Then he glances at Ratso, frowning, reaches out an arm and puts it around Ratso, settling back, staring straight ahead
