Written by Craig Brewer Only one kind of blues
And that consists between male and female
- Son House '  - is naked
Wrapped around her shoulders is a loose-knit spread that conceals her slender form
She is in her 20's: a strawberry blond, with cinnamon freckles spotted across her pale skin
She is beautiful without trying
She stares at the distant trees
This is the South; the small town of ,
Soon Rae will be alone
: '  - is 25 years old
His hair is cropped in a military issue buzz
Rae's face is wet with tears as Ronnie gently makes love to her
She touches his face and sobs like a child
: '  - is dressed in his National Guard fatigues, packing up his gear
Rae is now wearing a short jeans skirt and a -shirt with a gray wolf print ironed on the front
There is a knock at the door
Rae flinches
Ronnie opens the door revealing , Ronnie's buddy from high school
Still need a lift
Yeah
Transmission's shot
Gill and Rae's eyes meet
Gill sees that Rae is crying
Gonna have a smoke
Ronnie shuts the door and feels a wave of sudden nausea
He rushes past Rae
Shit
'  -  - Ronnie is vomiting into the toilet as Rae rubs his head
Each painful dry heave makes Rae comfort him more
Baby
'  - Ronnie places his duffle bag in Gill's truck
Rae begins to cough
You sick
Rae doesn't answer
Gill backs away, allowing Ronnie and Rae some privacy
The two lovers stare into each others eyes and then embrace
Rae peeks over Ronnie's shoulder at Gill with an expression of dread
Anger seizes her
This ain't gonna work
Rae
don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and  know this ain't gonna work
(holds her face in his hands) Rae don't do this now
It's stupid
It's so fucking stupid
Rae
Silence
Rae melts
Tears stream down her face
(reaches in his pocket) Look it
got somethin' for us
This is gonna help, okay
You gonna miss your bus
Ronnie removes a small digital watch and fastens it around her wrist
This watch here is gonna beep at midnight
Every night
That's when it comes up on you the hardest, right
Ronnie holds out his own wrist to show her his identical watch
And wherever 'm at, my watch'll beep, too
We'll be thinkin' bout each other at the same time
Wherever we are
Rae is shaking
He grips her by the back of her neck and pushes their faces inches away
Eye to eye
gotta believe we can do this or ain't gonna make it, Rae
Rae sees the fear in his eyes
She swallows her own anxiety and nods
Okay
Okay
They kiss passionately
love you
Afraid of his swelling emotion, Ronnie quickly breaks away from her
Rae watches as her love leaves in Gill's pick-up
Compelled to follow, she absently walks after the truck, down the gravel drive
She stops
Silence
She is alone
An intense wave of sorrow hits, like a kick to her gut
She gasps for breath as she struggles to hold back the flood of her tears
Rae drops to her knees, right there in the gravel drive
Her hair falls in front of her face, masking her grief
Her shoulders shudder
Her middle finger begins to scratch at her thigh repeatedly -- a nervous habit that has always accompanied this burning sensation that consumes her
Shit
Tears come to her
She's not going to be able to stop it
Goddammit, Ronnie
(shouting in frustration) Rae is gripping the watch around her wrist for comfort
Her breathing is already out of her control
The dizziness is already upon her
The familiar burning
She inhales in gasps, rocking back and forth on her knees
The late morning cicadas chirp in an undulating frenzy
(shaking her head) Mm-mm (meaning "no") Mm-mm
Mm-mm
The scratching at her leg leaves a red mark
She is dizzy with anxiety
Her teeth are clenched, her face is flush
-
-
: - is fucking Rae from behind
Tehronne is a muscular, dark-skinned, black male in his late twenties
Rae's face is crammed up against the mirror in the small bathroom
Tehronne gets faster and pushes harder -- a stark contrast to her lovemaking with Ronnie
Rae comes
severe coughing fit hits her
She pushes him away with her ass
We're done, right
: - Walking with his hands shoved deep into his pockets, wearing his only suit and tie, is   ()
He is in his late fifties, black, a strong face under his old fedora
He stares across the street into Dunn's Cafe
, black, early forties, stands in the cafe
She looks confident and resolute in her new green skirt
brown Delta Olds pulls up into a parking space in front of Laz
Stepping out is
, Laz's longtime friend
He is also black and in his late fifties
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you
(no answer) Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind
never laid a hand on her in anger
Not a day
Not even when 's drinkin'
But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her
That kind of talk is between us
Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue
didn't start this,
Laz tries to stop his lip from quivering: the man is hurting
You wanna pray with me 'fore you go in
Laz
(
touches Laz's arm and bows his head) Heavenly Father
: '  - 's prayer is heard as Laz opens the front door to the cafe
He looks ill
Each step is painful
(
) We do not question your divine plan for us, Oh God
But in these times, when our spirit lies in shadow
When we are lost
Laz crosses to Rose's booth -- the distance seems to stretch out into eternity
(
) We ask that you give us strength
Give us strength that surpasses all understanding
In your name we pray
Amen
Laz sits across from his wife
Can't remember the last time  saw you in that suit
Your mother's funeral
's a pallbearer, remember
The waitress is kind and twangy as she asks for their order
Can  start you both off with some coffee 'fore  take your order
We won't be stayin' long
Coffee'll be fine
The waitress leaves
The sounds of the cafe fill the silence
We leavin' this weekend
Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company
(interrupting) If you come to talk about that muthafucka, 'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha
Think this about money still, ya old fool
Say what you gotta say, but  ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me
Not never
You hear
How many times we been over this, Laz
How many times
The waitress places the coffee between them and leaves
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this
Carryin' on behind my back
Make me out to look like a fool to all our people
Tell me, what's friendly about that
'm not ready to grow old, Laz
Livin' with you
feel it
Like 'm one foot in the dirt
Saw it happen to my momma
And that's not gonna happen to me
got living to do
And you gonna live it with him
Rose doesn't answer
Lazarus softens, touching her hand
Rose
Folks get sick
But you do what you can to get on the mend
Our marriage
it just got sick
That's all
Talk to me about sick
Ain't been right since  moved into that drafty house
keep the heat on
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time  passed
Kept us warm for twelve years
It's over
Laz has lost her for good
deserve better than this
Better'n me
Better than what you give
Rose
please
Laz
You can't say nothin'
If we get with a counselor
At the church, maybe they's
(the final interruption) don't love ya no more
The words are daggers
Laz is wounded beyond concealment
Rose picks up her purse, preparing to leave
'm sorry you hurtin'
But, like say, this the only life  got
(waits for him to respond) said my piece
She stands and attempts to walk away
Laz grips her tightly by the wrist
God forgive you, for how you done me
Let go
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry
And that's what you did
Ya bled me
Let go of my arm
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked
And this how you do me
,  said let
You better pray, gal
You better pray
(yanks free) Don't you lay a
The whole cafe is silent
All eyes are on Rose
(to customers) Yeah, go'on
Look
See if  give a shit about any of you people
And she's gone, right out the front door
: - Tehronne is taking his time hanging his ice around his neck and wrists as he stands shirtless before the mirror
Rae is lying on the bed
You got any money
Thought you had a man for that
(a heavy cough) said we wasn't gonna talk about him
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop
ain't callin' you no ho
But  ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither
Remember
you called me
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to
What'd  tell you
(kicks the bed) don't do none of that shit no more
'm in communications now
Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'
Rae starts coughing
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, 'm tellin' you
'm just lookin' ahead
(takes out his wallet) Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles
Hey, that's what you need, girl
Get you some cough medicine
What, you sick
Just a cough
Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it
(takes out money) Alright
How much you need, ho
The hell you call me
Eh, if the bootie fits
Tehronne catches Rae's wrist as she goes to slap
He quickly yanks her arm behind her back and bends her backwards, shoving his face close to her own
He grips the money in a fist and cocks it to punch -- all in jest
You gonna get rough
Is that what you doin'
Rae's chest begins to heave with deep breaths
Tehronne looks down at her legs as she anxiously rubs them together
(shakes his head) swear,  seen some buck-wild bitches in my time, but you the illest ever seen
Rae gets control of the burning
She takes the money
Just got a cough
: - Rae is prancing up the walkway on the square
Two young men dressed for construction pass Rae
It's already noon, Rae
You think that skirt should still be on
(flips them off) If it weren't you could kiss my rebel cootch, ya faggot
The men keep walking as Rae coughs
She turns toward the Fisherville Grocery
Cough drops or condoms
Rae stops in her tracks, looking up at her estranged mother, , smoking a cigarette outside the grocery store
Sandy has bleached hair with dark roots
She is in her late-forties: once a sexy girl, now she's lost all her tread
(surprised to see her) Didn't know you was workin' here now
just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests
(takes a drag) Your money ticket get shipped today
Rae walks away -- deeply affected by Sandy's presence
(calling after her) You let me know if  can be of any assistance
: '   - Laz drives an old green Ford pick-up
He pulls the truck up to the front of the feed store and kills the engine
, a 13-year-old black boy, comes out of the open loading door
You won't at the square this mornin'
Get me ten bags of mulch
Yes'sir
Lincoln runs off
Laz yanks off his black tie
'   - Lincoln slaps the last bag of mulch into the bed of Laz's truck
Laz hands Lincoln a twenty
Keep the change on that
Naw
got it, Mr
Lazarus
(makes change) You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans
Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk
That's what she said
Laz smiles
He takes the change
Climbs in his truck
Alright, Lincoln
You come on by, 'll load you up
: '  - Lazarus steers his tractor toward his small home in a sea of lush green kudzu
He kills the engine and looks beyond the nose of his tractor
He lights a cigarette
Below the nose is the head of a rose garden with a painted sign under it: Rose's Roses
Laz inhales smoke and exhales hate
The tractor lunges forward, trampling the garden, ripping the flowers to shreds
: ' - is a heavy, forty-year-old black woman
Her blue neon tube top matches her short pants stretched across her healthy ass
She is flipping through the juke box selection
You gonna put some Luther Vandross in here
Shit, he black ain't he
is reading a paper behind the bar
He's short and stout, looking like a sad bull dog
He black alright, he just ain't blue
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday
Used to have bands
all kind's live shit
Like a wake up in here, now
Folks can dance when they want
Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'
You seen my snake-skin shoes
Mayella lifts up her leg and stretches it over the bar with a provocative flourish
Her shoe is bright blue
They're from New York
My niece gets 'em on the computer
They got blue snakes up north
Mayella turns to Laz sipping a beer at the end of the bar
Naw
They got some blue dye, though
You think them boots you got on come from a black cow
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there
He the one got this place shakin' back in the day
Don't gotta tell me
Me and my girlfriends use-ta talk 'bout them hard fingertips he got pickin' that guitar
Got'em pickin' peas, not strings
Mayella moves in close, with the tips of her tits touching his arm
They still hard
Mayella
It ain't happened yet
Ain't happenin' tonight
(retreating with a glare) know you hurtin', Laz
got ears, you know
But you should know more'n me
ain't no better cure for them blues than some good pussy
Mayella saunters over to the pool table with the others
Whole lotta woman, right there
She can still spread it around
The door opens behind Laz
Bojo sees the man entering
Laz
We friends and all but
promise me you'll keep yo cool in my joint
Laz turns to see the door shut behind his brother,
He is younger than Laz and a bit smaller
Laz turns to Bojo
'm gonna finish my beer
Deke slowly approaches Laz at the bar
Mind if  sit
(no answer) Rose said
it didn't go too well this afternoon
See, that's not how we wanted this to go down
told her,  said, Rose, we ain't leavin' till we make peace with Laz
And that's God's truth
laid it down
You laid it down
did
Funny
Layin' it down
for my wife
We're not gonna get through this clean
But it don't need to get dirty
All this
it just come together unexpected
You think  want to hurt you
'd take a bullet for you, Laz
The dry look on Laz's face could cool the sun
You wanna give that a try
(to Bojo) Bo
You still got that
22 behind the tap
My little brother say he'd take a bullet for me
(into Deke's eyes) You come here to ease your heart
Well,  ain't gonna give it to you
You took her into your bed, now you gotta lie in it
Laz turns back to the bar
Deke begins to turn but stops
'll always love you, Laz
Till the end of my
In one quick movement, Laz grips Deke by the throat and smashes the bottom of his bottle into jagged shards
Laz pushes Deke back through the joint and slams him onto the pool table
He grips Deke's throat and holds the broken bottle up to his face
Cain slew Able
Slew him out of envy
And God put his mark on Cain for his sin
You want that mark, Deke
Give you that peace you come here for
'll give it to you, just say that shit again
Say you love me
Go'on
Say   ,
Lazarus slams the bottle down on the pool table, shattering it
Laz lifts his hand
His own blood leaks from between his fingers
He wipes the blood across Deke's face
'm through wit'cha both
Laz releases Deke and exits
Deke calls after him
What'chu gonna do
Nothin'
' '
Laz slams the door behind him
: -   - The bleachers are packed with three generations of fans and family cheering their boys on the high school football field
Rae is sitting with her two girlfriends,  and  -- two girls who graduated five years ago
(hands Rae a beer) Ronnie ship out this mornin'
It's so stupid
Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career
Says he wants to move
Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville
said, okay
How about now
Let's go
He'd be good for that
Shit, Ronnie knows cars
He get stubborn
Starts talkin' 'bout obligation and duty and all that
Shit
just want him to come home
swear, if somethin' happens to him
He fixed up that Buick for my uncle Dale
He say it purrs like a kitten every morning
Nothing's gonna happen
Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day
'll go outta my gourd
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'
Not like you're married
(takes a healthy swig) begged him not to go
And he did
(screaming at the field) : '  -   - Dirty South rap pounds the ears from a hoopty Olds with a backseat full of bass
Rae, Kell, and Jesse are walking up to the rowdy party through the variety of parked cars
girl rushes past the trio, vomiting on herself as a friend comes to her aid
These baby chicks just can't hold their Jello shots
'm tellin' ya
: '  -   - is one of the linebackers for the Fisherville Dusters
wasted girl sits on his lap as Kell rolls a joint
Tennessee Vols gotta practice indoors just so those Florida State sons-a- bitches don't spy on their plays with satellites and shit
Satellites
You mean in space
Uh-huh
Good thing you can block, Conner, cuz you're dumb as a sack of shit
Jesse notices Rae coughing
She pulls her aside as Conner rambles
You wanna go home
It gets worse there
Leavin' me to my own mind
That's just not good
(pours a shot of vodka) Here
Pound this and 'll join you
Rae and Jesse take a strong shot
It burns
One more
Fuck the chaser
As they pound one more, Rae notices Gill, Ronnie's friend, staring at her from across the room
Better
Yeah
and  approach Jesse and Rae
They are both sophomores, both skinny and harmless
Hey, Jess
Boys
You robotrippin' tonight
'm just gonna smoke
Rae peeks at Gill maneuvering through the room
(rummages in his pockets) Got eight packs of
Oxycontin
Got a shit load of Coricidin if you want to get out-a-body, n'all
You just trying to get me outta my clothes
Be right back
Rae pushes through the crowd of drunken kids to get to Gill
It's not like  can't go out and have fun with my friends
You think 'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'
Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders
You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you
You go to hell
Rae pushes through the crowd, back toward the others
(to Batson) How many to fuck me up
of: Batson popping out five red cough pills
Rae swallowing all five and chasing them with vodka
Conner's girl falls off his lap
Kell laughs
The laughter echoes and grows as we: : '  -   -  '  - : We never quite see the whole of what is implied
Rae's eyes, Jesse's mouth, a boy's shoulder
The room is packed with bodies
Rae laughs with pleasure as her eyes attempt to focus
The kid on top of her finishes and rolls off
What's so funny
Jesse is straddling a guy in an arm chair, Chinese-eyed and bouncing
Rae tries to respond coherently as another football player rolls her over on all fours and takes her from behind
(laughing) Oh
'm just on a water bed
And it's just
so
Goddamn
funny
few coughs
Rae focuses to see a younger guy sitting at her eye level
Hi
Hey
You ain't the kicker, are you
No, ma'am
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more
You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose
Can  put it in your mouth
Okay
: '  -   - Laz kills the rest of his whiskey
He squeezes his eyes closed as the liquor burns his throat
He tosses the bottle into a trash bag he is holding
Laz continues throwing out all of Rose's make-up and hair products
With one broad sweep, he cleans off her vanity
'  - Laz opens the front door and tosses the two bags outside
Stumbling, he kneels next to the coiled radiator against the wall opposite the door
He talks to it like an old friend
Seem like you and me
we drove her away
That's what we did
Now we
(singing softly) Drinkin' muddy water
a'sleep in a hollow log
thought
'  -   - Laz pulls out a guitar case from under the bed
He wipes a layer of dust off and opens it
'  -  - He gently cradles the guitar in his big hands and sits at his kitchen table
Tunes the strings
He closes his eyes, swimming in drunken sorrow
You gonna do this
Laz plays the blues, Mississippi, Bentonian style: one guitar, one voice, a mess of pain
(singing, his eyes closed) Just like a bird without a feather, you know 'm lost without your love
Just like a bird without a feather, you know 'm lost without your love
You know  need your love just like the angels need heaven above
The music continues as we: : '  -   -     - Lazarus's blues is all we hear as four guys chase Rae through the woods
She is in her shirt and panties, wearing football shoulder pads
She is completely wasted
Lost
The ground rocks back and forth with each step
Trees pass in a slow-motion haze
(singing) Well  sure did shot my baby, but did it because she did me wrong
Well  sure did shot my baby, but did it because she did me wrong
You know the judge called it murder now the penitentiary is my home
Rae grips a tree to steady herself, but a team member tackles her
The woods spin and distort as someone mounts her with ease
(singing) loved that woman, she said she didn't love no one but me
loved that woman, she said she didn't love no one but me
Rae smiles as she lifts her hand up to the stars, passing the writhing back of the guy on top of her
If she could just grab a star she would feel safe again
She tries to snatch one
She can't
Her hand drops as the boy stands and takes off after his friends tossing the football
Rae lies motionless on the ground
(singing) Yeah but  caught my baby cheating
: '  -  - tear rolls down Laz's cheek
(singing) Now my home ain't where it used to be
His guitar groans its last for the night
: '  -   -   - Rae is wasted
She is still wearing her shirt, panties and shoulder pads as she steps over passed-out teenagers
Jes
Jesse
(trips over a sprinkler) Oh shit
Wait
Wait
Stop what
Rae doesn't look up
The Coricidin is tripping her out
(coughing) The ground is
turnin' upside down
'm gonna
(coughing) 'm gonna fall off
Gill reaches down and pulls off the shoulder pads
The coughing fit passes
Oh
That feels so much better
: - Gill's truck flies down the dark road
'  - Rae is looking out the window, drifting in and out
Thought you had a skirt earlier
got others
Gill pulls to the side of the road and kills the engine
He watches Rae tilt her head from side to side
This thing you got
've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy
can see that
(shakes his head) But that nigger Tehronne
Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps
mean,  can see a tree
But that piece of shit
(lost in hazy sorrow) begged him
Don't see why he had to go
bet you did
Just had to get that black cock up in you
swear to God
What Ronnie sees
you disgust me
Gill grabs her legs and spreads them with no resistance
Her head rolls from side to side on the truck seat as Gill unzips his pants
Rae starts giggling
The fuck you laughin' at
(giggling) You don't got half what Tehronne got
Gill flinches upright
rage builds in his eyes
- From outside the steamed truck window, we see Gill beat Rae repeatedly
Silence
(muffled from the inside) Get up
ain't playin' Silence
He opens the truck door, fear in his eyes
Rae isn't moving
Blood is on her face
Oh, Jesus
hasty idea
He pushes her out of the truck
She falls to the dark pavement in a tangle of her own limbs
The door slams
Gill floors the gas
Rae lies motionless alone under the stars
Her watch alarm goes off: Beep-beep
Beep-beep
Beep-beep
: - Ronnie is asleep on the bus, unaware that his watch alarm in beeping at him
Guardsman sitting next to him shakes Ronnie awake
Hey
Ronnie silences the alarm
He regards the watch with sadness and affection
- The bus roars past
The red brake lights fade into night
: '  -  - Lazarus has fallen asleep sitting at his kitchen table
His eyes open
Standing is difficult
The guitar falls to the floor
The phone rings
Dizziness hits, but he manages to pick up the receiver
Huh
/ '  - is on his cell phone
He is placing hymnals in the back racks of the church pews
Bojo called
Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek
think you did alright by God under the circumstances
(
pauses) Your people are here for you, Laz
This is your home
No shame in showing your face
Don't know if God wanna see me
He knows where ya at
Just answer the door if he come knockin'
Laz hangs up the phone
: '  - Lazarus steps out onto his porch
He picks up the trash bags full of Rose's things and walks down the gravel drive to the road
'  -       - Laz tosses the bags inside his trash cans
He's really hung over this morning
His eyes squeeze shut, he grips his neck in pain
Mmmmmmmmmm
Mm
His eyes open
They remain fixed beyond us
The pain in his face is replaced with grave confusion
Rae lies on the side of the road
Her -shirt and panties are damp from the early morning mist, her face caked with dried blood
Her skin is deathly white, her mouth open, her eyes shut and swollen
Lazarus carefully steps toward her
He leans down over her face
Sweet
Jesus
Rae coughs
Laz flinches
: '  - The door slams against the wall as it swings open
Laz is carrying Rae, unconscious and limp, in his arms
He lays her down on the couch by the radiator
He pulls a quilt over her cold skin
With a twist of the valve the radiator moans to life
Laz takes out his bandana and cleans her face
He tries to wake her
Little lady
Miss
You need to open your eyes for me
Could ya do that
Her eyes open slightly -- just slits of white
There we go
There we go
Just like you doin'
Go'on
She whispers as she touches her fingers to his cheek
(a raspy inhale) Teh
Tehronne
Tehronne
Tehronne done this
labored breath followed by the most pitiful cough fit
Laz tries to calm her as her lungs fight for oxygen
Laz looks scared as the coughing stops in a desperate wheeze followed by silence
'  -  - Laz pulls the phone off its cradle on the wall and flips through the phone book
His fingers scan down the listings and stops on He dials and listens
(a recorded voice) You've reached the Fisherville Police Department
Your call will be answered in the order it was received
If this is an emergency, please, hang up and dial 9-1-
Slam
Fingers hit the phone cradle
Lazarus dials 911
As soon as he places the phone to his ear, he looks over at Rae sprawled out on his couch
Her bare legs can be seen peeking out from under the quilt
Fear hits him
He slams the phone down again
Laz crosses to the couch and gently touches her head
(softly) 'm'a go into town
Get you some medicine to fix you up
You just rest, okay, gal
You just sleep
Get that chill out'cha
Laz touches the radiator
It burns him
God
damn
- Laz's Ford roars down the shaded street towards town
: -   - Laz parks his truck in front of   and heads inside
An old black man named  sits on a bench next to an older white man in his early eighties holding a cane
is the paid caretaker of
How's the squash this year
It's good, Mister Melvin
'll bring ya some
Laz rushes inside
- The variety of cough medicine confuses Laz as he examines them
approaches Laz
She is dressed in a floral print dress with a white lab coat
Angela has a few extra pounds on her but she wears it well with her caring face and sweet manner
Lazarus
(startled) Oh
Gave me a start
'm sorry
It's these soft shoes wear for my back
You hurt it
'm standing most of my day
They're for support
(a smile) Didn't see you in church this mornin'
(tries to lie) Been on the crop
May need to get some extra hands if  don't want to work on Sundays
Well
It's good to see you
Angela wants the conversation to continue but Laz remains silent
She smiles awkwardly
Angela
Yes
need to uh
Go on, Laz
You can talk to me
My little niece
she got this deep cough
You take her to a doctor
(struggles to lie) No
No, she can't go
Mean to say
they's just no money fo'a doctor
Her daddy left for a job, and uh
give her to me to look on
just
(a pitiful pause) don't know what to do
Angela thinks for a moment
You wait right here
: '  - Snot and spittle has run down the side of Rae's face -- her eyelids stick together as she tries to open them
There is a creak, followed by another
Rae has become aware that someone is slowly walking up the front porch
The door opens
Silhouetted in the day's blinding light is a white man in his 40's
His face is indistinguishable to Rae's affected gaze
Is this a dream
He stands above her and lights a cigarette
The Zippo lighter clasps shut
The man lowers it to his side where Rae can see it clearly
bald eagle is printed on the side, a sight that makes Rae's eyes open wide in horror
Her breath grows deeper -- a girlish plea
This is no dream -- it's a nightmare
Mm-mm
Mm-mm
massive hand slaps down over her mouth
Her crusted eyes peer above the hairy knuckles
He sucks on the cigarette red cherry blazes at the end
The man pushes the blanket off of her and grips her panties
Rae's eyes close
She knows what is next
In his clenched fist, the panties are ripped off
Rae flinches awake from the fever-induced nightmare and falls to the wooden floor, drenched in sweat
Weakened and shaking, she scampers away, finally collapsing in the kitchen
Her hand reaches out and lands on the strings of Laz's guitar on the floor
She grips the steel strings with her trembling fingers
single bass note twangs as she passes out
: - Angela stands between the aisles, motioning Laz to approach, away from the girl at the counter
Is your niece older than 12
Oh, she older than that
She hands him a white box with cough syrup inside
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia
just copied her prescription
You don't need to pay anything
just take it
But if she gets worse, you give me a call wrote my number on the box
This gonna get you in trouble
Not if no one finds out
Laz doesn't know what to say
He puts the box in his pocket
Thank you
(suddenly awkward) Oh
My wife
She had a card here for her migraine pills
She ain't gonna be around no more
So if you
already tossed that out
(takes a step closer) Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago
how she treated you
Of course, that's none of my business
(smiles) Don't make it less true
Angela returns the smile
- Laz opens his truck door and stops
At the pool-hall across the square, Laz sees a green Cutlass with chrome rims
: - Laz enters the empty pool hall
Tehronne is playing a game with a skinny playa-wanna-be dressed in flea-market Fubu
, the owner, approaches Laz from the bar
Hey, Lazarus
We closed up on Sunday
Need a word with Tehronne
(calling to the back) Yo,
Laz wanna holla at cha
Come on back, Cuz
Charlie nods Laz on
He crosses to the back pool table as Tehronne sinks the 8
Tehronne looks at his friend
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time
think you call it a damn shame
Word wit'cha
In private
Tehronne hands his friend the pool cue
The two take a few steps away to talk
You need some weed
Been years since  fooled with that
(tries to find the words) You know a white girl
Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like
(smiles) That ain't up to me to hook you up
Naw what  mean
She her own, you know
Huh
don't pimp that
(silence) You talkin' about who  think you talkin' about, you mean Rae
Rae Doole
Sexy little split tail, like you say
can't hook you up with that
got two girls
One ain't in town, the other one pregnant
So
you on your own
This Rae

Shit
Who hasn't
Why you say that
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone
but me, 'm different
Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up
Girl got an itch
You know
what's a nigga to do
She like it rough
You like beatin' on her
That ain't my scene
If that's somethin' you into
Now, hold up
See, that girl is in my favor
You heard me, nigga
You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit
You collar that dog, boy
ain't gonna hurt nobody
Just wanted to know who she was
Like  say, you wanna hook that up
ain't in ya way
That switch of hers been all over this town
Got that sickness, you know
What'chu sayin'
She a freak
Got what you call a sexual addiction
Lazarus looks at him with a furrowed brow
Confused
What'chu sayin'
What 'm tellin' you
Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy
: '  - Laz opens his own door with caution
He turns to see Rae sprawled in his kitchen in her panties and -shirt
He rushes to her side
Gal
Miss Rae
Rae, you hear me
Lazarus lifts her sweaty body off the floor and moves her back to the couch
Consciousness briefly returns to Rae in her feverish haze
: - The white-knuckled hand clutched around her mouth
: '  - Rae flinches and flails
She falls to the floor
Hold on, now
Hold on
Rae's eyes are open and filled with fear
She struggles to flee as Laz holds her in place, trying to reassure her
Now,  ain't gonna hurt'cha
Calm down, Miss
(she fights, coughs) Listen
Listen
,
(Rae settles in his grip) ain't gonna hurt ya, hear
Gotta get you well
Now, look me
Look me in the eye
Rae is too weak to talk or move
Laz clutches her small face in his dark hands
Open your eyes
Go'on, now
You need to see, ain't no harm here
Ain't no harm
(Rae calms) My name is Lazarus Woods
And  ain't gonna let you die
Rae's eyes roll back
Lazarus looks terrified as she cranes her head back and forward
Her mouth opens
In her sickened state, with the force of something evil and deep inside, Rae clasps her open mouth over Laz's
shriek sounds in his brain as he holds her tighter, allowing the kiss to grow in intensity
Rae falls to her stomach as Laz abruptly stands and stumbles across the room
What he sees chills him to the bone
Rae is writhing on the floor as if she is possessed -- a rant of raspy words pour from her mouth
you don't
touch me
s'no
Mm-mm
Mm-
- 'you
Lazarus gets spooked by what he is seeing
He looks to the mantle
His weathered Bible lies in a coat of dust
He picks it up as a wave of the burning hits Rae
She clutches her breast and crotch, rolling from side to side
Mm-mm
mm-mm
Ma-muh
Ma-
(sudden anger, shouting) See
See if'
'
: '  -  - Rose is shouting at the customers in the cafe
Her eyes are white like Rae's
Her voice is not her own but that of Rae
/ (screaming) '
: '  - Laz runs out of his own home, not even shutting the door behind him
He gets half way down his drive, the Bible still clutched in his hand
He stops
In a panic, Laz opens his Bible, places it down on the drive, face up, creating a barrier to evil
He hears a choking cough inside the house
Rae is fighting for breath beyond the dark door
Silence
Laz reaches down and picks up his Bible
passage catches his eye
As he reads, the fear vanishes from his face
His back straightens
His jaw tightens
He looks back at his house, his faith is renewed
: '  -   - The Bible is slammed down on top of the toilet tank
The bathtub faucet coughs as Laz twists the cold water knob
'  -  - The freezer door opens
He snatches four trays of ice
'  -   - The trays crack
The ice cubes bounce into the tub
'  - Rae's lips are dried and split as she pants, lost in dizzying fever
Laz lifts her
'  -   - Laz kneels on one knee to put her into the tub
horrible cry from Rae as Laz wrestles with her, keeping her submerged in the ice cold water
know, child,  know
Gotta break that fever now
(Rae sobs, struggles) Don't mean to hurt'chu
But  ain't lettin' you die
(holding her down) ' '
Rae is motionless
Exhausted
Her eyes are open but blind
Her lip trembles
Her body shakes from the freezing water
Laz rubs the hair from her face gently
He reaches over to the Bible on the toilet and opens it to read
Put fear of the Devil in me, gal
Got me spooked like 's a kid, tell you
(flips through the pages) But the good Lord, He showed me what to do
He come knockin' like my man say
listen here
(Rae sobs like a child) This here Matthew
He talkin' on how Jesus was healin' the sick
And a man come up to the disciples and he say
(reads deliberately) Have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic, and sore vexed
(to Rae) He got the devil in his mind and sores on his skin
(reads) And he brought the boy to the disciples, but they could  cure him
Rae's shivering is abating
Her eyes fight to stay open
Laz touches her forehead to test her temperature
(reading) Then Jesus answered and said, faithless and perverse generation
how long shall  suffer you
Bring the boy hither to me
And Jesus rebuked the devil
(to Rae) You hear that
(reads) Then the disciples say
Why could not we cast the devil out
And Jesus said unto them
Rae's eyes begin to close
Laz gently touches her head to rile her awake
Listen now
This what he sayin' to us
He say
(reads) If ye have faith
if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto a mountain, remove hence
and it
shall
move
And nothin'
nothin' shall be impossible to you
(to Rae) You hear that
You just need a bit of faith
You just gotta believe you gonna get well, like  do
He touches her forehead again
Her eyes close
That's better
You coolin' down
Okay
You rest
Okay
You rest
Laz leans against the wall, spent
'  - The cicadas sing in a rising chorus as the clouds above fade from copper to crimson
'  - The faint echo of Rae's fevered panting
She lies on the couch wrapped in a quilt, shivering
Her eyes remain closed, her face drenched with sweat
Laz has cleaned her facial wounds, using a few Band-Aids
An explosion ignites the windows surrounding the cabin
Rae jolts awake, terror pervades her as she gasps at the fire ball outside the window
She struggles to her feet and listens
faint sound can be heard through the roar of the flames
beep beep
beep beep
beep beep
beep beep
(a whisper) Ronnie
Rae stumbles to the door, weak and dizzy
She grips the door knob and pulls the door open
'  - Rae races outside, tripping down the front porch steps
She looks off at the blaze in the squash field
She frantically races toward the fire, the beeping increases
Ronnie
At the center of the blaze is an upside down Humvee
To the left of the vehicle, a few soldier's bodies lay scattered
Rae's legs lose all strength, she collapses and crawls across the squash plants
far away voice is heard over the roaring flames
Gal
Gal
Rae crawls across a fallen soldier, following the sound of Ronnie's alarm
She struggles to breathe, she almost faints
She finds a soldier face down
With all her strength she turns him over
It is Ronnie, wide-eyed and lifeless
An awful groan comes out of Rae -- crippling sorrow
She pulls on his vest trying to wake him
(sobbing) Nn-nn
Nn-nn
no
'
'
Rae looks up
The flaming humvee is gone
She is not pulling on Ronnie's vest, but the tangled vines of a squash plant
Laz stands at a safe distance, silhouetted in moonlight
You travelin' right now, gal
You asleep and you don't even know it
(extends his hand) Now
come on inside with me
Rae looks like a terrified child
Her eyes well with tears as she shakes her head
Laz takes a step toward her
Mm-mm
Mm-mm
Come on, gal
She turns and runs away as best she can
Laz chases after her
He's much older than her and a bit slower, but her balance betrays her
Laz wraps his arms around her
Rae screams to the sky
And then, stillness
Rae lies limp in Laz's arms, unconscious
He reaches down and lifts her wrist to his face
The green screen of the digital watch pulsates with the alarm
He pushes the side button
The beeping stops
Silence
: '  -  - Laz lays Rae back onto his couch
Her eyes open into slits
She can see Laz's form over her like the man in her nightmare
Rae grabs Laz's wrist
He flinches with her force
(the whisper of a child) Is'okay
Is'okay
Struggling with exhaustion, Rae moves Laz's hand to her bare stomach
She rubs it slowly up and down her form, suggestively
Laz slips his hand away and claps it tight over her eyes
Rae holds her breath, waiting to be molested, her lip quivering
(singing deep and soft) Goin' over that hill
Goin' over that hill
Well,  ain't gonna stop until  reach my God's top
'm goin' over the hill
Well  went to the valley,  didn't go to stay
Soul got happy,  stayed all day
'm goin' over that hill
Rae relaxes and falls into a deep sleep
Laz backs away from her, a touch of fear in his heart
The voice of Tehronne is heard from earlier in the day
(
) She a freak
Got what you call a sexual addiction
(
) What'chu sayin'
(
) What 'm tellin' you
Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy
: -    - Lazarus looks at Tehronne with a furrowed brow, confused
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16
Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers
You know coach Reynolds
Uh-huh
He tapped that
Naw
Go ask him
: '  - Lazarus opens his barn, slicing through the darkness with his flashlight
(
) She been bumpin' around all her life, hookin' up with whoever keep her fed and fucked
He crosses to the other side, pulls on a beaded chain turning on the single bulb above his work table
(
) seen her give it up on park benches, back of trucks, hoopty hoods, you name it
Laz opens an old wooden box on his work table
He looks inside
: -  - Laz looks ill
Tehronne checks his pager briefly
You ever seen a train run on a woman
Nuh-uh
Meanin' like a team of fellas go to work on her and she don't even break a sweat
(puts his pager away) She into football, you know
You got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in ya lap
ain't playin'
Tehronne's friend breaks on the pool table with a sharp crack
Lazarus is genuinely disturbed
How a girl get like that
Like  told you
: '  - Lazarus reaches inside the box and pulls out the end of an old chain
(
) Girl got a sickness
The chain rattles as Laz walks backwards, pulling the long chain from the box
The shouting of his brother can be heard
(
) What'chu gonna do
Huh
Nothin' '   '
'
The end of the chain snags, yanking the box over
: '  -    - Lazarus is bent over, harvesting his tomatoes
(singing to himself) Tell me who's that writin'
John the Revelator
Wrote the book of the seven seals
: '  - Laz enters his home
He crosses to the kitchen and pours himself a glass of water
Dripping with sweat, he steps back into the room, downing the last of his water
He lowers the glass, noticing Rae looking at him
Hey
Rae lifts her head off the pillow
Laz comes to her side and helps her sit up
Take it easy now
Don't rush it
(a scratchy whisper) How long
how long  been out
You been in and out goin' on two
maybe two days
(can't believe it) Two days
After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells
long enough to get that medicine in ya
Rae sits up on the couch, the quilt wrapped around her waist
She looks at the cough syrup bottle on the side table
Found you on the side of the road
Someone took to beatin' on you pretty bad
You know who done that to you
Rae touches the cut over her eye
That evening is still a blur
Where's Ronnie
Well  don't
(remembering) Wait
He left
Rae lifts her head, revealing tears in her eyes
She gets mad at herself and wipes them away
don't got any money
for fixin' me up and all
Don't need none
Then  better be on my way
Don't wanna put you out no more
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk
Naw'sir
gotta be on my way
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to
Rae struggles for balance as she attempts to stand
The quilt falls away as a heavy chain slides off the couch and thuds on the floor by her feet
Rae feels a tug
She looks down to see a dark chain locked around her thin waist and coiled on the floor
The opposite end is locked around the side coil of the radiator
She is chained to the house, a prisoner
Let me say somethin' first
Why you got me chained
Way  see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right
The fuck you been doin' to me
ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever
Remember like say,  found you in the road
(yanks at the chain around her waist) Get this Goddamn thing off me
Rae stumbles as she moves away from Laz
Laz tries to reassure her
Now, no harm's come to you
and aim to keep it that way
Ain't gonna
gonna run a train over ya
or however you call it
see
you was runnin' wild on me
these fever dreams you was havin'
these fits
'd be chasin' you all night
Well 'm woke now
you can take this off
Rae waits
Gal, you ain't right yet
'm right enough to stand on my own two feet
Now take this Goddamn chain off
How you let men treat ya like they do
What
These men you up under
How you let them do ya like that
(grips the chain) Do me
Do me like this, you mean
Like chainin' me up
You know what 'm talkin' about
(beat) All that mess with ya teachers and
boys in the backs of trucks
(shocked) The hell you know about me
You got no right to talk to me about that shit
The hell you think you are
(interrupting) 've saved ya life, gal
can do and say whatever the fuck  want
Rae begins to feel a pang of panic
She goes to the chain locked around the radiator
She yanks on it a few times
give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house
Get you to the kitchen
You need the bathroom, it'll reach
What do you want
We got everything we need
Plenty of food
Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it
(Laz can't answer) , God saw to it to put you in my path
And  aim to cure ya of your wickedness
This statement terrifies Rae
The fear can be seen in her eyes
She backs away -- the chain scrapes across the floor
You some kind'a pervert
No ma'am
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me
In my house, you watch that lip
(furious, near tears) Look it, mister
you wanna have your way, you take it
'll do whatever you want
But you gotta let me go
You can't do this
You can't You sick
You got a sickness
we broke that fever
we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya
Rae pushes Laz back and bolts for the door
Laz falls back against the side table by the couch, toppling the lamp
'  /
'  - The door slams against the house as Rae rushes out in her wolf shirt and panties -- the chain trailing behind her
(screaming) Laz watches as the coil unravels and snaps taut, yanking on the old radiator
Clank
The chain whips Rae down to the ground
Laz watches as dust flies of the radiator with each tug
The fear in Laz's face is replaced with a grin as he watches his radiator hold firm
Outside, Rae bucks and screams, yanking on the chain like a wild mustang
Her bare feet and legs are soiled with fresh mud and grass as she claws at the ground
Laz crosses to the radiator and pats it like a proud parent -- his wedding ring clicks against the iron
(to the radiator) Ain't gonna be moved
He steps outside with resolve and strength
He picks up the chain and wraps it around his fist
ain't gonna be moved on this
Laz yanks her back, dragging her towards him
He grips the taut chain with his other hand and yanks her closer
You can holla y'self hoarse
Ain't gonna bend my will
(pulls her closer) Right or wrong, you gonna mind me
(Pulls her again) Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the  and the Rae is spent
She turns to look at her captor as he wrangles her back to the porch
Now you get up
And you get in my house
Or what
Rae spits at Laz
Bad idea
: '  - Rae is screaming and grunting as Laz, standing in his kitchen, tugs on the chain around the door-jam like he's drawing water from a well
Outside Rae struggles to hold onto the porch post
Laz pulls hard, lifting her lower torso off the ground
Stop it
Stop it
Whose doin' is that
Laz yanks
Rae loses her grip and slams onto the porch
Okay
' ' The pulling stops
Rae picks herself up
Her knees and hands are scraped and bleeding
The two stare at each other
Say we talk
Just take a seat on the sofa
'll get us somethin' cool to drink
Laz crosses to the kitchen
Rae sits down on the couch, noticing the fallen lamp on the floor
You may not remember
But you spent a whole half day in my tub, tryin' to cool down
Melted four ice trays
He finishes preparing the two waters
He crosses into the front room
Rae is not there
Rae smashes the lamp on Laz's head
The water glasses shatter as Laz falls to the floor
Rae picks up a wooden chair and breaks it over his back
Before she can do any more damage, Laz grabs her by the wrists and throws her to the couch
Rae falls to the floor
Laz stumbles on his feet as he clutches his bleeding head
He loses his cool
Wicked little bitch
gonna cut me
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this
Rae freezes as she sees Laz undo his belt buckle
Her breath starts to quiver as she deeply inhales and exhales
Think 'm gonna let you do me like that
Laz whips his belt off and wraps the buckle around his fist
He stops in his tracks
Rae is panting and shaking
Her middle finger is scratching at her own thigh
(regaining his cool) Okay, now
ain't gonna hit'cha
(the burning is starting) Just lost my cool there
(he throws the belt away) Now take that look out'cha eye
Her anguished hum can be heard through her clenched teeth as she rocks back and forth
Her hands wander down to her inner thighs
No, ma'am
You stop that foolishness
(shaking her head) Hm-mm
Hm-mm
said
(on the verge of crying) '
Rae gets dizzy
She rests the top of her head on the floor and sways back and forth
Laz rushes out the front door
As the wave hits, Rae twists and turns, wrapping the chain around her
She grips the radiator with both hands and rests her face against the side
Hmmmmmm
Stop-it
-
The wave is about to build in to a powerful climax
Rae gasps for breath
The door slams open
Laz drenches her with a gallon of cold well water from a tin bucket
Rae inhales and freezes
Laz waits and watches
The burning is gone
Laz kneels next to her and gently frees her bare ankle from the tangled chain
You hungry
: '  -    - They are both seated on the front porch with paper plates in their laps
Laz watches with amusement as Rae tears into her chicken and gobbles up the vegetables
put some back ache into growin' them greens
You should slow down and see how they taste
Rae remains under Lazarus' intense gaze as the cicadas sing
: '  -    - Rae stares off at orange clouds and purple sky
She takes a step to her left, walking through the parallel rows of squash
The chain gently rattles behind her
Laz has given her about 20 feet of slack
He holds the chain tight around his fist
Rae grins, standing proud in her wolf shirt and panties
You like this
Walkin' me through this field like 's your mule
Can't sit all day on that sofa
Need to get your legs strong
(sassy) If  break one you gonna shoot me
Rae teases Laz by adjusting her panties
She turns back to the sunset and stretches
: '  - Rae's smoldering eyes don't leave Laz as he chains her to the radiator
Laz nervously preaches, trying to avoid the sight of her bare legs curled up on his couch
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts
That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop
Know why it's best to rotate em like that
Uh-uh
Laz moves in close and starts applying antibacterial cream to the cut above Rae's eye
Cuz once in a while soil need a change
Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer
So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans
That give off a lot of nitrate
Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong
(regarding the eye) Sting a bit
Itches
Means ya healin'
(a nod) So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew
Matthew 13
The parable of the sower
Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns
you know the story
Uh-uh
Laz starts putting the cream on her scabbed knees
He rubs them gently
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God
and understand the word of God
Not enough for you to hear what 'm sayin', you gotta understand
know
get it
What's Matthew doin'
Gal
Matthew ain't doin' shit
this just a story
(quelling his frustration) Look it
've seen it in nature, 've seen it in men
Ya got to change up your crop
Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in
(Rae remains silent) Ya gotta cut this shit out
Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch
Like you somebody's dog
No woman
who joins in union with Almighty God
or man
in the sanctity of marriage
should degrade herself
and bend to  '
Rae is aware that Laz is somewhere else, talking to someone else other than her
There is anger in his tone as he rubs ointment on her bare, scabbed knees
(shouting) My God, gal, don't you got no
ain't sayin'  ain't weak
Shit
Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life
a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you
(grips her by the legs) ' '
,
Let go of me
'
Rae yanks free of Laz's grip, recoiling on the couch
Laz awakens from his rant
He blinks and stands
sudden shame overtakes him
He crosses into the kitchen to hide by the sink
He pours Rae a glass of water and returns to her side
(offering her the glass) Didn't mean to go off on a tear like did
just got to thinkin' about things
Rae leans up into his face
The glass of water is touching her chest
Laz remains hypnotized by her eyes
Why is it you old men gotta talk so much
Like little boys, gotta talk yourself into fuckin' me
(his knuckles touch her skin) We can take our time
'm grown get it
(she leans even closer) You wanna give me 'nother bath
Laz stands and backs away
He quickly leaves the room
'  -   - Laz looks at himself in the reflection of Rose's vanity mirror, listening to Rae stir in the next room
'  - The cicadas are screaming outside
Rae is beginning to breathe deep, the burning is coming on
(under her breath) Goddammit
She folds her arms over her chest, her middle finger scratching her elbow
The anxiety is too much
She rolls over until the chain pulls taut against the radiator
Rae has wrapped herself in a tangle of chain
Her breathing relaxes
Her eyes close
She sleeps
- train rumbles past in the blue hue of dawn
Laz pulls his truck next to two other fruit and vegetable vendors:  and
Archie is an old black man in his early seventies
Gene is a short white man closer to Laz's age
There goes our fortune
We been doin' good for ourselves since you been away
Laz sets up his folding table and uncovers his produce
'all know when Ella Mae's open up
You needin' to buy some pantyhose
Just some dresses
Gene looks at Archie and shrugs
: '  - Rae snaps awake
She is wet with sweat from the morning heat
Hello
Hey
Rae drags the chain behind her as she crosses to the front door and looks outside
No truck
don't believe this shit
She folds her arms and looks into the kitchen
There on the table is a covered plate and a small bottle of milk
Rae reads a note on top of the plate:
She pulls off the top plate and finds sausage links, eggs, biscuits, sliced tomatoes, and sliced peaches
Enough to choke a Goddamn horse
She yanks her chain
It rattles across the floor as she sits
: ' '  - Laz looks out of place in his faded overalls surrounded by bright colors of Ella Mae's dress shop
is a wide woman with white hair in her late fifties
'm needin' some women's clothes few dresses
Maybe some shoes
But they gotta be nice
They gotta be proper
Clothes a woman would want, where she could feel and look like a woman without
you know, lookin' like a tramp or a hussy or somethin'
Ella Mae turns to her assistant, Rhonda
Rhonda is a 19-year- old black girl
She turns back to Laz, unsure how to proceed
And, sir
do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for
(points to Rhonda) That young lady's size, right'cher
Well, that makes it easier
: '  -   - Rae sits down in the tub, still wearing her -shirt and panties
Looking up at the shower head above she turns on the cold water and yanks up on the shower knob
Cold water sprays down over her
She gasps and then relaxes, laying back in the tub
: ' '  - Laz is at the counter
Rhonda is putting the shoes and clothes in two shopping bags while Ella Mae rings him up
Well
hope these will work for your niece
She can always come back in and swap sizes
Lazarus points to a small display of fine lotions
Mind  ask, what's all this business here
These are whipped body creams
It's like a lotion
For your hands
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume
So now they have scented creams
They help moisturize a woman's skin
(unscrewing a jar) This one's my favorite
It's called Ginger Souffle
recommend
applying the cream while the skin is still damp
So
perhaps just after a shower
(likes what he smells) 'll take a jar of that, too
: '  -  - Rae rattles into the kitchen, her damp clothes clinging to her form
She picks up Laz's guitar off the table and places it in her lap
She plucks a few random strings out of boredom and smiles
: - The same apathetic girl is working the front counter as Laz enters the drug store with a basket of arranged vegetables
Lookin' for Miss Angela
She in the back
Laz makes his way to the back of the store
He spies Angela in the back pharmacy, sorting pills for a pick-up
He watches her work for a moment until, finally, she sees him
Wait right there
Laz waits as Angela rounds the corner
brung you a little basket of goodies
Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans
(taking the basket) You didn't have to do this
Just wanted to say how much appreciate you helping me the other day
My niece, she's cured up, and got you to thank
Well that's good
'm happy to hear it
Angela smiles
There is tension and attraction between the two
Look here
got somethin' special for you
Angela is flush as Laz moves closer than he has ever been before
He reaches in the basket for the jar of cream
This here is a whipped
body cream
And it's got a smell to it
Tell me what you think
Laz holds the jar up to her nose
Angela closes her eyes and smells
Her expression says enough -- she loves it
They call this Ginger Souffle
Best if it
if it go on your skin just after you been in a hot tub
or shower
Angela takes the lotion from his hand
She is subtle and demure, but the woman is deeply affected
She smiles
This was very sweet of you
Well
Hope you enjoy it
Angela watches Laz as he walks out the door
The apathetic girl moves up behind Angela
Oooooo
Hush up
-   - Laz opens his truck and waves goodbye to Old Red
Melvin is holding a healthy squash
You gonna be on the square later on
Got all my honey-do's done with
'm headin' home
Stay cool
It's a hot one
Laz pulls away in his truck and rounds the corner just as crosses the street
He steps over to talk to Red
Hey, Red
Was that Laz just left
Yes'sir, Rev'rend
: '  -  - Rae occasionally strums an awful chord as she sings playfully
(trying to sing) You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear how much  love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
voice from outside spins her around
The guitar barks as Rae slams it down on the table
(
) Mister Lazarus
Rae stays hidden as she peeks out the front window
Lincoln is standing before the house holding an old picnic basket
Rae's middle finger begins scraping against the wall
Mister Laz
come for the butter beans
Rae fights her dizziness
She crawls to the radiator as she hears each creak of Lincoln crossing to the front door
The Zippo with the bald eagle closes
smoldering cigarette
: Rae flinches and grits her teeth as Lincoln knocks on the door: Knock, knock
Ain't seen you on the square
Mister Laz, can you hear me
The burning has started: deep gasps, itching, anxiety
(worried now) Mister Lazarus
Rae watches the shadows of Lincoln's shoes under the door
They wait patiently and walk away
'  - Lincoln walks down the porch steps and stops
Thinks
'  - Rae inches upward, pulling herself up the radiator so she can stand
Her panting has waned
Suddenly the front door swings open
Mister Laz, 'm comin' inside
Lincoln can't believe what he sees
Rae is chained around the waist, damp and barely clothed
Her eyes bore into Lincoln like an owl zeroing in on a helpless jackrabbit
She rips her shirt off in one tug over her head
Lincoln can't move
The picnic basket hits the floor
His mouth hangs open in shock as Rae steps towards him and lays her open mouth on the boy
'  - Rae shuts the door
Laz steers his Ford truck up the drive and parks
He takes his time getting out and removing the shopping bags
He opens the door and goes inside
His curses can be heard from outside
Lincoln is tossed off the porch, clinging to his overalls
'
Tears and fear come to Lincoln as Laz steps out onto the porch, fuming with rage
Lincoln backs away expecting a good beating
He starts running up the drive but stops as
's Olds rolls up the drive
Lincoln, come on back
Lincoln darts past Laz and runs into the barn, clutching his overalls
stops the car halfway down the drive and steps out
Was that Lincoln James  seen run off
He's fine
Just had a bad fall
Why's his britches round his knees
, you gonna have to get on can't have nobody round my place
starts walking up the drive
You get a call from Rose
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman
Just don't want nobody around me now
Somethin' wrong with ya phone
Been callin' the last few days
stops in his tracks as Lazarus pulls out his hunting rifle from the rack behind his seat in his truck
Goin' dove huntin'
You gotta go,
ain't foolin' this time
You sayin' that gun's for me if don't
( ' ) Spell it out, Laz
Man big enough to pull a gun best have a tongue in his mouth if he ain't got a brain in his head
Laz is struggling
The rifle feels suddenly strange to him
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more
got my mind made up and ain't gonna be moved on this
(amused) Ain't gonna be moved
Got no place for preachin' here
Not now
So you do as  say
(still stepping closer) Or what
told you to
pushes his chest up against the rifle and shouts back
'   ,
Laz's heart is breaking
He is pointing a gun at his only friend
snatches the rifle out of Laz's hands
Ought'a stomp yo ass pointing this at me
(unloads the rifle) Always gotta bring up the preachin'
Like you just a sheep in my flock and all 'm good for is poundin' on a pulpit
(gets in Laz's face) Dammit, Laz
we may not be blood
But we sucked off the same old nurse since the day we was slapped on the ass
And you gonna point a gun at me
tear rolls down Laz's cheek
The shame is unbearable
If you in some trouble, than  gonna figure somethin' out
You and me
(hands him a bandana) Wipe your face
Laz takes the bandana and wipes the tears away
Now
this got anything to do with Rose
(Laz shakes his head) Then what
: '  - The door creaks open
carefully steps inside
Rae is sitting on the couch, looking out the window
(on the verge of tears) didn't want to
Rae doesn't respond
quickly steps outside shutting the door behind him
'  - shakes his head as Laz follows him off the porch
Are you outta ya
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done
naked woman, chained in ya house
'm tellin' you the truth, dammit found her beat
Left for dead
So brung her home
Laz,  know about that girl
(beat) Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know
(shakes his head) Oh, Laz
She's had a mess of crabs and them 's
What'chu thinking
haven't laid a hand
On my life, , my wick is dry on this
You say she was beat on
You call the sheriff on that
Put yo'self in my shoes
Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby
What's that chain around her for
Laz briefly looks off at the barn, knowing Lincoln is there
Why don't you go'on and ask her
She need to talk wit somebody with sense
Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days
And this is how 'm handling it
Silence
Go in and talk to her
Please
nods
Lazarus smiles
Good
Makin' steaks for supper expect you to come
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator
You treat folks special when they company
It's just supper,
, shit
One thing at a time, Laz
Laz walks toward the barn and turns back to
Watch y'self in there
That girl'll jump on ya junk like a grasshopper
'  - Laz opens the door to his barn wide, allowing the afternoon light to find Lincoln sitting on an old tire, weeping
Did  hurt'chu
Lincoln shakes his head
Laz carefully sits next to him
What happened in there
that won't your fault
Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is
Why she got a chain on her
That's between her and me
It's private
And  don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy
(in a panic) Please don't tell my daddy
My mouth is shut, boy
And that's how we gonna keep it
Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me
Lincoln nods
Laz hands him the bandana
gave him
So
(a bonding smile) That your first time
Yes'sir
You struck some gold, didn't ya
Lincoln grins as he wipes the snot from his nose
Shit
My first time was with my second cousin behind my uncle's barn
She weighed two tons, if a pound
Could'a done a lot better for myself
You sho'nuf did
'  - hands Rae a glass of water
She is seated on the sofa, wrapped in a quilt
Thank you
(sits next to her) gotta ask you
Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this
(shrugs at first, then:) You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them
Guess he just don't think it's safe for me
So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is
(
yanks on the chain) You think he's crazy for thinkin' that
Rae struggles to answer
Something is on her mind
You a preacher
That's right
Can  ask you a question
(
nods) People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell
That you say sorry for all you done and
and Jesus would let you go on to heaven
You could put it that way
But that's so fuckin' stupid
(she catches herself) 'm sorry
Didn't mean to curse
What's on your mind
You can't hurt people
and then just say, 'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away
Why would heaven want people like that
People who
do what they want and then
switch
'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me
(Rae anxiously nods) think folks carry on about heaven too much
Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds
And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates
can go to Shoney's for that
Rae grins
leans closer
There's sin in my heart
There's evil in this world
But when  got no one
talk to God
ask for strength
ask for forgiveness
Not for peace at the end of my days when there's no more life to live and no more good to do, but today
Right now
Rae has never had anyone talk to her like this
She is listening
She is understanding
What's your heaven
What gives you peace
Rae looks at her bare feet
She tries to respond but the pain in her chokes back the words
Tears come to her
(struggling to speak) Ronnie
: - bus stops at the station
The doors swing open
few passengers exit the bus followed by Ronnie
He is not wearing his uniform
-   - He drops his duffle bag and pops a few quarters in the phone
He waits, allows the phone to ring
(into the phone) This is Ronnie again
Don't know if you been gettin' my messages but
'm down at the bus station and
(struggles) just need you come get me
You get this message, 'm on the interstate headin' downtown toward the square
(sadness hits) Rae
really need you to
come find me
Please
Ronnie hangs up the phone
He remains motionless, fearful and alone
He picks up his duffle and walks down the interstate
: '  - Lincoln stands over the barbecue spraying lighter fluid over the coals while
peels back the corn husks
We gonna eat with her
That's what  was told
She still gonna have that chain on
Well
'm working on that
(trying to change the subject) So
what's goin' on in your life, Lincoln
ain't no virgin no more
Lincoln tosses a match on the coals
They ignite with flame
'  -  - Laz is humming to himself as he finishes chopping up the potatoes
He wipes his hands and catches Rae standing behind him
She looks classic in the floral sundress
She folds her arms, feeling awkward under Laz's approving gaze
Now that's sharp
That is sharp
Chain give you any trouble
Uh-uh
Good
Now  got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven
and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn
What do you know how to make
don't fuckin' cook
(a look of disappointment) Gal,  been around hard-cursin' folk all my life
And let me tell you
Look it
put the Goddamn dress on, didn't
think 'm handlin' myself with some
fuckin' restraint here
how you got me locked up like a dog on a
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth
people just gonna tune ya out
(interrupting her) Rae
'm not fightin' with ya
just know you got more in you than junk
(a breath) Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all
(Rae shrugs) You know how to boil water
can handle that
(hands Rae a pot) Well, get to it
: '  -  -    - The four of them (Rae, Laz, Lincoln, and
) are all seated at the kitchen table, holding hands as
says grace
Rae peeks at the others with their eyes closed tight
She follows their example
We ask that you bless this meal put before us
May the food nourish our bodies and this fellowship nourish our spirit
In Jesus name we pray
Amen
& Amen
There is a sudden flurry of activity at the table as the four begin piling up their plates
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln
'all let me know if these steaks are too dry
This all looks wonderful
skipped lunch
Well, dig in, son
Got plenty to eat
Rae's eyes are fixed on
as he picks up a devilled egg
She looks over at Laz who is aware of her anxiety
He gives her a wink
bites into the egg and moans with delight
(to Laz) Mm
Now these eggs got some kick to it
What'chu got in this
(motions to Rae) Ask the chef
Everyone looks at Rae, surprised
She feels a sudden rush of fear as she struggles to answer
's question
Cayenne pepper
: - Ronnie is walking by the bar along the interstate
He stops when he sees Gill's truck
- Ronnie adjusts his duffle bag over his shoulder as he enters the mid-sized bar
Gill is seated at the bar
He turns to Ronnie along with a few other locals, one being , age 40
(surprised) Holy shit
(understanding) Yeah
Sit down, man
Need a beer
Sure
(to the bartender) Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here
Ronnie sits next to Gill
Herman leans in wanting to be a part of the conversation
Hey, Herman
They buy you that big chicken dinner
Ronnie stiffens
Gill is confused
What
They got little names for everything in the corps when they trying to get rid of ya
Don't know what it's like in the guard
There's what you call a bad conduct discharge, a
we all called it the big chicken dinner
It ain't the brig but it'll fuck ya for life if you wantin' to work for the government
That's not what this is about
They got another little name called ad-sep
That sound about right
Ronnie looks away
He takes a sip of his beer
Ad-sep
Administrative separation
(to Ronnie) How do you get one of those
Blowin' boys in the head, for one
Ronnie loses his cool
He lunges at Herman
Gill holds him back
Whoa, son
ain't sayin' shit about you
'm just talkin'
Well, you don't know what you're talking about so why don't you shut the fuck up
Hey, it's alright, man
It's alright
(to Herman) Herman
Come on
He just got back
Herman gets up to leave with his beer
To get back ya had to've gone somewhere
Ronnie glares at Herman as he moves to the other side of the bar
Gill moves closer to Ronnie to get the whole story
What happened
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach
Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school
Thought it was just some tic  got, or ulcers like my daddy had
(takes a drink) can't
shoot
Target practice 'm a pro
tag between the numbers each time but
(feels a stomach cramp) But when there's really loud noises around me
somethin' happens get shaky and
lose my breath
They called it anxiety
Severe anxiety
It can be fixed and all
just not in time for
(another drink) It's a long process but
they sent me home
guess it could be worse
You could be comin' back in a body bag
Gill doesn't know what to say next
can't get Rae on the phone
She's not at home
none of her friends seen her anywhere
She's around
Always is
don't know
She's gettin' crazy, like she gets
Begged me not to go
Got real down
just think somethin's happened
Like she run off with someone
You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right
You been home yet
Uh-uh
's hitchin' up the interstate when  seen your truck outside
You need a ride
: '  - Gill's truck rounds the bend and up the gravel drive leading up to Ronnie's trailer
The headlights scan across the porch as Gill parks
'  - Ronnie is the first through the door, calling out for Rae before he can turn on the lights
Rae
Gill enters
He sees that the trailer is the same as it was the day he picked up Ronnie, nothing is different
This don't feel right
Kitchen looks just like  left it
know, cuz cleaned it
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off
just been so mixed up lately, Gill
And, you know, with her history, can see how she could get scared
(tears) and run
Gill is disturbed by Ronnie's sudden flood of emotion and tears
He crosses to the pantry, already knowing which cupboard to pull the liquor out of
He pours two drinks
He hands one to Ronnie
Drink
Come on, drink some
Ronnie manages a few swallows
Her momma works down at the grocery, down on the square
Maybe she seen her
Gill stands over Ronnie, looking down on his pitiful face
Ronnie
You can't see cuz you're too close to it
(Ronnie waits) These nervous spells you get
You never had that shit back in school
That's not right, really, cuz
(continuing) You joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself
Army'd pay for school
You were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself
His words are painful to Ronnie
Gill doesn't hold back
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut
Now wait
(continuing) With all she was doin'
With all the shit she kept doing
You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go
know about how she was like
But we was different
's the only person she talked to about it
How she's abused
Terrible things, Gill, just terrible
Rage suddenly fills Gill
He grabs Ronnie and throws him against the wall
It's not her fault, Gill
She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz 'd just start throwin' up
choking
Just losin' my grip
And she listened
She listened to me
(Gill releases Ronnie and walks away) And
got better
don't get nervous like  used to
And since we been together
she been faithful to me
Put all that junk behind her
The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her
(Ronnie can't believe it) Your first night away,  come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to
You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her
Like she was havin' some kind'a fit
Ronnie can't respond
Tears roll down his face
Gill holds up the whiskey bottle
(pours a drink) Don't you think it's funny how know where everything in your house is
(moves in close) don't care if that hurts you or not
Truth is  don't know who you are anymore
So fuck it
Gill turns away
Ronnie grips Gill around the neck from behind
He bends him back painfully and throws his head up against the wall
'  - The front door burst open as Gill goes flying down the front porch
Ronnie cocks a
45 and shoves it into his belt
Ronnie pins Gill's elbow behind his back and retrieves the keys from his front pocket
You gonna steal my truck
Make yourself at home
You done it already
Gill watches Ronnie tear down the drive in his own truck
: '  -    - Laz and
are smoking
Laz smiles as he watches Lincoln and Rae through the kitchen window as they wash dishes and talk about football
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz
Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble
'm dealin' with what God put before me
You believe He wants this
woman chained to ya radiator
Not like that
Then what
She's tied to me,
We tied to each other
Laz is silent
can't leave unless  get your word
Laz looks down at his shoes
He surrenders
He nods
Laz
got some news you need to hear
It's about Rose and your brother
(this is not easy for ) She's pregnant
She gonna have a baby
(silence) Her sister told my wife
You know how them sewing circles go
Just a matter of time till you got word
Thought that's why you been keepin' to yourself out here
(Laz conceals his pain) don't know how much of this is to make her happy or to hurt you
But it is what it is
Laz struggles with his emotions
He turns to
stone faced and cold
'm through with them both
: '  -    - Laz and Rae wave to Lincoln as he climbs into
's car
They pull away, up the drive, and disappear into the night
The cicadas sing as the two stand in silence: Rae, at peace, feeling genuine contentment; while Laz looks lost in silent pain
They sure liked them devilled eggs
You drink whiskey
: '  - bottle of whiskey is removed from a top cabinet above the refrigerator
Two small glasses each get a healthy swallow
You take it straight
Sure
He hands her a glass
Laz then looks at his as if he struggles with a decision
(holding up the glass) To my baby brother
Gonna be a daddy
Rae nods and downs the whiskey with Lazarus
Well, that's good news
So you're gonna be someone's uncle
Laz pours another swig for himself and downs it
Want another
We drinkin' buddies now
(pours two more glass) To freedom
Laz pounds back his third shot
Still makin' jokes
(pulls out his keys) No joke
Laz pulls Rae closer to him by the chain wrapped around her waist
He opens the old lock with a key
Not my place to change your mind, or anybody else's
People gonna do how they please
You only get one life
should be lived the way you wanna live it
The chain falls to the floor with a hollow thud
Rae looks confused
If you want
can take you back to town now
ain't in a hurry
The two stare at each other in silence
Could you do somethin' for me
Anything
: '  -  - Rae watches with intense curiosity as Laz tunes his guitar, sitting at the table
(takes another drink) Ain't played 'fore nobody in years
Laz slides his calloused fingers across the strings, spurring the old guitar into an impressive wail
Rae grips the chair
(plays as he remembers) Funny how a sound just speak to ya heart
haunting slide guitar riff barks
Rae has a physical reaction to the music
She is fascinated and fearful
(thinks) Wanted me some kids
whole mess of 'em
But Rose, my wife
chil'ren was for another time
(takes a drink) They's this one spring
saw a change in her
Her breasts start swellin' up
Come a few mornings hear her heavin' in the bathroom seen it with women before
knew
Laz thinks for a moment
Continues playing
Come a day, Rose say she had to go visit her folks in Jackson
Didn't want me to come
so  stayed put
(remembers) When she come back
(hesitates) They talk about a woman havin' that glow
Couldn't see it no more
She
took it away
Cut it out
The guitar's song turns dark
Laz slides his fingers up the guitar strings, lingering on low growns
One night
While she sleepin'
Held a pillow in my hands
could see myself killin' her
What evil in my heart make me wanna kill her, don't know
It's that voice in me
Each time  think it's gone, he come howlin' back
Devil or no,  don't know
But  am a haunted man
Fear spreads across Rae's face
Laz is talking about something all too familiar
Calls me when 'm ailing
When can't find my home, lost in the pines
calls it the Black Snake Moan
(he closes his eyes and sings) Mm-mm
Got no momma now
Mm-mm
Got no momma now
It's over late last night, don't need no momma now
Laz stops
He sways back and forth with his eyes closed
Rae hears the swell of the cicadas
Her eyes dart to the front door as the familiar creek of footsteps are heard
Sing, Lazarus
(kneels next to him in fear) Please keep singin'
The door swings open
white calloused hand appears around Rae's mouth
She gasps in terror, clutching Laz's leg
The white hand is gone
Tears come to her
She trembles as Laz sings
(singing) Mm-mm
Black snake crawlin' in my room
Mm-mm
Black snake crawlin' in my room
Some pretty momma better come and get this black snake soon
Rae rests her head against his knee
(singing) Black snake is evil, black snake is all  see
Black snake is evil, black snake is all  see
Woke up this mornin', black snake moved in on me
Laz concludes the song
Rae raises up to her knees, facing Laz
Tears have run down his dried face
He opens his eyes
My life is gone
Only life  was livin'
And  lost it
'm here with you
had love in my heart
And  gave it to one woman
And she gone now
(his lip quivers) Where am  gonna put all this love
Rae gently touches his cheek
The wind picks up outside
You can give it to me
Rae kisses Laz
He is motionless at first, allowing it to happen
His hand moves from the neck of his guitar to the bend in her neck
The passion intensifies as they squeeze the guitar between them
Laz pulls his lips away and holds her head in his hands
They are so close, they are breathing into each other's mouths
You can't start this and not finish
Not with me
(kisses him) Please
The guitar clangs to the floor as Laz lifts Rae in his arms
They kiss, ravenous for each other
He knocks up against the side table, causing his Bible to fall to the floor, face up and open
The wind pushes the front door open, slamming it hard against the wall
They turn together, kissing, Laz slowly spinning with Rae in his arms
But Laz is soon distracted by the pages of his Bible fluttering on the floor
The wind is blowing the pages, turning them with an unseen hand
Wait
gotta stop
(Rae's kisses get more aggressive) Rae stop
(she can't hear, the burning has her) Dammit, Rae
It takes a considerable effort to pull Rae away
She falls to the floor, dizzy and sucking in air
This ain't the way for me
'm sorry
Rae is struggling for breath
She desperately grabs at Laz
Not gonna lie to you, Laz
(labored breath) This one's a doozy
don't think
don't think  can stop this
Her eyes roll back briefly, almost losing consciousness
Laz catches her and holds her tightly
Tell me what to do
(Barely able to speak) The
chain helps
Laz grips the chain and wraps it around Rae
As the burning increases
Laz holds Rae tight across his lap, his back up against the radiator
seen a man die
He couldn't breathe
his heart was
was givin' out
You just havin' a fit
You ain't goin' nowhere
He told me
get help
just stood there and watched him
watched him die, Laz
Oh God
Her legs itch like they are covered in ants
The wave is hitting her hard
Laz holds her face up to him
(like a little girl) Oh, Laz
he hurt me
He
hurt me so many times
No one's gonna hurt you no more
You think God forgives people like that
(crying like a child) You think God forgives people like me
Suddenly aware of the rising burn, Rae grits her teeth
Hold me
Oh God
Rae turns away as Laz holds her head in his lap
She bites down on his middle finger as his hand moves over her mouth
She is gasping, screaming into his hand
It hits
Laz holds her
Rae's open mouth quivers as the sensation peaks
Her shoulders slump, her chest vibrates
She is crying softly
We'll just stay here
Wait till it passes
The pages of the Bible flip to the final pages in the wind
- Laz's truck pulls into his usual spot on the square
Rae is riding shotgun
Where you gonna be
Right here
Be here all afternoon
(waits) You ready for this
'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and
stuff
Rae looks out the window, a touch of fear
This town ain't goin' nowhere
You take the time you need
They both step out of the truck
Gene and Archie watch Rae's ass as she walks by
They then look back at Laz, incredulous
Friend of mine
: - Rae enters the modest grocery store holding herself tight few harmless shoppers look at her making her feel even more uncomfortable
: - Laz is selling vegetables to a young woman
He is unaware that Angela has moved up behind him, grinning, carrying a small basket
bet you have loyal customers
(turns and grins) You liked what  brung ya
Been eatin' like a princess all week
Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo
That'd be nice
put on the lotion you got me
Can you smell it
Angela steps forward and pulls away her hair from her neck
She cranes, offering her neck for Laz to smell
(smells) That's nice, too
: - Rae is looking at herself in the provided makeup counter mirror
She looks at the compact in her hand and decides against the purchase
She rounds the corner and stops
She sees Sandy on her knees in the center of the aisle, building a display of tuna cans
Rae thinks to leave, but stops
She makes a decision to talk to her
She walks up the aisle and stands above her mother
Hey
Rae kneels down next to her
She's trying to make a connection
What happened to your face
Got in a little accident
(not believing her) Yeah
Sandy stands and wipes her brow
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want
You need money again
No
That's not why
(a frustrated breath) Why we always gotta do this
mean, you and me been at each other as far back as  can remember
Wasn't no love between us
And 'm your daughter
'm the only family you got
You never needed nobody
Always made that clear to me
Yeah
know  did
But
(struggles with tears) 'm tryin' to be dif'rent
'm tryin' to
get some peace, you know
'm workin' here, Rae
Can you see that
just wanted some make-up
All that shit's on aisle 5
Rae starts walking away
She quickly turns
just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all
The hell are you talkin' about
Now see
Don't do that
'll go along with all you say about me
But that
you can't pretend no more on that
Cuz  was just a kid, Momma
(a terrible silence) didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me
(tears well up) And you let him do it
Some big nobody in your life
and you let him do as he wanted
with the only you had
It is clear from Sandy's reserved anguish that Rae is telling the truth
Sandy firmly grips her by the arm and walks her out
Rae winces in pain like a toddler being led off to a car for a good whipping
'm sorry
didn't mean to shout
All my life  been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town
And you gonna lay the blame at my feet
Well,  ain't gonna take that
But
Momma
just tell me
not gonna be mad
we can just talk about it
Be eye to eye on this
You don't even got to say you're sorry
Just say how you knew
Only thing 'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what  should'a done
Sandy walks back up the aisle returning to her canned tuna
And then the rage hits Rae
With each breath Rae grits her teeth tighter
She grabs a mop off the side aisle and turns around
Sandy is pricing cans, down on her knees
She doesn't see Rae coming
tell me you don't know
goddamn Rae clocks her over the head, sending Sandy into the display of cans
Rae hits her again with the mop
She is screaming in short anguished breaths
Rae grabs everything she can and dumps them onto Sandy: Bags of flour, cans, entire shelves of ketchup
Mark comes running to the aisle followed by two other employees
Stunned customers watch in amazement
Rae
Rae
What are you doin'
(hysterically screaming and thrashing the mop) : - Laz and Angela are seated next to each other under the gazebo
's thinkin' about singing in the choir
At church
Mm-hm
don't know if  got a good voice or not but
practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so
(grinning) You gonna sing me somethin'
When
Now
Oh
No
Come on, just a little somethin'
Right here
Go'on now, don't be shy
Angela blushes
She looks around and then leans in close to Laz
She sings softly, sweetly, with all her soul
(singing) There is a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole
Laz is falling in love
She is so beautiful to him, he doesn't see the people running to the front of the grocery store
(singing) There is a balm in Gilead to save my sick, sick soul
(opens her eyes, speaks) So
You think  should be in the choir
Laz is grinning from ear to ear
He is about to speak but the commotion outside the grocery catches his attention
His smile fades
What
What is it
Laz bolts toward the grocery as fast as he can
- Laz rushes past the gawking customers at the end of the aisle
few male workers, including Mark, stand at a distance watching Rae weep on the floor
Sandy is being helped up by a co-worker -- her head is bleeding
Rae rocks back and forth, her face spotted with flour dust, the mop held tightly in her grip
Mark tries to step closer but Rae cries out, thrashing with the mop handle
They retreat
'
Rae lifts her eyes
: The chain pulling around Rae's waist
The radiator clanking as it is pulled
Laz's hand holding her head to him as she cries
: - Laz slowly crosses to Rae
She lifts her tear-soaked eyes to him
He kneels next to her
'll take you home now
He lifts her up in his arms
She sobs into his chest as he carries her through the onlookers
Angela is there
She looks confused and shocked
This your cousin
Laz can't lie anymore
His gaze falls to the floor
He leaves the store without saying anything to Angela
- Ronnie has parked Gill's truck on the square
He starts walking up to the grocery store
He sees Laz carrying Rae in his arms
She is sobbing into his chest, blind to all around her
Ronnie freezes in shock as Laz approaches
Move, son
(Ronnie is unable to move) Goddammit, kid, get outta my way
Laz pushes Ronnie causing him to fall backwards on to the pavement
Ronnie watches Laz put Rae in his truck and drive away wave of nausea hits
He turns over and heaves
: '  - The wooden chimes are deathly still above the porch
The evening cicadas have begun their chorus
'  -   - Rae is holding her knees to her chest in the tub
Laz sits next to her, dipping the sponge in the water, gently washing her back and shoulders
Laz moves her head back into the palm of his hand to wash her hair
She stares into his eyes as he squeezes the sponge on her forehead
You took care of your wife, like you do me
tried
: '  - Rae is wrapped in the quilt, laying on the couch
She is awake and motionless, helpless to her depression
'  -   - Laz sits on the side of his bed
Something is on his mind
We   him on his stomach searching for something under his bed
Another old guitar case comes out, followed by another, then another
Finally, Laz stands, an old maroon case in his grip
He opens the latches on the side and lifts the thin lid, revealing a gorgeous cream colored electric guitar
'  - Rae has not fallen asleep yet
She turns to see Laz entering the dark room with the maroon guitar case
You and me, we night owls
No use fightin' this shit
(tosses her a dress) Get up
: ' - Laz's truck groans as it bounces into the crowded parking lot of Bojo's
Rae steps out, looking beautiful in her sun dress
Laz slams the door to his truck, guitar case in hand
They begin walking inside
Rae's watch goes off
She quickly turns it off
But a faint echo of the alarm can be heard behind her
She stops and turns toward the truck
The sound is gone
What is it
Nothin'
They go inside
Ronnie's hand appears from under the blue tarp in the back of Laz's truck
He pulls himself out and looks around
' - Laz and Rae stand like strangers by the door
The place is wall to wall -- people at the bar, people playing pool
Laz sees the culprit of this show
is gabbing with Bojo, a beer in his hand
Get'chu at that table up yonder
By myself
You can handle it
As Rae makes her way through the crowd of people, Laz marches over to
The hell is this shit
What
called Bojo, like you say
Called up the fellas in the band
The fuck are all these people doin' here
Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since  don't know
Shit hole
Hey kiss my ass, Laz
Nigga, you go'on kiss my ass
Ya both called everybody, didn't ya
Bojo turns away to another customer
grins as he removes a flask
He offers it to Laz
Laz snaps it away
There you go, preacher man
Get me drunk so  don't stick my foot up yo ass
just know how you get
Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut
Laz and
look over at Rae seated alone at a small table near the stage
Heard about this morning
We ain't here to talk about that shit
Laz surprises
by walking away and up onto the stage
Rae watches as Laz, shakes hands with some of the band members
few whistles from the crowd
Laz sits down at a chair off to the right of a short mic stand
He plugs in
Rae watches curiously as Laz tunes his guitar -- moans of electric distortion
sits next to her
You in for it, now
He gonna nail it to the wall tonight
done pissed him off
The drummer kicks in
Laz tears into the strings
The entire place begins to undulate and bounce as Laz returns to the blues
(singing) don't know, but  been around, tell me them women shake 'em on down
Cheers
Rae watches in awe
She's never seen anything like it
She is surrounded by couples dancing so close they might as well be naked
But there is also a great sense of safety as Laz controls the room with his music
(singing) Yes, 'm goin' Georgia line
See if them women sweet like mine
, a black man in his 30's, asks Rae to dance
You wanna cut it up, baby
(shrugging) Well
Rae looks up at Laz
Laz smiles and nods
Rae takes the man's hand and moves out onto the dance floor
can't be seated anymore
He stands and stomps his foot
(shouting at Laz) Yeah, you know you home, old man
You just walked through the door
(singing) don't know, but  been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll
Rae allows Laz's voice and guitar to take hold of her
Her face gets wet with sweat as she moves, making love to the current in the air
Men are dancing all around her, but now she is in control
She turns to a young man and shakes, then an old man
She is free, herself, and above all, safe
Laz smiles, unaware of Ronnie watching from the window behind him
There is rage and confusion in his face as he watches Rae surrounded by dancing limbs
: '  -  - Both Laz and Rae are drinking water from the sink in tall glasses like they've been stranded in a desert
Are you drunk
(Laz shrugs) Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'
Yeah, gal  been here before
(smiling) guess you have
'  -   - Laz is taking off his shoes, getting ready to crash for the night
He sits down on the side of his bed and takes off his shirt, leaving his -shirt on
Rae is standing in his doorway
Laz
Can  sleep with you tonight
Don't think that'd be wise
didn't mean it nothin' dirty
know you didn't
But you a grown girl
You can handle it
got to
Rae understands
She crosses to Laz and kisses him on the cheek
Rae then walks down the hall to her couch in the front room
Laz turns off the light
: -  - Rae enters the dark bathroom and shuts the door behind her
Her hair is shorter, a shaggy bob, bleached platinum blond
, always behind the door, attempts to enter, but Rae pushes the door closed and locks it
Baby, where you goin'
'm gonna pee
gotta take a break and go pee
Now, this isn't fair
You said could do it, too
Eat shit and die, Arty
girl can change her fuckin' mind
Rae finds the light switch
She yelps upon seeing Ronnie crouched by the tub
Suddenly feeling violated Rae yanks down on her shirt to hide the fact that she's not wearing anything else
Hey
Hey
You don't gotta get up but
gotta go
Ronnie attempts to get up but it's too late, Rae has already squatted on the commode, pinning Ronnie between her and the bathtub
Rae is breathing heavy, her focus is scattered
She's coming up or coming down from a big burn
(waiting for pee) think if  just piss
'll be okay
You feelin' sick
'm just in one of my moods
You know how  get
Yeah,  know
Ronnie tries to look away, trying to make an awkward moment less awkward
Rae's anxiety is hitting her
think it'd be better if you talk to me
Yeah
Just about anything, you know
It can be funny or
not
Just tell me somethin'
Ronnie nervously considers this before agreeing to open his mouth
He points into the tub
Well
That's my vomit
came in here to get sick
thought 'd make the toilet but
anyway,  got sick
Are you wasted
No
just got a messed up stomach
(remembering) Holy shit
What
Holy shit, Ronnie
(smacks him on the arm) You're a fuckin' rock star
'm a what
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight
Shit
That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal
Ronnie leans over and dry heaves into the tub
It is painful
Rae leans forward and touches his back, comforting him
Hey
You okay, Ronnie
Ronnie falls back, gripping his stomach, there are tears in his eyes from the dry heaving
Suddenly emotion hits him
(through tears and clenched teeth) Box of cereal
well, Goddamn
(looks at his trembling fists) Everybody keeps sayin' things to me take make me feel great
But  don't feel great at all
feel like 'm comin' outta my skin
Like 'm losin' control of my mind
(looks into Rae's eyes) 'm not like this
'm not usually so
afraid
(really starts crying) don't know what's
wrong
Rae pulls Ronnie to her
He cries into her shoulder
She gently rubs his wet face and sings her words of comfort
Is'okay
Is'okay
Ronnie begins to calm down
The sobbing abates
The metal music from the party outside is muffled through the door
The two hold onto each other in silence
Rae pees
They both giggle, a welcome release of tension
feel better
Do you
Yeah,  do
'  - Ronnie lifts his head from sleep - his memory of Rae has vanished
He is leaning against the corner of the barn, his
45 in his grip
His gaze slowly turns toward Laz's darkened house
His hand begins to shake
'  - crow squawks in the rows of corn
bright morning is coming
'  -   - Laz is still asleep
The sound of clumsy guitar playing, accompanied by a tiny voice, can be heard
(plucking, trying to find the right note) You
are my
sunshine
Laz opens his eyes
'  - Laz quietly creeps into the doorway to watch Rae struggle with the guitar playing
He could stay there for hours watching this little girl play his guitar
Rae looks up and sees Laz
She stops playing
Sorry
Looks like you know a song
Don't know where  learn't it, but
it's there in my head
Laz sits next to her and takes the guitar from her
(playing a tune) How you feelin' today
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover
Like your eyes can open a little bit more
know that
Woke up real early
Sun was shining
Just thought 'd mess around, try to learn a song
Go'on and sing it, 'll play
No, you do it
can't sing
Stop that foolishness
Just do as say and close your eyes
(Rae closes her eyes) Close your eyes
And think about
well, for a song like this, 'd say you think about what you love
What  love
Get a good picture in your mind
Rae's playful smile turns serious
Laz continues playing
Think on that
And sing wit me
(Laz comes in singing) You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
& You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
Rae opens her eyes with a delightful giggle
Laz continues playing
Good
know another
It go like this
(sings) Last night dear, as  lay sleeping
dreamed  held you in my arms
When  awoke dear,  was mistaken
So  hung my head and  cried
(to Rae) Close your eyes Rae
sing it
Rae doesn't hesitate to obey
With her eyes closed and Laz playing, neither can see Ronnie creeping up from the kitchen with his gun
(singing) You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
Ronnie looks sick with pain as he points the barrel at the back of Laz's head
(singing) You'll never know dear, how much love you
Please don't take your sunshine away
(opens her eyes) Laz spins around knocking away Ronnie's arm
The gun fires into the wall
The guitar cracks on the floor
Rae screams
Laz lunges at Ronnie but Ronnie is faster
He spins Laz around and slams him to the floor, pushing his gun into Laz's face
Ronnie looks up at Rae, his eyes red with sorrow and rage
He pushes the gun to the side of Laz's head
Rae cries
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore
Gill told me
Told me how you and he
you and everybody
Ronnie
Please, baby
(to Laz) Did 'ya have fun with her
Sweet as a peach,  bet
Huh
Huh
Laz glares back, not saying a word
Goddamn it,  ask you a question, you better answer it, or 'm gonna blast a hole in ya
Ronnie
Rae moves closer
Ronnie points his gun at her and screams
Careful how you point that gun, boy
(points gun back at Laz) Or what
Boy
You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when blow your face off
You sayin' you'll do what
You heard me, mother-fucker
'll fuckin' kill
(cutting him off) You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck
Ronnie can't believe what was just said -- mostly, because it's true
The gun begins to shake in his hand
You testing me
Huh
You testin' me, old man
Test
Shit
What kind'a test you thinkin'
You mean like, if you a man or not
If you a killer
Only one way to prove that
You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back
Ronnie grips the shaking gun
severe attack is on the rise as he listens to Laz
Ain't that easy, is it
been in some scraps, son,  know
First there's that loud crack
Always louder than you think
Like it just come-up- a-cloud and clapped a mess thunder right in ya hand
Ronnie flinches
He tries to control his breathing
White light
Smell of smoke
Taste of my blood and brains in your mouth, stingin' ya eyes
Ronnie almost vomits, but he holds it back
Oh, baby
just let me
Rae moves closer to him, wanting to comfort him but she stops as Ronnie points the gun at her
His eyes pleading for her to stay back
,
(Ronnie obeys) You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason
(watches Ronnie fight his attack) You know she been here with me, don't cha
Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own
Put all your love and dreams into one woman
she turn around and give it all to another man
That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid
She'd fear ya then
Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind
She with a real man now real
flood of tears are streaming down Ronnie's face
The gun is shaking furiously in his hand
Don't
don't say that to me
(getting fed up) Son, 'm grown
Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk
'm too old to play house
(looks at Rae and then back at Ronnie) and cowboys
So let's have it
End me or get out of my face
Ronnie looks like a scared five year old having an asthma attack
Laz barks at him one last time
Go'on
Do it
(silence) The last shout from Laz completely destroys Ronnie
His shoulders slump
The gun lowers in his grasp
low sob is heard as he falls to his knees
Laz snatches the gun from his hand and stands
Ronnie
Rae inches closer to Ronnie as he kneels over and weeps
She gently touches his shoulder
He turns his anguished face to her and tries to speak
can't stop
can't stop
being scared
What am  gonna do
Ronnie hides his face in his hands
Rae throws her arms around him and holds him tight
got you, baby
got you
Laz removes the clip and crosses to the kitchen
He slams the gun on the sink, opens a drawer and removes the wall phone
(seeing Laz plug the phone in) What are you doing
(Laz dials a number) You gonna call the cops
You think they gonna help this
They ever help you, Laz
Huh
(Laz listens on the phone) Laz looks at Rae
There is hurt in his eyes
Thought you knew me better, gal
(into the phone) need you at my house
right now
: '  - crosses from the kitchen
He hands a glass of water to Rae seated on the couch
He hands another to Ronnie seated next to her
sits before them as Laz lingers in the doorway
(to Ronnie) imagine there's a lot of good between you two
But  want you to tell me what's bad
Go'on
And don't hold back
Ronnie is very uncomfortable
He looks at Rae seated next to him and then back at
hate this town
You can't round the corner without bumping into someone who's got your number
(a brief look at Rae) We did a lot of dreamin', me and Rae
Makin' plans to get out
'd do my tour and
we'd move outta here
Go to Chattanooga
And 'd work for my uncle
(looks down, tears come to Ronnie) But
when Rae gets like she does
And she does the things that she always done
Makes me feel like she loves this place more'n me
Rae starts shaking her head, tears come to her eyes
raises a hand to silence her
Go on, Ronnie
All my life people called me shit like, sissy and
nervous and got few things in my life that make me feel like
like
Like a man
(surprised) Yes
mean that's it
wanna feel like a man with her
wanna feel like the only man with her
Ronnie wipes the tears from his eyes with his shirt sleeve
turns to Rae
(looks at Rae) Now, Rae, we're not here to fix you or judge you
Only you and the Almighty can do that
But  want you to tell me about these spells you get
Rae takes a deep breath
She looks up at Laz
He encourages her with a nod
It starts like this
fire
that spreads
Starts in my head
Then moves to my stomach
Then it goes lower
can stop it sometimes but mostly  just jump on and ride it out
then everything'll go back to normal, you know
Only thing ever took that feeling away was
was
when  met Ronnie
(the emotion really hits hard) Cuz  love him so much
He's all got in my life that's special
And like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous
When  can do that for him
it's like 'm givin' somethin' of myself that haven't givin' nobody else
Rae, look at Ronnie
And tell him how you feel
Rae turns to Ronnie
Her nose is running as she wipes away her tears
think
think we're fucked up
Both of us
know  am
But
that don't mean what  feel ain't true
It don't mean  can't love
And know, how  been is
is So if you want to quit on me
understand
But please
please
don't
Ronnie is very moved by Rae's plea
He touches her face and wipes away a tear
So
What'chu two gonna do about this
: '  - The door opens
Angela looks surprised to see Laz
She is dressed in jeans, a -shirt, wearing rubber gloves from cleaning
Hey
Hey
You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address
Hope you don't mind me comin' over
What do you need
need ya help again
Angela notices Rae and Ronnie seated in Laz's truck
More cough syrup
Can  come in
Angela takes a breath and opens the door wider
'  - It is a small house, but tidy
Angela motions for Laz to sit
lied to you
It was wrong
But at the time
didn't know what to do
Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal 's carryin'
Laz
you don't need to explain yourself to me
Yes,  do
Cuz  feel for you
Mean to say
(long pause) got feelings for you
And  didn't want you to think
didn't
(how to say
) don't want you to go away
There's better ways to say what 'm trying to say, but
they it is
Don't go away
Angela thinks on this
She rises out of her seat and crosses to Laz, sitting next to him on the love seat
Laz
'm gonna put my trust in you
'm gonna do it knowin' all too well can get hurt like this
And  have been hurt
Just like you
(beat) Woman like me,  got a lot of livin' to do
But my days are precious to me
They all  got left
Don't want no more fuss
want love in my life
You understanding me, Laz
do
God's truth
do
They stay locked in each others' sight
Then, the slowest, most gentle kiss happens between them
When they separate, Laz is lost in her eyes
Now what'chu need me to do
Cuz 'm gonna go do it
: - Laz enters the pool hall and spots Tehronne
Tehronne motions him back
Next to Tehronne is an old black man named
Yo, this here Pinetop
think he got what you lookin' for
Pinetop grins and produces a black velvet cloth
He opens it gently and spreads it out, revealing a long, thin, gold chain
Laz nods, approvingly
That'll do
-   - Tehronne leads Laz down the back steps
They both round the corner, revealing an old Chevy Caprice
It is light brown except for one door that is gray, however the chrome rims on the car are impressive -- worth more that the entire car by a long shot
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good
Got fresh 22's on her
Ain't my doin'
That's just how it came to me
Don't worry
Nobody gonna come lookin' for it
got the pinks
got no problem
(hands Laz the keys) Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus
(moved, impressed) Don't see generosity much these days
Everything always got a catch
Guess 'm tryin' to say
thank you
Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people
And you know what
'm good at it
Naw what  mean
Tehronne walks back into the pool hall, leaving Laz alone
: ' '  - Rhonda has three white dresses over her arm as she hurries past Ronnie, seated next to the back dressing rooms
The door doesn't close all the way
He stands and moves in for a peek
Angela pokes her head out and grins
What are you doing
(shrugs) Just wanted to see
You know the rules
(vacant look from Ronnie) You do know the rules, don't you
Yeah,  know
Then start taking them seriously
Yes, ma'am
' '  -   - Rae is standing in bra and panties up on a small platform in front of a tri-divided mirror
Ella Mae takes the dresses from Rhonda
Angela sees that Rae is nervous
It's okay to breathe, honey
Yes, ma'am
: '  - Ronnie is wearing a brown corduroy jacket
He is attempting to tie his neck tie in the side mirror of Laz's truck
Lincoln, also wearing his Sunday best, steps up behind him
You Ronnie
Yeah
'm Lincoln
Guess 'm gonna be your best man
(ultimately accepting) Okay
You havin' trouble with that tie
Cuz 'm pretty good at it
Ronnie nods
Lincoln steps behind him to tie the tie
Gotta do it like this or  get all turned around
'  - Laz is wearing the same suit he wore at the cafe with Rose
He is seated in Ronnie's trailer, outside the back bedroom door
Angela steps out from the bedroom with a grin
She's ready for you
'  -   - Laz opens the door, carefully looking around the doorjam
He sees her standing before the dresser mirror
She looks beautiful, simple, and elegant
Rae desperately searches Laz's eyes for approval
Now that's sharp
That's real sharp
Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she
You like it
've had nice things before but always ruined 'em somehow
Well, this one's yours now
You ready to take care of it
Rae bows her head
She fights back tears
want to
More'n anything
But
Laz holds her face in his hands
He speaks softly
Now
let's stop that
(smiles) You and me
we can handle this
You hear me, gal
We gonna be just fine
Now live ya life
Pull your shit together and live your life
His words are piercing and true
Rae nods, decides
Okay
's words are heard as Rae wraps her arms around Laz and rests her head on his chest
don't want you to let go
Maybe  won't
(
) When  was a child,  talked like a child
thought like a child, reasoned like a child
: '  - Ronnie turns toward the trailer
He is in his suit, standing in his front yard -- Lincoln at his side
stands to the side with a Bible in his hands
(
) When  became a man,  put childish ways behind me
Ronnie is amazed with what he sees
Laz leads beautiful Rae down the steps as Angela tends to her side
(
) Now we see but a poor reflection as in the mirror; then we shall see face to face
know in part; then shall know fully, even as  am fully known
Rae holds firm to Laz's arm as they come together on the green grass to witness and perform this union
(
) And now these three remain: faith, hope and love
But the greatest of these is love
(Looks to Laz) Who gives this girl in marriage
do
Lazarus takes a few steps with Rae, offering her arm to Ronnie
Ronnie and Laz stay locked in each other's gaze
You got her now
Laz stands next to Angela as Ronnie and Rae face
together
Ronnie
Rae
want you to look at each other and listen to me carefully
Do you understand
& Yes
Yes, sir
They both obey -- each with a serious expression
require and charge you both as you stand in the presence of God to remember that love and loyalty alone will avail as a foundation of a happy and enduring home
(to Lincoln) Go on, hand it to him
Lincoln steps toward Ronnie and holds up the black velvet
Ronnie takes the gold chain and carefully wraps it around Rae's waist
No human ties are more tender
No vows more sacred than those you now assume
Laz looks on -- a conflicted emotion of joy and loss
If these solemn vows be kept inviolate, the home which you are establishing will abide in peace and your life will be filled with joy
Angela reaches over and takes Laz's hand in hers
: /
& '   - Ronnie is at the wheel of the Chevy Caprice
Rae sits silently next to him
Rae looks out the window as a huge 18 wheeler rolls up on her side
She tries to ignore it and the tension it brings
She turns to see that Ronnie is sweating
Another truck is on his side sandwiching them in
An attack is coming over Ronnie
His breath is short
His chest tightens
Rae reaches over and gently strokes the back of his neck
gotta pull over
He breaks
The two trucks zoom ahead as Ronnie breaks to the side
Dust flies as the Chevy skids to a stop on the side of the road
Trucks zip by shaking the car, as Ronnie tries to get control of his breathing
Rae tries to stay calm, stroking the back of his neck as he struggles for breath
He puts his forehead against the wheel to stave off the building nausea
(through clenched teeth) Fear comes to Rae's face as she notices her middle finger scratching at the back of Ronnie's neck
She pulls it away and shoves her hand between her thighs
Her eyes close as the burning builds
She grips the gold chain around her waist
The chain, tight around Rae as she struggles
Rae panting and sweating on Laz's floor
She reaches out
Her hand lands on the strings of his guitar
single string is plucked
: /
& '   - Rae opens her eyes -- the low note still sounding in her head
She places her hand back on his neck
And then, soft as a prayer: (singing) You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy, when times are gray
Ronnie slowly turns and looks at Rae, his head still resting on the steering wheel
The panting has slowed
Color starts returning to his cheeks
(singing) You'll never know dear, how much love you
