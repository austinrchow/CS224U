Written by Richard Lagravenese 16, 2009 -   - An upstate New York town
is being dismantled
The Big Top falls and is gathered up by workmen
Trucks are being loaded with animals
-   -  - ,   - 93 year old - stands alone, with a walker in the middle of the empty parking lot
His shirt is stained with sweat - as if it took great effort for him to get there
As he watches the Circus disappear, Jacob looks lost, bewildered and fragile
, 50's circus manager, and , a tattooed teen with rings through his eyebrows, approach him with a wheelchair
Excuse me sir, can we help you
(No reply from Jacob) Did you miss your ride
missed the Spec
The what
Yes, 'm afraid you did
Can we call someone for you
() Where'd it all go
He's seriously old
Did you come with the folks from the retirement home
No,  came on my own
( ) Let's go inside and we can call them to pick you up
Charlie motions for Russ to get Jacob in the wheelchair
Jacob resists
2
No,  told ya,  came on my own and 'm not going back
Get your hands off me
(as if talking to a child) It's
We're gonna call the home so they can come pick you up
( ) Why don't you pick some of those rings out ya head maybe you won't be so stupid, ya dumb little shit
Woah
The language
Uncalled for
Sir, we need to get you out of this parking lot
My trucks have to come through here
Please
He offers the wheelchair
Jacob relents and sits
(') got it Russ
Take the walker
Finish closing up the ticket booth
Russ takes the walker and exits as Charlie wheels Jacob
In my day, they had old timers in the ticket wicket and freaks like him in the sideshow
Damn kid didn't even know what the Spec was
You sound like you know circuses
Charlie checks his watch, impatient to get Jacob home
should
was on two
(Calling  to Trucks) Malcolm, tell them to come through
(Patronizing, to Jacob) Two circuses
Wow, that's something
3
Ringling, of course, but that was later
'll need your name when  call the home
First one was called Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show
Charlie suddenly stops upon hearing that name
What
Wait a minute
Did you say you were with the Benzini Brothers
( ) What years
1931
" 31
You're saying you were there for the---
was in the middle of it
() don't believe this
After the Hartford Fire and the Hagenback- Wallace Wreck, that's the most famous circus disaster of all time
remember it like yesterday
Better - cause  don't remember yesterday
( ) Charlie 'Brien the third
Jacob Jankowski the only
Mr
Jankowski,  would be honored if you would have a drink with me in my trailer
4
'  -  - bottle of expensive, Laphroaig scotch sits on the table
Charlie pours them each a shot
Jacobs drinks
It feels good
(to the Scotch) Ah,  remember you
Camel would've loved this stuff
Camels drink scotch
Jacob laughs, shaking his head No
Charlie pours another; (') You really got here on you're own
The Great Escape
But  got lost
should call the home, let them know where you are
don't know why they call it a "home"
You don't know anybody there
They fill you so full of drugs, you don't care
Five kids and not one has a place for me since their mother died
They take turns visiting me on weekends
They forgot whose turn it was today so nobody showed up
() had a life, ya know
big life
It isn't right
Charlie empathizes
Pours another
Changes the subject
So, how did the Benzini Brothers stampede start
The story is two guys got thrown off the train and-- No point in telling a story if all you want to know is the end
Sorry
From the beginning
5
Now, let's see
the beginning
Well, everything began the same day everything ended
Ha, isn't that how it always works
- '  - 1931 - mirrored medicine cabinet closes revealing the reflection of   - 23 years old, handsome, full of energy
(
) It was a big day
My final exams
-  - Jacob bounds down the stairs and into the kitchen
'    are finishing up breakfast
The Father tunes a Philco Radio while smoking a pipe
The Mother pours coffee wearing a cardigan sweater and pearls
Late for class, Jacob grabs a piece of bread and bacon and downs a coffee as his mother sweetly scolds him in
His father says something supportive in  as well
Jacob thanks him in
He kisses his mother and exits
-   - 1931 - simple, clapboard house in a middle class neighborhood
Jacob runs out, passing his father's sign on the front lawn: Doctor of Veterinary Medicine - 1931 - ,  -
The beautiful campus of Cornell University
Jacob runs
(
) After six years of dissections, castrations, foalings and shoving my arm up a cow's ass more times than  cared to remember,  was finally going to graduate Cornell in Veterinary Science
was summa cum laude
ha,ha and the oldest male virgin on campus
6
, 1931 - ,  - Jacob sits beside a beautiful Blonde who distracts him with her legs
She notices him staring, crosses her legs and smooths her skirt
is written on the board of a Lecture Hall
The Proctor announces from his desk
You may begin
Jacob, the Blonde and fifty other students open their exam booklets and begin under The 's supervision
(
) had my whole life planned
knew exactly where it was taking me
And then, with the opening of a door, it all vanished
The Lecture Hall door opens and   enters
The Dean walks to the Proctor and they confer privately
Then: Mr
Jankowski
May we have a word
Fifty pairs of eyes turn to look at Jacob, who looks up
-  - Jacob steps outside with Dean Wilkins
Jacob, it's your parents
'm afraid there's been a car accident
-   - Jacob walks down a dimly lit hall with a Police Chief and a Chaplain to the Morgue led by a Nurse
We follow them inside
'  -   -  - The room is windowless and bare except for  , each with a sheet-covered body
stands between them
Jacob sees a steel table upon which lay his parents belongings; wedding rings, pearl necklace, his father's pipe
7
Are you ready
The Chaplain places a comforting hand on Jacob's shoulder
Jacob nods
The Coroner exposes first Jacob's father, then Jacob's mother
We see only Jacob's expression: Is there any other family to call
No
Just me
- Jacob, in a black suit
Mr
Hyde is seated opposite him
know this is difficult for you, but there's been no mistake
The house and all their assets, including your father's practise, are now property of the bank in default of the mortgage
But 'm telling you, my father put away every penny he ever earned
They owned that house outright
Why would he have a mortgage
My guess is because he let people pay him in beans & eggs or whatever they had, instead of money
And so he's penalized for not turning away people who couldn't afford his help
He was a doctor
Yes,  know, he was a very good man but in banking terms, in the reality of what makes this world actually function, he was an irresponsible man
'm sorry, but you oughta to know the truth
This Depression is going to last for a long while
() 8
(') And the only ones who will be standing at the end of it, are the ones who fight to take what they need to survive
Everyone else is going to disappear
Don't make the same mistakes as your father
Jacob is disturbed by this description of his father
-  ,  - Jacob in his black suit walking home
looks up ahead to see: -  - All the family possessions are on the lawn being scoured over by strangers: father's Philco radio, mother's jewelry foreclosure sign hangs beside his father's business sign: (
) Things happened so fast, my head was spinning
And that mortgage just couldn't figure it out
pulls up at the curb
It is met by , who receives a package and carries it to Jacob, meeting him halfway
This just came for you, Jacob
Whatever it is 'm going to have to include in the bank's report of assets
Sorry
You
( ) also have documents to sign
The Bank Representative continues  as Jacob opens the package, (
) didn't believe the lawyer or the bank
My mother worked
They had savings
We were never broke
So why would they need a mortgage
And then it hit me
Jacob opens the package revealing a   , reading; 9
(
) They did it to pay for my Ivy League education
For a moment Jacob can't move
This thought stuns him
With his house being picked apart and the Bank Representative speaking about papers, Jacob can't take it any longer
He drops the sign and walks away
The Bank Rep calls after him: Jacob
Jacob they need these signed by the end of the business day
Jacob walks away from the Bank Rep, pulling off his tie and tossing it
He is crying - the reality finally hitting him
(
) walked and  kept on walking
It's a strange feeling becoming an orphan the same time you're becoming a man
To have this freedom to be anything you want at the same time everything you were is taken away
So  just walked Then all of a sudden,  stopped
-    - Jacob stands with his feet in a clear stream
He is no longer crying
There are dense woods, pitch black, all around him
(
) Like 'd been sleepwalking and woke up
had no idea where  was
Jacob can hear the buzz of insects, the glow of fireflies and the cries of distant animals in the woods
It unnerves him
Far off beyond the dense woods Jacob sees - like a distant, silent star moving past the trees
The Light is moving around the woods until it curves towards Jacob's direction
He hears a distant -
Curious, Jacob puts his shoes on and walks back to a gravel path that leads to   just as: Jacob is so close, he is hit by a wall of wind that nearly knocks him down
It is dark and the train is moving fast
10
(
) (') What is it inside of us makes us decide to grab onto life again and again, no matter how many times it abandons us without a second thought
What is it makes us hungry for more of the same
Somebody smart should figure that one out
Jacob makes his decision: He runs parallel to the train
stumbling over gravel, pitching forward and losing his balance, recovering, then running faster, scanning for something to grab hold of to hoist himself up
He sees: As it catches up to him, he lunges forward, reaching for the iron grab hold and flings himself upward
He clings on with his left leg, elbow and chin
His right hand clings to the grab hold
With his left hand, he claws the floorboards of the stock car, but the aged wood scraps off under his fingers
His right leg is dangling, beneath the train itself, dangerously close to the tracks
Jacob is slipping
slipping
With everything he's got, Jacob makes one final "life or death" effort, managing to get his left knee up over the edge
Using foot, knee, chin, elbow and fingernails, he scrapes his way inside the stock car and lies panting
-   - dim light barely illuminates the interior
Jacob breaths a brief sigh of relief and accomplishment when suddenly: ,     ,
Jacob swings at this Brute with his free arm but it's blocked easily, as the Brute moves him to the open car door
(
) Oh, don't go messin with Blackie
Throwing people off of trains is one of the perks of his job
Jacob can now see   playing cards by a kerosene lamp
, aimed at Jacob
Another,  , , drinks out of a jug
Blackie holds Jacob out on the edge of the open stock car, as trees slam against the train almost cutting Jacob's face
11
We don't need no bums on this train brother
You can get off right now and keep running
Old Timer rises with a lantern and hobbles on one bad leg, inspects Jacob and his nice suit with the lantern
Now everybody calm down here
Grady put that damn rifle away '
And  mean on the inside of the train
Jacob struggles as Blackie pins one arm behind him
(') 'm tellin ya, ya can't red light him, we don't need that trouble
Look at them clothes - he's no bum
Blackie scans Jacob's clothes, then tosses him inside the train and returns to the card game
Jacob pants, relieved
(') Don't be sore kid
It's more like a reflex with Blackie
'm Camel
And that there's Grady
And Bill
Jacob
Jankowski
Nice to meet you
You're pretty young for the rails
You running from something boy
You on the lam
No
Nothing like that
Where you headed
don't know
Hungry
Outta work
( ) No shame in it
What can you do
About anything  guess
12
Camel gives him the once-over look then offers the jug
We land in Deposit in the morning
We'll find you some work
And if you're still alive by the end of it, 'll get you some food and take you to Uncle August
Jacob drinks and chokes on the liquor
Who's that
August Rosenbluth
Lord and Master of the Known and Unknown Universes
Ringmaster Extraordinaire
Jacob looks baffled
Camel laughs as he drinks more; Oh kid, don't tell me you didn't notice
Grady and Bill laugh though Blackie remains un-amused
Ha, he really don't know
You didn't just jump a train boy
You jumped the Flying Squadron of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth
You done landed your ass on a circus, kid
-: The Circus Train brakes screeching to a halt
- ,  -
Jacob is rolled awake as the train stops
He is disoriented as Blackie, Grady and Bill jump out through the open stock car door
Camel is fast asleep, drunk from the jug
/  - ,  -
The Train has stopped adjacent to a huge grassy lot
Beyond it, the scattered buildings of Deposit,  backlit by dawn
13
Jacob jumps out of the stock car, in awe of what he sees:: Hundreds of dirty, unshaven men pouring out of the train like ants on candy
The wagons of the train are painted scarlet red with gold trim and sunburst wheels
Emblazoned on each wagon;
Jacob wanders as the Circus is being created: Canvas tents are raised, the Big Top laying sprawled on the ground
Men standing over seams, lacing pieces together
Eight man sledge teams pound stakes into the ground at breakneck speed
Teams of men are raising enormous poles with their combined weight, chanting: Pull it
Shake it
Break it
Again
Now down stake it
Several teams horses pulling wagons are charging right for Jacob
Jacob jumps out of the way, nearly being run down
He is out of place
in the way of this finely tuned machine
Jacob ducks into a   for safety
-  - Jacob enters
stillness takes the place of the chaos outside: The translucent tent is as tall as the sky
It has barely been set up - just the tent and: Jacob is in awe
Camels, llamas, zebras and horses stand behind low ropes slung between iron stakes, some with their heads in mounds of hay
Two giraffes stand within a chain- link fence
lions, tigers, panthers, jaguars, bears, chimps and an Orangutan
The animals stop moving, as if to give Jacob an acknowledgement
Jacob responds with a nod or a smile
The Orangutan is stretching it's arm outside it's den for something out of reach
Jacob tries to understand
What is it
What do you want
The Orangutan strains its arm
Blinking at him
Pointing
Jacob looks around and sees     on the ground in front of the cage
He picks it up
Jacob opens the den and hands the Orangutan the orange
She takes it and sets it on the floor of her den
She returns and reaches out for Jacob again
14
Jacob hesitates, not knowing what she wants
But deciding to trust her, Jacob extends his hand to hers
The Orangutan wraps her long fingers around Jacob's hand and holds it for a beat, looking to his face
Jacob returns the gaze, realizing she is thanking him
He is touched
(') You're welcome, ma'am
The Orangutan lets go and returns to the orange in her den
(
) What the hell you doing in here
Get outta there
You ain't a menagerie man
Only menagerie men is allowed in there
Jacob runs out to Camel
-  - Camel escorts Jacob through the grounds to a baggage car
Gonna try to get you set up with Crazy Joe
Do  call him Crazy Joe
It has been said Crazy Joe went to prison for killing a man who spit into the wind and hit the back of Joe's neck
So no,  would not call this man Crazy Joe to his face
Camel and Jacob walks on to an open stock car door, where stands - a burly man, missing three fingers
(') Hey Joe
got a First of May here
Think you can use him
Crazy Joe scans Jacob, shoots an oyster of dark brown tobacco juice then disappears back inside
Camel tells Jacob; (') You're in, kid
15
/
- ,  - Jacob and another Young Man, , with their shirts off, are shovelling tons of horse manure
Jacob is queasy, blinking from the stench
The Young Man doesn't seem bothered
've never seen so much manure
Baggage stock horses
They pack'em in 27 a car
How do you stand the smell
What smell
- ,  - Jacob and several other Flying Squadron men struggle to pull on cables hoisting up the canvases on the Big Top
It takes a tremendous effort
Jacob uses every bit of strength
When the Big Top is raised, Jacob can't help but be impressed with the accomplishment as the local townsfolk (rubes) cheer
- Jacob struggles to shovel  manure out of the menagerie
He checks his hands - they are blistered and bleeding
-  - ,  - ,  , is "speechifying" from a platform beside the sideshow entrance, strutting back and forth, as a crowd gathers
Jacob and other working men, including Wade, are positioned around the perimeter of the crowd
When Cecil gives the signal ya gotta push the rubes in towards the entrance but without them catching on or else they'll be a fight
Jacob, Wade and the other men position themselves equidistant around the perimeter of the crowd facing Cecil
16
When Cecil pulls his ear (the Signal)
Jacob and the other men move forward, inching the crowd into the sideshow tents
- Jacob shovels  manure more easily having taped his blistered hands
'   - ,  -
Grady hands Jacob a long lead pipe
Stand inside the tent and smack the sides with this when you see a head trying to peek in without paying
Jacob follows Grady into the tent
'   -  -
Jacob enters and is paralyzed by what he sees: Camera angles behind  - a topless woman on stage alone in front of rows of ogling men - as she maneuvers her breasts in circles flipping the tassels attached to them
The men hoot and holler for more as Barbara smiles encouragingly, hiding her routine boredom
Jacob is paralyzed by the sight of a naked woman
Grady frantically motions for Jacob to snap out of it and use the pipe at the heads sneaking under the tent to peek in
Startled out of his enthrallment, Jacob lifts the pipe too quickly and hits his own forehead
then proceeds to do his job, banging the heads thru the flaps
/  - ,  - Jacob shovels  manure, no longer affected by the scent
By this point, the menagerie tent has been fully installed: Ten chandeliers hang and twinkle from the roof illuminating the a gloriously bannered candy stand in the tent's center
Jacob hears someone entering the menagerie
He turns to see; 17
Behind the rows of beautiful black and white horses, Jacob catches flashes of pink sequins
pink tights
pink sequined gloves of a  caressing and whispering to them
She is
Her shimmering eyes and hair
Her porcelain skin
Her pink sequins make her glisten and sparkle
Jacob is spellbound as he watches Marlena's gift with horses; Marlena uses signals with her whip or clicking sounds with her tongue to communicate with the horses: they line up at her subtle command, they raise their hooves, they bow down to her, rise up on their hind legs
She clicks her tongue and one White Silver Maned Horse lifts a hoof for her to inspect
She clicks for him to take a step
Jacob notices the Silver Maned Horse walks tenderly on the foot
He decides to help
Approaching the shimmering Marlena, Jacob looks like he's been shovelling shit all day
Excuse me, ma'am
Hi
'm Jacob
Marlena doesn't respond
She looks at him with suspicion
(') May
He may be foundering
Marlena nods
Jacob also clicks his tongue as he glides his hands up Silver Star's fetlock
To Marlena's surprise, the horse trusts Jacob, lifting its hoof
Jacob examines it
(') He should be all right for tonight
But 'd put him on stall rest as soon as possible
He clicks his tongue and eases the hoof down
Marlena looks both impressed and insulted
Jacob smiles
Marlena does not
She clicks and assembles her horses in formation, then leads them out of the menagerie
Jacob looks after her adoringly
-: (
) - ,  -  - Camera follows Jacob into the Big Top
18
Jacob arrives as we reveal: -  , -   , : Jacob can barely contain himself
The Audience - young and old - is captivated
Faces of poor Depression era townspeople light up with joy and amazement; During Jacob's lines we see; Clowns, jugglers, acrobats, exotic animals, Marlena with her Horses, high divers on fire diving into a tank of water
it is truly spectacular: (
) You never saw anything like it
You could hardly take it all in without fearing you might go blind from the shine
From one kind of world too hard to bear came some kind a heaven no one knew existed
End on Jacob seeing: Marlena gloriously atop her horses who form a tableau, as a curtain of sparks falls behind them
- ,  - The Big Top drops
Poles topple
Horses, men and equipment dismantle the great city of tents
(
) And then just as quickly, heaven was packed away and gone
'  -    - As the train travels, a worn out Jacob sits cramped under a bunk beside   taking up little space
Jacob voraciously eats a plate of food Camel snuck in for him
You like the food
You deserve it
You done good,  hear
() 19
(') ( ) Woah, you better take a breath before it all comes back up on ya
Here
Have a hit of Jake
He offers Jacob his "Jake"
Jacob drinks and chokes
(') It's an acquired taste
Now get yourself outta there
'm gonna take you in to see August
As Jacob squeezes out, the Contortionist unwinds himself and takes up more space
But it's the middle of the night
Only time circus people live - when they don't have to work
Come on
/  -  - Camel leads Jacob through various sleeping cars, revealing the lowly conditions of life on the road
wooden bunks, no private space, one bathroom for a dozen to share
: - The Musicians Car: Men smoking, cleaning instruments
looking at Jacob with suspicion and wry humor
The Trumpet Player plays
Jacob doesn't understand why
got a son about your age
Lives outside of Reading,
Haven't seen him for years
Fix your shirt there
Jacob shoves in his shirt
Camel smiles
He likes the kid
- The Clown Car: Clowns without make-up reading or playing cards
They look at Jacob as if he were walking the last mile
One Clown waves goodbye
(') Remember, when you meet August let him do the talking and don't ever mention Ringling
He hates them bastards worse than the Depression
20
- Barbara and the Coochie Girls Car; Girls in various forms of undress, negligees, sheer robes
Barbara exits a bathroom and bumps into Jacob, who fumbles seeing her half-nude; How's your pipe, kid
Camel leads the slack-jawed Jacob away
Night ladies
Night Camel
-    - Slightly more upscale and private quarters with a passenger aisle outside individual doors and windows
Hey Camel - who's that woman who works the horses
() Now stop right there
That's Marlena
She don't talk to nobody and you don't talk to her
And don't mention her to August
Ain't no right way to talk about somebody's wife and make it sound like a compliment
Wife
Camel takes this opportunity to drink some Jake and ask: Look, kid, before we do this, gotta ask
ain't tryin to know your business but  do know you ain't been on the road too long
You're too clean, your clothes too nice and you don't got a possession on you
See, a man on the road collects little things
It's not a big life  can tell ya
So before you start,  ask: if you got any kind of life to go back to, that's what you should do
21
Jacob stops
He tries to not sound emotional when he says: don't
Camel studies him, as if understanding what isn't said
am sorry to hear that
They move on
'    -    - They reach a platform facing the fanciest car yet
Standing upon it is an enormous, muscular  ,
This here's Earl
He's gonna take you in
Earl, this here's Jacob
(shakes hands w/Camel) don't know how to thank you
You may not want to after you been on a show long as  have
Good luck to ya, kid
Camel exits
Alone with Earl, Jacob asks: Do  look
Very nice
Then, with one hand Earl slides back the door and with the other hand, violently grabs Jacob by the neck and throws him head first into the car
'   -  - Jacob falls into Uncle August's opulent private car, with wood panelling, cushioned furniture and chandeliers
Sitting at a table playing cards are  the Barker, (menagerie and ring stock),
(talent booker),   (baggage stock) and, with his back to us in a high wing back chair, ()
22
Earl shoves him against the wall, dangling him off the floor
As August speaks to Jacob, all we see is the back of his head and smoke from his cigar as he plays cards throughout
What's this
That stowaway the old drunk took under his wing
College boy
Jacob tries to explain but Earl bangs him against the wall
(to the game) 'll see your three and raise you five
( ) don't believe 've had the pleasure
Jacob Jankowski, sir
And what is a "Jacob Jankowski" and why he is on my train
Just looking for work, sir
Can you fly
Set yourself on fire
No sir
Ever worked a show, son
No sir
Ever been to a show
Yes sir
Jacob, sensing where this is going, gets August's attention; 23
(') Ringling Brothers
August stops playing cards
The others react with sudden apprehension
Earl casually shakes his head to warn Jacob
August finally rises and turns to Camera: handsome, charismatic, fiercely intelligent
matinee idol looks that mask a darker nature
Ringling, you say
Yes
But it was terrible
Really
Have you seen our show
( ) What was your favorite act
Jacob sees a   with Marlena and her Horses
The uh
the one with the black and white horses
And the girl in pink
Ah, our Star Attraction
Well, believe we're looking for a boy to carry water for the elephants, aren't we Diamond Joe
We don't have an eleph- Shut-up
would do that, sir
'd like to work with the animals
August and the others chuckle
Jacob doesn't understand why
August crosses to Jacob, as he ridicules: And you'd carry water for elephants
Ha, ha
you have any idea how much water an elephant drinks, kid
College
Pfft
Never met a college man yet who knew his own ass from shinola
() 24
(') ( ) You eat my food and you ride my train like you're entitled to survive
But you see, nothing survives here without my permission
Maybe if you tell me you're nothing, 'll let you stay, although my bet is you won't last
Jacob refuses to let August demean him
He stays silent
(') You smell like every kind of shit
Why would a college boy want that
Times are hard for everybody
And guess because
out of all the dirt and sweat and shit and working with fellas you don't want to be caught dead meeting in the daylight, comes
so much beauty
We think August and the men are moved by Jacob's words
That's beautifully put
(:) Toss him off, Earl
And make sure you see the red light before you red light him
As Earl drags Jacob in tow, August derides him to the others; (') Another sonny boy mad at mommy and daddy for paying the bills
Sounds like he studied poetry
got no use for people who rhyme
(shouts as he is dragged) It was veterinary science
And can tell you one thing - that Star Attraction horse of yours won't be walking in a few days let alone performing center ring
August stops and turns
Earl wait
25
Earl stops with Jacob
Now all the men are intrigued
(') Veterinary science
(Earl stops with Jacob) May  ask what school
Cornell
() You're a Cornell graduate
Jacob lies and nods
August wonders whether to trust Jacob
Marlena did want a vet to take a look at Silver Star
They cost
He worked the rubes for me this afternoon
Pretty good
He shovelled horse shit
Don't make him a horse doctor
August looks reluctant
Until Jacob caps it: hear Ringling has its own vet
The other men can't believe Jacob spoke up like this
But it amuses August, who faces him and smiles; All right, Cornell
Come with me
August leads Jacob out
-    -  - August and Jacob exit onto the platform
Are you sure-footed, Jacob Jankowski
believe so
26
Good
Without missing a beat, August leans forward, catches hold of something around the side of the car and disappears
The train jerks a curve
Jacob almost falls
(
) Jacob looks up to see: August is on the roof of the train: his face moonlit, his hair blowing wildly in the wind
He points downward
Jacob, none too pleased, advances to the edge of the platform as the train speeds by, and looks where August is pointing; He can see the edge of a thin iron ladder
He wipes his hands on his thighs
Focuses
Then leaps
Jacob's right hand meets the ladder
His left grasps wildly until it ensnares the other side
His feet jam into the rungs
Jacob climbs to the roof
-    -  - August gives Jacob a hand up and they sit cross legged
; ,
It's a breath taking sight, isn't it
Always gets me
(:) can't get a new Liberty Horse mid- season
So you make sure this horse performs and the job's yours
Nine bucks a week
If you cross me, 'll feed you to my meat eaters and there won't be a trace left of you
Jacob hangs on every word
August smiles; () 27
(') You do right by me, Jacob Jankowski
'll show you what it's like to travel every inch of this country, every inch of this world, and be welcomed home in every street, be loved in every town
'll give you a life most suckers can't dream of
Jacob is mesmerized by August
August stands and tap dances across the roofs
Jacob has no choice but to follow
The two men dance and leap atop the train from car to car across the moving train
Jacob grows increasingly confident and euphoric following August's exultant lead
-    - August drops into the Ring Stock Car followed by Jacob
On one side is a line of Marlena's Black and White Show Horses
The other side, there is a makeshift door
August kicks through the door, revealing a small room; '  -    -  - This makeshift room is lit by a kerosene lamp on a crate next to a cot, propped up by a wall of trunks
"" () is reading on his cot
He has red hair
He and August greet each other with polite disgust
Kinko
() August
This is Jacob
He's going to bunk with you a while
How do you do
() What is he
said his name is Jacob
28
() asked what, not who
He's going to help out in the menagerie
() menagerie man
Performers don't bunk with working men
There's a growl from his loyal Russell terrier,
Well there are performers
(his hand indicates high ) And then there are performers
(his hand indicates lower "Kinko" standard) Considering we used to keep the goats in here, 'm sure Marlena's horses out there object to now sharing their quarters with you
Of course  can always change that and send you back to a bottom bunk with the other kinkers who sorely miss your sunny personality and affectionate camaraderie
(Kinko knows this threat) This gentleman is the show's new veterinarian - Ivy League no less - which puts him a good deal higher than you in my estimation
Perhaps you'd like to offer him your cot
As the kerosene lamp light flickers in August's face, Kinko knows he has no choice
August smiles and turns to leave
(') 'll find you in the morning
Sleep well, Cornell
August exits
Jacob is left staring at resentful Kinko and Queenie, who snarls at him
Jacob tries to be friendly: Jack Russell
They're very smart
() () Queenie attack
29
Queenie jumps at Jacob, growling, hunch backed
Jacob is pressed against the wall
Kinko returns to his book
() (') You're not getting the cot
- ,  -
Jacob is washing himself with dirty water out of a bucket beside Camel
Camel starts hitting his leg
He laughs: Ha, this gam of mine keeps falling asleep on me
Pretty soon the only place for me is going to be selling tickets but 'm too ugly for that
(
) Jacob
Camel straightens up when August appears, clearly on his guard
He turns his back to continue washing
(') We can do better than this for our new vet
'll arrange for you to start getting your own water bucket like the performers and bosses
Two buckets per person
Come
August walks away as Jacob hurries to follow
See ya Camel
(sips his Jake) Yeah, take care kid
'  - ,  -  - August and Jacob enter a more upscale tent where male performers are washing from personal buckets of water
You'll need new clothes too
'll set you up with the Monday Man
Monday Man
30
What day of the week did your mother hang out the wash to dry
() He takes other people's clothes
It's the Depression, Cornell
Where have you been
Oh right - Cornell
Kinko is bathing with his two buckets when August snatches one of them away
(') Here, use Kinko's second bucket for now
( ) You barely use up one
Kinko fumes
Jacob tries to placate
August, it's all right, 'll-- ( ) If you need a razor, there are some back there with my name on them
August walks away
Jacob follows August away from Kinko
August
When August stops, Jacob is caught off guard
() It's good to have an educated man like you around
need one other sane individual in this operation
() Thank you for everything, August
August pats his back and exits
Jacob heads for the bucket
(
) Ah
Jacob
31
() Yes, August
The horse
August wants Jacob to follow him to the horse
Jacob thought he was going to bathe
Oh
Yes
The horse
Jacob follows behind August's commanding stride
- ,  - Diamond Joe and , a ring stock man in overalls, are leading the Marlena's horses out of the ring stock car
'm sure it's nothing serious
Don't tell my wife  said this but she coddles them too much
She has a particularly strong affection for Silver Star
don't encourage it
It's unhealthy to love an animal that much
Here she is
Marlena runs up to them, still in her bed clothes/robe
(') Darling, meet Jacob Jankowski, Benzini Brothers own veterinarian
It's a pleasure to meet you
Marlena barely acknowledges Jacob - keeping their previous meeting a secret (for which Jacob is grateful)
August puts his arm around her and they kiss
Last stall
Lead the way, doc
They enter the ring stock car
32
-  - ,  - Jacob, Marlena and August arrive at the stall to see Silver Star is laying down
He is breathing heavily, his rib cage rising and falling
Jacob immediately senses the worst
Jesus, Marlena, he wasn't this bad in the show
Jacob moves to examine the horse, but he flinches in pain
Marlena takes over, by sitting besides Silver Star's head, and stroking his head while singing a soft lullaby
Jacob registers Marlena's soothing effect causes Silver Star to relax
his breathing grows calmer
So Jacob begins to examine him as Marlena watches protectively
Jacob runs his right hand down the leg to the fetlock
He lays his hand on the hoof then place his thumb and forefinger on the back of the fetlock
He looks at the sole of the hoof, which is bulging and dark with a red line around the edge
Jacob's expression tells us this is a bad sign
(') Is that the problem
( ) Do you need any hoof testers
Diamond Joe has them
Not yet
Well, how are you going to fix it
Marlena looks at him coolly, expecting an explanation
Jacob doesn't want to tell her the truth
Jacob looks to August and rises, leaving Marlena with the horse
Jacob pulls August away to whisper
didn't want to say anything in front of
Mrs
Rosenbluth
he's already foundering
English
33
This horse isn't getting back on his feet, August
If there was anything  could do,  would but we're going to have to put him down
'm real sorry
Beat
August's stares at Jacob - or rather, stares through him
dead stare that lasts just a beat or two too long
And then just as suddenly, the look is gone: know you are
Come with me
August exits
Jacob doesn't know what this means
He follows
- ,  - Flies buzzing on top
Diamond Joe finishes filling the buckets as August grabs one
Joe, bad report for Silver Star 'm afraid
Jacob here says there's no hope
We're going to have to put him down
Diamond Joe registers a concerned, anxious look to Jacob
(') So  need you to round up Pete and Greg, get a wagon and a harness stretcher
He has to be hauled
harness what
Jacob and 'll take care of the cats
We'll meet you back at the stall
( ) Grab the other bucket, will you
Diamond Joe seems uneasy about this as we follow August and Jacob, who comments on the putrid meat
August, this stuff has gone off
Do the cats really eat this
34
No, they really love goats
(Jacob looks to him) We're all out of goats
-   - ,  - Jacob waits with the buckets outside the car
August is inside unlocking the padlocks, then reappears and jumps out
Go ahead
They get a bucket each
Apprehensive, Jacob hops up
August hands him the buckets
-  - The cat dens have two compartments: to the left is a pair of lions
To the right, a tiger and a panther
All are massive
As soon as Jacob appears, they lift their heads ominously
August has unlocked the dens but left the padlock hanging on the cage bars
The animals can smell the buckets now
They growl
Jacob is a bit unhinged: What do  do, just open the door and toss it in
Unless you think a formal sit-down is appropriate
Jacob approaches the tiger first
The six hundred pound cat rises then roars, his massive head hitting the cage and rattling the lose padlock
Jacob freezes
(') Why don't you start with Rex
that's him on the left
August is pointing to one of the lions - with a ratty mane and visible rib cage
Smaller than the tiger, Jacob has a bit more nerve
He reaches for a bucket
August suddenly shouts, unnerving Jacob even more: (') ( ) Not that one, that one
35
He points to a difference bucket
Jacob can see no difference between them, but no matter
He lifts the bucket and approaches the lion's cage
Rex, the lion, lunges at the den door
Jacob freezes
(') What's the matter
Didn't they cover this in school
August is having a grand time
Jacob smirks
Rex is rubbing his mangy coat against the cage bars
Jacob fumbles, removing the padlock and laying it at his feet
He lifts the bucket and waits
When Rex turns away from the cage door, Jacob swings it open
But before he can spill out the contents of the bucket: Rex turns and chomps his huge jaw down on Jacob's arm The bucket drops, spilling the entrails inside which cause Rex to release Jacob's arm and attack the food
Jacob slams the cage shut and checks to see if he has an arm
He does but it is dripping with saliva and as red as if he'd dipped it in boiling water
But no skin is broken
August is hysterically laughing
Furious, Jacob storms off; What the hell is wrong with you
You think that's funny
() Yes  do
Aw Jacob wait
Don't be sore
was having a little fun
could have lost my arm
() Rex hasn't got any teeth
Jacob feels more foolish and walks away, when, just as quickly, August's tone of voice turns darker: (
) (') Jacob
Jacob stops and turns
August isn't laughing any more
He has that sniper's stare of August's darker side
August moves towards Jacob, almost menacingly, as he speaks; 36
(') people want their money back when the Star Act on the poster isn't in the ring
Star Attraction keeps a circus alive
Without it, animals eat that and men eat nothing
It takes time to find and train another horse so without Silver Star,  have no Star Act
don't know how he's been performing August, but you don't have a Star Act now
That horse can't walk and if he does you'll lose him
He's in a lot of pain
Like this
August squeezes Jacob's sore arm from Rex's attack
Jacob cries out in pain as August holds his grip yet speaks calmly; (') We always have choices, Jacob - a choice between our pain and someone else's
That horse was performing before you came and he will continue to perform until he drops dead
'm telling you to keep it alive and that's what you'll do or you'll be red lit like anyone else who doesn't obey the law here
Every nation has it's own laws under God, Jacob
You left America the second you jumped my train like you
Believe me,  do
'm only thinking of your future
August lets go of his arm and walks away
Jacob is angry
-  - Angry, Jacob inspects his arm - swollen and red from Rex's mouth
He hears:
murmuring coming from Silver Star's stall
He approaches to find Marlena sitting at Silver Star's head, stroking his nose and humming the lullaby
Marlena strokes Silver Star as Jacob appears
And Marlena speaks to him for the first time; 37
Tell me the truth
What's wrong with him
Jacob hesitates before answering, then: The connective tissues between the hoof and the coffin bone are compromised and the coffin bone rotates toward the sole of the hoof
If he keeps walking, it'll puncture through
He's in a lot of pain
And if he rests
You'll lose him anyway
'm sorry
Marlena breaths in this bad news and braces herself, tears welling up in her eyes
Then you have to put him down
Jacob is impressed by her
and a little surprised
It's the right thing to do
But August won't let you
(Beat
Then:) If 'm the show's vet then it's my decision, isn't it
But August won't like it
Then it'll be my last decision
Marlena is impressed by Jacob
And surprised
She doesn't quite know what to make of him
38
- ,  -   - determined, pent-up Jacob marches towards Bill and Grady who are taking a break, smoking
Camel is drinking Jake
Hey kid
What are you doing on the wrong side of the tracks
need a gun
It can't be that bad
They laugh but Jacob insists boldly
need a gun
Or a rifle
Now
Grady leans inside the open car door and gets him a rifle
Jacob takes it and marches back
They watch him, curiously
Jacob passes Blackie on the way and boldly ignores his intimidating stance
Performers and workmen sense a drama brewing and follow Jacob to see what is happening
-  - Jacob jumps into the Ring Stock car with the rifle as Kinko exits his room with Queenie
Queenie growls
What do you think you're doing
Shut-up
Both of you
Jacob continues on to Silver Star and Marlena
(') You should go
No
'll keep him calm
Jacob respects Marlena's fortitude
Jacob raises the rifle and aims, trembling
Stoic Marlena, tears in her eyes, turns her face away
Jacob pauses, upset
then
shoots
39
Jacob's distraught expression tells us everything as the rifle slides to his side
He looks to Marlena
This is their first moment of intimacy
She rises and takes the rifle from his grip
She sees his arm bruised from the cats
She seems to know what it means
She offers a respectful farewell
(') 'll be sorry to see you go, Mr
Jankowski
She exits
with the rifle
- ,  -  -
The yaks are motionless
Flies buzz around their head and ears
Jacob swats them away
The Polar Bear is on his stomach, breathing heavily
Jacob smooths his coat
Jacob leans down and hoists a bucket of ice, scattering the ice near the polar bear who rolls closer to it
Jacob sees Rex, lying on his side in his cage, panting with thirst
He brings a bucket of water to Rex's cage and opens it
Rex gets to his feet but this time Jacob doesn't flinch
He isn't frightened
He gives Rex the bucket of water
Rex drinks as Jacob strokes his mane, which Rex allows
Friends now
August calmly enters the menagerie with the rifle
He walks to the center and stops, staring at Jacob
Jacob goes about caring for the animals - moving from one to the next - trying not to be unnerved by August's presence
Then August does a surprising thing: He sits in the center of the menagerie, crossed legged, with the rifle beside him
You've got a gift for them
Like Marlena with horses
It's God- given
can always spot it
Jacob takes Bobo out of his den
Bobo hugs him tightly
He continues on as he replies; My father used to say that to me
He must have been a wise man
40
This stops Jacob
Beat
He turns to August
How is Marlena
August tilts his head curiously, with a smile
You're a genuine curiosity Jacob Jankowski
What am  to do with you
threaten to throw you off a moving train, feed you to my lions and you go ahead and shoot my star horse anyway
So  think - Jacob's an educated man
For Jacob to disobey me and shoot that horse, that horse must have been in pretty bad shape
Perhaps bad enough to injure my Marlena during the show
And so  think Jacob Jankowski might be a valuable person to have around
Tell Diamond Joe the animals need more water when the humidity's this bad if  don't see him before  go
You're not going anywhere
You belong here
These animals
they've been waiting for you
Jacob doesn't know whether to believe him or not
Then: (') But don't ever disobey me like that again
'll give you this one
'll call it "respect"
Next one  call "betrayal"
Understood
( ) do thank you though
You and Silver Star solved a much bigger problem for me
August pulls a pack of Camels from his pocket
What problem
August lights, inhales, blows smoke then: 41
The cats
You see, meat eaters are always more valuable to a circus than hay burners
And you saw what we had to feed them
What does Silver Star have to do with the cats
We should have just enough food for them to get us to the next show, thanks to you
Of course Marlena won't speak to me for a day or two but she'll come around
So,  was right
You are a valuable man
As he walks away, rifle over his arm, Jacob is unnerved; August, what did you do
August
'  -     - Queenie sleeps
Kinko reads comic book porn inside a book of Aristotle's Poetics
Jacob sits on his bed thinking
(
) couldn't stop thinking about Marlena
didn't see her for three days
Our shows were cancelled and we kept moving because, word was, August found a "dead one"
The train wheels screech as it begins to stop
Jacob rises and looks out of open train car doors
- ,  - The train is pulling into the site of a "ghost town" abandoned circus; a dilapidated Big Top, broken wagons and tents, desolate performers walking about idly or sitting in the shade
/
- ,  - As the train pulls into Goshen, performers stick their heads out the window to see
Jacob sits in the open stock car with Kinko and Queenie: 42
Why are we stopping
August loves his sideshow freaks
There's a guy with this outfit who has a parasitic twin growing out of his chest
He dresses it in a tiny tuxedo and black patent leather shoes
No talent but a real money- maker with the rubes
Calls himself the Man and a Half
Goddamn August'll pay him double what he pays me just for the irony
What happened to this circus
Went belly up
Pretty common nowadays
Circus bosses see the end coming and they'd pull a runner with all the money
Menagerie belongs to the town now
August can get anything he wants for a song
Jacob and Kinko watch August striding through the grounds as desperate performers hopeful for work rush up to him
(') Most of them will never belong to another show
And they know it
August is helped by Earl, who pushes the performers aside so August can head straight for the Goshen  , standing beside an Oldsmobile
They exchange greetings
- ,  - Crazy Joe is organizing the Flying Squadron to take whatever parts of the Fox Circus remains that they can use
Jacob is checking baggage stock horses when he sees: Marlena sitting alone outside her stateroom
He walks to her
Just as he reaches her, Marlena turns to him, looking as if she hadn't slept in days
Before they can speak, they hear: 43
-   - deliriously happy August is walking and holding the champagne, pouring glasses held by Earl who then hands one each to Marlena, Jacob, Diamond Joe and Crazy Joe as they all walk towards the Fox Bros
Menagerie Tent
We have a new star
The Man and a Half
Nah, lousy Ringling got here first
But we got better
bull
bull
bull elephant
Her name is Rosie, she's fifty-three and she's brilliant
The best bull they had
'm going to come up with a whole new Star Act around her and Marlena
( ) You can ride her in the Spec from now on, since we have no Liberty Horse
August smiles at Marlena who looks back contemptuously, upset about Silver Star
August ignores her
Jacob notices the exchange between them
(') (Pours himself a glass
) Our own bull
Ringling can't hold that over us now
'm renovating an entire car just for her
Just for the elephant
But the bunkers are at capacity
've got roustabouts three to a bunk
August tosses off this concern
44
We'll find places for everyone
And when our new star sells tickets, we'll buy another car
We're a show to be reckoned with now
() -   - : Dozens of Benzini Brothers work men are dismantling and taking what they need
As our characters walk through, this crowd of working men in constant motion part the way to reveal: : She is gargantuan
Ten feet tall at the shoulder
Her skin is mottled and cracked from the tip of her trunk down to her feet
Only her ears are smooth
She has deeply set, amber eyes with extremely long lashes
She stands tall behind a rope, chained to a stake in the ground
Jacob, Marlena, August, Diamond Joe and Greg observe her
She has such long eye lashes
She's a hundred if she's a day
We're lucky if she can move
Darling, what do you think
She's magnificent, isn't she
Marlena keeps her rage silent, but it is all the more potent
August decides to ignore it
Jacob keeps his eyes on Rosie but feels the tension between them
'  approaches: filthy shirt behind suspenders
' You the bull man
No
(Refers to Diamond Joe) This is my menagerie man
45
' Where's your bull man
Ya got no bull man,  gotta tell the township or else they can't sell her to ya
August grabs Jacob's arm and shoves him forward; Here he is
He's my bull man
Rosie's Caretaker looks at the surprised Jacob, then: ' All right
See this animal
this here's the stupidest Goddamn animal on the face of God's good earth
Here's your bull hook
You're gonna need it
He tosses    - a wooden rod about three feet long with a four inch metal pick coming off the end - to Jacob
don't believe it
The mayor said she was the best bull you had
' If she was the best bull, why is she the only one left
You think you're the first show to turn up picking on the bones
August is annoyed
As the Caretaker gathers his things: '  (') Some elephant tramp who dropped dead in Genesee sold her for a song which still ain't no bargain cause she ain't done a damn thing since but eat everything in sight
(Starts to walk away) Well, good luck to ya
And if don't ever see another dumb bull in my life it'll be too soon
() Rosie pulls her trunk from the trough
She lifts, aims, and blasts the Caretaker with such a force, his hat sails off his head in a stream of water
Jacob, August, Diamond Joe and Greg bite their lips from laughing
Marlena just stares into Rosie's eyes
46
The Caretaker stops, his hair and clothes dripping
He doesn't turn, just stands still for a moment - then moves on
August's enthusiasm is slightly dampened
Joe, you and Greg come with me
We have to find a car to renovate
( ) See what you can do with her
They exit
Jacob and Marlena are left alone with Rosie as Flying Squadron men continue to work in the tent
There is an awkward pause between them
then: Mrs
Rosenbluth,  hope 'm not speaking out of turn here but - but had no idea they were going to do that to Silver Star
know
Thank you
This relaxes Jacob, but he senses she is still sad
(') And please, call me Marlena
'm not a snob like everybody thinks
Jacob smiles
He faces Rosie and tries to cheer Marlena up
Hello Rosie, 'm Jacob Jankowski
This is Mrs
Marlena Rosenbluth
Can you say Mrs
Marlena Rosenbluth
Marlena smiles as she watches Jacob stroke Rosie's hide
(') You're a beauty, huh
Skin's a little dry, you oughta take care of that
First thing you notice about a woman's age is her skin
Rosie lifts her trunk and begins to explore Jacob's body
Marlena giggles
Jacob plays it up to make her laugh
(') Are you flirting with me young lady
usually like to make the first move
() 47
(') (Her trunk taps his head) like to get to know a girl first
take her out
Meet her folks
(Her trunk goes lower) Of course, aggressive women can be a nice change
(She tickles him) Jacob and Marlena laugh, her mood lightened because of Jacob
think you two are engaged
They laugh
Jacob is thrilled to have this effect on Marlena
in the distance
They turn towards the sound and see that the two of them are alone in the tent
All the workmen have left
Jacob and Marlena turn back to Rosie who stands between them
There is a awkward, lovely moment of intimacy between the three as Marlena strokes Rosie's trunk
Her hand and Jacob's come very close to overlapping
When their eyes meet, one of them quickly averts their glance
There is clearly a growing attraction between them
But it's uncomfortable
(') think Rosie likes music
That harmonica song is lovely
'm confessin that  love you
Marlena stops, her face flushed by Jacob's "confession"
What
The name of the song
"'m Confessin' That  Love You
" (overlaps, realizing) --"Confessin' that  love you
" Beat
Jacob tries not to laugh
They return to stroking Rosie, trying not to look at each other
Louis Armstrong
Right

'  - ,  -
Jacob enters
Kinko is on his bed reading his "Aristotle" but quickly shuts the book
Queenie growls at Jacob
Queenie stop
Queenie stops
Kinko returns to his book
Jacob sees a , upon which sits a
He reads it: "
& 3,  48,
Jacob looks up to find Kinko staring at him
What is it
It's trouble, that's what
Not that give a damn, but you're playing with dynamite with those two and you're gonna blow all of us up
August is the meanest sonofabitch 've ever met
admit he has his moments of insanity but he's really a very generous, charming guy
You don't get it, do you
When August feeds your arm to a lion - that's the real August
The one who's generous and charming - that's the insane August
They hear a fight outside the car
They move to investigate: /
-  -
Jacob and Kinko look out of the open ring stock car to see: August is standing before   who is being held by Blackie's Men and punched by Blackie himself
The Man is bleeding and bruised
Various other performers and working men also watch the brutality; 49
Six men got red lit last night
Cancelling shows and that damn elephant cost August
He needed to clean house to save on payroll
It's a lousy day when an animal gets paid and men don't
Why are they beating him
He hid one of the men who was supposed to be tossed
Word was the train was over a trestle instead of land
Nobody comes back from that
: Get rid of him
He comes back on my property, you can shoot him
August walks away, with Earl and his men in tow
Blackie and his men drag the beaten Man away
As they turn, Jacob recognizes the Man; It is  who worked Jacob on his first day
- ,  - August, wearing a tuxedo, opens the door on the platform
Come in, come in
Jacob enters their Stateroom which takes up half the car, with an additional room, cordoned off by a velvet curtain
The main room is paneled in walnut and outfitted with damask furniture, a dinette and a Pullman kitchen
(') Darling, our guest has arrived
Jacob's eyes go wide upon seeing Marlena who appears looking radiant in a rose silk, off the shoulder evening dress
'm so glad you could come
Would you like a beer
Or champagne
50
'm not dressed for champagne
We can fix that, can't we darling
August winks at Marlena who giggles at their secret as August ushers Jacob to the velvet curtain
(') We're celebrating our new star, Rosie
My plan is to have the act ready for the Manhattan/Jersey show so she can start selling tickets
() Unfortunately we had to let some men go last night
Jacob listens to how August will explain this: (') don't like doing it, not one bit
But to keep hard working men working,  had to get rid of lay- abouts and thieves who are dead weight
If  had the funds to pay them all  would, but times being as they are
regret it though
Jacob believes him
August turns to him, with cheer: (') So tomorrow, my faithful bull man, we begin
But tonight - we dine
Tonight, we all deserve champagne
August whisks the velvet curtain aside: (') Ta-dah
tuxedo for Jacob, who smiles, impressed
: ' : - Three white-gloved waiters remove the domes off of silver platters revealing oyster bisque, prime rib, boiled potatoes, asparagus in cream
- Marlena's dress barely covers her shoulders, exposing her porcelain skin and the curves of her breasts
Jacob can barely keep his eyes off of her during dinner
51
- Jacob is wiping his plate clean as August proudly offers more
Marlena laughs at Jacob's embarrassment when he realizes his plate is clean
- Wine is poured over and over
as the evening continues
- August is at the center of conversation entertaining Marlena and Jacob
They are drunk from the wine
(') Jacob,  want to apologize to you, in front of my darling Marlena so she can witness how truly sorry am for any bit of nastiness between us
Running this show, the many pressures
It can get the best of me sometimes 'm afraid
People don't realize how much August does holding everything together
How difficult it is in these times
The whole company is like a family to him
Thank you my love
He kisses her hand then turns to Jacob; (') From now on  shall trust your judgement in all things veterinarian
Please say you accept my apology
Jacob is enamoured with August again, especially seeing Marlena smiling in agreement
Of course  do, August
You've been nothing but swell to me
Good man
() could truly use a friend  can trust
Jacob once again beams at the compliment as August pours more wine
But Jacob feels a twinge of guilt
He stands to make a dramatic statement
August and Marlena look up to him
52
have to tell you something
You may not trust me after you hear it
August and Marlena pause - giving Jacob their attention
(') never took my final exams at Cornell
'm not a real vet
Beat
Then August and Marlena burst into laughter at the dire earnestness with which Jacob made his statement
(') But it's true
never got my degree
'm not a licensed vet
They laugh even harder
worthless piece of paper from the ivy bush league
Of course you're a vet
You have the gift
You're idealism is just so
sweet
When are you going to learn that the rules written of, by and for these united states of suckers do not apply to us
Not about this, August
All right, let me ask you - do you honestly think this is the most spectacular show on earth
(Beat
Then laughs) No
No
It's nowhere near
Lucinda, our Fat Lady, isn't 800 pounds
Four at the tops
And you really think the Tattooed Man got tattooed by headhunters in Borneo
He's from Pittsburgh
Took him nine years to ink himself
And you know what did when the hippo died
Swapped out her water for formaldehyde and kept showing her
For two weeks, we travelled with a pickled hippo
() 53
(') (Jacob & Marlena laugh) The world is run on tricks - in here and out there
So trust me, it's having a talent that counts
In this world, it's all that's real
Look at this country, these dead, God awful towns we play
Talent and illusion bringing life to what is dead
Even for just a matinee
How wonderful is that
Jacob believes he's right
Marlena smiles in agreement
August rises to toast
Jacob and Marlena follow
(') To talent and illusion
To Rosie
And Silver Star
August takes a beat and smiles warmly at Marlena
To all we love
He leans over and kisses Marlena longer than appropriate in front of a guest
Jacob downs his wine, closing his eyes
Suddenly, August grabs Jacob and Marlena and pulls them up to dance, throwing his arm around them both as we hear: Louis Armstrong's
August starts singing along, imitating Satchmo's voice, encouraging Jacob to join in
August is a great performer, filling up the space with his impersonation
Jacob can only laugh along
(') Come on Jacob
It's customary to sing for your supper
Jacob joins in to perform with August
Marlena applauds them
August breaks away to dance with Marlena as Jacob sings
They begin to slow dance, very intimately
Jacob gives up singing and plops himself on an upholstered chair, drinking more champagne
Jacob watches them dance: 54
(
) He looked like a different man when he looked at her
said to myself, maybe love does that to a man didn't know much about it
Suddenly, August kisses Marlena - a bit too aggressively
Darling
Darling, please
() Gently
We have a guest
August stares at her
His expression darkens - locking his eyes on Marlena and tilting his head as if he is examining her
Marlena smiles and strokes his face
August doesn't respond
He remains intense
(') Darling, what is it
August takes her face by the chin and tilts it with complete control, as if searching for proof of something he can't trust
His grip tightens, hurting her
Alerted, Jacob sits up, prepared to intervene
But Marlena shows no sign of fear
She knows exactly what to do
(') August, dear
She manages to moves his hand to her mouth and kisses it
(') You don't know your own strength, my love
And then, just as quickly, August's expression softens, relaxes, almost into sadness
as if he's about to cry
Marlena senses it immediately
She whispers lovingly
(') Auggie
August stops and eyes the bed beyond them
He leaves Marlena and throws himself face first on the bed
(') Excuse me, Jacob
Jacob watches as Marlena attends to August, lifting his legs onto the bed, taking off his shoes
August begins snoring
55
Marlena smooths the hair out of his face then closes the curtains and returns to Jacob in the main room
Is everything all right
Marlena puts a finger to lip and keeps it there, as she returns to her Victrola and selects another record
She cranks it on and plays it low
Oh yes
He's just had too much to drink, that's all
hope you had a good time tonight
wanted so much to make things up to you
Tonight was your idea
Oh Auggie wanted it too, he felt horrible about what happened
He really does like you Jacob
But it's hard for him
He's under a lot of pressure
He does more than people realize holding things together
You said that
Well it's true
(Opens her arms to him
) One dance before you go
Jacob cautiously approaches
Marlena takes his hands but when Jacob presses closely against her and places his hand against her bare back, he almost swoons
They slow dance
Both tipsy
(') Jankowski is Polish isn't it
() Is that all right
() Yes, of course, sorry
just think it's interesting
don't know what  am, besides August's wife
grew up in foster homes since  was a baby
() 56
(') Kentucky, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas
must have covered a dozen states by the time  was 17
'd make up stories about who my parents were
() When  was five,  pretended for a whole year my mother was an Appaloosa mare
They both laugh
(') did
and  pretended that was really an Appaloosa filly
and that  was just dreaming  was a girl and one day, 'd wake up
and 'd run home
() Anyway,  was a lot safer inside those stables than  ever was inside those homes
Marlena stops, not wanting to continue
Jacob finds a new route for her conversation
What happened at 17
There was a parade for the circus
At the head, there were six black Fresians, 17 hands high wearing red tassles
So proud
So beautiful
And August was leading them
The second he looked at me, the way he looked at me,  knew 'd never live with strangers again
And the way he talked
Told me "'d find a home in every city
welcomed in every town
and he'd give me-- / -- a life most suckers can't dream of"
() Ha, you too, huh
( ) It's a wonderful lie, isn't it
( ) () 57
(') But he said he'd make me a Star Attraction and he did
'm pretty lucky he found me
Jacob, lost in her eyes and her voice, blurts out: He was pretty lucky to find you
Marlena is surprised by the compliment
and endeared
You're sweet to say so
Beat
Feeling exposed, Jacob searches to change the subject: Pretty song
Don't tell him what happened
Jacob takes this as an intimate moment between them
Oh no Marlena,  won't ever tell
Marlena smiles, laughs, using Jacob's joke back on him; That's the name of the song
"Don't Tell Him What Happened To Me"
Ruth Etting
She's one of my favorites
Jacob's head starts spinning
Marlena takes care of him; (') Are you much of a wine drinker
have no idea
Maybe you should go to bed
() Where's that
Marlena laughs
Jacob's bow tie is undone - she ties it; 58
Here, let me
We can't let you go out there all untied
circus is a small town
What will people say
As Marlena ties his tie, Jacob's eyes simply rest on Marlena's face - sinking deeper in love
When Marlena finishes, she looks up to Jacob
She can tell Jacob is enamoured
She smiles warmly, touching his cheek
(') Sweet, sweet Jacob
( ) 'm not that sweet
(Lowers her hand) Good night
Marlena turns and disappears behind the velvet curtain
Jacob stands still for a moment, then exits
-  - ,  - drunk Jacob sees the ring stock car door open, filled with people's legs hanging out and loud voices from within
-  - ,  - Jacob hops up into the car
Kinko is giving a party, with a bottle in his hand and drunken hospitality on his face
Thirty performers cram the area usually occupied by Marlena's horses, including  and another Coochie girl,
Kinko and Queenie are performing tricks
Jacob watches
He admires the talent and humor of Kinko and Queenie's act
At the end, the girls laugh and applaud
Jacob joins in: But the sound of Jacob's voice immediately makes Queenie stop and growl at him
Jacob stops
Kinko, Barbara and the Coochie girls stop laughing and stare the drunken young man, with his shirt out of his pants
He is ripe for the picking
They get an idea
59
Folks, this is my friend and roommate Jacob
'd like you all to make him feel at home
Kinko starts laughing uncontrollably and before Jacob can protest or escape, Barbara and Nell approach him, moving in for the kill
Blurry-eyed, Jacob staggers back but the others refuse to let him leave
In fact, he is picked up bodily, raised above their heads and transported to Silver Star's empty stall as Barbara and Nell disrobe him
/   -   - Kinko opens the lid of a trunk, speaking to someone inside; (
) Where am
Kinko moves about a car filled with racks of costumes, props and an open trunk containing the hidden Jacob
Where are you right now or where are you in an Aristotelean context because right now you're in a trunk
Inside the trunk,
Jacob lifts his arm to Camera and discovers he is dressed in a red silk dressing gown
(
) Where are my clothes
'm not wearing anything underneath this--- (:) Huh-huh
As Jacob struggles out of the trunk, we only see his arms
(
) What the hell did  do last night
You threw up on Barbara
And maybe Nell
60
(
) feel sick
You look a little pale
Kinko holds the mirror to Jacob
We see for the first time: '
-  - Jacob races through each car - past musicians, clowns and the Coochie Girls - clutching his robe, rubbing the make-up off
Along the way, the circus company taunt and tease him with sexy hoots and hollers
Kinko follows him, delighted
'  -  ,  - Having cleaned up, Jacob is dressing in his own clothes
Kinko sits on his cot "reading Shakespeare" with a melancholy Queenie at his side
When Jacob scratches his shaven balls
Your balls itchy
Pissed off, Jacob continues to dress
It'll grow back
Aw come on, you still store about last night
Now figure we're even
In fact, probably owe you one
Feel free to borrow a book
Let's just drop it
Kinko opens a book to read
Jacob notices Queenie's quiet
(') What's wrong with Queenie
What do you mean "wrong"
61
mean she's not hating me
Something's wrong
(Concerned, pets her) Yeah, she's been like this all day
don't know
she must have eaten something
She did her business and it was kind of
watery
Her stool
Did you look at it for parasites
( ) don't like looking at my own
Get some honey from the cookhouse
And if you can find any slippery elm powder
But the honey should do it
If not, we'll check her for parasites
Jacob starts to exit
As Kinko reads his book; Jacob
( ) Thanks
Sure Kinko
He moves to exit again
Kinko never looks up from book; Jacob
Yeah
My real name's Walter
They never look at each other but a friendship is formed
Jacob exits
62
-   - When Jacob hops out, he sees performers and roustabouts all gathered by a performer train car, huddling and discussing
He crosses to investigate, meeting up with August Diamond Joe and Mr
Erwin
We got big trouble
Lucinda died
Now we've got no center ring star act and no sideshow star
How did she die
don't know where we're gonna find a fat lady this late in the season
don't care where you find one, but find one
(To Diamond Joe) Better get some kind of rig set up to lift her out of the car
How did you carry Silver Star out
In pieces
Oh yes
(considers for a second) Mmmm
August
No, no, of course, don't be silly
Right
Well, figure something else out Joe but get it down for the performance
Put her in the hippo tank for now
( ) You better start on that elephant
We need her performing yesterday
63
'   - Out of the darkness of her car, the enormous elephant emerges, being led down a ramp by Jacob
-  ,  - Jacob - cleaned, dressed and hung over - sits crossed legged in front of Rosie
The two stare at each other
Rosie's nose searching the ground for something to eat
Jacob, without energy or focus, his head pounding, orders her; Rosie
Up
Rosie just looks at him without moving
(') Up
Rosie
Up
Rosie's trunk starts to sniff around Jacob
(') Rosie
Walk
Rosie
Rosie's trunk investigates Jacob's body, tapping his head
(') Rosie please
My hair hurts
Rosie's trunk snakes around him
(') No
No more Cracker Jack until you do something
Rosie
Rosie curls her trunk around Jacob and slowly topples him sideways, turning him over as he weakly threatens; (') 'm getting really mad now mean it
Rosie stop
Rosie gets the Cracker Jack from his back pocket
(
) You just can't get enough of somebody in your pants, can you
Jacob quickly gets up as August strides towards him; 64
(
(') Heard you had a rough night
Does everybody know what happened
Yes
Can somebody tell me
August suppresses a laugh
'm opening the midway and the menagerie this afternoon for some extra cash before the show tomorrow night
We'll see how she does with the crowd
She got any skills
Finding food
But  don't really know how to do this
Well, first of all, you can't do anything with a bull without the bull hook
August takes the   from the ground
(') It's the only way to train them
Watch
Jacob steps back
(') August stabs Rosie behind the shoulder
Jacob winces
Rosie lifts her foot a little
(') August keeps jabbing her with the hook
dotting her flesh with blood
Jacob gets upset
August, there's got to be another way
65
We don't have the time
She has to start earning her keep
August stabs her other shoulder
harder
continuing to shout
Rosie is getting agitated
pulling away from him but constrained by her chain
Her eyes fearful
Other performers rehearsing in the area begin to watch as August strikes Rosie harder and harder
She begins to bleed
Jacob tries to stop August by going for the bull hook
Please, August, let me try again
But August angrily pulls it away and turns on Jacob: Don't tell me my business
You don't want to watch this, get the hell out
Making love to it ain't going to work
Besides, from what hear, you're not that good at it
( ) Jacob watches, upset and furious at August's treatment
-  ,  - Rosie's flesh is dotted with wounds from August's bull hook
Jacob is applying zinc ointment to them
'm so sorry girl
Just a few more here
Hold still
The un-staked canvas flaps behind Rosie wave up with the breeze
Rosie's trunk rises
She smells something from outside the tent
When Jacob bends down for more ointment, Rosie tries to turn around but her chain is still staked into the ground
As Jacob straightens up, he sees: Rosie's trunk carefully wrap itself around the stake and pull it up out of the ground
She then manages to turn herself around, her butt to Jacob
Rosie's trunk then dives down and up under the canvas flaps
66
(') Rosie
/ -   -  - , which is in the process of being dismantled
Work men are carrying items back to the train
: Rosie's trunk come out from under the canvas, her body hidden, searching for the lemonade
Jacob peers out to see: Rosie's trunk dip itself into the vat of lemonade and drink the entire contents
Jacob is amazed
He looks around: Workmen are some distance away loading the train
No one else sees her
Rosie finishes then turns back into the menagerie
-  ,  -  -
Rosie's trunk gathers up the stake and then stakes it back into the ground
Jacob can't believe his eyes
He laughs
-   T0   - As the train travels to Weekhawken, New Jersey
Jacob is looking out of open car to  skyline across the river
(
) We were on our way to the Manhattan/ Jersey show and Mr
Erwin still hadn't found a fat lady
Tickets sales were low
So August, ha,ha
August pulled a hat trick
- ,
- August is sitting atop Rosie, smiling, waving his top hat, then forlornly placing it against his chest and lowering his head in respect for Lucinda
Manhattan is in the distance
67
(
) parade like you never saw, a funeral and a celebration, saying goodbye to one star, introducing a new one
playing those rubes dying to get a peek like he was rolling a coin over his finger tips
Rosie leads a small parade of clowns, including Walter and a perky, healthy Queenie down the main street
Marlena sits atop a Percheron, in full costume
Jacob walks astride
Lucinda's Wagon, carrying "the dead Lucinda", follows
(
) (') It wasn't really Lucinda in there
It was Barbara in a fat suit and wig inside the hippo den
We buried the real Lucinda by the railroad tracks between towns
Cemeteries cost too much
We were the only family she knew
People line up to cheer and offer their silent respects
and satisfy a ghoulish fascination at the "dead" fat lady
(
) (') August sure was right about Rosie
She pulled the people right in
Rosie played that crowd like a pro
The rubes love the exotic Rosie
kids run up to pet her with their parents
As Rosie passes, we see    standing in front of her green shuttered house waving with delight
We see she has a abundant vegetable garden which Rosie eyes covertly
-    - ,  - : The Band playing from inside the Big Top as the performers and ring stock are lined up for the Grand Spec
But as soon as the Spec started, we all knew it was too soon for Rosie's debut
Rosie heads the line
Marlena sits atop her, in her sequins and headdress, grabbing onto Rosie's leather halter
68
August stands beside with the bull hook
His face is cold and still
His fingers clutch and release the bull hook
The   begins and everyone makes last minute adjustments
Kinko and Queenie included
August shouts into Rosie's ear
Rosie hesitates so August strikes her right shoulder with the bull hook
The pain sends Rosie flying through the Big Top flap, causing Marlena to adeptly flatten her back atop Rosie so as not to hit her head on the pole that runs across the Big Top flap
Others gasp at the near accident
August is already furious
Jacob senses danger ahead
He follows in, curling the edge of the sidewall so as not to impede the Spec performers
- ,  -  - Jacob watches as Rosie makes it twenty feet down the hippodrome track then stops
Without missing a beat, Marlena yanks herself upright, beams a smile and thrusts her hands in the air, her back arched, her toes pointed - as if it were all a part of the act
The crowd goes wild - clapping, throwing peanuts, whistling
Rosie only moves in fits and starts, causing the rest of the Spec to pass them by at times
She trots ahead of August and then when August reaches her she stops, making August halt awkwardly
August feels humiliated until: The crowd laughs, thinking it's the act
They applaud
August realizes the crowd loves it
So August, the performer, starts to play the infuriated fool to the audience, acting comically angry and frustrated with Rosie
But when he turns back to Rosie, he is red-faced with real anger, poking under her shoulders with the bull hook
After three stops and starts, August plunges the bull hook sharply into her shoulder blade
and Rosie takes off at a faster speed, curling her trunk in the air
The crowd cheers
69
Marlena grasps Rosie's halter as they fast approach the dangerous pole above the entrance
If Marlena doesn't bail, she'll be knocked off by the pole
Jacob, August, the Spec and the audience watch enthralled as Rosie charges toward the entrance
when suddenly: Marlena lets go of the halter and leans hard to the left
Just as Rosie bolts out of the Big Top, Marlena grabs hold of the pole above the entrance and is left hanging there as Rosie exits the Big Top
For a moment, the audience doesn't know if this is part of the act
Jacob wants to run to help her
But Marlena quickly decides what to do; She lets go of the pole with her left hand and quickly swings around so she is facing the audience, still hanging from the pole
Her face lights up and she points to her toes
The Band Leader takes this as a signal and conducts the band into a drum roll
The crowd relaxes and applauds
Marlena begins swinging, gaining momentum as the band roll mounts
Soon, in one final burst of performance inspiration, she releases herself from the pole, sails through the air tucking her body into a ball, rolling twice, uncurling for one sideways rotation and lands firmly in the sawdust in her feet
She straightens up and thrusts her arms in the air
The crowd goes wild
The Band plays victory music
Coins are thrown from the bleachers
Even the Spec performers cheer
August acknowledges the audience's response by bowing as if it were all his creation
But after a moment, Jacob can see Marlena is in pain as she turns and subtly limps out of the Big Top
He follows her
-   - Jacob rushes to her
Marlena, in pain, collapses in his arms
Oh Jacob
August rushes out and is stopped cold by the sight of Marlena in Jacob's arms
He immediately tenses up
August, she's hurt
August takes her in his arms
Barbara appears to help
70
'm here, darling, 've got you
Bring her to my tent, it's closer
Jacob, send Joe for ice
You go and find that Goddamn bull before we're run out town
And take the hook
August is seething, his expression cold, as he carries Marlena
Jacob, concerned, takes the hook and runs
'    -  - Rosie is standing in a vegetable garden calmly feeding herself cabbages
The owner is the   who was delighted by Rosie in the parade
She is now screaming hitting her with a small garden shovel
Jacob runs up
'm sorry ma'am
'll get her
You better before she gets at my -- ,
Rosie has helped herself to tomatoes
Jacob steps in
Rosie, no
Stop
Rosie pauses for a moment, flapping her ears at Jacob, then shoves a bush of tomatoes in her mouth
Jacob almost laughs
(') Bad elephant, that's not nice
This kind lady hasn't invited you
'
She exits into the house as Rosie wraps her trunk around cabbages, uprooting them, as Jacob tries to battle her trunk
Greg arrives with a bucket he places in front of Rosie
Her trunk stops fighting Jacob and sniffs inside the bucket
71
What's in the bucket
Gin and ginger ale
Elephants love booze
One whiff of this and she's not thinking about cabbages no more
(Bats her trunk away) moj malutki paczuszek
Greg, right
Are you Polish
Grabowski
Jankowski
Greg again pushes Rosie's trunk away from the bucket
Last show  worked, one bull faked a belly ache just to get the whiskey
Better grab the hook
Are you a bull man
August would hire you in a minute
Don't want the job
Not for him
Besides, 'm not bull man
just like big beasts
Jacob gets it and follows Greg who carries the bucket
(') Is she following
Jacob turns around to see and sure enough: Rosie is leaving the garden and trotting behind to catch up to the bucket of gin and ginger ale
Jacob's impressed
- ,  - The show is still in progress - we can hear the band playing for the aerialist act in the background
72
As Jacob makes his way to Marlena's stateroom he crosses paths with August, whose face is "dark as thunder"
How's Marlena
little shaky
Sore wrists
Bruised heel
Doc says she'll be fine
Did you catch the bull
She's in the menagerie
Good
August takes the bull hook from Jacob and walks with cold blooded intent towards the menagerie
Jacob panics, realizing what August about to do
Jacob follows to stop him; August
Wait
She was good
She came back on her own
Besides, you can't do anything now
The show is still going on
() Good
The band will drown it out
,
Jacob touches August's arm
August turns on Jacob with a murderous expression, shoving him to the ground
Jacob is about to get up to fight but August cautions him with the bull hook to stay down
August smiles slightly
Would he really use that bull hook on Jacob or is he kidding
Jacob stays down
August continues on, entering the menagerie tent
(
) Jacob
Jacob sees Marlena running towards him
-  -  - Jacob and Marlena run across the grounds to the menagerie as workmen are running out of the menagerie tent, hearing August screaming from inside
They enter the menagerie tent to see: 73
-  -  - August is beating Rosie, who cries out with each blow
The animals are panicking from inside their cages - the lions roaring, the monkey's squealing
Marlena freezes at the entrance as Jacob runs to August
August turns to see her
Enraged, he stops Jacob with: Get her out of here
Jacob wants to help Rosie but can not disobey August in this moment
He returns to Marlena and ushers her out, as August continues to beat Rosie
-  -  - Marlena and Jacob step away, hearing Rosie cry out
Marlena can't bear it
She grabs Jacob's hand for support
Jacob tentatively holds onto her waist, guiding her away
She leans into him
Jacob loves being this close to her
The screams of August
pull their attention to see: Earl and his men physically dragging a maniacal August out of the tent, his bull hook and clothes bloodied by his rage
He is kicking and struggling against them like a madman
Jacob is shocked by August's behavior
But Marlena has seen it before
She pulls away from Jacob and exits
alone
- ,  - Rosie is lying on her side, her foot still chained to the stake
She is quivering, riddled with bloodied holes
Jacob is kneeling, applying zinc ointment, not knowing where he can touch that won't hurt her
He is heart broken
Rosie, what am  going to do with you
Rosie's eyes look up to him, her lashes blinking
Her trunk lifts and wipes at her own eye
74
Greg appears with a bucket and several bottles of whiskey
He begins pouring whiskey bottles into a bucket
Here this will help
Poor beast
He really hurt her
Told you about him
(Curses August in ) Don't understand why a man like that wants to be around animals in the first place
He shouldn't have the right, if you ask me
Listening to Greg, Jacob gets increasingly angry
He sees the bull hook
He grabs it and marches out of the menagerie
-  - ,  - Earl's men are smoking, when one sees Jacob marching angrily towards August's stateroom, carrying the bull hook
Alerted; ' Somebody better find Earl
-  - Jacob reaches the platform to find the door ajar
He moves through it
The stateroom is in a shambles
An open suitcase of women's clothes lies strewn across the floor
(
) Marlena
August appears from behind the curtain ; he looks uncharacteristically distraught
teary eyed and unkempt
(') Do you know where Marlena is
Did she send you
No
What happened
She won't speak to me
He can't finish
He sits, burying his head in his hands
(') She won't let me apologize
She won't forgive me
75
Jacob is astounded by August's sad, pitiable state
(') don't know what happens to me, Jacob
When  saw that bull running wild with Marlena,
lost my mind
But it's because  love her
Why can't she understand that
(Jacob stands coldly) Isn't there anyone who understands
(Jacob remains silent) Ah, it's all my fault,  know it is
've spent too much money on that bull
can't pay the workmen
Our debts are piling
We're losing attendance at every show
have no Star Attraction
don't know what's going to happen to us if Rosie doesn't sell tickets
() If  lose this circus, 'll lose Marlena -  know it
Jacob softens, seeing August in this helpless, humble light
'm sure that's not true
Maybe you can talk to her
She's tired of my apologies but, this pressure 'm under
Of course, that's no excuse for what  did
(Rubs the images away) can't believe what  did
Is she all right
The bull
Rosie
She'll be
Would you tell Marlena
And tell her
tell her 'll do anything
Anything she wants
August,  can't
() 'm sure she'll forgive you
She loves you
Anyone can see that
August wants to believe him
He seems more hopeful
76
Thank you
My friend
Jacob nods, confused, his anger diffused
As he exits; (') Jacob
Jacob stops and turns back as August asks: (') What were you planning to do with that bull hook
Jacob realizes he's holding the bull hook
August smiles
(') Ha
You look like me
Jacob looks in the mirror and indeed - with Rosie's blood on his open shirt, bull hook in hand - he looks like a violent man
(') Maybe there is someone who understands me
August smiles
But Jacob is unnerved by the smile
and the comparison
Suddenly, Earl enters and looks around, on alert; What's going on
Everything's fine, Earl
August nods to Jacob, who pushes past Earl to exit
-  - ,  - Jacob jumps down off the platform
Confused and disgusted, he takes the bull hook, wedges it under the train and breaks it in half
- ,  -   - Jacob enters to find Greg still treating Rosie
How's she doing
77
Oh she's a strong one, this one
( ) Jestes dobra dziewczynka Jacob watches as Rosie lifts her foot and Greg rubs ointment
Jacob sees the many empty whiskey bottles
Is she drunk
() She's four tons
she'll just sleep good
(Screwing ointment top) Potoz noge
Jacob watches as Rosie puts her foot back on the ground
(') Masz, moja piekna Jacob watches as Greg digs in his pocket and pulls out a mint, brushing off the lint
Rosie's trunk investigates, then nimbly plucks it out of his hand and into her mouth
,
Oh my God
- ,  - An excited Jacob is leading August to the menagerie tent
-  - Jacob leads August to Rosie
curious Greg stops tending to Rosie
Jacob hands August a slip of paper with Polish words
Just read those out loud
To Rosie
August reads the words in Polish with Jacob's help
Rosie
da--da--- Daj
78
Daj
daj
no-ge
Rosie does nothing
August looks to Jacob
Jacob is worried
Greg suggests, in a low whisper; Might help if he said please
Say
Prosze Rosie daj noge
Pros--Prozze Rosie
daj noge
Rosie lifts her foot
August's eyes gleam
Go on
(Reads and recites) Rosie
potoz noge
Rosie puts her foot down
August starts to understand
(') (Reads and recites) Do tylu, Rosie
Do tylu
Rosie sighs, shifts her weight, then takes a couple of steps backward
August is amazed
Jacob is thrilled
(
) That Fox Bros bull man didn't tell us was the elephant tramp who sold Rosie to them was Polish
August grabs Jacob and kisses him on the mouth
We've got a new star
Greg remains cautious
- :
- The live band plays on a raised platform
The dance floor is jammed with couples
79
Tables and -shaped booths surround the dance floor
Tuxedoed bartenders serve from a wooden bar lined with hundreds of bottles in front of a smoky mirror
August, Jacob and Marlena sit in a booth
They are drunk on their third bottle of champagne
Marlena is wearing a beautiful, low cut beaded red gown
Jacob can barely keep his eyes off of her
Marlena is particularly drunk - we've never seen her this wild or spontaneous
She sings along with the band
she keeps rhythm by banging her hands on the table
However, she is acting distant to August
August is happy she is having a good time
When he slides next to her and puts his arm around her, Marlena stiffens; Would you like to dance, darling
No, thank you
Awkward beat
Marlena takes her champagne glass and drinks the last of it
August tries to make light of it
We need more champagne
'll get it
No, you stay with Marlena
August kisses her cheek, but Marlena is clearly still upset
August lets her be
He exits
You ever going to let him off the hook
Hook
That's an unfortunate choice of words
Rosie's going be great
He won't hurt her again
know it
Jacob, what you know about August is pretty much nothing
80
Jacob feels put down
Marlena realizes that came out too brusquely
She softens, and explains with vulnerability; (') You know how many star acts we've had
How much money we've made and lost and made
Silver Star paid for our new stateroom and look what happened to him
Everything August touches gets fed to the cats one way or another
() He'll never change
Jacob is moved
Marlena shifts gears and rises
(') want to dance
Maybe you should wait for August
want to dance now
She pulls him up onto the dance floor
Marlena dances light as air
She spins from Jacob then returns to his arms, so that her back is to him
Jacob's forearm is on her collarbone - skin to skin
Her chest rises and falls under his arm
Her hair under his chin, Jacob can smell her fragrance - then she unwinds away from, like a ribbon
When the music stops, everyone applauds their dance - including Marlena
Jacob beams
He looks up to the bar: August stands stock still
His eyes glaring at Jacob
The dark expression we've come to know
Seething with quiet rage
Jacob takes a step back from Marlena when suddenly they hear; : Jacob is swept by a crush of bodies
People scream, shoving their way towards the exit
Marlena is shoved along with them, a few heads in front of Jacob
Jacob reaches through the sea of flesh and grabs a hand
By Marlena's expression, we know he has grasped her hand
Jacob scans the panicked crowd for August but all he sees are strangers running in every direction, people screaming
Jacob's hand is ripped apart from Marlena at the doorway
81
- Jacob is thrown into the alley
People are piling into cars, engines are starting, wheels squealing
Suddenly, Marlena appears, grabbing Jacob's hand
She takes off her shoes
They run through back streets
-     - They run under a fire escape, panting, out of breath
The sirens and screams of the crowd are distant
Lord, that was close
Aw, look at my stockings
And they're silk too
wonder if August got out
Marlena looks up at Jacob and starts laughing hysterically, as if for no reason
They are both still drunk
(') don't know how we're going to get home
've never been in New York, have you
Marlena's laughing subsides as she gets an idea
want to see the Empire State Building
What
what about August
don't know where he is, do you
And he doesn't know where we are
It's not our fault
Like you said, who knows how long it'll take us to get back
Jacob is hesitant
Marlena takes his hand and softly pleads; (') Just a few hours, Jacob
For just a few hours, we don't belong anywhere
we don't belong to anyone
Please
82
Jacob looks in her eyes and knows he shouldn't, but
(
) was doomed
He smiles
Marlena beams
They run off
-  - summer storm with thunder and lightening is coming towards them from over the Hudson River
Marlena and Jacob are looking out at the expansive 1931 view of New York City
Other couples stroll about the sky deck
Marlena breathes in deeply
've never seen so far
Have you
(Jacob shakes head) Look at it
As far as the eye can see and it's nowhere near all that's out there
Jacob notices tears in her eyes
Are you all right
(/) Yes
No
Yes, hahaha 'm fine
'm a complete mess
ha
Suddenly,   as loud as she can, startling the other couples
Jacob laughs
Beat of silence, then: (') Sorry
But Jacob understands; He screams and Marlena joins in
The other couples leave the sky deck to get out of the rain and away from "that crazy couple"
Marlena and Jacob stop, wet, panting, laughing from the release
Then, looking out at the view, not at each other
83
Marlena begins to confess what she needs Jacob to know
(') Jacob
need you to do something for me
Promise me you will
() Anything
want you to go
want you get away from us, from the show
You're smart Jacob
You deserve better than us
Leave as soon as you can or something terrible's going to happen
(surprised, confused) Why are you saying this
It's all right
No one can hear
We'll never get another chance to say it all
Marlena looks into Jacob's eyes and finally addresses what they're both thinking; (') Nothing can ever happen with us, you know
It's too dangerous
August will never let me go
You don't know what he's capable of
How can you be with a man you're frightened of
'm not
don't have to feel afraid of him if  don't feel anything
After all these years, 've learned how to do it so well
tell myself, "'m managing
can manage him
August loves me
Nobody else ever did
Who am  to say it's the wrong kind of love
"
See, there's no place for a woman like me in any decent kind of world
You know where they found me when  was a baby
() 84
(') In an alley behind a whore house in Baltimore wrapped in newspaper
No one even bothered to leave a note
This circus, my horses - this is the only kind of life  can have
( ) August made a woman like me a star attraction
'm lucky
And 'm safe
And  was fine - before you came
Jacob feels sorry and hopeful at the same time
(') There's nothing that can cause a woman so much trouble as a good man
'm not that good
And  don't want to be
Don't say that
No,  don't
Good men don't wind up with much in the end except their goodness
Isn't worth much, is it
() See
Look what we've done to you already
She touches Jacob's face gently
Until this moment, they didn't realize how close they are to each other tracing Jacob's face with her hands, as he leans in closer
(') Sweet Jacob
You deserve as good a life any other girl
Am  still a girl
feel so old
They kiss
They stop and silently acknowledge where this is going
As they move towards a secluded spot, they continue to kiss in between lines; 85
(') This can only be tonight
We have to go back
Promise me you understand
understand
Promise me you'll suffer
already am
Promise you'll look in my eyes the whole time
promise
Jacob kisses her with his eyes locked onto hers
With Marlena's back pressed against the entrance, Jacob reaches up and locks the door
They sink to the ground
-   -    - Marlena sits inside Jacob's embrace on the ferry, her head leaning against his chest - their hands entwined
If  had money, if  could take care of you, would we be going back
You'd have to be a Rockefeller
August would find me
He always does
Have you tried to get away before
Jacob you promised
You said you understood it was only tonight
know
do
'm sorry
86
- Jacob walks Marlena out of the port to a waiting cab
They stop a few feet from the cab
Jacob gives her all the money in his pockets
Marlena looks at him as if for the last time
Where were you when  was 17
Jacob smiles
They kiss not wanting to let go
Marlena pulls away and runs into the cab
Jacob watches it drive away
- ,  - -
Jacob reaches the circus
Everyone is asleep
-  - ,  -
Jacob enters the menagerie, heading straight for Rosie
He gets on the ground beneath her and lies down
Rosie raises her trunk to allow Jacob to lie beneath her
: - Jacob is asleep under Rosie when Walter wakes him up
Why are you sleeping here
Somebody's looking for you
- ,  - -
Jacob and Walter enter to find Bill and Grady hiding an ailing Camel in a dimly lit car
Jacob kneels down to him
Hey kid
How nice to see ya
Hey, Camel
What's wrong
don't know, kid
Woke up a few days ago and my feet was all floppy
Jes can't feel'em right
87
(') () It ain't just that though
It's other stuff too
Like down there
man stuff
Camel, his eyes wide and fearful, nods slowly
What's wrong with him, doc
don't know
Jamaica ginger paralysis
Jake leg
've seen it before
No such thing
Is there Doc
Walter looks at Camel's empty "Jake" bottle
The manufacturer started putting this plasticizer in it, or something, to get around regulations that Jamaica ginger extract not be sold as booze
( ) You're not supposed to drink this stuff, ya know
Well what the hell am  supposed to drink to stop the shakes
It's Prohibition and  ain't no Astor
It's  Camel
Tomorrow's payday
We'll get you some moonshine
Grady don't lie to the man
If men were getting paid, Blackie wouldn't have tossed four of " em between Boonton and Weehawken
Four
Will he get better
88
Walter looks at him, his expression says No
We can't leave him here
They'll red light him for sure
Jacob understands
He gets an idea and turns to Walter
Walter understands and reacts with an adamant: -   -  - Walter is walking quickly back to the performer train
Jacob follows, trying to reason with him
Throughout the scene, they are looking out for Blackie's men and speaking low
Walter, please
Blackie and his men only patrol the roustabout cars
They don't work the performer train
We can hide him easy until- () Until when
What are we going to do with him
Shoot him like Silver Star
Because that's what he is Jacob
In a week, he won't be able to move his legs at all
( :) He has a son in Pennsylvania
Near Reading
We're playing there in three weeks
That's all he needs
Walter doesn't want to do this, but clearly can't say no
was right about you
You're going blow us all up
August got home tonight before you and Marlena
People are talking
Walter stalks off leaving Jacob unhinged by the news
(') shouldn't be a clown
should be a Goddamn fortune teller
89
/
- ,  - The cookhouse tent is divided into two sections by a curtain
One one side: working men and the buffet table of food
It is made up of benches and bare wood tables with salt and pepper shakers
The other side of the curtain is filled with performers
The tables have a checkered tablecloth and flowers
Marlena is sitting alone, drinking a cup of coffee
Jacob approaches
He sits opposite her
Good morning
Good morning Jacob, how are you
Marlena smiles
Jacob senses others eavesdropping
but the table is far enough away, so they can't be heard
wanted to, uh
Is there any chance  could speak with you alone
About what
Is something wrong
No,
just wanted to
Walter said people are talking about what happened
last night
() Oh Jacob, champagne completely overwhelms my senses
always feel the better for it when  abstain
All  remember is getting pushed by the crowd and then running and getting a hole in my stocking don't even know how  got home don't remember a thing
Well,  want to apologize for-- 90
Ha,ha Jacob, it's silly of you to apologize for my torn stockings
You weren't even there
Jacob is crushed by her reaction
Marlena maintains her upbeat facade
August enters with his tray of food and crosses to them
He is smiling like a man who has spent the night having great sex
August kisses Marlena right in front of Jacob
It is a long sensual kiss
a holdover from their night together
slept like a baby after last night
Thank you my darling
August, please
We're in public
Jacob understands his meaning and is quietly devastated
() Ah, nothing to be ashamed of
Man and wife reuniting in the most sacred of marriage places
() My Marlena has forgiven me
All's well with the world again, right Jacob
( ) That was quite an adventure last night
'm glad  didn't have to bail you out
How did you get home
don't know
just ran
() How did you two get separated
You were so close on the dance floor
told you, sweetheart
We got pushed apart by the crowd
This older married couple brought me to the ferry
'd like to look them up and invite them to the show free of charge
() 91
(') 'll even pay for their transportation
'd pay it a hundred times over to anyone who helped my wife to safety
Thank goodness she had chaperones
If anyone had harmed her, or even touched her, there's no knowing what  might do
Jacob makes note of the implication
Marlena ignores it
-  ,  - While Jacob coaches August from the sidelines, the company of performers and workmen watch August command Rosie in Polish
(
) August said he would create an act for Marlena and Rosie that would have'em line up for miles
August and the company are delighted when Rosie lifts her foot
or walks forward, then backward
(
) (') His accent was awful but Rosie obeyed without fail
Marlena watches, full of excitement and praise for August
He instructs Marlena where to stand
He commands Rosie who lifts Marlena up with her trunk
Everyone cheers and applauds
Those near Jacob pat him on the back, grateful that he saved the circus
Jacob smiles
(
) (') was finally a part of them
- -   , : /  '  - ,  -
When they enter the center ring, they stop
August gives Rosie the command to lift Marlena down with her trunk
But Rosie hesitates
August commands her again, with more force
But Rosie doesn't move forward
she shuffles a foot backwards
August grips his silver tipped cane
Oh-oh
92
Jacob and other performers watch anxiously
Will Rosie fail
Then August turns to the audience and mimes apologizing to the crowd
When he back is turned, Rosie hits his butt with her trunk
August freezes
The crowd laughs uproariously
Jacob and the others realize it's all part of the act
Walter slaps his back
Barbara kisses his cheek
August displays great performance skills
He turns to Rosie acting suspicious
Rosie lifts her head away, as if to say "It wasn't me"
August turns back to the crowd to apologize and once again, Rosie flicks his behind with her trunk
This time August knows it her
He turns to her, tips his hat over his brow and shakes his finger, scolding, as if to say, "No, no, no" Rosie responds by waving her trunk, mocking him
And the crowd bursts into applause
August commands Rosie, who lifts Marlena with her trunk and places her on the ground
,  - Posters of  and  highlight the act
Blackie and his men are covering up the Posters of other circuses and town events
(
) August could have given Barnum a run for his money
He spent the payroll money on expensive posters promoting that act like it was bigger than Ringling
And we sold out every performance in every town
/  '  -  ,  - Marlena blows kisses to the audience
She skips theatrically around the ring, with Rosie trotting behind her, August hovering beside
Marlena stops and wipes her brow, feigning exhaustion, and sits on a small ball
93
Rosie observes her with a smile and a raised trunk
Rosie copies Marlena's actions, placing her enormous rear down on a much larger ball
The crowd screams with laughter
Marlena stands in mock outrage, wagging her finger at Rosie
She turns her back on her, folding her arms
Rosie also stands and presents Marlena with her rear end facing the other way
The audience loves it
(
) In that center ring, Rosie became a guaranteed star attraction
'  -   -  - Jacob sits alone facing Rosie, in her massive stock car made of steel, talking to her, in Polish
(
) Alone with me, telling her every thing  couldn't tell anyone else, she became the closest thing  had to family
/  '  - ,  - Marlena looks back and scowls
With dramatic flair, she raises one foot and places it on the small ball as if to say, "Take that, elephant
" Rosie, not to be out done (guided by August's Polish commands) curls her trunk, lifts her foot and places it on her larger ball
Marlena straightens out both arms and extends her other leg, like a ballerina's, toe pointed
She place the foot alongside the other, so that she is now standing atop the ball
Rosie waits a moment, then lifts her other front foot onto the ball
The crowd explodes
August pretends to be outraged with Marlena
But as showers of coins and money rain upon them, August and Marlena stand beneath showers of glittering coins
(
) And August
Ha, August was a new man
94
- ,  - The workmen set up the circus with energy and renewed spirit
August treating them with pats on the back of gratitude
(
) treating everybody first class, spreading the word his Rosie act would finally get the men paid
'  -   - Jacob, Walter and a Camel enjoy a card game and moonshine
(
) And with business so strong, nobody was worried about getting tossed, so we didn't have to worry so much about old Camel
- ,  - August is filling a bucket with gin and ginger ale for Rosie
(
)
And nothing was too good for Rosie
When August found out she liked gin and ginger ale, he made sure she got both every day, treating her like some favorite child
/  '  - ,  - Marlena does a double take, then lifts up her finger as if to say " have an idea
"
With a rising drum roll, she shuffles her feet atop the ball, moving herself around the ring
Rosie places all four of her feet onto the larger ball and rolls herself around the ring
Marlena and Rosie go faster and faster, along with the music
August takes Marlena's hand and kisses it as they take their bows
(
) But  didn't trust the new August
kept waiting for the real one to show up
95
'  - ,  - Out of the darkness of the car, Rosie appears in the light, being guided down the ramp by August, who gently pets her trunk, whispering in her ear
Her ears flapping, she purrs with affection
Jacob watches
(
) It was when  saw Rosie purring under his touch as if nothing had happened between them, that the worst thought occurred to me
-   - Marlena and Jacob are laughing, listening to August telling a story after a private dinner
Jacob glances at Marlena
(
) Maybe,  was the man not to be trusted
Marlena moves to August's lap
They kiss
Jacob watches (
) (') Marlena looked happy
And it broke my heart
- : (
) The circus is nothing without it's traditions
- ,  - August has gathered all the performers and trainers in a circle
Jacob stands in the center
Marlena beside August
It's a family
And like any family, when a new member is born, it's arrival must be greeted with celebration and gratitude
Now, we've been a little busy with sold out performances, thank the Gods
( ) () 96
(') but right now  want to take this moment before today's show to gather together
We close our eyes
Everyone closes their eyes
(') and we thank whoever's up there that sends desperate men running for the rails
Everyone laughs
(') because it was a lucky day when Jacob Jankowski jumped our train
Because of him - together with our beautiful Rosie and my beloved Marlena - we have the greatest star attraction in Benzini Brother's history
He found a way to save us all
And so, to officially welcome Jacob into the family, we open our eyes
Everyone opens their eyes
(') And we give him the traditional Benzini Brothers baptism
, ,
Jacob is a mess, covered in pies, seltzer and confetti
The company breaks up with laughter, applauds and cheers
Walter and Barbara bring Jacob towels, embracing and kissing him
The rest of the company follows suit
August motions for Marlena, who retrieves a large mens clothing box and carries it to Jacob as August watches from a distance
The crowd parts as Marlena hands him the box
August watches Jacob open the box to find his own
(') Now you don't have to borrow mine
Everyone applauds, hugging and kissing Jacob: Thank you, August
97
It's from both of us
Jacob looks to Marlena
It is awkward between them
They can't kiss each other
Jacob nods and says courteously; Thank you, Marlena
You're welcome, Jacob
As Marlena exits with the others, we discover August watching from them a distance; August's expression tells us he knows what they are hiding
- ,  -
Marlena and Rosie exits the Big Top
We hear tumultuous applause coming from inside
Jacob awaits them, as usual
Jacob commands Rosie, who lifts Marlena off his back and places her carefully on the ground
Jacob pets and commands Rosie to follow him, but stops when: wonder if you could help me
Sure
( ) 've planned a surprise for August
He's been so wonderful, don't you think
( ) Could you make sure Rosie is staked in my tent after the show
No problem
Thank you so much
Oh, and 'm sure it would be nice for August if you were there too
Marlena turns and exits
Jacob isn't sure what to think
98
'   - ,  - Rosie is staked into the grass inside Marlena's tent, happily occupied with a pile of watermelons
Marlena wears a silk beaded dress with the diamond necklace
There is a serving table with silver domed platters and wine bottles
Marlena is trying to open a champagne bottle when Jacob enters
Oh, he'll be here any second
Jacob, can you open this for me
Jacob takes the champagne bottle and manipulates the cork
Rosie's trunk is curious, inspecting the bottle in Jacob's hand
Jacob laughs
Marlena sees and laughs as well
Rosie
get away
ssstop
Rosie continues fooling around, causing Marlena and Jacob to laugh even harder when the cork pops
(
) What is this
Jacob and Marlena turn to see August enter, laying down his hat and coat, his shirt unbuttoned at the top
/ Jacob pours the champagne into two flutes, which Marlena rushes up to August, handing him a glass and kissing him
Did you show Jacob the opening night present  gave you
Marlena turns to Jacob and indicates the diamond necklace
(indicating the necklace) Oh
No
Do you see Jacob
Beautiful
It looks stunning on you
99
They kiss again
Marlena raises her glass of champagne
To August - an authentic miracle man because he made a star attraction out of me
To August
August nods in gratitude
They tilt their glasses and drink
Many thanks
Forgive me for arriving too soon and spoiling the surprise
August takes out a cigarette and lights it
Don't be silly
couldn't wait for you to come
could go back out to give you more time
or better yet, yell and clear the place out so you two can be alone
In a split second, Jacob and Marlena know the danger present
August gave no sign of it coming
What
'm sorry
'm probably wrong assumed that night after the was the first time you two fucked, but obviously it's been going on longer than that
Auggie, you're being silly
Did you think  didn't know
August don't do this
Shut-up
100
Marlena gets frightened
August saunters over to the silver tipped cane leaning against the flap
He picks it up as Marlena and Jacob remain still
Suddenly they hear: Rosie peeing where she is staked
She too is frightened
(') How long did you think you could keep this from me
August, please, there's nothing- August swipes the tables with the cane, knocking all the platters and glasses to the floor
We should go
So you two are a couple
just don't think you're safe to be around a woman right now
woman
This is not a woman
This is my wife you Ivy League lying piece of shit
Say,  bet the authorities would like to know you practise without a license
Auggie, please
Don't you see how much  love you
see you
see you too clearly
Always have
have to admit that was a nice touch when you got back from the speakeasy
Being with me in our bed, after being with him
Covering your tracks
should have known a whore only performs for a man like that when she wants something
Marlena, come with me
101
' Marlena drops the fluted glasses, crying: Suddenly, he's quiet
He stands still
Marlena approaches him now, cautiously but tenderly
(') Auggie
Are you all right now
August looks at her
Marlena's expression is one of care and concern
Jacob watches carefully
Has it passed
Suddenly, August flicks his lit cigarette into Rosie's open mouth - Rosie reacts and Jacob moves to help her - as August grabs Marlena, shoving her so hard she falls against the table, knocking it and her to the ground
He attacks her, trying to rip off her diamond necklace
Jacob attacks August, pulling him off of Marlena
: savagely pounding each other's faces, crashing against broken plates and spilled gravy, banging their heads viciously against the ground, rolling over each other as they alternately share domination
Marlena screams for them to stop
Rosie bellows, pulling on her leg chain
The
'   -  - ,  - Jacob and August continue beating each other as they roll out into the crowd
August's madness empowers him
He manages to overpower Jacob in a choke hold
Jacob is losing consciousness
Because of Marlena's screams - Earl and his men run to the tent
Within seconds, they are pulling August off of Jacob
August gets to his feet
His cool expression is even more frightening as he re-enters Marlena's tent
'
102
From inside the tent, they hear a crash
Marlena screams
(') '
No he won't, kid
Come on
Earl disperses the crowd that has gathered, which includes Walter, who sees Jacob's bloodied face and goes to him
,  : Two soft thuds
then a louder one
Then an unnerving silence
(') See, it's over
Can we let you go
Jacob pants and nods
Earl and one of his men let Jacob go in degrees, until he is standing up
Walter holds his waist
Come on Jacob
Walk away
With Walter's help, he tears his eyes from the billowing flap and walks away, passing rubes who watch with fascination
'  - ,  - Walter uncorks a jug of moonshine and hands it to Jacob, who holds a towel to his bloody, beaten face
Jacob drinks from the jug, panting, until the pain subsides
Camel speaks from behind the trunks
The only thing that's keeping you alive right now are the rubes who saw everything
August can't risk getting rid of you here
But you better not get back on this train when we leave tomorrow night
(
) What happened
Somebody turn me around
Share some of that jug
Shut-up Camel
(
) Well, what the hell
103
Camel uses whatever strength his has to push aside the trunk and see bloody Jacob
(') Jesus Christ
Who did that to you
August
( ) Is it true
Jacob wants to deny it but his silence speaks the truth
He can only manage to shake his head
But Walter can read between the lines
He lowers his head in despair
All three react with surprise
Why are we moving
We have a matinee tomorrow
Something's gone wrong
,
The three men immediately are on alert
Walter grabs his knife from beneath his pillow
Camel tries to shove himself behind the trunks as we hear: (
) Jacob
Jacob, it's Marlena
They breath a sigh
Jacob opens the door to reveal
Marlena with a black eye
Jacob rises to her
(') 'm sorry
had nowhere to go told him 'm leaving him
My God
Are you all right
Looks worse than it feels
(Re: Jacob's face, laughs) Ha, look at the two of us
Marlena awkwardly enters the room to Walter and Camel's stares
She sees the moonshine and breaks the ice
(') Can  have a swig of that
104
Walter throws her the moonshine
Marlena drinks like a pro
Why is the train moving
Marlena sits with the jug, casually talking: We're being run out
Apparently, August was so optimistic about money coming in for Rosie, he figured he'd double down and find himself a new fat lady to put him really toe to toe with Ringling
So he sent Mr
Erwin into town who finds this rather large woman in a restaurant and offers her the job
Except, she
( ) she was the police chief's wife
Mr
Erwin got a left hook in the jaw and we got til morning to get out of town
This cracks everybody up
Laughter
release of tension
But the laughter turns to quiet sadness as the reality of their situation sinks in
Marlena looks to Jacob and leans into his arms
He holds her, clearly in love, then ushers her out of the room for privacy
Walter sees what he knew all along
He kisses Queenie: Aw girl
We're all in it now
-   -  - Marlena and Jacob exit Walter's room outside of which Marlena placed her small suitcase
They pass by Marlena's horses
Why are you hiding that roustabout
Because Blackie and his men don't work the performer train and they'll red-light him if they find him
He can't work anymore
My God
105
They come upon Silver Star's stall - empty - right before the door to the next car
They stop
Does August know where you are
No
He thinks 'm with Barbara and the girls
He won't go there
He can't find you
As soon as we stop - before we stop - we'll jump off and 'll take you to a hotel in town
And after that
August has all our money
Where will  go
Marlena, 'm not leaving you
We'll find a way together
won't let you go back to him
promise
Marlena smiles, needing to hear him say those words
She embraces him, grateful
Jacob holds her tight, assuring; (') 'll call my dean at Cornell
If can take my finals again, get my degree,  can get my license
They lay in the Silver Star's empty stall
Moonlit through the wooden slats
Making plans
Oh Jacob, that would be wonderful
You know,  bet Ringling would take us both then - they'd be getting a vet and a star attraction - that's a sweet deal for them
Although won't be a star but  don't care
'll take no billing at all
We'd be safe from August if we were with Ringling
Don't worry about him
Of course, 'd have to wait a while until  can work again
106
What do you mean
Jacob
'm going to have a baby
Jacob is stunned
then confused
(') It's yours
Please don't ask me how know
Is it all right
You can change your mind
'd understand
Overwhelmed, Jacob keeps kissing her
Marlena lets go of all the anxiety she had about him
He loves her
She knows it
Change my mind
Oh Marlena, please
please be happy
(Cries, relieved) will
promise
as soon as stop being terrified
Jacob kisses her
He guides her to the ground, against the hay
She nestles in his arms
(') 'm so tired
Rest
've got you now
Marlena tries, closing her eyes
Then, without warning; , ,  & , ,

: 107
'  -  - Kinko sits against the door, holding a trembling Queenie hearing the screams and struggle
Camel quivers in fear behind the trunks
: -  - -
' , - / - , -
, / - ,  - heavy rain pours
bloodied, battered Jacob is semi- conscious face down in a stream in the woods
Jacob, his eyes almost swollen shut, wakes out of unconsciousness
He looks up through blurred vision
Through the trees, he can see
He stands
His knees buckle and he crawls out to the ground
He stands again
And he walks out of the woods towards the flickering light
He stumbles and falls
He rises and fumbles forward
using all his strength to get himself out of the woods
-  - Jacob struggles out of the woods to a clearing
Squinting through the rain with swollen eyes, he sees: 108
He walks, with legs barely able to move
He climbs up the gravel to the train tracks and begins to walk
- Jacob is walking on the train tracks in the direction of Marlena's train
He has walked all night and into the day
-    - Jacob - beaten, bloodied, exhausted - looks up ahead: and     already set up
-    - It's pre-matinee
All the tents have been set up
The rubes are filling the grounds
The midway is packed with people
-     -  - Nell is sitting by an open window fanning herself from the heat when she sees: Jacob wandering behind the back of the train where no one can see him
Nell watches as Jacob tries to reach the train, then falls unconscious
Nell quickly brings Barbara to the window
Barbara sees Jacob and immediately takes charge
Camera tracks Barbara and the girls through the windows, as they walk through the car
Barbara is organizing a plan with the girls
-  - Nell and two Coochie Girls hold their robes closed as they walk among the crowd
The Coochie girls head for Blackie and his security men
They talk to them to distract them
We see Nell approach Walter in full clown make-up doing tricks with Queenie for the crowd
Nell whispers to Walter
His expression tells us what we know
109
-     - Barbara and the Tattooed Man sneak to the fallen Jacob with a blanket
They turn him over, shocked by his condition
Jacob's eyes open - he's delirious
Poor Kid
Help me with him
(delirious to Tattoo man) Don't you work the matinee
Not today
'm fading
gotta re- ink
Don't talk
Jacob nods
They cover him, pick him up and carry him off
'  -    - Jacob opens his eyes
Walter is applying wet cloths to his head
Camel watches nearby
Jacob suddenly rises; Marlena
Sshh
Lie back
Where is she
Did he hurt her
don't know
Your pupils are two different sizes
Jacob pushes himself up onto his elbows but his world spins
have to get Marlena
What if he-- Jacob, look at me
You've got a concussion and you're on a moving train
There's nothing you can do
Marlena can handle him
She's done it for years
110
have to get her
Jacob, you can't
She's going to have a baby
Walter is stopped
Camel shakes his head
Does August know
(Jacob shakes his head) What have you done to us
We're going to Ringling
Me, Marlena
You can too
'm a fifth rate clown when second rate circuses are folding all over the place
Doesn't put me on top of Ringling's list
They've got a dozen of me in the wings couldn't even go if  wanted to
August won't pay anyone
Says the show's debts have to come first
First time in Benzini Bros history performers haven't been paid
People are starving out there, Jacob
In the United States of America
Starving
Where am  going to go
What about family
Like my son
Gotta have somebody
a mother
Not a woman  have any use for
She's sold me to this outfit when was 13
She sold you
'm not exactly cut out for farm work
Don't worry about me
() 111
(') If you and Marlena go, if August doesn't kill you first - 'll know what to do
'll tell August how well  got to know you and how can help him find you
Might even get myself a better room out of the bargain
It won't be anything personal, you understand
Beat
Each wants the other to survive at any cost
Do whatever you have to, Walter
You too, Jacob
They exchange a final look, which is a goodbye
Walter turns away from Jacob, holding Queenie to his chest
Camel looks compassionately at Jacob and says: Ya poor kid
The night this train passed ya
you shoulda kept on running,  guess
'  -   - Camel and Walter are snoring, asleep with their backs to Jacob
Queenie is asleep, nestled in Walter's arms
Jacob struggles to raise himself up
His world spins
He holds tight to the bedroll, until the spinning subsides
Jacob is a man with a mission
His eyes focus on: Walter's Knife, sticking out from beneath Walter's pillow
-   - The train is moving fast
The rain has returned
Jacob is making his way towards the back of the train, as it moves forward
He holds the knife in his mouth
moving like a tightrope walker over the wet train roof, as rain pours
When he reaches the car's end, he takes a deep breath
With all his strength, he leaps across the divide between the cars and lands, clinging to the top rail, panting like a dog
112
He removes the knife from his mouth, having cut his lip
He licks the blood back and replaces the knife, this time keeping his lips retracted
, '   - Jacob leaps to the roof of Marlena and August's car
At this moment, the train is making a curve
Jacob climbs down over the side ladder
Beyond him, we see: , Jacob jumps to the platform
He can see the rocky waters far below the trestle
He catches his breath and waits, as the train straightens out onto land again
Jacob turns the knob of the door to the stateroom, slowly, hearing a click, pausing, then opening it
-  - Jacob enters the stateroom, leaving the door open
He creeps towards the velvet curtain which is closed
He grips the knife
When he reaches it, he pulls the edge and peeks inside
August is asleep on his side, his arms locked around Marlena, who is awake facing the curtain
Jacob and Marlena's eyes meet
She sees the knife in his hand August suddenly moves, pulls Marlena closer to his chest, burying his face in her neck
Jacob steps forward, raising the knife
His hands tremble
The moonlight glints off the blade, throwing off light
Marlena is looking up at him, tears in her eyes
She subtly shakes her head ""
She doesn't want him to do this
Jacob's hands are shaking now
The knife gripped in his hand
He wants to rescue her, he's so close
We hold the moment
Marlena's expression convinces Jacob not to do it
not to cross that line and kill August
113
Defeated, Jacob kneels beside her and hangs his head
Marlena reaches out to touch him
this time she really is saying goodbye
But Jacob can not bear it
He looks at her for the last time, then rises and exits
-   - Jacob returns to the ring stock car, hopping down from the roof
The Horses are stirring, agitated
He calms them
And then Jacob sees: the door to Walter's room is open
He ; Walter
Camel
' /    -  - Jacob enters to find the room in a shambles
terrible realization comes over him: Walter and Camel are gone
They have been red-lighted
He finds Queenie, shaking with fear curled in a ball
He takes her in his arms
Jacob panics
(') No
no
no
no
With Queenie, he rushes back into the ring stock car
he checks everywhere calling out their names
He stops at the open stock car door
The rain continues to fall
Jacob collapses, holding Queenie to his chest
Tears fill his eyes as he tries to hold it together, looking out the moving train, his worst nightmare realized
;   , (
) (') wanted to believe taking Walter's knife didn't make a difference
But still
left him without a fighting chance
Maybe they survived
Maybe they were tossed over grassy land
couldn't let myself believe what  already knew
Jacob falls apart, crying without shame
114
- ,  - sunny day
The circus is completely set up
Townsfolk, rubes, are already buying tickets for the matinee
(
) waited almost til matinee time so could let myself be seen by as many people from town
-  - ,  - Jacob opens the ring stock car and jumps out, holding Queenie
He hasn't slept all night
As he walks through the circus grounds, working men like Greg and performers like Barbara are shocked to see him alive
With a fool's courage, he brazenly walks past Blackie and his men, cutting a path through performers and working men, right up to August, who stands with Earl at his side
He is dressed and ready for the matinee's performance
Jacob stops and they exchange looks
August glances at Queenie in Jacob's arms
He says nothing
'm not here to cause any trouble
'm leaving
Funny,  thought you already left
'd like to say goodbye
To the menagerie
Just a few minutes and then 'll go
August's eyes narrow
Earl waits for the outcome
(') There's nothing more you can do to me
Killing me'll be more trouble than it's worth, now that the rubes have seen me
You were right about me from the start August, when you said  wouldn't last
can't survive here
() am nothing
115
August feels victorious and therefore benevolent
Earl, take him to the menagerie
Thirty seconds
Then escort him out of my circus, into Altoona
And if he comes back, you can shoot him, as that is within our lawful rights with regards to trespassers
August walks away
Earl escorts Jacob to the menagerie
On the way, they pass Barbara
Jacob pauses to hand Queenie to her
She has tears in her eyes
Jacob continues with Earl
-   - ,  - Jacob enters alone
He takes in all the animals who look back at him
He crosses to Rosie and stands before her
Her trunk greets him, stroking him
He presses his head against her
Rosie comforts him
It makes Jacob fall apart all the more
After a few moments, Jacob turns and walks away
He stops in the center of the menagerie
He looks at each animal in their den - in the same way as when he first met them - this time saying goodbye
Each animal is at the front of it's den or cage, looking at Jacob
There is a silent exchange between them
Earl enters
Come on kid
When Jacob starts to exit again, something happens: , ,       '
The lock on Rex's cage busts a little as he rams against it
/ - ,  - As Earl escorts Jacob, they walk against the tide of audience members walking to the Big Top entrance
Earl speaks low
It's good you're going
They must have known you got back on the train last night
He tossed more than half a dozen working men
() 116
(') Kinkers never get tossed
Never
So that was meant for you
We hear the   starting in the Big Top
(') few of the guys that got tossed caught up with us again
Walter
Is he---
Instantly, Earl's expression tells Jacob it's bad news
Jacob's breathing almost stops as he listens; Keep walking
They got tossed off the trestle, if you can believe it
Camel's head hit the rocks
He died right away
Jacob is heartbroken and dreads what he's about to hear
Earl pauses for a beat
this part is harder to tell: (') Walter
Walter's legs were smashed up real bad
They had to leave him
() They don't reckon he lasted the night
Jacob is in shock
He can barely walk on
(') The ones that came back
Bill
Grady
don't know how but, one way or another they're taking down August tonight
Hearing this, Jacob stops to face Earl
Why are you telling me
Earl can not find the words: it's clear the killing of these men does not sit well with him
,           , '
Earl shifts his focus - he's alarmed
117
(') Earl, what was that
All the performers and work men on the midway are on alert
' "   "
Oh Christ
Oh Shit
Earl runs back towards the Big Top
What is it
The Disaster March
Everyone with the show barrels towards the Big Top when Greg appears amongst them and calls to Jacob: ' , -  - Jacob shoots through the tent flap and is immediately flung up against the sidewall as: ,     , Jacob looks to the menagerie and faces; : -
-
, , , , , , , , ,
-     , -
-        - , ,
118
Jacob is scanning the tent for Marlena when: - ' '
Jacob manages to hold Bobo in one arm and the Orangutan in the other as his eyes sweep the tent, searching for Marlena: Then Jacob sees -    ' -  , , -           - ; , '
, -   , - -        ' , Searching and dodging animals, Jacob sees a flash of pink sequins
He sees August with Marlena standing beside him, in front of Rosie
Marlena sees Jacob and makes a run for him, but August quickly grabs her arm and flings her to the ground
She falls out of view from Jacob
Jacob runs to them, dodging the fleeing animals, when suddenly: '
He cries out
Rosie cries out
She begins to stamp her feet
Marlena lies with her face in the dirt, crawling beneath the ropes to get under Rosie for safety
119
August pulls Jacob with a new bull hook, tossing him the ground
August glares at him, his eyes full of rage; He attacks but Jacob dodges the next blow, grabbing onto the bull hook and twisting it with such strength, it topples August who refuses to let it go
,
Like madmen fighting with the intention to kill
Jacob unleashes a rage and a strength we have yet to see in him, as he beats August without mercy
But August manages to overpower Jacob, unleashing his own maniacal fury
By taking advantage of the bull hook wound, August gets Jacob into a death grip around his neck
Marlena screams out, unable to help as animals stampede around the two men locked in combat
Only Rosie, who towers above them, knows what to do
Jacob, choking under August's grip, looks up at Rosie
She raises her trunk to smile at him
Jacob looks down and sees that '
Jacob fights August to breathe as Rosie reveals she is holding the stake loosely, resting it's end on the dirt
The chain still attached to her foot
Jacob flips himself which forces August to turn his back on Rosie in order to keep his grip on Jacob
Marlena covers her head in her arms, not wanting to see
Jacob can not breathe
August is squeezing the life from him : Rosie lifts the stake as if it weighs nothing and brings it down onto August, splitting his head in one clean move
She continues to hold the stake until August topples forward, dead, his skull opened like a hardboiled egg
Released of August, Jacob rolls himself under the ropes just : ,
120
Rosie then slides the stake back to the ground
Marlena, head hidden under her arms, sees nothing
The menagerie is clear of the stampeding animals
Marlena lifts her head up from beneath her arms, remaining under Rosie
She sees August lifeless body
She looks to Jacob
He rises, bloodied and beaten, but alive
: The empty menagerie except for: Jacob standing, Marlena under Rosie and the two monkeys inspecting August's dead body
- ,  - The polar bear is walking calmly down main street
(
) It took days to round them up
Some we never did get back
- '  - ,  - Two Children are delighted that a  is eating from their second story window
- ,  - Camera discovers a  and   , both quivering, huddled opposite each under beneath a sink
(
) don't know who was more scared - the rubes or the animals
-   - ,  - is pulling up alongside the "ghost town" of the Benzini Bros - the ruins of the circus are highlighted by strong winds blowing up dust and dirt
(
) When the Nesci Bros
Circus showed, we were officially belly up
after unrolling a canvas and making a discovery inside
crowd forms
When Jacob reaches it, he sees: , ,
121
- ,  - and the Sheriff fight with Jacob over Rosie
These animals are now the property of Altoona and we're here to sell them to Mr
Nesci
Not all of them
Some of these animals are mine, like this bull
Do you have any proof
Jacob is stalled
Greg appears
He's right
He's just an elephant tramp
The bull is his
You don't want her anyway
She can't do anything
Dumb as a box of peanut shells
Skeptical, Dick Nesci steps up to Rosie
What's her name
Gertrude
Jacob and Rosie exchange eye contact
Nesci is skeptical
Gertrude
Gertrude, step up
Rosie blows and swings her trunk, throwing dirt across the people around her
Dick Nesci takes the bull hook and prods under her leg, ordering her
Rosie just swings her ears and sniffs Dick Nesci with her trunk
Then checks his pockets for treats
Jacob exchanges a look with Rosie
122
- ,  -  -
Jacob is walking Rosie, holding the Orangutan, with Bobo atop Rosie
Through the wind and dust, they look for Marlena
Marlena looks spent - shocked, relieved, tearful, hopeful
She reaches Jacob
What happens now
wish  knew
Marlena exhausted, eases into Jacob's arms
It's over
: Jacob and Marlena and their animals, as the giant tent of the Benzini Bros
Big Top falls to the ground
'  -   - Jacob is finishing his story
Charlie is enthralled
The first bottle of scotch is gone
The second half full
convinced my dean to let me take my finals
Marlena was right
With my degree, our animals and Marlena's acts, Ringling got a sweet deal
Our son was born our first season
We named him Walter
He spent the first seven years of his life with Ringling
() That's why
just can't understand how he forgot to show up today
(His eyes glitter ) There was a circus in town
Charlie understands
He looks affectionately at Jacob
(') By the time our third son came, we'd had enough
Rosie was tired
(Charlie smiles
) Luckily, the vet at the Albany Zoo dropped dead, so  got the job
() 123
(') We bought some property so we could keep the horses
Rosie
then five kids
Bobo and that Orangutan
Never named that Orangutan
Nothing ever sounded
elegant enough for her
Just called her Ma'am
(Smiles with great joy) Man oh man that was
that was a life, boy, 'll tell ya
Charlie smiles, appreciating this old man's big life
(') And then before you know it, the kids are borrowing the car and moving out
Marlena and  on our own again
until she passed
This moment causes Jacob to pause
He still loves her
(') never told Marlena it was Rosie who got August
didn't want her to know
When Rosie passed on, she cried for days
owe that bull my whole life
my kids, everything
Charlie peeks through the window and sees a : It's the heat
They're here for me
Charlie and Jacob exchange a look
Charlie understands
/
-   - Charlie opens the door to greet a
Hi Officer, can  help you
Yes, 'm hoping you can
An elderly gentleman went missing from the nursing home down the street
Staff seems to think he came here
124
We had a lot of folks from the home today
But no,  haven't seen him
The Cop peers past Charlie and sees Jacob
Excuse me, but who is that
(Pause, then) Oh
that's my Dad
The Cop is suspicious
Charlie covers: (') He can't talk
Had a major stroke a few years back
But he's doing well
Ain't ya Pop
Understanding the ruse, Jacob starts to play the part of a stroke victim: he opens his mouth, his jaw quivers
He reaches for his glass with a shaking arm
Charlie helps him
Jacob holds out his tongue like a parrot's as Charlie helps him drink
The Cop watches with a blank expression
Jacob swallows and nods speechless, smiles and manages to drool
Beat
The Cop wonders
Then, pulling out his card: , well, thanks for your time
Here's my number in case you hear of anything
Sorry to bother you
The Cop exits
Charlie returns to sit opposite Jacob
They consider this unspoken proposal: You sure about this
Beat as Charlie pours another shot
Then: wonder if we can get you into the book of records
"Oldest man who ever ran away with the circus"
Nah, 'm not running away
Just coming home
125
-   - Old Jacob uses his walker to enter the menagerie
He moves to each animal meeting his eyes with theirs
Each animal gives him a look of acknowledgment
He comes to an
younger than the one from his Benzini days
Jacob stops
He steadies himself
Jacob lets go of the walker and reaches his arm out to the Orangutan's cage
The Orangutan studies him for a moment
Judging
Jacob keeps his arm extended, which isn't easy for him
The Orangutan then extends his hand through the bars to Jacob's hand
Jacob's fingers entwine around the Orangutan's hand
They hold for a moment
Jacob smiles
Thank you, Ma'am
