Randy, pushing 50, still with the same long, dyed-blond mane, sits on a bench in the boys locker room of a Wilmington, Delaware high school
: 20 He pulls off his purple spandex wrestling tights
Lime-green ram's horns run up the sides
They're the same kind of tights as in the `80s pics----and may well be the actual same pair
Naked except for a jockstrap, Randy takes a breath
Achy, sweaty, saggy, exhausted
battered warrior
Scars all over his body
Despite the rough shape he's in, it's clear he's just given it his all in the ring
He swigs down a few pills with a beer
Promoter  , a heavyset man in a Mets jersey with - 44 on the back, approaches

He hands Randy some cash
Randy counts it
It's not much

Randy just shrugs resignedly

Randy smiles a little
He remembers, too
He hands back the poster
Fan #2 looks fondly at Randy, a part of his boyhood
#2 (') (vaguely sad) You were awesome
Randy nods, a bit uncomfortably
The two fans, muttering thanks, drift off into the Delaware night
Randy is left standing alone, still holding Fan #1's pen
He walks over to a beat-up old   and climbs in
Turns on the engine
Music starts up on the stereo mid-song

What happened
It was while  was wrestling collapsed in the ring
Oh, man
That's terrible

So, uh
Should  call you Cassidy or Pam
She gives the question genuine thought
Pam
(playful finger wag) But don't get used to it

Cassidy is less loose and playful than Randy, much more in business mode
They come to the back where, against the wall, she finds what she's looking for: a bunch of bursting with a wildly eclectic assortment of tops, skirts, pants, etc

Randy goes into lapdance mode, "seductively" writhing for her, silly and self-aware
Just sit back and enjoy

He drapes his long blond mane over her shoulders, running it over her face
She laughs, charmed and amused
He gazes into her eyes intensely

Cassidy laughs
He continues dancing, totally unembarrassed

It's a charming little Jersey-shore boardwalk/beach lined with Skee-Ball games, ice-cream parlors, -shirt shops etc
It's a bit cold and not very crowded, still out of season
You really don't remember
No
Guess you were pretty young
They walk for a stretch in silence
He points to a spot
(') There used to be this funhouse
() The Monster Motel
Randy chuckles at the memory
(') They had this cheesy-ass skeleton that popped out of a coffin
You'd get so scared, you'd cry

(') My priorities were all fucked up know that
But now
