"When business in the United States underwent a contraction
the Federal Reserve created more paper reserves
The excess credit spilled over into the market triggering a fantastic speculative boom
" - It's a summer day
The heat floats above the pavement
cab waits in the lot
The large gates of New York's largest prison open and today's group of newly released emerge
They pass a guard who lifts up a copy of The  Today to reveal the headlines and date that tells us it's 2002
Amongst this group we find a man carrying a small duffel
And we know this man
He is Gordon Gekko
But he is not as slick as we remember
he doesn't have that gleam in his eyes or that gel in his hair
No, this is a very different version of the man we remember
because now there's nothing behind those eyes
nothing we can read anyway
And he just stands there
coldly watching his recently freed brethren greet their wives and children
reuniting with the people who waited for them
the people who love them
The cab slowly pulls up and Gordon holds up a finger
wait a minute
He glares over to the entrance of the lot
waiting for his people
but they don't come
And the cab waits
Gordon stands there
in the heat
completely disappointed
and completely alone
And we
As the white letters reappear on the screen

the more superstitious we become

: gorgeous June Friday

Find  , mid 50s, shaved-head and in good shape
(
) (') He started every day the same exact way
He would walk his dogs then leave his Gramercy Park condo at seven am on the dot
As Andrew leaves 36 East Gramercy Park East, an impressive building made of white stone
Andrew wears a suit and holds an umbrella
(
) (') And he would take an umbrella with him even when there was no chance of rain
As Andrew heads to a newsstand and throws the   a familiar nod
And without saying a word, the clerk knows exactly what to give him
(
) (') He'd buy a journal, a tin of chocolate Altoids and a cold bottle of Poland Springs water
23RD As Andrew bounds down the stairs and through the gate
(
) (') He had timed it out so he wouldn't have to wait more than three minutes for the uptown five train
As Andrew emerges out to the platform and sees the headlight from the 5 train coming down the tunnel
(
) (') guess you could say that day was like every other
And as the train approaches
holding that Wall Street Journal
the bottle of water and that tin of Altoids
(
) (') Except for one thing
Andrew Zabel simply steps forward and falls onto the track

And as the train  into
Which holds for an uncomfortably long moment, then
"Money Never Sleeps" graces the screen

Now filling the screen
It's of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
It's for the year 2008 and it's down to the right

Opening titles
the workplace throng
listening to their iPods, checking their Blackberrys and sipping their Starbucks
Move with this throng, to the Matthew Good tune, under the opening titles, past 745 Seventh Avenue, the Lehman Brothers building
with that giant ticker that rounds the building posting Dow 12,579
76 -- +119

all is normal in the financial center of the universe
Land on a impressive modern building made of glass and steel then climb up it to the top
to the penthouse office suites
And push in through the window to be in

Zabel sits behind his desk
Go ahead, open it
And across from Andrew Zabel sits

On the wall over Zabel's shoulder runs an electronic ticker with the major indices and just one stock

(') thought that because of the problems with the credi-- Screw the credit derivative desk, don't understand half the shit they do anyway
Zabel forces a smile
But Jacob can tell something's wrong with him
Are you okay
Zabel doesn't answer
he just nods to the envelope
Open it
He opens the envelope and looks down at the check
$1,450,000
And he can barely contain his excitement
Thank you
And we get a good look at Jacob now
boyish features that display humility with a trace of mischievousness thrown in
He's definitely sexy, definitely cerebral and definitely winning
'm proud of you, Jacob

Yeah, it's nice
But here's the thing
He looks around the store for a moment, then

(') want to see the "fuck you" room
The "fuck you" room
Yes
The room where you sell me a fuck you ring for fuck you money
The private client foyer
And with a big smile
What did  say
'  - Two bedroom in a Murray Hill high rise
Jacob watches Fox Business on his tv
much nicer, much bigger, much flatter plasma sits against the wall under it waiting to be installed
promo plays for a magazine show being narrated by Cody Willard
( ) Tomorrow night we explore the excesses of hedge fund managers
Different pictures flash on the screen of private jets, massive mansions, expensive watches and wines
( ) (') Whether they're spraying $5000 a bottle champagne at Voile Rouge in Saint-Tropez, ordering a $10,000 Martini at The Algonquian Hotel with a diamond on the bottom or eating a gold dusted $175 hamburger at the Wall Street Burger Shoppe
Now the flashes are of some of the top    in the business that we'll see later
one of them is a man named
maybe we hold a little longer on him to get a good look
Mid 40s, good looking and refined
( ) (') these cowboys of finance always seem to land on their feet
Jacob lets out a little laugh and mutes the tv
He grabs the phone and makes a call
6
( ) know you're at the fund raiser tonight but  wanted to say hi
() Okay, best part
getting my bonus check
Worst part
He grabs a framed picture of her and looks at it
She's in workout gear, wearing earbuds, obviously just off a run, caught off guard and thus flipping him the finger
it's adorable
(') ( ) it was right after  ordered lunch and  remembered that we're not seeing each other this weekend
And he finishes his message to her
(') ( ) Okay, text me yours and 'll read them in my sleep
love you
As Jacob disconnects and looks out the window
looking out at Third Avenue twinkling up into Midtown
Where the blue line travels down the Dow trend line, down and to the right then stops on Thurs June 12th
: 6 ,  /  - large space lined with long desks that hold five each
Each trader has two phones and three huge monitors in front of them
It's loud and frenetic
Most of the traders are under thirty- five, it's a young person's game
Jacob heads in and takes his seat at his desk
It's larger than the others and anchors the room
this is his domain
Fox Business plays on each of the screens that line the space ubiquitous
( note, when possible, business news will be droning from television sets throughout this movie in bg
as it is the current soundtrack of New York these days) trader named  shouts out
Jake, Glass Works is up nine points on earnings, you want to unload some

Jacob confirms
Yeah, let's get closer to home
trader named  turns to Jacob
(to Jacob, re Willy) Where's his hat
Willy glares at her
Mind your own business, Audry
had to wear Pfizer on my forehead for a full week
so post it up, bitch
Willy pleads with Jacob
'mon Jake, it's embarrassing
Jacob just shrugs
The stock goes down, you wear the crown
them's the rules
Audry grins in victory
Willy shakes his head, grabs a marker, scribbles something down on a post-it then places it on his forehead
It reads " bought Toll Brothers at $24" and he has to wear it all week
And Jacob laughs

The dance floor is packed with New York's privileged draped in Prada and dripped in sweat
Jacob heads a table of five men who are all in suits
They are all in various areas of finance
a   Portfolio Manager, a  , a    and a The quant stares at a     working the room across the way
He then turns back to the guys with

Girl like that cost a thousand bucks last year
now it's up to five
Getting priced out of the hooker bubble
Confirming in frustration
Goddamn bull market's killing my sex life
They all laugh
Don't worry
it's not such a bull market anymore
She'll be trading at five hundred soon enough
The laughter dies down
(turning to Jacob) It's true
'm actually shocked gave you a bonus of that size
Why
Private Equity  nudges Hedge Fund  in reference to the woman who just took the seat at the next table
() Yeah, 'm going long Boeing
Oh,  didn't notice
Confused
Really
The 787 is having problems
As Hedge Fund  opens a bottle of Krug, Clos du Mesnil 1995 and pours it into the flutes
(to Derivatives Trader) Why
Why are you so shocked
Offering Jacob a flute
Because they're in serious trouble
Declining the champagne
9
We're not in serious trouble
It's a rumor
woman takes the table next to them and this makes Derivatives Trader perk up and say
think Goodyear Tire is definitely a buy
Hedge Fund  checks out the woman
Totally
And those tires are real
Even more confused
Goodyear
The chart is horrible
Somebody color the quant in here
Hedge Fund  leans into Quant and explains
Boeing, ticker
Big Ass
Goodyear, ticker
Great Tits
(realizing
) Oh, it's like a code
And Private Equity  turns to Jacob with
(') You guys were down three points in an up market today
Whatever, somebody was adding to their short
As a supermodel now joins the next table
Going long Starwood
Starwood's a buy
(figuring it out) Starwood, ticker
Yeah but
'm more a buyer of
(thinks for a minute) What the fuck is that
10
It's an exchange traded fund that tracks the Guinian Franc
Okay, whatever -- what's it code for
And Quant looks over to the model then back proudly with
Gold Digger Freak Show
The guys just shake their heads
- Jacob and Derivatives Trader enjoy the summer night
Out of all the guys, he's closest to Jacob
His name is Robby
Can  ask you something, Robby
Robby nods
(') What's your number
Huh
You know what  mean
The amount of money you would need to fuck it all and walk away
if you wanted to
Do you want to walk away
Not now
But one day
don't know
When  have a family
It's just so consuming
so many marriages get -- Wall Street divorce lawyers do great in any market
Exactly
() 've thought about it
What  would need
to raise a family, live a good life, be secure
It's not as much as we would think if you move out of New York
And it dawns on Robby
11
Aha
when did you buy the ring
Jacob smiles at his friend's perception
Last week
So when are you going to ask her
'm going to  this weekend
Good
like her for you
She's one of the good ones
() Did you hear what her father said on Charlie Rose
Jacob shakes his head
(') Something about Bear Stearns being the first rain drop of the impending mother of all storms
Sour grapes
He's speaking at Columbia on Friday
If it's slow enough, a few of us might play hookie and check it out
he's the best show in town
And they continue to walk, until
Tell me what you hear
Robby slowly nods
don't think you want to hear it, bro
You worship Zabel and it's not good
don't worship him
He's done a lot for me and 've known him a long time
But he's been acting strange lately
() Just tell me what you hear
That Keller Zabel is holding toxic waste they can't find a market for
12
Jacob shakes his head
It's not true
It's rumors
There are hedge funds with huge short positions
Jacob, you know better
You know it doesn't matter if they're rumors or not
And Robby stops walking
(') Senior year  couldn't get my mind around how all those dot coms with no earnings were worth billions of dollars and you were the one who said something that made it all clear for me
don't remember
Turning to Jacob with
"An asset's value can only be priced at its perception
" said that
Robby confirms
then
So buddy -- it don't matter if the rumors are true or not
Because in this climate
if they exist at all
then most likely
Looking his friend head on
(') you're going to cease to
533   - Jacob leaves his Murray Hill building apartment and nods to his doorman,
to the Acob -- morning to you, brother
Jacob smiles
Diego
13
And Jacob waits for the morning joke
Okay, what's the best aphrodisiac on Wall Street
don't know
Jet fuel
Diego cracks up
Jacob just shakes his head and moves on
And Jacob walks uptown
deep in thought
It's a gorgeous June Friday
Suddenly, Jacob just stops walking and stands there for a long moment
coming to a decision
And as Jacob turns around and starts heading the other way
36   / - Jacob smiles to the doorman
'm here to see Andrew Zabel
Is he expecting you
No
- The elevator opens and Andrew Zabel appears with two adorable Bichon Frise puppies
Jacob stands
Jacob
Andy
'm sorry to come by like this but the rumors are now hitting a fever pitch and  wanted to make sure everything was okay
Zabel nods and heads for the door
Come on
- As they enter through the gates of the park and walk
14
Is everything okay
And Andrew Zabel doesn't seem all there
introspective and blank
remember when the starter gave me this bushy hair twelve year old kid and  said; "Donny, what the fuck -- give me a real caddy
" And he said; "This kid's the best
" -- And you were
You had the wind down, the grade of every green
What's going on
But you wouldn't shut up about stocks
Twelve years old and you blabbed on and on about companies and sectors and earnings
Andy, are we going under
What was that piece of shit you loved
That airline equipment supplier who was branching out into car airbags-- Flour Controls
Are you okay
Zabel laughs
Flour Controls
what a dog
Why did you give me that bonus
Zabel stops walking and faces Jacob with
Because  know you, Jacob
And  know you've been holding off because you didn't think you had enough
We all do that
postpone life until we believe we have what it takes to actually live it
15
There isn't a better money-runner on the street
we'll get through this
Marry her, Jacob
And have children with her and spend as much time as you can with them
and never forget that that's what's important
And Jacob
Moore
looking his boss head on
Andrew, if there's anyway  can help -- give back the bonus -- whatever
all you have to do is say the word
And Zabel just looks away
There's just so much you don't know, Jacob
,  /  - The normally very loud and frenetic place is very quiet and sober today
They all watch Alexis Glick report
(  ) Rumors of insolvency have hit the street concerning 's books and they're shooting first then asking questions later
The stock is now trading just a bit over thirty one dollars a share, down almost forty four percent on the session
And standing in the center of the floor, watching this
Stunned
horrified
his universe becoming unglued
And he turns to Audry
helpless and in shock
Who did this to us
She can only shrug
tears in her eyes
Jacob shifts his gaze over to the trading floor's electronic ticker on the wall
$26
34
-$29
57
And he moves for the elevator banks
unable to take it anymore
- Furious, Jacob walks down 6th ave with his phone to his ear
16
Andrew, call me back
'm going to find out who did this to us
swear to God
if it's the last thing  do
() We're going to bounce back from this
And we're going to find out who spread the rumor
and then we're going to destroy them
He disconnects the call and keeps walking
After a beat, with his anger brewing
Jacob  his phone down on the ground and it shatters
'  - Jacob lays on his couch vacantly pondering the ceiling
Fox Business plays on the new plasma tv on the wall
footage of     , a tough looking man in his 40s, speaking to the press outside of The State Capitol
() don't know anything about the solvency of Keller Zabel
do know that what's bringing down the stock at this precise moment are rumors
And this practice of short selling American financial institutions then floating rumors in order to profit from them must be stopped
The uptick rule must be reinstated
Jacob glares over to the tv
() (') And once again,  will point to largely unregulated world of hedge funds
an ever-growing and increasing powerful area of the market that  repeatedly tried to regulate as Chairman of the
And there's a loud knock on the door
Jacob ignores it
() (') And the collapse of this legendary New York financial institution is why continue to fight that battle as Governor of this great state
Another knock
this time louder
Jacob mutes the tv
What
From the door
17
() Jacob
answer the door
Jacob gets up, moves slowly and answers the door
(') You weren't answering your phone
It broke
Robby sharply nods
Dude
He stops short
swallows
What
just found this out and it hasn't hit the press yet
Once again
he stops short and looks away in frustration
What
Robby, what are you trying to say
Andrew Zabel threw himself in front of the subway this morning
Jacob just stands in that doorway
No reaction at all
Absolutely frozen
'  - Jacob now stands in the center of his apartment
Completely in shock
As he looks to the plasma
Fox Business on mute
Brian Sullivan reporting under the graphic  $19
34
- $37
28
He glares at it for a long moment, then
almost calmly picks up a chair and throws it into the tv
which shatters
And Jacob
not sure what to do
Until
he turns and sees
on the dresser
a gorgeous engagement ring sitting in an open box
a fuck you ring
/ - As Jacob bounds the steps of the Business School and heads into the old stone building
18
/   - The lecture hall is packed with wall to wall students
Jacob stands at the back
is at the podium
Our speaker today has quite a checkered background in the world of finance
Some laughter from the room
(') He graduated from City College in 1966 and became a securities broker at Hudson River Bank then moved on to Smith Barney
In 1973 he went out on his own to establish a spectacular career as a independent trader then an active participant in the  craze of the 1980s
() In 1988, he was indicted for insider trading and then charged with other various forms of securities fraud and violations
In one of the most harshest sentences ever given to a white collar criminal
he served fourteen years in a maximum security prison and he wants me to stress that it was not a country club
Again laughter from the floor
(') Since his release in 2002, he has written and has spoken publicly about what he refers to as the current state of the world economy
He is not allowed to trade on the  exchanges
His new book "Moral Hazard
Why Wall Street Has Finally Gone Too Far
" comes out in October
() Please welcome
Gordon Gekko
The room applauds
and out to the podium slowly walks
No swagger in his step
not in a suit
hair not slicked back
but still looks fucking good
As he waits for the applause to wind down
and even a little longer
surveying every corner of the large room
commanding its full attention
getting it
holding the silence
until finally
he leans into the mic and says
19
You're all pretty much fucked
The room breaks into laughter
Gordon smiles and waits for it to die down
(') What's not funny is what's happening out there
don't think people get it
And  know the financial center of the world doesn't get it
which happens to be Washington  now
As he takes to a pace
(') To understand where we are, we need to understand how we got here
No good deed goes unpunished, all fires start with a well meaning spark and we wanted Americans to be able to afford homes
Sounds nice enough
lets try to get the middle and lower classes into homes they can own
So we made money cheap and lowered restrictions on mortgage lending
As he takes a moment and looks over the room
(') Somebody reminded me the other night that  once said "greed is good
" swear  don't remember it but it sounds like something  would say in the Eighties
() And  was right then
Greed was good
America needed greed and risk-taking and leverage to get to become the superpower we are
or were
And capitalism needed greed and risk and leverage to become the economic platform it has become
but those same attributes that got us there are now the liabilities that threaten to destroy us
Jacob's blackberry vibrates and he checks it
He has a text
"
-- wtf
" (') So greed has been redefined
Who knows -- maybe it was always like this and like everything else in this world, it's good and it is evil
Taking a moment to survey the room
20
(') Because people -- it's greed that caused someone who aspires to own a seven-hundred thousand dollar house they can't afford, to take on a loan they'll never be able to pay back
and it's greed that caused their mortgage lender to give them that loan then sell it right away
and it's greed that caused the buyer of that loan to slice it into a million little pieces then spit them all over the world
and it's greed that caused the rating agency to give that toxic loan a triple- rating just because it was mixed in with some good loans
and it's greed that caused the insurance company to insure that loan
Jacob quickly glances down again at his blackberry and checks the quote,  $14
53
(') They were insuring the end of the world; "When the world explodes
just find us in the rubble and we'll be sure to pay your claim
" Drawing in a deep breath
(') 's, 's, 's, 's, 's, 's, 's,'s, 's, 's, toxic traunches, ninja loans, credit default swaps, affinity marketing, stapled financing, synthetic securitization
() Maybe  was in prison too long but have no idea what half that shit means
The room laughs in agreement
(') And 'm considered a pretty smart guy when it comes to finance
And Jacob's blackberry vibrates again
This time he removes it from his pocket, doesn't check it and simply turns it off
(') And if  know our central bank -- which  do --  predict it's going to throw gasoline on this fire with more cheap money and federal bailouts and --- statistics on productivity and inflation
And Gordon stops pacing
takes a moment for effect
21
Then sums it all up with
(') So no good deed goes unpunished and all fires start with a well-meaning spark and when you take free money and no lending standards then add it with unaccountable risk and ungodly leverage and unbridled greed
what you end up with is cancer
And Gordon takes in a deep breath
(') Systemic, malignant and global
Now the room is completely silent
(') Do they still have the & restaurant on Amsterdam
Is that still there
stunned girl in the front row shakes her head
(') (with a smile) God,  loved their pizza
- Jacob looks on as Gordon is surrounded by professors and students alike
(announcing to the throng) 'll give you six minutes then really have to go
-  6 Gordon quickly walks out with his , a woman in her 40s and heads into the quad
Jacob immediately matches their stride
Mr
Gekko, can  speak to you for a moment
As he keeps walking
You're too late, Sport
&'s over
My name is Jacob Moore and 'm dating your daughter
( ) 'm going to ask her to marry me
And this makes Gordon stop and finally face Jacob with
22
'll give you nine minutes
112TH  - As Gordon and Jacob leave the campus and take to the street
Keller, Zabel
Then you have my apologies
Yeah
Stock's in a free fall
My guess is that it just lost its Bar Mitzvah
Jacob quickly takes out his blackberry, turns it on and checks to see Gordon's right
$12
54
(') By the end of the day it might not even be potty trained
And Jacob looks at him
(') might not be allowed to trade, Jake, but  still love to watch from home
Andrew Zabel took me under his wing when  was in high school
He basically got me my scholarship to Yale then hired me right out of business school
Andrew's smart, he beats the benchmarks consistently
He'll land on his feet
He's dead
And Gordon stops walking and regards Jacob
Who confirms
(') He killed himself this morning
As that registers
'm sorry to hear that
He was a father to me
23
And Jacob coldly shakes it off then sucks in a deep breath and looks into Gordon's eyes
genuine and lofty
(') love your daughter very much and would be honored if
And realizing what this is
Gordon starts to laugh
which throws Jacob off
(') you would bless--  really don't understand what you find so funny
My daughter hasn't spoken to me for eleven years and you know it
She blames me for her brother's overdose and every other disaster that's fallen upon the world since the mid-nineties
() And by the way, isn't it strange that Winnie would date a guy from the street
What
She hates me
And she hates Wall Street and everything it represents
so don't you find it curious that she would fall in love with you
And that slams into Jacob
who's frozen for a beat
Jacob finally snaps out of it then joins Gordon
(') So you want my blessing
Yes
guess  should know a little about you first
Where did you grow up
Matinecock
'm impressed
It wasn't like that
mean we didn't have much money
My mother was a tailor
24
And your father
what did he do
Disappear
And Gordon regards Jacob for a long moment, taking him in, until
Clever
Jacob looks down the street
(') What are you looking for
Your town car
With a laugh
Well, pal
As Gordon pats Jacob on the back
(') then you're going to be looking for quite awhile
and heads for the subway
110TH    - Gordon takes out his wallet and produces his metrocard
Jacob notices a picture of Winnie in the wallet
( ) Can  see that
Gordon shrugs and shows the picture to Jacob
It's of a young Winnie and younger Gordon on the back of a gorgeous white horse
She was eight in that one
It was taken in Egypt
Can
have it
() She doesn't keep pictures from her childhood
Gordon slowly nods
25
What do  get in return
You
wanna make a trade
And Gordon thinks about, then
Yes
'll give you this picture and in return
'd like a picture of Winnie
taken recently
without you in it
don't have one on me
Gordon sighs, takes the picture out of his wallet and hands it to Jacob
Then 'll give you this one on margin
As they wait for the train
Jacob produces the ring box and opens it to show Gordon the ring
really did come to ask for your blessing
No, you didn't
Nice ring
As the train arrives
(') It's so typical
(inside of an ironic laugh) Levered to the hilt
and with the ship going down
As he gets on
(') they still gave you a bonus
3  - Gordon stares at a one sheet advertisement on the wall
And he doesn't look at Jacob when he says
Don't play me, Jake
You don't think can see it in your eyes
You don't think  know that look
() () 26
(') know it by sight, Kid
because lived it for years
Christ,  can even smell it on you
Smell what on me
Revenge
Jacob just looks away
(') Some hedgehog said bad things about your company
It caused the stock to plummet and made those bad things become true
And Jacob now sees the poster that has Gordon's attention
It features a pile of money being blown out the window under the caption that reads
"If this looks familiar to you
it's because you're renting
" (') The man you loved like a father threw himself in front of the uptown five this morning and you want to bring that hedgehog to their knees
You knew he was dead
"Guardian Mortgage
Low down payments
Adjustable rates
" Like  said --  still love to watch from home
And now Gordon turns to face Jacob with
(') So don't insult me by pretending to ask for Winnifred's hand when what you really want to know is who to bring down to their knees and how to do it
And Jacob swallows that back
doesn't argue it
know who
Really
It was either Nassim Tariq from the Frontier Fund, Bretton Woods from Locust or Karen Molina from
27
Does Winnie even know you came to see me
Well, not exactly
() But 'm going to tell her
Not such a grand idea, Pal
Off Jacob's confusion
(') See,  have a feeling you're going to want to see me again
And if you tell her we had this little pow-wow
she's not going to let that happen
As Jacob considers that
the train slows to a stop
(') Look, you seem like a smart kid
() Walk away, dust off your resume and get another job
As he steals one last glance at that Guardian Mortgage ad
(') but do it quick
And with that, Gordon moves for the doors
But Jacob steps in front of him
'm going to bring them down
Whoever floated the rumor for a quick buck
It's not worth it
It's a waste of energy and time
See, Jacob, nobody gets it
they never did
As the subway doors open
(') If there's one thing  learned in prison it's that money is not the prime commodity in our lives
time is
() And your nine minutes are up
And Gordon Gekko gets off the subway
leaving Jacob on the train
But right before the doors close, Gordon stops and turns with

Bretton nods

you didn't make money off it
That's right
Then why did you do it
You destroyed my firm
Your firm destroyed itself
You killed Andrew Zabel
Andrew Zabel killed himself
And Bretton sighs
(') The rumors were true
You made them true
No, Jacob, being levered thirty-eight to one in toxic debt made them true

heads for the door without saying a thing
(') Come work for me
Jacob stops and turns

And Jacob takes a beat
processing this
Why me
Because your loyalty desired revenge, your balls actually attempted it and your skills pulled it off

What's your number
Excuse me
The amount of money you would need to be able to walk away from it all and just live happily-ever-after

Well, Chief
you seem awfully proud of yourself
How'd you know about Amlyn
Gordon shrugs
It's amazing what information you can find out when people know you're not going to trade on it
So, you didn't use me to make a little money
And never to look up from his lunch
Naw
prefer to write about the action now than be apart of it
Why'd you give it to me
You're out of a job and most likely going to marry my daughter figured you could use the money

You didn't trade it
With a smile in and over-the-top faux innocence
That would've been insider trading, Mr
Gekko
Gordon just shakes his head

So did you take my advice and not tell your new fiance about our little friendship
Jacob doesn't say anything

Claus didn't get enough credit

It's of two men rowing a boat in a lake of dollars
One of the men is Uncle Sam dressed in  flag colors
But Sam's very small in this cartoon
can't really row the boat
The other man is much bigger and clearly doing the heavy rowing
He is
Morgan

Everyone else quickly followed like lemmings

They looked to  Morgan
It was all about simple psychology -- every crash should have a  Morgan to step in and save it

How do you know that

He just looked at me and said
"it never went from worthless to valuable
just the opinions of it did

Inside of a tired sigh

And Bretton just sits there
enjoying his scotch while taking in the Stones tune

looking out onto the Victoria embankment and on the phone with
Good work, kid -- you're on the inside now
He's going to Dubai to raise some money then meeting me in New York to set me up
Gordon sits at the dining room table at his apartment
Papers scattered about and his  waiting patiently
No
What
He's not meeting you in New York
Why not
Because you need to go to Dubai with him

) You need to do something that will earn his trust
you need to make yourself a hero

(
) Jacob
you need to help him get this money
And Jacob glares at Bretton like he might kill him
(
) (') But be cautious
Your relationship with Bretton is still fragile -- you fuck it up here and you're done
Bretton looks up and Jacob immediately replaces his glare with a smile
Looks better than meals  get on United
John's Pizza on Bleeker
It crossed the Atlantic with you yesterday
Would you like a slice
Jacob declines
then
(') appreciate you wanting to help with this part of the business even though it's not your expertise
Well -- there's a lot  can learn from you
For this trip just stay in the background and observe
As Bretton tosses some pizza to Contango and Backwardation
(') We're going to meet with Oleg Bakunin
He's a Russian oligarch on the run because Putin wanted to steal everything he owns
He already has a few hundred million with us but 'm looking to get half a billion more

Bretton takes a call on his Vertu

Bretton's enjoying every second of this

Oh Jacob
you don't want to live in a glass house if you're gonna play this game

Yes sir
What'd he do

it's full-on speakeasy vibe
It's right out of 1928, only with Europeans, Russians and Middle-Easterners
Smoke fills the room
jazz band roars
Drinks flow
As Jacob and Bretton head in
If he offers you a drink -- take it
And with that, Bretton points across the room where sits
(') If he offers you a line of coke -- snort it
He's in his mid-40s, overweight, sweaty, draped in tight black Prada and smoking a cigarette
64
(') If he offers you a child -- raise it
And it seems    has recently exploded at Oleg's table
leaving the skinny shards everywhere
Oleg sees them, stands and opens his arms
Bretton Woods has arrived
Bretton smiles
They head over
Oleg turns to one of the next to him
(') want you to meet one of the only men in the world who might be as rich as am
Wait a minute
Bretton what did oil close at today
hundred and twenty-nine dollars a barrel
(to Model Girl) Forget what  said -- 'm much richer than him
Oleg then looks at Jacob
(') Who the fuck is this
Oleg, 'm Jacob Moore
It's nice to meet you
Oleg regards Jacob for a beat, then back to Bretton and asks again
Who the fuck is this
Bretton smiles
Jacob has recently come over from to work with me
And now Oleg turns to Jacob
You worked with Andrew Zabel
Jacob takes a beat
Then
That's right
65
He was a legend
Jacob just nods, not showing any emotion
Oleg motions for the girls to make room and they all sit
(') It was that mortgage shit
He should've just focused on managing money and not fuck around with that crazy mortgage shit
Bretton just looks away
Jacob stays cool
(') It was a shame his fund was only for institutions
would've liked to have invested
Oleg motions to a  who immediately pours vintage champagne
(') In honor of the theme tonight, have a glass of 1927 Heidsiek champagne
Oleg hands Jacob a flute before he can decline
(') This is one of two hundred bottles discovered on a shipwreck off the coast of Finland
thirty grand a bottle
And Oleg aggressively puts his arm around Jacob, bringing him into a drunken half-bear hug and spilling most of the champagne out of Jacob's flute

Jacob, Bretton and Oleg are on divans, the girls undulating around them
Bretton,  have
what
two hundred million with you
And hopefully that's just a start
Oleg, there are so many opportunities out there right now  feel like a kid in the candy store
Oleg waves him off
You know  like to spread it around
'm like my own fund of funds don't like to have too much with one manager
As Oleg shakes cocaine out of an envelope
(') You never really know who to trust in this world
Jacob takes a beat, swallows nervously, then
couldn't agree more, Oleg
It's one of the first things that Andrew Zabel taught me
worked very closely with him
It's why Bretton hired me
To get behind the Andrew Zabel curtain
Bretton flashes Jacob a look
"What the hell are you doing
" Jacob swallows back some nerves then continues
(') You said before that you always wanted to invest with Zabel but couldn't because he only handled institutional money
Well here's your chance
Zabel taught me everything he knew
Oleg looks up to Jacob from the line of coke with interest
67
Such as
Well, 'm not going to give you the whole cake, Oleg
He looks over to Bretton who still glares at Jacob
(') But  can give you a little bite
() It involves building positions in high yielding stocks new to volatility then writing calls with split strike prices
And Oleg regards Jacob for a long moment, a jury determining the verdict
Jacob holding on to that sly smile
Bretton looking away
playing it cool
(') It's complicated but like Bretton said -- right now there are more opportunities than ever
Oleg simply nods
with a simple
Interesting
then does another line
'  - Jacob sleeps
There's a knock on his door
He stirs
The knock's louder
Then
Jacob finally wakes, moves to the door and opens it to see
,  and We're here for the party
Confused
What party
Oleg said you needed a party
Cozying up to her friend with a smile
and we're it
Jacob nervously thinks, then
68
Come in
'  - We pan across the suite
past the roaring fire
(
) Right there
past the empty bottle of champagne
(
) No
not there
(
) How about there
bet you want me to do it there
past the plate of half-eaten chocolate strawberries
(
) No
want you to hold it
And find the three of them

) But it's gone up so much
sitting at Jacob's computer
looking over a chart for a Russian oil company

but if you're going to correctly utilize this technical head and shoulders strategy, you need to hold the stock until

Very common mistake
You need to cut your losers short and let your winners run
She looks to her friend with a smile
Good advice for everything
no
Her friend agrees with a laugh
And Jacob checks the clock
Okay
think enough time has passed
appreciate you guys keeping our little secret

You must love her very much

No
She's Bretton's go-to
He flies her in wherever he's at
And Jacob slowly takes that in
absolutely floored
/ - Wearing sunglasses, Jacob greets Bretton at the elevators
You look like crap
They walk for the exit
(') Let me ask you something
was that speech about split strike prices and stocks new to volatility for real
No Bretton
That was all bullshit

Bretton smiles
Well, it worked

72
(') So you're inside
you have his trust
and now you want to know what's next
And Jacob's look over to Gekko confirms this
(') Here's the thing about Bretton
He puts all of his money into his own fund which makes him stupid, egotistical, and most importantly
vulnerable
() And he chases
He doesn't take losses well and he chases with leverage
He thinks he's a trader, he thinks he's an investor but he's not
He's a gambler
Regarding Jacob

Jacob just shrugs
(') Care to make a trade
Whatever

Winnie nods
It's a valid question
And she thinks about it for a moment, then
Repetition compulsion
Huh
It's Freud
And what does it mean, psych major
Well, it's when people repeat the same dysfunctional relationships from childhood in their adult life in hopes of trying to master them
Like when children of alcoholics fall in love with alcoholics
Yeah
He turns away

That's great, Winnie
Jacob, that might be why  was initially attracted to you

Keep up

it's definitely a race
Bretton pulls ahead but Jacob doesn't give up
As they move quickly toward a patch of forest with a only narrow trail entering it, Jacob focuses on the horizon and revs the bike into more speed
He pulls up next to Bretton as they approach the trail
If Jacob doesn't slow down, and fall in line behind Bretton, he's going to hit the trees
But he doesn't
Instead, Jacob blasts the bike into its final dose of speed, narrowly avoiding impact by zipping into the trail
pulling ahead of Bretton and taking the lead

Untouched by man
Bretton and Jacob get off the bikes and walk to the shore

The definition of rich

The table reacts
some agree, other don't
George turns to Jacob

What do you think
To be rich
is to have the love of a good woman
They all boo

And Jacob turns to Bretton

what's your definition of rich
An approaching voice answers it for him
(
) To have twice as much money as you currently do
As he takes a seat
Isn't that what you always say, Bretton
Then
announcing to the table
(') He brings up the question, runs it round the table then finishes with that
It's an old bit
Also announcing to the table
Be careful Gordon

That's right

No,  don't suppose you did
Bretton looks over to Jacob

Bretton leans back
taking in this sparring match
(') Really Gordon
Do you really need attention that badly
Since  have forty-four seconds to spare, 'm going to tell you a story
It's about a guy named Sam
And we go close on Gekko
(') Sam used to work a job, he made things and he grew things and he sold those things
Until one day Sam got a credit card and was amazed how easy it was to buy things with it
So Sam got another card and then another
Then he used the credit card money to make it look like he had an income
and he used that "income" to secure a loan
() 92
(') And with that loan Sam bought a fancy car and rented a fancy penthouse apartment
() Now, the credit cards hit their limit and the bank needed him to service that loan, so Sam went to his friends
His Chinese friend
and his Japanese friend
and his British friend and so on
And his friends loaned Sam money
( ) And that brings us to today
where Sam owes the credit cards and Sam owes the banks and Sam owes his friends and eventually they're going to take away Sam's fancy  car and his fancy penthouse apartment
And Jacob can now see
in Gordon Gekko's eyes
he truly believes every word he's saying
(') And Sam doesn't make anything anymore and Sam doesn't grow anything anymore so Sam doesn't sell anything anymore
As he stands
(') Our favorite Uncle Sam's desperate, Jake
and he just found a printing press in his basement
() So you tell me -- where do we go from here
And with that, Gordon Gekko goes

That he can't just take his ball and go home

Gordon stops walking

This can't possibly be the man my daughter fell in love with

Why
Because nobody gave a shit about me before Andrew Zabel came along
Because he didn't deserve what he got
The universe is an efficient market, Kid
we all get what we deserve
Did you
Now it's Gordon who looks away

and know how that motivates
But Jacob
he wasn't such a Saint

And Jacob now steps forward

Bretton skeptically regards Jacob
Why are you doing this
Because  got you into those insurance companies
because  let you down
And Bretton
biting his lip in thought
don't like the mortgage toxic waste
It can't be quantified

worked it out already
You wouldn't have to take it
How'd you do that
Well, Wells won't insure the Zabel institutional money

Then who would take on the mortgage securities

Uncle Sam
Bretton slowly nods

And how could Winnie get it now
Hadley stops walking and thinks about it
Well, she'd have to sign a reversion of trust document
That way the funds would revert back to their pre-trust posture and regulations
So all she has to do is sign a piece of paper
Basically
As that registers
How much is in there
It's complicated
There's private equity ownership, real estate, a very large position in a bank
all sorts of investment vehicles

Gordon would have to sign the document as well

Everyone's buying his book and waiting to see his next move
Desperately trying to get her mind around this
But what about the , the regulatory agencies--
The government is flying this 700 billion dollar airplane by the seat of it's pants
They don't know where half of the fucking money is going
And even if they did, do you think they want this out there
As this all washes over her
This is his revenge
Yup
sure beats the hell out of insider trading, doesn't it
And Winnie finds her keys and heads for the door
can't hear anymore of this
but Jacob steps in front of her
'm done
sold everything
The ring
Everything
gave back the bonus
'm out and 'm broke and deserve it
And she just looks at him
(') But Winnie, the one thing  can't accept -- is losing you
And before she reacts
As a circle forms on Nov 6th then travels quite a ways then finally stops
Unfortunately, this slope down the & trendline is quite pronounced

And as a circle is formed around Jan 24th 2009, we
: 777 As Jacob opens up a copy of Barron's
Gekko on the cover under the caption "What's His Next Move
" In an official office of our Federal Reserve Bank, proudly signing the documents
Dubai in the background
Jacob waits against a bench
And across the way he sees
approaching him
Gordon Gekko
Did you see Barrons
You finally got the cover
Gordon nods
(') Everybody thinks you got rich of betting against the system
If they only knew
The powers that be will never let that happen
Jacob's not arguing it
How much is enough, Gordon
Gordon laughs with a shake of the head
've been asked that before
( ) They took a hundred, twenty two thousand, six hundred and forty hours from me
for a goddamn victimless crime
All the while  sit in my 8 by 12 and watch real crooks by the thousands give out mortgages like candy, package them into unexplainable derivatives and spit the cancer out into the world
And he just shakes his head
120
(') And when  get out
who's there waiting for me
Nobody
() You better believe 'm going to get mine
You're not going to miss America
'll always have America
it's why 'm here
'm buying the island
() know it's kitschy but it's fun and good for business
Looking over the water
(') have a lot business abroad now
Interests in an Australian copper mine, a German solar company, some Russian oil pipelines, a casino in Macau
see Jake, America just isn't where the action is anymore
What happened to the precious depreciating asset of time
It still trades
And he turns to Jacob with a smile
(') but 'm a billionaire now, Pal
'm out, Gordon, 'm done trading
don't know why
You pulled it off, Kid, you took him down -- granted with my help -- but you atoned for Zabel's sins with Bretton's money
() As  see it, you're just getting started
And Jacob stops walking then slowly turns to Gordon with
Did you ever really want to reconcile with her
(of course  did) 'm human
121
Glaring at him
Then why did you do it
And Gordon
strongly holding Jacob's glare
simply replies
Same answer
But it didn't work
Gordon sadly shrugs
've been trying to wire two hundred million into her bank account but she won't accept it
know
She doesn't want it
we don't want it
() Because it's not about what you have
it's about what you do
And Gordon -- it's never about the money
Gordon shakes his head
That sounds good
bet you can even wrap it in a pretty red bow
But Champ, it's idealistic
and idealism kills every trade
() Winnie will realize that at some point
and then we'll be fine
And Jacob finally looks away
in pity
(') See Jacob -- the hustle we all fall for is actually thinking we can fight what's inherent, what's inevitable
that we can somehow undo what genetics, or God, or whatever name you wanna tag it, has placed deep inside of us
Because whether it's greed or revenge or the compulsion to chase
it all amounts to the same thing
loss of control
And it's always going to be there and it's always going to be stronger than you, Pal
Now walking again
122
(') It's why bubbles will always exist and it's why we're all currently in this mess
Joining Gordon's stride
Winnie's pregnant
And Gordon stops walking
(') It's going to be a boy
What do you want
It's bad out there, Gordon, people are panicked
They're not looking to their government
They're not looking to their trusted advisors
They're looking to you
You want me to buy
And Jacob Moore
slowly confirming
Publicly and aggressively
Gordon just looks at him
(') But they're all lemmings
Simple psychology
You once said every crash should have a  Morgan to step in and save it
() Well Gordon -- this is your chance to be  Morgan
And now Gordon shakes his head
We're far from the bottom
It'll be a dead cat bounce
It'll buy us time
That's all 'm asking for
time
() Time for the new administration to put their plan into action
What do  get in return
123
As Gordon turns
takes in the city of Dubai
in all of its ridiculous splendor
Full clemency
You can offer that
Your daughter can
She works with the new Secretary of Treasury now
Considering that
What else
Winnie
Me
Your grandson
Something money can't buy
a family
And Gordon looks at him for the longest moments, allowing it all to register, then
Sorry son -- that's simply a trade cannot make
And as Gordon Gekko walks off
leaving Jacob Moore behind

Us
The human race
Scientists call it the Cambrian Explosion, from the Cambrian fauna
As Jacob heads into the baggage claim area to see Winnie waiting for him

when all of the sudden, there was the seemingly rapid appearance of most major groups of complex animals
And as they embrace

Being led through a massive empty space

Scientists will tell you it was unprecedented, excessive and by the standards of evolution-time

The City of London outside the large windows
(') Suddenly the world had millions of new species
just like that
This will be the home of his new international empire
At his desk in his 15  penthouse
(
) (') See -- bubbles are the purest form of Darwinism
looking over pages and pages of destruction
Andrew Zabel's legacy that he now has to pay for
(
) (') They teach us what we didn't know and they remind us of what we forgot
And Bretton completely loses it
just starts ripping out the pages then tearing them in two
(
) (') They kill excess and they lean out the herd
methodically
page by page
over and over again
Sitting in his massive London office
It's empty
It's night
He's completely alone
He looks up at the wall
at the framed picture of  Morgan and Uncle Sam rowing that boat
Then he looks down at an old picture of Winnie
she's probably three or four years old
and lovingly holding her baby brother, Rudy
And Gordon holds on this picture for a long moment, before finally

As the door opens, daylight spills in and we see the charging bull of Bowling Green Park across the way
Gordon is escorted out of the car and led to the doors of the New York stock exchange
And Gordon stops at the famed doors, takes a moment to regard the exchange, sucks in a deep breath, readies for his hero's welcome and finally
opens the doors then disappears inside
Greet the morning in their small Washington  apartment
Winnie pouring coffee, Jacob turning on the
