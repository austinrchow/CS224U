car chugs over the horizon
As far as con man stories go, think 've heard them all
Of grifters, ropers, faro fixers, tales drawn long and tall
But if one bears a bookmark in the confidence man's tome, twould be that of Penelope, and of the brothers Bloom

-                                   2 The car deposits two shabby boys (10 & 13) in front of a country house
Both in black
Each with a suitcase
At ten and thirteen Bloom and Stephen (the younger and the old) 3

had been through several foster families
The   slaps Bloom upside the head
Stephen across the table, tackling the dad and beating the crap out of him
(cont'd) Thirty eight, all told

-                                4 - "Bloom" stamped on it
It opens, and dozens of reports flip by
Under the "    " field we catch different entries: " ", "", " ", "  ", " "
4   :                                                  4 Mischief moved them on in life, and moving kept them close

5 The brothers on the porch, suitcases in hand
For Bloom had Stephen, Stephen Bloom, and both had more than most
The front door opens, and a pair of   eye the brothers suspiciously
6
-                         6 wide dusty Main Street, which the two brothers survey
Another home, another main street
Stephen looked around, then summed the burgh up thusly: Bloom, we've hit a one hat town
One theater
One car wash
One cafe
One park
One cat
Which, through some mishap, had one leg
The cat sits on a roller skate, rowing itself down the street with its one leg
Sweet Jesus
Look at that

-                                             7 group of children flee the school joyfully
One school, which meant one tight- knit group of local well-off kids
8
8 The children run out of the candy store, all slurping Rocket Pops
Their pocket-change bought rocket pops, 9
9 The brothers at the counter
Bloom watches the children go, while Stephen counts out pennies
The brothers, Stephen slaps the change down angrily and points with a scowl
Pixie Stix
10
10 The children play, resplendent with their Rocket Pops
They were the `they'
All well loved, rooted, happy as you please
Bloom and Stephen sit off to the side of the park, none too happy nursing their Pixie Stix
(cont'd) Always there
In every town
Stephen glares, flicks the Stix away like a cigarette
The playground bourgeoisies
He storms off
Bloom lingers, staring silently at the children
11
11 The brothers amble down a wooded path
Bloom stops, staring into the trees
Through the dense thicket of foliage
the children playing
And one gleaming eye framed perfectly through a small open patch in the leaves
Bloom pushes the leaves aside
girl
Golden curls
Summer dress
Standing in the distance on a wide lawn
Bloom gazes
Stephen places his hand on Bloom's back
12
-                                        12 Bloom stumbles from the trees (very much as if he's been shoved) and regains his footing and freezes, not shielded at all now from the playing kids and the girl
Could he simply (
) Talk to her
Just drop his fears and go
Leave his brother in the woods, and join the children
The girl makes eye contact, twisting a daisy chain between her tiny fingers
Bloom's adam apple convulses
He turns tail and runs back into the woods
(cont'd) No
13
-                                          13 Brothers in bed
Bloom gazes window-ward
Stephen gazes Bloom- wise, shuffling a pack of cards
What's doing
What
13   :                                                    13 You shuffle when you're thinking something through
So whatcha thinking
Not a thing
This wasn't really true
Cause in the root of Stephen's psyche, something now began
seed of grand epiphany
hook
tale
14
-                                                 14 plan
Stephen spreads out a hand-drawn flowchart on a stump, and talks Bloom through it
fiction made for profit, in which both boys played a part
simple con in fifteen steps
And this is where we start
Stephen runs his finger backwards down the connected boxes, each neatly numbered, stopping at #1
"Bloom Talks To Girl" 15
-                                                  15 Children and the gold haired Girl playing
The wall of foliage where the forest begins shimmers
And then, as if a curtain had been pulled back from the sky
Some barrier within the younger Bloom was broken
Bloom bursts through the trees and strides across the wide lawn, confident, glowing, stopping face to golden face with the girl
15   :                                                   15 Hi
They talk
They run
They laugh
They play
So Bloom performed his role in Stephen's story to a
#2 on the flowchart - "Bloom wins the kids' trust" 16
16 Bloom does indeed, sitting and laughing with a circle of kids, suddenly a natural born charmer
And being who he wasn't, could be as he wished to be
The Golden Girl smiles at him
From the shadows of an adjacent alley, Stephen watches, pleased
He slinks away
- 17
-                                               17 #3 - "Stephen finds a cave" dissolves to Stephen scouting out a cave deep in the woods
18
-                                               18 In the park, Bloom runs with the kids, laughing
19
-                                     19 #5 - "Stephen buys supplies" dissolves to: Stephen in a hardware store, pointing
flashlight, snow boots and several large coolers are purchased
20
-                                               20 Back in the park, Bloom says goodnight to the kids and walks homeward in the warm twilight
21
-                                             21 #8 - "Stephen scouts church" dissolves to: Stephen's eyes poke up from behind a pew in a church
He manages to look devious as he snags a
22
-                                          22 Bloom enters, hears running water from the bathroom
He glimpses down at the flowchart on the bed, scanning down to: Box #10 - "Bloom comes home to find Stephen filling the coolers" Stephen backs out of the bathroom trolling a heavy cooler
Oh - kay
How's it going on the playground front
It's great
So, on to step eleven, then
The Tale
You tell them - Wait
Bloom's lip quivers, obviously conflicted
Must the numbers rattle on
Must the fiction end
think  need more time to win their- Bloom
They're not your friends
They're part of this, and this aint real
Remember, it's a con
And when it's done, we've just got us
And we'll be moving on
(beat) So, the tale
You tell them there's a 23
-                                            23 Bloom holds court with the kids
hermit in the woods
one eyed, steel toothed vagabond
24
24 Back to Bloom and Stephen in the attic with blood red eyes
(nods) That's good
He stopped you coming home from school
25
-                                            25 and told me of a cave
What kind of cave
cave of wonders
Pffft ha
Shut up, Dave
At noon on every Sunday, there appears a ball of light, which flutters like a butterfly
will-o-whisp
That's right
It guides you 26
26 if you can keep up
27
27 to where the treasures lay
So where's this cave
Yeah, where
28
28 Ah-hah
The hermit didn't say
He got this greedy glinting look, the filthy red-eyed leech
and said he'd tell for thirty bucks
Something in Bloom's face falls
29
29 The girl's bright, trusting face looking at him
moment of silence
Then, triumphant, an excited boy leaps to his feet
Well that's just two bucks each
The kids all rejoice, and fist-fulls of dollars are thrust at Bloom
He looks almost crestfallen as his eye catches the girl's joyful gaze
So Sunday came
30
30 Children in their bright Sunday clothes run through the dark woods, led by Bloom
10 30   :                                                  30 and straight from church, into the woods Bloom led
31
31 In the dim light of a cave, Stephen overturns the coolers of water and retreats into shadow
flood soaks into the dirt floor, as outside the mouth of the cave the group of panting children come into sight
They stopped
Their hearts leapt
There it was
32
32 The children look at the craggy mouth of a forboding cave
Just like the hermit said
Deep in the cave's dark maw, a spark of light
The children gasp collectively
The Girl grabs Bloom's arm
Bloom stares, transfixed as any of them
The spark becomes a glowing, fluttering point of light, which hangs in the mouth of the cave for a tantalizing moment, then recedes deeper into the gloom
With a cry the children, Bloom included, dash into the cave
33
33 The light glows just around the next corner
the children run after it, slipping in the mud, laughing, turning the corner
And the light glows just around the next corner
They scramble, they slip and slide, they can't catch the light, but they're all having the time of their lives
Bloom included
Holding the girl's hand, laughing, eyes full of wonder
11 33   :                                                  33 For just one moment, Bloom forgot himself and ran too fast
He puts on a burst of speed, gets ahead of the crowd
(cont'd) He'd catch the light and find the treasure
Turning a corner, he (alone) sees the rather tawdry image of Stephen, flashlight in hand, shooing him back as he turns the next corner
Bloom stops running
(cont'd) But the moment passed
The other kids and the girl pass him, but Bloom stands dead still, a strange expression on his face
The girl turns back towards him, still running, and holds out her hand for him to follow
But he doesn't
He stays behind, and is soon left alone
34
34 They didn't catch the will-o-wisp, but didn't really care
The muddied children walk home, laughing, while Bloom leans against a lamppost
Stephen appears behind him, counting their money
It seems to me that in the end, the perfect con is where each one involved gets just the thing they wanted
Yeah  guess so
Our fledgling thieves were satisfied
12 35
-                                       35 front door opens, revealing a porch-full of 30 angry parents holding 15 muddied kids by their ears
The children's parents, less so
The Foster Parents exchange a glance
- Stephen is smacked
The wad of money is snatched from a grubby small hand by an angry big one
telephone slams down
On a form, the field "Reason for return:" is filled with "Larceny
" 36
-                                            36 Two suitcases on a bed are snapped closed and pulled away
The bed sits solid and vacant in the dusty afternoon sunlight
bitter ending
Maybe
But there's sweetness in the mix
Beneath the bed, forgotten, a piece of paper
On it, the con flow-chart
Numbered boxes
(cont'd) The brothers Bloom had found their calling
One of the boxes
number six
(cont'd) As shown in number six
#6:   "Cut % 'Henry's" (cont'd) `Cut' meant to negotiate, `percent' percentage deal
13 37
-                                  37 Through a storefront window - rows of the children's muddy Sunday clothes hang, each tagged
`'Henry's' was the town's one dry clean shop
And striding out of the store beneath the `'Henry's Cleaners' sign is Stephen, fifty dollars in hand, sucking a Rocket Pop
The  leans out of the door, looking a little nervous
Stephen throws him back a salute
38
-                                         38 Bloom sits against a wall, suitcases beside him
Boxes of Rocket Pops, and one in each fist
Stephen plops down beside him
So how's it feel
Bloom's eye catches the children, and the girl, playing in the distance
In truth, young Bloom won't know for twenty years just how he felt
`Child Welfare' car waiting out on the street
The brothers pick themselves up
(cont'd) And so, we'll skip ahead now in our story
Stephen tosses his Rocket Pop
Let `em melt
The con man team of the brothers Bloom, suitcases in hand, strides down the alleyway
Stephen in front
14 38   :                                                 38 Bloom a few steps behind, stealing one last glance back at the children playing in the sun
: 39                                                  39 : 40
-                                          40 Flames spread over a wall of bookshelves
:    , 25 in a nice suit and bowler hat steps in front of the flaming books
He gets the scarab, you get the money,  get the girl
so in the end, everyone gets everything he wants
Three gunshots, two bloody holes in the nice suit and the young man folds to the ground
sweaty man named  (40s) lowers his gun, while behind him the rest of the library roars in flames
(
) Wha - Charleston, what - oh my god are you
oh god he's dead, Victor's dead
you've killed us
We had it he was right it was all in the bag and now we're dead, why
Why, you stupid son of a bitch
The owner of the voice, a  a bit younger than Charleston in a derby cap, snatches the gun away and slaps Charleston hard
15 40   :                                                 40 Cause the Turk was right
After seeing her, after that night on the airstrip, after Cairo everything changed, and he couldn't see the play through that one milky eye, but the Turk was right about one thing, that there's nothing beautiful about money
She's beautiful
This isn't happening
He'll never have her now
She's free
And 'll never see her in scarlet again, her chestnut hair, but it's worth the money and my job and his life and the rest of my life that she's free
Charleston
can't be here
You're not here
Neither of us are
It's Mowcher's gun
Mowcher is at the bottom of the Spree with a cowl in his neck
Charleston gets to his feet
They won't find him for a week, and the Albino will chalk it up to Davey, he won't talk
We're clean
Listen to you - four months ago you were an investment banker
Now you're nothing
The Scarab's lost
The money's gone
It'll rot in the Peruvian earth
It's gone
Charleston limps to the flaming doorway
16 40   : (2)                                            40 The man named Charleston you met nine months and a thousand years ago at the hotel bar in Jodhpur is dead
If we see each other again it'll be as strangers
As for the money
let it rot
He exits, leaving McGuire stooped beside the crumpled form of Victor
long beat
The distant roar of an engine, tires squealing
Then through the smoky doorway steps a beautiful  , early 20s
She gives a nearly imperceptible nod
Wow
He pats Victor, who sits up, spitting blood
McGuire looks to Victor and the woman for a reaction
Gets none
(cont'd) Wow is the word you're both looking for
Wow
The Asian woman nods slightly
(un-wowishly) You're a genius, Stephen
For McGuire is, of course, Stephen
We're a genius, Bloom
Just as Victor is, indeed, Bloom
He spits
Tastes like tin foil
So does real blood
Buy you a drink
Stephen escorts the Asian woman out, while Bloom wipes his lip
17 41
- -                                       41 stately house in the middle of nowhere, on fire
Stephen holds the door of a car open, while Bloom steps from the flaming house
"Four months and a thousand years ago
" That's Kipling, isn't it
He stole that from Kipling
No
42
- -                                      42 Hazy light over the sprawling city
43
43 low, cozy basement level bar
dozen people crowd it, all expectant in a surprise-party type way
in a white linen suit and eye patch raises his drink when Bloom, Stephen and the woman enter
Make way, make room for the brothers Bloom
The bar bursts into cheers
44
-                                     44 dances on the bar
Stephen plays cards with the Turk, an  and a small crowd of character types
Nine months, six countries, three faked deaths, for one mark
You're a beautiful antique, my friend
They clink glasses
Proust
18 44   :                                                      44 One thing baffles me
The entire con would have fallen apart if Charleston had walked away
How did you know he'd pull the trigger
Stephen riffle shuffles a pack of cards
Just think of any card
Got one
Stephen cuts the deck randomly - 2 of spades
No
Stephen shrugs
But if  do it enough, eventually it'll work on someone
And then it'll be the best card trick in the world
Wink
The dwarf slips, plummets from the bar
Stephen kicks a chair across the room, into which he lands with a crunch
(cont'd) Ante up
It's true you never work with the same crew twice
That's true
Well shit
Except for the uh, for her
La Chinoise
Yeah
Back at the bar - the Asian woman
The
Being hit on by a weasly
Yeah, 'm pretty big into anime
19 44   : (2)                                             44 She almost imperceptibly rolls her eyes
Our fifth Beatle
She knows the ins and the outs, and so far as can tell, speaks three words of English
She taps on the bar
Jameson
Ice
She says `no' with a look
So she's with you and Bloom till the end
Just till the wind changes
Stephen makes a gun with his finger and shoots at the Chink
She flicks a champaign flute to make a `
' and mimes the bullet bouncing off her
Where is Bloom
In the corner of the bar, in a private booth with drawn velvet curtains, Bloom sits alone playing solitaire
Stuck with a queen of hearts he can't play
beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face through the curtains
There you are
Hiding
Yeah
've been learning
Stephen likes to talk about you
Did he tell you the cave story
20 44   : (3)                                            44 Is it true
What else did he tell you
'm not going to tell it as good as Stephen
You two kicked around till your early teens, then stowed away on a merchant marine freighter and ended up in St
Petersburg, where you spent five years under the tutelage of a shadowy old swindler named the Diamond Dog
And he was your Fagin and Stephen was his Artful Dodger, but it ended suddenly and badly
Stephen took his eye out with an antique rapier
Why did he do that
And then the Brothers Bloom lit out on their own to make their fortune as gentleman thieves
Sounds romantic
It does
She pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the table, her face inches from Bloom's, eyes closed, expecting a kiss
Bloom's eyes stay open
You want to know how Stephen did it
With Charleston
It's not the first thing on my mind
21 45
-  ()                          45 replay of Bloom in front of the flaming bookshelf
(
) He positioned me in the same spot where, seven years ago, Charleston's wife stood and told him she was leaving
The room transforms, becomes daylit, not on fire, seven years ago, a  standing in Bloom's place
(
) (cont'd) He chose my outfit to mirror her suit
Sure enough, the colors and shape of Bloom's suit matches the Wife's outfit
(
) (cont'd) He even phonetically matched my final words to hers
This is the end
Charelston, you've always been a dunce
Everything snaps back to Bloom in the flaming room
( ) So in the end, everyone gets everything he wants
46
46 That's what he does, he writes his cons the way dead Russians write novels, with thematic arcs and imbedded symbolism and shit
And he wrote me as a vulnerable anti- hero
And that's why you think you want to kiss me
It's a con
He leaves Rose lying on the table and sweeps through the bar towards the exit, passing Stephen
22 46   :                                                     46 (cont'd) need air
Who doesn't
(plays a card) That's the big 2
47
-                                 47 Bloom stumbles up stone steps to street level sweeps up across the square
Bloom sits wearily on the curb, bowler hat in hand, shirt bright red with fake blood, face long as hell
Putting the broom aside a moment, the old man walks painfully across the street to Bloom
Standing nearly toe to toe with him, the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled face
He then smears his hand over his mug, pulling the smile off his face and rubbing it on Bloom's mouth
When he takes his hand away, Bloom plays along and has the same big joyful smile
The old man winks at him and walks back to his broom
As soon as the old man is away, Bloom drops the smile
Stephen paces out into the street
We missed the sunrise
That would've been nice
They walk across the street to the Tiergarten
48
-                                    48 Berlin's Central Park and zoo, dead and brown
The brothers stroll through the woods, Stephen a few steps ahead, Bloom trailing behind, lost in thought
Camel heads poke over a wall with `Kamelhaus' painted on it
Stephen throws open the wall's gate
(to camels) Back to the swamps
The camels are unimpressed
Bloom slouches into a bench
23 48   :                                                 48 Stephen shows the deck of cards to Bloom, who nods
Stephen cuts the deck, shows him a card
Bloom shakes his head, no
(cont'd) At least you're honest
Bloom stares into space
(cont'd) Alright, let's do this
Let's just get it done
So first you say `'m quitting, Stephen
'm out
' Then say
`Do we have to go through this again
' Then you make a show of putting on your jacket and say `no  mean it this time Stephen, this time 'm really out
' Then you say `let's have a drink, and in the morning Bloom you'll have come to your senses' Stephen pulls a flask, unscrews it
(re: Bloom's bright red blood stain) That's a major design flaw in fake blood, by the way
`and we'll be moving on
' Real blood turns brown after a half hour
Listen to me, Stephen
This scotch costs more than your suit

48   : (2)                                           48 Listen to me
And the flask stopped a bullet from a black powder rifle at Appomattox
Listen
Bloom bats the flask away
camel catches it, tips its camel neck back and gulps it down
That's my new favorite camel
hate you
hate this life, hate it,  hate that you won't fucking listen to me for one goddamn second
Just listen
Stephen listens
(cont'd) can't wake up next to another stranger, who thinks they know me, or even wants to know me, cause don't know - who - 'm thirty five years old, and , 'm useless, 'm crippled,  don't, 've only ever lived life through these roles that aren't me, that are written for me by you
Tell me what you want
Why
So you can write me a role in a story where  get it
You're not listening to me
want a real
thing,  wanna do things how don't know are gonna work out, a, , want, a
(sotto) You want an unwritten life
() 25 48   : (3)                                              48 want an unwritten life
(realizes Stephen just wrote that line for him) Aauuugghh god
The camel belches
Bloom makes a show of putting on his jacket
(cont'd) 'm going away
Somewhere you or even the Chink won't be able to track me down, so don't try
No more stories
Bloom tosses Stephen the bowler, and storms off
He gets about ten feet, then hesitates
(cont'd) love you
Bye
Then goes
The camel nudges Stephen's jacket, looking for more scotch
Stephen puts the bowler on its camel head
Sorry bud
'm dry
Stephen watches his brother walk off into the rising morning mist, lost in thought
His hands mechanically begin shuffling the pack of cards

-                                 49 Beautiful green hills surround the walled medieval city of Ferentino
:    Ferentino, Italy - 3 months later
tiny red car inches its way across the countryside
It winds its way up and deeper into the city on the hill
26 50
-                                 50 The tiny stone porch outside a private apartment
The red car's bumper pulls up, parks
On a small wood table, empty booze bottles and a loose pack of cards
Fingertips spread the cards, then the fingertips' owner heads for the apartment door
51
-                                 51 Stephen steps in cautiously, surveys the apartment
goddamn mess
Empty bottles and glasses, very little light
Stephen opens the curtains, light streams in the window
groan of displeasure comes from the gloom
Bloom stirs, passed out in a hammock
Unkept beard, a few extra pounds
Crushed cigar hanging on his lip
rotund  waddles in, cleaning up bottles and berating Bloom in a constant stream of angry Italian
She's right, you know
Why are you here, Stephen
Put on your face, let's eat
52
-                               52 Stephen guides a dressed Bloom out the door
The grandmother follows them, still barking angry Italian at Bloom
At the last moment she says a few kind words, kisses him on the cheek and sends them off
53
-                                      53 few tables on a stone walkway overlooking the countryside
The red car parked nearby
Stephen eats, Bloom stares
How'd you find me
27 53   :                                                      53 The Chink
How'd the Chink find me
Stephen's eyes:       "Are you joking
" How've you been
Great
've done a lot of thinking the past three months
You don't want out
You think you do but you don't
Here, c'mere
want to show you something
'm quits, Stephen
Stephen stands, strolls off
Bloom wearily follows
(cont'd) Where are we going
New Jersey
(sighs) Well lemme get my jacket
: 54
54 : 55
-                                 55 long private road through a tunnel of trees leads to a ludicrous mansion
Our trio watch it from the road
Looks like an etching from a Bronte novel
28 55   :                                                 55 Stephen flips open a first edition Jane Eyre
The illustration inside is in fact an exact match, right down to a plaster deer in the front yard
(cont'd) Huh
Look at that
Well thanks
'm gonna head back to Italy
Big money
Inheritance
Dad died early, Mom died two years ago after ten years fighting an illness that can't pronounce
How much
The Chink writes a number in the snow with a stick
Just when we think she's done, she adds several more zeros
(cont'd) Jesus
Look out
Stephen pulls Bloom into the trees as a cherry red Lamborghini roars down the private road, does an unruly donut and crunches painfully into a tree, kicking up a cloud of dust and smoke
Thumping bass from the audio system turns off, and from the dust cloud emerges , early 30s, beautiful but in a non-Lamborghini way
Bloom watches her through the trees, none too happy
56
-                                         56 Off to the side of the house
They lean on the hood of their rental car, an old school Cadillac
In the background, a tow truck arrives with a brand new Lamborghini, and leaves towing the old one
What am  doing here, Stephen have one rule, and you've never even tested it
29 56   :                                                     56 Stick with me
No women
One rule
You know we don't do women,  don't, and it's not a morality thing or- a thing- it's, whatever it is it doesn't matter what it is, that's just our rule
So what are we, (: the rental car) Did you rent a `78 Caddy
Stephen nods to the Chink
Bloom nods appreciatively
(cont'd) Controversial choice
So no, is what 'm saying
'm quits anyway
'll be in Italy
Drinking
The front door of the mansion slams, and they watch Penelope drag a harp around into the back yard
Penelope Stamp
Thirty three
Lived at home her whole life
Bloom's eyes never leave Penelope
An eccentric shut-in rich bitch
You're not helping your case
The Chink silently hands Bloom a retractable spyglass, he watches Penelope drift atop a hill and sit on a stump
She's bored, a seed in the snow
We're going to put her through a grand adventure, bring her to life
So this is the big plan
Lure me back into things with some beautiful intriguing elusive girl, stir up old memories with the prospect of redemption and rebirth
Seriously Stephen
Amateur night
Bloom watches her play Clash songs on the harp
30 56   : (2)                                            56 (cont'd) 'm not saying yes
But what's the con
Stephen spreads a folded piece of paper on a tree stump, with a flowchart on it
Numbered boxes
Bloom doesn't take his spyglass off Penelope
It's actually pretty simple
We're brothers, antique dealers, perusing the Americas for antiquities en route to someplace exciting via luxury steamer, say Greece
You tie into her and work your magic
Penelope plays on
57
-                                     57 Very late
Bloom and Stephen in armchairs, collars loosened, drinks drunk
The Chink's Chuck Taylors stick up over the back of a chair
Bloom holds the con flowchart
and so that's how it ends, in Mexico, a burst of violence then a moment of truth on the beach
What do you think
Bloom idly looks over the chart
You've got something up your sleeve
This is about me, right
Somehow
This might not be something you know, but they've all been about you
Maybe that's why they've none of them been perfect, 've never been able to give you what you really want
31 57   :                                                  57 want to be outta all this
So by definition, this is not going to give me what  want
Stephen answers by letting an ace fall from his sleeve
(cont'd) This will be the last one
You'll let me go
The Chink's inert sneakers come to life and she's on her feet, silently going to Stephen's side
will never approach you to do another con again
(to the Chink) Let's make it a red Schwinn
Bloom stares at #1 on the flowchart - "
" 58
-                                       58 grumpy Bloom perched on the red Schwinn, an ill fitting Styrofoam helmet on his head
Stephen sits in a lawn chair watching the highway below
The Chink sets up a lawn umbrella, a chair for herself, and a cooler with Coronas
There are less painful ways to cut into a mark
Wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk
Score to beat is 7
9
Keep your head in the game, the Chinese judge is tough
This is a banana seat, man
He directs this to the Chink, who blinks with innocent incomprehension and opens two Coronas
(cont'd) Don't give me that blank look, you know what a fuckin banana seat is
32 58   :                                                     58 Stephen spots something and blows a whistle
With a grunt, Bloom launches the Schwinn forward
Gaining speed, bumping over weeds and gopher holes, down the steep steep hill
At the bottom of the hill, a two lane highway
Cruising down the highway, a cherry red Lamborghini
Whose front right fender Bloom expertly smashes into
: 59
/  -                                          59 Silent and blue
Time slows to a crawl as Bloom sails through the air, arcing over the Italian luxury car's hood and past a horrified Penelope, face frozen mid scream behind the wheel
(
) There's actually a knack to this
You want to avoid dying or breaking anything that won't grow back, but you don't want to roll out of it and come up roses
If you're trying to fast track into a mark's sympathies, there's nothing quite as efficient as having your first conversation be from a hospital bed they put you in
usually like to try for a dislocated shoulder
Several things happen at once
Bloom hits the pavement shoulder-first, hard
The bent bike follows suit
Up on the hill, Stephen and the Chink raise score cards
8
9 and 5
6
The Lamborghini screeches to a stop
Everything is still
Then the car jolts forward
Then stops
Then again, jolts and stops
Rolls forward a few feet, lazily drifting, then jolts and stops
Bloom painfully stands, as confused by the car's behavior as us
33 59   :                                                  59 Stephen and the Chink lower their cards, equally confused
One last long beat of silence, then the car jolts forward, veers drunkenly to the left, tips into a ditch and chunks to a stop
The horn blares
Bloom looks up to the hilltop for guidance
Stephen stares blankly
The Chink raises a new score card - 7
8
60
-                                    60 Penelope sleeps, bruised and battered
Bloom sits bedside uncomfortably, arm in a wimpy sling
She stirs
Bloom leans forward
Slurred with sleep and drugs, she painfully barely breathes Are you alright
61
-                                 61 Bloom consults with Stephen and the Chink, both in scrubs
The Chink had it - 'm telling him, know, thank you - in her report, missed it
This is actually kind of great, 'll tell you why
The Chink lights a cigarette
You missed it
Dostoevsky was an epileptic
know
His seizures were preceded by an enlightened euphoria, a sort of opening of his spiritual eye
() 34 61   :                                                      61 (cont'd) think the fact that she saw your face the instant before a seizure is a pretty goddamn good foot to start things out on, right
Bloom stares blankly
The Chink burps into her stethoscope
62
-                                       62 Bloom slumps in a chair, watching Penelope sleep
(
) The next step is to figure out a way to insinuate yourself into their personal life
Bloom drifts off, then wakes with a start
It is
Penelope is shaking him
think they took my car
Could you drive me home
Uh
Yeah
She walks away, the back of her gown wide open, then turns
'm Penelope Stamp
Bloom
63
-                                          63 Bloom drives, Penelope gazes stiffly out the window
(
) Engagement
Find a connection with your mark through conversation
(cont'd) 'm sorry about your Lamborghini
' ok
Silence
He notices her playing with the side mirror knob, angling it to stare at him while looking out the window
35 63   :                                                        63 Nice area
(beat) Jersey
More silence
This car is like riding in a huge marshmallow
And still more silence
(
) Having now deftly set your hook in the mark's psyche, this would be the perfect time to tug the line, 64
-                                   64 They pull up in the car
tow truck is dropping off a new Lamborghini
(
) Get invited in for coffee, and tell them the full tale
Bloom looks about to launch into something, when Penelope drops a stack of cash bound in a green rubber band on his dashboard
For the bike, and the whole, thing
This was a big shit sandwich
Ok
Bye
The car door slams and she's gone
Bloom sits a moment
(
) However, there are advantages to playing it cool
Letting it lie for a day or two, then casually re- establish contact
Bloom starts driving off, and adjusts the passenger side mirror so it points back to the road
As he does he sees Penelope in it, sprinting after his car
He stops
moment later she appears at his window, heaving
36 64   :                                                 64 realized
should have
invited you in
for coffee
right
65
'  -                                 65 Bloom and Penelope sit in a luxurious stone-based kitchen, neither touching their coffee
Bloom talks
This is how Penelope listens: she starts with her eyes on Bloom, then very quickly drifts away into her own thoughts, then recognizes she's doing it and makes eye contact again and gives an overbaked "oh yes go on" smile/nod, then does it all again
Three or four times
didn't really have anyone except each other growing up, and our father was in the antique business, he had a shop in Charleston
So we stuck together, my brother Stephen and me, we and just took over the shop when dad died
Then we realized one day, we saw the dealers who were finding and selling us the antiques coming from exotic countries all over the world, and there was a, almost a scent they had, when they'd come in the dusty shop we worked nine to five in since we were nineteen, the air would, like before a rain, the ions would line up, and you could just smell midnight trains to Paris and steamer ships and Calcutta bazaars, and we made the decision, we just did it, that we want to have that sort of life
So we did, and we've been travelling and treasure hunting the world ever since, and could you, 'm sorry, stop doing - that, you're, 'm, ok
Alright, look
'm really bad at talking to people
37 65   :                                                     65 told you, that's alright
You want me to go
No
want to talk to you
Fuck
She storms out
66
66 Victorian, expensive
Penelope leans against the window, looking out
Sulking
Bloom enters
So what kind of stuff do you do
Nothing
Maybe you should go
Alright
'm just gonna finish my coffee first
Very slowly, he sips it
Each sip becomes a noisier and noisier slurp
collect hobbies
see someone doing something  like, and  get books and learn how to do it
Hm
Anything interesting
Not really
In which Penelope demonstrates the following with exacting seriousness and skill for Bloom: Playing the piano
The classical guitar
The fiddle
The banjo
Putting the finishing touches on a ship in a bottle
Executing a perfect ollie on a skateboard
38 66   :                                                      66 Juggling various items
Riding a unicycle
Juggling while riding a unicycle
Playing ping-pong against a wall with ungodly speed
Karate chopping through too much wood
Breakdancing
Playing the accordion
Rapping to a drum machine
Creating a perfect origami dragon
On Bloom's shell-shock face
Is that it
No
know a lot of stuff
You just learned this stuff, here by yourself
Kinda sad
No
So you just thought, `so want to learn this and this,' and you just did it
How do you plan to use all these skills
dunno
'm not a planner just do stuff
Here, look at this watermelon
It's a camera
You can make a pinhole camera out of anything hollowish and dark
It's gotta warp the image though, right
39 66   : (2)                                            66 No, yeah it does
That's what - the Taj Majal taken by a fat tourist with diarrhea and a point- and-shoot camera can be the flattest, dullest, "here's us at the Taj Majal," "Oh lovely lets go stick our thumbs up our asses" picture
But you can look at the most menial everyday thing, and depending on how your pinhole camera eats the light, it's warped and peculiar and imperfect
It's not reproduction, it's storytelling
It's a lie that tells the truth
dunno about truth
photograph is a secret about a secret
The more it tells you, the less you know
What's changed between now and twenty minutes ago
Cause this is kinda like a conversation
Huh
Well shit
67
-                                        67 Bloom and Penelope walk and talk, finally rounding the house and ending up at the driveway
Well,  should, uh, it's late
So
meet a lot of people in my job have to professionally act interested in
It's a good feeling to be genuinely interested in someone
Are you leaving
Yeah
40 67   :                                                  67 Are you coming back
Well next time 'm in town
We're taking a steamer at noon tomorrow off the docks, to the continent for a few months
During this, Bloom very naturally moves his hand to the small of Penelope's back
The edge of his thumb comes to rest on a small slit of exposed skin
Penelope's expression does not change, but a noticeable blush crosses her still face
When Bloom removes his hand, the blush falls
(cont'd) Paris and Greece,  think
've gotta get a hat
Thanks for the pinhole camera demonstration
And for the good conversation
Goodbye Penelope
Goodbye Bloom
He drives off
She stands in the doorway, watching him go
68
-                                         68 jaunty steamer ship docked and ready
Bloom watches the access road, Stephen makes notes, the Chink whittles
need another day with her
You'll have two weeks on the boat
need another day to get her on the boat, she isn't hooked
That bit  skipped where we were talking in the backyard, it was ten minutes on the optics of lensless photography, we didn't really talk
41 68   :                                                      68 It isn't the talking that hooked her
Bloom turns from the road
think you're wrong
screech of distant tires and a crash
Bloom doesn't look
(') (cont'd) Though every time  say that, you end up being comically right
That's her, isn't it
Yeah
Penelope pulls a clumsy steamer trunk that never could have fit in her Lamborghini, which is bent around a pylon
Bloom meets her
Hey
Hi
What are you doing here
She holds out the stack of bills in the green rubber band
You left this money in my kitchen
He doesn't take it
Yeah,  didn't want it, but thanks
Oh
(beat) Hey, where's this boat going
69
-                                    69 The good ship Fidele breaks the waves Greece-ward
70
-                                                  70 Bloom and Penelope stroll the deck
42 70   :                                                   70 Why did you decide to come
Well 'd never been to Greece
Or Europe
Or outside New Jersey
It just seems like a big leap
From where you were at yesterday to being a world traveler
It looked like fun
wanted to do it
new hobby
Up ahead, Bloom spots a large man in a fur collared cape gazing out to sea
He quickly turns Penelope away
(cont'd) Here, this way
71
-                                  71 The Chink and Stephen play shuffleboard
Bloom leads Penelope to them
Penelope, this is my brother Stephen
Pleased to make your acquaintance
Bloom's told me about you, you're the epileptic photographer
Sort of
This is my personal secretary and masseuse, Mrs
Yuengling
nearly imperceptible glare from the Chink
Yuengling like the beer
43 71   :                                                71 Heh
No
So what are your plans in Greece
don't plan
Good for you
The Chink hits a damn near impossible shuffleboard shot, then gives Stephen a pointed deferential giggle-bow
72
-                                     72 The brothers dress for dinner
You named the Chink `Yuengling
' was writing in a bar
And she doesn't drink, how does she know a Philly beer
She knows a lot of stuff
(beat) Was that who  thought it was on the East deck this morning
Yes it was
Did he spot you
An ominous glance
Not yet
73
-                                           73 Several small tables scattered about the moonlit deck, Bloom and Penelope sit with flutes of champagne
Penelope, in an elegant but understated dress, shuffles a pack of cards
You look very nice
She laughs as if at a joke she doesn't think is funny
44 73   :                                                   73 (cont'd) What was your childhood like
make cameras out of watermelons
Lonely
Lucky guess
Penelope's hands move faster
She knows how to shuffle cards
How was it lonely
Fishing for an entertaining childhood anecdote that encapsulates my adult issues
Well it's funny how everyone's usually got one
As Penelope tells her story she gets fancier with her shuffles
When  turned six  started getting allergies, hayfever, rashes, really bad
So my mom took me into the doctor, and he did that test where they use needles to prick a grid on your back with all the different toxins, to see which ones you're allergic to
The next day  came in, the doctor lifted up my shirt, and my back looked like a patch of oily, moldy, blackish green double- puff marshmallows
was allergic to everything
So they sealed the house with plastic and a special ventilation system, and  spent my entire childhood and adolescence indoors
Mostly alone
Lonely
She pulls the Queens out of the deck and lays them face up on the table
45 73   : (2)                                            73 Wow
It wasn't `til  was nineteen they discovered what  was actually allergic to was the aluminum alloy the hypodermic needle was made out of
Then  was going to leave, but my mom got sick
So  stayed
And she stayed sick, a long time
Do you feel cheated
Penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens
The trick to not feeling cheated is to learn how to cheat
So decided this wasn't a story about a miserable girl trapped in a house that smelled like medical supplies wasting her life on a dying person she sometimes hated
It was about a girl who could find infinite beauty in anything, any little thing
And do anything she decided to do
And love the person she was trapped with
So  told myself that story until it became true
Now did doing that let me escape a wasted life, or did it just blind me so  wouldn't want to escape it
don't know
But either way, was the one telling my own story
So  don't feel cheated
She finishes the trick
single pair of hands clapping turns their heads
At the far end of the deck, alone at a table, the large man in the fur collared cape, who for reasons unlikely to become clear at the moment will be called
And a magician is just an actor playing the part of a magician
My compliments
Bloom takes Penelope gently by the elbow and guides her up and away
46 74
-                                              74 They stroll out onto the moonlit bow of the ship
Who is that man
You avoided him earlier on the deck
don't know, but he's carrying a knife up his sleeve and wearing a cape
Do me a favor and steer clear of him
waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen
(') (cont'd) don't suppose in all your hobby acquiring you ever learned how to dance
went through a phase when  was mildly obsessed with the Bolero
Give me a minute
He leaves her alone
Clouds obscure the moon, shadows deepen
She shivers
match strikes
She jumps
The moon re-emerges, and she is no longer alone on the deck
The Curator lights a dapper briar pipe, shakes out the match
Mademoiselle
Monsieur
(in French, subtitled) didn't mean to startle you
(in French, subtitled) Yes you did
47 74   :                                                 74 (in French, subtitled) Apologies, but the deck was dark, and  had to approach
(English) It's been such a time since 've encountered the Brothers Bloom
You're in antiques
(Cheshire grin) Antiques
wonder, my dear, if you know the true nature of the men you travel with
The band strikes up a Bolero
The Curator flicks his wrist, and a long thin blade falls into his hand
(cont'd) little fear might suit you, think
He raises the blade
it is in fact a fine mustache brush, which he delicately employs
(cont'd) Bon soir, ma cherie
With that the Curator backs into the shadows, and is gone
Moments later Bloom trots up to her, oblivious
It isn't a Spanish band, but they'll do their best
He hands her a single blood red rose
She puts it in her teeth, and they dance
If there is a tinge of tension in the air, the Bolero suits it
The moon ducks behind a cloud once more, and they dance on in the dark
75
-                                     75 Bloom wakes with a start
Morning light pours in through his porthole
He opens it, looks out to sea
48 75   :                                                75 His dinner jacket draped over a chair
The rose in its lapel
He fishes it out
Runs his fingers over the teeth marks on the stem
Then raises an eyebrow at a lump in the breast pocket, and pulls out the stack of bills in the green rubber band
76
-                                           76 The Chink and Penelope lie on their stomachs on the deck, a beer can pinhole camera between them
Penelope gives a lesson on how it works
The Chink appreciates her
77
-                                   77 Bloom escorts Penelope to breakfast
How'd you find her
The Chi-nese, uh, Yeungling

-   ()                     78 Bloom cooks breakfast in his bathrobe
(
) few years back, when we hit the top of our art dealing game, she just appeared
door opens and slams
Bloom turns
The Chink sits at his place at the table, suitcase beside her, smoking a cigarette
(
) (cont'd) She's stuck with us
We figure when she gets bored she'll vanish with the same lack of noise
Like feeding a strange animal, Bloom pours her coffee
She drinks it without looking at him
49 79
79 like her
Good
They smile when they see Stephen and the Chink at a table
Their smiles drop when they see the Curator sitting with them
Bloom glares at the Curator, but speaks to Stephen
(cont'd) What's he doing here
invited him, sit down
This ship's too small to dance around each other for a week, we might as well have it out now
Bloom
Sit
Penelope, do you know our friend
Only as the creepy Frenchman
Book-learned
You know languages but not accents, my dear
am Belgian
Maxmillion Melville, at your service
Also known in certain professional circles as the Curator
Pleased to make your acquaintance
What do you do
'm a curator, presently for the National Museum in Prague
And yourself
'm an epileptic photographer
Good for you
Boys
What do you do
50 79   :                                                   79 We have a legitimate antique reselling business
Baissez le rideau, la farce est jouee
We've gone straight, Max
Pardon, but you do not ascend to the grand heights of the Brothers Bloom only to toss it all and sell terra cotta to blue haired weekend antiquers
We did
Eat your waffles
But Mademoiselle appears
confused
Perhaps she is unawares
Eat your waffles, fat man
Unaware that the Brothers Bloom are in fact the two most highly respected art smugglers in the western world
Were
We've been on the straight for three years
So that's that
Well, if that is that, then that is indeed that
As you say
Penelope snaps her fingers
Everyone looks up
Your name's Melville
Maxmillion Melville, Esquire
51 79   : (2)                                            79 Sorry, no, cause  noticed but couldn't place it, this ship is the Fidele, which was the ship in Melville's novel "The Confidence Man
" So that's weird
Everyone glances at Stephen, a little uncomfortable
Huh
80
-                                          80 Bloom paces, Stephen shuffles cards
know you like to throw those clever little details in, but you've gotta watch that shit with her Stephen
She had a lot of time alone in that house, and she used it
She did the best Double Dutch Queens 've ever seen up on the deck last night
Double Dutch Queens uses gaffed cards
She had them in her purse and cut them in while  was folding my napkin
Jesus
That's what 'm saying
She's different, she knows, sometimes it feels like she knows everything
Doesn't that worry you
No
But something about her is worrying you plenty
She feels like one of your characters
52 80   :                                                     80 The day  con you is the day  die, Bloom
know that
(beat) How did you get the Belgian, on our budget
He's beautiful, right
didn't expect him to actually be Belgian
'm not sure he is
'm to bed
Stephen stands to go, then pauses
(') (cont'd) 've always protected you, right
The only real danger in this whole play is that you'll actually fall in love with her
Look at me
Don't fall in love with her
81
-                                      81 The Chink sits smoking her whittled pipe, watching Bloom alone on the deck
Stephen passes her, and she stops him with a look
Shut up
know what 'm doing
She hands him a thin piece of paper
He looks it over
(cont'd) This came through just now
The paper is a telegram with the Fidele's imprint, received from St
Petersburg
Stephen reads it
53 81   :                                                     81 (cont'd) "My dear Stephen  Word on the wire is the Bros  are bound for Prague  Am heading there myself would love to see my boys Affectionately
" The Diamond Dog
He crumples the paper, looks down at Bloom
(cont'd) Wire him back for me
"Dear Dog Unless you've lately felt an excess of eyes left in your head kindly stay the fuck away from me and my brother  Regards," etcetera

-                                             83 Bloom and Penelope lie on the deck, watching dolphins
She says this word like she's eating chocolate: Smugglers
It's like an adventure story
Whose idea was it to go straight
Mine
Stephen always loved the life
Then he was almost killed on a run to Jakarta, two thugs with heads like canned hams worked him beyond all reason
84
-  ()                          84 Stephen is set upon by two thugs
He rushes them
Have at thee, you ham headed bastards
54 26/11/06
85
-                                       85 And  called it, that was it
Scary
For me
Stephen enjoyed it
He loved the idea that we were internationally infamous art smugglers, but  think deep down, same as me, he felt like we were putting on a persona, faking it
Telling a story
He'd love to die on a job
Cornered at midnight on a run to Jakarta
That's his dream, to tell his story so well it fulfills itself
It somehow would make it finally real for him
That's kinda the thing we all want, right
He looks at her in the sun
Trying to get something real by telling yourself stories is a trap
Trust me on that one

-                                   86 Kalamata, if it matters
The Fidele docked in bright blue water
Our intrepid heroes stand aside a dusty road, surrounded by their luggage
The Curator approaches, tips his hat to them
Best of luck with the antiquing, boys
Au revoir, Chinois

Mes restes d'offre
With a wink, he is gone

Penelope stands apart
My French is a little rusty, but believe he just told you `my offer stands

The Curator dissolves out of the darkness
(
) Whatever's in his pipe, it made me thick
He brings her face close to hers, smoke twisting, and speaks unheard words low and fast
88
-                                      88 Oh lord
What has he got
An 8th century prayer book

-                                        89 We fly through the city streets
(
) From his museum in Prague, stashed in the castle
Up to the base of the castle, through a grated hole in an ancient wall, into
90
90 stunning illuminated manuscript lies open on a stone table
The Curator's hands close it gently and take it away

) book of hours
(
) Yeah
Medieval art bores the crap out of me so  don't know it that well
So that's what he does, he makes pieces in his collections disappear, then sells them off via a trusted middleman
91
91 That's what he does
Wonder who's his fence
Probably his Spanish guy, right
(asks Penelope) Did he say who's buying
An Argentinian
Argentine
Argentinian
92
-  ()                             92 gentleman from Argentina
He's quite sick, cancer in his bones, and desperate for sentimental reasons to own this piece while he may
93
93 He'll sell it to a middleman for one million,
The Argentin
a guy will pay two point five
Not bad
Is he legit
57 93   :                                                  93 The Curator
That's a relative term
He's telling the truth
'm sorry you had to deal with that guy
Behind Penelope, two porters load her steamer trunk into the back of a taxi
(cont'd) Where's that cab going
The train station
Where's the train going
Prague
Bloom breathes
(cont'd) Let's do it
Let's, just,  want to try this
Let's be smugglers
think it'd be fun
We should do this
No
Why not
Well first off, we don't have a million dollars
do, 've got, that's whatever mean a real reason
This is real, it's dangerous, it could go very bad
think a little real danger might suit me
'm gonna do it

She walks off towards the taxi
This is not an adventure story
What are you talking about
It totally is

'   -                           95 Stephen reclines, hat on his face
Bloom paces
Take it easy
She's having fun, that's the point of this
She's making a flag for our "smugglers gang," man
She made me learn a secret smugglers handshake
Unhealthy
This afternoon, when she was writing, in the observation car
letter
journal
No
She is getting way too into this
Bloom fishes a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and thrusts it in front of Stephen's face
On it are written dozens of variations in stylized fonts of "Penelope the smuggler
" (cont'd) She's been singing the Smuggler Song since Athens
What Smugglers Song
59 95   :                                                  95 You know, the one from whatsit, the Disney thing, that Smuggler Song, the `We're a band of smugglers hey, la la la la la, we smuggle by night and drink by day, smugglers ho, ho ho, smugglers
' there, this isn't
there isn't a Smuggler Song, is there
Ok
She made up a Smuggler Song
With hand motions
The whole point of this was to sweep her off her feet
Let her enjoy it
While it lasts
Nothing lasts
Exit Bloom
Stephen sighs and drops his hat back on his face
96
'                                      96 Bloom reads
Footsteps pound by outside
Penelope and the Chink run past his door
moment later a uniformed runs past
beat, then the footsteps come back, and the girls duck into Bloom's cabin, slamming the door
Sacks in their teeth
Off Bloom's quizzical look: Smuggling
From the snack car
They pull bags of chips and tiny liquor bottles from their sacks
Bloom glares at the Chink, who tries to avoid his gaze
97
97 Bloom pays the    from a stack of Euros, while the Chink gives him counts on her fingers
60 97   :                                                   97 Fourteen gins
Are you kidding me
Jameson
'm not paying for that
She holds up two fingers, the Attendant pours two
Ice
She says no with a look, they drink
She made up the Smuggler Song
The Chink nods
Bloom pays for the Jameson

98
'   -                 98 The lights are off
Penelope reclines on the bed, surrounded by empty tiny gin bottles
Drunk
Bloom sits on the floor, both framed in a big window looking out on a breathtaking moonlit landscape rolling hypnotically by
Gin is fuckin fruity
Have you taken this train before
Yeah
So this is all like fuckin `whatever' to you
usually drink with the Chink in the snack car, play cards
With the who
61 98   :                                                 98 Oops
Mrs
Yeungling
That's her smuggler nickname
That's offensive
think if it were offensive to her, she'd let us know
Do  get a smuggler nickname
Bloom quietly slips the stack of cash in the green rubber band into Penelope's luggage
No
think you're constipated
In your fuckin soul
Bloom makes several attempts to form a response to this before giving up
What
You've got a big load of grumpy petrified poop up your ass, 'm just calling you out on it
Yeah 'm pretending 'm a smuggler, so you know what
'm a fuckin smuggler
If that's your thing, fuckin tell it like you own it
When you've got a spotlight in front of your feet, man, fuckin jump into it and dance the shit out of it
Stop fuckin thinking so much
Enjoy the fuckin ride
Fuck
roll of thunder and spectacular flash of lightning ignites the landscape, and rain starts to patter
Penelope stiffens

love thunderstorms
Another crash
Lying on her stomach, Penelope slowly starts feeling something which makes her undulate
Bloom stares, confused
(cont'd) Whoa ha
Oh ho ho
Ohhhhhh whoooo ha ha ha ha
Beneath her, the train wheels rhythmically clack and vibrate against the tracks
Another flash of lightening, the rain falls harder
Penelope writhes
Bloom silently shrinks back in terror

Good morning
Come in have been drinking

So how do you steal the book
The book is already stolen
The stealing is in the bureaucracy, in the filing, red tape
As far as the museum is concerned, the book does not exist
am the curator, walk in, pinch the copy girl's baboosh, put the book in a briefcase and walk out
Tomorrow, say, at two
Today
Today is not a good day
Tomorrow
Now what about this Argentinian

Senor Luise Belguta Rioso
get his file

Gin is slow death, man
Stephen and the Chink poke their heads in, leaving
The Curator strolls in
We'll see you back at the hotel
(glances at the Curator) Soon
They go, leaving Bloom and Penelope, who squints at an unframed oil on canvas, of a lonely stone well in a primeval forest clearing
It sits at the foot of an unmade bed
66 108   :                                                    108 From a private collection on the island of Ikaria
That one
Who painted it
don't know
Why is it the last thing you see every night, and the first thing you see every morning
That's a story
You have a minute
He closes the blinds and sits on a stool in front of the painting
Setting the stage
(cont'd) My daughter travelled with me when she was very young, and 'd show her the places and the art, all the most joyous and terrifying things in the world
Memories of his daughter's hand in his, flashing against the sun
(') (cont'd) wanted that the world was alive in the most fantastic way for her
To built her a pair of wings
Make these things real
But maybe more than any other objet d'art, she loved to hear she'd ask to hear the story of the stone golem
From a painting in a small private collection on the island of Ikaria
He motions to the painting, and we move into it
As he tells the story the scenes are shown in the painting, just as still images, which we move across like a picture book
(') (cont'd) Well Rachel, like most monsters the Golem was once a human
boy, about your age
() 67 108   : (2)                                             108 (') (cont'd) And one day the boy was walking home, and he quarrelled, he fought, with a good friend of his
They got very angry and his friend pushed him a certain way and the boy fell and struck his head and died
The boy's friend was very sad but also very frightened
So instead of telling the boy's parents, he did something awful
He pulled the body into a quarry, a pit of broken rocks, and hid the boy beneath a pile of large stones
Well
Years went by, and the boy's friend became a young man, and one day while drinking in town (which in his guilt he did quite a lot of) he heard that a well was being built near the forest
with the stones from the quarry
He ran to the quarry to find it nearly empty
no stones, no body
He ran to the well where the masons were finishing their work
`Did they find anything strange in the quarry
' he asked, expecting, maybe hoping they'd arrest him for the awful crime on the spot
But no, they said, motioning to the well
Nothing strange
Just stones
They left him alone there at the well, and he stood looking into it as the sun fell behind the mountains and twilight set the world in a deep, still silence
The last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing
Its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence that follows
Then, with a piercing , a living monster of stone lunges out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar pulls him back down into the depths of the well
Silence again
We pull out of the painting, back to the Curator, sitting very still
(cont'd) My daughter died nineteen years ago today
She was six
She went out to play one afternoon and vanished
() 68 108   : (3)                                             108 (cont'd) The next morning we found her, in a stone well on a neighboring property
climbed down to her, but slipped and broke my leg, and while we waited for the rescue team to pull us out she died in my arms
If you've had a child
my whole everything just focused down to one thing, to hold her and make her feel safe
But no matter what said to her,  couldn't stop her shaking, crying
Her last moments on this earth were filled with terror
Of a stone golem
He stands, opens the blinds, pours another drink
(cont'd) It was the first painting `acquired
'  keep it maybe hoping some night the golem will come for me
109
-                     109 Bloom trots out, ahead of Penelope
Mademoiselle
Bloom keeps going, anxious to leave, but Penelope lingers on the staircase
The Curator comes out
(cont'd) It is you  do business with, yes
Right
Oh, right
She gives him the envelope with the certified check
He shakes her hand, then deftly adjusts his grip so that just for a moment he holds her hand as you would hold a child's
He lets go, and smiles apologetically
Au revoir
69 110
-                                   110 Penelope and Bloom stroll home in silence through crowded, vibrant cobblestone streets
You aren't constipated
You're scared
What are you scared of
They walk on, suddenly somehow holding hands
As they approach the hotel, Bloom deftly breaks their hand holding off
Penelope notices why
111
-                         111 Stephen, up in the window watching them approach
He recedes into the room
112
-                                 112 The sun sets against the castle, taking us into night
113
-                               113 Bloom drinks alone, sketching Penelope's face with a pencil
smell breaks his concentration
Diamond Dog, carrying a cup and a cane
Standing behind him, a soft old man in an ashy suit and eyepatch
The
Bloom
How long has it been
(sits, orders) Tea
(to Bloom) Can you believe that
Tea
Been a long while
If  call Stephen down he'll kill you
70 113   :                                                  113 Well then please don't call Stephen down
Look at you, you're terrified
'mon now, look
Take a look
'm an old man with no depth perception
You don't have to be scared of me
The Dog plays with a heavy gold lighter, making sparks
(cont'd) It's been a funny thing, watching you boys take what  taught you and eclipse me
'm so proud to be a footnote in the lives of the Brothers Bloom
And you hate me
The curse of all bad fathers - that my presence on this earth after die will not live on the lips of admiring men, but will sink into the murky backwaters of my children's psyches
Is this profundity
Cause you can skip it
Ha
Ha ha
Piss and vinegar
The Dog scoots next to Bloom
(cont'd) When  first took you boys in, showed you the ropes, haunting St
Pete's, piss and vinegar
still crave that youthful joy
Even today
The Dog's hand touches Bloom's leg
There is something horrible about this
Beneath the bar, Bloom grips the sharp pencil like a knife
Don't touch me
You probably won't believe  loved you boys very much
71 113   : (2)                                           113 You're going to take your hand away or 'm going to break your arm, there's nothing between
He does, but Bloom's fingers don't loosen on the pencil
But love, you know
We know, folks like us, you can always blink and realize that it's a fiction, and like Peter walking on water or Wiley Coyote running off a cliff, if you look down in doubt you'll fall
That's the price of our lives, the wax in our wings
One day Stephen's going to fall
It may be glorious, but he's going to fall hard and he won't be there to tell you what to do and protect you
When he's gone, remember me
The Dog has moved in very close to Bloom, his breath hot on his face, and his hand comes to rest fully on Bloom's leg
Bloom's hand with the pencil quivers, about to strike- When Bloom is pulled from the bar stool by a heavy hand
Stephen, his eyes burning through the Dog
(cont'd) Hello Stephen
Stephen smashes a bottle from the bar and slashes it across the Dog's hand
Waiters and porters tackle him, the Dog howls, holding his bleeding hand
Bloom stands numb, and puts the pencil in his pocket
114
-                                   114 Bloom watches the Dog get into a waiting black Mercedes
For an instant the car's interior light shows an 11 year old boy behind the tinted glass, as the Dog slides in and puts his arm around him
The Mercedes drives off
72 115
-                                115 Right in front of the hotel, on the water
Bloom sips coffee from a china cup, spinning a paper in his hands
Stephen joins him, with a matching cup
'm sorry  wasn't there
You can't always be there
No,  guess can't
beat
That was a real tonal shift
The Curator's tale
On one side of the paper is the sketch of Penelope, on the other is the con flowchart
"#12 - The Curator's Tale
" "#14 - Castle Break-In
" 'm a big fan of tonal shifts didn't write it for him, though
He made it up on the spot
don't know
116
'   -                            116 Bloom flops into bed
He turns and looks at the wall
Right on the other side of it
117
'   -                    117 Penelope lies in bed, looking at the wall also
She closes her eyes
73 118
'   -                              118 Bloom's breathing slows
He closes his eyes
beat
Then light snoring breaks the silence, coming through the wall
Penelope snoring
Bloom smiles slightly
What a cute snore
The snoring deepens slightly
The clock on the wall advances from 1:30am to 5:50am, and through the window the horizon glows with the approach of dawn
Bloom lies wide awake on his back, red rimmed eyes wide open, the guttural snoring ringing in his ears
119
-                           119 Our four at the Curator's door
Bloom knocks, and they all step judiciously back
No response
Max
We're a little early
120
'  -                        120 Still and silent in the breaking light of morning
And totally empty
Picked clean down to the bare walls
The only thing left in the apartment is the painting of the well
broken on the floor
Our intrepid four stand in various states of thoughtfulness
Penelope stares at the painting, Bloom at the window
The Golem came for him
In my dream
Crawled out of the painting and killed him in a horrible way
74 120   :                                                120 Well at least he had the decency to just skip out on us, not do something tacky like fake his own death
Poking around the room, Bloom opens a closet
The Curator stands pressed against the back wall in his pajamas
(sotto) You're a little early
Bloom quickly closes it
don't get it
If he was hightailing it he could have waited eight hours till we traded the million for the book, and had some traveling money
Well
Back to antiquing
Nothing gained, nothing lost
(to Penelope) And you got to see Prague, which is nice
Penelope's eyes widen with realization
Oh
You should stay in the city for awhile, they have these amazing puppet show opera things- But Stephen raises a hand to shut him up
Oh
121
-                                      121 Several empty glasses of wine, one full one in Penelope's hand
All heads are slumped
Oh
75 121   :                                                    121 It's my fault
can't believe left you alone with him
The Chink hands Stephen a piece of paper
He glances at it
The check was cashed yesterday afternoon, he'd have deposited it in a Swiss account
'm sorry Pen
What a waste
Bloom puts his hand on her arm, sympathetic
(cont'd) That poor man
What a waste
Bloom's expression turns quizzical
(cont'd) That poor Argentina man
He'll never see the book now, it'll just rot in the catacombs
What a waste
When Penelope lifts her suddenly brightened eyes in a moment of divine inspiration, Bloom meets her gaze with fear
122
,  -                              122 Bloom paces, Penelope looks up at the castle with binoculars
The Chink and Stephen stand by
No
No no
Can't you see what happened here, there is no book, we've been swindled - But maybe there is, maybe it's real, we don't know
It's not real, it's a con
It's my money, 'm going to find out for sure
He gave us every piece of information we need
76 122   :                                                  122 She spreads the castle floor plan out on a bench
Bloom turns to Stephen and the Chink with a "this is crazy right
" expression and gesture
They give him nothing back
We'd need to clear the administrative offices
Some sort of disruption
The Chink strokes her chin in mock-thoughtfulness
(to Bloom) 'mon
Help me break into this castle
It'll be fun
123
-                                             123 Barbie Doll set up in the middle of the field explodes in a theatrical plume of fire
Several others follow suit
The Chink pops up from behind a mound of dirt in her aviator goggles, cigarette dangling from her lip
She leans on a detonator plunger
Bloom, Stephen and Penelope crouch nearby, watching her work
She's an artist with nitroglycerin
It's kind of her thing
feel like  want to know more about her
Yeah
Yeah
Check the tat
On the back of the Chink's neck, a few finely scripted lines of Chinese
77 123   :                                                123 (cont'd) An inky wisp of personal information
We transcribed it, brought it into a Chinese restaurant
What's it say
The literal translation is something about water cranes, but essentially it means "When you're done with something, blow it up
" 124
'    -                124 The Chink lies on the floor with Penelope, showing her how to build a tiny remotely detonated bomb
She slices a tiny bit off a brick of dynamite, sets it in a petri dish with a detonator, and puts the whole thing in a handbag
Penelope appreciates her
Bloom and Stephen hunker over the castle floorplan
There's a smoke detector in these empty rooms in the east tower
So we plant and set off a tiny - (to the Chink) tiny, tiny charge
The Chink clicks a seemingly innocent ballpoint pen
With a , a tiny poof of fire plumes from the handbag setting it on fire, and the smoke rises to the ceiling
(cont'd) Fire drill ensues, offices empty, and you'll have exactly four and a half minutes to get through the access hatch, into the catacombs, get the book and get out before the fire department arrives
Penelope and the Chink do their elaborate handshake, and she gives Stephen and Bloom a finger snap thumbs up
78 125
'   -                              125 Bloom and Penelope, up late at the table
Going over the floorplan one more time
So straight down the corridor, again, tell me where
Second left, third right, access hatch behind the copier,  need to sleeeeeeep
The abort code if we need to abort is "corned beef
" For some reason
Bloom,  need to sleep
He folds up the plans, she wraps up the brick of dynamite and bomb components and spots a black leather backpack beside an open handbag on the table
(cont'd) Is this Yeungling's backpack
Yeah
She gently puts the brick of stabilized nitroglycerin inside the front zipper compartment, and sets the tiny petri-dish bomb beside the handbag
You know what  feel
Horny
Scared
All my big talk
But this isn't a story, it's real
Fuckin scary
She kisses him
He kisses her back
79 125   :                                                 125 The pure whole hearted sensuality with which they attack each other and the deluge of almost child-like need let loose in this one simple act quickly reaches a point where as a viewer we no longer feel comfortable intruding with our gaze
Fifteen seconds after this point, we
126
-                                          126 The sun arcs into the sky above the castle
127
'    -                    127 Bloom half wakes
Across the landscape of the bed, Penelope sleeps
Sunlight on her body and her sleeping face
Distant
From the next room over
Bloom's eyes snap open
He scampers
128
-             128 In his boxers, holding trousers and shirt in his teeth, Bloom swings over the ledge from Penelope's window into his
129
'    -             129 He opens the door for Stephen, who regards him narrowly
Ready
130
'    -                 130 The Chink picks up the backpack, handbag and petri dish bomb
131
'    -                 131 Penelope folds a plastic bag and puts it under her jacket
132
-                          132 little alcove with a good view of the castle
80 132   :                                               132 Stephen trains his gaze on one set of windows high in the Eastern tower
Bloom paces
133
-                         133 An empty storage room, half under construction
The Chink walks in, wearing the backpack and carrying the handbag
She goes straight for a spot just under a smoke detector
134
-                    134 Stephen, Bloom and Penelope are joined by the Chink
Ok
He looks through his binoculars again
Alright
Ok
They share a brief moment with their eyes, and Penelope trots off
The Chink caught it
She looks at Bloom slyly
For the record, 'm still against this
Why send her in alone
The Chink finds a way to casually smell Bloom's fingers
Because going in alone is a very important thing to do
She's walking into a zero security tourism office during a fire drill and taking a five hundred dollar manuscript replica from a utility crawlspace
Worst case scenario, a file clerk asks if she's lost
Which isn't even going to happen
(to the Chink) She's in position
He spots Penelope casually waiting beside an unmarked door
Bloom notices the Chink looking at him with a knowing grin
She mimes sealing her lips and tossing the key
81 134   :                                                       134 She then takes the ballpoint pen detonator
out of the handbag dangling at her hip
(cont'd) Cause nobody's going to know we were ever here
Bloom spots the handbag
Something's not right
Uh- The Chink clicks the pen
135
-                              135 The black backpack, sitting under the smoke alarm, beeps
136
-                         136 blows a massive ten foot wide chunk out of the side of the Eastern tower, spewing a painfully dramatic ball of fire and debris
Screams
Shouts
Panic
Our three look up at the tower, agape
Fuck me
Bloom grabs the binoculars from Stephen, looks for Penelope
137
-                                       137 Panicked tourists stumble away from the descending dust
Penelope sees what's happened, but holds her ground
The unmarked door opens, and a dozen business people pour out
138
-                                138 Don't do it don't do it Penelope don't- 82 138   :                                                  138 They're locking down the castle, she won't get in
139
-                                  139 She takes a step towards the door
140
-                           140 Bloom drops the binoculars and sprints
141
-                                  141 burly   trots across the courtyard, herding tourists and smoking a cigar
To ze back, no panic, to ze back
He blocks the office door, and sets his cigar down for a moment
Penelope spots it
142
-                           142 Bloom nears the courtyard, sees Penelope up ahead
Pen
Don't - abort
Corned beef
Corned beef
143
-                                  143 Penelope deftly spins the cigar 180 degrees
The Guard absently picks it up and puts it back in his mouth, fire-side first
He howls, doubles over
She dashes into the door
Bloom bursts out of the crowd and lunges for the door, but a stops him
Dozens more security guards swarm in
Overhead, an army helicopter buzzes by
Bloom stares into the doorway, helpless and scared
83 144
-                          144 Water rains down from the ceiling sprinklers
Penelope weaves through the halls
145
-                                        145 Cramped, ill lit, and with its own sprinkler
Penelope dashes in, shoulders the massive cold war era copy machine and with a Herculean effort pulls it away from the wall
'm in Prague
burned a man's lips off to break into a castle in Prague
Revealing an access hatch
146
146 Tiny, earthy
Penelope shuts the hatch behind her
Light from a barred window illuminates a rectangular shape lying on a stone slab
Penelope approaches the small reverently
147
-                                   147 full view of the castle reveals just about the worst case scenario
The entire area swarms with army helicopters and tanks, soldiers with rifles, yellow tape, news crews
Stephen, Bloom and the Chink sit behind the police line on the bridge with the rest of the crowds
Heads in their hands
148
148 Penelope is broken out of her stupor by heavy footsteps all around her, soldiers searching the castle
Voices right outside the hatch
She slides the wimpy little bolt shut
It rattles
She looks up - a moldy vent in the muddy ceiling
84 149
-                                 149 Bloom suddenly stands
Wait
Wait, we're fine
She's fine
If the soldiers find her wandering the halls they'll assume she's a clerk, they'll just shoo her out
So as long as she doesn't do anything suspicious, she's fine
150
150 Penelope wriggles on her belly through a tin ventilation duct barely big enough for her
The book, encased in the plastic bag, hangs from her teeth
Sounds of soldiers searching the offices come from below her
Up ahead she sees a point of light
With a gleeful grunt she shimmies faster - she's nearly made it
151
-                          151 dozen  and the    have their eyes (and guns) trained on the tin ventilation duct above their heads
It is very very obvious not only that a person is crawling through it, but exactly where that person is
The Chief of Police pointedly coughs to get her attention
152
152 Penelope freezes
beat of silence
The tin gives way, and she plummets
153
-                                 153 hitting the ground hard, then springing to her feet and through some knee-jerk primal instinct kicking a nearby soldier in the head
Eleven rifles cock and aim at her
85 153   :                                                    153 And that's how she's caught, frozen in a kung fu stance, plastic bag in her teeth
She locks eyes with the Chief of Police
Lets the bag drop from her teeth
And opens her mouth to speak
154
-                                154 The hubbub has died down considerably, soldiers march away from the castle in formation
Bloom Stephen and the Chink sit watching for some sign
Three police cars, sirens blazing, drive down the length of the bridge
The Chief of Police
As the last one passes, Bloom sees the Chief of Police riding shotgun, and Penelope sitting with a soldier behind caged mesh in the back seat
His face falls
Then Penelope spots him, points and says something
Very suddenly, the police car stops
The Chief of Police gets out
Nods at our intrepid three
And opens the door for Penelope
As she climbs out he motions for the passing soldiers to stand at attention and salute her
He kisses her hand
(in Czech) It has been a privilege, madame, to behold even briefly such a strong, beautiful flower
(in Czech) Thank you sir,  will not soon forget your kindness
She blushes and smiles, then does an unhurried victory strut back to Bloom, Stephen and the Chink
86 154   :                                                    154 The police cars drive off
Penelope pulls the book out from under her jacket and sets it on a bench
moment of victorious silence
Clapping her hands, she does a little shuffle dance of joy
(cont'd) (sings) We're a band of smugglers hey, la la la la la, we smuggle by night, drink by day, smugglers ho, ho ho
Everybody
155
-                                155 Bloom and Stephen sit among empty wine glasses
The Chink approaches, gives Stephen a hand gesture
Let her sleep
Train doesn't leave till eight
That was real
Yeah,  know
Fuckin scary
156
-                                        156 Bloom walks pensively through a green park
Cat Stevens' "Miles from Nowhere" plays from a nearby radio
His eye catches something
shiny red apple on a fruit seller's cart
He approaches it slowly, face flushed, breath shallow, eyeing the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance
Holy shit
He is going to steal that apple
Deftly he passes, lifting and pocketing it just as the Vendor turns away
Bloom has done it
His pale face tightens
87 156   :                                                   156 And turns
And sees a five year old boy
Giving him a stare of infinite judgement
Bloom turns on his heel and
The vendor shouts
The little boy chases him, pointing and screaming
Dogs bark
People stare
And Bloom sprints, apple in hand, a joyful smile forming on his lips
157
-                          157 Stephen bails Bloom out
An apple
Yeah, but it was part of an epiphany
158
-                            158 The train thunders South, towards Greece
159
-                                159 Stephen pokes his head into Penelope's car, says goodnight
As soon as he's gone, a foot dangles down outside the window and taps it
Penelope pulls it open, Bloom shimmies in with two mini bottles of gin
He kisses her
160
-                                160 Bloom holds a sleeping Penelope, watching the sun stream through the window and slipping the green rubber band cash into her suitcase
low horn blows, and Bloom's face darkens
161
-                                 161 The good ship Fidele breaks the waves, blowing its horn
88 161   :                                                 161 Stephen stands on the deck
Bloom joins him
Mexico
He strolls off, leaving Bloom watching the horizon gloomily
162
-                                             162 Our intrepid four sit around a small table (except for the Chink, who lies on a deck chair in a bikini and Chuck Taylors, sunning herself
) Oh-kay
We're rendezvousing with Senor Rioso's guys here, on an isolated beach just south of the Mexican port town Tampico simple handoff
Penelope and Yeungling will stay with the car, Bloom and  will do the handing
You guys seem a little tense
Well 'm not thrilled they set this in Mexico
There could be legitimate reasons, but Mexico's - and  don't want to simplistically vilify an entire country, but Mexico's a horrible place
So we'll be careful
163
-                           163 The Chink fires an automatic pistol eight times into the dead center of a target pinned to a palm tree
She re-loads
164
-                     164 The beach sprawling below them, Penelope and Bloom meander
The hotel itself feels very old, red ruinous stone
Is this going to be more dangerous than  think, tomorrow
89 164   :                                               164 Yeah
You should sleep at the hotel tonight, 'll stay with Stephen at the beach house
You'll need sleep
On the distant beach, following the faint rapport of gunfire, a palm tree falls over
'm really happy right now
Are you
Right now  am
She kisses him and runs off along the cliff side, singing the smuggler song
(cont'd) Penelope
But she's too far away now, and the ocean is too loud
She can't hear him, and he can't hear her, and in another moment she has vanishes into the green brush and white flowers
Behind Bloom's pained face, the sun dips towards the beach
165
-                                   165 Stephen packs for tomorrow, Bloom stares out the black window, drinking
Flower in his lapel
Stephen picks up the con flowchart
The last box in our last con
Let them begin the beguine
How's it feel
She's something special, Stephen
Uh huh
Can
He stares at his drink
90 165   :                                                    165 (cont'd) Can  just have a little more time
Just a few days
want to keep her, like this,  don't want this to just end
Don't make me do this
Be angry at me, you son of a bitch
Don't be pathetic
Make you
Jesus
told you not to fall for her- 'm not gonna do this
Stephen comes very close to Bloom's face, looks him straight in the eye
Finds his answer
don't believe you
He goes back to packing
166
-                             166 Bloom stands, the beach behind him, the glowing lights of the hotel before him
Growing determination
167
-                                     167 Bloom knocks on a door
Penelope answers, in her bathrobe
Hey
know what 've gotta do
've gotta talk to you
Are you wearing shoes
What's up
He pulls her out of the room
168
-                             168 Bloom pulls Penelope by the hand, but she stops
91 168   :                                                168 Bloom
What
Deep breath
My brother and  are con men
All things considered, we might be the most respected con man team working today
And everything since you hit me with your Lamborghini, all of this, it's all fake
It's all a con
169
-                                           169 The waves break angrily on the beach
In the distance, Stephen finishes his drink on the beach house porch, goes inside and turns out the light
170
-                           170 No, we were going to blow you off tomorrow using the cackle bladder, it's a, term, we have actors playing the Argentina guy's men, when we showed up the deal would go bad, they would open fire on us, Stephen and  would pretend to be shot using blood packets, squibs
That's - cackle bladder, in the old days they put fake blood in chicken bladders, so
So you'd escape with the Chink, she'd send you off with a little travelling money and that would be that
Wow
But that's not how this one's going to end
love you now, and  want to get you out of this
'm going to do what  have to do to get you out of this, away from all this for good
Are you ready
92 171
-                                            171 Bloom leads Penelope down the beach by the hand
Stephen's gone into town to prep the Argentina actors
Your money's at his place
Money
don't want the money, let's just leave
For a moment he's tempted
The dark beach house looms ahead
'mon

-                                      172 Dark
Bloom leads Penelope in, stumbles in the dark, switches on a lamp
Click, click - it doesn't come on
(
) You have to switch it on at the base
beat
Bloom does
Stephen sits in an easy chair, not looking happy
But not angry
Much more sad than angry
So 've told her our whole play
And 'm here
To take her money back
How's that make you feel
Disappointed
This isn't the ending you wanted
It doesn't matter now
This is the way it ends
So let's get it over with
Where's the money
93 172   :                                                    172 ate it
Give me the money, Stephen
No
don't want the money
He's not going to keep a single piece of you
Stephen stands
'm sorry you fell in love with her
But she's a mark
And all of this, all of it is a con
Every moment you shared with her, you were just playing the part of a man falling in love
That's what you're afraid of, right
That you don't know the difference
Or maybe that there is no difference
That that's what love is
We're leaving
(to Bloom) No
You're too scared to leave
You're scared to ride off into a sunset that isn't painted tarpaulin, cause real sunsets are beautiful but they turn into dark uncertain nights
If you were ready for that, you wouldn't be here
The money is in my bedroom
Right behind me
But in my story you don't get the money or the sunset or the girl
long beat
The dark bedroom doorway looms behind Stephen
Bloom
Let's just go
Please
94 172   : (2)                                              172 Bloom , cracking Stephen in the jaw
Stephen goes down, Bloom leaps past him - but Stephen grabs Bloom's leg and brings him down
Then they are fighting
Penelope watches, horrified
frightening, brutal brawl that tears the small beach house apart, thirty years worth of a fight
Until Stephen throws Bloom to the ground at Penelope's feet
Upsetting a small table
The Chink's pistol, lying on the holey paper target, falls and strikes the ground
And goes off with a deafening rapport
Blood spreads just beneath Stephen's collarbone
Penelope screams
Stephen stays standing for a moment, shocked
dribble of blood out of the corner of his mouth
He half grins
Tastes like tin foil
And sinks to the ground
Bloom's eyes glaze
He crawls to his brother
Takes him in his arms
'm sorry
Penelope watches the brothers holding each other
Tears in her eyes, but she backs away a step, very conscious of not being a part of this moment
Bloom looks up at her, almost taking a moment to recognize her
Bloom
He doesn't move from his brother
(cont'd) 'm sorry
She leaves
95 172   : (3)                                             172 For a long moment the Brothers Bloom lie in each other's arms in the middle of the broken room
Then Bloom stands, goes to the window and watches Penelope walking off into the distance down the beach
From the darkened bedroom doorway steps the Chink, her face a mask
Stephen stands
Lifts his shirt and removes the squib and blood packets
Bloom steps outside
173
-                                     173 wood patio with steps leading down to the sand
Bloom watches Penelope, now very distant, almost gone
Stephen comes out, pulls out a flask
Hey
(nothing) think that was the most honest conversation we've ever had
(more nothing) You actually connected on a few of those punches
Did you expect me to do it
To come here tonight, end it the way you wrote it
Or were you really disappointed  didn't run off with her
was disappointed
But  wasn't surprised
Bloom turns and  him in the jaw
Stephen falls to the sand
let you do your monologue, but you wanna know why  did it
did it so she'd never want to see me again
To get her away from all this for good
96 173   :                                               173 Without looking back Bloom walks off down the beach, in the opposite direction of Penelope, leaving Stephen bleeding in the sand, alone in the dark uncertain night
- 3 months later
174
-                                174 Penelope's home, bucolic on a lazy Spring day
At a picnic table at the far edge of the front lawn, Penelope sits writing with intense concentration on a piece of paper
After awhile she raises her head, regarding what she's written thoughtfully
Folds it up, puts it in her pocket
Clicks the seemingly innocent ballpoint pen
The mansion , completely
She walks away without looking back
After a beat, the plaster deer explodes in a ridiculous fireball
175
-                              175 Green hills surround the walled medieval city of Ferentino
tiny white car inches its way across the countryside, and up into the city
176
-                              176 Bloom walks up the stone alley to his apartment, a bag of groceries in hand
He spots the white car parked out front
Loud shouting in Italian grows louder, until Penelope and the Grandmother burst out the front door
Berating each other with Italian curses and hand gestures
Penelope sees Bloom, and freezes
Hello
97 176   :                                                176 Hey
The Grandmother keeps up her barrage as she takes the groceries from Bloom, but as soon as she's behind Penelope's back she gives Bloom a wink, points to her and gives a thumbs- up of approval
177
-                               177 Bloom and Penelope wander the twisty alleyways of the city
How did you find me
The Chink
How did you find the Chink
She gave me her cell when we got to Mexico
didn't even know she had one
think she's kind of selective in who she gives the number to
178
-                                178 They sit with wine and bread
Why are you here, Penelope
Why did you decide to stay with your brother instead of coming with me in Mexico
Everything Stephen said that night was true
98 178   :                                                   178 've been doing a lot of thinking the past three months
want you to consider something
She takes a piece of paper from her pocket, unfolds it and slides it across the table to him
On it, written over and over in a dozen different stylized fonts, is "
" Bloom sets the paper down with a snap
Go away
Everything Stephen said was true
was just playing you as a mark
Everything between us, none of it was real
She leans in close to him, her hand on his leg
don't believe you
It's obvious even before she kisses him that she's right
179
-                                   179 Bloom dials a pay phone
He's been crying
It rings
Pick up
c'mon
180
-                           180 Lush, Edwardian
In a private room, a card table is overturned
Stephen lies on the ground in a defensive posture, a   in red lunging at him with a curved dagger
with an eyepatch holds her back by the wrists, while a   in an antique wheelchair holds his tear stained face in his hands
This whole scene is frozen like a tableau, as Stephen's cell phone chirps away
Annoyed, the Bearded Man gives him a `go ahead' nod
Stephen hastily answers it
99 180   :                                                180 Hello
181
-                         181 How quickly can you get to Ferentino
( ) Uh
Nine-ish
Bloom fishes out his pocket watch
Alright
Click
As he's putting his pocket watch back, he finds the stack of green rubber band money in his breast pocket
182
-                            182 Penelope plays cards with the Grandmother
183
-                            183 Stephen and Bloom sit on the little landing outside the apartment
So she comes back wanting to work with us
Honestly
think we'd be lucky to have her
If you called me to hear my opinion on the matter
Which 'm getting the feeling you didn't
did what  did in Mexico to get her out of all this
would rather die than bring her into the con
So maybe you want to tell me what 'm doing in Ferentino
100 183   :                                                  183 You knew she'd come back
What did you figure she was good for, another million
One point seven five
We will play her again, one last con, but not for money
'm gonna tell you how this one's gonna end
You built us into this, you're gonna fly us out, end it so she's done with all of us
End it all so it can't start up again
You want me to plan a con whose sole purpose is to blow her off for good
love her
You owe me this don't want to turn her into me
184
-                             184 Penelope sleeps on a cot against the window
Bloom enters wearily
Sits in a chair
Watches her
In the next room over, Stephen sits in the dark
Shuffling cards
lovely tune sung in Mandarin Chinese plays over this, segueing us into
185
-                                     185 On a television screen, images of the Shanghai skyline
- Shanghai wall of monitors, which the Chink steps in front of, singing the climax of the song
Beautiful and sad
As the song ends, she sees through the spotlight Penelope, Bloom and Stephen at a table
Penelope waves
101 185   :                                                185 The Chink's face betrays just the slightest hint of disappointment
186
-                     186 The four sit with drinks
So what's the next job
Before we do the next job, we need to liquidate our assets from the last job
But you've got- Your money from the last job, well that's profit, not capital, the three of us have already split it up
So step one: sell the book of hours
thought it was fake
With all your random expertise we couldn't risk a flat out fake
It isn't worth two point five million, we could maybe catch four hundred grand for it, but it's real
Who'd we buy it from
Minskie
Perfect, we'll sell it right back to him
The Chink hands him a piece of paper
(cont'd) If he wasn't dead
Well there's Demarco or Boyer
Or Roche, if we want to go state-side
102 186   :                                                   186 All traceable
With Minskie out we'd have to go deep black market if we wanted to be a hundred percent clear
There's only one place that's deep enough for that
Bloom and the Chink know exactly what he's talking about, and they don't look happy
Where
187
-                            187 Russia
It's like `cancer', don't even like saying the word
Bloom, Stephen and the Chink drink in a cramped little concrete room adjacent to the bar's kitchen
We're obviously not going to deal with real Russians
They'll be our guys in a phony set up, they'll take our phony book and give her phony cash, a closed loop
Safe and simple
Bloom looks to the Chink for an opinion
Gets a blank face
(cont'd) So
We go to St
Petersburg
At the mention of St
Petersburg Bloom looks sharply at Stephen, but Stephen presses on
(cont'd) She does the hand-off with our fake "Russians
" But while we're driving out of town, everything goes bad
He lays a simple flowchart, drawn on a napkin - three boxes
He points to the first, "Penelope sells book to `Russians'" 103 187   :                                                 187 (cont'd) We discover we were sold a counterfeit book in the first place, which we've now sold to Russian smugglers
We discover this when the Russian mob starts taking us out one by one
Oh shit
He points to the second box, "Red Dawn
" (cont'd) First they ambush our car, destroying the money
Then they take me out, then the Chink, and finally you Bloom, in a heroic death that allows Penelope to barely escape with her life
Devastated but reborn with the knowledge that you loved her so much you died so she could live, she drives off into a romantic life of adventure and peril, on the run from imaginary Russians
He points to the third box, "The End
" (cont'd) What do you think
: 188
-                                  188 The blood red sun sets over the city
189
-                        189 Penelope snores on the bed, while our intrepid three unpack
The phone rings
Stephen answers it, listens, hangs up
Our "Russians" have arrived
190
-                                         190 Stephen, Bloom and the Chink ride down to the lobby with a red suitcase
104 190   :                                                 190 Who'd you get, anyway
Hm
To play the "Russians
" The elevator doors open, revealing the Diamond Dog
My boys
191
-                                      191 Empty
The Dog leans against the bar with several , waiting patiently, making sparks with his gold lighter
Sounds of shouting come from the adjoining dining area
192
192 don't understand
Tell me so understand
Three months ago you were ready to blind the old bastard- We need someone who can pass for the Russian mob to buy our fake book
The Dog's got his big store right here in St
Petersburg
Alright, fuckin stop
You want this to finish in St
Petersburg, you want this to end with the Dog for some what thematic something
Fine but don't tell it like a story, let's say it
Twenty three years ago and  can still smell, that blood red apartment of his, the smell of that place
hate him Stephen but this isn't that, this is  don't trust him
105 192   :                                                   192 What's he gonna do
Steal our fake money
(beat) 've thought this one out, believe me
And we can't end it without him
Trust me
It's gonna be ok
193
-                                        193 The red leather suitcase on the bar
Stephen, still the grand architect with your symbols
Red for temptation, white for salvation
The Dog opens it, revealing  hundreds
Examines it with a loupe
(cont'd) Impressive, boys
It's trash
There's visible cross hatching in Franklin's eye
Sure enough - obvious jagged misprints cut into Ben Franklin's eye on the bills
Hm
'll be damned
(closes case) Ruskies wouldn't be caught dead handing over a rag bag like this, it should be a steel attache
This'll   do
We'll do the drop off at your   store
Make it scary, think a   movie version of the Russian   mafia, but don't hassle her
Alright
The Dog closes the case, and for a moment Bloom's eyes rest on his bandaged hand
He then takes the case and quickly moves off with his crew
106 193   :                                                   193 (cont'd) look forward to meeting the lady
Take care, boys
Leaving his gold lighter on the bar
194
-                                   194 The Chink leads Stephen and Bloom around the brown Peugeot
So
Our fake Russian attack
One small charge will simulate a bullet hit, and blow out the back window
The Chink points with an extendable pointer to a small nub on the rear windshield
(cont'd) So that one bang, then we roll off the road
Once we get clear of the car the Chink sets off the final charge, incinerating the car and the money in the trunk
This'll all happen exactly twenty seconds after we cross the main bridge out of town
After the bridge
Stephen makes a note in a manila envelope, tucks it in his jacket
Ok
195
-                                    195 Bloom and the Chink walk back to their rooms
The Chink is expressionless
You've been awful quiet
She doesn't react
(cont'd) 'm doing this for her
But a door clicks shut, and Bloom is alone in the hall
107 196
'                                      196 Penelope in bed
Her door cracks open, and she sleepily looks up
Bloom stands silhouetted in the doorway
Tomorrow it all starts
She lifts the sheets
He gets into bed, and as she drifts into peaceful slumber Bloom is very conscious of holding her for the last time
When her snores begin, he has ear plugs ready
197
-                                  197 The Peugeot drives into the heart of the city
198
-                                198 Bloom, Stephen and the Chink parked in an alley, watching a doorway across the street with a pair of binoculars
Bloom breathes uneasily, checks his watch
She gives the Dog the book, he gives her the fake money
This is taking too long
Just then Penelope trots out
Metal attache case in hand
199
-                                  199 On the outskirts of town, parked beside a murky little lake
Our heroes gather around the metal attache case on the hood
He hassled me
Took forever looking the book over, haggled the price
Wanted to pay me in Rubles
Stephen smirks, then opens it
The money's there
Alright
Let's get the hell out of Russia
108 199   :                                                  199 Bloom pulls the Dog's gold lighter from his pocket, takes one last glance at St
Petersburg and tosses it down into the lake
200
-                        200 The brown Peugeot drives towards the climbing sun
201
201 The Chink drives, Stephen rides shotgun
Bloom and Penelope in the back seat
He looks weary
He sees the bridge approaching, maybe a half mile ahead
She pulls his head down into her lap, fingers in his hair
He breathes, closes his eyes
An explosion shatters the front passenger window
Bloom's eyes snap open, he bolts upright
The bridge is still a quarter mile away
In the next moment the car becomes a din of breaking glass, screams, tires screeching
202
202 roars out on to the road, machine gun fire blazing from its windows, literally shredding the Peugeot
The car spins, tires flapping, and hits a highway embankment full speed, launching into the air
203
203 moment of strange silence as the car flips mid-air
The brothers lock eyes for a split second
204
204 The car slams into the steep grassy embankment, manages to flip upright, and rolls into a thick forest, coming to an abrupt stop against a stout tree
109 204   :                                                    204 They all four dive out of the car, Bloom shoving Penelope, tumbling into the thick forest an instant before the car becomes a roiling ball of flame
Bloom lies shell-shocked, his vision blurry
He vaguely sees Penelope passed out beside him, Stephen on the other side of the car
comes trotting into the woods, shining a flashlight on the charred car
Goes to Stephen
Reaches down to him
Bloom's mind flutters away into darkness
205
-                                                 205 Bloom wakes
Rain splattering
Slumped against a tree
Penelope hunches over him
What happened
Are you alright
What happened
Yeungling went to get another car
Where's Stephen
We don't know
He was gone
Bloom stands shakily, goes to the charred car
Runs his fingers over the dozens of bullet holes
Goes to where Stephen fell
Lying in the grass, a manila envelope
(cont'd) We're going to find him
If he escaped, he'll contact us
If they've got him, it's for ransom
110 205   :                                                 205 Who's got him
The Russians
The Chink pulls up in the green bug, headlights catching Bloom's face against the dark forest depths
206
-                                      206 desolate gas station parking lot
Bloom sits in the Bug, loading his revolver with shaky fingers
Penelope stands outside
Stephen, god please what's happening
don't know what to do
don't know Stephen please
Please
What's happening
Please
long black sedan screeches to a halt in the parking lot outside the window, Bloom bolts out of the car, pistol ready
But the Chink climbs out of the black sedan
Where does she get all these cars
Bloom motions for Penelope to stay back, then goes to meet the Chink in the middle of the parking lot
If you know what's happening, now would be a really good time to speak up
She sets a suitcase down beside her
Bloom takes this in
(cont'd) No, please
Not now
need your help here now,  don't know what to do
The slightest smile communicates all the compassion in the world
But she's leaving
She hands him a small slip of paper, their fingers touching for an instant
111 206   :                                                     206 She gives Penelope a quick little "call me" gesture, picks up her case and walks off
truck blocking our view of her car pulls away, and she gets in
Bloom looks down at the slip of paper
short phrase, in Chinese
(cont'd) Thanks
The engine turns over, and the Chink's car  in a dramatic fireball
The paper flutters out of Blooms's fingers a moment before he and Penelope are thrown to the pavement by the shock wave
Bloom and Penelope lift their heads, absorbing what just happened
207
-                                              207 busy street, which a title card identifies as "Chicago, Illinois
" On the corner, an unassuming Chinese restaurant
208
-                                   208 dive
The chef on the phone
Ah, ah yes, Mr
Bloom
Yes, ok
Blooooom
He puts the phone down and goes to the fax machine, which is spitting out a facsimile of the Chink's slip of paper
209
-                    209 Bloom on a pay phone, scribbling on a piece of paper
112 209   :                                                209 Uh huh
Assholes
Ok
Um, ok
So 've got "We are all assholes in our own theatrical enterprises
" You sure
This phrase, written on Bloom's paper
And then it end with "Goodbye shit head
" Shit head
But it is different meaning in Mandarin, uh, endearing
"Shit head" if you have affection for shit
210
-                               210 The Bug parked nearby
Penelope sits on the curb, crying
Bloom sits next to her
What did it mean
don't know
What did it say
"We're all of us marks in our own cons
" And she said goodbye
still can't believe it
That the Chink fell for a car bomb
Neither can
(hopeful) What
Oh, oh god do you think she faked it
So the Russians would think she was dead
113 210   :                                                    210 Bloom stands, paces away
He leafs limply through the manila folder - addresses, pictures, information
paper with the Dog's photo clipped to it
An address in St
Petersburg
The napkin Stephen wrote the con flowchart on
The third box - "The End
" (cont'd) What do we do now
Scrawled on the inside of the manila envelope - "An unwritten life
" Bloom's face clears
He wipes his eyes
Ok
Bloom goes to the Bug
Where are you going
This wasn't Russians
This was done by an old mentor of ours who wants us off the map
He has an apartment in St
Petersburg
So this is, yeah
've gotta go back to that apartment to face the Dog and get my brother back
That's how 'm gonna end this
Penelope's eyes gleam
She jumps up to the passenger door, and Bloom stops her with a weary look
We can skip the whole you-sending- me-nobly-away-and-me-refusing-to- leave-your-side-thing
Thank Christ
211
-                       211 narrow alley between tall apartments
Bloom parks, pulls his gun and checks it
114 211   :                                                      211 If there are shots you run to the car and drive, with or without me
212
-                                    212 badly lit apartment hallway
Bloom approaches a door, Penelope behind him
His breathing becomes hard
His face contorts
He crumples next to the door
What's in there
Tell me who this guy is
Bloom's breathing steadies
He's just an old man
He tries the knob
It opens
213
'  -                                 213 Blood red walls
Dark, neglected and to all appearances empty
Bloom creeps down the darkened corridor, gun outstretched
Breathes through his nose, chokes
Dog
came back
He kicks open a door, revealing a large living space
Empty
He lowers his gun, switches on the light
Penelope enters
Sniffs the air
Moth balls
Bloom almost laughs
Is that what that smell is
closet door smacks open, revealing the business end of a double barrel shotgun
115 213   :                                                    213 Bloom spins, gun drawn
Penelope screams
Then a moment of stillness
The shotgun barrel quivers
It's held by the 11 year old boy Bloom saw in the Dog's Mercedes in Prague
Malnourished and scared
Penelope approaches him slowly
(in Russian) It's okay
Honey, it's alright
The shotgun sinks to the ground
Penelope strokes his hair back from his face
Bloom lowers the gun, trembling
Ask him if anyone else is here
She does
Nyet
Ask him where the Diamond Dog is
Diamond Dog
(in Russian) Where is the Diamond Dog
(in English) The Dog of Diamonds is gone
Bloom does a quick search of the rest of the room
As he does Penelope asks the boy one more question in Russian, and gets a quick answer
Get the car started
What about him
It's alright
116 213   : (2)                                            213 She believes him, and goes
Bloom kneels in front of the boy
(cont'd) You don't need to be afraid of him anymore
Or angry at him
Or ever come back here again
He doesn't concern you anymore
Understand
It's gonna be ok
The boy nods
Bloom hands him the stack of bills wrapped in the green rubber band
The boy snatches it and runs off
214
-                              214 Bloom trots out of the apartment building, and sees two things: Penelope working the 's starter, and a black Mercedes speeding down the narrow street towards her
He sprints towards her, screaming Get out
Get out of the car
She sees the approaching Merc, too late, and ducks down
hand hurls something from the darkened window
It smashes through the Bug's passenger side window, showering Penelope with glass
The Mercedes roars off down the street
Bloom reaches the Bug and throws the door open
Penelope lies covered in safety glass, holding a Russian nesting doll
215
-                                              215 The seven progressively smaller dolls lie open on the back seat, Bloom holds the two halves of the final tiny doll, and Penelope holds a note
It's a ransom note
It says they have Stephen, it says they want the money wired to a specific account, they give a bank to do it at and a manager to ask for
() 117 215   :                                               215 (cont'd) Then an address to come to, at two p
m
In two hours
'll wire the money from my account, and we'll go get Stephen
It's a lot
How much
'll do it,  want to, 've got plenty- How much are they asking for
One point seven five million
cold pit opens in Bloom's stomach
Oh
Oh oh
No no
He punches the dashboard
(cont'd) No 'll kill him
'll kill him if that's what this is, if that's all that this is, no
What are you talking about
There's another possibility that should of, 'm a fucking idiot
This might all be a con
By my brother
To get me - oh god - he wanted me to face the Dog, to end it, and he gets your money
Oh god
'm going to be sick
Would he do that
To you
don't know
Yes
Yes of course he would
() 118 215   : (2)                                              215 (cont'd) To tell a story so well it becomes real
The perfect con
That's his whole, goddammit, that's what
But you don't know
Let's transfer the money
You don't know
Son of a bitch
You don't know
This is your brother's life
'm gonna wire the money
216
-                               216 Bloom sits in the car, alone
He punches the dashboard again, helpless enraged and scared
Penelope gets in, looks at the address on the note
Ok
217
-                                217 Penelope and Bloom sit in the car, parked in front of the impressive facade of a closed, burned out old theater
The clock on the dashboard reads 1:50
'm so scared
Anything  can imagine finding in there, 'm scared of
'm going to be here when you come out
She kisses him
He puts his hand on the door
Hesitates
Then goes
Walks up the stairs to the inky maw of the theater door
Goes in alone
119 218
218 No lights
Moldy dust
genuinely creepy place
Bloom steps lightly, deeper into the theater
Stephen
219
219 few lights flicker on the walls, fitfully illuminating the broken dusty seats and bare ruined stage
Bloom walks down the aisle, trying to keep his voice steady
Stephen
spotlight snaps on from the mezzanine, right in Bloom's face
He spins, trapped in its glare
guttural command is shouted in what might be Russian
When Bloom doesn't respond, the spot silently advances a few feet ahead of him towards the stage
Bloom gingerly follows it, up onto the splintered stage and finally resting on a split in the tarpaulin backdrop
With a wary glance back, Bloom steps through it
220
220 Giant fossils of antique stage scenery
Utility lights high above, cut by scaffolding, patch everything in dim jagged forms of light and black
(unsteady) Stephen
Game's up
Come on out
Let's blow this one hat town
Silence
Then a harsh utility lamp snaps on, cruelly lighting Stephen's face
Shockingly bruised and battered, old and new blood
Bloom cries and rushes towards him
120 220   :                                                 220 No
No Bloom, freeze
He obeys
Stephen is tied to a chair
dark figure behind him holds the lamp with a black gloved hand
Stephen, who is it
Is it the Dog
Did Penelope wire the money
Yeah
They're calling to check right now
Don't move
'm alright
The dark figure's cell phone rings, he holds it to his ear for a moment then flips it closed
Something happens in the blackness, and Stephen shakily stands, cut loose
(cont'd) Stay where you are, Bloom
'm coming to you
He takes a couple wobbly steps
Behind him, Bloom sees the dark figure raising his gun towards Stephen's back, pulling the hammer
And the utility lamp switches off
No
Bloom's revolver pops out of his sleeve and he's firing into the blackness
Stephen drops flat to the ground
The fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness, strobing the scene like stage lightning
Bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat, but Stephen lies on his stomach out in the open
(cont'd) Stephen
121 220   : (2)                                              220 Stay back
But Bloom makes a dash for his brother, out into the open, unloading three more rounds into the dark
The dark figure returns fire on Bloom, who is sprinting full on his feet in a large pool of light
sitting duck
Stephen launches himself up, tackling Bloom backwards
Just before they fall behind the safety of the flat, a red burst of blood flowers from Stephen's left lower back
Bloom sets him down gently, and hears heavy footsteps behind him
He turns, firing, but only sees a blur of dark coat go by, through the torn backdrop
Bloom runs out on stage, tearing the tarpaulin, and fires after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the lobby
Silence
Bloom walks back to Stephen, who lies behind the flat, breathing heavy
Blood soaking through his shirt
Please tell me this is all gonna be ok
Tell me that's a squib, and that's makeup, and that you just gave me what  always wanted and pulled off the perfect con
long, long moment
Stephen coughs, spits
Then a wry grin spreads across his face
You said it, not me
He stands, the shakiness gone
(cont'd) Can  get a `wow' for this one
You son of a bitch
122 220   : (3)                                            220 Bloom looks like he might hit him, but his face breaks and he embraces him, crying
The Brothers Bloom stay like that for a long while, holding each other in the spotlight's glow
Finally Stephen pulls away, tears in his eyes
He wipes them, wipes blood from his lip
Tastes like tin foil
Alright here's what  want you to do
The Chink split
Yeah
Clean exit
How
Car bomb
hint of relief in Stephen's face
Good
Here's what
Take Penelope back to Helsinki, take that flight to Rio
Lay low like we said
Play out the on-the-run-from- vengeful-Russians thing, that'll be fun for her
Play it like 'm dead, actually - that'll add some gravity to everything, that'll be nice
And 'll see you when  see you
Soon
hope not
Last thing you need is me hanging around
Anyway, how could  top this
Bloom hugs him again
love you
Bye
He turns to go
Hey
Think of any card
123 220   : (4)                                            220 Stephen pulls out a pack of cards
Alright
Stephen cuts, to the Queen of hearts
(cont'd) Stephen
That's it
(grins) That's the best card trick 've ever seen
just wish you had a bigger audience
You're the only audience 've ever needed
Wink
Bloom leaves
Stephen watches him go
221
-                        221 Rumbling towards Finland
In the Bug, Bloom sleeps in Penelope's arm while she drives
She looks at his hand on hers, his shirt cuff bright red with Stephen's "blood
" She strokes his shoulder sadly
Off Bloom's sleeping face
222
222 Stephen pulls a chair out onto the stage, sets it right in the spotlight's glare
Trembling as if it takes all his last strength in the world
Sits
Looks at the Queen of Hearts, moves his fingers over it
Then slides is up his sleeve
Blood trickles down his hand
124 223
-                                             223 Bloom wakes with a start
Hey
Hey, it's ok
The bridge is coming up, we're almost at the border
Were you dreaming about Stephen
She strokes his hair back from his face
He nods, and looks down at his sleeve
Stephen's "blood" on his white cuff
Now a dark shade of brown
Bloom looks at this shirt
All the blood, it's all brown
He looks up at the road, nearly panicked
Maybe a quarter mile ahead is the bridge
Pull over
Pull over
224
-                                        224 She does
He bursts out of the car, and run/tumbles down the grassy hillside till he finds the car tracks
He follows them to the charred remains of the Peugeot
Penelope stumbles down after him
What is it
You're scaring me- What did you ask the Russian kid, in the Dog's apartment
He said the Dog isn't here, then what did you ask
Bloom kicks open the trunk
Pries open the blistered attache case
125 224   :                                                 224 Sifts through the charred pile of cinders that was the money from the "Russians" till he finds what he was looking for and brings it out into the dying light
How long had he been alone
And what did he say
scrap of unburned money
fragment of Ben Franklin's face
Since yesterday morning
single eye gazing up at him, the green grass behind it
The eye is perfect
No cross hatching
Bloom sinks to his knees
This is real
They hassled you
Bloom- The Dog was gone before we got there
They hadn't cleared out of their apartment, they had been cleared out
225
'  -                   225 in black overcoats burst in, shooting the Dog's men with silenced pistols
The  shuts himself in the closet, terrified
226
-                                        226 Real Russians
Took his store
They didn't know about his deal with us, but you haggled with them
You really sold the book to real Russians
The Diamond Dog was gone
126 227
-                              227 The scene beside the lake, our four heroes checking the money in the attache case
Let's get the hell out of Russia
Bloom tosses the gold lighter, it splashes into the lake
We follow it, plunging beneath the surface
Deep deep down, among weak tendrils of light, the Diamond Dog sinks into watery blackness, a long blade in his neck
228
-                                       228 And they came after us
And Stephen
Penelope holds him tight
know
Stephen saved my life
know
He's gone
Bloom folds into Penelope's arms, but she doesn't let him
She holds his crying face up
And he did it so you could live
Your brother loved you
He loved you so much
Look at me
Stephen said something once,  got the feeling he'd rather be telling it to you
He said there's no such thing as an unwritten life
Just badly written ones
love you
() 127 228   :                                                 228 (cont'd) We're gonna outrun these bastard Russian mafia, and we're gonna hide out in Rio, then we're gonna live like we're telling the best fucking story in the world
Are you ready
She holds his face close to hers for a long beat
Then smiles and pushes away, launching up the grassy hill
Bloom watches her
Time slows as she turns back towards him, still running, and holds out her hand for him to follow
(
) was thinking of something Stephen said too
"The perfect con is one where everyone involved gets just the thing they wanted
" Well
He takes the girl's hand, and runs with her towards the point of light breaking over the hill
229
-                                       229 Sunset with her wine-red fingers falls over the road ahead
The rumbly old  chugs away from us, towards the horizon
