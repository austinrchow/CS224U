The residence is on Main Street, four blocks from where the commercial district begins
The mature, over-arching trees makes this street of prosperous houses a grand promenade

Jacey is seventeen; he's as handsome and seemingly self-confident as his younger brother is rumpled and impulsive
Doug is fifteen, a popular culture chameleon who takes on the colors and affectations of whomever his "hero" is at the moment (which presently happens to be Elvis Presley)
Jacey stops and stares with open-faced misery at the tent on the Abbott's front yard (the installation of the tent indicates that the Abbott's are having yet another of the many parties they throw every year)
Didn't get invited, huh
Go to hell
Who cares
'm not going and got invited

(She teaches second grade at Haley Elementary School
) He has to wash it off, Mother
You cannot let him go to the party unless he washes it off
It'll look worse if  wash it
It's India ink, it'll turn gray, it'll look like dirt
He looks like such a clown and he doesn't even know it
He doesn't get how things work in this town
thought you weren't even going to the party
Changed my mind
Doug, you do understand that you may be the only person at this party with artificial sideburns
Yeah
You do understand that your sideburns don't look real
Doug was hoping they didn't look that phony, but he conceals his disappointment and nods: () - Rev

That they look, really, as though you'd drawn them on
(swallows, then shrugs) Yeah
She looks hard at Doug for a beat, then turns to Jacey
Well, darling, it seems he does understand
Why don't you just go on to the party and ignore Doug
Just have a good time and pretend you don't even
Jacey curses under his breath and storms out the front door before his mother can finish her sermon

We hear a dance band playing " " and the sounds of the party as Doug lopes up the sidewalk sporting his India ink sideburns and smoking a cigarette
He flicks the cigarette into the street with well-rehearsed ease as he turns and walks up the long driveway towards the glowing "big-top" tent
Doug trails his hand over Lloyd Abbott's Cadillac, caressing it from hood-to-trunk as he ambles by

He is dancing with Eleanor

Of course
He's one of the Atlas Steel Vanlaninghams

He's a bully
So how come Alice's marrying him
Because my parents want her to and Alice is afraid of my parents
It's practically an arranged marriage
They think Alice has peanut shells for brains or something, so they sort of suggested that maybe it was time to tie the old knot and they sort of suggested that Peter was the one to do it with

Joan has the practiced poise of a former beauty queen (as if her smile had been surgically sewn onto her face)
She has a tendency to smoke and drink a bit too much and eat and sleep a bit too little
Ladies and Gentlemen -- 'd like to propose a toast in honor of our cause for celebration tonight -- the engagement of our daughter, Alice, to Mister Peter Vanlaningham
He gestures to   and her fiance Alice is nineteen, the eldest and the prettiest and seemingly most conventional of the three sisters
Peter is the scion of a wealthy Pittsburgh family
He and his bride-to-be smile and acknowledge the applause and - toasts
The band strikes up " Got the World on a String" and Joan whispers something to Alice -- Alice goes over to Lloyd and (despite his mock-protest) pulls him out onto the dance floor

As he nonchalantly continues down the sidewalk we see several trash cans on fire in the near distance

That was a nice party last night
You were there
Yes, sir
Eleanor invited me
Did she
Didn't see you
(slight beat) You going to be an engineer like your dad was
want to be an architect
Hmmm
guess some people care more about having ideas that they do about making money

Lloyd idly examines the mechanism on the ashtray that enables it to slide in-and-out of the dash
That full suspension file drawer your dad invented is still in production, did you know that
We'll ship thirty-maybe-forty thousand of those file cabinets this year
Hell, that drawer put Midwest Steel Desk on the map

Lloyd pulls out his wallet
You want some free advice
Sure
Don't waste your life making other people rich
Keep the change
He hands Jacey a five-spot and gets into his car
Lloyd drives away in his Cadillac
Jacey crumbles the five dollar bill into a ball
As he returns to the office he catches his reflection in the mirror of the cigarette machine
He frowns and pulls off his cap and bow tie

Doug strikes a wooden match, shepherds the flame, leans over, holds the match to his ass and lights a fart
The amorphous blue flame flares and almost instantly disappears as the gas is consumed
, Doug's partner in crime and best friend, is impressed
(Victor is fifteen, too
) Jeez Louise
How'd you do that
Intestinal gas -- produced by bacterial metabolism of food residues in the colon
mixture of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane
That's the secret ingredient
What's so secret about it
Not everyone can produce methane
It's genetic, that means it's inherited
There's a lot of methane in my family

Jacey gives him a thumb's up gesture and Steve circles the boat around for the approach
No way
He's never done the ramp
He wants to do it
Steve lines up the approach and pushes the throttle open
Jacey swings out on the end of the tow-rope and pops over the wake
Eleanor leans over to Steve
You know you're going too fast
(grins) Yeah,  know
The boat zips by the ramp and Jacey's skis contact the slippery surface and his skis go out from under him
He takes a hard bounce, loses hold of the tow-rope, and goes tumbling over the apex of the ramp into the water

And Doug reacts to
Jesus Christ
Jacey's back and buttocks are severely bruised
Jacey wraps the towel around his waist and turns to his brother
Don't tell Mom

just thought you and Steve
Well, that's what you thought think Steve is
don't even know what  think about Steve, never think about him
just do things
And let other people figure them out
That's what parents are for
They're real good at doing all the thinking
Why should

She and Kilroy didn't waste any time
He's already talking about having another, and Alice is up- chucking every hour on the hour
She's got morning-noon-and-night sickness

Wallpaper patterns -- that's all she talks about
She and my mother spend hours looking at wallpaper pattern books
That's another thing never think about
wallpaper
(another beat) Well,  think this is called the silent treatment
get enough of that from my father,  don't need it from you
Good luck at Penn
She starts to walk away, but Jacey pulls her back and kisses her fiercely -- Eleanor responds with equal heat
They don't see Pamela enter the garage

She is seated across the table from him
The library is filled with students poring over their assignments
Eleanor is seemingly oblivious to Doug's probing eyes
Doug allows his pencil to roll off the edge of the table
He ducks under the table to retrieve his pencil and his ruse is revealed as he stares up Eleanor's skirt at the soft triangle that her white panties cover between her parted legs
Eleanor's hand lowers a piece of notebook paper beneath the table, on it she has written: "Hi Doug
" Doug starts with panic, rears back, cracks his head on the bottom of the table, and then, as his head rebounds from the blow, he accidentally impales himself in his chin with the sharp pencil
Doug scrambles up from under the table with the pencil dangling from his chin, knocking over his chair in the process
The tranquility of the library is destroyed by the flabbergasted reactions of the students
Eleanor is momentarily concerned about his welfare, but she cannot help but laugh, too

Doug exhales with bewilderment, stubs out his cigarette, then awkwardly slides down the sofa to Pamela
She holds perfectly still as Doug slowly moves his mouth to hers and kisses her
Then he concludes the kiss to check her reaction; she timidly smiles
He kisses her again with greater fervor
Doug creeps his hand up her blouse and massages her breast
Pamela struggles to suppress her surprise, which he mistakes as a sign of her approval
Emboldened by her lack of resistance, he slips his hand under her bra
Pam is shocked by the pleasure of the sensation, then alarmed by the pace of their passion

Doug kisses her again and as they kiss he stares at a framed photograph of Eleanor amongst an assortment of family photos on the long table behind the sofa

Pam lurches    back into the sofa: Jesus

Stop it

Helen notices a baseball lying in the gutter, she picks it up and cleans it off with her apron
As she turns to go back to the house, she finds Doug standing on the porch steps

Helen sits on the porch steps and now the true toll that Joan's visit has taken on Helen becomes apparent -- a bone-weary sadness falls over her

Doug allows Pam to pull him out onto the dance floor
He feels like a dolt, but she arranges his hands on her and they begin to dance

Doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for her
For a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble of true affinity
But their bubble begins to deflate as Doug sees Joan Abbott staring at them
Her disapproval is unmistakable
Doug steers Pam around the dance floor to avoid Joan's eyes, but then he sees Lloyd Abbott
Lloyd's stare is even more discomforting
Pamela senses the change in Doug's mood, but she is unaware of the cause

Jacey skillfully manipulates the volley and wins the game with a savage return that Doug is unable to counter

Two well-dressed townswomen ( and ) encounter Helen on their way into the apparel shop as she steps out onto the sidewalk
Hello, Muriel

As Helen slips through the crowd she is pleasantly ambushed by three (second grade) students of hers
She has a brief exchange with the children and then moves on
Helen finds herself face-to-face with Lloyd Abbott as they both attempt to pass through a narrow space between two parked vehicles

She's no more pleased to see Doug than he is to see her
Hi, Pam

Hi, Mrs

It's so darn hot the stupid jack just keeps sinking into the pavement
Well, maybe Doug can give you a hand
Doug frowns and slowly climbs out of the Plymouth
Where's the thing that goes on the bottom of the jack
What thing

'm not like you, Jacey --  don't want to be like you
You going to stay here
In Haley
No
was thinking New York
If 'm going to really learn how to design sets, that's the place to do it
(long beat) 'm sorry
know you are
(slight beat) Did you have to get stitches
Hmmm
Your eyebrow
My eyebrow -- yeah, ten stitches
Sorry
Doug takes an envelope out of his coat pocket and puts it on the table
Found this in one of the boxes in the basement
What is it
letter of agreement between Lloyd Abbott and Dad
Dad sold him the file drawer patent -- not Mom

(re:   document) car
Yup
Jesus Christ
he sold the patent for a used car
Used cars were the only kind of cars around
The war was on -- everything was mobilized
They stopped making new cars, they were making tanks and bombers in Detroit
And even Midwest Steel wasn't making desks, they were making ammo boxes and mortar shells
How did you get to be such an expert on World War Two
History -- high school should be an expert,  had to take the damn class twice
guess Dad needed a car and he figured who- the-hell needed a full-suspension file drawer
(reading aloud) '1937 Desoto coupe convertible as is
' Wonder whatever happened to it
He parked it at the bottom of the lake

Neither one of them knows how to say good-bye, after an awkward beat: () 112
169     :                                                      169 (fighting back tears) Do me a favor
Don't stand here and wave good-bye
it makes me think of Mom
Okay
See you
Doug turns and walks away
Jacey climbs onto the bus
170
-  -                                  170 Doug drives home from the bus depot in the old Plymouth
He slows as he sees
the party tent in the Abbotts' front yard (with its canvas sides rolled up)
Susan's third birthday party is underway, dozens of well- dressed children and their parents are in attendance
Alice (who is very pregnant) and Peter Vanlaningham and Lloyd and Joan Abbott watch Susan riding her new pony, a gift from her grandparents
new generation of Abbott parties has begun
171
-  -                                  171 "For Sale" sign has been placed on the front yard
Doug pulls up the driveway in the Plymouth
He turns the  but doesn't get out of the car
Then he the  again and backs out of the driveway
172
-  -  (  )                172 Despite it being a birthday party for a three-year-old, this is very much a grown-up affair
The band is playing, the adults are dancing, Joan Abbott is flitting from guest-to-guest, Alice is dutifully silent while Peter dominates the talk at their table, Lloyd is with his cronies
Doug enters the tent -- one-by-one the guests take notice of him as he works his way across the tent -- and all are very aware of his uninvited presence by the time he reaches Lloyd Abbott
Lloyd scrutinizes Doug, then: What do you want
want to talk to you

-  -                                    173 Doug follows Lloyd into the dark-paneled room
Shut the door
Doug closes the door
Lloyd lights a cigarette
Smoke
No thanks
Sit down
don't want to
Then don't
(slight beat) 'm sorry about your mother
Sorry about what
You didn't know your mother at all if you think someone like me would've ever stood a chance with someone like her
That just goes to show you how stupid this town is -- that they'd believe she slept with me
That'd make Charlie laugh
Your old man was my best friend
He used to call me 'Egg-head' -- hell, everybody did
And back then everybody knew that Egg-head Abbott didn't stand a snowball's chance in hell with Helen Riley
Of course, that was all before  became Lloyd Abbott -- Mr
Abbott
That was back when still had chicken shit on my shoes and twelve cents in my pocket
Charlie Holt was the only one good enough for Helen
used to spy on 'em -- yup,  did
(fixes a drink) Used to watch them sit on the front porch of her house -- your house -- and watch 'em talk

never knew what to say to a girl
Never could just talk
Could dance, could listen to the radio
But  couldn't talk
except with your mother, except with Helen
talked more to her after your dad died than 'd ever talked to any woman before then -- or since then
Jesus,  talked
Just like this
Just like right now
Just pouring out
Helen would listen and whatever  said, she'd never make me feel bad or ignorant or guilty
mean
for Christ's sake, she never blamed me for what happened at the lake, for letting Charlie drive out on that ice
She never did anything but try to make me hurt less and
Lloyd is startled by Joan as she opens the door
Lloyd
Get out of here
It's time for Susie's birthday cake
(exploding) Goddammit, Joan, go way
Get the hell out of here
Leave me alone
He hurls his  at her and it  on the door jamb
Joan recoils in dumb-founded shock and backs out of the doorway
Lloyd fumes over and slams the door shut in her face
He leans against the door and catches his breath
wanted sons -- isn't that funny
wanted sons and  got three daughters
wanted a woman could talk to and  got a woman whose ears are stuffed full of money and Percodan
But  got the chicken shit off my shoes

(slight beat) know that's what Jacey thinks
could always tell by the way he looked at me -- even when he was a little boy -- like  owed him something
But, goddammit, he's wrong
That bet was your father's idea and  never meant your mother any harm
would've done anything for her -- anything loved her
But the only thing she ever wanted from me was just for me to leave her alone
He pours himself a fresh drink, then turns to Doug: So, what do you want
want to find Pam -- and you're going to tell me where she is

He checks the number over the door to the address on the scrap of paper in his hand
175
- '  - 175 ( ) Doug knocks on the door
Eleanor opens it, she's dressed for work in her stewardess uniform
She's obviously surprised to find Doug on her doorstep, but she greets him with a warm smile
Where is she

As she moves behind the mannequin to fasten a garment she sees Doug standing on the other side of the glass watching her from the sidewalk
Doug writes a message on the plate glass window with his index finger (printing the letters in reverse so that the message is legible from Pam's ); his message reads: " love you

-  -              177 ( ) Pamela comes out of the store via the revolving door and finds Doug waiting for her on the sidewalk
How can you
How can  what
Ever
forgive me
You always loved me no matter what did, right
Yeah
Maybe that's how  love you -- no matter what
That's the best kind of love, you know
But
oh, Jesus
how do we start all over again
Pam's eyes fill with tears
Doug steps over to her and embraces her tenderly, holding her close
There
We're doing it
(through her tears) Doing what
Starting over
So, what are you doing tonight
You want to go out
You're crazy
Some people never change
He wipes her tears from her cheeks with his fingers, then gives a short, but sweet, kiss
Then he smiles: () 117
