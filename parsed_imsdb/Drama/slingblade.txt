href <b>// --> </b> : - few patients sit around fumbling with themselves
One man sits at a table scratching back and forth on a piece of paper with a crayon
Another stands in a corner smoking a cigarette and staring at the crayon guy
This is
Another man, , sits in a chair staring at the floor and rubbing his hands together
We cut back and forth between Charles staring and Crayon Man scratching
After a moment, an attendant approaches Charles
You can't smoke in here
Charles stares at him blankly for a moment and continues smoking
He looks back to Crayon Man again for a moment then looks over at Karl and then goes and sits down beside him
Mercury is a good car and that's what  was driving that day
've owned a lot of cars
Different kinds
Lots of different kinds of cars
She was standing, this girl, on the side of the street where there was a chicken stand; not the Colonel, mind you, but nevertheless a chicken stand, and  pulled the Mercury over and rolled down the window by electric power
She was wearing a leather skirt and she had a lot of hair on her arms
like that
like it a lot
It means a big bush
like a big bush
She said, "Are you dating
"  said, "yes," and she got in the car
We pulled to a remote location, one that she and  both felt comfortable with and she said, "How much can you spend
"  said, "What it takes to see your bush
know it's a big one
" She said "twenty five dollars," which to a working man is not chicken feed
produced the money and she put it in her shoe and pulled up her skirt
There before me lay a thin, crooked, uncircumcised penis
You can imagine how badly  wanted my twenty-five dollars back
- Two young women,  , carrying a briefcase, and , carrying two camera bags are being led down the hallway by a
don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse
Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer
That doesn't bother you
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism
Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it
(wrinkling her nose) Do you smell shit
Yeah
They reach a door and the guard ushers them through
- stands up from behind the desk as they enter
He's in his fifiles and looks like a school teacher, shop class or perhaps eighth-grade science
These are the people from that newspaper deal
Oh yeah, from the college
Yes sir
Woolridge shakes hands with them
My name's Jerry Woolridge
Nice to meet you
'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans
She's here to take the pictures
'all have a seat
Is this all of you
Yes sir
think there must have been a little mix up
told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures
It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper
But it has pictures mean it's a regular paper, you know
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made
He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage
(to guard) Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes
You girls want some coffee
No thank you
The other thing is  told your boss on the phone to send a man
Karl won't talk to women
- on Karl's face
Charles has started another monologue
There was a young man named John Liggit Hunter who was in the filling station business and a good filling station business
He was one of those young men that we run across so often in life
'm sure you've run across them, that didn't deserve the things he had
One of those things was his beautiful bride, Sarah
She was a Georgia Peach
As a matter of fact she looked more like the picture 've had in my head than any woman 've ever seen
took it upon myself to take her away from John Liggit Hunter, who didn't deserve her
'm not sure if  mentioned that he was a Frenchman who claimed to be an Englishman
It took some very strong nylon cord to take her away from him
She was a fighter as well as a Georgia Peach
' The girls look confused
don't know what to tell you
'm sorry
made myself pretty clear thought
He probably got busy and wasn't thinking
know how that is
used to teach shop and eighth grade science
Well, what do we do
We drove all the way out here
Let's just go, Marsha
No, we have to get this story
thought you'd be happy to leave
Why won't he talk to women
He has problems
You know
With all that
He won't hardly talk to anybody really
Just certain people
He's very troubled
(leaning in to Karl) shovel just makes too goddamn much racket
' (takes a drink of coffee) don't think he's talked to a woman in twenty-five or so years
That  know of anyway
That's why said to send a man
At least maybe he'd answer a question or two for a man
'm all for helping the college out, believe me
It might be a real good article or story
Can't you talk to him
Maybe talk him into it
'm a real good interviewer
Just get me in the room with him
(to guard) Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom
- Woolridge and the two women walk down the hallway
'll talk to him and see what we can do
- Woolridge is opening a door
He enters and the women follow him in
He flips on a light switch and very bright florescent lights illuminate the room
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it
He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother
But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said
And she made sure Karl knew
You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right
knew he slept in a toolshed
His mother told him that he was their punishment
Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex-- Before they were married
don't think so
Just period, think
She told him
God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of
Karl has an entire book -- a notebook
On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1
" He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write
His father's name was Franklin
That's really strange
What does it mean
One of his Daddy's Bible lessons imagine
'all pull up a chair
'll go out and talk to him
on Charles's face
You have to make something explode to truly understand it
You have to examine the tiny particles while they're on fire
Off screen we hear  approaching
We pull back and see  the guard
Karl,  gotta take you down to the old classroom
Mr
Woolridge has some people for you to see down there
Come on
Let's go
- Melvin and Karl walk down the hallway
Woolridge stands outside the door of the classroom
They reach him and Woolridge talks quietly to Karl
Karl, you know, do you remember when  told you about those people from that newspaper
(pause) They want to ask you some questions about your release
They think it would make an interesting story
Will you talk to 'em
Get interviewed
(pause) Now, they're women
think it might be good for you to
You're gonna be seein' all kinds of people when you go on the outside
This'll help you  believe
- It's just Woolridge and the two women in the room
Well, it surprised the dickens out of me
He said he'll talk to you
Marsha smiles and looks at Theresa
(') But, here's the thing
He'll only talk to you
He doesn't want you to ask him anything
And you shouldn't stare at him
How am  going to conduct an interview if  can't ask him any questions
It's the best you're gonna get
'm sorry
Can  ask you a question
If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out
What if he does it again
It happens all the time
He's free
His time's up
That's the rules
He's been treated and reevaluated
He doesn't show any signs any more
Signs
Homicidal signs
Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl
hope you can see to write
Woolridge turns on a lamp on a desk and turns off the overhead lights
He opens the door and Melvin brings Karl in
In the semidarkness Woolridge pushes a chair up and motions for Marsha to sit
Karl stands beside Melvin motionless
Woolridge whispers to Theresa
(') You'll have to step outside
Theresa starts to protest
(') Please
Karl sits down in a folding chair near a lamp as Melvin ushers Theresa outside into the hallway
Karl sits staring at the floor
Rubbing his palms together and breathing strangely, as usual
He sits silent for what seems like forever
- Theresa stands on one side of the door, Melvin on the other
Can  just sneak in there
won't take any pictures,  promise just want to listen
No ma'am
'm sorry you can't
Theresa takes a cigarette from her purse and starts to light it
(') You can't smoke in here
'm sorry
- Marsha is staring at Karl
Karl, still breathing and rubbing his palms, starts to speak
His voice is low and raspy, but not just low and raspy; strange
Well,  reckon what you're a wanting to know is what 'm doing in here
reckon the reason 'm in here is 'cause  killed somebody
But  reckon what you was a wanting to know is how come me to kill somebody
Well,  reckon 'll start at the front and tell you
(pause, heavy breathing) lived most of my life out behind my mother and father's house in a little old shed and my daddy'd built for me
They didn't too much want me up there in the house with the rest of 'em
mostly just set around out there in the shed all the time a lookin' at the ground
It didn't have no floor but  had me a hole dug out to lay down in and a quilt or tow that  put down there
(pause, more breathing) My daddy was a hard workin' man most of his life, not that  can say the same fer myself
most just set around the shed and tinkered around with a lawn mower or two and went to school off and on from time to time but the children there made quite a bit of sport of me, made fun of me quite a bit
Some of 'em roughed me up sometimes so mostly  stayed out back there in the shed
My daddy worked down at the sawmill there, down there at the planer mill for an old man named Dixon
Old man Dixon was a very cruel feller, he didn't treat his employees very well, didn't pay 'em much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy much of a wage, just barely enough to get by on
But  reckon he got by all right, they come out one or the other of 'em, usually my mother, and fed me pretty regular
At least  know he made enough for me to have mustard and biscuits three or four times a week
Old man Dixon had a boy named Jesse Dixon
Jesse was really more cruel than his daddy
He made quite a bit of sport of me and takened advantage of the little girls around the neighborhood quite a bit
(pause) He used to say my mother was a very pretty woman
He said it quite a bit from time to time, when  was at the school house
Well,  reckon you want me to get on and tell you what happened so  reckon 'll tell you
was settin' out in the shed one evenin' not doin' too much, just kindly starin' at the wall and a waitin' fer my mother to come out and give me my Bible lesson and heared a commotion up in the house there so  got up and run up on the screened-in porch there to see what was a goin' on, and  looked in the kitchen window and  seen my mother a layin' there on the floor without any clothes on
(pause, breathing) And seen Jesse Dixon a layin' on top of her having his way with her
(pause) Well,  just seen red
picked up a kaiser blade that was a layin' there by the screen door, some folks calls it a sling blade, call it a kaiser blade
It's just a long handle like a axe handle with a long blade on it that's shaped kind of like a banana
Sharp on one edge and dull on the other
It's what the highway boys use to cut down weeds and whatnot
went in the kitchen there and hit Jesse Dixon up side the head with it and knocked him off my mother
reckon that didn't quite satisfy me so  hit him again in the neck with the sharp edge and just plumb near cut his head off
Killed him
Well, my mother, she jumped up from there and started yellin', "What did you kill Jesse fer
What did you kill Jesse fer
" (pause, intense breathing) Well, come to find out my mother didn't really mind what Jesse was a doin' to her
reckon that made me madder than what Jesse had made me
takened the kaiser blade, some folks calls it a sling blade, call it a kaiser blade and hit my mother up side the head with it an' killed her
(long pause, breathing) Some folks has asked me if  had it to do over again would  do the same thing
don't know,  reckon would
Anyhow, they seen fit to put me in here and here 've been for a great long while
've learned to read some; took me four years to read the Bible
reckon understand a good deal of it
It wasn't what  expected in a lot of places
've slept in a good bed for a great long while
They've seen fit to put me out now
They tell me they're a settin' me free today
Anyhow,  reckon that's all you need to know
If you want any more details  reckon  can tell 'em to you
don't know if that's enough for your newspaper or not
Suddenly Marsha speaks from the darkness
Will you ever kill anybody again, Karl
This seems to startle the very room itself
Woolridge motions for Marsha to shut up and Karl stops still
Very still
He breathes hard for a moment then starts to calm down
He seems almost at ease
He slowly looks up
From Karl's point of view we barely see Marsha's face in the dim light
Karl is looking straight at Marsha
(slowly) don't reckon  got no reason to kill nobody
- Woolridge stands just outside the classroom door with Marsha and Theresa
Karl stands down the way a few feet with Melvin
Is he leaving right this minute
We've got some paperwork to take care of
Pretty soon
Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot
didn't mean that
hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all
Where will he go
Wherever he wants to
think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from
It's just about twenty miles from here
Will he be supervised
As much as anybody else is, guess
'all have a good rest of the day now
Marsha and Theresa walk toward the exit
As they pass Karl he speaks to Marsha
(looking down) Thank you
(immediately extends her hand) Thank you
Karl doesn't take her hand
Karl continues to stare at the floor until the women exit
reckon 'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people
Yes,  guess you are
reckon 'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too
You better go get your things
ain't got nothing but them books
You better go get 'em
All right then
Karl walks slowly down the hallway
-  - Karl steps off the bus carrying a few books by a strap
He stands there for moment staring at the bus station as the few people around stare at him, then he starts walking
Karl standing in front of a barbershop looking through the window at a man having his hair cut
In front of the police station
Staring at an empty school yard
- Karl stands and stares at the building for a moment
He sees a woman take a tray of food from the window
When she's gone, he walks up to the window
pimply-faced comes to wait on him
Can  help you
was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat
Well, what did you want
You have any biscuits for sale
Naw, we don't have biscuits
Karl stands in silence for a moment
(') Did you decide, sir
What you got that's good to eat
Well,  guess it's all good
What do you like to eat here
French fries
like to eat them pretty good
French-fried potaters
Yeah
How much you want fer 'em
'll get some of them  reckon
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large
Give me the big'uns
Karl digs in his pocket for money
- Karl sits on a bench eating french fries
After a moment, a twelve- or thirteen-year-old  comes out of the laundromat wrestling three or four big bags of laundry
He can't seem to get a plan together for carrying them all
Karl gets up and goes over to him
The boy looks up at Karl, a little startled by Karl's strange figure looming over him
These dang things are heavy
Hard to carry, too
What you got in there, warshing
Yeah
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it
got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store
My daddy's dead
(pause) He got hit by a train
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh
About a half a mile  think it is
'll help you tote 'em if  don't give out first
Okay
You don't have to though
Karl picks up two sacks and they walk away
- They walk in silence for a while before the boy finally speaks
My name is Frank Wheatley
What's your name
Karl's my name
() What's you last name
Childers
What are all them books
Different ones
One's the Bible
One of 'ems a book on Christmas
One of 'ems how to be a carpenter
How come you're carryin' them around with you
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down
Don't you live somewhere
did live there in the state hospital
Why'd you live there
killed some folks quite awhile back
They said  wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail
They let you out
Yeah
How come
They told me  was well
They had to turn me loose
Are you well
reckon  feel all right
You don't seem like you'd kill nobody
They reach a little white frame house and the boy turns up the sidewalk
(') This is my house
You can just set those bags on the porch
Karl sets the bags down and he and the boy stare at each other in silence for a moment
(') Do you like to play football
never was much count at it never did get picked out fer it
Me and the Burnett twins and some boys plays down at the junior high practice field all the time
If you ever want to come by and play
We ain't no good either
Well, 'll see you later
He goes inside leaving Karl staring at the front door
- Karl stands at the counter
middle-aged man is selling tickets
How does a feller go about gettin' up to the state hospital
You buy a ticket for fourteen dollars and then set and wait for the four-fifteen bus to Kelton
All right then
- Karl walks down the hallway carrying his books
couple staffers give him 'Why are you still here' looks
He reaches a door and goes in
- There is no one at the desk in the outer office, so Karl goes into Woolridge's office
'  - Karl finds Woolridge doing paper work
Woolridge looks up startled
Karl, what in the world are you doing here
want to come back and stay here
Well, you can't do that
You're a free man
You've been let out to do as you please
reckon  don't care nothin' about bein' a free man
don't know how to go about it
Well, you have to learn
It'll take some time
Don't you know anybody down there to help you out
Naw
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me
(pause) guess he wouldn't help you any, would he
wasn't thinking
You don't know anybody
Naw
Never did know too much of nobody
Not to he'p me out anyway
(sighs) Listen, Karl, the truth is  don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do
If it was up to me, 'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted
'm just doin' my job
(they sit in silence for a moment) You follow me
(no answer) Listen,  know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg
He used to go to church with me
You're good workin' on small engines and things
If  put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you
'm pretty handy  reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot
know, 've seen it myself
Would you give that a try
reckon
can't promise he'll hire you
'll have to tell him about your history
never was no good with history
No,  mean your past
About why you were in here
(pause) 'll take you first thing in the mornin'
You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all
just can't let you stay here
It's the rules
If something happened well, 'd be liable
reckon  can just walk around till the mornin'
Or set and read me a book somewhere
They sit and stare at each other for a moment
- Woolridge, his , his teenage , , and teenage sit in various comfortable chairs looking extremely uncomfortable and staring at Karl, who is sitting on the edge of a chair looking at the floor
After a long creepy moment, Mom speaks
Karl, would you like a muffin
No thank ye
understand Jerry is going to take you somewhere else tomorrow
don't reckon  know nobody name Jerry
She's talkin' about me, Karl
That's my first name
He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where  was borned
Would you like some coffee
Coffee makes me a might nervous when  drink it
Daddy, can  be excused to go to bed
Sure, honey
You sleep with Mama tonight
'll sleep with your brother and Karl can take your room
Why
We have company
Now you go on
- It's an all-American girls room
Everything is pink
There are stuffed animals everywhere and posters of pop idols
Well, Karl, there's plenty of blankets and things there
Bathroom's right there in the hall
We'll leave first thing tomorrow
Karl stands in the middle of the room holding his books
Woolridge closes the door
- Woolridge walks into the kitchen where Mom and Son sit at the table
Jerry, why didn't you give him Bubba's room
Sister's is kind of girly, isn't it
Yeah,  thought about that
No sense in moving him now  guess
Daddy, don't you think one of us ought to stay up all night and kind of - guard or somethin'
Why, hell no, son
What's wrong with you
Well, he's crazy
He's a nut ain't he
'Isn't' he, Bubba
Don't say ain't
- Woolridge, already dressed, walks through the den and down the hallway
He knocks on the bedroom door
Karl, you up
(
) Yes sir
Woolridge opens the bedroom door and sees Karl sitting on the edge of the bed beside his books
The light is on, the bed still as it was the night before
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl
You been sittin' there like that all night
Yes sir
Well,  guess we better hit the road
- Woolridge's car pulls into the parking lot
He and Karl get out and walk toward the shop
- Two men,  , a large man in his forties, and , a really country-looking guy in his thirties, look up from behind the counter as Woolridge and Karl enter
Woolridge goes to the counter, Karl stands by the door looking at the floor
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'
Good to see you
Been a long time
Good to see you, Bill
How's everybody doin'
Aw, pretty good
Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse
Can't complain other than that
Wouldn't do any good if  did
(laughs) Do you know Scooter, Jerry
No, don't guess  do
(he shakes hands with Scooter who sort of smiles) Scooter, good to meet you
(Woolridge leans in and gets confidential) This is him, the one  talked to you about on the phone
Now like said, 'll understand if you get nervous about it
'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young
remember it real well
Cut them folks to pieces
His mama one of 'em
And that ol' Dixon boy
Hell, always wanted to kill him myself
Asshole's what he was
remember that ol' boy (points to Karl) too
Kind of retarded or somethin' back in school
Well, he seems pretty well-adjusted these days
don't think he'd ever hurt anybody
Don't look much like he could
You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness
He's a regular whiz at it
That's all he did when he was a kid
Well,  ain't scared of him workin' here
You know me
'm a church goin' man
Forgivin' man
When your time's up the Lord's gonna come git you
You seared of him, Scooter
don't guess
Can he talk
Oh yeah
Listen  really appreciate it
He needs the job
don't know what to do with him
He don't have anybody really
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street believe
He won't have anything to do with him
Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back
Fine with me
If he steals anything, 'll take it out of your pocket anyway
Bill slaps Woolridge on the shoulders and wheezes with laughter
He won't steal
'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy
Keeps to himself
Well, 've got a roomful of work for him to do
Can't get Scooter to do any of it
Karl, come over here
want you to meet your new boss
(Karl obediently shuffles over) This is Bill Cox, runs this place
Says you can work here and stay in the back
Good to know you, Karl
Thank ye
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there
Karl doesn't say anything
That'll be fine
Karl, 'll go to the car and get your books
Woolridge exits
Bill and Scooter just stare at Karl and Karl stares at the floor
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things
've tinkered around on 'em a little bit
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually
We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little
like them french-fried potaters
(long pause) Yeah, me too
They make a good double meat burger
- The place is cluttered with mowers, edgers, weed-eaters, and other equipment, most of it in pieces
small cot is in a little clearing in the corner by the bathroom
Karl is sweeping up oil with sawdust and a push broom while Scooter puts some tools away
Bill comes to the door
All right then, 'll see y'all later
Karl you done a good day's work
They right about you
Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful
'll see you tomorrow
Wait up, 'll leave with you and lock up
Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with
(pause) Now there's one more thing
The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out
You didn't want to go anywhere, did you
don't reckon
If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to
See you later
They leave Karl standing in the midst of the lawn mowers
He sets the broom down and goes and sits on the cot
After a moment, he gets back up and starts sweeping again
- It's lunch time and Bill, Scooter, and Karl are sitting in folding chairs behind the counter eating from their Dairy Queen to-go bags
Karl has french fries
Scooter, did  tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge
can't remember
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas
Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold
" Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too
" (starts wheezing) Get it
That's a goodun
(laughing) Yeah, that's a goodun
believe you did tell me that one before
've heard that a bunch
Long time ago
Well, yeah it's a classic
You know, Karl,  got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key
mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up
You need to come and go as you please
Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door
(Karl takes the key and keeps eating french fries) Them french fries good
Yeah, they's good all right
You got any money
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose
spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters
Well, 'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money
When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there
Some hard candy and some magazines
Somethin' to keep you busy at night
All right then
'll let you off while it's still daylight
- Karl is walking down a residential street
He stops in front of the house where the boy, Frank, lives and stares at the house for a moment, then he walks up to the door and stares at it
curtain moves and the boy's face appears at the window
He comes and opens the door
Hey there
thought  heard somebody on the porch
Wasn't your name Karl
Yeah it is
Your name's Frank
Yeah
What you doin' by here
You told me to come by
Did you want to play ball with us
ain't no good at it
just come by
Well, anyhow,  was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store
She's workin' two till eight
All right then
He starts to walk away
Wait a minute
You want to go with me
You can meet my mama
don't want to worry your mama with company
Aw, come on
You'll like her
She's real nice
She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to
Candy or somethin'
was kindly needin' to do some tradin'
Reckon they sell toothpaste
They sell some of everything
Come on let's go
won't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin'
'   - Frank and Karl make their way through the fairly crowded store
It's sort of a mini-version of a Walmart
They find Frank's mother in her red smock talking to a guy in a red Ben's knit shirt
They are laughing together and pricing some mouthwash
is a short, plain woman in her thirties
The man,  , is in his forties, with a neat flattop hair cut, glasses, and a paunch hanging over his belt
They eye Karl suspiciously, as the boys approach
Hey, Mama
Hey, Vaughan
Hey, sweetheart
What you up to
Let me guess
You want a bunch of candy and a pop
Yeah
You're gonna rot your teeth that way
But  bet  know what you would like even better
put potted meat on special, four cans for a dollar and they're not moving very well
'd sure let a few cans go for free to the right boy
don't like potted meat
Daddy used to say it was made out of lips and peckers and intestints
Frank, don't talk that way
Who's that strange lookin' man behind you
Did he follow you in here
Can  help you, sir
Oh, that's Karl
met him at the laundrymat
Karl, this is my mama
And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager
He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends
Nice to meet you, Karl
(keeping his distance) Pleased to know y'all
There's an uncomfortable silence
Frank come back here with me for a minute
She shuffles him away and leaves Vaughan staring at Karl
don't think 've ever seen you before
Naw,  don't believe you have don't reckon  never been in here
This store didn't used to be here
It's been here seventeen years
Did you live here before or something
's horned and raised here up till 's twelve year old
What brings you back
What's that you say
Why are you here now
They turned me loose from the state hospital
Is that right
(pause) Are you going to be staying here long
reckon Mr
Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit
Do you have family here
Not really to speak of
Linda and Frank return from the back
Hey Karl, guess what
Mama said you can stay with us
Out in the garage
Our car won't fit in there anyway
It's real neat
Frank told me about your situation
And Frank loves company
You know, especially after his daddy passed and all
There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop
(to Vaughan, hushed) He's mentally retarded, poor thing
(hushed) He just got out of the state hospital
(put out) know
Can we get some candy and pops
Sure, go ahead
They walk off down the aisle leaving Vaughan a little puzzled
(') Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy
Frank's just crazy about him
He likes the way he talks
He helped him carry home the clean laundry
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him
He's retarded's all
You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass
What about me
don't think he sees you as a guy guy
(wrinkles his brow) Karl is a guy guy
- Karl and Frank sit on stumps in a little clearing enjoying the spoils of their Ben's Dollar Store visit
This is what  call my secret place 'cause  come out here when  feel like bein' by myself
used to come here with Karen Cross
She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be
She says she likes Jerry Maroney now
But 'm gonna get her back 'cause  love her
We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight
She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause  don't have any money
Well, mama and me, mean
She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though
She said she loved me, too
Out here
Settin' right on that stump you're on
See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich
So's Jerry Maroney's daddy
He owns the ice plant
Was your folks well off
Naw
Didn't have too much
Enough to scrape by on,  reckon
They still around, your folks
My mother's dead
My daddy's s'posed to be around still
He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though
How do you know
He never did want to
figure he ain't changed his mind much
How did your mama die
(long pause) You don't need to know all of that
You're just a boy
You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy
They'll be plenty of time for the other
've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died
Sometimes wish  was still real little and he was still here
My mama's real good, but  wish  had both of 'em
(pause) When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road
But  wadn't scared because  thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us
feel that way about mama now
(he looks at the ground for a moment) Mama has a boyfriend now
His name is Doyle Hargraves
He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'
He still don't help mama out with any money though
He ain't no good
He's mean to her
He don't like me at all
Mama says it's because he's jealous  belong to my daddy instead of him
He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house
Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends like it on the nights when he ain't at our house
'm not so nervous then
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her
She says it's for the times when he's good to her
She's lonely since daddy died
She said sometimes she don't know why
(pause) He threatened to kill her if she ever left him
My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama
Vaughan, he's real good to mama
Vaughan that you met
But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know
Not funny ha, ha, funny queer
He likes to go with men instead of women
That makes him not to be able to fight too good
He sure is nice though
He's from St
Louis
People who are queer can get along better in a big town
He got transferred here to work
But mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him
For bein' the way he is
wish he liked to go with women
'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle
Pause as Frank looks at the ground again
He seems troubled
(') Karl
(pause) You know when  said daddy got hit by a train
Yeah,  remember you a-tellin' me that
It ain't the truth
He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose
Why did he do that, reckon
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to
That's what the letter said
He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs thought he took care of us fine
(pause) Karl, did you really kill somebody
Yeah,  did
Who did you kill
Two people
Were they bad people
thought they was
Maybe they needed it
growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody
It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself
If it's self-defense
Was it self-defense
Karl shifts around and makes a noise in his throat and doesn't answer
(') My daddy was good
think too many good people die
It ain't right
That's what  think
- Karl is tying the strap around his books
His sack of toiletries is on the bed
Bill Cox comes in
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks
You're welcome to keep on stayin here
It's workin' out real good
That boy wants me to
All right then
'll see you bright and early
How you comin' along on that garden tiller
fixed it
Hit's a workin' pretty good
You done fixed it
'll be damned
Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed
'Course Scooter's about as shitless as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be
You done fixed it
'll just be damned
See you tomorrow
- is in the comfortable easy chair with adjuster handle drinking beer
He's in his late thirties and dressed in his construction clothes
Linda sits on the arm of the chair and Frank stands before them
Well, honey,  don't guess  give a shit
ain't here half the time anyway
If you want a retard livin' in the garage,  don't guess care
've got a good tool box and socket set out there  don't want stol'd
guess  could take it home with me
He's real honest
He wouldn't steal nothin'
Now son,  wadn't talkin' to you, was
(pause) Was
No sir
No sir's right
'm talkin' to your mama
This is your mama's decision, not yours
'm lettin' it go on because she asked me, not you
(to Linda) Now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that, 'cause  have trouble eatin' around that kind of thing
Just like  am about antique furniture and midgets
can't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture
Same thing with a droolin' retard
Doyle, you're awful
You shouldn't be that way
ain't sayin' it's right
'm just tellin' the truth
What was he in the nuthouse for
He's just mentally retarded, guess
He had of went nuts and did somethin'
They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard
They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse
Do you know, Frank
ain't sure
You might want to find out
He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him
mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know
'm sure it's nothin'
He seems real sweet
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet
(takes a long pull on his beer) Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend
thought he was comin' by here for something
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream
Ain't that the sweetest thing
What am  supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag
You're not crippled
Get in there and make somethin'
Boy, ain't you somethin' else
Talkin' back and everything
It kinda makes me horny when you talk back
Frank, why don't you go off and play in your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty
want to watch
Yeah, honey, let the kid watch
Hell, let's all watch
like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here
- Karl is standing on the porch with his bag and his books staring at the door
After a moment, we hear a car door slam and footsteps on the porch
Then we hear Vaughan's voice
Karl
Karl turns to face Vaughan
Yes sir
So, you're really going to stay here
That boy wants me to
Did you knock on the door yet
Naw,  ain't
How long have you been standing here
Quite a spell,  reckon
Listen, before you get very used to staying here,  think you and need to talk about a few things
Can  take you to lunch
done et just a little bit ago
mean tomorrow or the next day
reckon  can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow
Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters
But  reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow
Okay, 'll come by Mr
Cox's and get you at noon
They stand therefor a moment
Vaughan doesn't really know exactly what else to do, so he knocks on the door
After a moment, Frank answers the door
Hey
'all come on in
- Vaughan ushers Karl in and they stand behind the sofa
Doyle looks up and grins
Hey, Vaughan
How are you, Karl
Tolerable,  reckon
(in a hurry to get out) Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle
Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'
Vaughan, you ready to go
Sure,  guess
Don't rush ever'body, honey
She starts to get her things together
(to Frank) Maybe you and Karl want to go with us
Naw,  don't want to
Me and Karl got things we need to do
Hey, Vaughan, you know what heard
heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home
know Albert
We're friends
heard you was more than friends
heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney
That's ridiculous
That's just a total lie
Let's go, Vaughan
(they start for the door) Frank, we'll be back in a little while
'll bring you back somethin'
You're food's in the oven warmin' over
See, you made him somethin'
Hey Vaughan,  was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy
(smiles a little) Yeah,  knew that
You're a card all right
Linda kisses Frank on the forehead and they leave
So, Karl, come have a seat, talk to me
Karl sits on the couch
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage
Goddamnit, 'm talkin' to the man
You set right there, Karl
Frank leans on the sofa arm beside Karl
(') What's in your bag
This and that
Toothpaste and whatnot
What's all them books
Different ones
The Bible's one of 'em
You believe in the Bible
good deal of it,  reckon
Can't understand all of it
Well,  can't understand none of it
This one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another
Just how retarded are you
Stop it, Doyle
You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'
The adults are talkin'
Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet
ain't never used no hatchet that remember
You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then
(pause) It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause ain't afraid of shit
You think 'm afraid for you to stay here
You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me
Not really, 'm just jokin' with you
Welcome to our humble home, buddy
Frank needs all the friends he can get
Frank's a real weak little kid
His daddy taught him how to be a pussy
Stop it, Doyle
Don't talk about daddy, you hear me
(mocking) Don't talk about daddy
'all go on to the garage and let me be
Frank is crying now
Come on, Karl
They get up and walk away
(yelling to Frank) Don't tell your mama we had a little spat
She don't need to be worried with your ass
- Karl sits on an old sofa and Frank sits on an upside down paint bucket, still upset
'd like to kill that son of a bitch
hate him
You ort not to talk that way
You're just a boy
Well,  hate him
He ort not to talk that away to you neither
He ain't no count
He's mean to you and your mama
(pause) Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly
Will you stay here with us for a long time
reckon if you want me to
(pause) got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some
don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of
reckon it tastes pretty good to me
like the way you talk
like the way you talk
Karl starts to put together a cracker and potted meat delight as we: : - Vaughan is carrying a tray of food as Karl follows him to a table and they sit and immediately start to eat
After a few bites, Vaughan starts to speak in an official manner
Okay, Karl, the reason  brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind
(pauses for a response, instead Karl eats french fries and stares at the table) guess 'll put it right out on the table
Where do  start
Linda and Frank are very important to me
They're like family
My own family was never like family
They're horrible people
As a matter of fact  prayed every night for years that my father would die
finally realized through a lot of therapy that  was wasting my energy on hating him
Now  just don't care
(pause) You see, you and  are a lot alike, strange as that may seem
mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life
We're different
People see us as being different anyway
You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and , well mine's not as easy to see
'm just going to say it
'm gay
(watts) Does that surprise you
(watts) That 'm gay
You know what being gay is, don't you
reckon not
Homosexual
like men
Sexually
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer
Well that's a very offensive way to put it
You shouldn't say that
You were taught that, weren't you
've heard it said that way
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this
've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it
Anyway, 'm rambling
If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy
Doyle is a monster
Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster
dangerous person
've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy
Maybe even kill one of them see it in his eyes
'm very in tune, maybe even psychic
Doyle will make your life hell
You're a perfect target
When  first saw you  was afraid of you
Not really afraid,  guess, just taken aback
But also,  felt a real sensitive feeling from you
And for some reason, Frank has adopted you
Much like a stray animal
'm sorry, didn't mean it like that
In a good way
Anyway,  just want you to know what you're in for
have a good feeling about you
You're good for Frank
Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level
'm sorry,  didn't mean it in a bad way
(pause) There's one more thing
It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital
Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible
But what see before me is a gentle, simple man
All  want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank
You know
You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you
wouldn't never hurt them
That's what  thought
hope haven't offended you in any way
You seem like a thinker
You seem to always be in deep thought
Tell me something
What are you thinking right now
Karl looks up and stares for a moment
was thinkin'  could use me another helpin' of these potaters
Oh
How about before that
Before that  was thinkin' it'd be good if  could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry
- Linda, Frank, and Doyle are eating
How come Karl won't eat here with us
don't know
He just said he'd eat out there
Well,  wouldn't let it get to you
just feel sorry for the poor thing
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat
He does make some funny noises
sure like the way he talks
It sounds like a race car motor idlin'
It makes me not be nervous
'm glad of it, honey
What have you got to be nervous about
You're a damn kid
You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time
get nervous, that's all  know
They eat in silence for a while
Linda and Frank know where this conversation could lead and know when to leave well enough alone
You know what, by God
What
You know what we ought to do tonight
Please Doyle, don't
Have a damn party
Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off
'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys
They'd get a kick out of that
Don't you know they would
Please don't
Not tonight
'm not up for it
They always stay till mornin'
'm just give out, Doyle
You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here
That ain't none of your damn bidness
Besides that's the way friends do one another
Fuck it, 'm gonna go call 'em
Honey, find my guitar,  think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune
- Karl sits on his cot eating from the plate Frank brought him
Frank and Linda come through the door
Frank comes and sits beside Karl
Linda gets a guitar case down from a shelf and comes over and stands in front of Karl
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house
Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio
They ain't even no good
The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers
He claims he's an Indian
His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill
He can at least play guitar
He's no more an Indian than  am though
Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends
Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes
You just ignore it
Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you
He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk
guarantee it
He ain't ever okay to me
The garage door opens and Doyle appears
He seems really happy
Well, it's on
We're gonna rock
Linda, call Vaughan
Tell him to get over here
'd like him to be here
owe him a good time
No Doyle
Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you
Too late, Honey
Fooled you
Done called him
He'll be here
(grins) Or 'll go get him
Come on Karl, need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank
- White Christmas tree lights are strung above the patio
Karl sits to the side in a kitchen chair staring at the ground alongside Vaughan, Frank, and Linda
The "band" is set up on the patio
The band consists of , a heavyset guy in a military uniform on tambourine, , a skinny guy in a wheelchair on bass, , a long haired younger guy who's not an Indian on guitar, Doyle on a guitar which he can't play and  "The Johnson " Johnson, a large guy with a Top beard on drums
tub of beer is in front of them
They're all hooting and hollering and drinking
They've obviously been at it for a while
Doyle steps forward to address the 'crowd
' Okay ladies and gentlemen (points to Vaughan) or both
It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band
Over here on lead guitar Mr
Randy Horsefeathers
Come on hit a hot lick, Randy
(Randy plays a lick) Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now
Come on
(they clap a little except for Karl) Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on
Karl claps his hands a little
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins
(more half-assed clapping) On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group
(claps) On drums "The Johnson
" (claps) And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour
Come on, a big hand for these guys
They're workin' their asses off here
(pauses for a slug of beer) Okay 'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight
To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl
Childers
Karl Childers just in from the state facility
Make one of them gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it is you do
(nothing) Oh well, Karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell 'm talkin' about
And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients
Now that takes balls
Our number one tune for the folks, boys
Kick it off Johnson
They play "Walk Don't Run" while the audience of four sits in motionless silence
They finish the song and hoot and holler and drink some more and say nasty things to each other
(') You like that Vaughan
Sure
It sounded like a number one tune all right
You enjoying yourself, Karl
reckon
We hear the voice of an    in the near distance
(
) wished you all would lay off for tonight
can't hear myself think for that racket
It's nighttime, now let folks be
'll call the law
(hollers back) told you already three times, the laws on my side
play cards with Shelnutt, chief' of police
Get fucked you old bastard
(to the party) Okay now, Linda, you and the kid clean up and get a tarpaulin over this instruments
Me and the boys are goin' to the county line
We're out of liquor and beer
Come on Karl, you and Vaughan are goin' with us
'd better go on home now, it's late
have to work tomorrow
Come on, don't be a pussy
Everybody has to work
He don't want to Doyle
Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to
You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk
(very sincere) But honey, 'll be good
promise
love you sweetie
'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things
'  - Doyle is driving, Vaughan in the middle, and Karl by the window
Doyle cranks up the truck and pops in a cassette tape
The first few notes of "Ghost Riders in the Sky" play
Are you sure you can drive
You've really had a lot of alcohol
Shhhh
This is the national anthem
They take off, tires screaming on the pavement as the song goes louder
- The truck fishtails into the night and we see the rest of the "band" in the back of the truck trying to control Terence's wheelchair as it rolls back and forth
- (points to tape player) Not that you afflicted sons of bitches would know anything about it, but this is art
They are stopped by a red traffic light
police car pulls up beside them and Doyle looks over at the -  on the passenger side and turns down the music
(') Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass
Yeah She was a big 'un
You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle
Yeah
figured that
Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back
You'll throw him out
Looks like you got a wagonful
We run outta somethin' to drink
Goin' to the county line
You want to race
(laughing) You know better than that
We're on duty
Catch me in that Camaro next week one night
Catch you later Freddy
Doyle peels out and the music blares again
(') bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you
Oh, yeah, 'm thrilled
Sarcastic right
(pause) You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight
We'd be glad to have you
- Doyle slouches in his chair drinking whiskey from the bottle
Terence and Morris are sitting facing Karl and Vaughan who are on the sofa
Randy and The Johnson are sitting across the room in straight-backed chairs drinking beer
They really stocked up at the county line and beer and liquor bottles are strewn everywhere
Morris is in the middle of a monologue, which has obviously been going on for awhile
Anyhow 'm not sure if you follow me on those particular points, but it's not really important in the smaller picture, which is where most people dwell anyway
Not that being manager of Ben's Dollar Store is insignificant
Or that making it through years of incarceration in a state supported facility is any small feat
Morris, he's the only one in the band that went to college
'm in junior college right now over in Westfield
That ain't no college, that's trade school
Auto repair ain't ever made a genius out of nobody
Holidays are for campers
What do you know about bein' a genius, Johnson
You can't even hardly keep a steady beat on that high-price drum set
think y'all play really tight together, Randy
'all shouldn't throw off on one another
Anything that has to be discussed can't mean anything
You got that shit right
What exactly do you mean by that don't understand
Exactly the point, my young levelheaded friend
don't get it
rest my case
Morris is real smart with philosophies and things
That's why him and me are the songwriting team of our group
make up good tunes or melodies as we call them and Morris is the lyrics
Not unlike Gary Brooker of the Protocol Harum
We don't ever play any songs that y'all wrote
never even heard one of 'em
'all just talk
We don't even play any songs with words at all that  remember
We ain't got no fuckin' microphone
Or speaker set up
We wrote one last night standin' outside Mini-Mart
Morris called it "Stuart Drives a Comfortable Car
" Then, you know, like on country songs in parenthesis it says "There is usually someone in the trunk
" came up with a tune just humming
See Vaughan, you shouldn't question a genius
Morris is a modern day poet like in the old days
Our latest composition is as follows: entitled: "The Thrill" -- " stand on the hill Not for a thrill but for a breath of a fresh kill Never mind the man who contemplates doing away with license plates He stands alone anyway Baking the cookies of discontent By the heat of a laundrymat vent Leaving his soul" (Then like in poetry  have dot dot dot then drop down to the next line kind of off center
) "Leaving his soul parting waters Under the medulla oblongata of (then dot dot dot again) mankind
" Silence for a moment as everyone in the room just stares at something other than Morris
don't think that's right believe dot dot dot come between medulla and oblongata or something like that
(Morris stares at him) Well it did
It wadn't before mankind,  know that much
The dots are where  say they are
Melody and tune
That's your trade
You're a tunesmith Terence
don't really understand the meaning of the words
If y'all don't shut up 'm gonna go out of my mind
And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head
He's already off balance
That wadn't the way you made it up before, Morris
That's all  know
We don't need fancy words, we need to practice
We don't ever rehearse
We need some payin' gigs instead of just messin' around on first one patio and then another'n
Morris, you should just be the manager, you can't play nothin' anyway
Doyle jumps up and throws his whiskey bottle through the window
He has changed from groggy drunk to a wild-eyed madman in a flash
We don't have a goddamn band
'all just shut the fuck up
We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band
Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers
Am  the only one sane human bein' around here
Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's
'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot
You mind your own business
Now get out
Now, before  get too mad to turn back
What about our instruments
Doyle grabs the handles of Terence's wheelchair and pushes him right out the screen door
We hear the chair clatter down the steps and a cry of pain from Terence
Now
They all file out the door except Vaughan and Karl who sit frozen on the sofa
(turning back) You ain't right Doyle
Somethin's wrong with you
Nobody needs your shit
(stops at the door) The dots just look good on paper
You don't sing 'em anyway
You're showing your true Aries colors now
Get out of my goddamn face, you fuckin' buzzard
He slams the door and turns to see Vaughan and Karl on the sofa and Linda and Frank, in their nightclothes, standing in the doorway
(') thought  told everybody to get out of my house
That includes cocksuckers and retards
Get off your asses and go
This is not your house, Doyle
This is my house and 'll say who stays and goes
You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it
You know better than to talk like that when 'm hurtin'
Don't make me knock the piss out of you
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her
That's funny
(to Linda) You go to bed and take snot nose with you
Linda walks up to him with Frank close behind
Vaughan gets up also
Karl stares at the floor rubbing his hands together
You're not stayin' here tonight
Go get sober before you come back
'm tired of my child seein' this
Now you get yourself straight or 'll lock your ass out of my life for good
You know what  told you, you even think of leavin' me, 'll kill you dead as a doornail
That might be better than this
'm a witness
heard you threaten her life
thought  told you to keep out
Leave
Don't tell me what to do
Leave
Don't tell me what to do
Leave
Don't tell me what to do
Leave
(an inch from her face) Don't tell me what to do
She shoves him in the chest and he slaps her hard in the face
Vaughan starts looking for a weapon and Frank goes wild
He starts throwing anything he can find at Doyle
Empty cans, bottles, a lampstand
He connects with an encyclopedia to the head
Doyle goes to the door
His face has changed from angry to sad, almost pitiful
(') Okay, 'll leave and sober up
Everything's botherin' me, that's all
'm hurtin' Linda
love you
hate you
Well,  hate you, too
No  don't
love your mama
Nobody understands what  go through
'll leave
You bunch of freaks have fun
'll call you tomorrow honey
'm sorry
You can kiss my ass, really
(to Frank) You ever hit me again you little bastard and 'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out
He leaves and slams the door
Frank goes to Linda's side, as does Vaughan
You all right, Mama
'm fine, honey
Let's just try and forget about tonight
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama
No, honey, we don't
(pause) 'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess
Karl, you want some coffee, huh
No, ma'am
Coffee kindly makes me nervous when  drink it
: - Linda cleaning up the last of the mess
Frank comes in sleepy eyed in his pajamas
What are you doin' up again, Frank
You need to get a little sleep
Did Vaughan go home
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while
do too
Did Karl go to bed
guess
He went to the garage
Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess
He probably wants to go back and live in Mr
Cox's shop
bet he don't
Karl likes me
know he does
Mama
Huh
Is everything gonna be all right someday
just stay nervous all the time just about
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he
promise we're gonna get away from him
The time has to be right, that's all
'd rather him get tired of me and leave me
Then he wouldn't want to hurt me
He wouldn't care then
We'll be fine
promise
You go to bed now
(she hugs him) love you
love you, too, Mama
He goes to his room
- Linda goes into the kitchen and pours a cup of coffee and sits at the table
After a moment, she looks up and is startled to see Karl in the doorway
You scared me
didn't aim to
Want to sit down
Did you need somethin'
No ma'am
Karl just keeps standing there and Linda keeps staring
(') Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water
One of 'em came from Arkansas,  believe
(puzzled) 'll be dog
More silence
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits
Right now
Just whenever you take a notion to
don't aim to put you out
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway
can't go to sleep
have to be at work in three hours
You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all
Yes ma'am
Well, set down and 'll make some biscuits and gravy
Mustard's good on 'em to me
Okay
Karl sets at the table and Linda starts to make the biscuits
Thank ye
It's all right
(pause) You know  was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me
She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face
Well, you know, she's slow
She's a little bit,  think
She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me
thought you might like to meet her
Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her
Would you like that
wouldn't mind a havin' supper
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too
He works at the funeral home
And Frank
You know Frank likes you a lot
He says you make him feel calm
like Frank
He's a good boy
Me and him's made friends
She keeps working
(') Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital
That's okay
It's not really my business
have wondered though
Why was it
Was it like a nervous breakdown
killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon
thought they was a-doin' wrong
was about your boy's age
They say 'm well now from it
Linda stops working and turns to Karl, a little shocked, but not as much as you would think
Was that you
remember that was only three or four, but always heard about it growin' up
(pause) They say you're well
Yes ma'am
(pause) like your garage
(pause) wouldn't never hurt you or your boy
'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing
believe you
really do
- Bill Cox is standing beside a garden tiller with an old man
Bill is trying to crank it up, but it won't start
car pulls into the parking lot and Gerry Woolridge gets out of it and comes over to Bill
How 'bout you, Jerry
How are you, Bill
Doin' pretty good
Got a sick tiller here
What's got you down this way
Just thought 'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out
Well, he's pretty quiet
Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does
Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything
(laughs) But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things
That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower
Loves french fries
Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch
'm proud to have him
Is him stayin' here workin' out
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage
think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot
But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases
Everything's worked out good
Can  see him
Sure
Bill looks over at Scooter, who is putting up a sale sign on new mowers in the front window
(') Scooter
Run get Karl for me
- Woolridge and Karl lean on the hood of Woolridge's car
In the background, Bill and the old man tinker with the tiller
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy
Yes sir
Do they know about you
My history
Yeah
told 'em about it
They know 'm well
That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits
'll be
That boy, he's my friend
He likes the way  talk and  like the way he talks
knew you'd do all right
Well, just wanted to check on you
'll say bye to Bill and get on back
They walk over to Bill
Karl, see if you can figure out what's wrong with this thing
It won't crank up and ever'thing seems to be put together right
Karl squats beside the tiller
'll see you, Bill
Okay, stop back by
Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good
Karl looks up from the tiller holding the gas cap
Hit ain't got no gas in it
See there
Thinks of the simplest thing first
'   - Vaughan,  the "friend," Linda, Frank, Karl, and , the Dollar-Store girl, are seated at the table
Karl and Frank are going at the delicacies while Melinda shyly picks at hers and the others are engaged in idle chit chat
This goes on for a few moments, then Albert's attention turns to Karl
So Karl, do you intend to stay in the lawnmower business for a while or do you have other plans
reckon
think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually
You should see all the books he has
He must read constantly
ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em
can't understand a lot of what  try to read
My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when  try to read
'm the same way
Of course, in my line of work,  stay too busy to read
But at least  have job security
People may stop doing a lot of things, but one thing is for sure, they won't stop dying
(looks at Frank) Why don't we talk about something a little more festive
Does everyone like the food
Nods and yeses
(') Good
haven't decided yet if 'm a good cook
Hey Karl, you know what
Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February
Isn't that somethin'
Yes ma'am,  reckon
Well, when you like pricing items as much as  do,  guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner
It's a nice night
Vaughan, don't get pushy
'm sorry
like walkin' quite a bit from time to time
stay on my feet all the time at work
just can't find shoes that's comfortable
Hospital shoes might be the answer
Nurses' shoes
Or the kind old ladies who work in the school cafeteria wear
Same difference
get real mean when my feet hurt
It's the only time  don't like checkin' out the customers, when my feet hurt
Frank, you and Karl aren't talkin' much, you boys must really like that food
just don't have anything to say about shoes
Silence for a moment
Listen everybody,  know this may sound corny, 've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but 'm going to say it anyway
It just came over me in a rush
want you all to know that  care about each and every one of you at this table
That's very sweet of you Vaughan
We care about you, too
Don't we y'all
Nods, grunts, "Sure do's
" Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay
Why
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors
Unfortunately,  have to keep certain parts of my life private
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way
Yes
think everybody at the store knows that already
They always talk about it
Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk
It's nice out
All right then
He gets up and walks toward the front door
Melinda gets up and tries to catch up
- Karl and Melinda are walking in the moonlight
It seems a little hard for Melinda to keep up
You walk fast, don't you
reckon
They walk a little farther in silence
These is the worst shoes  own for walkin'
How far did you want to go
ain't really thought about it too much  don't reckon
They walk until they disappear into the darkness
'  - Karl is on the floor working on a mower with Scooter, they are ad libbing semi-technical lawnmower things
Bill Cox appears in the door
Hey Karl, they's somebody out here to see you
Some gal holding a nice bouquet
(Karl doesn't move) Come on now, she wants to talk to you
Don't just set there
Karl gets up and goes to the counter followed by Scooter
Melinda stands on the other side of the counter holding a cellophane wrapped store-bought flower assortment
Nobody says anything for a moment
Hi, Karl, 'm on lunch break
These was on sale 'cause they're not fresh
Two ninety-nine a bunch plus my ten percent employee discount
Since  didn't bring you anything to our date last night,  thought you'd like to have 'em
She hands them to him
Thank ye
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime
can go
You don't have to
You don't never go
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on
Pardon my language, ma'am
They start to leave
At the door, Bill Cox turns and winks at Karl
They exit leaving Karl and Melinda staring at the counter
They are silent for a while
Well,  just thought 'd give you them
liked walkin' with you got a blister the size of a quarter on one heel
Well, 'll see you sometime,  guess
She walks to the door and stops as if she expects Karl to say something
blister shore can hurt
Yeah
Flowers is pretty
've always thought that
Me, too
She leaves and Karl goes to the window holding the flowers and watches her walk away
- Holding the flowers, Karl is walking down the sidewalk toward the Wheatley house when he sees Frank coming out the front door with a book and a flashlight
He sees Karl
Hey Karl, you off work
Yeah
Where'd you get them flowers
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her
was goin' to the secret place borried one of your books to take down there
You ain't mad, are you
Naw
You can look at all my books you want to
It's name's  Christmas Carol
That's than un on Christmas  was tellin' you about
You want to go with me
Yeah
- Karl and Frank sit in the clearing, Karl on the stump, Frank on the ground
Frank is shining the flashlight on the book
He finishes reading a few lines and turns off the flashlight
'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while
All right then
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they
Yeah,  reckon they did
Hit like to tore me up when  read about that pore little cripple boy
Yeah, me too
(pause) That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers
Hit was right thoughty of her
was wantin' to ask you somethin'
All right then
You know that girl  told you about
The one  love
Yeah,  recollect it
Would you go see her with me kind of thought  might take her some flowers like that woman done you
If you want me to
ain't got no money to get 'em with but  bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store
bet he will
got a little money if he don't
'll get 'em for ye
usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home
Reckon why they don't like me
They ort to
You're a good boy
Just 'cause 'm not rich don't mean don't love her
Naw
And  don't try to touch her
You know, in a bad way
Foolin' around, sex and all
That's real good
You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody
Bible tells you that much
Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, reckon
guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though
(pause) You don't touch yourself, do you
What do you mean
Pull on your works
Your privates
Oh, jackin' off
Yes sir
You ort not know that language
didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when  spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time
He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama
tried it, but  felt funny thinkin' about my mama
So,  switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened
It sure tingles, don't it
You ort not to pull on yourself that away
kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do
Just like my daddy
didn't mind him tellin' me
hate Doyle to tell me what to do
Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us
That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her
He ain't no count
You don't seem like a daddy
You seem like a brother
(pause) Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you
don't reckon  know
And then some people you don't like right off
It's funny
(pause) You know why  want you to play ball with me
Naw
'Cause it's fun
It don't matter if you ain't no good
It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it
When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when threw a ball or ran with it
Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with
had one there for little bit
Hit didn't get old enough to play with
Why not
It died
Yeah
Why
Hit was borned a little too early on
My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n
was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with
So it died when it come out
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it
went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it
Hit was bloody-like around that towel
Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel
It was alive
Yes sir
Right then it was
boy or girl
little ol' boy
You threw it in a trash barrel
didn't feel right about doin' that
takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there
That seemed more proper to me,  reckon
It was still alive when you buried it
heared it cryin' a little through that box
That don't seem right
It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother
wadn't but six or eight
reckon didn't know what to do
didn't know how to care for no baby
Mama and Daddy didn't want him
They learned me to do what they told me to
These days  figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow
That makes me feel real sad
Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl
would have
wish  would of had him
He'd be here right now
Livin'
Hits been hard thinkin' about it
They ain't a day goes by  don't think about it
kindly have a picture of it up in my head that see
Hit makes me sad, too
have bad thoughts on it
wished they was somethin'  could of did, too
Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern
All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way  see it shouldn't of told you about that boy ort not hear about such things
It just kindly come out
didn't mean to say anything bad about you
know you're good
You didn't mean no harm
(pause) Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did
've studied about it
The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades
Some folks calls it Hell, call it Hades
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too
Yes sir,  reckon it does
- Frank, flowers in hand, and Karl approach a very nice two story house
They get to the door and Frank rings the doorbell
always get nervous when  hear that doorbell
'm okay just walkin' over, but somethin' about that dang doorbell
They have one room where you can't walk on the carpet or sit on the furniture don't see much sense in havin' it
The door opens and we see an older black lady, the (eyes Karl) Son,  don't know why you keep comin' over here
You know these folks don't want you here
They run you off ever' time
Don't keep doin' this to yourself
You a sweet boy
Now go give them flowers to somebody that'll enjoy 'em
Ma'am,  really want to give them to Karen
(to Karl) You his daddy
No ma'am
Well, whoever you are, you ought to talk some sense into him
That little old girl is way too fast for him and don't wanna see him no way
Will you get her for me
Please really want to see her
She'll want to see me, too, 'cause we're not in public
Just don't tell her folks 'm here
(sighs) Okay
She disappears and a moment later  appears
She's thirteen, pretty and very neatly dressed
(put out) Hey Frank
You shouldn't be coming over here
My parents really don't want you to
wanted to bring you some flowers
They're pretty good ones
They're from the Dollar Store
'm not an idiot
Besides we have a garden full of flowers
She eyes Karl
wanted for you to meet Karl, too
He's my new friend
But  feel like 've always known him
thought you should meet him
Why
Hi, Karl
He's gonna be around a lot and hope you are too, so
Here give me the flowers, 'll do something with them
Thank you
Now you better go
Maybe 'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something
have a boyfriend now you know
And we're pretty serious
He gave me a ring
She proudly displays the ring
Can you go there with us now
Me and Karl
We could just hang out
Karl has some cool books
Frank,  just like you as a friend
Only at the secret place
Okay can't go there now
'll see you later
But maybe just for awhile -- 'm closing the door now
told you, 'll see you later
She closes the door
They stand therefor a moment, then walk away down the sidewalk
She said she'd see me later
That's kinda good, right
reckon
- Frank and Karl walk up the steps to the house
Frank opens the door and they enter
- As Frank and Karl enter, they see Doyle sitting on a footstool facing Linda who's in a chair
Doyle is holding both her hands and talking very softly to her
He sees the guys and looks up
Well, 'll be damned, there's the boys
'm glad y'all came in wanted to talk to y'all, too
was just tellin' Linda here -- Oh hell, 'll just start over, set down you boys
They do, on the couch
(') Well, what it is is,  just, well took off work early today and your mama was good enough to do the same so we could talk
guess you'd say 'm really here to apologize, which ain't easy for me to do, about the way  acted the other night
was just drunk and kinda got a little too worked up and one thing led to another
care about y'all a lot, do
don't mean to be so damned, assholish  guess the word would be
Now Karl,  don't believe  hit you, did
So no apology needed there  guess, but Frank, 'm sorry
'm sorry  hit your mama
'm just jealous of her
don't like her life or the way she runs it
don't like homosexuals and she buddies with one
don't like little wimpy ass kids or fuckin' mental retards and she's got one of each livin' with her
(laughs) was just kiddin'
But really guess people need to get along even if they have differences
(pause) You see,  work construction build things
Do you realize how important that is to the world have a lot of pressure on me
The upshot is, 'm gonna spend a lot more time over here and we're gonna get along
Like a family should
(to Linda) may even surprise you one day and pop the question
(he gets up) Well, 'm goin' back to work just wanted to give y'all some little piece of happiness today
(kisses Linda) See you tonight honey
Karl
Be a good boy, Frank
He leaves
Well, at least he's tryin'
But who knows for how long
He's lyin' Mama
He ain't gonna do better
know honey
Just remember what said, we'll bide our time
You just steer clear of him as much as you can
Doyle's had a real hard life
It's just about run him crazy think
We've had a real hard life, too, Mama
Linda moves to the couch and puts her arms around Frank
You're a hell of a boy, Frank
Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve
And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight
What do you think about that
could shore use some
Thank ye
- Karl is cleaning some parts in a bucket of gasoline
Bill comes to the door
Hey there Karl, can you come unload a generator for me
Karl wipes his hands on a shop towel and starts outside
- and a   stand by a pickup truck
small generator is on the tailgate
Karl, lift this thing down and carry it to the back
It's on the blink
(to man as Karl unloads it) We'll have it for you in a day or two, Walter
'ont us to he'p you there liftin' that
Oh no, that dang Karl can lift a bulldozier
Fix anything, too
(confidentially) He's mentally retarded, but he's a whiz on small engines
Lord works in mysterious ways
Karl carries the generator toward the shop
He turns and watches the man and boy talking and laughing with Bill
The man playfully puts an arm around his son's neck and tousles his hair
Hell, he didn't just make the team, Coach says he's probably gonna start at end on defense
He's a chip off the old block
Ain't you, Steve
guess so
Karl turns and goes in the shop
- Karl is on his cot reading a book
Frank comes in
He looks very depressed
He sits beside Karl
What you readin'
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry
aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times
've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot
These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far
(he looks directly at Frank, which he seldom does) You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might
You got somethin' wrong with ye
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in
Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good
We ain't ever gonna be happy
We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl
don't reckon  know
ain't found no way yet and 'm three or four times as old as you
Might be that's just the way folks is
feel sad about Karen Cross, too
just make like to myself she loves me
know better, though
It just feels good to me when imagine it
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time
They sit in silence for a moment
(') Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early
Is that right
'll play ball with ye
reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference
You will
For sure
Yeah
We'll be on teams, me and you
Yessir
- It's the practice field, so it's not very well kept
Karl, Frank, and two other boys around Frank's age are huddled up
Four boys are lined on defense
They break the huddle and come to the line
They are on about the fifty-yard line
Frank hikes the ball to one of the boys
He later als it to Karl who stands there for a minute as the defenders run toward him
Then he takes off like the wind
He runs funny, kind of humped over and pigeon-toed, but fast
All the others are chasing him
Two of the other team's boys catch him on about the fifteen-yard line, but he drags them along
Karl sees Frank out of the corner of his eye and tosses him the ball just as Karl bites the dirt
Frank goes into the end zone untouched
There are cheers from Frank and the other boys
Frank runs over to Karl who's still on the ground
Way to go, Karl
We got a touchdown
That was a good lateral, man
That was just like the Wishbone
dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so figured  better give it off to you
seen you over there follerin' me
We're liable to win if we keep this up
For somebody like you, you sure run fast
He grabs Karl by the hands and helps pull him up
(') Come on, let's kick off to 'em
- Karl and Frank, dirt, grass stains and all, walk toward home
know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard
You're strong though
You let me make them touchdowns so 'd feel good
My daddy used to do that kind of thing
They walk in silence for a moment
(') It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you
No sir
It was fun, anyhow
wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me 'd do
Can we play ever' Saturday
If  ain't too stove up
ain't like you
'm old and give out
(pause) 'm proud of ye
- Karl sits on his bed rubbing his hands together, deep in thought
- Karl is walking down the street past rundown houses
He comes to an old gray woodframe house
It is in bad repair, the paint is peeling, the yard is grown up
There is an old wooden shed in the back yard
He stands looking at it for a moment then walks through the yard and opens the door to the shed
He's motionless for a moment, then goes inside
- Sunlight comes through the cracks in the wood
The shed has nothing but dirt for a floor
few tall patches of grass shoot up between boxes and rusty lawnmowers
few old garden tools hang on the wall
In the center is a low circular spot in the ground and a few tattered shreds of an old quilt
Karl stands looking at the hole for a moment, then turns and walks out of the shed
- Karl walks across the yard to the house
-  - Karl goes onto the screened-in porch, looks through the kitchen window and goes inside
- The place is a mess
Dirty dishes are piled in the sink and on the table
It's not just clutter, but filth everywhere
- Karl walks into an equally filthy living room where an in overalls sits slumped in a chair looking at his lap
Karl stands facing him for several moments
'm ye boy
ain't got no boy
'm ye oldest boy name Karl
ain't got no boy
They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital
Said  was well
No response
(') got hired to work for a Mr
Cox fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot
No response
(') That grass out in the yard's all growed up
figured  might cut it fer ye
told you,  ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be
Long silence
learned to read some
've read on the Bible quite a bit
don't understand all of it, but  believe understand a good deal of it
Them stories Mama and you told me ain't in there
You ort not to of done that to ye boy
(pause) 've studied on killin' you
But don't reckon they's no reason fer it if all you're gonna do is set there in that chair
You'll be dead soon enough  reckon and the world'll be shut of ye
(Karl walks toward the kitchen and turns back to the old man) You ort not to of killed my brother
He ort to have had a chance to grow up
Sometimes he would of had fun
Karl walks out of the house and across the yard to a hedge in the corner and kneels down
He pushes some grass aside to reveal a rock about afoot tall and afoot across
In front of it, the ground is raised a little
He stares at the rock for a moment and touches it
Little feller
- Karl stands on the side of the bridge looking into the river below
- All the lights are out
We see a shot of Frank in his bed asleep, but tossing and turning
Then a shot of Linda in bed staring at the ceiling and Doyle beside her snoring
Suddenly, the lights come on and Linda lets out a little yelp and sits up, which wakes up Doyle and he sits up with a start
From their
we see Karl standing in the door holding a hammer
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'
It's the middle of the night
What do you want, hun
want to be baptized
Baptized
Well, get baptized then
don't give a shit
Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit
can't baptize you
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday
You go on back to bed
What are you doin' with that damn hammer
don't rightly know
just kindly woke up a-holdin' it
- We see a shot of Frank and Linda and Vaughan in a church pew
The church is pretty full
From their
we seek Karl in a robe standing in the baptismal tank
The preacher takes Karl and dunks him under the water and brings him back up
- Doyle is in his favorite chair as Linda, Frank, and Karl come through the front door
How'd your baptizin' go
It went real good
Well, that's good
It's about time to eat and you know what 'm cravin'
Some of that take out chicken
Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch
(to Frank and Karl) Would y'all like that
Yeah,  guess
Yes ma'am
like a fried chicken leg
All right, y'all gonna go with me
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things
There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch
You go on
'll be back in a little bit then
She leaves and Doyle walks up to Karl and Frank
really just wanted to git your mama out of the house for a minute so we can have a talk
'all set down
They sit on the couch and Doyle kneels in front of them
Now here's the deal
Now that 'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what  want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight
See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you
We'd never have a bad word between us
But since you do exist, if 'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules
And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to
Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does
You're a weird little shit don't get you
So wake up
Face what they call reality
We're gonna be a family now
And it's my family
'll be payin' the bills so you got me
But  ain't your daddy
You just treat me like  am
'm the boss, okay
And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go
We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit
See
Karl can stay if he wants to
Mama said -- Doyle slaps him across the face and Karl grabs Doyle's arm
Doyle shakes him off
Don't hit that boy no more
You shut up you, fuckin' retard
Get your shit and get out of here
(to Frank) That was a wake-up slap, Frank
Remember
Reality, like  said
Don't forget any bit of what  said to you and we'll be fine
Frank jumps up and runs from the house and Doyle sits back in his chair and pops a beer
Karl gets up and goes to the garage
- Karl ties his books up with his strap and gets a bag from his bed and leaves
- Karl is walking away as Linda pulls up in her car and gets out with fast-food bags
Where are you goin', Karl
Didn't you want some chicken and things
No ma'am
'm a'goin' off sommers
Well, okay
got you some
Frank, he went off, too
He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors
Where'd he go
What's goin' on
He wanted to go off and play, reckon
(pause) You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner
You don't have to worry yourself none
All right then
Well, 'll see you later
If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home
don't get to see him all day except Sundays
He can play tomorrow
Ma'am
Yeah
You're a good mama to that boy
You care for him
You work hard fer him to take care of him
You light him up in his eyes, 've seen it
He wouldn't know what to do without ye
Well thank you, hun
That's real good of you to say
wouldn't know what to do without him either
You've been real good to me, too
It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night
You and that boy has give me a good feelin'
We sure like havin' you
Thank ye
(Karl walks away, then turns) 'm just getting around to tellin' you, but  fixed your warshin' machine
- Frank is on the ground digging a trench in the dirt with a stick
He hears footsteps in the leaves and looks up and sees Karl coming toward him
Hey, Karl
How'd you know to come out here
knowed you'd be here
(Karl sits on the stump) What are you a-doin' digging with that stob
Just diggin'
(pause) ain't ever gonna be happy now
Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good
wish me and you and Mama could just run away
But she said he would find us wherever we went
He's crazy
Sometimes  think it would of been better if  wadn't ever born
'm glad of it you was borned
(pause) reckon  ain't gonna be there in the garage no more
You have to Karl
You have to look out for me
You don't let that son of a bitch run you off
You're just a boy
You ort not to use that sort of language
Karl,  ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away
You're older than him
You're strong, too
My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me
He'd just whup the tar out of me
Yeah,  guess so
'm real tired, you know that
kid my age shouldn't be tired of things
'm tired, too, Frank
(pause) If  ain't around no more, it don't mean  don't care fer ye
care for ye a good deal
care for you more than anybody they is
We made friends right off the bat
care for you, too
But you'll be around, don't say that
Hit don't make no difference where was to be
We'll always be friends
There ain't no way to stop that
(pause) aim for you to have these books
He hands him the books
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than  can
made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas
You don't want to give away all your books
aim fer you to have 'em
Man
Thanks
(pause) You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why
Yes sir
've got a feelin' today
Reckon what kind of a feelin'
Like something different
don't know
(pause) You're leavin' ain't you, Karl
Will ye do somethin' for me if ast you to
You know  would
Whatever you want
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle
He's got it in for ye tonight
got me a feelin', too
Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean
Ye mama neither
When you get up from here, want you to go to that feller's house
Your mama's friend
want you to give me your word on it
Okay
give you my word
Is ever'thing gonna be okay
Are you all right
Ever'thing's okay, boy
kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then 'm gonna go on and leave here
Okay
Karl lays his arm on Frank's shoulder and Frank puts his hand on Karl's arm
They sit like that for a few moments, then Karl gets up with his paper sack and walks away
Frank takes the book marker out of the Christmas book
It is just a folded piece of notebook paper
On it is written 'You will be happy
' He looks up at Karl who is now thirty yards away in the trees
(') Karl
Karl turns around and he and Frank stare at each other through the trees
'  - Karl knocks on the door
After a moment, Vaughan answers in a pair of big shorts and a sweatshirt
Karl, what are you doing here
Come in
ain't a-stayin'
need to ast you fer a favor
Okay
This evenin'  want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight
What's wrong
Is everything okay
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks
Will you give me your word you'll do it
Well, sure, okay
He hasn't hurt them, has he
Naw, not yet
(hands the bag to Vaughan) want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley
Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out
Hits what 've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox
Vaughan takes the bag
What about you, Karl
Do you want to stay here
don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy
(pause) You've been real square dealin' with me
The Bible says two men ort not lay together
But 'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades
Some folks calls it Hell,  call it Hades
(Karl starts away) That boy lives inside of his own heart
Hits an awful big place
You take care of that boy
Vaughan watches Karl walk away
- Karl stares at the bus station door
- Karl stares at the house from the sidewalk
- Karl stares into the river
'  - Karl has a lawnmower blade sharpening it on a grinding wheel
- Karl carrying the blade walks onto the porch and enters the living room
- Doyle is in his chair drinking beer and watching
He looks up as Karl comes around and sits on the sofa
Where's ever'body else
You seen 'em
(no response) thought  told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police
(') Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em,  guess
What numbers do you punch
told you to get away from here, didn't
'm tryin' to relax and look at
(notices blade) What are you doin' with that piece of iron
swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch  ever heard of
aim to kill you with it
Doyle keeps drinking and watching
Yeah, okay
Well, to get the police you push 911
You'll need to tell 'em to send an ambulance, too
Or a hearse
You fuckin' idiot
You're gonna kill me
(laughs) Karl gets up and walks slowly toward Doyle out of frame
We see the flickering light of the  on the wall
we hear one short dull thud
(
) Oh God
Oh God
We hear one more thud, then the sound of Doyle's body hitting the floor
Karl appears in frame again and we follow him to the kitchen where he picks up the wall phone
He stares at it for a moment, then pushes 911
He has a few specks of blood on his face, hand and shirt
(into phone) Yes ma'am
need the police over here at the Wheatley house
(pause) 've killed somebody with a mower blade
(pause) Yes ma'am, 'm right sure of it hit him two good whacks
That second time just plumb near cut his head in two
(pause) Hits a little old yeller house right on the corner of Marigold Street and some other street
They's a red pickup truck out front says on it
'll be a settin' here waitin' on ye
Beside sendin' the police, Doyle said you might want to send a ambulance or a hearse
Thank ye
He hangs up and goes to the refrigerator and takes out a jar of mustard
He gets a knife out of the drawer and sits at the kitchen table and pulls back a table cloth that is covering up some leftovers
He picks up a biscuit and opens the mustard jar and runs the knife around it
There's hardly any mustard in it
He dabs a little on the biscuit and takes a bite and relaxes to wait for the law
: He's in the middle of one of his sick monologues
We pull back and see we're in the recreation room of the hospital again with Karl in his usual chair listening to Charles
Karl is now wearing the hospital issue clothing
on the third day  washed her
She wasn't very clean
got all the right spots
She was the first one  ever kept for any length of time, you see  get bored easily, have a short attention span can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum don't really like people who talk a lot
like to do the talking guess that's why 'm so fond of you
You're so easygoing, although do sense a little tension in you sometimes
By the way, how was it out there
Did you have any fun
Make any new acquaintances
Tell me what it was like
They was a boy
We made friends
bet you did
was never bent that way
'm bent the other way
So, you liked it out there in the world
It's too big
Well, it's not too big in here, is it
(pause) feel very generous today
feel like listening
'm sure you have plenty to tell me
And please bore me with the details
(long pause) ) Come on Karl, who did you kill
Was it the boy
Don't say nothin' about that boy
Karl looks him right in the eye for the first time ever
Fact the bidness, don't you say another word to me
ain't listenin' to you no more
Karl gets up and goes to the window and looks out at the grass that separates him from the next building
