Uh
Do you think he was powerless in the grip of circumstances
or could he have helped himself
don't
Uh
Powerless

' , '                   43 Beth goes upstairs with her shopping, knocks on Conrad's door
No answer
She enters in an authoritarian way, then comes out and closes the door
She then goes to the next door on the landing (Buck's bedroom), stops in front of it
She hesitates, then enters
44
' , '                      44 Beth slowly enters Buck's abandoned bedroom, all silent
Everything has stayed like it was
Beth looks around, sits on bed
Stares at photos, prizes and objects
It's like a museum

Beth stares, trying to remember
Wait a minute
Did  take trig
That's

They're on your bed
Beth enters parents' bedroom and closes the door
Conrad just stands there, paralyzed

48 Beth and Calvin are going to the Murray's birthday party, Calvin is driving
Who's gonna be there
Well
The Murrays of course, and the Gunthers, and the Caines, and
the good old us
Why don't we just go to the movies instead
Don't be negative
That's not negative
That's unpredictable
Come on
Let's really go to the movies
Okay
Calvin smiles, thinking she agrees, not understanding she is taking this as a joke
Really
() 34
48   :                                                   48 Okay

Hello Gladyce
Will you put that with the rest of them
Several guests
Beth sees Mrs Murray coming down the stairs eyes wide open, showing off
(cont'd) Oh, look, we're in time for the grand entrance
Hello
Look who's here
Three blocks away and the last to arrive
They kiss
(cont'd) Come on in
While going to the dining room, they meet their host, Clark Murray a thin blond man
Clark
Happy birthday
You look wonderful for a 75-year-old

50   :                                                  50 Yes
It is
Do you like it
You did the mousse
It turned out well
Hey
Partner
How are you
Calvin meets his business associate Ray Hanley, and Man #2 (red tie striped cream, wearing glasses), and their wives
Hey, pal
Calvin kisses Ray's wife
Beth is with two women : Woman #1 with dark hair (in green), the other, Woman #2, with grey hair (in orange)
Hi there
#1 Hi
Beth
Good to see you, and where were you at the lunch last week
Man #3 is giving Clark Murray some financial advice #3 Call your bank and borrow the money
was thinking of going public
#3 wouldn't do that,       wouldn't do it now
Why not
#3 because the market's low
Beth is talking to Woman #2 (with grey hair, orange dress) Your hair looks wonderful
It's shorter, isn't it
like that
Man #2   is telling a joke to two women () 36
50   :                                                  50 #2 said: "Would you please put out your cigar
" and he says: "Huh
" said: "Would you put out your cigar
", he says: "Huh
"
said: "Would you please put out your cigar
", he says: "  don't have another one
" The two women laugh
Good to see you
You look beautiful
As ever
#4 (full grey hair) It's a macho factor
When these kids are at school, they just think they've got to walk on the edge of danger
Beth joins the two women and man #2 : What are these hushed tones all about
# He just told the funniest joke
Calvin laughs with two male guests
#4 (with grey hair) passes him #4 'm not talking to you
Why
Woman #2 with grey hair (in orange) is sitting on a couch talking to other guests #2 Obviously, you know,  have my fingers crossed on this merger
Man #3 and Clark Murray are still talking financial advice
When can we have lunch
#3 Great
Fill me in the office, have no idea of my schedule, but 'm free almost everyday

Bob Mc Lean's leaving Coles and Johnson
Where is he going
#2 He doesn't know
Jesus
Beth is laughing, adressing  #4 (with grey hair) No
You didn't
You're so mean
Isn't he the meanest man you've met
guest, Man #5,      talks golf with a woman
#5 When a ball is in play, if a player, his partner, their equipment or their caddies accidentally move it
Birthday cake comes in with candles () He's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow Won't regret, can't forget What we did for love Beth and other women and gathered around the piano
They are a little drunk are singing a little false
Annie, a guest with red blouse, is sitting on the steps of the stairs, eating out of her plate
Calvin comes and sits next to her
Hi
Annie
What's your boy up to these days
Oh
Who knows
They won't tell
How's Conrad doing
He's great
Just great
() 38
50   :                                                  50 asked Donald, and he says they haven't talked much
said maybe he's a little self-conscious
woman in green going upstairs, drunk, trips over Calvin Oh
Calvin laughs
The woman goes upstairs
(cont'd) No, no
No
No
He's
Beth, not far, listens
(cont'd) There's a doctor in Highland Park
that he sees a couple of times a week
That kinda cuts into his social life
Beth, still
(cont'd) He's great
Just great
Really
Is he still having some problems
Oh, no, no
Nothing like that
No, no, just somebody to talk to
that's all
Kind of polish off the rough edges, that's all
Beth joins in, to cut him off
How are you
Darling
Is he falling asleep on you, yet
Nah
He's great
(Mimicking "Mr
Wonderful") Mr
Great
That's me

51 Beth looks uptight and scornful
Calvin notices it
() 39
51   :                                                 51 Hey
You drink too much at parties, Calvin
'm not drunk
Why did you tell Annie Marshall that Conrad is seeing a psychiatrist
dunno
Why not
Well for one thing,  don't think people hear that kind of thing very easily
Come on, for most people, it's a status symbol, right up there with going to Europe
Well,  thought your blurting it out like that was in very bad taste
did not think it was that
Not to mention a violation of privacy
Whose privacy
Beth is strangely vehement
Our privacy
The family's privacy
think it is a very private matter
Calvin sighs
Dr
' Conrad sits in an armchair, very nervous, scratching his leg
() 40
51   :                                                 51 So what do  do
tell you my dreams
don't hold much stock in dreams
What kind of a psychiatrist are you
They all believe in dreams
Really
What's happening
What's going on
just feel
feel so
What
Jumpy
don't know
Look
Kiddo
lied
do believe in dreams
Only sometimes want to know what's happening when you're awake
Come on, something's bugging you, making you nervous
You're making me nervous
Maybe  need a tranquilizer
Tranquilizer
Yeah
What do you think
think you came in here looking like something out of The Body Snatchers
It's not my impression that you need a tranquilizer
Conrad notices a cube on the table
What is this
Clock
() 41
51   :                                                 51 Oh,  see
So you get to tell the time, but  can't
Is that it
Mmm, mmm
So you know when the hour's up
Right
Fifty minutes, fifty five minutes
What is it
Dr Berger doesn't answer
(cont'd) Maybe
Maybe  don't want to swim anymore
You know,  mean my timing is for shit
You know, he's got two guys that swim the fifty, they're better than me, and
Ha, ha
They're a bunch of boring ass jocks
Ha, ha
And him
can't stand him
He's a tight ass son of a bitch
Ah, ah
Have you ever thought about quitting
Are you telling me to
No
It wouldn't look good
Forget about how it looks
How does it feel
() 42
51   :                                                 51 How does it feel
How does it feel
Yes
How does it feel
Yes
How does it feel
It's the same thing that happened last year
It's the same damn thing  did last year
Are you the same person you were last year
don't know
That's why you need a tranquilizer
You tell me
No
It's up to you
Fifty bucks an hour, can't you decide if  should have a pill or not
mean, you're a doctor, 'm supposed to feel better
Right
Not necessarily
Conrad reflects
Dr  (cont'd) How is it with your friends
Is it getting any easier
No
It's still hard
Is anyplace easy
The hospital was
() 43
51   :                                                 51 It was
Why
Because nobody hid anything there
Was there anyone there you could talk to
Uh-huh
mean, besides Dr
Crawford
Uh-huh
52
52 Conrad is sitting, reflecting
young woman's hand blinds him for a second : Karen has arrived
Whoa
Hi
Hey, Karen
Hi
How are you
Good
Real good
Sit down
Please
Thank you
Wow
Long Pause
They laugh
When did you get back

Don't let me hang you up
No
Oh, no, you're not hanging me up
No,  really wanted to see you

(interrupting) No, no,  wasn't
It was just a gray day, that's all
Kind of
But everything's great, 'm back in school,  am on the swim team, and
Oh
You're swimming
Terrific, Conrad
That's
That's really wonderful
We haven't had any meets yet could end up on the bench all year, but
Come on, you'll do great
'll bet your folks are real proud of you
Yeah, yeah
What can  get you guys
You're hungry, at all
() 45
52   :                                                       52 Uh

You think we offended him
Something  said
Definitely a low self-image day
So
Uh

to
You really look beautiful
So do you
Do you miss it

Waiter brings two cokes (cont'd) Thank you
You don't miss it
At all
Nothing
Nothing about it
No
You don't miss Leo's corny jokes
() 46
52   :                                                  52 Pause
She looks at him sternly
Are you seeing a doctor
Yeah
'm seeing a doctor
Are you
Uh
Uh, well, Dr
Crawford gave me a name, and  went for a while
But uh
dunno
It just didn't work for me,  guess
He just kept telling me all the things  already knew, and , uh
finally, decided
the only one who can help me is myself
At least, that's what my dad says
don't mean it's not right for you, Conrad
mean  think that if it's something you want to do, that's what you should be doing
Well, ya,  don't know how long 'll keep it up
sorta got shoved into it
Pause Your hair grew in
Oh, yes
That was such a dumb thing to do
like it
You do
Yeah
don't know,  just
Uh
miss it sometimes, the hospital
Really do
Things have to change
You know
() 47
52   :                                                 52 But that's where we had the laughs
But that was a hospital
This is the real world
Yeah, yeah,

Pause really have to go
'm sorry have a meeting over at the school
Drama Club meeting
We're doing " Thousand Clowns"

Don't wanna be late
Thanks for seeing me
He clears his throat
Conrad
Let's have a great Christmas
Okay
Let's have
a great year
Let's have the best year of our whole lives,
We can, you know
This could be the best year ever
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
She gets up (cont'd) Mmm
Will you call me
() 48
52   :                                                    52 Yeah
You mean it
Yep
You
Uh
You look good
Conrad
Yeah
Bye
Bye-bye
She leaves
Then stops a few steps away, and shouts : Hey
customer is startled
(cont'd) Would you cheer up
Conrad sits there with a strange feeling of embarrassment, reflecting
53
'
53 From inside, Beth stares outside in the garden where Conrad is lying on a chaise lounge
She comes out
It's cold out here
You should put that on, or do you want a sweater
Do  need one
Beth is taken off guard by Conrad's reaction, doesn't know what to do
What are you doing
Nothing
Thinking
() 49
53   :                                                     53 About what
Not about anything
Your hair is starting to grow out
It's looking
looking better
Pause was thinking about the pigeon
You know the one that used to hang around the garage
How it used to get on top of your car, and he take off when you pulled out of the driveway
Oh
Yeah,  remember
remember how scared  used to get
That whosssshhhhh
Flap, flap, flap, flap
Every time  started the car
Yeah
That was the closest we ever came to having a pet
You remember Buck asked you, he tried to talk you into
getting a dog
Do you remember that
He said
"How about it, if it's the size of a little football
" You know
Uh
That animal next door, that Pepper or Pippin, whatever its name is
Pippin
Pippin
Pippin
He's not a very friendly dog
don't care what Mr
McGreary says
- What he really wanted was a      - Everytime time that dog retriever
It was down the         comes into this backyard, street for sale
That's what       try to get him out
he wanted
retriever
() 50
53   :                                                 53 (he barks) Arf
Arf
Arf
Beth stops in her tracks, startled, but doesn't show it
Put that on if you're gonna stay out here, okay
Conrad stays alone a while and stares
Then goes inside
54
'
54 Conrad enters hesitantly, back from garden
Beth is busy dressing up the table
Can  help
Help what
Oh, you mean with this
No
will
(casually) No,  tell you what you can do though
You can go upstairs to that room of yours and clean out the closet
Mom
Okay
Because it really is a mess
They stand there, facing each other, uptight
The telephone rings
Beth goes over to it, picks it up, seems suddenly delighted
(cont'd) Hello
/
/ Oh, hi
/
/ Yeah, , no,  didn't get there was swamped with work
How did it go
/
/ No, no, 'm not doing anything, just getting ready for dinner
Uh-huh
Beth laughs to a gossip
Conrad is devastated
() 51
54   :                                                 54 (cont'd) Did she really
Beth laughs again
[echo effect to get into Flashback] 55
' ,                              55 Beth is laughing at Buck story
She is lying leisurely on a mattress on the lawn
Buck is standing, telling his story
Oh anyway, Mary Ann Ramon started to just scream, just cry, right
It was crazy
We got so drunk that we couldn't talk to each other
It was the last day
the last day of school
younger Conrad, sitting aside, is listening too, amused
(cont'd) We walked out of the building in the middle of the class
Conrad laughs
Beth laughs
Oh, Bucky
Beth laughs
56
' ,   -                       56 Beth laughs
Conrad stares at Beth laughing on the phone
The gossip gets too funny
No
Stop
Beth laughs
Dr
' What do you expect from her
We just don't connect
Why not
don't know
We just don't
() 52
56   :                                                56 Silence What are you thinking
That  jack off a lot
So what else is new
Does it help
For a minute
Silence What now
John Boy
Who
You know, in "The Waltons"
John Boy
Yeah
What about him
My father came into my room and he didn't know what to say
This is right after Buck died
And he came over and sat on the bed next to me, put his arm around my shoulder
We just sat there
remember  was watching his shoe
And thinking
Cos his shoe was turned over on its side
was thinking: "He's so uptight, it's gonna crack off
" Dr Berger listens carefully
(cont'd) And  knew  should have felt something
But  didn't know what to feel
kept thinking what they say on , you know, stuff like: () () 53
56   :                                                 56 (cont'd) "Oh, no, noo
Ooh, My god
" But  didn't say that
because didn't feel sad
so much as
Conrad sighs
So much as what
dunno
kept thinking that John Boy would've said something
about the way he felt, you know
Something
What would John Boy have said
don't know
Come on
Conrad seems lost
Dr Berger is on to something
Dr  (cont'd) Come on
Come on what
Don't hold back
Silence 57
57 Calvin walks with his business partner Ray Hanley (seen at the party)
Well
At least she's an improvement
She doesn't crack gum in your face
That's what you get when your partner does the hiring and firing
Oh, 'm sorry
That's my fault
just can never seem to tell anybody that they're not making it
() 54
57   :                                                 57 Hold, hold it
Wait a minute
That's not the problem
Where are you
What
've been losing you these days
Oh, 'm sorry
That's okay
That's okay
You off the track
Huh
They laugh
Come on
've known you for twenty years
You think  can't tell when something's wrong
How's Connie
Connie's all right
He is
He's okay
Look,  am sorry, it's none of my business, but  think you worry too much
You've been on the rack about him long enough
You're making it a habit
You've gotta let him go sometime
'm not on the rack about him
The thing about it is, in a year he'll be gone
Off to Michigan or Harvard or wherever in the hell he gets it in his head he wants to go
Maybe he'll decide to take a tour of Europe for a year and not even go to school at all
Who knows
can't argue with "Who knows
" () 55
57   :                                                   57 'm just try giving you the benefit of my experience
Thanks
With Valerie, it's more than her living away from home
She's gone
Got her own friends, her own life
She breezes in
for a couple of days on vacations, but
don't know, maybe girls are different
Or maybe she was too aware of what was happening between Nance and me
But they leave
And all that worrying doesn't amount to a hill of crap
It's just wasted energy
Calvin is troubled
58
58 Going home on the commuter, Calvin is thoughtful
He remembers his sons when they were kids
59
'   -                              59 Give me back my sweater
Come on, it's my sweater
Possession is nine tenths
Hang on
Dad, what's possession
Give it to me
can't, it's already on me
Wait, hang on
Whose sweater is it
It's my sweater
() 56
59   :                                                 59 Alright
'll give it back to you
as long as you give me back my hockey stick and my skis
All right
Calvin laughs That's fair
In the commuter train Calvin also remembers
60
'
60 Calvin knocks violently on Conrad's bedroom door Conrad
Conrad
What is it
61
'
61 Conrad is taken away on a stretcher into an ambulance
Watch your back
Cuts are vertical
He really meant business
on Beth, hand on mouth, astonished
Beth and Conrad have overheard
(cont'd) Let's go
62
62 Lake Forest is next
Lake Forest
Calvin realizes he has to get off
63
63 Another training session at the swimming pool
Conrad is heavily swimming in his lane, although he looks tired and bored, not really fit for training
He stops, exhausted at the end of a row, looks at his friends happily discussing by the side of the pool, then at coach Salan in his office glass booth overlooking the swimming pool
Conrad reflects
57
64
'           64 Coach Salan is sermonning Conrad in his office glass booth overlooking the swimming pool
What it is you want
don't know what else to do for you
'm not asking you for anything
You gotta be kidding me
don't get it
excuse you from practice twice a week so you can see some shrink
work with you every damn night at your convenience
What the hell more am  supposed to do for you

What happened
You all right

Dr Berger washes his hands in background room, then comes in
So, what did your dad say about it

He sweats everything so much, he'll just get worried about it
Can you tell your mother

66   :                                                 66 (cont'd) What do people have in common with mothers anyway
It's all surface junk

No
Sorry's out

No, no, never mind the time
There's time
Look
Remember the contract

Maybe there's some connection between control and uh
what do we call it
- lack of feeling
Mmm

When
Sometimes

Come on, come on, Jarrett, thought you didn't like to fool around

We follow the grandmother going to the kitchen to see what's happening
With her, we discover Beth kneeling, picking up a broken plate on the ground
Beth
think it can be saved
Beth gets up, goes to the table and starts preparing the sandwiches
(cont'd) That was dumb
It was just so dumb
don't think he's happy in school
Have you talked to his teachers
don't think people want to be with him
He provokes people
Well
/ Why don't you do this
/ It's an awkward age
Thank you
Maybe he needs a change
Are you sure he's eating enough
Yes, Mother, of course
think he'll be all right - if you're firm with him, mmm
think maybe he should go away to school
just don't know how to deal with him any more
Who would make that decision
() 67
68   :                                                 68 don't know

What sort of doctor
would make that decision for you
psychiatrist
thought we were all finished with that
No
What's his name
Berger
Jewish doctor
dunno,  suppose he's Jewish
Maybe just German
What does Cal say about all this
Beth shows her mother the two pieces of the plate and puts them together
You know,  think this can be saved

70 Jeannine in school corridor still singing
Mmm mm mmm, Mmm mm mmm, Mmm mmm Mmm mm mmm
Jeannine stops to drink some water at the tap of the fountain
Conrad see her when he is already too near, and has almost his coat on
Seeing an opportunity to talk to her, he steps back, takes off his coat while she is not looking, then passes her, putting on his coat as if he was naturally on his way out
Hi
Jeannine
Jeannine notices Conrad passing by
You are really a terrific tenor
Oh
In fact
You should be doing the solo in that Russian thing
Ha, no
No
'm serious
You really sing well
'm getting to know your voice
Yeah
Yeah
How can you hear me sing if you're singing
Well
don't always sing
Sometimes  just listen
Oh

70   :                                                 70 For instance, Marcia Blair can't sing a note

Oh, dear
Why do  ask dumb questions

Why is it so hard
the first time you talk to somebody
Conrad shrugs
Mmmm
You make it look easy
Jeannine is touched

71   :                                                   71 Really
Jeannine looks at him, then: (cont'd) Oh, that's my bus,  got to go
She runs and gets into the bus
Conrad follows and see her gets into the bus

'                                 73 Conrad enters his room still singing in a low voice
Alleluia
He browses quickly through a pocket book, finds the piece of paper inserted in it, picks up phone and dials the number written on the paper ' Hello
Hello
Is Karen there
' Who's calling, please
() 71
73   :                                                 73 It's a friend of hers from Hillsboro
' Oh

Oh
Um
Hmm
Just tell her called
This is Conrad
Calling
Just tell her  called and 'm feeling great, and  just wanted to talk to her
' Yes

Thank you
' Good bye
Conrad walks nervously around to and fro for a while then looks up into directory
He finds Jeannine number, writes it down "Pratt 5556719", then picks up the phone
All right Conrad hangs up, and rehearses what he is going to say, but he is yet too shy to call
(cont'd) Hello
Jeannine
This is Conrad
Hello
Jeannine, this is Conrad
Hello
Jeannine

() 72
73   :                                                 73 Hi
Listen
was
was wondering if maybe you'd like
to go out sometime
You mean, with you
Like on a date
Well, yeah, we wouldn't have to call it a real date
We could fake it sort of, to see how it goes
Jeannine laughs
That was dumb
Forget it
Just forget it
Now start over
Hi, this is Conrad Jarrett
(interrupting) ) 'd love to
When
Conrad laughs
74
'                              74 [Happy music] Calvin and Conrad happily come back home with a Christmas tree on top of car
75
'                               75 Christmas tree standing in living room ready to be decorated
Bet silently comes in
Calvin finally notices she is here
didn't see you there
What do you think
(cold) Fine
Rawlins used to have such great Scotch pines
And they all look like skeletons this year
Conrad comes in with a box of chritsmas tree decorations Hi
What do you think
() 73
75   :                                                 75 (cold) Very nice
Conrad and Calvin stop at the tone of her voice
What's wrong
(cold) Why don't you ask him what's wrong
Maybe you won't have to hear it from Carol Lazenby
Hear what
Dad,  quit the swim team
What
Carol thought  knew
Cos why wouldn't
It happened over a month ago
Quit
When
Where have you been every night
Nowhere
Around
The library mostly
Why didn't you tell us, Connie
don't know,  didn't think it mattered
What do you mean
Why wouldn't it matter
Of course it matters
And
(interrupting) No, that was meant for me, Calvin
What was meant for you
() 74
75   :                                                   75 It's really important to try to hurt me
Isn't it
Don't you have that backwards
Oh
And how do  hurt you
By embarrassing you in front of a friend
Poor Beth
She has no idea what her son is up to
He lies and she believes every word of it
didn't lie
You did
You lied everytime you came into this house at 6:30
If it's starting all over again, the lying, the covering up, the disappearing for hours,  will not stand for it
can't stand it
really can't
Well don't then
Go to Europe
Connie
Now, Connie
Connie
Cos the only reason she cares, the only reason she gives a fuck about it
Connie
is because someone else knew about it first
Just stop it, Connie
No
You tell her to stop it
You never tell her a godamn thing
And  know why she never came to the hospital, she's busy going to goddamn Spain and
goddamn Portugal
Why should she care if 'm hung up by the balls out there
() 75
75   :                                                 75 Maybe this is how they sit around and talk at the hospital, but we're not at the hospital now
You never came to the hospital
How   do you know she never came
You   know she came but she had the flu   and couldn't come inside, but she   came
Yeah
She wouldn't have had any flu if Buck was in the hospital
She would have come if Buck was in the hospital
Buck never would've been in the hospital
Conrad takes his head between his hands and runs upstairs
That's enough
That is enough
won't do it again
really won't do it
What in hell has happened
Upstairs, Conrad's bedroom door slams
(cont'd) Somebody better go up there
Ah
Oh, god, that's the pattern, isn't it
He walks all over us and then you go up and apologize to him
am not going to apologize
Yes of course you are
You always do
You've been apologizing to him ever since he got home from the hospital, only you don't see it
() 76
75   :                                                 75 am not apologizing
'm trying to goddamn understand him
Don't talk to me that way
Don't you talk to me the way he talks to you
Beth
Let's not fight
Okay
No fighting
Okay
Please
Let's go upstairs
Calvin goes, but Beth doesn't, and turns away
76
'                               76 Calvin enters Conrad's bedroom and closes the door
Conrad is lying on his stomach, feeling all crooked
His voice is muffled by his head between his arms
want to talk to you
need to sleep
In a minute
didn't mean it
didn't mean any of it
am sorry
Please don't be mad
'm not mad
'm just trying to figure out what happened down there
don't know what happened
am sorry about it all
am sorry about the whole thing
What said,  didn't mean it
Just please tell her
Tell her 'm sorry, will you
Why don't you tell her
Oh, God, no,  can't
Don't you see
can't talk to her
() 77
76   :                                                   76 Why not
Ha
Because it doesn't change anything
It doesn't change the way she looks at me
She was upset, Conrad
Your mother was hurt because you quit the swim team
don't understand it myself
don't mean just now
Don't you see
don't mean just today
What then
Explain it to me
Ha
can't
Everything is German pudding with you , dad
You don't see things
What things
Conrad sighs
(cont'd) What things
Please,  want you to tell me
That she hates me
Can't you see that
Your mother doesn't hate you, Conrad
All right, all right
You're right
She doesn't
Please leave me alone, now
Silence
Then Calvin stands up and goes to the door
What about this Dr
Berger
Do you think he's helping you
Don't blame it on Burger, it's not his fault
() 78
76   :                                                 76 Calvin opens the door
'll be downstairs if you need me
Exit Calvin
Conrad remains lying on his back with his arm over his eyes
Dr
' Tuesday you felt great
You bought a Christmas tree, it was all hunky- dory
Okay
You're the doctor
Don't take refuge in one-liners like "You're the doctor"
Okay
Because that pisses me off
Okay
Okay
So everything was fine till you had the fight with your mother, then everything was lousy
Yeah, but  don't blame her mean, she's got
She's got her reasons
It's impossible after all the shit 've pulled
What shit have you pulled
Hey
Remember
'm talking proportion here
Now, what shit
Conrad sighs
(cont'd) Come on
You must be able to come up with at least one example
And don't give me " tried to kill myself", that's old turkey
What have you done lately
Lately
Uh, uh
() 79
76   :                                                  76 Hey, come on, if you
Listen, 'm never gonna be forgiven for that
Never
You know, you can't get it out, you know, all the blood in her towels, in her rug
Everything had to be pitched
Even the tiles in the bathroom had to be regrouted
Christ, she fired the godamn maid because she couldn't dust the living room right
If you think 'm gonna forgive
- that she's gonna forgive me
Conrad stops
Dr
Berger looks at Conrad to signal him he just said something: Conrad realizes he just made a Freudian slip, looks at him, What
Conrad stands up, reflects, looks outside window
think  just figured something out
What
Who it is who can't forgive who
Well a real problem
a real problem has a real solution
've heard this all before
Doesn't make it any less true
'm so tired
Yeah, well
that's a hell of a secret you've been keeping on yourself
So what do  do now
() 80
76   :                                                 76 Recognize her limitations
You mean, like she can't love me
Oh, kiddo, no
Like she can't love you enough
Like don't blame her for not loving you more than she's able
But she loves my father
know she loved my brother
It's me
Ha
Now we're back to the rotten kid routine
She can't love you because you're unlovable
Where does that leave your dad
How come he loves you
You're a rottenkid, doesn't he know that
That's different
He feels responsible
Besides, he loves everybody
Ho,  get it
The guy's got no taste
He loves you, but he's wrong
Look
maybe she just can't express it the way you'd like her to
Maybe she's just afraid to show you what she feels
What do you mean
mean there's someone besides your mother you've got to forgive
You mean me
Conrad is wondering
(cont'd) For trying to off myself
Don't you sit there and stare at me
What for
() 81
76   :                                                 76 Why don't you give yourself a break
Let yourself off the hook
What did  do
No answer
(cont'd) What did  do
We'll talk about it on Thursday
Come on
Time's up
What do you mean
You're gonna pull the plug
Come on
What did  do
Come on, Con
You know the rules
Rules
What rules
Can't  have a few minutes
You think about it
Just think about it
Silence Jesus
Conrad is out of breath
77
77 Calvin and Friend are jogging in sportswear
Calvin's friend explains a stock market deal he made
Say
After going to a new high, it falls to 112 1/4 and then rallies on good volume
shoot an order to buy 4000 at the market
If  get the 4000 shares at 113 3/4,  know something's wrong
() () 82
77   :                                                 77 (cont'd) But suppose the order to buy the 4000 shares  put in at the price of 113 3/4,  get 2000 at 114, 500 at 114 1/4, and the rest on the way up, so the last 500 shares  pay 115 1/2, then  know 'm right
'm going to peel off here
Friend leaves Calvin and runs toward his home
'll see you, Cal
See you later
Now Calvin is running through the park alone
Different voices are echoing off screen
() Suppose the order to buy 4000 at 113 3/4
() He walks all over us and you go up there and apologize to him
() 500 at 114
() It's all German pudding with you, dad, you don't see things
() You've been apologizing to him ever since he came home from the hospital
And you just don't see that
() Tell her to stop it
You never tell her a godamn thing
() Buck never would have been in the hospital
() 83
77   :                                                  77 () She hates me
Can't you see that
Calvin trips, and falls in dead leaves
He sits up, thoughtfull
() want to be clear
Dr
' Calvin laughs nervously, all smiles
() That's good
In the car,  was thinking: "be clear
"
suppose that's what psychiatry's about
Being precise and clear
And honest, of course
'll level with you
'm not a great believer in psychiatry
Okay
know what happens here is only between you and him, and
like that,  respect that
And
he's better,  can see that
am not trying to put you down,  just don't believe in psychiatry as a panacea for everybody
Neither do
Calvin laughs
wish  knew what the hell  was doing here
Well, you said you
thought you could shed some light on some things
What did you mean by that
() 84
77   :                                                   77 don't know actually, 'm not sure,  think  meant in terms of Conrad
You see,  knew something was wrong even before he tried to
to kill himself
But thought that
It's clear that he's very smart
He's been an "" student ever since he started school, and naturally  thought that
intelligent people could work out their own problems
But you still feel responsible
Yeah, sure  do
It's hard not to
It was luck
It was just luck that  happened to be there when he tried it
could have been at a meeting
We both could've been away
It was luck
You think of yourself as a lucky man, then
No
No
No
used to
used to think
that  was a lucky person
before
the "accident"
Mmm,  guess the whole of life is nothing but an accident, is it
What happens to you
should do with it
That sounds more like the philosophy of a drifter than a tax attorney
Yeah
Maybe, maybe  am drifting a little
can see myself,
and can see the two of them drifting away from me, and  just stand there watching
What would you want to do about that
Something
gotta do something about it

And you see them as on
opposite sides of this fence
Yeah
No
don't know
see her not being able to forgive him
For what
Oh,  don't know exactly
Being too much like her
People always think that she and Buck are
were were alike
But it's really she and Conrad
They were the only two that didn't cry at the funeral, you know
It's not easy for me to admit this but, uh
she didn't
His mother doesn't show him a great deal of affection
'm not trying to put her down in any way at all
She is a wonderful woman, huh
Did she give Buck much affection to Buck
Oh, god, yes, she loved Buck
Bucky got so much
think what she felt for him was special
You know, he was her first-born
That's not unusual, is it
And you
Me
loved Buck
What  mean is, your wife's affection
For me you mean
Yes

No
There's no problem with her for me
We've been
We've been married nearly twenty one years
Everybody loves Beth
But, huh
for Conrad, - it's been difficult
He didn't talk about that
We don't know what happens here
It doesn't come up guess that's what it is
It's private here
Isn't it
Mm-hmm
Very private

Why don't we

Calvin heavily comes out

Calvin heavily comes out of the car, and finally closes door
Buzzing stops
This will sound strange

What
know it'll seem trivial, but it's on my mind, or has been, and 'd just like to talk about it
Why
When  was getting dressed for Buck's funeral,  was
Calvin, what's the matter with you
Just let me get it off my chest,
What could getting dressed for Buck's funeral possibly have to do with anything right now
was wearing a blue shirt
And you said: - Wear a white shirt and the other shoes
It was nothing at the time
But it's always seemed to stay with me
And , for some reason, been thinking about it and it suddenly occured to me what difference did it make what  wore at Buck's funeral
Ha, ha
Beth retreats inside the house to the kitchen
Just hear me out, Beth
It won't hurt you to listen
won't listen to that
No one in their right mind would listen to that

Why do you want to remind me of it
Because 've always wondered, in some needling way, what it mattered what  wore
was crazy that day
We were going to our son's funeral
And you were worried about what wore on my feet
'm sure it sounds like nothing to you, but it sticks with me and  just wanted to
tell you about it
She comes to him and takes him into her arms
It's all right

79 Two stairways, one going down, one up, cross each other in the middle space of the mall
On the one going down is Beth, Caroll, Beth's friend, is on the other

He thinks it's a good idea
What does he know about me, about this family
've never even met him
Exactly
That's the point
Wouldn't it be easier if we all talked about it
In the open
About what
What are we gonna talk about
Don't try to change me, Calvin
don't want anymore changes in my life
For God's sake, hasn't enough happened
Let's just hold on to what we've got
Darling, that is what this is for
Maybe you'll get a surprise
don't want any surprises
know 'm not perfect
And if can't go around hugging everybody all the time the way you do, then 'm sorry
am not asking you to be perfect, you're missing the point
don't want to see any doctors or counselors
am me
This is my family
And if we have problems, then we will solve those problems in the privacy of our own home, not by running to some kind of specialist everytime something goes wrong
(interrupting) Are you folks ready to order
Huh, no
Could you give me a couple of minutes, please
Sure

Please, for his sake, don't indulge him
We need time together

Can't break the ball, can't break the floor, can't break anything in a bowling alley
And that's what like about bowling alleys
Can't even break the record
Jeannine giggles with laughing eyes

Hmm
What
Just "anyway", it's a conversation starter
Catchy
You like it
Mmm, mmm

Jeannine laughs, then: Do you think people are punished for the things they do
You mean by God
Yeah
Mmm,  don't believe in God
Not at all
No
Well, it's not a question of degree
Either you do or you don't

Did it hurt
No,  dunno,  don't remember really
You don't want to talk about it
Ah,  don't know
've never really talked about it
To doctors, but not to anyone else
You're the first who's asked
Why did you do it
Uh
don't know
It was like
falling into a hole
It was like falling into a hole, and it keeps getting bigger and bigger,
and you can't get out, and then,
all of a sudden, it's inside
and you're the hole, and you're trapped, and it's all over
Something like that

Because  got tired
Yeah
Well
Screw you, you jerk
Conrad breaks down and cries
It hurts to be mad at him, doesn't it
Yeah
He just wasn't careful
He just wouldn't care
He didn't see how a bad thing might happen
Bad things happen even when people are careful
We were screwing around out there, we should've come in when it started to look bad
, so you made a mistake
Why did he let go
Why

Did it ever occur to you that you might have been stronger
Conrad comes out of it and stares at him

That isn't it

Okay

Feelings are scary
And sometimes they're painful
And if you can't feel pain, then you're not gonna feel anything else either
You know what 'm saying

You're here and you're alive
And don't tell me you don't feel that
It doesn't feel good

You're really my friend

Conrad falls into Dr Berger's arms, crying

'                           150 Jeannine opens her curtains, sees Conrad, outside her home, walking to and fro
She puts on a jacket and comes out to him
Hi
was gonna call but  didn't want to wake anyone
Might have been easier
Listen,  want to say something about the other night
mean liked being with you but  didn't like myself
Conrad
was stupid
That was dumb of me to laugh and it was my fault
just didn't know what to do
was embarrassed
Really
You were embarrassed
Yes
When those boys came in, it was awful and awkward
That's what do when  get embarrassed laugh
But they were all right
They were just up and they were having a good time, and  let them get in the way of what was happening
It was dumb
It was dumb
've been doing lots of dumb things lately
just didn't know wether or not you were being straight with me

(cont'd) Yeah
Jeannine nods
(cont'd) Anyway, 'd like to try it again thought it worked out okay
Well, except for the bowling
Jeannine laughs, looks down, then looks up straight in his eyes
Yes
Yes
Jeannine nods
Yes
Conrad is moved
Uh
Are you going to school
No, not on Sunday
Conrad realizes
Laughs
(cont'd) Have you eaten
No

Do you want some breakfast
Conrad nods
She smiles at him
Okay

151 () Golf ball falls into hole
Oh
All right
How about that
Boy, oh, boy
Beth is beaming from her success at golf
Oh,  do love that
Oh, these holes sure do love you
Oh boy, oh boy
We should spend more time playing golf together, you know that
Maybe our next vacation, strictly golf
Pinehurst, Myrtle Beach
Pinehurst would be nice
think Connie would like Pinehurst
She pulls back and looks at him
Do you do that deliberately or is it just a reflex
Well, you said "vacation", so just assumed you meant him too
'm surprised you haven't felt the need to call him since we've been here
was gonna call him tonight
(to Ward and Audrey) Hey, could we have a little drink before we head back
() 118
151   :                                                 151 Drink, yes
Little, no

Cal, what'd you get
(to Ward) Six
(to Beth) Let's finish this
What
What you started
What  started
What you started
Ha
There's no point discussing it
think there is a point
He controls you even when you are two thousand miles away
He isn't the problem
Isn't he
No, he isn't
Let's talk about what's really bothering you
No, no
Let's talk about what's bothering you
Cos' that's what you want, isn't it
Jesus, what have  done to make you so angry with me

151   :                                                 151 It's not what you've done, it's what you think 've done
You blame me for the whole thing
Can't you see anything except in terms of how it affects you
No
can't
And neither can you, and neither can anybody else
Only maybe 'm just a little more honest about it
Well, stop being so godamn honest, and start being a little generous
And start thinking about him for a while
don't know what he expects from me
never have known
Well, 'll tell you what he expects
What
He wants me to throw my arms around him everytime he passes an exam
Well,  can't do it cannot respond when someone says: "Here,  just did this great thing
Love me
"
can't
All he wants
All he wants is to know you don't hate him
That's it
Hate him
My God
How could  hate him
Mothers don't hate their sons
Is that what he told you
Do you see how you accept what he says with no questions, and you can't do the same thing to me, can you
just try to keep this family together
() 120
151   :                                                   151 (she shouts) don't know what everyone wants from me anymore
Beth, nobody wants anything from you
Beth, listen
We all just want
Cal, Con, everybody, we just want you to be happy
Happy
Yes
Ward, you tell me the definition of happy, uh
But first, you better make sure that your kids are good and safe, that no one's fallen off a horse, or been hit by a car, or drowned in that swimming pool you're so proud of
And then you come to me and tell me how to be happy
She leaves
Calvin follows
Ward and his wife just stand there
152
152 Beth stares away from Calvin, as in a void
She sighs, closes her eyes; Calvin turns away from the window, looks at Beth and remembers
When they were happily dancing
[ to and fro twice] Calvin in his plane seat, reflects
153
153 Beth checks a pile of mail
Conrad comes in
think 'm gonna turn in
Dinner was good
Really good
It's pretty early
You tired
() 121
153   :                                                 153 Yeah
It was kind of a rough week
hope your grandmother wasn't too tough on you
No
She was fine
'm glad you're back
Conrad gives his mother a hug, but she is like made of stone
Calvin sees it
(cont'd) Good night
Beth remains transfixed as if she didn't know what it was all about
Calvin sees it
154
154 Beth is not sleeping, she looks up, sees her husband wrinkled pillow, but he is not in bed
She looks at the time, gets up, puts on a robe
155
155 Beth goes downstairs, tying up her robe
She stops, hearing someone sobbing in the dark, in the dining room
156
156 Beth enters the dining room in the dark
Calvin
Calvin is sitting at table in the dark, sobbing, his head in his hands
(cont'd) Why are you crying
Calvin doesn't answer
(cont'd) Can , uh
Can  get you something
Calvin mutters in a very low voice
don't
() 122
156   :                                                 156 What did you say
Calvin sits back in his chair
(cont'd) Calvin
What did you say
Calvin produces a very deep sigh
(cont'd) Tell me
Calvin looks up at her with a sad expression
You are beautiful
And you are unpredictable
But you're so cautious
You're determined, Beth
But you know something
You're not strong
And  don't know if you're really giving
Beth is looking at him not knowing what this is about
(cont'd) Tell me something
Do you love me
Do you really love me
feel the way 've always felt about you
Calvin is disappointed by the answer, but not surprised, just sad
We would've been all right, if there hadn't been any
mess
But you can't handle mess
You need everything neat and easy
don't know
Maybe you can't love anybody
It was so much Buck
And Buck died, it was as if you buried all your love with him, and  don't understand that
just don't know
Calvin sighs
(cont'd) Maybe it wasn't even Buck
Maybe it was just you
Maybe, finally, it was the best of you that you buried
() () 123
156   :                                                 156 (cont'd) But whatever it was,  don't know who you are
don't know what we've been playing at
So  was crying
Calvin is overcome by sadness (cont'd) 't know if  love you anymore
And don't know what  am going to do without that
Beth does not know what to say or do
She turns away and goes upstairs
157
157 Beth enters, kind of reflects, then goes open a closet, takes out some luggage
sudden burst of emotion overcomes her, she cries but does not seem to identify the emotion, then restrains it
158
'                                  158 In his bed Conrad is not sleeping
He hears the door of the house close, then someone walking outside on the gravel
He gets up, go look out of the window
Ouside, a taxi leaves
He goes downstairs
159
159 Conrad goes downstairs, curious
Looks around, sees nobody
160
160 From inside, Conrad finally sees his father in the garden, reflecting
Patches of snow
Conrad puts on his coat over his pyjamas, and joins him
Dad
The yard looks smaller without leaves
Dad
What happened
Your mother's going away for a while
Where
Why

160   :                                                 160 Back to Houston
Then
don't know
Why
What
know why
It's me
Isn't it
No
Yeah, it is
It's my fault
Don't do that
Don't do that to yourself
It's nobody's fault
Things happen in this world, people don't always have answers for them, you know
Calvin sits down
(cont'd) don't know why 'm yelling at you for
No, that's right
You're right
You ought to do that more often
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, Haul my ass a little, you know
Get after me
The way you used to for him
Oh, he needed it
You didn't
You were always so hard on yourself, never had the heart
Oh, Dad
Don't
No, it's the truth
never worried about you
just wasn't listening
Well,  wasn't putting out many signals then
don't think you could have done anything
() 125
160   :                                                  160 No, no, no,  should
should've got a handle on it somehow
You know,  used to figure you had a handle for everything
You knew it all
Calvin looks at him and laughs briefly at himself
(cont'd) know that wasn't fair but you always made us feel like everything was gonna be all right
thought about that a lot lately
really admire you for it
Calvin is moved
Well, don't admire people too much
They'll disappoint you sometimes
'm not disappointed
love you
Calvin looks at him, cries and takes him in his arms
love you too
They hug each other
