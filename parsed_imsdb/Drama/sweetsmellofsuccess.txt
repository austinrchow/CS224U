href <b>// --> </b> Sweet Smell of Sucess by Clifford Odets Ernest Lehman Working Script For : -  -
row of newspaper delivery trucks is lined up against the long loading bay, waiting for the edition
In the foreground a large clock establishes the time as 8:10
rumbling noise warns the men to take their positions; a few seconds later the bales of newspapers come sliding the spiral chutes onto the moving belts from which they are manhandled onto the trucks
Much noise and shouting
The front truck moves out to the city street
As it does the big poster on its side
The design features a large pair of spectacles with heavy rims - a trademark of Hunsecker's
(It will later be seen as the masthead of the gossip column
) "   " Read "They eyes of Broadway" -  -
The truck starts on its journey along Broadway
Some shots are of the vehicle moving through very heavy traffic (taken from a camera car)
Others are from the inside of the truck; as it slows down, the delivery man tosses the heavy bundle of papers onto the sidewalk
following the truck, holds it in foreground against the blazing electric signs of Broadway and Times Square
- The southeast corner of the intersection of Broadway and 46th Street, , fairly high, shoots north towards the impressive vista of electric signs, silhouetted against the darkening sky
Very heavy traffic and crowded sidewalks
descends towards the Orange Juice stand on the corner, passing the booth which sells souvenir hats
It moves through the congestion of chattering passersby, steadily approaching a smartly dressed young man, who stands at the counter of the Orange Juice stand
Oblivious of the hub-bub around him,   is concerned only with his private problems
He turns sharply as a newspaper truck pulls up at the curb behind him; this is what he has been waiting for
- The news truck delivery man tosses a bundle out onto the sidewalk besides a newsstand
The bundle of newspapers
It hits the sidewalk with a smack
as Sidney Falco crosses the sidewalk
The owner of the newsstand, , comes to pick up the bundle; he is a grizzled gnome with a philosophical sense of humor; Sidney snaps his fingers with impatience
Iggy wears spectacles and is clearly more or less blind, he has to grope for the cord that binds the papers
Aw Lady, if  looked like you, 'd-- 'mon
'mon
(recognizing Sidney's voice) Keep ya sweatshirt on, Sidney
Majestically taking his time, Iggy lifts the bundle to his stand and cuts the cord
Hey, Fresh, the Globe just came in -- Hey, Sidney, want an item for Hunsecker's column
Two rolls get fresh with a baker
Hey, hot, hot, hot -- etc
Annoyed, Sidney throws him a dime, seizes a paper and returns briskly to the orange juice stand
- Sidney's place at the crowded counter has been taken by newcomers
Rudely, he recovers his half-consumed glass of orange juice and sandwich
He takes them further down the counter to a quieter corner at which he can examine the paper
, picks up further snatches of overheard dialogue
(See dialogue attached at the end of the scene) We move close enough to see Sidney's hands open the paper expertly at ' column - identifiable by the picture of the spectacled eyes
Over scene there is a babble of offstage dialogue
His face is sullen as his eyes run rapidly down the column
He is reacting to a not unexpected disappointment
'  -  - on 46th Street, as Sidney comes down the side street from the newsstand in background
Irritably, he jerks open the door of a shabby entrance
As the glass door closes, Sidney is seen striding up the stairs
-  '  - Beside the top of the stairs is the door to Sidney's office
On it there is a cheaply printed cardboard sign which reads: Publicity From inside comes the sound of desultory typing
Sidney comes up the stairs two at a time and turns into the door
'  - is on the phone as Sidney strides in
Just a minute, Mr
Weldon think
Sidney vigorously indicates that he doesn't want to take the call
(to phone) 'm sorry
thought that was Mr
Falco returning
Yes, 'll tell him when he comes in
know he's been trying to reach you
She hangs up
That's the third time he's called today
He wants me to break a leg
(literally) No, an arm, he said
(then) told him you were sure the item would be in Mr
Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's
(interrupting, sharply) It isn't
've just seen the early edition
But
But what
That makes five days in a row that Mr
Hunsecker's cut you out of his column
May  rent you out as an adding machine
He has begun to change his clothes
Get me Joe Robard
Sally goes back into the outer room
Who else phoned
The renting agent and the tailor
Pay the rent
Let the tailor wait
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank
(to phone) Mr
Robard
Could you locate him
Sidney, in a state of semi-undress, comes to take the phone from her
(gloomily) Watch me run a fifty yard dash with my legs cut off
Very abruptly, he comes alive on the phone
real laughing boy
(effusively) Sidney, Joe
How do you like it
'm running out of alibis
No, asked Hunsecker to withhold the item, until he could give it a fine, fat paragraph
The column was running over and  didn't want you kissed off with just a line
'  - Robard is a stolid, secure man, balding and with a moustache
He has a morose sense of humor
He is speaking from a telephone on a little desk at the end of the bar
In background, the Club is open, but there are few customers as yet
Some recorded jazz is being played while the musicians are still arriving, strolling past in background, depositing their overcoats and music cases in the little closet assigned to them
(in answer to Sidney) Of course
(he listens to protest from Sidney) What is this, Sidney, a kissing game
You're a liar - that's a publicity man's nature
wouldn't hire you if you wasn't a liar pay you a -and-a-half a week wherein you plant big lies about me and the Club all over the map
(a pause) Yeah,  mean in that sense
But also in the sense that you are a personal liar, too, because you don't do the work  pay you for
(new protests on the other end of the line) Oh, stop it, Sidney
You're from the country, not me
Sally is watching him, unhappy on his behalf
(to phone) Now, wait a minute, Joe
When saw
last night he said
But Robard has cut off
Sidney hangs up
silence
Sally tries to be comforting
wish  could help in some way, Sidney
(aggressively) Help me with two minutes of silence
Sally, hurt, says nothing
Presently, he adds: Go home, Sally
It's late
hate to see you like this -- Sidney, with another mercurial change of manner, begins some sarcastic clowning
(horsing around) Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books
And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days -- (pleadingly) Sidney,  know you by now
Don't do a dance with me
(still clowning) You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world
(distressed) Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous
Sidney is abruptly savage
(with cruelty) So what'll you do if  feel nervous
You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms
(breaking down) Sid
you got me so
don't know what
She is crying
Sidney feels uncomfortable
Not too generously, he relents: You ought to be used to me by now
(pathetically) 'm used to you
(with a touch of bitterness) No
You think 'm a hero
'm no hero
'm nice to people where it pays me to be
gotta do it too much on the outside, so don't expect me to kow-tow in my own office
'm in a bind right now with Hunsecker so -- (grimly) Every dog has his day
(going) Lock up and leave the key
The phone rings
Sidney is dressed by now
As Sally goes for it, he makes for the outer door
If that's for me, tear it up
Take a top coat
And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town
He is already gone as she picks up the phone
Sidney Falco office
Oh, Miss Kay, he tried to reach you
No, he's at the barbers now
No, that's held over till the Tuesday column
: - The quintet
As the dissolve clears, a clatter of polite applause greets the end of a previous number
is on the bandstand, moving smoothly through the group of five musicians as the rhythm of a new number is set up: first the leader (a guitarist) snaps his fingers, giving the tempo to
the bass, who "walks" with the beat, bringing in
the drums, which start a quiet, insistent wire-brush background for
the cello and the flute, whose introductory phrases, set the stage for
the guitar, the leader again
It comes in after this short preamble with the first statement of melody
(The tune has a faint echo of significance because it is one of the themes of the film, already heard as a phrase in the background score of the title music
)  lingers a moment on the guitarist,
He is a youth of pleasant, intelligent appearance
He plays with the intent air of the contemporary jazz musician who takes his work very seriously indeed and affects a much greater interest in the music and his fellow musicians than in the listening audience
close shot
Sidney has just entered the club, strolling into the vestibule near the entrance
He wears an expression of oddly unsuitable antagonism, as he looks forward
Seen in long shot from Sidney's viewpoint
moves to include Sidney in foreground again
He turns as he is accosted by , the cigarette girl of the club
She is a pert creature, attractive and not unaware of the fact
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes
called you twice
(irked) 've been up to here
Listen, honey, tell me something
You know Susan Hunsecker
(Rita nods) Has she been in
mean lately, in the last coupla days
don't think so
You're sure
Find out for me
(with a nod) Sidney, can  talk to you a minute
Rita wears an injured air
Sidney, preoccupied with other worries, callously ignores it
Is Frank 'Angelo around
At the bar - Sidney
But Sidney has moved away from her
' He is at the bar, listening with satisfaction to the music, watching the performers and studying the audience
Sidney comes up behind him
We see Sidney's eyes flick from 'Angelo towards the bandstand and back again
Then, as he takes the stool next to 'Angelo, he assumes a different manner, a sulky resentment
'Angelo sees Sidney
' (to the bartender) Joe, give my nephew a drink
(sullen) Your nephew doesn't want a drink
'Angelo is still watching the quintet
The guitar can be heard again
Shooting past 'Angelo and Sidney towards the bandstand
' That's a lollipop that, boy
The kid is only great
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank
'Angelo looks quickly at Sidney, sensing the undercurrent
Then he turns his back on the musicians, remarking in a quiet tone
' Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks
it's nice you send them the fifty a month
(after a pause) See my mother
' (shaking his head) only had a few hours
glum moment
Frank sips his highball: Sidney lights a cigarette, animosity on his face
' Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow
(begrudgingly) Robard's my client
did it for him and his club, not your boys
Frank again notes Sidney's resentful manner
Sidney looks towards the musicians
(quietly) Frank,  think maybe you lied to me
' (quietly) Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar
(looking towards Steve) You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you
' Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge
And, frankly, 'm glad
For Steve's sake, 'm glad, not yours
manage these boys and  got their best interests at heart
Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age
(narrowly) You told him that
' Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got
pause
Sidney is thinking
When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road
' Coupla weeks
For eight weeks
That's a nice tour
All booked
(Frank nodding) When was Susie around here last
' Four five nights ago
That's how know the romance is off
Also Steve's in a very bad mood
(abruptly) Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth
' (annoyed) don't like this threatening attitude
When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl
Locating Sidney, she comes up behind him
He turns away from 'Angelo as she whispers to him
As she departs, Sidney turns back
If you knew Hunsecker as well as did, you might understand why it's my business
Maybe you're walking around blind, Frank, without a cane
Sidney gets off his stool
Casually, but to effect, he adds: and in case you didn't know it, Susie Hunsecker's out there on the back step right now
He turns away, glancing towards Steve on the bandstand behind him
' He looks disturbed
/ From 'Angelo's point of view
at Steve
The Quintet is now reaching the end of the number, a driving rhythm of considerable excitement
waiter passes in f
g
and the    through the curtained doorway to the backstage part of the club
This movement is continued as we see some other employees, including Jerry Wiggins, the intermission pianist, who is waiting in the corridor near the fire-exit
As he steps out of the door to discard a cigarette,     , into the little courtyard
Here, it discovers the figure of a young woman who is waiting in the shadow near the steps of the fire-escape, listening to the music
This is
She wears an expensive mink coat
It is oddly in contrast with her personality; the face is sensitive and intelligent, but childlike and tragic
girl in adolescence already burdened with problems beyond her capacity
Over scene, the music continues
Susan shifts her position, knowing that the session will soon be at an end and that the musicians will be coming backstage
Steve is playing the last bars of the number; the whole group now in unison
The music comes sharply, dramatically to its finish
There is some applause
The boys relax
Steve reaches for the microphone and in the characteristically casual manner of the "cool" musician, announces the end of the set, thanking the audience, identifying the quintet by name and introducing the intermission pianist
During this, Carson, Chico and Paul wander off the bandstand behind him
Chico, Paul and Carson come through to the corridor backstage
As they do so, Chico, glancing out of the open door sees Susan in the courtyard
He goes out onto the fire-escape; Paul following behind
Hi
Susie
Hello, Chico
Paul
(to Paul) Throw a rope round this chick while go get Steve
Chico goes swiftly back into the club
Paul remains with Susan
There is a momentary silence; Paul is embarrassed because Susan is
Susan makes an effort at conversation, she nods towards the club
Full house
Packin' 'em in
Steve has been trapped by a young woman in spectacles, a much-too-earnest devotee of progressive jazz
'm terribly interested in jazz -- serious jazz
You studied with Milhaud, didn't you
This is such an interesting fusion of the traditional, classical form with the new progressive style,  just wanted to ask you how you came to form the group
- He comes through the curtains of the doorway, pausing as he sees that Steve is involved with the Intellectual Young Woman
Steve glancing at Chico over the shoulder of the Intellectual Young Woman
Seeing that Chico has something to say to him, he wriggles out of the young woman's clutches by passing the buck to the unfortunate to Fred Katz, who is descending from the bandstand behind him
Well, we just sort of got together
(turning to introduce Fred) Maybe if you ask Mr
Katz
He writes the stuff, you know
(blankly) Huh
Steve joins Chico and they go through the curtains into the corridor outside
Chico, smiling, explains: Don't waste your time there, man
You've got something better waiting outside
(as Steve looks at him) Susie's out there
His reaction betrays some emotion
(Over scene the intermission pianist has begun to play a Blues number
) Steve moves a quick step towards the door to the courtyard, then hesitates - almost as if he was afraid to go out
He meets Chico's eye again
What did she say
He is amused, but sympathetic
You proposed to her, not me
(slapping him on the back) Go get your answer
Susan, waiting at the foot of the iron steps, turns as Steve comes out on the fire escape above
Steve comes quickly down the steps towards her, slowing down when he gets a few paces away from her
She looks up at Steve
In his expression we read his mute inquiry
Quite deliberately, with her eyes moistened by love and affection
she nods
Great relief and happiness can be seen in the boy's face
After a moment, he moves to her and she to him
They embrace swiftly, hold each other close and then kiss with passion
Presently, when the kiss is over, Susan speaks softly
(in a whisper) Steve
'll
'll try to make a good wife
Steve is still too choked with relief to speak
For answer, he clasps her more tightly to him
The beam of light which falls on the iron stairs behind them, narrows and then is extinguished
Paul has closed the door
Turning, he shares a look with the grinning Chico and Fred Katz who has managed to escape from the young woman
Before there is time for either of them to make a remark, Sidney comes through the curtains from the Club
Hi, Fellows
Where's the Chief
Sidney's manner is very friendly
But it is immediately apparent from the reaction of the other three boys that none of them likes Sidney
Fred is deliberately uncomprehending
Who
(who gets the point) Dallas
Is he around
Chico's back is to the closed door which opens onto the courtyard
Chico nods in the opposite direction towards the stairs
(unhelpfully) Yeah, he's around somewhere
Upstairs, maybe
(coldly, as he goes) Thanks
Steve and Susan are still embracing
Steve is exultantly proud and happy
(incoherent) This is big, you know
Very big
Let's go out later, drink some firewater
With the boys
Fred can call Millie and - Steve, 'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two
until tell my brother
His sobering reaction shows this is something important
(gently) You haven't told him yet
'm telling him in the morning after breakfast
Turning her head, she makes a little gesture, an unconscious movement, putting her fingers to her brow as if feeling a headache
He isn't going to like it
Susan says nothing
She looks to Steve, smiling, but the smile is not too confident
You sure you don't want me to be with you
Susan stoutly shakes her head
Defensively she reassures Steve: Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted
He isn't perfect, but - But he isn't going to like this, Susie
And he makes you nervous, not me
No,  take that back - he makes me nervous, too
But wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you
The topic evidently makes Susan uneasy
In an effort to dismiss something that she does not want to think about, Susan puts her arms around Steve's neck again
Let's forget him and - But Steve is not so ready to change the subject
His stooge, Falco, is around - saw him walk in
(soberly) He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie
(quickly, perhaps too quickly) Darling,  don't care - really don't
Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business - (gently insisting) But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he
(pleading) Steve, dear, please forget all of this
What can it matter after tomorrow
Now Steve responds
He grins, holds her closer
(softly) have a message for you;  love you
(kissing her lightly) May  dedicate the next number to you
And the next, and the next
Every Sunday 'll buy you a new bonnet - (amused, but moved) If the stores are open - And on Monday, 'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and - And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer
(abruptly grinning) How do you think  realized  love you
made you write a beautiful song
No, you had me eating that Chinese food
They laugh and enjoyably; but then, as the  , we realize that Sidney is there on the fire escape above them; his manner is affable
Can more than two enjoy this joke
(to Susan) Hello, Susie,  didn't expect to find you here
Steve says nothing
But he obviously resents the intrusion and finds it difficult to conceal the fact
Sidney comes down the fire escape towards them
Where's those glossy prints you promised
Tonight's the latest can place them - (barely polite) Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it
(to Susan) It's cold out here, Susie
Steve makes a move to lead Susan back inside
It is a gesture which appears to dismiss Sidney
Sidney chooses to take umbrage: (lightly sarcastic) Let me apologize for getting you that press spread
It's been an honor to serve you gratis
Steve turns to Sidney; his manner is quiet but challenging: (levelly) get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around
(quickly intervening) Steve, stop it please
Frank 'Angelo has followed Sidney out onto the fire escape; other members of the Quintet have also appeared
' What are you boys fighting about
Aggressively indignant, Sidney throws up his hands; he knocks on the metal of the fire escape
(sarcastic) Kill me
Find me a door somewhere - walked in without knocking
Sidney is trying to needle Steve; Steve's temper would normally have exploded; but now he controls it
'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what  said - said you snoop
For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night
(needling) Begging your pardon,  haven't been down the bowery in years
' (soothingly) Come on boys, break it up
(overriding 'Angelo) The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man
His face tightens; he appears to be mortally insulted and controlling himself with difficulty
He turns his back swiftly on Steve, addressing Susan in a voice that has a sharp edge
If you're going home, Susie, 'll drop you off
Sidney starts quickly up the fire escape
This makes Steve angry and he steps forward to follow him
But Chico contrives, without seeming to interfere to obstruct Steve
(easily) Time for the next set, Chief
Just a minute, Chico
Sidney comes inside
When he is out of sight or the group in the courtyard, his manner swiftly changes
It's obvious now that his indignation was assumed; now he looks back towards the courtyard and there is shrewdness in his eyes; he is assessing Steve's temper
But, presently, seeing 'Angelo and the boys returning, he moves back to the curtains into the Club
As 'Angelo and the other boys go inside, Steve turns back to Susan
(fondly) Just so you don't leave me in a minor key
Rita has succeeded in recapturing Sidney near the entrance to the club
Sidney, alert and interested, listens to her while keeping his eye on the bandstand in b
g
where the intermission pianist is finishing his performance and the quintet are returning, ready to mount the bandstand again
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha
(shaking her head) No
That's what  mean - 'm being fired for what  didn't do
Sidney is amused
Rita continues in a confidential manner which is heavily loaded with sex appeal and not-very- convincing air of injury
(soto voce) He came in last week on a very dull rainy night
know who he was, but  didn't let on
(emphatically) He didn't take his eyes off me all night
Listening
Rita has mistaken Sidney's shrewdly calculating expression for inattention
Avidly
He was staring
(continuing) Staring
Consequently, when he approached me on his way out wasn't surprised, but  didn't let on
(prompting) He was writing a special Sunday piece on
(nodding) cigarette girls
And naturally - You were thrilled to be interviewed
(she nods) Were you "interviewed"
In his apartment - And where was his wife
don't know - it's a big apartment
But  wasn't interviewed
In fact, was totally unprepared for what happened
(grimacing) We're old friends, Chickie - quit it
big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter
What did you think would happen in his house
(with a nod) But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning
Despite himself, Sidney chuckles; but she is distressed
For a moment  was so taken aback that  said anything that popped into my sleepy head
If 'm not mistaken,  even ordered the man out of his own house
Sidney's eyes have been caught by something at the other end of the big room
From Sidney's viewpoint
Susan has come back into the club with Steve and seems to be taking leave of him
She starts to walk through the club on her way out
Sidney, with half his attention on Susan and Steve, listens to Rita's rueful protest
(rapidly) He was furious and, by the time could have put on a Tropical Island mood,  was out on the street
(dolefully) That night Mr
Van Cleve calls me into his office here
He's got nothing against me, he says but he can't afford to antagonize columnists
told him  still have Sonny at military academy, but Van Cleve's made of ice
Aware that Sidney is moving to leave her so that he can catch Susan, Rita detains him with an appeal: (tentative) Do you think you could do something, Sidney
(a quick nod) That's what 'm thinking, Rita
Maybe
Rita is anxious to cement the offer
Delicately, she asks: Do you still keep your key under the mat
(eyeing her) Can you be there by two-thirty
She drops her eyes, nods
Sidney pats her arm and is gone
She looks after him
Sidney overtakes Susan at the front entrance in time to open the door for her
He has now reverted to another mood in which he appears to be sulking over the insult delivered to him by Steve
He goes out ahead of her
The quintet are resuming their positions on the stand
Steve lingers a moment, his guitar already in his hand while he talks to 'Angelo
Frank,  don't want any secrets from you
proposed to Susie tonight
'Angelo hides his feelings, asks: ' Did she accept
You don't like it, do you
think she will accept, but 'm not sure
She may be too dependent on her brother
He mounts the bandstand
' (solemnly) Lots of good people in this town are dependent on her brother
Steve sits on the stool, quietly gives the beat to his group and begins at once the guitar opening of a very simple and lonely melody
(The Sage
) While 'Angelo watches him, the boy continues tracks slowly back through the club as the chatter and babble of the customers begins to diminish in appreciation of the quiet melancholy of the music
Susan is standing beside the poster which features Steve, listening to the music from inside the club
Sidney comes to join her
He is now pretending to be hurt
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy
(gruffly) wasn't looking for a brawl came to bring him a present
(then) Wanna bite to eat
Susan shakes her head
She looks up as she hears the doorman's whistle off screen
Sidney moves forward to escort her to the taxi
They cross the sidewalk and get into the cab
It starts off and   with it
Susan is relaxed, content but thoughtful
Sidney flicks her a quick, anxious look
Finally, gloomily: Feels like a Monday night, don't it
(softly) Not to me
Sometimes, the world feels like a cage
Then someone comes along and opens the door
and it's never Monday night again
(turning to Sidney) wish you and Steve could like each other
(grimacing) We stick in each others craw
Yes, but why
Well, for one thing, he thinks
is some kind of monster
Quizzically, she studies Sidney
Don't you
He looks up sharply, (he is momentarily startled at Susan's insight
) Swiftly, he assumes a protesting air
Susie, your brother's one of my best friends, and - She is not totally convinced by this performance
She smiles skeptically
know
But someday 'd like to look into your clever mind and see what you  think of him - Sidney makes a show of indignation
Where do you come off to make a remark like that
(quietly) Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle
Sidney doesn't immediately answer
Susan drops her eyes, becoming absorbed in her own problems
Cautiously, Sidney lets the momentary silence continue
Then: (thoughtfully) Do you think
likes Steve
(glibly) Frankly, yes, to my surprise
He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks
Susan says nothing
Sidney, watching her closely, probes further: (gently) You feel pretty strong about this boy
pause
Then Susan nods
She is not looking at Sidney and cannot see the watchfulness in his face
Sidney prompts again: Wedding bells, you mean
Again Susan nods
He wants me to go on the road with them
It's an eight month tour, all the way to Oregon
The news has considerable impact on him
But he hides it, saying lightly: Well, congratulations
But don't go just for the ride
Or didn't you accept the proposal
Susan continues
'm going to discuss it with
in the morning
pause
Each is concerned with private thoughts
Susan, relaxed, adds quietly: (softly) It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because 'm my brother's sister
Chickie, 'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you
Susan ignores his remark, continuing thoughtfully: hope that
really likes Steve, that it isn't an act
(with an indignant edge) Why should he put on an act
Your brother has told  where to go and what to do
The taxi has pulled to a stop
Susan sits for a moment before she remarks
The act would be for my sake, not Steve's
Realizing that they have come to their destination, Susan gets up, moving out of  as she disembarks from the taxi
catches a glimpse of apprehension in Sidney's eyes
Quickly, he decides to follow her
Susan, getting out of the taxi, moves past
Sidney, following her, instructs the driver
(to cabbie) Wait for me
'll be right back
Sidney moves after the girl, calling: "Susie
" Hearing him, Susan turns back
Sidney walks into shot to join her
(lightly) It's not my nature, Susie, but 'll talk to you like an uncle
(smiling) But  don't need an uncle, Sidney
They move through the doors
Sidney quickly corrects himself, saying earnestly: No,  mean because  admire you - in fact, more than admire you - although that's neither here nor there
(quickly skipping to the important point) Susie, don't sell your brother short
Talk this over with him, mean - you'll find him a real friend
Susan looks thoughtful, making no comment
Carefully (again probing) he prompts her: Any message, in case  see
later
Susan turns away and walks out past
Sidney watches her
She looks back at Sidney, quietly firm
Yes
Tell him for me that Steve Dallas is the first real man 've ever been in love with
She turns away and walks through the inner door, going down the corridor towards the elevators in background
The sincerity of the girl's manner strikes home to Sidney
Now that her back is turned we see the sharp twinge of pain with which he hears the statement of her feelings for another man
Angered, he wheels, striding out of the door onto Broadway
Sidney returns to the cab, instructing the driver: The Twenty One Club
He climbs in and the taxi drives off down Broadway
: - ,   down 52nd Street, as Sidney's cab pulls up, double parking in front of the 21 Club
Sidney maneuvers his way between the parked cars towards the entrance and the   to   the courtyard towards the entrance
We see the figure of Jimmy Weldon and his girl friend coming out of the Club
- Jimmy Weldon is coming out of the Club accompanied by a girl; he is slightly tight
As he steps through the outer doors, Weldon again spies Sidney on the sidewalk; he steps to one side of the entrance way
Sidney slips through the congestion, but just as he tries to enter the Club, Weldon's hand shoots out, neatly ambushing him, pulling him aside into the narrow courtyard
Sidney is instantly resentful of this manhandling, but has to adjust himself, assuming a quick smile for the benefit of Weldon
Jimmy
This is a coincidence am just going - (overlapping) Yeah
coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week
(to the girl) This is my press agent, Joan
Weldon, jibing at Sidney, plays his remarks off the girl, who is amused; Sidney, of course, is not
(quickly) tried to reach you twice - (overlapping) What do you do for that hundred a week
Fall out of bed
Jimmy, 'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker
can promise you - (horsing) Joan, call a cop
We'll arrest this kid for larceny
Sidney flinches, his pride touched
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland - (cutting in) That was two months ago
Take your hand out of my pocket, thief
The girl tries to quiet Weldon, who has gone from horsing to loud contempt
Take it easy, Jimmy dear
(indignantly) Why
It's a dirty job, but  pay clean money for it, don't
Abruptly Sidney bursts out, giving as good as he has taken: No more you don't
What is this - You're showing off for her
They're supposed to hear you in Korea
(smirking to the girl) He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired
If you're funny, James, 'm a pretzel
Drop dead
Weldon, shepherded by the girl, is already on his way across the sidewalk
It was nice knowing you, Sidney
Not cheap - but nice
Happy unemployment insurance
- Sidney, entering the Club, threads his way through the crowded foyer, coming up to  near the foot of the staircase
There he meets a Captain who turns to him
How are you tonight, Mr
Falco
(nodding towards the restaurant) Is "he" inside
But of course
Alone or surrounded
Senator, an Agent and Something - With - Long - Red - Hair
Sidney moves past , coming a couple of paces towards the door to the restaurant
He pauses
From Sidney's viewpoint
Shooting through the doorway into the restaurant, we can see the group at the table
(Hunsecker's back is turned to us
)    to include Sidney in foreground
He decides not to go into restaurant and turns away out of shot
Sidney comes round the corner from the foyer and walks through the lounge to the door into the alcove where the phone booths are,
Sidney moves briskly past the girl at the switchboard, instructing her: Honey, get me Mr
Hunsecker
The girl reaches for a book of phone numbers, then remembers: He's right inside, Mr
Falco
(from inside the booth) So it isn't Long Distance
As the girl, shrugging, puts through the call,  moves closer to Sidney in the booth
He hears the connection made, speaks at once
(to phone) It's me -- We are close enough to the instrument to hear the sound of a voice on the other end
Though the words are not distinguishable, it is quite clear that the speaker is not talking to the phone
Sidney seems to relax, as if this is something that happens often
He waits, studying his manicured fingertips
Presently Sidney hears the voice on the other end become clearer
It asks: "Yes
"  moves closer as Sidney says: , it's Sidney
Can you come outside for one minute
Hunsecker's voice, filtered through the sound of the telephone, is sharp and tiny; but the words are now very clear
(
) Can  come out
No
(tensely) have to talk to you, alone,
, that's why
(
) You had something to do for me - you didn't do it
Can  come in for a minute
(
) No
You're dead, son - get yourself buried
There is a click as Hunsecker hangs up
Sidney, more slowly, also hangs up
Brooding, he comes out of the booth
- Sidney comes out of the door to the phone booths, walks through the lounge to the hallway
He turns towards the dining room
Sidney comes to the door into the dining room, tracking with him
Here he pauses, looking towards
From Sidney's viewpoint
Hunsecker is seated at a table which is cleverly his habitual position
We see him only in semi-back view, a broad and powerful back
He is listening to a man who has paused at his table, stooping over Hunsecker to whisper in his ear
As the columnist listens, his hands play with an omni-present pad and pencil which lie on the dinner table amongst an assortment of envelopes, mimeographed sheets and a telephone
Beyond Hunsecker and the man talking to him are the , the , and an attractive, if fatuous
'll check it in the morning, Low - thanks
The man leaves; Hunsecker is scribbling a note on the pad
Meanwhile the Senator whispers something to the girl, who giggles softly
Sidney comes across to the table, nervous but deliberate
to include Hunsecker in foreground
Sidney, without accosting him, stands a few feet from the columnist's elbow and deliberately lights a cigarette
Hunsecker, barely turning his head, sees him
We have heard of Hunsecker as a monster, but he is evidently in a mild phase of his metabolism, for he seems gentle, sad and quiet, as he turns his gaze casually to the Senator, totally ignoring the young man who stands behind him
(softly) Harvey,  often wish  were dead and wore a hearing aid
with a simple flick of a switch  could shut out the greedy murmur of little men
close shot
Sidney shows no reaction to this insult
He steps in closer, an Indian fixity in his face
,  need your ear for two minutes
Shooting across Sidney, onto Hunsecker
turns - but not to Sidney
He raises his hand in a small gesture which summons a passing Captain, who steps into picture at Sidney's elbow
Mac
don't want this man at my table
(quickly but quietly interrupting) have a message from your sister
The Captain is already there
But now Hunsecker's eyes have switched to Sidney's face
For the briefest of moments, nothing happens
Then Hunsecker, seeming to relax and ignoring the Captain whom he has summoned, turns back to casual conversation with the Senator as if nothing had happened
Forgive me, Harvey
We were interrupted before - In foreground, Sidney turns to the Captain with a carved smile, indicating that Hunsecker's change of topic is to be interpreted as sanction for Sidney to remain
The Captain, not entirely convinced, retreats
Sidney finds himself a chair, places it and takes a seat which is near enough to the table to establish his presence
During this: (who is mildly surprised and faintly embarrassed) Err
the Supreme Court story, was telling you - Justice Black
(nodding) Yes, the Justice, that's right
But  think you had it in the column
(smoothly, casually) Last July, the lead item
Sidney's interjection is quietly well-mannered
Hunsecker totally ignores it
The other members of the party are a little astonished at the interplay
The girl, in particular, is fascinated; she clearly admires Sidney's looks
The Senator, noting this, glances at Sidney, accepting the point: (laughing) And  believe that's precisely where  read it, too
You see, , where  get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington
Now don't kid a kidder
,  , The girl looks again towards Sidney
The Senator again sees this, addresses Sidney pleasantly
don't think we caught your name, young man
Group shot
The Senator in foreground, Sidney beyond Hunsecker in background, and the others on edge of shot
Sidney Falco, sir
And, of course, everyone knows and admires you, Senator Walker
(humorously) Every four years  get less convinced of that
This young lady is Miss Linda James
(indicates the Girl) She's managed by Manny Davis
(he indicates the Agent) Sidney nods pleasantly to the Girl and the Agent
know Manny Davis
(quietly) Everyone knows Manny Davis
(as the phone rings on the table) except
Manny Davis
Hunsecker is picking up the phone, continuing: Yes
Go ahead, Billy - shoot
To intercut with the above
The Senator, the Agent and the Girl watching Hunsecker
The Agent's reaction to Hunsecker's remark is a sickly smile
He repeats aloud a story which is told him over the telephone
Uh huh
Sports cars in California are getting smaller and smaller
the other day you were crossing Hollywood Boulevard and you were hit by one
you had to go to the hospital and have it removed
(coolly) You're not following the column: had it last week
During the speech,  eases back to include Sidney again
At the end, Sidney looks up in the direction of the Senator
Do you believe in capital punishment, Senator
The Senator, amused, asks: Why
Sidney glances sidelong at Hunsecker
(pointing to the phone) man has just been sentenced to death
Hunsecker's face hardens; aware of Sidney's impertinence, he does not design to react directly; he turns towards the Agent
Manny, what exactly are the gifts of this lovely young thing that you manage
The Agent glances uneasily at the Girl beside him
Well, she sings a little
you know, sings
(by rote) Manny's faith in me is simply awe- inspiring, Mr
Hunsecker
Actually, 'm still studying, but - He studies the Girl intently
What subject
Singing, of course
straight concert and - Hunsecker's glance flicks between the Girl and the Senator
Why "of course"
It might, for instance, be politics
As the Girl betrays herself with a nervous glance at the Senator beside her,  eases back to include him
The Senator is unruffled; gravely, he lights a cigar
The Girl laughs
Me
mean ""
Are you kidding, Mr
Hunsecker
With my Jersey City brains
Again his glance links the Girl and the Senator
The brains may be Jersey City, but the clothes are Trainor-Norell
, The Girl and the Agent are both nervously uneasy
The Senator closely examines the tip of his cigar and, with deliberation, turns towards Sidney
Are you an actor, Mr
Falco
(supporting the change of subject) That's what  was thinking
Are you, Mr
Falco
Hunsecker, for the first time, half-turns in Sidney's direction, amused
How did you guess it, Miss James
, They all look at Sidney
He's so pretty, that's how
Sidney bitterly resents the adjective, but contrives to hide the fact; he smiles, gracefully accepting the compliment
Hunsecker (who knows what Sidney feels) is pleased; he turns towards Sidney expansively
Mr
Falco, let it be said at once, is a man of  faces, not one, none too pretty and  deceptive
See that grin
It's the charming street urchin's face
It's part of his "helpless" act - he throws himself on your mercy
skip the pleading nervous bit that sometimes blends over into bluster
The moist grateful eye is a favorite face with him - it frequently ties in with the act of boyish candor: he's talking straight from the heart, get it
He's got about half-a-dozen faces for the ladies, but the real cut one to me is the quick dependable chap - nothing he won't do for you in a pinch
At least, so he says
Tonight Mr
Falco, whom  did not invite to sit at this table, is about to show in his last and most pitiful role: pale face with tongue hanging out
In brief, gentlemen and Jersey Lilly, the boy sitting with us is a hungry press agent and fully up to all the tricks of his very slimy trade
Hunsecker has started his speech lightly, but it has built up to enough cold contempt and feeling to embarrass and intimidate the others at the table
In conclusion, Hunsecker, his eyes on Sidney, picks up a cigarette and waits expectantly
(quietly) Match me, Sidney
(coolly) Not just this minute,
Amused, Hunsecker lights his own cigarette, turns towards a man who comes up to the table
single close up, to intercut with the above
matching single; Sidney's reaction to Hunsecker and to the others at the table
, To intercut with the above; their reactions of embarrassment
florid  comes up to the table, obviously anxious to catch Hunsecker's attention
Hunsecker, in the act of lighting, his own cigarette, scarcely looks at the man as he dismisses him: know - that loafer of yours opens at the Latin Quarter next week
(more sharply) Say goodbye, Lester
The florid man retreats
To cover the embarrassment, the Senator makes a sally in Sidney's direction
May  ask a naive question, Mr
Falco
Exactly how does a press agent work
Sidney doesn't answer
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee
He's trying to take you off the hook
(to the Senator) You just had a good example of it
press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna
, What's manna
Hunsecker glances spitefully at the Girl
Heaven dust
, The Senator continues to Sidney: But don't you help columnists by furnishing them with items
Sidney leans forward, indicating to the Senator some of the items of paper that litter the table in front of Hunsecker; these are both handwritten notes and mimeograph sheets, scraps of assorted items from professional and amateur agents who supply the columnist
Sidney fingers some of them
Sure, columnists can't get along without us
Only our good and great friend,
, forgets to mention that
We furnish him with items - Sidney lifts a mimeographed sheet, as an example
What, some cheap, gruesome gags
(to Hunsecker now) You print them, don't you
Yes, with your clients' names attached
That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world
Now, as  make it out, you're doing  a favor
didn't say that,
The day that  can't get along without press agents' handouts, 'll close up shop, lock, stock and barrel and move to Alaska
, The Agent makes the mistake of trying to agree with Hunsecker
(nodding) Sweep out my igloo, here  come
pulls back as Hunsecker leans forward across the table
He vents upon the unfortunate Agent some of the annoyance prompted by Sidney's impertinence
(to the Agent) Look, Manny, you rode in here on the Senator's shirt tails, so shut your mouth
The Senator doesn't like this treatment of others and his manner and face show it
(slowly) Now, come,
, that's a little too harsh
Anyone seems fair game for you tonight
(not as harsh, but -) This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public
Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space
He finds Hunsecker's manner disturbing, but addresses him frontally
There is some allusion here that escapes me
(an edge of threat) We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we
Why does everything you say sound like a threat
He leans back, speaking more quietly, enjoying himself
Maybe it's a mannerism - because don't threaten friends, Harvey
But why furnish your enemies with ammunition
You're a family man
Someday, with God willing, you may wanna be President
Now here you are, Harvey, out in the open where any hep person knows that this one
Hunsecker leans into shot pointing directly at the Agent
(continuing) is toting  one
Hunsecker points to the Girl and the  makes a slight crab movement to include the Girl as Hunsecker points in turn to her
(continuing) around for you
Another  movement
Now Hunsecker is directly challenging the Senator
He smiles disarmingly
(continuing) Are we kids or what
Hunsecker rises
As Hunsecker stands up, Sidney follows suit
The Agent, very nervous, gets to his feet and the Girl does likewise
The Senator, whose face is sober, also rises from the table
(to the Senator, affably) Next time you come up, you might join me at my  show
With Sidney making way for him, Hunsecker walks round the end of the table to the Senator
The Senator faces Hunsecker solemnly
(quietly and cautiously) Thank you,
, for what  consider sound advice
Hunsecker matches the Senator's solemnity
(deadpan) Go, Thou, and sin no more
Hunsecker moves out of shot
Sidney murmurs a "pleased to meet you" to the Senator; then he follows Hunsecker
The Senator remains looking after Hunsecker
Behind him, the Agent and the Girl, watch him apprehensively
The Senator, his face now showing the traces of guilt which he did not reveal to Hunsecker, seems unwilling to turn back to face them
Hunsecker and Sidney
Hunsecker addresses the Captain on his way out of the restaurant
Mac, don't let the Senator pay that check
'll take care of it, Mr
Hunsecker
tracks with Hunsecker and Sidney as they move out towards the hat check stand
(murmuring) President
My big toe would make a better President
By now they are at the coatroom, Hunsecker smiling
Mr
Hunsecker's coat, Joe
Find me a good one, Joe
He accepts the proferred coat as he moves past
- The Doorman on the sidewalk has noticed Hunsecker, almost before the columnist has appeared
The Doorman wheels, snapping his fingers and signaling towards the car park attendant, who can be seen at some distance in the background under the lights of the Kinney Car Park
The attendant is seen to react with alacrity, running into the Park
Putting on his overcoat, he addresses another of the Captains who has escorted him out of the Club
Dan, anyone calls, tell 'em 'll be at the Morocco, maybe the Embers
Very good, Mr
Hunsecker
Sidney catches up with Hunsecker as he moves out onto the sidewalk
Where's your coat, Sidalee
Saving tips
Sidney thinks of an impertinent reply, decides not to be drawn and says nothing
(to Sidney) My curiosity is killing me; what are you so rambunctious about tonight
Sidney again does not answer; this time he points across the street
There's your fat friend
-   - The car is framed in foreground; We can read the sign attached to the visor
Two men in plain-clothes, detectives, are in the front seats
The man nearest is
Wanting to look like a prosperous business man, Kello looks soft, fat, mild and well-barbered; but he is dangerous; he knows it and enjoys it
With "big shots" he is playful and kidding, always says just enough, not too much
He is very relaxed, and mild in manner, but underneath there is not only an animal energy, but a feral pressing at you
His voice is on the hoarse side
He measures situations automatically and instantly
The police radio is chattering
Also in evidence is the telephone, the radio link with headquarters
The detective at the wheel nudges Kello, pointing across the street
Kello gets out of the car and moves to meet the columnist
(as he approaches) Hello, Harry
(cheerfully) Bonna sera, commendatore
Come sta
Sidney follows a couple of paces behind Hunsecker; he is in no hurry to meet the detective, whom he clearly dislikes
(turning to Sidney) You see, Sidalee, that shows that Lt
Kello likes your people
Kello offers his hand to Hunsecker
It's my Brooklyn background,
'm good on Yiddish, too
Hunsecker accepting the handshake, winces with pretended pain at what is clearly an over-enthusiastic grip
Harry, am  supposed to say "uncle"
Kello laughs, releases the grip; Hunsecker strolls past him stoops to lean into the car listening to the police calls on the radio
Anything fit to print, tonight
(to the policeman in the car) Hello, Phil
How're the kids
The detective inside the car answers, respectfully
Fine, Mr
Hunsecker
Any news fit to print tonight
(joining Hunsecker) just checked "downtown"
Quiet everywhere tonight
Incidentally, what happened to that doll
- You gave me the item last night
Still alive
Yeah
At Bellevue
Still hanging on
But they still don't know if she was pushed
She mighta jumped
Love suicide
(to the policeman in the car) Check it for me, Phil
it's a real heart throb
While Phil lifts the radio phone, calling headquarters, Hunsecker turns back to Kello and Sidney
Mischievously, Hunsecker nods at Sidney
(to Kello) Say hello to Sidney Falco
Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight
He called you my fat friend
(mildly) don't believe it
Instantly aware that
is toying with Sidney, Kello offers his large hand to Sidney, who refuses it
know
know you're the strongest cop in town
(with a laugh) call him the boy with the ice cream face
(laughing) Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's , Harry
(modestly) Yeah,  got eyes
put things together
remember  when you didn't quite "put things together"
Boy
Was the Mayor mad
The memory of something unpleasant clouds Kello's face
Citizens committees
didn't mean to hit the boy that hard
Yeah, that's when a feller needed a friend and  won't forget his initials,
The policeman in the car sticks his head out of the window
(to Hunsecker) She died twenty minutes ago, Mr
Hunsecker
They're still investigating
(shaking his head with total dismissal) That's show business
Thanks, Phil
(to Kello) See you
- 52ND  - Kello gets into the police car
(as he does so) Hasta La Vista,
Hasta Luego
- 52ND
- The car moves off eastward
Sidney and Hunsecker walk westward
Sidney, falling into step with Hunsecker, glances back at the departing police car
Spahish
that must show he likes "spigs", too
like Harry, but  can't deny he sweats a little
now  down 52nd Street
Hunsecker, back to , studies the evening, hearing the sound of a screech of female laughter from one of the groups in the distance
drunk is being thrown out of one of the strip tease joints
love this dirty town
Amused, Hunsecker turns back; he signals across the street to the car park, indicating that the big black Lincoln Continental should follow as he strolls with Sidney
(after a pause) Conjugate me a verb, Sidney
For instance,
with them in a
Sidney is alert now
(continuing) You told me you'd break up that romance - when
(hesitantly) You want something done,
, but doubt if you yourself know what's involved
(soft and sardonic) 'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me
(carefully) Why not break it up yourself
You could do it in two minutes flat
Hunsecker pauses, halts
(harshly) At this late date you need explanations
Susie's all got - now that she's growing up, want my relationship with her to stay at least at par
don't intend to antagonize her if  don't have to
(starting to walk again) Now, be warned, son - 'll have to blitz you
Sidney follows quickly
Frankly,
,  don't think you got the cards to blitz me
don't
Correct me if 'm wrong, but don't think so
(turning to eye him) 'll listen one more minute
Sidney steps in front of Hunsecker, blocking his way for a moment
(very rapidly) About a year ago, you asked me to do a favor
It was a thing - well, never did a thing that dirty in all my life
Hunsecker, totally disinterested in Sidney's problems of conscience, signals to his car again, walks past Sidney, who continues rapidly: Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago
"Sidney,  got a nasty little problem here
" Did  say no
'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like
But all of a sudden  ' And why, as of this date, am  frozen out of the column
(scornfully) Are you finished
(quickly) No, lemme finish
' That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head
And Susan, like you said, she's growing up
Two heads
What  mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here
(incisively) Not "we", Sidney, you
(gamely) Correct me if 'm wrong -
Because when 'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved
(sardonically) Ha
My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years
Sidney quickly moves into
's path, desperate to hold his attention
'll do it,
- don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound
'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head
Let me make a living
(his mouth tight and mean) What you promised - do it
Don't finagle around
It's later than you think
Hunsecker walks past Sidney, now making for the car at which the attendant still waits
(as Hunsecker passes him) Excuse it, but it's later than you think
That boy proposed tonight
Hunsecker is : he stops in his stride; he pauses and he turns slowly to look at Sidney
Lowering, he hesitates, mind clicking
Susie told you that
- Sidney, his eyes bright, nods
Hunsecker studies Sidney, then: No wonder you've been so 'feisty' tonight
pause
(quietly) Can you deliver
Sidney nods
Uh huh
When
Tonight
Before you go to bed
The cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river
Expressionless, he examines Sidney
Then he walks off toward the car
He tips the attendant, who thanks him, but instead of getting into the back of the car, he makes a small authoritative gesture to Nikko (double) to move over so that Hunsecker himself may drive
While Nikko does so, Hunsecker turns back to Sidney, whom the  now includes
(quietly) Don't be a two time loser, Sidalee
The sentence could be severe
He is satisfied
Hunsecker gets into the driver's seat beside Nikko, the Japanese houseboy
is  on Hunsecker who does not look back but is clearly aware of the position of Sidney as he puts the car into gear, revving the engine
- The big car accelerates with impressive power
In doing so, it sends a cloud of fumes and a swirl of dust in Sidney's direction
He leaps out of the way, too late closer to him as, with anger and ignominy he inspects his precious clothing for damage
But, as he looks after the car, his face hardens into grim humor; he senses that this petty gesture from Hunsecker is an indication of his vulnerability, not his strength
As, dusting his coat, Sidney walks away,  , watching his jaunty figure cross the street in the direction of 51st Street
: ' looking over the round bar towards the entrance
Sidney comes in through the revolving doors and comes toward His eyes search among the crowd
approaches Sidney
Hello, Sidney
Wanna table
(shaking his head) Just hopping tonight
Leo Bartha been in
Yeah, having supper with the Mrs
She's over there
The Captain nods towards a booth on the other side of the bar where Mrs
Bartha is sitting alone
Seeing that Bartha is not with her, the Captain looks around the bar
He's somewhere
(interrupting) Thanks,  see him
Sidney is looking back towards the entrance hall, where
Bartha comes forward (from the Men's Room) passing the Captain and Sidney
Sidney moves to intercept him
Hello, Leo
How goes that Sunday piece on cigarette girls
on Bartha as he turns towards Sidney, stopping
(cautiously) Who told you about it
Sidney smiles at Bartha, but the threat is clear
The cigarettes girl
Rita
And she took out all her hairpins, too
He throws a quick glance at his wife in the booth in background
as Sidney, who has noted the look, moves closer to Bartha
never had the pleasure of meeting your wife
You know what  wonder, Leo
Could you use a hot little item for tomorrow's column
Sidney is pulling out of his pocket a pad on which to scribble the item
But Bartha faces him squarely, speaking sotto voce but with emphasis: What is this, blackmail
Beat it
Bartha turns on his heel and turns to walk towards his wife beyond
Sidney's face tightens
After a pause, he makes a decision and walks towards the booth
Bartha's wife is reading a tabloid and sipping champagne while her husband resumes eating a sandwich
These two are antagonists in a long war
Sidney comes up to the table, repeats: Leo, 've never had the pleasure of meeting your wife
Bartha looks up
What can he do
Begrudgingly: Loretta
Sidney Falco
(chatty) How do you do, Mr
Falco
If you know anything about horses, sit a minute
Help yourself to a glass of this
State champagne - that's what my husband buys me
Mrs
Bartha pushes the champagne bottle in Sidney's direction as Sidney sits pleasantly; Bartha concentrates on his sandwich
All the imported wines aren't what they're cracked up to be
Whose side are you on, Mr
Falco, his or mine
Frankly, Mrs
Bartha, 'm a neutral observer for the United Nations
Mrs
Bartha laughs, enjoying his deftness; then: What's your first name
(over scene) Sidney
Mrs
Bartha turns to concentrate on the names in the racing column of the tabloid
(searching the column) No horse running tomorrow by that name
, An  favoring Bartha and Sidney
Bartha glowers at his wife, resenting the fact that she has permitted Sidney to join them
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets
(cheerfully) It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead
(to Sidney) Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who --
(sharply interrupting) That's right
Tell him, so  can read it in Hunsecker's column first
(to Sidney, brightly) Oh, are you a spy for the other side
No,  actually sat down to give Leo an item
produces his pad again, begins to write on it
Leo, he wants to give you an item - don't be sullen
Bartha notes Sidney's writing
(to his wife) Will you mind your own business
(calmly) Hitler
She returns to her paper, ignoring them, Sidney finishes scribbling the item
Just in case you'd like to print it, Leo
It's a blind - no names mentioned
But for your private information, the guy's name is Dallas
He pushes the item to Bartha, who reads it, briefly
Meanwhile: (concentrating on the tabloid) There isn't a single name here that gives off vibrations
Bartha pushes the item back towards Sidney
Sidney glances quickly at Bartha's stony face then, significantly, turns towards his wife
Anything there with a name like "cigarette girl"
Bartha raises his head, looks squarely at Sidney with contempt and anger
His wife is unaware of this reaction
Still looking at the paper, she murmurs: MMmmmm
"cigarette girl"
No, no horse with a name like that
Sidney pushes the item back towards Bartha
Mrs
Bartha's attention is attracted by Sidney's gesture
She looks up, made aware of this strange by-play
Sidney waits; Bartha is white-lipped, but pushes the item back again: don't print blind items
She looks from Sidney to her husband and back
What is this, chess or checkers
, The   favoring Bartha and Sidney
Both Sidney and Bartha are now aware of Mrs
Bartha's curiosity
(pointedly) Neither does Hunsecker
(fractional pause) He likes to use the real names
moment of chill silence
Then Bartha gets to his feet, signals for a waiter
As Sidney rises also: Where are we running
What am missing here
Waiter, the check
(to wife) This man is trying to hold a gun to my head
(abruptly) That's the horse
Shotgun - Shotgun in the fifth
She quickly studies her newspaper again
As quickly, Bartha leans across the table and snatches it out of her hands
In doing so, he upsets the glass of champagne, which contains only a few drops
Bartha turns challengingly to Sidney
(sternly) What do you want to tell my wife, Sidney
She is brushing her lap with her napkin
(indignantly) He wants to tell me that you poured champagne all over my lap
Bartha ignores her, again challenges Sidney
Go on, tell her, 'm waiting
(flustered) What are you talking about
Are you nuts or what
The Waiter arrives in picture beside them, puts the check on the table and goes
Bartha picks it up
Still mopping her dress with her napkin, she waits for her husband to speak
He glances unhappily at his wife
Lorry,  can't let this man blackmail me
, favoring Mrs
Bartha, her husband and Sidney in foreground
Blackmail
Sidney decides to retreat
He turns, starts to go
But Bartha blocks his way, holding Sidney and explaining to the Wife
He wants me to print a dirty smear item for keeping his mouth shut momentarily pause
Then: About what
He is uneasy, ashamed of himself
Foolishly, Lorry, and  hope you'll understand
this cigarette girl
was kidding around with her
this girl,  mean
was kidding around and she took it seriously
It was a case of bad judgment, Lorry, bad taste
and 'm just sorry, Lorry, that's all
She says nothing
, The  favoring Bartha and Sidney, Mrs
Bartha in foreground
Bartha now turns on Sidney
Your friend Hunsecker - you can tell him for me - he's a disgrace to his profession
Never mind my bilious private life -  print a decent, responsible column - that's the way it stays
Your man - there's nothing he won't print if it satisfies his vanity or his spite
He'll use any spice to pepper up his daily garbage
Tell him  said so and that, like yourself, he's got the morals of a guinea pig and the scruples of a gangster
Sidney tries to brazen it out, sneering: What do  do now
Whistle "The Stars and Stripes Forever
" Mrs
Bartha slides along the seat, reaching for her fur
with her as she collects her belongings, slides out between the tables and comes forward, passing Sidney to her husband
(lightly) What you do now, Mr
Falco, is crow like a hen - you have just laid an egg
She presents her fur to her husband, and turns her back, inviting him to put it around her shoulders
, favoring Bartha
He has not fully understood the significance of his wife's gesture
He studies her
She confirms his hopes as she adds: Leo, this is one of the cleanest things 've seen you do in years
With the fur around her shoulders, she turns and takes her husband's arm with some pride
They walk away to include Sidney
He is angry at himself - more for the failure of his efforts at blackmail than any sense of shame at the attempt
At a booth on the other side of the bar sits a dapper gentleman with a twinkle of malice in his eyes
He has been watching the altercation with keen interest and satisfaction
Elwell gives some instructions to a waiter who is serving him with drinks, pointing towards Sidney
Sidney's face shows a burning resentment
He glances about him to see how much of the embarrassing scene has been observed
As he moves away, the waiter walks into shot, addressing him
waiter approaches Sidney
He has a message
Otis Elwell wants to see you, Sidney
The waiter nods towards the other side of the circular bar
Sidney, his humiliation and rage still burning, looks off towards
From Sidney's viewpoint
Elwell beckons
He comes round the circular bar
He shows no eagerness to join Elwell, but approaches the table
Elwell makes a gesture, inviting Sidney to sit
Sidney doesn't accept it
(pleasantly) see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper
(as Sidney starts to leave) Hey, wait a minute
(hesitating) 'm late for a date with a dame
Then, returning, he leans over the table addressing Elwell with quiet anger
Otis, if you're trying to blow this brawl into an item for your column - forget it
Across Sidney and Elwell
Elwell is quietly enjoying Sidney's display of hurt dignity
(affably) How is dear old
by the way
(his anger relapsing) Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock
(lightly) If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours
While Elwell continues, he is not looking at Sidney
Elwell's expression of dislike of Hunsecker is not overemphatic; but Sidney senses, nevertheless, that it is very real - and this gives him a new idea
(continuing over scene) Talk of a wake
- they'd club each other to cater the affair for free
Elwell looks up at Sidney as he continues
(happily) By the way, did  hear something about
giving you the flit gun treatment - he shut you out of the column
(amused) Why
Sidney has rapidly resumed his manner of resentment (in order to exploit Elwell's dislike of Hunsecker)
You don't know that lunatic yet
Whims - egotistic whims
Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy
(a pause, then:) That's what the fight with Bartha was about
"Leo",  says, "Hunsecker froze me out
So 'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item
" (pleased) And, instead, he printed his heel in your face
(morose) see you're full of human feelings
He has lost interest in Sidney
(with a shrug) Like most of the human race, Sidney, 'm bored
'd go a mile for a chuckle
Elwell's voice fades: his attention has been caught by
three people are passing the table, squeezing their way past; a man with two very fetching young women
Elwell's eyes are riveted to the anatomy that is temptingly displayed
(noting Elwell's preoccupation) and two miles for a pretty girl
He is unembarrassed at Sidney's all-too-accurate estimate
(lightly) Three
even four
Elwell turns back towards the papers on his table, a zippered document case and some publications among which a columnist might search for scandal; among these is a magazine of semipornographic nature
(continuing, casually) Then you're really washed up with Hunsecker
The nature of Elwell's reading tastes is also not lost on Sidney
With his eyes glancing at the magazine, Sidney now accepts the original offer to sit down
He produces the slip of paper that Bartha rejected, offering it as illustration
This is how much 'm washed with As Elwell reads, Sidney continues giving a passing scrutiny - apparently casual - to a picture of a girl on the magazine cover
Look, Otis,  make no brief for my bilious private life, but he's got the morals of a guinea pig and the scruples of a gangster
Elwell shows no undue enthusiasm for the item
(dryly) fine, fat dirty item
(offering it back to Sidney) Who's it about
But Sidney doesn't take the paper back; he explains: kid named Dallas, who runs a dinky jazz quintet
(he leans closer) He keeps company with
's screwball sister
This does get a reaction, a flicker of genuine interest
Elwell reads the item for a second time
Watching Elwell read, Sidney encourages: It's a real goody if, like me, you wanna clobber
Now Elwell lays the item down in front of him
Clearly, he is considering it
Sidney prompts again
He's got his  tomorrow
He'd read it just before rehearsals
Elwell nods
But he is still reluctant
(cautiously) Mmm
Trouble is  can't think of any good reason why  should print anything you give me
can't even think of a bad reason
Sidney drops his eyes to the magazine once more
He fingers it in a preoccupied but significant way
(gently) Suppose  introduce you to a lovely reason, Otis
One that's good and bad
and available
His eyes go from the magazine to Sidney; he gets the point alright
'm not an unreasonable man
Elwell reaches for the slip of paper once more
In picking it up, Elwell clearly implies his readiness to accept the item - on conditions
Sidney, in his turn, gets this point
He turns towards the passing waiter
Waiter
The check
: '  - Rita is in the bedroom
She appears to have some familiarity to the premises
She hears the doorbell
She makes swift adjustment to her appearance and takes a swift gulp of a drink as she carries it through to answer the door
' The outer room is lit only by one of the lamps on the desk
Rita crosses and goes to the door
Sidney's shadow can be seen through the frosted glass
At the door, Rita opens it slowly and with a seductive manner
(coyly) Hi
Sidney steps into the room
Rita begins to close the door prior to stepping into his embrace
Sidney puts one arm about her
But now she reacts to
Otis Elwell stands on the landing outside
In most gentlemanly fashion, he takes off his hat
This new arrival gets a dismal reaction from the girl
(unembarrassed) Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell
(with no welcome whatsoever) Hello
Elwell is not unaware of his cool reception
He glances at Sidney as he comes into the room
But his manner is suave
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis
Otis was outraged when  told him Van Cleve was going to fire you
Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what
(to Otis) Right, Otis
Right
Elwell sits down on the sette, stretches his limbs, smiles at the girl
Rita still says nothing
Sidney mistakes her attitude for acquiescence
He swallows his drink, sets it down
thought you two could talk the whole thing over till  got back
Rita looks at him sharply
Back
One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night
He grins at Rita
She doesn't respond
Turning, she goes swiftly through the door into the bedroom
(sharply) Hold on
You can drop me off on your way
Emphasizing the asperity in her voice, she closes the door behind her
Elwell looks at Sidney; Sidney looks at Elwell
Elwell gets up slowly from the settee
(amused by acid) Consternation reigns
Sidney is uncomfortable, not sure how Elwell is taking the rejection
Elwell glances at his wristwatch, lays down his drink
(quickly) Now, Otis
Elwell shrugs, remarks pleasantly but with significance: hate
-- but not that much at this moment
Give me a chance -- He goes into the bedroom, closing the door after him
Rita is in a flurry of indignation
Sitting on the bed, she is fastening one high-heeled shoe
Sidney stands glaring at her
Don't you know who that man is
(bitingly) Yeah
Otis Elwell
The columnist
(nodding with emphasis) Yeah
(aggressively) And he's a perfect stranger to me
(explosively) So take five minutes
Get acquainted
He's an important man - he's lonely - don't be dumb
Rita, who one shoe on, has begun to search for the other
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva
Where's my other shoe
What kind of an act is this
Rita jumps to her feet
Her righteous indignation is handicapped by the lop-sided stance caused by the lack of one shoe
Don't you think  have any feelings
What am
bowl of fruit tangerine that peels in a minute
(caustic) beg your pardon
turn myself inside out to help you and now 'm a heavy
(stooping swiftly as he discovers her shoe) Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door
Contemptuously he thrusts the coat and the shoe into her arms
The positive force of his manner gives the girl pause
There is a silence
Rita searches for words to explain the offense to her sensibilities
Sidney
don't do this sort of thing
What sort of thing
(emphatic) This sort of thing
(as emphatic) Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you
And so do
need his column--tonight
(then) Didn't you ask me to do something about your job
Don't you have a kid in Military School
pause
Sidney has struck brutally home
Rita's lower lip trembles
You're a snake, Falco
You're a louse, a real louse
Sidney's manner becomes swiftly sympathetic - but still urgent
(persuasively) Honey - he's going to help you
You want to lose your job
Rita begins to waver, her moral indignation losing ground before Sidney's reminders of her dire necessity
(remonstrating) girl needs a little romancing before she - (cutting in) Next time 'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling
(in a small voice) What would you think of me if - (cutting in to reassure her) Nothing  didn't think of you before
(dryly, with significance) - that's what  mean
This attempt at humor signals to Sidney that he has brought her round
He comes to her, pats her in an encouraging manner - to which she does not respond
He turns to the door, and picks up the glasses she has set down on the table behind it
(as he opens the door) How many snorts does it take to put you in that Tropical Island Mood
Sidney goes out
' Elwell overhears the last remark and as Sidney passes him, he winks
While Sidney pours another drink, Elwell faces the doorway
Rita comes into it, stands on the threshold
She is still far from enthusiastic
(an inspiration) Havana
That's where we met
Rita shakes her head morosely
Sidney comes and puts a stiff drink into her hand
Elwell raises the glass toasting the girl, encouraging her to drink
Rita responds dimly
(to Otis) Here's mud in your column
Sidney laughs, more from relief than from the joke
Blessings on thee, the both
well
Gotta run now
See you two kids later
(lightly) Hurry back
At the door Sidney takes cheerful leave of them
Don't do anything  wouldn't do
That gives you lots of leeway
' Closing the door, Sidney seems pleased with himself
He goes swiftly down the stairs
' Rita remains on the threshold of the doorway between the two rooms
There is an uncomfortable silence
Elwell carries it off by coming to the girl, offering her a cigarette
She accepts it
Elwell studies her, smiling affectionately
Rita meets his eyes, avoids them again, then quietly offers the information: Palm Springs
Two years ago
Elwell begins to laugh
Whatever the memory, it seems to amuse him vastly because he continues to laugh
(delighted) That's right
Rita drinks
She adds glumly: Don't tell Sidney
Elwell continues to laugh as we
: - Shooting east on 46th Street walks Sidney, coming out of the entrance of his apartment, towards
He is pleased with himself, satisfied with his ingenuity in dealing with Rita and Bartha
The streets behind him are dark and empty (it is about 3:00 in the morning)
moves with Sidney as he steps briskly into the orange juice stand and lifts the receiver from the pay telephone
There are no other customers at the counter, but the man behind is squeezing orange halves for the day ahead, piling up a mountain of empties some of which fall at Sidney's feet
'  - shoots up at the penthouse on the roof of the Brill Bldg
The Budweiser sign is extinguished, a black silhouette against the sky
light burns in the window of Hunsecker's apartment
'  - The ringing of the telephone is heard in the big room - an impressively furnished apartment which has a decor indicating that the owner thinks of himself in epic terms
moves to discover Hunsecker in robe and pajamas, tapping at his typewriter
Taking his leisurely time, he picks up the phone and eventually answers it
(to phone) Yes
You sound happy, Sidney
Why should you be happy when 'm not
(then) 'll see the papers when  get up
How do you spell Picasso, the French painter
(languidly writes down Picasso on his scratch pad, answering a query, dryly) It's an item -  hear he goes out with three-eyed girls
- shoots past Sidney at the phone toward Broadway, which is now deserted
street-flushing truck goes by, moving through the dead city
(to phone) It would be nice if you mentioned ----- - Robard's jazz joint -- it's his 20th anniversary
Don't begrudge it to me,
-  owe him lots of favors
(glancing toward the attendant to see that he has not overheard) think you understand, don't you, that the Dallas skull is badly dented
Oh, real bad
starting today, you can play marbles with his eyeballs
(even coquetting) Don't hold out on me,
, mention Robard
- (hangs up and walks to street) '  - Hunsecker is writing Robard's name on his pad, but he says into the phone: We shall see what we shall see
(lazily) And don't ever use this apartment phone again;  have a nervous sister
He cradles the phone, looks at it for a moment, switches his eyes and then physically follows them, rising to stroll towards the glass doors onto the terrace
He moves out and turns aside to look in at the adjoining window, which belongs to Susan's bedroom
'  - shoots across Susan in foreground; she is asleep, a tired, helpless, sweet kid
The figure of her brother is seen - a dark shape on the terrace outside
He moves away across the terrace
- Hunsecker turns from the window
is close on his brooding face
tracks with him as he crosses towards the parapet
At this height there is a wind which blows his hair and the movement of the camera emphasizes a remarkable vista of the New York skyline
The buildings are now dark, only a few of the electric signs are left on all night
comes to rest looking over Hunsecker's shoulder; it tilts downward to a view of Broadway below, Duffy Square in the distance
- close-up; Hunsecker is looking down on his "kingdom"
But there is little love in the man's face, only authoritarian power
- From Hunsecker's viewpoint
The streets empty, except for an occasional passing taxi
The street flushing truck comes up Broadway from Duffy Square
: - The identical camera set-up
Through the dissolve the light changes from night to day; Broadway magically becomes a roaring stream of traffic
- In foreground a
Sidney comes out of the exit of a subway, reaching for his pocket as he approaches the news vendor who offers him a paper
The Globe
(shaking his head) Gimme The Record
Sidney buys and opens the paper
closer to shoot over his shoulder
We see the gossip column which bears a photograph of Otis Elwell at the top
Smirking with satisfaction, Sidney turns away from the  and throws the paper into a trash basket before he disappears into the impressive entrance of a large office building
The sign above the doorway reads:
: Mary, Hunsecker's secretary, occupies a cubicle which is separated form the rest of the newsroom by a partition
From the big room beyond, comes the hum and chatter of a big newspaper
The walls of the urgent murmur of the staff of a big newspaper
The walls of Mary's cubicle are covered with photographs; filing cabinets are piled high with unopened mail; two wire service teletype machines click desultorily
Mary is plain but attractive, past 30, a level-headed woman with a sense of integrity
She is on the phone just now, bored with the insistent voice on the other end
Beside her an earnest young  waits with several papers in hand
(to phone) have no power to retract, Mr
Cummings
'm only Mr
Hunsecker's secretary
No
Nor can  agree that can retraction is necessary
Thank you for calling
Sidney has come through the newsroom in background
He pauses tactfully, seeing Mary occupied with the lawyer
(huffily) fail to see what's amusing about these papers
'll get the boss to sign them
(giving her the papers) They're important
You've said that six times - that's why 'm smiling
As the disgruntled lawyer leaves, Sidney comes in, wearing his most winning smile
With a glance after the lawyer, making sure that he is not observed, Sidney greets Mary, assuming a brogue: Hello, Mary, me darlin' and phwat are ye up to today
Sidney's hand caresses her shoulder with a gesture which indicates a certain intimacy between them
That's a question  usually like to ask
Your secretary phoned
What about
(shrugging) Something about a Frank 'Angelo trying to reach you
Sidney reaches for the phone
As he does so, Mary hesitates and glances at a copy of The Record which lies on the desk open at Otis Elwell's column
She picks it up
(continuing) Is that the man who manages Susie's boyfriend
Sidney murmurs casually, "Yeah
Why
" as he dials
Mary holds up the paper, indicating the item
Have you seen this
In Otis Elwell's column
(reads) "The dreamy marijuana smoke of a lad who heads a highbrow jazz quintet is giving an inelegant odor to that elegant East Side Club where he works
That's no way for a card-holding Party Member to act
Moscow won't like, you naughty boy
" Sidney accepts the paper from Mary, examines the item while he talks to Sally on the phone
(into phone) Sally
got the message
If 'Angelo calls again, tell him 'll be at the office around noon
He hangs up, continuing to read
Could this be that boy
(casually) Dallas
Could be
He doesn't look like a reefer smoker
He discards the paper with a show of disinterest
Mary picks it up again
(looking at The Record again) If this is true,
's going to hit the ceiling
Sidney moves around behind Mary
His eyes are fixed on a spike which sits on Mary's desk
On it is impaled a proof of Hunsecker's column
Meanwhile, he remarks: Can it be news to you that
's ceiling needs a plaster job every six weeks
From Sidney's viewpoint, Hunsecker's column
The shot is just too distant for us to be able to read the print
Sidney is looking at the column
Mary is concentrated on papers before her
Without looking up, she is clearly aware of Sidney's efforts to read the proof
(quietly) Sidney, you know that
doesn't like people to look at the column proof in advance
Sidney, caught "in flagrante", laughs
Mary, 'm not "people" - there's Falco blood, sweat and tears in that column
He turns away, changing the subject (apparently)
How about dinner tonight
Mary turns to study him
Bribing me again
(uncomfortable under her scrutiny) And why should  bribe the woman who holds most of my heart
Mary is thoughtful
Without malice, in a detached sort of way, she examines Sidney
You're a real rascal, Sidney
'd certainly dislike you if  didn't like you
You're an amusing boy, but there isn't a drop of respect in you for anything alive - you're too immersed in the theology of making a fast buck
Not that don't sometimes feel that you yearn for something better
Sidney finds this analysis hard to take
Again he tries to laugh his way out of it
(cynical) Mary, don't try to sell me the Brooklyn Bridge
happen to know it belongs to the Dodgers
Mary, smiling, decides "to let him off the hook"
She takes the spike and the column and passes it across to Sidney's side of the desk, as she returns briskly to her business
(affably) don't mind you looking at the proof of the column in advance, as long as
doesn't know
But don't do it like a boy stealing gum from a slot machine
Sidney doesn't like this; but, on the other hand, he does want to look at the column
After only a momentary struggle, he picks the column off the spike and reads
Who put this item in about the comic
(reading) "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name
We were too busy screaming
" Does this Temple have a press agent
No
It's one of
's occasional beau gestes
Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug
He goes to the door, grinning
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then
She looks after Sidney, thinks about him for a moment
Then she types
- Sidney comes down 47th Street from Broadway, making for the stage door entrance of the Palace theatre
He walks confidently into the alleyway, paying no attention to the old doorman gossiping with the shoeshine boy at the chairs next to the entrance
The doorman turns, protesting: (calling out) Hey
: Sidney, without halting, looks back towards the Doorman, addressing him with the patronizing manner of a superior
Herbit Temple here yet
Yeah, but you can't come in now
'm in, Sonny Boy
He is already on his way into doorway
The movie will soon by finished and the comedian who opens the stage show is ready and made-up in the wings
He sits with his agent, ( ) a small, worried, bespectacled man, who waves an unlighted cigar as big as himself
They converse in loud whispers, talking against the muffled and echoing sound of the film sound track, silhouetted against the ghostly, distorted images on the big screen seen at a weird angle behind them
didn't waste words, Herbie, take my word
says, "look, Figo, 'm not selling you a dozen eggs, 'm selling you  ",  says, so don't gimme your lip
The comedian, Herbie Temple, looks up
Sidney comes through a fire-proof door which separates the stage from the corridors to dressing room
In background two chorus girls in costume are squeezed into a telephone booth
Sidney joins the comedian and the agent; he smiles to the comedian, while he addresses the agent
Hiya, Al
The agent looks from Sidney to Temple, surprised and displeased
Since when did you two get acquainted
Sidney has clearly never met Evans; blandly he chooses to regard the agent's remark as an introduction; he offers his hand with generous amiability
How do you do, Mr
Temple
The comic accepts the hand doubtfully
(uncertain) Delighted
'm Sidney Falco
(still dubious) Yeah, delighted
Evans stands up, warns the comic
Watch this guy, Herbie, he's a press agent
Temple's smile congeals
You watch him, Al,  s
s
stutter
(in no way discouraged) Temple,  caught your act the other night and - Did you now
On which bounce
- and  just had to drop by and tell you how great  thought you were
(dryly) Cheers
What time is it, Al
You got ten minutes
(to Sidney) Hope you don't mind, Falco: we're busy and if - Sidney stands up
No,  don't mind
'm busy too
(scowling) Good
We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr
Frannis-on-the- Portisan
Sidney moves toward the doorway onto the corridor
The chorus girls have now vacated the phone booth
But can  ask one impertinent question here
With no criticism intended, because  know, Al, you earn your ten percent, how come you let a sock act like Herbie Temple tip-toe through town without a publicity build
Smiling wise, Evans shakes his head
We're not buying it, Falco - no fish today
Sidney presses, as if annoyed
'm not selling
'm just curious, that's all
Temple turns away from Sidney, leaving him to Evans
Answer the man, Al, if he asks you a question
Quick, before he thinks up another
Evans moves to Sidney, trying to shepherd him out the way he came
Mr
Temple doesn't believe in press agents - does that answer you something
Evans makes the mistake of laying a hand on Sidney's elbow
Sidney doesn't like people touching him
He reacts in anger, as we have seen before - fixes a burning eye on Evans
Take your hand off, lump
(more politely, to Temple) No one believes in press agents, Temple, when they make claims they can't perform
got nothing to sell -  didn't come here to peddle - but if  tell a client that Hunsecker will give him space, it's not just talk
Sidney stops briskly up the stairs into the corridor
Evans, angry, is stalled for a moment of delay action by mention of the magic name of Hunsecker
(after hesitation) Listen, you bull artist -
Let him go, Al
But Sidney has already stepped to the phone booth and is dialing
(to phone) Hello
Mary, let me speak to
, please
it's Sidney Falco
Shooting past Sidney in foreground onto Temple and Evans beyond, they watch him, open-mouthed
Sidney notes their reaction
(to phone) Tell him it's important
'  - Gloria is at her desk, bewildered as she speaks into the phone
What
Is this Sidney
(to phone) Sure, 'll wait
While doing so, he glances back with disinterest at Evans and Temple
The comedian and the agent exchange looks
Evans is uneasy; he comes up the steps into the corridor to address Sidney with a deflated manner
(hesitant) Look, nobody hired you
We didn't talk any deal, and - With his hand over the mouthpiece, Sidney addresses Evans with contempt
Relax, lump
told you 'm not selling fish
(abruptly reverting to the phone) Sidney
How are you, sweetheart
(laughing) Yeah
(then seriously) Listen,  know it's late,
, but is it too late to add something important to the column
(grinning) No, not a relative, but important
-
' Shaking her head, Gloria places the phone down on the desk, looks at it as it chatters away
She considers returning to her typing, but, worried, picks the phone up again
Sidney's chattering voice is barely audible: "You know Herbie Temple, the comic
What about him
He's at the Palace and he's great
That's what about him
And you'd do me a big bunny basket of a favor if you would say it in tomorrow's column
Temple and Evans are now staring at Sidney with considerable respect
The comedian and the agent in foreground, Sidney still on the phone beyond
Yeah, if you got a pencil there 'll suggest a word or two
Uh
uh
The comedian and the agent in foreground, Sidney still on the phone beyond
(to phone, continuing) If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace
uh
pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing
No, make that 'screaming'
(then) It's sweet of you,
, thanks
Probably see you at Twenty One tonight
No, for supper, late
Right
'Bye
Speak to this lad, Al,
to Mr
Falco
See me in my office
He turns and walks away down the corridor
As he vanishes, Temple starts after him
Sidney walks off in the direction of the exit -- (not so fast that he can't be overtaken)
Temple hurries into the corridor and comes after him
Evans also follows, though not so eagerly
Wait a minute
(turning back to encourage Evans) Speak to him, Al
(to Sidney, apologetically) Al makes all my deals
Sidney permits himself to be detained
(coolly, looking toward Evans) don't like a guy that's quick with the hands
(to Temple) Temple, you've been three passes behind for twenty years
This could start you off big -
and anywhere
Evans, not as wholly convinced as the comedian, comes up to join them
Temple looks at the agent
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh
(to Evans) You tell him,  stutter
(shrewdly) Uh
Why don't we wait till tomorrow
Sidney, shrugging, makes a negligent exit
(as he goes) Wait as long as you like - you know where my office is
They look after him
Evans face is cold and suspecting, but Temple's face contains fresh warmth
: '  - Sidney comes briskly up the stairs
Outside his door he pauses, listens, hearing the murmur of voices inside
Then he walks in casually
'  - Sidney steps in, closing the door
He pretends surprise as he sees
Steve and 'Angelo waiting for him
Sidney comes into Sally remains at her desk while Steve and 'Angelo are silent, looking at Sidney
(perkily) What is here, a wake
'Angelo rises from the couch, crossing to Sidney to hand him a copy of the tabloid, The Record
It is folded open at Elwell's column
As he passes it to Sidney, 'Angelo marks with his thumbnail an item near the bottom of the column
Sidney takes the paper and reads
(He reads a little too quickly
)  Then he hands it back to 'Angelo
Steve notes Sidney's too-perfunctory reading
You read as you run, don't you
Sidney turns on Steve, coldly: It's a habit with me
So now 'm briefed
So what
(glancing at 'Angelo) Frank thinks  shouldn't have come here - ' (a quick correction) Excuse me, Steve
said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification
(watchfully, to Sidney) thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated
Favoring Sidney
He pauses
Why me
Why not you
That's your idea of logic
tell the Judge  didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you
" Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both
(explosively) Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife
So how do you get him doing
a favor
(quickly) It is a favor, isn't it
(as quickly) According to you, yeah
(continuing rapidly and with heat) Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty
don't like you, comma, but neither do go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds
Also, since we're talking repulsive,
won't like this for two cents
Don't give me that look, Dallas -
believes in fair play
And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend
Sidney's manner is a little too vigorous
(In adopting an aggressive tone, he is really trying to needle Steve
) Steve, though on the verge of losing his temper, is sharp enough to notice the point: You're talking very fast
(expostulating) Well, 'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya
(wheeling to Sally) How do you like it
He comes to my office and - ' Sensing the danger, 'Angelo moves forward soothingly between them
' Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and - (sharply) Don't apologize for me, Frank
' excited with good reason, wanted to say
(to Sidney) Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet
(lightly) Should  cry
Steve, with a glare at both men, goes to the phone on Sally's desk
He dials
' (continuing) People catch on quick to such an item
Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet
Then what are you doing here
Go over there and fight
If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth
In background Steve speaks quietly into the phone: want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please
' (replying to Sidney's question) We're on our way there now
(who has wheeled on Steve) What are you calling her for
Sidney's reaction to the mention of Susan's name gives Steve food for thought
While he waits for Susan to be summoned to the phone, he studies Sidney
(to Sidney) 'm the boyfriend, remember hope one day she'll be my wife
(into the phone, gently) This is Steve, Susie
Don't be alarmed, Susie, but  want you to look at Elwell's column in The Record
today
No, about me
'  - '  - Susan is on the phone
Listening to what Steve says, she is frightened - almost too frightened; it is as if, in some curious sense, she had been expecting this blow
It brings an echo of an earlier tragedy
smear
What
What kind of smear
Where are you
' Steve is on the phone in foreground, the others watching him
In particular, Sally, who stands near Steve, is studying him with obvious sympathy
She looks slowly towards Sidney
(to the phone) We're on our way to the Elysian Room to dicker with Van Cleve - he's fired us already
'll call you later, dear
'Bye
He hangs up quietly, looks at Sidney and walks towards the door
Come on, Frank
As the door closes behind Steve, Frank follows, more slowly
As 'Angelo reaches the door, he pauses with his hand on the doorknob and turns back to study Sidney
He feels uneasy under 'Angelo's scrutiny
Sally, in background, is also watching Sidney
(to 'Angelo) What are you looking at
' He does not answer for a moment
The unspoken accusation in his look is very clear
Then: ' (quietly) The ugly world, Sidney
(a pause) If  told Steve what  really think, he'd tear your head off
He brazens it out
(sneering) Tell him
' 'Angelo shakes his head
' No
'm interested in his future
'Angelo goes slowly out
He hesitates before turning towards Sally (because he realizes that this exchange with 'Angelo must have confirmed Sally in her suspicions)
Her face shows that Sidney is right
Sally is deeply hurt, disillusioned
Sidney turns to her, challenging
What's the matter
(not looking at him) Nothing
Resentfully, Sidney moves about the room
Sensing the silent accusation against him, he is aggressive
You know, Sally, sometimes  get the impression you think you live in Star-Bright Park
This is life, kid - get used to it
Sidney comes to the phone on her desk
He dials
Then he glances swiftly at Sally and, carrying the phone, walks into the bedroom, dragging the long cord behind him
When the phone comes alive, Sidney pushes the bedroom door shut
The gesture is as casual as he can contrive to make it
Keeping his voice fairly low so that it cannot be heard in the other room, he says: (to phone) Nikko, is Mr
Hunsecker there
This is Mr
Falco
Well, have him call me as soon as he can
It's important
He sets the phone down on the bedside table, looks at it thoughtfully before he goes back to the bedroom door, opens it and goes back into the office
Sidney stands on the threshold, studying Sally
His manner is now more sympathetic as he asks: Did you send my folks in Philly the check
Yes
Leaving the bedroom door open, Sidney comes up to her, watches her shrewdly, cautiously
(softly) put a lotta trust in you, Chickie
(low-voiced) know you do, Sidney
Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved
Sally is putting paper in the typewriter, trying to hold her head up
'm not judging
Sidney comes closer to her
He puts his hand on the nape of her neck, carrassing her
Under his touch, the girl is unhappy, and yet at the same time, responsive
Sidney still has power over her but she is disturbed by feelings of shame
Feeling her relaxed, Sidney bends and kisses her on the side of the throat with more than negligence, for something about her always excites him; his aggression tune in with her submissiveness
(pathetically) swear, Sidney,  can't help it - sometimes  wonder what  see in you
(murmuring) That's no way to talk
Or what you see in me, for that matter
Stay down town tonight
Maybe we'll take in a show, etc
If you want me to - The phone in the bedroom rings
Sidney, reacting sharply, forgets his advances to Sally as he turns towards the bedroom
(exhilarated) You see
Hunsecker's gotta phone
He goes into the bedroom, closing the door as he goes
Sally looks at the closed door
Sidney has picked up the phone
(calmly) Hello,
presume you saw the Elwell smear
(smiling) No, no medals - not yet
Oh, it's worse than that - Aunty Van Cleve is firing them
from the horse's mouth
They were just here - in a panic
'  -   - Hunsecker wears a dressing gown as he sits at his breakfast table
Behind him are the big glass windows to the terrace overlooking the Manhattan skyline
The papers are at Hunsecker's elbow; his manner is crisp and cold: Who was just there
(then) You'll be the death of me
Sidalee
Why
Didn't you just tell me that they've already traced this smear to you
All they have to do now is to put two and two together and 'm a chicken in a pot
' Sidney smiles confidently, answers calmly: , peace on earth, good will to men - it's working out just the way planned
Yeah,  guarantee this bomb will pop right on schedule, but you have to play your part - you be a Saint and let me be the Devil
But  wanna talk to you first
' Hunsecker pauses, eyes full of cold voltage
Don't come here
Susie is up and about
(listening) He called her
You'd better see me at the  - three o'clock
He bangs down the phone, tense thought in his manner
' Sally is busy with her typing again, but in a depressed mood when Sidney comes out of the bedroom to put the phone down on her desk again
He seems satisfied with himself, smug
Sally watches him for a moment
Then: What are you going to do
Sidney prepares to leave the apartment
His tone is full of confidence, self-assertive
(For once Sidney is certain that he is smarter, more cunning than even Hunsecker)
(the wise one) Chickie, a lotta people think they're smart
You watch
They're dumb: they'll do the work for me
Just watch
Sidney makes for the door, goes out
- Susan buys paper -  with her - toward elevator - she gets in
' has not moved; he is thoughtful and morose
Nikko, the Japanese butler, comes in to remove the breakfast table
The table can wait
No calls have to think about my  show
Pleased to do
will come back later
(abruptly) Did you put the bread out on the terrace for the birds
Yes, but they don't come no more this time of year
Smiling, Nikko leaves
Hunsecker picks up a pencil and makes a note on a pad, about birds no doubt
Abruptly he looks up, calling: Susie
Come in a minute, dear
She has been trying to pass unnoticed to her room
She comes forward to him; her manner is serious and wary
His act is one of a tasteful Mammy singer, but he is watchful, too
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today
Why
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand
(pausing) Did Sidney tell you about it
Yes, he phoned
don't know this boy too well
Anything in these charges
She shakes her head
Not being partial, are you
(with quiet certainty) No, 'm not
'm not
He soothes, smiles indulgent, but watchful: Susie, take it easy
'll trust your judgment - you don't have to protest with me
With a paternal gesture of affection, he holds out his arms, inviting her into his comforting embrace
Not wanting to, she walks into his open waiting arms
Why are you trembling, dear
History repeats itself
Everything that happened to Alan Leslie
began with a smear like this
Hunsecker considers this gravely, as if it was a new and troubling thought
Yes
She leaves his arms; he watches keenly
(incoherent) It's just as if 've seen a ghost today
(quickly) But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie
've told you that a million times
He goes to her gently; she appraises both him and her wrenched life with brooding, frightened eyes
Then whose fault was it,
It was someone's fault, wasn't it
(gravely) wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced
(stronger) Alan was not
unbalanced when married him
And he was not
'indifferent to women' no matter what they said
(simply) 'm not fighting with you, puss
She gets up and walks around in considerable agitation
He never would have killed himself if  hadn't gone through with the annulment
Don't you see that made all the rumors seem true
should have stood up for him
not run out
She turns to Hunsecker, her manner firmer
,  want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet
("incredulously") You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear
He walks away with a wag of indignation,  but turns, asking: Susie, you're sure there isn't some fire where there's this much smoke
Susan shakes her head emphatically
(earnestly) know Steve
No
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets
(involuntarily) Sidney is a liar
Who said Sidney
(defiantly) said Sidney
Staring, he pauses; then he deftly changes the subject
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and , and  don't like that
thought we were talking about Sidney
(with rasp) Let me finish, dear
You had your say, now let me have mine
(interrupting) haven't said anything yet,
, but if - Susan hesitates
Hunsecker waits for her to continue
But she isn't yet sure enough of herself or of the point she means to make
She turns away
(gently) started to say we're drifting apart
year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me
Today  had to call you in
'm taking up the situation with you now
(interrupting) Susie,  want to help you--, there's nothing  won't do for you
You're all 've got in the whole, wide world
Hunsecker strides about, elaborately playing on a note of disillusion and pain
(continuing) Well, what have  got
Alimony to a pair of tramps
They're of no concern to me
It's you who count, but don't get me wrong -  don't intend to let you break your neck again
, you said you want to help me - prove it
(quietly) How
Get Steve back his job
please
(pausing) He means that much to you
(simply) Yes
(then) With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel
You're picking up my lingo, hon
(levelly) read your column every day
He looks at her with pursed lips and, for a change, some real interest
Her level, straightforward manner has pinned him down completely; he shows a slow, charming grin, as he goes for a private phone book: Susie,  like this new attitude of yours
You're growing up and like it
don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward
This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world
Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you
No,  won't
He crosses to the white desk phone, delaying dialing for a moment: This Dallas boy must be good for you
Why not bring him around today, before the show
This time 'll clean my glasses for a better look
Susan doesn't like this idea, is evasive: 'm not sure  can reach him in time
(easily) Sure you can if you want to, and know you'll want to
(then) By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney
(steadily) When 'm certain, 'll let you know
man couldn't ask for a squarer shake
(into phone) Let me have Billy Van Cleve
(then) Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how 'm tied to your apron strings
(to phone) Billy
What's this about that boy
What boy
Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy
You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas
(then) No, don't explain your point of view, but
- the entrance to the  theatre line of people are queuing for Hunsecker's  Broadcast which is advertised by large posters beside the entrance taxi drives up in foreground; Susan Hunsecker gets out
Sidney comes up Sixth Avenue towards the theatre
As he reaches the corner of the building, he halts, having seen
Susan is seen in the act of paying the driver
As the taxi pulls away, Susan walks  left
Susan pauses, deciding not to enter the theatre; turning she looks about her and waits on the sidewalk outside
Sidney decides that this is not the moment to approach Susan
He glances down the sidestreet then moves off in that direction
Sidney moves down the sidestreet towards a stage entrance, through which are emerging some  technicians
He slips inside
Hunsecker is standing at a table, stop watch in hand, reading aloud from a script which he is rehearsing and timing
Beside him sits Mary busy typing more of the material from Hunsecker's handwritten note
Mary is calm, but he is irritable, trying to concentrate despite the bustle around him
An old movie star,  , sits waiting in one of the canvas-backed chairs supplied for the guests on the show
, a manager, also waits, deadpan, at Hunsecker's elbow
Hunsecker clicks his stop watch as he reads: " was reminded of it this morning, when  noticed that the birds had gone South
We want the same kind of freedom for ourselves - that's what the man said
(he clicks the watch, pauses to underline the phrase, continues:) man has the right to face his accusers
That's the American Way
Who said
The man said
From
" He turns in exasperation to Burton
Burton, don't stand around
If go over 'll cut some items off the tail
Burton departs
Mary whips a second sheet out of the typewriter, hands it to Hunsecker
As he accepts it, Hunsecker looks off towards the auditorium
towards the auditorium, from Hunsecker's viewpoint
Sidney mounts the steps onto the stage
Seeing that the columnist is surrounded but knowing that
wants to talk to him privately, Sidney loiters so that
can join him as soon as he chooses to
to include Hunsecker
Only momentarily distracted by private considerations connected with Sidney's arrival, Hunsecker returns to the business of timing the script
He clicks the watch again
"From Washington through to Jefferson, from Lincoln and
right up to today - the Democratic Way of Life
That's what the man said
Nowadays it doesn't export to well
(then, concluding) But you know
and  know
that our best secret weapon is ---- ----
(dropping to a modest tone) Let's never forget it, ladies and gentlemen
" Sidney lingers beside the old movie star who is listening, rapt, to Hunsecker's words
Sidney is less impressed with 's eloquence
At the conclusion, Mildred applauds lightly
She stands up and moves towards
wants to talk to Sidney but is frustrated by the old movie star
That's grand, just grand,
(then, anxiously) Is my makeup all right
You know, despite the scads of movies 've made, 've never appeared on yet
(cutting her short) Of course, Mildred
Of course
You look fine
(swiftly summoning Mary) Mary, help Miss Tam - anything she wants; she's our star today
Under the pretense of studying the typed script,
walks away across the stage
Sidney strolls after him
Sidney comes up beside Hunsecker, falls into step beside him
As they cross towards a water cooler at the back of the stage, they talk in rapid undertone
got that boy coming over here
(a glance at Sidney) What's so funny
(who is smiling faintly) With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good
(narrowly) think you loused this up but good
If  can trust my eyes, and  think can, Susie knows all about your dirty work
(shrugging) Can't hurt
(incredulously) Can't hurt
had to get him back his job
(smugly) like that, too
(closer, faster) Look,
, we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion
We're going great, but please play it my way
cased this kid
Know his ins and outs
He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze
Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze
- You know,
- the porcupine bit - needles
But it's too late
got him back the job
(impatiently) No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor
The manager yes, but not the boy
pause
Hunsecker renumerates
Well he's got her in a tizzy, 'll tell you that
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz
And who's feet is she on now
Presumably yours
(a hasty addition) That's according to St
Dallas
What's this boy got that Susie likes
Integrity - acute, like indigestion
What does that mean - integrity
(repeating as before) pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match
(grinning) It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth
never thought 'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity"
Hunsecker gives him certain slow begrudging admiration: Full of beans, ain't you
But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now
(grins; confidently) Calculated risk
Only we happen to know,
, that you like me
'm your star pupil --  reflect back to you your own talent
Hunsecker permits himself a faint smile
Burton is approaching with script in hand
wouldn't like to take a bite of you; you're a cookie full of arsenic
Sidney smirks
He turns away and goes off towards the auditorium in the background
- Frank 'Angelo pays a taxi out of which he and Steve have just emerged
Frank turns towards the boy, resuming a conversation as they stroll across the sidewalk towards the entrance of the theatre
(depressed) still think he's responsible for the smear
' Not that 'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years
(gently) Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives
guess you're right, but - Steve completes the sentence with a slow shake of the head; compromise is a gesture which he finds very difficult
' 'Angelo studies the boy with a paternal affection
' Steve, sometimes it's better not to look at your own honesty; but to look the other man in the face
Not because you're my meal ticket - which you are - but because  like you and the boys, please take my advice: we - 'Angelo stops, halted by an expression which he sees in Steve's face
He is looking through the glass doors of the  Theatre, no longer listening to 'Angelo's words; his face has hardened in anger
From Steve's viewpoint
Sidney has come out of the curtained entrance to the auditorium
to include Steve in foreground
With a movement that suggests his annoyance at discovering Sidney present, Steve jerks open the glass door and moves in
Susan is waiting in the foyer
She is standing in a position where she has not been able to see Steve until he enters; now she moves forward to greet him
As soon as she is near him, she speaks in a quiet, urgent manner: (in an undertone) Steve, before we go in - 'd like to
But she, too, is halted as Steve lays a hand on her arm
Seeing his look over her shoulder, she turns
He is already strolling forward to join them with him to include Susie, Steve and 'Angelo
Hey, Susie - This is a real surprise -- not one but three
's just finishing up his rehearsal
Hunsecker comes forward to the front of the stage looking towards
, , ' In the group that comes down the aisle of the empty theatre
He studies them, then calls out: Looks like a wedding
Hunsecker back to  in foreground; he begins to whistle The Wedding March to the rhythm of Steve and Susan's walk
He breaks the rhythm of his stride, his face rigid
He descends to meet them; his manner is full of welcome
Susan nervously makes the introduction - Steve is nervous; 'Angelo hangs behind warily; Sidney is in background
Steve, you remember my brother
& (together) Of course
Steve shakes the hand that the smiling Hunsecker gives
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble
You've been very kind about it, Mr
Hunsecker
Give Susie credit for that
took her word that there was nothing to the smear
Matter of fact, 'll have my say about smears on the show today
That's why 'd like personal assurance, too
(quietly) Mr
Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear
You have my sincere word
(nodding judicially) 'll by that, son
Now, you owe a favor
(pausing; to Susan) Be good to my kid sister
(solemnly) Yeah, she's had a peck of trouble for a kid
Hunsecker flicks a look at Sidney
No one else, warier by the minute, knows what to say
Hunsecker purrs onward: Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets
But in her heart of hearts  imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way
Now, what about , son
Not just tom-catting around
hope
(quickly) , Steve isn't
Hunsecker cuts her off with lazy good nature: Take it easy, Susie
He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern
Would you, son
(pausing, quietly) No,  wouldn't
(nodding) Serious as a deacon
like it like your style, son
In a world of old rags and bones,  like it
For instance, take Sidney
Hunsecker crosses toward Sidney
(') If Sidney got anywhere near Susie 'd break a bat over Sidney's head
(smiling faintly) Sidney lives so much in a moral twilight that, when  said you were coming here, he predicted disaster
You wouldn't take my favor -- you'd chew up the job, he said, and spit it right back in my face
(sniffing) Any truth in that
', Steve is thrown for a loss momentarily; Frank steps in
' No, Mr
Hunsecker, and if  can amplify -- (motionless) Don't amplify
', ' Steve wantsa thank you for this favor
He -- (provocatively) Frank, you don't listen
just told you to shut your mouth
(hotly) Don't you think it's about time you shut yours
Who are you to tell a man like Frank 'Angelo to shut up
' (warningly) Steve, that isn't important -- But Steve, on a heated rip, has turned to Hunsecker: Does he have to be here in our hair
Why, has he bothered you before
, ' Is it news to you
Son, lots of people tell me 'm a gifted man, but  still can't see around corners
(tolerantly) Just exactly what are you so hot about
(waiting) mean,  know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but -- (impatiently) Nuts
'm not here as an artist
'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie
(with ironic smirk) Well, just be careful you don't knock her down, huh
Steve stops dead
Then, strangely and dangerously, he picks up Hunsecker's smile
On each man's face the smile broadens and grows up into a chuckle from each; but the meanness still flickers around Hunsecker's mouth
Steve is out of the net
(affably) Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill
Just give us the punch line
(agreeably) No punch line
Maybe  was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco
, ' (innocently) He's here, isn't he
Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven
Even Hunsecker smiles
Sidney likes neither the ridicule or the turn of events
He moves quickly past
, , ' Sidney comes round the row of theatre seats to attack Steve
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- 'll just lay it on the line
What about that big rumpus in my office today
You were there, Frank
Where, according to St
Dallas,
was responsible for the Elwell smear
Don't go wild, Sidney
Wild
Take a look at them and see who's wild
Playing along nicely, Hunsecker looks at Steve and Frank and slowly removes his arm from Susan; he pauses before asking Dallas: What about that
' (uneasily) Steve was excited
he didn't mean it exactly the way it's stated here
(to Steve) How did you mean it
What he likes to---
,  don't want to say--- With a roar Hunsecker takes them both out of play; he stands up
, , ' Hunsecker enters from behind
Both of you keep quiet
(to Sidney) You've made more damage here in one minute than a plague of locusts
If you're tired, Susie, sit down--- this needs investigation
(to Steve, quieter) How did you mean it
(waiting) Come on, let's go
Let's go
Steve is cornered, the other completely out of play
He pauses: don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics
Who's the injured party here, you
(with contempt) Right now you're in no position to ask questions
And your snide remarks--- (stronger) Wait a minute,  haven't handed over punishing privileges to you Put the whip down and  might respect what you're saying
Switching his leonine tail, Hunsecker looks broodingly at Susie
Frank says one beseeching word, "Steve
", but no one hears him
Susie, did you know about this accusation
(mutely) No
(abruptly) Before you leave, son, 'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here
(balefully) Or will  be hearing next that don't even have my sister's welfare at heart
Steve hesitates defensively but can't resist a small smile; he moves nearer to Susan
Mr
Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels
(unturning) You hear that, Susie
(to Steve) Continue please
(shaking his head) 'm afraid  can't cope with them
Susan in foreground, Steve, Hunsecker and Sidney beyond
(') (simply) You're too shrewd for me so 'll just be honest
Susie and  love each other, if 'm not mistaken, and we want to get married
Hunsecker pauses; Sidney throws in a stage whisper: Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say
(sardonically) That's stout of you, Dallas, but Susie may not care to air her dismal views in public
Steve walks to Susie, trying to lift her with his hopes and air of gentle urging and support
Susie
She stares at the floor
Hunsecker doesn't like the drift of things; his mouth tightens and he speaks to Susan with veiled warning: Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks
Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear
Those "dears" sound like daggers
May  suggest that you stop her to speak
May  lift my eyebrows
What is this
What are you trying to do
(strongly) 'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you
But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak
Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt
Suddenly Susan lets loose, with restrained nervous energy; she is near to tears
Steve, if only for my sake,  want this stopped
And the same goes for you, too,
He interjects
(contritely) Susie, 'm sorry if--- (bitterly) Sometimes  think  men are fools
Restraining tears, she runs up the steps to the stage
, Steve looks after her
Sidney watches intently
Hunsecker's smile is frostily taunting: You see, Dallas, a plague on both our houses
(then) We may have to call this game on account of darkness
Steve turns a blank-eyed stare at him
Tension gone, a slow mumbling fatigue has set in
Hunsecker plays it light: If looks could kill, 'm dead
(slowly) No,  don't care about you -- you're fantastic
My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie
and how to undo what you've done to her
(smiling) And what have  done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately
Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly
(stung) Why
Because  don't like the way you toy with human lives
- Your contempt and malice
Because won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie
You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory
but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr
Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace
(blandly) Son,  don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns
So suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day
He turns and stares away, but Steve stops him with--- But my day with Susie isn't over yet and-- (cold) Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell
Hunsecker comes up the steps from the auditorium, Sidney following closely behind
In background, beyond, Steve and 'Angelo are walking up the aisle to the exit on Sidney and Hunsecker
Hunsecker's face is rigid
Sidney, close at his elbow, whispers: (softly) You did it,
, you did it good
Sidney is full of confidence
But Hunsecker barely hears him (Hunsecker has been hurt very deeply by the boy's attack; in particular, by the appalling fear that what Steve has said is the kind of thing which Susan may also secretly believe
) Susan is still standing in the wings
Mary is with her, obviously sympathetic
The girl is drying her eyes with Kleenex, and Mary glances at her employer with a look of reproach
Hunsecker walks round the table, obviously trying to approach Susan; seeing this, Susan turns away and moves further from him
Hunsecker stops
There is some emotion in his face as he looks towards the girl
More gently, he moves forward past
Sensing the approach of Hunsecker behind her, she moves away again; she is still crying, but is trying to recover
Presently Hunsecker approaches her again
He speaks very gently, soothingly, comforting
(softly) You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks
(a small voice) No
'm going home
Hunsecker again tries to come nearer to her
Want Sidney to drive you over
Ignoring the shake of her head, he calls to Sidney
Drive Susie home
Again we see some emotion in his face as he studies the girl
His eyes flick towards the stage behind him where Sidney stands watching
He moves gently forward and then speaks in a quiet voice which reveals how desperately he needs her reassurance: Susie
'd have to take it very much amiss if you ever saw that boy again
After a pause, she turns towards him; she looks him straight in the face
(levelly) 'll never see him again
He seems to take this as a gesture of forgiveness from her
Now he touches her
His need for her is apparent; he tries to reach her, tries to find an excuse to embrace her
She submits to this very passively
We see the effort with which she is controlling herself
Satisfied with this crumb of affection from his sister, Hunsecker lets her go
Susan moves away, still avoiding his eyes
Then she goes off towards the steps down into the auditorium
Sidney looks at Hunsecker, then after Susan and follows her
He goes back to Mary and the script
He instructs her: Call Van Cleve
Tell him he was right
Tell him  said the Dallas boys are not worthy of his club
Poring over the typewritten pages, he senses Mary's eyes on him
He speaks to her quietly without raising his head and there is still an undertone of feeling in his voice: (without looking up) Mary
for Susie's own good
don't give her misplaced sympathy
Mary says nothing
Hunsecker gathers his papers and with a visible effort to resume his public personality turns towards the machinery of the television broadcast in background
Susan crosses towards the doors out onto the street
Sidney comes behind her, watchful as he overtakes her near the doors
He goes past her to open the door for her
'll get you a cab
Susan stops dead
(coldly) Get away from me
She goes out into the street
Beyond, we see a crushing cab
Hesitating, Sidney adds: asked me to drive you over and - But Susan has already moved out of shot, hurrying across the sidewalk to hail the taxi
Uncertain what to do, whether to follow her or not, he moves after her
She has already opened the door of the taxi
She turns to see Sidney come up behind her
As he enters , she repeats: told you to leave
don't know if Steve'll ever talk to me again and 'm ready to blame it all on you
She starts to get into the cab
Alert, he moves to detain her (anxious to know exactly the extent of her suspicion
) Susie
As Sidney steps up, he grasps at the door of the taxi, trying to hold it open, but Susan pulls it shut, catching his fingers in the door
Sidney steps back in pain
It drives off down Sixth Avenue
Nursing the injury to his hand, he looks after the disappearing taxi
As he recovers from the pain, his expression slowly changes to one of thoughtful appraisal
(Susan's suspicions maybe of less importance than some other considerations
) : - Hunsecker and Sidney are washing in adjoining basins
Coat off, the former is in one of his punitive moods of silence
Sidney, despite his throbbing, bandaged finger, is feeling satisfied and self-confident
He hums quietly
Hunsecker throws him annoyed side-glances, but Sidney refuses to "catch on"
The following dialogue is spaced between the washing, the drying and hair-combing
So that's what "integrity" looks like
Well, 'm always willing to learn
(later) How is that slob, 'Angelo, your uncle
Sidney no longer hums; after a moment, he answers
My mother's side--her brother
That reminds me,
, Susie looks run down
She can stand a vacation and so can you
People say, "Oh, the great
, he's made of iron
", but you can use a rest, guy
Sidney's cheerfulness annoys Hunsecker
What are you so chipper about
If put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard
(smiling) But not for anything  did today
Sidney,  know human nature
Susie lied to me - she'll see that boy again
Hunsecker moves out of shot
You're right,
- she won't give him up, but it doesn't matter
Because the real "money ball" is the boy, not Susan
And if -- Hearing the sound of the door, Sidney turns sharply to discover that Hunsecker has gone out
Sidney, quickly, finishing the brushing of his hair, follows
- "21" Two waiters are fussing over Hunsecker's table at which places are already set for Sidney and Hunsecker
Matre d' hands him an envelope as he passes
' Mr
Hunsecker this was to be delivered to you personally - When the columnist comes up to the table, the waiters quickly pull out the table for him
Sidney comes to join him; Sidney gets some attention, but considerably less
These drinks are warm
You said you like to have them on your table
What are you a critic
'll change -- Forget it
(to Sidney) The real money ball is the boy
Yeah, the boy
we're on the verge of a farce, a real farce
As  see it, if Susie had stood behind him today he might have proved a threat
But since primarily he's wedded to his work, he's not going to be able to take it
waiter shifts the position of the salad dish at Hunsecker's elbow
(to waiter) Stop tinkering, pal - that horse radish won't jump a fence
The waiter retreats rapidly
In brief,
, it's all over because any hour now the boy will give her up
Is it a farce or not
Delicately salting his oysters, Hunsecker looks obliquely at Sidney
This syrup you're giving out, Sidney, you pour over waffles, not Hunsecker
What do you mean that lousy kid will give up my sister
Hunsecker, with a casual gesture, tugs lightly at the end of Sidney's tie
Hunsecker's gesture is playful, but it inflicts great injury to Sidney's dignity; Sidney cannot bear to be touched; he finds this liberty on
's part as intolerable as anything he has experienced, and only with great difficulty controls himself
The   Sidney
Hunsecker continues: Are you listening
(warily) How does it matter who's sister
The main thing, they're through and - From Sidney's viewpoint
Without turning, Hunsecker interrupts: Am  supposed to forget how that boy talked to me today
Sidney senses a warning in Hunsecker's manner
He protests: , is he worthy of a second glance from a man like you
Is he, mean
From Sidney's viewpoint
Pausing during the process of eating, Hunsecker reaches into an inside pocket
Brief epitaph: "The boy was talking when he should have been listening
" (then) Bite on this
to include Sidney as Hunsecker tosses in front of him an envelope
Sidney opens it, extracts two steamship tickets
Steamship tickets
(as he eats) For the next sailing of the Mary
Susan's run down - she's never been abroad and as you so cogently put it, 'm not made of iron
Sidney slowly pushes the envelope back to Hunsecker, who leaves it lying on the table before him
That's good
Now that louse is outa Susie's hair for good
He has an instinct to laugh; but something tells him not to
As Sidney makes no response, Hunsecker slowly, carefully continues in a voice which is dangerously soft: want that boy taken apart
Hunsecker onto Sidney
Sidney puts down his fork
He sees now that the issue is serious and must be faced
(seriously) Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms
Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow
(interjecting quietly) She knows now
(quickly) Why give her real proof
You nearly ruined her with her first husband - and you were right, , - but she almost followed him out the window
What do you want - a chronic invalid
He wants no advice from Sidney
He interrupts with quiet savagery
know how to handle Susie
You just handle the boy, Sidney
(scribbles on scratch pad) preferably tonight
(pushes pad across to Sidney) Hunsecker onto Sidney
Sidney feels sick
Why, what's tomorrow - a holiday
as Sidney picks scratch pad up
We can read two words: "Get Kello"
think 'll go home - maybe  left my sense of humor in another suit
Hunsecker finishes eating
During the ensuing speech, which he begins quietly and sensibly, Hunsecker's venomous feelings are unexpectedly betrayed
You've got that God-given brain - learn to use it
Do you think it's a personal matter with me, this boy
Are you telling me  see things in terms of personal pique
Don't you see that today that boy wiped his feet on the choice, on the predilections of sixty million men and women of the greatest country in the world
If you had any morals yourself, you would understand the immorality of that boy's stand today
It was not me he criticized - it was my readers
to include Sidney
Hunsecker manages to control himself; he reaches with nervous fingers toward his scribbling pad
Sidney's face has tightened
He has begun now to realize the extent of this man's megalomania
After a moment he says: 'm leaving,
Sidney onto Hunsecker
(a quiet warning) Don't remove the gangplank, Sidney; you may wanna get back on board
Sidney feels the chill of despair upon him
This crab gumbo - terrific
Hunsecker onto Sidney
waiter has come to serve the next course
Hunsecker appears relaxed, but Sidney is sightlessly staring at the piece of paper in his hand
He speaks with a quaver in his voice, for he has worked hard to make a life which is now ready to relinquish: , it's one thing to wear your dog collar
but when it gets to be a noose
'd rather have my freedom
The man in jail is always for freedom
Sidney begins to get up from the table
(as he rises) Except, if you'll excuse me, 'm not in jail
Hunsecker looks up at Sidney
From Sidney's viewpoint
(easily) Sure you're in jail, Sidney
You're a prisoner of your own fears, of your own greed and ambition; you're in jail
From Hunsecker's viewpoint
If you're trying to - He leans over Hunsecker and the    to include Hunsecker in f
g
(interrupting) You, little boy, don't know who you are
Talking around corners with the big shots, ten dollar dinners - fourteen suits and cashmere coats - you tell yourself ' who you are
Later you won't know who you are without a penthouse on upper Park
But underneath it all, ratting around from day to day, you know who you are
You're a fearful, ignorant nobody - a poor wop kid from the slums of Philly - hoping nobody else finds it out
He knows the truth of what is said
But he takes refuge in quiet retaliation: little hunch occurs to me - you have just painted a self-portrait
You know who  are because you scare people - that's what you've got against this boy
He - Hunsecker is prepared to give it out, but not take it
(cutting in) told you what  want you to do tonight
He looks down on Hunsecker, leans over the table
You're blind, Mr
Magoo
This is a crossroads for me
won't get Kello
Not for a life-time pass to the Polo Grounds
Not if you serve me Ingrid Bergman on a plate
has   to include Hunsecker, whose attention has returned to his food
(over patient) Sidney,  told you - (continuing) ,  swear to you on my mother's life,  won't do it
(he leans even closer) If you gave me your wouldn't do a thing like that
But as he speaks the last words, Sidney's voice falters because he has glanced down at the table
We see that an idea has entered his head - an idea that takes the wind out of his indignation
His eyes lift rapidly to Hunsecker's face
(delicately touching the envelope) And who do you think writes the column while Susie and  are away for three months
He is quite speechless
Over scene Hunsecker's voice: (
) (continuing) The man in the moon
across Sidney again onto Hunsecker
Hunsecker leans back, looks at Sidney
Seeing that Sidney has accepted the proposition, he smiles
(softly) Thank you, Sidney
In a pleasantly affable way, he leans across the table to tap the hand with which Sidney is leaning on the table
And, Sidney, 'll have that piece of paper back
Helplessly, Sidney unclenches a fist and reveals the slip of paper which he had meant to keep
Hunsecker takes it
With his eyes on Sidney, he slowly tears it up
: - 'Angelo is buying a cigar at the counter
He turns as Steve opens the door of one of the booths and comes out
Steve is in a gloomy, irksome mood; 'Angelo is sympathetic and fatherly
She'll be down in a minute
with them as they come out into the hallway
They move towards the side entrance, away from the elevators
' What does she wanna see you about
The boy shrugs impatiently
She didn't say
Some passersby come down the hall and enter a waiting elevator, barely glancing at 'Angelo and the boy
'Angelo feels uneasy
' could think of better places to meet her, instead of here
He lives on the whole top floor
(carelessly) doubt that it matters any more
' He addresses Steve soberly
' Steve
You made a very dangerous enemy of him today
Matter of fact, 'm very glad we got the tour ahead
If 'm any judge, you hurt him today where he lives
He won't forget it and he won't forgive
' Steve is silent
He hears the sound of the elevator door opening and turns
Susan comes out of the elevator, the one farthest from them, and looks around
(as she comes forward to join them) Good evening, Mr
'Angelo
'Angelo acknowledges her greeting, touches his hat and retires tactfully
Susan faces Steve
It's an awkward meeting
Each does not know where the other stands
She has thrown her fur coat about her shoulders like a cloak; it will keep slipping off
He is faintly embittered, a little hurt and baffled, but he is sympathetic; he is involved and concerned
- Hello, Steve
'm glad you could come
Why did you call me
Would you buy me a cup of coffee
In there
Susan nods in the direction of the door into the little cafe
Sure
As he walks with her towards the cafe: We're on our way to Robard's for a benefit
've only got five minutes
As they enter the cafe, the Counterman looks up from counting the day's take at the far end
Too late for service
Just two cups of java
(with a twinkle) We serve here only moka coffee
(smiling faintly) Make it moke
The Counterman goes to the urn for the coffee
closer angle
They talk in quiet undertones
Steve waits for her to speak first; she starts slowly, hesitantly, with difficulty: Steve
what you tried to do today
you tried to take me up on a high mountain
couldn't go all the way
failed you
(a pause) Will you forgive me
(then) Have  lost you, Steve
Have
Well, maybe  was wrong, too
But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did
(quietly, to the point) But you didn't do much about it, Susie
You walked out, and there was
solo
and not too good at that
just didn't think that  could antagonize him, Steve -- for sake,  mean
Susie,  was there for  sake, too
But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa
By the way,  think your brother was completely responsible for the smears
This accusation is made lightly, in passing
But Susan reacts to it, trying to interject: Steve,
(overriding her) But  don't care about that now
He knew what he was doing today
He was laying down the conditions under which he  consent to our marriage - if  would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney couldn't do that, Susie
After a pause, she says: You're saying goodbye, aren't you
Steve flares up
No
'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother
(wrenched) But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time
was born only yesterday
(pausing, softer) told your brother  couldn't be his accomplice
can't be yours either, Susie, and encourage him to go on pulverizing you
know what type - he's my old man all over again
Susan, pathetically despairing, fingers the handle of her coffee cup, which she has not touched
The coat slips from her shoulders
Steve stoops to pick it up, replaces it on her shoulders
This beautiful coat is more than just a coat
hate it
It's a mink straight-jacket
Susan turns to him
She is deflated, lacking all will power
(drooping) Steve,  feel exhausted
what do you want me to do
(not sure of himself) Not what you're doing now
At least don't ask me - don't ask him
You're fighting for your life
What do  want to do
(pausing, woodenly) You are saying goodbye, aren't you
He reacts vigorously, protesting: (impatiently) That's fish four days old can't buy it, Susie
Right out of that mouth  love, like you're a ventriloquist's dummy, your is saying goodbye
Gee
you want me to be honest, don't you
despairing cry: No, Steve,  don't
don't
Not if it  me  don't
It takes her a moment to recover
When she does so, she gets up, leaving the counter
(without luster) Let's not talk any more
you have to go
She moves towards the exit into the hallway; he follows
'Angelo is waiting for them
Silently they come up to join him, very depressed
Susan looks towards 'Angelo, speaks a little pathetically: Goodbye, Mr
'Angelo
Take care of Steve
' (softly) will, Miss Hunsecker
He walks a little way down the corridor, again leaving them alone
She smiles at him, trying to smile, trying to make a joke
Say something funny
Mr
Hasenfeffer
Steve steps to her quickly, kisses her
Then he turns and swiftly walks off down the corridor without a backward glance
He goes past 'Angelo, who walks quietly after him towards the exit in background
She remains just in the attitude in which he left her
- Steve comes out of the door, pauses without looking back
'Angelo comes up behind him
(after a moment) Look back, Frank, see if she's still standing there
'Angelo looks discreetly over his shoulder
From 'Angelo's point of view
She is still standing where Steve left her
' 'Angelo turns back to Steve
' Still there
Steve, still without looking back, walks up the street; ' (with sympathy) Not that  don't like her - she's a very lovely person, but who can tell
year from now you might thank your stars that it turned out this way
(changing the subject) By the way, Robard said that
Steve, his manner full of pain, stops
Frank,  don't want to make the benefit
They'll be jammin' all night, and the way  feel -- 'd like to be alone -- 'd like just to walk and walk and never come back
'Angelo takes him firmly by the arm
' No
don't leave you alone on a night like this
And, anyway, you promised
Steve looks at him, knowing that he can never shake off the devoted Frank; he shrugs
They walk past
'  - The heavy brass doors of the elevator slide open and the Elevator Man pulls open the grille
Susan, still in the mood in which Steve left her, stands in the elevator for a moment before she realizes that she has reached the top floor
As she walks out, the Elevator Man looks at her anxiously
with Susan towards the door to the apartment
Susan fumbles for her key
' The apartment is dark as Susan enters
She does not switch on the lights
She walks through the shadows of the big room, which has a grim and menacing atmosphere
She kicks off her shoes and, hugging the coat about her for warmth walks to the glass windows of the terrace
After a moment she opens them and steps out
- Susan walks across the terrace
At this height the wind is very strong
with the girl, emphasizing the dizzying panorama of New York at night
The girl's manner is strange; she moves as if under compulsion, a sleepwalker
When she reaches the stone parapet, she leans against it with her body slumped, still hugging the fur coat as if it were some protection against her misery
- Vertically downward
From Susan's point of view
The stone sidewalks of Broadway are a terrifying distance below
An angle, shooting sharply upwards against the night sky
Wind blows the girl's hair, as she looks fixedly downwards
Her face is blank, expressionless
(For a moment we may fear for her, afraid that she may have suicide in mind
) But presently she lifts her head looking towards the horizon
: '  - the entrance to Robard's Club, framing the outline of the bridge in sky in background
From inside comes the sound of music -- the Quintet
The taxi drives up; Sidney gets out; he glances at his wristwatch, looks around and then makes his way into the club
'  - Steve Dallas' Quintet on the stand
the group in foreground,  towards the entrance way
'  - Sidney has come in through the entrance
He is taking off his overcoat
He moves forward past the hat check room on the left, approaching the recess in which several music cases are stacked beside a coat rack on which the musicians' overcoats are hung
As he hangs up his coat, Sidney identifies the other coat, a black and white check raglan which he (and we) saw Steve wearing when he visited Hunsecker at the  Studio
The coat appears to have some significance for him; Sidney is under tension
waiter, carrying a carton of beer cans, comes out of the doorway just behind Sidney, moving between him and the overcoat
Thus interrupted, Sidney turns away
'  - Robard is standing at the bar, surrounded by a group of his cronies
Drink is flowing and there is a sentimental mood of celebration
As Sidney arrives at the bar, ordering a drink, ' is seen coming from the interior of the club where Dallas and the Quintet can be seen playing; 'Angelo accosts Robard: ' Lew, Steve don't feel too good
(interjecting) 'm sorry to hear it
shoots past 'Angelo and Robard in f
g
towards Sidney, who overhears: ' (continuing) So, if you don't mind, he'll leave after this set
In b
g
, Sidney sets down his drink, reacting to this information
Robard clamps 'Angelo on the shoulder, reassuring him with warm emphasis: like that boy, Frank
Anything he does is okay with me
Sidney, thinking rapidly, leaves the bar, moving unobtrusively but purposefully towards a telephone booth
He enters and closes the door
Shooting through the glass panel we see Sidney dialing
His manner is urgent
: '  - long shot of the club exterior
different musical number is now being played in the interior
( )
black car comes swiftly under the bridge, turns into the little square opposite the club, braking sharply
As the car comes to a stop,  shoots across the hood onto the windshield where we see the insignia:
The occupants of the car are not visible
/
' Sidney lingers near the doorway of the club
He is looking across the square towards the car which can be seen in b
g
Now he turns and walks towards the coat rack,  tracking with him
He takes his own coat and, as he thrusts his arm into the sleeve, contrives neatly to slip some unseen object into the pocket of Steve's overcoat;  notes the gesture, but only very briefly
Overscene a voice addresses Sidney: ' (
) Hey
As he turns in swift apprehension, we note the moment of panic in his face
shoots past Sidney in foreground towards 'Angelo who advances on Sidney
'Angelo's manner is unfriendly; for an instant we feel, like Sidney, that 'Angelo may have seen Sidney tampering with Steve's coat, but then we are reassured as 'Angelo, deliberately using Sidney's surname, says: ' (continuing) Mr
Falco
hate to give you this satisfaction - they broke it off tonight for good
Shooting across 'Angelo onto Sidney, who now relaxes, his fears ungrounded
' (continuing) Tell that to Hunsecker - tell him we agree - he's a big man - he wins all the marbles
As 'Angelo moves away again Sidney looks after him
Once more his face goes tense
(He asks himself, does this development - which he himself anticipated - change the situation
) He turns away, moving out of shot
moves with Sidney as he walks towards the doorway
There he hesitates again; he looks back into the club
From Sidney's viewpoint
of Steve on the bandstand
deliberately towards the coatrack in f
g
group of newly arrived musicians walk into the shot, setting down their instrument cases and starting to hang up their coats
(Clearly, Sidney could not now return to the coat rack - even if he decided that he did want to undo his handiwork
) , shooting out across the square, frames Sidney in f
g
Facing the inevitable, Sidney turns away, walks across the sidewalk
On the other side of the square the headlamps of the car blink twice
Sidney walks towards it
big man gets out of the seat next to the driver
As he comes round the hood of the car, the headlamps of a passing truck illuminate him, identifying as he walks to meet Sidney
Kello pauses as Sidney comes up to him, asks affably: What's all the rush
You said three o'clock
(glancing back towards club) He's leaving early
After this "set"
He'll be out in a couple of minutes
They wait for a moment, listening to the sound of the music in the distance
It is a blues number ( ) Kello hums nonchalantly; Sidney glances at him with irritation, finding something gruesome in his relaxed manner
There are two plainclothes policemen inside, one at the wheel, the other in the back seat
The latter leans forward to ask the former: 1ST What's this deal tonight
(the 2nd policeman) One of the lieutenant's "surprise parties",  think
Murph's tone shows obvious repugnance
The 1st Policeman broods for a moment; he adds in a quiet, but viciously resentful manner: 1ST One of these days 'd like to turn in my badge and tangle with "" myself - he's no good
Sidney, increasingly uncomfortable, turns to Kello
Can't you wait up the block
It's not going to look so good, right in front of the club
To Kello this is a great joke
He laughs, enjoying Sidney's uneasiness
He begins to "cat and mouse" Sidney
(heavily humorous) It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip
(interjecting) - He's got them on him
(solemnly nodding his approval) And he's got them on him appreciate a thing like that - appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city
Sidney, annoyed at this sarcasm, moves past Kello, not deigning to respond
As he goes by, Kello grasps him forcibly by the arm
What's your hurry, Snooks
to  towards the car out of which emerges a second detective
(revolted) Take your hands off, Kello
Kello, holding Sidney, turns towards the second detective in background
Murph, how do you like this face
Why, 'll be darned -- it's melting
Something got you scared, Sidney
Listen, rectify me a certain thing
Wasn't you kidding, Snooks, when you told
was fat
Sidney jerks his arm away, rapidly retreats a few yards, a safe distance from Kello
with him to the bottom of the steps
Sleep in peace, Kello -- you're skinny -- but
says you sweat
Sidney in foreground, Kello and Murph beyond
Kello laughs; but obviously he would like to be nearer to Sidney
Perhaps to detain Sidney, Kello drawls: Is that a fact
He's a dilly, ain't he
By the by, what did he have against this boy
He goes out with girls
Well, 'll be darned
And what does
think he  do
(impudently) Go out with  girls
He moves forward a little
(softly now) get the peculiar impression, Snooks, that you don't like me
Could  be wrong
He turns swiftly and goes up the stairs out of Kello's reach
(as he goes) You could be right, you fat slob
From half-way up the stairs
Sidney comes up the steps two at a time
Kello and Murphy are seen beyond
(with a guffaw) Come back here, Sidney
wanna chastise you
Sidney reaches the top
He comes along the pedestrian walk up to , slowing down he turns across the rail and looks down towards the square
to take in the scene in  : Sidney in foreground, the police car and detectives below, the entrance to Robard's across the square
Sidney waits
In the distance we can hear the music of Dallas' last number coming to an end
' The last bars of the number
Enthusiastic applause
He responds to the ovation, nicely but a little wearily
He gets down off the stand
There is too much noise to hear his parting words to his fellow musicians, but it is clear that he is urging them to stay without him
He walks off towards the entrance to the club
' 'Angelo leaves the bar, in search of Steve
He sees
/
'  - Steve is putting his guitar away in the case, collecting his overcoat
In this gesture he is arrested by the sound of 'Angelo's voice over scene
' (
) (urgently) Steve
Steve, mildly startled, looks up
Shooting into the club
'Angelo comes forward from the bar
He is a little drunk, a little emotional
He waddles toward Steve, then takes the white carnation out of his buttonhole and puts it in the buttonhole of Steve's coat, saying: ' (fondly) Press this in your friendship book
Love is a crooked thing, friendship not
(then, sheepishly) You see, it comes out in the wash of a few drinks -- 'm a very sentimental guy
' Steve is touched
like it that way, Frank
don't change
He picks up his guitar case and makes for the door
'Angelo goes a few paces with him,
Then it moves past 'Angelo, following Steve out onto the sidewalk, where he stands under the light of the club framed against the dark background of the square
from the small figure of Steve to include Sidney big in foreground
Below him Kello and Murph turn towards the club
downward from Sidney's viewpoint
Kello turns deliberately to look at the bridge above
Sidney sees Kello's look; he nods deliberately
Below him we see Kello and Murphy move swiftly to get into the car
Sidney, as if shrinking from a sight from which he doesn't wish to witness, draws back from the balustrade
He turns and begins to walk towards
upwards at the car, the stairs to the bridge in background
As the doors of the car slam, it starts to move forward and, abruptly, its headlamps are switched on, glaring into the lens
'  - Steve, concerned only with his only melancholy thoughts, walks down the sidewalk under the bridge
The car headlamps illuminate him in their glare as they move across him
Steve, without undue, interest, glances back but continues on his way
eastward towards the silhouette of the bridge
The Police Car turns as it comes out of the square under the bridge towards
It moves slowly; again its headlamps flare into the lens
includes Steve in foreground
Behind him the Police Car slows down at the curb; it barely stops as Kello slips out of the off-side door; then the car moves forward along the curb leaving him behind Steve
As the car goes out of picture past , Kello strolls across the sidewalk, following Steve
Steve, looking past , notices
toward 2nd Avenue
The Police Car slows down again at the curb and Murph gets out of it, turning to face Steve
Steve, seeing the man ahead of him, notes something slightly menacing in his manner and slows down in his walk
Then, instinctively, he realizes that there is a second man behind him, turns to look at Kello
Kello approaches
Hey, fella
and  on Steve
In his face we see a growing sense of something wrong
' Loud noise, Chico Hamilton on the drums
Another jump cut in the sound track
Silence
It is an empty saloon, occupied only by a solitary drinker at one end of the long bar, nursing a beer, and by the bartender who is making out a dope sheet
Sidney enters, strides to the bar and throws down a jangling half dollar
bunch of nickels, mister
While the change is made, Sidney stands with cocked head, listening in reality or imagination to what is happening down the street
As the barman supplies the change, Sidney goes to the juke box and loads it with nickels saying over his shoulder: double Johnny Walker Black
Or whatever you got
Scotch
Sidney puts both hands on the juke box as if leaning on it
With a click, drop and whirl, the music box comes to life; music blares out
Pausing a moment, Sidney turns back toward the bar
He reaches for his drink, downs it
He is shivering
'  - Once more, an abrupt sound transition: the jam session at full blast
the musicians in foreground, but moves away from them towards the entrance in background
Near the doorway there is some activity; an attendant beckons to Robard who is drinking with 'Angelo
Robard moves toward the entrance
/
'  - on 'Angelo at the bar
He looks off after Robard
There is little concern in his face, but as he watches, curiosity grows
He strolls out after the proprietor
with him as 'Angelo comes to join the little mob of two or three people on the sidewalk
,   now   2nd Avenue
Beyond the bridge we can see the Police Car
Kello and Murphy are beside one of the open doors (into which Steve has been carried)
Murphy turns back, walks a few paces across the sidewalk and picks up Steve's music case, which he carries back to the Squad Car
He gets in and the car drives off
Hey, Robard, somebody just picked up one of your boys
What sa -- Wha -- 'Angelo's face shows a bewildered astonishment and dismay as he turns back to the couple of people who are talking to Robard
'Angelo is a little befuddled with drink
He pushes towards Robard
' (dazed) Whatsa matter, Lou
(turning to 'Angelo) 'm trying to find out myself
They just picked up Steve
(blankly) Some fat guy
2ND cop, a couple of cops
They smeared him all over the lot
' He turns to look back towards the direction in which the Police Car has departed
He seems unable to comprehend what he has heard; but a slow and terrible fear is dawning on him
: Susan opens the door to discover Frank 'Angelo in lobby
He speaks at once: ' 'm looking for your brother
Is he home
No
(sensing the seriousness of his manner) Mr
'Angelo - is something wrong
'Angelo has no wish to become involved with the girl; he doesn't reply
' When does he usually gets in, your night-owl brother
Seldom before five
(again) What's the matter
Would you care to come in a minute
'Angelo backs away, shaking his head
' No
no
Thanks
He turns back to the elevator
Susan closes the door, but slowly; she is watching 'Angelo
'Angelo as he goes to the bell of the elevator and rings it
He remains in this position, waiting for the elevator, but now (believing himself to be alone) he leans his head against the wall and begins to weep, quietly
Surprisingly, Susan is abruptly at his elbow, she seizes him forcibly by the arm, demanding: (taut) Something's happened
To Steve
'Angelo, with his face contorted in grief and bitterness, can no longer refuse to answer her
' (in a broken voice) He's in the hospital
He's under arrest, too
They planted reefer cigarettes on him
in his overcoat pocket
Susan is becoming hysterical
(wildly) Where is he
want to go to him
'Angelo recovers his self control
There is force and authority in his voice as he insists: ' Miss Hunsecker, if you see him again they might
might kill him
Susan is sobered by his seriousness
(slowly) Who is "they"
' Don't ask foolish questions
(then) Tell your brother 'm a sensible man
He understands only two things - power-politics and homage - tell him  came tonight to pay homage
- ' The elevator door opens and Sidney steps out: He crosses to the door of the apartment, pushes the button
The bell is heard ringing inside
While he waits, Sidney produces a handkerchief, dabs his face, straightens his tie; clearly he is trying to sober up
He goes to the bell push to ring again
Now he notices something that had escaped him before: the door is not quite shut
He pushes it open
' From inside
Sidney hesitates, enters tentatively
The apartment appears empty
Only one light is lit; the place is eerie
Sidney closes the door, goes into the main living room, pans with him
Something chills him, he calls softly, "
" Sidney walks towards the study, there is nobody there either
He goes back towards the stairs to the upper floor; in doing so he repasses the door of Susan's bedroom, sees that it is half open, goes to look in
From Sidney's viewpoint
The bed has been slept in but is unoccupied
The room is empty
On the seat at the foot of the bed is a drawer that has been pulled out of the wardrobe; it contains a collection of miscellaneous objects, a snapshot album, letters, souvenirs, disarranged as if someone had been looking at them
He looks at the empty room, disturbed
The curtains of the window onto the terrace are blowing: the window is open
Sidney walks into shot form behind
He calls: Susan
Susan steps into the room from the terrace, confronting Sidney
She is dressed, wearing the fur coat over a skirt and blouse
Her manner is very strange; the effect of the drugs, no doubt
Sidney is very uncomfortable in her presence; Susan is the last person he wants to have conversation with
Where's
He retreats across the threshold of the bedroom, into the outer room
She walks forwards
He isn't here
Sidney stands back to let her pass
But he called and said
Susan comes out of the bedroom, walks past
No,  called
He studies the girl, says nothing
She walks listlessly across the room, moving like a somnambulist
Mr
'Angelo phoned about Steve went down to the hospital, but they wouldn't let me in
He promised to keep in touch with me - Mr
'Angelo,  mean
He watches her cautiously, not sure of how to deal with her
(carefully) It's all over town about Dallas
(moving towards her) How is he
Susan's expression is blank; her eyes are unseeing
He's
unconscious
There is a tone of great despair in her voice
Presently, she recovers,  eases back to include Sidney beyond
She glances at him
gave Steve up
(then) Why did you and
do it
Sidney looks at her, tensely
Her voice is so calm, so certain that Sidney finds it difficult to play-act innocence
He protests a little too loudly: Susie, if  get your meaning, you're pitching very wild balls
What - Susan interrupts, with a simplicity which is damaging
Don't bother to lie, Sidney
(moving away) don't care anymore
Sidney decides that it is wiser not to argue
He assumes a tolerant sympathy
He moves towards her
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day
Feeling sorry for yourself won't help
(shaking her head) 'm sorry about Steve, not myself
'm even sorry for my brother
To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family - (moving towards her again) Come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed
Now she turns to him
And 'm sorry for you, too, Sidney
You're going down with the ship
What ship
She walks past him, still aimlessly wandering about the room; then she turns back, indicates herself
ship
She studies Sidney
Don't you know how my brother will see you after tonight
You'll be the man who drove his little stainless sister to suicide
Shaken, Sidney decides to ridicule the implied threat
Honey, 'll just have to smile at that
He walks past
Sidney walks into shot, going past her on his way to the door
(as he goes) It's late and 'm going home
Susan, in foreground, remains quite still, says nothing
In background, Sidney slows down, his confidence failing him; he looks back at her
He can't go
Probably, she's bluffing
But he can't be certain
He is suddenly angry
He strides back towards her
Susie, whatever problems you have with
-  didn't invent them
What're you blaming me for
If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off
Like you
Yeah
Like me
don't choke on my own gall -  fight back
Let choke, not me
'm not a man, Sidney, 'm - know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength
So what do you pick such weak sisters for
Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops
could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love
(quickly) didn't do anything
but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic
She moves past him
He grips her, turning her around
Don't run away -  was always the man for you
'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what  say
Inside of six months - (helplessly) Please, Sidney,  can't stand this - Sidney and Susan in foreground
But it is now shooting towards the door of the apartment movement has included a figure at the other end of the big room
He is taking off his overcoat near the door of the apartment
We don't know how long he has been there, how much he has overheard
Without appearing to be consciously spying, Hunsecker is listening to Sidney's voice over scene
(over scene) Listen to me, lunatic
All your life you've been doing penance for crimes you never committed could change that, 'd teach you, 'd show you -
round with Hunsecker who strolls across the room, making his presence known
Sidney breaks off, drops his hands, releasing the girl
Susan turns towards Hunsecker
Hunsecker lays his briefcase and papers on the table
He addresses Susan without looking at her
Go to bed, Susie
It's late
Susan makes no move
Hunsecker glances at her, sees Sidney but treats Sidney as if he were invisible
(to Susan) What is he doing here
Susan walks towards Hunsecker
called him
Sidney moves forward also
(carefully) She was depressed - she heard about Dallas
Hunsecker still ignores his existence, he walks past Susan carrying his papers to the desk
Susan turns, watching him
("controlling" his feelings) That subject it might be better not to start me on
(angry) He's made all the papers tonight
Hunsecker studies the item in the paper
She is staring at her brother
Suddenly, she is unable to suffer his authoritative air; she goes to him; he ignores her
Childishly, she snatches the paper from his hand, throws it to the floor
He looks at her
Patiently, as with a hysterical infant, he stoops, recovers the paper
("mildly") Is there something you wanted to say
(as she does not answer, continuing with growing viciousness) 've put up with a lot of your guff, Susie, because you were a child
But you're a woman now and suspect, despite my best intentions, more than a bit of a slut
Her head comes up sharply at the insult
Hunsecker glances at Sidney, clearly reminding them of the compromising situation in which they were found
Sidney moves to answer
(quickly) , if you think - (cutting in) Don't explain, Sidney
It doesn't matter now
(continuing) Whose arms will  have to pry you out of next
Not that  don't think you didn't invite it
know that look of yours, that pose of being wronged - and how it arouses the crusading instinct in even a Sidney Falco - Hunsecker's rising tide of brutality is having some effect on Susan, and Sidney, fearing for her, tries to intervene
was trying to build her up, not tear her down - (viciously) Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt
(turning back to Susan) Let's call it quits, my dear
'd like it fine if you found another home
That means the front door is open
Pack your things, rent a moving van and
(pacing the room) And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage
You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men
Susan is staring sightlessly at the floor near Hunsecker's feet
After a moment she turns and moves to the door of her bedroom; her walk is a little unsteady; she goes inside, closes the door in Hunsecker's face
With the door closed, she leans against it as if afraid of falling
She gropes for the door handle, finds the key and turns it
- Hunsecker is studying the closed door
(to himself) Another crisis past
(walking away) She'll be fast asleep in five minutes, loaded with those headache pills
Sidney seems not to hear this remark
He is concentrated on the door; he moves hesitantly towards it, apprehensive
includes Hunsecker in background
Now we'll get to you, Sidney
(turning to Sidney) As far as the column is concerned - tonight you have forfeited every ethical consideration  ever felt for you
Much more concerned with his anxiety for Susan, Sidney interrupts
(cutting in) Look,
, 'll grant you anything you want
(as Hunsecker is about to interrupt) Susie's off her rocker tonight
Go in and see what she's doing
Go in and talk to her quietly - unless you want a corpse
Sidney's conviction is impressive
But Hunsecker is unwilling to admit the danger, he continues
(acid) Let me finish what  started to say - Seeing that Hunsecker is not taking his advice, Sidney strides swiftly to the door of Susan's bedroom
He knocks on it
the door
Susan is sitting on the bed in foreground
In a methodical, hypnotic way, she is destroying the contents of the drawer, tearing letters into small fragments
Sidney's voice is heard outside: "Susie
" Susan appears not to hear it;   closer to her
Sidney's voice is heard again, louder: "Susie
" Susan turns sharply towards the door
Susan rises to her feet, staring at the door
She begins to back away from it
as Susan glances down at the record player beside her
She turns the knob
We hear the clatter of a record dropping and music begins
The tune is "The Sage
" of Sidney
He hears the music starting
Hunsecker has come forward
But now, as he listens to the gramaphone record playing in the bedroom, Hunsecker relaxes, assuming that this is a sign that Sidney's suspicions are unfounded
(coming forward) What a cornball you are, Sidney
to include Sidney
He does not share Hunsecker's confidence; he knocks again, calling: (anxiously) Susie
(in growing fear) closer to Sidney
As he tries the doorknob, Sidney's hand tries the doorknob, finds it locked, shakes it forcefully
From inside the bedroom
We see the doorknob rattled
She realizes that Sidney means to insist
She turns away towards the blowing curtains in background
Sidney's hand is still shaking the doorknob
He releases it
to a   of Sidney and Hunsecker as Sidney retreats from the door in apprehension
Now Hunsecker has begun to share Sidney's anxiety
He moves to the door, knocks and then pounds on it
(with authority) Susie, this is
Open up
She comes forward past the blowing curtains
The wind whips at her hair
Over scene we hear the rumble of the traffic on Broadway far below
He is pounding on the door again
makes a quick pan to Sidney who, in a split second, realizes that Susan may have gone out on the balcony
He turns, dashes towards the study to look out on the terrace
She has now started to climb onto the parapet
Sidney leaps into shot, dragging her bodily off the parapet and out of shot
We hear Susan cry out, a hysterical gasp
, looking through the windows of Susan's bedroom, sees the door fly open as Hunsecker bursts into the room
He looks swiftly around, advances towards the open window
Exasperated by the sound of the gramaphone, he switches it off; he steps out onto the terrace
with him as he turns to look back into the study where Susan's inanimate figure is sprawled on the floor, half across the low upholstered footstool
Sidney, white and shaking, is standing over her
at floor level
Susan is framed in foreground
The lower half of Sidney can be seen beside her
Hunsecker is on the terrace in background
Shocked, he moves quickly into the room
He looks down at his sister
He is badly shaken
The sharp bite of terror produces a reaction of something akin to anger
But he swiftly controls it
He moves past
Hunsecker stoops into shot
Tenderly, he lifts the girl's body to get it into the arm chair
Susan is quite lifeless, limp with the dead weight of a creature that has lost any instinct for self-preservation
But as she feels her brother's arms, and as she recognizes who it is, she breaks out in hysteria
(wildly) No
Don't touch me
(sharply) Susan
But Susan strikes at him, a vicious gesture of revulsion
Hunsecker lets her go
She falls into the arm chair, her face hidden from him; she begins to sob
(her body shaking) Go away
Go away
Hunsecker would like to comfort her, but he dare not touch her again for fear of inviting another rebuff
He is deeply hurt and wounded
Embarrassed that Sidney should watch this moment, Hunsecker rises
To cover his emotion, he walks to the tray of drinks in background; he pours a brandy and comes back
Stooping, he offers it to Susan
Her only reaction is again to wrench herself away from him, facing the opposite direction
(sobbing bitterly) Hunsecker sets down the drink, stands up
(in a choked voice) Talk to her, Sidney
(hushed) Talk to her yourself
Over scene the telephone rings
It is ignored
While Hunsecker looks down at the girl, helplessly, the telephone continues to ring
It is she who first becomes aware of the telephone
Her weeping has stopped now
Slowly, she raises her head
to include Sidney beyond her; he notes this movement, seeing in it a revival of the girl's will to live; he is moved
The telephone is framed in foreground, Susan beyond
It continues to ring
As Hunsecker crosses to his desk to pick up the instrument,
Hunsecker speaks: Yuh
Yuh
(he listens) Just a minute
(turning back to Susan) Susie, it's Mr
'Angelo - from the hospital
She raises her head higher, still weakly
We see in her face a mixture of terror and hope
Hunsecker comes forward to set down the telephone in front of her, on the footstool
Hunsecker and Sidney watch
She reaches a hand, which is still trembling, picks up the receiver
Her voice as she speaks to the instrument is barely audible
Yes
yes
yes
Presently, she hangs up
When she becomes aware that Hunsecker and Sidney are waiting for an explanation, she tells them: (speaking with difficulty) Steve
is out of danger
Hunsecker nods
He already knows this
Then: (soberly) That means a lot to you
She does not look at him, she lowers her eyes but answers with a nod
And then, more positively: Yes
He studies the girl
His face has hardened
He moves, beginning to pace
(And also beginning his 'manipulations'
) But  have to warn you, Susie - for your own sake - he'll still do time
Hunsecker
It now takes in Sidney who is standing beside him
Sidney has begun to stare fixedly at Hunsecker
(He is now realizing that Hunsecker, although he has been faced with this demonstration of the girl's willingness to kill herself, has still learned nothing, is still continuing in the old pattern
) (continuing, warming to his theme) He's a hop-head - that's a felony in New York
can try, of course, to
Revolted, Sidney breaks in: You're unholy,
You'd rather kill this girl than let her go
Hunsecker wheels on Sidney, bellowing: (in blind rage) Sidney, with equal heat, spins round to Susan, crying out before he has time to check himself: (impulsively) Susie,  get out of this house
- Get out before it's too late
Sidney has gone too far now to pull back
Inevitably, he continues
During the speech,    to include Susan and then Hunsecker
(with sincerity) Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know 'm telling you the truth
(trying to stop him) You're incapable of the truth
(who will not by stopped) Susie, there's nothing wrong with Dallas
(turning toward Hunsecker) Your brother and  arranged it all
And if the Leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it
- your brother arranged that one, too
don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: Get out of here
Leave this man
During the latter part of the speech, Susan rises slowly to her feet, staring first at Sidney and then, with fearful significance, at her brother
Hunsecker does not look at her; he is concentrated on Sidney
Twice he has been about to demolish Sidney, but he now stops,
He is perfectly controlled, smiling
Like most Italians, Sidney's got a big gift for dramatics
, however, prefer the cool and stubborn facts
Sidney has not appeared in my column in weeks - check that fact with Mary
That leads right to another fact: Sidney had nothing to lose tonight
To the contrary, dear - In brief,
Hunsecker pauses impressively
Framing Hunsecker in foreground, Susan and Sidney beyond
Susan listens to Hunsecker objectively, with a mounting sense of his diseased reasoning
(continuing) Mind you, not that one true fact didn't come out of Sidney's mouth tonight: self-admittedly, he committed a vicious crime of jealousy against Steve Dallas
(pausing) Now we have to clear Dallas, don't we
But 'll have to sacrifice him
(he indicates Sidney) to do it
(turning to Susan) Am  doing right
She is looking at Hunsecker
(
) (over scene) Yes or no, Susie
Slowly, Susan nods
Susan onto Hunsecker
Hunsecker turns away from her and walks to the telephone
He picks it up and begins to speak
While the scene continues, we hear his voice off screen, speaking to the phone, saying: "This is Hunsecker
want you to get a message through to Lieutenant Kello
Ask him to ring me back
It's urgent
" Susan backs slowly away from Hunsecker
Then she turns into , which  with her and includes Sidney
Susan looks at Sidney and then, ashamed, avoids his eye
But Sidney comes nearer to her
Susan is deeply distressed
(very quietly) He's sick
She looks again at Sidney
Deliberately, Sidney nods
Susan walks toward her bedroom
Susan comes into the room, finding shelter from the revelation which has so appalled her
Inexorably Sidney follows her
He comes across the threshold, closes the door
(quietly) Yes, he's sick and you're the only idiot alive who didn't know it
pause
Sidney moves closer to her
But what are you going to do
There are some tears of pity in Susan's eyes
Once more she moves away from Sidney
Sidney senses that her compassion for Hunsecker might easily lead her once again to slip back into the trap
He insists: (with emphasis) You don't owe your brother a cup of water
Another pause
Sidney again repeats: What are you going to do
She moves away from Sidney,  following her
After a moment, she answers: Go to Steve
Sidney is moved, having done his solitary act of chivalry
To hide his feelings, he is harsh: (sharply) For Pete's sake, straighten out the seams of your stockings - comb your hair - don't be so helpless all the time
to include Susan
From the other room, we hear the telephone ring
Sidney turns and goes quickly out
After a moment, Susan looks back at the door through which Sidney has disappeared
Hunsecker is framed in foreground, speaking into the telephone
Sidney is in background, outside the door of Susan's bedroom
Hunsecker is fully aware of Sidney's presence, as he says: (to phone) No, he's admitted that, Harry
My kid sister's a witness
He watches Hunsecker with a curious detachment
Producing a cigarette, he lights it and then looks up towards Hunsecker
(
) (over scene) No, he admits he planted the stuff on the Dallas boy
Hunsecker framed in foreground, Sidney beyond
Hunsecker has at the same time been tapping a cigarette on the desk
Sidney walks across to Hunsecker, offers the lighted match
- As he accepts the light he continues speaking to the phone: Yeah
jealousy
Sidney turns on his heel, walking out of the apartment
(continuing) He's been trying to make my sister behind my back
Kello is in a phone booth
(to phone) Oh, that's serious,
Real reprehensible
Kello leans out of the booth into the cafe signaling through the window to the street outside where the squad car pulls ahead to a position ready for him outside the door
(to phone) Don't worry, 'll get there
'm on Broadway now
Kello hangs up
Hurries out
We see him get into the squad car which rapidly accelerates
' Hunsecker has hung up
He stares at the telephone for a moment
Then he moves towards Susan's door, with him
He comes to the threshold, looks at Susan who is standing in much the same position in which Sidney left her
Unaware that her brother is watching her, she picks up the fur coat on the bed
(She is about to start packing her belongings
) She turns as she hears Hunsecker speak
(over scene) That's a pretty coat
Susan, towards Hunsecker
Hunsecker comes into the room
(continuing) - but it's about time you had a new one
Susan turns squarely to face him
She braces herself to tell him: (soberly) 'm leaving,
He does not sense any danger in the seriousness of her tone (or, if he does, refuses to recognize it
) (with a faint scoff) Don't kid a kidder
'll see you for breakfast around eleven
Without waiting for a response, Hunsecker goes out, closing the door
Susan stares at it for a moment
Then she moves to get a small suitcase which she lays on the bed
Hunsecker opens the windows onto the terrace, comes out and looks over the parapet, (looking to see how far Sidney has got, hoping to see Kello's squad car
) She completes her simple packing, closing the suitcase
With a gesture that is obviously automatic, she starts to put on the fur coat; then she halts, realizing what she is doing
She pauses;
Now, deliberately she throws the coat back on the bed
down with the gesture
She looks down at the coat, the discarded symbol of her dependence upon her brother again as she takes a quick look round, then goes to take a duffle coat from the wardrobe
She throws this over her arm, picks up the suitcase, goes to the door
Susan comes out of the door
She moves with a sober determination, expecting to find Hunsecker in the room
with her
But then she realizes that Hunsecker has gone out on the terrace
She takes a step or two towards him, then pauses
From Susan's viewpoint,  through the big glass windows
Hunsecker is at the parapet
He is impatiently looking down into Broadway
She now realizes that there is no point in saying goodbye to him: she has already told him that she is leaving and, if she becomes involved in further argument with him, it can do no good
Yet there is some emotion on her face as she takes a last look at her brother; she turns away
Framing him in foreground at the parapet
Susan can be seen through the windows before she disappears to the door
Hunsecker reacts as he catches sight of a vehicle on Broadway below
The squad car comes down Broadway at speed
' Sidney is walking across the square
The squad car appears in foreground; it pauses hardly at all as Kello slips out of it, and starts to move after Sidney
Then the car accelerates round Duffy Square to cut Sidney off on the other side
Sidney comes up towards
Seeing something ahead, he halts
From Sidney's viewpoint
The car breaks to a stop
It's door opens and a detective gets out slowly
It is Phil
Sidney is framed in foreground, the squad car beyond
Sidney knows what this means
He starts to speak before he turns to look over his shoulder
Hello, Harry
Kello, moving silently up behind Sidney, slows down, amused at Sidney's prescience
Hi
(coming to join Sidney) just been on the phone to
Kello's manner is almost affectionate
He shakes his head, admonishing Sidney
(mildly) You been a bad boy, Sidney
's going to write about you in his column tomorrow
Kello onto Sidney
Sidney's smile is tired
thought he would
Yeah
(then) And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'
(as Sidney nods) You know
Sidney turns away to look back towards Phil
Then, taking Kello totally by surprise, he wheels, striking the cop viciously across the mouth
Kello's head jerks back
Recovering at once, he guffaws, lurches into  with a sudden vicious movement
There is a sharp guttural cry over scene
Phil runs forward towards the figures of Sidney and Kello seen beyond him
In doing so, he blocks the view so that we do not clearly see the violence with which Kello strikes Sidney down
Phil, in foreground, is seen to relax
When he moves aside, clearing the view, Sidney is writhing on the ground at Kello's feet
Kello wipes his knuckles on his handkerchief
He signals to Phil to help lift the body at his feet
Phil enters shot and they raise Sidney, half carrying, half dragging him out of shot
The cops carry the figure of Sidney Falco across Duffy Square; they bundle him into the police car
The pigeons in the square, circle
' down towards Duffy Square in the distance
The police car can be seen moving off, circling the square and disappearing southward on Broadway
to include Hunsecker in foreground
,  sharply upward at Hunsecker
He looks down, quiet impassively, and there is a slightly insane grandeur, a paranoiac superiority in the way that he turns back, dismissing Sidney from his thoughts
towards the closed door of Susan's room
Hunsecker walks into the shot, stops before the door
He begins to take off his tie and unbutton his shirt, clearly preparing to go to bed
As an after-thought, he comes back to the door, addresses it: (gently) Susie
(getting no answer) Are you in bed
It is at a low level, still emphasizing the man's dignity
He strolls for a few paces
(continuing) don't have to tell you, of course, that  cleared your boyfriend's name;  didn't let you down
has now moved so that we are shooting past Hunsecker onto Susan's door
He gets no answer except silence
,
We now see in his face a flicker of fear
With what is clearly an effort, he reassumes a confident manner
was saving this news for breakfast, but  think 'll jump the gun
' Still no answer from inside the bedroom
Hunsecker's forced expression remains unnaturally fixed upon his face
He calls out: Susie
The room is quite empty
across the bed towards the door in background
Susan's discarded fur coat lies on the bed
And the doors of the wardrobe are open
Hunsecker's voice can be heard continuing over scene: (
) (outside) 'm getting the Mayor to perform the ceremony and - ,  think 'll fly the Governor down from Albany
(a pause) Do you hear
pause
Then, very tentatively, the bedroom door is opened
(
) (outside) Are you listening
Now he opens the door and comes in
The sight of the empty room freezes his face for a moment
His eyes look round
From Hunsecker's viewpoint
, from the open door of the cupboard to the fur coat
to include Hunsecker
He steps to the bed, picks up the coat
There is a dazed, incredulous look on his face
But, as he glances over his shoulder,    him towards a little door in the wall behind him: It is ajar, showing a couple of inches of light
Once again Hunsecker reassures himself that Susan must be behind the door
But his voice is even more false as he declares: (a note of anger appearing in his voice) Susie
You won't threaten me
Nobody walks out on
Hunsecker
and closer to Hunsecker
The is a weird one, tilting grotesquely upward
(continuing) You need me - you all need me
Hunsecker, his fists clenching fiercely at the fur coat, walks towards the door
with him
He stands a few inches from the narrow opening
He seems about to push the door open further, but is afraid to do so
the bathtub, showing enough of the tiny room to make it clear that it, too, is completely empty
Through the slit in the door, we can see only a glimpse of the movement of Hunsecker outside
Hunsecker's voice continues: (
) "The Lord is my Shepherd;  shall not want"
(a sneering laugh) That's bunk in a book
'm the Shepherd of millions of little men and women
,  past Hunsecker to the door
As Hunsecker retreats from the door, he is still clutching the fur coat
He stands alone in the middle of the room and his gestures are a little wild
rises higher to shoot down at Hunsecker, alone in the little room
(continuing) don't ask them to get on their knees, but they come to me for advice and guidance
