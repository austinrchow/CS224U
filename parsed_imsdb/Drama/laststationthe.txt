Written by Michael Hoffman Based on the novel by Jan Parini All happy families are the same
Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
Leo Tolstoy-   Anna Karenina 1
1 High angle of the steam train travelling through a wide river valley
The stack belching smoke against the Russian sky

2 Leo Tolstoy (80), sits writing on his lapboard
He is quite simply the greatest living writer in the world
His devotion to pacifism, his rejection of the trappings of Orthodoxy in favor of a simple Christian lifestyle convince many to regard him as a living saint
With him are his much younger wife, the  , favorite daughter , and his personal physician
Sasha and Dushan write in their diaries
Sofya looks from one to the next a little impatient
The train begins to slow
Why are we slowing down
No one responds
Slower
Slower
We're stopping
Why are we stopping
don't know, mother
No idea
Tolstoy look up from his work, asks a passing conductor
Excuse me, why has the train stopped
It's the crowd, ma'm, the people
They're blocking the track
In the distance we can here voices
(
) Long live Tolstoy
Long live the old warrior
But if they block the track, the train can't go 2
The conductor shrugs, walks away
She goes to the window to investigate
crowd of a hundred peasants, students surround the engine, block the track
They carry a huge cloth banner honoring Tolstoy
We can hear voices chanting "Tolstoy
Tolstoy
Tolstoy", voices crying "You are the truth
" "You are the hope of the Russian people
" Oh, they won't move
We are gonna die here
Leo, Leo, go and say something to them
It's the only way we are gonna get out of here
The chanting grows in intensity
Tolstoy gets to his feet, walks to the window, shows himself to the crowd
great shout goes up
Tolstoy lifts his hand for silence
Gradually, it comes
have seen your banner
And  ve heard what you say
You think  m the hope of Russia, do you
Well, that s not true
You are the hope of Russia
The hope of all the world
You say, you want a new way to live
Well, you are not gonna find it making a fuss over me
So,  suggest that you get on with your work and let a poor old men get on with his
The cries begin
"Clear the tracks
Let them pass
Let them go
" Tolstoy closes the door and waves to the crowd as the train pulls away
3
3 On the chanting crowd now as the train pulls away
We focus on a handsome young man, a little stiff maybe, a little intellectual
This is He can't contain his enthusiasm
Over the noise of the train
Do you know who that is
That is the greatest man in the world
The train pulls away into the distance

5 handsome room, walls covered with generations of family photographs
Religious icons are given pride of place, a testament, not to piety, but to an ingrained social conservatism, a certain position in the world
Countess Sofya mumbles her morning prayers before a make shift altar
Wiping away tears, she leaves the room

She continues to the basement

6 Tolstoy has moved himself out of the refined upper floors into a simple vaulted room he uses as both bedroom and study
The walls are bare except for a portrait of his daughter
The furniture is simple, some of it hand made: a small bed against the wall, a little writing desk in one corner stacked with books, littered with papers, more mail, opened and unopened
Pairs of rude homemade shoes line a work bench
Tolstoy sleeps in his bed
Though it's late March and still cold, the window is open
Sofya closes it
She stands very still, watching Tolstoy sleep
Sitting on the bed, she gently touches his hand, whispers
Darling
She lies next to him, something girlish, hopeful in her face, as if waiting for him to wake up and adore her, but he sleeps on
She carefully takes his arm, positions it under her neck, and rolling toward him, wraps it around her
The image of love's intimacy, of wedded bliss
His hand slips off her shoulder, once, twice
She moves awkwardly to replace it
He moves a little toward her
She kisses his neck, his cheek
We don't know if he's awake, but even this shadow of intimacy penetrates her soul

8 handsome study in the Moscow townhouse of , Tolstoy's most articulate and dedicated disciple
He's interviewing Tolstoy's newly appointed secretary,  , the young man we met near the train, who, at the mention of sex, blushes a little
But sex
You are twenty three
Not an easy age for abstinence, is it
Tolstoy does not approve of sexual relations
know this
He despises them, in fact
Chertkov reaches for a small tin of moustache wax
don't want to belabor the point, but  arranged for a manservant last year who proceeded to ruin two housemaids just like that
He was very upset
This would not be a problem
'm celibate
'm also a strict vegetarian
Chertkov nods his approval, begins to worry his moustache
Yes, 've heard many good things about you
've even read what you`ve written
So has he
Valentin's face flushes with pride
Chertkov steals a glance at his reflection in the glass bookcase
One side of his moustache droops a little
He tugs awkwardly at it
My dear boy, if you were to become Tolstoy's private secretary, you would be given a great gift
You'll be with him every day, eat together, walk in the forest by his side
It's difficult to contain himself
5
Believe me, since becoming a Tolstoyan,  have become so eager to learn, so comitted to discussing ideas, improving my very soul
(smiling) Well, we have a lot to do if we are to get his work to the people
We
They both laugh
Yes, we
If we can encourage the spread of passive resistance
just think of it Valentin   thousands of ordinary Russians casting off centuries of spiritual and political oppression- In the name of truth and freedom
Truth and freedom, yes but still, my boy, there are so many enemies- Enemies
Chertkov walks to the window, signals Valentin to follow him
He points to standing in the street below
The Czar's police
You'll be followed when you leave here
and the church will stop at nothing to bring him back into the fold
His children can't be trusted
only Sasha
and then of course there is the Countess
(beat) Well, one doesn't like to come between married people whatever the circumstances, but her dogged attachment to private property, her public criticism of our movement
() 6
(cont'd) (beat) The point is, he needs a man of your intellectual gifts around him
Someone who can help him with the new work
Someone who understands his goals
Chertkov returns to the desk
And although they've allowed me to return to Russia,  can't see him
They keep me under house arrest
They might as well keep me in a cage
Clearly upset, Chertkov pauses to get control of himself
He picks up a package, hands it to Valentin
So,  need you to put these letters directly into his hands
One can't be sure what gets through to him
Valentin looks at him, quizzical
Sofya Andreyevna does not respect his privacy
She wouldn't open his private correspondence
Chertkov raises an eyebrow
An ominous silence
have another task for you, my dear
Please
You'll keep a diary for me
He hands Valentin a notebook
need to know everything that goes on at Yasnaya Polyana
Let me know who visits the house, any talk of the copyright to his work, any contact with the church, what letters come and go
(beat) Anything Sofya Andreyevna says
7
Anything
She's very, very dangerous

Godspeed, my boy
Valentin makes his way to the droshky that awaits him
And remember what  said
He turns back to the dark figure in the doorway
Write everything down
Go

11 Where Tolstoy, awake and dressed, sits on his bed, pen in hand, writing in his diary
Dushan sits next to him, taking his pulse
Nothing's working
Hand me my other boot, my friend, will you
Let me finish
It doesn't matter
If my heart had stopped beating, 'd still go riding today
Your pulse is my responsibility
() 8
(cont'd) and if you must ride,  insist you wear a coat
Even the sun is cold today
He puts Tolstoy's arm down and hands him his riding boot
Sofya comes ranting into the room carrying several Russian and international dailies
This is impossible
It really is
These people are parasites
Look
(reading) "Countess Tolstoy has become estranged from her husband
They barely speak
" She throws the paper on the floor
You know who spreads all this rubbish
She opens another paper, a French daily
'est la meme en France
They gossip about us in Paris
"They do not share a similar view of either religion or politics
" Incroyable
(smiling) Peut-etre
You think that's inaccurate
think it's none of the world's business
She looks at Dushan who is transcribing every word into his diary
He does it with all the master's conversations
What are you doing
Don't do that
(smiling) Dushan Petrovich, you're scribbling again
Tolstoy moves with energy and purpose toward the door
Darling, where are you going
9
Riding with Sasha
Don't expect us for lunch
Something strikes him
He walks to his desk, picks up his pen and quickly writes a sentence on a scrap of paper
Leovochka, why do you insist on dressing like that
What do you mean
Like the man who looks after the sheep
It's not meant to offend you
But it does offend me, because it offends reason
You're a Count, for God's sake
He puts his pen down, goes to her, kisses her gently on the forehead and leaves the room
Oh darling,  have something else to say
(
) doubt it not, my dear
He's forgotten his coat
He runs after him, tripping over the long fur garment
(
) Count Tolstoy, you've forgotten your coat
Meanwhile Sofya notices a photographic portrait of Chertkov on the wall
She takes it down and tosses it in the corner
12
12 As Tolstoy appears on the porch, we hear the  of cameras
crowd of photographers, film cameramen, journalists, and disciples try to catch a glimpse of the master
Dushan steps in front of him
10
Let him walk
Let him walk
Count Tolstoy, you're no doubt distressed by the Czar's treatment of your secretary Nikolai Gusev
These people are bandits
said, let him walk
They come into my house and arrest a man whose only crime is to express a view of life saner than that which prevails
So Gusev is innocent
(nods) Of course, 'm the guilty one reject the Orthodox church condemn the established order and make no secret of it
young peasant shouts from the crowd
God bless you, Tolstoy
Thank you
Let him walk
Let him walk
(to Tolstoy) But you don't banish these people very much to your credit
wish had your largeness of spirit
photographer's flash goes off
An old Muzhik touches Tolstoy's sleeve, as if expecting a miracle
Sasha, her father's soulmate, leads two horses toward them, her mount and her father's black gelding, Delire
Papa
Sasha
11
Did you ride this morning
small crowd collects to watch father and daughter embrace, kiss
of the riders- cutting around we are 13

15
15 Valentin in his buttoned up suit looks a little out of place in the overcrowded third class carriage
He writes in the diary given him by Chertkov
He glances up to see, on the bench across, a young mother taking out her breast to nurse her baby
He blushes, doesn't know where to look
An old peasant catches his eye, winks at him, laughs
16
16 Seven miles from Tolstoy's estate, this is Telyatinki, a communal center created by Chertkov dedicated to the study and practice of Tolstoyism
Telyatinki was created by Vladimir Grigorevich as a center for the movement
Just last week we had a visitor from India
We talked to the group about the healing properties of cobra venum
Oh, goodness
It's a beautiful day
Yes, but we will pay for it
Sergeyenko, Chertkov's joyless secretary, and Valentin stand on a second storey porch looking out across the central lawn where a number of young Tolstoyans tend the garden, work to put up a chicken coop
12
The meeting room is behind us
This is the tool shed
The dormitory ahead
He points out a larger building across the way
17
17 They enter the building
Telyatinki is a place of freedom
Nothing is forbidden here
Except everything
Each man is alone with his conscience and his God
(beat) The kitchen is below
You'll be expected to assist with meals at least twice a week
and to give a hand in the garden
We're all equals here, you know
as Tolstoy teaches us
They start up the stairs
You are expected at Yasnaya Polyana in the morning, first thing
look forward to it
Yes
you're lucky
We're all envious
13
18
' :                       18 Small, sparse, perfect for the novice ascetic
Valentin nods his approval
Vladimir Grigorevich is anxious that you begin your reports as soon as possible
You have the notebook he gave you
Of course
You understand we must keep the existence of the diary a secret
Valentin smiles
What is it
Just that
secrecy doesn't seem to me the essence of Tolstoy's thought
But you'll admit, you're no expert
Yes,
'll see you in the morning
If we're spared
Sergeyenko leaves Valentin to his bare, little room
19
19 The sun rising
Already, disciples are at work the gardens
20
'
20 Valentin sleeps in his tiny room
knock on the door
Come in
lovely girl at his door
She's tall, twenties, high cheek bones, short blonde hair
This is
14
've brought you a glass of tea
That's very kind of you
It's your first day
Enjoy it
She sits on the bed
He's a little taken aback, not used to this degree of familiarity
It makes no impression on Masha
You met Sergeyenko
Last night
Ad what do you think
He seems very sincere
Masha hands him his tea
Thank you
Why are you laughing
Say that again
said he seems very
Why
Is that what you think
just arrived
What's your name
Masha
But you should still say what you think
Not just about him
We all should
Thank you for the tea
Their eyes meet, hold
Valentin's discomfort increases
Tomorrow you can make your own
She walks to the door, turns to see him still watching her
15
He's a sorry old tight-assed stick in the mud
but yes, he's sincere
21
21 modest horse drawn cart
Valentin sits beside the driver, contemplates the birch trees that line the road, the long shadows they cast
Above, crows make lazy circles in the sky
22                                                          22 23

23 Valentin stands in the entry way, waiting
He looks lost
Hello
hello
(
) You're the new secretary
He looks up to see Sasha examining him from the landing above
Papa's out
You can wait in the library
Ivan will show you up
She disappears
He hears a door close
He notices a surly house servant, , who, inexplicably, leads a goat through the house
He points upstairs and walks away
24
24 Alone now among Tolstoy's books, Valentin makes his way slowly to a writing table, the holy of holies, on which War and Peace and Anna Karenina were written
He runs his hand along the old wood top
Emboldened by a backward glance, he sits in Tolstoy's chair
Before him are stacks of letters, pens and pencils, a pot of India ink
There's a notebook lying open
He leans forward to read it
noise in the hall stops him
Tolstoy enters from the dining room, red cheeked, beard dripping wet, the energy of a man ten years younger than he is
Valentin stands
'm glad you're here
So glad
16
He tromps across the room, kisses the boy enthusiastically on both cheeks
Valentin is overcome by the great man's warmth
'm
'm
Here is- Valentin interrupts himself with a sneeze
God bless you
'm sorry
Sometimes
Valentin pulls out a letter of introduction
Tolstoy takes it out and puts it down without a glance
Vladimir Grigorevich has already written about you at length need your help badly
The manifesto against the government is hard work
They commit their idiotic abuses faster than  can catalogue them
and the new book
He told me about it
It's very exciting
Tolstoy nods
've become convinced that all the world's religions have a single organizing principle
Can you guess what it is
Love
Love
Simple
Now,  want to talk about you
How are you
How was your journey
Come, sit down
Tolstoy sits on the old sofa
Valentin follows suit
You know,  was born on this sofa
Valentin gets right back up
Tolstoy laughs, pats the sofa
Sit
Sit
Valentin sits down
17
Myself, my brother, my children, at least five or six of them, right here
(beat) Now, 've read your essays
How`s your work progressing
Valentin looks into the great man's kind old face
He tries to speak but he's overcome with emotion and begins to weep
My boy, what is it
(beat) upset you in some way
Was it the sofa
It's only a sofa
Valentin shakes his head, smiling through his tears
'm very happy
You are very kind
'm no one and you are
you are Leo Tolstoy and you ask me about my work
Tolstoy takes Valentin's hand, sits him back on sofa
You rest for a moment and 'll fetch you a glass of tea
Rest, because there's work for both of us together
He smiles and goes, leaving Valentin to contemplate his fortune
25                                                          25 26                                                          26 27                                                          27 28
28 Sofya, Sasha, Valentin, , Tolstoy's son, and Tolstoy all clustered around a table taking tea
Dushan stands near the group fiddling with a gramophone that sits on a small table
These people have nothing
18
It really is the most extraordinary thing
Absolutely ignoring him
It's not for lack of land that the muzhiks live in poverty
They have no will power and they drink too much
'm not suggesting they be given land
Private property is the root of the problem
We should be giving ours away
Give it to whom
It's all ridiculous
You think that poverty makes the peasants somehow morally superior
believe that wealth corrupts us all, yes  do
pause
Valentin fills the silence
It's a keystone of the movement
Oh,  know all about the movement
pause
Valentin notices that people from the front lawn have moved up to watch all this
Life in the fishbowl, the Tolstoys seem neither to notice nor care
If the peasants had money, they wouldn't surround themselves, as we do, with footmen costing ten rubles a month
No, they'd spend it on drink and whores
Valentin Fedorovich, do you think fifty years from now, people will eat while grown men walk around and wait on them hand and foot
19
Valentin doesn't know what to say
giggle from Dushan
Oh, that's good
that's good
Dushan, having sat at table, tries surreptitiously to get down Tolstoy's words in the diary he holds below the table
Sofya flushes with anger
think
(sneeze) Stop scribbling
(points to her husband) You all think he's Christ, don't you
He thinks he's Christ
There is an awkward pause
(flustered) 'm not
don't believe Leo Nikolayevich is Christ
Christ is Christ but
But what
believe he's one of the prophets
God speaks through him
recognize the cadence in his voice
This is unbearable
No wonder feel lonely
'm surrounded by morrons
Mama, you're being ridiculous
Am
sit here and listen to this talk of love and God and equality, knowing full well that Count Generosity here is fully prepared to give away everything we have
(exhausted) You keep going on like that
Why do you think we should profit from the work  m doing which is only meant for the sake of the people
20
She turns to see Dushan scribbling again
Valentin glances at Sasha, uncomfortable at these outbursts
long pause
Dushan tries to relieve the tension
In defense of my gift, let me demonstrate
It's quite remarkable, really
He gets up, places a record on the gramophone, needle on the record
What comes forth is not music, but Tolstoy's voice
It is a recording of a recent speech against capital punishment
His voice booms, tinny and distorted
Dushan walks to the machine, stares at it in awe
Valentin is completely caught up in the technology
It's your voice
It's wonderful
They all listen for a moment, look to Tolstoy for a response
It's tiresome
Another remarkable invention will supercede it
Valentin blushes and looks at the table
Dushan tries to hide his disappointment
Please excuse me
Tolstoy rises, leaves the table, walks out onto the lawn
Dushan gets up quickly, bumping the table as he goes
Tea spills
Valentin moves to wipe it up, sneezes, a barrage of irritable blessings
Leo Nikolayevich is something of a Luddite,  fear
Sofya crosses to the machine, removes the record from the gramophone, replaces it with another Dushan has brought
Suddenly, the air is filled with   the final duet from Mozart's Il Nozze di Figaro
She   returns to her place
There is a long moment where all   take in the sublimity of it
Tolstoy walks slowly back to   the table
He stands completely still
Tears fill his   eyes and roll down his cheeks
21
Oh, that s better
That s nice
Very nice indeed
Sofya crosses to her husband, wipes the tears off his face
Valentin watches as they embrace
(
) Do your parents often speak to each other so
bluntly
29
29 Across from Tolstoy's writing desk is Sasha's world, a makeshift office lined with more bookcases where she does her work, sending cables, editing manuscripts, answering endless stacks of mail
Valentin sits near her, learning the ropes
My mother doesn't understand my father's goals, not since his work as a novelist became secondary
His commitment to the spiritual life offends her
They've fought about it for years
'm sure she means well
Sasha just looks at him
Your father is the greatest writer in the world
Quite
pause
mean to say,  feel privileged to be here
It's an
honor
Valentin feels himself slip further into mundanity
Sasha goes back to her letter
Valentin
God Bless You
They read together for a moment
He sneezes again
(irritated) God bless you
22
'm sorry
Sometimes  sneeze when 'm nervous
She regards him like an animal in the zoo
Ivan appears at the door
What is it
It s a note, for him
He nods toward Valentin
Well, give it to him then
Valentin reads the note
It s from your mother
She wants to see me
As Valentin goes, She is looking for allies
Pay attention
This is war
30
30 Sofya is settled on a divan in a small room off the dining room
Valentin sits beside her holding a glass of tea
see a fine young man before me
Clear eyes
Nice features, rather handsome in a peculiar way
Thank you, Countess
Call me Sofya Andreyevna
We don't stand on formality here, as you may have observed
(beat) Many young men ruin their looks by loose living
You're a real Tolstoyan,  can tell
admire your husband immensely
That's excellent
He likes that
23
His ideas are beautiful
social justice
the idea
Don't you think
Sofya drains her tea cup, signals for more
He's very grateful for the help you've been giving him
He told me so himself
think it surprises him that a young man would be so diligent
When he was your age, he was whoring in the Caucasus
Valentin's eyes are wide
She nods
He wrote it all down
He even gave me a copy, so  could read all the details
Thank you
You've read War and Peace
Many times
twice
Sofya smiles at his honesty
When he was writing it, long before Chertkov created that monstrosity at Telyatinki, before all this "new religion" and revolutionary nonsense
(beat) What do you think of Chertkov, by the way
He's given me an extraordinary opportunity
But you see what a fool he is, a self-serving puritanical idiot have to say, it's been extremely pleasant since they've locked him in his house
Sofya smiles
Valentin is nonplussed by her directness
24
When my husband was writing it, in the mid-sixties, he'd bring me pages to re-copy everyday
was the only one who could read his handwriting
could read his intentions, too
Afternoons, we'd drink tea and discuss changes
"Natasha wouldn't say that to Prince Andrey," or "Pierre's too simple here
He's not stupid
" She smiles at the memory
But  don't count anymore
Silence
She sips her tea
She glances out the door to see Sasha hovering nearby
Listening
Sasha walks away
You must help me, Valentin Fedorovich
want only what is best for my husband and my family
could tolerate the situation if it only concerned me What  can not do is sit back while they steal my children's inheritance
Do you know  was the only person
could understand his intention
don't believe anyone wants to do that
Sofya gives him a condescending smile
She produces a package from the table beside her, hands it to him
have a little gift for you He opens it, extracts a small leather bound book
He stares at it
It's a diary
(beat) Everyone should always keep a diary
It's a very popular activity around your husband
You're teasing me, but  trust you'll write the truth
25
That may not be so easy
Nonsense
You've been listening to your friends at Telyatinki
(beat) Write what you see
That's always the place to begin
(slowly) What
You
See
Valentin fingers the package, stifles a sneeze
More tea
31
31 Valentin rides into the compound
number of the disciples are outside working
There is the ringing of metal on wood
He looks for the source
As the way clears a little, he sees Masha chopping away with an axe
He stops his horse to watch her
You're finished for the day
He didn't need me this afternoon
He gets down off his horse
Masha continues to chop
He picks up an axe, holds it awkwardly
Leo Nikolayevich disapproves of women doing physical labor
(beat) Don't you find that reactionary
No,  find it sweet
find you reactionary
She laughs
Valentin picks up a log, sets it on end and begins to chop
He doesn't do it well
Masha smiles at his struggle
He admires you,  believe
What's she saying
Sergeyenko told me
He's miserable about it
26
Tolstoy's kind to everyone
The log is stuck to the blade of his axe
He's really struggling now
What do you talk about when you're with him
(beat) Why are you blushing
We talk about me
Really
He wants to know everything about me, my parents, my relations with women, my experience of god - He looks up to see Masha smiling at him
And what relations are these
Valentin blushes, goes back to trying to chopping
Almost immediately the log becomes stuck to the blade of the axe
He bangs it, bangs it trying to free it
He glances up to see her still looking at him
He pounds again and again
She stops, reaches for his axe, touching him as she does
She lifts the big axe, log and all, above her head, bringing it down hard
The log splits
She hands the axe to him
had a lover before  came here
headmaster of a school where  taught
He was married - happily married
It was difficult
We could make love only at school
This is somehow more than Valentin had bargained for
At school
In the gymnasium, after the girls had gone
There were straw mats on the floor
see
27
He looks away to hide his confusion
Have  upset you
He looks at her
No
appreciate your frankness But you disapprove of me
see it in your eyes
don't
Not at all
think sexual activity
how men and women combine their physical parts is completely neutral
Listen to you
You're a prig
Just like Sergeyenko
Why else would they have hired you
That's not fair don't care if it's fair
It's true
neutral
my God
'm going
He puts down the axe
Do as you like
She goes back to chopping
We track in front of him as he walks toward the house
The chopping stops
Valentin Fedorovich
He stops, relieved and turns to face her
You forgot your horse
Yes
You know,  think that
never mind
He hesitates for a moment, then starts toward her
Her back is to him
She begins to chop again
The color rises in his face as he tries to salvage a little dignity
28
He grabs the reins and starts again toward the buildings, trips in a ditch, almost falls flat
Red faced, he rights himself
The chopping behind him remains constant
Sergeyenko watches him from the porch
32

message coming through

32A Sofya walks into the house with another stack of mail
Sasha comes piling down the stairs
Where's papa
Without waiting for the answer, Sasha races past her and out the door 33                                                          33 34
34 Valentin and Tolstoy walk together in the woods
couldn't write
was distracted  think
had a dream last night, about a Tartar girl  knew in the war
girl who died
No, no
girl  had sexual intercourse with
Sometimes we did it twice a day
Valentin sneezes
God bless
've never forgotten our time together, the position of our bodies, the taste of her
You shouldn't torture yourself
It was a long time ago
Tolstoy laughs out loud
29
Torture
You are a virgin, aren't you
try to
you know, to
To be what, a good Tolstoyan
Tolstoy smiles
You see,  myself am not a very good Tolstoyan
You should think twice about asking my advice about anything
Torture
(he laughs) Are you alright
Kalya, her name was
She's an old woman now, white hair, old body like me
She'd hardly remember my name,  suspect
She may even be dead
(beat) Do you think that meant something
What do you mean
mean that little romance
Was there some meaning to it
It s interesting
think you would say
mean,  ve read where you say that the physical body isn t real
That it s all an illusion
say lots of things
What do you say
What do you think
don t know
Leo Nikoleyevich smiles
don t know, either
He inhales deeply
30
Smell that
Lilac
He looks up as he hears Sasha off screen
"Papa
Papa
" Precisely
It's lilac
The smell's stronger when the sun goes down
He presses Valentin's hand
Papa
've enjoyed myself, my boy
(shouting for Sasha) '
As he starts in the direction of her voice
Sasha appears in the clearing, telegram in hand
He's free
He's free
He's coming back Smash cut to 35
35 train roars past camera, shaking the world
36                                                        36 37
37 Chertkov climbs down from his droshky
Suddenly, Tolstoy is there
Valentin watches them embrace
My dear, dear man
Tears run down his old cheeks
They embrace again
(
) He'll try again to convince your father to change his will
31

/
38 Andrey and Sofya stand together at the window, watching the joyful reunion
To give the copyright as "a gift to humanity
"
the reptile
Papa's not in his right mind
He can't defend himself against these thieves
(beat) My tooth is killing me
You're a fine son, darling
None of this make believe chastity and made up religion
wish all my children had turned out like you
Andrey's finger in his mouth, massages the offending molar
man'th responthibility ith to hith family
From her , we see the two men walk away together arm in arm, talking animatedly
Chertkov's notions of virtuous behavior are calculated to destroy me
To dethtroy uth all
There is nothing more pathetic than impoverished aristocrats
She walks out of the room
39
39 And into the drive to greet Chertkov
He moves immediately to her, offers her his hand and an unctuous smile
Vladimir Grigorevich, what a surprise
Sofya Andreyevna, 'm happy to see you
32
Valentin watches her match him smile for smile
* And 'm happy to make you happy
always
40                                                          40 41
41 Valentin and Chertkov sit together in the droshky, an awkward silence
'm glad to have a moment alone with you, Valentin
How do you think you're getting on
(a little nervous) hope my work is pleasing to Leo Nikolayevich
Yes
He seems satisfied and that's good
The reports 've received from you however
There seems to be some confusion
What do you mean
You send me never ending commentary on Tolstoy's writing
That's all very interesting but not very useful
need to know what goes on with Sofya Andreyevna
You must see by now she's committed to undermining her husband's best intentions
It's not quite so obvious to me
Because she is duplicitous
You are very bright
Too bright to let her into you
Chertkov fixes the boy with his intense gaze
You value our work
33
do
The ideals we share
That's why 'm here
Good, of course it is
(beat) Do you think the Countess suspects something
Well,  think the Countess is very suspicios by nature
How so
don t think she likes you very much
What does she say
It s a tone  ve picked up
We simply want to distribute Tolstoy's work to the widest audience possible
She just has no understanding what it is we are trying to do
There s nothing in it for any of us but a real chance to increase the world s happiness
He takes Valentin's hand
can only be of limited help to the master if  don't know what's going on
Any effort she makes to shore up control of the copyright,  must know
The survival of our movement depends on it
Remember who your friends are
What you've come here to do
Chertkov turns away to watch the countryside
Valentin stares straight ahead, his nose twitches slightly
42                                                       42 34

'
47 Valentin, in bed, writes in his diary
Closing his eyes, he begins to drift off when there is a noise outside his door
Hello
Hello
After a moment, it opens a crack
Masha
She is there
She puts two fingers to her lips and walks toward him
She carries a candle which reveals her short hair, her lovely eyes
Masha
She says nothing, simply crawls into bed, positions her knees on either side of him
She leans forward and kisses him
Masha
Ssshh
She begins to move against him
Their faces touch
She doesn't kiss him, but he can feel her breath
She sits up
Move the book
What
Your book
It's true
Valentin still clutches the diary to his chest
He puts it aside
Masha, then, pulls her nightdress over head, exposing her small breasts, her flat stomach
35
She reaches under the sheets, curls her fingers around him
He flinches at the pleasure of it
Is it alright
He can't speak
Only nod
He bites his lip as she slips him into her and begins to rock
The pleasure is too much, and he comes too quickly
She falls forward on him, begins to laugh
What
what is it
You really are a virgin
Valentin tenses a little
'm playing
It's fine
It's wonderful
(beat) Hold me
He does, as if he'll never release her
48
48 Activity in the compound
Chairs on the lawn, a banner being erected, a long table being set
Preparations being made
49
'
49 Light spills into Valentin's room
He lies with his arms around naked Masha
Wake up, wake up
am awake
want to ask you something
Say it again
It was wonderful
They both giggle
Why did you come to a place like this
36
What do you mean
You don t follow any of the rules
Masha smiles
You mean, why does someone who doesn't follow the rules come to a place like this
it's not about rules
Not for Tolstoy anyway
knock at the door startles them
(
) Valentin Fedorovich
Valentin is suddenly in a panic
What is it
49A
49A Sergeyenko hovers outside the bedroom door
Open the door
(
) At the moment, 'm indisposed
Yes, well
Leo Nikolayevich is here
He want s to see you
49B
'
49B Valentin blanches
Tell him
'll be down at once
(
) Yes
and tell Maria Filipovna we could use another hand in the kitchen
They look at each other
37
If  see her  will
(
) If you see her
yes
And if you're going to behave like rabbits, you should go live in the woods
Valentin is up, immediately
Let me go out first
give me five minutes
Masha just looks at him
50
50 Tolstoyan photo op
delegation of orphans have come to pay their respects to Tolstoy
He sits in a chair beside Chertkov beneath a large banner : "Leo Tolstoy, Friend of the People
"
Behind him, the disciples lay out a vegetarian feast on a plank table
Photographers and a cinematographer are strategically positioned to record the event
Each child gives Tolstoy a flower
Chertkov, in turn, hands each child a photograph of the Count giving money to the poor
Valentin enters, flushed and blushing
He pauses beside Dushan who records the scene in his diary, tears in his eyes
Look at the love in him, like Jesus
suffering the children
all that
Tolstoy greets a little boy affectionately, rubs his knuckles over the boy's shaved head
little girl approaches, takes a photograph
He bends forward to kiss her head but she pulls away
An old man is a very ugly thing
Tolstoy sees Valentin, lights up
My dear boy
Come and kiss me
Valentin, beet red, goes to him
He is warmly embraced
38
Now, who is this
Maria Filipovna
Masha comes to stand beside him
She glances at Valentin but he won't make eye contact with her
You're both looking so well
Life here at Telyatinki obviously agrees with you
Valentin sneezes mightily, moves a little away
God bless you, boy
What are you nervous about, now
Sit down
Sit down
Valentin takes the chair beside him
Dear Masha, Valentin tells me you're the great treasure of Telyatinki
He claims you're a very gifted teacher
Sergeyenko lifts an eyebrow "Indeed
"
Valentin is in agony
We're happy to have you with us
Tolstoy notices a mosquito on Valentin's cheek
He takes the bug between his big fingers, squeezes until it pops
Chertkov watches in horror, whispers loudly
What are you doing
What do you mean
He motions to the photographers
You've killed a living thing
Chertkov hears a laugh behind him
It is Masha who has over heard the whole thing
Do you have something to say
It's absurd
That's all
Chertkov is taken aback
Valentin stares at her
39
What are you saying
'm sorry but- It's a mosquito
Forgive him
He can't help it
He's a better Tolstoyan than am
She can't help laughing again
Valentin sees the color rise in Chertkov's face
It's not the message we want to send
Sasha suddenly appears
She holds a cable in her hand
From my mother "Nerves dreadful
Stop
Insomnia
Stop
Pulse 100
Stop
Please come home
51
'
51 Chertkov is there
Tolstoy, Valentin and Sasha
Don't give in to her, Papa
It'll never end
swear to God, that woman has an instinct for knowing when you're just about to enjoy yourself knock on the door
Valentin opens it
It's Dushan with another cable
Tolstoy gestures for him to read it aloud
From Sofya Andreyevna
" beg you
Stop
Unwell
Stop
Hurry back
" Who taught her to use that damned machine
Valentin starts to sneeze, stifles it, starts again, stifles, starts, explodes
Guilty
Perhaps Sasha's right
Encouraging this may not be the best thing
40
It's a trick, Papa
She'll drain you
You'll be miserable
Tolstoy looks from one to the other, gets up from his chair
Then, let me go with you
No, my dear, 'll go alone
52                                                          52 53
'
53 Close on Sofya lying in bed
She looks ravishing in the candle light
In the background, Tolstoy arrives in the bedroom door
Sofya
sly smile on her lips, the tension gone from her face, she seems twenty years younger
Sofya, are you ill
She rolls toward him making it clear she's quite naked under the sheets
This is no sick bed
'm fine
now that you're home
It's no good, you know, all this
You frightened everyone
Did  really
don't believe it
Not you
'm your little bird
You know the sounds make
That was some sort of love call
It brought you back to me
She reaches out her hand to him
41
Come out of the dark
where can see you
He takes a step toward her, then stops
Why
Why
Why, do you do it
We live in the country and you insist on making it an opera house
What's wrong with a little peace now and then
Sofya laughs
Look at me
This is who  am
This is what you married
We're older, maybe we're old, but 'm still your little chicken (beat) You're still my big cock
She smiles at him
Let me make you crow
pause, then a huge laugh comes up from the very center of him
He twists his neck, thrusts his head upward, crows like a rooster
He virtually runs to her, embraces her, kisses her
She is a giddy girl in his arms
He breaks the embrace and begins strutting around the room
Let me make you sing
He takes her in his arms, again, begins to kiss her neck
Do you love me
do
want you to love me
He stops kissing her, looks her in the eye
Then, another loud crow
Laughing, they fall into each other again
53A
53A And we hear their laughter over the dark old house
42
54
54 Valentin sits by himself on the porch, writes in his diary
Down below, some of the disciples listen to peasants play music around a bonfire
voice from the darkness
'm not supposed to do this either
He locates the speaker by the glow of her lit cigarette
Masha
You are not supposed to smoke at Telyatinki
You wouldn't look at me
It was difficult in front of the others
But it wasn't difficult in your bed
When it was only you and me in front of God
'm not sure  was conscious of God
Masha emerges from the shadows, but keeps her distance
So,  made you forget God
No
Yes, only for a moment
You forgot your rules and remembered love
You make it sound very simple
It is simple
What we did is what men and women do, have done, will continue doing
What could be more simple
We touched each other-- stayed close together
Something passed between us
Something real
That is a betrayal of what
Of nothing
() 43
(cont'd) But you're afraid
All your ideas
What are you afraid of
'm afraid 've hurt you, haven t No
feel a little sad, but it is not for me
It's for you
She disappears into the house
Valentin looks after her
55
'
55 The Countess wakes to find her bed empty
56
56 She comes through the dining room to find Tolstoy on the back terrace
Wrapped in a blanket, he writes in his diary, a cup of tea in front of him
Good morning, my darling
Do you mind if  join you
Without looking up Of course, my dear
He continues to write
She watches him for a long moment
She opens her diary and begins to write as well
It's quite insane, my darling
Everyone is making fun of you
He looks up
What are you talking about
She continues to write
Even the muzhiks
heard them laughing in the barn
About what
Sofya looks at him knowingly
44
Laughing about what
don't want to ruin last night
She sips her tea, goes back to her writing
pause
He follows suit
After a moment
Laughing about the fact that you've developed a senile crush on a fat middle aged flatterer
Your passion for Chertkov has become a standing joke
have a great affection for Vladimir Grigorivich
Let them laugh if they find it amusing
But it's not amusing, darling
It's sick
It's not normal
You hang on his every word
We have a great deal in common
You have nothing in common
You are a genius
He's a sycophant and a pervert
Because he understands what 'm trying to do
Because he tries to help me accomplish it
He is using you
You just can't seem to see it
This is absolute nonsense
That bold, obese, idiotic man
You treat him
He turns to her
his face red with anger and frustration
It's impossible for you not to distract me
Let me alone
for God's sake
You're like a spoiled child
45
He rises, spits on the ground, goes into the house
Sofya follows
57
57 Catching him up
Do you love me, Lyovochka
Of course,  do
Then why would you betray me
Why do you say that
Because of the will
57A
//
57A Tolstoy, taken aback, says nothing
The new will
There's no new will
She stares at him in silence
There is no new will
Does Chertkov have it
There's no new will
He walks up the stairs
She follows
But that's why he's come back
You talk about it, you and your boyfriend
You plan for it
You have no heart for the people who really love you
You'd rather be seduced by charlatans and deluded by flatterers, all in the name of love
You can't even love your own children
You can't even love me
46
Tell me where it is
There is no new will
58
58 He goes to his desk, tries to ignore her
Then, promise me there never will be
moment's hesitation
ve told you the truth
Now, let me work
Please, will you
He walks to his desk
59                                                         59 60
60 Tolstoy looks up from his work
Sofya stands in the doorway
Tomorrow, 'll go to the Station and lie down on the track
Tolstoy's wife becomes Anna Karenina herself
See how the papers will like that
As he goes, we hear
(
) This is unbearable
You don't want a husband
You want a Greek chorus
Sofya is taken aback by his response
She walks out of the room
61
61 Four peasants pull a water cart down a rough country road
We pan off to see Sofya in her droshky, resplendent in a white dress
47
62
'
62 and  look through a crack in the interior window
- the Countess on the sofa drinking a glass of tea
Valentin enters from the meeting room
She's here to question you about the new will
Chertkov nervous, tugs at his moustache
How does she know it even exists
She claims Leo Nikolayevich told her she could examine the draft
He is obviously not thinking clearly
And now we have to put up with her petty grasping
It doesn't seem petty to me
beg your pardon
He`s her life
The work, in her mind, is theirs
together
And you're her advocate
You've been taken in by her celebrity worried about this
'm talking about their history -- - simply that
We should see her
Act as if nothing has happened
Nothing has happened
63
63 The men enter the meeting room
48
Sofya Andreyevna, at last, you honour us with your visit
Valentin watches her match him smile for smile
And 'm happy to make you happy
always
She looks at him curiously
What is it
Your moustache is
Drooping, one side of it anyway
(nodding) It's a problem of the wax
Sofya takes them in
Let me get to the point
Vladimir Grigorivich,  don't wish to be your enemy
'm delighted that my husband has a friend who understands and shares his ideals
All  want is what's reasonable - an opportunity to evaluate the new will
If you agree, 'm sure we can be friends
You're very kind
Sofya Andreyevna
But  can't help you
Not without specific instructions from your husband
(to Bulgakov) Leo Nikolayevich has agreed, hasn't he Val- No witness you produce will change my position
But 'll certainly talk to Leo Nikolayevich at the first opportunity
Sofya is livid
49
Very well
want us to be friends, too, Sofya
Leo Nikolayevich is the most valuable thing in the world, for both of us
We should endeavor to set things right between us
Give him peace
Let him work
Yes
(beat) Valentin Fedorovich
are you coming back to the house with me
Valentin glances between them, searching for middle ground
'll escort the Countess home and be back in time for supper
Sergeyenko sneers
Masha will be overjoyed
Valentin's nose twitches
He looks at the floor
(
) Have you been keeping something from me
How delightful
64
64 They are back in the droshky, the return trip to Yasnaya Polyana
Valentin doesn't respond
We've become close friends, think
Tell me everything, dear boy
love a romance
It's nothing, really
young woman in your life is nothing
Masha is a friend
lover
50
good friend
That sounds serious enough
Valentin looks away
don't mean to annoy you
'm not annoyed
You forget that 'm an experienced reader
can read your face, every letter
It's beautifully clear
(beat) Do you love her
Valentin looks at Sofya, tears in his eyes
Maybe  do
Not something they'd understand, these so called disciples of my husband
They've never understood a word he's written
(beat) What do any of them know about love
65
65 Masha carries two water buckets suspended from a pole across her shoulders
Arriving at a stream, she takes each bucket and fills it
It's hot work
Pausing a moment, she kneels to splash water on her face
Another
- someone watches her from the trees
As Masha wets a cloth, puts it around her neck
Suddenly someone grabs her from behind
She screams, wrestle her way free
She turns to see Valentin, flushed, smiling, excited
He steps toward her, kicks over one of the buckets
Sorry, sorry, 'll
didn't mean to scare you
Are you alright
51
Fine
fine
Why did you
came back as soon as  could
It was a strange day
Leo Nikolayevich,
love to listen to him
love nothing more
He moves closer to her
But today  could hardly concentrate
He's very close to her, now
All  could think of was you
Masha shakes her head, moves away from him
Begins to gather the pole, to refill the spilled bucket
Stops her, turns her to him
What's wrong
think 've confused you
've confused us both
No
No
You didn t confuse me was stupid
was afraid, but 'm not afraid anymore
Valentin wants to fight through the awkwardness
He tries to kiss her
She won't have it
She pulls away
love you, Masha
Maybe you could help me a little
In silence, he gets the filled buckets balanced on the pole
Without another word, Masha starts toward the buildings
He doesn't know what to do
He's losing her
He shouts
Masha
She turns 52
Before the other night
'd committed the act of copulation many times in my heart
He has her attention now, as well as that of a number of the disciples who look up from their work in the yard
Yes
think about you all the time
In my heart  ve comitted the act of copulation many times
just want to say
It was never like it was with you
Masha bursts out laughing
'll wait for you, then
As Valentin goes to catch her up, he sees Sergeyenko watching from outside the unfinished chicken coop
66                                                         66 67
'
67 Sofya wakes up
She looks relaxed, then she sniffs, sniffs again
Out of bed, she grabs a dressing gown
Opening her door, she spots Ivan in the hall
Ivan, who's wearing that awful perfume
Ivan a gesture indicating an elaborate moustache
She steps into the hall in time to see Tolstoy, Chertkov, Valentin and Sasha disappear into the library, ducks back into her room to avoid being seen 68
68 Sofya approaches the door, listens
She can make out only a few words
"Mama cannot find out", Chertkov shushing her, whispers
We push in on Sofya's anxious face
53
69
69 Chertkov, Sasha, Dushan, Valentin and Tolstoy sit in a little clump by his desk
Tolstoy his head in his hands, looks at the floor
hate to say it but the Countess has become more and more dangerous
Not dangerous
She's concerned for the welfare of the family
(to Tolstoy) And we're concerned for the welfare of mankind
(to Bulgakov) Take this down
Valentin records the conversation in his diary
It s a terrible thing you ask can t do it
70
'
70 Sofya, still in her dressing gown, climbs out her bedroom window onto a narrow ledge that runs along the second floor
70A
70A Sofya stand on the window ledge high above the ground
She begins to move toward the library balcony
71
71 You've been more than reasonable
She already controls the income from your property
Listen to him, papa
He has our best interests at heart
Tolstoy looks at Valentin, who looks at the floor
We're speaking only of the rights to your words, your ideas
() 54
(cont'd) With all love and respect, the Countess is too interested in making a profit from your work
72
72 Sofya moves along the narrow ledge as if it's a perfectly normal activity
Looking down, she sees a couple of gawkers watching her from the lawn
She shoos them away
73
73 Valentin turns his head
Did he hear something
She's my wife
She s part of me
We've been together now, so many years
Chertkov drives the point home
But you're more than a husband and father
She must understand that
The best interests of the people are one with your own
You belong to them
Valentin glances up
and is shocked to see She disappears
74
74 Sofya has reached the french doors
She can hear clearly now
(
) But she won't
She'll never understand
a crowd of gawkers gather on the lawn below her
One man sets up photographic equipment
She waves him away turns back to the window
75                                                        75 76                                                        76 55
77
77 Chertkov pushes his point
She's unstable
wonder if she isn't ill
It s sadly more than possible
know it s hard for you, papa
But we must be realistic
We pan to the french doors to see Sofya furious face as she listens to the betrayal
(
) Do you really think she's fit to control the final disposition of the will
We pan back to the conspirators
Before Tolstoy can respond, Sofya charges into the room
As she does, she steps on the hem of her long dressing gown and ends up sprawled on the floor
The conspirators just stare at her
How dare you
What are you doing
You're all plotting against me
In my own house, too
bear you thirteen children
How can you betray me like this
(beat) Someone help me up
No one moves
Tolstoy slumps in his chair
Give everything you've got to him, your fat little catamite
"What will it be, my dearest dear, my Vladimir Grigorivich
My wife's heart on a platter
Her kidneys
With salt
But of course, my dear Chertkov, whatever pleases you
The china
The estate
Permanent copyright on everything 've ever written
Anything for you, my love
" 56
Her eye falls on Dushan, who very unfortunately, has chosen to take this down in his diary
Give me that
Give it to me, you little weasel
She grabs the offending volume
The struggle begins
Please, Countess Sofya- Mama, please
She rips the book away and after brandishing it above her head, throws it through the open doors with a guttural, rumbling growl
She turns on her tormentors
Now
(mumbles) Can  not
Can  not have
His face is red, his body rigid with anger
You'll kill him, Mama
That's what you want, isn't it
You want him to die
" She helps him up, takes him to his bedroom
Valentin follows
She looks at Chertkov
You
Don't think you deceive me for one little moment
know exactly what you're doing want to see the will
It's my right, in the name of god
What are you afraid of
You
'm afraid of you
Chertkov looks at her with undisguised disgust
The press is bloodthirsty
Had wished,  could've demolished you and your family
You make it easy
57
Tell them anything you like
Go ahead
Ruin us
have too much respect for Leo Nikolayevich
You're lucky
Why can't my husband see you for what you are
Chertkov's face is red
He starts to speak, stops
He walks to the door, then very deliberately
If  had a wife like you,  would have blown my brains out long ago
(beat) Or gone to America
He leaves the room
Sofya sinks back to the floor, a flower wilting
She begins to weep
An Aria from Madame Butterfly comes over 78
78 From a record on the gramophone
The table is set for ten, although no one is at dinner but Sofya Andreyevna and Valentin
He is visibly uncomfortable
An awkward silence
hope you're feeling better
Do you like the opera
took singing lessons for years
thought about a career in music
The only thing  lacked, in the end, was talent
(beat) 'm sorry about everything
She smiles
This aria is very beautiful
It is about a woman who is abandoned by the man who loves her
Everyone is very moved by that
in the opera
long pause
The clink of soup spoons
Tolstoy enters
He doesn't sit
58
Our life together has become intolerable
Stifling a sneeze, Valentin gets up to leave,tries to flee the inappropriateness of all this
Sit down, Valentin
Really, 'm expected at Telyatinki
She waves it off
No, no, no
Enjoy your dinner
We've had a disagreement
No more than any other married couple
didn't come for more recrimination
Despite good cause for alienation between us,  have never stopped loving you
Of course
God knows you don't make it easy
Why should it be easy
'm the work of your life
You're the work of mine
Its what love is
Aside to Valentin
Everything with him is hysterics should go
Sit down
(beat) So, this is what love is
Does that surprise you, boy
They both look at him thought it might be quieter, but- 59
He sneezes violently
/ God bless you Tolstoy turns to Sofya
He's right, though
If we cannot live a decent, quiet life, if cannot work, if  cannot find some peace,  shall simply go away
Go
Where
Not to Chertkov, but  shall go
Go where
Dushan says you're killing me
Sofya rises up in cold rage
Then go
Go
Anywhere you please
She smashes a plate on the table to punctuate it and another and another
hate you
hate what you've become
She picks up another plate, lets it fall
Now, she acts as if she's choking or gasping for breath
Countess
Are you alright
She fights with her collar, rips open the front of her dress
(shouts) You'll destroy me
Dushan runs into the room
Sofya continues to tear at her clothes, stops, begins to pant, then falls to the floor in a faint
60
Is she alright
Tolstoy tries to answer, but is overcome by a coughing fit
Dushan starts toward him but Tolstoy waves him in the direction of Sofya
He kneels beside her
Sofya
Open your eyes
My back
My back
'm hurting
You're lying on a fork
Sit up and you'll improve markedly
Valentin, help to get her upstairs, would you
Valentin helps Sofya to her feet
Dushan gets up himself and walks to Tolstoy
She's alright
'm more concerned for you
We should all go to bed before something else happens
79                                                       79 80
80 Valentin sits at the bonfire, with other disciples
After a while he walks towards the house
81
81 It's late
The house is quiet
Valentin walks into the kitchen to see Masha washing the dishes
Exhausted, he sits, stares at the floor
It was terrible there today
between them
They loved each other so much, but you see what it becomes
She stays at the sink, says nothing
Masha, what s the matter
She speaks without turning to him
61
'm going back to Moscow
What
He gets up, goes to her
Chertkov spoke with me this afternoon
He says  could be more useful there
which means
Valentin shakes his head
His lip trembles
This is him punishing us, punishing me for befriending Sofya Andreyevna
For not
This is Chertkov
We've both disappointed him
don't care
You can't go away
'll talk to him
'll make him change his mind
i m going to make you stay
No,  want to go
What
'm leaving the movement
You can t leave Tolstoy
am not
Look, when  read his Confession, it moved me, Valya
He was searching for freedom
Freedom from anger
Freedom from attachment
Freedom from all the superstition and nonsense of the church
It moved me so much thought that's what it would be about
Isn't that what it's about
Freedom and love
But they mix it all up
Masha reaches out and puts her arms around him
Her head falls against his shoulder
62
Come with me
Please
Bulgakov doesn't know what to say
The silence gets more awkward as it gets longer
Slowly, she disengages herself from him,looks him in the eye
She nods
'm going to my room
As she starts away
Don't leave me, Masha
need you
She turns back for a moment
know you do
know
Then she's gone
82
' /
82 Sofya in her bed
team of doctors hover over her
One of them peers into her eyes with a sextant-like instrument
We move into the hall to find
, an expert in mental illness, conferring in the hall with Tolstoy and Dushan
believe the Countess suffers from a mental degeneracy, paranoic and hysterical, chiefly the former
Yes
The doctor walks back into the bedroom
Tolstoy red in the face, walks away down the hall
Dushan catches him
Why did you bring him here
He's an old friend, you know, from Rome
And astoundingly stupid in the way of all scientists
Dushan is wounded by his uncharacteristic lack of generosity
63
'm sorry, my friend, but this is all very upsetting to me
Yes
Tolstoy sits on a small staircase at the end of the hall
Bulgakov is already there on the step above him
Take them downstairs
Thank them for me
Offer them a drink
You'll be alright
Valentin Fedorovich will stay with me, won't you, boy Valentin nods
Dushan goes to collect the doctors
-Tolstoy goes to Sofya's bed
He takes her hand
She looks at him with all the love of a new bride
Tears come to his eyes
He kisses her hand
Ya
your
your
can t remember now
Yo, what did say
What did you mean
You rest now
Valentin watches from the doorway as Tolstoy leaves the bedside and walks out
83
83 It is an autumn afternoon
Valentin and Tolstoy pick their way through the thick undergrowth
As they come into a clearing
Valentin is surprised to see a portable table and several chairs set up like lawyers office in the middle of the wood
Sergeyenko fiddles with a piece of paper on the desk
Chertkov comes toward them
Tolstoy stops his horse
He turns to Valentin with tears in his eyes
You see,  no longer feel  have a choice in the matter
She isn't
He rides forward toward the approaching Chertkov
64
Good afternoon, Leo Nikolayevich
Is it
They help Tolstoy dismount
They lead him to a nearby stump and place the writing board before him
Sergeyenko hands a document to Chertkov who lays it on the board
This will insure that the complete works will live in the public domain
Monumentous
Your work is the birthright of the Russian people
Now, they possess it forever
Tolstoy looks up at them
Yes
need a pen
Of course
Chertkov looks at Sergeyenko who swallows hard
No pen
uh
What
Sergeyenko moves close to Chertkov, close enough to whisper
You're a secretary
How can you not have a pen
Sergeyenko points at Valentin
He's a secretary, too
Ask him
Valentin Fedorovich, do you have a pen
65
Valentin hesitates for a moment, looks at Tolstoy, seated on the stump, staring into the middle distance
do
Valentin fetches it from his satchel
Pen in hand, Tolstoy hovers over the document
long moment
Are you alright
feel like a conspirator
Sergeyenko laughs
Chertkov glares at him
It's beyond awkward
Valentin looks to the sky, sees the crows circling again
Without further hesitation, Tolstoy picks up the pen and signs the document
Then he moves away from the group
Valentin watches him
84
84 Valentin and Tolstoy water their horses at a stream
Tolstoy seems weary
Maybe we should get back
It'll be dark soon
May  ask you something that has nothing to do with work
Of course, my dear
Do you love your wife
" Your youth and your desire for happiness reminds me cruelly of my age and the impossibility of happiness for me
" When  was courting Sofya, she was so young and pure, it seemed impossible that 'd ever have her
didn't want to tell her how felt and  wanted to tell her nothing else
So  wrote down a string of letters and asked her if she could decipher them
She looked completely confused, thinking it was a game or
66
Tolstoy looks into the middle distance, remembering his love
gave her one clue
The first two 's,  said, stand for "your youth" and then the most miraculous thing happened
She simply spoke the phrase, my phrase
Tolstoy looks at Valentin as if the boy might offer some explanation of the miraculous
as if she had read my mind
In that moment, we both knew we would always be together
For those first years, we were incredibly happy, terrifyingly happy
His old eyes are wet
And now this
Tolstoy reaches into his boot, extracts his
He takes a pen from his shirt, begins to write
Valentin is amazed
85
85 Valentin exhausted, sits at the long table
Chertkov appears at his office door
Thank you again, Valentin Fedorovich, for your forethought
'm a secretary, after all
Chertkov let's it go
You know  had thought for a time to suggest that Leo Nikolayevich look for someone else
But
he said no
He said "He reminds me of myself when  was young
" He goes
After a moment, Valentin gets up and goes to the study door
'm leaving Telyatinki
67
Really
am going to Moscow
She is leading you around the nose
Look, you say the movement's about love- Yes
The love he tells us to practice, the love of the Gospels
Why do  have to explain this
Perfect love
Eternal love
The love that binds mankind together
But 've never met mankind, only men and women, imperfect men, imperfect women
Leo Nikolayevich also teaches us love can not be weakminded
Go
You won't be missed
a naive sentimentalist Valentin looks at him for a long moment, then bursts out laughing, walks away Why are you laughing
You think 'm ridiculous
'm laughing because  didn't sneeze
86                                                       86 87                                                       87 88                                                       88 68

89 Tolstoy has fallen asleep at his desk, his open before him
Sofya enters without knocking
He bolts up groggily, tries to hide the little book
Sofya, meanwhile, holds up the letter in her hand
Lyovochka
Prozeveskeny wants to purchase the rights to your work after your death
Then  shall try and die as soon as is convenient
Don't be silly
They've offered one million rubles
Silence
How can you not be pleased
don't write for publishers write for people
He gets up from his desk
Where are you going
Valentin's in the library
He's asked to speak to me
Splendid
while your wretched family is left to starve
don't see anyone starving in this house
On the contrary, our privilege revolts me
He goes
She calls after him
But you're always first to the trough
always have been
Sofya sinks into his chair
On the desk is the photograph of herself and Tolstoy that we saw her hang on the wall in the early part of the film
She looks at the wall
There in it's place is the offending photograph of  that she had removed earlier
69
She can fix that
But as she picks up the photo of her and her husband, she notices   ,   , lying under it
She begins to read
90
90 Valentin waits on the sofa
Tolstoy walks in, goes to him
What is it, dear boy
You look unhappy
What do you want to say
But before Valentin can respond
91                                                          91 92
/
92 Sofya sits in a chair, firing shot after shot at the photograph of Chertkov
Tolstoy and Valentin enter
Sofya, what are you doing
She turns toward him, waves the gun in his direction
Valentin ducks against the wall
How could you do this to me
You're not well
You hurt me again and again
You take little pieces of me until become nothing
don't know who am anymore
(beat) read your diary
know what you've done
You behave like this,  have no choice
Now give me the gun
No
Give me the gun
Give it to me, please
70
Sofya throws the gun at her husband
She runs out of the room
We see the shattered photograph of Chertkov
After a moment, Tolstoy into his chair
Valentin watches him in silence
'd like you to stay here tonight
Yes, of course
With that, the old man gets up and leaves the room, leaving Valentin in the wreckage of his world
93
93 The wind blows the trees around the old house
We see a lighted lamp move up the stairs
94
94 Valentin in his makeshift bed
(
) Valentin
Valentin
He is immediately awake
Sasha, lamp in hand, crouches beside him
Get up
He's leaving
What
He s leaving
95
' /
95 Bags are being prepared
Sasha is packing clothes
Essentials only
Nothing that isn't absolutely necessary
Valentin struggles to close a case full of books and papers
Please
we must hurry
71
Where will you go
No one responds
Dushan comes to Tolstoy, sits down and begins the ritual taking of the pulse
Meanwhile, Sasha wraps a heavy fur coat around his shoulders
She smiles at him
Absolutely essential
lantern,  think
It's very dark tonight
(beat) And the apparatus for giving an enema
96
96 The horses are hitched to the droshky, the bags are up on the back
Everything's ready
Dushan climbs into the carriage
Tolstoy turns abruptly and walks back toward the house
Papa
He's changed his mind
He's going back to the house
They watch as Tolstoy kneels on the wet grass, bending low to rub his hands against the earth
After a moment, Valentin goes to him, kneels next to him
Do you want to go back
When  was a boy, my brother Nikolai once brought me to a place when  was a boy
He told me he'd found a green stick with some words on it
the secret to happiness for all men everywhere
He hid it in the ground
looked for it very often
've looked for it all these years
really believed  would find it here
but  never did
72
Tolstoy looks at him
never did
but this life is behind me now
He kisses the ground of his beloved home, gets up and they walk back to the droshky
Help me up, will you
As they go, he hands Valentin an envelope
Give this to Sofya
will
They reach the carriage
Sasha embraces him, kisses him over and over
Be well
Be well
Don't cry
'll send for you when can
They help him up onto the droshky and the carriage starts slowly away from the old house
97
97 Out in front of the house, an old peasant woman pulls the feathers off a chicken
Over her impassive face, we hear deep, heavy sobs
98
98 Sofya is in a rage
Sasha sits nearby
'm simply telling you what happened
He's gone
have no idea where
Nobody does
You're a liar
(beat) Liar
Sasha won't rise to the bait
Valentin comes into the room
73
So, he's gone
(to Bulgakov) For good
think so, yes
There is a pause
Sofya suddenly smiles, becomes solicitous
Darling Sasha, where is your father
know you know
Please, please
Don't play games with me
Now it s not the moment
Honestly,  have no idea
'
have this for you
It is a letter
She grabs it, as if it is something that might feed a terrible hunger at the center of her
Moving into a corner, she tears it open and begins to read
They both watch Sofya's passion
Her face quivers, the muscles in her neck stand out
Her shoulders begin to shake
Crumbling the paper in her hand, she twists her head and screams
Then, gathering up her dress, she runs out the door
Sasha move immediately to the window
From her
, we see Sofya streaking across the lawn
They look at each other The pond
They run out
99
99 Sofya sprints away from the house and into the trees couple of servants join the chase, Ivan and , a fat manservant
Valentin, head of the group, sees Sofya move out of the birches
She's heading straight to the pond
74
Sasha suddenly steams past him
Mama, Mama
Stop
Not this
Hurry
Hurry
Countess
100
100 Sofya has reached the bathhouse
Peasant women watch her as they do their wash
She glances back her pursuers, races on
Tiring now, she goes to her knees
She crawls along the jetty toward the water
At the edge of the jetty, she falls on her back then turns over, most ungracefully, and rolls off sideways into the pond
Sofya sinks into the black water
The sound of her rescuers fades away and is replaced by Tolstoy's voice, reading the farewell note she still clutches in her hand
(
) My position in the house has become intolerable
What 'm doing now is what people have commonly done - leave their worldly life behind to spend their last days in peace and solitude
She floats, strangely relaxed, beneath the water
(
) beg you to forgive me for everything 've done to you, just as  forgive you with all my soul for everything you've done to me
The silence is suddenly ripped apart by the rescuers
Sasha and Valentin jumping into the pond
Sasha, barely able to swim herself, thrashes in the water
Sasha, go back to the jetty
Here, let me help you
He offers his arm, using it to push her to safety
No
She's drowning
Help her
75
will
will
Stay here
With that, he pushes away from the dock and makes a sharp plunge under the water
Sasha watches, waits
and after a long moment Valentin surfaces pulling Sofya with him
On the dock, the servants and Sasha help him to get her heavy body , water soaked dress, back onto the bank
She looks terrible
Her tongue lolling out, water drizzling from her open mouth
Sasha is overcome
She's dead
My mother
She's dead
Ivan takes action
He rolls her on to her stomach, works to expel water from her lungs
This goes on for an agonizing length of time
Valentin looks to the sky
dull and gray
Then a sound, coughing sputtering
She is alive
Sasha, Valentin, and the servants help up
Let me take you to the house, mother
Let me die
Please
Why would you rob me of that
Let's go to the house
Sofya is suddenly clear, almost calm
Ivan, go to the station
Find out which train the master took
Ivan looks at Sasha for approval
see no harm in it
Let's get her to bed
Valentin nods
Ivan appears beside him
Life returns to torture her for awhile
He laughs out loud,then walks away
76
101
101 Sasha walks into dining room
Valentin pours them tea
She's exhausted herself
She's slept for nearly four hours
'm glad she can sleep
The pain subsides a little
The noise subsides a little
They smile at each other
Well, a little
Ivan comes down the stairs
He stops in the doorway
Come in
message, miss
For me
No, for your father
From the Countess, miss
She's allowed to send a note to my father
just don't know where to tell her to send it
She's addressed it to train number 9
That's the train the master took
The station master told me
Why are you giving it to me
She is allowed to send my father a note
Ivan steps forward and hands her the note to inspect
Sasha can't help but laugh
She never gives up
(reading the note) "Dearest papa
Return at once
() 77
(cont'd) Sasha
" She signed it with my name
Ingenious
Obvious
She pockets the note
Ivan continues to stand there
Sasha looks at him
Yes
He gave me this as well
the stationmaster
note for you
Sasha opens it, reads
She looks up, flushed with excitement
He's with my aunt
At the Shamardino
Sasha runs out of the room
102
102 Sasha, on horse back, rides up and by the camera and away down the alley of trees that lead away from the house
(
) They've all gone 103
103 Sitting at his desk, Valentin looks up to see Sofya standing in the doorway
She looks exhausted
'm here
She walks to his desk
You're writing to your girl
That's lovely
Sofya touches his shoulder with real affection, then walks across the room to her husband's desk
don't know if she's my girl
78
But you believe you'll see her again
very much hope so
Yes
Refuse to believe in the end of love
Do all you can to prevent it
Sofya picks up a photograph of the two of them, examines it
know you know where he is, Valentin
Valentin hesitates
She walks back to him
won't ask you to betray his trust
but  need you to go to him
do
have to see him have to talk to him
won't make a scene
Promise him that must see him
103A                                                       103A 104                                                        104 105                                                        105 106                                                        106 107                                                        107 108
108 Clouds of steam against the white sky
great black train travels through the bleak world 109
109 Tolstoy rests on the hard bench of the third class carriage he always insists on
He writes on his lapboard
We pan to an adjacent bench to find , now with them
He and Sasha have a map spread out in front of them
79
He's right, you know, to go
She will be right behind us
ve told you she has promised she wouldn t make any problems
But besides, where are we going
Tolstoy has overheard them
We don't need a plan, my dears, we'll simply go Dushan appears with several newspapers
As he hands them the papers, he reads the
Tolstoy looks up from the papers, smiles
guess our little secret is out
110                                                         110 111
111 Sofya sits surrounded by the papers
Andrey appears
There's a reporter outside from the Russian World
Tell him we've received an apologetic letter from your father
very embarrassed
We expect him back any day
But that's a lie, right
Yes, that's a lie
112
112 The huge iron wheels grind on
80
113
113 Tolstoy sleeps
People still crowd around him
Please move back
Please let him breath
Please give him some room
(to Valentin) He can t breath
Valentin, please
(to Dushan) The smoke is too much
know
Stay back
Tolstoy stirs
Where are we
It's alright
Everything's fine
He reaches out to touch Tolstoy's forehead
He goes pale
Where are we
Let me take your temperature
The old man lifts his shirt, takes the thermometer under his arm
Dushan reaches for his wrist
Valentin and Sasha look at each other, wait for the vital signs
He takes the thermometer from Tolstoy, reads it
He's clearly shaken
Good old Dushan,
you needn't worry
Remember, you are my doctor, not my angel
Whatever happens, it's not your fault
'm feeling much better now just need to sleep
Good, good
Yes
He drifts off again, Dushan stares at the thermometer
His eyes fill with tears
81
He will be fine
114
114 The train pulls into a small, dusty station,
Valentin and Dushan support, help him off the train
Sasha looks at the sad, empty platform
We've come to the end of the world
115
115 Dushan and Tolstoy sit on a bench on the platform
Sasha and Valentin appear
The stationmaster says we may have his house for as long as we need it
There are no inns nearby, so we're lucky
Very lucky
Yes
They help Tolstoy up
little bearded man, the station master, waits to escort them
You'll be comfortable here, papa
The rest of us
we'll find cots or sleep in the station
And then we'll be on our way
116                                                         116 117                                                         117 118
118 Valentin approaches the operator
Hello, hello
Could you send a cable for me
82
119
119 message comes over the cable machine
(
) Tolstoy ill at Astapovo
Temperature high
Send it to Sofya Andreyevna, Yasnaya Polyana
120
120 Sofya paces
Andrey lolls on the couch reading the paper
We must leave at once
We'll make inquiries in the morning, mother
We'll rent a train
That'll cost a fortune
Don't say irrelevant things, Andrey
It's unbecoming
Contact someone
'll go and pack
Rent a train
God
121
121 Press and various hangers on have begun to arrive at Astapovo
Outside the station master's house, Dushan gives an update, temperature, pulse
Valentin emerges from the telegraph office, telegrams and cables in his hands
long passenger train pulls in from the north
There's general commotion at the new arrival
"The Countess
" "Is it the Countess
"
More press, a cinematographer lugging his gear and
He spots Valentin
There is no greeting, no embrace
Bulgakov
Where is he
Take me to him
As they make their way across the tracks, Chertkov can barely contain his glee
83
He left
astonishing
He actually, finally left
He wasn't well enough to travel
It's very cold
Chertkov doesn't hear, He's basking in his victory
It's a triumph for the movement
122
'
122 Valentin leads Chertkov through the door
Chertkov stops short, whispers He looks so small
Now, Tolstoy sees him, wakes up, smiles
Papa
It's(hic)you
The men embrace
Tears roll down the both men's cheeks
Tolstoy continues to hiccup throughout
My dear friend, waht is all of this
needed (hic) to see you
Thank you
We have so much (hic) to do
(hic)  m sorry
Damn hic ups
(beat) Have you seen Sofya
've made a point not to
don't know when (hic) she'll come
But she'll come (hic) know it
And we'll be ready
Ready for what
84
Chertkov doesn't respond
'm sorry, but it's time for your enema
Don't apologize, my friend
Your enemas(hic)have become the news of the world
(smiles) Now, all of you, help turn me over
123
'
123 Everyone is asleep
Valentin keeps a vigil at Tolstoy's bedside
His rest is fitful, his breathing ragged
Valentin stands and walks out
124
124 Valentin approaches the little window
'd like to send another cable
The man nods, readies his pencil
At Astapovo
Stop
Tolstoy Ill
Stop
Heart breaking
Stop
Please Come
That's it
The man looks to him for an address
It goes to Masha
to Maria Filipovna Melinov, Moscow
Thank you
125
125 The media circus is in town
There are snack bars and huts, an army camp with typewriters instead of guns
Several news cameras are set up near the stationmaster's house
Tents have been erected as make shift shelters and offices
Reporters struggle to get into the telegraph office
Word goes around something big is happening
At the platform, we see the highly polished private train pull in
The Countess has arrived
85
in her handsome traveling clothes
An unctuous little orthodox priest follows her out of the train
If the Count should have a change of heart
if in the last moment he chooses to confess, mother church is there to embrace him with open arms
She nods
'll see what  can do, father
She moves with purpose across the tracks and through the throng Reporters pelt her with questions
126
'
126 Chertkov, Sasha and Valentin watch through the window
She's coming this way
Chertkov starts to put on his coat
Not before she stops to tell them lies, catalogue my atrocities
Let me speak to her
He heads toward the door
127
127 Sofya has reached the edge of the platform where gives his medical update, temperature and pulse, to the press
She pulls Dushan aside
Reporters surround them
want to see my husband
Yes 'll
uhm
want to see him
Now
Dushan is terrified
Valentin arrives at the platform
Countess
86
Valentin
Will you help me have to see him
Please
Of course
But 'm not certain if it s the best time, Countess
She starts toward the building
It is
It's the right time for me
Sofya Andreyevna
(to the crowd) Stay back, stay back
128
'
128 As Valentin arrives outside the door, he see Sofya physically recoil
She is confronted by Chertkov and Sasha blocking the door
want to see my husband
Members of the press, crowd `round trying to listen
He's too weak now, mother
But he's not too weak to see you
Not too weak to see that
She gestures in Chertkov's direction
The passion attracts more onlookers
Do you really want to do this here
She does her best to ignore him
am the leper outside the gate, while he sleeps with the devil himself
Vladimir Gregorovich is here because father asked him to be here
87
This stops Sofya for a moment
She looks to Valentin
Is that true
Valentin nods
She tries another tack
Have you told him  nearly drowned in the pond
We didn't have to
It was in all the papers
Valentin is very aware of the publicness of it all
Let me take you back
But she plows on
What did he say
That if you killed yourself, he'd be upset
He'd be upset
Horribly upset
but he could not have acted other than he did
Sofya begins to sob
want to see him
(beat) He's not your husband
He's my husband
You're unbearable
Sasha goes back toward the door
And you are a stone-hearted bitch of a daughter
Sasha disappears back inside
Sofya screams after her
88
lost five children
Why couldn't one of them have been you
Chertkov watches, makes little attempt to conceal his pleasure
Are you finished
pause
Sofya is suddenly aware of the crowd around her
Valentin, will you take me back
Valentin nods
Yes, of course
Sofya takes his arm, starts back across the platform
Shaken, she tries her best to maintain her dignity as she walks through the crowd
She leans against Valentin, whispers
've behaved badly, haven't
No, Countess, Don't worry
Not at all
Around her, journalists ask questions, photographers call out "Turn to us, Countess
" "Show us your eyes
" 129                                                          129 130
130 Valentin, in his wrinkled suit, is asleep in a chair
He wakes to see Sofya stretched out on the sofa
He watches her
She doesn't stir
After a moment, he goes out
131
131 Valentin emerges from the telegraph office
He walks along the platform, a stack of letter and telegrams in his hands
few reporters type their early morning dispatches
132                                                          132 133                                                          133 89

134 Valentin comes into the room, acknowledges Chertkov who sits at his makeshift desk going through letters and cables
He goes to the bedside, stops next to Dushan
Silence, interrupted only by Tolstoy's incessant hiccups
Valentin notices Dushan is on the verge of tears
What is it
Dushan, what s wrong
Listen to him
'm supposed to be a doctor, for God's sake
Weak, feverish, Tolstoy sits up in bed
Sasha moves to help him
Sofya
What is it
What is it
Valentin goes to Tolstoy
He's in a kind of panic
Chertkov comes into the room
She's come, hasn't she
She`s here
He points to the corner
But it is nothing, a gray shape thrown by a coat rack
You're imagining things
It's true, Leo Nikolayevich
Sasha
where's your mother
Tolstoy's eyes fill with tears
Valentin looks to Sasha
She looks from him to Chertkov
She's at home
If she wanted to see me couldn't refuse her
(beat) Is she going to come here
All eyes are on Sasha
90
don't think so
don't know, Papa
There's no way to
To what
Will she waiver
long, agonizing beat
She's at home
'm sure of it
Valentin looks at the floor
At home
Yes, Papa
Tolstoy nods, pats Sasha's hand
Very beautiful isn't it
Our home
Yes
He leans back against the pillow and drifts again
Sasha gets up and goes outside
After a moment, Valentin follows
135
'
135 Valentin sees her leaning against the wall
She's in pain
He said to me once
"you're like your mother
You're so full of anger
" She turns to him
know it's terrible
but who will protect him
don't want him to die
Valentin touches her face, goes back inside and into 91
136
'
136 Where Chertkov has made a makeshift office
He pores through the cables, letters and telegrams that litter the station master's dining table
He holds one up for Valentin
Kind thoughts from George Bernard Shaw
Valentin walks to the table
You lied to him
Keep your voice down
He wants to see her
You heard him say it
What exactly do you think she will bring him
don t know, they ve been married for 48 years
ll tell you what she ll bring
Vanity, fuss and noise
She promised me- What
Promised you what
You ve seen her at close quarters, boy
You think she s capable of restraining herself
They have a whole life togehter
Why do you have to deny that
You're a victim of her romantic nonsense
You seem to forget she wants to destroy everything we do
She travels with that unctious little priest
Keep the priest away- 92
These people are vultures
They send in at the last moment and welcome him back to the church
That's their fantasy
(beat) death bed recantation
Do you have any idea the damage it would do
Everything he's dreamed of, everything we've worked for will be gone
simple noble death is what we want
It is what he wants
No, you want an icon
You want to take photographs and give out postcards
You want people to kneel in front of an image you ve created
But he doesn t wanted that
He never wanted that, and it will give him no peace
(beat) He wants to see her
let her come
They see Sasha looking from the door
She turns and closes it
will do everything in my power to prevent that
Oh, God
You exhaust me
used to think you were just naive, Valentin, maybe a little stupid
see now you're more dangerous than she is
He turns back at the door
Tell me one thing
That image you want to create, just looks like you, doesn t it
Valentin leaves the room
137
137 The circus sleeps
Valentin sits on a bench outside the station master's house
The tents erected by the press glow like lanterns in the field
93
Some people lie on the hard platform
He looks across the tracks at Sofya's private car
single light burns in the window 138
138 Sofya keeps her solitary vigil
The priest has fallen asleep sitting up
She finishes her prayers, gets up, looks across at the lonely cottage
She can make out Valentin's figure on the platform
139
139 Dushan appears in the doorway
Solemn, he gestures for him to come inside
Valentin stands
140
140 Sofya watches the two figures disappear inside
141
'
141 Valentin sees Chertkov standing near the bed
Dushan returns to the chair next to Tolstoy
His cheeks are damp, his breathing irregular
It can't be right
His fever is down
His pulse, you see
Dushan begins to cry
Suddenly, Tolstoy becomes lucid
Sofya
my dear Sofya
So much has (hic) fallen to her
Everyone moves nearer the bed
Tolstoy looks at Valentin
Who's going to look after her
(beat) Someone needs to look after her
There is a long pause
Sasha looks at Valentin
Shall  call her
This is it(hic)
The end
94
He seems to smile
Do you want to see her, papa
Sasha, Sasha
It's(hic)nothing
Nothing
He falls onto his pillow, asleep
It's almost over
Sasha looks at him, shakes her head
can't do this anymore
He won t know who she is anyway
142
142 Everyone sleeps but Sofya
There is a knock on the door
Sofya opens it
It is Sasha
pause
Has he asked for me
want you to come
Take a coat
It's cold
143
'
143 Sofya and Sasha walk to the door
The reporter calls out Countess
Countess
Do you have any information
Countess
Is he dying
Is he dead
Sasha takes her mother's hand
144
'
144 She steps into the room
For a moment, she seems overwhelmed at the sight of him
She looks at Valentin, who nods at her as if to say go on
Sofya walks past Chertkov without acknowledging him
Dushan lets go his hold of Tolstoy's wrist and gets out of the chair, out of her way
She approaches her sleeping, husband, the love of her life, her cross, her everything
95
Lyovochka
There is no response
She throws her arms around him
Please forgive me, my darling
Mother
'm a fool
'm a selfish woman
But  love you
Please believe me
Please understand me
Please forgive me for all my weakness and badness
Please
Please
Love me
Mother
Sasha takes her hand, whispers
Control yourself
Was  shouting
You have to control yourself
Sofya looks around and sits back
Strangely, she does control herself
She becomes very still
She takes her husband's hand, begins quietly to speak to him
You don't speak, but  hear you
She carries on two sides of an impossible conversation
"Do you love me, Lyovochka
" (beat) "Never stopped, my little bird
" (beat) "And you will never stop" (beat) "Never
" (beat) "Nor ever leave me again
" (beat) "Never, ever again
(beat) "Good
good
let's go home" 96
She sits very still holding her husband's hand
Then, it seems she feels the slightest of movements, the slightest squeeze of her hand
She looks down to see Tolstoy open his eyes
He looks at her for a moment, the hint of a smile, then closes his eyes again
Valentin sees it, glances at Sasha
Then, he begins to fight for breath
First cessation
general sense of panic at the proximity of death
Tolstoy fights for a last breath
Second cessation
Sofya whispers quietly to her dying husband
Please forgive me if  cry a little now
Tolstoy continues to struggle, then silence, silence
Sasha starts to sob
Sofya reaches out to her daughter
Sasha comes to her mother who holds her
She feels someone next to her
She looks up
It's Chertkov
am sorry, Sofya Andreyevna
The most unlikely thing, she pats his hand
It's alright
What happens from now on
it will never really matter
Not really
Everything's finished
Chertkov sits beside them
She turns to Dushan
Dushan, could you tell them your great friend is gone
Yes
He nods, walk out into the dawn light to tell the world Leo Tolstoy is dead
97
145
145 sizeable crowd has assembled, the usual reporters, photographers, cinematographers, but students, too, and soldiers, factory workers, housewives
Dushan faces the crowd
Quiet
Quiet
At ten minutes after six in the morning, a great soul passed from our world
Leo Nikoleyevich Tolstoy is dead
As Dushan finishes his tribute, a single voice begins to sing the old Russian hymn, Eternal Memory
Gradually, more and more of the crowd picks it up
Valentin begins to sing
His eyes run over the crowd of mourners
Then, something stops the flow of his gaze
His eyes fill with tears
Masha
Masha
She walks slowly toward him out of the crowd
He goes to her, takes her in a long embrace
Masha
Masha
'm so sorry he's gone
He s gone
Yes
Yes
know, but  came for you, Valya
came for you, too
love you
do
love you
Then, hold me
Hold me
Hold me
The song, the voices swell around them
They hold each other like they will never let go
146
146 black draped funeral train waits in the station
Many mourners are congregated on the platform
Chertkov comes out of the little house, followed by Andrey, Valentin and Dushan carrying Tolstoy's coffin to the train
Sofya appears with Sasha, who escorts her through the crowd
The Orthodox priest approaches
98
As a daughter of the church, 'm sure you wouldn't object to my saying a few words at the funeral
Sofya stares at him for a long moment
My husband needs no justification
Besides, it s been enough talking as it is
Thank you, father
She climbs onto the train
147
147 Sofya settles into the comfort of the private car
She sits next to Sasha
Andrey and Dushan are near her
There's a noise from outside
(
) Countess
Countess
She looks out
Below the train window, Valentin and Masha stand hand in hand
She gets up and opens the window
148
148 Excuse me, Countess
This may not be the time, but- Sofya smiles Valentin
and who's this
Masha
this is Masha
Sofya nods
This is your girl
Good
Good
Is there anything  can do for you
No, no
Not at all
just wanted to say good bye
Yes
Good bye, good bye
God bless you
99
God bless you, too
149
149 Sofya sits back down with Sasha
They hold hands
Well, 'm ready to go now
(to Andrey) Why aren t we moving
Can't someone make it move
But at that moment, the train begins to move
Oh
150
150 Sofya looks out the window, sees the people lined up along the rail, mourn her loss
As she looks away, we see the people reflected in the glass, some of them kneel, some of them remove their hats
Valentin watches the train pull away
He holds Masha to him
As the train   moves slowly through the corridor of mourners, some of them   fall in and walk behind it
The camera travels up and up as   the train travels north taking Sofya and her husband back   to Yasnaya Polyana
