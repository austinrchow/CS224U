We  on a taxi pulling up and stopping, The driver hands out modest looking luggage, including a bunch of tennis rackets in cases to a redcap
as the passenger gets out of the taxi so that we see only his shoes and the lower part of his trousers
He is wearing dark colored brogues and a conservative suit apparently
The feet move toward, the entrance to the station and out of scene
Immediately a chauffeur-driven limousine drives up and an expensive place of airplane luggage is handed out of this, and the passenger alighting from the back is seen to be wearing black and white sport shoes which, as before, are all we see of him
The sport shoes start off in the wake of the brogues
the sport shoes and the brogues across the lobby into a passenger tunnel
There is the usual activity of passengers walking to and from, a loud-speaker announcing trains, etc
As the brogues and the sport shoes emerge to the train platform,   them over to the steps of the train
The brogues and the sport shoes pass separately down the aisle, the sport shoes turning in at a compartment door and the brogues continuing toward the parlor car
: () The brogues come to rest before a chair as the owner sits down
moment later the sport shoes come to rest

The legs belonging to the sport shoes stretch out, and one of the shoes touches one of the brogues
'  (over scene) Oh, excuse Me
to  two young men seated in two parlor car chairs
BRUN0 , the wearer of the sport shoes, is about twenty-five
He wears his expensive clothes with the tweedy nonchalance of a young man who has always had the best
The wearer of the brogues is a fine looking but, at the moment, a somewhat troubled young man
This is He, too, is in his middle twenties and is well dressed because he can now afford to be
He nods politely, acknowledging Bruno's apology, then turns away with the gesture implying he wants privacy
(smiling with sudden recognition) beg your pardon, but aren't you Guy Haines
Guy nods with a polite half smile
Being a well known tournament tennis player, he has had this sort of experience before
(snapping his finger) Sure
saw you blast Faraday right off the court in South Orange last season
What a backhand
Made the semi-finals, didn't you
Guy acknowledges this with a modest nod and turns to his magazine rolled up in is fist

(with an apologetic grin) don't usually talk so much
Go Ahead and read
(wryly) Thanks
Guy tries to read but is uneasily aware of Bruno's open appraisal
It must be pretty exciting to be so important
(fidgeting slightly) tennis player isn't so important
People who do things are important
never seem to do anything
Not knowing how to answer this, Guy looks a little embarrassed
(still insistent on being friendly) suppose you're going to Southampton -- for the doubles
(politely) You are a tennis fan
Bruno is inordinately pleased by this small tribute
Wish  could see you play

At the appeal on Bruno's face, Guy slowly relents
That's all right

Bruno smiles with and signals a waiter
There's a new cure for that

Bruno slips the lighter into hip pocket to free his hands for the bills which he gives to the waiter, waving away the change
He offers a glass to Guy
Guy takes it

Bruno has been drinking and his eyes are bright and feverish
An almost empty liquor bottle is near a couple of detective novels covered with gaudily Illustrated dust jackets
Bruno has in unlighted cigarette in his mouth
Guy's lighter is on the table
Bruno snaps it a couple of times, as though fascinated, lights his cigarette and puts the lighter on the table again
Sure,  went to college
Three of them
Every time they kicked me out my father threw me back in
(bitterly) He finally gave up
He thinks 'm awfully small fry, not worth the bait
(wistfully) You my friend, Guy
Sure
'm your friend, Bruno
(a little woozy) No, you're not, nobody thinks 'm anything special
Only my mother
(empties the bottle into his glass) My father hates me
Guy smiles this off as nonsense
You must be imagining things
(hitting the bottom of the bottle for the last drop) And  hate him
He thinks    ought to catch the eight-five bus  every morning, punch a timeclock  and work my way up selling paint or  something

You're lucky
You're smart
Marrying the boss's daughter is a nice short cut to a career, isn't it

Miriam
That's it
Miriam Joyce Haines
Played around a lot,  suppose
Let's not talk about it any more
(almost hopefully) Maybe she'll make more trouble for you
don't think so
You mean you got enough on her to get your divorce no matter what
Let's change subject, Bruno, can't we
Okay, Guy
Want me to tell you one of my ideas for murdering my father
(indicating the detective novels) You've been reading too many of these
(going right on) You want to hear about the busted light socket in the bathroom, or the carbon monoxide in the garage
No
may be old fashioned, but thought murder was against the law
Converted to  by www

But not against the law of nature
My theory is that everybody is a potential murderer
Didn't you ever want to kill somebody
Say one of those useless fellows Miriam was running around with
You can't go around killing people just because you think they're useless
Oh, what's a life or two
Some people are bitter off dead, Guy
Take your -- wife and my father, for instance
It reminds me of a wonderful idea had once
used to put myself to sleep at night -- figuring it out
Now, let's say you want to get rid of your wife
Why
Let's say she refuses to give you a divorce -- (raises a finger and stops Guy's protest) Let's say
You'd be afraid to kill her because you'd get caught
And what would trip you up
Motive
Now here's the plan
'm afraid  haven't time to listen
(ignoring the remark) It's so simple, too
couple of fellows meet accidentally, like you and me
No connection between them at all
Never saw each other before
Each of them has somebody he'd like to get rid of, but he can't murder the person he wants to get rid of
He'll get caught
So they swap murders
Swap murders

Each fellow does the other fellow's murder
Then there is nothing to connect them
The one who had the motive isn't there
Each fellow murders a total stranger
Like you do my murder and  do yours
(with relief) We're coming into my station
For example, your wife, my father
Criss-cross

(preparing to leave) Sure, we talk the same language
Thanks for the lunch

Guy is in a hurry but he shakes hands

Typical music shop of a small town, with plate glass windows and displays of radios, records, sheet music, etc
Activity of a couple of customers and salespeople inside
Guy comes along the street and goes into the shop
As Guy enters
There are the usual counters and shelves, pianos and radios on display, and the sound of a piano being tuned in the back of the store
is finishing with a customer at a counter
, the manager, is busy at the shelves
Another girl clerk is serving a customer
In one of the glass cubicles where records are tried out, a customer is playing symphonic music; in a second glass cubicle another customer is listening to a record of popular music
third cubicle is empty
Activity of the street is seen through the plate glass front
Guy walks straight to Miriam, just as she is finishing with her woman customer, handing over a small package
(taking money from customer) Even change
Thank you, Madam
(she looks up at Guy as the woman moves off) Well -- hello, Guy
You're looking well, Miriam
Miriam's face is pretty because it is still young
She is self-centered and inclined to be vindictive
She wears harlequin glasses with myopic lenses which tend to make her eyes look small
So are you
You've got a nice tan, playing tennis with all your rich friends

You're the one who's in a hurry, aren't you
(coyly) When you wouldn't give me the divorce right away,  sort of hoped it was because you were a little bit jealous
(biting) got over being jealous, a long time ago Miriam
Miriam's eyes slide toward the other girl clerk who has moved closer, within listening range
(indicating empty glass cubicle) Let's talk in there
Guy follows Miriam across to the empty room
Miriam has brought her purse along
They enter
Once inside, the sounds of the music playing from other parts of the shop are heard but very faintly
The piano tuning still goes on, but less stridently
Miriam and Guy are cooped together in the close quarters
(intimately) Now this is cosier
Sort of like old times, isn't it, Guy
(coldly) Oh, skip it, Miriam

Come out with it

It's a woman's privilege to change her mind
Now  can shop for some pretty clothes

Think it over
Who would believe you
Guy seizes her angrily and in so doing, knocks the tone arm across the record with a loud screech
From outside we can see heads turn
Mr
Hargreaves, the manager, is very disturbed
' We see Guy gripping Miriam's arms and apparently addressing her in a threatening manner, although we do not hear his words
The smile has faded from Miriam's face and something like cringing fear has taken its place
She is drawn and tense and seems to cower beneath Guy's rage
Mr
Hargreaves moves forward and opens Guy's tirade
That's what should happen to people like you
And if

This isn't the place for a family quarrel

He starts to exit from the booth
Miriam grabs his arm and screams at him: (yelling like a fishwife) You heard what  said, Guy Haines

The two customers in other booths, seeing the quarrel, open their doors simultaneously and Miriam's tirade is climaxed by a cacophony of noise, a big symphony, loud hot music, and the apparently unaware piano tuner
Guy is striding along angrily
He comes to the same intersection and the same cop
The officer makes a friendly gesture, is if he'd like to talk awhile, but Guy strides past him without noticing
() Guy comes into the scene, crosses to a row of public telephone booths, enters one
Inside the telephone booth, he dumps some loose change on the shelf, sticks a nickel in the telephone, speaks into it
Long distance

The number is Republic 0800
Person to person

Another pause, very long
Guy is very restless
He digs a cigarette out of his pocket and sticks it in his mouth, then looks through his pockets for his lighter, doesn't find it
He looks puzzled, but about that time the operator speaks to him
(continuing) Right
Guy picks coins up off the shelf and drops them into the telephone, then waits
He shifts the receiver and fumbles in his other jacket pocket, then turns to the phone

But she can't do that to you, Guy -- it's unbelievable -- it's, it's evil

She is working with scissors, file and nail buffer

He looks about him for   a moment and then strolls away in the direction of the town
He approaches the row of telephone booths
We see Bruno enter the small booth and start to glance through the telephone directory
Bruno's finger runs down the names until it stops at: Joyce, Miriam Haines

It is now much later
It is beginning to get dark, and the street lights are on
In the far distance we see a local bus approaching
onto a small seat by a bus stop, we see Bruno with an open newspaper in front of him
It is held up as he reads it
Bruno is glancing over the top of the paper
From his viewpoint we   see a typical frame house

At this moment the front door swings open, emitting a long streak ot bright light
We see the silhouette of a woman emerge, followed by two other men
They're laughing and joking
Suddenly they look up the street
At this very moment the bus pulls up in front of Bruno's view, cutting off the sight of his quarry
The bus comes to a stop
Bruno rises in alarm and moves around toward the end of the bus so that he shall not lose sight of the girl coming out of the house
- From his viewpoint, the girl, whom we now see is Miriam, is running followed by the two young men

These include Miriam nd her companions, and Bruno
We see the usual midway with its various concessions on each side: in the distance the Ferris wheel, Merry-go-rounds, etc
, and beyond that a lake
In the foreground we see people filling in and out
: This group comprises Miriam and her two boy-friends
They lick their way out of the crowd and debate between themselves where to go next

The small boy points the gun at Bruno
- The small boy pointing the gun fires it twice with a couple of 'bangs
' He then starts to move off
- Bruno moves on past the boy
He casually touches the balloon with his cigarette end -- it goes off with a 'pop'
The small boy turns and looks with dismay at his pricked balloon, wondering what happened
- Bruno moves on, pleased with himself, returning his attention to Miriam who is somewhere ahead of him

Bruno steps into the foreground and gets into the next boat which floats alongside
He, too, moves away into the darkness
As Miriam's boat passes through, she gives another little glance over shoulder before her boat disappears into the darkness of the tunnel
After a brief moment Bruno's boat comes into the picture, and it, too, goes into the tunnel
We see the silhouettes of the occupants of Miriam's boat on the wall of the tunnel, lit dimly from the light coming from the tunnel exit
The silhouette of Bruno in his boat, lit by the tunnel entrance, gradually approaches the other three
When the silhouettes are almost touching, we -- : It is empty
There is a sudden piercing scream from inside, followed after a second or two by protestations and giggling as Miriam's boat emerges into the light

His head moves a bit farther until Miriam's face is nearly uncovered at the other side of the screen, and we see her glasses fall off

He gets in and is quickly chugging away
He moves calmly, matter-of- fact and not furtively

There are two boats unloading
Bruno's boat is approaching
We hear a loud call from the island
Someone has found Miriam

Bruno by this time has stopped onto the landing stage, and in company with the other people, is looking back as if to see what's wrong on the island
Then he moves away, starting off of the landing stage

He takes one step into the roadway, then hesitates

Guy and a secretary have set up office in the Morton study
As the scene opens the secretary is handing Guy a large envelope
Here's a special delivery, Mr
Haines
It's marked personal
As Guy is opening the envelope, Barbara speaks to him from atop a library ladder
She is getting a book from one of the top shelves of a bookcase, which is next to a window
Are you getting in any practice today, Guy
(as he takes out a large folded sheet of paper and glances at it, mystified) Yes, if  can get a court at the club
As Guy's hands unfold the paper and hold it for moment, we see that it is a diagrammed plan of the grounds and the Interior of the Anthony house
There are dotted lines along the upper hall, with an arrow which points to one room and where Bruno has indicated in his handwriting, "My father's room
" Over this we hear the voices of Barbara and the secretary: ' Barbara, who are you waving at

One head is not moving

At this moment, we hear the umpire calling, "Game, set and match" to the winning mixed doubles pair
His expression becomes set
The mixed doubles couples complete their handshaking at the net and move off the court
We see Guy move up to the base line while the other player takes his position for the preliminary knock-up

He gives another weak little smile
In response to the Frenchwoman's attentive and eager expression, Bruno leans forward on the table and starts saying something more in extremely fluent French
She is staring at Bruno with a new expression
' Bruno's coat has spread open a bit, and his tie pin bearing the name "Bruno" is resting on the edge of the table
She becomes aware that this is the man she has seen call to Guy in the art museum, that they have met before

Guy slowly edges past him and the Great Dane's head turns to watch him

He takes out his flash and identifies the door with his plan

The first one is clearly marked: " room

Guy, threading his way through the crowds, conscious that he is being followed, but nevertheless, on the lookout for Bruno
moving along the line

There is an expression of growing recognition on his face

His hand, which is on the starting lever, jerks it down
The detective, after Guy, jumps on the machine but is flung off on his back
The merry-go-round has now started to increase the speed
Bruno at the far side is trying to jump off, but it's going too fast
