Written by Nick Schenk : We're at the funeral of Dorothy Kowalski
In attendance are mostly old folks, their offspring and several bored teenagers
stands towards the front of the church
He speaks to an older  in a bulky, out-of-date suit
'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt
She was a real peach
Thanks for coming, Al
Walt Kowalski looks young for his age
He has slate blue eyes, physically fit and has had the same buzz cut hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953
Walt is also a perfectionist
Nothing escapes his hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge
Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at his wife's funeral
His eyes narrow at his 's belly button ring
Jesus Christ
Walt's two sons,  and , watch their father from across the pews
Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley
He can't even tone it down at Mom's funeral
What do you expect
Dad's still living in the 50s
He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly
Yeah, well your kid's wearing a Timberwolves jersey
'm sure Dad appreciates that
My point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the Old Man
() () 3 It's inevitable
That's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings; the deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath, it's always something
What are we going to do with him
Don't you think he'll get in trouble by himself over in the old neighborhood
Why don't you have him move in with you
Ha ha
- The choir sings the Beatitudes
Walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as one woman looks through her day planner, an old guy dozes and his Granddaughter Ashley applies nail polish
, the very young parish priest, steps up to the altar and delivers the eulogy for Walt's wife
Walt sits ramrod straight and listens to the thin, weak, unconvincing words of Father Janovich
Death
is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased and their families
Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits them
And some may ask, what is death
Is it the end
Or is it the beginning
And what is life
What is this thing we call life
Jesus
Walt coughs
He takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips
He looks down and notices a speck of  on the white cloth
: '  - The house is crammed with people following the service
Walt doesn't know what to do with himself
He has to keep busy
Steve steps over to his father
lot of people showed up after the service
Yeah, well,  s'pose they knew there'd be plenty of ham
think 'll go downstairs and get some more chairs
'll do it, Dad
Naw, we need them now, not next week
- Grandsons ,  and  look through boxes in the cellar
box of old Korea War photos are pawed through
Josh holds up a black-and-white  -- a young looks utterly exhausted, behind him six bodies are sprawled dead on the ground
Is that Dad
No, it's Grandpa Walt
Josh turns the photo over and reads it
Third Platoon,  company, March second, 1952, Korea
' Where's Korea
Hell if  know
David holds up a

() 5 Cool,  found a medal
They hear someone coming downstairs
By the time Walt descends the staircase, the boys sit on the couch, pretending to be doing nothing
Walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs
People eat and chat
Ashley marches over to her parents, and Mitch
() How long do we have to stay, this ghetto is a dead zone for my cell and 'm bored
Walt stands behind them with an armful of folding chairs, he overheard his Granddaughter
Mitch and Karen are embarrassed
Ashley, honey
Why don't you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs
Me
Yes you
Grandpa Walt, can  help you with the chairs
'll take care of it, you just painted your nails
Walt opens the folding chairs and looks out the window
It's snowing
Walt puts on his coat, he almost looks relieved to get out of the house
'd better salt the sidewalk before someone falls and breaks a hip
Walt taps the floor with his boot and , his very, very, very old  follows him outside
4
: 6 '  - Walt carefully shovels his sidewalk
He deliberately stops at the boundary of his property
The reason for this is that Walt's neighbors are now mostly Asians who moved into the house that once belonged to Polish families
Next door to Walt's house some sort of party is going on
Walt can see through the window that the living room is jammed with at least forty people, all Asians, all Hmong
And this is a problem for Walt, because Walt is a full- blown, unrepentant racist
Walt lights a cigarette and speaks to his dog, Daisy
Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats can they cram into a living room
Walt spits in the snow and walks back to the garage
- Walt steps inside and catches Ashley sneaking a cigarette
She has pulled back the canvas tarp that covers his pride and joy, his beloved 1972
The Gran Torino is in mint condition
It has been babied since the day it rolled off the line
Ashley tosses her cigarette when she sees Grandpa Walt
Wow, Grandpa, when'd you get the vintage car
Walt looks at her for a second, then steps on her still burning cigarette before answering
1972
never knew you had a cool old car
It's only been in here since before you were born
5
() 7 So, what are you like going to do with it like, when
you die
Walt lights up a smoke -- Jesus, Joseph and Mary
Walt pulls the cover back over the Gran Torino
Then what about that super cool retro couch in the den, 'm going to State next year and  don't have, like, any furniture
Walt walks out without commenting
' The doorbell rings and Walt opens the door
Standing there is , a sixteen-year-old  boy
Walt scowls
is slight, he has long hair, long lashes, but is very good-looking -- like an Asian Johnny Depp
Who the hell are you
(very quietly) 'm Tao,  live next door
What
Speak up, boy, get the shit out of your mouth
What do you want
Do you have jumper cables
My uncle's car is old and
No
And have some goddamned respect, zipper head, we're mourning over here
Walt slams the door in Tao's face
Walt turns and is suddenly cornered by Father Janovich
Walt hates situations like this
6
: () 8 How you holding up, Walt
Mr
Kowalski
Huh
It's Mr
Kowalski, not Walt
Right, Mr
Kowalski
Your wife and  became quite close these last few months
She asked that watch over you when she passed on
told her  watch out for my entire flock, but she made me promise 'd keep an extra sharp eye on you
appreciate your kindness to my wife and now that you've spoken your piece, why don't you move on to the next sheep
Walt starts to step away, but Father Janovich blocks him
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her wish for you to go to confession
She said she couldn't remember the last time you went
Is that so
It is
Walt drains his lowball glass
Well,  confess  never much liked church and only went because of the wife
And  confess  have no desire to confess to a boy who is fresh out of the seminary
7
: 9 '  - People are leaving Walt's house
mass of shuffling, stiff-jointed old Pollacks
Right next door -- walking the opposite direction are more Hmong going up the sidewalk
They laugh and chatter and carry big dishes of food and fruit
They are a happy bunch compared to the dour crowd exiting Walt's home
The Hmong are going to a birth ceremony
three-day-old baby is named and three souls are located for the newborn
: Walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old ladies from the funeral
He hooks up the jumper cables to their dead battery
Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh pull up next to Walt in a brand new Toyota Land Cruiser
Mitch opens the window
'd really like to help, Dad, but we have to get the kids home, they're getting restless
Walt just looks at the   on the Land Cruiser and then gives Mitch a disgusted glance
Fine
Go
'll call in a few, see how you're doing
Walt nods and lights a cigarette as they drive off
Kill you to buy American
- 10 10 Did you see him look at the truck
It's always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Buggy that
Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go
8
() 10 At least he didn't say anything this time
He didn't have to
Well, what do you expect
The man worked at a Ford plant for twenty- eight years
And  suppose that's my goddamned fault
11 11 Walt gets his guests' engine running
As they drive off, Walt hears faint
Walt looks into his neighbor's backyard and can't believe his eyes
The Hmong all sing and chant as three  have their heads sliced off, right there in the yard
The chickens are held up and everyone chants louder
It's a sacrifice
Walt spits in the snow and says to Daisy
Barbarians
Goddamned barbarians
- 12 12 The house is a buzz of activity
The older Hmong speak their native language, the younger generation speaks both English and Hmong
(: Hmong is subtitled when necessary
) Tao's Grandmother () complains to a
() There's no man in this house, that's why my daughter should remarry
Being a second wife is better than having a woman be the head of the household
It's not our way
9
: 10 10 () 11 () What about Tao
() What about him
() He's the man in the house
() Tao's not a man
() Look at him in the kitchen, washing dishes like a woman
Even his sister gives him orders and he obeys
The    the kitchen where  washes a pile of dishes
An older relative drops dishes in the sink, without acknowledging Tao's presence
It's clearly an insult
In the   the Hmong Soul Calling ceremony starts its next phase
An elder, the family , is present and begins the ritual
As the entire Hmong family gathers to watch
Tao slips on his coat and goes out the back door
'  - 13 13 Tao wobbles as he pedals his bike through the snow
Tao passes Walt's garage and is startled as Walt appears from a shadow,   in his hands
They make eye contact as Tao passes
Walt spits in the snow and looks down at Daisy
thought these zips were supposed to be such hard workers
Christ, had my own car when  was his age
- 14 14 Tao exits the store, gets on his bike and rides off
10
: 12 12 () 12 few blocks away, Tao rides past a snowbank when -- is thrown through the spokes of his front wheel
Tao flies over the handlebars into the snow
chorus of laughter is heard
Three  stand around the stunned, prone Tao
Whatta you gonna do, gook
You gonna Kung Fu' us
Tao just lies there as Latino #2 picks up his bike
#2 Surprised it ain't a girl's bike
The Latinos laugh
Tao remains on the ground
You gonna get up or what
Tao doesn't move
Tell you what, 'll let you take the first swing
You drop me and you can have your bike back
Tao smiles, he can't help it
What the fuck you smiling at, gook
Something funny
He grabs Tao by the jacket and pulls him to his feet
You better get the fuck outta here, bitch
He pushes Tao backwards
Tao falls back into the snow
This time Tao crab-walks back away from the Latinos
The Latinos stroll away with Tao's bike
'  - 15 15 : Walt is going about the chores of spring cleaning
11
: 14 14 () 13 Walt looks around with disdain at his neighbors' houses
Walt's property is perfectly kept, whereas his neighbors' houses are rundown
Walt's eyes linger on every defect, gutter hangs, ripped screen doors, peeling paint
One neighbor has installed a chicken coop
Walt looks down at Daisy -- Damn chinks let their yards go to hell
Polarski would turn over in his grave if he could see what they did to his lawn
Tao walks past
Walt watches him pass
don't know why these goddamned slopes had to move to my block
This used to be a nice neighborhood
'  - 16 16 Tao nods to an older woman rocking in a broken rocking chair
nods back to Tao, then turns her evil eye back on Walt, whom she's been seething at all morning
() Why doesn't that stupid, hairy white man move
He must be too dumb to realize he's not welcome here
All the Mee-Khah left in the neighborhood should just move away
Look at him strut like a rooster
She sees Walt glance at her and spit
Phong glares back and spits beetle juice, which has turned her teeth black
'  - 17 17 Daisy snoozes next to the front door
The doorbell rings; Daisy doesn't even move
Walt walks to the front door holding a roll of duct tape
The doorbell rings again
Walt looks down at Daisy -- 12
: 15 15 () 14 Jesus Christ, dog, have you gone totally deaf
Walt opens the door
Standing on his front step is Father Janovich
Hi there, Walt
Listen, son, you're not my barber, you're not a friend, so why in the hell do you think you can call me Walt
Sorry
Mr
Kowalski
So, what are you peddling now
Oh, nothing
Thought 'd drop by and see how you were doing
Haven't seen you in church in awhile
Okay
You've done your good deed, now why don't you run along
'd really like to talk, Mr
Kowalski
don't think so, kid
Sorry
Why
Do you have a problem with me, Mr
Kowalski
You don't want to know
No,  do
The problem is  think you're an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who holds the hands of superstitious old women and promises them eternity
13
: 17 17 () 15 Walt shuts the front door in Father Janovich's face
- 18 18 Tao walks down the street, his head in a book
He finally realizes there's a blue Chevy following slowly behind him
The blue Chevy is now parallel with Tao and keeps pace with his step
Tao looks over to the occupants of the Chevy
It's two
Tao quickens his pace, but the Chevy easily keeps up with Tao
Is you a boy or a girl,  can't tell
#2 What you reading, gook, Jackass And The Rice Stalk
Tao laughs, but keeps walking
That's right, you keep walking
Fucking slopes everywhere you look, man
Why gooks come up in here and fuck up our neighborhood
Down the street -- is a suped-up   with a big on the back
Inside are five Hmong gangbangers
The Hmong gangbangers notice Tao being followed by the Latinos
, the driver, squints and then points at Tao
Dude, that's my little cousin, Tao
You sure about that, Spider
'm sure
Do we do something
or what
Smokie is the gang leader
He looks at Tao for a second
Your cousin tight with anyone
14
: (2) 17 17 () 16 No, he flies solo, Smokie
Okay
Let's go help out our little cousin
Smokie nods to Spider, they roar up and stop right across from Tao and the Latinos' car
You better not be giving my bro here a hard time or you're gonna wish you never been born
Oh goody, more Rice Niggers
The Latino Driver smiles and flashes a
Hmong kid in the back seat opens the door and displays a sub-machine gun
The Latinos are way out-gunned
#2 Fucking Viet Cong swamp rats
Go back to your fucking rice paddy
The Latinos screech their tires and are gone
The Hmongs in the car smile and congratulate themselves
Tao simply keeps walking down the street
Where the fuck does he think he's going
Turn us around and go after that cousin of yours
They swing a -turn and pull up to Tao, keeping pace with him as he walks
Hey, cuz, slow down, where you going
You should really think about hanging with us, man
If we all stick together, shit like that won't happen, with those Spicks
Tao nods as he walks, but doesn't answer
You can't be such a little girl
You join up with us, we'll keep you out of trouble, cuz
15
: 18 18 () 17 Tao looks at the sub-machine gun cradled by the Hmong gangbanger in the back seat
Smokie takes this all in
He looks down the street and sees that in a half block, Tao will have to pass a group of Latino gangbanger types
You think about it and we'll see you tomorrow
'  - 19 19 Tao digs in the garden
Tao's younger sister  sits and reads  magazine on the porch
The tricked-out Honda with Blue Neon lights pulls up
Spider, Smokie and two other Hmong gangbangers get out
Hey, cuz
Hey, Sue
What do you want
Came to talk to my cousin Tao
Smokie looks over to Sue
Spider, who's the other cousin
laughs at the name Spider
Sue is seventeen, has long straight hair with red highlights
Spider'
Is that what he just called you, Fong
This is my little cousin, Sue
Smokie takes off his sunglasses and smiles at Sue
Hey, Sue
how old are you, girl
Mentally, 'm way too old for you
'm going inside
16
: (2) 18 18 () 18 That's right, go inside while the men talk
Yeah, that's exactly what 'm doing, Fong
Sue rolls her eyes and goes inside
Smokie stares at Tao
You think about what we talked about
Smokie watches Tao carefully, offers him a cigarette
Tao shakes his head no and looks at the ground
That's exactly the point, Tao
Spider told me how everyone thinks you're a pushover, how everybody walks all over you and shit mean, look at you, out here working in the garden like a woman
Tao nods silently, but still looks at the ground
It ain't no big thing
You just need a little guidance
Tao looks up at Smokie
Tao looks a little skeptical
It's true, man
Shit,  used to be kind of a quiet little punk like you, everybody fucking with me
But finally  said no more
' You, you're lucky, Tao, we got your back
Me
didn't have nobody
Had to mold my own tribe
Smokie's right
We're family, right
You with us or what
swear, brother, we're the best friends you'll ever have
And anyone fucks with you, they're fucked
17
: 19 19 () 19 Come on, man
Tao clears his throat and speaks for the first time
What do  have to do
Smokie points to Walt's open garage
Spider mentioned that neighbor of yours
: -- There it sits with the tarp rolled back, Walt's gorgeous, shining
(
) Now that's a car
(
) Shit ya
1972 Gran Torino fastback
Cobra jet engine
Mint
Next to the garage, Walt is bent over planting tomatoes
Walt notices the Hmong punks looking at him
20 20 Walt sits at the bar in the  (Veterans of Foreign Wars) drinking with the old buddies and cracking off- color jokes
got one
Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy walk into a bar, the bartender looks up at them and says -- get the fuck out
' The gang laughs, until they see Father Janovich step up to the bar
He smiles as he recognizes several faces
So, here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church
18
: (2) 19 19 () 20 Hiya, Father
Hi, Mel
Hey there, Darrel
Hello, Father
Hi, Walt
Walt says nothing
He just sips his beer
What brings you in here, Father
The meat raffle
No
came down to talk to Walt, if that's okay
Mel and Darrel look at Walt
It puts him on the spot
have to hand it to you, Padre
You are persistent
promised your wife
Walt looks over at Mel and Darrel and then back at Father Janovich
Oh Jesus Christ, let's grab a booth
- 21 21 The waitress comes over
'll have a Pabst and a shot
What are you having, Father
'll have a Diet Coke
Bullshit, this is a bar, what do you want to drink
19
: 20 20 () 21 Ummmm
'll have a gin and tonic
Attaboy
The waitress leaves
So, what do you want
promised your wife 'd get you to go to confession
Jesus Christ, why'd you do that
She was very insistent
She made me
You sure are fond of promising people stuff you can't deliver on
Let's talk about something else
Like what
Life and death
What would you know about it
'd like to think  know a lot
'm a priest
You stand at the altar and preach on and on about life and death without knowing anything other than what you learned in priest school
Everything you say sounds like it's out of the Rookie Preachers Handbook
don't know about that
20
: 21 21 () 22 Walt waves his hand and cuts him off
Death is bittersweet
Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation
' That's what you know of life and death
Good God, it's pathetic
What do you know, Mr
Kowalski
Plenty
lived with death for three years in Korea
We shot people, we stabbed them with bayonets, we hacked seventeen-year- old kids to death with shovels, for Christ's sake
did things that won't leave me till the day die, horrible things, things have to live with
And what about life
Walt has to think for a second
He struggles with his answer
Well
survived the war
got married
and raised a family
Sounds like you know more about death than you do living
Walt downs a shot
Maybe so
'  - 22 22 Walt hears a sound and wakes up
He's very groggy, he had plenty to drink at the
Daisy
The dog sleeps in her bed in the corner
Walt looks at the clock; it's 3:48 am
Walt looks out his bedroom window
He sees the faint beam of a flashlight in his garage
21
: (2) 21 21 () 23 Son of a bitch
Walt pulls on his robe, opens the closet and pulls out the big, 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle he took home from Korea
Walt slides a magazine into the top of the M1 and chambers a round with a loud
- 23 23 The light flips on and before he can blink, Tao is face to face with the barrel of Walt's M1
Walt is silent, he has one eye closed so he can better aim at Tao's forehead -- which is nine inches away
Tao drops the tool he was holding, it bounces with a loud metallic clang
Tao backs away, his eyes wide with terror
As Tao backs up, Walt advances, step for step
Tao trips over a garden hose, which causes Walt to trip
They both start to fall
The lightbulb is bumped with the rifle barrel and swings back and forth
As Walt hits the garage floor, he accidentally The bullet goes through a big, metal Hamm's Beer sign on the wall
Tao scrambles to his feet and jumps like a deer over Walt
Tao runs out of the garage and into the night
Walt lies on the floor for a second, stunned
Sweat runs down his forehead
He coughs up blood
The lightbulb still swings, casting odd shadows in the garage
Shit
- 24 24 Tao scrambles down the alley
Parked off to the side is Spider's Honda
Spider opens the door
Get in, get in
Tao runs right past him
Spider guns the motor and pulls in front of Tao
Smokie, Spider and another gangbanger get out
22
: 22 22 () 24 Get in, Tao
No way
No fucking way
Leave me alone
Smokie, Spider and the other gangbanger grab Tao
vouched for you, Tao, because you're family and you're with us now
Tao struggles
He shot at me
'm out
'm out
Tao squirms out of Smokie's grasp
Smokie yells at Tao as he runs away
Don't fool yourself, Tao
You don't join us and bail
Dumb motherfucker
Should we go after him
Naw, he's got nowhere to go
Let's get out of here
- 25 25 Walt drills heavy-gauge screen mesh over the windows on the garage
The phone rings and Walt answers
Hello
(
) Morning, Dad, it's your number one son, Mitch
It's one in the afternoon
The  now   Walt and Mitch in the kitchen of his huge, modern suburban house
23
: 24 24 () 25 Right, good afternoon, then
So, what do you want
Me
Nothing
What would  want
don't know
Your wife already went through all of your mother's jewelry
No
was just wondering how you are, what's going on, anything new in the old neighborhood
Walt looks at the bullet hole in his Hamm's Beer sign
Nope
Great
Smooth sailing then
Yup
There's a very painful pause in the conversation
Well good
Say, Dad
Uh-huh
Do you still know that guy from the plant who has Viking season tickets
'  - 26 26 Walt has parked the Gran Torino at an angle across his driveway
Walt mutters as he rubs Turtle Wax on his car
- 27 27 Walt fishes out a soft pack of cigarettes and lights one
He exhales as he looks at his car
24
: 25 25 () 26 It's stunning
It absolutely sparkles
The chrome shines, the tires look new and the paint is waxed and polished
Walt looks up again and his eyes sweep the neighborhood in defiance
couple of Hmong teenagers look at the car
() That's right, ain't she pretty
Walt drops down heavily into an old lawn chair and pops open a can of Pabst
: '  - 28 28 Dusk is falling
Walt finally gets up, folds up his lawn chair and walks stiffly back into the garage
Walt flips on the outdoor light, highlighting the Gran Torino still sitting at an angle in the driveway
The whole scene looks like a mid-sixties car ad in Popular Mechanics
Walt goes in the back door and a moment later the kitchen light comes on
The Gran Torino remains in the driveway
It's a challenge, an invitation
Walt is daring the thief to come back
And Walt's ready this time
'  - 29 29 The tricked-out Honda drives up, but doesn't stop at Walt's
It pulls up in front of Tao's house
Tao and Sue exchange looks out on the front step
Smokie, Spider and two others get out, walking confidently up the sidewalk towards them
They grin, they're cocky
Hey, cuz
What's up
What are you doing here
Be happy
We've got good news
25
: 27 27 () 27 Oh really
What's that
We're giving you another shot
don't think so
You blew it the first time
We've got another little inauguration planned for you
This time there'll be no mistakes
Another big, tough gangbanger with little-man' complex
Smokie leers at Sue
It makes her uncomfortable
got my eye on you too, little girl
Whatever
Come on, Tao
Let's go
Tao says nothing
He looks at the ground
He said, let's go
Come on, man
Nobody's gonna get hurt
We'll take care of you
Don't go, Tao
You mind your own business, girl
Two Hmong gangbangers grab Tao by the arms
The front door swings open and there stands a glaring Phong
() Leave my grandson alone

Go away and don't come back
That old woman's got bigger balls than you
You always let little girls and old ladies fight for you
Tao tries to squirm away
Smokie grabs him by the hair and opens his coat to reveal the  in his belt
'm not gonna say it again
Let's go
Now
Tao is shoved towards the car
Suddenly -- Sue jumps on the back of one of the gangbangers and knocks him to the ground
Tao breaks free
Run, Tao, run
Sue is slapped to the ground
Tao is tackled by Smokie and punched in the face
Tao's mother comes out the front door
Smokie and Spider pull Tao towards the car as the other gangbangers keep Mom, Grandma and Sue at bay
middle-aged Hmong Man from across the street comes into the yard
All the gangbangers overreact and pull their pistols
The middle-aged Hmong Man gets in Spider's face and is cracked across the jaw with a pistol barrel
Tao back-pedals away from Spider and Smokie
It becomes a pushing, rolling, surging melee
This mess boils over and spills into Walt's front yard
'  - 30 30 The gangbangers, Tao, his mother, grandmother and Sue all struggle on Walt's painstakingly maintained lawn
ceramic Lawn Gnome is knocked over and breaks

Get off my lawn
Listen, old man, you don't want
said get off my lawn
Now
Walt's calm demeanor is unnerving to the gangbangers
The guns in their hands seem tiny compared to the big military rifle Walt holds
Are you fucking crazy
Go back in your house, old man
Get off my lawn
'm not fucking around, Gramps
Walt spits out the side of his mouth
He grins
Don't think for a second  won't blow a big hole in your face and it won't bother me a bit, not any more than if  shot a deer
Now get off my goddamned lawn
Two of the Hmong gangbangers take a step back
Walt senses their fear
Only Smokie holds his ground
Believe me, kid, 'll blow your damn head off, go back to bed and sleep like a baby
couldn't care less
'm not gonna warn you again
Walt laughs
You're nothing to me
In Korea, we stacked fucks like you five feet high and used you as sandbags

: 30 30 () 30 Complete silence, there's no sound anywhere in the neighborhood
All eyes are on Walt
Walt   the safety on the M1 Garand Rifle
Smokie and the gangbangers give Walt fierce looks, but melt back towards their car
As they get into the car -- Smokie has to say something
You better watch yourself, old man
The Honda screeches its tires and goes off down the street
Walt looks at Tao, Sue, Mom and Grandma who stand in stunned silence in his front yard
Finally, Sue speaks up
Thank you
Walt lowers his rifle and spits on the ground
said get off my lawn

Walt grabs his rifle, swings open the front door and leads with the barrel

His front porch is covered with  and  and of food
There must be a dozen different gifts piled there
Daisy comes out and stretches on the porch, before putting her nose in a food basket
Bad dog
Bad deaf, dumb, blind dog

He dumps them on top of other gifts he received from the Hmongs
His garbage is overflowing
Coming down the alley is another Hmong couple, they smile carrying a basket filled with Asian vegetables
Walt holds up his hand like a traffic cop
No
No more
The Hmong couple nod, say something with a smile and turn around
Tao, his mother and Sue argue in the yard
They gesture towards Walt's house
The women buzz around Tao, all speaking in his ear at the same time
Phong yells at them from the porch, but they ignore her
Walt watches as the mother and Sue march Tao towards his house
Tao looks like a whipped dog
Why won't these people leave me alone
Walt walks out to meet them at his property line and puts up his hands, indicating they've come far enough
Sue holds up a plant
We brought you some shallots to plant in your garden
don't want them
They're perennials, they come back every year
No
You keep them
Why do you people keep giving me all this garbage
Sue is a little taken aback
30
() 32 Because
because you saved Tao
No,  didn't
All  did was get a bunch of jabbering gooks off my lawn
Well, you're a hero to the neighborhood
No, 'm not
Too bad, they think you are and that's why they're bringing you the gifts
Just take your plant and leave me alone
Walt turns and starts to walk away
Tao's mother speaks rapidly in Hmong to Sue
They look at Tao and then to Walt
There's another thing
What
This is my mother, Vu, 'm Sue and this is my brother, Tao
We live next door
So
Tao is here to apologize
Sue shoots a hard look at Tao, who shifts uncomfortably
'm sorry
For what
31
: 33 33 () 33 For trying to steal your car
Walt's eyes go wide in recognition
He turns white with rage
Get this straight,  see you on my property again, you're done
Walt turns on his heels and storms into his house
' 34 34 The doorbell rings
Walt opens it to find Father Janovich standing on his front step
Good afternoon, Walt
Walt's eyes narrow
mean, Mr
Kowalski
already told you 'm not going to confession
Why didn't you just call the police
Pardon
do work with some of the Hmong gangs and  heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood
Why didn't you call the police
Oh,  prayed for them to show up, but guess what
No answer
What were you thinking
Someone could have been killed
We're talking life and death here
32
: (2) 33 33 () 34 Not that it's any of your goddamned business, but when things happen quickly like that, you have to react
In Korea, we never called the police' when a swarm of screaming gooks came pouring into our lines
We reacted
We're not in Korea, Mr
Kowalski
Walt says nothing
've been thinking about our discussion on life and death
About what you said
About how you carry around the horrible things you were forced to do
Horrible things that won't leave you
It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden
Things done during war are terrible, being ordered to kill, killing to save others, killing to save yourself
You're right, those are things  don't know anything about
But  do know about forgiveness
And 've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins, admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them
Stronger men than you
Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace
Walt nods
Father Janovich threw a bull's-eye
Almost
'm impressed
You came with your guns loaded, for once
Thank you
You have balls, Father
And what you said, you're right
'm sure stronger men than me have found their salvation
Hallelujah
But there's one thing you're way wrong about
33
: 34 34 () 35 What's that, Mr
Kowalski
The thing that haunts a guy is the stuff he wasn't ordered to do
35 35 The old, balding  finishes cutting Walt's hair
There, you look like a human being again
You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap bastard
'm just amazed that you're still alive
keep hoping you'll die and they'll get someone good in here, but you just hang in there, you dumb, Italian-Wop-Dago, you
That'll be ten dollars, Walt
Ten dollars
Jesus Christ, Martin, you keep raising the price
You sure you're not part Jew
Martin the Barber laughs at Walt
It's been ten bucks for the last five years and you know it, you thick-skulled, old Pollack son of a bitch
Here's ten, keep the change
See you in three weeks, you prick
If you live that long, dipshit
Walt and Martin shake hands and Walt walks out
34
: (2) 34 34 36 - 36 36 Walt gets in his old Ford pickup and drives off
This is a very bad, rundown neighborhood
- 37 37 Sue walks with her ridiculous Wigger (urban white kid) boyfriend,
Trey wears big baggy pants, a sports jersey and an Oakland Raiders visor upside-down and backwards
They walk past three   leaning against a building
The    spots Sue and smiles
Hey, girl, you come over here and talk to me
Come on, baby, don't be shy
Trey and Sue move as far over on the sidewalk as they can to avoid the black guys
They try to ignore them
Come on, sweetie, don't be like that
You talk to me, don't be all stuck up and shit
Walt waits at a stoplight
He watches Sue and Trey and the three black guys who block their path
One black guy flips Trey's  onto the ground
The Tall Guy makes kissy faces at Sue as he touches his crotch
Walt sits there for a second; he shouldn't help, but Walt solves every situation by being aggressive
Walt drives off, then makes a -turn
The Tall Black Guy now focuses on Trey
What are you sposed to be
Trey puts up his hand to hi-five
The Tall Black Guy just looks at him
Yo, it's cool, dog
35
() 37 What the fuck are you doing in my neighborhood, boy
Nothing
We're going to Red Roost to get some CDs
That place is trippin', bro
What you call me, you fucking with me, bitch
You think you're funny
Nothing
No
'm warning you, boy
What you all come up in here for
You here to bring me this present
Huh
This Oriental yummy for me
Don't worry, 'll take good care of her
Great, another asshole with a fetish for Asian girls
God, it gets so old
What's your name, girl
My name
It's take your crude, overly obvious come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it
' That's my name
You should keep your bitch on a leash, put a choke chain on this whore and yank
Oh, of course, right to the stereotype thesaurus
Call me whore' and bitch' in the same sentence
36
: 37 37 () 38 The Tall Black Guy grabs Sue by the arm
Trey moves slightly towards Sue and is pushed down into a pile of garbage
You think you're pretty funny, don't you
What, are you gonna hit me now
That'd pretty much complete the picture
The Tall Black Guy pushes Sue hard against the wall
You don't know when to quit
The old, black pickup pulls up and stops next to them
Sue, Trey and the black guys look over
Walt sits behind the wheel, he looks right through the Tall Black Guy
What the fuck you looking at, old man
You
and your buddies
What's the matter with you
Don't any of you work
see you lazy show- offs in the middle of the day, slowly walking across the street or harassing women
Nobody owes you bastards anything so go out and get a job instead of pushing little girls around, for Christ's sake
Why don't you get the fuck out of here, while 'll still let you
#2 That's right, bitch
What makes you spooks think you can bully a couple kids with impunity
What
Are you fucking crazy
37
: (2) 37 37 () 39 Look at me, Slick
You're crazy if you thinking 'm fooling around
You are fucking crazy
You have to be pretty goddamned dumb to think you can push people around without running into someone who will push back
The black guys are a bit dumbfounded
Walt stares them down
But you might just be dumb enough not to recognize that your luck just ran out
All bravado drains away from the black guys
Walt is a rock
Walt grins slightly and spits on the ground
Fuck this guy
He ain't worth it
The trio walks slowly across the street, forcing a car to miss a green light
Trey puts his hand out to shake Walt's
Man, thanks a lot, mister
Walt doesn't extend a hand, he lets Trey stand there like an idiot
Trey slowly lowers his arm
Walt looks at Trey's outfit
Go home, clown
and pull up your goddamned pants
Walt turns to Sue
Come on, 'll give you a ride
38
: (3) 37 37 40 '  - 38 38 Walt and Sue drive in silence
Finally Sue speaks up
So, what's with you, you have some sort of savior complex or something
What in the hell's the matter with you
thought all you Asian girls were supposed to be so smart
What are you doing walking around in that neighborhood
That's how you end up in the obituaries, that is, if they can identify your body once they pull it out of the goddamned river
know,  know
Take it easy
Walt looks at her for a second
She's not ruffled at all
They drive
So, that goofball back there
He's your boyfriend
Yeah, kind of, his name is Trey
Why in the hell would you go out with a clown like that
Why don't you date one of your
own
one of those other
Hu-mungs
You mean, Hmong
We're Hmong, not Hu-mung
Right
Hmong
What is a
where is Hmong or whatever
Sue laughs
Wow
You're so enlightened
Hmong isn't a place, it's a people
39
() () 41 Hmong people come from different parts of Laos and Thailand and China
Then why are you in my neighborhood, instead of back there
It's a Vietnam thing
We fought on your side and when America quit, the Communists starting killing the Hmong, so we came over here
Walt is quiet for few seconds
Why'd you pick the Midwest, for Christ's sake
There's snow on the ground near half the year
Jungle people on the frozen tundra
Hill people
We were hill people, not jungle people
Boo-ga, boo- ga, boo-ga
Whatever
Blame the Lutherans
They brought us here
Still, you'd think the cold would keep all the assholes away
Sue laughs again at Walt's conscienceless racism
Thanks for the ride
Sure
You know, you seem okay
What the hell's the matter with your half-wit brother
He a little slow or something
40
: 38 38 (') () 42 Tao is actually really bright, he just doesn't know which direction to go in
Oh, poor Toad
It's really common
Hmong girls over here fit in better, we adjust
The girls go to college, the boys go to jail
'   - 39 39 Walt drinks coffee and reads the newspaper
He flips from section to section
Daisy's at his feet
Next door, Phong sits watching Walt
He can see her mumbling under her breath
Old hag, giving me the evil eye
Walt opens the paper to the  guide section and lingers at the  for a second
Aw, what the hell
Walt reads aloud to himself
Your birthday today; This year you have to make a choice between two life paths
Second chances come your way
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anti-climax
Your lucky numbers are: 84, 23, 11, 78 and 99
Walt drains his coffee and tosses the paper onto the porch
What a load of crap
Walt lights up a cigarette and exhales
Walt watches as the only white woman on the block struggles to unload her groceries from her car
One of her bags rips
41
: (2) 38 38 () 43 Three teenagers walk past and laugh at her spilled groceries
One of them makes a crude gesture behind her back
Christ all Friday
What's wrong with kids today
Walt gets up to go help, but before he can get to the sidewalk, another neighbor has gone over to help
It's
Tao bends down and carries her bags up to her door
Well, 'll be damned
' 40 40 Mitch and Karen sit across from Walt
small store- bought birthday cake sits in front of Walt
Walt reads his birthday card
It's signed; Love Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh
the signatures have been written in a woman's cursive style and with the same pen
Mitch slides a wrapped gift across the table to Walt
Go ahead, Dad
Open it
What is it
Just open it
Walt opens the package, it's a Gopher Reaching Tool -- the kind that has an alligator clamp so you can pick up objects that have fallen behind the stove, etc
Walt looks at his son and daughter-in-law
It's a Gopher
It's so you can reach stuff
You know, it makes things easier
Here's one from me
slides over a another wrapped gift
Walt opens it
It's a  with really big numbers for old people
42
: 39 39 () 44 It's a phone
() Thank you, Karen
just thought
we thought that it would
make things easier
Yeah,  see that
There's nothing wrong with making things less hard on yourself
Karen's right, Dad
You've worked hard your whole life
Maybe you should think about taking it a little easier
Walt lights up a cigarette
And that's another thing, Dad
You should get rid of the coffin nails
Walt says nothing
And the house, now that Mom's gone, it's got to be a lot to maintain, let alone clean
and you're all alone in here
It's worse than Walt thought
He puffs smoke
There's these great places now, these communities where you don't have to worry about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow
People who are like you, alert, active, but are alone and would benefit by being with other folks their own age
43
: 40 40 () 45 Dad, take a look
We brought some pamphlets
: '  - 41 41 Mitch and Karen storm out to their Land Cruiser
Mitch carries the Gopher Grabber Tool and Karen has the big numbered phone in her hand
told you,  told you this was a bad idea
know, you were right
Son of a bitch
He just won't let anyone help him
Well, we tried
Now we can just drop it
No one can say we didn't try
To hell with him, kicking us out on his birthday
We should've stayed home with Ashley and Josh
They knew better, they wouldn't even come
The goddamned kids are smarter than we are
Mitch screeches the tires as they take off
Walt waits for them to clear out, before coming out on the porch with a can of Pabst
Daisy comes out and lies at his feet
Walt covers his mouth as he coughs
dime-sized circle of dark, red blood is left in the palm of his hand
Walt looks at the blood as he takes another sip of beer
'  - 42 42 Walt continues to sit on his porch, a long row of empty Pabst beer cans are lined up on the railing
44
: (2) 40 40 () 46 Walt looks at a photo in his wallet, his and Dorothy's wedding photo
Walt looks down at Daisy -- We miss Momma, don't we, Daisy
vehicle pulls up to Tao's house
party is in full swing
Sue comes out and helps the Hmong women unload big platters of food and carry them to the house
Sue catches Walt's gaze and steps over to his porch
Hey, Walt, what are you up to
Walt points his index finger at the can of Pabst in his hand
We're having a barbecue
You want to come over
What do you think
There's tons of food
'll bet
Just keep your paws off my dog
No worries, we only eat cats
Really
No, 'm kidding, you moron
Come on, come on over
You can be my special guest
'm fine right here
Walt reaches into the cooler for another beer
It's empty, just water and ice
Son of a bitch
45
: 42 42 () 47 What have you had to eat today, Walt
piece of cake and some beef jerky
Come on over and get something to eat
We've got beer, too
Walt exhales loudly -- Oh, what the hell
It's my birthday,  may as well drink with strangers instead of myself
Walt gets up and walks with Sue towards her house
Happy Birthday, Wally
Don't call me Wally
'  - 43 43 Inside are thirty Hmong and Walt, who sticks out like a sore thumb
Total fish out of water
Walt looks in the refrigerator, Sue looks over his shoulder
You do have a lot of beer, but no Pabst
As they say, When in Hmong
Ha ha
Are you sure it's okay 'm here
Everyone keeps looking at me and when  look back, they look at the ground
It's fine
Phong appears from the crowd and points at Walt
46
: (2) 42 42 () 48 () You, get out
Out of our house
(to Sue) What is he doing here
Walt cringes at her presence
What'd she say
She said welcome to our home
No she didn't
No, she didn't
() Why is this white man in our home
man like him brings nothing, nothing but sorrow and death
Several relatives usher Phong away from Walt
The relatives are embarrassed at the outburst
She hates me
Yes, she hates you
What did  do
little Hmong girl walks past and Walt pats her on the head
Everyone in the room looks in horror at Walt
What
What the hell are all you fish heads looking at
Sue looks around and then pulls Walt out of the room
Maybe we should go in the other room
- 44 44 Sue explains a few facts to Walt
47
: 43 43 () 49 lot of the people in this house are very traditional
Number one, never touch a Hmong person on the head, not even a child
Hmong people believe that the soul resides in the head, so don't do that
That's dumb, but fine
Hmong people also consider looking someone in the eye to be rude
That's why everyone looks away when you look at them
Swell
Anything else
Yeah, some Hmong smile or grin when they're yelled at or get into a confrontation
It's a cultural thing
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity, not that they're laughing at you
Good God, you people are all nuts
45 45 Walt opens another beer, as Sue speaks Hmong to a relative
Walt notices an Old Hmong Man staring at him
Walt interrupts Sue
Hey, Sue
What
You said you guys don't look you in the eye, but that guy keeps staring at me
Sue laughs and gestures to the Old Hmong Man
The Old Hmong Man steps over and nods to Walt
48
: 44 44 () 50 This is Kor Khue
He's the Lor family shaman
Witch doctor
Sue smiles and nods
Something like that
The Hmong hold their clan Shaman in very high regards
Boo-ga, boo-ga
Kor Khue says something to Sue in Hmong
She turns and translates to Walt
Kor Khue is interested in you, he heard what you did
He says he would like to read you
Huh
He wants to read you
Tell you your soul
It'd be rude not to allow him this, it's a great honor
Tell Kor to be my guest, fire away
Sue speaks Hmong to the Shaman
The Shaman responds and sits down across from Walt
He looks at Walt for a long time
Walt stares straight back at him
The Shaman mumbles to himself
Finally the Shaman turns to Sue and speaks very rapidly
As Sue translates, the Shaman watches Walt's reaction
Kor Khue says that you think you've been disrespected
You do not live your life
Your food has no flavor
You are scared of your past
49
: 45 45 () () 51 You stopped living years and years ago
Kor Khue says you're not at peace
Walt looks like he's been hit by a truck
The Shaman watches Walt closely, he knows he hit the nail on the head
Walt looks pale
He's been spooked good
He wipes sweat from his forehead
Excuse me
Walt gets up and steps into the kitchen
He takes several deep breaths
He's pretty shook up
Je -- zuz -- Christ
Walt looks around at all the Hmongs eating and carrying on
Walt sees a young man give up his seat to an Elder
Walt sees a young woman go to each of the older folks and offer tea and cookies from a tray
Walt sees a child help an old man out of the bathroom
Walt coughs hard
He wipes blood from his lips
Sue comes in and looks at Walt
Are you okay
Walt brushes past her and goes into the bathroom
- 46 46 Walt washes his face in the sink and dries his hands
He's still pale
He looks long and hard in the mirror
Walt is stunned, it all adds up
Walt hasn't really lived in 50 years, he hasn't relaxed or exhaled or let his guard down since he got back from Korea in 1953
(to himself) Son of a bitch
've got more in common with these goddamned gooks than my own spoiled-rotten family
50
: (2) 45 45 (') () 52 Walt looks at himself
Happy birthday
Walt opens the bathroom door
Sue stands there with a concerned look on her face
Are you okay
Me
'm fine
You were bleeding
Walt smiles disarmingly
just bit my tongue
'm fine
'm great
Let's get some of that gook food, 'm starving
47 47 Walt sits amongst several old Hmong Women, who take great delight in feeding him different Hmong dishes which he's obviously never tasted before
Walt reacts with great enthusiasm to the food, occasionally making jokes like he's choking, etc
This corny stuff goes over like gangbusters with the Hmong ladies
Sue comes in and rolls her eyes at Walt
Come on, you glutton, let's go downstairs
Why
To mingle
'm fine right here
'm mingling
Come on, you said not to leave you alone
' 51
: 46 46 53 - 48 48 Walt and Sue descend the stairway
Walt is really out of his element down with all the Hmong teenagers
And the first person he sees across the room is Tao
Oh great
Well, look who's over there
What's-his-name who tried to steal my Gran Torino
My brother Tao
Yeah, Toad
Tao is in the corner, he avoids Walt's gaze
Sue walks over to a group of boys, leaving Walt alone
Walt doesn't know what to do with himself
He leans against the
The  wobbles
Walt gets on his hands and knees
He looks under the dryer
He adjusts the short leg to balance out the machine
He just can't help it
All the Hmong kids watch Walt, trying not to laugh at this strange white man on his hands and knees fixing a dryer during a party
Walt looks up -- deer in the headlights
It was wobbly, but  fixed it
It's fine now, shouldn't wobble anymore
The Hmong kids look away, covering their mouths with their hands
Walt glares at Tao, who immediately wipes the smile from his face
Sue walks over and hands Walt a drink
What's this
52
() 54 Rice liquor
Try it
Alright
Sue walks off
Walt sips his rice liquor and watches the interaction between the boys and girls
One particularly gorgeous young willow-wisp of a stares across the room at Tao
Tao looks back at her, but then looks away
The Girl keeps looking at Tao, smiling and twisting her hair
Tao doesn't approach her, but three other young men do
They do their best to charm her
She's polite, but not interested, she keeps looking at Tao
Walt laughs at Tao's ineptitude, shakes his head at this wasted opportunity
Suddenly the Girl steps over to Walt
She smiles -- () My friends and  were just wondering what you're doing here
Good question
What am  doing here
Anyways, 'm Walt
Hi, Walt
'm Wa Xam
Wa Yum
No, Wa Xam
So
what do you do
Me
Not too much
fix stuff guess
Like what
Well,  fixed my wife's friend's sink yesterday

Even fixed my screen door before it was broke
You're funny
That's one thing 've never been accused of

Funny, no
Wa Xam laughs
Well, have fun
'm going to take off
pleasure to meet you, Yum Yum
She laughs at Walt butchering her name and goes upstairs
The three young suitors follow her up
Tao watches her
Walt comes over to Tao, who is startled
Walt laughs
Relax, zipper head, whatta you think 'm gonna do, shoot you
Tao looks like he wants to run away
wouldn't say anything either, if was you
Walt sips his rice liquor
Walt can't help but rib Tao
You know,  knew you were a dipshit even before the whole garage deal, but  have to say you're even worse with women than you are stealing cars, Toad
It's Tao
What's that
It's Tao, not Toad
My name is Tao
54
: (2) 48 48 (') () 56 Good for you
Anyways, you're blowing it with that girl
Not that  give two shits about a Toad like you
You don't know what you're talking about
Wrong, egg roll
completely know what 'm talking about know 'm not always the most pleasant person to be around, but got the greatest woman who ever lived to marry me
had to work at it, but  got her and it was the best thing that ever happened to me
Hands down
Walt points across the room
He sways slightly
But you
You just sit there and watch as Ding Dong and Click Clack and Charlie Chan walk away with what's-her-face
She likes you, you know
Who
She was standing over there, orange dress, twisting her hair and smiling at you
You mean Wa Xam
Walt takes a long swig off his drink and nods
Yeah, yeah
Anyways, she likes you,  know,  talked to her
Great girl, charming girl
Love her
love Yum Yum
But you
You just watch her walk out the door with the Three Stooges
Why
Because you're a big fat pussy

He has no idea what they are saying
No more
Please, keep your flowers

Walt answers, a Skillsaw in one hand
Standing on his doorstep are three Hmong women

Gee holds up a plate covered with tinfoil
No
Forget it
Stop bringing me stuff
Gee scolds Walt in Hmong
No

Gee opens the corner of the tinfoil
Walt looks at the food

You have to stop
Gee pulls the tinfoil off
Walt gazes at the food
Is that the chicken dumpling thing you brought the other day

Sue and Vu wait on Walt's porch
Tao stands out on the sidewalk
Walt gets out of his pickup
What now
What
Vu rambles on in Hmong
Walt looks at his watch
He looks at Sue for the translation
Tao is here to make amends, he's here to work for you
No he's not
Mother says that Tao dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt
He'll start tomorrow morning
No
The kid is useless,  don't even want him on my property thought we already went over that
It's very important to my mother that you accept
It'd be an insult to refuse
How is this all of a sudden turned around on me
The goddamned kid tries to steal my car and somehow 'm the bad guy if  don't accept

Tao interrupts from the sidewalk
Come on, Sue
If he doesn't want to, let's just go
Sue and Vu yell at Tao to shut up at the same time; Sue in English, Vu in Hmong
/ Shut up
Shut up
Shut up
Tao looks at the ground
Walt sees the earnest looks on the Hmong women's faces
Their expression begs Walt
Walt gazes back at Tao
Walt looks disgusted, he exhales loudly
Fine
Great
Tomorrow
Walt walks past them and into his house
Jesus, Joseph and Mary
These Hmong broads are like badgers

Tao walks sheepishly over to the property line
Son of a bitch,  didn't think he'd show
Walt waves Tao over
Tao barely looks at Walt

What are you good at
Like what
That's what 'm asking
What are you good at

Count the birds
Yeah, you can count
You slopes are supposed to be good at math, right
Yes,  can count

Walt walks over to trim weeds around the garden fence
Walt doesn't even look at Tao
Finally
You want me to do that
No
Why not
want it done right, that's why
But you've got me just standing here
What am  supposed to be doing, anyway
Scaring away crows
Tao shoots Walt a dirty look

Tao comes over and stands there
Walt finishes watering before even looking at Tao
What do you have for me today
You want me to watch paint dry or maybe count the clouds that pass by
Don't get flip with me, zipper head
ain't the one who tried to steal and don't forget it
Go ahead
don't care if you insult me and say racist things
'll take it
That  know
You have no teeth, kid
That's your problem
You have no balls
Look, 'm stuck here
Why don't you give me something useful to do
Because unlike you 'm not useless
maintain my property, whereas you swamp rats let your houses go to hell
Walt looks across the street at one very dilapidated house
Wait a minute
How long do have you for
Tao pauses
he doesn't want to answer
How long, Toad
60
: 53 53 () 62 () Till next Friday
Walt laughs out loud
It makes Tao cringe
Go get my ladder out of the garage
: '  - 55 55 Tao is at the top of the
Walt and the Hmong neighbor grin at him from the bottom
When you're done caulking the siding, nail that gutter back up, can see it right out my kitchen window, it's been bugging me for three years
The neighbor says something in Hmong to Walt
You said it, brother
- 56 56 Tao digs up a big   out in the rain
It's hard, draining labor and Tao is covered with mud
Tao's shovel hits rocks and roots and clay
Misery
- 57 57 We see Tao do various chores; scrape paint, hang screen doors, reattach house numbers, trim bushes, etc
Walt scrutinizes his every move
Tao is a virtual slave
'  - 58 58 Walt watches with great satisfaction as Tao paints one of the neighboring houses
The neighborhood is really shaping up
Walt sips his coffee with a slight grin
He is really, really, really enjoying this
61
: 54 54 () 63 very old Hmong man and his very young  walk up Walt's driveway
The Grandson translates for grandpa
Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch
Walt reaches in his pocket and studies a small note pad
don't see why not
( ) Tell him sometime after lunch
'  - 59 59 Tao walks up the sidewalk
Before ringing the doorbell, Tao looks down at his hands which have several on them
Tao rubs his hands with a smile
This has been the first time Tao has really risen to a task presented to him
Tao reaches for the doorbell
'  - 60 60 Walt stands over the sink, coughing
In the b
g
the doorbell rings
Walt coughs up a big spot of blood, it's thick with fibers
The doorbell rings again
Walt wipes his mouth and runs the water in the sink
'  - 61 61 Walt answers the door, just as Tao rings the doorbell a third time
Walt looks angry
Jesus Lord almighty, knock it off
It's my last day, whatta you want me to do
Take the day off, you've done enough
62
: 58 58 () 64 Tao looks disappointed, but says nothing
He nods and starts to walk away
Walt calls after him
Toad
Tao turns around
Walt wants to say something, but stops
Nothing, never mind
Walt shuts the door
' 62 62 Walt sits in the crowded waiting room
He looks around
He's the only   in the room
Even most of the is African or from India
As Walt waits, names are called out such as Alvarez, Ngaima, Yang and Abdalla
Finally when the name Kowalski is called, the Muslim woman can't pronounce it correctly
Walt winces
' 63 63 Walt sits in a chair, his hands folded in his lap
short Asian man in a doctor's smock comes in with a chart
Mr
Kowalski
That's right
Good afternoon
looked over your paperwork and  think we should immediately start on a full battery of tests
feel that this
Wait a minute
Where's my regular doctor, where's Dr
Fellman
63
: 61 61 () 65 Dr
Fellman retired three years ago
'm his replacement, Dr
Chang
Jesus Christ
' 64 64 Mitch, Karen and Ashley are in the kitchen
The phone rings and Ashley looks at the caller
It's Grandpa Walt
Well, pick it up
You talk to him
Mitch
'm doing bills here
He's your father
Ashley hands him the phone and he pushes the  button
Hello, Dad
(
) Hello
It's me
Dad
know
What's up
The    Mitch in his huge kitchen and Walt sitting on the edge of his bed
Um
not much, how about you
'm fine, fine
Fine
That's fine
How about the kids and Karen
64
: 63 63 () 66 Everyone is fine
Good
There is a long, uncomfortable pause
Walt looks at some Xeroxed medical pamphlets scattered on his bed
Good
Well, that's good
How's
work
Busy
Right
s'pose
Speaking of busy,  have a lot on my plate right now, unless there's something pressing
Walt looks at a pale, blue pamphlet
Mitch looks at his housekeeping bill
No
Nope
Another pause
Okay then
Okay
Yeah, so it's not a good time right now
Why don't you call me over the weekend
Sure
Okay, it was nice talking to you, bye, Dad
Walt hangs up
He lies down on his bed
65
: 64 64 67 '   - 65 65 While Walt fills a bird feeder, he notices Tao next door
Tao stands, tiptoed on the top of a six-foot ladder, trying to cut a high branch with a pole saw
Walt shakes his head and walks over to Tao
Hey, moron
Tao is startled and almost falls off the ladder
What
appreciate you're doing something on your own, but you're the only person  know dumb enough to get himself killed trimming tree branches
What now
You don't stand on the top step of a ladder and if you cut through that branch you're hacking away at, you'll end up kaput
Tao looks and sure enough -- a thick, black   is five feet below the branch he's almost severed
Go grab the extension ladder from my garage and 'll show you how to do it right, zipper head
: '  - 66 66 Tao ties up bundles of branches and twigs
Walt lights a cigarette, looks up in the tree and nods
Looks good
Good job
Tao nods
66
() 68 Make sure you put the ladder back when you're done raking up the leaves
know
will
Walt walks back over to his porch, grabs a Pabst from the cooler and watches Tao rake
white Honda turns the corner and drives slowly past Tao
Smokie and Spider smile menacingly at Tao as they pass
This kid doesn't have a chance
The Honda now slowly passes Walt's house
Walt just stands there, sipping his beer
The Honda slows to a stop and the gangbangers glare at Walt
The   of the Honda opens
Walt holds out his   like a
He closes one eye to better aim his imaginary gun and moves his thumb several times as if firing
Bang -- bang -- bang
The Honda takes off
Walt watches it drive off and lights another cigarette
Walt doesn't notice, but Tao witnessed this whole interaction from his yard
'  - 67 67 The doorbell rings
Walt opens his door
Tao stands there with his hands in his pockets
He's a bit apprehensive
What do you know about faucets
Walt stares at him for a second and then laughs
: 67
: 66 66 69 '  - 68 68 Tao looks on as Walt turns the faucet on and off, it drips water at its base
Walt looks under the sink
For the love of Pete
What
It must be a hundred degrees in here, turn on the fan
Tao flips the switch on the  , the fan wobbles and shakes, it looks like it's about to fly off
Walt stares up at the fan and shakes his head
' 69 69 The   and  are taken apart on the workbench
Walt reinstalls the diverter valve
Tao looks at all of Walt's tools
Man, where did you get all this stuff
What are you talking about
All the tools and stuff
Where the hell do you think  got them, Toad
This may come as a shock to a thief, but  actually bought the things  have with money  earned
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not what meant
There's just so much shit packed in here
You need the right tool for the right job
Every single thing here has a purpose
68
() 70 Okay, what's this
Tao points to a tool
Post hole digger
Tao starts pointing at things on the workbench in quick succession, questioning Walt with his expression
Hand spade
Tin snips
Nail punch
Tack hammer
Putty knife
Wire stripper
Drywall saw
Tile spacers
Silence
Walt can see something is bothering Tao, but he's too uncomfortable to speak up -- What
can't afford to buy all this stuff
didn't buy all this stuff at once, blockhead
've lived here for fifty years
man stays in one place long enough he tends to attract a decent set of tools
Yeah, but
Look, kid,  think  know where you're going with this
You don't need everything to maintain a house
'm going to let you in on a little secret
Walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down items in quick succession
This is for you
Roll of duct tape, can of -40 and a pair of vise-grips
Any man who's worth a shit can do half his household jobs with these three things
In the odd chance that doesn't work out, you can borrow something
69
: 69 69 () 71 Okay
Cool
Walt coughs and covers his mouth
Both Tao and Walt see the spot of  in his hand
What's with that
What's with what
The blood you just coughed up
That's not good, you should see a doctor
Walt quickly changes the subject -- while tightening the screws that hold the fan blade to the motor hub
So
what exactly was the deal with those guys out on my lawn that night
Who are they
gang
Hmong gangbangers
gathered that
What did they want with you
They wanted to take me away because  blew my first initiation
You joined up with those pukes
Damn, you are a pussy
Why in the hell did you do that
don't know
They were persuasive
My cousin's in the gang
They just talked me into it guess
Well, at least you're honest about it
Walt finishes fixing the ceiling fan
70
: (2) 69 69 () 72 So how'd you blow your first initiation
Tao nods towards the
The Gran Torino
Tao nods
Walt laughs
Christ all Friday
' 70 70 Walt straps an old   onto a two- wheeled
Walt attempts to pull the freezer upstairs
Walt strains with the heavy appliance
It's too much weight for Walt, but this doesn't stop him from heaving and pulling
Walt could have done this by himself when he was younger
Walt sits down on the step and breathes hard
' 71 71 Mitch watches afternoon baseball, drinking an imported, bottled beer
pokes her head into the room
See you later, 'm taking the kids to the mall
Mitch never looks up from the
Yeah, fine
Just don't spend too much goddamned money
will
We hear Karen and the kids exit
Thank God
Finally get the house to myself for once
The
Mitch looks at the Caller
It says; Dad
Mitch almost doesn't pick it up
71
: (3) 69 69 () 73 Hello
(
) Hello
It's me, Dad
Walt
Hey, Dad
What's up
The    Walt in his small kitchen and Mitch in his huge den
Well
um
'm getting the old Westinghouse up out of the basement
Mitch mouths the word Shit
Uh-huh
So
got it on the dolly
Yeah, that'll help
Yeah
And it's a bit heavy
for one guy
Uh-huh
Yeah
need a hand
Oh
So are you busy
Does it have to be done right this second
It's been down there for years
Well
Yeah, 'd like to get on it
72
: 71 71 () 74 Does it work
We were thinking about getting a freezer
What are you going to do with it
Giving it to Aunt Mary
Oh
Can't she give you a hand
She's eighty-one
know,  was joking
What does she need it for
To freeze food
Mitch opens another beer
Yeah, well, 'd love to help you out, Dad, but 'm just walking out the door
have to bring the kids to the mall
Sorry
Uh-huh
Why don't you call Stevie
Your brother lives out of state
Well,  don't know what to tell you, 'm on my way out
Keys in my hand
Okay then
If you can't find anyone by next week, give me a call
Walt nods and hangs up
Mitch hangs up and takes a sip of beer
73
: (2) 71 71 () 75 Aunt Mary
Like she needs a freezer
' 72 72 The doorbell rings and Tao opens the door
There stands Walt
Tao is a little shocked
You got a minute, Toad
: '  - 73 73 Walt and Tao look at the freezer strapped to the dolly
just need a little push
All the weight is up top, so you stay down and give me a little shove at each step
Let me take the top
Naw,  got it
No really, 'll take the top
It looks pretty heavy
'm not crippled
got it
If you don't let me take the top, ain't helping
'll go home
Listen, zipper head, now's not the time to go and
You listen, old man
You came and got me because you needed help, so let me help you
Either it's top or 'm out of here
Walt studies Tao for a second
Tao doesn't blink, he holds his ground
Walt nods, trying not to grin
74
: (3) 71 71 () 76 Okay then, be my guest
Just don't let it slip out of your little girl hands and crush me
Tao laughs
Don't give me any ideas
'  - 74 74 Tao and Walt ease the freezer down the back steps and pause to take a break
They both breathe hard
That thing weighs a ton
Yeah, but it runs like new
They don't make them like that anymore
What are you going to do with it
Sell it
haven't used it in years and it was always in the way down there
How much
Oh,  don't know
Sixty bucks, maybe
Why, you need a freezer
() Our downstairs one died
Walt thinks for a second
Twenty-five and it's yours
Twenty-five
You just said sixty
Save me from wasting money on putting an ad in the paper
75
: 73 73 77 '  - 75 75 Walt and Sue sit eating Laab as they watch Tao, who washes and waxes the Gran Torino in Walt's driveway
Sue laughs and shakes her head
Kind of ironic, huh
What
What the hell do you think 'm referring to
Toad washing the car he tried to steal from you
It seems like justice to me
And if he misses a spot, he's doing it all over
It's nice of you to kind of look after him like this
He doesn't have any real role models in his life
ain't a role model
You're a good man, Wally
wish our dad would have been more like you
Don't call me Wally
No, 'm serious
He was hard on us, really traditional, really old school
'm old school
Yeah, but you're American
What's that supposed to mean
Sue shrugs him off
They look at Tao for awhile
76
() 78 You like him, don't you
Him
Don't be crazy
He tried to steal my car
And you spend time with him and you teach him how to fix things and you saved him from that fuck cousin of ours and
Hey
Watch the language
And you're a good man
Hand me a beer, Dragon Lady
Sue hands him a beer and Walt pops the top
So tell me the problem with Hmong boys again
'm not completely clear
Hmong girls slip in and out of the culture more easily
Date who we want, stay close to our mothers, but are able to keep a foot on each side of the fence
The boys fall through the cracks
Why
It's tough
The boys float around
The fathers belong in a totally different world and the boys have no one to turn to
Does that make sense
Not sure
No
The boys don't ask their fathers for advice, because over here, their fathers no longer have the answers
77
: 75 75 () () 79 Hmong boys become almost invisible, they end up banding together and it all goes to hell from there
The girls go to college and the boys go to jail
It's more common than not
Walt reflects on this for awhile, then changes the subject
You still going out with that clown
No
dumped him
He was a dim- wit
Walt nods
Good girl
'  - 76 76 Walt and Tao spread mulch around Walt's vegetable plants
You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be women's work
Is that why  see you out in your garden all the time
Besides, zipper head, we ain't in Hu-Mong
Funny
Walt lights a cigarette
You should quit those
It's bad for you
So is joining a gang, you dipshit
78
: (2) 75 75 (') () 80 Seriously, you should quit,  saw you cough up blood
So, you ever think about what you want to do with your life
don't know
You've never thought about it
Of course  have
Well, while you're thinking about it, try not to stomp all over my chives, you dipshit
Tao looks down; sure enough, he's standing on Walt's chives
Sorry
Put some mulch around the cucumbers
Tao spreads more mulch
was thinking about sales, maybe
My oldest son's a salesman
He sells cars
Does he do well
License to steal
worked in a Ford plant for thirty years and my son sells goddamned Japanese cars
You made cars
79
: 76 76 () 81 That's right
And  put the steering column in the Gran Torino when it rolled down the line in 1972
Wow, that's cool
It is, isn't it
Does your son come over much
How are you going about getting into sales
You thinking about school
Kinda
Well, you should
School costs money
Maybe you should get a job and save instead of spreading mulch in my garden
Maybe you could just pay me
That's funny
What kind of job could  get
Good question
Who the hell would hire you
() Yeah,  know
Aw, go on
'm kidding
You could get a job, easy
80
: (2) 76 76 () 82 Like what
'd think about construction
Me
Construction
What, do you have Alzheimer's or something
Naw, you could hack it
You just need a little adjustment
You said yourself 'm worthless and  have soft little girl hands
That's exactly the point
know some guys in the trades, but you have to get your shit together
We have to man you up a bit
Man me up
Yes
And you should ask out Yum Yum too

- 77 77 Walt and Tao walk up to the barbershop
You have to learn how guys talk
Now watch how me and Martin communicate
We just throw it back and forth
You ready
Sure
Okay, let's go in
Walt holds the door for Tao and they enter
The Barber has his feet up reading a Playboy
Oh great, a Pollack and a chink
81
: (3) 76 76 () 83 Afternoon, Martin, you dumb Italian prick
Walt, you cheap asshole,  should have known you'd come in,  was having such a pleasant day
Why, did you jew some blind man out of a few bucks, give him the wrong change
Walt and the Barber shake hands warmly
Tao is wide- eyed
Who's the Nip
This is Tao
He's a pussy kid who lives next door and 'm trying to man him up a little
Walt points at Tao
Did you see
That's how men talk to each other
They do
What, do you have shit in your ears
Okay
You go out, come back in and give it a try
Come on, Walt
said go out there, come back in and talk to the barber like a man
Do it
Tao shrugs, goes outside, lets the door shut then comes back in
The Barber stands there with a sneer on his face
82
: 77 77 () 84 Wus up, you old Italian prick
The Barber levels a sawed-off  at Tao
Get outta my shop before  blow your head off, you long-haired faggy little gook
Tao is terrified, frozen stiff
Walt and the Barber throw their heads back and laugh
The Barber lowers the shotgun
Jesus Christ, Toad, you don't walk in and insult a guy
What are you, an idiot
But
but that's what you said
That's what you said men say
Not if you never met the guy
If you say that shit to the wrong stranger, they'll blow your goddamned gook head off
Walt and the Barber laugh again
What should  have said
Anything but that
Kid, you shoulda just started with Hi' or Hello
' Right
You should have said, Excuse me, 'm looking for a haircut if you have time
' Yeah
Be polite, but don't kiss ass
Or, even better is act like you just got off a construction job
83
: (2) 77 77 () () 85 Or bitch about your girlfriend or getting your car fixed
Right
Son of a bitch,  just got my brakes fixed and those sons a bitches really nailed me
Screwed me right in the ass
Exactly
Don't swear at the guy you're talking to, swear about another guy who ain't there
My son of a bitch prick fucking boss made me work overtime and he knew had bowling tonight
Or, my old lady bitches to me for two fucking hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute turn on the goddamned game, she starts crying how we never talk
See
You come back in, Toad
Be polite and then you bring up something you can both talk about
It ain't rocket science
Yeah, but  don't have a job or a car or a girlfriend
Walt and the Barber laugh
Sweet Jesus,  shoulda blown his head off when  had the chance
Just go back outside and try it again
And don't mention you're a pussy with no car, girl, job, future or whatever
Come in and act like a man, Toad
Tao goes out, turns around and comes back in
Excuse me, sir,  need a haircut, if you ain't too busy
you Italian son-of-a-bitch prick barber

Boy does my ass hurt from all the guys at my construction job
Walt and the Barber laugh harder

Yeah, yeah
No, not yeah, yeah
Yes, as in yes, sir, 'll do my best
Yes, 'll do my best
You better, because when  vouch for someone, it's my word and don't want anyone making me look bad
No, 'm good
'm totally into this
And don't lay down to people all the time
Always look a person in the eye
When you shake a man's hand, you can usually tell where you stand with him
Walt hands a pair of beat-up   to Tao
Here, stuff these in your back pocket
Cool
Just don't blow this

Walt shakes hands with , the job super
Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon, how the hell are ya
Shitty, but who's gonna listen
Not me
Walt pours himself a cup of the bad job-site coffee
Help yourself, Walt, you dumb Pollack
already did
This is the kid told you about
Tao, this is Tim Kennedy, he's the super on the job
Kennedy looks Tao up and down
Tao looks him in the eye
What do we got, Walt
He's done construction here and there
Whatever you need, he'll pick it up quick
You sure
Sure
You speak English
Yes, sir

Not at the moment

The bus
Jesus Christ, you don't have a car
My headgasket cracked and the goddamned prick at the shop wants to bend me over for $2100
just replaced the tranny in my Tahoe and the sons a bitches fucked me hard, just under $3200
Goddamned thieves
It ain't right
You got that right
Come on in on Monday and we'll find something for you to do

Okay
You owe me one, Walt

Walt and Tao exit and walk back to the truck

What are we doing
What are you gonna put all your tools in, an empty rice bag
81 81 Walt and Tao walk the aisles
Walt grabs a tool belt and tosses it to Tao
You'll need this
Walt then tosses Tao a utility knife holder
And you'll need that
Now where the hell do they hide the hardware holders
can't afford any of this
'll get it, but you're paying me back with your first check
88
: (2) 79 79 () 90 Cool
Walt pitches a hardware pouch at Tao
And you need this too
That should about do it
Not to bitch, but won't  be needing some tools
Tools  got, but  ain't loaning you my tool belt
You can buy tools as you go
appreciate all this
Aw, forget it
No,  really do
Thank you
Walt sticks out his jaw and looks Tao straight in the eye
Tao doesn't know what to expect
Walt puts out his  to Tao
Tao extends his and they
It's really quite a moment for both of them

Tao looks tired after working, but content
He walks past an abandoned lot
The tricked-out Honda pulls up and stops
Smokie, Spider and company get out
Tao looks nervous, but remains calm
What now
Just seeing what you're up to, cuz
89
: 81 81 () 91 'm getting home from work, not that you guys would know much about that
So it's true
You got a job

Jesus Christ, Tao
What do you think
've been sooooo easy on you, but  can't just go on like nothing happened
You can't just leave me alone
Afraid not
The gangbangers grab Tao
Tao kicks and struggles as they yank away his tool belt
Keep your hands off my stuff
Your stuff
You and everything you have is mine
own you
Smokie pulls the tape measure off the belt and smashes it against the pavement
Whatever tools Smokie can't destroy, he tosses onto the roof of the closest building
You can't just walk away from us, Tao
It looks bad
It makes me look bad
Smokie lights a  and exhales
What's the phrase 'm looking for
Oh yeah,  need to save face

Walt squints at Tao
He steps closer
Tao looks away
Walt tilts Tao's head up, he sees the burn
What in the hell happened to you
Don't worry about it
Don't worry about it
Look at your goddamned face
said don't worry about it
It's not your problem

When
Couple days ago
Grabbed me after got off the bus coming home from work
Cowards
did everything  could possibly do
They broke some of your tools
'll replace them

Where does your cousin live
No, Walt,  can manage
don't want you doing anything
Walt is angry, but eventually nods at Tao
Alright
You need any other tools for work
could use a roofing hammer
Go in the garage and get whatever you need

He carefully writes Tao Vang Lor in black ink on the face of his smashed-up tape measure

That's the last of them

Walt kicks him hard in the ribs
How the fuck did you get here
You aren't that hard to track down
Walt boots him again
Smokie curls up in the fetal position
What do you want
Walt kicks him a second time

Smokie exhales
It's just you and me
Nobody knows or has to know  was here

Tell your guys he ain't worth it or whatever the hell you want
You don't talk to him, you don't go near him
This is your one chance
You lay off and no one will ever be the wiser

Walt groans as he goes inside
He's feeling his age

How do you want your dog
mean steaks cooked
Medium, medium well
Funny
Walt pops open a beer and grabs an appetizer that Vu made
Is this Hmoog or Laab
Laab
Isn't it usually a little spicier
Tao, Wa Xam and Sue laugh
Oh whatever, Wally
It does
Usually it's got more zing
Jesus Christ, look at you
've never seen you like this

Kicking back, having a good old time
You're sure pleased with yourself today
And it's a little unnerving if you ask me
Aw, go on
No, admit it
You are
You're feeling pretty good, aren't you
Well, who wouldn't
'm surrounded by beautiful women, it's a beautiful day
Great food, good friends
Hell, even Toad isn't driving me nuts for once
It never ends
'm just kidding
Let me tell you something, Yum-Yum
If Tao doesn't ask you out soon,  will
Don't listen to him, Wa Xam
He's a white devil

'll be damned

Wa Xam and Tao nod
They're a bit embarrassed
Yeah, they're taking the bus
The bus
That's no good charming young lady like this deserves to go in style

Take a limo
Walt nods towards the
The Gran Torino
You'd let me drive it
Sure
Why not

Walt goes from room to room, from Vu to Phong finally to Tao -- making sure no one's been hit
Is everyone okay
Is anyone hit
Sue
Vu
Tao, where's Tao
Tao sits up from behind the couch
Blood pours down his neck
He's stunned
Oh no
Walt lays Tao down and rips open the collar of his shirt
Walt probes around Tao's neck

Hang on
you're just cut, is all
Is everybody else okay
Yeah
Walt looks around at the   in the walls
Tao follows his gaze
It's a miracle no one was killed
They aimed high
Sure enough -- most of the bullet holes are above head level on the walls
Where's Sue
She went to our aunt's
Call her
What
said call her
Get the goddamned phone and call and see if she's there
Tao scrambles for the phone and dials
Tao speaks Hmong to whomever answered
Tao starts to speak faster
He looks at Walt and shakes his head no
For once -- Vu and Phong understand what Walt was talking about
There is anguish on every face in the room
: 97
: 90 90 99 '  - 91 91 Walt sits across from Tao, drinking rice liquor
Walt speaks loudly, without any consideration for Phong who shoots him dirty looks
This is exactly what  didn't want
Damn gooks
Why the hell am  even here
Maybe one of her friends called and she just changed plans
Walt sips the rice liquor
Walt now speaks quietly to Tao
In Korea  learned not to care
The best friends of my life are still missing somewhere in Korea
You harden yourself
Don't let anything get to you
Phong looks out the window and screams
She runs over and swings open the door
Everyone expects the worst
And it comes like a cold wind -- She has been brutally beaten
Her clothes are dirty and torn

Walt looks at her and the glass falls from his hand
Sue staggers into Vu's arms

He tries to stop and cries harder
It's the first time Walt has cried in fifty years
He wails, crying for Tao, Sue, his wife, kids and himself
He lets it all out
Daisy jumps in his lap and he hugs his old dog as he bawls

He's done crying
Family photo albums are scattered around
Father Janovich knocks and eases open the front door
Mr
Kowalski, are you in here
Come on in
Father Janovich comes in and sits down across from Walt
Are you okay
Walt nods
The police finally left
No one is talking
One thing about the Hmong, they keep their mouths shut
've noticed that
Father Janovich picks up a photo album and flips through it
Pictures of Mitch and Steve as babies
You know, there's no way that Tao or Sue are gonna have any peace if these gang guys don't go away
Go away forever
You know it as well as  do
What are you saying

They took Sue to the hospital
She's scared
They're all scared

Believe me, they all know that
Tao especially
He's sitting out there staring at your front door
You know what he expects, Mr
Kowalski
Yeah, well what would you do if you were me
If you were Tao
What would you do
Father Janovich shakes his head
know what 'd do if  was you, or at least what you think you should do
If  was Tao  guess 'd want vengeance
'd want to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys
And you
What would  do
'd come over here and talk to you  guess know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr
Kowalski
Walt nods
Wanna beer
'd love one
They're in the cooler, grab me one too

He opens a Pabst and takes a big swig
Damn all this
It just isn't fair
Nothing's fair, Father
Father Janovich and Walt sit for awhile
So, what are you going to do, Mr
Kowalski
Call me Walt
Father Janovich nods
Alright, what are you going to do, Walt
Not sure yet
All  do know is they don't have a goddamned chance
'  - 94 94 Walt sits at the kitchen table in his robe, drinking coffee
Tao comes in without even knocking on the door
What are you doing

Thinking time is over
Now it's time to knock the ass out of those pricks
know you don't want to hear this, but you have to calm down
What
101
: (2) 93 93 () 103 You have to have a clear head, otherwise mistakes get made
Back away from what's happened, Tao
No
Don't let me down, Walt
Not you
This is going to end, today
Walt stands up and pulls out a chair for Tao to sit in
Sit down
don't want to sit
Just listen up for a second and don't say anything
Tao sits down
Walt rubs his hands together
know what needs to be done need to prepare, this needs to be carefully planned
You know 'm the right man for this
So cool down for a little while and meet me back here at 4
promise you, what needs to be done, will be done

Right now
And do what
You want to go kill your cousin and those other Zips
Mr
Tough-Guy-All-Of--Sudden is out for blood
What do you even know about it
Tao is furious, but says nothing
Trust me, Tao
Cool down and we'll meet back here at four
Okay
Tao doesn't answer

It's filled with bubbles
Walt looks over at Daisy who rests on a towel in the corner
Walt lights a  and exhales
Daisy curls up her lips at the smoke

Give me a break, it's the first time 've ever smoked in the house

He carefully trims around the fence and birdbath

There, all done
Ten bucks American

You

You've never ordered a straight shave, ever
That's right

Unless you're too goddamned busy

Here's a twenty
Keep the change in case you slip and hit my jugular

The carefully measures Walt's shoulders
So you can take it in right here
Yes, sir
Take about an hour
That's great
Thank you
Yes, sir
Never had a fitted suit

Mr
Kowalski, what can  do for you
've come for confession
Oh Lord Jesus, what have you done
Nothing
Take it easy
What are you up to
104
: 97 97 () 106 Are you going to let me confess or not
: 100 100 Walt calmly sits on one side and a very nervous, sweating Father Janovich sits on the other
How long has it been since your last confession
Forever
Bless me, Father, for have sinned
What are your sins, my son
In 1968,  kissed Betty Jablonski at the work Christmas party
Dorothy was talking with the other wives and it just happened
Yes
Go on
made nine hundred dollars profit selling a boat and motor and never reported the taxes which is the same as stealing
Yes
Fine
And lastly,  was never close to my two sons
don't know them
didn't know how
That's it
Whatta you mean, That's it
' It's bothered me for years

Kowalski
Is that so
It is
And every other day until you see the folly in what you are planning
gotta go, Padre
Busy day ahead
Go in peace

Je -- zuz -- Christ

Which one do  get
You ever fire a weapon
106

Tao aims the rifle at an imaginary target
Put that down

What
In Korea, October, 1952
We were sent up to sweep a Chink machine gun nest that had carved us up pretty bad
was the only one who came back
received the Silver Star
want you to have it
Why
When we went up that hill, we knew it was ten to one against us, but we went anyway
This trouble now, it's similar
We're walking right into it
We might not be coming home tonight
The hell we won't
We're going to roll in there and tear ass
Don't be a fool, these guys are waiting for that exact reaction
Tao is quiet for a minute
How many
How many what
How many men did you kill in Korea
Thirteen for sure
Probably more
107
: 101 101 () 109 What was it like to kill a man
You don't want to know
Why not
Go get the Silver Star
It's in a blue wooden box in the cellar
Tao goes downstairs

Tao locates a    and opens it
Tao holds up the
He looks at it closely
-- Walt slams the heavy cellar  shut behind him
Walt slides the   into place with a loud Tao couldn't kick his way out of there in ten years
Of course he tries anyway
Tao is furious
He throws things
What the hell are you doing
Let me out of here, you goddamned son- of-a-bitch
Quit smashing everything
You'll never get out of there, so just relax
You let me out, you crazy old fuck, or  will kill you when get out of here
Tao pounds on the door
Walt pounds back with a strength and authority which startles Tao
You want to know how it feels to kill a man
It feels goddamned lousy
And it feels even worse when you get a medal for bravery right after you mowed down some scared kid when he tries to give up
dumb, scared, little gook, just about your age
shot him with the same rifle you just held upstairs
108
: (2) 101 101 () () 110 've thought about that kid for fifty years
And  promise you, boy, you want no part of it
Me, 've got blood on my hands

Forgive me for tricking you like a dope
'll call someone and have them let you out later
No
Let me out
Tao pounds on the door
You've come a long way
'm proud to call you a friend
You have your whole life ahead of you, whereas this is what  do finish things
You'd just get in the way
Sorry
Walt goes back upstairs, leaving Tao locked up in his cellar
Tao howls to be let out
' 102 102 Walt walks out his front door with Daisy on her leash
He walks over to Tao's house
Phong sits in a lawnchair and glares at Walt
She yells in Hmong as Walt walks straight up to her
Aw, pipe down, you hag
() You're an evil man
've seen your kind before
Back home, white soldiers came to our villages and filled our young men's minds with ideas of glory
Then you'd lead them away to their deaths
Walt, of course, has no idea what she said
Fine,  hate you too

: (3) 101 101 (') () 111 Walt holds out the   to Phong
She looks down at Daisy and back at Walt
She lashes out again in Hmong
need you to watch my dog
Walt holds the leash closer
Phong folds her arms in defiance
Walt exhales loudly
Walt lifts up one of the     and slips the loop of the leash underneath it so Daisy can't follow him
Her name is Daisy
Walt bends down on one knee and lovingly pets Daisy
He scratches her belly
You take it easy, old gal
You good old girl
Walt gets up and walks away without looking back
Phong is stunned; she is silent for once
103 103 Walt walks in and sits down
He nods to the regulars
Good afternoon, gentlemen
Walter, how are you doing
Never been better
Beer and a shot, Walt
think 'll have something different
Walt looks at the liquor display
At the pinnacle of bottles sits a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue
Think 'll try that Johnnie Walker Blue Label

Whatta ya win the lottery, Wally
Naw, just having something special
Walt sips his Scotch and nods
It's good
Why don't you get all the guys the same
You sure
'm sure
This is too good not to be shared
Walt finishes his Scotch and points for one more
Several regulars hold up their drinks towards Walt

He puts in change and dials

Hello

) It's Walt
The key to my front door is under the ceramic turtle
Open the door and go let your brother out of the cellar

The line goes dead as Walt hangs up
Sue jumps up out of bed, pulls on some clothes and runs downstairs
Phong blocks her path
Phong grabs Sue by the arms

Where are you going
You tell me what's going on
Sue squirms away from Phong and runs outside
On her way over to Walt's house, she sees Daisy leashed to Phong's chair
It scares Sue even more
'  - 106 106 Father Janovich paces back and forth
The pulls up to him, which is exactly what he's been afraid of all day
Sorry, Father, we have to go
'm telling you
If we're not here, there will be bloodshed
We've been here for hours
We can't afford to anchor a unit to one location
'm begging you to stay
just got word from my Sergeant, we're pulling the plug
'm staying
No you aren't
My orders are specific
You came with us, you're leaving with us
Father Janovich looks hard at the duplex before getting into the
The   drives off
Walt pulls up in front, gets out of his pickup and slams the door
He looks at the duplex
It's a total eyesore
() What a goddamned mess
You slopes should be ashamed of yourselves
112
: 105 105 () 114 Walt walks up the sidewalk and stops twenty feet from the duplex
Six very scared, very jittery Hmong gangbangers look out at Walt from various doorways and windows
Is that all you swamp rats or is there more vermin scurrying in the shadows
Smokie and Spider step out and stand on the porch
Smokie smiles at Walt
Walt spits on the ground
wasn't sure that you'd
Shut up, gook
'm not here to listen to one goddamned syllable of what a shrimp-dicked little baby midget like you has to say
Spider pulls his
That's right, boy
Defend your boyfriend after he or you or whoever rapes a member of your family
Your own blood, for Christ's sake
Go ahead, pull your pistols, just like a bunch of ridiculous miniature toy cowboys
Smokie and several other Hmong gangbangers pull their guns
You have no honor
You're the scum of the earth and when you're gone, do you think anyone will care
No one will mourn
You won't be missed
All the Hmong are spooked at Walt's absolute lack of fear
Where's Tao, old man
He too scared to come and stick up for himself
113
: 106 106 () 115 No
Tao is too good for this
You pukes aren't worth one second of his time
Walt slowly puts a  in his mouth
Even this slight movement has the gangbangers waving their around
Walt laughs
You boys are a little bit jumpy
You watch it, old man
No,  think you'd better watch it
Walt looks around
Other than the gangbangers, a small group of people have gathered to watch this showdown

She unlocks the
Tao comes out in a rage
Goddamn it

No
Don't you dare
Stay away from them, Tao

They struggle at the top of the stairs and spill into the kitchen floor
Tao runs for the door when something catches his eye
The kitchen table

Walt purposely left the guns at home
Oh God

Walt reaches into his coat pocket
Six Hmong gangbangers simultaneously level their  and
Walt is struck down

Smokie no longer looks tough or hard, he just looks scared
On the street, Walt is being bagged by the ambulance crew
Father Janovich prays over him
Tao steps up to a
What happened
You have to step back
He was a friend of mine

You heard him, step back

He's my friend

Sitting on the porch is Phong who rocks back and forth in her rocking chair
Phong holds Daisy in her arms, gently petting the old dog

Walt is dressed in his new suit
Along with the crowd you'd expect, Tao and Sue are seated near the front
Walt's sons and family are there
Mitch gives Tao a dirty look
Tao looks back at him, his gaze bores right through Mitch
Mitch looks away
Father Janovich steps up to the pulpit and speaks

' Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it
' But Walt was right
knew really nothing about life or death until  got to know Walt
And boy, did  learn
112 112 All of Walt's family are seated in an office as a reads Walt Kowalski's will
Tao is present along with Walt's family
Which brings us to our last item
And again, please forgive the language used in Mr
Kowalski's will

And to my friend, Tao Vang Lor, leave my 1972 Gran Torino on the condition that you don't choptop the roof like a damned spick, don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big gay spoiler on the rear-end like you see on all the other zipper heads' cars
It just looks like hell
If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours
