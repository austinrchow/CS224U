() The shifting lights from the odd passing car play over the faces of
and
, a pleasant-looking couple in their late thirties, dressed up for a night out
Mr
Prescott drives them along a dark hilly two-lane highway
Why do they always put braces on teenage girls at the exact moment when they're the most self-conscious about their appearance

moment
, a thirteen-year-old baby-sitter with braces, opens the door and looks up
In the b

we see  , (Samantha) and  , in their pajamas, lying on their stomachs in the living room, watching television
Sammy is eleven
Terry is eight
: , the , a portly fellow with glasses and a mustache, looks down at
Hello, Amy
(Puzzled) Hi, Darryl
(Thinking) Amy, would you please tell the kids you'll be right back, and then shut the door and come outside to talk to us for a minute
(To kids) Be right back, you guys
You're not supposed to go out, Amy
She's going to smoke a cigarette
closes the door and looks expectantly up at Darryl
Darryl doesn't know how to start
a blustery April day
The steeple of the little white church stands out against the sharp blue sky
It's a small church and a small congregation, but it's full
There's a  of mostly   arrayed in the back
are laid out in front of the , a fiftyish woman with thick glasses and salt-and- pepper hair, who is giving a eulogy
Among the mourners in the second row sit Terry and Sammy, both redeyed, and uncomfortable in their dress-up clothes
Their Aunt Ruth, a pinch-faced woman in her forties, sits next to them
Sammy and Terry are holding hands tightly
Terry wipes his eyes with his free hand
The Minister addresses her remarks to the children
Sammy is hanging on the Minister's every word; Terry is shifting his eyes and his seat as if it will kill him to sit still another minute
: On the beautiful hill overlooking the beautiful windy green country, , twenty-seven years old now, puts flowers on her parents' graves with quick, practiced movements
She is a nice-looking young woman of a neat appearance, saved from primness by an elusive, pleasantly flustered quality
An unsuccessfully neat person
She is dressed in office clothes -- white blouse, dark skirt, high heels, light raincoat over everything
She picks out a couple of weeds and then bows her head and closes her eyes
-- Scottsville is a small town
Main Street
Run-down old stores next to a new bank, a couple of chain stores, a few restaurants of varying ambitions
Civil War statue
World War  statue
World War  statue
Residential streets wandering away from Main Street up and down hills
You know there's a minimall somewhere nearby
fair amount of activity during the daytime
'  pulls up across the street from where an eight- year-old  in a secondhand baseball jacket and a school knapsack is waiting at the curb
This is her son, calls out the car window
Rudy, come on
'm really late
Rudy hurries across the street and gets in the car, slinging his knapsack into the backseat
() How was school
Stupid
Why do you say that
We're supposed to write a story for English homework, but they didn't tell us what it's supposed to be about
What do you mean
mean they didn't tell us what it's supposed to be about
They said do whatever you want
So what's wrong with that
Nothing
just think it's unstructured
(Smiles) Well, 'm sure you'll be able to think of something
If you can't, 'll help you
/
/' Sammy stops the car outside a heavily (' ), and  gets out
Don't forget your backpack
Rudy returns to take his knapsack out of the back
It's not a backpack, it's a knapsack
Don't forget your knapsack
Rudy hoists his knapsack out of the back
Give me a kiss
Rudy gives her a kiss and puts his arms around her and squeezes her neck
He withdraws, slams the door
As Sammy  , he slogs up the long twisting driveway
-- Sammy gets out of her car, which is parked in one of the half dozen spaces in the little parking lot allocated for bank employees
She hurries toward the employees' entrance, fixing her skirt as she goes
Sammy hurries down the clean hallway in the back past , a pleasant-faced fellow employee
Guess who's been asking for you
Oh no, really
Mabel nods and passes by
on a big door that says "Manager" and has half the letters of the previous branch manager's name taken off it
(Inside) Yeah, come in
Sammy swings open the door
, the new branch manager, is unpacking a box
Sammy is surprised to see he is in his early thirties and very good-looking in a boyish sort of way; he wears shirt-sleeves and tie, and a wedding ring
Mr
Everett
Yeah: Brian
Brian
Hi
'm Samantha Prescott -- 'm the lending officer
Yeah, hi, how are you
Come on in
Sit down
Sammy comes into the office and sits
am so sorry  was late
Yeah, we missed you before
got held up
Believe me, it is not something  make a habit of
'm sure it's not
Actually -- could you just, could you close that door for me
Thanks
Sammy gets up and closes the door
' Sammy sits in front of Brian's desk
Brian is behind the desk listening
-- so  always just run out at 3:15 to pick him up and then run him real quick over to the sitter's house
Anyway, Larry never minded about it and  was just hoping it would be with you too
Well -- Samantha --  realize that Scottsville is not exactly a major banking center
No it's not
No --  know it's not
But it's kind of a personal challenge to me to see what we can do to bring local service up to the same kinds of standards we'd be trying to meet if we were the biggest branch in the state
And that means  don't want anybody running out at 3:15 or 3:30, or whenever the bus happens to come in that day
Now is there anybody else who can pick your son up after school
Does your husband work in the area
Do you -- Oh -- No -- Rudy Sr
isn't "on the scene
" So to speak
Well,  can give you a couple of days to make some other arrangement, but
Well -- Brian
understand what you're saying, and  think it's great
do
Because there's a lot of things around here that could use some attention
Believe me
But 've honestly been meeting that bus every day for four years now and it really does take just fifteen minutes, and if  take the time out of my lunch hour
'd really prefer it if you would make some other arrangement
(Brightly) 'll do my best
Brian kicks back in his chair and puts his hands behind his head
How old's your son
He's eight
That's a terrific age
'  () Sammy and Rudy drive home in silence
The orange sunlight flickers through the trees and onto their faces as they drive along
(') The same house that Sammy grew up in, with sixteen years' more wear on it
Sammy's car swings expertly by the mailbox, and Rudy reaches half his body out of the passenger window and gets the mail
' Sammy comes into the house carrying two bags of groceries
Rudy follows, looking through the mail
Sammy passes through the house and goes into the kitchen
You got a letter from Uncle Terry
What
Her whole face lights up and she grabs the letter
She tears it open and reads it with growing excitement
' Sammy opens her
Inside are tax files, household files, miscellaneous files
She puts Terry's letter away in a very full file marked "Terry -- Correspondence
" The folder is stuffed with other letters, on all different kinds of stationery from all over the country, all from Terry
Sammy and Rudy are eating dinner
It's a biggish house for just two people
Whose room is he gonna stay in
He can stay in the little room
(Pause) But you know what
He's not going to live here
He's only gonna stay for a little while
And it's  if you don't remember him, because you were only six the last time he was here
But it'll be nice if you got a chance to get to know each other a little bit
Don't you think
Rudy looks worried and doesn't answer
Rudy is on the floor, writing in his school composition notebook
Sammy comes downstairs
Rudy
Would it distract you if  put on some music
No
She puts on a , sits down and picks up a book
She looks at Rudy, who is writing away
Did you think of a story
Uh huh
What's it about
My father
Pause
What about your father
It's just a made-up story about him
Can  read it when you're done
It's not very good
Don't say that
Rudy keeps writing
Sammy is smoking a cigarette and drinking a glass of wine and reading Rudy's story
It upsets her
' Sammy sits on the edge of her bed, not dialing the phone
She catches a glimpse of herself in her parents' floor-length mirror with the worn, heavy wooden frame
Against her better judgment she picks up the phone and dials
' Sammy and   are eating dinner at Dawson's, the only fancy restaurant in town
Bob is in his mid-thirties, a Realtor, a decent, ordinary guy
Anyway, Bob, it's sort of this adventure story, and Rudy's father is this secret agent or something, working for the government
And it just made me feel weird
You know
Because  never really say much to him about Rudy Sr
, because  don't know what to say
And  don't know whether  should just let him imagine whatever he wants to imagine, or whether  should sit him down sometime and tell him, you know, that his father is not such a nice person
You know
Well
don't know, Sammy
What have you told him already
Not much
He knows  don't have the highest opinion of him
And he knows don't want to see him or know anything about him, ever
But  tried to keep it kind of neutral
Anyway
could go into a lot more detail, believe me
Well
It's an interesting problem
But  don't really know what to tell you
It's a little outside my personal field of expertise
All right
'd be glad to give it some thought
He is smiling at her
What
Nothing
'm just glad to see you
'm glad you called me
bet you were surprised
Um -- a little
Bob drains his wineglass
Sammy cuts at her steak
' Sammy and Bob lie in Bob's bed, a few minutes after having made love
They are very far away from each other, but trying with difficulty not to let on
should get going
Really
Yeah
've got the baby-sitter
But
Thanks for a lovely evening
Oh
Thank you
She kisses him
She tries to make it sexy, but he's not into it anymore and he politely restricts the kissing
' Sammy stands in her slip brushing her teeth in front of the mirror
She brushes vigorously, looking at herself while she brushes
: -- , The corner window of a grim little apartment building on a very grim street in a grim little city
'  -- , tiny apartment with a bed, chair, table, fridge, and not much else
One window has a broken pane and an old sheet neatly thumbtacked over it to keep the wind out
comes in
He is twenty-five years old: a real mess with a certain natural appeal
He wears old jeans, very old hiking boots, and a lumberjack-style coat
He takes a wool hat off his head
His hair is longish and dirty
is sitting at the table by the fridge
She is barely eighteen, frail and damaged
Hey, Terry
Hey
Terry looks at her and smiles encouragingly
She smiles back
Where'd you get the hat
Oh,  got it on the street for a dollar
It's nice
Well, you know, it's pretty much your standard woolen hat
Yeah,  had a very similar reaction to it
Sheila looks away
Silence
Can  get that money from you
Yeah
Sorry
As she opens her purse, Terry takes a few vague steps toward her
She takes out a tiny hippie-ish woven wallet and gives Terry all the money in it: a twenty and two ones
Is that all you have
Yeah
Can you borrow some cash from your brother
Um, yeah, but that would involve speaking to him
Well, 'm definitely gonna be gone for a couple of days at least, Sheila
Why do you have to stay so long
Because my sister is not a bank, you know
can't just show up and ask her for -- You seem to think my brother's a bank
Oh Sheila can we just cut out the puerile crap
'll be back just as soon as  can
am not the kind of man that everyone says  am
know you're not
'll call you tonight
Pause
Don't you wanna tell me you love me
love you
That was really convincing
Well
think after this is over you should seriously consider moving back home
(Short laugh) Oh, yeah
(Gives up) All right
You gonna call tonight
Definitely
She puts her arms around him and holds on
--  -- Wide open shot of hilly country and a big sky overhead drives into the shot along the curve of the highway
() -- Terry is seated on the toilet seat in the cramped bathroom smoking a joint
He takes a huge hit and holds it in for as long as humanly possible
He blows out what's left, takes another equally huge hit and holds it in
The   along a smaller, heavily wooded roller- coaster road
() Terry looks out the window at the passing scenery
The sunlight flickers on his face
: The bus rolls past the hilltop cemetery
Terry shifts uncomfortably in his seat
:  "  "  whizzes by
Houses start dotting the side of the road
Terry starts getting very agitated
Terry stands at one end of Main Street, backpack over his shoulder, as the
He looks around at the town going about its Saturday afternoon business
Loud country-western music is blaring as Sammy, wearing an apron, sets a big vase of flowers on the kitchen table and hurries to the oven
There are also cookies, a pie, evidence of massive fancy cooking
She puts on her oven mitts and takes a lasagna out of the oven, as the phone rings
She picks up
(Into phone) Hello
' Sammy practically bursts out the front door
She has changed into nice clothes
Terry secrets himself in a small dark alley
He takes out his carefully wrapped half joint and lights it
, he looks at the sunlit slant of street beyond the alley
Terry, fairly well stoned, walks along Main Street
skinny man emerges from his hardware store to greet Terry and shake hands
Terry says "Hi," but keeps on walking
He passes some other people
He almost runs right into  , sixteen years fatter and grayer
Whoa there
Sorry
The Sheriff recognizes Terry and breaks into a big smile
God damn
Terry Prescott
How you doin'
Gimme a cuddle
The Sheriff gives Terry a big bear hug
Terry is wasted and selfconscious but smiling
He pats the Sheriff's back
How you doin', Darryl
Which way you headed
'm just goin' to see Sammy at Dawson's
Can  walk with you a little
Sure, yeah -- So Sammy says you been out in Alaska
Yeah,  was workin' out there for a little while
The Sheriff walks along with Terry
Terry, very self-conscious about smelling like pot, fumbles to light a cigarette
The Sheriff does not seem to notice
-- Sammy says she's gettin' postcards from all across the country
Yeah, 've been all over the place
They stop outside Dawson's
Well, it's good to have you back here, 'll tell you that
Thanks, Darryl
Keep enforcing the peace
Well, that'll be a little harder now that you're home, but 'll do what can
No, man, 'm reformed
Oh, yeah
Good to see you, kid
Thanks, Darryl
Darryl walks away
Terry stands outside the restaurant looking for Sammy
Behind him in the restaurant Sammy is sitting at a table, talking to the waitress
She sees Terry and gets up immediately, smiling like crazy as she threads her way through the tables toward the door
Terry turns and sees her
He breaks into a big smile, tosses his cigarette and goes into the restaurant
Through the window we see them make their way toward each other
Sammy throws her arms around him
He hugs her back with a big involuntary smile as the   slowly
' -- Terry is studying the menu, over-intently
Sammy is beaming at him
Sorry about yesterday -- don't care -- was studying the bus description
and  just
got on the wrong bus -- mean  missed my stop -- don't care, Terry
'm just so glad to see you
'm glad to see you too, Sammy
Um
are you coming from work
Um, no, it's Saturday
Yeah, no, it's just
you're dressed so formally
Oh
No
You know,  just thought 'd -- You know  thought it was a special occasion
which it is
No, it's good
thought 'd dress up too
He gestures to his shitty clothes
That's
You look fine
( strange, unsuccessful joke) Yeah, this is the haute cuisine of garments
What
Nothing, nothing
Um
So how are you
'm fine
How's Rudy
We're fine, Terry
How are you
(Pause) mean -- Yeah
-- Where have you been lately, Terry
--  know,  haven't been -- got a postcard from you from Alaska
Yeah,  was up there for a while
But that was in the Fall, Terry
Yeah,  know 've been out of touch
was a little worried
(Pause) mean -- Oh,  been a lotta different places
Um
went down to Florida for a while
was doing some work in Orlando
've been all over the place
Well
just wish you would have let me know you were
Yeah
didn't realize it'd been so long
He looks around the restaurant
(Beaming again) Are you gonna stay in town for a while
Well,  don't know
got all these things  gotta do back in Worcester
Oh
Yeah, so 'm probably not gonna be able to stay more than a day or so
Oh
Well
That's all right
'm kind of trying to keep to a schedule of sorts
It's a long and worthy story but  won't trouble you with it right now
He twists around and looks all over the restaurant
She watches him
Are you expecting someone
Who would  be expecting here
You just keep looking around, that's all
No,  was just wondering if we could get some more refreshments, actually
He laughs
Looks down
Silence
He looks up at her
've actually got to confess to you, Sammy
that the reason you may not have heard from me for a little while is that 've been kind of unable to write
on account of the fact that was in jail for a little while
You were what
couple of people in the restaurant look at them
Terry notices but Sammy does not
Well,  did a little time,  guess, in Florida
For, uh, just for bullshit
What
It was just bullshit
What did you do
didn't do anything
Does it occur to you that maybe  was wronged
No
Well, could  please -- Oh my God
-- Would you please let me -- -- What happened
got into a fight in a bar down in Florida
Which  was not the one who instigated it, at all
But they worked up all this bullshit against me and they threw me in the pen for three months
didn't write you because didn't want you to get all upset about it
just figured you'd figure was on the road for a little while
know it was stupid and 'm sorry
really didn't mean to make you worry
But you know what
can't run around all the time doin' stuff or not doin' stuff because it's gonna make you worry
Because then  come back here, and  tell you about my fuckin'
traumas, and  get this wounded little "'ve Let You Down" bullshit, over and over again, and it really just -- cramps me
Like just want to get out from under it
And here  am back in this fuckin' hole explaining myself to you again
-- Can you please stop cursing at me
mean,  realize 'm in no position to, uh, basically say anything, ever -- But it's not like 'm down there in some redneck bar in Florida having an argument with some stripper's boyfriend and  suddenly think, "Hey
Maybe this'd be a good time to really stick it to Sammy and get myself locked up for a few months
" 'm sorry
Me too, man
mean "welcome home
" Hey -- You don't write me for six months,  have no idea where you are -- 'm sorry -- --  don't know if you're alive or dead -- 'm sorry -- -- and then you show up out of nowhere and tell me you were in jail
'm sorry, 'm sorry, 'm sorry, Sammy, 'm really sorry
The patrons are all either looking at them or trying not to look
Silence
Sammy
What
Um
'm in the midst of a slight predicament
What do you need
Money
Um
Yeah
'm broke
gotta get back to Worcester tomorrow
got this girl there, and she's kind of in a bad situation
just need to borrow some money
Whatever you can spare
(Pause) 'll pay you back
'll pay you back, man
really wish Mom was here
So do , man
Nobody knows what to do with you
know how they feel, man
Silence, except for the sounds of the restaurant
Terry
Can  ask you something
Sure
(With some difficulty) Well --  mean, do you ever go to church anymore
Come on, Sammy, can we not talk about that shit
Do you
Um -- No, Sammy
don't
Can you tell me why not
Um, yeah
Because  think it's ridiculous
Well -- can you tell me without like, denigrating what  believe in
Because  think it's primitive,
think it's a fairy tale
Well --  mean, have you ever considered that maybe that's part of what's making things so difficult for you
No
-- That you've lost hold of -- well, not just your religious feeling, but lost hold of any kind of anchor, any kind of trust in anything
mean no wonder you drift around so much
What could ever stop you
How would you ever know if you had found the right thing
Well, uh, 'm not really looking for anything, man
'm just, like, trying to get on with it
The  approaches with their salads
Here we go
She sets them down on the table
and  Thank you
The  leaves
Silence
Terry picks at his salad
Sammy doesn't touch hers
She watches him miserably
-- Terry watches while Sammy inserts her card in the  and punches in her code
Terry waits
She punches in $300
The machine grinds out her cash
She gives him the money
Thank you, Sammy
'm really gonna pay this back
She takes her card back and puts it back in her wallet
' Sammy and Terry get in the car
Sammy isn't saying anything
Where we going
To pick up Rudy
She puts on her glasses and her seat belt
She won't look at him
Well
do you not even want me to visit now
'Cause  can catch the bus at five o'clock if that's what you want
Well, of course  want you to visit, you idiot
've been looking forward to seeing you more than anything
've been telling everyone  know that you were coming home
cleaned the whole fucking house so it would look nice for you
thought you were gonna stay for at least a few days
It didn't occur to me that you were just broke again
wish you would have just sent me an invoice
She stops
Terry is now totally contrite
Terry sits in the tub
Water drips from the faucet
He is staring blankly up at the pristine blue-and-white tiled wall and the neatly folded matching towels
Sammy and Rudy are in the living room
Rudy is playing with a Game Boy type game
In the b
g
,  is dialing the
He looks clean and shaved, his hair is neatly combed
(Into phone) Hi, is that Malcolm
Hi, this is Terry Prescott
been trying to get ahold of Sheila and there's no answer, and  was just wondering if she -- She what
He sits down
(Into phone) When
Well -- Is she all right
Well, could  talk to her
Well, could you give her a message that  -- He is hung up on
He slowly
Sammy notices that something's wrong
He looks at her from across the room
That girl 'm with tried to kill herself
What
She tried to kill herself
' Terry is sitting on the bed, addressing an envelope to
He puts the $300 in the  and seals it
He sees Sammy standing in the doorway
He starts to unlace his boots
Do you have everything you need
think so
Sammy comes into the room and sits next to him
He is very busy with his laces
What are you going to do
don't know
Send the money  guess
Maybe you should stay home for a little while, Terry
Yeah, maybe that'd be a good idea
He starts crying
Sammy pats him
bright, clear, blue-skied Sunday morning in Scottsville
Inside the little white church they're singing
People are filing out of the church
We also see a couple of the bank employees, including  and his very pretty six months'  wife,
We find  and
Sammy is chatting to some neighbors
Rudy is bored out of his mind, waiting for her
'  -- Terry is lying on the sofa, smoking, with his feet up and boots on, watching Sunday morning
On the coffee table are his dirty ashtray, dirty bowl and spoon, Rice Krispies box and a milk carton
' Crickets buzz loudly outside the house
Sammy, in her bathrobe, comes down the stairs into the living room
Terry is on the sofa playing with Rudy's Game Boy
He barely looks up when she speaks to him
'm going to bed
Do you have everything you need
Yeah
Thanks
Good night
Good night
Pause
Terry, 'm really glad you're home
Terry tries to smile at her
Yeah, me too, Sammy
He goes back to his game
She hesitates, then heads back up the stairs
' Sammy, Terry and Rudy sit at the kitchen table
Sammy is dressed for work
Rudy is dressed for school
Terry is also fully dressed, drinking the last dregs of a mug of coffee
He is tired, but listening to Sammy very carefully, as if receiving difficult and critical instructions
So we'll drop Rudy off at the bus, then all you have to do is drop me off at the bank, and just pick Rudy up at 3:30 in front of town hall, and drive him over to Carol's house
And that's it
She's on Harvey Lane, right past where the Dewitts used to live
Rudy knows where she lives
Terry glances at Rudy, then back at Sammy
-- ' Sammy walks past ' , carrying a big stack of files
She drops three of them on the desk
is typing away at her
The colors are a garish  background with letters
God, Mabel, don't those colors hurt your eyes
Oh no, they keep me fresh
Sammy proceeds down the hall and into -- ' Brian is at his desk, busy working between stacks of papers
She knocks on the open door
Yeah
(Looks up) Hi, Sammy
What can  do for you
Um, Brian
Did you want us to turn this time sheet in at the end of the day, or do you want it at the end of the week
Oh, yeah, end of the day'll be fine
Seems like an awful lot of extra paperwork
Brian hesitates, shrugs and smiles
like paperwork
Sammy looks at him with a blank smile
-- ' Sammy sits down at her desk and notices the time: 3:30
She reaches for the phone, then decides not to call
-- The  on the front of the   reads 3:31
The   pulls up across from the town hall and disgorges a handful of kids
Rudy comes out with his knapsack, looking around
: Terry, across the street, sits on the hood of Sammy's car, smoking
Rudy walks over to him
You showed up
Looks that way
'  () Terry and Rudy drive in silence
Terry glances at Rudy
Put on your seat belt
It pushes on my neck
What
It pushes on my neck
It's uncomfortable
Well, when somebody slams into us and you go sailin' through the windshield, that's liable to be uncomfortable too
So put on your seat belt
Rudy puts on his seat belt
Mom's parents died in a car accident
know
They're my parents too
They are
Well, yeah
Your mom is my sister
Yeah,  know
So that means we have the same parents
Oh yeah
They drive in silence for a moment
Terry glances down at Rudy
-- ' Sammy, laden with files, plops down at her desk as Mabel is passing by
Mabel puts a phone message down in front of her
Um -- Carol just called
She said Terry and Rudy never showed up at her house
You've got to be kidding me
: Brian, talking to an employee, sees Sammy, across the bank, hurrying out the employees' exit
Hey, Sammy
Sammy doesn't hear and exits
' Terry and Rudy are banging nails with , a young guy Terry's age
Terry, hammering with swift, accurate blows, glances up and watches Rudy for a second
Rudy is hammering away with no great skill
Hey
Look
He moves Rudy's hand down toward the end of the handle
You hold it further down, you're gonna get a lot more power
You should be able to put that nail down with two or three hits
Look: With two swift strokes he drives the nail flush into the wood
Try it
That's not the way  hold it
Well, the way you hold it is wrong
Why can't  just do it my own way
Terry looks at him unsympathetically for a moment
(Shrugs) You can
He goes back to work
Rudy resumes hammering
After a moment he switches his grip and starts hammering Terry's way
Terry looks up and watches him
' Sammy pulls up, fast, and gets out of the car
Hearing the hammering from the backyard, she walks quickly around the side of the house and stops short when she sees Rudy hammering happily away with Terry and Ray
She watches them working, unobserved, with mixed annoyance and relief, and finally with quiet pleasure, because it's a very cheerful sight
Half the staff has gone home
Sammy, in her coat, picks a up off her
It reads: ",
-- " ' Sammy stands in front of Brian's desk
Brian
Did you want to see me
Yeah
was kind of wondering what happened to you today
Oh -- Didn't Mabel --  had a false alarm about my son
Yeah,  kind of thought you were gonna work that out
Well,  did work it out -- more or less -- Then why're you running outta here in the middle of the day without a word of explanation to me, Sammy
Brian, don't yell at me
'm -- 'm not yelling
'm just gettin' a little frustrated here
Well Brian: Sorry, could you close the door please
Sammy closes the door
Sammy, Terry and Rudy sit at dinner
The atmosphere is lively and cheerful
And Eddy Dwyer lives in Buffalo, with his wife and two sons, if you can believe it
That is depressing
Why
He just never struck me as the marrying type, that's all
Who are you talking about
Wild kids we used to know
Were you a wild kid
Not compared to your Mom
Yeah, right
You don't believe me
No
Ask her
Mom, were you
No comment
Rudy is amazed
Terry looks at him like, "Told you so
" ' Sammy is asleep in bed
' Rudy is asleep in bed
Terry sits at the bar, drinking beer
There are a few locals in the place, but it's pretty dead
He looks around; his energy is too restless for the near-empty bar
' The  , and   , smoking a cigarette
He's plastered
He looks around the room
Looks at Rudy's toys
Picks up some superhero comics and sits on Rudy's bed
Then he spies Rudy's  , picks it up and starts reading it
(
) What are you doing
Terry looks up
Rudy is half-sitting up in bed
Oh -- Just readin' some of your compositions
Why are you smoking
Um
Because it's bad
Don't ever do it
won't
You know this used to be my room
Yeah
(Pause) Do you want it back
No
Rudy is very relieved
Terry keeps reading
Rudy watches him
Did you fight in Vietnam
No
wasn't even born yet
Were you ever in the army
No
My father was in the army
know
Unfortunately he didn't fight in Vietnam either
Were you friends with him
Not really
We had some friends in common,  guess
didn't like him very much
Why not
Well, he wasn't very likable
Why do you say that
don't know
He was always -- He always had to be better than you at everything
You know
Like if you were all playing basketball or something, everybody's havin' like a friendly game and he's like ready to kill somebody if his team didn't win
Or like if you told like a joke or a story, he always had to tell a better one
Kinda gets annoying after a while
Plus it was pretty scummy how he split on your mom and you
He was a prick
Probably still a prick
Fortunately for you though, your mom is like, the greatest
So you had some bad luck and you had some good luck
(Pause) You mind if  ask you a personal question
don't know
Do you like it here
mean, in Scottsville
Yeah
Why
don't know
My friends are here
like the scenery
don't know
know,  know, but it's so
There's nothing to do here
Yes there is
No there isn't, man
It's narrow
It's dull
It's a dull, narrow town full of dull, narrow people who don't know anything except
what things are like right around here
They have no perspective whatsoever
No scope
They might as well be living in the nineteenth century because they have no idea what's going on, and if you try to tell 'em that, they wanna fuckin' kill you
What are you talking about
don't know
Terry lies on his back and smokes
You're a good kid
-- ' There's a  on Sammy's chair
",    -- " Sammy, just arrived at work and still in her coat, looks down at the note
-- ' Sammy listens to Brian
Yeah
This doesn't apply to you directly, Sammy, but 've noticed that some of the employees have their monitors set with all kinds of crazy colors
Purple and polka dots or what have you
And it's not a big deal, but really, this is a bank
You know
It's not really appropriate
So 'm just asking that people stick to a more quote unquote normal range of colors in future
Sammy looks at him blankly
Like  say, it doesn't really apply to you
No, my computer palette's pretty conservative
-- ' Mabel is typing angrily at a   with
Sammy walks by
Mabel is so mad she doesn't even look up
-- ' Sammy sits agitated for a moment
She makes a decision, picks up the phone and dials
' Bob is in his little realty office with two , a husband and wife
He picks up his
(Into phone) Bob Steegerson
(On phone) What are you wearing
(Into phone) Mom
Sammy
'  -- Terry is holding a broom looking up at the ceiling
Sammy passes by and stops
What's up
Terry taps the broom handle against the ceiling
Do you know you have an enormous leak from the upstairs hall
He pokes again
portion of the ceiling collapses on his head in wet chunks of plaster and muck
Um, yeah, thanks,  did
' Sammy, in front of the mirror, finishes dolling herself up for her date
we hear loud banging
Sammy puts on her earrings and goes into -- Are you guys sure you're gonna be Yes
Yes
Sammy approaches  and
They are bent over a big nasty trench in the floorboard
There are wood shavings and greasy pipe segments all over, and black smeary smudges on the walls nearby
What is happening here
It's just -- The problem is that the pipe is corroded all the way along the length of the hall
So every time  put in a new piece it starts leaking further down
Why don't  just call the plumber
Why
He's not gonna do anything different than what 'm doing
(Happily) Yeah
We're making it worse
No we're not
Shut up
Terry yanks the wrench and a  of   comes out of the pipe and splatters the wallpaper and pictures and Sammy with gritty gray water
She looks at them
Thank you
Thank you both
Bob and Sammy -- cleaned up and wearing a different outfit -- are bustling out the front door
Terry stands by
Now, call if there's any problem, and if 'm not there, 'm either on my way or on my way back home
Sammy gets into her coat
Bob opens the front door
(To ) So lights out at ten
and don't spend the whole night watching
Nice to meet you, Bob
You too
(To ) What's your idea of the whole night
Two hours tops
Bob holds the door for Sammy and smiles at her
There is some confusion about who should go out first
Finally she goes and Bob follows
The atmosphere between them is fairly awkward
' Terry and Rudy are watching  from the sofa
What's your feeling about Bob
don't really know him that well
Terry looks at his watch
have bad news for you
He picks up the remote
No
and turns off the
They sit there in the sudden silence
Great
What are we supposed to do now
Do you know how to play pool
've played it
The Wild Moose is a noisy roadside bar sitting under the stars
Terry and Rudy get out of the car
Rudy looks apprehensive
don't think they let kids in there
Well, we're not allowed to watch any more , so it's this or nothing
But if we run into any trouble, let me do the talking
Terry swings the door open
:  lot of men and women at the bar or in booths, eating and drinking
Smoky, crowded and very loud
As he follows Terry through the crowd various patrons notice him -- some of the looks are friendly, some blank, some cold, i
e
, what's a kid doing in here
: Terry and Rudy stand side by side facing the players and waiting players gathered around the table
Terry waves a few bills
got a hundred bucks here says me and my nephew can beat anybody in here
Only we gotta get the next game 'cause he's gotta be in bed by ten o'clock
: , very nervous, and the 1st Pool Player are side by side shooting for break
Terry is behind Rudy coaching him
Just hit it nice and soft
Nice and soft
They hit the balls
Rudy just clips his ball and it doesn't go anywhere
1st Pool Player's ball hits the opposite bank and comes almost all the way back
(To ) Sorry
God damn, Rudy
thought you said you could play
Rudy doesn't answer
Terry winks at him
: 1ST    --
-- The balls scatter
Nothing drops
steps up to the table, chalking up his cue
Boys, it's all over but the cryin'
: Of Terry running the table and everyone watching
Three-ball in the side
One-ball in the corner
Nine-ball off three cushions and into the corner, and the eleven-ball into the side
Rudy watches him
' Bob and Sammy sit at Bob's dining room table
The little bachelor apartment looks pretty good
Tablecloth, candles, wine, everything
Bob has just dropped a huge bombshell
Bob
Are you serious
Yeah
don't know what to say
-- mean,  know  haven't exactly been the most
decisive
guy
In the past
don't know: 'm tired of foolin' around
And  love you
'm totally
don't know what to say
Well, you could always say "Yes
" (Pause) Or you could think about it first
That's it:  want to think about it
Fair enough
Terry has sunk everything but the eight ball
He leans over to sink it
It's a fairly easy shot
He lines it up carefully, and deliberately shoots it so it stops two inches from the corner pocket
Ohhhh
: Terry and Rudy sit side by side watching as the 2nd Pool Player passes back and forth between them and the camera, running the table
"Oohs" and "All rights" emit from the spectators
Sudden silence
Then the clack of the balls connecting great common  goes up
looks up at Terry
It's all yours, baby
Rudy looks at the : The eight-ball is two inches off the corner
The cue ball is a few inches away from it piece of cake, for an adult
Rudy looks deeply unconfident
He gets up and tries to line up the eight-ball
Terry is right next to him
Just make sure to hit it really gentle
But firm
And hit it a little low so you get some backspin
Don't even hit it
Just kiss it
long moment
What do you mean, kiss it
mean tap it
Firm but very, very softly
And don't shoot until you know it's going in
Everyone is relatively quiet
Rudy takes a few practice strokes and then hits the cue ball, straight, but too softly
It crawls toward the eight and taps it toward the corner, slower and slower, hangs there, and
"
"   and everyone claps and cheers
Terry grabs Rudy
Rudy smiles, ecstatic
That was great
: Darryl the , in his civvies, drinking a pint of beer, notices Rudy and Terry
: Terry picks Rudy up and turns him upside down
Rudy laughs
' The house is dark
Terry and Rudy are walking from the car to the house
We creamed those guys
We creamed them
(Stopping suddenly) Ssh
Don't move
They listen

It's them
They break for the door, Terry fumbling for his key
He gets the door open
Go
Go
Go
He and Rudy run inside the house
The lights go on
' pulls into the
-- Rudy runs up the stairs
Wait a minute, gimme your jacket
Rudy tries to take his jacket off fast but gets his arm caught in the sleeve
He tries to shake it off
What are you doing
can't get my sleeve out
They  Bob's
Terry makes a comic panicked face and leaps up the stairs two at a time
: Sammy waves to Bob
Bob waves back as he drives off
Sammy goes to the front door, opens it: Terry and Rudy are in a giggly tangled panicked heap at the top of the stairs, shaking Rudy's arm and sleeve, frantically trying to get the jacket off
Sammy comes in
They freeze
What is going on in here
Um -- We were just out doing some star-gazing, and, uh, Rudy lost track of the time
Which  totally warned him about
(To Rudy) You are a bad kid
Rudy is brushing his teeth
Terry pokes his head in
(In a low voice) Hey:  think it's
Just don't tell her where we went, 'cause she'll be really mad at me
won't
(Suddenly dark) Hey -- 'm not kidding, Rudy
won't
Terry gives him a "You better not" look, then leaves
Rudy continues brushing his teeth
' Sammy is tucking Rudy in, stroking his hair
Did you know my Mommy used to take me and Uncle Terry out at night to look at the constellations
Yeah
Did you see that one, what's the one -- It looks like a big ""
Cassiopeia
Yeah
Sammy comes out of Rudy's room, smiling
It's dark
She sees a  on under '
She walks toward it and steps into the , falling down violently
Ow
Shit
Terry is putting a butterfly Band-Aid on Sammy's wound
It's a nasty, bloody gash, just shy of needing stitches
've got a great idea
Why don't you let me call the plumber
Do whatever you want
Oh, does that make you mad
No

Brian, get off my ass
Excuse me
didn't change the colors on your stupid computer screen
Well, that's all you gotta say
(On "that's") There is nothing wrong with the work do here
have been doing just fine, the whole time before you came here -- And if you think that riding people in this petty, ridiculous way is the way to improve service in this bank or anywhere else  think you're out of your mind
Pause
didn't say there was
Could  please -- Could  please -- May  respond
No, that's really all  have to -- May  respond
(Beat) First of all,  don't appreciate being spoken to with that kind of language
That's not the way  talk to you, and 'd appreciate it if you wouldn't talk that way to me -- Well -- Second of all, if you say you didn't change the colors on my computer screen, then of course  accept your answer
But you and  are gonna have to find a way to work together -- Brian -- But that's not gonna happen with the attitude, it's not gonna happen with the lateness, it's not gonna happen by fighting me every step of the way -- , well not you, you're not late, but too much of that stuff goes on around here -- am not late and  do not have an attitude -- Well then don't tell me 'm late if 'm not late
'd really like to finish
' : The whole staff is listening to the muffled raised  from inside the office
especially is listening guiltily
The rain falls on Main Street
' The rain comes down hard on Orrin's construction project
Tarps cover everything
No work today
-- The rain comes down on the , looking through the restaurant  at , eating lunch alone at the counter
He goes inside, shakes the rain off himself and goes over to her
They start talking
We : They were where

we
:   , about Terry's age, comes thumping down the stairs and goes into the living room, carrying his toolbox
Terry looks up at him
, you're all set
Terry glares at him
The plumber turns and goes out
is  in a doorway for Terry
He is wet and cold
The  pours down
Brian is showing his wife, , the bank
He is very solicitous of her, nervously introducing her to the employees, who are not responding very warmly
Nancy is not in a warm mood either; she's very testy with Brian
This is Chuck
Chuck, this is my wife, Nancy
Hello
Nice to meet you
This is Mabel
Hi
Nice to meet you
, at her desk, watches Brian and Nancy make their progress through the bank
Nobody is being very friendly, and Brian suddenly seems awkward and vulnerable
Brian and Nancy reach Sammy's desk
This is Sammy, our lending officer
Sammy, this is my wife, Nancy
(Friendly) Hi
It's nice to meet you
Brian --  gotta sit down
Sure -- Let's go in my office
He glances nervously at Sammy as he leads Nancy away from her desk and toward his office
He murmurs something to Nancy, who responds in a low but very testy voice: 'm fine
She roughly pulls her arm away from his
Sammy watches them go into his office
Rudy trudges resolutely through the pouring rain toward the center of town
He is completely drenched
' Sammy knocks on Brian's open door
Brian
Yeah
(
) Mom
Sammy sees to her left, down the hallway -- Rudy
Rudy is at the end of the hall, drenched and shivering, but cheerful
Rudy is in the car, somewhat dried off, waiting
Sammy and Terry stand in the employee entrance doorway
Look, 'm glad you guys are getting along so well -- like, you have no idea -- but if  can't rely on you to remember to get him once a day
You can
-- And what are you doing taking him to play pool in the middle of the night, and then telling him to lie to me about it
Pause
don't know
/
' /' Terry and Rudy pull up in front of the driveway
Terry is in a silent rage
The rain has let up
Get out of the car
What are we doing
You're going to Carol's house and 'm going home
Why can't  come with you
Because if you're such a baby you gotta tell your Mommy about us playin' pool when  totally asked you not to, and  gotta listen to her shit all day, then you're goin' to the baby-sitter's so you can stay at the baby house
But  didn't tell her
You know what
Don't even fuckin' talk to me
didn't
Just get out of the car
He leans over Rudy roughly and pushes open the door
Rudy gets out of the car and marches down the long driveway
He bursts into tears
Terry watches him go, then drives off
-- Sammy walks through the empty bank hall and into Brian's office
Brian is at his desk
You're working late
How did your wife like the bank
Oh, fine
She wasn't feeling so great
That's too bad
No --  don't mean -- She's not ill
She's just
don't know
Pregnant
That's it
She's pregnant
It can make you kind of cranky
Yeah
Pause
Listen, 'm sorry we've been stepping on each other's toes --  -- 'm not actually that bad a guy -- Yeah,  am too
know you're not, Brian, but you're driving everybody crazy
Well,  -- 'm just trying to do my best here -- And 'm gettin' it from all sides
know you are
Anyway
We'll work it out
Well
could use a beer
could use a tranquilizer
Brian and Sammy sit at a table in the corner of the dimly lit pub
It's a medium noisy place with various locals drinking beers and eating hamburgers and chicken dinners
Last  heard, Rudy's Dad was living over in Auburn
But that was last year
Must be so tough raising a kid on your own
Although 'm beginning to get the idea my wife wouldn't mind a crack at it
Oh
It's just the hormones
Well, no, it isn't
But never mind
The waitress brings them two boilermakers
and  Thanks
She leaves
Sammy and Brian pick up their shots
Well, here's to improved employee- management relations
Amen
They click shot glasses and drink
You can't judge all of Scottsville by the people in that bank, believe me
Well -- Let's -- Let's not talk about the bank
Let's just forget about the bank for tonight
Good idea
They sip their drinks, smiling
Sammy looks at him appraisingly
/
' / Sammy and Brian are making out in the front seat of his car
This goes on for a while, getting heavier and heavier
Sammy
Yeah
want you to tell me who changed the colors on my computer screen
'll never tell
They start kissing again in the cramped space
Brian bangs his head
They laugh
We pull back and away from the car
The sodden trees spout faucets of water down on the car
The kitchen is dark
Sammy comes in, her hair a little wet, and turns on the light
She goes to the telephone
There's a  in Terry's handwriting: "
" (
) Where were you
Sammy jumps, startled
Terry is in the kitchen doorway
Nowhere
had dinner with my boss
Kind of a late dinner, ain't it
Yeah
How was Rudy
Fine
Did the plumber come
Yes, the fucking plumber came
Terry -- Give me a break
Pause
What's the matter with you
Nothing
'm just tired
You want to smoke some pot
No  don't
Why, you got some
Sammy and Terry stand side by side on the porch, passing a joint back and forth
It has stopped raining but the trees and roof are still dripping
The crickets are chirping loudly
So
Bob asked me to marry him
Wow
(Pause) Are you going to
don't know
If he'd've asked me this time last year  would have probably said yes
But the minute he said it,  don't know,  felt like somebody was trying to strangle me
Well
bad sign
know
(Pause) Plus, Terry
(Whispers) fucked my boss
What
know
And his wife is six months pregnant
Jesus Christ, Sammy
know,  know
He passes her the joint
She declines
He puffs away
The water drips off the porch and the crickets chirp
She puts her head on his shoulder
He puts one arm around her and puffs away with the joint in his free hand
Terry, 'm sorry  got so mad before
just don't want him, you know -- terrified of "telling," if there's -- Uh, well, that's not really his problem, Sammy
Sammy straightens up
Oh really
What's his problem
His problem is that he's like totally sheltered because you treat him like he's three, instead of eight, so that's how he behaves
Oh yeah
And how do you think he should behave
think he shouldn't have to run and tell his Mommy every time he does something she might not like, for one thing
Uh huh
And what do you -- (On "and") mean  took him to play pool
It was a little clandestine thing we did for fun
It wasn't like a big secret,  mean who cares
was actually trying to be nice to him
But he's so freaked out that he disobeyed your orders that he has to fuckin' squeal on me and  have to listen to your fuckin' shit all day when  didn't even fuckin' do anything
First of all, he didn't tell me anything: Darryl did
Second of all,  don't really give a shit if you took him to play pool:  was mad at you because you left him standing at the bus stop in the rain
But no, don't want you telling him not to squeal, because  don't want him put in that position
(Losing ground) Well
that
is a perfect example of what 'm talking about
You are in idiot
They stand apart now
Silence
Darryl told you
Yes
They stand there
The rain gutters drip
Sammy, coat on, arrives at her desk and puts her purse down
There's a  on her
" --
" -- , coat off, carrying a stack of folders, as she walks from her desk, around the corner, down the hall, past a couple of employees and to '
She taps on it
Brian is at his desk
Morning
Yeah, good morning
Could you get the door
: Sammy shuts the door
and , standing near the door, look at each other: i
e
, Sammy's in trouble again
: Sammy stands by the closed door
Brian comes out around his desk
Listen --  just -- Brian kisses her
She drops her folders and they make out against the door
: The employees click away at their PCs
Mabel exchanges a quiet word with Chuck
: Brian has Sammy pressed against the wall with her skirt hiked up and is trying to get both of their underwear out of the way
It's not so easy in their office clothes
Sammy tears away
Brian, that's enough
falls back, breathless
Sorry
He lunges at her again
They kiss some more
: Sammy comes out of the office, more or less composed, carrying her folders
She heads down the hall past the other employees, including Mabel, and surreptitiously readjusts her scrunched-up underwear
' Sammy and Bob sit at lunch
Sammy is picking at her food
You're awfully quiet
'm sorry
Um
Have you thought at all about what  said
Of course 've been thinking about it
So
Any decisions
Or -- do you still want to think about it some more
Well --  mean --  don't know, Bob
mean, we haven't exactly been going steady the last few months, if you know what  mean -- Yeah, no,  know -- -- and then we see each other twice and you suddenly say you want to get married
mean
No, you're right, you're right -- What are you talking about
Pause
don't know
Maybe this is
Last year  sort of thought you were possibly interested in that
idea
but  was the one who, you know, wasn't "ready" at that point -- So that's why  thought things kind of slowed down with us
Don't make me feel bad for you
(Bristling) don't want you to feel bad for me
Sammy, Terry and Rudy are all watching
Sammy and Rudy are in pajamas
Nobody's happy and nobody's talking
The
Sammy goes to it and picks up, surprised because of the hour
(Into phone) Hello
(On phone) It's Brian
Sammy turns away and lowers her voice so Terry and Rudy won't overhear her
Brian
Where are you
Brian is on the pay phone outside a gas station
'm buying milk
just thought 'd say hello
Sammy doesn't say anything
Look,  know it's probably too late, but is there any way you can come out for a little while
Brian,  think you're going crazy
know  am
Can you meet me
Um,
comes down the stairs, fully dressed, into the living room, where Terry and Rudy are still watching
Um --  have to go out for a minute
Do you want anything
Like what
don't know
Where are you going
Yeah, where are you going
just have to go out for a little while
Where
Yeah, where
just have to go to Mabel's house
Why
You know what, Rudy
It's personal
This is a personal matter that has to do with Mabel
just have to go see her for a little while
Terry gives Sammy a look like, "You've got to be kidding
" Sammy tries to shush him with a conspiratorial look back
She goes out
Terry and Rudy sit in front of the , alone
Listen
Listen
'm sorry  said you squealed on me
was totally out of line, and  really owe you an apology
(Pause) Did you hear what  said
(Staring at the ) don't care
'  () Sammy drives, listening to music
She shakes her head at herself
Sammy's car and Brian's car are parked side by side outside a roadside motel
In the motel room, Sammy and Brian, half-clothed, make love rather hurriedly on top of the unmade creaky bed
Outside the motel, Sammy and Brian get into their respective cars and start their motors
'  () Sammy drives in the other direction
She breaks into a smile, and then she laughs
Then she stops
' Sammy lies awake plagued by guilty feelings
-- Sammy heads toward the little white church building
--  -- the  and Sammy drink coffee in silence
(Gently) What's on your mind, Sammy
Well, a lot
But principally was just wondering if you had an opinion
If you know someone, in your family, or just someone you really care about, and they just can't seem to get ahold of themselves
The   on Main Street
Rudy watches wide-eyed as Terry places on the sales counter two rods and reels, a bunch of lures, two fishing hats, a box of swivels, a knife and a fish scaler
You know who this is for
Me
That's right, my little friend
(To the saleslady) Hello
We're going fishing
'  -- Sammy, Terry and Rudy are all putting away the groceries
Everybody seems to be getting along
got a new rod and reel, five lures, got a hat,  got a knife and  got a fish scaler
That's great, honey
, the
Sammy starts to move toward the door, but Terry is closer
'll get it
Sammy watches him go
/ Terry opens the door
It's Ron, the minister, in his civvies
Rudy is playing basketball by himself
'  -- Terry, Sammy and  sit in the living room
Sammy and Ron are drinking coffee
Through the window we see occasional glimpses of Rudy playing basketball in the backyard
There is a heavy silence in the room
Well
'm not really sure why you're here, Ron
mean,  realize  haven't exactly been a model citizen since got here, but compared to how things have been goin' for me lately, thought  was doing pretty well
He turns to Sammy
And  also find it kind of discouraging that you seem to think need some kind of spiritual counseling or what have you, so much so that you're willing to disregard the fact that  don't believe in any of this stuff at all -- Well
didn't mean to discourage you -- mean it's really kind of insulting
Can  say something here
(Pause) Sammy asked me to come and talk to you, because it's her opinion that you're not gonna find what you're looking for the way you're looking for it -- How would she know
But 'm really not here to try to get you to do anything, or to believe anything
And 'll tell you the same thing  told her, which is that as far as 'm concerned the only way she can help you is by her example -- by trying to be a model for you, by the way she lives her life
Terry smiles
And that doesn't mean she's supposed to be a saint, either, if that's what you're smiling about
didn't realize  was smiling
moment
You know, Terry, a lot of people come to see me with all kinds of problems
Drugs, alcohol, marital problems, sexual problems, health problems -- Great job you got
Well
like it
Because even in this little town,  feel like what do is very connected with the real center of people's lives
'm not saying 'm always Mr
Effective, but don't feel like my life is off to the side of what's important
You know
don't feel my happiness and comfort are based on closing my eyes to trouble within myself or trouble in other people
don't feel like a negligible little scrap, floating around in some kind of empty void, with no sense of connectedness to anything around me except by virtue of whatever little philosophies can scrape together on my own
Well -- Can  ask you, Terry: Do you think your life is important
You mean -- Like, me personally, my individual life
Yeah
Well
'm not sure -- What do you mean
It's important to me
guess
And like, to my, you know, the people who care about me
But do you think it's important
-- Do you think it's important in the scheme of things
Not just because it's yours, or because you're somebody's brother
Because  don't really get the impression that you do
Well,  don't think
don't particularly think anybody's life has any particular importance besides whatever -- you know -- whatever we arbitrarily give it
Which is fine
mean we might as well
think 'm as important as anybody else
Silence
don't know:  lot of what you're saying has a real appeal to me, Ron
lot of the stuff they told us when we were kids
But  don't want to believe something or not believe it because  might feel bad
want to believe it because  think it's true or not
'd like to think that my life is important
Or that it's connected to something important
Well, isn't there any way for you to believe that without calling it God, or religion, or whatever term it is you object to
Yes
believe that
Sammy, Terry and Rudy are all eating dinner
Terry is drinking a beer
His mood is dark
So Sammy, what example will you be setting for us tonight
Sammy doesn't answer
Terry, Sammy and Rudy are watching
Terry has another beer
What time are we getting up to go fishing
We're not going fishing
What do you mean
Why not
think you should go fishing with Father Ron
don't want to go fishing with Father Ron
Well, 'm not takin' you
Sammy starts to say something to Terry, stops herself
'll take you, sweetie
Rudy doesn't answer
Sammy and Terry are in the hallway
Sammy holds a stack of folded sheets
realize that you're mad at me -- (Deadpan) 'm not mad at you
-- but he didn't do anything to you
And you cannot promise a little boy that you're gonna -- (On "boy") just, you know, after all that religious conversation,  just realized it's probably not so good for him to be spending so much time with someone like me who doesn't believe his life is important in the scheme of things -- Would you please
'm serious
(Practically choking) Listen
(Pause) am sure, if you put your mind to it, you can think of some other way of getting back at me besides this
So would you please just give it some thought, and take him fishing tomorrow
would, Sammy,  just don't think it'd be good for him
Pause
You suck
She throws the sheets at him and storms away
Terry walks through the living room and  the front door,  it behind him
' Sammy sits by the phone in her bathrobe
She picks it up and : '
, watching  on the sofa with Brian, picks up the
(Into the phone) Hello
She gets up, walks around, sits down again
Picks up the phone and
It

Bob, making a sandwich for himself, picks up the phone
(Into the phone) Hello
Pause
She sweeps the  and the nightstand
Pause
She calms down and puts them back
The ancient answering machine is convulsively
She   and it stops
The congregation is coming out of the church and milling around at the steps
, with Rudy at her side, is saying good-bye to some neighbors
She watches pregnant  and go down the steps
: Beyond Brian and Nancy,  pulls up at the curb in her car
He rummages around and produces which he waves, somewhat sheepishly
: At top speed, Rudy runs away from Sammy and the church, toward Terry and the car
Terry and Sammy exchange a look from the distance
Services are over
Everyone has gone home
' Sammy sits with Ron
Anyway
don't know what the church's position is on adultery and fornication these days, but  felt really hypocritical not saying anything to you about it before, so
What is the official position on that stuff these days
Well
it's a sin
Good:  think it should be
but we don't tend to focus on that aspect of it, right off the bat -- Why not
Well -- think you should
Well -- Maybe it was better when you came in and they screamed at you for having sex with your married boss, and were really mean to you, and told you what a terrible thing it was
Maybe it'd be better if you told me how 'm endangering my immortal soul, and if  don't quit 'm going to burn in hell
Don't you ever think that
Um
No
Well, it's a lot better than all this "Why do you think you're in this situation" psychological bullshit you hear all the time
Well
Why do you think you're in this situation
With which one
All of them
Pause
feel sorry for them
(Pause) Isn't that ridiculous
Ron shrugs: i

, "not necessarily
" -- Terry and Rudy are side by side on a small footbridge over a wide running stream, fishing
The sunlight slants through the canopy of trees; the birds are chattering; it's gorgeous and peaceful
've never been so bored in my life
Yeah
We really shoulda been out here around seven or eight
What time is it now
Two-thirty
Silence
The birds sing
Was my father a good fisherman
Yeah, your father was good at all that stuff
He knew everything about the woods, everything about fishing, everything about hunting and everything about cars
If he wasn't such a pain in the ass he would've been a lot of fun to be around
Maybe he's nicer now
doubt it
Well,  think he is
How would you know
Did you ever meet him
No
Were you ever curious to meet him
guess so
Well, he doesn't live very far from here
thought he lived in Alaska
No --  lived in Alaska
Your dad lives in Auburn
Far as  know
(Pause) We could look him up in the phone book
Wanna try
All right
-- But -- 'm sure  don't have to say this, but 'm not kidding, man: Don't -- tell -- your -- mother
' is standing by his kitchenette, extremely nervous
Sammy sits on his sofa
Do you want to go for a walk, or a drive
It's really nice out
No
'm not gonna stay long
Bob, don't want to get married
Pause
've really thought about it a lot, and if you had asked me last year 'm sure  would have said yes
Oh
Thank you
But 'm not sure it would have been a good idea then either
'm going through a really hard time right now and  just think that getting engaged to you or anyone would be just about the stupidest most self-destructive thing  could possibly do
And  really think you have to grow up
Well, how about we fix up my personality some other time
(Pause) really hope we can still be friends
(Quietly sarcastic) Oh, yes, me too
She looks at him miserably
Bob
This is so crazy
mean
don't even understand why you don't even get it
What do you want me to say
Everything you said about me was true, Sammy was just a big chickenshit jerk, and now 'm payin' the price
Bob
She goes over to him
He gets up
What
Well --  don't know
don't know
Sammy,  love you wish  could say it in a more interesting way
just --  love you
Well --  mean --  love you too -- He puts his arms around her and kisses her
She responds very warmly
Just as things are heating up, she suddenly remembers something and jolts away
Oh shit
What's the matter
gotta go
'm sorry -- Where do you have to go
(Off the top of her head) 'm supposed to --  gotta get Mabel back her car
Well
don't understand
How are we leaving things
Oh God,  don't know
Call me later
Brian sits on the edge of one of the beds watching some daytime Sunday show on the motel
There is a knock at the door
He gets up, turns off the  and opens the door
It's Sammy
Sorry 'm so late
Yeah,  was just about to give up on you
Well -- maybe it would've been better if you had
She comes into the room and starts walking around briskly and nervously
mean -- Look,  don't mean to be unsympathetic about your domestic situation, whatever it is, but 'm just beginning to think that if people tried a little harder to stick to their commitments and started taking a little responsibility for their actions, they might end up having a lot less trouble generally
That's all
Hey, that's what 've been trying to tell you guys at the bank
Well,  really don't think  can do this anymore
Brian and Sammy lie under the starchy sheets
Brian's eyes are shut
Sammy is very upset with herself
This is incredible
Mmmm
That is not what  mean
'  () Terry and Rudy drive along
Terry looks down at Rudy and smiles
Rudy is tense and won't look at him
'  as Terry drives slowly past dilapidated little houses in a very depressed residential area
Terry is scanning the house numbers
Maybe we should call first
Well -- We're right here
He pulls up outside a small, plain, run-down ranch-style house with a lot of junk out front, and gets out of the car
Rudy stays in
Come on
Rudy gets out of the car and comes around
Terry waits for him, and then they walk up to the front door
The buzzer says "
" There he is
His last name is Kolinski
Yeah
Ring the bell
Rudy pushes the doorbell
They wait
There's some noise inside and some voices
The sound of
, a tired-looking young woman around Terry's age, opens the door
Yes
Hi
We're looking for Rudy
Who should  say is calling
An old friend
(
) Who is it
He says an old friend
(
) How old is he
appears behind Janie
He's around thirty, wiry, dressed in jeans and an old shirt
He doesn't look good
He recognizes Terry
Hey
Hey, Rudy
Rudy Sr
sees Rudy, who is looking up at him
His face falls
Hey
Rudy doesn't answer
(To ) Hi, 'm Terry
Hello
And this is Rudy
You don't say
Rudy, meet Rudy
Rudy Sr
looks away, shaking his head
moves away from the door
'll just be in the kitchen
Nice to meet you
Janie goes into the kitchen
Rudy Sr
watches her go
if we come in for a minute
What the hell are you doin'
What do you mean what am  doin' -- Rudy Sr
starts walking toward Terry to make him go back out the door
Could you step away from the door please
Well we just wanna -- Could you step away from the door please
All right, all right
They all go outside
Rudy Sr
pulls the door closed behind him
What are you doin' here
just wanted the kid to see you -- Well, now he saw me
(He looks at Rudy) Now you saw me
(To Terry) Now would you mind
Man, you are really -- Look: 'm tryin' to be polite
So would you just take off
It's : Just take off
just wanna -- Do you know what you're doin'
Just get outta here
You know what, man
You're still a fuckin' asshole
'm an asshole
Get outta here
Rudy Sr
shoves Terry
Terry belts him, and suddenly they are throwing wild punches at each other
Rudy goes sprawling in the dirt
Terry knocks Rudy Sr
down and starts pummeling him brutally
Janie comes out of the house and jumps on his back, trying to pull him off
Get your fuckin' hands off him
Terry throws Janie off him, grabs Rudy Sr
again and resumes beating him up
Janie jumps back on top of him
Two neighbors run toward the melee to break it up
: : The cops have arrived
The 1ST  is talking to Rudy and Janie
The 2ND  is talking to Terry
Rudy Sr
's face looks puffy and beaten up
3RD  stands apart with Rudy, who is watching the whole thing rapidly and jerkily through this section: 1ST And you're not the boy's legal guardian
don't even know if that's my kid
They just showed up
We never seen them before
used to know his sister -- just came down here to talk to the guy and all of a sudden he starts shovin' me
2ND Listen up
Listen up
You're gonna have to step back and just calm down -- (To
) You're a lyin' fuckin' piece of shit
2ND (To ) You're gonna have to step back
We have a right to protect ourselves
What else do you need to know
: The 2ND  puts handcuffs on Terry
Rudy watches
2ND Now give me your right hand
This is such bullshit
He started the whole thing and you're arresting me
2ND Listen up
Now -- Listen up
Stop talkin'
Terry, stop talkin'
: : As the 3RD  walks Rudy to one cop car, Rudy watches the 2ND  guide the   into the other car
Rudy gets in the back of the car and looks out at
and  talking to the 1ST
Rudy Sr
is looking at him over the 1st cop's shoulder
2ND -- idea where we might be able to contact his mother
No, because he's not my Goddamn kid
The cop cars' doors slam first on Terry and then on Rudy
The room is dark
Sammy and Brian are asleep, half under the covers
with a
What time is it
(Startled awake) What's the matter
Sammy looks at the clock radio
9:20
Oh my gosh
: Sammy and Brian are on opposite sides of the bed, getting dressed
Hey, you know, Nancy's gonna be gone for the rest of the week
You know
Brian
Yeah
Well,  don't want to
mean, couldn't we just
mean, could we give it a rest
Pause
Um -- Yeah
Sure
If you want to

just think
don't know: We had a great little fling
You know
Let's not push it
(Pause) mean, is that
just -- Yeah
Sure
You're right
Pause
So are we still friends
(Nods tersely) Mm hm
Sure
All right
Good
' The crickets are chattering
The phone is ringing inside the house

The battered answering machine  convulsively but does not pick up

Around two o'clock this afternoon

Thanks for coming over

No problem
Sammy is on the phone
Bob sits at the table
(Into the phone) Well -- what about other towns
Yes
Yes

Well what am  supposed to do all night
' Sammy and Bob sit silently in the living room, waiting
She is smoking
The   12:40
Sammy is going crazy with anxiety
' The  rings inside the house as the early morning sun slants through the trees around the house
The   wakes , on the sofa in his clothes -- ' -- and Sammy, half asleep on top of her bed, also in her clothes
She  the
(Into phone) Hello
'  () Bob drives Sammy along the highway
She stares out the window
She turns and watches Bob drive for a long moment
Brian walks through the morning bank activity and stops at Mabel's desk
Anyone hear from Sammy this morning
didn't
Uh huh
Well, if anyone ever hears from her ever again, will you let me know
Yes
On the steps of the police station, Sammy, Rudy and Bob wait as Sheriff Darryl shakes hands with the Auburn Sheriff
The Auburn Sheriff goes inside
Darryl comes over to Sammy
It's gonna be all right
We got on the phone and talked to Rudy Sr
a little bit and he's calmed down, just wants to forget about the whole thing
Darryl,  really appreciate this
The Sheriff nods, but he's not thrilled to be here
' The
Sammy comes in the front door, Terry and Rudy behind her
She snaps on the lights, hurries to the phone and picks up
Behind her, Rudy goes upstairs and Terry plunks down on the sofa and turns on the
Hello
,
Yeah, it's Brian
Brian -- What the hell happened to you today, lady
is about to answer, but she just   instead
is stunned into sheer gaping fury
Feverishly he hangs up and dials again
It
Sammy picks up
Hello
You're fired
She hangs up again
' Sammy is tucking Rudy into bed
Rudy
Yeah
Is there anything you want to ask me, about your father
Oh, that wasn't my father
What
That wasn't him
heard him tell the cops
No -- Rudy -- that was him
But that was him
wish it wasn't, but it was
(Very quiet) No it wasn't
Rudy
Yes it was
Your father's name is Rudy Kolinski
He lives in Auburn
Sammy comes out of Rudy's room, shutting the door softly
We the  going downstairs
She stands at the top of the stairs for a moment
Terry is watching  on the sofa with his feet up on the coffee table
Sammy comes down the stairs and into the living room
He keeps watching
She doesn't sit
She is trembling
Could you turn that off for a minute please
He turns off the
You don't have to say anything, Sammy
want you to leave
Terry looks at her
What do you mean
mean  don't think you should live here anymore
don't think you know how to behave around an eight-year- old and  don't know how to make you stop, so  think you shouldn't live here
don't know what else to say
don't know how to behave around an eight-year-old
That's right -- think you don't know how to behave around an eight-year-old
Are you out of your
Silence
Now you just listen to me
may not be the greatest mother in the world, but 'm doing the best  know how
And he doesn't need you to rub his face in shit because you think it's good for him
He's going to find out the world is a horrible place and that people suck soon enough, and without any help from you
Believe me
Sammy tries to get ahold of herself
Her voice is shaking
think you should get your own place
thought, if you want, you could -- 'll be glad to help you out financially -- What do you mean, Get my own place
mean  -- You mean in Scottsville
Yes
Why would  do that
Why don't just leave, period
(Quietly) Well
If that's what you want to do, that's fine
But that's not what 'm saying
You are a very important person to Rudy, and you are the most important person to me
But 'm saying that  can't take any more of this -- Well -- --  thought -- maybe you could sell your half of the house to me, and could pay you whatever it is over a certain amount of time, and that way -- No, you know what
'll just go
He turns the  back on
(Very quietly) Well -- that's not what 'm saying
Terry shrugs and watches
' Terry is packing his bag
Rudy is watching
Where are you going
don't know
just want to get out of this town
And if you've got any sense when you get old enough you'll get out of here too
Your Mom's gonna live in this town for the rest of her life, and you know why
Because she thinks she has to
Don't ask me why, but that's the truth
She thinks there's all these things she has to do, but you want to know one thing about your Mom
She's a bigger fuck- up than  ever was
mean,  know messed up
You think  enjoy getting thrown in jail because  wanted you to face that prick your Dad like a little man and see what kind of a guy he is
know  got a little carried away, and  lost my temper just a little bit -- which is not the end of the world either, by the way, just for future reference --And now she's kickin' me out of my own house because -- you know, because fucked up a little bit
Which totally admit
was like -- totally ready to admit that
He is finished stuffing his clothes into his backpack
could go with you
Well, thanks, man
But , uh,  can't really take care of you
Sammy is flipping channels on the
The
She is surprised
She gets up
Terry comes thundering down the stairs, carrying his backpack
Is that for you
Yeah, 'm just gonna stay at Ray's till  take off
You don't have to do that
Yeah
Well, that's what  wanna do, so -- Well but -- Are you gonna come back to say good-bye
No -- 'm just gonna take off
'll see you later
Well -- Terry opens the door
is there
Terry closes the door behind him
Sammy listens to the
The sound
' Terry is bunked down on Ray's horrible sofa
In the b
g
, there is a light on in the bedroom
Terry fluffs his pillow and shuts his eyes
' Dressed for work and school, Sammy and Rudy walk to the car
Look
know you're upset about Uncle Terry leaving, and so am
But he's just not in control of himself, and don't want him hurting your feelings anymore -- or mine
And you may not like it, but that's how it's gotta be
don't care
You don't care
don't care either
' Sammy sits in front of Brian's desk
Well
'm sorry you're havin' all this trouble
Thank you
But you made a pretty good speech to me yesterday about people sticking to their commitments
Yeah
Well
you made a commitment to this bank, Sammy
To this job
know 'd -- And to working things out with this tough new son of a bitch boss of yours
And whatever might have passed between us after hours doesn't mean you just walk away from that commitment -- yeah, even when you have a legitimate family emergency
'm really sorry  didn't -- Which is why  think in the calm cold light of day, we should both think real hard about whether or not you really want to continue on here at Merchants National Trust
You're not serious
you're not happy, 'm not happy, it's not good for you and it sure as heck isn't good for the bank
Pause
You know you're the worst manager we've ever had
Come on, Sammy
By far the worst
don't wanna trade insults with you
Well,  don't want to be fired, Brian
've been working here for seven years
Well -- And if  were you 'd be a little nervous about firing an employee just had an affair with
That's -- Don't threaten me, Sammy: 'm not threatening you
-- It's just an area  think we should explore
'm not thr -- You explore it
'm going back to work
She heads for the door, stops
Oh, and  have to pick up Rudy today because there's no one else to do it
But 'll find someone as soon as have time
Yeah
Fine
Why don't you just take over the whole bank
Sammy hesitates in the doorway
This thought has never occurred to her before
She goes out
we see Sammy and Bob having lunch
Sammy watches him eat, full of mixed feelings about him
Sammy is at the stove, making pancakes
She puts a last pancake onto Rudy's plate and brings it to him
Well,  called where Uncle Terry said he was gonna stay, and there was no answer, so  don't know if he's still in town or not
Rudy doesn't answer
Rudy
Are you not speaking to me
Rudy doesn't answer
Well, 'm sorry you're so mad at me, but  only did what  thought  had to do, and  hope you don't stay mad at me for the rest of your life
He opens the maple syrup and pours it on the pancakes
Rudy, that's too much
He keeps pouring
She grabs the bottle from him and upsets some of the dishes on the table
You gotta cut this out
What did  do
You don't know what you're talking about
There was nothing else  could do
can't explain it better than that, but you can't go on like this because you don't know anything about it and you don't know what you're doing
(Frightened) , 'm sorry
don't want you to be sorry,  just want you to
will
will
'm stopping, 'm sorry
He comes around the table to her
See
'm stopping
'm not doing it
See
'm not
He's very alarmed
Sammy looks at him for a long moment
Terry walks through the little cemetery gate and makes his way up the hill through the tombstones
He reaches his parents' graves
He looks at the tombstones for a moment
He puts his hand on top of one headstone, then the other
He sits down and smokes
He looks up at the
It's a beautiful deep blue sky dotted with billowy white clouds
He looks out over the hilly scenery
After a moment he shakes his head a few times
He doesn't even know he's doing it
He sits there
' The    as Terry walks into the house
He walks past it, to the fridge, gets a beer and opens it
It He picks it up
(Into phone) Ray's house

Hi

No -- 'm leavin' tomorrow
Well -- What time
There's a bus at nine
Well -- Can  -- 'd like to see you before you go

Or do you want to have breakfast or anything
And  think Rudy would really like to say good- bye
Yeah --  don't know
mean -- Terry, you can't just leave like this
-- All right, all right

All right -- But just -- We have to be out of the house by eight, so -- don't want to tell Rudy you're coming unless you really think you can make it -- Yeah -- No -- 'll be there
All right
All right
Sammy is clearing the breakfast dishes
Rudy is finishing up his cereal
The clock reads 7:50
You should get your sneakers on
Sammy comes out and looks up and down the road
Rudy sits in the living room in his baseball jacket
His knapsack is on the floor beside him
He looks at the : 8:06

The are getting in
for the bus driver, and Sammy, Terry and Rudy all get out
So Rudy
If  write you a letter, will you write me back
Yeah
, well, that's gonna be pretty nice for you, because  write a pretty Goddamn interesting letter
Yeah, we'll see
All right
Well, say good-bye
Bye
Rudy hugs Terry
Terry hugs him back
He is suddenly overcome and presses his lips to the top of Rudy's head
Rudy walks to the  and gets on
The bus pulls away
Alone now, Sammy and Terry are not that comfortable
He moves to get back in the car, and she does the same
Sammy and Terry sit on a bench near the bus stop
Terry's backpack is by his side
Do you need some cash for the bus
No,  got a few bucks
Aren't you gonna be late for work
Oh -- Yeah
That's
(Pause) Terry,  don't even know where you're going
Oh, well,  didn't really have a concrete plan yet
have to go back to Worcester and get my stuff
Oh, are you gonna try to see that girl
Well
Yeah
You know
Thought maybe 'd try to show my face
Let her brother have a crack at me
What
No
don't want anyone to have a crack at you
'm just kidding
just thought
Just thought 'd check up on her
(Pause) Anyway, after that,  don't really know
've been thinking about Alaska a lot
still got some friends out there
don't really know
Anyway, 'll write you
You will
Sure, Sammy
Of course  will
You know that
Pause
What is gonna happen to you
Nothing too bad
But  gotta tell you,  know things didn't work out too well this time
Well, Terry -- but it's always really good to know that wherever  am, whatever stupid shit 'm doing, you're back at my home, rooting for me
do root for you
She starts crying, and looks down
Come on, Sammy
Everything's gonna be all right
Comparatively
And 'll be back this way
feel like 'm never gonna see you again
Of course you will, Sammy
You never have to worry about that
Please don't go till you know where you're going
Please
do know where 'm going
'm going to Worcester and 'm gonna try to see that girl
And then depending on what happens there,  thought 'd try to see if there's any work for me out West
And if there is, 'm gonna head out there for the summer and try to make some money
And if there isn't, 'll figure something else out
Maybe 'll stay around the East
don't know
really liked it in Alaska
It was really beautiful
You just -- It made me feel good
And before things got so messed up was doin' pretty well out there
Seriously
But  couldn't stay here long, Sammy:  don't want to live here
But 'm gonna stay in touch
And 'll be back
'Cause  want to see you and  want to see Rudy
'll come home for Christmas
How about that
We'll have Christmas together
(Pause) Come on, Sammy
You can trust me
Still looking down, Sammy shakes her head, tears leaking down her cheeks
Come on, Sammy
Look at me
Look at me
She looks at him
Hey, Sammy
Remember when we were kids, remember what we always used to say to each other
(Pause) Remember when we were kids
Of course  do
She throws her arms around his neck
He pats her gently
/ The   and Terry comes up the steps and into the bus
Outside, Sammy watches him pay the driver and move through the bus toward his seat
The
Sammy waves till the   all the way down  , turns a corner and is gone
Terry, in his seat, turns forward and watches the view go by
He smiles a little
'  () The morning sunlight flickers through the windshield into the car as Sammy drives along toward work
She passes the and sees that it's 9:20
She dries her damp cheek with a forearm and rolls down her window to let the morning breeze blow through
Squaring her shoulders a little, she drives through town at a slow and easy pace
