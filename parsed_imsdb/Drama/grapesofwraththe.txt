At some distance, hoofing down the highway, comes Tom Joad
He wears a new stiff suit of clothes, ill-fitting, and a stiff new cap, which he gradually manages to break down into something comfortable
He comes down the left side of the road, the better to watch the cars that pass him
As he approaches, the scene changes to a roadside short-order  on the right side of the road
From it comes the sound of a phonograph playing a 1939 popular song
In front of the eatery is a huge Diesel truck labeled: The driver, a heavy man with army breeches and high- laced boots, comes out of the restaurant, the screen door slamming behind him
He is chewing on a toothpick
waitress appears at the door, behind the screen
When you be back
Couple a weeks
Don't do nothin' you wouldn't want me to hear about
We see him climbing into the cab of the truck from the right side
Getting behind the wheel, he is releasing the handbrake when Tom appears at the driver's seat window
How about a lift, mister
Can't you see that sticker
He indicates a "No Riders" sticker on the windshield
Sure  see it
But a good guy don't pay no attention to what some heel makes him stick on his truck
After a moment of hesitation the driver releases the brake
Scrunch down on the running board till we get around the bend
As Tom scrunches down on the running board the driver throws the truck into gear and it moves
The scene dissolves to the
It is day, and Tom is seated beside the driver, who is surreptitiously eyeing him, trying to confirm some suspicion--an inspection which Tom ignores at first
Goin' far
(shaking his head) Just a few miles
'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out
Lookin' for a job
No, my old man got a place, forty acres
He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time
(after a curious glance) Oh
Cautiously, the driver's eyes drop to Tom's feet
We see '
They are prison shoes--new, stiff and bulky
Curiosity is in the eyes of the  as they shoot a swift glance at Tom
is looking straight ahead, with the dead- pan look that prisoners get when they are trying to conceal something
The ' eyes take in Tom's hands and the stiff coat
Been doin' a job
Yeah
seen your hands
You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands
notice little things like that all the time
(After a pause) Got a trade
(evenly) Why don't you get to it, buddy
(uneasily) Get to what
You know what  mean
You been givin' me a goin' over ever since  got in
Whyn't you go on and ask me where been
don't stick my nose in nobody's business
Naw--not much
(a little frightened) stay in my own yard
(without emotion) Listen
That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch
But  ain't keepin' it a secret
been in the penitentiary
Been there four years
Like to know anything else
You ain't got to get sore
(coldly) Go ahead
Ask me anything you want
didn't mean nothing
Me neither
'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all
(After a pause) See that road up ahead
Yeah
That's where  get off
With a sigh of relief the driver puts his foot on the brake
The  stops and Tom gets out
He look at the uneasy driver contemptuously
You're about to bust to know what done, ain't you
Well,  ain't a guy to let you down
(Confidentially) Homicide
The driver throws the truck into gear
He doesn't like this at all
never asked you
(as the truck moves away) Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if hadn't tol' you
He looks indifferently after the truck and then starts on foot down the dirt crossroad
wind has begun to blow
The scene dissolves to the roadside under a   in daylight
The wind is still blowing
Sitting on the ground, his back against the tree, Casy, a long, lean man in overalls, blue shirt, and one sneaker, is fixing something on the other dirty sneaker
To the tune of "Yes, Sir, That's My Baby" he is absent-mindedly singing
Mmmmm he's my saviour
Mmmmm my saviour, Mmmmmmmmmm my saviour now
(Looking up as Tom comes down the road) Howdy, friend
Carrying his coat under his arm,  wipes his face with his cap as he cuts off the road to acknowledge the greeting
Howdy
He stops, grateful for the momentary relief of the shade
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy
(surprised) Yeah
On my way home now
Well,  do declare
(Grinning) baptized you, son
(staring) Why, you're the preacher
*Used* to be
Not no more
lost the call
(Reminiscently) But boy,  sure *used* to have it
'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners pretty near *drowned* half of 'em
(Sighing) But not no more
lost the sperit
(with a grin) Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher
got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all
ain't so sure o' things
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife
(shakes his head sadly) At my meetin's  used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out
Then, 'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em
'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good
Next time, do it again
figgered there just wasn't no hope for me
never let one go by me when  could catch her
But you wasn't a preacher
girl was just a girl to you
But to me they was holy vessels
was savin' their souls
(Fervently) ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit
Maybe *that's* love
Why,  love everybody so much 'm fit to bust sometimes
So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue
There's just what people do
Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice
But that's as far as any man's got a right to say
(after a moment, figuring there is no percentage in continuing this philosophical discussion, pulls out a flask, which he extends) Have a little snort
(holding the flask) Course 'll say grace if somebody sets out the food-- (shaking his head) --but my heart ain't in it
(He takes a long pull) Nice drinkin' liquor
Ought to be
That's fact'ry liquor
Cost me a buck
(handing back the flask) Been out travelin' around
Didn't you hear
It was in the papers
No,  never
What
been in the penitentiary for four years
(He drinks) Excuse me for asking
don't mind any more
'd do what done again
killed a guy at a dance
We was drunk
He got a knife in me and  laid him out with a shovel
Knocked his head plumb to squash
And you ain't ashamed
(shaking his head) He had a knife in me
That's why they only gave me seven years
Got out in four--parole
Ain't you seen your folks since then
(putting on his coat) No, but  aim to before sundown
Gettin' kind of excited about it, too
Which way you going
(putting on his sneaker) It don't matter
Ever since  lost the sperit it looks like  just as soon go one way as the other
(Rising) 'll go your way
They pause at the edge of the shade, squint up at the sky, and then move off
The scene dissolves to the      by daylight
Leaves are scuttling across it
The top soil begins to fly up
It is not a hard wind as yet, but it is steady and persistent
Tom's and Casy's feet walk into sight
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas
'll be glad to see you pa
Last time  seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit  ever seen
He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time
Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush
Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two
They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that
(worriedly) Lissen
This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'
Shore it is
It always is, this time a year
Tom, holding his cap on his head with his hand, looks up
The     are bending before the wind continue walking
Is it fur
(still looking back) Just around that next bend
are almost being blown along and dust is rising from the road
(lifting his voice above the wind) Your granma was a great one, too
The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist
(pointing ahead) That's our place
The   is an ancient, bleak, sway-backed building
There is neither sign of life or habitation about it
(looking back) And it ain't any too close, either
We better run
, like a black wall, rises into the sky, moving forward
are running, but looking back over their shoulders as the   nears
Dust rises from the ground to join and thicken the black wall
are seen racing down the road to the cabin, the wind whipping up the dust
The two men smack open the door and slam it shut after them
The screen begins to grow dark as the storm sweeps over the land
It becomes black
In  , it is black too, but the sound is different
In addition to the sound of the wind there is the soft hissing of sand against the house
' Ma
Pa
Ain't nobody here
(After a long silence) Somepin's happened
' You got a match
' There was some pieces of candle always on a shelf
Presently, after shuffling about, he has found them and lights one
He holds it up, lighting the room
couple of wooden boxes are on the floor, a few miserable discarded things, and that's all
Tom's eyes are bewildered
They're all gone--or dead
They never wrote you nothing
No
They wasn't people to write
From the floor he picks up a woman's high button shoe, curled up at the toe and broken over the instep
This was Ma's
Had 'em for years
Dropping the shoe, he picks up a battered felt hat
This used to be mine
give it to Grampa when  went away
(To Casy) You reckon they could be dead
never heard nothin' about it
Dropping the hat, he moves with the candle toward the door to the back, the only other room of the cabin
He stands in the doorway, holding the candle high
In the   the scene moves from Tom at the door across the room to the shadows, where a skinny little man sits motionless, wide-eyed, staring at Tom
His name is Muley
Tommy
(entering) Muley
Where's my folks, Muley
(dully) They gone
(irritated) know that
But *where* they gone
Muley does not reply
He is looking up at Casy as he enters
(to Casy) This is Muley Graves
(To Muley) You remember the preacher, don't you
ain't no preacher anymore
(impatiently) All right, you remember the *man* then
Glad to see you again
Glad to see you
(angrily) Now where is my folks
Gone-- (hastily) --over to your Uncle John's
The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago
But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off
(bewildered) But what's happened
How come they got to get off
We been here fifty years--same place
Ever'body got to get off
Ever'body leavin', goin' to California
My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks
(After a pause) Ever'body but me
ain't gettin' off
But who done it
Listen
(Impatiently Tom listens to the storm) That's some of what done it--the dusters
Started it, anyway
Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now
(angrily) Are you crazy
(simply) Some say  am
(After a pause) You want to hear what happened
That's what  asked you, ain't it
is seen at close range
Not actually crazy, Muley is a little touched
His eyes rove upward as he listens to the sound of the storm, the sough of the wind and the soft hiss of the sand
Then
The way it happens--the way it happened to me--the man come one day
The scene dissolves to '
It is a soft spring day, with the peaceful sounds of the country
Seated in a three-year-old touring car is  , a city man with a collar and tie
He hates to do what he is doing and this makes him gruff and curt, to hide his misgivings
Squatted beside the car are Muley, his son-in-law, and a half-grown son
At a respectful distance stand Muley's wife, his daughter, with a baby in her arms, and a small barefooted girl, watching worriedly
The men soberly trace marks on the ground with small sticks
hound dog sniffs at the automobile wheels
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more
It don't even break even, much less show a profit
One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places
You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now
(Looking around) The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way
(irritably) can't help that
All  know is got my orders
They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what 'm telling you
Muley stands in anger
The two younger men pattern after him
You mean get off my own land
Now don't go blaming me
It ain't *my* fault
Whose fault is it
You know who owns the land--the Shawnee Land and Cattle Company
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny
It ain't nobody
It's a company
They got a pres'dent, ain't they
They got somebody that knows what a shotgun's for, ain't they
But it ain't *his* fault, because the *bank* tells him what to do
(angrily) All right
Where's the bank
(fretfully) Tulsa
But what's the use of picking on him
He ain't anything but the manager, and half crazy hisself, trying to keep up with his orders from the east
(bewildered) Then who *do* we shoot
(stepping on the starter) Brother,  don't know
If  did 'd tell you
But  just don't know *who's* to blame
(angrily) Well, 'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land
Grampa took up this land seventy years ago
My pa was born here
We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it
And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it
So just come on and try to push me off
The scene dissolves to the
The sound of the storm is heard again as Tom and Casy watch Muley
(angrily) Well
(without emotion) They come
They come and pushed me off
We see  at close range
They come with the cats
' The what
The cats--the caterpillar tractors
The scene dissolves to a   : tractors looming over hillocks, flattening fences, through gullies, their drivers looking like robots, with goggles, dust masks over mouth and nose--one after the other, crossing and recrossing as if to convey the impression that this was an invasion of machine-men from some other world
' And for ever' one of 'em ten-fifteen families gets throwed outa their homes--one hundred folks with no place to live but on the road
The Rances, the Perrys, the Peterses, the Joadses--one after another they got throwed out
Half the folks you and me know--throwed right out into the road
The one that got me come a month ago
The scene dissolves to '
We see the backs of Muley and the two younger men standing shoulder to shoulder watching a lumbering tractor headed straight toward them
It is at some distance
Muley holds a shotgun
His son has a baling hook
The son-in-law has a two-by-four
Behind them is their cabin
Frightened and huddled together are the women and children
The roar of the tractor comes closer
(shouting) You come any closer and 'm gonna blow you right outa that cat
(He lifts his shotgun) The  continues to lumber along, its driver goggled and black of face where his dust mask doesn't cover lifts his shotgun to his shoulder, and aims
*tol'* you
The  stops
The driver takes off his goggles and dust mask
Like the others he's a country boy
His face is sullen
Muley is lowering his shotgun
There is a surprise in his face as he recognizes the driver
Why, you're Joe Davis's boy
He moves forward, followed by his son and son-in-law in the Davis is wiping his face as they walk toward him
don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people
For three dollars a day, that's what 'm doin' it for
got two little kids
got a wife and my wife's mother
Them people got to eat
Fust and on'y thing  got to think about is my own folks
What happens to other folks is their lookout
But this is *my land*, son
Don't you understand
(putting his goggles back on) *Used* to be your land
'longs to the comp'ny now
We see
small girl pulls her mother's dress
What's he fixin' to do, ma
Hush
Back to the    : (grimly) Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat 'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come
(contemptuously) You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere
First place, you'd get hung and you know it
For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place
And the tractor roars into slow motion again
We see the
The womenfolks scamper out of the way as the tractor heads for a corner of the house
It goes over a ramshackle fence and then a feeble little flower bed
Muley and the two younger men walk along
Breathing hard, frightened and desperate, Muley is shouting warnings at Davis, but the roar of the tractor drowns his voice
The dog barks excitedly, snarling at the tractor stand watching, terrified but dead pan, until a cry bursts from Muley's wife
Don't
Please don't
The little girl begins to whimper
'm tellin' you
The  moves across the yard, nosing a chair out of the way, and with a rending of boards hits a corner of the house, knocking a part of the foundation away
The corner of the house sinks
lifts his shotgun, aims it, holds it, and then slowly lowers it
As he stands looking at what has happened his shoulders sag
He seems almost to shrink
The scene dissolves to , once more in the back room of Tom's old home, as the sound of the storm continues
(dully) What was the use
He was right
There wasn't a thing in the world  could do about it
(bewildered) But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that
The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but  couldn't leave
Somepin' wouldn't let me
So now  just wander around
Sleep wherever  am
used to tell myself  was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right
But knowed that wan't true
There ain't nothin' to look out for
And ain't nobody comin' back
They're gone-- and me, 'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world  am
Tom rises in his agitation and bewilderment
You think 'm touched
(sympathetically) No
You're lonely--but you ain't touched
It don't matter
If 'm touched, 'm touched, and that's all there is to it
(still unable to grasp it all) What  can't understand is my folks takin' it
Like ma
seen her nearly beat a peddler to death with a live chicken
She aimed to go for him with an ax she had in the other hand but she got mixed up and forgot which hand was which and when she got through with that peddler all she had left was two chicken legs
He looks down at Muley
Just a plain 'ol graveyard ghost, that's all
His eyes are dull on the floor
The sound of the dust storm continues strongly
The scene dissolves to the     at night
It is several hours later and the sound of the storm has faded out
Now all is silence as first Tom, then Casy, and finally Muley steps out of the cabin and looks around
There is still a slight fog of dust in the air, and clouds of powderlike dust shoot up around their feet
All three men have wet rags tied over their mouths and noses
She's settlin'
What you figger to do
It's hard to say
Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's,  reckon
After that  don't know
(grabbing Tom) Listen
(Faint sound of motor) That's them
Them lights
Come on, we got to hide out
(angrily) Hide out for what
We ain't doin' nothin'
(terrified) You're *trespassin'*
It ain't you lan' no more
An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun
Come on, Tom
You're on parole
approaches at some distance, the headlights moving up and down as the car rides a dirt road
: Muley leads the way
All you got to do is lay down an' watch
(as they lie down) Won't they come out here
(snickering) don't think so
One come out here once an'  clipped him from behin' with a fence stake
They ain't bothered since
: The car stops
strong searchlight flashes on and goes over the cabin
(in car) Muley
(After a pause) He ain't here
The car moves on
,    lie flat, listening to the sound of the car going away
Anybody ever 'tol me 'd be hidin' out on my own place
He whistles, as the scene fades out
, seen by daylight, fade in
The cornstalks, their roots blown clean and clear of the earth, lie fallen in one direction
This is what has happened to farms that were once rich and green
Then Uncle John's cabin comes into view
It is just after sunup
The air is filled with country sounds--a shrill chorus of birds, a dog barking in the distance
The cabin is of the same general appearance as the Joad cabin but even smaller
Smoke curls from the chimney
We see a    , inside the cabin
The platter is filled with sidemeat
Over the scene comes Ma Joad's voice
' Lord, make us thankful for what we are about to receive, for His sake
Amen
As she speaks, a man's scrawny hand reaches forward and sneaks out a piece of sidemeat
Five people are seated around the breakfast table on chairs or boxes
They are Pa, Grampa, Granma, Noah, and Uncle John
Two children, Ruthie and Winfield, stand to the table, because there are no more chairs
Their heads are all bent as Ma, standing with a fork in her hand between the table and the stove, ends the grace
Heads lift and there is a bustle as Ma turns back to the frying pork on the stove and the others truck into their food
Granma points a spiteful finger at Grampa
seen you
--You et durin' grace
(indignantly) One little ole dab
--one teeny little ole dab
, though they are shoveling it in, are grinning at Grampa
(in a snickering whisper to Winfield) Ain't he messy though
(viciously) seen him
--gobblin' away like an ole pig
Whyn't you keep your eyes shet durin' grace, you ole
is solemnly studying a handbill
Over his shoulder the can be read: "800  --  " We see
(who is a half-wit) What's it say again
Says plenty work in California-- peaches
Eight hundred pickers needed
Noah frowns at the print
(who has mush on his mouth) Wait'll  get to California
Gonna reach up and pick me an orange whenever  want it
Or grapes
That there's somethin'  ain't *never* had enough of
Gonna get me a whole bunch a grapes off a bush and 'm gonna squash 'em all over my face and just let the juice dreen down offen my chin
(in a feeble bleat) Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory
(expanding) Maybe  get me a whole *washtub* fulla them grapes and jest sit in 'em and scrooge around till they was gone
(Sighing) shore would like to do that
are snickering
Ruthie has smeared her face with mush
She pulls Winfield around to see
(whispering) Look
'm Grampa
She begins to slobber in mimicry
Winfield snickers
At that instant Ma enters, unobserved, and without a word give Ruthie a fine wallop
Nobody else pays any attention to the slap as Ma, a bucket in her hand, moves on toward the door
We see her now in the , first at the door, then moving toward the well
She stops dead still, her eyes gazing outward
is looking at the household goods piled around the yard, to be taken to California
Casy is in the background
Then Tom looks up and see Ma (out of the scene)
His face softens
He moves toward her
(softly--her eyes closed) Thank God
Oh thank God
(In sudden terror as he approaches) Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya
You ain't got to hide, have you
No, Ma
'm paroled
got my papers
With a sigh and a smile, and her eyes full of wonder, she feels his arm
Her fingers touch his cheek, as if she were blind
Swelling with emotion, Tom bites his lip to control himself
was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again
'd a found you, Ma
, with great politeness, turns his back to the scene and keeps well away from it
now looks around at the dusty furniture piled around the yard
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma
Are we goin' to California true
We *got* to, Tommy
But that's gonna be awright
seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too
But  gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy
(Breathlessly) Did they hurt you, son
Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad
(puzzled) Mad, Ma
Sometimes they do
(gently) No, Ma  was at first--but not no more
(not yet quite convinced) Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy
They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad
Did they hurt you like that, Tommy
(grinning) No, Ma
You don't have to worry about that
Thank God
-- don't want no mean son (She loves him with her eyes) At the , Pa is staring toward them, his mouth open
(almost to himself) It's Tommy
(Then shouting inside) It's Tommy back
(Heading for Tom) What'd you do, son--bust out
' , all but Granma are staring toward the door
Then all but Granma scramble to their feet, headed for the door
(in an excited chant) Tom's outa ja-ul
Tom's outa ja-ul
knowed it
Couldn't keep him in
Can't keep a Joad in
knowed it from the fust
The children and Grampa scramble out first, followed hurriedly but less rowdily by Uncle John and Noah
Granma, aware only that there is some excitement, looks interestedly after them but decides against any activity
(vaguely) Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory
(she resumes eating) In the , the prodigal son, mother and father proudly beside him, is having his hand wrung by Grampa, who vainly tries to button various buttons of his shirt, as always
The two children jump up and down excitedly but are too shy to force themselves into the reception
(to Pa) You know what  al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence
" Can't keep no Joad in jail
(grinning) didn't bust out
They lemme out
Howya, Noah
Howya, Uncle John
Fine, Tommy
Glad to see you
(to anybody) was the same way myself
Put me in jail and 'd bust right out
Couldn't hold me
As Tom chucks the two children under the chin, the rattling roar of a jalopy causes all to turn to look
(confidentially) Bust out
(shaking his head) Parole
The roar increases
home-built  comes around the corner of the house
Once a Hudson sedan, the top has been cut in two and a truck body constructed
It is driven now by Al, and on the front seat with him are Rosasharn and Connie
The arrival, as the truck moves into the yard, increases the excitement, and the scene is a little incoherent with the talking and shouting and the noise of the jalopy
Hi, Tom
Howya doin'
(surprised and pleased) Rosasharn
Hi, Rosasharn
Howya, Al
(wildly) The jailbird's back
The jailbird's back
Hi, Ma
Hi, Connie
Hiya, Grampa
(to Tom) That's Connie Rivers with her
They're married now
(Confidentially) She's due about three-four months
(marveling) Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when went up
(eagerly as he jumps down) You bust outa jail, Tom
(patiently) Naw
They paroled me
(let down) Oh
Heh'o Tom
(Proudly) This is Connie, my husband
(shaking hands) If this don't beat all
(Chuckling) Well,  see you been busy already
(gasping) You do not see either
--not yet
At the whoop of laughter that goes up from all, she turns in a fine simulation of maidenly mortification, and throws herself into Connie's arms, hiding her face against his chest
After a moment of surprise, a slow, happy, fatuous grin begins to broaden his face
He beams, whereupon their delight increases, the men roaring and jeering and slapping their legs, the women making modest efforts to suppress their amusement
Lookut his face
'see his face
Lookut Rosasharn
'ever see anything like her face when Tom said it
Look around, Rosasharn
Let's see it again
An automobile horn sounds sharply
Their laughter halted as though cut by a knife, they look off
has stopped in the road by the house, the engine still running
One man drives, the other talks
Hey, Joad
John Joad
In the  the people are silent, their faces without expression, as all gaze toward the touring car
Ain't forgot, have you
We ain't forgot
Comin' through here tomorrow, you know
know
We be out
We be out by sunup
The touring car's engine is still heard after the men drive off
The Joads watch the car, their heads turning, their eyes following, expressionless
The scene dissolves to the  just before dawn
Now and then a rooster crows
couple of lanterns light the scene as the man load the truck
It is nearly done, the body piled high but flat with boxes, and more tied on running boards
Al has the hood open and is working on the motor
Noah, Casy, Uncle John, Connie, Pa, and Tom are at various tasks
They talk as they work
(to Pa) How you get all this money
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa
Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'
Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on
figger we oughta be able to make it on that
(dryly) Easy
After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they
(proudly closing the hood) She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight
How about it, John
How you boys comin'
(He casts a critical eye over the truck) , Ma sits on a box in front of the stove
The fire door is open and the light shines out
The room itself has been pretty well stripped, with only trash and discarded things left
In Ma's lap is a pasteboard shoebox and she is going through the meager treasures stored in it, to see what must go and what she can take with her
Her eyes are soft and thoughtful as each item brings a memory, but not sad
Occasionally she smiles faintly
She pulls out a letter, looks at it, starts to throw it into the fire, then puts it back in the box
Her hand pulls out a We see it in Ma's hand
It is a picture of the Statue Of Liberty
Over it: "Greetings from New York City
" She turns it over
It is addressed: "Mrs
Joad  254 Oklahomy Territory
" In the space for a message: "Hello honey
Willy Mae
" , after a moment of studying it, throws the card into the fire
She lifts the letter again, puts it back
She pulls out a worn
We see it in Ma's hand
The headline is: "
" drops the clipping into the fire
Rummaging around, she pulls out a small
We see it closely as before
On it is printed: "Souvenir of Louisiana Purchase Exposition-- St
Louis--1904
" studies the dog, smiling, remembering something that it meant in her life
Then she puts in in a pocket in her dress
Next she pulls out some pieces of cheap jewelry; one cuff link, a baby's signet ring, two earrings
She smiles at the ring, then pockets it
The cuff link too
The earrings she holds for a moment longer, then looks around to make sure nobody sees, then holds them to her ears, not looking into any kind of a mirror, just feeling them against the lobes of her ears, as once perhaps she wore them
Her eyes are grave
(from the door) How about it, Ma
'm ready
Tom disappears
Ma looks at the earrings, and then at the contents of the box
She lifts out the letter again and looks at it
Then, without drama, she drops it into the fire
She watches it burn
Her eyes are still on the flame as she calls
Rosasharn honey
Wake up the chillun
We're fixin' to leave
The flame dies down
In the  it is grey dawn
There is a thrill of quiet excitement as they all stand around the loaded truck, hats on, putting on coats
The ones missing are Ma, Rosasharn, the children, and Grampa
Pa is in charge
(as Ma comes out of the cabin) Where's Grampa
Al, go git him
(trying to climb in the front seat) 'm gonna sit up front
Somebody he'p me
Tom easily lifts her up the step
The two children come running out of the house, chanting
Goin' to California
Goin' to California
You kids climb up first, on top
(all obey as he directs) Al's gonna drive, Ma
You sit up there with him and Granma and we'll swap around later
ain't gonna sit with Grampa
Connie, you he'p Rosasharn up there alongside Ruthie and Winfiel'
(Looking around) Where's Grampa
(with a cackle) Where he al'ays is, prob'ly
Well, leave him a place, but Noah, you and John, y'all kinda find yourself a place--kinda keep it even all around
All have obeyed and are aboard but Pa, Tom, and Casy, who is watching the springs flatten out
Think she'll hold
If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture
' Lemmo go, gol dang it
Lemmo go, tell you
All turn
In a     Al is pulling Grampa gently but firmly, the old man holding back, and furious
He flails feebly at Al, who holds his head out of the way without effort
He wasn't sleepin'
He was settin' out back a the barn
They's somepin' wrong with him
Ef you don't let me go-- Al permits Grampa to jerk loose and sit down on the doorstep
The old man is miserable and frightened and angry, too old to understand or accept such a violent change in his life
Tom and Pa come up to him
The others watch solemnly from their places in the truck
What's the matter, Grampa
(dully, sullenly) Ain't nothin' the matter
just ain't a-goin', that's all
What you mean you ain't goin'
We *got* to go
We got no place to stay
ain't talkin' about you, 'm talkin' about me
And 'm a-stayin'
give her a good goin' over all night long-- and 'm a-stayin'
But you can't *do* that, Grampa
This here land is goin' under the tractor
We *all* got to git out
All but me
'm a-stayin'
How 'bout Granma
(fiercely) Take her with you
(getting out of the truck) But who'd cook for you
How'd you live
Muley's livin', ain't he
And 'm *twicet* the man Muley is
(on his knee) Now listen, Grampa
Listen to me, just a minute
(grimly) And  ain't gonna listen either tol' you what 'm gonna do
(Angrily) And  don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even,  ain't a- goin' to California
(Picking up some dirt) This here's my country
b'long *here*
(Looking at the dirt) It ain't no good-- (after a pause) --but it's mine
(after a silence) Ma
Pa
(They move toward the cabin with him) Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt
(loudly) And can't nobody *make* me go, either
Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me
'm a-stayin'
All watch him worriedly
: Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin
He can't stay here
Can't tie him
Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self
(After thought) Reckon we could git him *drunk*
Ain't no whisky, is they
Wait
There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here
(In the trash in the corner) It put the chillun to sleep
(tasting it) Don't taste bad
(looking in the pot) And they's some coffee here
could fix him a cup
That's right
And douse some in it
(watching) Better give him a good 'un
He's awful bull-headed
Ma is already pouring coffee into a can as  is seen
(mumbling defiantly) If Muley can scrabble along,  can do it too
(Suddenly sniffing) smell spareribs
Somebody been eatin' spareribs
How come  ain't got some
(from the door) Got some saved for you, Grampa
Got 'em warmin' now
Here's a cuppa coffee
(taking the cup) Awright, but get me some a them spareribs, too
Get me a whole mess of 'em
'm hongry
He drinks the coffee
Pa and Tom watch him
He notices nothing
He takes another dram of the coffee
(amiably) shore do like spareribs
He drinks again
The scene dissolves to the
It is just after dawn
Pa, Tom, and Noah are lifting Grampa into the truck
He mumbles angrily, but is unconscious of what is happening
(fretfully) Easy, *easy
* You wanta bust his head wide open
Pull his arms, John
(mumbling) Ain't a-goin', thas all
Put somepin' over him, so he won't git sun-struck
(Looking around) Ever'body set now
( chorus of responses) Awright, Al, letta go
The engine rattles and roars shakily
Grinning with excitement, Pa sits down and pats Grampa clumsily
You be awright, Grampa
The truck starts to move heavily
Casy stands watching it
Good-by, an' good luck
Hey, wait
Hold 'er, Al
(The car stops) Ain't you goin' with us
(after a pause) 'd like to
There's somethin' happenin' out there in the wes' an' 'd like to try to learn what it is
If you feel you got the room
He stops politely
Pa looks from one face to the other in the truck--a swift, silent canvass--and though no one speaks or gives any other sign, Pa knows that the vote is yes
(heartily) Come on, get on, plenty room
Sure, come on, Casy, plenty room
Quickly he climbs aboard
The truck rattles into motion again
(excitedly) Here we go
(grinning) California, here we come
As they all look back the deserted  is seen from the departing truck
Now we see the    , as it snorts and rattles toward the road--a study of facial expressions as the Joad family look back for the last time at their home
Connie and Rosasharn, whispering, giggling, and slappings, are oblivious of the event
Ruthie and Winfield are trembling with excitement
But Tom's and Pa's smiles have disappeared, and all the men are gazing back thoughtfully and soberly, their minds occupied with the solemnity of this great adventure
In the
Al is driving
Granma is already dozing
Ma looks steadily ahead
(grinning) Ain't you gonna look back, Ma
--give the ol' place a last look
(coldly shaking her head) We're goin' to California, ain't we
Awright then, let's *go* to California
(sobering) That don't sound like you, Ma
You never was like that before
never had my house pushed over before
never had my fambly stuck out on the road
never had to lose
ever'thing  had in life
She continues to stare straight ahead
The  is lumbering up onto a paved highway
The scene dissolves to a : Almost filling the screen is the shield marker of the
Highway 66
Superimposed on it is a montage of jalopies, steaming and rattling and piled high with goods and people, as they pull onto the highway, to indicate as much as possible that this departure of the Joad family is but part of a mass movement of jalopies and families
The signs of towns on
Highway 66 flash past-- ,  ,
This dissolves to a
It is late afternoon
The Joad truck pulls of the paved highway and stops
The men leap down quickly from the truck, all but Pa, who lifts Grampa in his arms and then lowers him slowly, gently into Tom's arms
In ' arms Grampa is whimpering feebly
*Ain't* a-goin'
ain't a-goin'
' all right, Grampa
You just kind a tar'd, that's all
Somebody fix a pallet
With a quilt pulled from the truck Ma runs ahead as Tom carries Grampa toward a clump of woods back off the highway
The others get down soberly from the truck, all but Granma, who is dozing
Cars pass-a fast car passing a jalopy
Tom is letting the old man down gently as Ma adjusts the quilt on the ground
Death is in Grampa's eyes as he looks up dimly at them
(a whisper) Thas it, jus' tar'd thas all
jus' tar'd
(He closes his eyes) The scene dissolves to an insert of a
It is written awkwardly in pencil on the flyleaf of a Bible
Tom's voice recites the words
' This here is William James Joad, dyed of a stroke, old old man
His folkes bured him becaws they got no money to pay for funerls
Nobody kilt him
Jus a stroke an he dyed
, at night
In the clump of woods, lighted by two lanterns, The Joad tribe stands reverently around an open grave
Having read the note, Tom puts it in a small fruit jar and kneels down and, reaching into the grave, places it on Grampa's body
figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt
(Reaching into the grave) Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground
(straightening up) Casy, won't you say a few words
ain't no more a preacher, you know
We know
But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words
(after a pause) 'll say 'em--an' make it short
(All bow and close eyes) This here ol' man jus' lived a life an' jus' died out of it
don't know whether he was good or bad, an' it don't matter much
Heard a fella say a poem once, an' he says, "All that lives is holy
" But  wouldn't pray for jus' a ol' man that's dead, because he's awright
If  was to pray 'd pray for the folks that's alive an' don't know which way to turn
Grampa here, he ain't got no more trouble like that
He's got his job all cut out for 'im--so cover 'im up and let 'im get to it
Amen
The scene fades out
66, in daylight, fades in: an Oklahoma stretch, revealing a number of jalopies rattling westward
The Joad truck approaches
In the      Tom is now driving
Granma is dozing again, and Ma is looking thoughtfully ahead
Tommy
What is it, Ma
Wasn't that the state line we just passed
(after a pause) Yes'm, that was it
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled
Says they'll send you up again
Forget it, Ma
got her figgered out
Long as  keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing
All gotta do is keep my nose clean
(worriedly) Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about
Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes
(laughing) Forget it, Ma
Jus' think about the nice things out there
Think about them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body got work-- (waking suddenly) gotta git out
First gas station, Granma-- gotta git *out*,  tell ya
gotta git *out*
(foot on brakes) Awright
Awright
As the truck slows to a stop a motorcycle cop approaches after them
Looking back, Tom sees him bearing toward them
He looks grimly at Ma
They shore don't waste no time
(As Granma whines) Take her out
(astraddle his motorcycle) Save your strength, lady
(to Tom) Get goin', buddy
No campin' here
(relieved) We ain't campin'
We jus' stoppin' a minute-- Lissen,  heard that before-- tell ya  gotta git out
The cop looks startled, puzzled, but Tom shrugs a disclaimer for responsibility in that quarter
(mildly) She's kinda ol'-- (whimpering) tell ya-- Okay, okay
(triumphantly) Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory
As Ma helps Granma out the other side, Tom and the cop exchange a glance and snother shrug at the foibles of women and then look studiedly into space
The scene dissolves to a : superimposed on the marker of
Highway 66 an assortment of roadside signs flashes by: Bar--, Joe's Eats, Dr
Pepper, Gas, Coca Cola, This Highway is Patrolled, End of 25 Mile Zone, Lucky Strikes, Used Cars, Nutburger, Motel, Drive-Inn, Free Water, We Fix Flats, etc
-  reads: " 50
" It is night
We hear the sound of guitar music
In the   a small wooden house dominates the scene
There are no facilities; the migrants simply pitch makeshift tents and park their jalopies wherever there is a space
It is after supper and a dozen or more men sit on the steps of the house listening to Connie play a road song on a borrowed guitar
The music softens the tired, drawn faces of the men and drives away some of their shyness
In the dark, outside the circle of light from the gasoline lantern on the porch, some of the women and children sit and enjoy the luxury of this relative gaiety
The proprietor sits tipped back in a straight chair on the porch
We see the
Behind their truck, a tarpaulin is stretched over a rope from tree to tree
Granma lies asleep on a quilt, stirring fitfully
Ma sits on the ground at her head, fanning her with a piece of cardboard
Rosasharn lies flat on her back, hands clasped under her head, looking up at the stars
The music comes to them pleasantly
Ma
all this, will it hurt the baby
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy
Sometimes 'm all jumpy inside
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow
But will it--hurt the baby
They use' to be a sayin':  chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile
An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy
That's the way always heard it
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma
(thoughtfully) Sometimes
little
Only it ain't scairt so much
It's just waitin' an' wonderin'
But when sump'n happens that  got to do sump'n-- (simply) --'ll do it
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think
(quickly) No
No, it don't
can't do that can't let m'self
All  can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again
They'd all get upset if done anymore 'n that
They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that
(After a pause) That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together
As the music ends we see a
The men murmur approbation of Connie's playing
(with quiet pride) Thas my son-in-law
Sings real nice
What state y'all from
Oklahoma
Had us a farm there, share- croppin'
Till the tractors druv us out
We from Arkansas
had me a store there, kind of general notions store, but when the farms went the store went too
(Sighing) Nice a little as you ever saw shore did hate to give it up
(profoundly) Wal, y'cain't tell
figure when we git out there an' git work an' maybe git us a piece a growin' lan' near water it might not be so bad at that
Thas right
Payin' good wages, hear
Ever'body got work out there
Can't be no worse
As they talk, a  , standing on the edge of the group, begins to grin bitterly
He is much more ragged than the others
You folks must have a pot a money
The  turns to look at the Man
(with dignity) No, we ain't got no money
But they's plenty of us to work, an' we 're all good men
Get good wages out there an' put it all together an' we'll be awright
The Man begins to snigger and then to laugh in a high whinneying giggle which turns into a fit of coughing
All of the men are watching him
Good wages, eh
Pickin' oranges an' peaches
(quietly) We gonna take whatever they got
What's so funny about it
(sniggering again) What's so funny about it
just *been* out there
been an' *seen* it
An' 'm goin' *back* to starve-- because  ruther starve all over at once
(angrily) Whatta you think you're talkin' about
got a han'bill here says good wages, an'  seen it in the papers they need pickers
Awright, go on
Ain't nobody stoppin' ya
(pulling out handbill) But what about this
ain't gonna fret you
Go on
Wait a minute, buddy
You jus' done some jackassin'
You ain't gonna shut up now
The han'bill says they need men
You laugh an' say they don't
Now which one's a liar
(after a pause) How many you'all got them han'bills
Come on, how many
At least three-quarters of the men worriedly reach into their pockets and draw out worn and folded handbills
But what does *that* prove
Look at 'em
Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted
Awright, this man wants 800 men
So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em
An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill
Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs
Does that make sense
There is a long worried silence
The proprietor leans forward angrily
What are you, a troublemaker
You sure you ain't one a them labor fakes
swear  ain't, mister
Well, don't you go roun' here tryin' to stir up trouble
(drawing himself up) tried to tell you folks sump'n it took me a year to fin' out
Took two kids dead, took my wife dead, to show me
But nobody couldn't tell me neither
can't tell ya about them little fellas layin' in the tent with their bellies puffed out an' jus' skin on their bones, an' shiverin' an' whinin' like pups, an' me runnin' aroun' tryin' to get work-- (shouting) --not for money, not for wages--jus' for a cup a flour an' a spoon a lard
An' then the coroner came
"Them children died a heart-failure," he says, an' put it in his paper
(With wild bitterness) Heart-failure
--an' their little bellies stuck out like a pig-bladder
He looks around at the men, trying to control his emotions, and then he walks away into the darkness
There is an uneasy silence
Well--gettin' late
Got to get to sleep
They all rise as at a signal, all moved and worried by the Second Man's outburst
,    move away, worry on their faces
'pose he's tellin' the truth--that fella
He's tellin' the truth awright
The truth for him
He wasn't makin' nothin' up
How about us
Is that the truth for us
don't know
(worriedly) How can you tell
The scene dissolves to a : superimposed on the shield marker of
Highway 66 and the rattling Joad truck the signs of towns flash by: , ,
The  is seen on the
It is now mountain country-- New Mexico
Then it is seen at a
It is a cheap two-pump station, hand-painted, dreary, dusty
Huddled next to it is a hamburger stand
In front of the hamburger stand is a truck labeled:
The Joads are piling out of their truck
Directed by Ma, Noah lifts Granma out
The two children scamper around shrieking because their legs have gone to sleep
Al is preparing to put water in the radiator
Pa takes out a deep leather pouch, unties the strings, and begins calculating his money as the fat proprietor advances
(truculently) You folks aim to buy anything
Need some gas, mister
Got any money
Whatta you think:--we's beggin'
just ast, that's all
(evenly) Well, ask right
You ain't talkin' to bums, you know
(appealing to heaven) All in the worl'  done was ast
, a standard cheap eatery, Bert is doing the short orders and Mae is handling the counter nickel phonograph is playing a tune
Bill, a truck driver, sits at the counter; his partner, Fred, is playing a slot machine
Kinda pie y'got
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple
Cut me off a hunk a that banana cream, and a cuppa java
Make it two
Two it is
(Smirking) Seen any new etchin's lately, Bill
(grinning) Well, here's one ain't bad
Little kid comes in late to school
Teacher says-- He stops
Pa is peering in the screen door
Beside him Ruthie and Winfield have their noses flattened against the screen
Mae looks at Pa
Yeah
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am
This ain't a groc'ry store
We got bread to make san'widges with
know, ma'am
on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry
Whyn't you buy a san'wich
We got nice san'widges
(embarrassed) shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it
It's all figgered out, mean--for the trip
You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime
We only got fifteen-cent loafs
(an angry whisper) Give 'em the bread
We'll run out 'fore the bread truck comes
Awright then, run out
Mae shrugs at the truck drivers, to indicate what she's up against, while Bert mashes his hamburgers savagely with the spatula
Come in
Pa and the two children come in as Mae opens a drawer and pulls out a long waxpaper-covered loaf of bread
The children have been drawn to the candy showcase and are staring in at the goodies
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth
(a clinched teeth order) Give 'im the loaf
No, sir, we wanta buy ten cents worth, thas all
(sighing) You can have this for ten cents
don't wanta rob you, ma'am
(with resignation) Go ahead--Bert says take it
Taking out his pouch, Pa digs into it, feels around with his fingers for a dime, as he apologizes
May soun' funny to be so tight, but we got a thousan' miles to go, an' we don't know if we'll make it
But when he puts the dime down on the counter he has a penny with it
He is about to drop this back in the pouch when his eyes fall on the children staring at the candy
Slowly he moves down to see what they are looking at
Then: Is them penny candy, ma'am
The children look up with a gasp, their big eyes on Mae as she moves down behind the counter
Which ones
There, them stripy ones
Mae looks from the candy to the children
They have stopped breathing, their eyes on the candy
Oh, them
Well, no--them's *two* for a penny
Well, give me two then, ma'am
He places the penny carefully on the counter and Mae holds the sticks of candy out to the children
They look up at Pa
(beaming) Sure, take 'em, take 'em
Rigid with embarrassment, they accept the candy, looking neither at it nor at each other
Pa picks up the loaf of bread and they scramble for the door
At the door Pa turns back
Thank you, ma'am
The door slams
Bill turns back from staring after them
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy
(belligerently) What's it to you
Them was nickel apiece candy
We got to get goin'
We're droppin' time
Both reach in their pockets, but when Fred sees what Bill has put down he reaches again and duplicates it
As they go out of the door
So long
Hey, wait a minute
You got change comin'
' (from outside) What's it to you
As Mae watches them through the window, her eyes warm, Bert walks around the counter to the three slot machines, a paper with figures on it in his hand
The truck roars outside and moves off
Mae looks down again at the coins
(softly) Bert
(playing a machine) What ya want
Look here
As he looks we see the
They are two half-dollars
(reverently) Truck drivers
There is a rattle of coins as Bert hits the jackpot
In his left hand on the machine is a paper with three columns of figures on it
The third column is much the longest
He scoops out the money
figgered No
3 was about ready to pay off
The scene fades out
The  , in daylight, fades in
It is in a gap in the mountains and beyond can be seen the Painted Desert border guard halts the Joad truck
He is not as tough as his words indicate, just curt and matter-of-fact
Where you going
(who is driving) California
How long you plan to be in Arizona
No longer'n we can get acrost her
Got any plants
No plants
(putting sticker on windshield) Okay
Go ahead, but you better keep movin'
Sure
We aim to
The truck rattles into movement
The scene dissolves to a  superimposed on the shield marker of
Highway 66 and the Joad truck
Signs flash by: ,  5  ,  10  ,  15 , and finally, ,
In the foreground, their backs turned, the Joads stand on and about their truck looking in a long silence at what can be seen of California from Needles
Their silence is eloquent
The faces of the Joads are blank with dismay, for this is an unattractive sight indeed
(finally) There she is, folks--the land a milk an' honey--California
(sullenly) Well, if *that's* what we come out here for
They look at each other in disappointment
(timidly, to Connie) Maybe it's nice on the other side
Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty
(rallying them) Aw, sure
This here's jus' a part of it
Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off
Course not
Come on, let's get goin'
She don't look so tough to me
The Joads and the landscape are seen again
Then the scene dissolves to the
The camp at Needles is on the bank of the Colorado River, among some willows
We see the man of the family sitting chest-deep in the shallow waters, talking, occasionally ducking their heads under, reveling in this relief
In the background are the towering mountains
Got that desert yet
Gotta take her tonight
Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out
(to Al) How's Granma since we got her in the tent
She's off her chump, seems to me
She's outa her senses, awright
All night on the truck keep talkin' like she was talkin' to Grampa
She's jus' wore out, that's all
(worriedly) shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in
(lazily, after a silence) Like to jus' stay here myself
Like to lay here forever
Never get hungry an' never get sad
Lay in the water all life long, lazy as a brood sow in the mud
(looking up at the mountains) Never seen such tough mountains
This here's a murder country, just the *bones* of a country
(Thoughtfully) Wonder if we'll ever get in a place where folks can live 'thout fightin' hard scrabble an' rock
Sometimes you get to thinkin' they *ain't* no such country
They look up as a man and his grown son stand on the bank
How's the swimmin'
Dunno
We ain't tried none
Sure feels good to set here, though
Mind if we come in an' set
She ain't our river
But we'll len' you a little piece of her
They start to shuck off their clothes
, excluding those undressing, form another scene
Goin' west
' Nope
We come from there
Goin' back home
Where's home
' Panhandle, come from near Pampa
(in surprise) Can you make a livin' there
' Nope
The man and his son sit down in the water
(continuing) But at leas' we can starve to death with folks we know
There is a long silence among the Joads as the man and his son splash water over their heads
(slowly) Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that
'd like to hear some more about that
Me an' you both
The man and his son exchange a glance, as though the Joads had touched on the deadliest of subjects
(finally) He ain't gonna tell you nothin' about it
If a fella's willin' to work hard, can't he cut her
Listen, mister
don't know ever'thing
You might go out an' fall into a steady job, an' 'd be a liar
An' then, you might never get no work, an'  didn't warn you
All can tell ya, most of the folks is purty mis'able
(Sullenly) But a fella don't know ever'thing
There is a disturbed silence as the Joads study the man, but he obviously has no intention of saying anything more
Finally Pa turns to his brother
John, you never was a fella to say much, but 'll be goldanged if you opened your mouth twicet since we lef' home
What you think about this
(scowling) don't think *nothin'* about it
We're a-goin' there, ain't we
When we get there, we'll get there
When we get a job, we'll work, an' when we don't get a job we'll set on our behin's
That's all they is to it, ain't it
(laughing) Uncle John don't talk much but when he does he shore talks sense
(He spurts water out of his mouth) The scene dissolves to a  , at night
The Joad truck, loaded with goods and people, is last gas and servicing before the desert
Two white uniformed boys handle the station
sign reads: "
" Al is filling the radiator
Tom is counting out the money for the gas
You people got a lotta nerve
What you mean
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this
You been acrost
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'
(doubtfully) Well, maybe
But 'd hate to be doin' it
Takes more nerve than  got
(laughing) It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do
(He climbs into the driver's seat) are seen lying on a mattress in the
Granma's eyes are shut
Actually she is near death
Ma keeps patting her
(softly) Don't you worry, Granma
It's gonna be awright
(mumbling) Grampa
Grampa
want Grampa
Don't you fret now
The truck moves off
We see the   again with the truck pulling away
The First Boy, a lad who knows everything, stands looking after them, shaking his head
His assistant is cleaning up the pumps
Holy Moses, what a hard-lookin' outfit
All them Okies is hard-lookin'
Boy, but 'd hate to hit that desert in a jalopy like that
(contentedly) Well, you and me got sense
Them Okies got no sense or no feeling
They ain't human
human being wouldn't live like they do
human being couldn't stand it to be so miserable
Just don't know any better,  guess
is seen hiding behind a corner of the
Peering out, he sees that the truck has gone
He turns to walk away into the darkness
The scene dissolves to a   at night, and Noah is once more seated in the shallow water, splashing, looking up at the mountains, content
The  is rattling along
Highway 66, across the desert, in the night
In the '  Tom is driving, Al and Pa are by his side
What a place
How'd you like to walk acrost her
People done it
If they could, we could
Lots must a died, too
(after a pause) Well, we ain't out a it yet
huddle together in  , eyes wide with excitement
This here's the desert an' we're right in it
(trying to see) wisht it was day
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you
(Trying to see too) seen a pitcher once
They was bones ever'place
Man bones
Some,  guess, but mos'ly cow bones
are seen again
The old woman lies still, breathing noisily
Ma continues to pat her
(whispering) ' awright, honey
Everything's gonna be awright
Then we see the  still churning along Highway 66 by night
is asleep in the truck, his face wet with sweat
are huddled together, damp and weary
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move
'm so tar'd
(sullenly) Women is always tar'd
(fearfully) You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey
(slowly) No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine
Don't pay nothin'
Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work
(pleadingly) But we can still do it, honey
(sullenly) ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this
Her eyes widen with fright as he avoids meeting her glance
lie side by side
Ma's hand is on Grandma's heart
The old woman's eyes are shut and her breathing is almost imperceptible
(whispering) We can't give up, honey
The family's got to get acrost
You know that
' Ever'thing all right
Ma does not answer immediately
Her head lifted, she is staring at Granma's face
Then slowly she withdraws her hand from Grandma's heart
(slowly) Yes, ever'thing's all right
-- guess  dropped off to sleep
Her head rests again
She lies looking fixedly at the still face
The scene dissolves to an  , near Daggett, California, at night
Obeying a sign that reads: " ," the Joad truck pulls up under a long shed as two officers, yawning, come out to inspect it
One takes down the license number and opens the hood
The people aboard the truck bestir themselves sleepily
What's this here
Agricultural inspection
We got to go over your stuff
Got any vegetables or seed
No
Well, we got to look over your stuff
You got to unload
gets down off the truck, her face swollen, her eyes hard
There is an undercurrent of hysteria in her voice and manner
Look, mister
We got a sick ol' lady
We got to get her to a doctor
We can't wait
(Almost hysterically) You can't make us wait
Yeah
Well, we got to look you over
swear we ain't got anything swear it
An' Granma's awful sick
(Pulling him to the truck) Look
The officer lights his flashlight on Granma's face
(shocked) You wasn't foolin'
You swear you got no fruit or vegetables
No,  swear it
Then go ahead
You can get a doctor at Barstow
That's just eight miles
But don't stop
Don't get off
Understand
Ma climbs back up beside Granma
Okay, cap
Much oblige
The truck starts
(to John) Tell Tom he don't have to stop
Granma's all right
The  moves away on Highway 66
The scene dissolves to the  , by day
Taking it from the book, there is a breath-taking view of the valley from where Highway 66 comes out of the mountains
This is the California the Joads have dreamed of, rich and beautiful, the land of milk and honey
It is just daybreak, with the sun at the Joad's back
They have pulled off the side of the road and stopped, just to drink in the sight
They are looking almost reverently at the sight before them as they climb stiffly out of the truck
Will ya look at her
(shaking his head) never knowed they was anything like her
One by one, they climb down
Where's Ma
want Ma to see it
Look, Ma
Come here, Ma
He starts back
is holding to the rear of the truck, her face stiff and swollen, her eyes deep-sunk, her limbs weak and shaky
(shocked) Ma, you sick
(hoarsely) Ya say we're acrost
(eagerly) Look, Ma
Thank God
An' we're still together-- most of us
(Her knees buckle and she sits down on the running board) Didn' you get no sleep
No
Was Granma bad
(after a pause) Granma's dead
(shocked) When
Since before they stopped us las' night
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look
(nodding) was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross
But  tol' Granma
tol' her when she was dyin'
tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost
tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped
With the valley for background, Ma looks down on it
(softly) So it's all right
At leas' she'll get buried in a nice green place
Trees and flowers aroun'
(Smiling sadly) She got to lay her head down in California after all
The scene fades out
, by day, fades in
Down a town or small city business street, with quite a bit of traffic, comes the Joad truck being pushed by the Joad men
At the wheel, aiming at a corner gas station, is Rosasharn, frightened and uncertain, with Ma beside her on the front seat
In the back Ruthie and Winfield are delighted with this new form of locomotion
Crossing the street, a policeman falls into step with Tom
How far you figger you gonna get *this* way
Right here
We give out a gas
It is a two-pump station and one of the pumps has a car, with the attendant servicing it
The Joad truck stops by the other pump and Tom, wiping his face with his sleeve, grins and address himself to the policeman
The others stand listening solemnly in the background
Where's the bes' place to get some work aroun' here
(Pulling out the handbill) Don't matter what kin' either
(patiently) If  seen one a them things  must a seen ten thousan'
Ain't it no good
(shaking his head) Not here--not now
Month ago there was some pickin' but it's all moved south now
Where'bouts in Oklahoma you from
Sallisaw
come out from Cherokee County--two years ago
(pleased) Why, Connie's folks from Cherokee County-- (stopping her wearily) Okay, ma'am, let's don't go into it
already met about a hundred firs' cousins an' it mus' be five hundred secon'
But this is what  got to tell you, don't try to park in town tonight
Keep on out to that camp
If we catch you in town after dark we got to lock you up
Don't forget
(worriedly) But what we gonna *do*
(about to leave) Pop, that just ain't up to me
(Grimly he points to the handbill) But  don't min' tellin' you, the guy they *ought* to lock up is the guy that sent out *them* things
He strolls away, the Joads looking concernedly after him, just as the gas station attendant comes briskly to them after disposing of the other car
(brightly) How many, folks
(after a pause) One
The attendant regards him in disgust
The scene dissolves to , by day
large migrant camp, a typical shanty town of ragged tents and tarpaper shacks, jalopies and dirty children
dozen or more children pause to watch as the Joad truck lumbers down a dirt incline from the road and stops at the edge of the camp in front of one of the most miserable of the shacks
The Joads regard the camp with dismay
(shaking his head) She shore don't look prosperous
Want to go somewheres else
On a gallon a gas
(As Tom grins at her) Let's set up the tent
Maybe  can fix us up some stew
The truck moves into the camp through a lane of children
The scene dissolves to the
In front of it, Ma is on her knees feeding a small fire with broken sticks
On the fire is a pot of stew
Ruthie and Winfield stand watching the pot
About fifteen ragged, barefooted children in a half- circle are now around the fire, their solemn eyes on the pot of stew
Occasionally they look at Ma, then back at the stew
Presently one of the older girls speaks
(shyly) could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am
(gently) You want to get ast to eat, hunh
(simply) Yes, ma'am
Didn' you have no breakfast
No, ma'am
They ain't no work hereabouts
Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along
Didn' none of these have no breakfast
There is a long silence
Then: (boastfully) did
Me an' my brother did
We et good
Then you ain't hungry, are you
The boy chokes, his lip sticks out
(doggedly) We et good
(Then he breaks and runs) Well, it's a good thing *some* a you ain't hungry, because they ain't enough to go all the way roun'
Aw, he was braggin'
Know what he done
Las' night, come out an' say they got chicken to eat
Well, sir, looked in whilst they was a-eatin' an' it was fried dough jus' like ever'body else
Pa and John enter
How 'bout it
(to Ruthie) Go get Tom an' Al
(looking helplessly at the children) dunno what to do
got to feed the fambly
What'm  gonna do with these here
She is dishing the stew into tin plates
The children's eyes follow the spoon, and then the first plate, to John
He is raising the first spoonful to his mouth when he notices them apparently for the first time
He is chewing slowly, his eyes on the children, their eyes on his face, when Tom and Al enter
(standing up) You take this
(Handing plate to Tom) ain't hungry
Whatta ya mean
You ain't et today
know, but  got a stomickache ain't hungry
(after a glance at the children) You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it
Wouldn't be no use
'd still see 'em inside the tent
(to the children) You git
Go on now, git
You ain't doin' no good
They ain't enough for you
The children retreat a step, but no more, and then look wonderingly at him
We can't send 'em away
Take your plates an' go inside
Take a plate to Rosasharn
(Smiling, to the children) Look
You little fellas go an' get you each a flat stick an' 'll put what's lef' for you
(The children scatter) But they ain't to be no fightin'
(Dishing plates for Ruthie and Winfield) don't know if 'm doin' right or not but--go inside, ever'body stay inside
(The children are back) They ain't enough
All you gonna get is jus' a taste but-- can't help it,  can't keep it from you
She goes in the tent hurriedly to hide the fact that tears have come into her eyes
The children pounce on the pot, silently, too busy digging for the stew to speak
they have all finished their stew already
(bitterly) done fine
Now nobody got enough
At the  a new coupe drives off the highway and into the camp and stops
It contains two men
One gets out
are squatting in a half-circle, the usual pattern for conversation, but they are silent now as their eyes fix on the man approaching
He is a labor agent
the men are looking in the direction of the group
They start to walk toward it
: The agent, wearing a flat-brimmed Stetson and with his pockets filled with pencils and dog-eared booklets, looks down at the silent men
All of the men in the camp are approaching slowly, silently
The women give their anxious attention in the background
Among the men who walk up is , a grimly disappointed young man
You men want to work
Sure we wanta work
Where's it at
Tulare County
Fruit's opening up
Need a lot of pickers
You doin' the hirin'
Well, 'm contracting the land
Whay you payin
Well, can't tell exactly, yet
'Bout thirty cents,  guess
Why can't you tell
You took the contrac', didn' you
That's true
But it's keyed to the price
Might be a little more, might be a little less
(quietly) All right, mister
'll go
You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go
(ominously) You trying to tell me how to run my own business
' we're workin' for you, it's our business too
An' how do we know-- (pulling out a handbill) --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out
(tough) Listen, Smart Guy
'll run my business my own way
got work
If you wanta take it, okay
If not, just sit here, that's all
The squatting men have risen one by one
Their faces are expressionless because they simply don't know when one of these calls is genuine or when it isn't
Floyd addresses them
Twicet now 've fell for that line
Maybe he needs a thousan' men
So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour
An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry
(Facing the agent) ' he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay
Ast to see his license
He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license
(turning) Joe
The other man gets out of the
He wears riding breeches and laced boots, carries a pistol and cartridge belt, and there is a deputy sheriff's star on his brown shirt
He smiles thinly and shifts his pistol holster as he starts toward the group
are watching the deputy approach
(angrily) You see
If this guy was on the level, would he bring a cop along
(entering) What's the trouble
(pointing at Floyd) Ever see this guy before
What'd he do
He's agitatin'
Hmmm
(Giving Floyd a looking over) Seems like  have
Seems like  seen him hangin' around that used car lot that was busted into
Yep, 'd swear it's the same fella
(Sharply) Get in that car
You got nothin' on him
Open your trap again and you'll go too
(to the men) You fellas don't wanta lissen to troublemakers
You better pack up an' come on to Tulare County
The men say nothing
Might be a good idea to do what he says
Too many of you Okies aroun' here already
Folks beginnin' to figger it ain't maybe *safe*
Might start a epidemic or sump'n
(After a pause) Wouldn't like a bunch a guys down here with pick handles tonight, would you
As the agent gets into the coupe ' thumbs hook over his belt and he looks off, away
' look away is an answer
His thumbs also hook over his belt
(to Floyd) Now, you
He takes hold of Floyd's left arm
At the same time Floyd swings, smacks him in the face
As the deputy staggers, Tom sticks out a foot and trips him
Floyd is already running through the camp
The deputy fires from the ground
There is a scream
is looking down at her hand, the knuckles shot away
The  is seen as the agent steps on the gas to get away
As Floyd gets in the clear, the , sitting on the ground, aims his pistol again, slowly, carefully
Behind him Casy steps up, gauges his distance, and then kicks him square in the base of the skull
The deputy tumbles over unconscious
Tom picks up the pistol
Gimme that gun
Now git outa here
Go down in them willows an' wait
(angrily) ain't gonna run
He seen you, Tom
You wanta be fingerprinted
You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole
You're right
Hide in the willows
If it's awright to come back 'll give you four high whistles
As Tom strides away there is the distant sound of a siren
Casy empties the gun and throws cartridges and gun aside
The men, aghast, have been standing back, worried and excited and apprehensive
They wish nothing like this had happened
The women have gathered around the wounded woman, who is sobbing
Now at the sound of the siren everybody begins to move uncomfortably toward his tent or shack
Al looks admiringly from Casy to the unconscious deputy
Everybody has disappeared into his tent but Al and Casy
The siren draws nearer
Go on
Get in your tent
You don't know nothin'
How 'bout you
(grinning) *Some*body got to take the blame
They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know
(Shrugging) An'  ain't doin' nothin' but set around
But ain't no reason-- (savagely) Lissen
don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary
Okay
think you're a darn fool, though
Sure
Why not
Al heads for the Joad tent and Casy kneels down and lifts the deputy
He wipes his face clean
The deputy begins to come to
An open car curves off the highway, stops in the clearing, and four men with rifles pile out
The deputy sits rubbing his eyes and Casy stands
What's goin' on here
This man a yours, he got tough an' hit him
Then he started shootin'-- hit a woman down the line--so  hit him again
Well--what'd you do in the first place
talked back
Two of the men have helped the deputy to his feet
He feels the back of his neck gingerly
They's a woman down there like to bleed to death from his bad shootin'
(to assistant) Take a look at her
(To deputy) Mike, is this the fella that hit you
(dazedly) Don't look like him
It was me, all right
You just got smart with the wrong fella
(shuddering) Don't look like him, but
maybe it was
ain't sure
Get in that car
With a deputy on either side of him, Casy climbs in the back seat
The sickish deputy is helped into the car
The other man comes running back
(proudly) Boy, what a mess a
45 does make
They got a tourniquet on
We'll send a doctor out
The car starts
and two deputies beside him are revealed in the back seat
Casy sits proudly, head up, eyes front
On his lips is a faint smile; on his face, a curious look of conquest
(angry at the whole business) But what you gonna do
Must be *thousands* of 'em around here, sore and hungry and living in them dumps
What you gonna do about 'em
You gotta hold 'em down
Hold 'em down or they'll take over the whole country
That's all you *can* do
(grimly) Well, they ain't gonna take over *my* country
been livin' here too long for *that*
Maybe some a the boys better drop around tonight and give 'em something to think about
Casy sits with eyes front
, screened by trees or brush, Tom looks off at the car taking Casy away
Starting at a sound, he withdraws into the brush as the scene dissolves
, at night, Ma stands facing Pa and Al
Rosasharn lies on a pallet, her face in her arms, while Ruthie and Winfield look on, wide-eyed at the family quarrel
(to Ma) Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around-- Sure
was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls  know
You don't know *no* girls around here
You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*
(a short flash of momentary but ill advised belligerence) Cut it out, Ma, or 'll-- (softly, as she picks up jack-handle) You'll *what*
Come on, Pa
Come on an' whup me
Jus' try it
(solemnly) Now don't get sassy, Ma
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away
(Hefting the jack- handle) An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first
So some on
(helplessly) never *seen* her so sassy
(With a touch of bewildered pride) An' she ain't so young, neither
(sullenly) 'd come back-- (eyes on Pa) But ef you *do* whup me,  swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, 'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket
They stand staring at each other in silence
At the   , Tom is heading for the Joad tent warily, glancing around constantly, but not running, for that would draw attention to him
again: (helplessly) Jus' sassy, that's all
(angrily) Sassy my foot
'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up
All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have
Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma
All wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself-- (blazing) Well, you ain't a-goin'
Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'
We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together
As long as we got the fambly unbroke ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us-- (squaring off) --an' 'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore 'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn
As she gets ready for whatever
, twenty feet away from the tent, Tom whistles softly
Hey, Al
, all but Ma are looking off
Ma still eyes Pa
(peering into the darkness) Tom
You can come on
They gone
(entering quickly) We got to get outa here right away
Ever'body here
Where's Uncle John
(from tent) Here  am
What's a matter now
Fella tells me some a them poolroom boys figgerin' to burn the whole camp out tonight
Got to get that truck loaded--what you doin' with the jack-handle, Ma
, , (together) Al's tryin' to go away
She jus' got sassy
All  aimed to do
(taking the jack-handle) Awright, you can fight it out later
Right now we got to hustle
Where's Connie
There is a silence that stops Tom in his rush of preparation
(quietly) Connie's gone
(Indicating Rosasharn) Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this
(angrily) Glad to get shet of him
Never was no good an' never will be-- Pa
Shh
How come  got to shh
Run out, didn't he
(looking to Rosasharn) Cut it out, Pa
He'p Al with the truck
(He kneels beside Rosasharn
Gently) Don't fret, honey
You goin' to be awright
(uncovering her face) Tom,  jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall
Without him  jus' don't wanta live
Maybe he'll be back
We'll leave word for him
Jus' don't cry
(He pats her awkwardly) The scene dissolves to , at night
The jalopies are lumbering up on the road, one after the other, as the migrants scatter before the threatened invasion
, Tom is helping Rosasharn into the front seat, beside Ma
The others are aboard except Al
Tom hands Al a wrench
Just in case
Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it
(from truck) ain't got nothin' in *my* han'
(to Al) Give 'im a fryin' pan
(He gets into the driver's seat and starts the truck) In the   of the truck, Tom drives, Ma sits in the middle, Rosasharn on the other side
(hopefully) Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with
He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know
Maybe he figgered to suprise us
Maybe that's jus' what he done
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that
You promised me
know, Ma
'm a tryin'
If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it
But it *ain't* the law
They're workin' away at our spirits
They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl
They're workin' on our decency
You promised, Tommy
'm a-tryin', Ma
Honest  am
You gotta keep clear, Tom
The fambly's breakin' up
You *got* to keep clear
What's that--detour
As he slows down the truck, we see that half of the  is blocked with boards and red lanterns
a group of men swarm around the Joad truck as it stops
leader leans in Tom's window
Where you think you're goin'
In the   of the truck Tom's hand reaches for the jack-handle on the seat at his side but Ma's hand clutches his arm in a steel grip
Well-- (then in a servile whine) --we're strangers here
We heard about they's work in a place called Tulare
Well, you're goin' the wrong way, an' what's more, we don't want no more Okies in this town
We ain't got work enough for them that are already here
Tom's arm trembles as he tries to pull it away, but Ma holds on tight
Which way is it at, mister
You turn right aroun' and head north
An' don't come back till the cotton's ready
Yes, sir
The  turns around
In the   Tom is almost sobbing with anger as he maneuvers the truck around
(whispering) Don't you min', Tommy
You done good
You done jus' good
The  is going back down the road as the scene fades out
fades in: superimposed on growing fields hand-made signs flash by:   ,  --  , ,
Then we see the   pulled up off the paved highway, and jacked up while Tom and Al fix a puncture
Ma is seated in the front seat with Rosasharn
Pa and Uncle John are puttering about worriedly
(thoughtfully) Sump'n got to happen soon
We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes
After that
(Looking at Rosasharn) An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon
(shaking his head) It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat
Fella tells me they's three hunerd thousan' aroun' here like us, a- scrabblin' for work an' livin' like hogs
Can't figger what it is, but *sump'n's* wrong
which has been speeding toward them stops suddenly
Driving it is a husky man, named Spencer, whose manner is amiable and disarming
Morning
Morning
You people looking for work
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work
Can you pick peaches
We can pick anything
Well, there's plenty of work for you about forty miles north, this road just outside Pixley
Turn east on 32 and look for Hooper's ranch
Tell 'em Spencer sent you
This is electrifying news, as their faces show
Mister, we sure that ya
As they snap into action to get under way again the scene dissolves to the  , Al driving, with Ma and Tom beside him
They are all smiles, their faces glowing with excitement
(excitedly) Fust thing 'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat
Better not get no side- meat right off
Save that for later
Maybe Sat'dy
Got to get some soap too
An' milk
Rosasharn's got to have some milk
Get some sugar too, for the coffee
You know,  jus' can't remember when felt so good before
Know what 'm a-gonna do
'm a-gonna save up an' go in town an' get me a job in a garage
Live in a room an' eat in restaurants
Go to the movin' pitchers *ever'* night
Cowboy pitchers
The scene dissolves to the      in daylight
gravel road leads from the paved highway to the big wire gates, which are enclosed
Along the side of the paved highway are parked a dozen jalopies, the migrants sitting soberly in them
Fifty or sixty other migrants line the gravel road and the junction with the paved highway
Five jalopies are in line waiting to enter the gates
And the scene is overwhelmingly policed
There must be ten motorcycle cops around
Six are dismounted and strolling to keep order among the migrants along the road
Three, their motorcycles roaring, flank the line of five jalopies
As the Joad truck drives up, we see the
Tom, Al, and Ma are beholding the scene with bewilderment
What is it, a wreck
(on motorcycle) Where you think you're going
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches
Want to work, do you
Sure do
Pull up behind that car
(Calling) Okay for this one
Take 'em through
(the truck moving) What's the matter
What's happened
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through
Just follow the line
The motorcycle escort forms around the line of six cars and a deafening din is raised, of motorcycles, sirens, and an inexplicable blowing of horns on the jalopies
At the same time, as the gates open and the six cars start through, flanked by the motorcycle cops, the migrants begin spasmodic shouts, but what they say cannot be understood
As the cars move slowly, Tom and Al in the   are puzzled and worried at the demonstration
Maybe the road's out
don't know what these cops got to do with it but  don't like it
(Looking out) An' these here are our own people, all of 'em
don't like this
the heckling from the bystanders is spasmodic, not continuous, as the six jalopies in line pass through the gate into the Hooper ranch
Two men stand beside the gates with shotguns
They keep calling
Go on, go on
Keep movin'
The Joad truck passes through the gates the six jalopies are halted at the end of a camp street
The houses are small, square blocks, set in line
One, a little larger, is a grocery store
Casually about are men in pairs with metal stars on their shirts and shotguns in their hands
Two bookkeepers are already passing down the cars and jotting down information
Want to work
Sure, but what is this
That's not your affair
Name
Joad
How many men
Four
Women
Two
Kids
Two
Can all of you work
Why,  guess so
Okay
House 63
Wages 5 cents a box
No bruised fruit
Move along and go to work right away
He moves to the next car
The Joad truck starts
63, as the Joad truck pulls up, two deputies approach
They look closely into each face as the Joads pile out
One of the deputies has a long list in his hand
Name
(impatiently) Joad
Say, what is this here
(consulting list) Not here
Take a look at his license
542-567 Oklahoma
Ain't got it
Guess they're okay
(To Tom) Now you look here
We don't want no trouble with you
Jes' do your work and mind your own business and you'll be all right
(The deputies walk away) They sure do want to make us feel at home all right
Ma and Rosasharn step inside the house
It is filthy
rusty tin stove resting on four bricks is all the one room contains
Ma and Rosasharn stand looking around at it
Finally: We gonna live here
(after a moment) Why, sure
It won't be so bad once we get her washed out
like the tent better
This got a floor
Wouldn't leak when it rains
, a clerk with glasses appears, pushing a cart loaded with three-gallon buckets
Name
(patiently) It's still Joad
(doling out the buckets) How many
(at the door) Six
(To Tom) All y'all go
Me an' Rosasharn'll unload
With their buckets they shuffle away toward the peach trees-- Tom, Pa, Uncle John, Al, and the two children struggling with the enormous containers
The scene dissolves to the    63 at night, a lantern lighting the scene
Sitting wherever they can, the Joads have finished their supper of hamburgers
And grateful they are too, for the meat
(wiping his mouth) Got any more, Ma
No
That's all
You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth
That
They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place
ain't full
Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty
(rising) You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back
Think 'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was
Anybody wanta come with me
No
'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed
Think 'll look aroun' an' see if can't meet me a girl
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about
Got me all curious
got to get a lot curiouser than am--with all them cops out there
(laughing) Okay
be back a little later
You be careful, Tommy
Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything
(leaving) Okay, Ma
Don't you worry
There is a faint moonlight, but not much, and little sound from the other houses as Tom strolls down the street
: beyond, cars pass
As Tom approaches the gate a flashlight plays on his face suddenly and a guard rises from a box
Where you think you're going
Thought 'd take a walk
Any law against it
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way
You mean  can't even get outa here
Not tonight you can't
Want to walk back
--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back
'll walk back
The guard watches him as he walks back and then douses his flashlight
At a    , watching his chance, moving silently, Tom drops on the ground, on his back, gets his head under the bottom wire, and pushes himself under and outside
Rising, he crosses the paved highway
across the road from the wire fence: Tom clambers down it, moving quietly
He picks his way down the shallow ravine
: there is a light inside and there are the shadows of figures
In the background, beyond the tent, is the silhouette of a small concrete bridge spanning a small stream
Following a trail, Tom enters and approaches the tent
(The opening is away from him
)     , a man sitting on a box looks up suspiciously as Tom enters
His name is Joe
Evenin'
Who are you
Jus' goin' pas', that's all
Know anybody here
No
Jus' goin' pas',  tell you
head sticks out of the tent
Until he speaks, Tom does not recognize Casy
What's the matter
Casy
What you doin' here
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad
How ya, boy
Thought you was in jail
No,  done my time an' got out
Come on in
(He pulls Tom into the tent
) , three other men sit on the ground as Casy brings Tom in
One's name is Frank
This the fella you been talkin' about
This is him
What you doin' here, Tommy
Workin'
Pickin' peaches
But  seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so  come out to see what's goin' on
What's it all about
This here's a strike
(puzzled) Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat
Fi' cents
They pain' you fi' cents
Sure
We made a buck since midday
(after a long silence) Lookie, Tom
We come to work here
They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents
But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents
Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids
(After a pause) So we says we won't take it
So they druv us off
Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five
dunno
Payin' five now
(soberly) don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days
You goin' back tonight
aim to
(earnestly) Well--tell the folks inside how it is, Tom
Tell 'em they're starvin' us and stabbin' theirself in the back
An' as sure as God made little apples it's goin' back to two an' a half jus' as soon as they clear us out
(suddenly) You hear sump'n
They listen
Then: 'll tell 'em
But  don't know how
Never seen so many guys with guns
Wouldn't even let us talk today
Try an' tell 'em, Tom
They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone
An' you know what that is
That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar
That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive
Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom
Them peaches is *ripe*
Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five
They won't
They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five
(bitterly) An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a --until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in
know exackly what Pa'd say
He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business
(reluctantly) guess that's right
Have to take a beatin' before he'll know
We was outa food
Tonight we had meat
Not much, but we had it
Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas
An' Rosasharn needs milk
Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate
(sadly) Got to learn, like 'm a-learnin'
Don't know it right yet myself, but 'm tryin' to fin' out
That's why can't ever be a preacher again
Preacher got to *know*
(Shaking his head) don't
got to *ask*
(sticking his head in tent) don't like it
What's the matter
Can't tell
Seems like  hear sump'n, an' then  listen an' they ain't nothin' to hear
(rising) 'Tain't outa the question, y'know
(He exits) All of us a little itchy
Cops been tellin' us how they gonna beat us up an' run us outa the country
Not them reg'lar deppities, but them tin- star fellas they got for guards
(After a pause) They figger 'm the leader because talk so much
Frank's head sticks in the door
His voice is an excited whisper
Turn out that light an' come outside
They's sump'n here
Quickly Casy turns the light down and out
He gropes for the door, followed by Tom and the other man
: (softly) What is it
dunno
Listen
There are night sounds but little else to be distinguished
Can't tell if you hear it or not
You hear it, Tom
(softly) hear it
think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em
We better get outa here
(whispering) Down that way--under the bridge span
Casy leads the way softly
is seen from the stream as Casy, Tom, and the other man wade carefully toward it
it is almost black as they creep through the culvert
Just as Casy and Tom step out from under the bridge on the other side, a blinding flashlight hits them, lighting them like day
There they are
Stand where you are
Halted, uncertain, they stand as three men with stars on their coats and pickhandles in their hands slide down the Two of them hold lighted flashlights
That's him
That one in the middle, the skinny one
Chuck
Alec
Here they are
We got 'em
There are faint responses from a distance
are alone
The others have fled
The deputies approach, their lights on Casy and Tom
Listen, you fellas
You don't know what you're doin'
You're helpin' to stave kids
Shut up, you red-- He swings the pickhandle
Casy dodges but the stick cracks his skull
He falls face down out of the light
The deputies watch for a moment but Casy doesn't stir
Looks like to me you killed him
Turn him over
Put the light on him
Bending over, their bodies hide Casy
, seen close, is breathing hard, his eyes glistening
' Serves him right, too
As the deputies straighten up, Tom steps forward, grabs the pickhandle from the man who felled Casy, and swings
The blow strikes the deputy's arm, sending his flashlight flying, and the scene is in semi-darkness as Tom swings again
There is a grunt and a groan as the deputy goes down
Then all is confusion
Backing away, swinging the pickhandle, Tom bolts, splashes a few yards through the stream, turns and gains a better start by throwing the pickhandle at his pursuers
They duck, and Tom disappears into the night
The other men rush through the scene in pursuit
is seen bending over the body of the man Tom laid out
Where's that flash
Here
The light flashes on the man's face
(awed) Boy, he's *good* and dead
You see that fella that done it
ain't sure--but  caught him one across the face, and believe me, give him a trade-mark *he* ain't gonna be able to shake off easy
is seen crashing through the bushes, his face bloody
The scene fades out
63 fades in
It is day
Ma comes down the street with a bundle under her arm and enters the house
63, Rosasharn sits by the window as Ma enters
Anybody ask anything
No'm
Stand by the door
Rosasharn takes her post at the door as Ma kneels on the floor beside Tom, puts down the rag bundle, and gets a basin
Tom, who is under a quilt, is with his back alone visible
She speaks softly, guardedly, as she bathes his face
How's it feel, Tommy
Busted my cheek but  can still see
What'd you hear
Looks like you done it
(soberly) kinda thought so
Felt like it
Folks ain't talkin' about much else
They say they got posses out
Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella
They killed Casy first
That ain't the way they're tellin' it
They're sayin' you done it fust
(after a pause) They know what--this fella looks like
They know he got hit in the face
(slowly) 'm sorry, Ma
But-- didn't know what  was doin', no more'n when you take a breath
didn't even know was gonna do it
It's awright, Tommy
wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do
can't read no fault in you
'm gonna go away tonight
can't go puttin' this on you folks
(angrily) Tom
They's a whole lot  don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us
(Thoughtfully) They was the time when we was on the lan'
They was a bound'ry to us then
Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear
But now we ain't clear no more
They ain't nothin' keeps us clear
Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own
An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along
Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more
We're crackin' up, Tom
They ain't no fambly now
Rosasharn-- (a glance at the girl) --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly
been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way
Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals
Got nothin' to trus'
Don't go Tom
Stay an' help
Help me
(tiredly) Okay, Ma
shouldn't, though know  shouldn't
But okay
Here come a lot of people
Tom puts his head under the quilt
Ma turns, faces the door, her body protectively between Tom and whatever threatens
' How many of you
' Ten of us
Whatcha payin'
63, the bookkeeper has encountered the newcomers
House 25
Number's on the door
Okay, mister
Whatcha payin'
Two and a half cents
(angrily) Two an' a half
Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that
Take it or leave it
There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it
But--but how we gonna eat
Look,  didn't set the price
'm just working here
If you want it, take it
If you don't, turn right around and beat it
(sullenly) Which way is House 25
(slowly) That Casy
He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear
He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too
Comes night we'll get outa here
At night, the  is backed up to the door of House 63; it is already loaded
Ma is speaking in a low voice to Tom, who is peering out from under a mattress in the truck
It's jus' till we get some distance
Then you can come out
'd hate to get *trapped* in here
' What's goin' on here
Tom disappears
Ma turns, her back to the truck
The guard plays his flashlight on the Joads, who stand watching him ominously
We're goin' out
What for
We got a job offered--good job
Yeah
Let's have a look at you
(He plays his flashlight on the truck) Wasn't there another fella with you
You mean that hitch-hiker
Little short fella with a pale face
guess that's what he looked like
We just picked him up on the way in
He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped
(thinking hard) What'd he look like again
Short fella
Pale face
Was he bruised up this mornin'
About the face
didn't see nothin'
(reluctantly) Okay
Go on
Quickly, Al is in the driver's seat, with Ma and Pa beside him
The truck rattles into motion and moves down the street
another guard flashes a light as Al stops the car
Goin' out for good
Yeah
Goin' north
Got a job
Okay
He opens the gate and the truck goes through
It turns from the gravel road onto the paved highway
: You done good, Al
Just good
Al shows his pleased pride in her quiet approval
Know where we're a-goin'
(shaking her head) Don't matter
Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here
The  is rattling along the highway
Next, it is day, and the  is still churning along
In the  , Tom is driving, his cap pulled as far down as possible over his wounded cheek
Rosasharn has taken Pa's place and is leaning wearily against Ma's shoulder
Ma
you know, if Connie was here wouldn't min' any a this
know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him
How 'bout gas, Tommy
Full up
Uncle John come through with five bucks he been hol'in' out on us since we lef' home
The  keeps moving along
Then it is night, and the  is still making distance
On a  , in grey dawn, with a deafening clank under the hood, the Joad truck pulls to a stop off the side of the road
Al is driving
Asleep in Tom's arm in the front seat, Ma stirs awake as Al turns off the ignition and gets out
He lifts the hood
She's hotter'n a heifer
Fan-belt's shot
He pulls out the pieces
Tom gets out and takes off the radiator cap
There is a geyser of steam
In the back of the truck the others stand looking on, sleepy-eyed
(looking around) Picks a nice place for it, too, don't she
They all look around
At first they find nothing in sight
Al and Tom look at each other in disgust
Any gas
Gallon or two
(whistling) Well, looks like we done it this time awright
(standing in truck) Tommy
(Pointing) Some smoke up there
All look
Tom climbs on the running board the better to see
Looks like about a mile
Reckon she'll make it
She got to make it
(as they get back in) What is it
Don't know--but it's better'n this
As Al starts the truck, the scene dissolves to a weather- beaten wooden sign: "
9"  " " We see the     , a wide gate in a high wire fence, with a caretaker's shack to one side of the gate
The caretaker stands beside his shack as the Joad truck swings off the road, hits an unnoticed rut that bounces the whole truck off the ground, and stops
(mildly) You hit 'er too fast
In the   Al leans angrily out of the driver's window
Tom is keeping his face away from the caretaker's line of vision
What's the idea of that
(chuckling) Well, a lot a kids play in here
You tell folks to go slow and they liable to forget
But let 'em hit that hump once and they don't forget
Al starts climbing out
Pa jumps down from the truck
Got any room here for us
(nodding) You're lucky
Fellow just moved out half-hour ago
(Pointing) Down that line and turn to the left
You'll see it
You'll be in No
4 Sanitary Unit
What's that
Toilet and showers and washtubs
You mean you got *washtubs
* An' runnin' water
Yes, ma'am
(To Al) Camp committee'll call on you in the morning and get you fixed
(quickly) Cops
No
No cops
Folks here elect their own cops
(To Ma) The ladies' committee'll call on you, ma'am, about the kids and the sanitary unit and who takes care of 'em
(To Al) Come inside and sign up
As Ma, Pa, and Al look at each other in almost incredulous bewilderment, Tom climbs out of the truck
Take 'er on down, Al
'll sign
We gonna stay, ain't we
You're tootin' we're gonna stay
(He follows the caretaker into the shack) , Tom enters warily, alert for any indication that either his name or his scar may have been learned and telegraphed here
But the caretaker obviously attaches no significance to either
The shack is bare but for a cot, a table, a chair, and an electric light
The caretaker is seated at the table, pen in hand, a soiled ledger open, when Tom enters
don't mean to be nosy, y'understand
just got to have certain information
What's your name
(watching him) Joad
Tom Joad
(writing) How many of you
is seen in front of its camp site as the Joads descend
How 'bout it, Uncle John
Gotta pitch this tent
(groggy with sleep) 'm a-comin'
You don't look so good
*ain't* so good, but--'m a-comin'
' : Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that
We'll work it out
What's this committee you talkin' about
We got five sanitary units
Each one elects a central committee man
They make the laws, an' what they say goes
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here
That's the way it is
(after a pause) An' you say no cops
(shaking his head) No cop can come in here without a warrant
(marveling) can't hardly believe it
Camp was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas
They don't get in here
Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights
You got dances too
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night
Say, who runs this place
Government
Why ain't they more like it
(shortly) *You* find out,  can't
Anything like work aroun' here
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him
(leaving) Ma's shore gonna like it here
She ain't been treated decent for a long time
(as Tom is at the door) That cut you got
(evenly) Crate fell on me
Better take care of it
Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning
Goodnight
Goodnight
As he exits we see the  , with Tom coming out of the shack, amazement still on his face
As he walks slowly down the main camp street we share the revelation of the place to him
It is nearly daylight
Roosters crow in the distance
The street is neat and orderly in a military way, its cleanliness in sharp contrast to anything he has known before
Inside the tents people are stirring
In front of one tent a woman is cooking breakfast
baby is in her arms
Good mornin'
Mornin'
As he walks on, Tom draws a breath of exultation
As he moves on, looking around, we see the
4, a cheap frame building the purpose of which is pretty obvious
Ruthie, warily alert lest she be caught, is peering in the door
She looks a long time and then she runs out of the scene
is seen asleep in a quilt on the ground when Ruthie enters and rousts him out
(in an excited whisper) Git up
got sump'n to show you
(sleepily) Whatsa matter
(tugging him) It's them white things, made outa dish-stuff, like in the catalogues
He stumbles after her
4
Ruthie is putting on a bold front as she leads Winfield into sight but she is still alert for interference
Come on
Ain't nobody gonna say anything
Won't they ketch us
He follows her into the unit, big-eyed with excitement and apprehension
There is a silence
Then: ' Them's where you wash your han's
Another silence
Then: ' What's these
' (uncertainly) Well,  reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath
Another silence
Then: ' (excitedly) Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they
' (proudly) seen 'em b'fore you did
' What's this
' (in alarm) Now don't you go monk'ing-- There is the sound of a toilet flushing
It is a cheap toilet and it is a loud flush which eventually ends in a long refilling of the tank just as loudly
There is a paralyzed silence
Then: ' Now you done it
You busted it
' never-- Terrified, Winfield comes dashing out of the unit but Ruthie grabs him just outside the door
Beginning to cry, he struggles to get away
Lemme go
didn't go to do it
(fiercely) Keep qui'te, will ya
Shet your mouth
(weeping) never knowed it
All  done was pull that string
Lissen
You done busted it
You hear
(They listen to the refilling of the tank) But lissen here
won't tell nobody, y'understan'
Please don't
won't-- (craftily) --if you won't tell what ** done
He nods quickly
Then Ruthie begins to walk away with what she fancies is an innocent, nonchalant stroll, yawning casually
Sniffling a little, Winfield mimics her, a very innocent walk and yawn indeed
The scene dissolves to a
Alongside the ditch are some lengths of concrete pipe
Tom and the two Wallaces are in the ditch, Tom and Tim picking, Wilkie shoveling
(exulting) If this don't feel good
(chuckling) Wait'll about 'leven o'clock, see how good she feels then
Seems like a nice frien'ly fella to work for, too
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas
Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so
Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway
Gettin' some work at las'
Mr
Thomas, the farmer, a stock man wearing a paper sun helmet, enters
His face is worried as he squats down beside the ditch
What he has come to say has taken some effort and he is still uncertain and annoyed
The men stop work
Lissen here
Maybe 'm talkin' myself outa my farm, but  like you fellas, so 'm gonna tell you
You live in that gov'ment camp, don't you
(stiffening) Yes, sir
And you have dances every Saturday night
(smiling) We sure do
Well, look out next Saturday night
(suddenly tense) What you mean
belong to the central committee
got to know
Don't you ever tell  told
What is it
(angrily) Well, the association don't like the government camps
Can't get a deputy in there
Can't arrest a man without a warrant
But if there was a big fight, and maybe shooting--a bunch of deputies could go in and clean out the camp
(Unfolding a newspaper) Like last night
Lissen
"Citizens, angered at red agitators, burn another squatters' camp, warn agitators to get out of the county
" (sick of the expression) Listen
What *is* these reds
Ever'time you turn aroun' somebody sayin' somebody else's a red
What is these reds, anyway
(chuckling) Well,  tell you
They was a fella up the country named King--got about 30,000 acres an' a cannery an' a winery--an' he's all a time talkin' about reds
Drivin' the country to ruin, he says
Got to git rid of 'em, he says
Well, they was a young fella jus' come out an' he was listenin one day
He kinda scratched his head an' he says, "Mr
King, what *is* these reds you all a time talkin' about
" Well, sir, Mr
King says, "Young man, a red is any fella that wants thirty cents a hour when 'm payin' twenty-five
" (fretfully) ain't talkin' about that one way or the other
All 'm saying is that there's going to be a fight in the camp Saturday night
And there's going to be deputies ready to go in
But why
Those fellas ain't botherin' nobody
'll tell you why
Those folks in to being treated like humans
Suppose the Government closes its camps
Suppose too many people pass through 'em
Well, when those people go back to the squatters' camps they'll be hard to handle
(Wiping his brow) Go on back to work now
Maybe 've talked myself into trouble, but you're folks like us, and  like you
(extending his hand) Nobody won't know who tol'
We thank you
(Grimly) An' they ain't gonna be no fight, either
They shake hands
The scene dissolves to the    , at night
It is Saturday evening, the night of the dance
Glaring electric lights hang over the open gate
Parked jalopies line the highway as the invited guests, small farmers and migrants from other camps and their families, arrive to be greeted and checked by a committee of three men
Ev'nin', ma'am
Who'd you say invited you
Mister an' Mizz Clark, they ast us
Yes, ma'am
Come right in, ma'am
There is an air of eager anticipation, of gay celebration, and everyone is in his or her best--the men in clean washed overalls, clean shirts, some with ties, their hair damp and slicked down, the women in their nicest
Through the gate, inside the camp, can be seen the outdoor dance floor, brightly lighted, with the camp musicians already tuning up, and around the dance floor scores of wide-eyed children
, we see Wilkie and a dark- complexioned man named Jule standing among a group inside watching the arrivals
They watch sharply, eyeing everyone, listening to every credential
As his employer, Thomas, comes through the gate with his wife, Wilkie grins and greets him with a handshake
Hidy, Mr
Thomas
Hidy, Mizz Thomas
(sotto voce) You watching out, ain't you
(grinning) Don't you worry
Ain't gonna be no trouble
hope you know what you're talking about
(He moves away, Wilkie grinning after him) We see the  , and after three pats of the foot, to get the tempo, the home talent dance orchestra swings into music
, Rosasharn dressed in her nicest, sits gripping her hands together, the music seeming to bring her to the verge of tears
Ma
(Ma turns from drying dishes) Ma, -- can't go to the dance jus' can't Ma
can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way
(trying to cheer her) Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy
(miserably) can't he'p it, Ma
It don't make *me* giggly an' happy
Drying her hands, Ma sits beside Rosasharn and takes her in her arms
(tenderly) You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me
We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch
If anybody says to come dance--why 'll say you're poorly
But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun
An' you won't let nobody touch me
No--an' look what  got for you
Smiling mysteriously, Ma fishes in a pocket in her dress and brings out the envelope of her treasures
From it she produces the earrings and holds them up in front of Rosasharn's wide eyes
(softly) used to wear these--when your pa come callin' on me
(Then as she puts them on Rosasharn's ears) You'll look pretty in 'em tonight
They smile at each other, proud in the luxury of ornaments
Down the road from the  a touring car with six men pulls of the pavement and stops
Three men get out
They are bareheaded and dressed similar to the other migrants
They stroll down the highway toward the gate
The other men, deputies, sit watching them
: They tell me you're half Injun
You look all Injun to me
No, jes' half
Wisht  was full- blooded
Gov'ment'd be lookin' out for me an' 'd be ridin' around in a Buick eight
The three men from the touring car are at the gate
Wilkie and Jule watch them
Who give you the invitation
Fella named Jackson--Buck Jackson
Okay
Come on in
The three men stroll past Wilkie and Jule, whose eyes follow them
Them's our fellas
How you know
Jes' got a feelin'
They're kinda scared too
Follow 'em an' get a holt of Jackson
See if he knows 'em
'll stay here
Wilkie moves after them
We see the
The musicians are at it and the fiddler is calling turns
Swing your ladies an' a dol ce do
Join han's roun' an' away we go
Swing to the right an' a swing to the lef'
Break, now break--back to back
Well in front, among the older folks and children who surround the floor, are Ma and Rosasharn, clinging close
young man stops in front of them
(quietly) Thank you kin'ly but she ain't well
As Rosasharn's eyes drop
Ma bends toward her, a shy smile on her face
Maybe you wouldn't think it, but your pa was as nice a dancer as ever seen, when he was young
(With a little sigh) Kinda makes me think a ol' times
The three men stroll into sight and stand watching the dancing
One glances at Ma and Rosasharn but does not speak
Ma has smiled back at him
are seen; removed somewhat from the dance floor they are peering in the direction of the three men
seen 'em before
Worked at Gregorio's with 'em
But  never ast 'em
Awright
Keep your eye on 'em
Jus' keep 'em in sight, that's all
(He moves quickly away) We find ourselves   '
The five members of the central committee, Tim Wallace, chairman, look grave as a 15-year-old boy reports
seen 'em, Mr
Wallace
car with six men parked down by the euc'lyptus tree an' one with three men on the main road
They got guns, too seen 'em
Thank you, Willie
You done good
(As Willie exits) Well, it looks like the fat's in the far this time
(angrily) What them deppities want to hurt the camp for
How come they can't leave us be
What we oughta do, we oughta git us some pickhandles an'-- (quickly) No
That's what they want
No sir
If they can git a fight goin', then they can run in the cops an' say we ain't orderly-- (He stops as Wilkie enters followed by Tom) They're here
We got 'em spotted
There is a grim pause at this news
Tim's eyes go hard
(to Tom) You sure you got ever'thing ready
(calmly) Ain't gonna be no trouble
(worriedly) You ain't to hurt them fellas
(grinning) You don't have to worry
We got ever'thing arranged
Maybe nobody'll even see it
Just don't use no stick nor no knife, no piece a arn
An' if you got to sock 'em, sock 'em where they won't bleed
Yes, sir
Awright
An' if she gets outa han', 'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor
(blandly) Ain't gonna get outa han'
Wilkie makes a mocking military salute as he and Tom exit
The committee men look worriedly after them
Mighty sure a themselves, looks like
All  hope,  hope they don't kill nobody
In front of the  , dressed to kill, is Al, ready for the festivities
He wears a tight-fitting wool suit, a tie on his shirt, yellow shoes, and his hair is damp and slicked down
He rubs his hands together in anticipation as he strolls in the direction of the dance floor
At  , a blonde girl sits on a box as Al enters
Casually he throws open his coat, revealing a vivid striped shirt
This is designed to stun his quarry
Gonna dance tonight
(The girl ostentatiously ignores him) can waltz
(aloofly) That's nothin'--anybody can waltz
(shaking his head) Not like me
fat woman thrusts her head out of the tent
You git right along
This here girl's spoke for
She's gonna be married, an' her man's a-comin' for her
Shrugging, Al winks at the girl and moves on, stepping and moving his shoulders and snapping his fingers in time to the music, a very gay fellow indeed
The blonde girl's eyes follow him
Then she turns and glances cautiously toward the tent
, we see Ma and Rosasharn as Tom enters and stands between them
This is during a pause between dances and only a few couples stand on the floor waiting for the music to begin again
We also see the three men very casually looking around--but no more casual looking than Wilkie, standing just behind them, idly whistling
(grinning) She's gettin' prettier, Ma
(as Rosasharn hides her face) Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier
The music starts again, once more the dancers move onto the dance floor
The three men exchange a glance and step casually to the edge of the dancing space, one in the lead
They survey the scene, but for the moment make no further move
The atmosphere is tense
(softly) Excuse me, Ma
(He moves quietly out of the scene, toward the three men) , taking the blonde girl's hand, steps onto the dance floor
Encircling her waist, they begin to dance
They are a smooth, rhythmic couple who move as one being
Well, you said anybody can waltz
How'm ** doin'
Don't hold me so tight
(tongue-in-cheek) Why,  ain't hardly touchin' you
(squirming) You're *ticklin' me
* (grabbing her still closer) That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough
* (complaining but loving it) Now  can't breathe
At this moment the leader of the three men (the other two directly behind him) enters the scene
'll dance with this girl
(angrily) You an' who else
Behind the three men a solid wall of migrants are closing in quietly, Tom and Wilkie in the middle
Don't gimme no argament-- ( shrill whistle sounds in the distance) --you little-- His fist goes back, his left hand reaches for Al's collar
At the same instant Tom grabs him, Wilkie claps his hand over the leader's mouth, at least fifteen other men have similarly collard the other two invaders, and they are all lifted bodily
There is not a sound as the three men, held in iron grips, are whisked from the dance floor and into the crowd
Two touring cars have stopped in front of the closed and the deputies have drawn guns
Open up
We hear you got a riot
Riot
don't see no riot
Who're you
Deputy sheriffs
Got a warrant
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot
Well,  don't know what you gonna do about it, because  don't hear no riot an'  don't see no riot, an' what's more  don't believe they *is* no riot
(Waving toward the dance floor) Look for yourself
As the deputies, puzzled and uncertain, look toward the , we see the music, the dancing, the gaiety continuing as if nothing had happened
at night, several hours later: the tent is black, Tom strikes a match
From a piece of wood on the ground or floor he selects one from several cigarette butts and lights it
While he is doing so, he lifts his head suddenly, and listens
In the   we catch sight of legs walking, the ground lighted from a flashlight
Two pairs of the legs wear state policemen's leather leggings
The third pair are the caretaker's
They stop behind a car
The flashlight plays on the license plate
One of the state cops leans down to copy the license number in a booklet
Then they move on
has lifted the edge of the tent a trifle, enough to see out by flattening his head on the floor
The  are now seen at the Joad jalopy
The light is on the license plate
The cop leans over and copies the number
They move on
, lowering the edge of the tent, sits up
Quietly he pushes aside the piece of carpet that covers him
He is wearing his clothes
We see the policeman's  at the caretaker's hut
The two policemen get into the car
You got no right to arrest anybody without a warrant, you know
We'll have a warrant--just as soon as we check with headquarters
The car drives off, leaving the caretaker looking somberly after it
, his cap on, fully dressed for travel, Tom is tieing the ends of the carpet into a shoulder bundle
Rising, he slings it across his shoulder
As he tiptoes toward the door: Ain't you gonna tell me goodbye, Tommy
For a moment he looks into the darkness in her direction
didn't know, Ma
didn't know if ought
She has risen, pulling the quilt around her
He takes her by the hand
Come outside
They go out
Tom leads Ma around   , to a There is a bench there
Tom leads Ma to it and sits her down
He sits beside her
They was some cops here, Ma
They was takin' down the license numbers
It looks like somebody knows sump'n
(softly) It had to come,  reckon, soon or later
'd like to stay
'd like to be with ya-- (smiling) --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place
sure wish  could see you then
But-- (shaking his head) -- guess  won't never be able to do that
Not now
could hide you, Tommy
(touching her hand) know you would, Ma
But  ain't gonna let you
You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'
an' you'd be in trouble too
(touching his face with her fingers) Awright, Tommy
What you figger you gonna do
(thoughtfully) You know what  been thinkin' about, Ma
About Casy
About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died
An'  remember all of it
He was a good man
been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'
An'  been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled-- (frightened) Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy
They gonna drive me anyways
Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another
Until then
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom
No, Ma
Not that
That ain't it
But long as 'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe can do sump'n
Maybe  can jus' fin' out sump'n
Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it
(Worriedly) But  ain't thought it out clear, Ma
can't
don't know enough
(after a pause) How'm  gonna know 'bout you
They might kill you an'  wouldn't know
They might hurt you
How'm  gonna know
(laughing uneasily) Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then
Then what, Tom
Then it don't matter
Then 'll be all aroun' in the dark
'll be ever'where--wherever you look
Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, 'll be there
Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, 'll be there
'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' 'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready
An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, 'll be there too
(slowly) don't understan' it, Tom
(drily) Me neither
(Rising) It's jus' stuff  been thinkin' about
Gimme you han', Ma
Good-by
(He climbs over the fence) Good-by, Tom
Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back
You'll try to fin' us
Sure
Good-by
Good-by, Tommy
He walks away
She stands looking after him
He's leaving her forever--she knows it
She lifts her hand and waves
She tries to smile
turns, waves, smiles
His lips form the words: "Good-by, Ma
" Then he strides away into the darkness
The scene fades out
The   fades in
It stands loaded in front on the Joad tent while Al, Pa, Uncle John, Ma, and the little fellas pile in the last article in a fury of excitement
Beyond, in the background, another jalopy is being prepared for travel with the same feverish haste
It is day
, , (ad lib) Get them buckets on
Somebody tie down the mattress
You little fellas keep outa the way
(from the other truck, gaily) What y'all hurryin' so for
Tell me they got twenny days work
Yes, sir, an' we aim to git in all twenny of 'em
Other jalopies in the background are being readied for leaving-- an excited, hopeful exodus on a new report of work
Ready, Ma
'll get Rosasharn
(beaming) All aboard, ever'body
All aboard for Fresno
Ma comes out of the tent supporting Rosasharn tenderly
For the plumpness has gone from the girl and she is thin again, her face drawn and unhappy, her eyes swollen with weeping and suffering
(softly) Try to be strong, honey
Someday it'll be diff'rent--someday you'll have another one
You're still jus' a little girl, remember
Pa takes Rosasharn's other arm
He and Al and Uncle John help Rosasharn onto the truck
She lies down on the mattress, her face away from them
Make her easy, John
Watch her
She'll be awright
(in the driver's seat) Ready, Pa
(as he and Ma climb in the front seat) Let 'er go, Gallagher
The truck wabbles into motion
Al races the engine
It nearly crashes another wheezing jalopy at the corner
When it turns the corner we see the , and a line of loaded jalopies that ride out to the highway
The caretaker waves and the migrants wave back
Good luck to you
Good luck, ever'body
Good-by, Mr
Conway
Much oblige to you for ever'thing
The Joad truck turns onto the highway
In the   Al is driving, Ma in the middle, Pa on the outside
Twenty days work, oh boy
Be glad to get my han' on some cotton
That's the kin' a pickin' understan'
Maybe
Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work
We ain't got it till we get it
(grinning) Whatsa matter, Ma
Gettin' scared
(smiling faintly) No
Ain't ever gonna be scared no more
(After a pause) was, though
For a while  thought we was beat--*good* an' beat
Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore
It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost
an' nobody cared
Watch me pass that Chevvy
(soberly) You the one that keeps us goin', Ma
ain't no good any more, an'  know it
Seems like  spen' all my time these days a-thinkin' how it use'ta be--thinkin' of home--an'  ain't never gonna see it no more
Ma places her hand on one of Pa's and pats it
Woman can change better'n a man
Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk
With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on
Woman looks at it like that
(at the jalopy ahead) Look at that ol' coffeepot steam
(thinking of what Ma says) Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'
(chuckling) know
Maybe that makes us tough
Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out
But we keep a-comin'
We're the people that live
Can't nobody wipe us out
Can't nobody lick us
We'll go on forever, Pa
We're the people
(She says this with a simple, unaffected conviction) The , steaming and rattling and churning, passes the Chevrolet and Al leans out of the window and waves a jeering hand at it
As the Joad truck pulls in front, we see Ruthie and Winfield laughing with excitement over the triumph
Even Uncle John shares the general satisfaction
Grinning, he waves
As the truck moves away along the road, all three and beaming and waving
Further along the truck passes a sign on the side of the road
It says
The scene fades out
