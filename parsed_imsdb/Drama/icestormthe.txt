href <b>// --> </b> The Ice Storm by James Schamus
Based on the novel by Rick Moody
First Draft Revised January 5, 1996 - Suburban Connecticut, outside of New York City, 1973
The still after a terrible storm
Trees dripping, their branches torn, the air warming just before the break of a new day
The train lies dark and motionless, a few flashing yellow emergency lights up front, as a work crew removes debris from the track
- Various passengers, huddled uncomfortably, cold, asleep
On Paul Hood, 15-and-a-half, stoner-preppie look, hunched up in his seat under the faint emergency exit light
He reads his Fantastic Four comic book by the pale light of the emergency exit sign
Suddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the train's engines returns
The conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic nasal voice
Good morning ladies and gentlemen -- He sounds like a baseball announcer
(mumbling, ad lib) What ladies
-- this train originating at New York's Grand Central Station is back in service - next stop will be New Canaan, Connecticut
New Canaan, Connecticut, next stop
He moves on to the next car
The train begins to move
Paul rubs his elbow against the window and looks out into the still-dark early morning
He looks back down at his comic book
On the comic book: Reed Richards (also known as Stretch) has zapped his young son with a cosmic ray gun to neutralize the destructive energy that Annihilus has implanted in him
The Thing, Medusa, Flame, and Richards' wife Sue Storm look on, stunned
" ' " "' , , " Paul looks up again, thinking
(
) In issue number 141 of The Fantastic Four, published in November 1973, Reed Richards has to use his anti-matter weapon on his own son, who Annihilus has turned into a human atom bomb
His son is the result of Richards' coupling with the earthling Sue Storm, and the problem is that the cosmic rays that infused Richards and the rest of the Fantastic Four on their aborted moon mission have made young Franklin a volatile mixture of matter and anti-matter
- The train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested landscape
(
) And that's what it is to come from a family, if you analyze it closely
Each of them is negative matter for the other ones
And that's what dying is -- dying is when your family, which is in fact your personal negative matter from which you emerge -- it's when the family takes you back, thus hurling you back into negative space
'
On Paul, as the sun breaks over the horizon
His face glows warmly in the yellow light
He looks down idly at the comic book
(
) So it's a paradox -- the closer you're drawn back in, the further into the void you're thrown
The train slowly pulls in
The train doors open, and Paul, weary from the long night, emerges
He sees his family gathered at the other end of the platform -- Ben, 40, a bit worse for wear but still retaining traces of his boyish looks; Elena, 37, distant and elegant even in her oversized sweater; and Wendy, 14, a sullen suburban Lolita
He pauses, regarding them
They stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him
' To establish
typical New England prep school
' Cramped, a mess, but quaint
Paul shares the room with Francis Davenport , a dissolute, smart-ass son of money
Paul's alarm clock rings
He slams his hand down on it and jumps out of bed, fully clothed in his rumpled preppie uniform of frayed khakis, loose tie, shirt with one tail untucked in, etc
Across the room, Francis beckons from his desk, as he finishes loading up a four-foot-high bong
Arise and shine, young Hood
hope you changed the water in that bong from last night
(finishing a hit) The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick
Paul reluctantly walks over and takes a hit
He coughs, spewing uninhaled smoke
(') Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag
(gathering books, papers, almost talking to himself) Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes  do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby
What are you, like still stoned from last night
(spraying some chloroform mouth spray) gotta get to English class
' An English class in progress
Paul Hood sits blankly, hardly listening, until he hears the teacher call out
Libbets
What Dostoyevsky is saying here is that to be a Christian is to choose, because you have to choose of your own choice, but since you can't choose to be good because that would be too rational you have to choose to be bad -- it's existential
Thank you Libbets, that's a very compelling summary, but -- Paul looks at her, smitten
Marge, Paul's friend, notices his look
' As class lets out, Paul accosts Libbets
Um, Libbets
Hey, Dostoyevsky, 'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot
The Idiot
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot
(turning to go) Great, thanks for the tip
(after her) The Idiot
' Paul walks with Marge
'm in love with Libbets Casey
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets
It's beyond mere physical attraction
That's good, because  don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act
Truly
Do speak
My diagnosis is messed in the head
poor little rich girl --  mean check out the jeans and fur look
And lend your ears to this brutality
Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her
How do you know this shit
They did it last year too
It's like traditional or something
They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash
(beat) Aren't the hugely wealthy sad
(pause) You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him
Good thinking Marge
Paul, Francis and friends enter the dark, crowded room
Various kids are awkwardly dancing to some progressive fm style undanceable rock (Jethro Tull, etc
) Francis hands Paul the tail end of a joint, but Paul waves it away
No more man
'm about to drop as it is
See ya
Where you going
Paul, let me enlighten you about something
You and  exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other
'm off to get laid
See you
Flame on, asshole
And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned
He waves his fingers toward Paul's eyes, in the classic "stoned" gesture, then wanders off
Paul looks on at the gathering
Marge waves to him from the dance floor
: ' Paul wanders, stoned, through the party
He sees Libbets from across the room
She seems to be surrounded by friends
' Paul has cornered Libbets and is talking over the music
There are just a few people left, most of them making out with each other
(stoned) -- because 've been reading Kerouac and Ginsberg and those guys were creating beat culture and traveling and sleeping wherever, and, of course, with all kinds of people, but when you read carefully the various contemporary accounts of their lives, and, uh, these guys didn't bathe much,  mean they were really filthy, with like genital crabs, lice, exceptionally strong body odor
Libbets smiles through her yawn
Paul sits alone on the bench, freezing cold, eating a donut
Some kids from across the lawn yell good-night to him
Paul is at his desk
Francis enters, wrapped in a towel, fresh from the shower
How can you do that man
Do what
Sleep all day
mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up
(beat) Um, Libbets Casey
What
Aha
could sense the vibe
What do you mean
Am  right or am  right
Shit
You're not planning -- My man,  speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid
've been giving this one a lot of thought, and believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that -- knock at the door
(
) Hood, telephone
Paul rolls off his bed, opens the door
Don't mess with Libbets
mean it
Paul walks to the pay phone at the end of the hall
Hello
- It's a modern (shag carpet, geometric-patterned wallpaper, etc
) suburban house
Ben Hood talks on the phone, a drink in his hand
Paul
In the background, we can see Wendy watching Richard Nixon on Hi dad
Hey guy
Things ok up there
You all right
'm fine dad
Well good
Just confirming
You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon
Well dad, actually  thought 'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments -- Lab experiments
Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, think you should
: (on , from San Clemente press conference) Well, with regard to the questions as to why Americans feel we were wrong to make the tapes, that is not particularly surprising think that most Americans do not like the idea of taping conversations and, frankly, it is not something that particularly appeals to me
Hold on for a second
(turning) Wendy, you want-to say hi to your brother
She frowns
(') Come on
She gets up sullenly and goes to the phone
Charles
Charles
Have you been keeping out of my shit
Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room
have not touched your sh-- (looks at father) Stuff
You watching this
Watching what
Nixon, doofus
It's incredible
He should be shot
(overhearing) Hey, that's the president of the goddam United States you're talking about, Wendy
From the kitchen, Elena overhears
She's dressed to go out, but in the process of making a Kraft macaroni and cheese dinner for Wendy
He's a liar
(still talking more to her father than into the phone) Dean told him on March 21st about Kalmback and Hunt, all about the payoffs to the Watergate burglars, so you tell me where the so-called "Dean Report" is, but you can't because it doesn't exist, because he lied about Haldeman and Erlichman and the April 17 tape, that's why
Liar
Ben retreats, going to the wet bar to pour another drink
(muttering) , , the defense rests
(to Elena in the kitchen) Want another
(
) No thank you
We should be off
Gotcha
He puts the bottle back down without pouring
: (on the phone) Hey Charles
Charles, calm down -- wasn't in on it
Elena, putting on her coat, comes into the den and gives Wendy a kiss on the forehead as Wendy mumbles her good-byes to Paul on the phone
Dinner's on the counter
We'll be at the Williams's -- you know the number
(takes the phone from Wendy) Paul
Hi
Is there anything you'll want, any particular kind of food or snack or anything we can stock up on
You're all right
See you next week
love you
Back to Nixon on the
We must recognize that one excess begets another, and that the extremes of violence in the 1960s contributed to the extremes of Watergate
On Wendy as she regards the , hearing her parents' farewells as they leave through the front door
large New England Colonial, with a few modern additions and touches
We hear the sound of dinner chatter
The kitchen door swings open into the dining room, and Mikey and Sandy Williams emerge, each holding platters of food
Mikey, 15-and-a-half, lost in space, and Sandy, 14, a sullen and barely pubescent boy, each have towels draped over their forearms -- they are the evening's "waiters"
They move unsteadily to the table, at which sit their parents Janey (38, a hard-edged, sharp-witted beauty) and Jim (43, large and a bit goofy, a genius inventor), together with their guests, Ben and Elena Hood, and neighbors Dorothy and Ted Franklin
We jump cut through the evening's conversations, seen mostly from the furtive 's of the boys
His brother came back -- From where
Vietnam
Oh
Are we going to talk about this, about
You should hear
It's very sad, he was -- : Janey is whispering something into Mikey's ear, who returns to the kitchen
It was a benefit for the  or something, and Harry Reems himself was there -- The man with the -- from Deep Throat
The very one -- something about a first amendment defense fund -- well  believe in it -- Ted took me to see it
Ted, how romantic
have to say, the movie didn't do much for me
But being in that theater, surrounded by all those horny young college boys and perverts, there was something in the air that -- : The boys are pouring wine
-- pulls right up to the pump, jumps out like there's no gas shortage, oblivious, and by this point everybody in line's piling out of their cars ready to kill the guy, when they notice it's that Reverend Edwards -- The Unitarian
The new one
Yeah -- claims he pulled off Creek Road and didn't notice the line going back Mill Street for half a mile
He's either got his head in the clouds or up his -- hear he's slept with half the women in his congregation -- Lucky bastard
As this is said, Mikey accidentally spills some wine on Ben
Hell
--  mean, no problemo there Mikey
Here,  -- Janey leans over with her napkin and attempts a cursory wipe of Ben's pants
Is there a just barely noticeable frisson between Ben and Janey as she removes the napkin
If there is, Elena doesn't -- or pretends not to -- notice
: The boys, now in pajamas (Sandy's with padded feet, Mikey's a combination of t-shirt and pj bottoms) are bringing out coffee and dessert
The adults eye Mikey's handling of the coffee pot with some nervousness
(unconvincing) So fascinating
Do you get free tickets to the movies, that kind of thing
No, my job is just to analyze the entertainment stocks and advise our institutional investors on where to put their money
It's -- Don't be so modest, Ben
It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends
You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit -- (with a bit too much conviction) And as usual no one believed me
Silence
: The dinner party has moved to the living room for after dinner drinks
Elena remains behind to help Janey pick up the table
She stacks a plate on top of another
Please don't
It's not a bother
insist
(beat) Don't touch them
Elena realizes that there's an edge to Janey's voice
Oh
(realizing she's gone too far) It's really quite all right
Of course
The party progresses
Mikey and Sandy are lying on their stomachs at the top of the stairs, out of sight
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things
key party
You know, it's a California thing
That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in
you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got
Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California
Irwin is devastated
It's so ironic
Ironic
(caught out) Well, um, yes
Ironic
His name is Rod
The guests are leaving
The men shake hands, the women kiss, and the men and women awkwardly peck each others' cheeks
Thank you Janey
It was lovely
Hey Jim, next time you've got to fill me in on whatever it is you're up to these days
Will do
At the top of the stairs, a rather dejected Sandy and Mikey finish spying on the leave-takings below
Mikey nudges Sandy, and they silently head back the upstairs hall
' They enter Mike's room -- the door has a "nuclear waste positively no admittance" sign on it
As Mikey reaches his bed, he doubles over, groaning, and starts to make retching noises
He then throws himself onto the bed, his head leaning over the far side
Sandy walks over and sees a pile of vomit next to the bed
Taken aback for a moment, he then reaches forward and picks it up -- it's fake plastic vomit
He throws it on top of Mike's back, but Mikey doesn't take notice
Stupid
(pause, looking sullenly at Mike's back) Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend
(not looking up, but alarmed) Who said so
No one
don't have a girlfriend
Mikey returns to his reading -- a copy of The Sensuous Woman, obviously well pawed over
He absentmindedly picks his nose
As he flips the pages, a beautiful, almost electrical begins to fill his ears
He frowns and pauses to listen to it
Sandy, who has picked up a balsa wood miniature plane, obviously doesn't hear it
Mikey focuses on the plane as Sandy waves it through the air
Perhaps the hum is the sound of its engines as it soars through the sky
' There is a large poster of a cartoon version of Richard Nixon "Tricky Dick" -- on her wall
Wendy is on the phone to her friend Beth
-- he knows that when the March 24th tape -- you know with Dean, where Dean tells him that there's a cancer growing on the presidency -- She pauses as Beth asks a question
(') Who
No way
He's like a big infected whitehead wearing jeans wouldn't -- She hears the downstairs door open
(') (whispering) -- shit, it's my parents
She turns her light out
Ben and Elena walking past Wendy's room to their bedroom
You'd think she'd learn how to cook a chicken, eh
My drumstick was still frozen when you cut inside there
'm probably going to get whatever that disease -- and Jim, how that guy ever became a millionaire -- He pauses before a hall table, and, with his eyes, traces the telephone cord under Wendy's room
(') Hmm
knew she'd still be up
Watch this -- But Elena simply continues into the master bedroom
He starts to pull gently on the cord
And continues pulling
No response for a few seconds
Then: : 25 (
) (yelling behind her door) Dad stop it
Get to sleep young lady -- and mean it
Wendy opens the door to her room
Fascist
If  were a fascist  would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago
Now get to bed
She slams the door
He opens it
' Ben enters the room, angry
Hey
Wendy jumps into bed and under the covers, pulling them up over her head
He stands over her, looking down at the crumpled pile of sheet and blanket
(') (softening) Hey, kiddo
Sleep well, huh
He places his hand where her cheek should be, and caresses the sheet
(without pulling the sheet down, but nicely) Good-night dad
Good night kiddo
Ben turns to the door, where he sees a silent Elena standing in her nightgown, a slight smile on her face
Elena is sitting cross-legged, eyes closed, on her side of the bed
We hear the toilet flush from the master bath, and see Ben emerge in his boxers
He pauses in front of the bed, looking at Elena
(without opening her eyes) You're staring at me
wasn't star-- 've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy
was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr
Woolens
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see
thought you dropped him
did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her
You think she's ok
Why shouldn't she be
Elena just gives him a look, more sad than angry
(') (pause) Then again, why should she be mean with us, with our
So maybe you'll come too
Oh not again Elena
If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them
It's you Ben who needs to talk
've had my say, and 'm waiting to hear back from you
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "'m
You're " stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself
've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and -- -- And you haven't moved out yet
It's because you're too lazy, Ben
Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision -- Elena
Silence
(sighing) Sleep in the study
Please
Ben picks up a pillow and walks out, pausing wistfully at the door
Good night
Good night
' Wendy hears her parents' door close and sees a strip of light illuminate under her door as the hall light goes on, then off
nondescript, cleanly "modern" building
Engraved on the doors: "Shackley and Schwimmer, Securities Brokerage - Established 1964" Ben, seated, is finishing a brief presentation to a small group of men, which includes George Clair, mid-thirties, unctuously handsome
But what, exactly, is stagflation, this mixture of inflation and stagnation, and how should we in the securities industry understand and accommodate it
Well -- and hope 'm not out of bounds here - think of the money supply as a large male organ, continuously inflating, and yet, the societal vaginal cavity simply wants more
As the vicious circle of higher returns without real satisfaction continues, the money-organ may seem to be in demand, but in fact even the most inflated capital is unwanted
This is why  suggest that while we engage this mawing abyss for the highest returns, we at the same time fantasize, so to speak, of the safe harbor of capital appreciation
The aging boss nods agreement
(more or less mumbling) Brilliant, brilliant
George Clair just grins
' Ben is gathering papers, readying to leave
He looks up to see George Clair in his doorway
Hey there Benjie, you're becoming quite the in-house philosopher
When do you have time to think up all that stuff -- Shackley sure eats it up
' As we see that Clair is deftly fondling Hood's attractive secretary as she is seated in the cubicle beside the door to his office
She looks up coyly at Clair, hidden for the moment from Ben's view
Ben comes out of his office, pulling his coat on
Clair and the secretary pull back, but it's clear that Ben has some sense of what's transpiring between them
George, 'm just trying to get a global view of things -- can't just look at the small picture
There's an obvious rivalry between the two of them
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr
Shackley was asking about
Gotcha George, not a problem
Tomorrow
Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself
Ben you know that's your territory - and  wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert
Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called
The Exorcist
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway
'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there
It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top
Brilliant
Hey, you heading out a little early today
Got a meeting uptown
(already moving off) Right o'
Up the organization
(then, to himself) Bastard
The secretary pretends not to hear
An august New York institution
To establish
stuffy, Ivy League atmosphere
decades-old tradition of serving overcooked American food
Ben is seated across from his father, Harold Hood, a retired curmudgeon
There is a walker parked by Harold's chair
(waylaying a passing waiter) 'd asked for that double martini about three hours ago
Coming right up, sir
So asking me out for lunch -- what prompted this exceptional event
-- Of course 'm paying
We don't have to always go to your club, dad
And why are you still calling me dad
You're forty years old already, and -- -- Well what am  supposed to call you
That's besides the point
The martini arrives, along with Ben's beer
was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know -- Advice
'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben
Unless - have you quit your job
They fired you
You know, dah-- He looks up and sees his father slurping his martini, not paying attention
(') Actually it's not about work, it's advice about -- Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now -- Well, Elena and  have kind of been talking, not really talking, but -- -- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce -  assume you're talking here about divorce
The very thought -- But dad, you guys truly hated each other,  mean really hated each -- -- Waiter
Where's my cobb salad
(back to Ben) You want advice Ben
If your big brother were still alive 'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head
Look kid, you married that woman against my advice -- -- What advice
You never -- That's besides the point
The point is if 'd had any sense in me 'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 -- -- 73 -- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with
would have if 'd had the chance
Ben ponders, as the food arrives
(weakly) But
But what
But  -- well maybe  love her
Elena
His father rolls his eyes and stabs his salad with a fork
Christ Ben
Make up your mind and eat your lunch
Elena browses the self-help section
longish-haired, slightly gone-to-seed, but still handsome clergyman pauses next to her
He's wearing an ecclesiastical collar and bell bottoms
He pulls out a copy of Me, Myself and , glancing again at Elena
Elena
Elena Hood, am  right
Yes
Reverend Edwards
Philip Edwards
You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year
Yes, it was --  ended up -- (smiling) No need to make excuses -- cool gray afternoon
group of boys are playing flag football on the field, while two groups of girls are gathered underneath the bleachers at either end, warily smoking c1garettes
Wendy, Beth, and a couple of other girls are gathered in one group
(referring to one of the girls gathered in the other group) She said you licked Dave Brewster's weenie in the third floor bathroom
She's a liar
wouldn't touch Dave Brewster's dick if you paid me
It's probably crawling with v
d
after he put it in her, which he did
The conversation peters out at this point, as the two groups of girls give each other the hairy eyeball from afar
Wendy looks through from beneath the bleacher seats onto the field where the boys are playing
group of boys break from a huddle, Mikey among them
The quarterback takes the hike and Mikey runs out for a pass
As he runs, his breathing increases in volume, filling his ears, and transforming into the humming sound he'd heard before
The quarterback spots him and throws a long one
He runs in an oblivion of beautiful white sound
The ball drops next to him as he continues, in a world of his own, to run
Suddenly, the humming ends and he stops and turns around, to see all the other kids just standing there looking at him
One of them makes a pot-smoking gesture, as if that's the explanation
(as he returns to the group, ball in hand) Did anybody hear that
The other kids snicker
Wendy looks on, and catches Mikey's eye for a fleeting moment
gotta go
She takes hold of her bicycle and pushes off
Elena and Philip are seated at a booth
It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers -- suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- 've never been much of a joiner, although still consider myself a somewhat religious person -- Well  of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course 've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples -- Elena looks outside the window, and sees Wendy speed past on her bicycle
(cutting him off) My daughter
haven't been on a bike for years
(still not really looking at him) When was the last time you rode a bike
(a bit taken aback by the abrupt topic change) They say you never forget
(jarred back to his presence) Forget what
Forget how to ride a bike
Silence
No, of course you don't, you're right
Wendy pulls her bike up to the back, locks it, and walks in
Wendy moves with a certain amount of stealth through the aisles, arriving at the candy selection
She looks around
She takes a package of twinkies and slips them into the oversized pockets of her painter's pants
She turns around, and her breath goes out of her -- an has been watching her shoplift
The woman looks sadly at her, but says nothing
Wendy slowly walks past her and out the back door of the store
The woman looks on
As she walks her bike onto the sidewalk, Wendy comes across Sandy
Hey Wendy
Hey Sandy
Mikey was looking for you
Yeah
See ya
She pushes off on her bike
Sandy gazes after her
He takes his
Joe out of his coat pocket, and points it at her
Bam
Wendy flies along on her bike
It's a desolately beautiful fall day
Wendy rides by the front gates of the posh grounds of the private psychiatric clinic
security guard leans against a booth
Once a bit past the gate, she gets off her bike and walks it into a grove of trees near the front drive
Mikey is waiting amid the trees next to his bike as Wendy arrives
Want some gum
Sure
(pulling them out of her pocket) Twinkie
(opens his mouth, displaying the gum on his tongue) 'm chewing
She puts the Twinkies back, and pops the gum in her mouth
They stand together chewing
(after a pause) Did you tell Sandy
Tell Sandy
What
Wendy doesn't say anything
(') You didn't tell him either, did you
The wind is picking up and the light is fading
Mikey and Wendy climb the fence around the pool, which is empty and half-covered in dead leaves and twigs
They climb down into the concrete recess and walk into the deep end, leaning against the far wall of the pool
They each matter-of-factly take their gum out and put it behind their ears
They begin not so much to kiss as to place their tongues in each others' mouths
We see them from high above the pool, as the dead leaves swirl lightly around them, Mikey groping under Wendy's poncho
To establish
couple are in the final throes of lovemaking
We see Janey Williams's face, more or less enjoying the proceedings
The man gives a final heave and groan, and rolls off to reveal himself to be -- Ben Hood
: Janey smokes a cigarette
Ben is babbling
We were golfing, and you know, golfing to me is something 'm supposed to enjoy, and  was on the goddam golf team in college, so it's something one would assume do well --  used to do well -- but basically these days golfing for me is like hoeing, or plowing
Janey smiles briefly at this
(') It's like farming
am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course
And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department -- Ben-- Yeah
(gently) You're boring me
have a husband
don't particularly feel the need for another
You have a point there
That's a very good point
We're having an affair
Right
An explicitly sexual relationship
Your needs
My needs
You're absolutely right
You should probably get dressed
The boys will be home soon
Gotcha
She wraps a blanket around herself and gets up
Ben cautiously walks out he back door and heads for the side gate
Wendy enters the house as Elena is finishing supper preparations
Hi mom
Hi Wendy
Without waiting for instructions, Wendy starts pulling out plates and silverware and setting the table
(') saw you on your bike today
With Mikey
Who
Nobody
Mikey Williams
We were just riding around
Elena takes this in
Well, you looked very -- free -- when  saw you
Wendy continues setting the table
(') Weightless almost -- as if  were seeing my own memories of being a girl
There was something internal about it
Mom
Are you ok
Wendy, of course
'm sorry
You must think 'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows
You're not a psycho
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos
know
They're rich drug addicts and celebrities
When  saw James Taylor there, and -- We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston
Well,  saw what  saw, and if you don't want to believe me -- Oh Wendy
Wendy frowns
They need the money for my band uniform at school
thought you quit the band - never hear you practice anymore
don't really need to practice just play a few notes, you know, so thought maybe 'd stay in
Well, 'm sure your father and would love to hear what you're playing these days
Maybe after dinner
Ben and Elena take their seats on the sofa
Wendy stands before them holding an enormous trombone, with a music stand and sheet music in front of her
She puffs a series of seemingly disconnected notes in waltz time
When she's done, she looks up from the sheet music to her parents
They applaud
Can't wait to see how it fits in with all the other instruments
Elena gives him a look
Elena is sorting through bills and writing checks at the kitchen table
Ben comes in and fills a glass with ice
The Halfords have invited us again this year
You want to go
What do you think
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition
He comes up behind her, looks down at the checkbook
(') 'm, uh, going to bed
So early
Rough day
Good night
He leans over and kisses her on the cheek
She sniffs
Is that a new aftershave
He recoils a bit
Oh yeah
Musk, or something
You like it
Hmm
Good night
He walks uncertainly from the room
Does she suspect
' Mikey is painfully at work writing an English essay
Sandy comes to the door with a geometry textbook
Mikey
Yeah
Geometry
Sure, anything but this English
Sandy puts the open textbook in front of him
Why are you so good at math but not in English
'm not good at math
Just geometry
He looks at the book
(') (drawing out his examples on a piece of paper) It's like, you know when they say "two squared"
And you think it means 2 times 2, equals 4
But really they really mean a square square with a side of two
And the area of the square is four
Like every time you use the word, like squared, or cubed, it's really space, it's not numbers, it's space
And it's perfect space, but only in your head, because you can't draw a perfect square, like in the material world, but in your mind, you can have perfect space
(pause) You know
As Mikey goes on, we see his geometric doodles, and hear faintly the   under his voice
Yeah
But  just need some help with my homework
knock at the door
Jim stands in the doorway with a suitcase in his hand
Hey guys, 'm back
(honestly confused) You were gone
Sandy looks at Mikey as if pondering a lost cause
(a look of disappointment) Yeah Mikey
Yep,  was in Houston, working on some great new ideas about silicon, which comes from sand, very conductive
How you guys doing
How's school
Mikey's still flustered
Uh,  dunno
guess
Hmm
Alright
He walks off
You really didn't notice
Man, he's been gone for three days
Janey is reading, still dressed, on the bed
She nods to Jim as he enters with his suitcase
Good trip
He nods and puts his suitcase down, then sits heavily on the side of the bed
(as he sits) You bet
It turns out it's a water bed, and his weight creates a wave that nearly pushes Janey off her edge of the bed
Jesus, Jim
(jumping up, which only creates another wave) Sorry honey
Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed
Just be careful
(as he begins to unpack) You notice anything with Mikey lately
The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh
Tonight
Jim, he's been out of it since he was born
Hell,  guess he takes after me, huh
He laughs to himself
She gives him a look
Elena and Philip Edwards are having coffee again
In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all
It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology
You're saying that Christ is the child, and -- -- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in
You ask what the point is
That's right
Self-realization
Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential
Would you believe me if told you  want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization
would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling
mean
(flustered) My,  sound a bit -- 'm sorry
That was stupid of me didn't mean to be so rude
You weren't
You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself
But not too ashamed
(smiling) Now you are being rude
And you're still trying to get me into bed
Ouch
Just then, Dorothy Franklin passes by their table, a smirk firmly implanted on her face
Hello you two
Am  barging in on some kind of religious study group
Elena, you look marvelous
Will see you and Ben at the Halford's
suppose we'll make an appearance
And Reverend Edwards
Did you make the list
(laughing) believe so Mrs
Franklin
With the two of you there it will be positively a revival
'm off
She scurries out of the coffee shop
'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she
(gathering her things to go) 'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about
(getting up) Take care
That  will indeed
Mikey is reading his English paper before the class
Because of molecules we are connected to the outside world from our bodies
Like when you smell things, because when you smell a smell it's not really a smell, it's a part of the object that has come off of it -- molecules
So when you smell something bad, it's like in a way you're eating it
This is why you should not really smell things, in the same way that you don't eat everything in the world around you - because as a smell, it gets inside of you
So the next time you go into the bathroom after someone else has been there, remember what kinds of molecules you are in fact eating
An embarrassed silence
Band practice
The New Canaan High School band is doing a wind version of a popular rock tune
In front, there's Wendy, in halter top and hip-hugging bell bottoms, incongruously blowing away on her trombone -- this being her one stab at extracurricular activities
In the flute section directly behind her is Sandy, piping away on a tiny piccolo
He sits on a riser slightly elevated above her
He directs downward at Wendy a protracted regard, a look of intense concentration on his face
' : Wendy's backside, her pants pushed outward in the back, affording Sandy a libido-charged view of the top of her bum crack
Push in on a close-up of this cherished abstract landscape, then back to Sandy's furrowed face
Ben and Harold are at their table again
Lunch is being cleared
It's not the taxes  object to
It's all the fines and penalties
Alright dad
But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the , and 'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff -- It was all junk
Another pause
Ben decides not to pursue an overworked topic
Oh
Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving
It's just going to be you this year
Ben, 'm going to Florida
hate Thanksgiving and  hate the cold have a new nurse
She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and 've decided to leave my entire estate to her
Ben spits his drink out
What
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever
That was a joke
You don't tell jokes
thought 'd start trying
If you don't mind
But  am going to Florida and  do have a new nurse
Ben sits in the moving train, commuting home
He puts down his paper to look at this fellow passengers
[: He is in the same seat as was Paul at the beginning of the film
] Elena sits in a yoga pose
Elena enters the garage from the kitchen and turns the light on
She finds an old bicycle and pulls it out
Elena rides her bike into town, infused with the girlish sense of freedom she imagined for her daughter
Suddenly, there's a pop -- a tire is blown out
She slows down and gets off the bike
As she bends to look at the wheel, a station wagon slows near her
The driver's side window rolls open
It's Janey Williams
Need a lift
' Elena sits in the passenger seat
The two women are obviously uncomfortable with each other
Silence
Thanks again
For the dinner
Thanks for eating it
don't know why  even pretend  can cook
used to know how to cook
It's not like we're too busy
They smile, barely
'm thinking of going back to school
Social work
How'd you know
Educated guess
'm that predictable
No, you don't have to answer that
It's just that with the kids almost grown -- You don't have to apologize
'm too much of a cynic
You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me
She pulls the car over
Janey's car pulls to the curb
' Here you are
(opening her door) Thanks for the lift
If the bike's any bother-- None at all
'll leave it in front of your garage
Happy Thanksgiving
' Elena watches the car pull away
She turns and walks into the store
Elena moves through the aisles, putting various sundries into a basket
She pauses in front of the lipsticks
She picks up a lipstick, looks at it, then quietly places it in her pocket
We see her reflection in the security mirror above the aisle, as she quickly exits the store
The middle-aged lady behind the counter watches her leave
In a wide shot, from across the street, we see Elena leave the store, followed by the shopkeeper who runs behind her and taps her on the shoulder
They converse for a minute, and Elena is accompanied back into the store
Through the store windows we see her take the lipstick out of her purse
She's obviously distraught -- offering to pay, talking quickly, etc
The shopkeeper is holding a telephone, not yet decided on whether to call her in

"    , " " ' " Paul sits reading on his way home
Janey pulls up in the driveway
As she gets out of the car, she hears a small explosion from the back of the house
Janey comes around the back to discover Sandy stuffing a model airplane with m-80 firecrackers
He lights them and runs back a safe distance
The plane explodes, its wreckage joining the debris from a few other dolls, models, and toys
Sandy
Sandy looks up -- busted
Janey marches over to him
(') You little idiotic prick, you could blow yourself fucking sky high with all this demented crap
Sandy looks on the verge of tears
She softens and bends down to him
(') (sighing) Hey
(picking up the firecrackers) 'll take this stuff
You going to tell dad
Would it matter
(sees something else lying on the ground) And what's that
(sniffling) You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico
It's not packed with explosives, is it
No
(going into the house) Play with the whip
Mikey and Wendy are in front of the , watching a rerun of Divorce Court
Oh
Hi Wendy
Hi Mrs
Williams
Mikey, have you heard the explosions coming from the backyard
(he stares blankly at her) Do you know what Sandy's been up to
(honestly oblivious, as usual) dunno
She pauses, then walks into the kitchen
Sandy flicks his enormous whip in the direction of a small bush
One by one, he snaps off its leaves
Janey hauls a turkey out of a bag and into the fridge
Mikey and Wendy are still in front of the
Janey comes in again and looks at them
Don't you kids have homework
(without looking up, in unison) Thanksgiving break
She walks out of the room again
Sandy comes in, whip in hand, looks over at Mikey and Wendy, then walks over to them, and, without a word, slumps down beside them and watches the
Elena walks unsteadily, pausing to rest against a brick wall
She takes a deep breath, then walks to a corner where a local taxi station wagon sits idling
She gestures to the driver, who beckons her in
Later, still mentally devolving in front of the , but with various junk food detritus surrounding them and a different show, a rerun of the original Highway Patrol
Sandy wanders off
: Later
Wendy gets up, goes upstairs, and wanders down the hall to the bathroom
She gets to the door just as Sandy gets there from the opposite direction
After you
Sandy hesitantly opens the door, as Wendy still hovers by it
Well, you can
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there
Your mom was pretty p
o
'd
All my model planes
The ones you built
They were old
And they couldn't fly anyhow
'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then 'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs
Burgess's English class and blow it up
have to go to the bathroom
Yeah
But he stays put, unaware it seems that he's blocking the doorway
Wendy looks around -- no one in sight
'll show you mine if you show me yours
Sandy goes wide eyed, and almost against his will backs into the bathroom like a feather
Mikey looks up from the , wondering where Wendy is
He eats another Pringle
Wendy flips up her dress for Sandy
He slowly unzips, his hand unsteady
We can tell from the look on Wendy's face that she's feeling a bit sorry for the little guy
Suddenly Sandy turns beet red, and bursts into tears
What do you want
What do you want
Get out
Get out of here
The door flips open -- and Janey Williams appears
(sizing up the situation) Shit
Janey is giving Wendy a lecture person's body is his temple, Wendy
This body is your first and last possession
Now as your own parents have probably told you, in adolescence our bodies tend to betray us
That's why, in Samoa and in other developing nations, adolescents are sent out into the woods, unarmed, and they don't come back until they've learned a thing or two
Wendy is led to the door by Mrs
Williams
Wendy trades a glance with a sullen Mikey, who sits in the living room pretending to ignore her
Wendy walks her bike with the wind in her face
From behind her, Mikey rides up on his bike and rides alongside her
She doesn't look at him
Trying to stay on his bike, but moving slowly, he wobbles, nearly falling off
don't ever want to see you
Then why'd you come after me
The taxi pulls up
Elena gets out and pays the driver
Ben is in front of the open freezer, trying to get something out
He hears Elena come in the front door
Elena
need some help here if this thing's gonna defrost by tomorrow
She comes up and together they tug and pull until they succeced in extracting a large, frozen turkey
As they pull it out, it slips from their hands and, after a dull thump, slides along the floor
They smile
Elena bends over to pick it up
Ben observes her
She notices his look
(') Here
He goes over and picks up the turkey, placing it in the sink
He looks back at her and notices her vaguely distraught look
(') You all right there
Oh
Sure,  -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce
Um, yes
They stand together, his concern and her vulnerability forming an awkward attraction between them
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches
do
'm -- are you
think  am
(pause) You know Elena, 've been thinking-- Ben, maybe no talking right now
If you start talking, you're going to-- She kisses him as if she needed him
Ben and Elena enter their bedroom
Elena closes the door quietly behind her
Ben and Elena undress shyly
They make love
Elena's face is almost fearful
: Elena and Ben lie in bed side by side in the pale afternoon light
Neither speaks
Ben turns on his side, and notices a small tear forming in Elena's eyes
You crying
'm just sad Ben --  mean it was
you were, but, you know just don't know
(gently making light) Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating
thought it was -- No,  didn't mean to sound negative
It was -- But Ben
(beat) What is going to happen with us
Have you -- You have to bring this up now
What
Did  do something here
Is that it
Is it something  did
wasn't accusing you, Ben
It's just that we've got to be honest
Not just with ourselves, but with the children
(pause, sitting up) Hell,  know
--  guess if you want to accuse me, you've got -- (looks at watch) Oh hell
've got to pick up Paul
almost forgot
He gets up and starts to get dressed
You were saying
He smells the armpits of the shirt he's putting on
Yikes --  was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday
That shirt
What
Leave it -- 'll wash it for you
He looks at her ruefully
Wendy walks and Mikey rides along
You have to follow me
dunno
-- They're now in front of the Hood's house
Ben exits the house in a rush, and sees Wendy and Mikey on the street in front
Hey there Mikey, how's business
: 85 (tripping off of his bike) Business
Uh,  dunno
Ben grimaces, fiddles for his car keys
As Mikey remounts and rides off, Wendy passes her father on the driveway
'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come
Nah
What you been up to
Nothing
Wendy enters the house and climbs the stairs
She sees the crumpled bed sheets in her parents' room and hears Elena in the shower
Paul walks to the parking lot with his father, who carries his duffel bag
Ben's car heading back to the house with Paul
So how's school treating you
All right
Classes
Good
Grades
Fine
Anyone special
You know
Hnnn
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St
Peter's, it's top of the line, eh
Yeah
You know Paul, 've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about -- well -- He makes a sharp turn
Paul puts his arms up on the dashboard to steady himself
(nervous) About
Well, the whole gamut
Facts of life and all
Some fatherly advice, because,  tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough
well
(pause) For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother -- He pauses to gauge the effect of his monologue on his son, then continues
Uh, Dad -- Just then Ben runs a stop sign and almost slams into another car
Holy
Well
If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up
Uh, dad, you know 'm 16
All the more reason for this little heart to heart
great
The car pulls up
Paul gets out, looking shell-shocked
He sees Wendy waving to him from a second floor window
He nods back
Um, Paul
On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend never said any of that
Sure dad
Thanks
In the doorway, Elena waits
Paul knocks on Wendy's bedroom door
She opens it
Hello, Charles
Greetings, Charles
' Paul and Wendy sit on the floor
How are the parental units functioning these days
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much
don't know
Dad seems a little weird
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth
They both ponder silently
Then: May  operate your telephonic apparatus
Why don't you use the phone downstairs
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York
Confirming a social outing for Friday night
Can  come
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing
With who
Her name's Libbets
Libbets
What kind of a name is Libbets
Morning
To establish
Elena is coming out of the master bathroom in a robe, a towel wrapped around her head
The turkey in
Stuffed and baking
Ben Hood pads down the hall in his bathrobe, tries the bathroom door
It's locked
Anyone home
The shower is running, but Paul is standing by the open window, puffing on a joint and trying to blow the smoke outside
'll be out in a second
Ben walks back to the bedroom, smirking
Sure you will
One by one, each member of the Hood carried in a final item to place on the overstuffed Thanksgiving table
Then, one by one, they each silently take their seats
They look over the table
No one moves
Well, it's great we can all be together
And this Thanksgiving, no hysteria, no yelling, especially with grandpa not here, although we miss him
So let's do it right and actually, Wendy, why don't you say grace
You used to love to say grace, remember
Wendy grimaces, as they all bow their heads slightly
Dear Lord, thank you for Thanksgiving, and for letting us white people kill all the Indians
Everyone looks up
(') and steal their tribal lands and stuff ourselves like pigs Mutterings and groans: "Wendy
" "For Christ's sake" etc
(') while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and -- Jesus all right enough
They all unceremoniously start to dig in
: Janey Williams is pouring Benjamin Hood a drink from a bottle of vodka
Benjamin is already unbuttoned and shoeless; Janey still fully dressed
Here
After the Thanksgiving  had, need it
You having one
In a bit
She sits next to him, he kisses the back of her neck
You know,  think Elena might suspect something
Janey gives him a rather contemptuous look
(') (thinking aloud) Maybe it's all for the better, you know
Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything
has she acted funny to you,  mean, have you noticed anything
(almost ironic) Have  noticed anything
'm not married to her Benjamin, you are think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her
Yeah, but,  -- 've been working a lot lately, and -- No, that's not it
guess we've just been on the verge of saying something, whatever it is, just saying something to each other
On the verge
Janey gets up
'll be back
Benjamin looks at her quizzically
Huh
Birth control
Right
Gotcha
She leaves the room
He leans back onto the bed
Sits back up
Takes a sip of vodka
Puts the glass down
Takes his socks off
He's now in just his jockey shorts and shirt
Faintly, he hears a door close
The front door
He takes another sip
He hears another sound
(') Janey
Nothing
He goes to the door and carefully opens it
(') (quietly) Janey
He hears, quite audibly, a car door open, close, Janey's car start and pull out
He runs to a front window just in time to catch a glimpse of her driving off
(') Shit
Benjamin sits on the guest bed, still in his underwear, drinking from the bottle
He gets up and starts to wander around the house, still holding the bottle
' Benjamin saunters through
He presses on the king-sized bed -- it undulates
Water bed
Dig it
He wiggles comically, making more waves
: Ben idly goes through Janey's drawers
' He rifles through the bathroom cabinet, checking out the medicines
' He notices a garter belt hanging from the walk-in closet door
He picks it up and twirls it
'
' Benjamin walks in, an obvious look of distaste
He sorts through a few of Mike's things -- monster eyes that glow in the dark, The Sensuous Woman, etc
He twirls the garter belt absentmindedly, then tosses it into the back of Mike's closet
' He finishes putting his clothes back on
As he reaches for the door, he hears voices and quickly steps back in again
Teenage voices
Mikey and Wendy
(
) See, no one's here
Maybe you want to go to the basement
(
) Maybe we can just watch some
(
) There's a  in the basement
Hood hears their steps down into the basement
Wendy and Mikey stand in the middle of the semi-lit basement
Maybe we can mess around
You know, only if you want to
don't know
Why did you -- with Sandy
don't know
You like him
He worships you
But Wendy doesn't seem to hear -- she's drawn to an object lying next to a bean bag chair off to one side
Hey, what's this
With a look of utter fascination, she picks up a Nixon mask, looking at it as though it were an archeological find
(') Wow
Wendy
She puts the mask on
(from behind the mask) won't take my pants off
But 'll touch it
That's as far as it goes
Mikey looks totally confused
Remaining fully clothed, Wendy loosens Mike's belt, showing no excitement from behind her mask, and lets him climb on top of her for a dry hump
Just then, a shaft of light hits them from the top of the stairs -- Ben towers above them, looking down
Mikey flips over immediately and pulls his clothes together, grabbing a  Guide as Wendy stands up, the mask still on
As Ben descends Mikey, still stuffing his shirt-tail into his pants, pretends to flip through the  Guide
(muttering) When worlds collide
Huh
4:30 movie
When Worlds Collide
Ben arrives, folds his arms
What the hell are you kids doing down here
What do you think we're doing, dad
What do  think
think you're probably touching each other think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and think he's trying to get into your slacks
think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood -- Hey, hang on there, Mr
Hood -- Don't you direct a single word at me, Mikey
don't want to hear it
'll be speaking with your parents about this situation very soon
Bet your ass on that, son
Young lady
Talking to me, dad
Who else would  be talking to
And take that thing off
(pulling off the mask) Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff
'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady
Let's go
Right now
You and  can discuss it on the walk home
She stands next to Mikey for a moment, both on the verge of tears
Hood and Wendy walk through a cold drizzling rain
He looks at her from time to time, then takes her arm
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it
really don't care that much
'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all
Huh
mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch
It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess
She looks at him
They keep walking
She walks through a puddle
(') Your toes cold
Yeah
He stops and lifts her in his arms
'll carry you up the drive
She puts her arms around his neck and he lifts her up
On her face, as he carries her -- a look of blank but real intimacy
Hood and Wendy enter, wet and cold, muttering hellos
(
) (from the kitchen) Dinner in ten minutes
You go dry off now
Wendy heads for the stairs, Hood following
Hood finishes taking off his wet clothes as Elena enters and turns on a light
She stands watching him
Never guess where  found her
Not much response From Elena
(') In the basement over at Janey and Jim's
With that weirdo Mikey
Not even a  on
And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed
Well, really let him have it
(a nervous laugh) and Wendy came home peacefully
Hey, should  dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your - Up to you
'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that
get you loud and clear
hey, you look nice
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup
Jim left it, last time he was over
It was on the dash of the car
You were, you know, reading, thought 'd just catch some air
Let's eat
Oh right
The mustache coffee cup
The one that was sitting on the dash
Yeah, that one
That one
She walks down to the kitchen, Benjamin following her
Wendy is already in the kitchen, fishing through the drawers for silverware and napkins
Paul enters
See you
Stay out of trouble
You'll be on the 10:30 train
11:30
Paul -- Ah let the guy have his fun
What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address
Libbets
Libbets Casey
Libbets
What kind of name is Libbets
silent dinner of turkey sandwiches with Elena, Benjamin, and Wendy
The turkey carcass sits, embarrassed, in the middle of the table
Wendy, finished, gets up from the table
Opens the fridge, but finds nothing
Then goes to the candy shelf and grabs some Hot Tamales, leaving the room without a word and going into the den
Wendy turns the  on
and that ends today's highlight coverage of the Watergate affair
Shoot
Hood and Elena rise from the table with their dishes
What's for dessert
See for yourself
No advice from the experts, huh
His plate slips out of his hands into the trash
He fishes it out and sets it on the counter
Don't start
You think  -- have no idea
What's on your mind
Don't -- It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after
don't want to talk about it
Stupid mustache cup
What do you mean
Don't be dim
Elena, what are you're talking about
'm not surprised
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again -- Your unfaithfulness -- that's what 'm trying to talk about
Your unfaithfulness
Your betrayal
Your dalliance
And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it
(quieter) Am  unfaithful
Is that what you're trying to say
It's a starting place
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after
If you're going to insult me -- What else could  be
What else could  be
We're not living in the real world here
You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts
there are some hard facts here
Silence
(') It's the law of the land
the government, the world, those two guys on the Yankees
And 'm not having any fun at it,  can tell you that
'm not
Wendy puts the volume of the  up, to drown out a conversation she can almost overhear but doesn't want to
' Oh lord
You think 'm so dense
And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party
You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all
You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this
You don't really know what this feels like
(whispering) Sure  do
Do  know what loneliness feels like
Sure  do know a lot about it, if that's what you mean
Benjamin
That's supposed to explain it
Seemingly tired, he stands before her
Silence
Elena sighs, then walks into the den
We're going to the Halford's
The number's on the calendar in the kitchen
We should be home around 11
(eyes still glued to the ) Is it a big party
big neighborhood party
suppose
Why
Just curious
If there's a problem, guess 'll just call you there to interrupt
What sort of problems are you planning exactly
Elena kisses the top of her head
(still watching the ) Oh  thought 'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune
Or set the house on fire
You know
Just bundle up
It's supposed to freeze tonight
We'll see you in the morning
Elena and Ben emerge from the house, and look up at a darkening, foreboding sky
light rain falls
They jog toward their car
/ The car moves slowly through the rainy suburban streets
Inside, Elena and Ben don't speak
Their Firebird pulls up
There are already many other cars parked on the lawn and driveway
Hood and Elena enter
Dot Halford accosts them
Ben, Elena
Wonderful
Wonderful
So wonderful to see you
Finishing the last of a celery canoe, she kisses the air next to Ben's ear and gives Elena a manic hug
Then, picking up a white salad bowl from the hall table: (') Would you care to play
New this year
Close on: the bowl full of keys
(') Strictly volunteer, of course
You can put your coats in the library if you like
Oh, damn
Uh, 've left the -- You've
In the car
Oh, yeah
Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot
/
' Ben and Elena climb back in the car and close the doors, shivering
This just isn't the best moment for this
know,  know
had no idea -- That this was going to be a key party
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse
key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already
Well
think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home
Damn it, Ben -- 'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife
That's not why we're here, right
We're simply being neighbors here, and  think we should do just that -- You're not going to -- 'm not
You have some marker, that's what think, if you want to know the truth
You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when  get back to the house 'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and 'll catch you, that's what  think
She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and 'll catch -- Elena
She rubs her eyes
(') Elena, it's not what you think
It's not a big plot
Honestly
Honestly
don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me don't feel good about it
know 've done what  didn't want to do
don't know -- Well, 'm really pleased to hear a confession
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up
Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben
Thank you
So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do
Let's just go on in
'd rather talk to anyone else but you
She pulls the keys out of the ignition, gets out of the car, and slams the door
He follows her
Oh, Dot
Elena, entering the house again, tosses the keys at Dot Halford, who looks surprised
Hood slides in behind his wife
Dot drops the keys into the bowl
Slow-motion, close up: the keys, on their equine chain, fall in with a
' The room is crowded with nervous, expectant couples and various groupings
Elena slips into a side room
Benjamin heads over immediately to the drink table and pours a stiff one, turning around to find at his elbow none other than George Clair
Benjie
Clair, George Clair
What the hell brings you to New Canaan
Well, it's the funniest thing
've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging
Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping
Miraculous
Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams
How about that
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence
real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh
Darned right
Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather
You think it's gonna work
Don't see how
think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff
No, trust me -- disaster pics
And air hockey
Yeah, good
Benjamin catches a glimpse of Janey, voluptuously attired, across the room
(') Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am
(beat) Say, where's the wife
(winking as he goes) In Rhode Island with the folks
'm a free agent tonight
At this, they both notice Elena slowly gliding across the other side of the room
Clair gives Ben a sideways glance, then moves on
Ben makes straight for Janey, who pretends to be preoccupied with a plant
Oh jeez, Benjie
Well, here you are
Damn right, but where the hell were you
(looking around) What are you talking about
(whispering, but too loudly) Don't bullshit me around, Janey
Jesus Christ,  waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about
What the hell happened
Janey takes a sip of her drink
prior engagement overcame me
What
Listen, Benjamin Hood
have obligations that precede your
from before you showed up
One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean 'm
'm not just some toy for you
When  remembered some chores wanted to get done before the party,  just did them, that's all, because  wanted to do them before saw Jimmy
Jimmy
Jimmy
don't know how to take this
And what do you mean, Jimmy
thought you said you and your husband -- How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin
'm sorry -- just can't believe you could be so -- Stalling, he watches her take another sip of her drink and wander off
The air is filled with talk of Watergate, Billie Jean King, the Oil Crisis, the Mets
Benjamin goes over to the couch, where Dave Gorman is chatting up an attractive younger woman
(lighting up a joint) Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try
This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions
(waving it away) Thanks for the advice Dave
But then, Benjamin changes his mind
(') Uh, well, what the hey
Taking the joint, he tugs on it, holding the smoke in his lungs
(') (coughing) Good shit
Sure is good shit
It's opiated had it in my chamber for a while was smoking this other -- It's what
Don't fret, Benjie, it's -- Darn it, Dave
He rises unsteadily, weaving through the room's conversations
Take California
They've got their own airline in-state that's not subject to the fare controls
Compare Sacramento to
on the controlled airlines and you'll see what Friedman is saying -- supply and demand, less restriction
Benjamin walks over to a window
The outdoor lamps illuminate a new and heavy downpour of frozen sleet
Paul is seated, reading the latest number of The Fantastic Four comic book
The cover displays a lurid, atomically glowing baby
The conductor walks through the cabin
Approaching our final stop, Grand Central Station
Paul looks out the window at the tenements of Harlem, barely visible through the walls of sleet
Soon the train enters the tunnel toward the station
Paul gets out of a cab and heads inside
He's met by the doorman
Libbets Casey, please
Your name
Paul Hood
(a smirk) Elevator on the right
Eighth floor -- she's waiting for you
' Paul rings the bell
(
) (from the other side of the door) Open it Paul
Paul opens the door, and enters the apartment
' It's half dark, has an air of old wealth
Libbets skids across the parquet floor to him
Excellent
We were waiting
She turns and runs into the den
(under his breath) We
And there, in the den, cleaning an ounce of dope on an open copy of Nixon's Six Crises, is -- Francis
(lifting the book up) You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life
Check out the Checkers speech stuff
(all hope drained from him) Francis
You gonna leave the seeds in there
In the binding like that
All will be revealed, baby
The television is turned on to a weather report about the coming ice storm
(') Awesome sleet and rain
Major
Howdy there
You, young knight
Can you check on the mead
Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead
Huh
(nasal voice, impersonating a character) Moisture
Moisture
(pointing) Beer
In the pantry
Paul trudges disconsolately out of the room
Paul, after wandering a maze of halls, enters the kitchen, where he takes a six-pack out of the fridge and returns to the living room
He enters the room with the beer
Frankie opens them with his teeth
(handing him a beer) Hey, it's a sellable skill
Francis licks closed a second joint, then takes the beer and opens it with his rear molars
Hell on the fillings
Paul opens the other two beers and hands one to Libbets
They light up a joint
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay
Paul and Francis exchange a look
She puts an Allman Brothers tape on the 8-track and turns the down
Wendy enters the bathroom
She fills the sink with water, then turns off the tap
She takes a razor blade from the counter, and slowly, determinedly, holds it to her wrist
She presses it into her skin, drawing a small drop of blood
Ouch
She drops the blade and splashes water on her wrist, grabbing some toilet paper and holding it against the tiny wound
Stupid
She hears the phone ring and walks downstairs
Wendy picks up the phone
Hood residence
Mikey is on the other end of the line
You're parents at that party
: Yeah
Yours
You get in trouble
Maybe
Can't really tell yet
'm sorry if  got you into trouble
Maybe we don't have to, you know
unless you really want to
Yeah
'm going to Silver Meadow, check out the ice storm
You wanna come
Maybe
Yeah
Mikey, bundled up in a huge orange ski parka and cap, heads for the door
Where you going
Out
It's freezing
(pausing) Yeah
When it freezes,  guess that means the molecules are not moving
So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body
The molecules have stopped
So it's clean
Sandy just looks at him
He walks out into the night
' Elena sits on a couch, talking to no one, barely looking up, when someone stands in front of her
Reverend Edwards
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip
He sits beside her
You're here
'm a bit surprised
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep
'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile
Philip's about to reply, but thinks better of it
They sit glumly next to each other for a minute
Then Philip rises
Forgive me
He walks swiftly to the hall and hurriedly fishes his keys out of the bowl, then heads for the door
(passing by) hope those weren't my keys
He laughs at his own joke as Philip rushes out the front door
Back to Elena, even more forlorn than before
Paul enters the bathroom
We hear Francis' and Libbets' voices from the other room, laughing
He pees
At the sink, he pauses in front of the medicine cabinet, then opens it
Eureka
He pulls out some bottles
Valium
Seconal
Uh, (can't quite pronounce this one) Par-er-goric
(a beat, looking into the mirror for effect) Francis Chamberlain Davenport the Fourth -- tonight you sleep the sleep of the just
He pockets the Seconal and turns out the light
Paul re-enters the den to find Francis alone
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded
Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place
Paul takes out the bottle and opens it
Check it out
Not for the faint of heart
Pharmaceutical
You are a god
(') (picking up beer, trying to hurry before Libbets returns) One for you and one for me
He hands a pill to Francis, then pretends to pop one into his mouth and takes a swig of his beer
As Francis downs his own, Paul pockets his unswallowed pill
(in the doorway) No candy for me
Groovy
(to Paul) Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess
Well, uh,  don't, it's really -- What is it
Come on Paulie, share the wealth
You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway
Let's see
(hand in pocket) Libbets, you really shouldn't mix and match, you know with the beer
'll put 'em back
Libbets reaches into his pocket and pulls out the bottle
Oh far out, Paulie
Hey look, these expired like five months ago
You think they're better aged
She opens up the bottle and takes one out
Maybe you should have just a half
Thanks for the advice dad
She takes the pill
Paul looks on, thwarted
' Ben is back at the bar, pouring another tall one
Mark Boland sidles up next to him
Benjie, feeling no pain
As the Indian saying goes, pain is merely an opinion
(nodding across the room) Hey -- check it out
Maria Conrad's brought her son
(walking off) wish some of the gang had brought their daughters
Ben feels a wave of distaste at the joke
He looks across the room as Maria and her son Neil (stringy hair, acne, tie-dyed turtleneck, patched jeans) are engaging Janey and Philip Edwards in conversation
' Paul, Francis, and Libbets sit on the floor, listening to the music blasting at full strength
Libbets and Francis are obviously on the verge of unconsciousness
Paul regards them with a look of apprehension on his face
' Neil has now cornered Janey
As Werner says, there is nothing to get
That's It
When you get that there's nothing to get
That's the training, when you ask yourself, the question, "What is is
" Wait, this is the training, where they don't let you go to the bathroom
That was the hardest part
But did it
And you get into some far out shit
' Libbets puts a blanket over a sleeping Francis, who's crashed out on the floor in a corner
Francis alternates between snores and various mumbled delirious ravings
The foot
the foot
toeclipper man
Paul is sitting on the couch, and Libbets comes back and sits at his feet, facing up to him
guess he's just real exhausted from, you know, tests and stuff
Libbets is herself somewhat in dreamland
Yeah
You know Libbets,  really feel, you know, like a real connection to you -- Yeah but you don't even know me really
Sure  do, you know, like your aura
That you give off
My what
It's like very positive, and  feel a real special feeling, because you really -- And  have a special feeling too, because  do
It's special
You do
'm glad
Because  feel for you -- And  have a feeling for you too, because you're just like --  feel for you like you're -- you're just like -- (simultaneously) -- like a brother
Yeah, you're not alone with that line
do
Right
Cool
So, how about we take a bath together
(consciousness fading fast) Hah hah you're funny
bath
Like a brother and sister
Oh man, 'm so wasted
Her head bobs and weaves, her eyes close, and suddenly her head falls forward with a whoosh toward the couch -- smack dab between Paul's legs
She begins to snore instantly, her open mouth nuzzling into his crotch
Paul doesn't move, doesn't even breathe
Then, slowly, he leans his back into the couch, without shifting the rest of his body
He looks as though he has simultaneously won the lottery and received a lobotomy
' The crowd's a bit thinner than before
As Dot Halford begins calling out for everyone's attention, a few couples make their last-minute way to the door
everyone
We have a little business to attend to now
So everyone who'd like to stay, please gather in the living room
She scoops up the bowl and places it on a high end table which has been put in the middle of the room
(walking up to Elena) Ready to go
We're not going anywhere
Elena waves at Janey Williams, who is standing across the living room
Janey looks back without expression
' Libbets and Paul in the same position whence last we saw them
Paul delicately leans to one side of the couch and picks up a phone
He dials a number
: The phone rings
Wendy picks it up
Hood residence
(whispering) Charles, what time is it
Is this Charles
What time is it
Um, ten-o-five
Why
Where are you
'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma
And  was wondering, because  know you're a very moral person, and -- And
Shit
can't really talk about it
guess  better get to the train
Right
What are you doing at home on a Friday night
have plans
Paul hangs up the phone and looks down at Libbets
Libbets' Allman Brothers tape has run out
The machine makes a repeated clicking sound as the take up real continues to circle
The only other sound is the noise of the wind and rain lashing against the apartment's windows
Wendy emerges from the house and gets on her bike, but the ice makes it too slippery
The storm is now in full swing
She gets off and walks
Wendy walks, barely keeping her balance in the wind
' All the couples are now gathered for the key selection process, men on one side of the room, women on the other
The storm can be heard outside
Well, what shall the order be, alphabetical
In order of appearance
Golf handicap
Lowest handicap does the honors
Nervous laughter
Golf handicap
Ladies, isn't it up to you
Oh 'll go first, damn it
Let's just line up and get it over with
Maria chooses Stephen Earle
Hands the keys to him smattering of applause as she takes his arm and they leave
Good luck
Neil watches his mother's exit
: few more couplings
: Helen Worthington approaches the bowl
Helen Worthington has the size and shape of a sumo wrestler
There is a nervous shifting of weight on the male side of the room
Helen delicately reaches into the bowl
Her hands emerge with a key chain
George Clair steps forward, obviously depressed, as a collective sigh of relief goes up from behind him
Ben looks on, momentarily triumphant
Elena smiles to herself
: The Gadds choose each other
Oh, my own husband
Isn't that against the rules
Try again
(relieved) Oh,  think not
Mr
Gadd smiles as they leave, obviously happy to go
Finally, only Mark Boland, Neil Conrad, Janey and Jim Williams, Rob and Dot Halford, Sari Steele, Benjamin and Elena
Getting down to the wire
Elena steps forward
Benjamin is obviously agitated
Close on Janey's hands selecting -- away from Ben's equine key ring
She lifts up another key ring -- Neil Conrad, the teenager
She hands the self-important-looking Neil his keys and they turn to go
Jim Williams smiles mysteriously to himself
Ben suddenly lurches forward, semi-drunkenly, trying to separate Neil from Janey
(ad lib) Hey hey Ben, hang on there a sec
He backs off, ashamed, and, taking a step backwards, trips over the coffee table
Mark Boland helps lift him up
Sorry
maybe  should
the bathroom
Right down the hall, Ben
(muttering) Sorry, 'm sorry
Uh, 'll be back
Dot follows Mark Boland down the hall behind Ben
Suddenly, it's just Elena and Jim Williams, and Sari Steele and Rob Halford
(taking Sari's arm) Actually, we didn't put our keys in at all
But you won't spread it around
It's my party, and Dot isn't
hey, we're just going to slip upstairs for a while
You folks like a cup of coffee or something before we go
Elena and Jim look at each other
Rob, we'll fix it for ourselves
You two go and get acquainted
We'll let ourselves out the front door
Jim and Elena stand there alone
Well,  have to say  don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl
Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around
Let me
She takes the bowl and dips her hand in
Two sets are left
One, her own, she avoids
She takes out Jim's keys and walks across the room, handing them to him
Thanks, but -- oh,  don't think so
It's been kind of a discouraging evening
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk
Somehow it was different in my imagination when  thought about it
Actually,  didn't think about it at all, really
They sit down on the sofa
You want coffee or something
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen -- Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors
you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were
've been married to him for 17 years and  don't have any intention of going in there to get him
so what 'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, 'm proposing that you and  do what makes sense
Stay warm
Pass some time
That's all
They both look at their hands
Now don't make me feel as if 'm being too forward,
If you don't -- What the hey
Let's go for a drive
Okay
Shall we clean up around here first
Do you think it's all right-- Nah, that wasn't in the contract
But they still walk around turning off lights
In the hallway, Elena looks a bit mournfully at the light seeping from underneath the bathroom door
She hears the sound of running water from inside
Then she goes into a sideroom and joins Jim
They pick up their coats
Elena and Jim walk outside into the freezing, pelting rain
Covering their faces, they jog to his car, an oversized Cadillac
thick glaze of ice forms on his windshield
' They climb in
We're going to have to defrost this thing for a while
He turns on the ignition, and the vents start to blow cold air at them
He leans over and kisses her
Do these seats go back
That starts it
He jumps at her, unbuckling her and unzipping himself
They tangle uncomfortably for a few seconds
And then, comically, he's in her
With a groan, it's over in a flash
Jim pulls himself off, readjusting his pants
That was awful, really awful
'm so sorry, Elena
Elena has somehow worked herself into the cavity of the glove compartment, and is trying to figure out how to extricate herself
Things are really rotten at home
You wouldn't believe how rotten
Janey's sick
She's unstable, guess
it's not the right time to tell you
but that's it -- it's like  can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't -- Jim, maybe we should just go
've got to look in on the kids
Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- can do better than that, honestly -- Well, we can talk about it
That's fine
wouldn't expect you to see it any other way
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec,  need to tidy up -- just a minute, 'll be right back
You'll wait
Of course
She opens the door and walks back to the house
'
' Elena hesitantly walks to the bathroom
She opens the door
Ben's sitting on the floor, next to the toilet, woozily flipping through the pages of a magazine
Elena
Ben, 've got a ride home
Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here
'll drive you -- Ben
She sits on the toilet next to him, stroking his hair
(') You're in no condition to drive
We'll talk in the morning,
He sits, accepting and quiet
(') You'll get some sleep on the couch out there
(looking up at her, with gratitude) Sure
'll try
And we'll talk in the morning
We'll talk in the morning
Wendy walks up the drive in the rain, pauses, then goes to the front door and knocks lightly
The door swings ajar
She pushes on it, and lets herself in
Anyone home
Hello
Wendy wanders into the living room, then climbs the steps
The sound of the wind and the darkness begin to scare her
She goes into Mikey's room -- it's even more of a disaster zone than usual
She sees on the wall his dark-light poster of the 12 (sexual) positions of the zodiac
She notices the black garter belt on the floor, and picks it up, absentmindedly swinging it in her hand as she walks out of the room
She walks back down the stairs and into the kitchen, leaving the garter belt on the counter
She opens the refrigerator, grabs a jar of peanut butter, and scoops some up in her finger
As she puts her finger in her mouth -- Wendy
She gives out a little yelp
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me
What are you doing
Just thought 'd stop by
Mike's out --  think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there
Yeah
(pause) Are you his girlfriend
No
' Elena gets in
They drive off silently
The car moves haltingly through the sleet and ice, inches up a hill, then falters and slides back silently, circling a couple of times before crashing into an embankment
As the car slides and crashes amid Jim's and Elena's screams
Silence
You okay
Yeah
You
Yes
Well,  guess we can walk from here
Jim and Elena get out, shaky, from the car
They pause for a moment
The street lamp above them sizzles, but stays on
They start to walk
' Paul and Libbets, still frozen in the same position
Finally, Paul gently pushes Libbets' head back
It slides off his leg and, as Paul lurches forward in a failed attempt to grab it, Libbets flops backwards, her head hitting the carpet with a dull but decidedly loud thump
Oh shit
Paul gets up, looks down at her
She snores
He runs over to a side table and sees the clock: 11:10
(') Oh shit oh shit
He grabs his comic books and runs for the door
The driver impassively inches down Park Avenue
Oh shit oh shit
'mon
Paul sprints down the platform just as the doors are closing
He barely makes it into the train
Paul walks through the nearly empty train car and finds a seat
He pulls his Fantastic Four comic book out of his coat pocket
Ben makes his way to the kitchen, pours himself a cup of coffee
He sees himself reflected in the black glass of the cabinets
' Sandy and Wendy are sitting on the floor
He grabs his
Joe
Check this out
He's supposed to talk all kinds of stuff, but he's like malfunctioned
He pulls the dog tag on the doll, and
Joe emits a plastic macho voice
Mayday
Mayday
Get this message back to base
Same thing
Again and again
Wendy takes the doll and yanks the cord
Mayday
Mayday
Get this message back to base
It's gonna get a lot colder tonight,  predict
Probably a blackout
Do you have candles in your house
know where the candles are, and have my own flashlight
Over there
Also,  know where every emergency exit is on this floor
During the course of his monologue, as Wendy looks on, Sandy calmly ties a noose for his doll
This knot's called a bowline
He puts the noose over the doll's head, as Wendy holds him
Mayday
Mayday
Let's hang him
Sandy drapes the noose over the edge of a dresser drawer
Joe dangles
They both look at him in silence
The silence continues
He's dead
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up
He wouldn't blow up
He'd just get all mangled or twisted
She takes him down and lays him flat on the bed
And then begins to remove his clothes
Sandy looks on, desirous
Well
(noticing his lack of anatomy) It looks like someone got to his private parts before us
Communist Viet Cong
They left it in the jungle
They speak with high seriousness
Wendy slides up on the bed where Sandy sits, a pillow on his lap, and one by one, with exaggerated slowness, she removes her snowboots, as if they were stiletto heels
Can  get into your bed
(pause) With you
Sandy begins to shake
We -- we have to go to the guest room
We can't stay in here
What if Mikey
My parents
Don't worry about them
They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff
Sandy begins to cry
It's just -- it's just -- She takes his hand, and they walk out of the room and down the hall, into the guest room
Wendy and Sandy enter
She sees the vodka bottle on the dresser
Want a drink
Vodka
You never tasted the stuff
She fills the glass to the brim and hands the bottle to Sandy
They clink and each toss back a sip -- Wendy almost the entire glass
Sandy coughs and gags, but swallows
Try again
He does
It feels warm
One more shot
Okay
They drink
Under the covers
Under they go, and soon every layer of clothing emerges
(feeling her way) Get 'em off
Sandy begins to laugh, and soon Wendy joins him
They roll around on top of each other for a while
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission
Huh
That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream
Sandy shakes his head
They didn't tell you this stuff yet
What planet do you live on
Sandy doesn't answer, but climbs back on top of her and kisses her neck
love you
That's nice
Are you drunk
don't know
How do  know
don't know either
You spin around, when you lie down
Sandy rolls off her and lies on his back
(') don't think 'm spinning
They cuddle up together
He yawns
She yawns
Mikey walks along the edge of the empty pool in the rain
He climbs up on the diving board and bounces lightly on it, but then gets off and stands, looking down at the pool again
Mikey walks across the field
The storm has let up
Mikey walks along
With a running start, he slides on the ice down a hill
He walks back up and slides again, hollering with joy
He is an image of a tiny yet absolute and positive freedom
The streetlights sputter on, then off
Sandy and Wendy lie asleep
power line is down
It hisses and  -- a humming very much like the humming Mikey has been hearing earlier
The humming takes on the same transcendent tonality to which Mikey has become so accustomed at such moments
Mikey sits down on a metal street guardrail, to ponder the sound and the snaking coil of electricity
strange look of almost religious wonder overcomes his face, as the power line connects to the guardrail
Oh shit
Glued by an electrical pulse to the rail, he shakes as the current flows through him
After a minute, his body slumps and slides down the road
As Paul sits reading on he moving train, the lights inside begin to sputter, and the train begins to slow
After a few moments, the train grinds to a halt, and Paul and his few fellow late night passengers are left in near total dark, with only the light of an emergency exit sign above Paul's head to light the scene
The train is eerily silent
Ben drives home
An emergency vehicle, lights flashing, crawls by Ben's car
He drives on slowly
- Jim and Elena arrive on foot
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up
can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room
Sure
Maybe coffee
- Phone's out
hope the pipe's -- He walks into the kitchen
The pipes have begun to burst
There's a water leak running down the walls, forming a puddle on the floor
Elena has walked into the kitchen behind him
She leans against the counter, picking up the garter belt without thinking for a second, then putting it back down
Oh well
Why don't you put on some dry socks -- and we've got some rain boots in the guest closet back there
Last room upstairs -- back of the hall
Elena climbs the stairs in her bare feet
' Elena opens the door, and discovers Wendy and Sandy asleep
She stands before the bed, and gazes down on them
They look almost angelic
Wendy, sensing her presence in the room, opens her eyes, slowly coming out of sleep
(heartbroken, softly) Get dressed
Elena walks out of the room, back to the kitchen
Wendy gets out of bed quietly, leaving Sandy sleeping peacefully
She looks at him lovingly, and tucks the blanket back up around him
Elena and Jim are drinking coffee
You should let him sleep
Wendy enters
She looks inquisitively at the two adults
Where's dad
Ben continues to drive slowly
He looks out his side window, and sees something
He puts on his brakes
Ben gets out of the car, and stands on the top of an icy embankment
In a clump of bushes is the orange glow of a parka
He walks hesitantly toward it
Mike's body lies face down in the wet ice
Ben leans down and turns the body over, then stands back in amazement and saddened shock
He stands there for a moment, then picks Mike's body up, carrying him over the hill and onto the street
We see now that he is parked just a short block from the Williams's house
He bypasses his car and walks directly down the street toward the house
The effort is obviously enormous
He falls from time to time, then gets back up
- Various passengers asleep
Paul, hunched up in his seat under the faint emergency exit light, cold
He reads his comic book by the light of the emergency exit
"'  , , " Suddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the train's engines returns
The conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic nasal train conductor voice
Good morning ladies and gentlemen -- On Paul, squinting in the harsh light
- The train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested landscape
On the street below the bridge, an emergency highway crew is removing a fallen tree, their trucks aglow in flashing yellow lights
Elena pours Wendy a cup of coffee
They're both in their coats
don't like coffee
It'll warm you up
Elena sits next to her
They both raise their cups and sip the coffee, not noticing the simultaneity of their movements
Jim watches the sleeping Sandy, picks up the half-empty bottle of vodka, pours himself a drink
The noise wakes Sandy up
Jim sits down on the bed at his feet and takes a sip
Dad
Jim looks at him
Elena and Wendy hear a hollering from outside, get up to see what it is
Elena and Wendy come out the front door, as Ben lays Mikey's body onto the ground before the front steps
Ben
He's too breathless to speak
They stand there, looking down at Mikey
Behind Elena and Wendy, Jim appears
He pushes softly by them toward the body of his son
Jim -- he was just up --  in Silver Lane --  think maybe -- a power line -- Jim picks up his son
He carries him silently into the house
Sandy, now standing inside the foyer, pushes himself back against the wall as they pass, without expression
After a moment, from outside, the Hoods can hear Jim's wailing
Do you think
Maybe we should call someone -- The phone's out
(') Yeah
Well, we can just -- Ben,  don't think he wants us here
Wendy has been watching Sandy through the screen door
Wait,  -- She turns back up the front steps and gently goes in -- ' on the living room floor, Jim is hugging Mike's body, his shoulders shaking uncontrollably, sobbing
Wendy walks and stands next to Sandy, who is filled momentarily with a brief inexplicable rush of anger toward her -- but she takes him and gives him an awkward, childlike hug, then turns and runs out the door, joining Ben and Elena on the driveway
Sandy watches her go, his face wet with tears
' Oh you know, for a minute  thought it was -- Paul
Yeah
You think -- He's probably been waiting all night at the station
'mon
Elena, Wendy, and Ben reach the car and get in
The car starts and drives off
There are more crews out cleaning up the storm's debris and fixing the power lines as they drive
The train slowly pulls in
The Hood family walks down to the end of the platform
The train doors open, and Paul, tired and a bit cramped, emerges
He sees his family gathered at the other end of the platform, and walks to them
They stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him
When he joins them they all walk silently to the car and get in
Sunlight floods in and temporarily blinds Ben as he starts the engine
He squints, his eyes tearing a bit from the light
He looks around, first at his wife, then at his two children sitting in the back seat
He turns off the engine
Quietly, he begins to cry
He turns to the back seat
There's something -- your mother and  -- have to tell you two -- Elena puts her hand out, almost touching him
(softly) Ben
Paul looks at Wendy, silently asking her what's happening
She casts her eyes downward, as does he
(') (her hand still not yet touching him) Ben
From above: The car, the first morning light shining upon it
