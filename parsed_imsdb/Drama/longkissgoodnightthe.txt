Wind tossed
, a bed, dappled with moon shadow
, fast asleep
The wind whistles and sighs outside
She
Eyelids closed, eyes roving beneath
then suddenly they open
stifled cry
She thrashes for her  , as a soft voice says: Shhhhh
And there's , kneeling beside her
Vague shape in the dimness
The full moon throws light across one sparkling eye
Mommy, the men on the mountain
Shhhh
Gone, all gone now
(strokes her hair) 'm here
Mommy's always here and no one can ever hurt you
Safe now
safe and warm
snug as a bug in a rug
(beat) 'll sit with you, think you can sleep
Turn on the nightlight
The mother nods
Passes her left hand gently over the girl's forehead
Close your eyes now
love you
The child subsides, breathing steady
Eyes closed
The mother rises
Regards her through the dimness
Slowly turns, heads for the door
Flicks on a Winnie the Pooh  -- Her entire right forearm is slicked with blood
More blood on her Czech-made -5 machine gun
She staggers just a little
barely noticeable
Passes out on the light
Into darkness
Sits beside her daughter's bed
The child sleeps peacefully
Outside snow slithers at the glass
Pause
Blackness
: It's snowing in southwestern Ohio
Before us, nestled in the rolling hills: a postcard slice of suburbia
the legend: ,
Three Weeks Earlier
Peaceful
Serene
It's the town in the glass bubble, the one God shakes to watch it snow
- , dozens of them, bursting from houses
Slapping of screen doors
-  is rattling down Main Street
Flanked by kids
Christmas carols, droning from loudspeakers
,   waves howdy, chortling his "Ho's" in groups of three, meanwhile he's really a grizzled old fire marshall named , freezing his nuts off
Beside him sits
, about whom we notice two things: First, she's the June in this June/December pair -- and second, she's to kill for, an effortlessly beautiful woman
For the record, meet
How you holdin' up
Freezing my nuts off
Santa produces a bottle of Seagrams
Starts to open it
*Put that away*
Earl complies, grumbling
Some teenage burnouts howl from a street corner: Ow
Mrs
Claus is
Samantha squirms in her seat, scowling
can't take it, Earl, this dumb costume is giving me a wedgie
Driving me crazy, but there's these *kids* here -- Right, you don't wanna be rootin' -- In front of little Billy, age four, yeah
"Look, Mommy, Mrs
Claus chooses to go butt-mining
" This is little Billy talking
Age four, kid's unbelievable
(sighs) 'm too old for this, Earl
Yeah, yeah
Spare me,  got a prostate the size of a melon
Samantha stares at him
Seriously, half my life's a doctor's hand up my ass,  should marry the fucker
Say that a little louder, there's a kid in back didn't catch it
It's not that fucking little Billy again, is it
: Throughout the following , we watch Sam: 1) Rallying the varsity ; 2) Showing off a  to her seventh graders; 3) Kneeling in church with her , blessing herself; 4) Absently fingering a silver  which she wears round her neck; and finally 5) Probing at a tiny ridged  under her hairline

) Eight years
keep hiring detectives, but they never find anything
(beat) was born 3000 days ago on the beach in New Jersey
entered the world fully grown, wearing clothes  don't remember buying
Nothing in the pockets but a single key, filed smooth

Nice guy, early forties

Thirty-five, maybe

- Samantha walks with her husband
Late thirties
Balding
Coming out of St
Paul's Episcopal Church
Hal,  gotta tell you, of all the Christmas pageants 've seen, this was by far the most recent
Aw, honey,  had teenage girls playing the wise men, what'd you expect
Teenage boys
Well,  thought they did fine
Just fine
Come on, it was ground breaking stuff
The first Nativity where Joseph stares at the wise men's tits all night
She hugs him good-naturedly
As they near their house, an eight year-old  drops from a  and comes running, leaps into Mommy's arms -- Hey, you
The kid leaps into her arms, as we : (
) Her name is Caitlin
She's my daughter and when  woke up on that long-ago day, she was two months grown in my belly
don't know who put her there
may never
just know she's mine, and she's about to turn eight
The family troops up the driveway to their
Chipper little -frame
Christmas lights abound
Behind the house, a vast frozen
It is idyllic
- in progress
Laughter
Mingling
In the corner, puts pipe cleaner antlers on the gerbil
Samantha shepherds her home room class past the punchbowl
She is radiant surreptitiously nips from a silver flask
(
) 3000 days
teach now, fifth grade
have the key,  wear it around my neck for luck
Except for that, and my name, all traces of my prior life are lost

Did someone look in my eyes, did  say, "Darling, 'll never forget you
" (beat) Because fuck me, darling,  managed
-- Her daughter  hangs with two young girls
Shows off a plush  , says: His name is Mr
Perkins, my Mom named him for me
#1 points, whispers excitedly: #1 That's her
Caitlin nods
Kid #2: #2 That's who
#1 (excitedly) Her Mom, she's got amnesia
#2 Swear
Swear
#2 Too weird
voice interrupts their reverie: Excuse me
The girls whirl around, startled -- Samantha is leaning on the desk behind them
Busted
She smiles amiably: Hello, girls
Caitlin, 'm going to help Dad with the refreshments
(leans in, whispers) Which one's Dad
forget
The girls look at her like she's grown a tail
*Kidding*

Splintered
Lock shattered
- ,  - on the bed
They look up, startled -- as three men burst through the door
The : a haggard-looking man sporting a soup-stain on his tie, whoops, that's the design, sorry
, private investigator and con man extraordinaire
He flashes a phony badge: '
What the hell is this
Don't give me an attitude, sir
You're assuming  won't shoot your sorry ass, and everyone knows when you make an assumption, you make an ass out of u and mption
'm Sergeant Madigan, Vice, and if you cop a 'tude, jerkoff,  will see to it you spend the next ten years in prison getting ass-fucked, and if the case is thrown out because my arrest is too violent, then  will personally  men to ass-fuck you for ten years
So if you're an ass-fucking fan, go ahead and mouth off, but meanwhile you're under arrest for the crime of prostitution, now shut the fuck up before  cut out your kneecaps and use 'em as ashtrays
(beat) Officer Donleavy, read him his rights
Donleavy looks pale, pasty
He stutters a few words
Loses interest
Wanders away across the room
(a trifle confused) Please, this is my first,
've never done this before, 'll do anything
Sir, listen to me
understand you're not a wealthy man, but in light of the damage this arrest will cause you, we might be able to make an arrangement -- Donleavy plops in a chair
Belches
Grins foolishly
The man in bed points to him: Is he all right
is swaying on his feet
Like a tree in a hurricane
Donleavy pukes all over the floor
We  : - '
The one in bed moments ago
She and Henessey are dividing a wad of bills
We gotta stop using bums
(lights a smoke) Forget it
They looked like cops
We pulled it off, didn't we
It was embarrassing
You want  should hire actors, for Chrissake
These guys are cheap, they work for food
Uh-huh
So, when they puke all over you is that, like, a refund
Trin, 'm pissin' myself over here, you're so funny
What's this
He indicates an envelope earmarked for him
Labeled in magic marker:
New case, honest to God chick with amnesia
You want the job
Henessey opens the envelope
Extracts a black and white of Samantha, says immediately: Yep
Yep, yep, yep
Stares, mesmerized
Trin peers over his shoulder: Wasn't there a lady on  named Samantha
Had a magic nose or something
'Bewitched', yeah
Good show
Chick lived with a faggy guy, then in the last season it was a different faggy guy
Okay
Here's what we do; get on the horn to amnesia chick, tell her yes
Then tell her in 1967 she promised to give me a blow job
Worth a try, right
- and  bid goodnight to their friends and neighbors
Hal steers her away from a middle-aged teacher
Christ, guy's all over you like a cheap suit
That's funny, there's a cheap suit all over him like a cheap suit
She notices  sitting in the bushes by the side of the building
He is speaking intently to the gerbil
Oh, boy
Someone's gotta take my father home
'm plowed
Samantha takes the keys from him
Breathes deeply of the chill night air
Smiling
Surveys the scene
their friends
The neighborhood
Sighs: This is all  ever wanted
At which point, young Caitlin says: How would you know
-   -  - Switch gears:  grim, grey building
Guarded
Patrolled
-    - tired  set drones to an audience of one
Let's call him -
In fact, let's give him one eye, the other replaced by a
He smokes cigarettes, stubs them out on the chair's armrest
Throws offhand glances at the  screen
(
) So much for the flame-swallowing Santa of Boone County
Meanwhile, news journeyed to Upper Sandusky, where Santa's own *Mrs*
Kringle turned out to celebrate her hubby's worldwide tour
After one look at her, 'm thinking Santa got what he wanted this Christmas
The happy news chatter continues
Jack isn't listening
Jack isn't talking or breathing either
He's simply  at the  screen, jaw slack
- Gotta be fuckin' kidding
No
No way
He  as we  : -   - If you had to pick a night to die horribly, you'd be hard pressed to find a nicer one
country highway
Bathed in moonlight
Crusted with snow
Pontiac Sunbird, wending its way through the wooded slopes
- drives while Earl (the  we saw earlier) reclines, still drunk
You're married what now, five years
He makes a thumb circle
Jabs his finger in and out of it: You and Hal, how often you two
Stick our fingers in out hands and pull them out again
Every chance we get
Shut your piehole
Don't get all snippy
Earl, do me a favor
Every few words say "hic" and have bubbles come out your mouth, okay
Goddamnit, 'm not drunk
Would a drunk man have this much raw talent
He starts playing the Hawaiian nose harp
In Sam's ear, she can't help it, snorts laughter -- appears perfectly framed in the Sunbird's headlights
Dead ahead
Sam looks up, face etched in sudden *No time to think*
, no dice the animal -- And it comes
All two hundred and fifteen pounds of it
Fucks up their night altogether
Actually, it only makes it *halfway* through -- But the damn thing is
More than alive
Thrashing
Squawling with pain and rage takes out Earl
Kills him in less than a second
Collapses his skull
Sam rides the wheel, screaming
An antler gouges her chest
Rips
Draws blood
She , madly -- Hits the tree doing 50
Sam goes airborne
Explodes through the windshield, outward bound
Shower of glass, spritz of blood
And then she's flying
Slow motion, end over end
We lose all
Silence as she tumbles
Below and behind her, the Sunbird noiselessly
Fireball, sky high -- Sam floating
Describes a lazy arc in mid-air
Whoomph-
Disappears into the snow
Swallows her, leaves a silhouette
Around her, trees catch fire
Burn
She lies in her impromptu sarcophagus
Out of sight
totters from the wreck, thrashing
Scene from a nightmare
Nightmare part two: from the snow, from the human-shaped divot -- arises a woman of blood
She stumbles from the drift
Toward the wreck
And though it's clearly Sam Caine under all that crimson, there's something wrong about her *eyes*
En route to the car, she kneels beside the suffering deer, its flesh scorched and torn -- and  it
Puts it away with a sharp -
ing blow to the head
Stands, eyes squirming with madness
The car's an inferno
Earl is dead
She turns away, wiping blood from her eyes -- Comes face to face with a
jolly white fellow
Charcoal briquettes for eyes
She watches, fascinated, as he  in the blast furnace heat -- With warning, she *screams*
Crumples to the ground
The snowman's eyes fall out
He melts away and away
: - ,  - Elsewhere
Tract housing, late-model cars delivers a Christmas gift to his nine year-old son : not just any gift, the *Midtown Saturn Orbiting Precinct*, with action figures
Henessey points to the box, engrossed: and here's the jail here, see
Escape chute for the Borian, he's a dinosaur guy, Moves quick, don't take no shit neither
See, you can make him shoot the guard -- ah, hell, look,  played with it a little myself, 'm sorry
interrupts them: (
) ,
An awkward pause
Henessey scowls
Hey, you go ahead, um
hope you like the present
It's awesome, Dad
Mom, though, she
(sighs) She gets weird
On my birthday, when you gave me the Schwinn
she called bicycle stores to see if there'd been any robberies
Henessey manages to control his face
Says tightly: Tell her  don't steal them locally
He watches, forlorn, as his son vanishes inside the house
Christmas lights, blinking feebly
We , supered: (
) Dear Ma: Filled out the child support stuff last week
Office got pissed, under ex-spouse  put "Spawn of Satan, Dweller in Eternal Dark
" Just being honest, Ma, lady wants me to die
As he reaches his car, his  goes off
- Henessey on the phone
Dials
Waits
We : (
) 'd go without a ripple, that's the truth
Ex-con
Ex-husband
Expired
Thanks, Ma, for hiding the truth from me for so long
Or maybe you believed in me
miss you
hope you believed, even for a day
No one did, Ma
No one at all
It's cold here
'm sorry you're dead
Your son, Mitch
The phone picks up
He says: Me
What's up
(
) Mitch, we got a bite on amnesia chick's photo
Found a guy remembers seeing her, fall of '87
He wants cash, should  grease him
Hell, no
Use your head, girl
Let the fucker squeeze the Charmin
You kidding
Guy's hideous
'll do it, but we're talking time and a half
Plus a night on the town when get back, and *no cockfights this time*
'   - Samantha, having survived
Laid up now in an austere hospital room
Listening to silence
Stares out the window at a sunlit tree
Head bandaged
Frowns: want a cigarette, why do  want a cigarette
Outside, snow slithers
Her eyelids, slowly closing
Slides off the edge of consciousness
: She stands on a windswept cliff, before an incongruous -
Staring at her reflection -- it's bleeding from a scalp wound
She probes her head
frowns
Nothing
Nothing but the tiny she's had for as long as she can remember
What
what do you want
The reflection eyes her grimly
Haggard
Tired
want a cigarette
don't smoke
(chuckles) You used to
Samantha is suddenly holding a cigarette
She raises it to her lips
Her reflection  her precisely
Except Samantha , chokes on the smoke -- While her bloody reflection takes a long, satisfying drag
Relax, you can drop the act
Nice and smooth, take another hit
There you go
See how easy it comes back
They are now in perfect synchronicity
Sam inhales easily
*'m* coming back
You know that, don't you
Name's Charly, by the way
You're gonna love me
The reflection grins
There's blood on its
'  - Back at home, business as usual, pre-Christmas has arisen: Gingerly, bones still aching, Samantha moves toward the
and  trail behind
Honey, you can't cook, 'm not wrong about this
'm *remembering*, Hal
Things are coming back
Trust me, 'm a chef, know it
Daddy, make her stop
Hush
Go to the garage and get me something, anything
veggie, go, man, go
'm hot to trot
/ - Hal worriedly exits to the garage
Plucks a tomato from the fridge, tosses it to Caitlin, who stands in the door
Tomato
Caitlin turns, tosses it to Sam -- Tomato
Who catches it, plops it on the cutting board and proceeds to  it to
Razor-thin slices
Knife a blur
Missing her fingers by millimeters, never faltering, like a mad mumblety-pegger -- Onion, flying in
Sam catches it
Knife flurries
Pieces, flying up
More
Faster
And it becomes a bucket brigade
Hal heaves veggies to Caitlin who spins and relays to Mom who slices, dices, purees, and even makes curly fries
Veggies, incoming
starts to lose it, starts lobbing them at Caitlin, one after another, she giggles, starts throwing them overhand -- Tomato
Tomato
Tomato
And now it's a food fight,  Mom, and the floor is with food as Hal stumbles in laughing, scoops up Caitlin -- Samantha shakes her head, grinning, dices to pieces a last, lovely radish
Ends with a flourish, --
Doesn't think: Flips the knife point up on
Tips it for balance
Lobs a tomato
Slings the knife without looking, pins it to the wall, ---
Everyone goes silent
The knife, quivering
Caitlin and Hal turn as one, gaping at her
She shrugs numbly
Blinks
Uh
chefs do that

Water  through overhead pipes
Furnaces hum and tick in the sweaty gloom

Weeping
Before him, what looks like a young  model
Blonde
Gorgeous
Impeccably attired
For the record,
He looks his captive in the eye as the guy blubbers: Please, man
don't know why you gotta kill me
But use the gun, not the knife
Please
As a fucking favor, 'm begging you
It'll be over soon
Jesus, man
'm scared of the knife
Shit,  can't handle getting shots at the doctors, man,
Last chance
What do you know about a town called Santa Claus
What is this, *what the fuck is this*
'm , for Chrissake, you can't do this to me
don't know Timothy stares him full in the face, eyes narrowed
as though seeing into his brain
He nods, satisfied
No
You don't
(beat) can always tell, you know
If someone's lying to me
little skill of mine, something to trot out at parties
He slams home the knife
We don't see it, but we  the impact
The  man's face contorts in
Twisted
Inches away from Timothy, their eyes lock
Timothy reacts, annoyed
Plucks it from his belt and flips it open: Timothy
(
) Message from Mr
Daedalus
'm listening
He shrugs at his captive
Rolls his eyes
The guy's still dying, still on the
(
) He says he's sorry, but he needs you right away
Something's come up
Nix
'm just finishing up here
Then 'm going bunjee jumping
(
) He's aware of your weekend plans, and he apologizes
All right, what's so fucking important
(
) Your old colleague, One-Eyed Jack
Recently escaped from a high-security prison, as you're aware
But listen to this: prior to his escape, seems he saw something on  that disturbed him
So much he had to be sedated
saw it, too
It's called "Empty Nest
" How the fuck is it my business
(
) The man was overheard talking to himself under sedation
(beat) He said Charly Baltimore's alive, sir
Timothy is silent
know it's incredible, sir, but
if she were alive, 'm thinking she might be in contact with the old man in Pennsylvania
Should  -- Tap his phone, yes
And tell Daedalus 'm on my way
Timothy out
He clicks off, face troubled
Withdraws the knife
Checks his clothing
Not one speck of blood

They were on sale
At the next register over, a duo of Canadians throw looks her way
Confer in rapid-fire French, subtitled for us: #1 Ooh, j'aimerais la baiser
(Subtitle: 'd like to fuck her
) The checker looks up, smiles: Don't you love hearing people speak French
#2 Oui, j'veux etirer celle-la autour d'une chaise
Comme je le vois, une femme c'est comme Gumby avec des seins
(Subtitle: 'll stretch her over a chair, women are merely Gumbys with tits
) Beautiful language
He turns to Samantha -- except Sam isn't there
Her arm shoots out-
on one of the men
By the throat
Catches him like a fucking
Her voice a sibilant hiss: *Allez, Gumby etiriait le cou, fils de pute*
Subtitle: "Gumby's gonna stretch your neck, motherfucker
" Accent flawless
Eyes like steel
The man will go on to start a profitable construction business with the bricks he shits

You do
You bet your life, fluent French, whatever the fuck that means
(chortles) Quand j'etais a l'ecole, Jai eu un professeur qui s'est fabrique du dentifrice
You just said when you were in school, your teacher was made of toothpaste
Right, he was, you got a problem with that
Pasty Joe, we called him
Look, the accent's perfect, so piss off
'   , -
- Samantha and daughter  sing a hearty chorus of "Frere Jaques
" Sam giggles , Caitlin looks nervous; astride her new two-wheeler  while Sam finishes removing the training wheels
Caitlin points to her stuffed
Put Perkins in the basket
He's luck
Mr
Perkins, going in the basket
Are the training wheels off
Just pretend they're still there
Piece of cake
You can do it
Wait
'm scared
Shhh
Nothing to be scared of
Pretend you're one of the -men, you're tough
Let's go, now
Three, two, one
Mom,  can't do it, swear -- Samantha sets her sailing
Laughs excitedly
The bike weaves, side to side
hits the curb and topples with a
Spills Caitlin to the pavement
Now's she's
Ouch--
can't do it, it -
Samantha walks over briskly
Face set in determined lines
Nonsense
You can do it
You don't want to, but you can
My arm hurts, please take me home
You can go home, Caitlin
You can ride there
An unpleasant note is edging into her voice
The louder the kid cries, the more Samantha starts to
Mom, no
Look,  know you're afraid, that's the whole *point*, can you see that
Now stop being a little baby and get on the damn bike
She hoists her onto the seat
Caitlin cries and hollers
You gonna be afraid of things all your life
Huh
That what you want
My wrist hurts
*Snap*
Something lets go
Suddenly Samantha's right in her face: Life is pain
Get used to it
See, you *will* ride this bike home, princess
You will ride it and you will not fall again, *is that understood*
Eyes cold and lifeless
She is not herself
: '  - huddles on the steps, itching at her brand new Eavesdropping on her parents
In the kitchen a counter- top  is on, the Three Stooges
Samantha is on the phone, saying: Yes, 'm three blocks past the gas station
Right
Thank you Mr
Henessey, 'll see you shortly
She hangs up as   behind her
She doesn't turn around
Samples the topping of a cream pie
Stares at the linoleum floor
He regards her with angry, vindictive eyes: She rode all the way home
She didn't fall, not once
She didn't cry
(beat) You're good
You should work with kids, you know that
She said her wrist hurt
didn't know it was broken, God
can't even remember what  said to her
Hal takes a breath, composes himself
We can still make six o'clock mass, you coming
Sam surveys her perfect kitchen
Runs her hand over a hanging pot
Looks sadly at her husband
Whispers: private detective's coming by, he
he's found something
(beat) may have to go away
For a bit
Now please leave me alone
Go away
With a detective
Jesus, it's the holidays, Sam -- Are you deaf
said leave me alone
Go to church
Drink blood
Drink some for me
They stand in tableau
An electric silence
Broken quite suddenly by the sound of
Outside the front door
The sweet strains of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen" wafts in through the window
Except the sweet strains ain't so sweet
These carolers are Missing by a country octave
Sam and Hal look at each other, what the hell
-     - continue their interesting rendition
Snowflakes fall
All is quiet
All is bright
Especially bright is the pressed to the throat of the lead soprano
- 109
Over and under combo
Shotgun on top
cannon on bottom
You'd sing shitty too
- Samantha hurries to the door
Carrying a bowl of festive &'s
Just as she gets to the door, the singing
Footfalls running away, that's odd
She opens the door
Carolers, gone
She's eye to eye with -
- Evening Charly
Long time
He swings the big
Slams the barrel into her
Glass shatters, &'s everywhere
She gapes at him, dumbstruck, unable to
Hurry it up, lady, we need a decision, live or *die* -- Wrenches the gun
On the steps howls, eyes like saucers -- Mommy
Sam's cry is a veritable shriek
himself from the kitchen doorway
Pounces on Jack, snarling -- brave, useless
For his trouble, gets three broken ribs and a trip to the fireplace, airborne
Comes down
Catches fire
, over and over on broken ribs -- kicks Samantha in the gut
She collapses onto the stairs
Splinters the banister
That's when he sees
Top of the stairs, paralyzed
Jack is already moving forward
- the shotgun, draws a bead -- Promptly slips on festive &'s
Goes down
Gun goes off, -
flat concussion
The banister storm of wood chips, as  surges up the stairs, toward her daughter -- On the ground
Fires, *wham*--
The wall three inches from Caitlin's head
Blown to shreds, you can see outdoors
Samantha doesn't miss a beat
Grabs her daughter -- flings her
Through the hole in the wall
Takes her by the belt and fucking  her out into space
- Two stories up
The kid is ejected, flailing
Floats in Across a ten foot gap --
Sails head over heels into the place
Hits with a
Alive and unhurt
Samantha didn't even look
Didn't need to
Here comes
Up the staircase
Reloading
Samantha launches herself down the stairs
, head on -- Down they go
Jack, rolls to his feet
Propels her into the
- She hits, spray of cat food
Across the linoleum, slams to a stop
Hard
Cupboard pops open, out comes the Falls into place, --
disintegrates it
Reveals Sam, cowering behind
- want my eye back, bitch
Samantha struggles to her feet
Dazed
Jack abandons the shotgun
Takes the  down from its spot on the shelf -- Slams it against her head
- Goddamn you
Fight me
What's wrong with you, *fight* me
: Stooge Joe Besser mugs wildly, takes a pie in the face
Jack raises his arm for the killing stroke -- Samantha takes Hal's cream pie from the counter and shatters every bone in his face
Comes from nowhere
Back foot planted, body twisting, entire organism focused into the outstretched arm, -
We have never seen anyone move this fast
Samantha
Startled by what she's done -- The glass dish is  into his head
It  there
He topples
Hits the linoleum
She straddles him, breathing hard
Winded
The barking dog "Jingle Bells" plays inanely in the background
Samantha stares
Trembling
Pokes the body
Nothing
Pokes it again
Still nothing
She leans forward
Grips the neck and wrenches, -
Just making sure
She out of it
In shock
Glaring at her own hands as if demanding an excuse for their behavior
There is pie filling on her fingers
She kneels beside the corpse, catatonic
Stares
Absent-mindedly licks the bloodied cream
is standing in the doorway
Wide-eyed
He has seen Samantha break the man's neck
She looks at him, frowns
It took me three seconds
That's
that's good, huh
He stares, dumbstruck
She blinks
*Snaps out of it*
Caitlin
We gotta find Caitlin
She gets up
We  with her to the front door -- she flings it open and collides with
Private dick
Runs right into him
Hey--
Slow down
The kid's okay, she's in my car, what the hell is going on
Henessey spins, as    pull up
Vomit up a bevy of , swarming toward the house
He spins back to Samantha -- As she collapses to the floor
: Pause
Super the legend:
- '  - Early morning quiet
and  are throwing suitcases into the back of his battered Chrysler
-  - ' Sam's looked better
Kneels beside Caitlin, says softly: That man who tried to hurt us
If stay here
other people will come
have to leave
Just for a little while
Caitlin looks at the floor
Doesn't respond
Samantha reaches in a cupboard
Produces a box of
Lights a match, touches flame to one of them
want you to light a candle and keep it in the kitchen window
And never, *ever* let it go out, because as long as it burns
It means you're thinking of me
And if 'm alone
if it's dark and 'm lost
It's how 'll find my way home
She touches Caitlin's wrist cast
Pain in her features
She grabs a marker pen and writes a   on it
That's for a portable phone
keep it with me, you call me anytime, you don't worry about the bill
And last but not least -- She reaches behind her head
Unhooks the , the one she wears around her neck
For luck
Slips it over her daughter's head
Looks up at , eyes brimming
He whispers: No matter what you find, 'm not scared
Not of you
Not ever
: As it fades behind Henessey's Chrysler
Leaving behind porch- bound elders, dimestore clerks
Grinning children, hair like spun straw
All fading
: '  -    - Henessey sings with the radio
Loudly
He's got the lyrics wrong: "'m not talking 'bout the linen
And  don't wanna change your life
" Samantha endures as much as she can
Speaks up: "Movin' in
" Hah
It's not linen
The song's not about linen
Whatever
You cold
(shivers) 'm freezing
Turn on the heater
It doesn't work, but it makes a very annoying noise which distracts from the cold
'll pass
(clears her throat) So, you're a former cop
Atlanta, was it
Stop me if 'm out of line, but 'm curious
How did you
well, succeed
mean, where six other detectives failed
You kidding
Pure luck
Plus my secretary used her feminine wiles
She's got two, one wile per side
Huge
No kidding, you can see 'em coming around a corner, you got time to comb your hair
Nice kid, you'd dig her
(beat) Ah
Here we are
- As they clamber from the car, Henessey shoves his sunglasses into his sportcoat
: Putting my glasses in my cooooat
" Samantha looks at him like he's sprouted wings
sing what  do so 'll remember it
"Turning off the downstairs liiiight
" You know
Samantha smiles thinly
The man's a lunatic
- An old, walrus-mustached  ushers them down a concrete hallway
The old man hangs back with Henessey
Whispers: The elder Trelawney rented to her in '87, aye
Ne'er could bring himself to dispose of her things
'faith, she's welcome to whatsoe'er she wishes, for ne'er has trod these walls a lass so easy on the eye, divil take me if 'm lyin'
Henessey lights a cigarette, says: Do me a favor
Say, "Always after me Lucky Charms
" "Always after me Lucky Charms
" Thanks
Just needed to hear that
- Drab, musty
Filled with disused tables, lamps, farm implements
Jimmy Hoffa watches  in the corner
See anything you recognize
Yeah, this dirt used to be outside my window, shut up and let me look
(sighs) 'm sorry, Mr
Henessey, 'm a little on edge
She pauses
Surveys the musty compartment, faraway look in her eye
says softly: can feel her
Like a ghost
(beat) We could walk away, you know
There's still time, we could just
leave her dead
She hefts a  onto a bench
it -- Draws a sharp breath: Ay-i-yi
Clothes to kill for
Smooth velvet
Creamy silk
The finest, the best
The sexiest
Sam peeks at the tags: Size four, no way
You know how long it's been since  could wear a size four
(beat) Can't be mine
Can they
She checks the case for  --
Who
Henessey grunts
In his book, well dressed is clean underwear
Holds up a small manila envelope
Unmailed envelope
Addressed to a guy
What's in it
Another guy's address
Two addresses, is basically what 'm saying
Meanwhile, her hands, still pawing through the suitcase She feels it
At the bottom of the case
Lifts up the mound of fabric -- -40 sniper rifle
Disassembled
Sam looks like she just took a stomach punch
Up until now, it could've been adrenaline
She could still be just a schoolteacher
rifle, that changes everything
She plunks the clothing back in place
Hides it
Anything else in there
Hmm
Uh, no
Just
more clothes
Yeah, well take a look at this
He holds up the envelope: addresses to one *Nathan Windeman*
Fishes in his coat, brings out Samantha's
Written to him, earlier that day
identical handwriting
: - is in a bad mood
frail-looking man, mid- seventies
Tiredly spooning a bowl of soup
His sister watches  nearby
In her lap, a Pomeranian cleans itself
Windeman scowls: Alice, please
Alice stares at him
Uncomprehending
Your dog, Alice
It and my appetite are mutually exclusive
What's wrong with the dog
It's simple
He's been licking his asshole for three straight hours submit to you that there's nothing there worth more than an hour's attention, and  should think whatever he's attempting to dislodge is either gone for good or there to stay
*Wouldn't you agree*
Theatrical
Nah
The old bat scoops up her pooch and beats feet for the door
Nathan snatches it up: Hello
The voice is soft
Controlled: (
) Hello, Mr
Windeman,  got this number from a realtor in Pennsylvania
'd like to speak with you
Who
who is this
You tell me, Mr
Windeman
Nathan pales
Blinks once
Twice
Manages: Charly
(
) My full name, please
God, it really is you
Chapter, they think you're dead, *everyone* thinks -- *My full name*
Please
pause
Then: You don't know your name
He chews his lower lip, mind racing
Jesus, no joke, this is *her*
He fights to control his voice: Your full name
is Charlene Elizabeth Baltimore
- in shirtsleeves flips a switch
Speaks into a headset: Signal Daedalus
We just got her, she made contact
Initiating phone trace
- Charly, don't talk, just listen: We have to meet, understand
We have to meet *right away*
(
) Meet me off -79
Highmile exit, Salt & Pepper Lounge
Eleven a
m
She hangs up
Nathan stares, trembling
Turns to , standing in the doorway
Swallows hard, says: former student
is in trouble
- She hangs up the telephone in the ladies' room
Stands, alone in the stillness
Hands to her head, mind churning
Turns, checks to make sure the door is locked
Props her on the sink and opens it
Flips back the mound of clothing -- And there it is
The pieces, disassembled, of an -40 sniper rifle
Her trembling hands find the parts, seemingly of their own volition
Hefting them
Gauging their feel
And then, slowly
terrifyingly
Knowing how they go together
She  the barrel in place, *click*-
The sound breaks her reverie
She drops the thing like it's alive
Looks down, trembling
in the case: a wicked looking
She picks it up gingerly
Shiny, brand new
Turns it over in her hand, fascinated by the play of light off the blade
Looks up
Her , in the mirror
Staring back
She frowns -- It frowns
She turns away -- '
It stays right fucking put, except now it's *smiling*
Malignant
Deadly
Sam feels something wrong
Spins back toward the mirror -- Her reflected arm comes through the looking glass
Reaches into Sam's world and
-  - Samantha , comes awake in the passenger seat of Henessey's Plymouth
Bad dream
Looks over to see if he noticed -- he's honking his horn at a
Sea of taillights, dead ahead
What's this
What the hell is this
We don't have time for this, of all the cocksucking bullshit -- Whoa
Ms
Class, drive a little truck on the side, do you
What are you, a Mormon
No, ma'am, it's just that
well, when we met you're all, "Oh, fooey, burned the darn cupcakes
" Now, you go into a bar, ten minutes later sailors come running out, they can't take it
Just then,    blow by, sirens screaming
Henessey frowns, puzzled
What the hell
Lemme check the scanner
He switches on a police band radio
Listens, hears: (
) without endangering the hostages, over
Roger that two-niner confirmed, he's on a fuse, please provide backup, over
Conneaut, 'm waiting on Special Weapons, sorry, over
-  ,
- , spinning
Cop cars, incoming
to a halt
Disgorging uniformed cops
is rapidly surrounded
Its a cheery decor, the giant roofbound Santa, all in stark contrast -- To the  we hear, dimly, from within
- Hostage drama, unfolding
The perp's a big ugly meatloaf with his mitts on a waitress
She's sixteen, she's a baby
She's sucking the barrel of his shotgun
His finger on the trigger
From outside, we hear the : (
) , , ,
Mr
Shotgun snorts laughter
Does a little dance, yells: 'm the man
'm the man
elicit the explicit
- The police are just starting to re-route traffic
highway cop signals to , "Turn around, go back
" - Henessey swears
Swings wide, when suddenly a  clutches his arm
He looks over and suppresses a shiver -- Samantha's eyes have gone dead and cold
She lights a cigarette, shakes out the match and says: Go up this hill
Why
*Drive up the fucking hill*
Now Henessey shivers
Cranks the wheel as we  : -   - flops on the frozen ground in a stand of pine trees
Where the shit did you get that
No answer
She deftly assembles the
Rests the rifle barrel on a dead branch
Flicks on the starlight scope
Sam, Goddammit, you're gonna kill someone
Hey
She ignores him
Focuses through the scope
: Framed in spectral , the diner's interior
Hostages
Crying mothers
Children, catatonic
Through a tiny window -- a limited view of the
He's in there
Girl, eating both barrels
Samantha's jaw tightens
The diner
That's half a mile away, are you fucking crazy
-40 assault rifle
At three hundred yards, vertical drop six inches
Mr
Shotgun leans in
something to the waitress
Shit
He's gonna do the girl
How the fuck can you tell
She steadies the rifle
Takes aim
read lips
She fires
Splintered -
Mr
Shotgun dies on his feet
Outgoing matter
Flung
Spattered on the grill where it sizzles along with burnt hamburger
He drops
Screams
Pandemonium
- Samantha slams the trunk of the Chrysler
Gets in the passenger side without a word
Henessey pulls away
-  - Samantha stares straight ahead
Gives a high, brittle laugh
See
Took care of it
Knew  could
She laughs again
Henessey favors her with a look reserved for people with major deformities
Suddenly she says: Pull over
He stops the car
She gets out
Stumbles across the shoulder
Kneels
Throws up
Henessey watches
Lights a smoke with trembling hands
Had to, he
he would've killed her
Had to
Oh God  took him, such a good shot
felt proud of it, such a shot, Jesus, *how could be proud*
(sobs) 'm scared
want to go home
Henessey kneels beside her awkwardly
She clutches his shoulder
Presses her head to his chest
Cries
-  - Yes, it certainly is
: - Three stories below the White House proper
is seated in his robe and slippers
Before him sits a panel of three: National Security Adviser; Deputy Director of the ; and   in his sixties, sporting a distinguished mane of silver hair
The President addresses him: *Mister Perkins*
(frowns) Please, say it again, 'm a little slow
Better yet, 'll try it
You lost an operative, a trained counterassassin, and you just saw her on  in a Christmas parade
The silver-haired man appears unperturbed
And no, by the way, it didn't escape us that he shares his surname with Caitlin's  , the one Mom named -- He nods, says: - On , that's correct
It's two weeks old, intelligence just caught it
You recruited this woman in the late seventies
- For Chapter, yes
was a friend of her father's, you see, and
took her in
Well, it looks like she returned the favor, now doesn't it
(throws up his hands) Unbelievable
You people, you dump this on me, then next week you're screaming, "Where's our funding
" Shit
'll tell you where it is, can you say health care
The head of the  pipes up: Mr
President, please calm down
The bears no responsibility for this problem
Thanks for sharing, Kent
How many double agents you got on the payroll, last count
Sir
That controversy has been thoroughly dealt with, and if there still exists a leak, perhaps this
woman agent of his -- - If  may, sir, Colonel Baltimore hasn't had classified access since 1987
(beat) But thank you, Kent, for trying to fuck me in the ass
He directs his baleful gaze at the President
Lights a pipe
- 'm afraid rooting out double agents may have to wait
The primary threat is the woman
Her specialty is counterassassination, a horseshit turn of phrase which implies the other fellow shot first, but in point of fact she's a takeout artist of the first order
Nearly disposed of our friend the Beard down in Cuba a few years back
Specializes in long rifles, accurate to a mile and a half
Presumed dead; now, after eight years, back in the field, agenda unknown
She knows enough to hurt us
'm frightened
Understand
Yes, yes
believe you
Just one question: (beat) *What in pluperfect hell is she doing in a Christmas parade*
- Henessey is on the phone to his ex-wife
Glowering
Aw, cut me a break, Fran
been out eight months, 'm back doing skip traces, now you got me stealing fuckin' bicycles
- (
) don't want you around Todd, hear me
Shrink told me what those men did to you in prison
This is a Christian household, my son's not gonna develop any
tendencies
Understand
For a moment her ignorance is so stunning he's speechless
Then he slams down the phone
Cracks it
Returns to the pumps, where  leans against his car, still dazed
Looks up at him, says: still can't believe it
You're saying my hands didn't even shake
Henessey doesn't look at her
Puts the nozzle back in the pump
Crosses to the driver side without a word
What's the matter with you
You
You're the matter
Look, you wanna keep going, good luck
'm driving back to Ohio
You're free to come with me
What
what are you telling me
He gets into the car
Starts the engine
Samantha reacts, distraught
Leans in, kills the ignition
Pulls him out of the car
Goddammit, lady, 'm taking you *home*
She slaps him
He falls back, stunned
'll spell it out for you, ready have no future, * can't go home*
Until  know what's happening, 'm in *prison*, you know how that feels
Yeah, matter of fact
Four years inside
Marion, Illinois, real shithole
Get in the car
'm sorry
(clears her throat) Um
what did you
Seven years ago, Atlanta
Me and my partner, we handled a lot of impounded shit
Fucker hated me, boy
One weekend, when he was conveniently gone
Some bearer bonds disappeared from his office
And lo and behold, when the police responded to an anonymous tip, you'll never guess what just happened to be sitting in my closet
The bonds
Your partner put them there
(laughs) Hell no,  did,  stole the fucking things
He serious
Samantha frowns, a little thrown -- Then she snorts, loses it
They both lean against his Chrysler
Now every dollar  hand my kid, he asks his mother did  steal it
He smiles ruefully
Spits
pause, then: No more killing
Samantha's voice is cool and level: No more killing
She blows her nose
It was a helluva shot, wasn't it
" : -  &   - gunmetal grey sky looms overhead
The aforementioned is a faded old roadhouse, gravel parking lot strewn with mud- covered trucks
The kind that get a man laid in these parts
'  pulls into the lot, rolls to a halt
He'll never get any
&   - Honky-tonk
and  enter, blinking in the dimness
Around them, drunk mid-day cowboys
Stringy-haired girls in their ample laps
consults her watch: Quarter til
Any time now
They sit at the counter
Henessey flags the bartender
Signals for a beer
Lights a cigarette, blows smoke: Nice crowd
You're just jealous of their girlfriends
Who wouldn't be
Corner booth, there's a beaut
While you're doing her doggie- style you can pop the zits on her back
Samantha shoots him a look
above the bar, a British- sounding  announcer is saying: (
) Violence in Northern Ireland continues today, despite a plea by British prime minister John Major -- Samantha sits up straight
Draws a sharp breath
He shoots her a questioning look -- just
got a flash of something, (blinks) hurt my father
Whoa
You remember your father
No
that's what's strange
(shakes her head) If  saw him on the street, wouldn't
oh
She rubs her eyes
Her voice breaks
She's utterly miserable
Henessey leans in, says softly: Ms
Caine, last week at a party ran into a girl  knew from college and we chatted for a few minutes
And it wasn't til  was driving home on the freeway that  remembered that 'd screwed her in the back of a car once
(beat) Everyone forgets
He pats her arm
Smiles reassuringly
pause
She stares
That's it
That's your helpful story
Jesus Christ
No, see, all's 'm saying is you're not alone
Oh, shut up
Fine
gotta use the head
He stands, heads off
Samantha nervously lights a cigarette
The bartender suddenly puts a  in front of her
She reaches for her purse
He waves it away, points beside her
She turns
The assassin called  sits down two stools away
For you
Another in a long line of bad investments
Excuse me
Just saw the ring on your finger
He reveals a surprisingly  smile, says: Do  know you from somewhere
Grimaces: Whoa
Back up
Total pickup line, let's forget  said that
Still staring in her eyes
Noting absolutely on her features
She gives him a cursory smile
Thanks for the drink
But no
don't know you
Timothy nods slowly
No, you don't, do you
'd know if you did
can tell if someone's lying
(smiles) Sorry to bother you
He takes his own drink and crosses to a back booth
Sits, a very puzzled look on his face
Adjusts his coat collar, whispers into a concealed transmitter: Okay, people,  got what  needed
Wait until she comes out
Then do them both
(beat) Walk soft, we got local law
He sits back as  '  suddenly enter, doffing their stetsons
Cross to the bar
, coming out of the bathroom
Sees the deputies
Grabs  by the elbow
Tosses down a fin, steers her toward the door
(sotto) What are you doing
Pork
On your nine
So
So you shot a guy in the head yesterday
We wait outside
It's freezing
Too bad
People shouldn't shoot other people in the head
Just themselves
During that show with the little girl who's a robot
&   - They emerge into the chill air
Breath pluming from their mouths
Samantha surveys the parking lot
Grabs Henessey, points -- -  pulls into the gravel lot
Stops
Bingo
That's an old guy's car
How do you know
Because there's an old guy in it
Come on
They cross toward the car
She frowns, points to his coat
Gun bulge
You think 'm gonna shove it down my pants
Shoot my damn dick off
So now you're a sharpshooter
Ho, ho
As they approach the other car, the engine stops
The door opens and a middle aged man emerges --  '
He pauses, lighting a cigarette
Mr
Windeman
She strides right up, Henessey in tow
Flashes a dazzling smile -- *Slow motion*
The guy   , darts a hand inside his coat with practiced ease
Pulls out a Oh,
*Slow motion*
Samantha tackles Henessey
Hurls them both to the ground
During their fall,  : She clutches his sportcoat -- Grips his
38 special and squeezes
sharp report, -
Another, -
The jacket, shredded
just caught two in the chest
He goes over backwards, gun spitting -- Sam and Henessey hit the ground
*Back to regular speed*
Henessey rolls over, stunned
Samantha's staring at her hand, wondering how in the hell it just did that
*Jesus wept*
They scamper to their feet
Running hellbent for leather toward the Plymouth
They never make it
steps calmly from the trees
Stands at the shoulder of the highway, full view of the parking lot
Adopts a two-fisted stance
Draws a bead, locks on target -- Leaves his feet
Takes to the air as a    swerves off the highway with no advance warning and  the bastard, wham--
The car roars across the lot,   at the wheel
- The snapped-in-two hitman announces Nathan's arrival by in an explosion of glass
Caroms off a table and bounces head over heels
Hits, dead
swears
Leaps up and bolts for the door, right behind the ' , as - The black Le Sabre  to a stop, showering gravel -- shouts at Sam and Henessey: Get in
Both of you,
They pile into the backseat
Nathan floors it
, bouncing  onto the highway -- and meanwhile here comes On the run
Barks into his transmitter: East, they're going east
*Head them off*
He begins to run: we have never seen anyone run this fast
'  - kicks in the afterburners
Squinting, can't see
, squeaking to and fro
Erasing the hitman's blood
Henessey is trembling; Samantha comatose
Nathan steals a look in the rear view mirror
Gets his first good view of Samantha
Reacts, stunned: Charly
Jesus Christ,  don't believe what 'm seeing, you're so *fat*
This is not what she expected to hear
'm
um,  mean
what
What in God's hell have you been *eating*, you look positively bovine
Hang on
50 yards down the highway
Beside a parked car, a guy with an
Oh, God, no more--
The big rifle  concussively
The car window
Does not break
Bulletproof
Put it in myself
Almost as an afterthought, he swerves slightly
the gunman against the parked car
Shatters him
His goes by an inch from Samantha, he coughs blood onto her window
- Timothy, on the move
, breakneck through the woods
Jumps fallen logs
Ducking, swerving
In and out through the trees, as '  - Scenery whips past
In the backseat, Henessey is trembling; Samantha comatose
Nathan snaps his fingers sharply: Charlene, darling -- My name is Caine
Samantha Caine
(exasperated) Yes, yes, you said that on the phone
*Must*  point out to you that the letters in the name  , when rearranged, spell out
Your mind was missing a name, so it simple invented one that was an anagram of your current condition
Samantha reacts, floored
Dammit, Charly
The schoolteacher, that was your cover
Your memory was gone, you got confused and you This ridiculous Ohio housewife business, it's a fantasy, you *wrote* the bloody thing
It's not a fantasy, *'m in the fucking *
Then quit
You're an assassin for the United States government
(beat) ought to know,  trained you
Henessey is so shocked he's : Beautiful
Fuckin' beautiful
-   - forty foot embankment, damn near vertical
Plunging to the road below
Topped by a chain-link
Timothy hits the fence at a dead run
Up and over
Pitches head over heels down the embankment,
Hits bottom in a shower of dirt, rolls, comes up
357  in a two- fisted grip, and *there's Nathan's car*
Blows by, doing 90
Timothy swivels calmly,     at the retreating car
Shot after shot, like a machine -- '  - Sam  as the side windows
Nathan rides the wheel, swerving
*What happened to bulletproof*
*The side windows were next,  swear*
Watching them go
Oh, well
He tried, right
Did his best, tomorrow's another day -- Without missing a beat, Timothy walks out in the middle of the road
, coming
Sports car
He snaps in a fresh clip
Raises his fist and   through the fast- approaching windshield
Kills the driver
The car throws a skid
Slewing  at him
Onrushing juggernaut, immense
He vaults the hood without breaking stride
Catches the drive- side doorhandle, jerks -- then he's in, and out comes the corpse and the car *never stops moving*
Completes an out-of-control 360, showering muddy water
and then he's stomping the gas
Utterly relentless
Leaving behind a wet and very surprised-looking corpse
Timothy  , eyes locked dead ahead on the Le Sabre -- Hears a
Whips his eyes to the rearview mirror: Fishtailing onto the road behind him
Falls in behind,  wailing
One of the deputies from the bar
'  -  - Nathan fishes a gun from his coat
Hands it to Samantha
Here, you might as well have one too
My God
How many do you carry
Three
One shoulder, one hip, and one right next to Mr
Wally -- (pats his groin) Where most patdowns never reveal it, as an agent is often reluctant to feel up another man's groin
Henessey looks out the back windshield, says: Got a tail
Nathan looks,
The chase car's gaining on them
Lucky bastard found the only cool car in the fucking midwest
He accelerates into a curve
Rockets past a connecting road, as, without warning --    skids out of the side road, after him
The other deputy
, boxed
Going too fast, swerves
into the deputy headlong
him
Glass flies
The cop car's blow out as it's  180 degrees
Timothy's car careens into a  -- -
Hits a dead stop
Hood shears off, goes flying
Back end sticking up, tires spinning
The horn blares continuously
: The other cop arrives, brakes to a halt -- Door opens and out he comes
Helps Deputy #2 clamber from his crippled black-and-white
Together they leap down into the gulley, guns drawn
Cringing as the long  continues unabated
Approaching the crashed car
Walking up, guns at their sides
They jitter and twitch
Topple over dead, slide to the bottom of the gulley
, we see that a very annoyed Timothy is also very conscious
Splayed against the driver's side door
Holding one hand down on the horn,
He releases it
Horn stops
On the radio Conway Twitty is singing
He puts a shot through the radio
Silences it
Climbs from the car and stares off down the road
Of Nathan and his companions, there is neither whisper nor breath
- Nathan has pulled over in a grove of pine trees
The car is covered with branches
He watches through a gap as two police cars go by on the distant highway
Your father was in the British , assigned to the Irish situation
After he was murdered in 1971, his friend Perkins recruited you for Chapter, a black bag operation working out of the
State Department
Charly is overloaded
Trying to keep up, not wanting to: Fall, 1987: Presidential orders come down
You're to flush out a terrorist by the name of Daedalus
You never complete the mission, electing instead to die, of all things, despite clear orders to the contrary
And dead you remain until, without preamble, you re-emerge, eight years later and fifteen pounds heavier
Would you lay off the weight
think we can safely assume Daedalus is aware of your resurrection and is attempting to reverse it
*Damn*, can't drive around in this thing
(beat) Any idea where we can go to stash this car
' Her fingers unconsciously fiddle with something
Damp, crumpled
The
One address left
This address
recognize it now
think it belongs to a friend
Henessey stares at her
As Nathan reaches for the envelope, his coat falls open and Samantha ; his left side is soaked with blood
Perhaps you'd best drive
- The house is actually an old converted
Beyond it, frozen landscape stretches to the lakeshore
In the , a scruffy looking   is splitting logs on a tree stump
Drops the axe
Scoops up an armload of firewood
Comes around the corner -- Drops the logs, startled
approaches
, sweating
Pasty
Levels a revolver
Samantha says: Don't be afraid, we don't want to hurt you
(beat) just want to know who you are
Seeing her, his eyes go wide -- He locks her in a whooping , shouts: ,
Picks her up,   around, laughing
Henessey and Nathan stare
Befuddled
- The strange man (let's call him ) stands awkwardly in the dooryard
Shifting from foot to foot
watches him dispassionately from the tree stump
Gun on his knee
(sighs) Look, is this America's Funniest Practical Videos or something
The  bangs open and Samantha comes out of the house
Carrying bandages
Alcohol
Crosses to the tree stump, kneels before Nathan
His voice is a harsh rasp: Let me do it
He bats her away, administers his own first aid
pipes up, exasperated: can't believe you don't remember dating me
Charly, please, you pursued me for months
Yeah, well
caught you and forgot you
Sorry
It's December, you'll remember
Right
He chuckles
Looks at her face
Stops chuckling, takes a sudden interest in the ground
Sam crosses to , standing nearby
Takes him aside, whispers: (sotto) This is ridiculous
What do we do with this guy
Don't ask me,  just work here
Did you bump pelvises with him or not
It's possible
And you kid, Cathead -- Caitlin
Yeah, whatever
Um, could he be the
don't know
(beat) It's coming back, though
All these
little details about him
She studies Luke
Frowning
Concentrating
know he's got a pin in his leg, car accident
know he cuts his own hair
thinks Rush Limbaugh's an ass
know he sits down when he pees
know -- Enough
You're giving me a stiffy
Just then  is hit with a dreadful-sounding cough
It wracks him
Doubles him up
blurts out: Goddammit, he's *dying*
Let me call the poor bastard an ambulance
Nathan grits his teeth: *No ambulance*
The car  ordered will be here soon
Mr
Windeman, please let him help you
know this man,
'm pretty sure  slept with him
Nathan presses a bandage to his side
'm about to faint
And if you call an ambulance,  will fucking kill you
He pitches forward into Henessey's arms
- - Beside the lakeshore    walk side by side
to the porch:  is laid out on a chaise lounge
Henessey beside him, applying cold compresses
The older man stirs, coming awake
Tries to sit up, Henessey nudges him flat again
Where's Charly
Relax
She's with Luke
That's his name, Luke
Goddammit,  told you -- Yeah, yeah, we weren't real big on what you told us
had him call you an ambulance, so shoot me
Should be here within fifteen minutes
Nathan groans
Henessey presses a cloth to the man's head
The guy's story checks out
Sam knows things about him
Stuff only a lover would know
Sod that
just watch them
Don't worry about it
Chick signs my checks, 'm gonna watch her get aced
Lie back down
Nathan swallows
Grimaces
Lies back down
Checks
You're not fooling anyone, dear boy
(bemused) You'd wash her feet and drink the water
wouldn't you
Cut me a break, nimrod
She's married with a kid
Busted
Nathan coughs
Speaks, eyes faraway: My star pupil
(smiles thinly) That man in Pennsylvania yesterday
The one at the diner, that was hers, wasn't it
How'd you know
(nods) saw the news report, they found a shell casing a thousand yards away, helluva shot
Tell me about Daedalus, what's his story
Arms broker, man without a face
Veteran of Baader-Meinhoff and the Red Brigades
He's rumored to be based in the
Doesn't travel much, they say
Too afraid of metal detectors, the poor sod's got a foot- long piece of steel in his leg
At which point, Henessey stops
Frowns
Come again
pin, Mr
Henessey
surgical pin
He scuffs his shoe in the porch dust
Eyes narrowed: Where the hell
know  just heard that somewhere, something about a
His eyes widen: Oh, fuck
Points to the lake: Nathan, that son of a bitch has one in *his* leg
Nathan freezes, thoughts racing
swears violently: You blithering idiot, the son of a bitch wasn't her lover, he was her target, he's Daedalus
Oh, Jesus
That's how she knew all that shit, not from *dating* him -- she *studied* the fucker to take him out
He takes off for the lake at a dead run
Behind him, the bloodied Nathan  himself to his feet and lurches off the porch, stumbling
Weaving
Refusing to go down
-- Luke walks behind Samantha
Talking softly in her ear, smiling
She hears something noise, drawing closer, hmmm
Looks up
Wishes she hadn't -- is descending over the lake
Inside, shoulders a bolt action rifle, coolly professional
, kicks up dirt at Henessey's feet
Stops the fucker cold
On the shore,  smiles at Samantha, says: Sure don't look like an ambulance, does it
Drops her to the ice like a broken doll
: Black indeed
Deep
Empty
Out of the darkness, we hear a Voice scratchy
Indistinct
Far away or long ago
fills the screen
Black and white
Grainy
The legend: ,  , over footage of a sidewalk bombing
We're back in time, the year 1971
crisp- looking  is speaking to the off-camera reporter: the bombing has been linked to the Ulster Volunteer Force, which, as you know, is the counterpart of the provisional  and the most violent of the Protestant Paramilitary groups
An 's face replaces him: Despite threats of reprisals, Brigadier Baltimore repeats that he will seek to cut  supply lines, especially from Tripoli, Lybia
President Nixon concurs that
battered , volume turned low
Snoozing in a chair, a rumpled older man -- It's the , the one we just saw speaking on
on the table identifies the date as June 23, 1971
Girlish decor
Pinups of rock stars
is awake, dressed and currently stuffing two pillows under a blanket
She inspects her handiwork
Human-looking lump
Turns, satisfied
One last look at the   on the wall -- Creeps from the room
Past the sleeping Brigadier
To the front door
She checks over her shoulder, nervous
Taps out five digits
Shuts off the alarm
Unlocks the door and slips out
-  - The boy's name is
Sixteen, with a quick, easy grin
Huddled beneath a tree with him, the girl is gelatin
You've never made it with a boy, then
There's nothing odd about it
'm only sixteen
Rubbish
What
You're fourteen and not a day more
Here now, 'm right, you're blushing
Look, what if 'm ignorant
It's my father, we never stay in one place, never meet bloody anyone
Saw him on the telly
Think he'd kill me
'm a nasty one,  am
He slides a hand under her sweater
She stiffens, terrified and exhilarated, as he gently strokes her nipple with a thumb
You know what, 'll bet you've never even kissed a boy
now, have you
(beat) Aye, but you want to
He leans in
She leans forward
jerky, tentative duckling on the road to swan-dom
Their lips touch
Across the road,     in her father's flat
She spins, scream caught in her throat -- as   rush from the house
Through the door, the one she left unlocked
Stutter of
She whirls on Gregory, realizes only then that the guy is
Thanks for shutting off the alarm, you bloody Papist bitch
He slaps her full across the face
Tell the press the Ulster Force claims full credit
He spins and flees
'  - Girl, moving
Walls racing past, shot to , run run run into her bedroom and  to a stop, screaming: **
Propped against the wall
By the bed
He's still alive
Incredibly
The man has  himself in here
He refused to die, simply couldn't, you see
Not until he reached his daughter
Two pillows, jammed beneath a blanket
The Brigadier just stares at them
His face slack
White and gastly
Shifts his gaze to his daughter
Tears running from his dulled eyes
How much
He raises the pistol to his head
did they pay you
He fires
On a young girl's dissolve into insanity we Sound, echoing away
Blackness, total
: - Waking is slow
Samantha opens her eyes
Blinks
Hazy, out of focus
Tries to rub her eyes, can't
Hands
Something's wrong, what the hell'd she do with her hands
Ah
They're stretched over her head
Suddenly she's very awake
The basement of the old converted mill
drafty, windswept place full of old, broken timbers
river runs through it
stream, at any rate
The waters are still and frozen now
Above the stream --
Smaller corollary of the wheel outside
Mounted on the same axis
is tied to that wheel
Lashed to its , affixed to it like a goddess to a Greek sailing ship
Now the bad news, the ice has been chopped away so the wheel can
And it will plunge Samantha
Beneath the ice
Bound hand and foot
Strapped to the wheel, wearing only a nightgown, she is utterly helpless
( Luke) stands before her, giving instructions to the ubiquitous
He looks up at Samantha
Seeing her eyelids flutter, he tosses her a cherry wave
Gone is the gee-whiz country boy schtick; in its place, a frightening arrogance
He tosses her his cheeriest wave: Well, good afternoon
If it isn't the forgetful spy
How you feeling
Not-so fresh
Samantha struggles against her bonds
No dice
Subsides
Takes a look around at her predicament
stands at the edge of the ice
Watching her intently
Smiles thinly: You
you're
the man from the bar
Look at her
She's not faking it, she doesn't know me from Adam
Daedalus shakes his head, frowning: It's not that  don't trust my compatriot, Colonel Baltimore
In fact,  had every confidence that your amnesia was genuine -- until you showed up *here*
You follow
(beat) Meanwhile,  just got around to reading the papers, there's the small matter of an incident upstate
Long range rifle shot, blew a man out of his socks
(coldly) You can see where 'm coming from
'm trying to pull of the biggest job of my career
have to know
How much you really remember
and who you've told
didn't tell a soul,  swear
We'll soon know
He crosses toward a large
Set into a wooden beam
Samantha thrashes at the bindings
Looks down at the water where it intercepts the mammoth wheel
Fighting panic: Is
is this a torture thing
Torture, yes
The torturing of beautiful women, albeit politically incorrect, is an addiction with me
(beat) woman never looks quite so beautiful as when her face is distended in pain
Witness the beauty of childbirth
Please, 'm getting all misty
Look, untie me, 'll make any face you want
Let's not, and say we did
Do you smoke
Smoke
Um, no
Not
not really
Good
You'll last longer
Now hush yourself, and take a deep breath
We're gonna do the torture thing
He hits the button
An electric  --
Feet first into the water
Struggling
Arms stretched above her head
She plunges below the surface
new dimension in Frozen, mind-numbing
She  against the wheel
It's like a crushing  is ripping her limb from limb
She opens her eyes, briefly
Discovers she's not alone --  mere foot from her face, of the drowned
Staring away and away
Blue with cyanosis
Meanwhile, back   : Daedalus turns to his right- hand man, who says: We're running on schedule,  just secured the tanker
We're borrowing it from Carbide in South Carolina
Cargo listed as fire retardant
(nods) Juice up the bird, we head out soon as 'm done here
He turns
Hits the red button again
reverses itself
Creaks and moans, turning -- Gasping for air
Wheezing
Choking
The   plasters the nightgown to her
Take all the air you can, that's right
If you need to vomit, do it now
Samantha, face twisted
Coughs
Wheezes
looks her in the eye
shakes his head: You don't remember *at all*
The greatest night of your life, shit, drown this ungrateful wench
He exits
Daedalus, alone with his captive
On her features, unbridled
He chuckles: Talk to me Colonel
Is my identity safe
The truth, and 'll shoot you in the head
Nice and quick
Otherwise, you're in for a long night
*Who did you talk to*
Nobody
fuck you
He shakes his head, makes a "tsk tsk" gesture
Smiles grimly as he turns his attention to the red switch
Hate to see you like this, Charly heard you were a helluva spy once
Without warning, her head snaps upward -- Eyes cold
Voice, not her own: Watch your back
'm not done yet
That's a very funny joke
You're an entertaining woman
Good night
He hits the button
She plunges beneath the surface
Daedalus walks over to one corner
Sits down
Takes out a pipe
Lights it
Picks up a book
Reads
And reads
-- Sam  and jerks, to and fro
Dead Nathan, mocking her
There, under the water, the memories come
In a flood
Stark and vivid
- opens, revealing a patch of night sky
Mostly obscured by two familiar individuals -- There's - , remember him
Few years younger
One eyeball heavier
The other man is
He looks in the trunk
Nods
Okay, 'll signal Daedalus
Your money will be waiting, and Jack
Do yourself a favor, do her and dump her, 'm serious
Don't get cute, try to play doctor first
made that mistake
The lid
The world of rushing , memories unspooling now, faster and faster -- :   overlooking the ocean
Darkness
Sheeting rain
Our heroine (for it is unquestionably ) is lying unconscious atop a rocky bluff
Drenched
-  produces a  from a leather case
Rolls up her sleeve
Starts to administer the injection
Stops
He can't resist
Can't help  the buttons on her shirt
Her eyes snap open
And before it even registers, she's grabbed the hypodermic and plunged it deep    -- Then she's up and running
Along the cliff, toward the car
Jack,  in pain, stumbling
Draws his gun and shoots her
In the head
She pitches backward
Tumbles from the cliff
Rushes headlong toward the waters below, getting smaller -- - Here
Now
She breaks the surface
Gasping for breath
, a sound ripped from her by the , the  -- By her ruptured sanity
She hangs there
Drenched
Half frozen
can't help it
chill dances up his spine, watching
She is not afraid
She is not whimpering
She is looking directly
With a sick smile
Daedalus
Make you a deal
Let me go now
'll leave you the use of your legs
Bargain, trust me
Daedalus struggles to recover his poise
How did you find me
Who knows about this place,
Charly's eyes bore into his: let you touch me, cowboy
think need a bath
Daedalus stabs the red button
Into the water goes Charly
Going down for the third time
-  - Here we are again, in the world of silence and blinding
Despair and madness but now there's something else -- Now there's
It takes losing most of the  from her right wrist
But she frees the hand
it loose
The water turns soupy red around it
, blindly
Fingers , so fucking cold -- Breath, running out
No air
She darts her right hand forward
Toward the obscenely bobbing of Nathan
Does something grotesque, jams her hand '  -- Hideaway gun, it's right where he said, right beside Mr
Wally
-25
Semi-auto, steel jackets
She waits
Rage inside her
Death in her hands
, The wheel
Groans
The terrorist in the western boots watches her emerge, face first -- She comes up firing
The first slug takes him in the knee
Blows it to scraps
He collapses, howling
She shifts aim
No hesitation
-
Hits it
Stops the wheel
Incredible
Doesn't blink
Unties her captive hand the wood surrounding her feet
Leaps to solid ground, as Daedalus looks up from his prone position
In agony
vision from Hell approaches:  fiendish blue-skinned woman in a sodden nightgown
Blood leaking from one wrist
She has risen, , from the icy waters
Samantha
Please
Who's Samantha
She shoots him in the other knee
He
Gun, empty
She tosses it aside
In a nearby crate:
Snatches up a Kalashnikov and clip
Kneels and says: You see in the movies, badguy says, "Talk to me and 'll let you live
" We're gonna run a variation, it goes like this: Talk to me
'll let you die
She fires again
Where's Henessey
- The detective lies naked, bound hand and foot
Beaten
single ray of  through a tiny crack
He hears a  noise, as if a door's been ripped from its hinges
Pause --   of gunfire
Shouts, cries
heavy weight  to the floorboards above him
Through a crack comes a tiny stream of , dribbling onto him, as -- - bolts from the house, clutching a bleeding hand
Running hellbent for leather
Reaches a parked car
Leaps in and kicks over the engine as, behind him -- come piling out of the house, shouting
Running for their cars -- never make it
Wracked by gunfire, bodies twitching
And as Timothy  , spraying mud, we pull , , Into the sky, moving ever higher, gunfire fading
Until now we're  , we can see Timothy's car
the , ever so tiny below us
It blows to pieces
Sends flaming boards flying -   - The door bursts open as  stalks in, shedding his coat
His aide -- let's call him  -- looks up nervously
This can't happen, Harry
The President's already up at night, prowling his sock drawer for double agents, and now we've got a fucking rogue on our hands
Sir, there's someone in the conference room to see you
Oh, for the love of Christ, who can be so fucking important
He throws open a door off the passage: '
Perched on the edge of a conference table, tamping a pack of smokes
Perkins reacts, stunned
It's me, your poor black cousin
The one you can't be seen with
*You*
Are you crazy, coming here
(Lights a cigarette) My boss is dead
What
Your rogue bitch just took him out
Probably went shopping in his weapons storage too
He blows smoke
Trains his eyes on the older man
Piercing
We're still on, Perkins
've got the tanker, the chemist, all ready to go
but you gotta contain her, man
We gotta step on her hard and fast
An agent on the  calls out: You have a call on line three, sir
Who is it
Charly Baltimore, sir
Perkins stops dead
Lunges for the phone, nearly drops it: Perkins
- We only see her mouth
Set in hard, grim lines
She says: It's cold,  want to come in
Charly
Oh, my God, what the hell are you *doing*
Listen to me, 'm going to direct you to a safe house, get you on a plane -- Can the bullshit, 'm not telling you where  am
'll come in for a full debriefing, but we do it my way
Charly, you're being paranoid
It's not like it used to be, you're eight years out of date
Do tell
Congress won't authorize a dime, Charly
Chapter's on the way out, we've been reduced to a records- keeping agency, we *don't have enough money to kill you*, understand
Fuck you, Perkins
If you want me dead, you'll pass a hat in the typing pool to buy bullets
We do things my way
Your way,  see
And if  say go to hell
From where  stand, it ain't much of a commute
You'll hear from me
She clicks off
Perkins darts a look at the techie -- guy shakes his head, no go on the trace
Perkins swears
She mustn't threaten our success
Contain her, whatever it takes
But be *careful*
If it gets out you're working for me
we'll both be grabbing our ankles on the White House lawn
-  ,   - There
Thank you, New Jersey, that'll be all
You can go now
Um, please
-   - Waking is slow for Mitch Henessey
He swallows dryly
Eyes creak open, struggle to focus
Hears  running shower
Squints at his watch
He's not wearing a watch, he knew that
In , naked
Chest swathed in bandages, what the hell
He pokes them
Jerks his head, hissing in pain
-   - Henessey lights a smoke at the bar
Flicks the match in a trashcan
Starts to go, stops
Reaches into the can
Plucks out a tiny scrap: , ripped in two
photo of Hal and Caitlin
He pockets it, disturbed
Crosses to the bathroom door
The shower has stopped
Raises a tentative hand, starts to knock
It
There, in a thin silk robe, is a , swabbing at her hair
She breezes out of the bathroom all chipper, like nothing's unusual
Notices Henessey cursorily
Raises a finger: "one sec
" Lowers her head and shakes it like a terrier, spraying him
He cannot stop staring
It's Samantha, it *has* to be
Now she's , though
Hair clipped short
Bobbed
Blood- red fingernails
Red cotton shift, legs for days
Then, she *smiles* at him -- and it's not her, not Samantha
Amnesia's over, folks, because we're clearly looking at a changed woman: This one's name is  , and she hasn't seen the light of day in eight years
Hey, Mitch
Glad you're awake
Uh- oh, you're seeping
She grabs a washcloth
Frowns, says: Here, look at this
With that, she opens her robe and exposes her breasts
Henessey perks up considerably -- then  as she the gauze from his chest
She clinchs the robe again
Ah, that hurt like shit
That's why  distracted you first
(dabs at his wounds) Same principle as breaking in virgins
Same as -- virgins, *what*
Saw it in a Harold Robbins book
Guy bites her on the ear as he goes in
Distracts from the pain
You ever try that
No,  slug 'em in the jaw and yell "pop goes the weasel," what the fuck are you talking about
Who are you
Name's Charly
The spy
Nice to meet'cha
Drink
- Henessey watches, fascinated
All the little mannerisms, the differences
Shaking out a match, running a hand through her hair
And never missing a thing, eyes constantly roving, scanning
Guard never down
She plucks a drink from a nearby table, steals it outright
See
Sit next to the dance floor, every drink's free
People finish dancing, they think the waiter lifted 'em
Henessey grimaces
Clears his throat, says: 'm confused
Gimme a minute
Take two, they're small
She knocks back her drink
No hesitation
Henessey shifts uncomfortably, lights a smoke
Okay
Let's say  buy it
You're actually a trained killer, Jesus, can't even say it with a straight face
(frowns) So then
Samantha, she
Never really existed
Like Nathan said, she was a total fabrication, made her up
Fabrication
And now she's just
gone
Forever and ever
Thank God
Look at my inordinately large ass, look what she did to me
Henessey squirms, this one's gonna take some time to digest
Pretty convincing act
Guess so
mean, her personality, it had to come from *somewhere* -- Change the subject
Better yet, steal me another drink
Henessey sighs
Next to him a couple get up to dance
He reaches over and lifts their beers
Drink up
What's next
called Chapter
'm trying to bring us in from the field alive
Chapter
Can you trust them
Not sure
Until  know, you might wanna stay away from curbs
He looks at her, confused: They like to push people in front of buses
Didn't need to know that
goes by: (bad Caribbean accent) Hey, lady, Santa want to dance the lambada wit'choo
*Come this way, everybody*
He shimmies away
Charly grins at Henessey: If  could come that way  wouldn't need to dance the lambada
Follow me,  need you to do something
-   - Henessey hunches forward, speaks rapidly into the phone: The lady's whacked, Trin, she's lost it and  want fucking out, now *call the Feds*
She's moving us tonight, 'll sneak out to this phone, call you back at midnight with the details
He hangs up quickly
Turns -- reveal , lounging a foot away, watching him
All right, Charly
What did that accomplish
'm testing our boy Perkins
figure he's gotta be tapping your office
Got a light
(pause, then:) Oh, no
He just traced that call
She swipes matches from his pocket
Nods
Come midnight, you hang by the phone
Nobody shows, we think about trusting him
He tries to kidnap and torture you, well, there it is
Whoa, time out
Oh, don't be such a baby
(lights her cigarette) Ten o'clock, we got two hours to kill
'm a woman, feed me
- , dead for the winter
Henessey and Charly stroll beneath them
He smokes
She eats Chinese
Ugh
God 'm full, 'm gonna have a food baby
He takes a good long look at her, still can't fathom it
"Charly
" fucking unbelievable
(beat) Shame about the fat ass
bet you were really attractive once
Oh,  was
Check this out
One time
guy said he'd fuck me
No
Swear to God
Did he make good
Absolutely
Oh, and afterwards
Oh my God, afterwards  said the most funny thing, you know what  said
(beat) said, "Go back to your room
Dad
" She laughs through a swig of beer
: Charly's bedroom as  puts the gun to his head and fires,
It's why he thought  had him killed
Henessey huddles, watching her closely
Your father was murdered
She nods, gazes out over the icy waters
Speaks, her voice faraway and gone: When Da died,  went to his funeral
12 years old, today  wouldn't
And overheard a woman, she was praying
She was thanking God -- sounded so happy -- thanking Him it hadn't been *her* father who was killed
See
she didn't really care that God had let someone die
just so long as it missed *her*
(beat) and she bought her cross at the same store as mine, see, that's what we do, we all pray to the same cross on a hundred different walls, and sit back and wait to see who gets hit and who gets missed
Anger flares in her eye
Like a stirring of mud at the bottom of a deep, deep, pond
Fuck the waiting
Fuck being afraid
determine who gets hit, and how hard
And  thank no one
It's pathetic to thank someone who spares you -- when they're just taking someone else
(beat) Walk me upstairs
-  - They enter the suite
She drops her purse, sways toward him
Presses him against the wall, framed there in the doorway
This is my first date in eight years, Mitch
Is this a fun date
Quite suddenly, Charly leans over and kisses him on the lips
He reacts, startled
Stares at her
Okay, what's going on
True love, shut the fuck up
You kidding me
'm an ex-con, lady
wear a shiny suit, my tie's crooked, and the last time  got blown candy bars cost a nickel
Plus 'm ugly, so what's up
Chemistry
Be quiet
She nibbles his ear
Pulls back, smiling -- and Henessey's holding the picture of  and
The one he found torn in two
He looks her full in the face: Chemistry my ass
Know what  think
think this is why you'd fuck me
(beat) To kill a schoolteacher
Bury any trace of her
He pushes her away
Sorry,  liked the schoolteacher
When she comes back, give me a call
Charly jerks backward
Angry
Henessey heads for the bathroom
Oh, and call your fuckin' kid, will ya'
It's two days to Christmas, and she's under the mistaken impression that Mommy gives a shit
Charly snatches up her purse, eyes burning: didn't ask for the kid, Mitch
Samantha had the kid, not me, She storms out
: - Charly stalks the city streets
quartet sings, "God Rest Ye Merry," ostensibly about joy, oddly the most depressing tune ever written
On a crowded street, she is alone
Total misfit
Searches her own haggard features in a shop window
Swallows hard, whispers: Easy, baby
She ain't coming back, no way
Bitch is dead
She bustles down a sidestreet, hands jammed in her pockets
That's when a tall   crosses the street and falls in alongside
Good evening
Fuck off
see me a good-looking lady, all upset,  wonder if she doesn't need some male company
Forget it
'm saving myself 'til get raped
His hand edges out of his windbreaker with a snubnosed
38
Step into the alley, honey
ain't asking, 'm telling
Charly stops walking
Regards him the way you or  might look at a telephone cord
Groans: Oh, don't tell me
You're early, Goddammit, you're supposed to be at the pay phone
Go away and come back at midnight
'm not ready yet
Got a light
The guy stares, mouth working
Lady,  have a gun
Which is precisely when a much larger Smith and Wesson next to his ear: (
) This ain't no ham on rye, pal
holds the gun rock steady in his big fist
Charly spins on him, eyes flashing: What the hell are you doing here
Saving your life
Woulda got here sooner but  was thinking up the sandwich line
You think  couldn't take him
*Idiot*, you probably scared the other guy away -- What other guy --
Headhunters, nimrod, they go in pairs, were you always this stupid or did you take lessons
The hitman watches, bewildered
Considers waving to get their attention
Finally he can't stand it
Blurts out: Hey
Charly snaps her head toward him: *What*
still got this fucking gun
She smiles sweetly
No, you don't
Takes it off him
Just like that
He stares dumbly at his empty hand
Half of his trigger finger is missing
Charly flips the gun into the air
Launches a
Shatters his jaw
Catapults him backwards
Completes her spin, catlike -- Catches the
38 on its way down
'
Arm out, gun cocked --
Straight at Henessey, what
He dives aside -- , a second
Blown to tatters
The meant for Henessey arcs through the air
Imbeds itself in the ground an inch from the prone detective
He stares at it with shocked eyes
The killer hits, dead
Twitches
Lowers her arm slowly
Gun barrel smoking
Fuck you
Just fuck all of you
- out of a parking garage
Swerves and plunges into the maze of streets that inspired the world's most popular board game
- Charly drives, possessed
Henessey drinks
Hands shaking
Dammit
knew  couldn't trust that prick
She throws a shrieking skid
Henessey clutches for the dashboard, swearing
Easy, Spike
got myself out of Beirut once,  think  can get us out of New Jersey
Don't be so sure, others have tried
The entire population, in fact
(beat) Look, about me
mean, what's up, you're this hot survival chick, 'm getting the feeling you don't need me anymore
Charly reaches over
Yanks the doorhandle
Good point
She kicks him out of the moving car
- He bounces off the highway
Rolls
Over and over, shudders to a stop
Pause
The wind blows
He groans
Looks up, spits gravel
Stands
Dusts himself off
Watches the Bronco go far away
-
- As Henessey trudges wearily down the highway we : (
) Dear Mom:  was tortured, now 'm in Atlantic City
The girl of my dreams just threw me out of a speeding car
Now more people will come an shoot me in the head
On the plus side, won two bucks at video poker
of tires, he turns, startled -- here comes the Bronco
Skids onto the highway and races back toward him
Pulls up alongside
throws open the door, says: Get in
He does
Without a word
Closes the door, they drive off
He lights a cigarette like nothing happened
Shakes out the match, speaks without looking at her: Found a use for me
Yep
(beat) gotta vanish, Mitch
need money, a whole bunch
Why didn't you say so
Gimme a second while  pull it out of my ass
She turns to him, a gleam in her eye
Speaks softly: The key, Mitch
The one  keep around my neck
What about it
What if  told you it's the key to Box 406 at Pittsburgh International Airport
How would you know
Someone filed off the numbers
Not someone
Me
filed them off
(beat) There's a briefcase in Box 406, Mitch
What's in it
$200,000
Henessey does a spit-take, sprays whiskey
Payment for my last assignment need you to retrieve it for me
Why me
Don't be stupid, they might have the place covered
don't want to get shot to pieces
Shoulda known
(sighs) Gimme the key
'd love to
left it with Caitlin back in Ohio
- The  races on into the night
- Late, very late now
Henessey, driving
Beside him, Charly reclines, lost in reverie
Features bathed in passing roadlights
Henessey grinds out a butt: Humor me: you're a paid assassin, then you fall off a cliff
Sink under the ocean, and when you come out you're a fucking schoolmarm, wanna tell me what happened
fell into a school of fish, they elected me principal
Shut the fuck up
Mmmm
Personally
'm thinking maybe Samantha Caine wasn't an act
Maybe you forgot to hate yourself for eight years, ever think of that
Shut
The
Fuck
Up
Hmmm
Nope, seems clear enough to me
Hate myself, Christ almighty
What are you, my shrink
No, just some loser thought he could maybe understand, fuck it
been there, you know
'd kill for fucking amnesia
'm with my boy and all can think is  got reamed in the ass by three guys
Merry Christmas, son, here's a ball glove, did you know Daddy screamed when they carved the name in his back
Mary, by the way
pushed for Cindy, but hell
God, 'm tired
(beat) never did one thing right, you know it, not one fucking thing
Not even accidental, that takes skill
He looks over
She's asleep, hasn't heard a word
Face slack, lips slightly parted
The toughness banished from her features
In its place, a lingering sadness
: - The Bronco glides along
Charly in the passenger seat, eyes roving like a hawk's
is peaceful and quiet
Christmas lights, still burning dimly
Drive past, don't slow down
(points) Park under those trees, honk if there's trouble
(bad Rochester) Yas, massah,  be slowin' de caw down fo' you
She stuffs a
45 automatic in her waistband
Cradles an -5 beneath her coat
Rolls out of the still-moving truck
Makes her way through back yards
Silent as a cat
She went to cookouts here
Bridge parties
Now she prowls, a grim assassin
Leaps a fence, drops behind a woodpile -- Comes face to face with , a fifth grade student we saw earlier
Secreted behind the woodpile,
His eyes pop as he spies good ol' Ms
Caine, sporting blonde hair and an assault weapon
Charly doesn't miss a beat: Good morning, Raymond
Um
morning, Ms
Caine
What did we learn about the dangers of smoking
Give it here
wet stain appears at his crotch
He hands her the cigarette with nerveless fingers
Charly accepts it
Takes a long, satisfying drag
Passes it back
Thanks
Tell anyone you saw me 'll blow your fucking head off
Moves off through the bushes
Out of sight
- Charly kicks aside a pair of abandoned ice skates
Crouches, face pressed to the glass door
Looking in
The house is silent and empty
Nobody home
The Christmas tree winks off and on
The tree she helped decorate
She opens the door and slips inside
: -  - Three
Faces drawn, haggard
Pit-stained shirts, day old sandwiches
Carrying photographs of Charly and Henessey
Agent #1 sighs, examining her figure
#1 Man, 'd eat a mile of her shit just to follow it back to the ass it came from
#2 Christ, 'm trying to have breakfast
on the dash squawks, a voice says: (
) Unit 2 to Red Dog, give us one more pass, let's make sure the house is secure
'  - Charly enters
All business
Begins to systematically rifle the drawers
Her daughter's precious things
Sweeps everything onto the floor
Utter disregard, it's a bit startling
Crosses to the bed, throws back the covers -- (the stuffed bear) has the chain around his neck
We hear it, then
Ghosting on the still air, barely audible, the sound of
Children's voices waft across the frozen pond from St
Paul's Episcopal
Charly frowns
Crosses to the window, lifts the sash
Pause
Charly chews her lip
Unlimbers the -5
Hefts the wicked-looking thing
Not to fire it
but to use the
Adjusts focus
Practiced movements
Deft
Sure
Sights down the weapon
Scans though the gunsights
: Hal's
There's Hal
Cast in spectral
Laughing and serving breakfast
On the church lawn, a  scene
Teenage girls as the wise men
Choir of children, singing
among them
Charly is sweating
She lowers the scope
Squeezes her eyes shut
Something in her, threatening to
- Henessey, slouched behind the wheel
Starts to light a cigarette
Stops, the match halfway to his face
Eyes riveted on the rearview mirror as a   turns the corner behind him
- Watching her family, far away
Fighting emotion
That's when she hears
Her head whips around, toward the front of the house
The honk is followed by three in rapid succession
She's up and moving
All else forgotten
- Henessey  , tires smoking
Careens forward, government close behind -- The upstairs window  outward
Charly, hurtles through
Freefalls to the porch roof
Glass, showering down
Hits, rolls
Surfaces in a combat crouch,
Government sedan,
Collapses him over the doorframe
Gun clatters to the street, car speeds off -- - The driver looks over, incredulous
He's dead
Goddammit, how did that happen
*Go bulletproof, now*
The driver hits a button and up go the windows
All, that is, except the passenger side window -- Because the dead guy's bald  blocks it
Becomes  there
Bald pate exposed to the world
- Charly watches the two vehicles rocketing away down the street
Out of range
Lowers the smoking
45
Takes off around the house at a dead run
' - Switch scenery: the Christmas Pageant,  and fellow angels traipse into the church vestibule
Caitlin looks up just in time to see  apply the chloroform
Two seconds, she's out like a light
Next case
Up and moving, child tucked neatly under his arm has seen it happen
Opens her mouth to scream -- He palms a Puts it to her youngest son's kidney: Wanna be a statistic, lady
You're about to have 2
4 children
Freezes her
Petrified
know where you live
Close your mouth, you look like a fish
Merry Christmas
He exits into the vestibule
Quick
Professional
,    : High speed chase, in progress
The driver dogs Henessey, jockeys for position
Barks into a radio mic: Target two, acquired
Red Dog in pursuit, backup requested
(over his shoulder) You got him
got him
The backseat agent hefts an -47 assault rifle
- Henessey checks the rear view mirror -- just in time to see a circular portion of glass  from the chase car's window
Out comes a gun muzzle
Jesus wept
The guy opens up on full auto
Rakes the Bronco,  it
Henessey swerves madly -- no go
Death run
He's not coming home, not this time
- hurtles forward,   across the frozen pond toward the chase vehicles
Long, coltish legs, to die for
This is gross, this is gonna be so Goddamn gross
She goes  at superhuman speed
Tacks alongside the government sedan
Targets the bald guy's head
Raises the
45 and
Not to be graphic, but the car's driver receives the bulk of the mess
Across the eyes
He loses control,
Catapults off the road, onto the ice
Slides right toward Charly, *still doing fifty*
She doesn't miss a beat
herself, twisting in midair
Up    of the sedan, it blows by underneath her as The incredible part
In slow motion, she does a Above the hood
Mid-spin, she blows through the windshield
Kills everyone
Keeps going
The car spins twice around
to a halt -- Charly hits a picture perfect landing
On the shore,  watches, thunderstruck
Charly skates by the icebound sedan
Flashes a grin at the dying driver: Shit
it really
*is* you
Phil
Phil Krauss
don't believe it, they moved you from cyphers
Long time, man,  figured you were dead by now
She delivers a blow to the neck
Kills him
: -  - Henessey and Charly, driving a new vehicle: late model Cadillac
Charly driver
Henessey rifles the glove compartment
So, Mitch
Still think 'm warm and fuzzy
Sure
It's not your fault the gun accidentally went off in mid-air as you tripped and flew over the car
Exactly
What's in the glove box
Phone bill, Christmas card
Five buck, swell
You didn't have to kill him, you know
Back off, man
Do  tell you how to snap photos of extramarital blowjobs
No
There is a short,  sound
Seemingly from nowhere
They exchange puzzled looks, what the hell
Charly abruptly realizes it's coming from her purse
She reaches in, scoops up the  , the one she told Caitlin to call
Thumbs the button
Says cautiously: Hello
voice, then
Clipped tones, ' voice: (
) It's me,  got your kid
Give your location, we gotta lose the cellular
Charly
Hand gripped tight on the phone
Pause, then: State Road 80, 15 minutes west of Harrison
Okay, here's how we do it
Drive to Harrison, find their main bus stop
Pay phone, fifteen minutes
Better drive fast, after five rings  hang up
Click
What the hell was that
He's got the kid
Doesn't want to talk on the airwaves, he's routing me to a land line
pay phone
Which phone
Where
The detective's mind, racing
suddenly it hits him: Shit
Service centers
They list 'em on the back of phone bills, right
Excuse me
Shut up and find me a gun
, -5
As he rips open the bill we  : neutral background, as Charly's  enters frame, we're very tight on her
Tense, thin-lipped
, deafening
Click -- Charly speaks tersely: Verify you have her
(
) got your cellular number off a cast on her right wrist
Right below Mommy loves you
Picture of a panda
Dog, panda, it's got funky ears
: Dead still
Made of glass
(
) want money, Charly
know you've got numbered accounts, we all do
'll let you know where and when
Fuck with me
'll blind the kid and shoot out her knees
You're dead, motherfucker
We don't involve families
It's not the way it's done, *we don't take families*
'll be in touch
He hangs up
Dead silence
on Charly's face
until slowly, ever so slowly, the camera pulls back to : The
45 automatic -- Pointed at the head of an & operator
, they've taken it over
Employees on the floor
Henessey, -5 slung on his shoulder, leveled
Charly points to the switchboard: Give me an  trace
Do it
-  -    - Set back from the mountain road, a lonely
neon sign: *Deer Lick Motel*, No vacancies
The sign sits atop a rusty pole
Blinks forlornly
- hangs up and turns to
, seated across the room: It's done, she hooked
All  gotta do is set the ransom meet
She mustn't suspect a trap
No way
She thinks 'm acting alone, remember
Say the word, 'll hand her to you on a plate
Perkins crosses to the bed
Rubs tired eyes
Gazes down at Caitlin
Asleep, a syringe on the nightstand beside her
Next to a brown paper bag
God
We're monsters, aren't we
(pause, then:) Forget Charly
Talk to me about tonight
The tanker's on its way from Charleston,  1:00 a
m
One terrorist on ice, waiting to play patsy
(points) What's in the sack
Perkins follows his gaze: the brown paper bag
Smiles thinly
That
Something to prove that 'm not a complete ogre
He reaches into the paper bag and brings out a
Sweet, innocent
Frilly with lace
bright red bow
See
The young one will have a doll to play with on Christmas
Very popular item
It
well, it pees
You put water in it and
oh, fuck you
-    - Charly and Henessey, eating at '
Seated across from each other at an orange plastic table, scarfing Christmas burgers
Outside, a billboard reads:
*Where it's Christmas all year long*
Almost dark now
Another ten minutes
You want my Crazy Meal action figure
Pass
Listen, you sure we're doing the right thing
We've got money, we could negotiate
*'ll get the damn kid*, okay
God, hope he doesn't shoot her up
Kid's dead weight if she's sedated
Not so emotional, 'm getting embarrassed with these outbursts here
Oh, balls
Want me to cry on cue can
This is an extraction, nimrod, and she's the target, that's how to play it, the only way to beat this guy
Yeah
How come you know so much about this fucking guy
Don't go there, Mitch, you don't want to know
'm here
Suppose you tell me
Fine, you asked
bumped pelvises with this guy
In Paris, back in 1987
She knows she's shocking him, rubs it in: 'd been assigned to kill his boss, remember
Needed him out of the way
So  let him seduce me
Had a steel needle under the pillow, figured to stick him *en flagrante*, that means while we were screwing
But he was too slick
Bashed me in the head, finished, then threw me in the trunk of a car
Still think 'm a girl scout, Mitch
The look in her eyes is feral
It's almost dark
Let's get it done
- Full dark now, the fun begins
rumbles up the mountain road
Pulls up before the Deer Lick Motel wield flashlights, motioning the truck forward into a cavernous
Inside, men in   operate cranes, maneuver a   into place above the truck
- In the distance, as the tanker enters the garage -- drops into frame
Lands and rolls, cat-quick
Comes up behind a scrawny pine
Scans through a pair of Zeiss Nightvision binoculars
Welcome to the extraction
No more fun and games, tonight it's a survival-zero operation
appears at her elbow
Lugging the ordnance bag
He sees Charly lower the binoculars, head in hands
What's the matter
They're here
Who
Fucking Chapter, that's who
Timothy acting alone, Caitlin had a chance
Now
She's dead meat
- As the tanker snorts to a halt,  pulls up, driving a bright red Jaguar
Gets out as a blue-suit trots up: - 1800 hours
We're still trying to clean the tanker -- (scowls annoyance) Fuck the cleaning, just drain it and reload
Chop-chop, 'm going bunjee jumping after this
- Charly and Henessey
Kneeling
He speaks tersely: Let me go in
Negative
You stomp around like a forties drunk and you're a lousy shot
get by
You couldn't hit a lake if you were standing on the bottom, now shut the fuck up
Charly studies the encampment
Armed men
Impossible odds
Draws a long ragged breath and flops on the ground
Props her back against a tree
Staring
Lights a cigarette: saw a little girl
(frowns) Come again
That's what happened under the water
That night, eight years ago
She looks up at the sky
Face troubled
At the end
there she was, this pretty little girl at the bottom of the ocean, smiling at me
Three years old, didn't know Daddies hid in closets, not yet
Stared up at me in the strangest way
saying how'd it come to this, we were so pretty and perfect, now look at us, sinking with our head all open
Said when she grew up she was gonna teach school
She couldn't wait
She heaves a sigh
Threads a silencer on a baretta
Guards are on 27-1 megahertz, meet me at 26-9, you need to talk
As soon as you spot me with the kid, start blowing the charges
Henessey nods
Pause -- she does something unexpected
Leans over and kisses him hard on the lips
He reacts, startled
She pulls back, the oddest look on her face
They're gonna blow my head off, you know
(softly:) This is the last time 'll ever be pretty
She kisses him again
Softly
Tenderly
Pulls back, turns without a word
Time now
What  do next, they tell me it
looks like a machine or something
You don't like it, don't look
She moves off toward the trees
Henessey shifts from foot to foot, awkwardly
Opens his mouth -- Don't say it
was gonna say enjoy life, eat out more often
Gotta go
(beat) If she's alive, she's coming out of there, Mitch
If she's not
they'll know we stopped by
She's gone, like a wraith
: : Charly, on the prowl
In and out of the trees
-4
In bushes
In snowdrifts
She crawls to woods' edge, peers out -- The motel stands solemn and bedraggled
Draws a sharp breath --
There's a   in the window of 17
: - gray-suited
Poised on a wooded slope
He puts a walkie-talkie to his lips and says: All clear
, out of nowhere
Lightning fast
Hand, clamped on mouth
In goes the knife
Deep
He burbles blood
Drops
Before he hits, Charly's already switched from knife to gun and moved on
17 - Charly appears from the shadows
Ghosts up to the window of #17 and peers in
Scans
Misses nothing
Crosses to the door, taps lightly
Watches the , a tiny pinprick of light
Abruptly darkened by a human eye -- She presses the silenced Beretta to the hole and fires
Sputs of splinters
From behind the door, a muffled thud
She goes to work on the lock
- Henessey lies prone, binoculars trained on the motel
Christ, lady, what are you doing in there, playing fucking mah-jongg
*Move*
Behind him, a tiny, sharp click--
has a Skorpion machine pistol aimed at his head
The killer speaks into a radio unit, a single word -- Bogey
-
go the Kleig lights
, blinding -- coming out of 17
Pins her dead to rights
Unconscious cradled in her arms
Tiny  cradled in the kid's
Charly runs, as the ground around her erupts like a , , shouting into his walkie-talkie, saying: Take her alive, Perkins wants her
Henessey watches, helpless and , as Charly tumbles Crashes through a  , it splinters beneath her
Plunges into blackness
- She hits, cushions the kid
Grunt of into kaleidoscopic   , Charly strafe it all
Blows through the clip, hits the lights: She's killed household items
, blasted
Rusty tools, faded signs --  -   which she's managed to , good one, Charly
The gas comes bubbling out on burps and splatters, drenching the floor
Charly casts about for an escape route
Set into the brick wall, a huge steel
She flings it open --
Nothing there, no help
Eyes darting
Possessed
wafts down from above, then
Deadly serious: (
) smell gasoline, you have a little accident
got plenty of matches up here
Bad way for a kid to go
Thirty seconds, think it over
stands in place, mind racing
Caitlin's
Regards her dully
Plastic smile like it knows a secret
: - 2ND  - as it descends into the bowl of a pipe
puffs mightily
Turns and favors  and with a thoughtful gaze, they're handcuffed to radiator
straddles a nearby chair
Smiles and says: Good to have you back again, Chuck
You know, Colonel, you ought really to have stayed dead
You don't know the rules of the game anymore
No shit
Eight years ago, you send me to kill Daedalus and this clown
Now you're working *with* him
He crosses to the fireplace, flips the match inside
Budget cuts, remember
Congress blinded us in Eastern Europe, Central America
Across the board, an intelligence blackout
We had to recruit any eyes and ears we could find, even if it meant going to former targets
Pause
Suddenly Charly's eyes go wide
She whispers: Budget cuts
oh, God
Is *that* what this is about
The foot soldiers, the tanker truck
Fuck me, you're running a fundraiser
Comprehension, dawning
She looks up in disbelief
You'll get all the money you want at the next budget hearing, won't you
All you need is a major terrorist incident
Interesting theory
Theory, my ass
think some terrorists were planning a strike
Bought supplies from Daedalus, that's how you knew they were coming
(eyes widening) No way
Don't tell me you're gonna sit there and let them go through with it, *just to get a budget increase*
Perkins shrugs philosophically
It's not without precedent
1993, remember the World Trade Center bombing
The  had advance knowledge, don't think they didn't
Worse, the diplomat who issued the terrorist's visa was , they *facilitated* the bombing
Purely to justify a budget increase
Of course, they'd no way of knowing the terrorists would botch the job
That's not gonna happen this time
No
This time, the terrorist event will come off precisely as planned
This time the terrorists can't muck it up
because we've killed them and taken over
Charly and Henessey react, startled
- On the move
Our two heroes, shepherded across the compound
Timothy's casualness is belied by the presence of two dyspeptic , each keeping a safe distance
-  approaches briskly,  across his shoulder
Holds out his hand: Found these buried around the perimeter
Timothy studies it: -4  with remote detonation unit
Make sure you get all of them
The agent rushes off
Timothy looks at Charly reproachfully: Chuck, you give me the fuck of my life then try to stick me, come back from the dead, whack my boss
No sense lyin', 'm miffed
Moves like lightning
-
Kidney shot
Charly stumbles, vision going black
Fights for balance
Henessey starts to react but a   stops him
Charly straightens
Grits her teeth, says: So what's the plan
What's going out in the tanker
Timothy and the guards exchange looks
Cracking up, they can't believe it -- Charly's not laughing
Looks at Timothy with hooded, lifeless eyes: What's the plan
'm gonna die, wanna know
Timothy lights a cigarette
Studies Charly
You wanna know the plan
He casually points to the neighboring valley, where Christmas lights twinkle
Santa Claus -- small town
personified
We drive the chemical tanker in tonight, park it
Add a catalyst, chain reaction, it goes hot
We evacuate
The mix heats overnight, goes critical at 312 degrees Celsius
8:00 Christmas morning
Main Street looks like a meteor strike
Are you fucking insane
You're talking about 10,000 people
Easy, Mitch
(to Timothy) How you gonna blame it on terrorists
Those roads are treacherous this time of year
When we dump a car to the bottom of a ravine, with the corpse of Imn Al Rahman in it
get the picture
Pause
Charly summons herself
Her voice a dull rasp: Listen to me, Timothy
Please
Let my kid go
Why
For old times' sake
She shakes her head: Goddamn you, *look at her eyes*
And why exactly should  do that
(spits blood) Because they're yours, motherfucker
She stares Timothy full in the face
That night in Paris,  got pregnant
The little girl's your daughter
Dead silence
pause
Then Timothy brays
Priceless
Can't believe it
Hooting out loud
Tears, streaming
He manages to bring himself under control
Stops, gestures to the  , the dark awaits
Kid's down there
What it is, Charly, they're gonna find you both frozen to death in the woods
Suicide pact
Charly fights to contain herself
She's no risk, Timothy, *let her go*
The freezer's downstairs, Charly
Let's get it done
Charly and Henessey are separated at gunpoint
look passes between them
Henessey swallows hard
'll wait for you to rescue me
Be just a minute
Charly goes through the opening
- The same  she occupied earlier
Timothy behind her, he wrinkles his nose in distaste
Shit, this place is loaded with fumes, nobody light a fucking match
You check her for flammables
(shrugs) Checked her for colon cancer
Caitlin is sitting in a chair
Bundled in flannel, clutching her baby doll, the one Perkins bought for her
She looks up at Charly dully
Sucking her thumb
Mommy
Charly composes herself
Shhhhh
Mommy's here, it's okay
Safe and snug
what comes next, huh
What's the next part
bug in a rug
man with white hair
says the same thing you say
Charly licks her lips
Easy, Charly, keep cool, she mustn't die afraid
We're going to take a nap together, Cate
You can have your dolly, and Mommy will be next to you, how's that
It'll be like bears in winter
When they get cold, see, they fall deep, deep asleep
Bears, yeah, yeah
Enough
He points to the   of the meat freezer
The guard opens it onto a gleaming silver
Timothy calmly adjusts the thermostat
Sub zero
The guard reaches for Caitlin's doll
Charly snatches it back
Face etched in disgust
You're murdering us both, cocksucker, let the kid have her fucking dolly
He subsides, unable to meet her gaze
At which point, Timothy tosses her the
Chuck, 'm not a total creep
'll make you a deal, okay
There's a knife in that box
Now, you and the kid, you're going to freeze, *but* -- if you kill the kid *by your own hand*
won't kill your husband
Serious
We're gonna open that door and you'll both be frozen solid, but wanna know that you've cut your own child's throat
You don't want to ever be on the receiving end of the she gives him
Steps into the freezer, holding Caitlin
As the door starts to swing shut, she says: It ain't over, motherfucker
You're gonna die screaming and 'm gonna watch
Am  telling the truth
She flashes him her most  smile -- The whole room lights up
She can do that
As the door erases her from view, a chill dances up Timothy's spine
because there was nothing resembling doubt on her face
- crosses with Caitlin to the far corner
Mom, it's cold in here-
Shhh
Just for a little bit
Polar bear, remember
Moves
Quick
Methodical
Breaks open the : Sure enough, a hunting knife
Without missing a beat, she crosses to the Kneels and begins  at the bottom edge
into the brick, what the hell
- Henessey, by the window
Tied to a chair
Timothy paces before him, carrying three razor-keen
Pegs one into the wall with deadly accuracy
Tell me where Charly keeps her money
She must have mentioned it
Get fucked, you dumb bastard
Charly called Washington, by morning this whole place'll be crawling with Feds
We'll be gone by then, Mitch
Yeah, well, that's what 'm saying, there's a couple Feds, they couldn't sleep, said they might come early
Fuck you, someone'll screw up
Just watch
Already did, Mitch, someone already did
Perkins got stuck with a double agent, someone trusted, highly placed
Who
Me
(chuckles) Chinks are paying me to bring down Chapter
Henessey reacts, startled
Timothy chuckles: Truck goes, hundreds dead -- rescue teams within minutes, guess what they find
The patsy
Uh-uh
They find Chapter, caught with their pants down
See, Mitch, dumped in a much faster chemical catalyst
(beat) The tanker's gonna blow *tonight*
In the center of town, thirty-five minutes from now
- , sweating at sub zero
Brushes hair from her eyes
Blinks
Still jabbing with the knife, *why the hell is she digging*
Gonna crawl under the damn door
She's gone loopy
Lying flat, she appraises her work -- Poked through to the other side
The actual penetration to daylight: millimeters
Then, she does two seemingly nonsensical things: Crosses to Caitlin -- gently takes the doll from her, then: Open
Reaches in her mouth
Takes out her
Must be the temperature
Crosses to the door again
Kneels down
Calmly, with infinite care, takes the retainer
Inverts it, now it's *trough*-shaped
Holds it flush against the tiny  she carved
, now
Holds it directly above the retainer
Depresses the  in its back: It pees gasoline
Gas, trickling down the retainer, through the brick -- into the other
Not much
Enough
She stands
with the doll
Crosses, dribbling, over to Caitlin
Hands the doll back to her
What next
She grabs the hunting knife, that's what
-- One terrifying moment, is she gonna put it in the kid
Hardly
Brings it down on the floor
Slams it down
Gimme a spark
show me, show me
Tries again
And again
, over and over
Floor with the effort -- Come on, come on
do it
But in the end, it's just not gonna happen
*Won't work*
Lets go a  of despair: All this, just one fucking match, *Goddamit*
She collapses forward
Cradles her head in frustration
There's a tiny tap in her shoulder
Mommy
Charly looks up, face haggard and depleted
Caitlin's eyes, alive again
No longer dulled
Kid reaches inside her and brings out a pack of matches
Don't cry
keep these here
(beat) For lighting your candle
Charly stares, dumbstruck, at the tiny gift
The bitterness, the self-hatred, all of it
Under innocent eyes on Christmas Eve , blown sky-high, and she sweeps up her daughter and cradles her, tears streaming
love you, Caitlin, oh God, do you know how much  love you
Caitlin pulls back, looks flush in her mother's face
Am  gonna die
From a dark and cold place, Caitlin has led her home
Charly's eyes, like steel
harsh whisper: No, baby, you're not gonna die
They are
She strikes a match
- Henessey, straining against his bonds
Sweating
Charly's stash
What's the number of the locker, Mitch
Fuck you
across the room, a good forty feet
Left nut, five bucks  make it
Smiling, he raises a scalpel
Eyes dead like a rat's
- The flame hovers above the gasoline trail
When  tell you, scream as loud as you can, or else your ears'll get hurt
tiny nod
Charly calmly touches fire to the fuel
Cradles Caitlin to her chest, gently strokes her hair
Hey, should we buy a dog
The flame races across the room
Hits the steel door
And zip
Vanishes through the
pause
-
Wooden walls, obliterated
Boards sheared
Atomized blows inward like a cannon shot
Holds to its hinges, buckled like
'  is off target, sticks in Henessey's chair
Between his legs
Inches
Then the assassin   , look of comic surprise -- as the walls behind him disintegrate in
Henessey cries out, blinded as He's blown backward
Chair and all, lofting across the middle distance
blasts through the
Blows it to
Tumbles, and over end
lands,
Atop the garage's
Chair flies to sticks
spins, startled
Gun comes up -- Henessey doesn't miss a beat
Reaches between his legs
Plucks the  from the wood and slings it
Guy takes it in the head, drops
Some days you get lucky
He looks up in disbelief
, raging to Heaven
You foxy bitch
- staggers from the smoke
Nicked and bloodied --
Rushes into the cavernous , where blue-suits scuttle like ants
Points to the tanker, face crazed: Move it out of here, now
-    - Caitlin in tow,  everywhere
Running flat out across the compound
Eyes ticking back and forth, missing nothing
Sees a gun on the ground, scoops it up: promptly  , the fucking thing's red hot
That's when the -  lurches out of the smoke, blade arcing for her throat
*Run, Catey*
She goes under the blade
him
Down they go, hit the dirt --  beats feet, vanishes into the smoke
Charly, fighting for her life
Manages to
He rears up
Poised to hurl the
Charly, dives, rolls -- scoops up the gun and  as her flesh sizzles and it spurts three times and blows him down
Doesn't stop
Rips the   from his shoulder
Rummages in his coat -- Cube of -4
Even better
Casts about, searching the smoke
No sign of her daughter
- darts in and out of the trees
Frightened
In the background, men rush back and forth
The  burns merrily
Then, above the shouts,   noise, she darts a look -- as   comes trundling out of the garage
: Attached to the rear of the truck bed, a bright yellow  , roughly three by three
As the driver idles, waiting for the road to clear -- Caitlin
Runs and climbs inside the box, and meanwhile - Her mother
Crouched behind Timothy's
Scans through the rifle's Starlight Scope
Sweating
Intense
We see the landscape, cast in ghostly
Where'd you go, baby
show Mommy
*There*
Bingo
Charly watches through the scope as a climbs into the box and shuts the lid
Unfortunately, a nearby blue-suit has  this
He looks around, stabbing a finger at the box: - Hey
Hey, you see that
little kid -- bullet slams him backward in a cut-string sprawl
She lowers the rifle
Nods grimly: Smart girl, honey
Stay still
Don't make a sound
Snug as a bug in a rug
, , on the move
Crouched low
Choking on woodsmoke, eyes streaming
Up ahead, a splayed  -- He hunkers over the poor schmuck, guy's good for a radio
Snatches up the portable unit
Fumbles with the dial, searching for 26
9 megahertz
-    - slews to a stop in the red Jag
Leaps out
Darts along the cliff, throws herself flat
Peering down at the grounds, sniper rifle positioned -- Babysitting the tanker
Calling to her on the radio
(
) Charly, you there
Hello, Charly
Grabs the unit from her belt: Mitch
don't believe it
Listen, if you say, "Are we having fun yet" 'll rip your nuts off
Where are you
Behind the big garage
Is Caitlin with you
No, but she's safe for the moment, she stowed away on the tanker truck
Henessey draws a sharp breath
Swallows, says: Charly, Timothy rigged the tanker to go off early
We got fifteen minutes
No more
On her reaction we  : - Beside the tanker,    sits, engine idling
Phony logo on its side -- *Little Debbie* snack cakes
is lowered, and a  begins backing up into the truckbed, facing outwards
, harried blue-suits hurriedly unwrap the frost-covered corpse of    -- and place him behind the wheel
, blue-suit puts a  on the utility box as he passes
- He hears two flat -
s on the still air
Hello
Charly
Even over the receiver, her desperation's apparent: Tires won't pop, Mitch
Bastard just locked her in, she's stuck in there and they're leaving, *Goddammit*
Henessey rubs his eyes
Takes several deeps breaths, mind turning it over
He looks up
Tired
Haunted
All right, 'll go in and get her, you watch my back
No chance
make it twelve, Mitch, automatic weapons
So kill 'em for me, bitch, Christ, what are you good for
He stuffs a fresh clip in the gun
Wipes away sweat
(to himself) 'mon, buddy
Do one thing right, just this once
please
Closes his eyes
Gathers himself
Long pause
Piece of cake
He leaps from the roof and makes a death run
Gun in one hand, radio in the other
Swerving and dodging like a broken-field runner,  in his ear screaming: (
) *Your nine, on your nine*
He spins,  , dead guy, pitching forward -- , billowing, making him
(
) *30 degrees left, Mitch
Left*
(beat) *Your other left*
Stumbling, catching himself
Barreling forward
(
) *Nix, nix,  can't see in there, don't do it, break right
*
He breaks right
(
) *Fuck me,  was wrong, get outta threre*
He staggers out of the smoke:  , -5 machine guns
Trained on his chest
He struggles to aim, oh, shit -- Two distant
The bad men go away, catapulted backwards
Henessey shouts into the radio: Gracias
(
) *De nada*
, fires shot after shot
Every time she squeezes the trigger, someone dies
No such thing as wounded, we're talking St
Peter looks up from a magazine and says holy shit, it's the lunch rush at Kate Mantilini's
The smoke clears and Mitch sees the tanker
Right there, thirty yards away
Yellow
No one in the way
(
) *End run, Mitch, go wide*
He breaks for the truck
(
) *No, Goddamn you, they got you flanked
*
Everybody fires a gun
Takes one high in the chest,  him
on full auto,    the combat zone, extinguishing the gunmen, too little too late because --
bullet takes out his right arm, fuck *you*, buddy, doesn't miss a beat, simply tosses the gun over to the other hand and  , blows that fucker down and now he's staggering into the trees, and collapses, and
And lies very still and bleeds
As  of gunfire die slowly, we : (
) Dear Ma: 'm looking at the ants, they're pretty great
Some really funny ants here, Ma
All these funny ants, think 'll stay and watch 'em awhile
Aftermath
Charly's out of ammo
Flings aside the rifle, snarling in a helpless rage -- Something else, then
, nearby
Building in pitch, reaching a crescendo -- Crests the cliff and hovers like the
- , riding shotgun
Scans the cliff below: Thick evergreens
Charly, somewhere among them
He sights down his rifle, takes careful aim --    on the Jaguar
Cripples it
The chopper , heading away
- In big trouble
, bouncing uphill toward her
Cut off, they've cut her off -- The other direction ain't much better:  200
Straight down
Evergreen trees, far below
Power lines
Highway
She hears the  , then
inside the Jag
Crosses slowly
Reaches in, lifts the receiver
It's
(
) tried to give you a pretty death, baby
Did my best
Now you're fucked, now it's ground beef time
The truck
How long til it blows
(incredulous) Sweet Loretta, you're another animal entirely
Let's see, 312 degrees
Make it ten minutes, give or take
Then  better hurry
Oh, spare me
You made a big noise and bought five more minutes on the planet
Give up
Die
'll spit in what's left of your face
He clicks off
Charly drops the receiver
Turns, looks behind: They're coming for her
Woods filled with headlights
Backlit
Ducking in and out of the trees, getting closer
The wind blows
Bitter cold out here in the dark night of the soul
Nothing left
No hope
No reason
Caitlin, dead
The rage explodes in the form of a kick which  the lock on the trunk
*Dammit*, she needs a fucking miracle
At that moment, the trunk lid slowly rises,
Revealing all of Timothy's
- The  is rolling
Out onto the road, snorting and belching
Preceded by the Little Debbie
-   - Poor little Caitlin huddles in the dark
All alone in her ears
Sort of like being underwater
- silver device attached to the skin of the tank
-   - He consults a tiny, liquid crystal display on his watch
Red numerals
*178 degrees*
'  - She won't quit
Busy now, deftly sticking the wad of -4 to the bottom of the Jaguar
Straightens
Turns around -- Stands dead calm as they all come out of the , guns drawn
Raises her hands, see, boys
No bang-bang
Like backlit monsters, they approach, hulking
Matter of yards, now
She flashes a naughty little smile -- Goes backward off the cliff and rockets earthward
200 feet of open air,   Cord pays out, fast
Whipsaws out the door of the Jaguar, hooked by carabiner to the   and meanwhile Rush forward, incredulous
Peer   : Below them, a swan diver,  all around
She drops like a stone
Vanishes into the fog, beautiful as a poem
: The cord goes taut -- Now it starts to stretch outward
kicking in, Charly can it, still whistling through space
Hits a dead stop
This is it
Cord, stretched as far as it goes
She's still sixty feet above the highway
No hesitation whatsoever
She thumbs the  in her right fist -- Blows the car
- ' The Jaguar goes up with a solid --
Blown off the edge of the cliff
Along with a half dozen screaming
- Lifeline cut
60 feet above the road, no problem
She does thirty feet in freefall
Raises her left hand -- Slaps a carabiner on a passing
Hurtles downward until suddenly, ---
She  to a stop
Doesn't miss a beat: Grips a rope and  the last thirty feet, touches down lightly
Unhooks herself, turns as throws a fishtail , just misses her
Driver She raises her gun
Fires without blinking
Puts a hole in the passenger side windshield and the ain't sticking around, he's out the door and gone as Crosses to the car, face a stone mask
Behind her the to the ground, raining fragments -- Followed by  , smacking the pavement one after another
She doesn't even look
Gets behind the wheel
Leaves most of her tires on the road behind her
-     - Milling crowds
Music and laughter
heads up a down Main Street, atop a horse-drawn sleigh
Replay of the film's opening, as - The gleaming  roars down a sidestreet
Riding point: the innocuous
The temperature gauge continues to : *203 degrees*
-    - Charly runs a roadblock, doing fifty -- Someone put a in front of her
Hits the
Fishtales into a mailbox
Sends it flying through a plate glass window
Out of the car, gun held low, and meanwhile -- - barks orders into a mic: All units converge
Divert local law, this is a government matter
Brook no interference,  want the Baltimore woman eliminated
*Where's the fucking chopper*
Racing toward the edge of town and meanwhile himself perches atop his sleigh, feeling like a rock star and wishing his groupies were legal
when suddenly he's got company
'm the Missus
Drive
The rogue colonel    in the air --   bolt
Plunging off the parade route amid  as - hunkers forward, face slack, as a tinny issues from his headset mic: (
) yes, she's with Santa Claus, correct, er, excuse me, the individual *playing* Santa, er
they're pursuing the tanker truck, sir
Perkins stares straight ahead, speechless
- Horses at full gallop, hooves in pounding frenzy
Charly tries to  from one to the other -- no go, the tanker pulls away, widening the distance, and meanwhile Come whipping out of , fall in behind them
--
Gunshots, shattering the stillness
- whines off a hydraulic cable
Spurt of fluid as the  start to go, and meanwhile throws herself flat next to Santa
Sorry, man
Government agents, high level conspiracy
Fuckin' government
The  jockey for position, try to pull  -- Charly swerves the sleigh back and forth, won't let them through
She hands the reigns to Santa
Veer left
Away from the truck
Do it
In five seconds 'm gonna own that fucking truck
Santa complies
to the left -- Opens a chasm between sleigh and tanker
Sure enough, one of the government cars spurts forward to fill the gap, comes of them
It's what she wanted
* *: Charly Baltimore  from the sleigh, lands atop the government car
Skips lightly across it, casually through the
Down through the metal
Drilling into their heads
Driver and passenger, killed instantly -- As Charly hops nimbly from her 50 mile-an-hour
Over to the tanker
Dump-stuffs a new clip, as Fades from the race, driverless
Whipping out of control
away behind them -- Takes out the , spray of metal
Three seconds, and Charly's taken out two pursuers
- The door files open and the  sees
Bloody
Demonic
Wisely leaps out,  from view -- Charly snags his hat as he goes by, plops it on her head
into the drivers' seat, double-clutches -- pours on the steam
Five seconds
She owns the tanker
forward into the lead
Slams the truck from behind,  it -- Sends it  into a park bench
Glass sprays
She owns the road
On the seat beside her: an -5 machine gun
She's set
Throws a   turn onto a sidestreet
Donates most of her tires to New York
-   - Charly's on fire
Senses heightened
Eyes tick back and forth like a machine
Heading downhill, out of town
Hang on, Catey
She hits the brakes
flash of
ripping , dies away -- The brake pedal is all play
Nothing
She's in a runaway truck
*No, not fair, not fucking fair
*
Barreling onward
lunging behemoth
Can't stop, Catey, can't
- , at road's end
Beyond it, a quarter-mile plunge
Downhill over rocky terrain -- To St
'
Looming stone structure
Closed now
Vast empty
Tears on her cheeks
Lights a cigarette
Takes a long drag, exhales: Suck my dick, every one of you bastards
Blows through the chain-link fence
Mud blows skyward
Trees, blasted to splinters
Buffeted inside the
Cries out as Charly fights to contain the beast
"Fuck you," slyly retorts the beast
She  and caroms off the sides like a mad pinball -- And all the windows   concussively and the front tires go with a volcano -
as the beast goes canting to one side, ponderous,
It keels over on its side
Still doing fifty
Slows itself by    , shears them off like saplings
Whacks the side of the chapel
Keeps going
Charly is  from the cab
Pinwheels through space like a broken doll, bursts through a
The glass ruptures as she catapults through
Hits on her stomach, bounces
Slides to a stop, rolls over -- herself aside just in time, as a towering to earth an inch from her head, showers marble
Concussion dies away
Silence
Echoes
- The tanker slides,  planters one by one
Comes to rest in a central
Lies there, a hissing dinosaur
'   is still affixed to the truck's underbelly: *280 degrees*
- Charly, semi-conscious
Rolls onto her back, gasping
Stares at the gathered saints
Swallows hard
Sucking it up, preparing
Rolls to one knee, plants her foot
She's got to make that truck
On her feet now
Stumbling forward
One arm hugging her guts
Cross-eyed, so hard to focus
left foot, right foot, get it done, bitch, yes it's *supposed* to hurt that much, flings open the door and she's so brave that for a second we think she might make it
Timothy kicks her in the head
Charly flies back
Hits and
Fetches up against a bannister, --
Timothy calmly shuts the door behind him
Consults his tiny gauge -- *297 degrees*
Call it four minutes to detonation
got a chopper on the way, lots of time
He sheds his coat
Stows his gun
Removes a
Drapes the coat on the bannister
Flicks open the knife
Oh, honey
Only four inches
You'll feel me
He approaches, almost casually
Charly staggers erect
Adopts a killing stance
Instinct
She can barely stand
'  - hears a garbled, pained voice over his headset: (
) Point team leader, reporting
She's
incapacitated the truck
'm damaged, sir,  believe 'm dying
Instructions
Continue dying
Out
He leans back
Stares sightlessly
Loosens his tie, hits the intercom and says: Anthony, get me the President
He takes out a bottle of Scotch
: - Charly and Timothy
They circle, two pros
You've lost a step, Chuck
Muscles never recovered from -section, 'll bet
Am  right
Never watching the eyes, the eyes are liars, they watch the The gathered saints look on, neutral
Please, man
She's only
eight
she's a beautiful little girl
His concentration never falters as he says: She's a worthless bitch
know it 'cause she came out of me
He  with the knife, she spins away -- He gets hold of one arm and  her, up and over
She  through space
Twists in mid-air
Lands like a cat
Almost
Staggers forward
They circle
It's called shock, Charly
Your body wants to go into shock
Fuck you, your breathing's lousy
Charly  herself
Avoids a stab at her throat, eats that for breakfast, spins, slams the knuckles of her right hand into Timothy's ribs
Busts one
He snarls,  her wrist:
Wrist, broken
She  in pain, falls back Circling again
Charly cannot walk a straight line
Look at you
You're out of your motherfucking league, dearie
She looks up at him from sunken eyes shot through with red, and in those eyes we glimpse it; the , laughing
as Charly whispers: You want a piece
Take my shoulder
He lunges with the knife
She ducks, trips on purpose and , all that's missing is the plate -- And
In goes the knife, cuts deep and Charly looks him in the eye and  because sure enough, there's the bastard's , wide open
Boot-strikes, --
Shears the knee, and Timothy  in agony
Stumbles backward into the bannister -- Grabs his coat
Brings out the gun, it  --
Charly dives for cover
Rips the knife from her own shoulder and flings it
Takes him in the shoulder
Topples him back
Up and over, flailing
Drops from sight
Charly falls back
Pause
Sucking air
Sits down hard
Legs splayed
Looks down at herself, oh, God
There's a hole in her chest
- The doors burst open and here she comes
Trauma, severe
Shock, blood loss -- She makes for the tanker
For her kid
Hitches
Staggers
Going on sheer guts
The  brandishes his radio mic: Got her
Heading for the tanker, thirty yards out
She's all over the place, something's wrong with her
Left foot, right foot, she's not running, she's falling in a straight line -- Reaches the tanker
Staggers against the inverted chassis
Above her
*Cover your ears*
She raises her gun
Fires
-
Lock springs to pieces
tumbles to the pavement, dazed and confused
Casts about -- She springs to her feet
Comes running and flings both arms around her mother
-- That one puts Charly out for a few seconds
, excruciating
Comes to her senses, swaying like a clothesline in a high wind
Run
get out
Don't go away again, Please
Charly grabs Caitlin's head
Turns it
Facing the Red numerals: *301 degrees*
The truck's a bomb
gonna blow up, 'm right behind you, go
Caitlin hovers, torn
Charly summons a gutteral : *Go and don't look back*
In the end, Caitlin relents
, toward the surrounding woods
Charly watches her go
Nods, satisfied -- Collapses
Hits the tarmac and splays in a heap
Breath wheezing in and out
Already the pavement is staining red
As, within ten seconds of the command, she promptly her mother, looks back -- Stops dead
There's a corpse underneath the truck
It isn't moving
It isn't breathing
It isn't laughing or crying
Or hurting, not anymore
*Mommy, no
*
Bomb forgotten
Danger forgotten
Her tiny arms pumping, feet slapping pavement -- She returns to her mother
Grabs one knife-bloodied shoulder, oblivious of the wound
Jerks back and forth
Frenzied
It's okay
'm sorry  left, please wake up, come on please
Cheek against the pavement
One lifeless eye
Bloodshot and sightless
Government vehicles, pulling up now
At the edge of the parking lot
100 yards away, give or take
Numerous
The Little Debbie panel truck
crouch behind cars
Weapons trained on the wounded behemoth
- The side door   and a limping figure emerges, frantically signaling for the chopper: ' got murder in his eye
banks, coming in low as he hauls himself aboard
Sir, your shoulder -- Fuck the shoulder, knee's worse
Just bring me around and hold her steady
'm not leaving until  know the bitch is dead
He grabs an automatic rifle
- She adheres to Charly's motionless form
Looking small and terrified
Whispers in her mother's ear
Soft and low: Mommy, get up now
You just stop it, Mommy, you stop being a little baby
Stop it, you're not dead,  know you're not dead so you get up now
Face contorted, she strikes out
Flails
Charly
*Don't you die*, you get up now, Goddammit
Life is pain, you just get used to it, and stand up *right this minute*, Mommy
Life is pain, do it, you bitch
*Do it*
Tears coursing in rivulets
Little fists clenched
Then -- It might be a trick of the wind
Tiny aspiration, not enough breath to fog a mirror
mommy
here
solitary tear appears in the wide-open staring eye
One fingernail, then
Scratches feebly
Toes, shifting
Seeking purchase
, planting itself
, a rictus of pain
Rising up
*Standing*
Full height now, flexing one deadly arm
She hugs her daughter and says: You're grounded
Overhead, the  of rotor blades
Charly gasps for breath
Cracks open the
no bullets
Swell
Scans the pavement
There
-5 machine gun lies twenty feet from her
Twenty miles, same difference
Across the pavement, even farther away: Timothy's car
*305 degrees*
Charly swallows hard: 'm gonna get the gun, you run for that car
We go on three, okay
One
Two
*Three*
They break cover
Into the open
Right at their feet
Geysers of asphalt, shot skyward -- sprays the blacktop from above
Ruthless
Charly goes insane
Lurches, crazed, to the cab of the truck
Thumbs the mike and says: Somebody get that motherfucker off me
got a kid here,  got my eight year-old daughter, *Jesus Christ*
It's Christmas Eve, who are you *people*, fucking pull him off
Do you hear me
: We don't know whose they are
We don't know where we are
- The temperature gauge: *308 degrees*
She clutches Caitlin
Shouting into the mic: Distract him, for God's sake give me ten seconds, please, 'm begging somebody, anybody, *she's my daughter*
sour-looking   stands before a row of cars and the Little Debbie panel truck
Expressionless beaurocrat
Lifts the mic to his lips and says: Negative, ma'am, we understand your request, but we've decided to go ahead and let this play out
Behind him, the back of the panel truck
car outward into space --   atop two sedans
Blows out their windshields
Flings itself to the pavement and  forward, zero to sixty
At the wheel
Making a suicide run
Face a   of deadly purpose
We have no idea why someone who looks like him is alive
- *Distraction*, just enough: The pilot banks toward the
Where are *you* going
Timothy grabs the stick -- '
Does a   across the blacktop
Goes for the
Chopper again,  in low and fast -- dives, rolls -- Comes up with the   and falls flat on her back, points it skyward: Suck on it
She fires
Blows the chopper's
The craft pitches to the side -- Dumps Timothy out the door
Flailing
Head over heels, he  -- Lands atop the , right on the silver tank and *burns*
Actually  at 310 degrees Celsius, steam pouring off him like a vampire in daylight, --
Die screaming, motherfucker
She watches as he slips from sight
off the tanker now, approaching
Wind, biting cold
Ground black and bloody in the moonlight
, powers across the lot, pedal to the metal
Followed at a distance of fifty yards by half a dozen squawling  , flashers turning
Henessey stomps the brake
to a stop, tires cooking
open the passenger door as Charly collapses into the car,  in her arms
The kid says: Hurry
The truck is a bomb
Yeah, yeah
What else, we got a fucking lightning rod on the roof
No, Caitlin, *don't check*
He
Hey
you're bleeding
think that's yours
Right, sorry
He inadvertently smacks a light pole
fly
*You're a bad driver
Who said you could drive*
-    - They have to drag Timothy inside the car
The engine as it leaps forward, trailing the other  -- Scarred and hideous, he stares after Charly, screaming: *Somebody do her, somebody kill that fucking whore, kill her*
That's when the helicopter crashes
The pilot does everything but flap his arms -- Forget it
Rotor touches pavement -- Blows to pieces
They  go
Snapped off
Blown like rockets in every direction
as a rotor blade whistles right through the windshield of his car
Shears off his
Blows out the in a shower of glass and hurtles onward,  out of control
Strikes the tanker
Boom
Imagine God in Monte Carlo
Tossing dice the length of a craps table
Now, imagine the dice are
- Henessey flies out of the parking lot and  the  as the firestorm    behind him
Cars, heading his way --
Fights the wheel, swerving through the woods as all around him,   crash down
into and out of the trees, peekaboo
Some go flying past
Striking in front like meteors, the earth
Caitlin screams: Don't hit the cars
Henessey favors her with a foul look
looks up and sees  flying overhead, trailing concrete
Then they're
Car slingshots onto the highway and races forward,
Behind it, the sky is aglow, fiery traces
Bits of earth, trees, pavement
: As they roar out of town, we see burning woods and a  approximately 150 yards in diameter -- St
Peter's Seminary no longer exists
: -    - Henessey coasts to the side of the road and stops
He lays his head on the steering wheel, sucking air
Looks at Charly: Sorry, can't drive
Are you okay
(grimaces) Are you
stupid
funny thing
You aren't going to die
am
Charly offers him that soft, sad little smile
know
Henessey starts to fade
breathing labored
Reaches up
strokes Caitlin's hair
Smiles at her: Hey, gorgeous
know something
you got your mother's eyes
don't let
nobody tell you different
Slumps back in the seat
Gazing at Charly
single tear runs from one bloodshot eye
He whispers: Scared
to be nobody
without a ripple
please
remember me
(beat) Love you
Dies
Charly leans on the dash
Cries for awhile
For herself
for Henessey
for this Godawful planet, and everything else
: - in the glow of a Winnie the Pooh nightlight
Next to her sleeping daughter's bed -- back to the very beginning of the film, it's been a long kiss goodnight
An elderly  pokes his head in
She doesn't look up
Um, Ma'am
Ambulance is here
They'll be right in
The shadowy figure nods
Remains seated
Stays awhile in the dark
Keeping vigil
Snow slithers against the glass
: - emerges from a guest cottage, flanked by his aide Harry
They'll push for dismantlement of our apparatus in Chile, but we've got a degree of plausible deniability
Harry's  comes down on a circular slab of  -- and a voice from the grave says: (
) Stay very still
Stops him in his tracks, stops him dead -- As   steps from the nearby trees
Stands, twenty yards downrange
Beretta leveled at both of them
Two months, you barely notice the limp
She stands there in sleeveless top and short skirt and looks like a million
Thumbs a metal box, click-
red   blinks on
Good morning, 'm Charly
The slab you're standing on is actually a land mine
Keep your foot on the pressure plate, nothing happens
Step off the stone, we'll all be wearing you
steps forward
The gun shifts
Targets him
Charly,  know we've treated you poorly, please, it was just business -- She reaches in a pocket
Tosses him a cellular phone -- He catches it as though it were a live snake
My terms are these
Call State and order full disclosure on your personal correspondence
Then disband Chapter, effective immediately
In exchange
won't shoot you, and  won't make you stand on that mine
won't touch you
won't touch you
promise
You
you promise
He swallows hard
Looks to his aide
back to her
Charly takes a deep breath
Scans the flowers, face placid
It's really quite lovely today
Maybe she'll start a garden
Perkins clicks off
Look at Charly: It's done
Now, you promise
you won't shoot me
won't make me get on the mine
promise
She smiles
Shifts her aim and shoots the other guy
Perkins' eyes  in sudden realization
He  forward, grabs the aide, holding him up
desperately propping his dead weight atop the land mine
Goddamn you,  can't hold him
You bitch
- Henessey's   has been restored to a cherry red
It purrs along the boulevard, Charly at the wheel
Hair blowing
She talks on the cellular phone: Yes, Mr
President, you have my assurance that Perkins' latest operation has been rendered beyond salvage
Behind her a    blows skyward
Showers the road a ways back
He's not in the greatest shape either
- He speaks from the oval office, face grave: owe you an astounding debt of thanks, Colonel
Would it be impertinent to ask if you'd consider working for State again
The moneys involved would be substantial
Out of the question
've got a stack of papers to grade
Listen, before go,  need a small favor
- ,  - Henessey's - stands in the open doorway, flanked by her son
Two uniformed  speak solemnly: #1 As  say, we can only apologize for the system, Ma'am, but it's confirmed that your husband is innocent of the crime for which he was imprisoned
This is a photograph of the actual criminal
He shows her a mug shot of
#1 petty thief, now deceased
'll respect your wishes should you choose to file charges against the State Attorney
In the eyes of a young boy, Henessey finds redemption
-    - Sun, passing into mystery
Wheatfield, rippling
Caitlin is in the yard, chasing a big floppy-eared Labrador
On the porch, a  chirps
comes out, sits beside his wife  as she finishes eating
Says softly: Just talked to Dr
Sullivan, she's gonna need the full braces
Even with your teaching, insurance won't cover it
don't know what to do
Pause
Charly says nothing
The dog parades up to Caitlin with a stick in its jaws
farm truck goes by, a faraway speck
Charly absent-mindedly rolls a steak knife in her fingers
Eyes far away
It never occurs to her what she's done until the chirping stops
Ten feet away, the knife quivers
