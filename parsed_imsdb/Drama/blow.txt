The view changes and tiny dots appear on the hillside vegetation
We realize the dots are people
Workers swinging long steel machetes in slow methodical rhythm the South American Indian  clearly now
Their tar stained teeth
Their gaunt faces riddled with crow's feet
Their jaws chewing away on huge wads of coca leaves as they collect the harvest
-  - Old rickety trucks carrying the huge green tractor-sized bales speed along the narrow road
-  - The bundles are undone and Columbian women separate out the leaves
Tribes of underweight workers carry armload after armload of the harvest and ritualistically dump them into a gigantic cannibal pot which sits on top of a raging bonfire
The leaves are being boiled down and a huge plume of smoke streaks the sky
Wizened Indios brave the heat and shovel ashes into the pot to cool the solution
-  - primitive but enormous makeshift lab contains all the equipment
The machinery
The solutions
The over-sized vats
Dark-skinned bandoleros smoke cigarettes and sport automatic weapons at all the points of entry

In all honesty,  don't feel like what 've done is a crime and  think it's illogical and irresponsible for you to sentence me to prison
None of the real criminals of the world ever end up behind bars
mean, when you think about it, what did  really do
Cross an imaginary line with a bunch of plants
You say that 'm an outlaw, you say that 'm a thief, but where's the Christmas dinner for the people on relief
George stops when his attorney stamps on his foot
The court officers roll their eyes and the judge smiles
Those are very interesting concepts you have, Mr
Jung
Unfortunately for you, the imaginary line you crossed is real, the plants you brought with you are illegal, and what you did constitutes a crime
The judge slams his gavel
(') Bail is set at twenty-thousand dollars
-  - 1972 - George walks out, free on bond, to find Barbara waiting for him
She doesn't look so good
Surprise
Baby, you didn't have to come
What, and miss all the fun
'mon, not a chance
So, what's the verdict
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years
'll serve two
Two years
George,  can't wait that long
What
You're not going to wait for me
George,  went to the doctor
don't have two years
(
) Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off
-- - 1972 - George hits the gas and the car screams down the road
-   - 1973 - George and Barbara sit on the veranda drinking champagne and watching the sun go down over the Pacific
Barbara is completely bald
Rail thin, eyes sunken
But it doesn't matter
They're having a great time
They laugh and hold hands and laugh some more
-   - 1973 - Everyone is there
All in black
Barbara's casket is lowered into the ground and George climbs to his knees to push the first dirt on the grave
(
) Time is such a funny thing
look at where  am now, and in here, time inches along
So slow, it hardly seems like it moves
But back then, time went fast
-   - 1999 - George pushes dirt along the edge of a flower root
Still planting those sunflowers, he presses down firmly, standing before him is Barbara, still beautiful and young with flowing locks
George raises his hand and makes a small wave
Barbara opens and closes her hand
Bye bye
It went too fast
George looks down and Barbara is gone
No Barbara
-  -  - 1973 - George hops the fence like he did when he was a boy and goes in the back door
-  - Ermine looks at George blankly
Hi, Mom
Ermine just keeps looking at him
(') Surprised to see me
Take your boots off
You're tan
Mexico
Yeah
We heard all about it
want you to know 'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend
Barbara
Yes, Barbara
She was very pretty
Thank you
Have you been getting the money  sent you
You mean the drug money
Yes,  got it
Ermine's hands are trembling
She is emotional
She hugs George ferociously, not letting go
(') -d, son
Okay, Mom
It's okay
Where's Dad
George turns around to see Fred's beaming face
-  - George and Fred sit at the table, a bottle of Scotch sits between them
The glasses are raised
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face
and the winds of destiny carry you aloft
to dance with the stars
The glasses clink and the drinks are sucked down
- The bottle is dwindling
George and Fred are feeling it
You alright
George nods
Just low
You loved her, didn't you
You really loved her
Yeah, Dad
really did
What am gonna do
Tough spot
The glasses are refilled
You mad at me
Not mad
Yeah, you are
can tell by the way you look at me
just don't know what you're thinking
don't understand your choices
You know, the police are looking for you
know
'm great at what  do, Dad mean, 'm really great
Let me tell you something, son
You would have been great at anything
Something outside catches George's eye
light reflection
movement
George is up and on the move
(') Where are you going
- The front door opens and   pour into the house
- George is up the stairs in a flash
George
'  - George slams the door behind him, moves over to the window, and opens it
Cops everywhere
He's trapped
Out of options, he folds
He moves to the corner and sits down, turns on the train set
on the door is heard Agent,
George Jung, you are under arrest
Open the door, son
- They lead George outside in handcuffs
Ermine and Fred watch
had no choice
George stops and looks at his mother, for the first time realizing her betrayal
(') Don't look at me like that
What was supposed to do
You're in our house
What, was  supposed to be an accomplice
As George is led to the police car, Ermine follows
(') You don't think people know you're a drug dealer
Everyone knows
It's no secret
How do you think that reflects on me
Every time  go out, 'm humiliated
see the stares
hear the whispers
How do you think that makes me feel
Did you ever once stop and think of me
George's head is pushed down as he is put in the squad car
He looks up at his mother
(') So you go to jail
It's for your own good
You need to straighten your life out
- 1974 - : George is being led through a series of gated corridors
Prisoner in
As he walks, he takes in the faces of the other inmates
He arrives at his cell and notices he has a
(') Prisoner in
The cell door opens and George steps inside
There are books and papers spread out over both bunk beds
George watches as his cellmate quickly clears everything off the top bunk
Apparently, the papers are private
George puts his things down and the little man proffers his hand
He is dark, polite and Colombian
My name is Diego Delgado
How do you do
-   - 1974 - George pushes his tray through the cafeteria line
Diego is behind him
If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place
What
Your offense
Why are you here
don't want to talk about it
Intriguing
see
Would you like to know my crime
Not really, no
No
don't like a lot of conversation, Diego
Me, too
Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good
But we are roommates, okay
And we must talk to each other
am arrested for stealing cars
For the grand theft auto
Okay
So, now it is your turn
Now you will tell me, okay
You will tell me why you are here
George says nothing
He keeps eating his food
(') Oh, come on, George
If we are to be friends, we must trust each other
Murder
Ah, yes
The murder
- '  - George lays on his bunk, smoking
Diego is on the bottom bunk, furiously writing on a notepad
He flips through his books and rustles his papers
George peeks over the side to see what Diego is doing
What do you got there, Diego
Nothing
Just a little project
What kind of project
Never mind
Not for you to worry
thought you said we were roommates
That we should talk about everything
You have your intrigues
have mine
This is a happy day for me, George
Nine months from today,  will be in Medellin sipping champagne
In nine months,  am free
How much time do you have
Twenty-six months
Twenty-six months
For murder
must be your lawyer
've got to get out of here, Diego
Only two ways  know to leave here early
One is to escape
What's the other one
-  - George is trying to teach basic education to the inmates
The room, mostly black and hispanic, is hostile
They don't want to learn
Alright, let's open our books
#1 Man, fuck you
#2 We ain't opening shit
#1 You just the warden's boy
We on to you
You just trying to knock some time off, asskissing motherfucker
Diego watches as the room reacts with laughter
This ain't going to be easy
Alright
You're right
want to get out of this shithole as fast as  can
And  don't want to do this any more than you do
But for me to walk early, some of you have to graduate
You, forget about it
You're hopeless, go to sleep
The room laughs again
#3 Damn, homeboy, you got ruined
But the rest of you could get diplomas and get jobs when you're on the outside
The room looks at him
They ain't buying it
#1 Shit, 'm in for life
#2 'm a criminal
ain't getting no motherfucking job
We can learn some criminal shit, too
Alright, 'll make you a deal
What if half the time, we learn about George Washington, and the other half, 'll teach you how to smuggle drugs
#2 Man, you don't know dick about smuggling no drugs
was arrested in Chicago with six hundred and sixty pounds of grass think that qualifies me
Diego looks up from his desk, suddenly very interested
#1 How did you get a hold of six-hundred and sixty pounds of dope
Flew it in from Mexico on a single engine Cessna
Now, do we have a deal or not
They react
They're in
(') Alright, the first thing you need to know about smuggling drugs is that it's easy
The  are a bunch of losers
They couldn't find their dicks in a whorehouse
They don't know what the fuck they're doing
Diego watches George winning over the room
He listens intently to George's every word
His wheels are turning
- '  - Lights out
Diego and George lay in their cots
George is tired
Diego is not
George
Hey, George
listen to what you say to the class today about the smuggling
You are a magico, ah
George doesn't respond
(') never believed you were a murderer knew
knew you are a magico
have seen it in you
It's in your spirit
'm tired, Diego
Go to bed
You like to make the boundaries disappear
It's not only the money, is it, George
The adventure is part of the victory
It's the thrill, ah
Good night
In my country,  am a magico
man with a dream
man on the rise
To take nothing and make it something, okay
have failed my dream, but will accomplish
That is why  am in your country
Yes,  lose my freedom
But they do not take my dream
Do you have a dream, George
would if  could get some sleep
Yes, you have a dream
And maybe you accomplish your dream
But yet you failed
Why
Because  got caught
No, my brother
Because they caught me
You failed because you had the wrong dream
Diego climbs off his bunk and looks George square in the eye
(') George
What do you know about cocaine
-   - don't know, Diego
've got a good thing going already
Everybody smokes pot
It's easy
Cocaine is a rich man's drug
It's too expensive
No, no
That is where you are wrong
For us, it is cheap
In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo Miami, we sell for sixty
George's interest is piqued
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo
And that's wholesale
Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand
Oh my -d
Yes
And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana
Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions
Jesus Christ
Jesus fucking Christ
Now do you see what  am saying
Getting it here is no problem
Trust me
'll fly it in myself if  have to
What about supply
How much can we get
Don't worry
We will talk of everything
We have the time
You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine
- '  - Diego and George pouring over Diego's plans
Discussing, planning, plotting
What type of planes do you have
Four passenger, single engine Cessna
How many kilos can we fit in these planes
don't know
hundred, hundred and fifty
How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami
Fifteen hundred
We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel
We'll refuel in the Bahamas
know someone there
Great
love the Bahamas
-  - 1976 : , 1976
George is at a payphone
He drops in about a million quarters until he is finally connected
Diego Delgado, please
Allo
Diego
It's George
George, hallo
Today is the day, ah
Are you out
Yeah, 'm out
Congratulations, brother
've been waiting for you
How are we doing
Perfect, George
Perfect
Everything is fine down here
Everything is all set up
Do we need a plane
How does this work
When do  see you
Slow down, George
Slow down
Fred exits the liquor store carrying two bottles of Dom Perignon
As he catches George's eye, he lifts the bottles showing them off
George holds up his finger, indicating he'll be just a second
(') You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody
Ho ho ho
Ha ha ha
We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes
can't go anywhere, Diego
'm on parole
can't leave the state
But you must
It's the only way
just got released five minutes ago
George, are we gonna do this or not
-  -  - 1976 - George steps outside and spots Diego
Their eyes meet
Diego looks different, relaxed
He wears a straw hat, shorts, and sports a healthy tan
The two men embrace
Good to see you, Diego
Yes
Look around you
The sun
The water
The women
It's better than Danbury, no
Come on
have some friends  would like you to meet
-  -  - 1976 - Diego and George sit with five other Colombians, most notably, a man named
The mood is not friendly
Fifteen kilos
Seven and a half in each suitcase
You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery
Okay
Not so fast
would like to go over the details
What details
put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs
Tell me about the suitcases
What is the make and the color
Samsonites
Red
No tags
Cesar thinks about it
Hmm
see
Will there be clothes in the suitcase
What
Yeah, sure
Whose cloths
Your clothes
My clothes, your clothes
What does it matter
would like to know the contents
Every detail is important
What are we doing here, Diego
This guy's a clown
He's talking about clothes
demand to know everything
do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone  don't know
It's a lousy fifteen kilos
piss fifteen kilos
The coca is my responsibility
You're a fucking amateur
Gentlemen, please
There is no need to be impolite
Cesar, this will be fine
You have my word
George, Cesar is just being thorough
That's all
Very well
But just remember, Mr
Jung
will be with you the whole way
And will be watching
-  - 1976 - George carries the two Samsonites over to customs inspections
It's a long walk
George's heart beats hard
The sound is audible and grows with every beat
- Cesar lurks at the baggage carousel
(
) When you're carrying drugs across the border, the idea is to remain calm
The way  do it is to think of something pleasant, a fun party, a moment of triumph
sexual encounter actually project myself to that place
Anything to keep your mind off the fact that you're going to jail for a very long time if they find the fifteen kilos of cocaine in your suitcases
George stands in front of the customs agent
He tries his best to look relaxed as the agent reviews his documents
On vacation
Yes
On vacation for only one day
-
-
The heartbeats are very loud
(weak smile) My brother's wedding
Imagine that, huh
George's breathing is labored and his swallowing reflex doesn't seem to be working
Cesar passes through, eyeballing George the whole time
Open your bags, please
George opens the Samsonites
Super dry mouth
- The beats are deafening now
Cesar nervously monitors the situation from the payphones
(') Whose clothes are these
Mine
The customs agent holds up a woman's undergarment
Cesar throws up his hands in frustration
And this
What can  tell you
Different strokes
George winks at the customs agent, who shakes his head before finishing the inspection
Alright, go ahead
-  - George moves to the payphones, sets down the two suitcases, and pretends to make a call
Not inconspicuously, Cesar grabs the bags and walks quickly out of the terminal
-  - 1976 - Diego, Cesar, George and  , a silver haired executive type, lounge around the mini-suite
Cesar still has that crazy look in his eye
Three-hundred kilos it is, then
beautiful Latin woman enters and kisses both Diego and Cesar
Her name is , and friendly she is not
(') Has everyone met Inez
This is George
've told you about him
And this is friend, Jack Stevens
The men proffer their hands, but she just looks at them like ants before sitting down next to Diego
(') Try to be more respectful, darling
My apologies
But she is mistrustful of Americans
Shall we proceed
Let's hear it again, Mr
Stevens
'll fly down on a Friday, refuel in the Bahamas, and then to Medellin
Friday
Inez addresses Diego and Cesar only
She speaks in Spanish
The conversation is about "Why Friday
"  Inez has some problem with it
Diego explains
And Inez is reassured
Please, continue
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic
Why are you speaking
Excuse me
You
Your responsibility is over
You do not fly
You are not a pilot
You are not a distributor
You introduced us to Mr
Stevens and the use of his airplane
That is all
You make a percentage
generous one
And you're lucky to get that
see
How much
Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo
For everyone
For you, and you, and you
He indicates George, Diego and Jack Stevens
(') There is no negotiation
Three-million dollars
That is all
want two
Gee, Jack, a million each had such a nice ring to it
No way
'm doing all the work
Taking all the risk, and it's my plane
Diego and George look at each other
(') Hey, you guys don't have to do shit
Just sit back and collect your money
You good with this
Diego nods
(') Alright
This is too much for Inez to handle
She starts screaming machine gun Spanish
Something about a "lousy two-hundred and fifty-thousand dollars," and how Diego is "such a coward" to give away all his money
Diego is embarrassed but tries to remain calm
You will watch what you say
Especially around George
He is my brother and he speaks as good Spanish as you
But Inez is wild
She starts in again, a log of "Putos ('s)", and "Cojones" and "Maricones (gay/sissys)
"  Even Cesar is uncomfortable
Diego stands
(') Okay
That's enough
Get your hands off me
Inez takes a swing at Diego and catches him full across the face
Time stops in the room
Question
What will Diego do
Answer:
Diego swings back and a full scale is on
Cesar continues the conversation
It's surreal
As if Diego and Inez weren't beating the shit out of each other right in front of them
Do you have pictures of your kids
What
'll need to see them
Also need their names and the names of their schools
We are trusting you with ninety million dollars worth of coca, Mr
Stevens
Without your children, there is no deal
Stevens thinks about it
Kids as collateral
Inez and Diego are still duking it out
But Diego finally gets the upper hand and drags her into the bedroom
Fine
So if that's all, 'll be leaving now
Cesar walks him to the door
Don't forget the pictures
Diego calls from the other room
(
) George
George, come in here
-  - Diego has put Inez in the bathroom and is holding the door closed
She pounds and kicks and screams in frustration, but he pays no attention
What's the matter, George
What's the matter
We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit
million dollars for our first run is not bad, George
It is bad
It's chump change
We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border
We're getting screwed
know
And what happens when these guys stop paying
Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out
Then where are we
That's my George, always thinking
The door is yanked open to reveal Inez
She is in a rage
Diego slams it in her face
(') This is only part of the business, George
very small part
Don't worry, there is so much more to do
Which reminds me,  need a favor from you
must go to Colombia
What is it, George
Because  have to get home
've got a parole officer waiting for me
need you to go to Miami
-  - 1977 - George gets out of a taxi to find hanging around outside an apartment
He checks the address and moves over to the men
'm George
Friend of Diego's
The Colombian men are not impressed
They grab George and pull him inside
- George is pinned against the wall and the Colombian men all start screaming at him in Spanish
There seems to be a problem
man, , steps forward
He is the one who speaks English
Callate
Where's Diego
don't know
He sent me
'm George
Oh,  see
George
Well, that explains everything
Open your mouth, George
George's puzzled look is replaced by a gun barrel in his face
Alessandro presses it against George's front teeth
(') Now, you listen to me
Are you hearing me
George nods
(') You see this
He indicates two duffel bags stuffed with fifty kilos of cocaine
(') 've been holding this shit for him for three weeks
You tell Diego  don't appreciate it
You tell him  want my money by Friday
Can you do that
Um-hmm
- '  - George sits on his bed, reading
Two duffel bags are tucked away in the closet
Ermine pokes her head in
You have a phone call
George picks up the phone
(
) George
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you
It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money
(
) Bad news, George
'm in Colombia
Well, you better get here fast
'm sitting on
George notices Ermine is loitering in the hallway, eavesdropping
(') Hi, Mom
George acknowledges her before shutting the door in her face
(') 'm sitting on fifty fucking keys
Get your ass up here
- ,  - It's a South American prison
Diego is on the pay phone
It's a little hard to get away right now
'm afraid you're on your own
'  -   - 1977 - George and Derek sit in the living room with
, a hippie ish looking professor
On the table sits various paraphernalia
Scales, beakers, test tubes, and a hot box
George and Derek watch as Mr
scoops some of George's cocaine and sets it onto the two-inch metal plate
What we're doing is measuring the purity
Pure coke melts out a hundred and eighty-five, a hundred and ninety degrees
Cutting agents melt much lower
About a hundred degrees
Quality product starts melting at a hundred and forty degrees
That's what 'm hoping for
Mr
turns the dial
120
130
140
(') Good
150
160
(') Jesus Christ
170
180
(') Holy fucking Mary
Jesus, fuck me running
Where did you get this shit
At one-hundred and eighty-seven degrees, the white powder dribbles off the hotplate and melts away
(') Damn
Can  do a fucking line
Mr
puts his nose in the powder
George pulls Foreal aside
What did  tell you
It's great and everything, but what am going to do with all this
Sell it
Jesus Christ, George,  don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine
Just sell it, Derek
Alright, but it's gonna take me a year
-   - 1977 - Money everywhere
All over the floor, the counters, the chairs, and even in the sinks
George and Derek count the money patiently, writing the dollar amount in yellow high lighter on the top of each stack, before wrapping it with a rubber band
Thirty-six hours
can't believe it
Everything is gone in thirty-six hours
think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek
Touche
But to the victor belong the spoils
George divides the money
There's a hell of a lot
(') Half a million for you
Half a million for me
One-point-three five for the Colombians
Nice doing business with you, George
Not bad for a weekend's work, huh
-  - Immaculate in his white turtleneck and sunglasses, George walks with two aluminum cases
He is greeted by Alessandro and his thugs
Greetings, Mr
George
Where do you guys want to count
On the plane
What plane
We going someplace
Where we headed
You have your money
It's all there
What the fuck is going on
They usher him away
-  - : , The lear jet lands
-  ,  - The blazer pulls into a long driveway
They approach a gate where   with -10's stand guard
The gate opens
open the door for George and roughly usher him over to a Jeep within the confine
They frisk him top to bottom
Diego is leaning against another Jeep and waits for George to be released
George, good to see you, my brother
What the fuck is going on
When did you get out of jail
Pablo used his influence
Now, George, watch what you say
Everybody hears everything
lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America
Life is cheap here, you know
No offense, but you know what 'm saying
Yeah
Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking
Right
Now who is the person in California
The connection
Just a friend
Who
need to know
Ah, never mind
We'll talk about it later
Yeah
You do the talking
The sound of a young man, a , struggling can be heard in the distance
From another area,   emerges
He is singular in purpose
He is handed a pistol and moves quickly over to the man and quietly speaks a few words
And then, without emotion, he shoots the maleton in the head
George and Diego, who is visibly shaken, watch
Escobar is handed a towel, and he wipes the splattered blood off his hands, as he moves back
He will see you now
(to Diego) Not you
There must be some kind of mistake
No mistake
Mr
Escobar will see Mr
Jung alone
You are to wait here
George hesitates
It's alright, George
You go
This way, please
The large Colombian man escorts George towards the area where the maleton was just shot
George looks back at Diego as he is led away
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day
Actually, it was three
The man who gives us the airplanes
The man from America
The mafia
Chicago
Boom boom
Hollywood
You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George
It would be my pleasure
Good
Very good
Welcome, my friend
Welcome to my country
Escobar moves over to embrace George
George returns it, and their hands come together
George can't help it
He reflexively looks at his hands
Escobar understands
(') The man in the garden
He was full of courage
Un sapo
Un rata - no good
But he could have run, fled the country
Gone to the policia
But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die
Yes
But, never mind
am thinking we can do much together
This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business
To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience
The fifty kilos could have been a big problem
And  don't like problems
With all respect, Padrino
Diego is my partner
do not do business without him
Escobar looks at him with a cold stare
But George doesn't flinch
His face reveals nothing
Finally, a smile breaks across Pablo's lips
like you, George
You are loyal
That is good
That is rare
Maybe crazy
Yes
can tell already
You are like me
look at you and  see myself
It's in the eyes, no, George
Yes, it is
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George
Yes, sir
As much as you can give me
As much as  can give you
Ha ha
Very good
like that
Come, George
Let us drive
We have much to talk about
Diego watches the two men walk outside
Escobar throws an arm around George's shoulder
Pablo hops into a Jeep and motions for George
The bodyguards come running
But Pablo waves them away
-  - Escobar pulls the Jeep off the road and parks it
Before them is a stunning panorama
like to come up here
To make the decisions
To be one with nature
It's beautiful
People tell me that  am crazy
That my business will never work in your country
What do you think, George
Escobar looks out over the vista, allowing George the time to respond in full
What do  think
don't want my answer to be influenced by what  want, so 'm going to have to say  don't know
Yes
do not know, either
What do you want, George
want money
Yes
Money
Which is what, George
Freedom
Power
Yeah, maybe
Family
Sure
Beautiful girls
Keep them coming
Keep them coming
Ah, yes
Ha ha
You are right
But money
Money
And Diego
Diego is my brother
Escobar looks at George a long time
He's inscrutable
Good
Take care of him, George
'm fond of him, but he is sometimes like a baby
Keep an eye on him, okay
-  - Diego is a little pissed off for being left for so long
He taps his foot and picks at his fingernails
Escobar and George pull up in the Jeep
Diego leaps to his feet
Padrino
Escobar wraps his arms around Diego in an embrace
Diego, mijo
've made a decision
We are going into business and  would like to start right away
- The following images are overlaid with snow falling and money dropping through frame
of George and Diego on the phone, wheeling and dealing, hands counting cash, and lines being drawn off mirrors
The effect is surreal and dreamy
- duffel bag is unzipped, revealing bricks and bricks of cocaine
Each marked with a "
"   knife punctures one of the bricks
mound of white powder is brought up to a man's nose
It's George who samples, and then it is sampled by the man he is doing business with
The shot widens   all the participants and dozens and dozens of duffel bags handshake seals the deal
Handshake after handshake after handshake
- George and Diego counting cash
It's everywhere
All over the floor, in two-foot stacks
Various transactions completed
- George and Diego count
It's ridiculous how much money there is
The stacks are now waist high and spill into other rooms
Inez is there, pacing the floor and rapid-fire talking on the phone
George and Diego, the Banditos
Cigars
Champagne
Arms around each other in camaraderie
In Diego's yellow Ferrari
With Inez, sunning on a yacht
More coke and more transactions
When the deals are with Derek Foreal, Diego is always notably absent
- The money is so high, it almost reaches the ceiling
There is nowhere to put it
George and Diego sit at the coffee table, dwarfed by the stacks of bills
There is a discrepancy in the count
Three million
counted it twice
It's two-point-five, George

George starts to pick up the money
'm calling it three
We're half a million off
Fuck it
'm not counting it again
Weight it
If it's sixty pounds, it's three
If it's fifty, it's two-point five
don't give a shit
Close enough
George moves down the hall looking for a place to stack the money, but there is no more room
(') Where do  put this
Try the back bedroom
George opens the back bedroom door to find wall-to-wall money
It's packed
There's no room
Try the closet
No luck there, either
George drops the money on the floor and moves back into the living room
We've got to do something about this

Armed Panamanian soldiers stand guard
The Panamanian officials and the   oversee the proceedings
Are you comfortable with this
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars
It's either here or someplace else
We've got to put it somewhere
Unless you want to launder it
And keep only forty-percent
No thanks
Then relax
It's a federal bank
Guaranteed by the government
And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles
No questions
No problems
All the pesados keep their money here
Even El Padrino
What do you worry
Everyone knows we are with Escobar
Who is going to fuck with us

All the pomp and circumstance Colombian money can buy

Policemen
And every smuggler north of Colombia
George sits with Diego and Inez at the table of honor
Inez is opening presents
Diego's tipsiness is a little out of character, but hey, it's his wedding day and a little champagne never hurt anyone
He drunkenly throws his arm around George's shoulder

Me

Can you believe 'm married, George
You're a lucky man, Diego

Pleased to meet you finally, George am Augusto Oliveras
My pleasure, Augusto
Diego has told me much about you
Congratulations on your conquest of the West Coast
How much bigger can we get
Sky's the limit
We're just beginning to tap the market
If it's accepted by actors and musicians, the rest will follow
They all agree
Mirtha still gives George the teeth from across the room
Diego returns to the table
We are talking about George's West Coast operation
Ah, George's mystery man
Yes, where is this man
When do we meet him
You don't meet him
George keeps this a secret
He's here meeting everyone, goes to Colombia and meets Pablo, but still keeps his secrets
Even from his brother

Put that shit away, they're here

The decor is, well, eclectic
It doesn't match the architecture
It's all so beautiful
What do you think, Dad
Yeah
Nice
Look at this credenza
If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that
It's got to cost a fortune
(quickly) It's a family heirloom

They're not cheap
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family
Oh,  see
Come on
'll show you the rest of the house
George and his father move outside

They move along the rear of the house
Classic cars line the driveway
(') You come from my body, remember
You're my baby boy
The same kid who would jump off a mountain if someone told him he couldn't do it
You haven't changed much
know the things you do
Not everything
But  get the picture and don't care
don't like it
It's not what  would have chosen for you, but it's your life
It doesn't have anything to do with me
He turns and looks at his boy
(') You're like your mother
You love money
Dad
No, it's good
You have a family
It's good if it makes you happy
It's nice to have nice things
Are you happy, son
Yeah, Dad
'm happy right now
-   - 1978 - Diego puts a straw in his nose and snorts a big gakker
His eyes are wide, his pupils dilated, and a weapon sticks out of the back of his pants
He knocks the dust off his nose before moving outside
George is on the porch, smoking a cigarette
Three years
How long have we been in business
Three years
Does she get to meet your connection
Was she good enough
Shut up, Diego
They're going to be here any minute
'm trying to concentrate
'm very angry with you, George
Very angry
You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife
woman
understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this
You and me
What do you need my connection for, Diego
What are you going to do with it
What do  do with it
Nothing
It's for peace of mind
It's for the principle
George doesn't have time for this
He checks the cylinders on his weapon and runs over possible scenarios in his mind
But Diego won't get off the soap box
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego
ain't telling you
It's just business
Now, shut up
You're driving me crazy
'm driving you crazy
No
You're driving me crazy
We had a dream
What happened to our dream

The suitcases are opened
The rules are the same
No English
No raising voices
No sudden movements
George offers their leader, , beers for his men, and is politely declined
The count starts
George and Diego riff through ten thousand dollar bundles
Diego is still acting pissy
He's mumbling to himself, making faces, slamming the money all around
The guys keep a close eye on him
Diego finishes a stack, throws one of the bags on the ground
The conversation is in Spanish unless otherwise indicated
Algun problema
No no no
no problema, amigo
El dinero esta todo aqui
Lleves las "llaves" y mas tarde lo contaremos
Okay
No problem
Que problema

The pressure is getting to one of the hoods

Courtesy of Benny, George is hit
The shoulder, the collarbone
It's hard to tell
(') Estoy bien, okay

No one has to know anything about this
Diego,  want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is

So beautiful
You look like you're about to burst
Thanks

Drunk somewhere

We need to discuss a few things
Where's Diego
He's not here, George
Yeah, well where is he
And who is this Norman
guy
That's all anyone is talking about
Norman
Norman
Do know him
Augusto lets out a big laugh
Norman Cay is not a person
He is an island, George
In the Bahamas
From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home
What
Augusto throws an arm around George's shoulder
Let us walk
From what  understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip

The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire
He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point
He what

Along with many others
You shouldn't stay away so long
That's impossible
We can't be up and running
Who's distributing
Augusto says nothing
But the ball is dropping in Times Square
10, 9, 8, 7
(') Oh, no
Happy New Year
Streamers, confetti, and champagne
George marches through the kissing guests and over to a phone
He's steaming
The music is up, so he has to scream
(') Hello, Derek
This is George
Am wearing lipstick
said, am  wearing lipstick
Because when 'm getting fucked,  want to make sure my face is pretty
You're buying directly from Diego, aren't you, you son of a bitch
Derek Foreal in full New Year's regalia, complete with party hat
don't want to get caught in the middle of this
That's between you and Diego
George's face scrinches in pain
(') It's nothing personal, George
Just business
Yeah

Just business
Right
Fuck you
The song ends, and George is left standing there screaming
(') bring you in, and this is how you repay me
You little homo

Blanca reaches into her purse, pulls out an ice pick folded in a piece of linen cloth, and puts it down in front of George
(') Vos lo tenes que matar, ahorita mismo
De lo contrario vas a quedar como un marica sin horror
#3 Mejor dicho vos sos un aculillado

Deja solo un huequito tan pequeno, que ni sangre le va a salir a ese malparido del Diego

Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta
El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima

George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano
No, no, no, no yo puedo arregarlo solo

Before him is Norman Cay
White sand beaches
Beautiful
Pristine
-  - Waiting for him is Cesar
Good to see you, George
It's been a long time
- The Yacht Club is a tavern style bar that juts out over the water
The crimson sky streaks the windows
Diego looks like Che Guavera
His hair is long, and a graying beard sticks through his gaunt face
The bar has been taken over by Diego's
Automatic weapons and accent this drunken setting
George is escorted through the door by Cesar, and the room quiets
All eyes on Diego and George
Diego rises
George,  am happy to see you
How are you, my brother
No more brothers, Diego
Of course we are brothers
Why do you say that
You hurt me, George
You fucked me, Diego

You went behind my back and you cut me out
No,  never
would not do that, George
Never
talked to Foreal, Diego
There is a pause
Diego's goons ready their weapons as Diego scoops up a cringer with his pinky and sniffs
Maybe you are right

One of the men says something in Spanish and everyone laughs
George is furious
He starts to tremble and his face turns red
(') Oh, boo hoo, boo hoo
So sad, George

So what
Who introduced you to Pablo Escobar
Me
Who introduced you to your fucking Colombian wife
Me
Who protected you when my friend Cesar Roza wanted to slice your fucking throat, huh
Who mad you millions and millions of dollars
Me
And what do  get in return
This
Accusations

This is my operation
My dream
So go home, George
Go back to your stupid little life
You can sell half grams to your fucking relatives for all  care
Because you are out
George lunges at Diego and is immediately grabbed
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man
George, don't be so emotional
This is business
Besides,  can't kill you, you are my brother
They lead him away
- George is getting the shit kicked out of him
His teeth broken, kicked in the head, the body, the groin
His arm stomped
Blood and broken bones
It's a king size beating
The men prop him up and Cesar reaches back and hits him with a haymaker

This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk
It is very difficult
Diego makes me a lot of money
If Diego goes so does the money

When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary
We must remember we have wives, friends, familia
Even familia that has not been born
But sometimes, we must forget as well

We want to teach the lesson
But we cannot
We must remember that life is the teacher
You're saying life will take care of Diego
Life will take care of everybody
Diego, me, you

What are we going to do
What are we going to use for money
Please, Mirtha

How will we live
Kristina sits there
She hears everything, so does Clara Blanca
Not in front of the kid
Don't give me that shit
You just better do something
She storms into the bedroom and slams the door
George stands there
Awkward silence
George goes to Kristina
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart
Don't be upset
What's happening to us
Tough question to answer

Are we gonna split up
No, never
Don't even think about that, it's impossible

Could
Kristina nods "no

George is driving while a jacked up Mirtha does a speed bump
cop is following in the distance
It is not okay
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha
Be cool, will ya
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive
Hey, why don't you just put a "'m doing cocaine" sign on the car
What is your fucking problem
My problem
We're broke, that's my fucking problem
And you're a fucking spy
What
That's right
Always spying, always judging
Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy
You let Diego fuck you in the ass
Maybe you are a fucking faggot
You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me
Mirtha grabs nuts
Those are my nuts
George tries to fend her off
The car swerves all over the road
It's turned into a full scale fist fight
The red lights of Florida's finest come up behind them and George is pulled over
-95 - Mirtha leaps out of the car, teary eyed, crazed and bloodied
The policemen step from their car
He's a fugitive and a fucking cocaine dealer
There's a kilo in his trunk right now
Take this sorry motherfucker to jail
George sits behind the wheel
He knows it's over

Inmates sit across from their families

'm divorcing you, George

And when you get out next week, you're going to pay support and that's the end of it
Alright
There's someone else
'm sorry
George just looks at her
His face is stone
But he is moved

You've been away a long time
Four years
Say something
What do you want me to say

You should know
You put me here
Fuck you, George
knew you'd say something like that
Always thinking about yourself
She moves away and drags nine-year old Kristina into the room
Kristina yanks her arm away and they get into a heated argument
Through the glass, George can't hear the words but it's clear that Kristina doesn't want to be here
My baby
She's so big
Mirtha forces Kristina over to the glass and keeps showing her, prompting her to talk
Kristina stares at George through the glass
Cool
Defiant
Angry
She picks up the phone and speaks, every word an accusation
thought you couldn't live without your heart
She drops the phone, walks away, and doesn't look back

What are you doing here
Nothing

Well, here  am
See
How are you doing
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay
Dad

You can call me Dad if you want

You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment
You assume all the bust risks
We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses
This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further
If not, we can forget we had this conversation
Sounds fine
'll need to meet everybody
They're over at the booth
Leon leads George over
(') Gentlemen, this is George
George, this is Ben,
and
George's eyes widen as he looks at the last man
It's Kevin Dulli
Holy shit, Dulli
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo
(
) That was it
Seeing Dulli after fourteen years sealed the deal for me
The rest was just details
My end was roughly five-hundred thousand
Kristina and  could have a good life for five hundred grand
Start over somewhere
One final score
That's all  needed
-  - Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie
Why don't we start small
No
have the space
figured it out
This is what  want to do
Alright
'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you
don't think there will be a problem
Five-thousand per kilo
Ha ha
That's too much, Georgie
Those days are over
The rate is one-thousand dollars

This is a one time thing, Gusto
One and 'm out
Give me a good price for old time's sake
What do you think

He carries her books
Let me ask you something
If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go
You mean, like a trip
Yeah, sure, whatever
Kristina thinks about it

Maybe California
George is amused by her answer
California
You can go anywhere in the world

No

California, huh

Yeah

Yeah, you will
Of course
Mirtha looks at her ex-husband
It's not all bad
Hey, look

You're a good father, George

You've gotten a lot better since then, huh pal

The years have not been kind
How's he doing
Well, he's out of the hospital, but there's not much anyone can do for him
It's just a matter of time
Listen, brought a tape recorder in case you wanted to say something to him

The Miami Herald
Inside is a full page letter addressed from Diego Delgado to Vice President George Bush

In exchange for immunity, Diego will rat out the entire cocaine business
Americans, Colombians, Noriega, Escobar, everybody
Just let him free

Is he going to walk
He's going down, George
It's election year

We know you hate this motherfucker
don't think so
Don't be stupid, George
We've got him
We've got him dead to rights
But like said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one

Cut your sentence in half, maybe more

George, Kristina hates you
You fucked her over one too many times
And 'm not here to socialize

Yeah
Well,  got a call from Pablo
He said this thing with Diego is a disaster
He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off

Hey, Arch, you think the judge will let us get a cocktail after this is all over
'll see what  can do, George
Thanks, Arch
They walk into the crowded courtroom
-  - 1990 - Packed
Nuts
Standing room only
The courtroom buzzes as George is led down the center aisle and is handed off to the bailiff
Over this we hear
Sir, please state your name
'm George Jung
Spelled ---
Thank you
Mr
Jung, do you know Diego Delgado
Yes,  do
Do you see him here in the courtroom
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table
Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado
The following sound bytes are dissolved together in montage style
(') Mr
Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr
Delgado
Shortly after  arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute  related to Diego that the crime  was in for was smuggling marijuana
Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America
(') The first run was fifteen kilos, which we smuggled into Logan Airport in hard shelled suitcases
(') We wrapped the cocaine in kitchen cabinet paper, and duct tape, that way if there were any dogs in customs
(') introduced Diego to a pilot named Jack Stevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of cocaine per week into the United States via twin-engine Cessnas
Jack would fly into North Carolina, we'd meet him there and drive it down to different distribution points
(') never met Pablo Escobar
Diego Delgado was my only connection to cocaine from Colombia
(') Diego convinced me to keep most of my money in a Panamanian bank
Diego had a close relationship with Manuel Noriega
In exchange for allowing us to keep our money there, we paid him a percentage
(') There was an 85% chance that if you snorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it was ours
Initially with my connections, we invented the marketplace
In 1977, there was no other real competition
(') The first year we made about 100 million dollars between us
It was an expensive operation
Eventually we built up to three different pilots doing multiple runs per week, connections on both coasts, everything was running smooth
We were like a corporation
(') he was very anti-government
He talked about revolution, forming his own country or island, he was looking for power as well as money
was just looking for money
(') He disliked the United States, thought it was a police state
He hoped that by flooding the country with cocaine, it would disrupt the political system and tear down the morality of the country
(') Well, yes, Derek Foreal was my connection,  met him back in 1968 when first moved to Manhattan Beach
It was Foreal's marijuana connections that kicked off our cocaine market
(') Yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos to Los Angeles
When Diego finally got Derek Foreal's name from me, it was only a matter of months before he'd cut me out
(') 'm not sure how my relationship with my daughter and ex-wife have anything to do with this trial
mean we're here to talk about Diego Delgado, aren't we
Yes, we are Mr
Jung
We come out of the montage, the defense attorney Diego Delgado, Joe Calibanos, a sleazy-Greek-like-ex-basketball weight lifter guy is now doing the questioning
(') Mr
Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct
Yes,  am
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony
No,  cam here out of my own volition
Excuse me
Something about vengance being best served cold
Really
Are you getting paid, Mr
Jung
Excuse me
Mr
Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case
'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole
Even if they cut my sentence in half 'll be seventy-three years old
That's some fucking deal don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here
have a really bad record, 'm not sure what's going to happen
So you do have an agreement with the United States Government, Mr
Jung, correct
George can't respond
Looks to Diego
Looks from the jury, the judge, George is on the spotlight and it's uncomfortable
He feels suddenly sleazy
(') thought so
No more questions
Silence
The judge tells George he can step down
Calibanos laughs quietly with associates
George is bummed
He walks by Diego
They look at each other
You shouldn't have taken the 30 million, Diego,  was out
George is lead away
The court calls Mr
Jack Stevens
Jack Stevens is lead to the stand
: - 1999 - The green of the New York State countryside drifts by as a brown Mazda moves along Highway 19
Behind the wheel is a beautiful 20 year old woman wearing dark sunglasses
She drives absently, her mind somewhere else

She moves to the  behind the desk and takes off her sunglasses

Hey, George, five more minutes, buddy
'  - The admissions officer looks up from his paperwork
Jung
Kristina grabs her papers and moves to the counter
(') Belongings in here
Kristina empties her pockets and deposits her possessions into a locker box
She is handed a key
(') Feet on the blue line
Kristina stands on a blue piece of tape and the admissions officer buzzes open the giant metal door
But Kristina doesn't move
(') Miss
He presses the buzzer again, but she just stands there
(') Miss
Something wrong
- George turns around as a  taps him on the shoulder
George
George, come on
You've got a visitor
George looks up to find Kristina being buzzed through the gate
She moves through the open area and onto the grass quickly
: Father and daughter come together at last in a long embrace
'm sorry, baby
'm so sorry
It's alright, Dad
didn't mean to
know, Dad
know
He hugs her hard
fucked up
Shhhh
love you
love you so much
You've got to know that
You've got to know
know, Dad
love you too
After everything
After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you
Kristina looks at her father, smiles, and disappears
There was no Kristina
The guard continues to tap
George
George, come on
It's getting dark
George looks up to find a prison guard
His name is , and he helps George to his feet
But  have a visitor
Not today, George
Time to go back
But  want to put her name on the list for tomorrow
My daughter
Okay, George
Because she's visiting me
We'll do that tomorrow, okay
It's lockdown time
The shadows grow long, and Gus leads George down a cement path that cuts through the grass
The huge structure of Otisville looms dark against the sky, and Gus and George take the long walk back
-   - Standing outside the fences, Kristina smokes a cigarette as she watches her father being led away
After a few moments, she turns around, walks to her car and gets in
Time to go home
And as the brown Mazda pulls out of the driveway, the taillights turn red, growing smaller and smaller, until they finally disappear
