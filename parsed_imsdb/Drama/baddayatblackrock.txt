Written by Don McGuire and Millard Kaufman Based on the story "Bad Day At Hondo" by Howard Breslin -   -   :  : abandoned, in an extreme state of dilapidation
The structure is blistered by the resolute sun, the roof is weather-warped
Dry rot and mildew wage a relentless battle against the foundation
Between the building and the tracks is a long, somewhat narrow platform, its floorboards twisted by time, termites and the elements
The match-board overhang of the building, throwing some little shade to a portion of the platform, sags and bellies
From the overhang is appended a rectangular panel on which, in flaky paint, the town is identified: One of the broken wires holding the panel is longer than the other, cocking the sign irregularly
The railroad tracks reach endlessly into the horizon
Past the town on each side stretches the ocean-like prairie, with sand dunes rising and falling monotonously, shouldering each other toward infinity
The morning sun lays over this wasteland of the American Southwest, a gigantic yellow bruise from which heat waves like bloodshot arteries spread themselves over the poisoned sky
small shack stands next to the station, separated from it by a narrow alleyway and leaning toward the larger building, as if for support
The words   are arced across its dusty vitrine
An old straight-backed chair, reinforced with twisted wire, is tilted against the north-west corner of the shack
In it is Mr
Hastings, the postal telegraph agent, a man of middle years and exorbitant mediocrity
He sits there spinelessly, fingering a wart on his receding chin and, once in a while, for variety, rubbing a knuckle under his watery nose
- The town is minute, dismal and forgotten, crouching in isolation where the single line of railroad track intersects a secondary dirt road
The twin strips of steel glisten in the fierce sunlight, fencing the dreary plain from the false fronts of the town
In b
g
is the bluff of a black stony mountain
Against this ancient mass the houses of Black Rock's single street*** (See map,
2A) are scanty in number and insignificant in architecture, a conglomerate paint-peeled modern trussed together with rusty nails and battered tin strips torn from signs
The town and the terrain surrounding it have, if nothing else, the quality of inertia and immutibility -- nothing moves, not even an insect; nothing breathes, not even the wind
Town and terrain seem to be trapped, caught and held forever in the sullen, abrasive earth
Sequence omitted from original script
- jarring in its power as it ramrods across the desert, its diesel engines pounding
Its horn "" twice, blasting the shatterable air
-   - Nothing is changed, nothing is altered
But look close and you will see a small shallow current of wind sweeping lazily across the dirt and dust of the single street
for a beat, then   appears
Between the ensuing credits a series of sharp
The composition of each shot has that hard, sun-beaten texture of American primitive painting -- pressurized in its simplicity -- best exemplified, perhaps, by the work of Grant Wood
'     - assayer and notary public, mortician to the citizens of Black Rock who have departed to a better place, and veterinarian to its lesser animals
An elderly, somewhat untidy gentleman, he sits nonchalantly on a chair outside the Bar & Grill
Idling with him are three or four other loafers, among them Sam, the middle-aged proprietor of the restaurant
Doc glances casually at his watch; no one else moves
The hot wind continues listlessly down the empty street
Sequence omitted from original script
- tall, attractive girl of twenty in dungarees and cotton shirt
She stands just outside the open barn-like door of the garage, staring, from the compulsive force of habit, at the endlessly receding tracks
The sultry wind, its gustiness slightly increased, blows through her fine dark hair
Sequence omitted from original script
- two enormous men
is tall, and there is about him a nasty, raw-boned tautness;  is more the anthropoid type -- long thick arms and a round, iron casing of a belly
They glance down the street, watching incuriously a dust devil swirling in the wind
Now the  has completed its probe of the town and its denizens
and  are completed
- still spineless in his chair, the chair still tilted against the shack
From o
s
and far away, we hear the horn of the streamliner -- two long "", a short and a long (engine whistle signal for approach to bridge crossing)
Hastings straightens up ever so slightly as he reacts to the oncoming train
- moving at tremendous speed
with train barrelling toward it
The horn  -- three short  (engine whistle signal for stopping at next station)
- getting jerkily to his feet, as though charged by a galvanic current
The uncharacteristic speed of his movements throws the tilted chair to the station platform
He raises an arm to shield his watery eyes from the sun
(almost inaudible, as if to himself) Stopping
- heading toward , churning across the desert like a juggernaut
It  past  in a blur of speed on a level with the great iron wheels as the brakes are applied
The wheels shriek agonizingly against the rails, kicking up cinders and a wild flurry of dust
She cuts speed, brakes hissing, and starts to slow down
- from rear of town, toward the railroad tracks
The townspeople step out, frowning, cautious, disturbed
The secure ritual of the train passing through, never stopping, has somehow, for some unknown reason, been violated
- as his mouth tightens
His air of placidity vanishes, leaving his features disturbed
- Her fine young face stiffens almost imperceptibly
Her eyes are coated with a vague emptiness
She seems confused as she halfturns toward the hotel
- Coley Trimble and Hector David, standing on the porch of the hotel
They seem tense, responding variously to what might be fear
Coley's nostrils flare, his flat ugly mouth compresses
He looks profoundly serious
Hector wipes a glob of dusty sweat from the socket of an eye and blinks rapidly
- as he stands in surprise, nervously alert, watching the train as it comes to a complete stop
His jaw droops with the slackness of fear
Sequence omitted from original script
with the train stationary before it
sleek steel door of a pullman clangs open
colored porter carrying a suitcase walks down the wrought-iron steps
He is stately, gray-haired and lean, with the almost finical tidiness travelers associate with trainmen
The man behind him is big-shouldered, a granite- like wedge of a man with calm, piercing eyes
There is about him an air of monumental dependability and quiet humor, but his eyes are those of a man who has lately lived in somber familiarity with pain
His left arm hangs from his shoulder with that lifeless rigidity of paralysis, while the hand is hidden in his pocket
- The porter puts the suitcase on the platform
In the distance the town and its people are seen staring silently, motionlessly
The big man glances toward them
He smiles a sad, distasteful greeting to the town, its wretched dust
its mean, modest buildings
The porter disappears into the train as the conductor enters scene
He turns slowly, following Macreedy's gaze
(softly, staring at the towns people) Man
They look woebegone and far away
(looking around) 'll only be here twenty-four hours
In a place like this, it could be a lifetime
(turning to face Macreedy) Good luck, Mr
Macreedy
Macreedy nods his thanks
The conductor signals the engineer (o
s
) and steps on the train
The diesel's claxon blasts the torrid air ominously
The train slowly, smoothly, begins to move, picking up speed
The cars slip past until, quite suddenly, the Streamliner is gone
For a moment Macreedy watches it
Then, quite unconsciously, he takes a package of cigarettes from his left hand pocket, taps the last one free of the pack, sticks it between his lips and, crumpling the empty pack, drops it beside the tracks
He takes a cardboard book of matches, flicks it open, bends a match in half with agile fingers, and with a sure frictional motion scrapes the head against the sandpaper guard
The match flares, the cigarette is lit
Macreedy inhales, exhales deeply, and turns to pick up his suitcase
Then he sees Hastings, who walks slowly, almost painfully, to him
His Adam's apple grapples protestingly with his collar
After a moment he controls it sufficiently to talk
You for Black Rock
(easily) That's right
(uneasily) There must be some mistake
'm Hastings, the telegraph agent
Nobody told me the train was stopping
(with a ghost of a grin) They didn't
(upset) just said they didn't, and they ought to
What  -- want to know, why didn't they
(shrugging) Probably didn't think it was important
Important
It's the first time the streamliner stopped here in four years
(swallowing nervously) You being met
You visiting folks or something
mean, whatd'ya want
want to go to Adobe Flat
Any cabs available
(as if he hadn't heard right; as if he wanted everyone in town to know) Adobe Flat
(he gulps, recovers slightly) No cabs
Where's the hotel
Hastings looks at him blankly
The thousand-yard stare of a hypnotic glazes his features
(patiently) asked where's the hotel
Hastings points
Thanks
With his suitcase, he cuts across a weedy path, running into Black Rock's single street
For a moment, Hastings stares after him; then he breaks hurriedly, entering telegraph agent's shack
as Hastings, fumbling, picks up the phone
(into mouthpiece) Hello, Pete
Now, listen
-   - down the street as Macreedy slowly walks toward the hotel
Not a person has moved, each eye is glued on the stranger
The hollow rasp of Macreedy's tread on the wooden platform of the "pavement" seems shatteringly loud in the enveloping silence
- as she follows the man's movement
Sequence omitted from original script
- as he walks along
He feels the eyes of everyone following him, glaring at him
He halts, looks around
The townspeople continue to eye him brazenly, yet with an almost animal incuriosity
He grins and walks on past a cluster of five or six  mail boxes and a road sign [1], its paint peeling, its face punctured by three or four bullets from a drunk's pistol long ago
- heading toward the hotel
In b
g
is a relatively small farm equipment yard compressed between a general store (which Macreedy has just passed) and the hotel just ahead
In the yard are a few tractors, and among them huddles a tiny office
It is empty; the front window is thick with dust
On it, etched by an anonymous, childish finger, is a skull and crossbones
Running diagonally across is the printed legend: Macreedy notes the inscription with a sort of wry bemusement
He walks on, reaching the facade of the weather-beaten hotel
gust of wind swirls down the street, momentarily engulfing Macreedy and the entire area in a sudden eddying whirlpool
As it subsides
- As he peers through the dust toward the dingy hotel
It has a narrow stoop and outsize bay windows on each side
Macreedy mounts the hotel steps
At the top of the steps Coley Trimble and Hector David watch him silently
Hector is large and leanly muscular, yet Coley looms over him like a battleship
He is a gross behemoth of a man, with sharp flinty eyes the size of glistening pinpoints and a slack, oversized jaw
Both men wear modern Western work clothes, but there is one incongruous accessory which Hector affects
Around his thick wrist is a watch with a large flat face and an elaborately tooled leather strap -- a cheap reproduction of one of those expensive Swiss timepieces which, among many distinguished accomplishments, tells the day of the week, the month of the year, the phase of the moon, etc
, etc
(slowing up) 'Afternoon
No reaction from Hector
(blocking doorway) Anything  can do for you
You run this hotel
No
(pleasantly) Then there's nothing you can do for me
He brushes past Coley and enters
(turning to Coley) Find Smith
Coley nods and heads down the street
Hector enters the hotel
Sequence omitted from original script
It is a typical small town hotel, but crummier, with a tiny lobby
Macreedy is waiting at the empty desk as Hector strolls in, flopping his enormous bulk into a nicked and mothy chair
He picks up a newspaper, but his eyes remain on Macreedy
Macreedy waits patiently for the absent clerk
For a moment, he studies the open registration ledger; his eyes rove from the ink-splotched blotter up over the desk to one of those World War  banners, the imitation silk now stained and faded
It depicts a shrieking eagle rampant, clutching The Flag in a claw
Under it, the legend: "  " Near it, a tacky placard proclaims: , , , , , Feeling the eyes of Hector on him, Macreedy turns
Hector meets his gaze with bland, insolent interest
Now a young man (his name is ) comes out of a small room behind the registration desk and walks up to it
There is a softness about his regular features, a certain indefinable sugariness about his mouth
He seems tight-lipped, for lorn and uneasy as he faces Macreedy across the counter
(pleasantly) 'd like a room
All filled up
(a beat) Got any idea where  might -- (stiffly, shaking his head) This is 1945, mister
There's been a war on
Macreedy looks at the young man with impeccable tolerance
Without shifting his gaze, he slowly lets fall his small suitcase
It thuds softly on the frayed carpet
thought it ended a couple of months ago
Yeah, but the
lingers on
Macreedy looks down at the open ledger on the desk before him
The clerk reaches out to close it
Gently, yet firmly, Macreedy stops him, reopening the big book
He studies it, a finger straying unconsciously inside his collar
He [
] on it to relieve the starchy stiffness
Pete begins to fidget
You don't know about the
(without looking up) Tell me
Well, for establishments with less'n fifty rooms hotel keepers got to report regularly about
His voice fades desperately
about tenants and
and
registration
(drawing himself up) There are penalties imposed
Again his voice trails off
(eyes still on the ledger) You seem to have lots of vacancies
(uncomfortable) Well
as  said
Macreedy leans over the counter to a rack of keys
He runs his splayed fingers over the key rack as
Lots of vacancies
They're everyone of 'em locked up
Some are show rooms
Yes
(with touching sincerity) for cattle buyers, feed salesmen
The others -- they're spoken for, rented to cowboys, ranch hands
(Macreedy listens respectfully) They pay by the month
For when they come into town
We provide for their every wish and comfort
(weakly) You understand
Not really
But while 'm pondering it, get a room ready
Just for tonight
(picking key from rack at random) This one
Pete opens his mouth but no sound comes out
[
] at Hector
- glowering at Pete
- as Macreedy signs the ledger
(signing) Sure could use a bath
Where is it
He picks up the key
Head of the stairs
Macreedy nods, reaches for the bag at his feet
Then he hesitates, looks at Hector
don't know just why you're interested -- but the name's Macreedy
'm
(grins) It's all in the ledger
(slowly, his eyes glued to Macreedy's stiff arm) You look like you need a hand
Macreedy says nothing
The wales along his face harden
He picks up his bag and climbs the stairs
As he disappears, Hector lumbers to the desk and grabs the ledger
(reading aloud) John
Macreedy
From Los Angeles
(looking up) wanna know everything he does, Pete
Check every call -- any mail
(nodding) And in the meantime
(grinning harshly) In the meantime, 'll crowd him a little
(looking up the stairs) see if he's got any iron in his blood
As Pete bites his lower lip thoughtfully, : Sequence omitted from original script
-  - in a new bathrobe, before a cracked, discolored mirror
He draws a safety razor down his face, completing his shave; then he wipes a hand over the mirror, which clouds with steam almost as fast as he can clear it
o
s
, the  of bath water gurgling down the tub drain
He runs a tentative finger inside the collar of his robe, pulling loose a price tag
He drops it carefully into a wastebasket
He turns on the faucet at the sink to rinse his shaving brush
The rusty pipes cough and rumble, roaring as a trickle of water arrives while the drain sucks loudly at its departure
He dries the razor, turns off the faucet and exits
- As he walks down the dark, narrow hall
He wears the bathrobe and slippers; a large towel is draped over his head, like a prize fighter
He stops outside a door, pushes the towel from his head to his neck and puts his hand on the knob
He is about to insert the key when he tenses
Slowly, silently, he turns the knob and throws open the door
Next to the door, in the corner of the small, sparsely furnished room is Macreedy's suitcase, open, its contents askew and scattered over the dusty floor
On the bed sprawls Hector David, his gigantic body straining the springs
He lies on his back, hands clasped easily under his head, thick legs crossed, his Stetson tilted over his low forehead
He is completely unconcerned by Macreedy's entrance
For a moment Macreedy stares at him
Then
(slightly amused) think you have the wrong room
(not budging) You think so
Slowly, his eyes still on Macreedy, Hector takes off his elaborate wrist watch and slides it gently into his pants pocket
What else you got on your mind
Macreedy pauses and takes in the situation
He refuses to be baited
Nothing,  guess
If you had a mind, boy, you'd of heard what Pete downstairs said
He said these here rooms are for us cowboys
For our every wish and comfort
And this,  guess, is yours
When 'm in town
And 'm in town, as any fool can see
You see that, don't you, boy
guess  do
Would you mind very much if  sort of
(he gestures toward his suitcase and clothing) clean up this mess and get another room
Not at all
But if you want this room real bad
(he raises his enormous bulk to a sitting position, rubbing the knuckles of one big fist with the palm of his other hand) we could maybe settle your claim without all this talk
(no answer from Macreedy) If a man don't claim what's rightfully his'n, he's nuthin'
What do you think
guess so
You guess so
But still you ain't claimin' this room
guess not
You're all the time guessin', boy
Don't you ever know anything
One thing  know
Since  got off the train, 've been needled
Why
(after a beat, slowly) guess  don't rightly know
For a moment their eyes lock
Then Macreedy goes to his suitcase and throws his clothes in it
As he goes out the door
: Sequence omitted from original script
-  -   - They sit around, each with his own thoughts
They are generally stolid; only Sam seems nervous
He looks up eagerly as Doc Velie enters the lobby
As he joins Sam
Sam walks light for a big man, Doc
(straight) Who
(irritated) You know who
(Doc grins impishly; Sam's anger subsides) What do you think, Doc
Why ask me
He's no salesman, that's sure
(again the impish grin) Unless he's peddling dynamite
(squirming visibly) Maybe he's a cop, or something
Ever see a cop with a stiff arm
(squinting thoughtfully) Maybe his arm's all right
Maybe he's just holding tight to something in his pocket
(scoffing) Like what
pistol
stick of -- (gleefully) To blow up this whole mangy, miserable town
(with sudden, almost naive, seriousness) Why are you so interested, Sam
Who, me
mean, if  was that interested
(his eyes look up toward the hotel stairs o
s
) 'd ask him
Sam follows Doc's gaze
-    35X1 Macreedy walks down the stairs
Pete looks up from the desk
He is about to dart behind the partition when
Hey
Hold it
He walks to the desk, smiling at Pete
In b
g
, Doc, Sam and the loafers watch
Got any cigarettes
Pete studies him, then bends under the counter, coming up with a pack
Doc leaves Sam and is slowly walking toward the stranger, eyeing him curiously
This is all
Macreedy throws the money on the desk and opens the pack, dexterously using the fingers of his left hand
How long you staying
In my new room, you mean
(flatly) 'm staying
mean, in the hotel
Just about twenty-four hours
(sharply) Why
(flustered) was just askin'
(evenly) Why
You expecting a convention
(doggedly) was just askin'
Macreedy looks at him, inhales deeply on his cigarette then, as he slowly lets the smoke out, removes the cigarette and looks at it
Stale
Now Doc is at the desk not far from Macreedy
Macreedy starts out, then turns to Pete
Where can  rent a car
don't know
Macreedy smiles and sighs tiredly
Then
(as to a child) Let's put it this way -- if  had a car and if  wanted to put gas in it, where would  go
(refusing to cooperate) But you don't have a car
(to Macreedy) You might try the garage at the end of the street
Macreedy pauses, looking at Doc, who blandly returns his stare
Thanks
Doc nods
Macreedy smiles and walks toward the door; Pete, Doc et al watching him
He goes out
As Macreedy walks down hotel steps, a station wagon pulls up just before him
Tied with a rope to the right front fender is a magnificent eight-point buck
stain of dry blood weaves an uneven course down his glossy flank from an unmistakable bullet hole in his shoulder
Two men get out of the car; one of them is Coley Trimble
He sees Macreedy coming toward him
He stands motionless in the center of the narrow pavement, picking at his nose with the detachment of a child
The other man is broad and excessively masculine as he swings out from behind the wheel
He walks around the car, joining Coley at the curb
Macreedy comes on
The man with Coley looks at the stranger with colossal indifference, as expressionless as the soil of Black Rock
His handsome face, under a dusty hunting cap, is taut and hard and wind-shaven
Next to Coley he stands motionless, except for the wisp of smoke from a black Cuban cigarette between his thin lips
In b
g
, the loafers who had been ensconced in the hotel lobby move out the door and stand on the porch
They watch Macreedy, Coley and Reno Smith, the handsome, taut-faced man
Silence soems to settle over everything
It is Macreedy who breaks it
(grinning wearily at Coley) Here we go again
Gently he walks around Coley and Reno Smith and continues down the street
Coley's eyes follow him
Smith goes up the steps of the hotel and enters the lobby
Coley quickly follows him
The loafers on the porch go back inside
The loafers resume their familiar places as Smith walks briskly to the clerk's desk
Pete, in anticipation, opens the hotel register, places it before Smith (deferentially, gesturing toward the open register) That's all  know about him, Mr
Smith
Smith doesn't answer; he looks up thoughtfully
His eyes harden almost imperceptibly as he sees Coley, across the narrow room, looking out the window after Macreedy
(to Coley's back) Sit down
(spinning to face him) was only
(interrupting) Sit down
Coley sits in the nearest chair
Beyond Smith, still resting easily against the high counter of Pete's desk, the gigantic figure of Hector appears at the top of the stairs
He comes down and joins Smith
(after a pause) Pretty cool guy
Doesn't push easy
(frowning) That's it -- that's just it
He pushes too easy
Maybe we oughtta
He hesitates as Doc Velie sidles amiably into earshot
What do you want, Doc
Nothing
(archly) was just wondering what all you people were worrying about
(Smith looks at him coldly) Not that  have the slightest idea
You wonder too much, and you talk too much
(pauses) It's a bad parlay, Doc
hold no truck with silence
(impishly) got nothing to hide
(suddenly towering over Doc) What're you tryin' to say
Nothing, man
It's just, you worry about the stranger only if you look at him
(slowly) from a certain aspect
How do you look at him, Doc
(firmly) With the innocence of a fresh-laid egg
(after a pause) Keep it up, Doc
Be funny
Make bad jokes
(he starts to walk toward the window, Doc and Hector following him) And some day 'll have Coley wash out your mouth with lye
Smith looks thoughtfully out the window
- Macreedy, down the end of the block, saunters easily up to Liz's garage
'  - The garage, without a door, opens on the street
Against the front of the building is parked a battered bicycle
On one of the barnlike walls a boy of nine is drawing laboriously with a piece of chalk
He puts the last flourish to a skull and crossbones identical with that seen earlier on the window of the equipment yard office
Macreedy stops a few feet from him, waiting until the boy prints "
"
As he steps back to admire his handiwork
Hi,
nods
He approaches the wall, raising his chalk
This your garage
Nope
(a beat) Where's the man it belongs to
Ain't a man
He pauses
As Macreedy opens his mouth to interrogate further
Lady runs this garage
Again a pause
has just completed the final letter of the word ""
And again as Macreedy opens his mouth
She's not here
Where'd she go
(shrugging) dunno
Somewhere
When will she be back
dunno
Sometime
Again the pause
steps back, having completed his work, which, of course, broadcasts the fact that "
"
And again as Macreedy begins to speak
In about ten minutes
(with a grin) Thanks
turns, pulls the bike away from the building, completes a fastidious "pony express" and peddles furiously out of scene
- as Macreedy, after a moment's hesitation, starts down it
From the far end, at the telegraph agent's shack, a figure starts running toward Macreedy
It is Hastings between the two men
Hastings, in his concentration, doesn't see the stranger until he is almost upon him
He slows down, suddenly, awkwardly, to a self-conscious walk
Macreedy grins at him, passes on, shaking his head speculatively
Hastings, with a parting glance, gallops up the hotel steps
- Smith, Coley, Hector, Pete, Doc, Sam et al are still in evidence
Smith is in a tight little group at the desk with Coley, Hector and Pete
Doc has taken a position at the window, looking out
Hastings bursts in and half-runs to Smith
as the excited telegraph agent speaks
called the Circle
He ain't got business there -- not if they don't know him
Right, Mr
Smith
Smith ignores him, thinking
Hastings breathes heavily
Finally
(to Hastings) Send a wire to Nick Gandi in Los Angeles
Tell him to find out all he can about John
Macreedy
Tell him want to know fast
Sign my name
Hastings nods, scribbling on a pad
What was that
Nick Gandi
----
Care of the Blake Hotel
Hastings nods and hurriedly exits
(after a beat) Who's Gandi
Smith looks at Coley, trying to decide if the question in any way challenges his authority
He concludes not
He's a private detective
(beat) drive to
now and then
(slightly worried) He'll get us the dope
He'll get us anything, for twenty bucks a day and expenses
(Hector frowns) Hector, you worry too fast and too easy
It's just,  don't like it
Maybe he's just passing through
Don't bet on it
He can only mean trouble
(smiles faintly) Hector, you're jumpy as a stall horse
(doggedly) We oughtta see him
talk to him
(quietly) About what
(Hector doesn't answer) What'll we talk to him about
The birds, the bees
The weather
The crops
(pauses) You tried -- where'd it get you
(uncomfortably) only thought
Sure
You only thought
(after a beat) What do we do
What do you do
You wait
Like Pete here
Right, Pete
Pete nods, his brow furrowed uncomfortably in a frown
That's all you do
But while you wait
talk to him
At this point the brittle silence is cracked by
(o
s
) Hey
Smith and those around him look off in the direction of Doc
- peering out
He turns in the direction of Smith and the others
Now what do you know
(beaming) Mr
Macreedy seems to be heading for the jail
(impishly) Now what do you suppose he'd want to see the Sheriff about
Smith goes to the window, edging Doc to one side with a shoulder
He looks out grimly
- Macreedy, down the street, cuts up the steps of the jail
Smith staring out the window with a frown
Doc watching him out of the corner of his eye, a bemused expression crossing his puckish features
Sequence omitted from original script
on Macreedy as he enters the jail
It is small and dirty, with only a tired desk, two chairs and the usual police posters on the wall
One side leads to the cell block and Macreedy heads for it
from interior of cell block comprising two cells, both of which are open
man is asleep in the lower bunk of the front cell
The keys are in the lock
Macreedy shakes his head and starts to close the creaking cell door
Sheriff , the man in the bunk, lifts his head, blinking his bleary eyes
He is in terrible shape
Hold it, friend
He manages to crawl off the bunk and out toward Macreedy
(grinning) ain't hankerin' to get locked in my own jail
Sorry
thought you were a guest
As it happens, 'm the host
He walks out of the cell, Macreedy following him into the office
- Tim breaks out a bottle of booze, starts to take a snort, then stops, offers it to Macreedy
Snort
No, thanks
Don't blame you
It's awful
He takes a belt that would incapacitate half the county
He finishes, smacks his lips, lays the bottle down, and falls into a chair
He looks up at Macreedy
(suddenly mean) What're you lookin' at
(easy) You tell me
(after a beat, relaxing) ain't always this bad -- just that last night me and my pal Doc Velie, we did a little celebratin'
At least did
What were you celebrating
(shrugs) You name it
(studies Macreedy) What do you want
My name's Macreedy
came in on the Streamliner
Tim studies him, trying to focus
You what
said  came in
(interrupting) You ain't from around here
Up Tucson way -- Phoenix
Mesa
You ain't sellin' cattle nor seed nor nothin' like that
No
(sighs, then distinctly as to a child) All  want from you is a little information
've got to get to a place called Adobe Flat
(reacts; then, tight- lipped) This ain't no information bureau
Macreedy starts to say something, then stops
Reconsidering
One thing about Black Rock -- everybody's polite
Makes for gracious living
Nobody asked you here
How do you know
(he moves toward the door, with a rueful grin) (starting after him) What about Adobe Flat
'm looking for a man named Komako
The Sheriff reaches for his bottle
In his haste he drops it
Macreedy's hand moves quickly, catching the bottle before it hits the floor
Almost a disaster
(sinking back in his chair) fate worse'n death
(he takes the bottle from Macreedy) You move fast for a crip
for a big man
For a moment heavy silence
Finally
What about Komako
(slowly) If there's no further questions
Macreedy grins harshly and exits
Tim watches him go, then slowly reaches for the bottle
He pauses, looks at his shaking hand
Then he withdraws it and just sits in the chair staring blindly ahead, seeing nothing
Frowning, deep in thought, Macreedy walks down the dusty street
As he reaches the hotel
(o
s
) Mr
Macreedy
Macreedy stops, looks toward Smith as he walks out to meet him
That's the friendliest word 've heard since  got here
As Smith joins him, he walks on
Smith falls in step beside him
(grins boyishly) My name is Smith
own the Triple- Bar ranch
(holds out his hand; Macreedy shakes it) want to apologize for some of the folks in town
They act like they're sitting on a keg
keg
Of what
don't know
Maybe diamonds
Maybe gunpowder
(disarmingly) No
Nothing like that
We're a little suspicious of strangers is all
Hangover from the old days
The old West
thought the tradition of the old West was hospitality
(with a sincere smile) 'm trying to be hospitable, Mr
Macreedy
(boyishly pushes his dusty cap back on his head) Going to be around for a while
Could be
How would you like to go hunting tomorrow
'd be proud to have you as my guest
Thanks, but 'm afraid not
(with admirable candor) You mean, because of your arm
(slaps Macreedy's shoulder in a friendly, understanding gesture) knew a man once, lost an arm in a threshing accident
Used to hunt all the time
(almost too blandly) But he was quite a man
He
(pauses; then, with discreet and charming gravity) 'm sorry
What  mean is -- if there's anything  can do while you're around
'm looking for
(sighs) Never mind
Thanks, anyway
(quietly) You're looking for what, Mr
Macreedy
(eyeing him) man named Komako
(no hesitation) Komako -- Sure,  remember him -- Japanese farmer
Never had a chance
No
He got here in '41 -- just before Pearl Harbor
Three months later he was shipped to one of those relocation centers
(shaking his head) Tough
Which one did he go to
Who knows
You think maybe if  wrote him, the letter would be forwarded
'm sure it would
Write your letter
'll see it gets out tonight
It wouldn't be too much trouble
No trouble at all
Funny
Because  think it would be a great deal of trouble for you
It's been a great deal of trouble for me
At this point they are in front of
' Macreedy stops, as does Smith
He looks keenly at Smith as he takes from his inner jacket pocket a half-dozen letters
wrote these letters to Komako
They weren't forwarded
They were returned -- address unknown
(he smiles grimly at Smith) So  guess there's nothing you can do for me, after all
Smith opens his mouth to reply when the  of a jeep o
s
interrupts him
The jeep comes
Liz Brooks, at the wheel, cuts the engine and jumps out
Smith ambles silently to a wall and leans against it
Liz reaches behind the driver's seat and hoists, with both hands and some effort, a five-gallon drum of axle grease from the floor of the jeep
As she rests it on the rear fender
(going to her) Need a little help
The girl looks at Smith, who has made no attempt to help her
can manage
She lifts the drum to the ground
Well,  need a little help
(she looks at him questioningly) 'd like to rent your jeep
It'll be two dollars an hour, gas extra, and ten dollars for my time
(to Liz) Aren't you going to ask him where he wants to go
Liz looks from Smith to Macreedy, puzzled
He wants to go to Adobe Flat
Liz hesitates
Macreedy notes her confusion as her eyes seek Smith's for instructions
Quickly he moves in
The road's marked
(nodding) Yeah
It's about six -- seven miles down
Then  won't need your time
Macreedy hands her a bill
She fumbles with it, not knowing what else to do
Her eyes drift to Macreedy's stiff arm
(uneasily) thought you might
need a little help
can manage
He steps toward the jeep as
Liz
Do you have a license to rent cars
You could get into trouble
It's all right
won't mention it to the Sheriff
He steps into jeep and, with one hand expertly manipulating the controls, drives off
- Smith turns his attention to the girl
(slowly) You shouldn't have done that
thought it would be better if he went out there and got done with it
(Smith looks at her sharply) mean, what could he find out
For a moment Smith doesn't answer
Instead, with a half frown, he lifts the bill Macreedy had given her from Liz's hand
(as he studies it) This is liable to be the hardest ten dollars you ever earned in your life
He crumples it, pokes the wad in her hand and walks off down the street as

-   - Tim sits in his chair, still staring sightlessly at the whiskey bottle
Smith enters
He looks from Tim to the bottle on the table, then back to Tim
(after a beat, disinterestedly) What did he want -- the stranger
(abstractedly) He asked about Komako
(looking up at Smith) You think he'll kick up a storm
(easily) storm
About what
don't know
All  know,  don't want trouble around here
(pauses awkwardly, then) Never again
Trouble
You don't know anything about Komako, now do you, Tim
do not
That's the point
The point is, what you don't know can't hurt you
Maybe there's something  ought to know
Maybe  ought to ask you
before the stranger comes back and starts breathing down my neck
(a faint smile) Tim, you're a lost ball in the high weeds
told you a long time ago, nothing happened for you to worry about
(stands up, facing Smith) Thing is,  do worry
Maybe  ain't much else, but 'm sure a worrier
(beat, then with soft emphasis) And 'm still the law
Then do your job, Tim
What is my job, Mr
Smith
Maybe 'd better find out before Macreedy does it for me
(evenly) Macreedy'll do nothing, Tim
And neither will you
Suppose  decide to try
That would be dangerous
You got the body of a hippo, Tim, but the brain of a rabbit
Don't overtax it
He stares harshly at the Sheriff
Tim tries unsuccessfully to meet his gaze
Then, slowly, he sits down
(lowering his eyes, mumbling) Yes, Mr
Smith
Smith slowly walks behind Tim's chair and silently, patronizingly pats the Sheriff's slack shoulder
'  - Hastings is sitting at his desk
The telegraph ticker starts to splutter
Hastings rushes to it
He listens, and starts to scribble
Then he gulps nervously, a confused expression on his face
As the telegraph key stops as suddenly as it had begun, Hastings jumps up frantically and, holding the sheet of paper, runs out of the shack
as he runs toward hotel
- with Doc, Sam, Coley, Hector and Pete on the porch
Hastings runs up the steps, pausing momentarily
His jaws move, but is too far away to pick up his obvious question
Coley gestures toward the jail; then Hastings turns and runs down the steps followed by Doc et al
- Hastings runs down the street toward the jail followed by Doc et al
as Hastings runs up the steps with a hobnailed clatter
Smith comes out to investigate, followed by Tim
Doc, et al are congregated at the foot of the steps
Hastings slaps the sheet of paper in front of Smith
Utter quiet
Everyone stares at Smith, waiting for a reaction -- everyone except Tim, who stares straight ahead, seeing nothing, and Doc, whose eyes are locked sympathetically on Tim
Smith finishes reading the wire
His face is expressionless
After a moment
(to Smith) From
Smith doesn't answer but
Yeah
From that private detective
(to Smith) What does he say
Who is this guy
Never heard of him, that's what he says
He checked and there's no John Macreedy
No listing -- no record -- no information
Nothing
(quietly, after a beat, to Smith) Where does that leave us
'll tell you where
Shut up
He folds the message carefully, puts it in his pocket
Abruptly Tim turns and disappears inside his office
Smith, with some restraint, walks down the steps to the street
- as he takes Coley's arm, and Pete's
The trio moves away, taking a position perhaps 15 feet from Doc
Hector, Sam and Hastings move toward them
Sequence omitted from original script
- , In b
g
at a respectful distance are Hector, Sam and Hastings
parallel to tracks, which disappear far into the horizon
The following dialogue is delivered in an undertone
(turning to Coley) Now, Coley
(takes a breath, then) think Macreedy's a nothing nobody
Is he
So there's nothing to worry about
Isn't there
(a beat) You got brains, you have
(squirming) But what can he find out
That Komako was
(Smith glares at him) Suppose he finds out
nobody like Macreedy can raise a pretty big stink
The point is
who would miss a nobody like Macreedy if he just, say, disappeared
Who, Coley
Coley is terribly preoccupied, balances himself, like a child, on a steel rail
(exasperated) Coley
(galvanized from the rail) Huh
Why don't we wait
Wait for what
mean, maybe he won't find anything
Maybe he'll just go away
Not Macreedy
know those maimed guys
Their minds get twisted
They put on hair shirts and act like martyrs
They're all of 'em do- gooders, trouble makers, freaks
But there's no danger yet
Let's wait and see
(interrupting, appealing to Coley as an equal) No danger, he says
This guy's like a carrier of small pox
Since he arrives, there's been a fever in this town, an infection
And it's spreading
(he glances from Coley to Pete) Hastings has been in a sick sweat, running around, shooting off his face
Doc, for the first time in four years, gets snotty with me
Liz
(to Pete) your own sister -- acts like a fool
(hotly) She's just a kid
(scoffing) Kid
She must have strained every muscle in her head to get so stupid
Renting him a jeep
And Tim -- Tim, the rum-dum
Tim suddenly decides he's gotta act like a Sheriff
(to Coley, gesturing at Pete) And he says what's the danger
Brittle silence for a moment
Then
(easily) Of course, if you want to take the chance
Pete doesn't answer
(grimly) Not me
All right, then
It's not all right
You're so mighty quick to kill -- he's not an animal
(to Coley, with mock surprise) Well, listen to little spitfire
(turning slowly on Pete) You sniveling toad
'm saving your neck
If  don't, who will
(squirming) All  said
Who will
Doc
Tim
Your sister, with the rocks in her head
Pete is silent
One thing about your sister -- she's got twice the guts you have
You're only fit for running away
It's too late for that
(belligerently, slowly, at Pete) He's in this, and he ain't running no place
There is a long, electric silence
Pete is defeated
(finally) All right, then
He pauses for emphasis
Then, as he starts to talk again
Tim stands facing the wall, shoulders hunched, suffering
Doc comes in and watches him silently, Tim turns, facing Doc, turns again to concentrate on a faded newspaper photograph framed and hanging on the wall
- over his shoulder
Focal point: the "photograph"
It shows a widly grinning, moderately alert and healthy Tim of perhaps five years ago
He is wearing, proudly, his badge of office, and behind him, mildly interested in the proceedings, is Reno Smith, his erstwhile sponsor
The heading on the photo reads:
- Tim takes the photo off the wall and, holding it, turns to face Doc
Let Smith find himself a new boy can't take it another day
(pauses, looks at Doc) If you're a sheriff, they gotta respect you, otherwise you can't do your job
(shakes his head) They just laugh
don't laugh, Tim
Why don't you
Cut it out, Tim
You should
In the name of well-adjusted manhood, snap out of it
You're going to get a complex or something
Four years ago if 'd of done my job
if 'd of checked up and found out what happened
But  didn't
Just like Smith figured
What could you have found out
They told you a story
You had to believe it
Do you believe it
Doc squirms but doesn't answer
Do you know what happened
don't know
(ironically) lead a quiet, contemplative life
Me,  didn't even try to find out
(a beat) Don't you understand
(he taps the badge on his chest) When you wear that badge, you're the Law
And when something happens, against the Law, you're supposed to do something about it
It's your job
(simply) Me
did nothin'
And that's what's eatin' me
What kind of prescription you got for that
don't know
've never been able to find one for myself
Tim takes off his badge and throws it on the desk
Only one thing -- don't quit, Tim
Why not
Maybe this feller Macreedy has the prescription
They look at each other
Slowly Tim picks up his badge and pins it back on
Sequence omitted from original script
An old marker, jutting on an angle at the side of the road, reads:
Beneath it an arrow points ahead
Macreedy steers the jeep up the narrow, rutted trail between a serious of enormous boulders
as he drives to the far end of the boulders, reaching a flat piece of land completely surrounded by rocks
Beyond the rocks is what remains of a burned-out ranch house, and an abandoned well
Sequence omitted from original script
- in the wreckage
The remains of an iron bed
The burned-out shell of a pick-up truck
Part of a stove
morass of bottles, all sizes and shapes, some of them broken
Macreedy halts momentarily beside the well
Reaching out he touches the warped sun-beaten boards that cover the mouth
He removes one, and, picking up a pebble, drops it through the opening
There is a long beat and then, from far, far below we  a faint  (o
s
)
He replaces the board and walks to a broken wall
He touches the burned out frame of a picture
The frame falls to the ground, leaving an un-scorched square on the surface of the wall
He goes past a solitary standing stone chimney
Suddenly he halts, arrested by something among the rubble, the rottenness and the ashes
- Surrounded by the seared and blackened earth is a rectangular patch of lovely wild flowers
studying the brightly colored flowers
His face is lined in thought
He stoops, gathers a few buds in his hand
He examines them, his brow furrowed
As he slowly twirls a flower between thumb and forefinger,   from Macreedy in a long slow arc, taking in miles and miles of barren wasteland
,   to a cliff far away and shielded from Macreedy's view by the intervening rocks and ridges
- and on it the outline of an automobile
- empty
It is parked on a narrow dirt road
On one side of the road the cliff falls abruptly to the valley far below; on the other, the steep, shaly outcropping continues to rise
For a moment   on the car
Then it upward about fifty feet,  this time on
where a man is looking off toward Adobe Flat through a pair of high-powered glasses
The man is Coley Trimble
- Grimly he walks toward the jeep, still holding the wild flowers
Now he pockets them, jumps into the vehicle and drives off
- continues to train his glasses on Macreedy far below in the moving jeep
- driving steadily over rough, rocky terrain
climbs down from the pinnacle of the cliff and enters a big, powerful '36 Packard sedan
shifts to low gear as the jeep presses into hilly country
- turns on the ignition
- as it winds along a road with the cliff rising on one side and falling off steeply on the other
He rounds a curve, passes an insignificant side road, drives on
The car with Coley at the wheel pulls out, follows Macreedy
between the two cars, with the distance between them constantly diminishing
Sequence omitted from original script
- a straightaway, cutting through rocky outcroppings on both sides
Macreedy's jeep roars by, pursued by the gaining Packard
-    - () For the first time he is aware that he is being followed, and that the man at the wheel of the big Packard is Coley
- picking up tremendous speed
- proceeding over a series of turns, inclines, declivities (according to location terrain)
Engines roar, brakes whinny, tires scream, skidding on the turns
- as Coley overtakes Macreedy
He steers the big car within a foot or two of the jeep
The terrain has steepened; on the right there is nothing between the road and the valley floor far below but a few inches of soft shoulder
As Macreedy pulls wide on a razor turn, Coley tries to come inside him
Macreedy, fighting for control of the veering jeep, succeeds in cutting him off
In the approach, Coley cuts sharp into the jeep
The jeep seems to roll with the blow, then leaps ahead, maneuvering the turn
() Coley is flustered, his face blood-shot with fury
He seems to generate an atmosphere of vicious, cruel craziness; the wild smile across his mouth is almost sensual, obscene
He floorboards the Packard
Like some monstrous battering ram, the heavy car smashes into the jeep's rear bumper, kicking the smaller vehicle jerkily ahead
Coley floorboards the gas pedal, again
Each time he slams into the jeep with sickening force, with the brutal abrasion of metal pounding metal
-  - () With one arm he works frantically to keep his under-sized car on the twisty road
He sees ahead a precipitous cliff falling off on an impossibly sharp curve
He makes a decision
Just ahead the gradient is comparatively gradual, however steep by normal standards
He swings the jeep off the road, onto the declivity
The car plunges downward, miraculously upright
Macreedy jockeys it to a whirring, shuddering halt in the soft sand at the bottom of a draw
Macreedy turns slightly and looks up the mountain-side with the road at its summit
:    - standing at the edge of the road, peering down at him
In b
g
, the Packard
Coley turns emphatically, gets into car, drives off
His face is caked with the sweat of his exertions and dust kicked up by the grinding wheels
He exhales heavily and runs a shaky hand across the side of his head
He becomes aware suddenly of a , a trickling, an unmistakable tinkle as of running water
He frowns, opens the jeep door
- as Macreedy unlatches the hood and throws it open
The continues
Macreedy examines the engine and finds the difficulty
- focal point: the nut joining the gas line with the carburetor has worked loose in the jouncing the car has taken
With his hand Macreedy screws it tight
- as Macreedy lowers the hood, re-enters jeep
He turns on ignition
The engine fires
As he drives slowly out of the ravine
: -     - his long face even more horsey than usual, with half an apple in his mouth
He stands in front of the grocery store, with the baskets of fruit on the sidewalk
He looks up, stops crunching
- at the window of the Bar & Grill, cleaning an ear with a toothpick
He looks out
The toothpick is motionless
- fidgeting outside his shack
He looks up
His Adam's apple turns completely over
Sequence omitted from original script
- Macreedy slowly driving the jeep toward Liz's garage
He looks neither to the right nor left
- Standing on the porch of the hotel, watching
Smith's face compresses, and his eyes swivel to rest on Coley's with cold, contemptuous anger
Coley licks his lips uneasily
Smith turns and enters the hotel
Coley meekly follows
- He brakes the jeep before the garage
No one is there
He parks the vehicle, gets out and heads down the street
Macreedy is about to go up the steps when he sees Coley's car at the curb
Both right fenders are creased
An ugly, jagged break has split the front bumper almost in half, one part angling crazily toward the sky, the other drooping in the dust of the road
Smith and Coley come out of the hotel
They stand on the porch, watching Macreedy as he in turn watches the car
They exchange a glance
Smith nods, so
Well, if it's not Macreedy - the world's champion road hog
He walks down the steps to the street, joining Macreedy
Smith remains on the porch
Yeah
It's a small world
But such an unfriendly one
Now why did you want to crowd me off the road
(with a slow grin) 'm kind of sorry if 've incurred your displeasure
Look what you did to my car
If there's anything  can do to make up for it
You ought to be careful, man -- all that one-arm driving
'd be glad to pay the damages
It's a threat to life and limb
Fortunately no one was hurt
You could get yourself killed that way -- nosin' all over the countryside
That's the real danger,  can see that
Why that's pretty smart of you
How long you intend to keep it up
'm getting out of here, right now
He walks up the steps, past Smith, and into the hotel
Coley glances up at Smith, grinning with self-satisfaction, like a small boy who has carried out perfectly the instructions of his teacher
The lobby empty except for Pete behind the desk
Macreedy goes to him
Pete seems elaborately occupied arranging and re-arranging a few file cards
Smith enters the lobby
He stands in b
g
watching Macreedy and the desk clerk
(to Pete) Still expecting that convention
(looking up) What
If you're expecting any extra cowboys, my room is available
You're checking out
(nodding) Is there a train through here tonight
Nothing till tomorrow morning
The streamliner
know that
How about freights
(Pete shakes his head) Milk train
Tomorrow
After the streamliner
Busses
Closest stop is Sand City -- thirty- two miles away
(a beat) You're in such a hurry, you should have never got off here
'm inclined to agree with you
He turns, walks toward porch
Pete looks at Smith
Smith's eyes follow Macreedy
Sequence omitted from original script
'  - In the gloom of the lube pit, Liz's mechanic, a dirty old man, is draining the oil out of the crankcase of the car on the rack
The girl stands beside the pit, silently watching the old man
Now she pauses, looks o
s
toward the open garage doors
- entering the scene, stopping to look at Liz's jeep parked in front of the wide doors
He turns his eyes vaguely in the direction of Liz, but he doesn't see her in the shadows behind the car on the rack, He advances a step, pausing
Anybody home
Sequence omitted from original script
- She does not answer
Instead, she silently twists the crankcase petcock, stopping the flow of oil
She watches Macreedy closely
Macreedy again shifts his eyes to the jeep, then, with decision, he goes to a work bench, opening the drawers and rummaging among the contents
(o
s
) If you're looking for the jeep key
Macreedy turns as Liz comes toward him
She gestures toward the open drawers
it's not there
Macreedy waits for her to go on
She doesn't
She stands there, staring at him
(after a beat) In that case, where do you suggest look
She turns, walks back toward the lube pit
(over her shoulders) The jeep's not for rent
It was, just a few hours ago
(flatly) Things change
(with grim amusement) Sure
And Smith is the kid who changes 'em
She doesn't answer
Macreedy goes to her
Miss Brooks
(softly) What's the matter with this town of yours
Nothing
It's none of your concern
Then why are they all so concerned about me
Am  concerned
No, you're not
But
But what
(easily) But it strikes me you're a little too unconcerned
So unconcerned you won't even rent me a jeep
(flaring) don't run a taxi service
don't have a license
wish others in this town were as scrupulously devoted to law and order as you are
(hotly) Why don't you lay off
If you don't like it here, go back where you came from
Funny thing
They try to kill me, and you feel persecuted
don't want to get involved
Involved in what
(retreating) Whatever you're up to
Whatever happens, 've got to go on living here
These people are my neighbors, my friends
All of them
(slowly) This is my town, Mr
Macreedy, like it or not
Whatever happened here, it was long ago, now it's
it's
(evenly) Dead and buried
(a beat) Whatever did happen, you don't seem to like it
Why do you stick around
(after a beat) Because of my brother
Pete
He'd never leave
Didn't you ever think of going without him
You're sort of independent and he's
he's
Weak
know
That's why  couldn't leave him
(softly) What did your brother do
He
(flaring again) What do you care
What do you care about Black Rock
Nothing much
Only, there're not many places like this in America -- but even one is too many
Because think something sort of bad happened here
(frowning) Something  can't find the handle to
You just think so
You don't know
This much  know -- the rule of law has been suspended in this town
The gorillas have taken over
You're a fine one to talk
You come in here, sneaking around, trying to steal the key to my jeep
kind of had a notion that was the only way  could get it
She opens her mouth to answer, but she doesn't know what to say
(simply) Was  wrong, Miss Brooks
He waits as she tries to answer, and again she can't
For a moment he watches her struggle in anguished silence with herself
Then he turns and goes out
- walks thoughtfully down street
He comes abreast of hotel
where Smith is still sitting
For a moment he watches Macreedy speculatively, then
(calling) Mr
Macreedy
(reasonably, as Macreedy turns toward him) 'd like to ask you a few questions
as long as you're around
(walking up steps) 'm around all right
He stands facing Smith on the porch, then
(with just a touch of wryness) You probably know that Miss Brooks is no longer in the car rental business
(solemnly) Good
wouldn't want to see that girl get into trouble
You wouldn't
what with rental permits, gas rationing
you know what  mean
Sure
admire your sturdy sense of responsibility
(dismissively) It's just, a girl like that has a future
Let's talk about my future
(almost slyly) Do you have the time
don't seem to be going any place
He takes the other chair
(after a pause) hear you handle a jeep real well
have a way with jeeps
certain familiarity
think  understand
You're an Army man
(looking at Macreedy's stiff arm) Where'd you get it
Italy
(sincerely) Tough
tried to get in myself, the day after those rats bombed Pearl Harbor
What stopped you
The physical
They wouldn't take me
The morning after Pearl,  was the first man in line at Marine recruiting in Sand City
And they wouldn't take me
(flatly) Tough
What do you do in Los Angeles, Mr
Macreedy
'm retired
You're a pretty young man
You might say  was forced into retirement
What were you looking for in Adobe Flat
Komako, like  told you
Like you told me, he wasn't there
Smith laughs quietly
What's so funny
Nothing
It's just --  don't believe you
believe a man is as big as what he seeks
believe you're a big man, Mr
Macreedy
Flattery will get you nowhere
Why would a man like you be looking for a lousy Jap farmer
Maybe 'm not so big
Yes, you are
(a beat; looking hard at Macreedy) believe that a man is as big as the things that make him mad
Nobody around here has been big enough to make you mad
What makes you mad, Mr
Smith
Me
Nothing in particular
(bemused) see
You're a big man, too
Only
(calmly) the Japanese make you mad
That's different
After the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor
after Bataan
and Komako made you mad
It's the same thing
(scoffing) Loyal Japanese-Americans -- that's a laugh
They're mad dogs
Look at Corregidor, the death march
What did Komako have to do with Corregidor
Wasn't he a Jap
Look, Macreedy, there's a law in this county against shooting dogs
But if  see a mad dog loose,  don't wait for him to bite me
(exhales sharply, shaking his head with irritation) swear, you're beginning to make me mad
(calmly) All strangers do
Not all
Some of 'em
When they come here snooping
Snooping for what
mean, outsiders coming around, looking for something
(pressing) For what
don't know
People are always looking for something in this part of the West
To the historian, it's the "Old West
" To the book writers, it's the "Wild West
" To the businessmen, it's the "Undeveloped West
" They all say we're backward and poor, and  guess we are
(snorts) We don't even have enough water
(a beat) But this place, to us, is our West
(heatedly) just wish they'd leave us alone
Leave you alone to do what
(coldly) don't know what you mean
What happened to Komako
He went away,  told you
Shortly after he left, a bunch of kids got fooling around out his place
They burned it down
It was one of those things -- you know how kids are
Macreedy laughs quietly
What's funny
Nothing
Only --  don't believe you
Any more than  believed you about the letters
(smiling) You don't seem to believe anything say
(vaguely) Yes,  do -- about businessmen, for instance
think a businessman would be interested in Adobe Flat
Why
All that land lying fallow
Could be put to some use
Like a graveyard
(Smith opens his mouth to speak but Macreedy goes on) historian might be interested, too
Because of the strange customs around here, such as burying cattle
Burying cattle
(calmly) Something's buried out there
He takes the wild flowers from his pocket, holding them in front of Smith
See these wild flowers
That means a grave
've seen it overseas
figure it isn't a man's grave or someone would have marked it
Sort of a mystery, isn't it
Sort of
Maybe you can figure it out
Macreedy gets up, half turns to Smith
Maybe
He starts down the steps
Why not give it a whirl
(Macreedy turns) It'll help you pass the time
(continued; meaningfully) for a while
Not interested
got other things to do
He turns and walks down the street
- headed towards Doc's establishment
The building, which serves Doc as home, office and laboratory, has centered on a pane of glass: , And in the lower right hand corner: few of the peeled gold and black letters are completely missing
The building is separated from the structure next to it by an alleyway
Filling the narrow passage is Hector David, his long massive body wedged against the wall like an unkempt monument
His little pig eyes meet Macreedy's
Hector spits in the dust with bland insolence
'  - walks up the steps and enters
' Dark and shadowy
At the far end of a hallway an insipid light bulb burns
Macreedy goes toward it, entering
' devoted to the care and preservation of the Dear Departed
In the center of the room is a long rectangular slab stained with the juices of those unfortunates who have had occasion to rest thereon
The walls are lined with rickety bookcases jammed, not with volumes, but with the jugs and jars, the chemicals and unguents of Doc's multiple callings
In a corner three or four neat pine boxes are stacked one on the other
Doc sits at a cluttered desk feeding a large bowl of goldfish and sipping a glass of milk
He looks up as Macreedy enters
Hi
Pull up a chair
(nodding) Can  use your phone
Help yourself
(chuckles) You know, you're one of the few people who's ever been back here  can say that to
Macreedy reaches for the phone book
It's 4-2-4
(pausing) What's 4-2-4
If 've got you pegged -- and  think have -- you're calling the State Police
But if  was you -- and 'm purely glad 'm not -- 'd look it up myself
(emphatically) wouldn't trust anybody around here, including me
Macreedy thinks it over and comes to a swift decision
He checks the phone book
Then, picking up phone
(to Doc) Thanks
(into receiver) 4-2-4
' a cubbyhole behind the hotel clerk's desk in the lobby
At the switchboard is Pete, and above him tacked on the wall is the sign: (into phone) 4-2-4
(he looks up) revealing Smith standing beside him
The two men exchange a nod
(into phone) Lines 're busy
(he clicks off the instrument) ' Macreedy slowly puts down the phone
Doc sips his milk, all the while staring queasily over the glass at Macreedy
He puts it down, his gaze still fixed on the stranger
(sing-song) know -- don't tell me -- lines all busy
They'll be busy all day
(after a beat, grimacing) Don't look at me like that
Like what
Like 'm a potential customer
Everybody is -- and  get 'em coming and going
He goes to a topographic map hanging on the wall -- a large, impressive map -- faded, fly-blown and divided into sections
(gesturing toward it) First  sell 'em a piece of land
Think they farm it
Nope
They dig for gold
He moves to photograph beside the map on the wall -- a large, impressive photograph of a placer mine in operation
They rip off the top soil of ten winding hills
They sprint in here, fog-heaved with excitement, lugging nuggets, big and bright and shiny
He moves to his desk, picks up a glistening blob of stone, resting next to an assayer's scales, and examines it
(rhetorically) Is it gold
He bangs the rock down next to the scales
It is not
Do they quit
They do not
He moves to a third illustration -- a colored reproduction, large and impressive -- of acres upon green acres of produce in bloom; the kind of picture Southern Pacific places above its calendars
(with theatrical gesture toward reproduction) Then they decide to farm
Farm
In country so dry you have to prime a man before he can spit, and before you can say "Fat Sam" they're stalled, stranded and starving
They get weevil- brained and buttsprung
He moves to the coffins piled in a corner and runs his hand down the smooth pine sides with loving tenderness
(simply) So  bury 'em
(a beat, as he rejoins Macreedy in the center of the room) But why should  bore you with my triumphs
Yeah
've got a problem of my own
Doc nods; he points vaguely toward the street
(like an old testament prophet) They're going to kill you with no hard feelings
(nastily) And you'll just sit on your hands and let them
Don't get waspish with me, young feller
Sorry
feel for you, but 'm consumed with apathy
Why should  mix in
To save a life
got enough trouble saving my own
(he refills his glass from a milk bottle on the desk) try to live right and drink my orange juice every day
But mostly try to mind my own business
Which is something 'd advise you to do
It's a little late for that
You can still get out of town
And you'd better get out like a whisper
How can
(taking a key ring from his pocket) got sort of a limousine at your disposal
Where is it
(tossing him the key) Out back
Macreedy snares the key and walks out
Doc gets up to follow him
' An old-fashioned hearse, with plate glass sides and elaborate lead candelabra -- Doc's "limousine" -- is parked a few steps from the door
Macreedy climbs in behind the wheel as Doc comes out and stands on the small back porch
Macreedy turns on the ignition switch
His foot kicks over the starter, but the spark doesn't catch
He tries again, then again
He pauses, frowns, as Doc comes down from the porch and joins him
(concentrating on the dashboard) Won't start
(nervously, to Macreedy) Something wrong
Just won't start
Again he presses the ignition switch
Nothing
And suddenly, in b
g
, the great bulk of Hector David looms up, leaning against the porch pillar at the corner of the alleyway
His expression is almost dreamy
For a moment he stands there while Macreedy toys with the ignition and the sick engine wheezes and grinds
Then he ambles up to the hearse
(gratuitously) Could be the wirin'
Why don't you look under the hood
For that  thank you
(pause) How much time you think 've got before
They'll wait at least till dark
(angrily) They'd be afraid to see each other's faces
(slapping Doc's shoulder lightly) Well, so long, Doc
can't say it's been charming but
Where are you going
don't know
But 'm going on foot
That's no good
You stray ten yards off Main Street, and you'll be stone, cold dead
(offers Macreedy a cigarette) That's the situation, in a nut
Macreedy takes the cigarette, lighting a match with one hand
He puts the fire to Doc's smoke and then lights his own
He inhales, exhales, thinking
Finally
Macreedy gets out of the car
Hector has already opened the hood
Doc peers nervously over his shoulder
As they study the engine, Hector's horsey face appears behind them
He gestures toward the engine
- Focal point: a hopeless snarl of ignition wires
It's the wirin', like  said
Now wasn't that a good guess
Slowly he takes off his wrist watch and puts it in his pants pocket
(quietly) It can be fixed
Ignoring Hector, he bends over the engine, controlling his obvious awareness that Hector has fouled up the ignition
Easy
Unless, of course, this here wire
(reaching inside the hood, pointing) got broke or something
(suddenly, heatedly, turning on Hector) Do the nice little things, like keep your big fat nose out of my business
Hector's eyes go hard
He reaches out suddenly, one great hand closing over the distributor cap
He yanks, ripping the feed wires out of their sockets
(triumphantly, holding up the wires) Yep
It's the wirin'
Still gripping the wires, he walks off
Doc simmers down
He turns to face Macreedy, who hasn't moved
Now Macreedy slowly lowers the hood of the car
(softly, after a beat) 'm sorry, son
You got to admit, tried
(as if to himself) Maybe
Maybe what
If  can't get out of town, maybe can get the state cops in
(irritably) You tried the phone, didn't you
You know what happened, don't you
There's another way
'll be seeing you, Doc
He walks off
Doc looks after him grimly
(calling) hope you'll be seeing me
: ' Macreedy stands at the high counter, writing on a Postal Telegraph blank
Behind the counter, watching him nervously, is Hastings
At the agent's elbow is a big pitcher with dew on the glass
It holds a pale liquid and a chunk of ice
His eyes on Macreedy, Hastings refills a glass tumbler
He takes a gulp as Macreedy puts down the pencil and pushes the message toward him
Now Hastings puts down his glass, picks up the form and scans it hurriedly
He looks at Macreedy, eyes glazed with anxiety
You notifyin' the state po-lice
(putting a bill on the counter) That's what it says
Hastings again refills his glass, slopping the liquid over on the counter
He picks up the glass, hesitates, offers it awkwardly to Macreedy
(plaintively) Lemonade
Macreedy shakes his head
No
(mopping his forehead) It's hot as Billy-be-durned
He drinks, puts down the glass
Macreedy pushes the bill across the counter toward him
Hastings picks it up gingerly then pauses
Don't you like lemonade
never thought much about it
It don't have the muzzle velocity of some other drinks drunk around here, but it's good for what ails you
(after a beat) What ails you, Mr
Hastings
Me
Why are you so upset about
(points) this wire
Me
Are you afraid, Mr
Hastings
Me
(a beat, then softly) guess  am
(awkwardly he puts Macreedy's bill back on the counter) But what's the use talkin'
(with grudging respect) You don't know what it's like, being scared
(not unsympathetically) You want me to describe the symptoms
Right this minute 'm scared half to death
(simply) You should be
Yeah
But not of the state police
(stonily) Neither am
Then what are you afraid of
The grave at Adobe Flat
grave nobody marked, nobody knows anything about
That ain't it, either
Is it Smith
(no answer) Is it
(squirming) Look, Mr
Macreedy
'm just a good neighbor
To Smith you are
How about to Komako
(meeting Macreedy's eyes) never seen Komako in my life
Honest
(again pushes the bill toward Hastings) Then send that wire, and bring me the answer
You'll do that, won't you
(pauses, then worriedly picking up the bill) Yes, sir
Macreedy turns and walks out
Hastings stands sweating, staring hard at the message in his hand as
: Sequence omitted from original script
'  & few loafers are at the bar, draped bonelessly on high stools
There is the usual array of bottles and glasses aligned before a cracked, discolored mirror
In the corner is a jukebox
Along the opposite wall is a line of low stools facing a counter covered with oil-cloth thumb-tacked in place
Behind it is a greasy hot plate and a couple of soiled displays -- breakfast food, soft drinks, etc
At the grill counter is Sam, cleaning his finger-nails with a toothpick
At the bar, engaged in a worrisome conversation, are four loafers,  ,  ,   and tell you,  won't have anything to do with it
(nodding emphatically) Live and let live, that's what say
(frowning) don't know
just don't know
(to Bentham) You gonna brood about it
Or you want another beer
beer,  guess
Only
He looks up, and something makes him hesitate
--
&  - stopping in front of the restaurant
On the window large, rough capital letters in water paint proclaim: '   & Macreedy pauses, shrugs and then enters
& Sam is still working on his finger nails
He evidences little interest in the stranger, but at the bar in b
g
the loafers stiffen
Macreedy takes a stool in front of Sam
What'll you have
What have you got
Chili wit' beans
Anything else
Chili wit'out beans
Macreedy winces
You don't like the taste, that's what they make ketchup for
In that case, 'll have it
And a cup of coffee
The door of the Bar & Grill opens
Smith and Coley enter
They walk to Macreedy, stopping just a few feet behind him
(to Macreedy, with menacing friendliness) You still around
thought you didn't like this place
(pleasantly) Going to, or coming from
Staying put
No comment
He turns again as Sam plops an unseasonable mess of chili in front of him
(to Smith, gesturing a thumb toward Macreedy) No comment, he says
No comment, and all the time he's got my chair
Macreedy smiles tiredly
He half turns toward Coley
always seem to be taking somebody's place around here
He gets up, with his chili, and sits down three stools away
Coley straddles the stool Macreedy has vacated
He squirms on it, his movements exaggerated
Now he spins to face Smith
This seat ain't comfortable
was afraid of that
think 'd like the seat you're on
(to Macreedy, mildly) He's as changeable as a prairie fire
(to Coley) Suppose you tell me where to sit
Coley opens his mouth but, realizing he has been outmaneuvered, closes it again
The loafers in b
g
are silent, watching
Sam, seemingly oblivious to Coley's pressure on Macreedy, places a bottle of ketchup in front of the stranger
Coley gets up slowly and walks stiff-legged to Macreedy
He takes the bottle of ketchup and, without removing the cap, upends it over Macreedy's plate
The cap is drowned in a deluge of ketchup which overflows the plate and runs onto the counter
(to Macreedy) hope that ain't too much
(to Smith, gesturing toward Coley) Your friend's a very [
] fellow
(nodding) Sort of unpredictable, too
Got a temper like a rattlesnake
That's me all over
'm half hoss, half alligator
Mess with me, 'll kick a lung outta you
What do you think of that
No comment
Talking to you is like pulling teeth
You wear me out
(loudly, after a beat) You're a yellow-bellied Jap lover
Am  right or wrong
You're not only wrong -- you're wrong at the top of your voice
You don't like my voice
(again turning to Smith) think your friend's trying to start something
Now why-ever would he want to do that
don't know
Maybe he figures, needle me enough and 'll crack
Maybe 'll even fight back
Then he or Hector -- your other ape -- would beat me to death and cop a plea of self-defense
don't think that'll be necessary
You're so scared now you'll probably drown in your own sweat
Before that happens, couldn't  pick a fight with you if  tied one hand behind me
Macreedy rises to go out
As he passes Coley, Coley takes his limp left arm and spins him slowly but firmly around
The two men face each other
If  tied both hands
Macreedy shakes free of Coley's grasp
Coley lunges
His big right fist streaks toward Macreedy's face
Macreedy ducks, weaving with the punch
He grabs Coley's belt, twisting Coley's body
The momentum of the swing throws Coley off balance
As he goes past Macreedy, the stranger tugs at his belt, twisting him to one side
He plants his left foot firmly on the toes of Coley's left boot, for a split second anchoring Coley in place
He chops the under side of his open hand in a short, vicious arc that lands solidly under Coley's ear
With the same motion, he brings the heel of his hand hard against and slightly under the tip of Coley's nose
The cartilage shatters
Blood spills down his face
Following through, Macreedy's elbow smashes beneath Coley's cheekbone
Macreedy's arm goes past the astonished, wind-burned face, finding Coley's right wrist
He jerks the wrist out and backward
It snaps
Coley whimpers, his face twisted in pain and perplexity
His body lolls forward
Macreedy steps back
He raises his right shoulder a few inches
His bent right arm drives up like a piston attached to the shoulder's lift
Fist and arm seem all one rigid piece with only the limber shoulder giving them motion
The fist strikes Coley's face, covering for a moment one side of his chin and a corner of his mouth between cheekbone and jawbone
Coley shuts his eyes and falls unconscious
Smith, a puzzled expression on his face, watches Coley fall
He takes half a step toward him
Macreedy looks at Smith
Smith stops
Macreedy's face is wooden, with a trace of sullenness around the hard lines of his mouth
Working methodically, Macreedy frisks Coley
He takes from a pocket a long, ugly knife
He snaps the spring and the four-inch blade leaps into place
He looks at the knife in his hand and then at Smith
He smiles gently, even dreamily
(to Smith) Wouldn't it be easier if you just waited till  turned my back
(looking toward the loafers at the bar, then back at Smith) Or are there too many witnesses present
Macreedy walks slowly toward him, holding the knife
The are only three feet apart
Smith's hand goes to a pocket, closes inside over the outline of a pistol
Sam glances from Macreedy to Smith to the unconscious Coley
He sidles toward the door and runs out fast
(: From this point to end of scene from Macreedy and Smith to exploit the reactions of the loafers at the bar
) (with effortless ferocity) You're still in trouble
So are you
(Smith snorts) Whatever happens -- you're lost
You got things a bit twisted
You killed Komako
Sooner or later you'll go up for it
Not because you killed him -- in this town you probably could have gotten away with it -- but because you didn't even have the guts to do it alone
You put your trust in guys like him
(gesturing toward the unconscious Coley) and Hector -- they're not the most dependable of God's creatures
Sooner or later they'll get the idea you're playing them for saps
What'll you do then -- peel them off, one by one
And in the meantime if any one of them breaks, you'll go down hard
Because they got something on you
Something to use when things get tough
With a quick motion, he tosses the knife to Smith
Smith catches it
And they're getting tougher every minute
He walks past Smith and goes out the door
Self-consciously holding the knife, Smith turns to face the loafers at the bar
They say nothing; they stare at him, through him, like a panel of ghouls
The door opens, admitting Sam and Doc, who carries his little black medical bag
Doc looks at Coley
(softly, full of awe) Man
man-oh-man
He goes to Coley, bending down over him
Smith has remained motionless as a monument
Now he doubles shut the knife in his hand
He pockets it, and without even glancing at Coley, turns quickly and goes out
: Doc sits deep in the battered upholstery of one of the chairs
He stares fiercely across the room at Smith who is on the couch, reading a neatly folded newspaper
Behind him at the clerk's desk, Pete is fitfully involved in a game of solitaire
At the foot of the stairs Hector is pouring change into a slot machine
It whines, grinds, and clicks with rhythmic monotony, but it never seems to pay off
In the chair nearest Doc is Tim, with one of his boots off
He works hard and with some concentration, removing the other
Then he places them neatly at the foot of his chair
He wiggles his toes -- watching them with some interest
The wheeze and whir of the slot machine stops
The sudden silence turns the eyes of the men toward Hector and the one- arm bandit
They follow his gaze up the steps
- walks down, carrying his suitcase
He goes to Pete at the clerk's desk
Anything for me
Nothing
Any message -- a telegram
(returning to his cards) Nothing
As Macreedy turns from the desk, Doc joins him
(to Macreedy, shrilly, gruffly) In case you're interested, Coley'll live
(glaring at Smith and Hector) 'm truly sorry to say
Smith coolly continues to read his paper
It is Hector who turns toward Doc
(to Doc, jerking a fat hand toward Macreedy) Your friend's pretty tough
Yeah
He's wicked
He defends himself when he's attacked
Macreedy ignores the exchange of words
He walks across the frayed carpet to the nearest chair and drops into it
Doc, who has followed him, stands looking down at Macreedy for a long moment
Then
(with some irritation) Well
You going to just sit here and let time run out
'm waiting for a wire
From the state cops
You sent it through Hastings
(an audible sigh) Just don't expect an answer, if that's the way you sent it
(looking toward the door) No
(he rises) Doc follows his gaze as Hastings enters the lobby and looks around
He sees Macreedy coming toward him
He walks rigidly in an arc past Macreedy to Smith
He holds out a Postal Telegraph form
Smith puts down his paper and takes it
Macreedy, followed by Doc, goes over to Smith
Tim in his stockinged feet joins them
Smith scans the message
He looks up to meet Macreedy's gaze
Smith rises
Hector swaggers over from the slot machine
Hastings slips around the back of the couch, protected by the barricade of Hector's great body
(evenly, to Smith) think that's for me
(he takes the message from Smith's hand and quickly glances at it
Looking up at Hastings) Where's the answer
Hastings is silent
brittle expression of bemusement crosses Smith's features
You expect an answer -- to a wire that's never sent
Macreedy's mouth compresses in a harsh grin
What's so funny
Nothing
Just a thought -- (his eyes turn to Hastings
Hastings wilts) -- a thought dazzling in its purity
Macreedy takes a step toward Hastings
The telegraph agent bounces away
(slowly) You're in a jam, Hastings
You gave my telegram to Smith
(excitedly) You warty wretch
That's a federal offense
(to Smith) You're in deep, too
(grins hard) Like  said, it's getting tougher and tougher
(to Tim) Sheriff, you'd better do something about this
Tim hesitates, blinking his eyes worriedly, shifting from one stockinged foot to the other
Smith watches him insolently as he takes the message from Macreedy and gestures with it vaguely
(to Smith) reckon that's right, Mr
Smith
Don't be a jerk, Tim
(to Smith, seriously) Divulging information -- there's a law
Tim, you're pathetic
(doggedly) Could be
But 'm still Sheriff
That's the point
You're not Sheriff any more
You just lost a job, you're so pathetic
He reaches out, clawing the badge from Tim's chest
He jabs it on Hector's vest
(to Hector) All right, Sheriff
Take over
You can't do that
Can't
put him in office
Now take him out
Hector moves his elephantine bulk within inches of Macreedy
Now
You want to register a complaint
Macreedy doesn't answer
Hector takes the message from Tim's limp hand and tears it into little pieces
To register a complaint, boy, you've got to have evidence
You got evidence
Macreedy doesn't answer
You got a big mouth, boy, makin' accusations, disturbin' the peace
There's laws in this county protectin' innocent folks from big mouths
Why, 'd just hate to
(interrupting) Hector
(wearily) Come on, Hector
He walks out, the new Sheriff strutting beside him, with Hastings in their wake
For a moment Macreedy, Doc and Tim stand in the center of the lobby
Pete eyes them non- committally and goes back to his solitaire
He glances up now and then, moving the cards with a purposeful sort of slowness, as of a more natural swiftness restrained by his preoccupation with the three men in the lobby
Macreedy is deep in thought
Abstractedly he tugs at his collar and then repeats the ritual of lighting a cigarette
Tim's shoulders are slumped
Humiliation has corroded him, flesh and soul
Even Doc is momentarily subdued; he too, feels degraded, unclean
Macreedy looks from one to the other of the good, ineffectual companions that circumstance has so haphazardly tossed his way
He takes a few steps to his suitcase, Doc and Tim trailing him; Doc, for want of something better to do; Tim, out of his deep, inexpressible need for support
Macreedy takes an untapped bottle of whiskey from his bag
He thumbs the cork loose and holds the bottle out to Tim
Tim takes a drink
The light on the clerk's desk goes on, and we are aware that day has gone and that night is falling
The pressing, fierce light has drained from the lobby, leaving a shadowy, silvery dreariness
The shadows have lengthened and the silver has tarnished with the darkness
(hopefully) It's all right, Tim
We're not licked yet
(numbly) Ain't we
am
There comes a time, Tim, when a man's just got to do something
Not me
'm useless, and  know it
(imploring) No man is useless, if he's got a friend
Pete comes out from behind the desk, walking from one lamp in the lobby to another, turning them on
'm your friend, Tim
Then let me alone
He hands Doc the whiskey bottle
(jabbing at Macreedy with a thumb) He's going to need you before the night is over
He downs a snort, then looks at Pete, who approaches them
(contemptuously) And all the useful men are on the other side
As Pete turns on the lamp behind Doc, he reacts ever so slightly to Doc's words
His almost imperceptible grimace is not lost on Macreedy
Macreedy watches the young man as he continues to light the lamps
(angrily) Lemme alone,  tell ya
Doc slams the whiskey bottle down on a nearby table
can't let you alone
can't let myself alone
Don't you understand that
(he turns from Tim to Pete, who is unable to shake his gaze
Then, sadly, fiercely) Four years ago something terrible happened here
We did nothing about it
Nothing
The whole town fell into a sort of settled melancholy, and the people in it closed their eyes and held their tongues and failed the test with a whimper
Self-consciously Pete has backed off until now he leans against the outside of the clerk's desk
But he still can't shut his ears to what Doc is saying
Now something terrible is going to happen again, and in a way we're lucky because we've been given a second chance
And this time  won't close my eyes,  won't hold my tongue, and if 'm needed  won't fail
(almost harshly, again facing Tim) And neither will you
Tim sighs, running a thick hand over his forehead
got such a headache, 'm bewildered
hurt all over
know -- (unconsciously his right arm strays to massage the paralyzed left) -- pain is bewildering
came here bewildered, full of self-pity, afraid to fight back
(gesturing with his hand to Pete) And then your friend Smith tried to kill me
(the muscles around Pete's mouth tighten) Funny, how a man clings to the earth when he feels there's a chance he may never see it again
There's a difference between clinging to the earth
(eyeing Tim almost contemptuously) and crawling on it
You going to stand by and watch forever
(flatly) ain't gonna watch, and  ain't gonna get into it, either
There is a moment of crashing silence
Then
'm gettin' out
'm sorry, Mr
Macreedy
Slowly he lumbers out of the lobby
Doc watches him go
Again the benumbing silence, cut finally, unexpectedly by
(to Doc) You'd be smart to get out, too
(angrily turning to Pete) There's too many smart guys around here
'm glad 'm a dummy
You're a troublesome dummy
You're liable to end up on your own slab
(heatedly) expect to be in a lot more trouble before  die
Go home, Doc
(he jerks his head toward Macreedy, and with mock bravado
) He's all washed up
(grinning harshly at him) You think so
His right hand closes over the neck of the whiskey bottle on the end table
Abstractedly fingering it, he walks with tense, deliberate steps toward Pete at the desk
was washed up when  got off that train
He continues to advance inexorably toward Pete
(flatly) You shouldn' of got off
Had to
had one last duty to perform before  resigned from the human race
(quizzically) thought you were going to Los Angeles, that hot-bed of pomp and vanity
Is that resigning from the human race
(shrugging) 's a good jumping off place -- for the Islands, for Mexico, Central America
Why
(again shrugs) don't know
was looking for a place to get lost,  guess
Why
(slapping his paralyzed arm with the whisky bottle) Because of this
thought 'd never be able to function again
(turning to Pete) Thanks to your friend Smith,  found was wrong
He is now within a couple of yards of Pete
(drily) Sure
You're a man of action
(slowly) know your problem
(with mounting vigor) You'd like me to die quickly, without wasting too much of your time
(Pete opens his mouth to say something, but Macreedy presses on) or silently, without making you feel too uncomfortable
or thankfully, without making your memories of the occasion too unpleasant
For a moment Pete stares at Macreedy, terribly disturbed by the incisiveness of Macreedy's analysis
Then
(bitterly) My memories are so pleasant as it is
In sudden frustration, Pete grabs the deck of cards on the clerk's desk and slams them down hard
They scatter
He turns, stares blankly [
] between Doc and Macreedy
(quietly pressing his advantage) What happened, Pete
Pete doesn't answer
Are you going to tell him -- or you want me to
(beat) Smith owns Adobe Flat
He leased it to Komako -- thought he had cheated him, thought Komako could never even run stock without water
There was never any water on Adobe Flat
Komako dug a well, by hand
He must have went down one hundred and fifty feet
He got water, plenty
Smith was pretty sore
He didn't like Japs anyway
That's an understatement
The day after Pearl Harbor, Smith went to Sand City
(interrupting) know
To enlist
He was turned down
He was sore when he got back
About ten o'clock he started drinking
Ten o'clock in the morning
Yeah
Hector joined him, and Coley
Then Sam, and about nine p
m
-- me
We were all drunk -- patriotic drunk
We went out to Komako's for a little fun,  guess -- scare him a little
Did you know him
We'd seen him around some, but none of us knew him
When he heard us coming, he locked the door
Smith started a fire
The Jap came running out
His clothes were burning
Smith shot him
didn't even know Smith had a gun
Then you all got scared, buried him, kept quiet
Pete nods helplessly, bowing his head
Macreedy sighs, looks down at the bottle in his hand, slowly puts it on the table
(softly) Did Komako have any family besides his son Joe
(puzzled) His son
Nobody around here knew he had a son
He had one
But he's dead, too
He's buried in Italy
What are you doing here, Mr
Macreedy
Joe Komako died in Italy, saving my life
They gave him a medal
came here to give it to his father
Silence
Doc, realizing the enormity of Macreedy's admission, frowns, rubs a hand across his tired eyes
Pete looks at Macreedy for a long, shocked moment
He shivers
(awfully) God forgive me
He takes the bottle from the table and shakily pours a shot glass of liquor
As he raises it to his mouth
(to Pete, harshly guttural) It'll take a lot of whiskey to wash out your guts
Pete is motionless, holding the glass inches from his lips, hypnotized by Macreedy's voice, as hard and as cold as his eyes
And it will never help -- not even a barrel full washes away murder
Macreedy's hand shoots out, in a short, inexorable arc, smashing his palm across the shot glass
The whiskey bursts in a spray, the glass flies halfway across the room, shattering as it lands against something solid
Pete is stunned, Doc perplexed, at Macreedy's violence
They stare at him
Macreedy's eyes are murky
The creases between the brows over his nose are deep
His nostrils move in and out with his breathing
Pete and Doc regard him with growing uneasiness
Rage comes into Macreedy's face, turning it a painful red
But maybe 'm wrong
Go on -- drink
(scornfully) What else is left for you
(mounting anger) You're as dead as Komako, only you don't know it
(roaring) You also don't know that it's not enough to feel guilty
It's not enough to confess
It's not enough to say, "Forgive me, 've done wrong
" Take it easy, Macreedy
Sit down
(turning on him) Sit down
Or would you rather have me kneel, to beg his pardon for raising a touchy subject
Pete squirms under Macreedy's relentless attack
(shaking his head) You don't have to remind me
've never forgotten
Well, that's mighty noble of you
You feel ashamed -- that's noble, too
(in mounting crescendo) And four years from now you'll probably be sitting here telling somebody else you haven't forgotten me
That's progress -- you'll still be ashamed but 'll be dead
Macreedy grabs the bottle, shoving it across the table toward Pete
Go on, have your drink
(with exorbitant scorn) You need it
Pete pushes the bottle aside, too ravaged by Macreedy's words and his own thoughts to drink
He shakes his head grimly and then, with sudden decision, goes to the switchboard and plugs in a line
(leaning over counter, staring at him) What are you doing
(into phone, ignoring Doc) Hello, Liz
Now listen
'm getting Macreedy out of town
- as they exchange a glance
Doc takes a long, deep breath of relief
Macreedy frowns thoughtfully
He strains to listen to Liz, but all he (and we) can hear is the staccato jumble of her words over the wire
- he cuts Liz short
(into phone) don't care about Smith
Let him try to kill me --  might as well be dead as
Again Liz's voice incoherent over the phone, and again
(into phone, interrupting) Liz, Liz
There's not much of me left any more, but however little it is  won't waste it
(again Liz's voice briefly; then
) 'm telling you because we need your help
(again Liz's voice) No matter about the past -- you've got to do this
You'd be saving two lives, Liz
Macreedy's, and mine
(again Liz answers and
) All right
Yeah
've told him everything
Slowly he replaces the phone on the switch-board
He comes around from behind the desk, joining Macreedy and Doc
(flatly) She'll be here in five minutes
Thanks, Pete
Thanks very much
: - ,    - Pete and Doc are nervously alert, drained of energy, waiting
Hector is downright bored
He toys with his pistol, squinting at it, twirling the barrel
Finding neither interest nor pleasure in the piece, he jams it back in his holster and strolls with exaggerated surety out on the porch
- The congregation of loafers look up as Hector emerges
Imbued with his own bullying importance, he draws the pistol, maneuvers an extravagant pinwheel and a few other gaudy tricks
Then he sighs as boredom again takes over
He walks down the steps to catch a bit of air
- The disappearance of Hector (o
s
) down the street galvanizes them into action
They hurry out of the lobby toward the back of the hotel
-   - Vague in the pallid light escaping through a few back windows
The hotel's rear door is tightly shut
Around the far corner of the street (extreme b
g
) comes the gangling body of Hector David
He walks toward
Perhaps twenty-five yards away he stops to rest against a fence like a leaning tower
- His hand goes to a pocket and comes out with a crumpled half pack of cigarettes
Suddenly the movement is arrested; something at the other end of the street captures his bleak attention
jeep, headlights off, slowly turns the corner, pulls up to the curb and parks
- pockets his cigarettes and starts slowly for the jeep, a quizzical frown on his horsy face
He approaches the back door of the hotel, oblivious to it as he continues toward the jeep
- At the far end b
g
, toward the lobby, a single unshaded light bulb burns dully
slight figure stands in f
g
To one side is a narrow -shaped alcove blanketed in heavy shadows
The features of the man in the hall and the slim lines of his body blend vaguely in the darkness
With enormous care, he turns a knob and opens the door leading to the alley behind the hotel
Light thrown by the back windows reveals that the figure is Pete
The same pallid light from the alley, glancing across the alcove, momentarily illuminates it
Glued as close to the recessed wall as is humanly possible is Doc
He is partially shielded by one of those hotel hose wheels around which an old fire hose is wound
The heavy brass nozzle of the hose hangs from the end
Doc grips a twelve-inch length of lead pipe
Pete swallows nervously and peers outside, first to the right, then to the left
His eyes glaze with fear, and his jaw tightens with tension
-   - as he stares at Hector walking toward the jeep
(controlling his jangled nerves) Hector
Hector stops, turns to face Pete
He hesitates, then
Hmmmm
Then, with a final glance at the jeep, Hector lumbers to Pete, who disappears inside the hallway
as Hector enters and stops
Pete quickly closes the door behind him and walks toward the lobby, attempting to draw Hector toward the black alcove center screen b
g
But Hector is not to be sucked in
He glares at Pete, waiting
(: The following dialogue is delivered sotto voce
) What you want
He's still in his room
Macreedy, mean
So
You want me to tuck him in
thought maybe you wanted to tell Smith
(explaining something he feels Pete already knows) Smith said he'd be here at midnight
He don't want to be disturbed
He jams a cigarette in his mouth
Pete watches him frantically as he searches his pockets for a match
He can't find one
You got a match
Come on
got some in the lobby
He starts to turn
Hector's pig eyes are slits of suspicion
Before Pete can move, Hector reaches out, hooking two heavy fingers inside a pocket of Pete's shirt
Slowly Hector's expression changes to one of insidious cunning
His fingers come out of Pete's pocket, and between them is a paper book of matches
thought you didn't have a match
Pete is unable to answer
He is scared to death
- sweating with frustration
Hector is six feet away, and armed -- too far away for Doc to risk an attack with his lead pipe
Doc looks around vaguely, wildly, for another weapon fraction of an inch from his nose is the hose wheel
For a split second he hesitates
Then slowly, with infinite care, he tightens the heavy brass nozzle and begins to unwind the hose
Now Hector is alert
He studies Pete's twitching face
Elaborately he tears a match from the pack and scratches it
It takes fire, cupped in the rampart of his big hands
It lights up the hall, and as Hector looks around he sees something through a mirror -- over his shoulder and six feet away Doc materializes out of the shadows of the alcove
As Hector whirls, going for his gun, Doc swings the hose with sudden deadly aim
It uncoils like a snake, and the brass nozzle crashes with a mighty thud across Hector's skull
Hector groans
He sinks unconscious to the floor
Doc stands there, paralyzed by his action
Pete tears toward the lobby
as Pete rushes in
He moves directly to the desk, leans over and presses the buzzer behind the desk three times
He turns and runs back toward the rear of the building
as Macreedy barrels down
He pauses briefly in the hall as he sees Doc still standing with the hose and the nozzle dangling like a pendulum from his hand
Their eyes lock briefly in understanding
(with a half smile) 'll never forgive you, Doc
(he gestures toward Hector, out cold) for depriving me of that pleasure
He heads toward the alley
as Macreedy rushes out
He pauses, looking quickly right, then left
He sees a jeep parked at the curb far down the street
He runs toward it
The jeep, its headlights off, starts for him
He swings onto the moving vehicle, falling heavily into the seat beside Liz Brooks
He slumps there, breathing heavily as the jeep, with a grinding of gears, cuts through the night, picking up speed
as Pete joins Doc
Silently, motionlessly, the two men stare for a long moment at Hector -- particularly at the pistol lying beside him
Then they look at each other, and the same thought seems to flash in their minds
: - as they speed down the long empty ribbon of road
Liz drives hard
Macreedy turns in the bucket seat, looking back toward Black Rock
Sorry  can't get more out of this heap
Macreedy does not answer
(with a burst of irritation) We could make better time with a dog team
(calmly) You're doing the best you can
(a beat) Aren't you, Liz
Don't expect too much from me
(dryly) Don't worry,  won't
(quickly) mean, people have always expected things from me
You know why
Because 'm pretty
Well, that's not enough
- with Liz and Macreedy as she cuts sharply into a crossroad
She drives skillfully over the knotty road which is little more than a trail
Her lovely features are distorted with her discontent and the ache for attention
After a moment she gives voice to her fantasy
(softly) Maybe  could have been something -- a model, or something
(glancing at him) You don't believe that
Yes  do
Well,  don't, really
'm a dime a dozen
That  don't believe
'm too little and too late
It's never too late
lack the muscle
(frowning) Why is muscle so important
(cynically) Oh, you're the brainy type
(harshly) Did it take brains to rough up Coley
Whatever you did to Hector, you didn't do it with brains
How'd you get Pete to change his mind
Not with muscle
And not with brains, either
He's a pushover for a muscle man
'm beginning' to think it runs in the family
(looking at her hard) You think strength is in the width of a man's shoulders
He does not catch the glance she darts him; his extreme awareness is anchored not to the girl at his side but to the terrain ahead
'd sure have liked to see you tangle with Reno Smith
He wasn't around when  left
Maybe will yet
His eyes strain to sweep the country -- each boulder, each outcropping, each stunted tree
But substance and shadow are blurred and fuzzy in the dark night, black on black
Sequence omitted from original script
- with Macreedy and Liz as it winds to the far end of the boulders on a trail that drops off into a flat basin
Solid forms loom up in the darkness; they are unrecognizable, yet Macreedy senses some tense familiarity with the terrain
He frowns
Suddenly Liz brakes the jeep -- so sharply Macreedy lurches forward in the seat
(alert, expectant) What's this
(vamping nervously) We need water
(she turns off engine, pulling ignition key from its lock) radiator's overheating
She moves away from Macreedy to get out of the jeep
He reaches across quickly, gripping her arm
She turns to face him, disturbed by his hardness of jaw and eye
Leggo
Leggo of me
Suddenly they are hit by a blinding pair of headlights like [
] The beams cut jaggedly through the night, throwing into sharp immediate relief the lava rocks, the broken windmill, the gutted house, the litter-strewn, unmarked grave at Adobe Flat
Liz throws away the ignition key
Macreedy bails out of the jeep, still holding the girl
- as they fall to the earth
Macreedy pins her down
Then in quick succession, four emphatically loud  from a rifle squirt into the shale around them
(harshly, through his teeth) You're stupid, Liz
You're a fool
If he finishes me, he's got to finish you
He looks up blindly into the headlights glaring from the granitic high ground some 60 yards away
His grip on the girl's shoulder is like a steel trap
He pushes her down beside Komako's grave, hugging the side of the jeep as a rips the gravel at their feet
Pulling the girl with him, he takes cover in the slight concavity of the grave
The jeep is between them and the headlights -- between them and the source of the gunfire
Liz struggles to break away
Suddenly bullets kick up a storm around him
bullet smashes into the flowers, exploding tiny cruel fragments of dirt into Macreedy's face
He gasps in pain, releasing Liz
He rubs his eyes as if to convince himself that he is not blind
Liz breaks from the grave
Now, five yards from Macreedy
(calling toward the headlights) Smitty
Smitty
' (o
s
) 'm here, honey
Just head for the car
Liz half turns, facing Macreedy with a vicious smile
(an almost bantering voice) So long, Macreedy
She starts toward the headlights
She reaches the foot of the rocky ridge, with the two enormous eyes on top
She begins to climb, up
up
(o
s
) Just a few more steps, honey
She is almost at the top; a vertically sheer rock about five feet high separates her from it
She looks up at Smith, towering over her at the edge of the precipice
He holds his rifle almost languorously
(breathlessly) Get him
Get him now
(easily) First things first, honey
The girl is frightened by the menace in Smith's voice
(unsure, reaching out her hand) Help me up, Smitty
You were going to help me, Liz
(she looks at him quizzically) still need your help
(confused) did what you said
You two started out in a car
That's the way you'll end up
Over a cliff, burning
(she tries to interrupt him, but he goes on
) You can blame that on Macreedy, too
He said  had too many witnesses
(dry whisper) But why me
Why start with me
got to start with somebody
He brings the rifle down, aiming almost casually at Liz
Her eyes go wide
She steps back, spins around, running crazily down the steep incline
(yelling wildly) Macreedy
Macreedy
rings out
She falls forward, rolling slowly down the embankment
She lies there
Blood trickles from the corner of her pretty mouth
rattling noise rises from deep in her throat, and then subsides
In the silence the outline of Reno Smith emerges
Holding his rifle at the ready, his silhouette illuminated sharply in the twin beams of light, he climbs down the side of the cliff
He looks toward the jeep and Macreedy, not once at the girl at his feet
(sadly, almost reproachfully) You shouldn't have done that
Smith pays no attention to her
He advances inexorably with rifle held at his hip
He fires at Macreedy
Macreedy wipes the last of the fragments from his eyes
His face is still streaked with dirt and shale
He turns, searching for something, anything, to fight back with
Then he remembers
Stiffening, his body set, his eyes narrow, he moves purposefully toward the front of the jeep and crawls under it
Again Smith opens up on him
Bullet after bullet pours into the confined space, nicking the wall, ricocheting off the jeep with a frightening, fluttery, wheezing sound
The firing stops again and in the silence we  a familiar , as in running water
- re-loads his rifle
Stiffly, he starts slowly down over the rocks toward his unarmed victim
He has unscrewed the nut and unconnected the gas line with the carburator
spurt of gasoline is running out
With a quick motion he picks up an empty whisky bottle from the litter-strewn earth
He fills it with gasoline, quickly screws the nut back on
Now he sweeps his necktie free of his collar
Holding it with his teeth, he tears the felt lining free from its silk face
He twists half the lining inside the bottle, knotting the other end securely around the bottle's neck, leaving a long strand dangling
-   - moving rigidly toward the hole
He stops, levels his rifle, fires
- pinned down in the direct line of fire
The burst of the rifle stops
- not more than twenty-five yards away, advancing carefully, rifle at the ready
- lights a match, placing the flame to the dangling end of the tie
It catches
He flings himself to his feet and with the same motion whips the fiery bottle like a football, hard and straight toward Smith
Smith fires once, fast and wild
The bottle crashes against the rocks at his feet and bursts with a shattering explosion
Smith screams as the razor-sharp slivers rip his flesh
In a puff of flame, his clothes ignite
He drops the rifle and goes down, squirming frantically on the black ashy ground
- favoring Macreedy as he tears out of the hole
He hurls himself at Smith
Wooden-faced, almost dreamy-eyed, he shovels the ashy dirt over Smith's prone chest, putting out the fire
Smith struggles halfway to his feet
Macreedy grabs his shoulder, helping him up
Smith looks at Macreedy through eyes bleary with fear and pain and shock
(through his teeth) Go ahead -- kill me
Now
'd like to kill you now, but you caused too much pain to die quickly
(a beat) You'll be tried in a court of law
You'll be convicted by a jury
Then you'll die
He drives his right fist against Smith's chin
Smith's head snaps back as far as it can go and then wobbles to rest on his chest
He collapses
Macreedy blows out his breath hard
He staggers to Liz
As he bends over her
: -  () Liz's jeep, driven by Macreedy, rolls slowly down the empty main street of the sleeping town
Behind him, under a tarp, the body of the girl lies lifeless across the seat
On the seat beside him is Smith's rifle, the balance a few inches from Macreedy's elbow
On the right front fender of the jeep Smith sits precariously, his shirt scorched and ragged
He wears a sullen expression of pained indifference
In b
g
, as the jeep passes, isolated lights go on, first in Doc's house, then in two or three others
Macreedy is oblivious to them
-   - almost completely hidden, looks out grimly from a corner of the jail window
Protruding through the bars, swiveling to follow the progress of the jeep down the street, is the long, ugly muzzle of a rifle
- as Macreedy pulls up to the curb in front of the jail and cuts the ignition
He grabs the rifle, and steps around to Smith
(tonelessly, prodding Smith off the fender with his rifle) Hands behind your head
Smith complies
as Macreedy marches Smith up the steps
The jail door opens
man emerges, wearing a Mackinaw over his vest and carrying a rifle
It is Tim
For a moment Macreedy eyes him in silence
His gun finger tightens on the rifle in his hand
Tim's rifle, too, is at the ready
(after a beat) Am  going to have trouble with you
Nope
But  sure thought the situation was going to be like reversed thought  was going to have trouble
(nodding sharply in Smith's direction) with him
'll take care of him
(still hesitating) Just as you took care of his buddies
Just as  took care of his buddies
Me, an' Doc, and Pete
The  of running feet padding along the dirt road increases on
Macreedy turns slightly, to see Doc huffing toward him
The older man climbs the jail steps and comes to an abrupt halt, his eyes going from one to the other of the two men in the stand-off
(to Macreedy) It's all right, Macreedy
He pulls Tim's Mackinaw to one side, revealing the silver- plated star pinned at the breast
Old Tim here's got his badge back
Macreedy swings his rifle from Tim to Smith
Tim lowers his, stepping to one side, allowing Smith, covered by Macreedy, to enter the jail
He goes in, Doc following
Pete sits silently at Tim's desk
In one of the two cells are Coley and Hector
In the other, Sam and Hastings
(looking around) Well
The gang is all here
thought 'd take one last whack at my job
Even if Smith killed me for it
(jerking his head toward Smith) Put him in with Hastings
Tim turns his key in the cell door
Macreedy tiredly goes to Pete at the desk
Your sister's outside, Pete
Pete rises
Macreedy halts him momentarily, gripping his arm
(flatly) She's dead
Pete walks dazedly out the door
Tim grabs Smith's shoulder and propels him roughly through the cell door
He slams it hard
As the clatter of the iron door reverberates harshly
: -   - The townspeople, with Doc f
g
, are gathered silently in the street, staring sadly, dumbly at the hotel before them
Doc wears a dark business suit, neat and conservative
The door opens (o
s
) and the people look up, their eyes lighting with expectancy
Macreedy comes out of the door, carrying his suitcase
For a moment he pauses, looking at the uplifted faces of the people in the street
In the distance we  the horn of a stream- liner
Macreedy goes down the steps, skirts the watching crowd and heads for the railroad station
Almost immediately Doc falls in step with him
The townspeople, still silent, trail after them - in f
g
, the townspeople behind them
In b
g
, as we pass, we see the main street just as we saw it when Macreedy entered town a few short hours ago
(walking, after a beat, to Doc) Tim knows where to find me if 'm needed
Doc nods
He blinks and frowns
What's on your mind, Doc
Nothing
Only
about that medal
Can we have it
"We
" Can who have it
We
(indicating the townspeople, with a vague wave of his hand) Us
Why
Well, we need it,  guess
It's something we can maybe build on
This town is wrecked, just as bad as if it was bombed out
Maybe it can come back
Some towns come back
Some don't
It depends on the people
o
s
attracts Macreedy's attention
He turns, as do Doc and the townsmen
In front of the jail, each of them handcuffed, are Smith, Coley, Hector, Sam and Hastings
Tim and four cops escort them to two State Police cars which are parked beside Tim's old sedan and another car (presumably belonging to a member of the press)
The newspaperman ( ) stands to one side with Pete
Pete as well as Tim have changed clothes; they look clean and trim
Coley has his arm in a sling
Hector's hat hides the bandage on his head
Macreedy resumes walking toward the abandoned station, with Doc at his side and the people behind him
The train pulls in
(still pressing) That medal would help
Macreedy is silent
He walks on, to the platform
He pauses, looking at the people silently in his wake and then at Doc
He takes a black velvet-covered box from his pocket -- the box containing the medal -- looks at it, and slowly hands it to Doc
Thanks, Macreedy
Thanks for everything
Macreedy turns and exits from
The people look after him
as Macreedy boards the train
The cars in front of the jail -turn and start off with the prisoners
The people move silently toward the train
Macreedy is at the passageway
Slowly the train moves out
Macreedy and a conductor stand at the doorway
The town is seen behind them and the people standing there
In the distance, Tim's car recedes
(curiously) What's the excitement
What happened
shooting
knew it was something
First time a streamliner stopped here in four years
Second time
He walks into the train
- gathering speed, diminishing, far, far into the horizon
