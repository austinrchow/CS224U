" " Screenplay by Graham Yost 1998 Falls from low grey clouds
Down below we see
Muddy, slow and powerful, overflowing its banks
In the near distance is
Filled to the maximum, water thundering out of two open gates
We close in on
There's a Dam Control Office in the middle of the dam
We the reservoir and head out over
We see " " spelled out in stones on one man's roof
We go down and into
- Storefronts are sandbagged and closed
sign on one store reads:
sign on another: And on the next store: ' Beautiful, old, ringed with a five-foot-high wall of sandbags
The floodwater is up to the first level of sandbags
Loaded down, are heading out of town on streets covered in the first water of the flood
On an island in the middle of the street
It's Civil War- era, of a general on a horse, sword held high
The floodwater is over the curb, lapping at the base of statue's pedestal
Near the statue stands
50s, with soft edges and friendly eyes
He's talking into his radio mike
So, are we all going to die
, the dam control officer, is on the radio with the Sheriff
Not right now
But 'm gonna have to let out a little more
and , two deputies, 30s, are near the Sheriff, shoring up a sandbag wall that has partially collapsed
think my best was when  turned twelve
My Dad set up a treasure hunt
It was really cool
(off Wayne's disdainful look) Well, it was
Wayne shrugs a "whatever" and pulls a sandbag up out of the water
There's unpleasant-looking muck all over his arms
He drops the sandbag back into the water and shakes off the crud with disgust
This blows
My most awful birthday was sweet sixteen
had mono
How about you
What was your worst
You kidding
You think  could've possibly had a birthday worse than this
What kind of loser do you think am
(
) Don't answer that, Phil
The Sheriff walks over
Hank says he's gonna open another gate
We're gonna get another rise
They turn at the sound of honking
The  drives up
Gentlemen
Hey -- happy birthday, Wayne
Wayne nods
Phil stiffens
They do not like this guy
(to the Sheriff) Mike,  gotta say, what you're doing
don't know if 'd be here, considering
(good-natured) Well, you would be if you wanted to get the last couple of paychecks some bastard owed you
(grins, then:) just want you to know  think the people 'round here made a big mistake
Phil grumbles to himself
"The people"
You're the one who screwed him
Sorry, Phil
(blushes) , uh -- (to Mayor, saving Phil) You know, Bob, as much as 'd love to stand here all day talking about how great  am, if you don't get moving 'm gonna have to haul your sorry ass off to jail
(laughs) Okay, okay, 'm going
Keep up the good work, boys
It's appreciated
The Mayor rolls up his window and heads off
Whaddya say we go torch the fucker's house and blame it on looters
Or how about we put a dead cow in his living room
He comes back after it's been in the water a couple of days
Hello
(shakes head) You wanna know how to get the best revenge on the Mayor and his boys
You do exactly what we're doing
You protect the town
You protect it better than they would
Better than they ever could
(thinks, shrugs) think the dead cow's better
(ignores Wayne) Any looter that comes in here is in for a big surprise, cause as long as 'm still wearing this pointy thing
(indicates badge) nobody's taking anything from this town
Nervous assistant bank manager  is hurriedly tossing stacks of money into two canvas bags
' Washes up on Wellman
(
) Do you think you could go a little faster, pal
-- 'm going as fast as  can
(
) Well, it's not fast enough
Wellman is about to speak, then sees something, gulps
Is held by one of the men, pointed at the floor
Sweeps the money off the shelves and into the bags
(
) That it
Yes
We don't keep any of our -- Ignore Wellman, grab the canvas bags and stride off
- the lower half of the front doors as they fly open
Out come   in long dark raincoats
Runs up, stopping in the open door
Hey, wait
As they slowly turn to face Wellman
We just see their faces, shielded from the rain by hat brims
Meet
Tom, 30, handsome, with an easy smile
Charlie, 50, with a tough, red face
Excuse me
Looks nervous for a second, then holds up a clipboard
You forgot to sign
We see, for the first time, by their hats and uniforms, that they are armored car drivers
There's an armored car parked at the curb, on the other side of a low wall of sandbags
Charlie sighs, goes back to Wellman and perfunctorily signs the form
Then he and Tom go to the sandbag wall
Tom holds both bags in one hand and the shotgun in the other
Charlie doesn't want to get wet
He steps from the sandbag wall onto the rear bumper of the truck, then keys open the doors
Okay
Charlie reaches out for the money bags
Tom jumps off the sandbag wall and lands in the water, splashing Charlie
For Christsakes
It's a flood, Charlie
You're gonna get wet
Charlie takes the bags, tosses them in then shuts the back
He moves toward the front, still trying to keep out of the water
Tom splashes him some more
Hey
Do you know what kind of crap is in that water
(of course he knows) Well, yeah
Tom kicks some more water at Charlie
Charlie gives Tom a withering look and climbs in the truck
Charlie gets into the driver's seat; Tom climbs into the shotgun seat
They shut and bolt the doors
Charlie gets on the radio
Dispatch, this is 31
(
) Go ahead, 31
We're leaving Huntingburg
We'll be back in an hour
(
) Ten-four
Get out of there
We're gone
Over and out
Charlie hangs up the radio
He starts writing on a clipboard
Silence for a few moments, and then Charlie notices Tom staring at him
What
Your ear
What about my ear
You've got a major hair growth going on
Shut up
'm serious
You're gonna need somebody to go in there with a weed whacker
Charlie grabs a donut bag off the seat and tosses it to Tom
Here
You're offering me one of your donuts
don't know what to say
'm getting all misty
If it'll shut your mouth you can have the whole bag
Charlie starts the truck
Tom thinks about it, then tosses the bag back
Nah
start eating donuts and 'll never get out of this truck
(disgusted) love how you think you're better than this
Don't get me wrong, Charlie
There's a lot to like about this job -- and don't just mean the dashing polyester ensemble and the solid three-figure income
(angry) You ungrateful shit
don't believe you
(surprised) Charlie, relax
was kidding
You don't wanna do this
Fine
Go back to selling hot construction machinery
That's a helluva career
It had better hours
Charlie slams the clipboard down on the seat
You think this is a joke
This is funny
Jesus Christ
You know how lucky you are you could get in here
Thirty years old and all the crap you pulled and you never got caught
(angry) That wasn't luck, old man
That was skill
was good at it
Oh, yeah, it takes a lot of skill to fence bulldozers
That's goddamn genius time
About as much skill as it takes to sit in a truck and get fat eating donuts
Oh, so that's all 've been doing, huh
Just wasting my life away
didn't say that
Yeah, building a home, raising a family -- that's just stupid
didn't say that
You know what, Tom
really don't give a shit what you said
Tom doesn't reply
Charlie puts the truck in gear; starts off
Tom looks at Charlie, shakes his head -- what was that about
-  - - Writing letters in a crossword puzzle
Holding the pen is
Late 50s, with a creased face and piercing eyes
He's sitting at the bar, drinking coffee
Rain sheets down outside
The watches , sound off
Next to Jim at the bar are
, Ray, 40s, has lank hair, rheumy eyes and a glass of Irish whisky in front of him
Kenny, 20s, long hair, has the energy of a puppy -- unfortunately he has about as much smarts as a puppy
Mr
Mehlor
40s, looks like -- and was -- a high school teacher
Sound off, a  is crying about what he has lost in the flood
"Thus saith the Lord; Behold, waters shall rise up out of the north and be an overflowing flood and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl
" Jeremiah 47:2
Ray takes a drink
Kenny leans over to Ray, sotto
You're gonna be able to buy a helluva lot of bibles, huh, Ray
Me
First thing 'm gonna do is get my brother a lawyer
Best that money can buy
thought comes to Jim -- an answer to a clue in the crossword -- and he starts filling in words as Ray and Kenny talk
What's he facing
Thirty in
He cap a cop or something
Security guard
"In the commission
" All he's got is a piece of shit
Now 'm gonna be able to afford him a good lawyer -- a guy with a haircut
Jim leans over to Kenny
'Scuse me a second
Take a look at thirty-one across
Jim slides the newspaper in front of Kenny
Shit, Jim
don't do crossword puzzles
'll take a look, Jim
Kenny can read
(to Kenny) Just look at it
You know when you write down a word and suddenly it looks all wrong
Maybe it's right, but it doesn't look right
Jim points at the newspaper
Thirty-one across
Kenny shrugs and looks down at the newspaper
(mumbles as he reads) Mention money again and
His eyes go wide
In an uncompleted part of the puzzle, Jim has written a message in the boxes
It reads:    ' Kenny looks up at Jim
Jim glances over at the bartender then back at Kenny
Understand
Did  get it right
Yeah, Jim
You got it right
- Charlie and Tom continue to drive in silence
They both sneak looks at each other
Their eyes meet for a second, then they look away
moment's pause then
Jerk
Jack-ass
hint of a smile on both of them
Tom reaches for Charlie
Give us a kiss
Come on
Charlie goes red in the face, pushes Tom away
Get out of here
(laughs, beat) You really are a cranky old fart, you know that
'm sorry
What was that about
mean, 'm just sitting here and all of a sudden you go postal on me
don't know,
It's just this weather
want to get back
You know,  really do appreciate what you've done for me
This is a good job
No, it's not
It stinks
It's putting your life on the line for someone else's money
- Looking away from town, the   is on the left
On the right is the
Farther on, on the left, is a The road is covered in water
Goes by the entrance to the high school, water shooting up from the wheels, pushing out in a wide wake
Tom glances ahead and sees that the road is covered in water
Jesus
Where's the road
Stretching out ahead of them are reflector bars on the telephone poles, a few feet above the rippling surface of the floodwater
It's there
(beat) Somewhere
hope
(beat) Look, Tom,  don't care what it is you end up doing
Oh, God, here we go again
This is the last time,  swear
Tom sees something ahead
He doesn't understand at first
The reflector bar on the pole two poles ahead is lower than the others
No reflector bars for a hundred yards, then they resume
(looks at Tom) just think, whatever it is you do, it's time you did some heavy lifting
Tom figures out what's going on with the reflector bars
Stop
No, you gotta hear this
You're better than -- Stop the truck
We're going down
The water rises fast up the grille as the truck angles down
Jesus
Charlie stands on the brakes
wave of water rushes forward from the truck, then comes back and washes over the hood, splashing up on the windshield
Back up
Charlie throws the truck into reverse but gives it too much power
They hear the rear wheels spinning underwater
Charlie eases off, the tires start to catch, they start moving backwards
Charlie and Tom exchange a quick look of relief
and then the engine dies
Charlie tries to restart it, but there's nothing
It's stopped on a downgrade -- it's a dip in the road
The water is up to the top of the front tires: up to the hubcaps on the rear wheels
The headlights are underwater, spots of yellow glowing
They've stopped next to a lighted sign
1987
Goddammit
It's a little dip in the road or something
You can see the reflectors come up the other side
(curses to himself) knew this would happen
(grabs radio mike) 'll see if there's anyone coming
Maybe we can get pulled out
Tom opens the door
Charlie adjusts the radio frequency selection button; clicks on
Dispatch, this is 31
31 calling dispatch
(
) (over radio) 31, this is dispatch
(into radio) Dispatch, we're stuck outside of Huntingburg
Truck's dead
(
) Where are you
We're on 231, headed for the Interstate
Right by a sign saying "Welcome to Huntingburg
" Tom climbs out and up on top of the truck
Tom stands on top of the truck
In one direction, nothing but blackness
The other way he can see the lights of the town
But there are no cars coming
Charlie looks over as Tom appears, upside-down, in the doorway
The town's been evacuated
We won't get any help from there
Dispatch can't get anyone out
They are aware we're carrying a shitload of money
They called the National Guard
They're gonna be here in about ninety minutes
Ninety minutes
Jesus
(nods; into radio) Dispatch, we're gonna need help a little sooner than -- There's a sudden sparking sound and the radio cuts out and interior lights and the headlights go out
Oh, shit
- Looking out as the Sheriff's car rolls past on the water- covered street
lets go of a curtain and it swings across the window
-    ' The Sheriff motions Wayne to stop the car, then he grabs the radio mike and clicks it on as a megaphone
(into mike) Henry,  saw you
Come on out
No one comes out of the house
Henry, 'm not leaving until you come out
few moments pass and then
Late 70s, step out onto their porch
Jesus
Christ, Henry,  told you to stay away from the damn window
Gets out of the car
What are you still doing here
We're just -- We're setting traps
That's illegal, Doreen
You gonna arrest us, Sheriff
Hell, are you even sheriff anymore, Sheriff
Didn't you lose an election
sure as hell know  didn't vote for you, and neither did Henry
Doreen
You don't need to set traps
That's what they said in '73
When we got back, anything the bastards didn't steal they broke, just for the hell of it
That's not happening this time
Damn right it's not
You can't stay, you know that
We're going to my sister's
Good
Soon as we finish setting the traps
The Sheriff wants to say something more, but he's not about to argue with Doreen
He just nods and gets back into the car
The Sheriff climbs back in
He and Wayne watch Henry and Doreen go back into the house, Doreen still nagging at Henry
God'll understand if you have to drown her in the basement, Henry
The Sheriff sighs, nods to Wayne
Wayne puts the car in gear
- The water is creeping up the sloping hood of the truck
We gotta get out of here
What about the money
The money's safe; we're not
Water rose about a foot in the last twenty minutes
The National Guard isn't going to be here for another hour
You do the math
Tom shrugs -- Charlie's right
They're about to get out when light washes up on them
They look out to see
Approaching on the other side of the dip, a quarter-mile away
Look at each other then get out of the truck
Stops on the far side of the dip -- a hundred yards away
The headlights shine across the water
Doors open and get out
Come around the front of the truck
They can't see through the glare of the Suburban's bright headlights
Hello
' You okay
You stuck
Yes
' We'll see if we can get you out
We'll be right over
Charlie looks at Tom, relieved
Looks like we might just -- Headlights go on high beam
Squint, blinded by the high beams
Why'd they do that
Probably so they can see better
Or so we can't see at all
Charlie looks at him -- what does he mean
Tom puts his hand on his pistol
Assembled by the Suburban are
All holding guns
He speaks to them quietly
This is my retirement fund, boys, and if any one of you screws up, swear to God 'll kill you
Let's go
They start wading down into the dip in the road
Kenny carries a rifle
Tom squints through the bright light
Company dispatch and the National Guard are the only ones who know we're here
Anyone with a scanner from Radio Shack could've intercepted your call, Charlie
(realizes) Jesus
(to Jim and men) Could you turn down your lights
We're bringing a rope
Turn down your lights
We'll be right there
Tom starts to pull his gun
is fired up on adrenalin
He has his rifle up and is aiming it
Tom with his hand on his pistol, starting to pull it out
Charlie sees Tom going for his gun
He moves close to Tom, half in front of him, putting his hand on Tom's
Take it easy, Tom
Stiffens
' Squeezes the trigger of his rifle
Jumps at the sound of the rifle crack
Is knocked back
Yanks out his gun and starts shooting back
Duck down in the water
Shooting blindly, looks over and sees
horrible look on his face, blood coming out of his neck
He sinks into the water
Shoots off another few quick rounds
Drops into the water, bullets plugging in around him
Just his hand and pistol are visible, shooting blindly back toward Jim and his men Is hit by Tom's fire
Runs out of bullets
beat later we see Charlie start moving through the water -- Tom is pulling him
Doesn't hear Jim and keeps firing
Aims his pistol at Kenny's head
Stop
Kenny stops
Tom comes up in the water behind the truck, gasping, holding Charlie
Tom rests his gun on the truck bumper
'm sorry, Tom
Charlie's gone
Jim glares at Kenny, his eyes on fire
He was going for his gun
He wasn't gonna shoot, Kenny
Goddamnit
(shakes head, calls to Tom) We just want the money
Get away and we won't have to kill you
Shuts his eyes, thinking, scared
(
) Now
Tom opens his eyes
He looks down at
Floating in the water
What the hell is he going to do
Jim's men look at him
Jim motions them to wait some more
You got thirty seconds to get the hell away
Jim and the others wait, but there's no answer from Tom
The clock's running
Go
Still no response from Tom
All they can see is the front of the truck, in the light of the "Welcome" sign
They can't see the back
Jim nods to his men
They head for the truck, down into the deeper water at the bottom of the dip in the road
All have guns up and ready
Jim sends Mr
Mehlor and Ray out to circle around
They all move quietly
The only sound is the rain
Gets to the truck and moves along its side, Kenny right behind him
Jim gets to the back of the truck, nods for Kenny to cover him, then steps out behind the truck, gun up
' Tom is gone
Is floating in the water, eyes of glass
, Step into the circle of light thrown by the "Welcome" sign
(eyes Charlie) Ah, Jesus
(to Kenny) Your dad'd be real proud of you, Kenny
He was going for his gun
Mr
Mehlor,  believe we're gonna need your science project
Mr
Mehlor nods and digs into his pack
Ray looks down at Charlie in the water
" shall bring floodwaters upon the earth to destroy all that lives under the heavens and every creature that has the breath of life in it shall perish
" Genesis 6:17
Were you a preacher or something
Ray laughs
Ray did five years in the hole at Joliet
The only thing you get to read in the hole is the Bible
(to Ray) You got religion
Obviously
Mr
Mehlor laughs as he pulls something out of his pack
It's
half-stick of dynamite with a timer, mounted on a magnet
When you hit the switch you've got thirty seconds
You teach your students how to make things like that
Mr
Mehlor puts the device on the back door
You been to a high school recently, Ray
My students taught me how to make things like that
Ready
Hold on
Something's wrong
Jim touches the handle on the door
It moves
Uh-oh
He raises his pistol, grabs the door handle and pulls
The door swings open
We don't need to see what he sees -- we can tell from the expression on his face
Tom is running hard through the knee-deep water, pulling a string of canvas money bags buckled together
The truck and "Welcome" sign are two hundred yards behind him
Tom hears an angry yell
Kenny is the one yelling
Shut up
Everyone
They quiet
The patter of the rain is too loud -- they can't hear anything
Jim scans the horizon, but sees nothing
Now why'd he have to go and do a thing like that
To stay alive
(off their looks) He thinks we'll kill him -- unless he knows where the money is and we don't
There is another possibility
(off their looks) He's thinking of keeping it for himself
There's always that
Either way, we got ourselves a sharp one
What do we do
Jim is looking at something in the distance
Pretty soon the water'll be too deep for him to run
But for us it'll be just deep enough
(unclear) Deep enough for what
- glass window is smashed and water floods into the boat showroom
Jim and his men stride in
Kenny ogles a particularly nice cruiser
Jim stops at a smallish ski-boat
Here we go
(re: cruiser) What about this monster
(re: ski-boat) This is all we need
Shit, Jim, we're stealing
Can't we take anything we want
The water isn't very deep yet
We need something with a low draft
Mr
Mehlor -- find us some gasoline
Mr
Mehlor heads off
Sees something else he likes
We don't see what it is
Oh, Jim
The name   is chiseled into a crypt
Tom appears from underwater, gasping for breath
He gets to his feet and trudges off through the water
Tom comes out through the gates of the cemetery, splashing through the knee-deep water
He's running when he hears, from behind him, boat engines firing up
He turns to see
Racing toward him over the water, a hundred and fifty yards back
Sprints off
- Jim is steering the ski-boat
Mr
Mellor hunkers down beside him
We   to see
- Flanking the ski-boat, piloted by Kenny and Ray
Tom is running as fast as he can
He looks back, sees the ski-boat and jet-skis closing
They'll get him before he gets to town
He suddenly veers off the road toward
The sign out front reads:
Tom runs around the side of the high school
Ride up on the ski-boat and jet-skis and round the corner
No sign of Tom
Cut your engines
The engines are shut down
They all drift
Jim shines a flashlight over onto
There's a hole in a window large enough to climb through
- Tom wades through the classroom, pushing floating desks aside
Flashlight beams stab into the room
Tom hurries to the hall
Jim turns to his men
Let's get him out
But for Godsake, whatever you do
(with a hard look at Kenny) don't kill him
Not until we find out where he hid that money
- Tom makes his way past banks of lockers, trying to get as far as he can from the probing flashlight beams
- Kenny drifts up to the front doors
He pulls on them
Locked
Mr
Mehlor
Reaches into his pack
Tom tries lockers, looking for a place to hide
Kenny rides his jet-ski fast away from the front doors and the doors explode
Tom ducks down as
Shoots over him
Ride the jet-skis into the flooded school
Tom is swimming as hard as he can, out of breath Ray goes off down a hall while Kenny idles in the lobby
Surfaces, gasping
Hears the gasp, turns, grinning
Enemy sub off the port bow
Gets to his feet runs as fast as he can down the hall
He rounds a corner and keeps going
Guns his engine and takes off after Tom
Runs another thirty feet, then trips on something and goes down
Comes around the corner, grinning when he sees
Halfway down the hall, standing frozen, caught in Kenny's light
Guns it, racing forward down the hall toward Tom
Full steam ahead
- Hits something underwater and stops
Keeps going
He flies through the air, slams headfirst into a trophy case and drops into the water
Stands up -- he was kneeling
Low tide, sailor
On the wall, angles down into the water
Underwater there are a couple of steps leading up to a change in level in the hall -- that's what the jet-ski grounded on
Ray motors down the hallway toward the corner
Kenny
Around the corner comes a jet-ski
Ray assumes it's Kenny
See him
Then the jet-ski speeds up and shoots by him
Ray sees it's
Wearing Kenny's hat and jacket
Gives chase
Ray races after Tom along the flooded hallways, taking the turns fast
Ray pulls a gun, starts shooting
' Tearing through the halls, flashlight lighting the way
Bullets hit the walls, ceiling, water around him
Comes around a corner, sees the open front doors ahead of him
Come into view in the ski-boat, blocking the exit
Turns hard and speeds down a side hall
' wall of windows at the end
No way out
Trapped
Then
Rises out of the water, blood running down his face, pistol up
Looks back
Is on his tail
Makes his choice and guns the jet-ski straight at Kenny
Yee-hah
Fires, misses and is knocked to the side as
Hunches down on the jet-ski and crashes through the windows
Jim and Mr
Mehlor are moving right outside the windows just as Tom blasts out of the school and races off into the dark
Tom moves fast over the water
He yanks off his clip-on tie
Chase Tom's light, behind by fifty yards, heading out into farm fields
They get closer and closer and then watch as
' - Runs straight into a tree and explodes
Race up to find the burning, flaming wreckage of the jet- ski
Ray circles on the other jet-ski
Kenny, still bleeding from the head, is in the boat with Jim and Mr
Mehlor
(laughing) Nice driving, buttwipe
'm glad you're enjoying this, Kenny, but if he's dead, how do we find the money
Kenny reacts -- oh, right
Oh, he's still alive
We see what Jim sees
- Tom used his tie to wrap the throttle open
Tom is hiding in the branches of a floating tree, watching the distant lights of Jim and his men
The current carries Tom away
Jim scans the horizon; sees nothing
Ray, 'm in need of a little inspiration
"With a raging flood he makes an end of those who oppose him, and pursues his enemies into darkness
" From one of the more obscure -- Sorry to interrupt Bible study and all, but has no one but me noticed how completely screwed we are
We should be back in the motel room, counting out the money
Instead -- Jim lashes out with a fist, hard and fast, hitting Kenny in the chest, knocking him out of the ski-boat, into the water
Kenny comes up in the thigh-deep water, sputtering
No one likes this particular turn of events, Kenny, but we have a choice -- we can can either deal with it or we can walk away
There's a lot of money out there, so  choose to deal with it
If you want to go, that's fine -- start swimming
You want to stay, that's fine, too -- just stop your damn whining
Jim pushes the throttle forward and the ski-boat takes off, leaving Ray on the jet-ski, with Kenny in the water
What the hell's his problem
All the money in the world ain't worth a goddamn nickel if you get caught
It's not like there won't be other jobs
You may have more of these in you, Kenny, but Jim doesn't
Ray pulls Kenny up onto the jet-ski and takes off after Jim
- The water level is creeping up a five-foot-high wall of sandbags
Looking out over the top of the sandbag wall
tree floats by on the water
Suddenly appear on the top of the wall and
Pulls himself into view
He climbs over the wall, exhausted
Gasoline-powered pumps are sucking up any rainwater
The sandbags have kept the floodwater at bay
He hurries up the back steps and goes into the church
- Tom walks through a small room lined with closed cupboards
He goes through a door
- Tom comes out into the altar
He looks around, impressed
It's a beautiful church
Scaffolding goes up one wall -- the church is being restored
Tom is startled by a sound from above
He grabs a heavy silver candlestick as a weapon and looks up to see
Fluttering up in the rafters
Takes a breath
Just as he relaxes, he hears a whooshing sound from behind him and turns to see
Being swung at his head
Thunk and
: ' Tom slowly regains consciousness, blinking his eyes
He hears
(
) What are you doing here
But the Sheriff isn't asking Tom, he's asking
30, pretty, even in head-to-toe rain gear
was setting up pumps
sure as hell don't get what you see in that church
wouldn't expect you to, Wayne
What's that supposed to mean
Karen, did you think the order was for everyone but you to evacuate
was gonna go as soon as  filled the pumps, but the next thing  know, 've got a looter on my hands
Now, maybe 'm crazy, but  was expecting a little gratitude
think it's great what you did
That's it, Phil
That'll finally get you into her pants
Shut up
What if he'd had a gun, Karen
lot of these looters carry guns
(
) 'm not a looter
Sits up on a cot, behind bars in the holding cell, woozy
Jim and his men are searching the school for the money
Jim, it could be anywhere
It might not even be in the school
Keep looking
The rain sheets down hard
lightning flash reveals
The water is up to the horse's knees
The lightning passes and a second later thunder rolls
' The Sheriff, Phil, Wayne and Karen stand outside the cell
Tom is inside, on the cot
He touches the cut on his forehead
What were you doing at the church
told you -- he was looting it
just said 'm not a looter
(to Karen) You're the one who nailed me
(Karen nods) You got a better arm than my ex-wife
What the hell did you hit me with -- a statue
saw a flash of some guy coming at me
(mumbles, embarrassed) It was a crucifix
(to others) It was the only thing there
Oh, great
Now 'm gonna have people coming from around the world to see the face of Jesus on my forehead
Look, son, what were you doing in the church
Looking for a place to hide out
From who -- Swamp Thing
The bastards who killed my partner
That stops the room
We were driving an armored truck
The truck got stuck out past the high school
They must've picked up our call to dispatch, 'cause they knew where we were
Charlie and were just standing there and all hell broke loose
How much money did you have
little over three million
They all exchange a look -- that's a lot of money
The bank was afraid of looters
They had us cleaning out their branches up and down the river
They stole three million dollars
No,  don't think so
They all look at the Sheriff
He looks at Tom
You took the money, didn't you
hid it in the cemetery
Tied it to a crypt for a guy named Portman
What the hell'd you do that for
don't like to carry around that much cash
Jesus, Wayne, use your head
If he hadn't hidden it, they woulda killed him, too
The Sheriff looks at Tom -- is that it
Tom nods
You got any
No, it was in my jacket and  -- Color me surprised
The Sheriff thinks for a beat, then tosses some keys to Phil
Get out two rifles and a shotgun
Phil nods and goes to it
The Sheriff opens a desk drawer, pulls out an ankle holster
You believe him
Well, yes, Wayne,  do
And even if didn't, 'd say we sure as hell had an obligation to check it out, don't you think
The Sheriff starts strapping on the ankle holster
'll go with you
can show you where -- No,  think you better stay put
But that was -- Yeah, all we need is an armored car guy helping us out
The Sheriff thwacks Wayne in the ear
Ow
Wayne, what's the worst that's ever happened to you
When old Mrs
Dugan went after you with a knife
This guy just got shot at
(dismisses Wayne; to Tom) Smart move with the money
Phil comes over with the guns
(to Phil) Wayne and 'll check out the cemetery
You escort Slugger
(nods at Karen) out of town
Get her to some high ground, then come on back
The Sheriff jams a small pistol into his ankle holster
have to fill the pumps -- (pulling her out) Not any more you don't
The Sheriff straightens up, grabs a rifle from Phil and pulls Karen to the door
Wayne goes to Tom's cell door and pulls it shut with a click
Wayne
He could still be lying
The Sheriff rolls his eyes and gestures for Wayne to come along
He opens the door for Karen, Wayne and Phil to go through
Sheriff -- they killed my partner without any warning
And they're gonna regret that, guarantee you
They're gonna regret coming anywhere near this town tonight
And out he goes
' Water is halfway up the four-foot high wall of sandbags around the station
There are three outboard motorboats moored to the sandbags
Phil, take Karen's boat
The Sheriff and Wayne climb toward their boats
You can do it, Phil
The men of Huntingburg are counting on you
Just bite me
Wayne laughs as he and the Sheriff fire up their boat engines
' Tom hears boat engines start up and move away
He lays back down on the cot, listening to the rain
Empty
Light comes out from under the door to the bathroom
Hank is on the can reading a copy of "American Survivalist" magazine
An odd reaction comes over his face
He feels something weird
He looks down
Water is seeping in under the door
Holy shit
The bathroom door flies open and Hank waddles out, pants around his feet
He shuffles fast to the control wheels and starts spinning them
Two gates open fast, all the way, and water thunders out
Hank pulls up his pants as he gets on the radio
Sheriff
Sheriff
The Sheriff and Wayne are motoring in their boats, zooming through the trees, engine noise obliterating anything coming in over the radio
(on the radio) Sheriff, come in
- Phil steers Karen's small boat down Main Street, past the statue
The water is up to the rider's stirrups
(pleading) Did you see the stained glass windows, Phil
Did you see what a good job they did
can't let anything happen to the church, not after all 've put into it
Karen, you know 'd do anything for you, but the Sheriff told me to get you out of town
'm sorry
It's for your own good
Karen stands up
What're you doing
If you're not going to take me back to the church, then 'll swim
Karen moves to get out of the boat
No
Hey, hold on
Phil lets go of the throttle and stands, moving toward Karen
What am  saying
Karen suddenly turns on Phil and pushes him out of the boat
This is my boat
You swim
Karen guns the engine and shoots off down a side street
Phil stands in the waist-deep water and watches her go, flabbergasted
Karen comes around a corner and drives her boat up to the church
The water is swirling quietly, still a good three feet below the top of the wall
- Close on the lighted "Welcome to Huntingburg" sign
There's a rushing sound and a two-foot-high wall of water hits the sign
The lights explode in geysers of sparks and the water rushes on
The Sheriff and Wayne are racing through a grove of half- submerged trees
There's a rushing sound above the sound of the engines
and they're hit by the wall of water
Wayne falls out of his boat and is lost in the swirling water
Jim and his men are motoring down an alleyway when
Rushes down the alley
The water hits him hard, knocking him off the jet-ski
He's swept away by the water
The surge water shoots through it
And suddenly there's
Slammed up against the fence, pinned to it, water rushing over and around and by him
He yells as the wire cuts into him
Karen is pouring gasoline into the pumps
She hears the rushing and looks up as the surge hits
Water shoots over the top
' Tom hears the sound and opens his eyes -- what the hell is that
' The wall of water slams in hard, cascading over the sandbag wall
' , , There's two feet of water in the station
' The building is like a rock in a stream, with the water rushing up high against one wall, roiling and swirling around the sides
' Tom looks over, stunned, to see As a fine stream spits in through the keyhole
Are heaving as the water rises up against them
Gets to his feet, woozy and goes to get out of the cell
He remembers -- uh-oh: the cell door is locked
Jim pulls Ray, coughing, choking, bleeding, into the ski- boat
' The water level inside is rising fast
It hits the wall sockets and there's a spit of sparks, then all the desk lamps go dark
Light still comes from overhead fluorescent panels
Tom sees
Laying on the Sheriff's wooden desk
They're four feet away -- too far to reach
Karen suddenly has a horrible thought and stops
She shakes it off -- doesn't want to think about it -- and mutters to herself
They'll get him out
Phil is clinging to the statue as the water surges by below him
Wayne gets back into his boat
The Sheriff realizes something
Wayne
You locked him in
' Tom looks through the cell bars at wooden chairs bobbing in the water
The Sheriff's desk lifts up, starts floating
Tom gets an idea
He takes his belt off
' telephone pole is half-submerged, being pulled along fast by the current
' Tom holds one end of the belt and tosses the rest of it at
Bobbing in the rising water
He misses the keys
Tom tries again
The belt lands on the desk top
Tom very gently starts pulling
Too hard; the belt starts slipping off the desk
He gets it just right and the desk starts moving toward Tom
He reaches out with his hand, stretching
Touch the top of the desk, start pulling it toward him, and he just gets a firm grip on the desk when
Smashes into a window, bending in the bars on the window, shattering the glass, letting a torrent of water into the room
Is moved by the rush of water, but not before Tom grabs
And grips them tight
Tries the keys in the lock
They don't fit
He looks at them
The tag is emblazoned with the Ford logo
Great
can drive out of here
Tom tosses the keys into the water and looks around at
Rising very fast
foot in ten seconds
Climbs up the cell bars, the water rising with him
He's running out of room between himself and the ceiling
Three feet
Two feet
He's being pushed up by the water toward
On the ceiling, caged in a wire cover
Is terrified, about to die
The water rises up past his face
' Pull his Maglite flashlight from his belt
He takes off the lens and the battery cap, then shakes the batteries out
Sticks the flashlight tube up through the wire grate over the light fixture
He blows out the water -- like clearing a snorkel -- then breathes
Reprieve for a few moments and then
Reaches the top of the flashlight tube and starts to trickle in when
Goes dark
In the darkness, there's the sound of tubes breaking and metal being wrenched
Looks up, astonished, to see
Being lifted up and away from above
Streetlight comes in, silhouetting
Standing on the roof
The figure leans down and starts tugging at the wire cage over the inside of the fixture
In the light, Tom sees that it's
And she's pulling as hard as she can, but the wire cage isn't budging
She pulls out a Swiss Army knife, unfolds a small knife and starts taking out the screws holding the cage in place
She gets two screws out
Pulls on the cage and it swings down
He climbs up it
' Tom surfaces in a hole in the roof
There's a vent duct laying on the roof -- Karen must've kicked that over to get to the light fixture
Karen helps Tom up
She sits and he lays down on the roof, catching his breath
Thank you
owed you -- for hitting you and all
But we're even now, okay
Even
(beat, looks around) What happened
don't know
They get up
Maybe another levee broke upriver
They've been -- Just then
Explodes
The fireball rips across the dark sky, illuminating everything, showing
Fifty feet away -- Jim, Mr
Mehlor and Ray in the ski-boat and Kenny on the jet-ski -- guns aimed at Tom and Karen
Oh, God
As the lightning passes, and in the darkness, the thunder rolls
Switch on their lights and move forward
They pass
Floating down the street with other debris
The cars have been damaged by the flood -- one is missing a door
When they get closer to the Sheriff's station, what they see -- or don't see -- makes them stop
Tom and Karen have disappeared
Karen's boat is still moored to the Sheriff's station roof, empty
They're in the water
Kenny, cut your engine
Kenny shuts off the engine of the one remaining jet-ski
Jim shuts down the boat engine
They float in silence, scanning the water with their flashlights
There's no sign of Tom and Karen
Tom motions Karen to follow him
She's freaked and hesitates
Tom grabs her hand and pulls her
The ski-boat and jet-ski are right above them, flashlights playing over the water
Reach the roof of the Sheriff's station
Jim looks around
Kenny, go that way
We'll go down here
Of Kenny and Jim heading off in different directions
Rise into view in a car
They gasp for air and keep low
Tell them where the money is
can't
Well,  can
She's about to call out
Tom grabs her hard
If they know where the money is, they will kill us
Before Karen can say anything, a flashlight beam comes swinging toward them and they have to duck underwater
Watches as his flashlight beam washes over the car
Nothing there
He guns his engine and heads off down the street
Floats off around a corner
Tom and Karen surface, catch their breath
Quiet for a few moments as they both look around to see that Jim and his men are gone
So what do we do
guess just drive around until we run out of gas
(pissed) Look, 've spent the last eight months of my life restoring that church, and  just left it to come save your ass, so spare me, okay
(beat) When we get down here a little further we'll find a place for you to hide
(off her look) 'm gonna get back to the truck and wait for the National Guard
(checks watch) They should be there pretty soon
Karen nods
Tom looks at her
She's shivering
Cold
No, 'm fine
The heater just kicked in
Tom looks at her, gives a little grin
Their eyes meet for a second, then they look away
' Phil climbs up onto the roof, exhausted
He sees the hole in the roof and goes to look at it
As he's looking down
(
) Is he dead
Phil turns to see
Coasting up in their boats
No
Someone got him out
Who
(hesitates) Maybe Karen
Karen
How could she get him out
You took her out of town
-- It -- Let's hear it, Phil
It happened real fast, okay
Tom and Karen float down the alley in the car
You ever been robbed before
No
The scariest thing that ever happened before was Charlie running out of donuts
(off her look) 've only been doing this for a couple months
(not what she wanted to hear) Oh
Silence for a few moments
What'd you do before this
, uh
sold construction machinery
(off her look) was making good money, it just
don't know
It just didn't seem right for me anymore
How'd you end up in this
My uncle did me a favor; got me in
Nice favor
How's he gonna feel after tonight
My uncle was Charlie -- my partner in the truck
Oh, God
'm sorry
Tom nods -- so is he
' Phil climbs into the Sheriff's boat
She know karate or something, Phil
Maybe kung fu
mean,  can't see how else she could overpower the likes of you
Shut up, Wayne
Shut up, both of you
Let's go find Karen; see if she's got him
The Sheriff fires up his engine and heads off, Wayne following
Karen and Tom are still in the car
They freeze at the sound of engines in the distance
The sounds fade
Tom looks around
God,  wonder whose car this is
Karen plucks some cassette tapes out of the water
Well, whoever it is, he listens to Pat Benatar, Eddie Money and the soundtrack to "Footloose
" Really
(looks at tapes) Hold on
(looks around car) think this is my car from high school
Karen laughs
Just then
Gets caught on something and stops
Looks like we get out here
(Karen hesitates) Come on --  told your father 'd have you home by ten
Karen grins
Just then
down the street explodes
Hear a sparking sound and look over to see
On a telephone/power pole close to them
Rain hits it, causing the sparking sound
The floodwater is inching up the pole toward it
The water will reach the transformer in a matter of seconds
And while they're staring at that
At the end of the street explodes as water hits it
Look around -- what to do
Tom points
There
They climb out of the car and start swimming toward a house
Water is three inches from the transformer; two inches
Swimming as hard as they can
One inch from the water
Reach the house
They pull themselves up onto a television antenna/ladder running up the side of the house
Karen's feet are still in the water
Get your feet up
The water is about to touch
There's a sizzling sound
They heave a huge sigh of relief -- but then Tom realizes
Oh, shit
What
(re: antenna/ladder) It's metal
Tom pushes Karen over onto a window ledge
Then, just as Tom's about to step over
Comes screaming in on the jet-ski
He dives off the jetski, gets a hold of Tom and pulls him under
Surface
Kenny is stronger and he has Tom in a tight grip
One problem -- Kenny doesn't know the danger they're in
We've gotta --
Kenny shoves Tom underwater
Tom comes up, looks over at
The sizzling is getting louder
We have to --
Kenny dunks Tom again
Tom grabs Kenny's arms and pulls himself up fast
Tom's head comes out of the water and slams into Kenny's chin
Kenny is stunned
Tom gets free of his grasp
Hurry
Tom does the backstroke, pulling hard toward Karen
Still stunned, finally hears the sizzling and looks over at
The water touches the outer casing of the transformer
Starts swimming fast toward
Karen grabs Tom's arm and Tom gets a hold of the windowsill and pulls himself up
Grabs onto
And starts pulling himself out of the water
Explodes
Feels pretty pleased with himself until
Starts dancing with electricity and
Is hit by the voltage and his teeth clamp shut and his body goes rigid and his clothes explode in flames
Look away
Dead fish start floating to the surface
Is fried, smoking
He falls off the  antenna and hits the water with a loud and ugly hiss
He floats away, his body shaking spasmodically
Tom hears an engine approaching
He looks around, then smashes the window with his elbow
The window glass tumbles in
Tom reaches in, undoes the latch and slides up the window
He climbs in, straddling the window sill
The camera moves down Tom's leg to show
Laying on the floor, just below the window
Is oblivious
He starts to put his foot down into the trap
Just then he knocks
Off the windowsill
It falls straight down into
Hitting the trigger
The jaws snap, obliterating the cactus
Jesus Christ
Snaps into view, pointing right at Tom's head
(
) You so much as breathe funny and your head is going back out that window without you
Jim drives the boat down the street
Mr
Mehlor is scanning the water with a flashlight
Jim
Over there
Jim looks over to see
- Floating in the water
And not far from it is
Still twitching
Sequence omitted from original script
- Doreen holds the shotgun on Tom and Karen as they move away from the window, hands raised
Real slow now
Like you were in a big jar of molasses
That's it
They hear footsteps coming down old wood stairs
(
) Doreen
You haven't killed anybody, have you
've got everything under control, Henry
You go back up
Henry enters
Jesus, Doreen, you caught a whole gang
Jim and Mr
Mehlor pull Kenny into the ski-boat
Kenny is shivering
Part of his hair has been burned away
Jesus, God, it hurts
You're gonna be okay, Ken
Mr
Mehlor knows these things and he thinks you're gonna be okay
Mr
Mehlor looks at Jim
Mr
Mehlor knows these things and he thinks Kenny is going to die
It hurts
Don't you, Mr
Mehlor
Don't you think Kenny's gonna be okay
Yeah, Kenny
You're gonna be fine
Jesus,  can't stop shivering
Mr
Mehlor moves aside
Jim puts his arms around Kenny
know you didn't want me to come
You kidding
We couldn't've done anything without you
My dad'd sure be pissed off, huh
Your dad'd just want you to lay still while we got you some help
Hey -- hey the pain's goin'
(relief) Oh, man
He looks up at Jim and grins
When you said  was gonna be okay, thought you were just shittin' me
See
You gotta trust me
Kenny's shivering stops
It stops because he's dead
Jim slowly lets go
' Henry and Doreen have brought everything into their attic -- a , some silver and china, bowling trophies
Coleman lantern lights the room
(sarcastic) Well, isn't that just wonderful
Now these bastards are gonna want to kill us, too
Why the hell did you have to come to this house
We thought it was empty
You know what
The house next door is empty
So whaddya say we go back downstairs and you two keep moving
We are not going to send these people out to the wolves
Oh, we're not, are we
Then what's your plan, General Schwartzkopf
--  just don't think -- It's okay
have to go anyway
They look at him, surprised
The National Guard'll be at the truck in about fifteen minutes
'm gonna go wait for them
You can't swim that far in fifteen minutes
He could take our boat
Henry
(to Tom) 'll go get it ready for you
Henry, he is not taking our boat
Henry ignores Doreen
He pushes the attic stairs down, heads down them
(grabs ; to Tom) Here
You want a  too
How about some china
Maybe our silver
(sets  down) Henry
Henry, you leave the boat where it is
Doreen heads off down the stairs
Tom starts down the stairs, stops
Karen
(she looks at him) 'm Tom
They shake hands
Watch yourself, Tom
really don't wanna have to save your life again
Tom nods and goes down the stairs
' Henry stands on the roof of the back porch, steadying a small rowboat as Tom gets in
Doreen nags from the window
You give away our only boat in the middle of a flood
You are a genius, Henry
goddamn genius
(whispers to Henry, re: Doreen) You wanna come with me
Henry looks at Tom, entertaining the notion
Jesus, Henry, what are you waiting for -- a kiss goodbye
Get back in here
Henry sighs and lets go of the boat
Tom rows off
We see him in silhouette, crossing the gap between two houses
Are watching, from the shadows on the dark side of the street
Why don't we just get him
If our resourceful young friend hears us coming, he'll electrocute us or sink us or one of you'll shoot him
Besides
(glances at watch) know where he's going
What 'd like to know is where he came from
The Sheriff sits in his boat, moored to the wall of sandbags around the church
Wayne's boat is tied up next to it
The floodwater is trickling over the top of the wall
The gas- powered pumps inside the wall are keeping the waters at bay
Come out of the front doors of the church
They're not here
- Tom rows up to the truck and "Welcome" sign
His flashlight shows just the top of the truck and sign
Tom looks at his watch, ties the rowboat to the sign, jumps into the water
few moments pass, then Tom surfaces, holding a shotgun
Then he senses something behind him and turns to see
Floating in the water, tongue out, eyes glassy
Kicks away, horrified
And then he hears an engine
He looks
' Jim's ski-boat is coming over the water
The engine cuts out and the ski-boat drifts, a hundred feet from Tom
(yelling) Son, before you go underwater and do something tricky, there's something 'd like you to see
flashlight comes on, the beam swivels, illuminating
Standing in the ski-boat, blinking in the light
Slumps
Now,  know it's your job to protect that money, and maybe you'd even be foolish enough to give your life for it
The question is, are you willing to give their lives for it
Jim puts a pistol to Doreen's head
Drop the gun and get into the boat
Thinks for a second, then throws the shotgun away and pulls himself into the rowboat
Excellent choice
, , As Tom and Jim call to each other across the water, Doreen goes at Henry
'll take you to the money, but you gotta let them go
hope you're proud of yourself, Henry Sears
Shh
think it'd be best if -- told you not to give him the goddamn boat
Doreen, please
think it'd be best if we all stayed together
You say all you want is the money
Prove it
Let them go
don't know if that's -- We could be safe in our home instead of out here in a boat with these low- life scumbags
(after a look at Doreen, nods to Mr
Mehlor) Let 'em go
The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil motor past the statue
Wayne is driving his boat; Phil is with the Sheriff
The water is up to the General's neck
Tom helps Henry and Doreen over into the rowboat
As he does, his face comes close to Henry's for a second
(whisper) Karen
(shakes head, whispers) In the attic
They never saw her
Karen swims down the center of the street
Tom is in the ski-boat with Jim
He looks out at
As Henry rows them off into the darkness
(disappearing in dark) Faster, Henry
The bastards might change their minds
Stop lily- dipping and move it
Henry starts to turn the boat around
What're you doing
'm gonna row back there and see if he'll shoot you
Or me
Fine either way
Henry
Do you want me to get us out of here
Yes, of course,  -- Then shut the fuck up
Henry turns the boat around and rows off
Doreen is silent
' - Jim shakes his head
Tom looks at Ray, coughing and at Kenny, dead
Tom doesn't know what to say
The only thing  want to hear from you is where the money is
The Sheriff and Wayne are motoring fast down a street, the Sheriff leading
The Sheriff sees something in the water in front of him
He curses and throttles down fast
Is in the water, exhausted and cold
Jim pilots the ski-boat into the cemetery
All are aghast
Are floating in the water
Half of them have drifted up against the fence; the others are headed that way
wonder where they think they're going
What the hell's going on
This happened in a flood in Georgia
The ground gets soggy, and the caskets are air-tight -- anyone who hasn't been planted too long just pops up
You teach your students stuff like that
No wonder they kicked you out
didn't teach my students anything at all
(to Tom) Where is it
It's hard to tell now with the water so deep
Jim cocks the hammer on his pistol
Tom gets the hint
It's down there a little further
Jim nods, gives the engine some juice and they move on
Takes a quick look at his watch
Sees Tom looking at his watch
Karen is in the Sheriff's boat, wearing Phil's jacket, trying to warm up
Tom went off in their rowboat
(to Phil) It's Tom now
Looks like you lost out, pal
Where was he going
Back to the armored truck
Jim throttles down the ski-boat engine
Here
Uh
no
little farther -- They're not coming, son
Tom looks over at Jim, pretending to be confused
What
The National Guard
They're not coming
don't -- know you've been trying to stall until they show up, but they're not coming
(pause as he realizes) Oh, God
You intercepted Charlie's call, then you called them off
No, son,  didn't call them off
They never were coming
We didn't "intercept" Charlie's call
He called us direct
And on Tom's look of disbelief
Hank is on the radio
'd love to help you, Sheriff, but can't leave
If the water goes over the top again it's bye-bye, dam
Bye- bye, town
In fact,  could use a little help up here myself
The Sheriff is in his boat; Wayne is back in his own
The Sheriff is on the radio
Hank, remember when Mike Crane holed up in Jack Finch's barn and said he was gonna burn it down
Hey,  was the one who got the dumb son-of-a-bitch to come out
Right
And before you went in, deputized you, you dumb son-of-a- bitch
So when  say get down here, it's not a request, it's an order
So get down here
Now
won't need you for long
And bring your gun
We were gonna hit you just before you got on the Interstate, but then you got stuck so we had to change our plans and take you -- Bullshit
This is all bullshit
knew Charlie when we were both working construction for the Johnstown company
His middle name was McCarthy because his parents loved Charlie McCarthy on the radio
His wife's name was Mary
She died of a heart- attack last year
He has a daughter and a son, both grown with children of their own
'm afraid  don't know the names of the grandchildren
Tom looks down, not wanting to believe
What else do  know
Oh, yes know Uncle Charlie was trying to steer his favorite nephew away from a life of crime
Tom suddenly lunges for Jim
Ray yanks Tom back
Why'd you shoot him
Kill Charlie and you get to keep another share
No, That was an accident
Ken shot him
(eyes Kenny sadly) never told him Charlie was on my side
Ken liked to talk
(shakes head) He shouldn't've been here
But his dad asked me to watch over him guess  didn't do the best job
Excuse me, Jim
hate to interrupt and all, but could we just get the money and get the hell out of here
(nods; to Tom) 'm gonna ask you one more time
And before you think of bullshitting me again, keep in mind  have had a very frustrating night
And while know 'll never get the money if kill you, it's getting to the point where  just don't care
Jim casually aims his gun at Tom
'll tell you where it is
But it's not going to do you any good
Jim arches an eyebrow
The Guard may not be coming, but someone else sure as hell is
At the controls of his boat, moving fast, sprayed by rain
Karen and Phil are in the back of the boat
Wayne is close behind in his boat
'll take my chances
Tom pauses, looks over to
Just the top of it is visible
Two more  float nearby
There
Jim steers the ski-boat over, hands Tom a flashlight
Well, go get it
Tom climbs over the edge of the ski-boat and into the water
He turns on the flashlight and drops below the surface
(eyeing Tom in water) "At night we'd go down to the river and into the river we'd dive
" (off Jim and Mehlor's looks) Springsteen, "The River
" 'm all out of bible quotes
Tom shines his light on
One end of a rope is tied to the crypt
The other end, cut and frayed, is suspended in the water, waving in the current
Jim watches Tom's light rise
Tom comes up fast, takes a breath
It's gone
What
(smug) Looks like somebody beat you to it
Oh for Christs -- 'm gonna shoot him, Jim
Ray grabs pistol in his belt
Before he can pull it out, holes puff out of his chest, followed by blood and then the sound of the rifle-shots
Ray tumbles into the water
half- second later there's
Ripping into the ski-boat, water, trees, crypt
' , ' Are outside the fence, a hundred feet from the crypt on
To the rescue
He and Wayne and Phil fire their guns
Ducks underwater
Pulls his pistol, returns fire
Opens fire with a shotgun, shooting wild, yelling
Then he's hit and knocked out of the boat, dead
' Stop
You'll hit Tom
The Sheriff stops shooting, yells at the others
Hold your fire
Wayne and Phil stop shooting
Tom is holding onto a coffin, out of view of the Sheriff
He hears a rush of bubbles and turns as
Comes to the surface, breathing deep
' Comes out of the water fast and the barrel goes to Tom's forehead
' There's an adrenal fire in the Sheriff's eyes
He starts his boat forward, Wayne following
Their lights find
' No sign of life
Then there's a sound and the lights sweep over to find
Climbing up on top of the mostly-submerged crypt
Jim is behind Tom with his gun to Tom's head
Stops his boat
Wayne stops, too
They are thirty yards from Jim and Tom
look passes between them
(to Sheriff) Now, sir,  can imagine you'd love nothing more than to shoot me, but caution you -- in order to do that, you're gonna have to shoot through young Tom here
Thinks for a second, then shrugs
Okay
He raises his rifle
Realizes what is about to happen
Also clue in, but before they can move
Squeezes the trigger as
Hits the gun with her arm
Fires
is grazed in the arm by the bullet
Smacks Karen hard with his rifle and she tumbles out of the boat, unconscious
Throw themselves back off the crypt as
Empty their guns in their direction
Returns fire, shooting blindly over the top of the crypt
Reaches for Karen, floating limp in the water, but
Is closer
He grabs Karen and pulls her into his boat, then grins at Phil
Are behind the crypt
Tom holds his bleeding arm
Jim reloads
Well, that was unexpected
Is he the one you thought was coming to your rescue
No answer from Tom, but the answer is clear
The Sheriff and Wayne reload
(
) Anyone mind telling me what the hell is going on
The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil turn to see
In his boat, right behind them, all dressed up in hunting gear, rifle at the ready
Hey, Hank
That money  told you about
From the armored car
We're gonna keep it
Three million dollars
Four ways
(shoots at crypt) Seven fifty apiece
You okay with that
Hank is stunned
He doesn't answer
Hank
You okay with that
Seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars
(beat, grins) Damn straight 'm okay with that
(grumbling, re: Hank) Don't see what we needed him for
Then  guess you've never been hunting with Hank
(to Hank) We got two behind that crypt
Get 'em
Hank nods
He motions for Wayne to go one way; he'll go the other
They start off
blind shot comes from Jim behind the crypt
The Sheriff shoots back
Phil finally musters up the courage to say something
Maybe 'm not okay with it
Come on now, Phil
You're gonna kill people
They're looters, Phil
They come and steal from an armored truck in our town -- they're looters
(fires two shots) What about Tom
What about Karen
They're not looters
No, they're witnesses
The Sheriff fires off a flurry of bullets
Behind the crypt, bullets winging by
Jim looks over, sees
Motor into view
Opens fire
Shoots back
Flattens against the crypt, then turns to see
Coming into view on the other side
Looks at Jim, sees he's occupied in the fight with Hank
Then he sees
Floating in the water, dead, pistol still jammed in his pants
Thinks, decides, and reaches out for Ray
Shooting at Hank
He hears gunfire from Wayne and is about to swivel to shoot in that direction when he hears a gun firing from right next to him
He turns to see
Shooting back at Wayne with Ray's gun
Pulls back out of the line of fire
Curses and pulls back, too
Exchange a look
' How can you do this
Jeez, Phil,  always thought Wayne was the stupid one
Read my lips
(slowly) Three million dollars
Look at it
The Sheriff reaches down into a forward storage area of the boat and pulls back a tarp revealing the bags of money
couple of those bags are gonna be yours, Phil
But -- but -- you're the Sheriff
The Sheriff rips his badge off and throws it away
'm the what
Jim looks at Tom, then hands Tom his pistol
Tom doesn't know what Jim's doing
Jim slips beneath the water
Whistles and gets Wayne's attention
He motions Wayne to try it again
' For twenty years you've been -- For twenty years 've been eating shit, breakfast, lunch and dinner
Well, tonight 'm changing the menu
From now on everything  eat is gonna be shit-free
Tom is looking for Jim, to see what he's doing
And then
Come around on both sides
Starts shooting at them with the two pistols
Pull back
As they go
Sees
' Draped over the side of Wayne's boat
Takes another shot at Hank but stops firing at Wayne
' - Jim's hand appears over the gunwale
He reaches in and grabs
' And pulls it out of the boat
' Can  make it any clearer, Phil
Do you want me to draw pictures
Phil pulls out his revolver and points it at the Sheriff
can't let you do it
Oh for -- (beat) Okay, Phil
But here's how it's gonna go
'm gonna hear one of two things out of you
Either 'm gonna hear you say you're in with us, or
(moves close to Phil's gun) 'm gonna hear a bullet come out of that gun and go into me
Phil is incredulous
The Sheriff weighs his hands like scales
(one hand) Seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars or
(other hand) you kill me
Your choice
The Sheriff weighs the hands a couple more times
Phil slumps, lowers the gun
There we go
Flies through the air; lands in the water by the Sheriff
It's
' And it starts sinking in the water
Tom sees
Haul himself into the ski-boat
(
) In the boat
, Start shooting at Jim in the ski-boat
Sticks the shotgun over the gunwale and returns fire
Starts swimming for the boat
, See Tom and start shooting at both he and Jim when
' Explodes and
Erupts in a huge geyser
, , Are knocked off their feet
The Sheriff, Phil and Hank are thrown into the water
Their boats are rocked up and back and swamped with falling water
Fires up his engine
Is almost to the boat
Gets to his knees in his boat and starts shooting
Gets to Jim's boat and grabs onto it
Cranks the throttle, and, dragging Tom, tears off under the hail of Wayne's bullets
' As Jim races through the tombstones, barely missing halfsubmerged stone crosses and crypt roofs
Rams into one cross
Start to slip from the boat
Grabs Tom's hand and holds on as they shoot off across the water
, Get back in the boats
- Jim hauls Tom into the boat
Tom lays on the bottom, catching his breath
Blood is dripping down from his arm
(beat, looks up at Jim) You really want that money
Jim gives Tom a look -- of course he wants that money
'Cause the only way you're ever gonna see it is if you help me get Karen
Before Jim can answer, gunshots ring out behind them
They look back to see
Coming after them in the three boats, shooting, closing
We're too slow
(thinks, then:) Here
Jim moves away from the wheel, giving it to Tom
Tom gets up and takes over
Jim bends and picks up
Lifeless and limp
Looks at Kenny for a moment, then pushes his body overboard
Flying over the water
They see a body tumble out of the ski-boat
Jim looks back, following Kenny with his eyes
Jim and Tom make the turn onto Main Street
They look back as
Come around the corner, two hundred yards back
They're not going to catch us now
Of the ski-boat, racing toward camera
As it gets closer, the camera   underwater to reveal
The sword tip just below the surface
- There's a jarring metal on metal clank as the sword tip slams into the propeller
Are thrown forward
Slams head-first into the dash
The propeller has stopped
Looks back to see that
Has almost been ripped from its moorings
Okay, so maybe they are gonna catch us now
No answer from Jim
Tom looks down
Is laying on the deck, unconscious
Just then
Has his rifle resting on his boat's windshield and is firing off a clip on automatic as he, Wayne and the Sheriff close in
Ducks down and tries to start the engine
No go
Again
It catches on the third try
Tom guns it and the boat tears off
Is wobbling, vibrating
Keeps up his stream of gunfire
Stays down, driving blind, as the bullets fly in, blowing holes in the windshield
He looks at Jim, at the engine and curses
He steers the boat toward
All lit-up, brilliant white in the darkness, a quarter-mile away
The water is now over the sandbag wall
The first several feet of the church are flooded
- Comes up fast
Tom grounds it on top of the sandbag wall
Tom hesitates for a half second before grabbing Jim and pushing him out of the boat and into the water
Hits the cold water and comes to, sputtering
Grabs guns and ammo and jumps out of the boat and into the water
He lays a rifle on the top of the sandbag wall and fires off a clip
, Jim's bullets plug into their boats
They circle back
Tom pushes Jim, still groggy, into the flooded church
Tom shuts the door
He piles the weapons on a shelf
He sees Jim touch his head
That hurt
Yeah
Good
Wayne and Hank are alongside the Sheriff, engines idling as they look at the church
(nods, to Hank) Then go get some bottles
Hank nods, guns his engine
(to Hank) Wait -- what about the dam
It'll be fine
You said if it goes it'll wipe out the town
Fuck the town
Hank nods in agreement and takes off
Jim and Tom are by one of the stained glass windows, looking out through a pale-colored pane at the Sheriff and his men across the street
They watch Hank race off
Does he have the girl
(shakes head) She's in the small boat
Tom touches the wound on his head
Jesus, 'm gonna get hepatitis
Hepatitis, hell
You probably already got cholera
Tom gives Jim a look then starts for the back of the church
What're you doing
There's a back room
(touches wound) Maybe they've got something  can use on this
You been in here before
(bad memory) Oh, yeah
What happened
saw Jesus
Water is starting to go over the top again
It pours down in sheets over the face of the dam
Jim is by the window, looking out at the Sheriff and Wayne across the street in the shadows
He turns as
Enters from the back
He's got a bottle of rubbing alcohol and a towel
He splashes some of the alcohol on the towel, then touches it to his wound
It hurts like a sonofabitch
After a beat
So, has this all gone pretty much how you thought it would
Jim turns on Tom
Everything would have gone fine if you'd've just walked away from the truck
Oh, yeah
Well, everything would've gone even better if you hadn't decided to rob the damn truck in the first place
Jim looks away
After another silence
Did Charlie have cancer or something
You mean why was he doing this
(thinks, shrugs) No cancer
(beat) Didn't you ever think about taking the money
No
Come now
man who used to make his living fencing hot jackhammers never thought about what he'd do with three million dollars
Sorry to disappoint you
(beat) What are you gonna do with it
As little as possible
Silence for a few moments, then
Belize
Jim looks at him
It's this small country in Central America, on the Atlantic side
know where Belize is
What about it
They speak English and the dollar goes a long way
Beautiful beaches; friendly people
And they've got liberal banking laws
Very liberal
No, you didn't think about taking that money at all
(busted) You can't ride in the truck and not think about it
'm sure
And  guess that's pretty much how it started with Charlie
Tom thinks, nods and presses the towel to his wound again
Wayne is thinking about something
He makes a decision and flicks on his engine
What're you doing
We got too many bodies with bullets in 'em
(nods at Karen) 'm gonna put her in her house, make it look like she fell down the stairs and drowned
Don't you touch her
Saving her life
Hmm
You know, that might have actually gotten you laid
Oh, for Christsakes, just dump her here
We got a few minutes before Hank gets back
Just dump her here
Wayne ignores the Sheriff and motors off
Wayne
Goddamnit, we've gotta get them outta there
Wayne
But Wayne keeps going
Tom watches Wayne drive off with Karen
Shit
Where's he going
Tom grabs a rifle, frustrated and angry
Hank motors up to the Sheriff and Phil
Where's Wayne going
On a date
You all set
Yeah, but -- Then let's go
Aren't we gonna wait for Wayne
We can get started without him, the dumb shit
He won't be long
Besides, we got Phil
Phil's gonna earn his money on this, aren't you Phil
Phil looks scared shitless
Water continues to pour over the top Chunks of cement are starting to wash away
Tom finishes reloading a gun
What -- you're gonna swim after her
Tom doesn't answer
He moves toward the front door
Jim cuts him off
You ain't gonna help her by getting shot
He's gone and you don't know where
The Sheriff knows
think maybe 'll go ask him
You'll be dead before you get over the sandbags
(beat) Look, he'll be coming for us
You can ask him then
Jim sees something out the window
What if he doesn't come
wouldn't worry about that
Tom sees what Jim sees
The Sheriff, Phil and Hank are heading toward the church, flaming Molotov cocktails in their hands
The Sheriff, Phil and Hank heave the flaming Molotov cocktails
The bottles hit, explode
Sheets of fire rain down the roof
Smashes through a window
Tom and Jim duck down as
Flies across the inside of the church and smashes against a wall, sending sheets of fire down the wall
The roof is on fire
' Modest, two-story, on a side street
The front door is open; the boat tied up outside
There's a light on in the front hall
' Karen is unconscious
Wayne has her laying on the stairs leading up from the entry area to the second floor
There's three feet of water in the house
Karen's legs are in the water
Her hands are handcuffed to a railing attached to the wall, running up the stairs
Wayne stands over Karen, pats her face
Wakey-wakey
Karen stirs, then starts slipping back into unconsciousness, so Wayne splashes her face with water
Karen comes to, sputtering
Her eyes focus
She looks up at Wayne
Wayne grins
Dear Penthouse:  always thought your letters were fake, until the wildest thing happened to me
'm a policeman in a small town
In the middle of the big flood last year, was patrolling the streets in a boat, feeling kind of sorry for myself -- 'cause it was my birthday and all -- when  saw the front door to a house was open
pulled my gun -- afraid it might be looters
Imagine my surprise when, instead of a looter, find a young woman handcuffed to the railing of her stairs
Her name was Karen, and ever since she came back from college she'd made it clear she was too good for any of us local folk
Now here she was, in handcuffs
said, "What the heck is going on here, ma'am
" And she said
Karen says nothing
Wayne leans in close
And she said
Sorry, Wayne, but 'm not playing a part in your sick little play
Wayne pulls his gun, puts it to Karen's head
You're perfect for the role
suggest you reconsider
Or what
You'll kill me
You're gonna do that anyway
might get clumsy
It might take a while
'm sure you can hurt me
But it's all going to be the same when 'm dead
Wayne straightens up, looks at her, then launches back into it
And she said, "Happy Birthday, Wayne
've got something for you
" Well, 'm not stupid
knew what she wanted to give me and  knew she wanted to give it bad, so  -- Sparks and goes out
(looks up at light) That won't do
Man's gotta see what he's doing
'Scuse me
Wayne heads off for the kitchen
The second he's gone
Raises her hips and digs a hand into her pocket and pulls out her Swiss Army knife
She pries open the big blade
She hears Wayne sloshing back toward her
She gets back into the position Wayne left her in as
Re-enters carrying two burning candles in candle-holders
got the candles
All's we need is a cake
He sets the candles down on a dry step above Karen's head
He leans in close
Mood lighting
You in the mood yet
(no answer from Karen; back into Penthouse letter) And then she said, "My present's ready and waiting
All's you gotta do is unwrap it
" Wayne reaches into the water, undoes Karen's rain pants, yanks off her shoes, then pulls off her pants
He throws them over the banister
Karen remains passive, blank
Wayne takes off his holster; hangs it on the banister
Then he pushes his pants down to his ankles
His shirttail is long enough so that we don't have to see his wretched little pecker
He climbs on top of Karen in the water, brings his face close to hers
It was cold and rainy that birthday night, and all  wanted was to get someplace warm and dry
As it turned out, what  really wanted was something warm and wet
Wayne grins and closes for a kiss and
' Moves fast with the knife and
' Pop open wide
His head jerks back
He tries to shout, but all that comes out is an awful gurgle
He tries to push off Karen, but
Wraps her legs around him, holds him close, pinning him
Finally breaks free
He tries to stop the bleeding with a hand, but the blood spurts through his fingers
He reaches for his gun in his holster on the banister, but just as he grabs it
Lashes out of the water with her legs, kicking Wayne in the groin, pushing him back
Tries to get his balance, but his feet can't move -- his pants are around his ankles
He falls back into the water, firing his pistol
Blow chunks out of the wall next to Karen, hit the ceiling and
Is floating on his back, trying to lift the pistol, but his strength is fading fast
He gets off one last shot and
Nearest Karen is blown to pieces
The gun drops into the water
No more shots
No more life
He floats, pants around his ankles, covered in blood, dead
Happy Birthday, Wayne
The church roof is on fire
, Are across the street
Jim and Tom hear a creaking and look up
The fire has eaten holes in the roof
Embers come down
The Sheriff is getting very agitated
They're not coming out, Hank
The fire's not catching
The rain's too -- We have to get them
We have to kill them
Do you understand
If they're not dead, we got jack shit
small chunk of burning ceiling drops down
Jim and Tom look up
Just then
Floods into the church through
Filling the church with a kaleidoscope of colors
Look out the windows
My God they're beautiful
Remain beautiful for a few more seconds until they shatter and blow inwards as
'   ' Come crashing through
Land, stop fast
The Sheriff's boat lands closer to the pulpit; Hank's boat closer to the balcony
, Look around
It's quiet for a moment
There's no sign of Tom and Jim
' Karen has her pants back on
She reaches out with one foot and hooks Wayne's holster off the banister
She flips it through the air and catches it with her hands
She opens little leather pockets -- mace, more bullets
No keys
Karen starts to panic
There have to be keys
There -- She sees
Still floating on his back, still dead
She looks closer at
' Bunched around his ankles
And there, hanging from a belt- loop is a ring of keys
Reaches out with her foot for Wayne's pants
She can't reach
Is slowly drifting out the open door
Beyond the door, in the light of the streetlamp, the water is riffling, moving, and Wayne is heading toward it
Slides down further on the stairs, into the water, then stops
There are metal supports going from the railing to the wall, every three feet
Karen is prevented from going any further down the stairs by one of these supports
Reaches out with a foot, straining, stretching her body, almost dislocating her shoulder and
Just barely touches one of Wayne's feet, but then Wayne's foot slips away and
Can only watch as
Drifts out the door and is pulled away by the current
Water is cascading over the top of the dam
Chunks of concrete are washing away
The Sheriff, Phil and Wayne scan the water, looking for movement
Where are they
Jesus
Looking up through a tangle of floating pews at the wavering silhouettes of the boats and the men in them against the burning timbers above
Come into view, pointed up through the water
The Sheriff, Phil and Hank have let down their guard for a second when there's a series of dull, muted clacks from underwater as
Come streaking out of the water, winging by them, plugging into the boats
Jim fires the pistols, the bullets' bubble streaks knifing up through the water
, hit the deck in their boats, returning fire over the gunwales
Surfaces over by the stairs up to the balcony, gasping for air
He runs for the stairs
Start to fall from the burning roof frame, hitting the water with loud sizzling hisses
, Turn to shoot at tom through the dropping flaming debris
Disappears up the stairs, the bullets just missing him
Jim runs out of bullets
He's long since run out of air
He drops his guns and swims under the pews
Looks up, realizing that Tom will be able to shoot down on him
He reverses his boat fast under the balcony as
Shoots down from the balcony, blowing a chunk out of the prow of Hank's boat
' The water is up to Karen's chin
Her hands are working frantically beneath the water
She's using the tip of the knife blade to unscrew the screws holding the support to the railing
She's on the last one
The blade slips, misses, gets a quarter turn, another quarter turn
Spits out the water that spills into her mouth
Another quarter-turn and the screw is loose enough to turn by hand
Holds her breath with the water touching her nose
She gets the screw loose, pulls up on the railing and pulls the handcuff through the gap between the support and the railing
The Sheriff turns to Phil and nods re: Jim
You take care of him
The Sheriff aims at the balcony as Phil scans the water, looking for Jim
Jim pulls an electrical cord out of a wall socket
Tom ducks down as the Sheriff's bullets start plugging through the wood front of the balcony
Tom moves away from the bullet strikes, splashing through the water in the balcony
As    -- bullets start shooting up from below
Is firing up at Tom through the floor of the balcony
Jumps back, startled, looking down at
Holes explode in the floor, sending up small geysers of water
The water then starts whirlpooling down through the holes
Moves back from hank's advancing bullet holes
Keeps firing
Is caught between Hank's bullets and the Sheriff's bullets
So he racks a load in the shotgun and dives backwards off the balcony
Is still shooting up as
Arcs off the balcony, firing the shotgun under the balcony at Hank
Dives to the floor of his boat as Tom's shotgun blasts blow plate-sized holes in the church doors
Lands in the water and goes under
Look for Tom in the water
Starts to get up from the bottom of his boat, searching for a clip for his gun
Sees Tom's shape in the water and is about to shoot when
Jumps up out of the water with the electrical cord
He tosses a loop of the cord around the Sheriff's neck and pulls, yanking the Sheriff out of the boat
Comes out of the water, aiming his shotgun at
Who is aiming his pistol at Tom
Phil freezes
Struggle in the water
Jim pulls the cord tightly around the Sheriff's neck as the Sheriff tries to get a shot off at Jim -- he can't get the barrel pointed at Jim
Fumbles with the bullet clip
(to Phil) Kill him
Turns his shotgun on Hank and pulls the trigger -- click
Uh- oh
Kill him
Exchange a look
Slams the clip into his gun and levels it at Tom
Points his gun at Hank
No
We can't -- and hank shoots Phil
Phil pitches back out of the Sheriff's boat
Lands between Jim and the Sheriff, knocking them apart
Is free of Jim's grasp
He shakes off the electrical cord and turns to shoot
Who moves a little faster
He grabs Phil's pistol and puts it to the Sheriff's head before the Sheriff can bring his gun around
Draws a bead on Jim and is about to shoot when
Comes out of the water on the other side of Hank's boat
Tom pushes down hard on the side of the boat
Is rocked back, thrown off balance
He starts to spin and bring his gun around when
Swings with the shotgun, catching
In the side of the head
Hank crumples and falls into the water, taking his rifle with him
Jim nods at the Sheriff's rifle
In the boat
Hesitates, then tosses his rifle into the boat
Grabs Hank's rifle and aims it at the Sheriff
Where's Karen
' Karen undoes a last screw in a metal support
She pulls the handcuff through the gap between the support and railing
She's at the top of the stairs
Curves and goes into the wall
Tugs at the railing, tries rocking it up and down
It doesn't budge
She starts chipping at the plaster with the knife
God,  am really beginning to hate fine craftsmanship
It's up to her chest
The Sheriff hesitates
Where is she
They went back to her house
Where's her house
It's -- And just then they all hear something truly ominous -- a siren pierces the night
' She reacts to the siren -- uh-oh
The siren wails
What in God's name is that
Hank
(woozy but okay) It's topped out
How much time we got
How should  know
Guess
It's an old dam
Not long
(to Tom) Then 'd say you boys better drop your guns
What
That's the deal
You let me and Hank go -- with a few of these bags -- and 'll tell you where to find Karen
(to the Sheriff) Get out of the boat
Hold on
Jim turns to look at Tom
Hold on
It's the only way you're gonna find her
It's only a couple of bags
No
But  thought -- Look,  don't know what you thought but  told you, 'm here for the money; that's all
Tom doesn't know what to do
The Sheriff looks pretty pleased with himself
He might just get out of this
And then
(
) She lives on Boyd Street
They all look over at
Alive, but barely
Three over
Two-story, blue shutters
Looks at Jim, disappointed, angry, then hurries to Hank's boat
Climbs into the Sheriff's boat
Climbs into Hank's boat
He starts the engine, looks down at
Floating in the water, dying
brief look between them, then
Drives the boat out through a shattered window
Pushes the Sheriff out of the boat
large  is being cut in the top of the dam by the raging water
- Looking back at the dam
The line of lights on top of the dam start to fall over, then go dark, snuffed out by an unseen force
Jim keeps his gun leveled at the Sheriff and Hank, standing in the water, as he pulls the money bags up from the forward hold
So, you just gonna kill me
Lord knows  should
Jim opens a money bag and smiles at what he sees
' Karen tilts her head back to keep her lips and nose above water
And then she hears a window smash
She turns as
Wades in along the upper hall
'm guessing you can't get up
'm handcuffed
Tom reaches into the water for the railing
The railing's bolted to the wall
He looks at her
've got a saw
Where
In the kitchen
In the tall cupboard beside the -- And then they hear a sound more ominous than the siren -- they hear the siren stop
Is that good or bad
Jim, the Sheriff and Hank react to the silence
Jim looks off
Drops underwater
Turns back at the sound of the Sheriff going under
The Sheriff pulls up his pant leg
Is aiming his gun at the water and is about to fire as
' Comes out of the water shooting a pistol
Is shot in the gut and the thigh and high on the chest and he stumbles back, bellowing, and falls out of the Sheriff's boat and into the water
You should've just killed me
' You gotta go
Tom starts hyperventilating
The dam's gone
You gotta go
(shakes head) owe you one
Tom breathes deep then ducks underwater
Tom flicks on his flashlight and starts swimming down the stairs
Watches Tom and his light get swallowed up in the murky water
Phil is grabbing for the Sheriff's boat as the Sheriff and Hank zoom out of the church, leaving him behind
The Sheriff's boat comes onto Main Street, moving fast
Hank is looking back, in the direction the flood will come
We gotta go faster
Yeah, you're right
The Sheriff pushes Hank out of the boat
Goes skipping over the water and slams into a streetlight post
' Tom swims down into the living room
His light shows a couch, chairs,  set
Books and newspapers are suspended in the water
The damaged ski-boat that Jim and Tom took to the church has slipped off the sandbag wall and is drifting
peaceful scene
But then, from the distance, comes a rushing roar
Phil hears the roar
He looks around, lost
Hank, groggy in the water, also hears the distant roar
The roar is building, getting louder
Phil sees something in the water and reaches for it, frantically
He gets it
It's
And he clutches it to his chest as
Hits the church
'  - Tom swims into the kitchen
He looks for the tall cupboard by the fridge
He opens it
Hanging on a hook on the back wall is a saw
Tom grabs it
Hank unwraps himself from around the lamp post
He looks back
Streetlights in the distance, winking out one by one, marking the advance of the wall of water
Oh my God
Hank looks around for safety
He sees it
There's an alleyway
Swims for the alley
Roars through the town, pushing a rolling wave of debris, obliterating anything in its path
Hank swims into the alley
Hank looks for something to climb up on, to hold onto
There's
At the end of the alley
Swims for it
He hears the rushing roar of the advancing flood
He expects the flood to blow by the end of the alley
Wrong
Comes into the alley, banking high on the far wall before coming down and barreling toward Hank
And what makes it worse for Hank is that there's
At the front of the wave, being pushed by the water
Dives clear just as
Smashes into the wall, right where Hank had just been
Relief in his eyes
He gets to the fire escape and is climbing to safety when
Comes into the alley, rolling in the flood, spraying propane from a torn hose
It explodes
Barely has time to scream
'  - Tom is threading his belt through the handle of the saw to secure it
He gets it done and starts to swim out of the kitchen
Just Karen's lips and nose are above water
Tom is about to leave when everything starts to move -- rocking, from side to side, as if in a slow motion earthquake
Cupboards and the fridge open and bottles and food and plates tumble out
' The house has been hit by the flood
It's being pulled by the massive current, stretching overhead phone and power lines
' Karen hears the groaning, ripping as the house tears free from water and sewer lines
She's looking down for Tom when there's a snap and the light above her goes out
' The house is carried on the current, turning in the water
Tom watches, astounded, as the room starts to turn around him
He kicks fast for the door to
Tom swims in, fast, toward the stairs when
Caves in and
Smashes in, filling the room, blocking Tom's route to the stairs
Tries to get through the tangle of branches and leaves, but can't
He swims over to another window and slides it up
Keeps looking down for Tom
' The house is impaled on a tree, the current sluicing around it
Surfaces near the side of the house, gasping
The current starts ripping him past the house
He swims as hard as he can back to the house, reaches out and grabs onto a gutter
' Karen doesn't have much time left
The water is washing over her mouth and nose
And just as she's about to go under
Swims in with the saw
He starts sawing on the handrail
Everything's going fine
And then
Snaps
Look at each other
Oh no
Karen's going under
Sees something
He dives into the water
Can only watch and wait
What's he doing
Oh, Jesus
And then
Surfaces, holding Wayne's pistol
He puts the mouth of the barrel to the handcuff chain, shields Karen's face, looks away and pulls the trigger
The water swirls through the branches of a half-submerged tree
Are in the tree
Henry is either unconscious or dead
Doreen cradles him
Come on, Henry
Forget that "Go to the light" crap
Come back to me
You're all 've got
And Henry starts to come to
Oh, Henry
Thank God
Henry opens his eyes
Next time, when  say "Let's evacuate," we're gonna evacuate
Whatever you say, honey
She hugs him tight and after a beat he hugs her back
' Tom and Karen swim out of a second floor window, grab the rain gutter
Tom pulls himself onto the roof then grabs Karen and helps her up
They crawl until they're clear of the edge
Only the sloped roof of the house is visible in the swirling water
They are just catching their breath when they are hit by
And they look to see
In his boat, shining a searchlight on them with one hand, a gun in the other
He starts shooting
Tom pushes Karen toward the peak of the roof as the bullets plug in around them
Tom pushes Karen over the top then turns and dives off the roof and into the water
Hears an engine behind her and turns
Racing toward the house
It's
- And at the controls is
Barely alive
Is wobbling, vibrating at the back of the boat, almost loose from its moorings
' He sees Karen, crouched below the peak of the house, a bright light coming from the other side along with gunshots
Pushes the throttle all the way forward
- Shoots forward
Tom swims hard toward the Sheriff's boat
Is shooting down into the water at Tom's moving shape
- With Jim at the wheel, comes racing straight toward the house
Thinks he's going to turn
No
No
- Doesn't turn
Rolls to the side, just getting clear as
- Hits the sloping roof of Karen's house and ramps up it
Digs into the shingles of the roof and tears free from the back of the boat
Hears the sound and looks up as
- Comes over the peak of the roof
Surfaces to see
- Fly right over him, heading straight for
Who ducks down, just in time as
- Misses him, landing just past him in the water
Straightens up, grinning with glee that the boat missed him
And then he hears a piercing whine coming from behind him
He turns, just in time to see
Flipping end over end, propeller whirring, heading straight for him
Starts to scream
Looking over the peak of the roof in horror
She hears the Sheriff's scream and the scream of the propeller and then a horrible ugly ripping and both screams stop
' The Sheriff is gone
The side has been smashed out of the boat and the boat is flooding with water
Is just some misshapen thing trailing red, floating in the water
Tries to restart the ski-boat but it's dead
He slumps forward
Sees Jim slump against the side of the boat
You okay
Fine
Tom can tell Jim's anything but
Tom swims for the boat
Tom swims up, pulls himself in
He pulls Jim back off the controls, sees the blood
Oh, God
We gotta get you to -- Jim looks at Tom
Tom understands -- Jim's not going anywhere
Thanks
For what
You just saved our lives
did
just came for the money
Tom looks at Jim -- he knows Jim's lying
(
) Do you need any help
(grabs Tom's arm) No
Tell her to stay back
(to Karen) It's okay
Jim lets go of Tom
You're going to turn it in
Sorry to disappoint you
Well, hell, then  guess  better take it after all
figure the river'll carry me down to the Gulf of Mexico
If  catch the right currents, maybe 'll end up in
Belize
(Tom nods) You come look me up
'll buy you a drink
'll do that
Jim grimaces as he's hit by a wave of pain
He looks away
Go
Tom hesitates for a second
Please
Tom turns and slides into the water and swims away
Son, don't think too badly of your Uncle Charlie
He always said you were capable of remarkable things
(beat) He was right
There's a last look between Jim and Tom, then Tom swims away
(smiles) The rain's stopped
(breathes deep) The air after a rain
Jim slowly topples forward and is still
Swims through the swirling current toward Karen's roof
' Sinks below the surface and is gone
Karen is down at the water's edge with her arm extended to Tom
Tom grabs it, and as Karen pulls
: - Karen pulls Tom up onto scaffolding running along the edge of the new roof under construction
Tom holds a paper bag
He's wearing work gear -- tool belt, work boots, etc
Tom looks at the work being done on the roof
They got a lot done today
It's coming along
(re: bag) What'd you get
Barbecue chicken from Lilly's
Yum
You want some
wish you'd told me
woulda got more
Ha ha
And as they sit down and start to eat, the camera begins to talked to Mikey
He says the flooring should be in by Friday
That's what he said last week
said if it wasn't here by Friday at six that you were going to go over and beat the crap out of him
And  will
