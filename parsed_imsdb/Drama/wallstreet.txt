4/23/87 - The most famous third of a mile in the world
Towering landmark structures nearly blot out the dreary grey flannel sky
The morning rush hour crowds swarm through the dark, narrow streets like mice in a maze, all in pursuit of one thing:
- We hear the  of the trains pulling out of the station
Blurred faces, bodies, suits, hats, attache cases float into view pressed like sardines against the sides of a door which now open, releasing an outward velocity of anger and greed, one of them
- The bubbling mass charges up the stairs
Steam rises from a grating, shapes merging into the crowd
Past the , the insane   with 12 cats and 20 shopping bags huddled in the corner of Trinity Church
Bud the Fox straggling behind, in a crumpled raincoat, tie askew, young, very young, his bleary face buried in a Wall Street Journal, folded, 'subway style', as he crosses the street against the light
Why Fox
Why didn't you buy
schmuck
car honks, swerving past
- Cavernous modern lobby
Bodies cramming into elevators
Bud, stuffing the newspaper into his coat, jams in
- Blank faces stare ahead, each lost in private thoughts, Bud again mouthing the thought, "stupid schmuck", his eyes catching a blond executive who quickly flicks her eyes away
Paranoia in the elevator
We quickly cut into private lives
(
) he'll sue me, could be for 5-6 million, and he'll get a million, the house, they'll impound my paychecks
damn, damn, why did sign that contract
(
) gotta get Lola in the sack man, take her to the Garden for the Terrells, Jimmy give me the tickets for 12 bucks,  pull the midnight shift,  could do 60 bucks
wow, check those legs out
His eyes on the same blonde exec who looks away, self- conscious about her legs
The elevator stops at a floor, discards only one person
The doors close a little too slowly
(
) jerk
(shifts her thoughts) call Hanratty
The decimal points on the code are uncalibrated
Hoskins
The signatures on the bank draft
Boyle, that bitch
insurance
tax form
Shit, talk to Kahn
(recalling) That's Hanratty, Hoskins, Bank, Boyle and Kahn
H2B2K - shoot, insurance and theatre tix
H2B2K,, -- and the cleaners
repeat
Catching the eyes of Bud Fox once again wandering to her
Camera moving to Bud who looks away
(
) sorry, what a fox
funny, the most beautiful girls in the world are always on the street or in elevators, never get to talk to them, shy
my looks, never had confidence in them
overcompensating work syndrome
prove your worth with money
'cept 'm not making any money
(pause, the elevator at another floor, slow) wonder what all these people are thinking about
Camera moving slowly again over the eyes
The silence of individual tension reigns over all
(
) Screw him
'll destroy that sonufabitch
he thinks he can break a contract with me he's got something to learn
(
) 9:15
he'll kill me this time, he will really kill me
oh come on elevator
why do you stop on every floor
As the elevator stops again to disgorge two people
(
) (pissed now at the elevator) come on man, time is money man
One floor here  could do eleven blocks
(
) H2B2K,,,,,,T2
(pause, she looks like she forgot something) (
) goddamn elevators
people, too many goddamn people in this world
The elevator finally comes to a slow stop
They wait, plead, beg, screech with the eyes
The door at last opens
None of them acknowledging each other, they all stampede out the door with an audible gasp of release, a collective sign akin to making it to a urinal after a punishing wait
The elevator tension is over, but the killer grind continues
,    - Credits continue to run
Bud moves past the functional reception area, past , a cheerful young black girl
How you doing Buddy
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin
He slips off his overcoat, flicks some lint off his Paul Stuart $500 suit, and enters the main trading room
Brokers mill by their desks, gulping coffee, scanning the papers, the quotrons
The digital clock by the big board counter clicks to 9:26 am -- four minutes until the market opens
You can smell the hunger
Bud takes a deep breath, tosses the newspaper away and struts into the office -- fuck it -- it's a new day
past  , a flush-faced old-timer, a blue and white Yale tie, with a carnation in his lapel
Morning, Dan
What's looking good today
If  know  wouldn't be in this business
Get out while you're young, kid
came here one day, sat down, and look at me now
Past  , on the phone, a handsome chunk of man with rugged good looks and Ivy League mannerisms
hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer
still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal
if  had your looks, better
(used to it) takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education
and the right tailor
not that you learned anything, Chunk
Bud reaches his trading desk, whips open his briefcase and pulls out a computer print-out of last night's homework
gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv
(
) Yeah, where's your machine gun
Joke about it
was up all night charting these stocks
You want to see this or what
His associate, , a manicky wise-guy, swivels over his chair from a nearby desk
He gives the charts a quick read
(scowling) Looks bearish to me, buddy
You got it all upside down
(confidential) Okay, 'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause  feel sorry for you
Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest
Thanks, Marv, with that  might be able to qualify for welfare
, strolls in, a dignified looking older broker in his late 60's, wearing an old brown brim hat with button down white shirt, narrow tie, very much a picture from another era
a kind humor in his eyes
but obviously ailing in the legs and breath department
(friendly) You got a look in your eye, Mr
Mannheim
You got something for the small fry
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around
too much cheap money sloshing around the world
The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard
Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it
Take 5 years for that company to turn around
but they got a good new drug
Stick to the fundamentals, that's how  and Hilton were built
good things sometimes take time
The stentorian voice of booms over the intercom
We see him peering from behind the glass partition in hit office; tall, balding with a perpetual worried look on his face
Attention
Please
Office Production is down ten percent this week recommend that you all go through your clients' investments for any portfolio adjustments
And don't forget -- double commissions today on our '' or better bond funds
(looking in Bud and Marv's direction) Especially you rookies
Also, remember, the sales contest ends tomorrow
Bud and Marvin roll their eyes
The digital clock flashes 9:30
The  close
And they're off and running
The room rises to a subtle but new energy level with the clatter of the ticker, speakers, teletype machines, newsprinters' Dow Jones and Reuters, phones ringing off the hook
Brokers are shouting orders, running for tickets, dodging each other; it's a controlled riot
Here's a hot lead
Have  got one for you
sell
dump it all
500 at an eighth, an eighth
July fifties
April thirties
how bout those Decembers
You see where they're going
Morgan is selling a billion one at the close
Yeah
That's right, they're selling all over the place
we're still long on the treasuries -- $110 million
What about the Japs
Where am
(confused at all the phone lights) We gotta lot of lights here
Let's pick 'em up
(on phone) Jack, take 50 Gulf, with a 3/8 top, forget the hundred
What about Delroy
can go long at 23, let's go long
Conwest Air -- let me check it
He looks up at the
stock quotes whizzing by
(
') Up an eighth
How many you want
It's on the floor
He writes the order up
shot of   yawning as he half-listens to his customer, resting the phone on his kneecaps
: It's 2
30 p
m
We hear the relentless clatter of the board ticker, and the drone of disembodied voices, blarihg market information out of squawk boxes
Bud's desk is now cluttered with order tickets, literature, crumpled notes, beverage cups and a half-eaten sandwich
He's on the phone and from the look on his face, the caller on the other end is breaking his balls
Marvin paces past, making a dramatic phone pitch
Dr
Beltzer has to have his information this minute
It concerns his future
Bud waves Marvin away, answers his caller, trying to keep cool, worried how as he sees Lynch, the office manager, coming over
Hey Howard,  thought you were a gentleman
Sure it's gone down a little bit, but you got the tip from your printer,  didn't
Yeah you did
That's what you said
(heated) didn't tell you to buy it, why would  tell you to sell it
(screaming) No,  can't give it back
Give it back to who
You own it
(beat) No, he's out right now
As he looks up and winks at Lynch, standing over him
(cupping the receiver) That's what you told us to say
Give me that phone
(takes receiver) Yes, sir, this is the manager
What seems to be the problem
(into his phone) What
Well, how was  to know you were in surgery
What am Marvin the mind reader here
Bud whispers, tensely
Lynch listens
He's lying
Okay, sir
'll discuss this with the broker and 'll get back to you
You're welcome
Lynce hangs up and glares at Bud
If 'm closing out this account
If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it
Mr
Lynch,  swear to you, he's lying
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales
don't think you're being fair, sir
You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history
Somebody has to pay for that error
And it's not me
Lynch walks off
Bud does some quick calculations in his head
(reappearing) Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today
(devastated) Howard the Jerk reneged on me
've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand
'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me
Hey, things could be worse
It could've been my money
Let me help you out, rookie
He takes out his wallet and loans Bud a hundred bucks
Thanks Marv, 'll make it good to you
(fervently) You know what my dream is
One day to be on the other end of that phone
Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is
You forgetting something
Marvin points up at the clock
Bud looks up
it's 2:40
Bud quickly composes himself
He picks up the phone, dialing purposefully
(') Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers heard this story about Gekko
he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling stocks short
Hello, Natalie -- guess who
That's right, and you know everyday  say to myself, today could be the day
So what do you say
will you marry me
Then please can you get me through to Mr
Gekko
(coaching) It concerns his future
Of course he's busy, and so am
Five minutes
That's all 'm asking
know that if he could only hear what  have to say
it would change his life
- , a classy attractive Englishwoman is on the phone with Bud, somewhat amused by his manner
She is the personal secretary to multimillionaire, Wall Street trader and raider, Gordon Gekko
His windows look out on a panoramic view of the city and East River
Mr
Fox, 've told you before, 'm sure you're a good broker, but our traders talk to the brokers, Mr
Gekko only deals with investment bankers
Yes,  shall give him your message
As they're speaking, another  leads two well-heeled past her desk
As she opens the door to the inner office and ushers them inside, we catch a glimpse of a figure, pacing back and forth, talking animatedly on the phone by the huge corner window
We hear a deafening  as we: : '    -    - In the background, a 747 ascends into the night sky, climbing over the roof tops of weathered brick tract houses
Bud, coat collar pulled up against the wind, crosses the street, entering a neighborhood bar
We see an old maroon Honda behind him
' - Dimly-lit, noisy, blue-collar airline bar
Machinists and mechanics still in their overalls at the bar, drinking, watching   , on
Bud searches the crowd group of middle-aged men wave him over, insignias on the pockets
, a rugged, chain- smoking ex-Marine Sergeant, and  , a big strong Italian greet Buddy as he comes over
Buddy boy, how ya doing
Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin
(slapping Bud) hear all you guys on Wall Street are millionaires, when you gonna make us rich
Gotta open an account to win the lottery, Dominick
Give me 15,000, you'll have a condo in Florida next Christmas
sure and we'll own the airline
If he makes anybody rich, let him make himself rich, so's he can pay off his school loans
As he signs an unemployment insurance form for one of his men
nice to see you in such a good mood Dad, what'd Mom do, give you fish for dinner
You're smoking too much, how many times do you gotta go to the hospital to
Carl, inhaling his cigarette, grimaces formidably, terminating the subject
leave me alone willya
Only thing makes me feel good anymore
Spaghetti
She makes lousy spaghetti
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date
Bud sitting down next to him, pats him around the shoulder
Dad, a sarcastic and gruff edge to him, makes a faint smile
He has a genuine affection and pride in his somewhat glamorous son
so am
Whaddaya want, a beer
(to waitress) Hey Billie, bring another for the kid, he looks good, doesn't he
Dominick and Charlie go off
pause
Father and son sizing each other up with a look
looks like you grown another inch
but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me
Ah,  had a tough day
Some jerk 'd me and  gotta cover his loss
Speak English will ya
-- didn't know -- who  was when the options he bought took a bath
He reneged on me
(nods, satisfied) told you not to go into that racket
You could've been a doctor or a lawyer, Coulda been a contender
(
) you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman
(an old story between them) Look Dad, 'm not a salesman
How many times  gotta tell you 'm an account executive, and pretty soon 'm going to the investment banking side of the firm
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right
You're a salesman
(ticked) Dad, it takes time
You gotta build a customer list
'm doing it could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline
don't get it, you get a scholarship to , you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it
50  don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more pay 40% in taxes,  got a rent of 15,000,  got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month,  need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in
$50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker

It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room-- gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad
There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know
One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see
(hurting) (sees it) It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need
(beat) Can you spare three hundred
Pay you back next month, promise
Dad reaches into his pocket, looks at his cash
It hurts
Got a 100 on me, you
(embarrassed) Not in here Dad

Later
Dad shrugs, puts it away
it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there
Your brother never
(cuts off when he sees Buddy's face) well,  always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow
(changes subject) How's Mom
Another man comes over with a bandage around his head and a compensation form for Carl to sign
("Hey, chief")
(with affection) same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much
gonna take her to Florida next month
west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it
Work okay
(lights another cigarette, grimaces) this drug testing is driving my guys nuts
got flagged for my blood pressure pills
The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff
'member that crash last summer
and the investigation
Well, the  is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism
kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati
And  was right
He gives the signed form back to the injured man
(Carl: "Okay, Frank") That's great Dad
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension
We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need
We're gonna compete with the big boys now
(boasts) Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all can advise is hold on to that stock Dad
They drink
Bud reflects a moment
You sure about this  announcement
About what
The  announcement
Sure 'm sure
Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes
You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that
Bud's mind racing elsewhere
'  -    - cramped studio facing an air shaft with bars on the window
Moving across to the sound of the radio alarm going off and the glib tones of a rock
announcing the Met's latest streak
The walls are papered with stock analyses and graphs, print out pages strewn across the floor
No other semblance of a personal life except clothes haphazardly tossed, Barron's and Fortune magazines
's back is all we see, sleeping naked on the bed
Close on Bud's  computer -- his appointment calendar
Bud focusing on an underlined notation:
's
Bud stares at the clock: 4 a
m
He picks up a prospectus for a chemical company, starts reading
- Bud, crossing lower Broadway, enters a magnificent towering glass structure
- , Gekko's British secretary, is completing shorthand notes as the intercom buzzes
logo for " &
is behind her
(off) have a delivery here for Mr
Gekko
It's a personal item and the gentleman says you have to sign for it
(frowning) all right, send him in
- Bud, somewhat nervous, is led down an impressive hallway hung with expensive modern art
past a huge Calder mobile and a pool of some 15 traders on phones, quotron terminals and keyboards
into Natalie's outer office
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice
'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me
(recognizing the voice) What are you doing here
And you're even lovelier than pictured
brought a birthday present for Mr
Gekko
First of all, Mr
Fox, you can't just come barging in here
And what makes you think it's his birthday
Bud takes out an old crumpled Fortune magazine cover of Gordon Gekko, entitled "Gekko the Great
" It's in the bible, see
You better go buy him a present
Please, Natalie
Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get
(sighs) Stay here, 'll see what  can do
She takes the gift and enters Gekko's office
Bud paces nervously
Natalie re-appears, stern, but a note of compromise in her voice
Wait outside
-    - Bud on the courtesy phone, hangs up, looks nervously at his watch
Almost 12
He's lost some two hours of business
Natalie suddenly comes out, without a smile
Five minutes
Bud brightens, pumping himself in the mirror, muttering
(to Natalie) Well
life all comes down to a few moments, and this is one of 'em
He follows Natalie
'  (' ) - Furnishings in hypermodern gray and black lacquer, Modern Art ranging from black field paintings by Ad Reinhardt to the smashed dishes of Julian Schnabel
Nautilus equipment, hi-tech gadgets are in evidence, including a splendid Howard Miller World Time Clock, and a world map
Three of Gekko's people, young 's dressed for success, are scattered about the room, on phones, calculators, coming in and out
aka Gekko the Great as the media calls him, dressed in a custom English suit, paces on the phone with the restlessness of a caged tiger, a 50-foot extension cord attached to his blinking 130 line silver-plated telephone
On his ears is a headset
He is carrying on overlapping conversations with a myriad of bankers, partners and lawyers; pausing to issue commands to his aides while keeping his eye on the stock prides spitting across a bank of quotron monitors, carrying everything from New York Exchanges to London, commodities, gold, and currency values
second Secretary and sometimes Natalie exit and enter with various messages written on a piece of paper, indicating a waiting party on the phone
Gekko often shakes his head "no"
(on phone) what the hell is going on just saw 200,000 shares move, are we part of it, we better be, pal, or 'm gonna eat your lunch for you
get on 1
(switches lines) Sorry, love it at forty
It's an insult at fifty
Their analysts don't know preferred stock from livestock
(a beat, mischievous smile) wait for it to head south, then we'll raise the sperm count on the deal
right
Get back to me
(to Alex, an aide listening an the other line) This is the kid that's called me 59 days in a row
Wants to be a player (to Bud) There oughta be a picture of you in the dictionary under persistence
(back to phone) Look, Jerry, 'm looking for negative control, no more than 30 to 35%, just enouqh to block anybody else's merger plans and find out from the inside if the books are cooked
If it looks as good as on paper, we're in the kill zone
We lock and load pal
get on 3
, a tall handsome Frenchman, jots a note and follows Gordon over to line 3
Gekko's dark intent eyes fixing briefly on Bud who stands waiting in the corner
He motions him to sit
(new line) Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer
No, not interested
(eyes an Quotron, to Ollie, a trader) Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon
Get me that California retirement money, baby
And we're on our way
You got it,
, a gigantic 200 pound man wearing pink suspenders, rises and walks to another phone, past Bud
(back on line with Billy, listening) check the arbs for MacDonald's
Yeah, 'm having a Mac attack
20,000 shares
For about 30 minutes
Lunch
Are you joking -- lunch is for wimps
Get back to me
(to Alex) 4
Bud's eyes on the framed "tombstones" from the Wall Street Journal commemorating Gekko's successful deals; they hang like scalps from the walls
Gekko's eyes drifting to Bud, a friendly easy smile for a flick of an instant, he has genuine charm in his manner and though ultrafast verbally, projects calm and confidence at the center
man who obviously loves what he does, to some small degree is flashing his stuff for the outsider
(line 4) Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation
Go slow
Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya
We feint towards it but we wait
What about tipping off Yurovich
(grimaces) If  ever need surgery, get me the heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's never been used
Happy Holideals Harold
Hangs up, eyes to Bud
His headset comes off
(nervous) How do you do Mr
Gekko
'm Bud Fox
So you say
Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent
Like these, how'd you get these
(indicating cigars) (tries a smile, awkward) got a connection at the airport
Gekko notes the answer, wrapping the cuff of a state-of-the- art, automatic blood pressure monitor around his arm and starts pumping it up
His aides continue on the phones
So what s on your mind kimosabe
Why am  listening to you
Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me
Oh no, no
(demonstrating it) Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure
Has an readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor
just want to let you know Mr
Gekko  read all about you at Business, and  think you're an incredible genius and 've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you
(smiles, impatient with the speech) So what firm you with, pal
Jackson, Steinem
(nods) going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal
Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff
(fishing) cosmetics company by any chance
What are you, the 12th man on the deal team
The last to know
(smiles) Can't tell you that, Mr
Gekko
So whatta you got for me, sport
Why are you here
Bud opens his attache case and rifles out a handful of briefs
Gekko noting the blood pressure reading and taking the cuff off his arm
Ollie, the big trader, ambles back in, says something to the third aide, a young intelligent- looking woman
Chart break-out on this one here
uh Whitewood-Young Industries
low
Explosive earnings
30% discount from book
Great cash flow
Coupla 5% holders
Strong management
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport
Mr
Stevenson in San Fransisco
Gekko takes the call, cutting Bud off
He respond to the offer
What
What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money
if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead
Well Christmas is over and business is business
(simultaneous to Ollie) Keep buying
Dilute the sonofabitch
Ollie  want every orifice in his body flowing red
(laughs, on the phone) He's flowing, Gordo
Piece of cake
Gekko hanging up and buzzing an aide
Throws out an aside to Bud
doesn't look like it but the best trader on the street
(to Susan) Sue get the  analysis on Teldar Paper and bring it here
what else
Bud shifting, uncomfortable as Gekko finally swivels his attention back to him
(coming right back) Tarafly
Analysts don't like it do
The breakup value is twice the market price
The deal finances itself
Sell off two divisions, keep
Aiex, knowing the stock, sneers, shares a look with Gekko who looks up at Bud with the first sign of interest
(laughs) Not bad for a quant, but a dog with different fleas
(checks his hi-tech watch) Come on, tell me something  don't know
It's my birthday, pal, surprise me
As he opens a birthday card and feeds it into the that sits next to his desk over the waste basket
The sound it makes is soft and menacing
Buddy knows its fourth down and long, Gekko's attention is shifting to the quotron
In frustration, Bud blurts it out
(standing) Bluestar Airlines
The camera moves on him now, sudden, more intense, in a sense trapping him
rings a bell somewhere
So what
comer
80 medium-body jets
300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes
great slots in major cities
don't like airlines, lousy unions
There was a crash last year
They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit
Even the plaintiffs don't know
Gekko looks up, remotely interested
How do you know
(hesitates, concerned) know
the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts
There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it
Good for a five point pop
Ollie comes back in, as excited as he ever will get under his rolls of flesh, his voice deadpan
just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think 'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions
We got close to half a million shares in the bag
Hey, the Terminator
Blow 'em away Ollie
And, 'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and 'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada
Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor
(to Bud) Interesting
You got a card
Buddy thrusts a card into his hands
Gekko glances at it
My home number's on the back
(smiles, looks at card) Bud Fox,  look at a hundred ideas a day
choose one
Bud stuffs his notes back into the briefcase, hoping for a word of encouragement in the awkward silence
Well, hope to hear from you, sir
He turns and heads out the door, still shaken by the revelation he has made passing Susan who hurries in with a dossier
Gekko glances at it
As Bud leaves, he overhears: (off) gang, looks like we're going over 5% in Teldar, start the lawyers on a tender offer and 13D, we keep going after everything in sight but don't pay over $22
They're gonna fight, they got Myers and Thromberg doing their legal, they make Nazis look like nice guys
'  - Bud walks glumly past Natalie, certain that he's blown it
She's busy on the phone
thanks Natalie
(buzzing inside, preoccupied) have a nice day Mr
Stone
(wrong name, doesn't notice, to Gekko on phone) Mr
Gekko, the conference call is ready
Mr
Sugarman and Mr
Lorenzo in Delaware
Mr
Bernard in Los Angeles
Mr
Jackson and Ms
Rosco in London
They're all on
The phone call goes behind closed doors
Bud walks out, dejected
'  - Bud comes in, distracted, punches into his quatron
Teldar Paper comes up
(comes over) well, see him
(mind on the computer) Yeah, but he didn't see me
Cheer up buddy buddy
You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers
He's not the only elephant in the jungle
:
The quotron
Bud's eyes
Thinking to buy
(looks) got something from him
Teldar Paper
Bud wipes it off the screen, his mind made up, dismissing the temptation to buy
a dog with fleas
Lynch, the manager, stalks past with some telexes
Where you been the last 3 hours, Fox
wouldn't be sitting around chin wagging if  were you
plenty of names in that phone book to cold call
Marvin gives Lynch the Italian salute, behind his back
Grudgingly, Buddy flips open the massive New York phone book
got tickets for the Knicks tonight
Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say
(shakes his head) gotta read my reports
Forget charts
We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em
'm offering you the Knicks and chicks
God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there
Their eyes briefly on  , red faced, desperately trying to make a sale on the telephone, hangs up defeated
preferably Lou Mannheim
Their eyes briefly on  , in his private office, sitting there slumped, thinking, smoking as he watches the quotron
Nice guy but a loser
Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71
you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching
Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks
Cindy
Susan
Cindy
Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back
'Sides this  crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an  dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune
gotta get to work
's today
(hitting the phone with the directory) The pool , , calls out
Call for you Buddy
(taking it) Bud Fox
Bud rears up in his seat
change
Marvin notices
-  - Gekko talks into his speaker phone, gazing out the window
Alright Bud Fox
buy me twenty thousand shares of Bluestar
No more than 15 1/8, 3/8 tops, and don't screw it up sport
'  - The camera tracks around and in on him climactically as the Music Theme rises to ensnare him
We end close on Bud
Dumbstruck
Yes, sir
Thank you
You won't regret it
He hangs up, stunned still, rises from his chair, unbuttons his collar and feverishly starts writing the ticket
Got a little action there, eh buddy
Marv, (turns triumphant) just bagged the elephant
- The upper West Side
The young, the rich and the restless parade along the avenue, jamming the neighborhood restaurants and bars
Bud glides along, feeling a part of the crowd now, past a dreadlocked  swigging Thunderbird and shouting obscenities, shaking a wooden African spear
/ - Inside a glitzy neighborhood singles bar in which Bud stops, everybody seems to be young and drinking margueritas
Bud orders a beer, surveying the room like a veteran, overhearing the conversation of a   to two other broker types
you know Marty Wyndham
He netted $650,000 out of that merger
26 years old, the guy's Rambo
Got himself a Porsche Turbo Cabriolet about 75 thou, got a house in Westhampton, penthouse on Second Avenue, gets up at 2:30 in the morning, he's in the office at 4
guy never sleeps
Rambo genes
He blathers on as Bud surveys the room, noticing an with a striking aloof beauty, very much the debutante dream Grace Kelly type, so refined that you wonder what she could possibly be doing out at night in public alone
Bud summons his courage, catches his breath, makes his way over
She sees him approach, obviously doesn't wish to talk, eyes darting elsewhere like a nervous deer
(awkward) Hi
can  buy you a drink
'm celebrating tonight
(disdainful) Please, no thanks
(looking away) Look,  know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but 'm different,  never talk to strangers, all my life 've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room
you're that person, you don't know it but  do and if you walk away now 'll never see you again or you me
You'll grow old
Oh really
(') 'll grow old
We'll both die
And we'll never have known each other
That's sad
At least one drink for a dreamer
What's your favorite drink
She looks at him, not quite sure
Is he serious or glib
(uncommitted) Grand Marnier
Sounds like a french word, what is it
It's a romantic and tragic drink
Sounds tempting
prefer mine with a twist of fate
You know like us meeting
Don't go away
Maybe, just maybe she's his
His eyes show it as he hurries back to the bar to order
As he gets the bartender's attention, he turns and sees that she is joined by a  who looks as if he stepped out of the pages of
Together they walk away
Stung, Bud watches as the woman of his dreams disappears out the door
What do you want
just lost it
-  () Bud and a  he's obviously just picked up, are struggling to be seen in a mass of people trying to get in the hottest new club in Manhattan
Bud easing forward along the ropes to a large  who roughly pushes one of the bridge-and- tunnel kids back across the rope
Joe discreetly shows him $50 but they guy says: "No room
," humiliating him in front of his date
The bouncer shoving Bud aside as Gordon Gekko and , his wife, and (, others) are shown through the ropes into the door
Bud says something to Gordon but it gets lost in the confusion
79TH  &  - People pouring into the subway on the way to work
Bud rifles through the Financial Times he's just bought at the newsstand and finds the article he was looking for: 1984
He thrusts his fist in the air, victoriously
bounds down the subway stairs
'  - Bud's on the quotron and the phone; the word's spread around the office, he's landed Gekko and brokers drop by his desk to get the lowdown
(on the phone) What's it at now
Still moving
Great
The man of the day
Pour some water on him to cool him off
one of these days  want to know how you got Gekko's account
(indicating Dan's Yale tie) My magic tie, Dan
'll trade you
Lou Mannheim and a Chinese   intersect
Gordo the Great, way to go
(pleased) Good little company
remember when we got the money for Bluestar to build those first planes, back in the fifties
(to Bud) hear you're buying Teldar
Bud smiles back at her mischievously
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created
Nothing
No substance behind it
(succinct) Old values
Buy
She hears him
As they go, Marvin swivels madly over in his chair
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality
Gimme a break
You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday
Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit
You must have real Nostradamus
(Bud ignoring him, picking up the phone) Jesus Christ, what are friends for
All right,  owe you one Marv
That's right, next time a little birdie talks to you, talk to me too Hutton
(pool secretary) Buddy, phone
Gordon Gekko
Everybody in the adjacent area turns and looks at Buddy like in an
Hutton commercial
(on phone) Hi Natalie
lunch at 21
(looks at watch) 'm out the door
As he springs up to leave, Lynch the manager happens to be strolling by
He nods pleasantly at Buddy
Nice piece of work, Fox
Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room
'd love to, Mr
Lynch, thank you
21  - Dark mahagony wood, plush banquettes, a long oak bar
Bud enters the main dining room in a relatively outre suit that hangs on him embarrassingly as other businessmen in well-cut suits move around him and a Maitre d' sniffs, then leads him to where Gekko is parked, finishing up his lunch
half finished plate is removed to make way for Bud
Hi sport
(still nervous) Nice to see you again Mr
Gekko
He's seated
Try the steak tartare
It's off the menu but Louis'll make it for you
' Of course sir
And to drink
He looks at Gekko's bottled water
Uh
just a Evian, thank you
The Maitre d' leaves
Gekko proudly pulls a tiny 3" by 6" color television out of his pocket with a 2" diagonal screen, flips it on to the Dow Jones avarages
See this
Can you believe it
Two inch screen
can't even see it
for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam
We're going into a new age pal
So how's business today
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when  left the office
It might spin up to 25 by the bell
(a tiny smile) Teldar's shooting up
Buy any for yourself
Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office
(flushes) No sir, that would've been illegal
(doesn't believe him) Sure
relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle
Here, is this legal
you wanna put it in my account
As he fishes a check out and drops it on Bud's plate
Greeting   who stop at the table as Bud picks up the check, glances at it
His hand starts to tremble
The check is for $500,000
(to bus boy, the bankers excited) Can we have the check over here for christ's sake
(rushing off) Yes sir
Cover the Bluestar buy and put a couple hundred thou in one of those bow-wow stocks you mentioned
Pick the dog with the least fleas
Use a stop loss so your downside is 50,000, and buy yourself a decent suit
You can't come in here looking like that
(Bud flushes, embarassed) Go to Morty Sills, Tell 'em  sent you
(his genuine look) Mr
Gekko -- thank you for the chance
You won't regret this, you're with a winner
(paying the check with cash) put the rest of it in a money market account for now
want to see what you know before  invest it
and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious
(stung) Excuse me sir
Gekko rising to leave, the Maitre d' hovering around
You heard me
don't like losses sport
Nothing ruins my day more than losses
You do good, you get perks, all kinds of perks
Stay home tonight
Louis, take care of 'im
Enjoy the lunch
Confused, Bud watches Gekko walk out of the room, pumping extended hands left and right
He holds the cashiers check up to his eyes, entranced by it, like a kid with his first dollar
as the raw steak tartare with an egg on top is put in front of him
'  - Bud is at his computer when the door bell rings
He's not expecting a visitor
When he opens the door he is knocked for a loop
smashing looking  in a fitted Chanel suit, ropes of chains, short tight skirt, beautiful long legs, is standing there
Taking in the apartment, she hides her distaste
Hello Bud, 'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's
(in a daze) Lisa
Gordon
Oh, Mr
Gekko
Sure
Would you, uh, like to come in
Didn't he tell you
(sighs) That's so like Gordon
Get dressed, we're going out
We are
'  - stretch limo is parked in front, neighborhood inspecting it
The  opens the back door, as Lisa steps inside, Buddy in tow
The winos clap, howling at her
- Bud in the back seat next to Lisa, gazes out the black tinted window as they drive away, then turns to her as she gives him a bottle of Champagne to open
So, where are we going
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe
or maybe we can just drive around for a while
(provocatively) Work up an appetite
She crosses her legs
Bud's eyes moving south
He pops the cork
Lisa does a little blow, offers him
Want some
(he shorts) Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker
What do you like
(feeling the rush) Like
Uh
hmmm
Well
got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but been burned on tips
What do you think Bud
Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8
(his voice cracking) Up a quarter
very attractive
about average yield
She unzips his fly
Rising profits
strong balance sheets, good earnings per share
(removing her blouse) So you're hot on this stock
(nods, moaning) It's ready to take off
'd jump all over it if  were you
As she pulls up her skirt and climbs on top of Buddy
'  - Buddy, in an obviously new Mort Sills suit, struts past Carolyn at the reception desk, in high spirits
(smiles) Morning Buddy, you look happy
Any better and 'd be guilty
(picking up the flow) You were never that innocent sugarpie
(coyly) how do you know
You wish
: Bud on the phone, gazing at the ticker, concern in his eyes
of the tape ticker comes up over the music
He looks at Marv
: Later
Research reports piling up
Bud's secretary trying to get his attention
Bud's concern growing, as the green fluorescent numbers spit across the board
growing louder
Pan to Marvin, hands cupped in prayer
To Dan Steeples who closes his eyes and shakes his head
: Close
Bud watching the tape -- dizzying, hypnotic blur of numbers
The roar of the clicker, drowning out the music
a runaway freight train
: Bud's hands clamped over his eyes
The numbers stop
Noise recedes
He opens his eyes, looks down at his desk, stacked with reports and phone messages, as the pool secretary, , calls out
Marvin glumly coasts over in his chair
Boy, we sure went down the toilet on that ugly bitch
If we were Japs, we'd have to stay with our aircraft
(calls out) Mr
Gekko's office is after you
Be at the Wyatt Club courts at six
Bud looks worried, at Marvin
- Games in progress on the four courts, heavy hitting sounds
Crossing to Gekko and Bud going at it
Bud is obviously the worse for wear
(amused) come on sport, you gotta try harder,  need some exercise for chrissake
(out of breath) Mr
Gekko,  don't think  can
go on
finish out the game, Bud, push yourself
Meant paternally or sadistically, it's hard to tell
Gekko hits the ball, a big fat shot
Bud returns, Gekka moves him around the court, as if punishing him, the kid exhausted but the ball's never quite out of reach -- till Bud finally can't take it anymore and at the end of his breath, smashes into the wall and collapses
Gekko laughs
Bud lying there like a sad dog as Gekka hauls him up
The public is out there throwing darts at a board, sport
don't throw darts at a board
only bet sure things
Read Sun Tzu's "The Art of War
" 'every battle is won before it is ever fought
' Think about it
He exits the squash court
- Gekko and Bud sit alone, wreathed in steam
(sweating) Nice club, Mr
Gekko
Yeah
not bad for a City College boy
Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps
just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with -- they like animals but they can't stand people
(easing into it) Uh, Mr
Gekko, we took a little loss today
We got stopped out on Tarafly
(Gekko waits) about 50 thousand
Gekko's expression is frightening but cool
guess your father's not a union representative on that company
(laughs, shocked) What
How do you know about my father
The most valuable commodity  know of is information
Wouldn't you agree on that
(exhaling deeply) Yes
- Buddy is slumped on a bench after taking a shower, drinking a Coke
Gekko towelling himself down, getting dressed
naked man constantly stopping by to greet him
Hi Fred, hi Barry, how's the wife
still living in Larchmont
Yeah, still commuting
y'ever do anything with that Aetna Gas deal
nah
fishing for information, for a possible drink or meeting but Gekko stonewalls them all
You're not as smart as  thought you were, Buddy boy, Listen hard -- don't count on Graham and Dodd to make you a fortune, everybody in the market knows the theory, ever wonder why fund managers can't beat the & 500
'Cause they're sheep -- and the sheep get slaughtered
been in the business since '69
Most of these high paid MBAs from Harvard never make it
You need a system, discipline, good people, no deal junkies, no toreadores, the deal flow burns most people out by 35
Give me PSHs -- poor, smart and hungry
And no feelings
You don't win 'em all, you don't love 'em all, you keep on fighting, and if you need a friend, get a dog, it's trench warfare out there sport
(eyeing the surroundings) and in here too
got twenty other brokers out there, analyzing Charts
don't need another one
Talk to you sometime
He turns to go, Bud panicking
Is this the kissoff
(with all his conviction) 'm not just another broker Mr
Gekko
If you give me another chance, 'll prove it to you
'll go the extra yard for you
One more chance
Please
Gekko looks back, a beat, walks over to Bud, thrusts his towel hard at his stomach
You want one more chance
Then stop sending me information and start getting me some
Get dressed, 'll show you my charts
-   - / Cruising up Park Avenue
panel slides open next to the bar with a portable computer on it
television is turned on to the evening news, a low hum of voices
Gekko punches into the keyboard of the computer
name appears an the screen
with curriculum vitae following; address, phones, businesses
Know the name
'Course
Larry Wildman
One of the first raiders
(amused, cold hatred) Sir Larry Wildman
Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in
bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole  Pharmaceuticals right out from under me
Wildman the white knight
(excited) remember that deal
You were involved
Gekko shuts off the computer and slides it back into the housing, his eyes taking in the low-volume news
Revenge is a dish best served cold
well, it's payback time, sport
(looking out suddenly) see that building
bought into it ten years ago
It was my first real estate deal
sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit
It was better than sex
At that time thought that was all tne money in the world
(drinks) Now, it's a day's pay
had a mole in Wildman's employ
Gave me half the picture, then he got fired
don't understand
Wildman's in town
He just became an American citizen
Something big's about to go down
want to know where he goes and who he sees
want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture
Follow him
Mr
Gekko
(shaken) It's not what  do
could lose my license
If the  found out, could go to jail
It's inside information, isn't it
(scratches his head wryly) Inside information
Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline
Or someone overhears me saying 'm gonna buy Teldar Paper
Or the chairman of the board of suddenly knows it's time to blow out
You mean that
(a piercing look) 'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and  are gonna have a hard time doing any business
Bud downs the rest of his drink, upset by the darkening mood
There's something very powerful and frighteninq about Gekko
What about hard work
What about it
You work hard
'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought
And where'd it get you
my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies
And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory
Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside
And 'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", 'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing
You had what it takes to let through my door
Next question: You got what it takes to stay
The car stopping in traffic
Horns honking
(pointing) Look out there
-- a
richly dressed stands at the curb next to the  with a shopping cart filled with garbage
(
) You really think the difference 'tween this guy and that guy is luck
Mohammed, pull over
The car pulls over
Gekko checks his watch, pulls out the telephone
when it comes to money, sport, everybody's of the same religion
Or should be
Hope you don't mind if  let you off here, 'm late for a meeting
Good bye, nice knowing you
- The  lets Bud out the door
Bud looks back at Gekko
All right, Mr
Gekko
you got me
His eyes telling us he is weighed down by chains of guilt
Gekko smiles, gazes at the twilight skyline, a sudden look of contentment
Yeah, it's a beautiful night love this hot stinkin' city
(pointing up Park Avenue) nothing else like it in the world
Seven million people living on each other's heads, kids born, millionaires dying, people praying, junkies, whores, wills, lawyers, deals, parties, sex
guys like you sport -- dreaming about the big score
You know the best thing about New York is everything you can do here
And the worst thing is everything you can't do here
He shuts the door
Bud watches as the limo drives off
- Bud, in a suit, waits next to a motorcycle across from one of the most desirable addresses in New York
The Doorman rushes to open the door under the canopy as a tall strong man in his fifties emerges with a and a
The man is    and his manner and gait convey the impression of an authoritative presence with little patience as the chauffeur opens the door and he slides into the back seat of the limo
Buddy, astride Marv's Kawasaki 500, hits the streets after him
The music through the following Montage should suggest a chase brio
- Bud shooting past the Trinity Church structure
Wildman gets out of his limo with his people, strides into the lobby
Bud quickly parks his bike on the sidewalk and rushes in after them
not a second too late
-    - Bud just manages squeeze in the elevator with Wildman and crew -- and -- a couple of other early birds -- as the doors close
- Bud eyeing Wildman, looks away as Wildman looks back at him, an edge of defiance to him, why are you staring at me
Not the world's most likeable personality
,  -   - The doors open and Wildman and Co
step out into the reception area of Kahn, Seidelman
The doors close and Buddy continues upward
- The street now jammed with people hurrying to work
Buddy paces the curb, reacting when Wildman walks out, saying goodbye to the female executive and getting in the limo with his lawyer
Buddy follows
-   - Formal French haute cuisine
Power lunches in progress
As Wildman is seated with several well-dressed  at a good table, Bud tries to wrangle a table (next to Mr
Wildman on top of everything from a stiff looking Maitre d' who shakes his head, barely concealing his attitude towards Buddy's youth and general demeanor
- Buddy waits outside, bored, as Wildman steps out, shakes hands with the bankers
Bud making an entry into his notebook like any good spy
- Music rising to triumphant proportions
of Limo emerging from the tunnel and onto the Long Island Expressway
, picking up Buddy on the Kawasaki, darting through lanes, staying several car lengths behind
- The Limo winds its way along the perimeter road, past commercial airliners
It takes the turnoff for Butler Aviation
Buddy exits the ramp shortly after them
- corporate saberliner jet, its engines running, idles at the end of the taxiway
The limo pulls up along the tarmac next to it and Wildman steps out, walking past a  to the stairs of the plane
waits for him
- Bud watches, wondering what to do as the plane taxies down the runway
He spots the flight mechanic and the answer comes to him
He starts running towards the mechanic
- Bud races up to the mechanic
Oh shit, don't tell me Mr
Wildman was on board that plane
(the mechanic nods) My boss is gonna kill me
was supposed to give him this
(holding his notebook) You know where that plane is going
(walking off) Erie, Pennsylvania
-   - (into phone, proudly) after spending the morning at Kahn, Seidelman -- on the 14th floor, the junk bond department -- where Shane Mora works -- he had lunch at La Cirque with a group of well-dressed heavyset bean- counters
(Gekko voice back: "the adjectives are redundant, sport") he later stopped off at Morgan
'd say from all the palm-pressing and sweet smiling going on that Larry got some nice fat financing
-     - Alex and Susan are with him
Gekko playing the computer, eyes lighting up on the phone
bright but not bright enough, Sherlock, roll the dice and play a little monopoly
what box would Sir Lawrence land on in Erie, Pennsylvania
- Bud slapping his face, realizing
Jesus Christ, he's buying Anacott Steel
- Gordon already has the closing figures punched up on his quotron
Calls his shot
When the market opens tomorrow, buy five thousand March fifty calls
You hear me
Start buying ten thousand share blocks and take it up to fifty dollars
When it reaches fifty, you can let out a little taste to your friends
Then call this number -- 555-7617: tell the man "blue horseshoe loves Anacott Steel
" You scored, Buddy
Be in touch
(hangs up) He hangs up, looks at Alex and Susan
Start buying Anacott Steel all over the board
- large company banner hangs from the rafters: "Bluestar - The Vision Goes On
" Buddy's father, Carl, Charley Dent and Dominick Amato are changing the generator on a 727
welder is repairing a wing seam
Buddy shouting to his Dad over the noise
Hey Dad
Hi ya Charlie
Dominick
They wave back, Carl climbing down a maintenance stand
lights up a cigarette
What brings you out here
Client
Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation
Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the

Alright
Why so pissed
Goddamn fare wars are murdering us
Had to lay off five guys
Nothing could do

Yeah, it is
In fact 'm doing great
New client
Whole new league
It's starting to happen Dad
The Big Leagues
You know what 'm saying
He sticks the cash in his hand

but how do you know you'll have any dough next month
(looking at the money) What's this
gave you two hundred
Dividend

(tries to give it back) don't be crazy
Put it to your school loans
Don't worry about the loans
'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now
least buy yourself a new suit
What do  need a fancy suit for don't hobnob with the jet set just fix their planes
Buddy forces the money into his hand
then buy yourself a decent bowling jacket so when you take Mom out you don't look like the Roto Rooter man
Come on, for godsakes, that's what money's for
Enjoy yourself
Touched, his father shakes his head and smiles
He takes it
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you
Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me
thanks
(admiration) Dad, you should've been a
How about dinner
Whatever night you like

You stop smoking, you hear
'  - Bud silent, an intent look on his face, gazing up at the digital clock
as it flicks to 9:30
post time
Tickers, squawk boxes and shouting erupt
Bud calls in his order: "10,000   46
and let me know how the options are opening
" Music skips along in a revolving madcap fashion
- hands the buy order to the
He starts writing a ticket as we pull back: - Company floor traders are jammed into a narrow booth, frantically takinq orders over phones and telex machines
The   gives the ticket to a , a young man wearing worn sneakers, who dashes off
We follow him across the scruffy Exchange Floor, as he weaves through a crush of traders crammed around horseshoe-shaped kiosks, cathode-ray tubes slung above them, displaying the latest prices in bright, green letters and numbers
Intermittent shrieks and howls, calls to buy and sell, issue from the far reaches of the labyrinthian room
As in the final leg of a relay race, the  hands the ticket off to a  , who is buying and selling at the post where Anacott Steel is traded
The  checks the ticket and turns to the , executing the order

Marv stalks by, shouting on the phone
Bud looks away from the ticker, pretending to read a report
When Marv disappears, Bud hastily calls in at 49
- On the tired  dodging through the crowd, and over to the  handing him a new ticket
'  - Close on the   -- as Anacott Steel hits 50
Buddy jumps up from his chair, and animatedly crosses to Marv who is on the phone, cold calling
Tell Mr
Ehrlich 've got important financial news
It concerns his future
Bud presses down on the phone button, cutting him off
What the hell
Anacott Steel
Buy it
Marv looks at Joe and sees a look on his face that he's never seen before
(nervous) Anacott Steel -- right
Bud leaves, Marv re-dials
Dr
Beltzer, you're gonna love this
Lou Mannheim hangs up the phone, a troubled look
Bud leans into his office
Mr
Mannheim, got a sure thing
(whispering) Anacott Steel
(scoffs) No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes
Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals
What's going on Bud
Do you know something
(Bud uncomfortable, Lou reads it) Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets
(Bud anxious to go) You're part of something here, Bud
The money you make for people creates science and research jobs
Don't sell that out
You're right, Mr
Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud
It's a winner Mr
Mannheim, trust me -- buy

(winks) light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up
Dan Steeples's talking confidentially on the phone
've just heard the most lovely two words
'Anacott Steel
' Buddy dialing the phone number that Gekko gave him
He speaks into the receiver, in a hushed voice
Blue horseshoe loves Anacott Steel
(hangs up) - The  on the other end of the phone hangs up
He rises from his desk, strides across the busy news floor, over to an
Anacott Steel's in play
Check the arbs
-  - Wind and waves
Gekko's modern, Sante Fe structure house sits on a dune overlooking the grey Atlantic
(
) Sweeten the offer, throw 2 bucks more in a convertible preferred
And 5 year contracts for themselves
- Immense slanted ceilings, a vast clean modern space filled with dozens of contemporary art objects, junk sculptures, floor to ceiling windows radiating light, that look out on a cantilevered deck and pool - and the ocean beyond
(') (on the phone) Cromwell wants to play financial chicken with me, we'll see who swerves first
Where the hell's Gene
Gekko slumps down on a sofa, exhausted, watching one of several news reports he master-controls with a remote
(on phone) You sent him to Vermont to get the deposition from the  Cromwell fired
done and done
Night gang, and Susan no legs waving in the air tonight
want you dreaming about Teldar Paper
During this, , Gordon's 3 year-old son, drives in in the latest electronic baby toy -- a Porsche-bodied electric car
Gekko hangs up, checks out a Reuters quotron positioned nearby
Rudy Kazootee, how's my cutie
The kid jumps out of the car and scoots into his father's lap
Daddy bad boy
Bad boy
-- play with Wudi
Now
No, not now Rudy
Daddy's making money to buy you toys
Daddy work
Daddy work bad boy
Gordon absently tossles Rudy's hair, his eyes glued to the The kid senses it, jumps back off his lap and into the car
the big story tonight is Anacott Steel which closed at 51 1/8
Up 5 1/8 from yesterday's close on heavy trading
Kate, Gordon's beautiful, raven-haired wife, homemaker and antiquer, enters with the bovine-eyed    from France
just at Rudy drives his car into a wall where it stalls, engines grinding
think somebody's playing hooky from the bathtub
Rudy, say good night DAddy
(can't hear, to Kate) Shut that off, willya
Kate, upset with the noise, tries to pull her son nicely out of the car
The Korean  coming in
Calls for you, sir, a reporter from Time magazine on two, says it's important
and a Mr
Fox on three
(annoyed) come to the country and it's worse than the city
'm not home
(changes mind, pushes in) Yeah
(off) Mr
Gekko, 've been trying to reach you
We got the options
We got a good execution on them
Meanwhile, the kid has no intention of going anywhere and plants his feet and emits the loudest shrieking this side of the fat lady in the opera
Nicole
Take him will you
Handing the bawling, writhing mass of anger to Nicole as if it were laundry she doesn't want to touch
Nicole takes him screaming out of the room
Gordon trying to concentrate on the
: '  - Papers and charts are strewn around, trailing down to a box of take-out pizza and empty beer bottles
Bud has stayed late
(almost apologetic, speeding on the high of the buy
) got all  could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls
Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call just wish  could've got more
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out
First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment
Where do we stand
In response to an inquiry from the New York Stock Exchange, management issued a terse no comment
Wildman would not return phone calls
Analysts believe the company is worth $75 per share in a transaction
John and Carmen are here and the Livingstons are on their way
(nods, listening to phone) 'll be right there, fix them a drink
(shifting the figures) we have 37
2 million invested
At this point, we're up 3
1 million and some change
If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill
(smiles) You're walking between the raindrops kid
expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow
(sighs) Can't it wait
'm good for it
(Bud waits, "Sir") Awright
Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up
'   -  - Bud's
as he pulls up to an austere, ultra- sophisticated monolith of glass and wood dominating a stretch of dune overlooking the Atlantic's angry surf
Several Jags, state of the art Jeeps and a Rolls are drawn up outside
Bud, getting out of his faded Honda, goes up the stairs to the door
He rings several times
opens it and looks at Buddy somewhat warily
Laughter and voices are heard from inside
(pretentiously: high English accent) Can  help you
Bud Fox
Got some papers for Mr
Gekko to sign
Wait a moment please
Without thinking he closes the door in Joe's face
He stands there, harrassed peering around through a window on the lawn
small gathering of friends in progress around a glowing fireplace
The butler waves him in from the door
- Bud enters, as Gekko approaches
He seems annoyed to be disturbed at his country home
(apologetic) Sorry, Mr
Gekko
(takes the papers) Allright
Wait here
About to go when his wife, Kate Gekko, comes over
pretty dark-haired woman
Problems
No
Bud Fox, my wife, Kate
They exchange pleasantries
You came from the city
(with a look to Gordon) Long drive, have a drink
Gekko doesn't seem to like the idea, but
Yeah, why not, Bud boy
Kate's walking back inside to her guests, as Bud sidles over to Gekko
if you'd rather not, Mr
Gekko, can leave
- They cross to the main living room
It's okay Buddy, you know Alex
Candice Rogers
(Alex and his date shake hands, faintly aloof) This is Stone Livingston
and his wife Muffie
(a young stuffy banker in weekend corduroys looks at Bud as if he obviously doesn't belong) Darien Taylor, Sam Ruspoli, Carmen Winters, Dick Brady
All old friends
Bud looking wide-eyed at the beautiful "Calvados" he's been dreaming of for weeks
she's with Mr
and doesn't recognize Bud, nods back, they all nod back, naturally suspicious of the young outsider
Rudy's wheels  around the floor with a drink on its tray, talking computer talk
(charmed by it) good idea Gordon, good help is hard to find these days but can he whip up a dry vodka martini
well he doesn't talk back or steal the silver and Dick's gonna get me an exemption on him, aren't you
(Dick Brady is obviously an accountant) Bud plucks a glass of wine from the robot's tray and plunks himself down on a sofa, overhearing the conversation between Muffie Livingston and Candice Rogers
there  am in St
Kitt's in my new Kamali leopard skin -cut bikini which is going to turn back the clock on our marriage five years, you know what  mean, and can't even fit into it, my skin's all pink and inflamed, and  look like a walking social disease all because this Ukranian bitch botched the wax on my bikini line
(revolted) Oh my god, how ghastly, you should sue her
The Korean houseboy has come over to Gekko
Call for you sir
Sir Larry Wildman, he says it's important
Bud tightens, so does the whole room hearing the name of the moment
Gekko smiles at Buddy
(to houseboy) Make Mr
Livingston a martini would you Nyung, and this gentleman
(to Bud) Stick around, this could be fun
He goes to the alcove to take the call
So,  had to sit around the beach wearing a moo-moo for 10 days, my whole vacation ruined
(noticing as Bud laughs, chokes on the wine, spilling some on the couch) You just spilled your wine
Bud noticing the stain, starts wiping it
You're just making it worse
-  () (on phone) Larry, what a surprise
(beat) Can it wait till tomorrow
got some people over
(dryly) if you feel that way Larry, come over
-  () The blonde,  , is examining a modern sculpture as Buddy comes over with two Calvados
Hello again,  been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks
(uncomprehending) Excuse me
Grand Marnier
romantic and tragic drink
Oh yes,  remember you
Destiny took us apart, but  knew it would bring us back together
Aha
Poet or philosopher
Stock broker
As in: never have so few done so little for so much
So what do you see in this
Bud indicates the painting in front of them -- a buffalo skull in the desert by Georgia 'Keefe
'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week
few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me
Oh really
(looks at him quizically) Well,  guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June
(chokes) You could have a great beach house for that
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey
If you sold this, (indicates a Rothko hanging near the 'Keefe) you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth
But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration
Boy,  thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here
Not really
'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around
He has a great eye and he only buys the best
Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind
The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid
It absolutely makes the room
See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa
although
(she's really warming up to her subject now) don't know if  would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy
And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table
Some dope might use it as an ashtray
gather you're a decorator
You got it, a great spender of other people's money
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place
Where is it
Upper West Side
(losing interest fast) Oh really
Home of the exposed brick wall and the (shudders) houseplant
Oh it's just a rental
'm moving to the East Side soon
've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon
(shifts uncomfortably with his pretension) but that's just conversation
what about real things
Like dinner
The two of us
Friday
Cafe
Santo Domingo
Bud waits, staring suddenly and deeply into her eyes
What if  have a previous engagement
Break it
guess this must be destiny alright
My first yuppie apartment and
(pats him on the cheek flirtatiously) my first yuppie
(gives her a steely glare) You may call me a yuppie
It's Mister Yuppie to you
They both laugh
(gets serious) So
See you Friday
You really do believe in destiny
Only if  want something bad enough
Her date, Mr
,   intersects with Kate cultivated European air
there you go again, Darien, talking with strange men
That's our Darien: elusive, reclusive, exclusive
(to Sam) You know Bud right
He works for Gordon
(Sam nodding, makes conversation, big smile) Sam's in banking
You staying for dinner Bud
(hesitant, eyes Darien) No, 'm afraid 've got to get some work
Kate noticing the doorbell ringing
excuse me
Sam muttering something in Darien's ear of an intimate nature
She glides away with him
(to Bud) Call me next week, 'll give you an estimate
An ironic promise in her eyes
Bud ecstatic inside
looks over, goes to the foyer
-  () walks in, his country gentleman clothing somewhat softening his imposing figure but not the cultured rapacious eagle's face
With him a lawyer
(strained) Larry, how have you been
Get you a drink
(slightly impatient) Oh fine
Travelling actually
Nothing thank you
Is
Gordon
He's right here
As Gordon intersects, casually tasting a spot of the dinner
Larry
Excuse me "sir" Larry, great to see you again, you're looking good
(handshakes) Gordon
(sniffing the guests and furnishings in the room as if they were stale air) (leaving, to Gordon) guess 'll head back
(spontaneously) Stick around
Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox
Pleasantries
Bud nervously shakes hands, sensing Wildman might recognize him from being tailed in the elevator
There indeed is a moment but Wildman's attention blurs as
Shall we go upstairs
-  () Gordon enters a den lined with old books hunting prints;  he proudly picks up something from his gun collection
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a
45 Luger
Only six were ever manufactured
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel
The same interest as yours Larry
Money
thought it'd be a good investment for my kid
No
This time 'm in for the long term
This is not a liquidation, Gordon
'm going to turn it around
You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock,  could modernize the plant
'm not the only one who pays here Gordon
We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers
strong hint of the cockney working class east and London boy whiffing through his speech and manner
The "mate" is tough and to the point but not insulting
(has to smile) You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry
Let's cut the "sir" crap
Correct me if 'm wrong, but when you took Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline
(cold, deliberate) could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, know it,  could buy you six times ever,  could dump the stock just to burn your ass but  happen to want the company and  want your block of shares
'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and 'm expecting your commitment
Bud watching this drama unfold
Gekko is about to blow, controls it
Showdowns bore me Larry, neither side wins
You can have the company, in fact it's gonna be fun watching you and your giant ego try to make a horserace out of it
(turns to Bud) What do you think is a fair price for our stock Bud
Bud in the spotlight
The eyes all shift to him -- his moment
After an initial panic, he's cool as a cucumber -- and ruthless as his mentor
The break up value is higher
It's worth 80
But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72
His eyes to Wildman who looks at him, cold, icy mean
You're a two bit pirate and a green-mailer, Gekko, nothing more
not only would you sell your mother to make a deal, you'd send her
Bud looking sharply as Gekko's eyes flare with hot white anger
My mail's the same color as yours Larry
Or it was till the Queen started calling you "sir"
Now excuse me before  lose my temper
He rises and exits
$71
Gekko stops at the door, a beat
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71
50
Done
You'll hear from my lawyers
8 a
m
Good night
He walks out with the silent lawyer
Past Gekko who watches
"Ta Ta"
(to Bud) He's right
had to sell
The key to the game is your capital reserves
You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs
(mimicking Gordon now) "All warfare is based on deception
" Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight
if not, split and reevaluate
You're learning, sport
'  - - Exhausted from the drive back, Bud takes off his sweater and tie and collapses onto the bed, closing his eyes
The phone rings
With a start he wakes and answers it
Yeah
: '   - The sky is still dark, the first rays of light coming up over the ocean
Gekko, a lonely figure in a windbreaker, restlessly prowls the edge of the beach, waves crashing around him
He's been up all night and has an exhausted, driven look as he whispers over the wind into the cellular phone
Money never sleeps pal
When  came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us
Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying
just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold
It's been wired to you -- play with it
You done good, but you gotta keep doing good
showed you how the game works, now school's out
(protests) Mr
Gekko, 'm there for you 110%
You don't understand
want to be surprised
astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it
My wife tells me you put a move on Darien
Here's some inside info for you
That Euroflash  guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep
Exit visas are imminent
So don't lose your place in line
(gazing at the surf) Oh, jeez,  wish you could see this
The lights coming up over the water
've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment
(suddenly fatigued) an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar
"  like you sport,  ever tell you that
Gordon, call me Gordon from now on
(off) Gordon
Yeah, 'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox
'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien
Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac
This is your wake-up call
Go to work
He lets the phone drop to his side, staring glazed-eyed at the ocean
'  - leads Bud into the plush, private office of a cocky young lawyer,  , about tho same age as Bud, his his feet up on the desk, sleepily waving to Buddy to park his ass
The pictures an his walls and desk indicate a rich family
Fox, Bud
is this deja vu or has it really been a year
You're not hitting me up for  are you
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway
hear you're moving up in the world
An associate already
Not bad
How's Margie
Can't complain
Got a house in Oyster Bay
Market treating you good
Still seeing that sexy French gal
Nah, she asked the wrong question
What was that
"What are you thinking
"
that was it
The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money,  can't lose and  can't get hurt
(interested) So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over
Okay
What about you,  hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through
Any surprises  haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal
(casually) Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you
(equally casual, looks at the walls) Who's listening
It's just one college buddy talking to another
(sarcastic) Yeah, right
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know
and if  did, what's in it for moi
He obviously has thought about it before
Bud smiles back, nonchalant
More money than you ever dreamed, Roger
And the thing is no one gets hurt
how bout a beer
(some doubt) Too much to do
but 'll walk you out
'  - They walk out past the   coming in for the evening, drones of the vacuum cleaners
Bud looks - his
as she pulls the vacuum cleaner into one of the senior partners offices, the desk crammed with proposals, Bud is lost in thought
(teasing) Get inside my uncle's door Buddy, all the secrets of the world are yours
the life blood of companies, but you gotta go to law school first
'   - Bud comes out of the building and starts walking away
As he passes the freight entrance, Bud abruptly notices a van marked
He looks back, thinks for a moment: a look in his eyes
-    - Bud walks past a row of small warehouses and enters one
- He steps into a shabby reception area
chain-smoking looks up from the switch-board
need to speak to the owner about some business
- The owner, a  with bushy mustache and hardened face, sits at his desk eating lunch, eyeing Bud suspiciously
(handing him a card) Mr
Panos, 've charted the growth of new office space in the city, and  think you're in the right business at the right time
Thank you for telling me what already know
'm impressed with your work and could use a tax break
This is a growing business
Are you interested in some working capital and a partner
Panos puts down his sandwich, measuring Bud
What makes you think  need a partner
Bud smiles, ready with his spiel
An elevator opens
body steps out
set of keys
Boom up past a clipboard and pen to a shirt pocket with written on it, up to Bud dressed in janitorial clothing
We move with him to the   who introduces who nervously absorb Bud, worried for their jobs
Bud strolls from office to office, looking official, overseeing his crew, making notations on a checklist
Bud slips into the Senior Partners' office, thumbs through a calendar on the desk
Sees the list of people, moves to the computer, punches the client's name in
The code number comes up
Bud nods to a   down the hall and enters the file room where he looks at the Cleaning Lady and points to his watch
As she exits, he scrambles nervously through the files -- finds the code number -- then anxiously flips the pages to the critical tender offer document -- with the target name --
It's stamped "" across the page
His face lights up
The secret to the kingdom
He puts it back, exits
: '  - Gekko on the phone, smiling
- Bud, obviously exhausted from his day and night roles, is telling him something on the phone
- Bud furtively xeroxes a document on a small hand-carried copy machine in his pocket or photographs it if it is too large
- Bud and Alex, Gekko's assistant, having lunch
Alex gives him the briefcase he's carrying
Pan from Alex to Bud back to discover Darien in the next scene
- Bud dines with Darien, small talk, intimate looks
- Bud is in an office, eyes panning the shelves
(
) Can  help you
Bud's head jerks around
young female  is burning the midnight oil
She looks at him from behind a stack of briefs
(backing off) Uh
Wrong office
Sorry
- Gekko, Kate, Bud, Darien and    roar over the dunes, each in their own dune buggy, laughing and hollering at one another
Buddy driving right up precariously close on Darien, who screams
Buddy flips over his vehicle
comes up laughing
we sense he is getting wilder now
-  - Darien rides expertly
beautiful, immaculately-groomed stallion is being shown to Gekko by the trainer
Bud is sipping wine as he looks on with Kate
(proudly) Got him at an auction in Kentucky
How much
(fondling the head) Close to two million
(Bud whistles) But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals
Darien rides in, smiling to Bud
Devon
He looks like Seattle Slew
What about the Triple Crown
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper
How would  know
once bet a horse
He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five
He laughs, a little sloppy
- Darien swims in the ocean, long looping athletic strokes
- '   - They're finishing lunch by the pool framed by a lush flower garden where Kate and son Rudy play
, Gekko's chief lawyer, thick glasses, smart eyes and bags of worry that could only come from watching other people's money, looks very city-like in his clothing, examining his paperwork before passing it to Bud, who is the picture of relaxation
You understand Mr
Gekko is constantly barraged with nuisance litigation and  audits
(nods) Of course
So it's in both our interests to put a safe distance between you and us
(passing a document with a 2nd pen) this gives you limited power of attorney for Mr
Gekko's account
Every trade you make is at your discretion
Every ticket you buy must be marked "power of attorney
" That means you call the shots and Mr
Gekko has no official knowledge of what stocks you're buying
Sign here and here
Buddy looks, then up to Gekko, who smiles, casual
just the beginning, sport, just the begining
Bud smiles, signs
(a worrier) you understand if any problems arise, you're out there on your own
The trail stops with you
All's fair in love and war
The art of which is deception
Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned
think  got some friends that won't mind making some easy money
As Kate drifts over with Rudy and the French au pair , Rudy, viens ici, dit bonjour a Monsieur Bud
Rudy either says "No
" or "Bonjour Monsieur Bud
' depending on the mood of the kid
Gordon sweeping him up and playing with him
The kid squeals with glee
(proudly) Already speaks a little French, kid got the highest score on his  test
(to Darien) it's so tough to get into a good nursery school now
They even visit your home to make sure your paintings and furnishings are acceptable
What's it cost these days
$5,000 just for the tuition
plus the books and supplies
(with a look to Gordon) some parents even have bodyguards
It's not a bad idea
(picking up Rudy) now that's it for you with the grown-ups young man
As Rudy smashes the strawberries around his face and resists going
"No
No
" Kate exasperated gives the child to Nicole
Nicole, take him for a nap, please
He doesn't nap anymore, Madame
It's been
(stung) Then play with him till he gets tired
We're going out tonight but we like to see him at, let's see, six; give him a bath and put that cute little black suit on him
(to Bud and Gordon) Black clothes are the newest things, so chic and milk stains, carrot juice stains just don't show up
Kids -- boy, can they take it out of you
Nicole's "Oui, Madame" is lost in the wrestling match she goes through to drag him out screaming
Kate walking off
Harold gives Buddy another piece of paper
This is a contact at one of our banks
On settlement day you'll open an account there for Mr
Gekko under the name of Geneva, Roth Holding Corp
Then you'll wire transfer the money to this account in the Cayman Islands
(rising, finished with lunch) Think about incorporating yourself there, Bud, Harold will take care of it for you
(with a look to Harold) at a reasonable fee
You're gonna make a lot of money now Bud
stakes are gonna go up, no mistakes
piece of cake, Gordon
- The camera glides off some  hauling their catch off their beached boat to Darien who comes tromping out of the surf, water glistening off her lean athletic body
Bud stands before her, cool seductive eyes, holding out a towel
She steps up to him and smiles inscrutably
Takes the towel from him, drying herself, instead
(gazing at the beach) If  could have anything
this would almost do
Yeah, almost
Looks at her, stifles his thought
(teasing) So, how did your conference go with Gordon
The conference, oh yeah
Fine
We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us
(laughs) You have modest wants
like that in a man
And what do you want
a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond
a Lear jet
world peace
the best of everything
Well, why stop at that
don't
(has to smile) You're not trouble by any chance
Are you
She looks at him, tosses the towel over her shoulder and starts back toward the house
Buddy watches her go
- The annual Teldar Paper stockholders' meeting is in session: 400 stockholders are there -- many middle aged and older, one bag lady
Cromwell sits on an elevated platform at the front of the room surrounded by an army of bulky , none of them weighing less than 200 pounds,  and Gekko in contrast seems like Robin Hood seated with Alex, Harold, Bud and the other stockholders
Cromwell is delivering his prepared attack on Gekko in a highly sarcastic, gruff manner
Your company, ladies and gentlemen, is under siege from Gordon Gekko
Teldar Paper is now leveraged to the hilt, like some piss poor South American country
instead of using our cash to build plants, build our business, all this man really wants is to get paid to withdraw his tender offer and that will cost us approximately another $200 million in greenmail which will be passed on to the consumer
Gekko seething, jumps up
Where do you get off speaking about me like that, making remarks to the press,  resent these remarks, demand the right to speak
Sit down, sir, you're out of order, haven't you done enough damage to Teldar as it is
have you no sense of decency
(to shareholders) How can your management
Gekko is urged to sit down by his people but we hear various catcalls, "Let the man speak
" "Sit down, Gekko
" (') concentrate on long term growth when we're busy fighting the get- rich-quick, short term profit, slot machine mentality of Wall Street when we should be fighting Japan
The original fundamental reason for Wall Street was to capitalize American business, underwrite new business, build companies, build America
The "deal" has now succeeded goods and services as America's gross national product and in the process, we are undermining our foundation
This cancer is called "greed"
Greed and speculation have replaced long-term investment
Corporations are being taken apart like erector sets, without any consideration of the public good
strongly recommend you to see through Mr
Gekko's shameless intention here to strip this company and severely penalize the stockholders strongly recommend you to reject his tender by voting for management's restructuring of the stock
: Gekko is now at floor level with a microphone
He's calmer, makes his pitch to the stockholders, looking up at the management
appreciate the chance you're giving me, Mr
Cromwell, as the single largest stockholder in Teldar, to speak
(gets some laughter and applause, loosens) On the way here today  saw a bumper sticker
It said, "Life is a bitch
then you die"
(gets another laugh) well ladies and gentlemen, we're not here to indulge in fantasies, but in political and economic reality
America has become a second rate power
Our trade deficit and fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions
In the days of the 'free market' when our country was a top industrial power, there was accountability to the shareholders
The Carnegies, the Mellons, the man who built this industrial empire, made sure of it because it was their money at stake
Today management has no stake in the company
Altogether these guys sitting up there own a total of less than 3% and where does Mr
Cromwell put his million dollar salary
Certainly not in Teldar stock, he owns less than 1%
You own Teldar Paper, the stockholders, and you are being royally screwed over by these bureaucrats with their steak lunches, golf and hunting trips, corporate jets, and golden parachutes
Teldar Paper has 33 different vice presidents each earning over $200,000 a year spent two months analyzing what these guys did and  still can't figure it out
(a big laugh) Cromwell is pissed
This is an outrage Gekko
You're full of shit
One thing  do know is this paper company lost $110 million last year, and 'd bet half of that is in the paperwork going back and forth between all the vice presidents
(increased laughter, he's getting them) The new law of evolution in corporate America seems to be 'survival of the unfittest'
Well in my book, you either do it right or you get eliminated
Teldar Paper is doomed to fail
Its diversification into casualty insurance has not worked
Its crown jewels are its trees, the rest is dross
Through wars, depressions, inflations and deterioration of paper money, trees have always kept their value, but Teldar is chopping them all down
Forests are perishable, forest rights are as important as human rights to this planet, and all the illusory Maginot lines, scorched earth tactics, proxy fights, poison pills, etc
that Mr
Cromwell is going to come up with to prevent people like me from buying Teldar Paper are doomed to fail because the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, as you very well know, is the only way to stay strong is to create value, that's why you buy stock, to have it go up
If there's any other reason, 've never hear it
(laughter) That's all 'm saying
it's you people who own this company, not them, they work for you and they've done a lousy job of it
Get rid of them fast, before you all get sick and die
may be an opportunist, but if these clowns did a better job, 'd be out of work
In the last seven deals 've been in, there were 2
3 million stockholders that actually made a pretax profit of $12 billion
When  bought the Ixtlan Corporation it was in the exact same position Teldar is today --  turned three of its companies private and  sold four others -- and each of these companies, liberated from the suffering conglomerate has prospered
am not a destroyer of companies,  am a liberator of them
The point is, ladies and gentlemen, greed is good
Greed works, greed is right
Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit
Greed in all its forms, greed for life, money, love, knowledge, has marked the upward surge of mankind -- and greed, mark my words -- will save not only Teldar Paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the
Thank you
Much applause as he sits
Now a standing ovation; shouts of approval
Cromwell knows he has lost the day, tries to continue the meeting by calling for "order"
Bud watches, impressed
'  - mill at their desks quietly
Bud enters, notices immediately the uneasy silence
His eyes go to Lynch's office
across the windows, he's talking to a very somber Dan Steeples
What's going on
(looking in the same direction) Lynch is giving him the boot
He's not pulling his quota
Bud's soft "no" matched by that second, tighter look
His -- closer on the glass
Dan Steeples pleading for his job
we know the things he's saying, we've heard them before
just one more chance, Mr
Lynch
Lynch shaking his head
(reminding him) we're all just one trade away from humility, Buddy
Dan Steeples steps out of the office, obviously close to tears but trying to maintain face
Buddy's eyes dart away, not wanting to deal with it
Dan Steeples walks by his as Lynch, on the loudspeaker, starts his morning announcements
New research report on  and a conference call on defense stocks at my office at 11
No required, just be there
And on an inspiring note 'm pleased to announce the new office record for a single month's gross commission goes to Bud Fox
Who more than doubled the old mark
Way to go Bud
Super job
Come on up here
As Dan Rickey passes him during this, Bud catches a glimpse of the older man's eyes
Dan tries to look brave
Heads turning to Bud with awe and envy
Congrats buddy buddy, you just made my life twice as hard around here
Bud moving toward Lynch, past Lou Mannheim
You're on a roll kiddo
Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does
(cocky) just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr
Mannheim
Bud passes Charlie Cushing, yawning on the phone as usual
So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping
Meet the membership
got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs
she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins
sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day
Chuck laughs, Bud's "in" now
Lynch indicates for Bud to follow him into an outer glass-enclosed office
Come in, Bud
'   - Neatly furnished, with a window overlooking Wall Street, and attractive   filing papers into a cabinet
(points) Congratulations
This is yours now
your own file cabinets
a window
your private secretary, Janet, (under his breath) significantly more attractive
Nice to meet you, Mr
Fox
She smiles at Bud, who heaves a sigh of relief, noticing his name plate on the desk
(thrilled) Thank you, Janet
thank you, Mr
Lynch
No, thank you
knew the minute laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud
Just keep it going
He winks and leaves
Charlie Cushing comes in, Marv sticks his head in the doorway, a grudging smile
So, its Mister Fox now
-    - splendid four-room thirtieth floor aerie overlooking Central Park
, anchored down with jewelry and a large fur purse, shows Bud around
everybody tells ya they hate the Upper East Side and they wanna live on the West Side but honey when it comes to resale time, believe me the East Side's the one that always moves
What do you get on the West Side
(contemptuously) Madonna and Sean
between Sly and Billy and Christie, 've shown every apartment on the Upper East Side
Everybody lives here
Mick, Gloria and Barbara Wa-Wa
Even Klaus von Bulow buys his fresh fruit from the Korean on Madison
It's so expensive and it's just like the ones on Eighth Avenue but it's an attitude is all, you pay for attitude (pointing to a walk- in closet) two walk-in closets
upstairs on the roof you lot a health club
massage, sauna, jacuzzi, sunlights, best schools in the city, cute boy like you gotta think of a ladyfriend when you're finished wolfing around -- ('course 'm taken) oak strip floor
my husband can get you a 10% mortgage
'd do it myself if we weren't into four other deals already
so
(beat) got a four o'clock and a five
one of them's an all-cash type, Monique something or other
guarantee you this place is history tomorrow
Bud looks around
The city at his feet
Lost in thought
Sylvie has to call him out of it: "honey
-- The meter's running
Anybody home
" All right
Offer 950
Sylvie tries to play it cool, her expression conveying a somewhat stunned look at the speed and certainty of the response
think you gotta deal, honey
you sure you don't wanna see somethin'  got on Sutton Place
It's a million and a half but
Nah
this is it
home
Looking it over, proud
The music is geared to speed, money, triumph and just plain material fun
'  - / In its first stage, Darien supervising
It's expanse of white walls devoid of mouldings, a blank plaster canvas
The city views are great, the apartment identical to hundreds of other cookie cutter condos
Several young artists are working on a neo-classical mural on the long side of the living room
They are colorfully dressed, listening to a tape while they work
carpenter who looks like a member of Duran Duran is installing a pair of old columns from Urban Archaeology on either side of the entrance to the living room while another fits a brass sink into an antique sideboard which has been turned into a bar
'  - / - Living room furniture arrives
fantail shrimp chaise from Art Furniture's "Sushi Collection" arrives, along with an enormous sofa encased in an ecru linen slipcover made deliberately baggy and tied on with rows of self bows on each end, several faux Etruscan pots wired up as lamps, a poured concrete coffee table that looks like it came from Pompeii, and a hand-painted floor cloth instead of a rug for the bleached floor with the stencilled border
Darien sitting in a fantastical adirondack chair made from gnarled branches, amused by Bud's reactions to the furniture
The kitchen has the latest compact computer dishwasher and compact microwave, garbage compactor, and sinks with infrared controls
brief food montage gives us a sense of the modernist approach to food and its preparation: 1) Darien hones the knives on the electric knife sharpener as 2) Bud uses a stainless steel Cape Cod oyster opener to work on two dozen oysters
3) at the same time working on the automatic vinaigrette mixer, the phone ringing to the tune of Mozart's "Jupiter"
(picking it up) Yes
no

Convert the bonds right
and check the price in Tokyo at 8:00  time
Thanks
4) As he starts his pasta sauce flame an his 'Reilly fat- free grill with a flexible neck fire starter
5)  freshly heated roll pops out of a hanging space-saving toaster, as Darien works the electric pasta maker while melting the frozen ice cream cartons in the microwave
6) Bud manages to sneak a kiss an her lips humming the bars from Verdi's "Rigoletto" as he works the piece de la resistance--the automatic sushi maker
7) Dinner is finally served on a demolished dinner table
Red wine, pasta, sushi
it looks perfect, lit by candlelight, the view of the city below
isn't it perfect
too perfect
let's not even eat
Let's just watch it and think about it
(pause) -
'  - Bud goes over a stack of bills with something approaching concern as the gothic oak refectory table which seats 20 is carried in, followed by a Jean Michel Basquiat featuring a skull on a rough board
Darien instructs the movers to place an important pair of satinwood Art Deco armchairs upholstered in buttery suede (last Saturday's auction purchase for $20,000) at either end of the titanic sofa
No vestige is left of the cookie cutter space we first saw
Walls have been removed, mouldings and architectural found objects added, imitation rare woods, marbles and frescos have been created from nothing by the magic hands of the tromp l'oeil crew
The point is, decorating can transform
- The look of the place is evocative of ancient times, yet sumptuous
Darien and Bud sink into the bales of down in the sofa and are dwarfed
She rests her head on a hand stencilled velvet Venetian throw pillow, looking like a Pre-Raphaelite madonna
terracotta pot with a spray of white phaleonopsis graces the coffee table
As the sun sets over the canyons of highrises, Bud walks around his new home totally in awe
This apartment, perfect in its restrained taste with all the "correct" flowers and objects, has nothing to do with him
Perhaps he can understand the state-of-the-art kitchen, the computerized telephone, stereo and light system, but he needs a set of instructions just to be able to switch on David Letterman
This apartment is Darien's fantasy, and Bud is merely the incidental client who paid for it
Most importantly to her, it is ready to be photographed by House and Garden
(dubiously looking at a rough plaster wall of fading fresco) You know, the elevator man couldn't believe  paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn
'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too
This apartment is already ahead of its time
call it the "demolished" look
They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets
lived in
Is that alright
'd love to have it in my portfolio
Sure
But your fee
considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable
As he nuzzles her neck, she feels threatened, stops
Let's get things straight, Bud
'm not going to take a cut
worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000
Curtains alone
'm kidding, 'm kidding, we're still young, Darien
So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative
After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years
before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside
As the kiss grows, his hands move into her nether regions
She looks at him, sober
Do you think you're ready
It's not me 'm worried about
You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left
You owe me,  want you, what else is there
but you, me, the world
(he folds back her palms in his) right here
make love to me
now
(more kissing) Stop me if 'm going too far
'll let you know
'  -  - Bud making love to Darien
Camara closing on them
Her face -- from his point of view
Her smile
His face -- looking down
Covered with sweat and passion
Is this real
Is this really real
'  -  - Bud walks out alone in his blue bathrobe on his parapet overlooking Central Park
The wind stirs his hair
The East and West sides of the park wrap the city in a diamond necklace of brilliant light
Bud stares down at the world
He has it all now
The money
The girl
The magic palace apartment
What more is there
Something
because Bud suddenly throws a wrenching dislocated look into himself that makes us wonder as he brushes his hand across his face and mutters to himself
Who am
There is no ready answer
As he finally turns and goes back inside and closes the door
'  - Darien lies curled in the bed, eyes open, looking at him
Come to bed, Bud
-    - Cocktail hour in the background, yuppies trying to score for the weekend
Bud on the phone, strained look transforming to a bright, upbeat personality as the phone is answered
Dixon
It's your lucky day
That's right
want to give you some stock and you don't have to put up a penny
: -   - small cabin in the mountains
-   - Whole earth furnishings
, a long-haired ski bum dropout listens skeptically
Sure, and 'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do  gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas
-    - No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around
'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut
'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made
'  - Roger listens on the phone
(off) and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger
(tentatively) All right, Bud
let's do it
look on his face
As if he knows he's making a fatal mistake
'  - (on the phone) it's easy Jack
On settlement day, you endorse a check to Blue Horseshoe Trading Company
Then send you your cut
Marv waves across the glass partition and knocks
But Bud waves him off, closing the blinds
(') that's the bottom line
And nobody gets hurt
Marv now walks it, exasperated
things are so bad, even the liars are complaining
And you're making money
So what gives
What's the bottom line
As he tries to peak at Bud's quotron screen, but Bud flicks it off, pissed
Hey, 'm tired of playing nurse to you all the time, alright
Do your own home work
Marvin abruptly walks out, "asshole
"
Bud books the order for Morning Star Corp --  -- 50,000 June options
- The    gets Bud's order, hands a ticket to a  who dashes off across the exchange floor, and over to a  who starts to execute the order
on the broad tape
As Bud's large buy order flickers across it --  -- 50,000 June options
-
- sits before a computer routinely tracking all of the exchange floor trading
He runs a check on a transaction
Computer Screen -- The same numbers and letters are seen that just flickered across the broad tape
Bud's buy
The clerk swivels his chair to a second computer and punches up data
appears behind him, leaning over his shoulder, and wears an
The clerk vacates his seat to the man with the badge, who now takes over
'  - Bud is in silk boxers on the phone, number crunching on the computer, foot pounding to a music beat on the stereo, while his telex spews out overnight currency data
Darien in the background lies in bed in panties reading Vogue
(into the phone) Buy me 20 June Euro Dollar CDs
Twenty March gold and sell 10 September Deutsch marks
That's right
He hangs up, back to the computer a growing look of excitement and revelation in his eyes
On the computer screen we see a break up Of Bluestar Airlines -- its assets and liabilities
Bud hits the command key, printing it out
He's exuberant
Bud,  hate to tell you this but you're a genius
(to Darien) Darien
lightning has struck
The lightbulb has been invented
Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching
(grumpy) are you going to trade all night again
You got to go to work in a couple of hours
You think 'm gonna broker the rest of my life
'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker
Bud dances over to the bed turning the stereo down on his way
love you, baby
Did  tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours
Get in bed
'ever hear of the sixty hour work week
You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much
Bud grabs a bottle of Ferrier off the night table and drinks
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's
never had it like you when  was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know
Your dad took care of you might've been rich when  was a kid
but my father lost all his money
in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track
He was a lousy gambler
(teasing) that changes all my plans, thought you were loaded
(laughs woefully) So did , till  hit 19 and found had all the royal habits and no throne
Mom got by but  had to go to work just like you
Only the skills  had were shopping and making friends
So
that's why do what  do, what makes you tick, Buddy
Fear
The fear of being poor guess, just like you, Darien
But that's all gonna change sweetheart
'm catching the express
(making love to her) and you're going along for the ride
'   ( - 4) - salon interior
Gekko on a couch reading, with eyeglasses, a stack of financial reports
Alex is on the phone, Susan, and others accompanying the caravan on a business trip
Bud is excited
Bluestar's an unpolished gem, Gordon, right out of the garbage half assed management being decimated by a price war they can't win
But the gates at LaGuardia alone can bail us out, it's worth 25 bucks a share if it's worth a dime
They're ripe to fall
Gekko, the poker player, hasn't seen enough cards
Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati
Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers
Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves
This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension
That buys us a lot of credibility
(Gordon looks up, interested) and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker
(interrupting, on the phone) Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it
You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes
(back to Bud) You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess
(deadly serious) Gordon what  want--and  never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this
want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work
It's gonna make us a fortune
(to Susan) 'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline
It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do  need this dink airline for
'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake
Gordon,  worked at Bluestar, know my way around,  have friends there
inside
(getting the drift) What does that mean
(playing out his ace) The three unions
It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value
, if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air
What makes you think you can
can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me
and my father can be a big help in getting cuts
(pause) Alright
Susan, get Buckingham on the box
want him to look at it
And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen
(smiles wickedly, back to Bud) So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer
tell me more
'  - Bud, in high gear, all smiles, expensive Armani suit, opens the door
His father stands before him, looking like a man on his way to the dentist
Dad, well come on in
Everybody's here
We couldn't start the show without you
Wide-eyed, Carl follows Bud through the foyer, taking in the furnishings, paintings, antiques
(under his breath) Well 'll be a lousy Republican
(overhears him) decorate for Democrats too, lots of them
(she extends her hand and gives him a warm smile) 'm Darien Taylor
(sardonically) know
You're one of the art works that go with the apartment
(softens a little) Pretty creative
Doesn't look anything like the place my son bought a few months age
Listen,  hope you'll come here often, and under less formal circumstances
Halfway won over Carl enters the living room where Darien has set up a table with miniature gourmet pizza, etc
The atmosphere is strained, the camps separated
Gekko stands by the bar, conferring with his lawyer, Harold Salt
Darien walks over to the couch with drinks for the Ixtax Union Reps:  ,  Leader, a rugged silver-haired uniformed pilot;  ,  Rep, hard looking, 40ish flight attendant
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants
met them before you were born
They exchange nods
And 'd like to introduce you to Mr
Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr
Salt
pleasure to meet you, Mr
Fox
Carl stares at Gekko, sizing him up
'd be proud to have a son like Bud
He's got a great future ahead of him
Carl looks to his fellow union representatives, then to Gekko
(gesturing at Salt) thought this was an informal meeting
What's he doing here
(dismissing him) Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you
(looks at his watch) Of course
Salt gathers his jacket to leave, as Gekko and Carl eye one another, tentatively
please help yourselves to some food
: The food is half consumed
Gekko addresses the union leaders
Look,  have no illusions about winning a popularity contest with any of you
was roasted the other night, and a friend of mine asked-- why are we honoring this man--have we run out of human beings
His joke breaks the ice; they laugh, except for Carl
(') It's not always the most popular guy who gets the job done
You got losses of 20 to 30 million dollars, dividends cut to zero, you're getting squeezed to death by the majors
Present management may not be the worst scum of the earth, but they're the ones who've put you on a kamikaze course, and pretty soon everybody's going to be scrambling for the parachutes
Only there aren't enough to go around
Management has them
You don't
If they throw Bluestar into Chapter 11--which  think they will--then they can use bankruptcy laws to break your unions and your contracts and throw you guys off the property
We hear a loud crunching sound as Bud's father bites into a roll, glaring at Gekko
(pilot) With all due respect, Mr
Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing
Cause  have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again
What do you say we cut to the chase
'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut
Carl drops his fork on the plate
Gekko goes on
And seven more hours a month
Toni Carpenter and Duncan Wilmore exchange questionable looks
What kind of time frame are we talking about here
Give me a year
If we're still losing money, the reductions stand
If however, we move into the black, return part of the givebacks, salaries go back to present levels, and
(a beat) we institute an employee profit sharing program with stock
You'll own part of the airline
Carpenter and Wilmore react with surprise, it's obvious they weren't expecting the profit sharing part
Bud smiles at Darien and looks to his father, who examines a sushi roll before putting it back
Are you prepared to put that in writing
'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days
What's your marketing strategy
How do you plan to return us to profitability
Why don't  give Bud an opportunity to answer that
Darien and Carl turn to Bud, who puts down his wine glass
Thank you Mr
Gekko
First of all want you to know my door will always be open to you cause  know from my Dad it's you guys that keep Bluestar flying
One -- Modernize
Our computer software is weak, we update it, we squeeze every dollar out of each seat and mile flown
You don't sell a seat to a guy for $89 when he's willing to pay $389
Effective inventory management through computerization will increase our load factor by 5 to 20%, that translates to approximately 50 to 200 million dollars in revenues; the point is, we can beat the majors at a price war
Two -- Advertising -- more, more, and aggressive, attack the majors
Three -- expand our hubs to Atlanta, North Carolina and Dallas, reorganize all our feeder schedules, think Big -- guys, we're going after the majors
The men are visibly shaken by Bud's determination
(looking for reactions) Cards are on the table
What do you think
(restrained, hopeful) If you mean what you say,  think we're in the ball park
'll take it to my people
(approvingly) You've sketched some broad strokes
'd like to see the fine print
But so far so good
Gekko looks to Carl Fox who, putting down knife and fork, breaks his silence
guess if a man lives long enough, he gets to see everything
And mean everything
What else do you have in your bag of tricks, Mr
Gekko
Bud tenses, looking at his father
Gekko ignores the innuendo and replies softly
Frankly, Carl,  can't see giving much more
If you have any suggestions 'll be glad to listen
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know
(smiling) beg your pardon
Is that a proverb
(smiling) No, it's a prophecy
The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time
The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions
(looking at Wilmore and Carpenter) know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners
He don't give a damn about Northstar or us
Now, wait a minute, Dad
(shrugs, keeping his composure) Sure
What's worth doing is worth doing for money
It's a bad bargain where nobody gains
And if this deal goes through, we all gain
Carl throws down his napkin, rises from the chair, looks at the others
(looks at Bud) 'Course my son did work three summers as a baggage handler and freight loader
With those qualifications, why should  doubt his ability to run an airline
There is frozen silence at the table
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground
that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum 'll take one over a rat any day
Carl turns and leaves
Bud glances at Gekko, reading his piercing look
He hurries after his father
- Bud catches up to Carl, waiting for the elevator, hammering him
(seething) Congratulations
You did a great job of embarrassing me in there-- not to mention yourself
Save the "workers of the world unite" speech for next time Dad,  heard it too much growing up
You're gonna get axed Dad, no two ways about it, you and the whole airline are going down the tubes, you hear me, just like Braniff, you don't have a chance in hell, and if it isn't Gekko it's gonna be some other killer
- Carl steps into the elevator, Bud follows
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's
He's using you
Only you're too blind to see it
No, what  see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim
(lamentably) Boy, if that's what you think, must've really screwed up my job as a father
- Bud and Carl exit the elevator and head across the luxury lobby
(') as far as being axed, 'm still here and as long as  am,  have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members  represent
(pleading now) Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men
you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad
Don't do it to 'em
Give it a chance
Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad
Please
'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, 'm going to lie to them
Your men
All my life "your men" have been able to count on you
Why is it that you've never been there for me
They head through the doors, out onto the street
- Bud following Carl
And what if you're wrong
What if one day, the sun didn't rise in the East and birds didn't fly South in winter and for once in your life your compass was off
Huh
He grabs Carl by the arm, stopping him
(') Would you be willing to wreck your men's future
My future
Please
Dad
Think
Be practical, for a change
'm asking you, 'm fucking begging you
Bud lets go of Carl's arm
Carl looks at his son, seeing the desperation
Sadness and confusion take hold of him
don't sleep with no whore and don't wake up with no whore
That's how  live with myself, Buddy don't know how you do
(a beat) hope 'm wrong, 'll let them decide for themselves, that much promise you
He walks away
Bud watches him go, knows he has won
'  - Bud, increasingly frazzled and determined, dark circles under his eyes paces with the phone
(his secretary) Mr
Dixon Brandt on 3
(wearily switching over) What's up Dixon
(stopping, focusing) Calm down
What are you talking about
: '  -   - Dixon, the rich man's son and ski bum, is yelling on the other end of the line
this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock  bought
(nervous) What'd you tell him
told him  was in the bathroom and 'd call him right back
What the hell was  supposed to say Buddy, you got me into
Look Dixon, calm down
It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right
And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy
Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment
What if he asks where  got the money
Tell 'em your father gave it to you
What if they call him
They won't
That's not their jurisdiction
You sure
Yes
Read the Constitution, it's all in there
And remember--you don't know anything, nothing
don't know anything
Good
Then call him back
And call me back
Don't worry
He hangs up, a worried expression, Marv entering to break his concentration
Hey you hear the news
just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe
" Yuk yuk
(icy) Didn't  tell you to knock before you came in here
Hey the door was open
Then get out and close it behind you
(pause) You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy
That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours
Get the hell out
Marv slams the door on his way
-    - Long shot of the towering stone structure
tall angular figure crosses through the glass doors with a bulky folder under his arm
- The man flashes his  to a   who buzzes him through the gate
He walks towards us and we see he is the familiar tall, baby-faced  from the
Options Watch Office
he gets in an elevator
- He walks into the office of a
balding sharp-featured man in a drab suit with bags of hard work under his eyes looks up as the young investigator places the large file in front of him
'  - Bud enters, preoccupied
Barnes is nervous
So what's the problem
(whispers) got a strange call from the
They asked to see my records
Bud, this is a heavy
(shrugs) Relax Roget (French pronunciation) You're 82M in the account numbers and 'm the Invisible Man
they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything
we're invulnerable on this
Alright
just wanna slow down Bud
no more calls for awhile, no lunches
we suspend our business, alright
Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool
young lawyer pops his head in the room
Rog, come on, bring the cost report
They started
(exits) (standing, to Bud) Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal
We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come
(surprised) He never told me
You're just the President of the company, what do you know
Come on
As they walk out
- Smoky, coffee cups and food
, ,   , sleeves rolled up, ties askew
blackboard with Bluestar's assets diagrammed combat mood in the room
Bud walking in, feels vaguely worried, something is not quite right
You guys know the new chief of Bluestar
Bud Fox
They nod vaguely respectful but Bud's obviously a figure head to them, takes a seat off to the side
The bull-like , Vietnam vet, in shirt and suspenders, is on the attack against the stuffier Commercial Bankers
Look guys, what's the problem, let's for the kill
Gekko's got 12% and climbing plus the unions are in his pocket for now, everybody on the street knows the stock's in play (overlapping voice: up 2 1/4 since the open) by next week the street's gonna own Bluestar and management won't be able to do anything but poison their own pill
Why are you guys dicking around
Is the bank financing in place or are we gonna have more and more meetings
Our firm's gonna guarantee 25% of the total debt structure in long-term junk bonds, now you guys either sign this piece of paper right now or we're gonna pull and head for another bank for the 75
(older man, appeasing) look, we have 30 banks ready to participate in a 4 year revolving credit line but we have to have your assurance to pay back most of the loan in the first 6 months, and the only way
(intermittently interrupting) 30 banks, isn't that wonderful
you got it, no problem
(insistent) and the only way we can see this happening is liquidating the hangars and the planes
Can you people guarantee that
Bud freezes where he sits
it all comes crashing down in a milli-second on that word "liquidate" -- shock now spreading on Bud's face
Guaranteed
No sweat
we already got the Bleezburg brothers lined up to build condos where the hangars are, we can lay off the planes with Mexicana, who are dumb enough to buy 'em and Texas Air is drooling at my kneecaps to get the slots and the routes
What's the problem
it's done
(passing a paper to the commercial banker) This is the pricetag on the 737s, the gates, the hangars, the routes, we got it all nailed right down to the typewriters
Bud sits there numbly, a sickening feeling taking hold of him as the camera and music track and trap him tighter and tighter
The lawyers' voices distorting in the background
'course the beauty of it is the overfunded pension fund
Gekko gets the 75 million in there
Fifty million buys him the minimum annuities for 6,000 employees and he walks away with the rest
All in, he'll net 60 to 70 million
Not bad for a month's work
(to Bud) Your man did his homework, Fox, you're gonna have the shortest executive career since the Pope who got poisoned
now he'll really start believing he's "Gekko the Great
" - '  - Bud walks intently past the receptionist and down the long white marble hall
'  - Natalie is on the phone
Bud marches past her desk
Yes, he wants to change that appointment to
(cupping the receiver) Bud--you can't go in there
He's in a meeting
He ignores her and throws open Gekko's door
'  - Gekko is talking with the  and  from the Bluestar deal, as Bud barges in
(looks up) didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning
'm sorry, this can't wait
Gekko stares at him with piercing eyes
Will you gentlemen excuse us for a few minutes
The lawyers and bankers get up and discreetly leave the room
Gekko waits for them to go, turns back to Bud
What the hell do you want
found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar
Why
Gekko is taken by surprise
Last night  read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot
Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio
You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around
Not upside down
You used me
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport
fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place
Why do you need to wreck this company
Because it's wreckable
took another look and  changed my mind
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go
My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years gave 'em my word
(hard) It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation
(loosening) Bud, you're still going to be president
And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man
With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end
How many yachts can you waterski behind
How much is enough
Buddy, it's not a question of enough
It's a zero sum game, sport
Somebody wins and somebody loses
Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another
Like magic
That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago
could sell it today for $600,000
The illusion has become real
And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it
Capitalism at its finest
(again) How much is enough Gordon
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars
One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what  do -- stock and real estate speculation
It's bullshit
Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth
create nothing;  own
We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip
(picking one up) We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it
(crosses to Bud) you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy
It's the free market
You're one of us now
take advantage of it
You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me
got things to teach you
Obviously
As he puts his arm around Bud, leading him to the door
Believe me, Buddy,  was gonna discuss this with you at the right time
Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight
Bring Darien
(at the door, confused, drained) can't make it tonight
Are you with me Buddy
At the door, a look of unmistakable power
and danger
want you with me
(waits) 'm with you Gordon
He walks out the door, the misery he is in washing his brow
(to Natalie) be another minute, Natalie
As he crosses back to the coffee table and punches up a phone number
This is Gordon Gekko
Now
(a beat, with controlled rage) want zip-locked mouths on Bluestar, or 'm gonna personally come down there and rip out your fucking throats
- Bud walks out, heading up the street, absent amid the scurrying mid-day hordes tearing up the street for the loot inside
'  - Darien approaches, carrying groceries, enters the building
'  - Bud is slumped on the couch, a spent bottle of tequila in front of him
Outside the twilight is quickening into night, shadows, scurrying across the unlit room
for the first time we see him sucking on a cigarette
Darien opens the door and freezes, surveying the living room
broken vase on the carpet, a curtain ripped off a window, a painting upended, a chair overturned, selected but not frenzied damage
Bud
What's going on
She puts down the grocery bags, frightened
've been played like a grand- piano--by the master, Gekko the Great
and today was the big crash
Liquidation sale
He's gonna carve Bluestar into little pieces and sell it all off
Darien registering this, is picking up pieces of the broken vase
'm sorry
was afraid something like this could happen
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped handed it to him on a silver platter
told my father and those people
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision
(evenly) 'm not gonna let it happen Darien
She stops, lights a cigarette, growing concern
Don't cross Gordon
He'll crush you
You've worked hard to get where you are
If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing
At least  wouldn't be pulling the trigger
She sighs
comes over, tries to shake some sense into him
Are you mad
Why are you doing this
We're so close, the town is going to be ours
Don't throw away your future Bud
can stay with the brokerage firm
And you're doing fine
We can survive without Gordon Gekko
(pointed) 'm not looking to just survive
've been doing that all my life
(getting the drift) What the hell's that supposed to mean
Darien moves out from his approximate circle, wrestling with what she wants to say
until she turns and says it
That if you make an enemy of Gordon Gekko,  won't be there to stand by you
Bud is stunned
and hurt
You really mean that
(lashing out) What'd he promise you
To take you public
guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, 'm not such a hot investment anymore
You're just the best money can buy, Darien
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me
Look in the mirror before
(glaring at her) 'm looking
and  sure don't like what  see
She collects her things and walks to the door
Fair enough
but it's not that simple, Bud
When  was down and had nothing, it was Gordon who helped me
He got me all my clients -- you among them
(snaps her fingers) and he can take it away like that
(a beat) You may find out one day -- that when you've had money and lost it, it's worse than never having had it at all
Bud steps across to her in a rage
That's bullshit
Step out that door, 'm changing the locks
She opens the door saddened
You may not believe this Bud but really do care for you
think we could've made a good team
but that's how it goes
Get the hell out
She does
Bud stares at the closed door, mute, numb, totally devastated
the loss is not just Darien, it is total
He looks at his face in the reflection of a wall mirror
'  -  - Waiting for the elevator
Darien also looks at herself a beat in the hall mirror
She's crying
Then she steels herself and enters the elevator
'  - The same realtor, SYLVIe , who sold him the place, is back
The phone is ringing, unanswered
well, the market's dead, hon, even the rich are bitching, nothing's moving except termites and cockroaches, and with my commission being what it is
(cutting her off) Save the rap, just sell it -- fast
He's in his socks, unshaven, smoking, he looks like he's been on a bender for the weekend
The phone stops ringing
He turns and walks into the bedroom, slamming the door behind him
'  - Bud walks in, a different, more serious look in his eye, purposeful
Past  and  at the outer desk
They stop what they're doing and look up at him surprised
Bud
Where you been the last two days
(ignoring the tone in her voice) Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent
He notices her face, something's wrong
Your mom just called, Mr
Fox
Your father
he
(sensing it) What
What happened
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital
(runs out) Oh Christ
'  - Bud weaving fast through traffic
- Bud races past the nurses' desks and down the hallway
- Bud's  is outside with Dominick Amato and another neighbor just visiting, bringing candies
(lighting a cigarette) Mom
How is he
(shaken) he was complaining about chest pains at work
Next thing  know he collapsed
Oh Buddy, talk to him, he's so stubborn
(to Bud) don't worry, he's got another 20 years in him
He's a tough ol' nut, your Dad
- The blinds are drawn
His Dad lies there, tubes down his nose, hooked up to an  unit and monitors
Bud comes over
Carl, glassy-eyed, significantly frailer, nods to him
It's obvious that more damage was done than Bud expected
Mom comes into the room with him, stands there
Hiya Dad
(sits, smiles) What was it
Mom talked too much or was it her spaghetti
mean pasta
(Mom bringing a handkerchief to her eyes) told you never to lift a 747 by yourself
Carl, smiles weakly, on pain killers
Bud pulls out a cigarette
He fumbles with it before putting it away, trying to keep a gruff tone between them
you even got me smoking now
second one Dad, you're pushing your luck,  guess you know that
guess you gotta pull through this one Dad
for mom, for me
guess  never told you but
love you Dad,  love you more than  ever
(begins to weep) didn't mean those things said to you
you're a hero all the way Dad, you're a rock
the best
The words seem to come flowing out of Bud as Carl's eyes fill with tears
and you were right about Gekko
He's one son of a bitch
through and through
Carl stares at him, beginning to understand
(') He's gonna break up Bluestar
Carl reacts violently in his eyes but Bud soothes him
in dead earnest, trying to be deliberate and clear in his meaning
(') but  gotta plan Dad, it can work,  can save the airline, know you got no reason to believe me but  want you to trust me need to talk to the unions
Can speak for you
Carl's eyes
(') Your words, not mine
(weakly) You speak for me, son
- Gekko and Darien are seated together in the back row
Darien looks serious and distracted in spite of all the excitement going on around her
It is the big spring Impressionist sale and all the major players, or their representatives are here
Gekko is bidding
Look over there sunshine
'm up against Richard Feigen
He is on a roll, electric
As the price mounts and surpasses the two million dollar mark, Gekko rises and walks down the side aisle to the front, never taking his eyes away from the auctioneer
He stands agressively, arms akimbo, in a nose to nose confrontation
Once, twice, three times
Sold to Mr
Gordon Gekko
- They walk the sunny streets, a jubilant Gekko, savoring his triumph, grabs Darien's arm
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle
Caviar
Champagne
Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine
(indignantly) Those days are over, Gordon
They were over a long time ago
(condescendingly but paying little attention to the rebuff) Can't blame me for trying
You look as beautiful as that painting just bought
He pats her on the back in a preprietary fashion
(') (mockingly) So what's the problem Sunshine
You look like Black Thursday
Bad case of puppy love
(indignant) It's not puppy love, Gordon
Anyway, Buddy and  are splitting up
(off handed) Sorry to hear that
thought the kid had staying power
It's over you, Gordon
(cooly) You told him about us
No, are you crazy
And  don't want him ever to know
Do you understand
She moves closed and takes Gordon's hand
(') want to ask you a big favor, Gordon
Please drop the Bluestar deal
(stroking her face) Now tell me, why would  want to do that
Because  don't want to see him hurt
Don't worry Sunshine
Bud and  had a little talk
We came to an understanding
(takes her hand paternally) want you to go back to him
Soothe him
Help keep his head straight
Okay
can't
and  won't
Come on, we both like Buddy
But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top
It doesn't fit
Maybe it does
Don't patronize me Gordon
You and  are the same, Darien
We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows
You're really twisted, Gordon
You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package
Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own
Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything 'm a part of
Darien's eyes cloud over
the look of a scared child being banished by her father
Then
know
but maybe, just maybe Gordon, 'm good enough so  don't need you anymore
She walks away
'  -  - Bud is seated at a corner table with the : Duncan Wilmore,   and Toni Carpenter, rep; also jointed by machinists, Dominick Amato and Charley Dent, sitting in for his father's union
the stock's at 19 1/4 and it's going up
Gekko figures by breaking up Bluestar, it's worth at least $30 a share
That means he'll buy up to 23 or 24 and still think he's making money
How do you know that the stock is going to go up
(pointedly) You really don't want to know any more than that, Mr
Wilmore
Let's just say  have some friends
(getting his drift) Okay
What happens then
When the stock hits 23, you guys go to Gekko and lower the boom
Once he learns he has no union concession, he's going to head for the hills
He'll sell everything he's got
Yeah
But who's going to buy then and what's to prevent another shark from coming along and devouring us
-    - Bud, Duncan Wilmore, Toni Carpenter, Dominick and Charley, an unlikely looking group in the plushness of the apartment lobby
We have an appointment to see Mr
Wildman
- Lofty windows overlooking the Park, an impeccably-decorated apartment with coffee and rolls laid out, a young quietly moving around
Bud and the others are on sofas around the imposing figure of Wildman in a chair across
Sir Lawrence, what would you say to owning Bluestar Airlines with union concessions--at $18 a share
and in the process hanging Gordon Gekko out in the wind to twist
Sir Lawrence leans back in his chair, equably
might be very interested, but why
Why you mate -- how'd you get mixed up with Gekko
He doesn't know the difference between raiding and insider trading
do
The  does
hope you do
Let's just say Mr
Gekko and  have a conflict of interest
want to see this airline work
(pointing to the documents in front of Wildman) the figures here show it can
(to the others) and you're prepared to take these large salary cuts
we are
But we want a contract agreement -- iron-clad -- that if you buy it, you can't break it up
(hands behind his head) 'm still listening
'  - Bud hurries in, past Marv on the phone with an irate customer
Well, if that's how you feel--the hell with you too
And strong letter to follow
He slams the phone down
You don't have to agree with me, Marv; but  think 've been a bit of a schmuck lately
(beat, waits) (off the cuff) agree
Go thou and sin no more
want to make it up to you
Bluestar, put all your clients in it
(animated, grabs the phone) Thanks, buddy, buddy, 'm back
Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders
Bud intersecting Lou Mannheim smoking a cigarette and having a hard time walking
Bluestar, Mr
Mannheim
Put all your clients in it
Davls looks gravely at Bud
don't know where you get your information, son, but  don't like it
The only reason 'm gonna do it is
need the money, that's the problem with money--it makes you do things you don't want to do
Bud hears him, walks on
(into phone) Miss Bloom, Marvin
You got cancer in your portfolio, but  got the cure

Listen  need a favor and it's a quick scalp for you
Two hundred thousand at 19 1/2; can you position it in one of your equity funds

Hold on

Immediately goes back to the other line

He rises from his desk and crosses the busy news floor, over to his
Bluestar's in play

He elbows his way over to a , handing him the ticket

Tell everyone to dump
Marv nods, and rushes away
Bud crosses past Mannheim's office
Get out of Bluestar
In background Marv is spreading the word, brokers frantically grabbing phones, calling clients to sell

Who the hell's out there
What are the arbs saying
It's gotta be a big hitter
They don't know what's going on
Everybody and his mother is buying
Natalie enters the room, flustered
Mr
Gekko, there's a whole bach of people from Bluestar Airlines outside demanding to see you
What the hell do they want
(
) 'd be happy to tell you
As Duncan, Toni Carpenter, Dominick Amato, Charley Dent and other assorted   march into the room
Gekko is taken by surprise, but stays calm
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here, (hits his heart) you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar
You guys must know something nobody else knows
If those are my plans, it's the first 've heard of it
Would you care to put that in writing
'd like to remind you we already have an agreement, which  expect you to honor
Well in that case,  hope you have your pilot's license
Don't worry, Gekko, we wouldn't let the engines fall out of the plane
(regretfully) But the reservations systems can get awfully screwed up, if we're not paying attention
And a lot of baggage headed to St
Petersburg could easily find its way to Pittsburgh
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest
We'll take our chances
(tips his hat) Nice to see you again, Mr
Gekko
They file out of the room
The phone lines have lit up like a Christmas tree
Alex answers a call
(to Gekko) Fox says Bluestar just hit 23
What do you want him to do
(fractional pause, mad) Sell it all

Gekko's on the ropes--he's trying to sell, but there's not many takers, the stock's plummeting

Two beautiful women and an aide are with him
Well then
guess 'll have to carry him a few rounds before he drops
Switches lines, checking his quotron

Don't make a big deal
Buy it lightly on the way down

He looks at the Big Board--sees an drop to 17

Harold Salt, walking on egg shells, looks to Gekko, who sits with the phone receiver crooked to his neck
There's got to be a way out of this, Gordon
(livid, losing it) Yeah, Harold, why don't you dial 911
(into the receiver) Fox, where the hell are you

Because if you don't the only job you're going to get on the Street is sweeping it
You hear me, Fox-- : '  - Bud scribbling an order ticket, replies on the other end
(hard) You once told me don't get emotional about stock
Gordon, don't
The bid is 17 and going down
As your broker,  advise you to take it
Bud moves the phone away from his ear, at Gekko's cursing, and signs the ticket

Mannheim
Got out of Bluestar in time  hope
Mannheim stops, winds up
Bud impatient but polite

Without warning, he grabs Buddy roughly by the lapels and lets out his inner rage with a series of smacks and slaps across his face
(') You think you could've gotten this far this fast with anybody else
You think you could be out there dicking somebody like Darien
No, you'd be cold calling dentists and widows to buy twenty shares of some dog stock
took you in
nobody
opened doors for you
showed you how the system works
Gekko slapping him harder and harder, Buddy staggering with the blows, saying nothing, not defending himself
(') the value of information
How you get it
Anacott Steel, Brant Resources, Transuniversal, Fulham Oil
And this is how you pay back, you cockroach
gave you Darien, gave you your manhood
gave you everything
He backhands Bud across the face
Bud lies on the ground, spent, as is Gordon breathing hard
Bud gets to his knees, blood streaming from his nose, his suit muddied
Passersby look on, wondering
Gekko seems to relent, the rage going into hurt, remorse
He hands Bud a handkerchief
Bud staunches the flow of blood from his nose
(') (softly, innocently) You could've been one of the great ones Bud
look at you and see myself
Why
Bud looks at Gordon, torn by mixed emotions: the bonds they share and the betrayal wrought
(shakes his head, thoughtfully) don't know
My Dad once told me, "money is something you need in case you don't die tomortow
" guess  realized 'm just Bud Fox
And as much as  wanted to be Gordon Gekko--'ll always be Bud Fox
He looks at Gordon, as if wanting to say more, but doesn't
In long shot, Gordon stands alone as Bud walks away
- The  looks askance
Bud, mud-splattered suit and bloody nose, walks straight past him thru the door
- Several well-heeled  look up from their haute cuisine, at the sight of Bud making his way toward the men's room
'  - Tight on Bud, staring at his reflection in the mirror, as he unbuttons his shirt, revealing adhesive tape swathed across his chest
Camera paces back as he winces when
and , the two investigators, rip the tape off his chest, retrieving a small tape recorder
Morrissey of the
rewinds the cassette
We hear Gekko's voice being played back on the tape, the mention of their deals
You did the right thing, Bud
Bud looks searchingly in the mirror
Faint comes up over the shot
'  - of the Broad Tape grows
Shots of Lou Mannheim, Lynch, Marv; silently looking up at the green fluorescent print-out
--
' , ,  ,    , : '  -  - Carl, dressed in a suit and tie, sits at the dining table, finished breakfast plates in front of him, refilling his coffee cup
Mom clearing off the table, anxious
As Bud walks in, wearing a suit and tie
He looks tired, beaten, the eyes lifeless, in a dark mood
(disapproving) don't wear that tie Buddy, it
She cuts off on Bud's look
Another cup of coffee
No, thanks, 'm nervous enough
(checks his watch) guess it's time to hit the road
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral
'  -   - Driving towards the Federal Courtrooms in Lower Manhattan
Busy traffic all around
(supportively) you told the truth, you gave the money back
All things considered-- in this cockamamie world--you're shooting par
you helped save the airline and the people at the airline are gonna remember you for it
if  was you, 'd think about that Bluestar job Wildman's offered you
Dad, 'm going to jail and you know it
(shaking his head, sober) Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so
It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you
stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others
you can do it, Bud, once you set your mind to something,  believe you can do anything in the world
Bud stares ahead, registering it
(nods, then) got any friends gonna be there
As he pulls the car into the curb
The Federal Building, in approaching , looms large before them
(looks around, ironic) Like who
Who really wants to know a convicted felon
don't even like myself
Carl knows something Bud doesn't
Darien is standing there waiting as they approach the main entrance
Bud seeing her, suddenly stunned
His -- easing along the curb
So, why don't you get out here and go in with your friend, 'll park the car
Try to be cool, okay
last look with his father
-   -   - Bud getting out
crossing to Darien
pause
(nervous) Hi
Why
figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own
Bud looking at her, moves closer, longing and hope and happiness have returned to his dull eyes
and forgiveness, the greatest of all
They embrace
Bud will never know about her past, nor need he
The camera leaving them on a slanting, circular crane, lifting past the Federal Building to a panorama of Wall Street in all its icy magisterial splendor
and thus ends our tale
