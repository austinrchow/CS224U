"Gods and Monsters", shooting draft, by Bill Condon "  " Screenplay by Bill Condon Based on the novel "Father of Frankenstein" by Christopher Bram May 30, 1997 : " " : Writhing pools of light and dark, out of which emerge images from "The Bride of Frankenstein," directed by James Whale
Elsa Lanchester, as the Monster's Bride, looks up, down, left, right, startled to be alive
The Monster stares at her
"Friend
" he asks, tenderly, desperately
-  ( & ) Lightning splits the black-and-white sky, revealing a single shattered oak in a desolate landscape
Below, a stumbles through the darkness, the top of his head flat, his arms long and heavy, his boots weighted with mud
Suddenly the storm fades
Light creeps into the scene, and color, as we  : melting into a hazy morning sky
In a box canyon off the coast highway, we see row after neat row of trailer homes, a makeshift village for beach bums
- opens his eyes
He is 26, handsome in a rough-hewn, Chet Baker-like way, with broad shoulders and a flattop haircut
He grabs a crumpled pack of Lucky Strikes, lights a bent cigarette
Clay stands and walks bare-assed across the single tin room, his head almost touching the ceiling
- Clay goes a few rounds with a weatherstained speed bag that's set up behind his trailer
- Clay towels off, glances at the morning paper
He moves aside a pile of paperbacks on a card table until he finds a calendar
His finger targets today's first appointment
"10
- 788 Amalfi Drive
" - Clay steps out of the trailer, clean-shaven and dressed in dungarees, a -shirt with a fresh pack of cigarettes flipped into one sleeve
He weight-lifts a secondhand mower onto the bed of his rusty pick-up
Clay climbs into the truck, slides the key into the ignition
It takes a few tries but the engine finally turns over
- Clay's truck sails down the road, "Hound Dog" blaring on the radio
-  - Sprinklers twirl on a grassy slope outside a rambling clapboard house
Below, a swimming pool forms a perfect rectangle of still water
title reads: 1957
The pick-up drives past
Clay parks in the back, hops out
- stands at a window, watching Clay unload his red power mower
-   - The shadow is a man with dove white hair, wearing a dress shirt and seersucker jacket
This is  , age 67
'd have more peace of mind if the live-in nurse were still here
She was nothing but bother
not like her, Mr
Jimmy not like her
We do better if you live-in again, Mr
David
In the dining room, visible through open double doors, , 55, speaks softly with the housekeeper,
She is a squat, muffin-faced Hungarian woman in her late 50s, dressed in black, her hair cinched in a tight bun
She speaks with a thick accent
You'll contact me if there's an emergency
Yes,  call you at this number
(calls out) Mr
Jimmy
More coffee
What
Oh yes
Why not
He moves into the dining room, sits opposite David
Isn't Hanna a peach
Hanna ignores him, returns to the kitchen
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe
If  take them,  spend the next day stupid as a stone
If  don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once -- Then take the pills
wanted to be alert for your visit today
Especially since  saw so little of you in the hospital
The remark hits its target
'm sorry, Jimmy
But with this movie and two difficult stars -- "The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars
" (too anxious to laugh) You remember how a production eats up one's life
Oh, David
There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty
(stands) You better go, my boy
You'll be late for that aeroplane
David extends his hand, but Whale draws him into a hug
As he starts out, David points to a framed painting
By the way,  like the Renoir
Thank you
(calls out) Goodbye, Hanna
Hanna runs out of the kitchen to escort David to the door
Whale drifts back to the window, watches as Clay revs up the lawnmower, creating a cloud of white smoke
We  : -  (1900) bean-pole child with flaming red hair ( at age 12) stares up at the coal smoke pouring from a seemingly endless row of chimneys
We're in Dudley, a factory town in the English Midlands region known as the Black Country
(
) Stop lagging behind, Jimmy
We'll be late for church
Yes, Mum
Whale runs to catch up to his six brothers and sisters
His father,  , frowns at the boy's prissy trot
Straighten up, son
Young Whale's movements thicken into a dim imitation of manly reserve
The Whale family marches up a steeply mounting street to Dixon's Green Methodist Church
'  -   - Whale's eyes tighten
He focuses on Clay Boone as he peels off his -shirt, revealing a tattoo on his upper right forearm
Hanna
Who's the new yardman
Bone
Boom
Something Bee hire him while you were in the hospital
He came cheap
Whale nods, chooses a walking stick
He emerges into the sunlight
'  - Whale moves jauntily onto the front lawn, singing to himself: The bells of hell go ting-a-ling For you but not for me
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling
Grave where thy victory
Whale steps up next to Clay
Good morning
(not looking up) Mornin'
My name is Whale
This is my house
Nice place
And your name is --
Boone
Clayton Boone
couldn't help but notice your tattoo
That phrase
Death Before Dishonor
What does it mean
Just that  was in the Marines
The Marines
Good for you
You must have served in Korea
Clay shrugs nonchalantly
Getting to be a warm day scorcher, as you Yanks call it
Yeah
better get on with my work
Whale clears his throat behind the back of his hand
When you're through, Mr
Boone, feel free to make use of the pool
We're quite informal here
You don't have to worry about a suit
Clay glances warily at Whale
No thanks
got another job to get to this afternoon
Whale holds Clay's look
Some other time, perhaps
Keep up the fine work
Whale heads off, smiling to himself
Pleased to be naughty again
'  -  - The room is filled with unframed canvasses, many of them copies of paintings by the Old Masters
Whale rolls out the easel, lifts a half-painted canvas into position
He stares at the blotches of color, trying to remember what he intended to paint
Whale pulls out a heavy volume on Rembrandt, opens to a black-and-white plate of "The Polish Rider
"  We  : -  -  (1908) rough pencil outline of the same painting
Whale, age 16, sits on his bed, ignoring the roughhousing of the three younger  who share the room
The door opens and Whale's mother  enters
Jimmy
The privy needs cleaning
have my class tonight
Both have Midlands accents, like head colds that flatten their speech
Whale holds up the sketch to show his mother
Don't get above yarself, Jimmy
Leave the drawring to the artists
Whale squeezes the pad behind the bed, jumps up
Quite so, mum
To the privy
And he heads cheerfully out of the room
His mother shakes her head
"Quite so
" (calls out) Jimmy Whale
Who are ya to put on airs
But Whale is already out the door
We  : '  -  - Whale studies his face in the mirror
He gives his white hair a few final licks with his silver-backed brush
'  -  - Whale comes in from the bedroom
There is iced tea, Hanna
Cucumber sandwiches
Yes, Mr
Jimmy
(smiles) An interview
After so many years
Very exciting
Don't be daft
It's just a student from the university
The doorbell rings
'  -   - Whale settles into his club chair and opens a book, pretending to read until Hanna ushers in the visitor
Mr
Kay, sir
(feigning surprise) Yes
Whale looks up at  , 22, a slim boy who rests his weight on one slouched hip, his arms twined behind him
There is a look of mild disappointment on Whale's face as he realizes that Kay is a baby poof
Ah, Mr
Kay
'd almost forgotten
My guest for tea
Whale stands and holds out his hand
Mr
Whale, this is such an honor
You're one of my favorite all-time directors
can't believe 'm meeting you
(gently, teasing) No
expect you can't
And this is your house
Wow
The house of Frankenstein
(looks around) thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa
One likes to live simply
know
People's movies aren't their lives
He suddenly growls out an imitation of Boris Karloff
Love dead
Hate living
Kay laughs, a high, girlish giggle
Whale fights a cringe with a polite smile
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours
"Bride of Frankenstein
" Is it now
Hanna
think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool
It's clear from Hanna's frown that she doesn't approve of the idea
Whale ignores her, turns back to Kay
Will that be good for you, Mr
Kay
Sure
(opens the back door) After you then
Whale inspects the boy from behind, noticing his wide hips and plumpish posterior
'  -  - Kay's hands flap animatedly as Whale leads him down to the pool
love the great horror films
And yours are the best
"The Old Dark House
"  "The Invisible Man
"  They look great and have style
And funny
Whale points to a small shingled house near the pool
This is the studio where  paint
Nice
(refusing to be sidetracked) And your lighting and camera angles
You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it
'  -   - Clay Boone gulps some water from the garden hose
He glances down at the pool, where Kay and Whale sit in cast-iron chairs
Time for you to leave
Clay turns to Hanna, who holds a tray loaded with finger sandwiches and a pitcher of iced tea
'm on my way
She doesn't move until Clay starts off
'  -  - Kay flips open his steno pad
So, Mr
Kay
What do you want to know
Everything
Start at the beginning
was born outside London, the only son of a minister who was a master at Harrow
Grandfather was a bishop
Church of
Church of Eng
Whale's tongue trips on the word, his voice suddenly drowned out by the blast of a factory whistle
We  : -  -  (1908) Fiery melt is poured into molds on the shop floor of a machine parts factory
, 16, grips the hot casting with tongs
His father , his face blackened with grime, hammers away at the flaws
heavy blow causes young Whale to drop the mold, prompting catcalls and sneers on the floor
There is a look of genuine fear in Whale's eyes as he looks up at his singed, beast-like father
We  : '  -  - Kay clears his throat softly
Mr
Whale
Whale smiles politely to cover his momentary disorientation
Yes
Your father was a schoolmaster
Of course
attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and  never made it
The Great War, you know
You had a Good War, but we had a great one
He glances to see if the boy smiles at the quip
You can't imagine what life was like after the Armistice
The twenties in London were one long bank holiday, a break from everything dour and respectable had a knack with pencil and paper, so  was hired to design sets for stage productions
Hanna comes down the path with the tray
She places it on the table
Thank you, Hanna
Very nice
Hanna remains planted next to the table
You can go now
She makes an audible sigh and starts back up the hill
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End"
Every experienced director turned it down, so offered myself, bullying and begging for the job
"Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it
It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"
Am  correct in assuming, Mr
Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures
Oh no,  want to hear everything
You made twenty pictures in all -- Twenty-one
The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking
The horror pictures were trifles
Grand guignol for the masses
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for
An abrupt look of anger flashes across Whale's face
am not dead yet, Mr
Kay
No
never said you were
Or will be soon
Kay leans over the steno pad, determined to be more worthy
So
"Journey's End" brought you to Hollywood -- Whale takes in the boy's blank, bored expression
He sighs
have a proposal, Mr
Kay
This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think
don't mind
Let's make it more interesting will answer any question you ask
But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing
Kay's mouth pops open
That's funny, Mr
Whale
It is, isn't it
My life as a game of strip poker
Shall we play
You're serious
Quite
Then the rumors are true
What rumors might those be
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal
homosexual scandal, you mean
For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks
Kay just sits there, squinting and grinning
You're a dirty old man
Whale tilts his head as if brushing off a compliment
Kay kicks off his penny loafers, bends over to remove his socks
You are kind to indulge your elders in their vices
As  indulge the young in theirs
Two pale feet emerge
Whale leans forward to examine them
He leans back again
No
There was no scandal
And he reaches into his coat for a cigar
Whale's hand trembles as he slices a hole at the base, then lights the cigar with a wooden match, sucking and rotating until the tip is roundly lit
My only other vice
suppose you'd like a fuller answer to your question
Kay nods
It will cost you your sweater
Kay hesitates a moment, then sets his pen aside to pull the sweater over his head, revealing a sleeveless -shirt
Too warm for a sweater, anyway
You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago
Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers
Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica
Kay stares at him in disbelief
George Cukor
Who made " Star Is Born"
never guessed
Take off your vest and 'll tell you a story
Kay plucks at his -shirt, glancing toward the house
Don't be shy
There's time to stop before you go too far
guess
Kay peels off the shirt and tosses it on his shoes and sweater
George is famous for his Saturday dinner parties
Great artists, writers, society folk, all rubbing elbows with Hollywood royalty
But how many of those oh-so-proper people know about the Sunday brunches that follow
Gatherings of trade eating leftovers, followed by some strenuous fun and frolic in the pool
(flicks an ash) If a goat like that can continue about his business, my more domestic arrangements could've raised very few eyebrows
The revelation seems to have left Kay a little shaken
he flips to a blank page
Can we talk about the horror movies now
Certainly, Mr
Kay
Is there anything in particular you want to know
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"
He glances down at his few remaining articles of clothing
Can that count as one question
Of course
can't believe 'm doing this
Kay stands to unbuckle his belt, glancing around the yard again
He unzips and steps out of his sharply creased flannel legs
His thighs are thin and pale
Just like going swimming, isn't it
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through
never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste
Okay
"Frankenstein
"  Tell me everything
Righto
Let me see
Whale swallows a wince, trying to block the pain pushing against his skull
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- mean badly, not baldly
was given the pick of stories being developed, and  picked that one
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look
My idea
Muchly
My sketches
Big heavy brow
Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century
As important as the Mona Lisa
You think so
That's very kind -- Whale clutches at the air, suddenly notices that his hand is empty
He looks down and sees the cigar on the flagstones
Boris Karloff
Where did you find him
Whale bends down to retrieve his cigar -- and the change of gravity drives a spike through his skull
Karloff, Mr
Whale
How did you cast him
Whale turns toward the froggy voice
Please
Excuse me
must go lie -- He forces himself up with one hand
Kay finally looks up, notices Whale's colorless lips and desperate eyes
Mr
Whale
Are you all right
just need to -- lie down
Studio
Daybed in studio
Whale lurches from the table
Kay jumps forward, catching him under an arm
Oh my God
What's wrong, Mr
Whale
Is it your heart
Head
Not heart
He leans against Kay, who leads him toward the studio
Forgive me
'  - Hanna runs down the path, clutching the front of her apron in two tight fists
'  -  - Hanna swings open the screen door -- and grimaces when she sees Kay in his BVDs
He is kneeling next to Whale, who is stretched out on the daybed
Water
Glasses at the sink
She goes to Whale, scooping different bottles from the pocket of her apron
Which ones
bring them all
Luminal
She empties a pill into her palm
Whale places it into his mouth and takes the glass of Water Kay passes over Hanna's shoulder
Whale swallows the pill, then glances up at Kay, feigning surprise
Mr
Kay
You're not dressed
Kay frantically crosses his arms over his chest and middle, turns to Hanna
was going to take a swim
'm sorry  spoiled it for you
You should probably go home
Right
Kay hurries outside to retrieve his clothes
Hanna undoes Whale's bow tie
She makes no attempt to be gentle
You must think 'm terrible, Hanna
do not think you anything anymore
Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys
Oh shut up
All we did was talk
My attack had nothing to do with him
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold
No
Let me lie here
Thank you
Hanna nods, moves to the door
Whale closes his eyes, breathes deeply, trying to block the throbbing  in his brain
We  : -  -  (1908) The noise is deafening -- the clank of chains, the screech of wheels and the endless banging of hammers
William Whale continues to knock away at the hot casting
The rhythmic sound blends into the insistent knocking of: which smashes against sheet metal
'  - Clay Boone's eyes dart open
(
) Boone
You awake
Eight o'clock
Fuck off
(
) You told me to get you up, asshole
baseball-capped head is visible through the louvered glass in the trailer's door
, 30, Clay's neighbor, squints to see inside
'm up
Thanks
Hasta la vista, Boone
And give the jail bait a squeeze for me
Clay glances over, seems surprised to see a naked back facing him on the bare mattress
Hey, um
Rose -- The girl stirs, turns to face him
She is 18 at most
Daisy
Huh
My name is Daisy
Time to go, Daisy
She presses her naked body against Clay's
You know
could help you fix up this place real nice
Clay takes a deep breath, trying to clear the gumminess from his brain
Don't you have to be somewhere
Like high school maybe
gave it up for Lent
Daisy smiles at her own joke
Clay frowns
Right
(jumps up from the bed) Time to hit the road, kid
'  -  - Whale ponders the half-painted canvas, clearly distressed by his lack of progress
The stillness is punctured by the sound of Clay's lawnmower being dragged up the brick steps
Whale smiles, puts down his brush
'  -  - Clay stops, turns around, feeling someone's eyes watching him
(
) (singing) The bells of hell go ting-a-ling
The mower slips out of Clay's hands momentarily
he looks around, spots Whale inside the studio
Everything alright, Mr
Boone
Just got away from me
Sorry to disturb you
The screen door squeaks open, clatters shut
leather slipper and rubber-tipped cane appear
Whale strolls into view, smiling
was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea
'd like it very much if you'd join me
stink to high heaven right now
The honest sweat of one's brow assure you  won't be offended
Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for two
Whale's cane trembles in his skeletal hand
His frailty chips away at Clay's resolve
Or would you prefer a beer
No
Iced tea's fine
Splendid
Clay hoses the crumbs of grass off his arms
He dries his hands and arms with his hat, then wads it up and stuffs it into his shirt to wipe out his armpits
'  -  - Clay stands at the screen door
Come in, Mr
Boone
Whale sits on a daybed, next to a pile of newspapers
He gestures at a wooden armchair across from him
My workshop, my studio
Hardly somewhere in which a sweaty workman should feel out of place
Clay glances at the unframed canvases on the wall and stacked in the corners
These are your paintings
What
Oh yes
Excuse me, but -- are you famous
You know what they say
If you have to ask -- 'm just a hick who cuts lawns
But some of these look familiar
They were familiar when  painted them
That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago
And that's a Rembrandt
They're just copies then
Gotcha
But before  retired, you might say had a brief time in the sun
Fame, as it were
Tell me, do you like motion pictures
Sure, everybody does
When  was a kid 'd go with my sister twice a week
Why
Were you an actor or something
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood
No,  was merely a director here
Yeah
What were some of your movies
This and that
The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures
Really
Clay sits up, surprised, skeptical and impressed all at once
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest
made only the first two
The others were done by hacks
Still
You must be rich
Making a couple of famous movies like those
Merely comfortable
Here's Hanna with our refreshments
Can you get the door
Clay jumps up to open the screen door
Hanna walks past, refusing to look at him
She sets the tray on a table very hard, ringing the glasses and silverware
How are you feeling, Mr
Jimmy
How is your mind today
My mind's lovely
And yours
Hanna flares her nostrils at him
You remember what the doctor tells us
Yes, yes, yes
merely invited Mr
Boone in for a glass of tea
We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard
am not forgetting your last brief chat
Just go
We can manage without you
Hanna stares up at Clay
He looks plenty big
You won't need my help if anything goes flooey
Go
She shakes her head and marches out the door
Clay returns to his chair and sits down again
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you
(smiles at Clay) Please, Mr
Boone
Help yourself
What did she mean by going flooey
returned recently from a stay in hospital
What was wrong
Nothing serious
touch of stroke
Clay nods, chugs his tea
When he lowers the glass, he finds the old man watching him
You must excuse me for staring, Mr
Boone
But you have a marvelous head
Huh
To an artistic eye, you understand
Have you ever modeled
You mean, like posed for pictures
Sat for an artist
Been sketched
(with a laugh) What's to sketch
You have the most architectural skull
And your nose
Very expressive
Broke is more like it
But expressively broken
How did it happen
Football in college
You went to university
Just a year
dropped out to join the Marines
Yes
You were a Marine
Whale's gaze deepens
He laughs lightly
apologize for going on like this
It's the Sunday painter in me
Of course  can understand your refusal
It's a great deal to ask of someone
You mean -- you really want to draw me
Indeed
'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head
But why
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him
And it's just my head you want
Nothing else
What are you suggesting
You'll charge extra if  include a hand or a bit of shoulder
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right
have no interest in your body, Mr
Boone
can assure you of that
Clay takes a moment to size up Whale -- whose innocent, slightly befuddled smile makes him appear about as threatening as a box of cornflakes
All right then
Sure
could use the extra dough
Excellent
We'll have a most interesting time
Whale lifts his glass, takes a small sip of tea
'  - Clay fetches a pair of hedge clippers from his truck
He can't help stopping by the side-view mirror to look at his face
- Doctors and technicians flash lights into Whale's eyes
test his reflexes
inject him with radioactive isotope
Whale sits very still with his head behind a fluoroscope screen while two doctors murmur over the image
'  - pair of  rays are slapped wet on a light board
Two skulls, one facing forward, the other in profile
, a bland young neurologist, points to a smudge in the side-view  ray
This is the area of infarction
By which we mean the portion of brain affected by the stroke
The venetian blinds of the examining room are closed
Whale sits calmly, flanneled legs crossed at the knees, gazing at his own skull
You're a lucky man, Mr
Whale
Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired
Yes, yes, Dr
Payne
But from the neck up
What's my story there
That's what 'm trying to explain
Payne turns off the light board and goes to the venetian blinds
The room is instantly full of sun
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations
Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism
Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head
That's as good a way as any to describe it
've seen far worse cases
You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane
But the rest of it
The killing headaches
The phantom smells
My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once
It's all nothing more than bad electricity
In a manner of speaking
've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but 'm sure they're related
So what do  do
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on
You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until 'm better
That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life
The doctor responds with a sympathetic gaze
Whale nods solemnly
- Whale makes his way toward the stairs
He passes a stoop-shouldered   who leans on the arm of her middle-aged
Then an   in a wheelchair, his eyes brimming with bewilderment and despair
'  -  - Hanna opens the door
Clay wears dungarees and a white dress shirt
Don't worry, you already paid me
'm here because -- The Master is waiting for you
She gestures him in, shuts the door
'  -  - Clay follows Hanna into the kitchen
He's down in his studio
Here
Take this with you
She thrusts a  tray toward him
Two glasses, two bottles of beer, a bottle of Coke
It's your job, lady, not mine
(hands back the tray) 'm here so he can draw my picture
'm keeping away
What you are doing is no business of mine
What're you talking about
What kind of man are you
Are you a good man
Yeah, 'm a good man
Something make you think 'm not
You will not hurt him
Gimme a break
'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures
Is that going to hurt him
No
No
(closes her eyes) am sorry
Forget everything say
Here
will take the tray
You do that
'  -  - Clay opens the squeaking door and enters behind Hanna
Whale stands at a drafting table, sharpening a pencil
Hanna sets the tray down
Very good, Hanna
Now goodbye
She goes toward the door, wrinkling her forehead at Clay
The screen door bangs shut
'm sure you'd like something to wet your whistle while  work
Whale opens a bottle of beer, pours it into a glass, hands it to Clay
He gestures to a chair
We'll go slowly today
Since this is your first time as a model
Clay sits
He pulls a " Guide" out of his back pocket
Did you see this
They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night
You don't say
Which picture
"Bride of Frankenstein
" Hmmm
much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man
"  Shall we begin
Clay takes a swig of beer and sets the glass on the floor
Ready when you are
Whale stares at Clay
That shirt, Mr
Boone
It's new
'm sorry
It's too white, too distracting
Would it be asking too much for you to take it off
'm not wearing an undershirt
Pish posh, Mr
Boone
'm not your Aunt Tilly
But it's just my face you want to draw
Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable
(sighs) Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear
He lifts a drop cloth off a footlocker, revealing a stack of "Physique" magazines
Whale casually covers them with a newspaper
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders
Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness
All right already
'll take it off
Kind of warm in here anyway
He unbuttons the shirt and pulls it off
Yes
Much better
(steps forward) Here
Clay adjusts his belt buckle as Whale hangs the shirt on a wall peg
He moves back to the easel again
think we'll have you sit slightly sideways, so you can rest one arm on the back of the chair
Yes
Just so
The arm with the tattoo faces the easel
Clay smirks
Take a picture, it lasts longer
That's exactly what  intend to do
clatter of pencils in the easel's tray, followed by a moment of silence
Finally, a low, whistly scratch
Clay concentrates on keeping still, focusing on an open window
You seem to have no idea how handsome you are, Mr
Boone
It has to do with how snugly your face fits your skull
Clay wipes a thin line of sweat from his waist
Would you be more comfortable barefoot
Feel free to remove your boots and socks
No
'm fine
It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it
You have to remain perfectly still while examine and scrutinize you
Whale suddenly sniffs, as if smelling something
He sniffs several times more but continues to draw
(to himself) Dripping
(to Clay) Do you ever eat dripping in this country
The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars
Used like butter on bread
Sounds like something you feed the dog
It is
Only the poorest families ever ate it
We kept ours in a crockery jar
Your family ate dripping
(catching himself) Of course not
As  said, only poor people -- Whale stops
He lets out a bitter laugh
'm sorry
've just realized how terribly ironic it all is
What
've spent most of my life outrunning my past
Now it's flooding all over me
Clay stares out blankly
There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth
Yes, my family ate dripping
Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley
Are you also from the slums, Mr
Boone
We weren't rich
But we weren't poor either
No, you were middle class, like all Americans
guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks
In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine
Every Englishman knows his place
And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you
My family had no doubts about who they were
But  was an aberration in that household a freak of nature
had imagination, cleverness, joy
Where did  get that
Certainly not from them
Whale's voice has changed, becoming more pinched and nasal
They took me out of school when was fourteen and put me in a factory
They meant no harm
They were like a family of farmers who've been given a giraffe, and don't know what to do with the creature except harness him to the plow
Whale seems completely lost in the past by now
Hatred was the only thing that kept my soul alive in that soul-killing place
And among those men  hated was my own poor, dumb father
Who put me in that hell to begin with
Whale peers out from behind the square of paper
He pales when he sees his father William, his face covered with grime, glaring at him from across the room
Whale retreats behind the pad, takes a breath
(
) Mr
Whale
Relief floods Whale's face
He looks out, smiles at Clay
You have to excuse me, Mr
Boone
Since my stroke,  am often overcome with nostalgia
don't mind
'm not crazy about my old man either
Whale rubs a hand across his eyes and steps into the open
Why don't we break for five minutes
You probably want to stretch your legs
Whale pulls the cover sheet over the pad to hide what he's drawn so far
(
) So you just sat there while this old limey banged his gums
'  - The place is dead
There's only Clay and Dwight sitting at the bar with the owner, , a balding hep cat with a scraggly tuft of beard
And, in a booth,  , a cocky 20-year-old, necking with a pony-tailed
liked it
You learn stuff listening to old-timers
(to Harry) You ever hear of this Whale fellow
Can't say that  have
Can't say 've heard of a lot of people though
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie
See if his name's on it
How about it, Harry
Can  watch my damn movie
told you
don't turn on the except for the fights
appears behind the bar, lugging a bucket of ice from the storeroom
She's an attractive woman in her early 30s, big-boned and almost as tall as Clay
spooky movie
Just what this place needs tonight
Couldn't make it any deader, doll
Set me up
Sure
Your friend want one
Clay reacts to the silent treatment with a tight smile
Yeah, one for what's-his-name here
She sets down two bottles of Pabst without looking at Clay
Thanks, doll
(to Harry) say let loverboy watch his movie
And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn
Why is everybody giving me crap tonight
Jesus, Boone
You come in here proud as a peacock because some old coot wants to paint your picture
We're just bringing you back to earth
Sounds screwy to me
can't imagine a real artist wanting to spend time looking at that kisser
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times
Ooooh
Betty glares at Clay, who realizes he's gone too far
bet this is just some fruit pretending to be famous
So he can get in the big guy's pants
Ooooh
What makes you say that
Just thinking out loud
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself
All right, then
He's interested in you for your conversation
We know what a great talker you are
Fuck you
Not anymore you don't
Doll
(explodes) We're watching the movie, Harry
You got that
We are watching my fucking movie
Calm down, Clay
Just calm down
We'll watch it
Good
Fine
Harry reaches up, turns on a battered Motorola
On the tv, a voice announces: "Tonight, Boris Karloff in 'The Bride of Frankenstein
'"  The titles come on
Ending with the phrase "Directed by", which floats over a white blob
The blob jumps forward to form letters: "James Whale
" Right there
What did  tell you
James Whale
The movie starts
The Monster being roasted alive in the flaming wreckage of a mill
This looks corny
Go wash glasses if you don't like it
In a flooded crater under the mill, the Monster kills an old man
He climbs up, flips the man's wife into the pit below
An owl blinks impassively
Not bad
Two down and it's just started
Minnie, a hatchet-faced woman with fluttering ribbons, is now alone with the Monster
'  -   - Whale and Hanna are in bathrobes and slippers, and there is a glass of milk and a plate of cookies on Whale's  tray
On the tv, Minnie (played by  ') squeaks and whimpers and screams
Whale laughs
Wonderful old Una
Gobbling like an old turkey hen
But Hanna isn't amused
She unclenches her arms to close the bathrobe over her throat
Oh, that monster
How could you be working with him
Don't be silly, Hanna
He's a very proper actor
And the dullest fellow imaginable
Minnie flees in a bowlegged jig up the hill
Whale smiles again
'  - On the tv, Dr
Pretorius (played by Ernest Thesiger) delivers a toast with inimitably ripe enunciation: "To a new world of gods and monsters
"  Dwight and Harry and Betty all laugh
These old movies are such a hoot
They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny
(defensively) Maybe it's supposed to be funny
Funny is funny and scary is scary
You don't mix them
Suddenly the tinny tv soundtrack is drowned out by the voice of Elvis Presley
Kid Saylor bends over the jukebox, wagging his denim butt and tapping a high-top sneaker
Hey
Some of us are watching a movie
Go ahead
Free country
Clay jumps from his stool
Saylor sees him coming, steps aside
You want me to turn it down
Clay slams the heel of his hand against Saylor's chest
The boy staggers backward
Clay grabs the corner of the jukebox and jerks it from the wall; the needle scratches across the song
Saylor holds up both hands in a nervous surrender
Hey,  didn't know
It's your favorite movie
Sorry, okay
Clay returns to the bar and uprights the stool
Saylor escorts his girl to the door
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay
just want to watch it, okay
On the tv, the blind man thanks God for sending him a friend
'  -   - Hanna's frown pops open
He is not going to kill the old man
No, Hanna
My heart isn't that black
In a crypt, the Monster meets Dr
Pretorius, who is having a midnight snack on top of a closed coffin
"Friend
" the monster asks
"Yes,  hope so," answers Pretorius, without batting an eyelash
He offers the Monster a drink, then adds: "Have a cigar
They're my only weakness
" The cigars were my own brand
So that  could have the leftovers
On the tv, the Monster groans:  "Love dead
Hate living
" Whale's focus sharpens, prompted by the unexpected discussion of death
'  - The Monster holds a skull in both hands and happily growls, "Wiiife
"  Betty, shudders, for real this time
Sick stuff
Necrophilia
wonder if they knew how sick they were
The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody
What sick about that
'  -   - Dr
Frankenstein and Pretorius make their final preparations
Frankenstein inquires where the fresh heart came from
"There are always accidental deaths occurring," Pretorius replies
"Always
"  Once again, Whale responds to the talk of death
'  - Finally, the Bride comes to life
She looks up, down, left, right, uncertain who she is
The Monster stares tenderly
"Friend
"  He timidly touches her arm and she screams
All right
You don't want him The Monster is heartbroken
Nobody loves him, not even his Bride
'  -   - The Bride shrieks again
She is horrible
She is beautiful
The Monster's pain turns to anger
He tears through the lab, orders Frankenstein to escape with his wife
But he wants Pretorius and the Bride to stay
"We belong dead
" Whale reacts sharply to the line
The Monster blows up the laboratory and the movie ends
Hanna shivers as she stands
Ugh
am sorry, Mr
Jimmy, but your movie is not my teacup
Still,  am glad there is a happy ending
The bad people are dead and the good people live
She hits the button on the Magnavox with the flat of her palm
'  - Betty turns off the Motorola
Weird movie
Weird, weird, weird
Harry stands up and stretches
Clay remains seated
So what did you think
Weird
loved it
want a switch like that in my trailer, so  can blow us to kingdom come when things don't go my way
He wobbles when he climbs off his stool
Damn but it's getting drunk in here
Late too
The bride of Dwight is going to bite my head off
He tilts toward the door
You coming, Boone
think 'll hang around
Go home, Clay
We're closing up
thought 'd give you a hand since kept you open
He waits to see how Betty reacts
She shrugs
Harry takes his book and cash drawer to the back door
'm next door if you need me
He gives Clay one last look and goes out to the breezeway and his apartment
You know what
think you guys are all jealous
(laughs) What's to be jealous of
've gotten to know someone who's famous
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him
If he were that famous, he probably wouldn't give me the time of day
This way, he's like my famous person
(laughs at himself) Yeah, my own personal famous person
Who treats me like 'm somebody worth talking to
Clay leans down to plug in the jukebox
You want to go for a swim
She snaps her mouth open and imitates the Bride's furious cat hiss
What's that mean
It means it's too cold to go swimming
And  don't mean the water
wasn't going to try anything
Yeah, and 'm never going to smoke another cigarette
He patiently waits by the door while Betty turns out the lights
She walks briskly through the glow of the jukebox, waving Clay outside with her hand
'  - Betty pulls the door shut and bends over to lock it
Clay catches a glimpse of skin in the side slit of her shirttail
Let's go for a walk at least
Walk and talk
really feel like talking tonight
Betty's eyes blink in mock surprise
This old guy -- he's the kind of person  expected to meet when moved out here
Someone who's done things with his life
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me
It's different
He's a man
And by the way you have no business calling him a homo
It never crossed your mind
He's an artist
Anyway, he's too old to think about sex
All the old men  know think about nothing but sex
She opens the door of her Chevy
Clay grabs it with both hands to keep her from getting in
'mon
What's eating you tonight
Betty hesitates, then looks him sharply in the eye
You picked up that girl right in front of me
Hey, no strings, right
That's what you always said
Just good pals who have the hots for each other
It still hurt
lot
didn't mean to
No, 'm actually kind of glad it happened
It made me wonder what the hell  was doing with my life
Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you
You liked it too
Sure
loved it
If you enjoy it, you should do it
You know,  just can't do that anymore
still have time to get things right
Get married again -- You mean us
Betty bursts out laughing
The look on your face
You're not marriage material
You're not even boyfriend material
You're a kid
big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid
'm not a kid
What are you then
What will you be ten years from now
Still cutting lawns
Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer
Clay glares at her, his jaw working forward in anger
like my life
'm a free man
Sure you're free, for now at least
But how long before you're just alone
Pathetic and alone
Clay's anger jumps from his jaw into his shoulders and arms
He grabs the door handle
So you don't want to fuck
That's what you're telling me
Is that all this conversation means to you
Am  going to put out or not
Damn straight
'm sick of playing games
Betty quickly gets into the car
before she can pull the door shut, Clay slams it on her, hard
Her hands leap in front of her face, as if he'd hit her
The look of fear in her eyes startles Clay out of his rage
Betty, look
This is coming out all wrong -- She frantically turns the key in the ignition and the Chevy pulls out
From here on out, Boone, you're just another tired old face on the other side of the bar
The car screeches away
Clay stumbles across the highway
- Clay comes to the dump at the end of the canyon
He climbs into it, kicking at loose cans
It's all shit
Shit on by women
Shit on by the Marines
Shit on by the world
Fuck
He shouts the word at the cliff, for the raw, sudden violence of shouting
Fuuuck
dog in the carport starts to bark
The sound of Clay's pain echoes off the canyon as we  : '  -  - Whale is sitting up n bed when Hanna knocks
She enters with a tray loaded with bottles and vials
You will take them all, Mr
Jimmy
'll be fine, Hanna
Thank you
Good night
Whale takes the pills, one by one, until he comes to the bottle of Luminal
He opens the pheno bottle to shake out a capsule and a dozen spill into his palm
He stares at them
'  -  - Hanna opens the door, gasps when she sees Whale lying motionless on the bed
She spots the empty bottle of Luminal
Oh no, Mr
Jimmy
Hanna kneels next to the body
She makes a Sign on the Cross, launches into a frantic "Hail Mary
"  We  : '  -  - Whale snorts at the imagined scene
One by one, he returns the capsules to their bottle, until a single pill remains
He places it on the table, then turns out the lamp and lies on his back in the dark, waiting for sleep
The distant sound of laughter invades the darkness
Whale sits up, straining to identify the voices
The bedroom wall opposite him melts away, revealing: -   -  (1935) and   sit side by side in dentist chairs, cloths around their necks, heads tilted back
, the makeup artist, is patting the hair drawn over a cage on Elsa's head
He looks up, sees Whale, and breaks into a conspiratorial grin
Elsa's eyes are closed; she hasn't heard whale enter
You done yet, love
am absolutely dying for a fag
Whale tiptoes in for a better look
Karloff has a mouthpiece to help him breathe while the assistant adds another coat of green sizing to the still incomplete makeup
(gurgles) Goo' 'orning, 'ames
Good morning
And a very good morning to you
Elsa's eyes snap open
There are no mirrors on the walls
Uh-oh
The way you look at me, James
What have you done this time
Bring a mirror
Let the Bride feast upon her visage
Boris
Do  look a fright
Karloff shrugs, irked that she's getting all the attention
Jack Pierce lifts a large mirror
(nasal New Yorkese) Behold, the Bride of Frankenstein
Elsa stares at the beautiful corpse in the mirror
She snaps her head left, right, up, down, startled by the sight of herself, electrocuted into frightened, spastic jerks
Oh, James
As Whale observes his star we see her spasms through his eyes -- as a series of dissonant, line-jumping close-ups
And you said there'd be some of me left
Nobody's going to know me in this getup
Nonsense, my dear
You look extraordinary
(to an assistant) Today's script
Quick
And a pencil
Whale scans the page of shooting script, the margin marked in pencil: , ,
Whale pencils in a bracket and scribbles:  a,b,c,d---
Jack,  want to get on this right away
Sorry, Boris, we won't get to you until this afternoon
'ish you 'old 'e 'ooner
The assistant removes his mouthpiece
could have spent the morning tending to my roses
- The interior of Stage  is completely filled by the laboratory set
Electricians adjust the lights on the wooden tower beside the Bride's table
(Dr
Frankenstein) and   (Dr
Pretorius) sit off to the side, in full makeup and costume
Clive mumbles earnestly over his script
Thesiger pinches his face over the needle he dips in and out of an embroidery ring
Whale comes on the set with Elsa on his arm
She walks regally beside him, the train of her long white robe thrown over one arm
There's a wolf whistle from overhead, and applause, causing Elsa to curtsy to her admirers
Thesiger takes her hand, leans back to study her
My God
Is the audience to presume that Colin and  have done her hair
thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman
Oh no, my dear
You look absolutely amazing
There's no way can compete with you
The scene is yours
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster
And our monster would be Gary Cooper
would've thought Mr
Leslie Howard would be more your line
More your line
My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin
Dogs are so much more dependable than men
Colin
Please
It's time
(softly, to Thesiger) How is he today
Stiff as a board
(calls out) Yes, Colin
Come see what they've done to our Elsa
Clive walks over, glumly
'm not at my best today, Jimmy
touch of flu, you know
Whale sees through the excuse, rests an arm on Clive's shoulder
Relax, my boy
You could do this scene in your sleep
Clive grits his teeth and nods
Whale positions them in front of the upended table, Clive and Thesiger holding Elsa's robe out by the hems
The shadow of the sound boom passes back and forth while they rehearse
gather we not only did her hair but dressed her
What a couple of queens we are, Colin
Elsa giggles
Clive looks distraught -- which brings some life to his stiffness
Whale sees this, decides to tune it higher
Yes, a couple of flaming queens
And Pretorius is a little in love with Dr
Frankenstein, you know
Clive's distress reads clearly now
He is twitchy and alive
Yes
think it's coming together
Shall we have a go
He sits in the canvas director's chair, nods to the assistant director
Quiet on the set
The warning bell rings
Lights
The lights sizzle and blaze
Sound
Okay for sound
Camera
young man with a clapboard steps in front of the camera
Scene two-fifteen
Take one
Action
The Bride snaps her head in various directions
Thesiger slopes back, fingers splayed, intoxicated by his creation: The Bride of Frankenstein
Whale sits with his legs crossed, jogging his raised foot as if conducting the scene with his show
Fully engaged, intensely alive
We  : '  -  - Whale glances at the clock, sees that it is 3:15
He is wide awake
He reaches over, picks up the Luminal
Luminal
Illumine all
Whale reluctantly places the pill on his tongue and swallows
He rests his head on the pillow and stares at the ceiling, where the reflection of the window sheers casts an ever-shifting pattern of light and dark
We move down to reveal: -  ( & ) It's a cobblestone cell, a plaster set from "Bride of Frankenstein
"  Whale sits in a massive chair, straining against thick iron chains, as a lightning storm rages outside
In the distance, heavy footsteps, coming closer, until the cell door is filled with the silhouette of the Monster
Whale hardly dares to breathe as the Monster rips off the door and enters the cell
The Monster steps into the light, allowing us to see his face for the first time
It is Clay Boone, dressed in a Marine parade uniform
He uses his hedge clippers to cut the chains from around Whale's chest
Thank you
Thank you so much
Clay leans down and takes Whale in his arms, cradling him like a child
They move across the sound stage -- Clay carefully sidestepping the lights and cables on the floor -- until they reach the next set: - Clay carries Whale past a painted backdrop of a stormy English countryside
'  - Whale lies on the Bride's table
Clay pulls on a doctor's smock, picks up a scalpel from a table covered with various medical instruments
he carves a thin circle around the top of Whale's forehead
Then, with one deft movement, he pops off Whale's scalp and pulls out the brain
It is soot-covered, charred, used up
Whale watches with detached fascination as Clay tosses it on the floor, then takes a throbbing, luminous mass from a tray
Clay inserts the new brain into Whale's skull, sutures the scalp back into place
he fastens the conducting clamps around Whale's temples, then throws the heavy circuit breaker
Lights throb with bursts of energy
loose sparks crackle
rotary sparks create snapping circles of fire
as the energy of the raging storm is harnessed into the machinery
Clay steps back to take in his handiwork
sudden look of panic fills Whale's face
It isn't working
The experiment is a failure
Clay glances down at Whale, whose breathing is slowing
Realizing that the new brain hasn't taken: Just go to sleep
serenity suffuses Whale's features as he stares up at the pale flicker of lightning
His breathing finally stops, his face a tranquil mask of death
We  : '  -  - Whale wakes with a start
He checks the clock, sees that it's past nine
He presses an intercom button on the bedside table
'm up, Hanna
Whale sits up, drinks in the sunlight
He notices some grass clippings and leaves scattered on the bedspread
What in God's name -- Whale turns and sees Clay lying next to him
He gasps
(angrily) told you to sleep
Clay's hands close around Whale's neck
We  : '  -  - Whale opens his eyes groggily
He scans the room in panic, clearly unable to get his bearings
Whale tries to stand but his legs give way beneath him
'  -  -  () Whale and Hanna stare straight out as she reaches down and unbuttons the tiny buttons on his pajama fly
Whale supports himself with one hand on Hanna's shoulder as he relieves himself with the other
'  -  -  () Whale sits up in bed, staring dumbly at the morning paper
Hanna reaches in to take away the breakfast tray
Does the yardman come today
Of course
This afternoon
thin smile forms on Whale's face
'  - Clay prunes the roses on the front lawn
Hanna appears, frowning
Something  can do for you
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch
tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists  ask
Got a lawn this afternoon, but 'm free until then
Expect nothing fancy
Hanna goes inside
Clay rolls the mower down the path
'  -  - Clay knocks on the bottom of the Dutch door as he lifts the latch and walks in
He is wearing a fresh madras shirt
The Master is dressing
am to offer you a drink
There is whiskey and there is iced tea
Tea is fine
He sits at the kitchen table
No
You are a guest now
You go in the living room
That's okay, Hanna
'm more comfortable in here
It is Hanna, isn't it
She eyes him suspiciously, shrugs, pours a glass of tea
Clay notices a Bible on the counter
How long you worked for Mr
Whale
Long enough
Fifteen years
bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go
Movie stars
No
We live simply, Mr
Jimmy and People come to play bridge
And now and then, young men to swim
You have people, Boone
You mean family
All in Joplin, Missouri
Your wife
'm not married
Why
Oh,  don't know
Because no girl in her right mind will have me
man who is not married has nothing
He is a man of trouble
You need a woman
You proposing what  think you're proposing
Don't you think 'm a little young for you
Hanna twists her head around with such an indignant look that Clay bursts out laughing
She realizes that she is being teased
Men
Always pulling legs
Everything is comedy
(mimics an English accent) "How very amusing
How marvelously droll
" Hanna stares at Clay until his smile fades
She resumes her chopping in silence
You ever been married, Hanna
Of course
am married still
Yeah
What's your husband do
He is dead now, twenty years
Then you're as single as  am
No
have children, grandchildren too
visit when  can
But now that Mr
Jimmy cannot be left very long,  do not get away much
(sighs) Poor Mr
Jimmy
There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell
Very sad
You're sure of that
This is what the priests tell me
His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven
Sins of the flesh
Everybody has those
No
His is the worse
(worse) The unspeakable
The deed no man can name without shame
She loses patience with Clay's blank look
What is the good English
All know is bugger
He is a bugger
Men who bugger each other
homo
Yes
You know
Clay slowly sits up
That is why he must go to hell do not think it fair
But God's law is not for us to judge
You're telling me Mr
Whale is a homo
You did not know
Well
no, not really -- You and he are not doing things
No
Good
That is what  hope
did not think you a bugger too
fear only that you might hurt him if he tries
'm not going to hurt anyone
Yes
trust you
Off in the distance, a throat loudly trumpets itself clear
You must go in
Quickly
He will not like to think  have had you in the kitchen
Clay gets up slowly, reluctant to leave the room
'  -   - Whale comes forward as Clay enters, offering a hand at the end of a spindly wrist
How are you, Mr
Boone
So glad you are free for lunch
All right,  guess
assume you worked up an appetite with your labor
hesitant smile from Clay
Whale picks a stack of mail off the table, rifles through envelopes
Forgive my rudeness
At my age, the post is the cream of the day
He returns the stack to the table but holds on to a square envelope
Do you mind
Go ahead
Clay looks off while Whale opens the envelope
Hmmm
Princess Margaret
He is examining a folded card
He rubs a thumb over the printed lettering
Her Majesty's Loyal Subjects in the Motion Picture Industry
Cordially invited
Reception at the home of
Mr
George Cukor
His lips smack open in disgust
That pushy little -- horning in on the Queen's sister, then offering to share her with the whole damn raj
live in this country to get away from this rubbish
He tosses the invitation on the table
Is this David's doing
This David's a friend
Yes
An old, useless friend
You must excuse me, Mr
Boone
This is a world  finished with long ago
pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment
(a deep breath) Lunch should be ready
Shall we
He holds out an open hand so that Clay can precede him into the dining room
'  -   - Hanna sets down two steaming plates of omelettes
Whale hands a glass of red wine to Clay
Cheers
They both take a sip of wine
Smells lovely, Hanna
Hanna nods, steals a glance at Clay as she leaves
Saw your movie the other night
Watched it with some friends
Did you now
liked it
We all did
Did anyone laugh
(covering) No
Pity
People are so earnest nowadays
Why
Was it supposed to be funny
Of course
had to make it interesting for myself, you see comedy about death
The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke
(a sip of wine) But the Monster never receives any of my gibes
He is noble
Noble and misunderstood
Whale gazes pointedly at Clay, who eats with his elbows on the table, quickly bolting the hot omelette
In Korea, Mr
Boone
Clay looks up
Did you kill anyone
don't like to talk about that
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country
That's something to be proud of
Proud
Any jerk with a gun can kill someone
Quite true
Hand-to-hand combat is the true test
Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand
(defensive) No
could have, though
Yes,  believe you could
(a sip of wine) How free is your schedule this afternoon
Full up
got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega
What is we say phooey to the hedges
Could you spare an hour after lunch
To sit for me
Can't today
'll pay our going rate
Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges
Sorry
don't feel like sitting still today
All righty
understand
Whale tilts a scrutinizing eye at Clay
'  -  -  () Hanna carries the dirty dishes back to the kitchen
'  -   - Clay starts to bite the tip off a cigar
Use this
Whale passes him a gold penknife
Just a trim
And mine while you're at it
Fingers are a bit stiff today
You ever been married, Mr
Whale
No
At least not in the legal sense
Clay hands a clipped cigar back to Whale
So you had a wife
Or a husband
Depending on which of us you asked
My friend David
He lived here for many years
The other cigar crunches faintly between Clay's fingers
Does that surprise you
No,  -- you're a homosexual
Oh dear
If one must have a clinical name
'm not, you know
never thought you were
You don't think of me that way, do you
What way might that be
You know
Look at me like -- like look at women
Don't be ridiculous
know a real man like you would break my neck if so much as laid a hand on him
Besides, you're not my type
Clay suddenly laughs
Whale's smile deepens
So we understand each other
What you do is no business of mine
Live and let live,  say
hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today
No
-- Whale continues to smile, slyly
What are you afraid of, Mr
Boone
Certainly not a frail old man like me
Clay has no answer
He gives in with a sigh
'  -  - Clay sits sideways on the chair again
Whale stands at the easel
Can  see what you did so far
It will only make you self-conscious
You'll have to remove your shirt
Sorry
Not today
But we have to match the other sketch
just feel more comfortable keeping it on
You just said you didn't want me self-conscious
Whale steps forward
Perhaps if we open the shirt and pull -- Whale's hands to in
Clay's flesh tightens; he shrinks back
The hands stop, palms raised
Oh dear have made you nervous
'm fine
'd just rather keep it on
Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders
Two buttons
Is that so much to ask
Just two little buttons
Whale's thumb and fingers unpluck buttons in midair
No
Look
What you told me at lunch is still very weird for me
So either you sketch me like  am or 'll say forget it and go do your hedges
Whale takes a step back
His eyes are locked on Clay, fascinated by his temper
don't mean to be a prick, but that's how  feel
Of course
don't want to scare you off
Not before 'm finished with you
Whale glides behind the easel
The pencils rattle in the tray
Tell me more about yourself, Mr
Boone
You have a steady companion
Not at the moment
Why not
You know how it is
You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it
Very well put
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another
man has to make up his own life, alone
Ah
philosopher
Thoreau with a lawnmower
(smiles) like that
But take care, Mr
Boone
Freedom is a drug, much like any other
Too much can be a very bad thing
Clay glances out the window
Feigning a merely casual interest: Is that why you and your friend split up
Because you wanted to be free
In a way, yes
suppose so know it's why  stopped making pictures
Whale backs away from the easel and stares at the paper with a sour frown
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when was at the very pinnacle of my profession
The horror movies were behind me
'd done "Show Boat
" Major success
Great box office
Now  was to do something important
"The Road Back
"  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany
It was to be my masterpiece
What happened
The fucking studio butchered it
It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor
Anything to avoid losing the German market
They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick
The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb
For which  was blamed
shadow passes over Whale's eyes
He presses two fingers against his temple
After that,  went out of fashion
was no longer able to command the best projects, so  walked away
Why should  spend my time working in such a dreadful business
Do you miss it
(dismissive) It's so far in the past now
Over fifteen years -- Whale stops himself
He smiles gently at Clay
Making movies was the most wonderful thing in the world
Working with friends
Entertaining people
Yes, suppose  miss it
More so now that -- Whale reaches into his pocket, takes out the bottle of Luminal
think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world
Yes
wish  had done more work
You've done a helluva lot more than most people
Better work
Whale moves across the room to the screen door
But  chose freedom
David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue
didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend
"  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer
How long were you
Twenty years
Too long
We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh
So  finally decided to close down the show
Whale places a pill on his tongue and swallows
He fixes Clay with a pinched smile
When all fetters are loosened, a certain hedonism creeps in, don't you think
There was a period when this house was overrun with young men
Some even posed for me
Right where you're sitting now
Clay sits uncomfortably in his chair
His face flushes
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful
No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks
And pricks
Hard, arrogant pricks -- Cut it out
Clay explodes out of his chair, knocking over a small side table
Fuck it
can't do this anymore
He looms over Whale, whose breathing starts to quicken
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy
Do you have to rub my nose in it
assure you, Mr
Boone,  meant no -- From now on, Mr
Whale,  cut your grass and that's it
Understand
Before Whale can respond Clay storms out, nearly ripping the screen door off its hinges
Whale sits on the daybed, takes a few quick breaths
Suddenly the air is filled with the sounds of people cavorting in the pool
Whale looks up, sees a young man standing outside the screen door
It is now dark outside
Come on, Jimmy
Watch me dive
Whale offers a melancholy smile
think 'll just rest for a moment
The man shrugs, disappears into the shadows
We move across the room and through the door
'  - Whale sits in a director's chair, a martini in one hand, a cigar in the other, a harmless old uncle watching young men swagger and splash in the pool
think we're ready to go
He glances over, sees Clay in plaid bathing trunks, sitting apart from the others
He is puffing on a Camel
You're up, Mr
Boone
Clay ignores him
Whale puts down his martini and cigar, picks up a Polaroid camera
He moves over to clay
The extras are in their places
Now we need the star
Wouldn't you like to get in the pool
You first
Oh no
never swim
Whale removes Clay's cigarette, crushes it with his shoe
Behind him, the pool is now a pit full of naked shadows
You'll have to remove that shirt
Whale touches Clay's bare chest
Clay grabs hold of his wrist, causing the old man to yelp in pain
In the pool, the extras shriek in alarm
Clay's hands close tightly around Whale's throat
'  -  - Whale's hands fly to his throat
He opens his eyes and gasps greedily for air, the young men's screams lingering in the room
There is a look of genuine terror on his face
-  - The sun goes down
Clay wearily pushes his lawnmower, struggling to concentrate on the darkened lawn
-   - The smug   peers out at Clay from behind a screen door
Do you mind turning on a light
It's getting pretty soupy out here
Should have been here when you said you would
You whack off a tow, don't think about taking me to court
You're lucky  even squeezed you in today
Don't take that tone with me, bub
There's Japs in this town that work cheaper and do flowers too
Clay takes a deep breath
He can't afford to get angry
Will you just turn on the porch light
Sir
The owner flicks on the light
'  - Clay presses through the Saturday night crowd
Clay cranes his neck to scan the crowd
Where's Betty
She took the night off
Heavy date
Some guy she's had her eye on for a while
Harry smiles pointedly at Clay, hands him the beer
Thanks a lot, pal
Clay turns his back on the bar
He sees Dwight moving through the crowd
Dwight
Dwight nods, a little coolly
Hey, Boone
Have a drink
Dwight's , a pert, steely-eyed brunette, places a firm hand on his shoulder
Dwight shrugs, heads toward the door
Clay turns
pretty, too-tan   in her early 30s is standing at the end of the bar, eyeing Clay
He lifts his glass and she responds with an open smile
'  - Clay and the woman go at it, their shadows visible through the glass louvers
'  -  - Clay tugs on a cord and the harsh overhead fluorescent buzzes to life
He splashes his face with water, then catches his reflection in the mirror
- Clay parks outside the local branch of the public library
- Clay leafs through an oversized folio, bound copies of The New York Times He glances at an article from 1936
"Interview With a Passing Whale
"  There is a picture of Whale, captioned "Famous British Director
" approaches with more leatherbound books
Here are the trade newspapers you wanted
Clay takes the books, opens one
'  -   - Whale eats lunch off a  tray
His attention remains focused on "Queen for a Day" as Hanna clomps into the room behind him
Who was that at the door
visitor
Whale turns
His face registers surprise when he sees Clay
Thank you, Hanna
That will be all
Hanna retreats toward the kitchen
Clay steps tentatively into the room
Mr
Boone
You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday
'd like to sit for you again
But only if you ease up on the locker room talk
Okay
Whale holds up two fingers, affects an American accent
Scout's honor
Clay smiles
'  -  - Whale and Boone are back in their familiar positions
An empty glass of beer sits on the floor next to Clay
'm curious, Mr
Boone
What convinced you to come back
don't know
guess  like your stories
Everybody has stories to tell
Not me
What about your stint in Korea
'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes
told you
don't like to talk about that
Whale nods, sensing that he's touched a sore spot
And the fear you showed at our last session
How did you overcome that
Not fear
More like disgust
Same difference, Mr
Boone
Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us
Am  right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion
There's no people like you in my crowd
No teammates in football
No comrades in Korea
You must think the whole world is queer
Well it's not
War sure isn't
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers
You're talking through your hat now
Not at all
was in the foxholes myself
You were a soldier
was an officer
Clay breaks his pose to turn and look at Whale
This was World War
No, my dear
The Crimean War
What do you think
The Great War
You had a Good War, while we had -- Whale clears his throat, bored by his standard line
-- a war without end
There were trenches when  arrived, and trenches when  left, two years later
Just like in the movies
Only the movies never get the stench of them
The world reduced to mud and sandbags and a narrow strip of rainy sky
(a dry snort) But we were discussing something else
Oh yes
Love in the trenches
Now he's talking only to himself
Barnett
Was that his name
Leonard Barnett
He came to the front straight from Harrow
And he looked up to me
Unlike the others, he didn't care that  was a workingman impersonating his betters
How strange, to be admired so blindly
suppose he loved me
But chastely, like a schoolboy
Something happened to him
Whale looks up at Clay, stares at him
remember one morning in particular
morning when the sun came out
-  (1917) , 19, boyish and handsome, peers into a periscope
Whale stands beside him, pointing out landmarks on the bleak landscape
(
) Odd, how even there one could have days when the weather was enough to make one happy
He and  were standing on the fire step and showed him the sights of no-man's land, through the periscope
It was beautiful
The barbed wire was reddish gold, the water in the shell holes green with algae, the sky a clear quattrocento blue
And stood shoulder to shoulder with a tall apple-cheeked boy who loved and trusted me
Whale reaches over and lays his arm across Barnett's shoulder
Barnett smiles timidly at him
We  : '  -  - Whale leans forward, completely disoriented
His eyes fix on Clay, the white eyebrows screwed down, until he is able to recognize the face
Don't do this to me again, Mr
Boone
absolutely refuse
Whale stands, his legs shaky
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane
Not this lane
Not today
didn't -- Why do  tell you this
never told David
never even remembered it until you got me going
You're the one who started it
You're very clever, Mr
Boone
You just sit there and let me talk
What a sorry old man, you're thinking
What a crazy old poof
(comes closer) Why are you here
What do you want from me
You asked me to model
Remember
Of course  remember
Do you think 'm so senile -- Whale stands over Clay
His pale face turns left, right, looking at Clay with one cold eye, then the other
Clay returns the gaze, worried for Whale
Mr
Whale
Are you okay
Whale turns away
He yanks out a handkerchief
Stupid
Very stupid
What have been thinking
He sits on the daybed and bends over, covering both eyes with the handkerchief
Just go
Please
Why don't you go
don't get it
First you creep me out with homo shit
Then you hit me with war stories
And now you're upset because  listen
What do you want
want --  want
His pained eyes focus on Clay, and soften
want a glass of water
Clay gets up and goes to the sink
touch of headache
Clay hands him the water
Thank you
Whale sets the glass down and sits with his head lowered, his body folded like a bundle of sticks
My apologies
had no business snapping at you
No harm done
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait
You cannot force what will not flow
You don't want me to sit for you anymore
Whale shakes his head sadly
He gazes up at Clay, sees the disappointment on his face
How would you like to come to a party with me
reception for Princess Margaret
thought you weren't going
If you don't mind driving, 'd like to take you as my guest
There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused
'm game
Sure
Very good, Clayton
May  call you Clayton
Or do you prefer Boone
Clayton is fine
Whale smiles gently
- The sun is setting over the Pacific
Clay stands in a phone booth on the strand
- Clay smiles anxiously as the call connects
Mom
Yeah, it's me
Clay pauses as his mother shoots questions at him
No, 'm not in jail
don't want any money, no
(louder, to be heard) Look, is Sis there
want to tell her about this movie person  met out here
She'll get a kick out of it
We hear the phrase: "She's out, Clay
"  Clay closes his eyes as his mother rambles on
No,  still
'd give you my phone number if  had a phone -- Clay tries to stay calm as his mother berates him for not staying in touch
How's the old man
Before Clay can protest we hear: "Hold on
"  Clay glances out at couples strolling up the promenade
An operator interrupts, says: "One dollar for the next three minutes
" Clay deposits two quarters before his mother returns
"He's busy, Clay
" Right
The operator comes on again, asking for fifty more cents
Clay stares at the quarters in his hand
Time's up
better go
Clay listens as his mother prattles on, until the connection is broken and the phone goes dead
Clay steps out of the booth, takes a deep breath of ocean air
'  -  - Whale and Hanna go through the closet together
Mr
Boone
He is an interesting friend
'd hardly call our yardman a friend
No
But someone you can talk to
Whale stops, turns to Hanna
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna
have my family
Also our Lord Jesus Christ
Of course
How is the old boy these days
The naughty remark is met with a solemn stare
Whale reaches up, chooses a lightweight blue suit
It needs a hat
There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora
It must be up in your old room will look
The phone rings
Hanna hurries to answer it
'  -   - Hanna speaks softly in Hungarian
Whale points upstairs to let her know he will look for the hat himself
'  -   - Whale opens the closet door and takes down a stack of hatboxes from the overhead shelf
He opens the first box, takes out a rubbery wad of heavy fabric with two round windows like eyes
It's a gas mask
We  : -  (1917) The night sky explodes with light and smoke
Whale moves calmly through the chaos, trying to maintain a modicum of order among the troops
Gas masks on
Gas masks on
At the end of the line, young Barnett is struggling with his straps
Mustard gas is starting to stream into the trench
Don't mind me, Lieutenant
Save yourself
Whale slips the mask over Barnett's face, fastens it
He slides his own mask into position moments before the trench is obliterated by the yellowish smoke
We  : '  -   - Hanna stands in the door with a forlorn frown
Oh, Mr
Jimmy
You make a mess of it
Here
Hanna lifts the lid of an unopened box to show him the missing fedora
(stacking boxes) That is my daughter
She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon
am sorry, Mr
Jimmy
will make it short
'll be out this afternoon, remember
Your family can visit as long as they like
No
do not cook for them
My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food
Hanna holds out the box for the gas mask
Whale gives it a long, final look, then drops it in the box
You can toss this one in the trash
Hanna clamps the lid on the box
'  -  - Hanna has opened the door
At the end of the hall, silhouetted against the bright afternoon sky, is Clay
His shoulders fill the doorway
The top of his head is perfectly flat
Good afternoon, Clayton
Do  look okay
Clay steps into the light
His khaki pants are clean and pressed
blue knit shirt fits his muscles snugly
You look splendid, my boy
Quite splendid
'  -  - Whale crosses to the passenger side of the Chrysler
suppose you'd like the top down
If that's okay
Nothing would please me more
Clay squeezes behind the wheel, shifts the seat back, explores switches
The vinyl top pops up and folds backward
Whale gets in
Clay starts the engine and backs out
'  - Hanna stands at the front door, hands tangled in her apron
Whale tugs his hat brim at her as the car swings around the driveway
Whale smiles at the wide open sky overhead
Clay steps on the gas and the Chrysler takes off
- The party is clearly audible from the road, where Clay has squeezed the Chrysler into a long row of shiny cars nuzzling the high brick wall
Whale puts his dark glasses on
Stars, you know
The suns of other galaxies
They walk up the steep road to the gatehouse
Good old George
He loves to put on the dog
Only his dogs tend to have a bit of mutt
at the gate inspects the invitation, waves them through
-  - sunny patio with hedges and statues
Wickets and stakes have been set up for a game of croquet, but only a handful of very tanned children strut around with mallets
What did  tell you
Listen
don't hear anything
Exactly
Cukor was too cheap to hire music
There's nothing but chin-wag
The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag
Whale scans the crowd
Slim pickings
Well, it's early yet
Perhaps this is a good time to pay our respects
Clay follows Whale toward a trellis alcove covered in ivy
handful of people grin at the mismatched couple who stand in the shade: a homely older man in glasses and a pretty woman in a white dress with polka dots
and Let's get this over with quickly
Whale forgets to remove his hat when he comes forward
Before he can give Cukor their names Princess Margaret's polite smile bursts open in a joyful display of teeth
had no idea you'd be here
She seizes Whale's hand in her little white gloves
How are you
(taken aback) Fine
Quite fine
And Your Royal Highness
Splendid
Now that  know you're around
Standing beside him, Clay is clearly impressed that Whale knows a princess
Can we get together while 'm in town
so badly want to sit for you again
Sit
've changed my hair, you see
Since our last session
Those old snaps look rather dowdy now
Whale realizes she's mistaken him for someone else
He tugs his sunglasses down his nose so she can see his eyes
Oh dear
Have  made a blunder
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine
James Whale
(laughs) am such a goose
mistook you for Cecil Beaton
It's the hat
You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know
Whale attempts to chuckle while he fights a feeling of humiliation
He turns to Cukor for help
Hello, George
James Whale
David Lewis's friend
once made pictures myself, Ma'am
Yes
Of course
One can't throw a rock in this town without hitting one of us old movie directors
Whale feels the sting
He turns to Clay
Ma'am, may  present Mr
Clayton Boone
Clay steps forward to shake hands
My gardener, who insisted  bring him today
He so wanted to meet royalty
Cukor's face goes blank with indignation
Pleased to meet you
Quite
adore gardens
Whale narrows his eyes at Cukor and sharpens his smile
He's never met a princess
Only queens
Cukor puffs out his chest, quivers a bulbous lower lip at Whale
George, Ma'am, this has been an honor
An occasion to remember for the rest of my days
He leads Clay away and an American couple promptly crowd in to take their place
Striding through the garden, Whale is obviously pleased with himself
What was that about
Nothing of importance
Just two old men slapping each other with lilies
Shall we have a drink
Whale leads Clay to a tented bar
Across the way, David Lewis has come through the gate with a  on his arm
People look discreetly, not at David but at the woman, lightly veiled in a scarf and sunglasses
Who's that
David
The friend  thought was in New York
No
The girl
Girl
Oh
Elizabeth Taylor
Clay watches in amazement as   waves to someone and pipes out a happy hello
She hurriedly unties her scarf, thrusts it at David and runs off on tiptoes to embrace a woman
Is that really her
David produced her last picture
David glances around while he slips the scarf into a coat pocket
He sees Whale looking at him
He puts on a tight smile and strolls across the patio
What are you doing here
Just what  was about to ask you
thought you were in New York
was, until last night
Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception
The waiter arrives with their drinks
Only when Clay takes his glass of beer does David see that Whale is not alone
David Lewis
Clay Boone
Our yardman
Who was kind enough to serve as my escort to George's little do
David freezes
Whale lifts his martini glass at Clay and takes a sip
Should you be drinking in your condition
Oh, David, stop being a nanny
Clay clears his throat, eager to escape this domestic squabble
think 'll go look at Elizabeth Taylor
He hurries off
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton
You didn't, Jimmy
did
But Princess Margaret was a doll
We're all equals in her eyes
As commoners,  presume
You only embarrass yourself
Oh dear
'll never work in this town again
You know what  mean
Your reputation
But  have no reputation
'm as free as the air
Well the rest of us aren't
Can't you remember that
No
never could
You must regret having had the invitation sent
David is looking over Whale's shoulder
didn't ask George to invite you
Then who did
Jimmy, there are people here  need to speak to
You'll be fine on your own
Yes
Perfectly
All right, then
'll come by tomorrow for breakfast
Whale nods, watches David stroll over to the pool and greet a gaggle of executives
Whale drifts toward some deck chairs at the far end of the croquet lawn
He sits, takes a sip of his drink
Suddenly a high-pitched giggle pierces the air
Mr
Whale
Whale looks out to see Edmund Kay, his interviewer from several weeks ago, marching across the lawn
Mr
Kay
Bet you thought you'd never see me again
didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party
You didn't
'm the one who got you on Mr
Cukor's guest list
You, Mr
Kay
How do you know George Cukor
interviewed him after  met you
'm his social secretary now
Well, assistant to his secretary
commend you
If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you
You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs
Don't think that, Mr
Whale love your movies
That's why wanted you to come to this
So could see you with your monsters
My monsters
Don't go away
Whale tries to do just that, but finds himself caught in the chair
He is stumbling to his feet when Kay returns with Elsa Lanchester, 55, at his side
Jimmy
How are you
Elsa
She takes Whale's hand, with a look of deep concern and sympathy
Kay races off again
saw Una 'Conner a few weeks ago
She said you'd been under the weather
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary
Growing old
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth
But you appear quite fresh, my dear
She swats aside the compliment and gestures at the chair
Please
You shouldn't stand on my account
Perfectly all right
But if you'd like to sit -- 'm fine, Jimmy
can only stay a few minutes
Of course
What's our pesky friend up to now
Kay returns, accompanied by a stopped, gray-haired man with a long rectangular face and wary, heavy-lidded eyes
Is that Boris
Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion
Oh dear
Karloff, age 70, comes reluctantly, followed by his niece , a bashful young woman who carried a blanket-wrapped bundle
Boris, darling
didn't know you were here
These public revels are hardly up your alley
came for the sake of my visiting niece
Alice
And Miranda, my great-niece
His huge hand lifts the blanket in Alice's arms, revealing a bald infant with enormous blue eyes
Karloff gurgles and coos at the child
And what do you make of our royal visitant
Perfectly charming
real lady
Of course she's a lady
What did you expect
hussy in tennis shoes
Whale looks up and discovers Clay standing a few feet behind Karloff
He is ogling two bosomy actresses who are listening intently to the monocled British consul
Whale's eyes try to focus Karloff and Clay together, his once and future monsters
Kay shouts to a passing photographer carrying a bulky Speed Graphic
Hey, you
With the camera
We got a historical moment here
Come get a picture of it
The man scans the scene for a famous face
This is Mr
James Whale, who made "Frankenstein" and "Bride of Frankenstein
"  and this is the Monster and his Bride
Clay looks up when he hears Kay identify Karloff
Oh, Karloff
Right
Karloff and Elsa drift into position next to Whale
The flash goes off, a snap and a crunch of light
Whale cringes in pain
(through clenched teeth) Don't you just love being famous
Another flash
From Whale's perspective, the bulb resembles nothing so much as the translucent tube of electrical current from Dr
Frankenstein's laboratory
Whale concentrates on his smile as another snap of light stabs his brain
He clutches Elsa Lanchester's hand
Are you all right, Jimmy
sharp nod from Whale
The photographer motions to Karloff's niece
Let me get one with Frankenstein holding the kid
Alice hands over the baby
Karloff gently cradles the child
Whale stands on his left, Elsa on his right
They all smile at the baby, who gurgles and points up
Whale follows the baby's gaze to the sky, where a large kite rocks and strains in a furious electrical storm
The camera flashes once, then again
Got it
Whale glances up -- the kite is gone
Thunder rumbles as the group starts to disperse
Whale nods to the faces exchanging good-byes
So good to see you again, James
He strolls off, clucking and cooing at his baby
Catch you before you go, Mr
Whale
'll make sure everybody gets sent a print
He goes off with the photographer
Elsa kisses Whale on the cheek
We'll be in touch, Jimmy
Good-bye
So nice to see you
Finally Whale is alone
He staggers to the deck chair and lowers himself sideways into the lawn chair
You okay
Whale gazes up at Clay
Tired
bit tired
Clay nods
Whale smiles at him
Are you enjoying yourself
Actually, no
feel a little out of place
Neither of us really belongs here
Must have been funny for you
Seeing your monsters again
Monsters
The only monsters
(closes his eyes) are here
Across the lawn, conversation has stopped
Birdlike shrieks come from all directions
Oh fuck
And we left the top down
You want to run for it
Run for what
Can't you see
It's raining
The rain is only a flickering of air, but people are jumping and shrieking, throwing coats over their heads as they dash toward the house
Here
He takes Whale under the arm, helps him up and escorts him to a small tent
On the patio, everyone shoves and squeezes to get through the one open door
Whale stares out, hypnotized by the deluge
From his , we see a young man step into the rain
Whale squints, is finally able to identify the man as Leonard Barnett
Whale's eyes follow Barnett as he emerges onto a new landscape, a scarred and barren battlefield
As the storm continues to rage: (
) Mr
Whale
Whale shifts his gaze to Clay
He takes a moment to orient himself
Let's get out of this funk hole You don't want to wait it out
Rain should let up soon
We're not sugar
We won't melt
Whale adjusts the brim of his hat and steps into the downpour
Clay has no choice except to follow
They walk briskly, the minute splashes on Whale's hat forming a ghostly aura of spray
- Whale opens the door and climbs in next to Clay
The roof slowly closes over them
better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia
Catch my death
Clay glances over, sees Whale sitting very wet and rigid, staring straight ahead
You all right, Mr
Whale
Whale blinks, slowly turns
There is a cracked look in his eyes
Jimmy
Please
Call me Jimmy
Clay smiles, starts to back the car out
'  -  - The hallway is pitch-dark as Whale and Clay enter
Hanna
Bring us some towels
We're drenched to the bone
No response
Blast her
If we soil her holy floor, it's her own damn fault
Whale goes squashing down the hall
Clay remains just inside the open door, prying off his shoes and peeling off his socks
He follows Whale into: '  -  - Whale stands over the table with his jaw open
don't believe this
He slides a note to Clay
It's not like her
(reading) Just a night out
Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man
Good
Let's get dry
'  -  - Whale stands just inside the closet, buttoning a crisp white shirt
He reaches for a red bow tie, closes the closet door
In the mirror, Leonard Barnett stands behind him, in uniform
Whale's eyes twinkle in surprise
He drapes the tie around his collar
What do you think
Barnett smiles his approval
'  -   - Clay opens the bathroom door, calls out
Mr
Whale
No answer
He goes to the top of the stairs and calls out
Where's those clothes you promised
Again, nothing
Rain ticks against the windows
Clay goes down the stairs
'  -  - Whale fiddles with the knot of his tie
He trusts me, you know
Barnett sits on the edge of the bed now
He smiles, a bit sadly
'  -   - There's glow coming from the bedroom, and the sound of Whale's voice
Mr
Whale
Jimmy
Clay steps slowly toward the door, pushes it open
He peers in
'  -  - Whale pulls on a blazer
Mr
Whale
Whale jumps
He slaps a hand over his chest, twists around, sees Clay
Oh, of course
Clayton
You finished your shower already
Ten minutes ago
Didn't you hear me calling
'm afraid not
Terribly sorry
(stands) believe  promised you some clothes
Whale crosses to the closet
Barnett is nowhere to be seen
You're much wider than  am
You won't want to attempt to get into my pants
No
Definitely not
Clay chuckles
Whale smiles
Very good, Clayton
He takes a robe from a hook on the closet door
Clay tries it on but it won't close over the towel
know
Whale opens a drawer, takes out a crewneck sweater
Absolutely swims on me, but should take care of your upper half
Clay pulls the sweater over his head
That only leaves the rest
You don't have any baggy shorts
Pajama bottoms
Sorry
My pajamas are tailored
Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel
No more immodest than a kilt, you know
Do  have any other choice
Very sporting of you, Clayton
Clay notices a framed drawing on the desk
Is that --
(nods) The only memento  ever kept
My original sketch for the Monster
He hands the sketch to Clay, who stares down at the famous flat head, hooded eyes, bolted neck of the Monster
Shall we
Clay puts down the sketch, starts into the hall
Whale turns back, sees Barnett standing by the window
Whale flips off the light and closes the door
'  -  - Clay sits at the kitchen table
Whale opens the refrigerator and brings out two plates wrapped in wax paper, and a bottle of beer for Clay
He pours himself a shot of Scotch from a decanter and sits down
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back
Can we try a few more sketches
thought you'd given up on my picture
'd like to try again
If you're game
Why not
Give us something to do while we wait
Clay munches on his sandwich
Whale pours himself another Scotch, takes a sip
Tell me something, Clayton
Do you believe in mercy killing
Never gave it much thought
Come now
'm sure you came across such situations in Korea wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy
Someone for whom death would be a blessing
Clay stops chewing
He stares down at his plate
never went
He takes a deep breath, looks up at Whale
never made it to Korea
But you said -- -- that  was a Marine
Which is true
You filled in the rest
see
Clay downs his beer, refills the glass
My old man was a Marine
He enlisted the day he turned seventeen
The Great War
(nods) By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over
He missed out
very lucky thing indeed
That's not the way he saw it
To him, it was like his life never got started
Nothing else really mattered
Definitely not his family
Whale gazes sympathetically at Clay
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St
Louis to reenlist
He was so damn excited
World War  was going to be his second chance
(sighs) They told him he was too old
fat nearsighted
Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family
Is that why you joined the Marines
For your father's sake
figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing
Hey, loved it too
chance to be a part of something important
Something bigger than yourself
What happened
didn't have the guts for it
look of surprise crosses Whale's face
mean, literally
My body screwed me up
Burst appendix
They gave me a medical discharge
All  thought about was, how am going to tell the old man
He breaks into a crooked smile
You know what he did when  called him
He laughed
He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel
Said it was a good lesson for me
Not to try to fill his shoes
'm very sorry
Them's the breaks, right
No war stories for this pup
That's where you're wrong, Clayton
You've just told one
very good story indeed
Whale lifts his glass in a toast
Clay empties his glass of beer
He motions toward the decanter
Do you mind
Not at all
He hands the decanter to Clay
'  -   - Clay sits in a straight-backed chair, smoking a cigarette and sipping his Scotch
Whale sketches from a wing chair across the room
Storm's getting worse
" perfect night for mystery and horror
The air itself is filled with monsters
" That's from your movie, right
"The only monsters are here
" don't remember that one
James Whale
This afternoon at the party
Whale looks up
said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here
"   was wondering which here you meant
don't recall
Memories of the war, perhaps
But that was so long ago
It can't still bother you
Oh, but it does
Especially in light of the journey 'm about to make
You're planning a trip
Whale's gaze remains dreamy and preoccupied as  of battle fill the room
relentless rat-a-tat of gunfire
The whistling of bombs
The tortured wailing of dying men
Whale stands, moves over to the window
Barnett
Barnett on the wire
Your friend
Whale gazes out at the storm
From his , we see a scarred and barren landscape, illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning
He caught his one night coming back from the reconnoiter
wouldn't take him out, but McGill did
Just to give the lad a taste
They were nearly home when a Maxim gun opened fire
-  (1917) We race along the open trench with Whale, the darkened sky intermittently punctured by bursts of gunfire
He reaches the periscope, pulls an enlisted man off it
From his , we see Barnett and McGill dodging bullets as they attempt to make their way back
(through clenched teeth) Come on
Come on
McGill leaps over the barbed wire of a forward trench
Barnett follows
Just as his feet leave the ground his chest is riddled by a fresh round of gunfire
Whale's eyes snap closed, trying to obliterate what they've just seen
(
) Barnett's body fell in wire as thick as briers
It was hanging there the next morning, a hundred yards from the line, too far out for anyone to fetch it
'  -   - Whale stares out impassively
We saw him at morning stand-to and evening stand-to
"Good morning, Barnett," we'd say each day
"How's ole Barnett looking this morning
"  "Seems a little peaky
Looks a little plumper
"  His wounds faced the other way and his hat shielded his eyes, so one could imagine he was napping on bedsprings
He hung there until we were relieved
We introduced him to the new unit before we marched out, speaking highly of his companionship
Clay's eyes are filled with pity
Oh, but we were a witty lot
Laughing at our dead
Telling ourselves it was our death too
But with each man who died, thought, "Better you than me, poor sod
" (bitterly) whole generation was wiped out by that war
Millions and millions of young men
Whale begins to hum, a tune we have heard before: Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling
Grave where thy victory
You survived it
It can't hurt you now
It's no good to dig it up
Oh no, my friend
It's digging itself up
There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it
All my diversions have abandoned me
Parties
Reading
Painting
Work
Love
All gone to me now
Whale remains perfectly still, staring out the window
Clay deliberates a moment, then puts down his drink next to the decanter of Scotch
He stands and yanks the neck of the sweater over his face, then tosses it on the sofa
Whale blinks at the reflection in the glass, not yet understanding
You wanted to draw me like a Greek statue
All right, then
Clay pulls at the knot, lets go of the towel
He defiantly parks his hands on his hips
There
Not so bad
Whale continues to stare at the reflection, his back to Clay, his eyes wide and expressionless
He turns slowly, fully expecting the vision to evaporate
When he sees that Clay is truly naked he mutters softly under his breath
So it is going to happen after all
What'd you say
Whale doesn't respond
Finally he opens his mouth to take a breath
No
It won't do
What won't do
You are much too human
What did you expect
Bronze
Don't move
Whale moves abruptly across the room
He walks past Clay
'  -   - Whale passes quickly through the dining room and out to the kitchen
'  -  - Whale reaches for the hatbox, which sits on top of a garbage can
Suddenly a large hand appears on the box
Whale gasps when a flash of lightning reveals the face of the Monster
The Monster growls out an inarticulate greeting
He picks up the box and hands it to Whale
'  -   - Whale removes the lid, sets the hatbox on the sofa
would like you to wear this
Whale steps back
Clay takes the box and covers his lap with it
He lifts out the gas mask
Why
For the artistic effect
The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask
It's quite striking
don't know
Please, Clayton
Just for a minute
Long enough for me to see the effect
It's from the first World War, isn't it
(nods) There are straps in back
Clay fits the mask on the top of his head and draws it down
The living room turns brownish yellow in the thick glass goggles
Let me help you
Whale is suddenly behind him
Clay's vision is enclosed in two round windows, so he can't see Whale buckling the second strap
Now what
Mouth muffled by the inhalator, Clay hears his voice from inside his head
Whale comes around to stand in front of him
He grins as he steps back to examine Clay
Clay nervously taps his knees with his hands
All right
Let's take it off now
What was that
It's too tight
Clay raises his voice to make himself heard
He reaches back to undo the buckles
Allow me
Whale steps in past the goggles
We don't want to tear the straps
Clay drops his hands so Whale can undo the buckles
But nothing happens
Clay turns left and right
Oh yes
am still here
Two hands grip Clay's shoulders
What steely muscles, Clayton
Whale's hands squeeze
Clay grabs the frame of his seat, to stop his arms from automatically swinging a fist
Whale's hand slides over Clay's shoulder to his arm, caressing the tattoo
Clay jerks his shoulder to shake Whale off
Just take off the fucking mask
Relax, Clayton
can't hear you
can't hear a word
Whale presses his lips to Clay's tattoo
Clay's muscles tense from head to toe
What a solid brute you are
Whale's tongue moves down Clay's arm
No
Maybe this, then
The hand slides over Clay's stomach toward his lap
The tattooed arm swings backward, slamming an elbow against Whale's skull
Clay jumps from the chair, knocking into an end table
The glass and crystal decanter fall to the floor
The lamp spills over and the room goes dark
Clay's ankle is caught by the sofa leg and he hits the floor, jamming the inhalator against his mouth
He quickly gets up, on his knees and elbows, pulling at the mask
Flashes of lightning strobe the room as Whale collapses over Clay's back and holds on
Oh yes
have you now
strap breaks
Clay rips the mask off
Get the fuck off
Whale's hand squeezes between Clay's legs
What will you do to get yourself back
Clay jabs with his elbow, flipping Whale on his back
His body straddles Whale's and pins him, face to face
'm not that way
Get it through your fucking head
don't want to mess with you
Oh, but you feel good, Clayton
His hands clasp Clay's hips
Clay's fist opens as it comes down; he slaps Whale across the face
That didn't even sting
You're not such a real man after all
Are you
Clay whacks Whale's face again
Wait until  tell my friends  had you naked in my arms
Won't they be surprised
haven't done a damn thing with you
Oh, but you have
You undressed for me
kissed you
even touched your prick
How will you be able to live with yourself
Clay snatches Whale's wrist before it can touch his crotch
With his other hand he picks up the heavy crystal decanter
What the hell do you want from me
Whale tilts his face up for another blow
want you to kill me Clay freezes
He stares down at the old man with white hair and wild eyes lying beneath him
Break my neck
Or strangle me
It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me
Please, Clayton
We've come this far
You're crazy
Whale's eyes glimmer in the sporadic bursts of lightning
Exactly, 'm losing my mind
Every day, another piece goes
Soon there will be nothing left
Look at the sketch  made of you
Clay turns to the sketch pad, which lies on the floor next to Whale
The page is filled with nothing but doodles and scrawls
Look, if you want to die do it yourself
No,  don't want to die alone
But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable
They say you never see the one with your name on it
But  want to see death coming at me
want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face
Your face
Think, Clayton
You'd be my second Monster
Almost as famous as the first
It would be the great adventure you've yearned for
war story for both of us to share
Clay's breathing comes in quick, panicked bursts
You'd be fully exonerated, 've taken care of that
wrote a note, 'll even leave you the house, the car
Clay's body starts to tremble
Do it now, Clayton
Make me invisible
Clay lets out a howl -- his shoulders heave and shake
am not your monster
He climbs off Whale, crawls away, his body collapsing in wracking, anguished sobs
Whale opens his eyes, gazes at Clay
What have  done
(sits up) Oh, selfish, selfish fool have lost my mind
He forces himself to his feet
What was  thinking
Whale picks up the towel and moves over to Clay
You're a softhearted bloke bloody pussycat
Whale places the towel around Clay's shoulders
My deepest apologies
Can you ever forgive me
Clay doesn't look up
suppose not
(a bone-crushing sigh) Good God,  am tired
really must go to bed
Whale starts slowly down the hall
'  -  - Whale sits on the edge of the bed, tugs the bowtie from his collar
Clay taps on the door, opens it
You okay
Oh Clayton
Did  hurt you
Nothing  didn't deserve
Need some help
Pray you, undo this button
He lifts his chin and points to his collar
can never manage it when 'm tired
Clay leans in to open the button
His face is only six inches from Whale's
Do you believe people come into our lives for a reason
Clay doesn't answer
Whale turns, breaking their shared gaze
can undress myself, thank you
(steps back) All right
Whale hauls his legs up and stretches out on the bed
When you die
be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle -- You'll feel better tomorrow
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Whale smiles fondly at him
Goodnight, Clayton
Clay pulls the door shut and it clicks
He stands there a moment
'  -  - Clay shakes open a bedsheet and wraps himself in it
'  -   - Clay finds a pack of cigarettes on the floor and lights one, then sets the furniture back up
He picks up the gas mask from beside the sofa, shoves it into its box
Clay sits in the wing-back chair, props his feet on the hassock, adjusting the sheet around his shoulders
We : '  -  - Whale bolts up in bed
An electrical storm flashes and cracks in the window
Whale gets out of bed, stares outside
From his , the lawn is a barren slope covered with stumps
Whale turns on the desk lamp, sits
He pulls out a piece of paper
- We're back to the scene that opened the movie, a flat-topped creature stumbling through the mud
flash of lightning reveals Clay's face
He turns, signals for Whale to follow him
Whale joins Clay on a slight rise of ground, the rim of a crater
Clay points down into it
- The crater is full of bodies gathered around a pool of water
Whale stumbles down, reaches the bottom and bends over the nearest corpse in khaki
It is Leonard Barnett
There are no wounds on his body, no rips or gaping holes
His eyes are closed in dreamless sleep
Whale looks up and sees that Clay is gone
The only other living creature is an owl, which blinks wearily at him
Whale lies down, finding a spot next to Barnett
He takes a last breath and closes his eyes
We  : '  -   - roar of bells blasts Clay awake
The telephone is ringing
hard pair of shoes thunder out to answer it
Hello
Oh, Mr
David
Clay blinks at the sight of Hanna in black dress and white apron, chattering on the phone by the far wall
No, no, he did not tell me
But no problem
will make breakfast
She scoldingly cuts her eyes at Clay
Ten
Very good, then
Good-bye
She hangs up and faces Clay with a stern frown
It's not what you think
have brought you your clothes
All  ask is that you get dressed and go
We are having a guest for breakfast
need to talk to you about Mr
Whale
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me
Maybe
But  still need to talk
Do  have time for a cup of coffee before  go
blame my daughter for keeping me out so late
only hope you did not get him excited
It could give him a new stroke
She stomps into the kitchen
Clay gets up, slips on his undershorts
He's zipping up his chinos when she comes out again with a breakfast tray
She hands him a cup of coffee
Thanks
(quickly) Why do you do it
What do  do
Take care of Mr
Whale like he was your flesh and blood
It is my job
did it when he was happy and it was easy
It is only fair  do it now when he is ill
(picks up the tray) Enough talk
must wake up the master
She marches around the corner towards Whale's bedroom
Clay hears her knocking on a door
(
) Mr
Jimmy
Morning, Mr
Jimmy
Clay pulls on his shirt
Hanna comes back around the corner
What have you done with him
put him to bed
He's not there
She goes to the foot of the stairs and shouts: Mr
Jimmy
Mr
Jimmy
Hanna starts up the stairs
Look for him
Clay reaches for his socks when he notices an envelope on the floor next to the chair
He picks it up
On the front is scrawled the word ''
Clay opens the envelope
Inside is Whale's original sketch of the Monster's head
He turns it over
There is a message written on the back
No
Clay drops the sketch, looks out
He sees something
'  -  - Clay crosses the patio, hurtles down the slope
'  -  - Clay leaps headfirst into the water
Whale rests lightly on his back, with an upward sway of straight white hair
Clay hauls the body toward the side
Almost there
Almost there
He gets an arm around Whale's chest and heaves the body over the curb
he climbs out, drags the body forward to rest in the grass
He grabs the wrist
Nothing
Son of a bitch
You crazy son of a bitch
Clay straddles Whale's thighs and applies pressure on his rib cage
But it's no use
Clay sits up and takes a deep breath
Ohhh
Hanna comes down the path, her run slowing to a walk
She stares at Clay
didn't do it
This wasn't me
Oh, Mr
Jimmy
He wanted me to kill him, but didn't
He did it himself
He says here good-bye
find it in his room
He is sorry, he says
He has had a wonderful life
She waves a folded piece of paper
You poor, foolish man
You couldn't wait for God to take you in his time
Clay slowly stands up
Hanna looks around in panic
You must leave
You were not here this morning
But  didn't do this
The police will not know that
They will want to investigate
We have his note
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr
Jimmy
Please, Clayton
It will be better if find the body alone
But how're you going to explain this
(points at the body) How did you get him out of the pool
You are right
Yes
We must put him back
They both hesitate, looking down at Whale
Then Clay drags the body parallel with the pool
Hanna stoops over to adjust the collar of Whale's shirt
Poor Mr
Jimmy
We do not mean disrespect
You will keep better in water
She nods to Clay
He rolls the body over and it splashes on its belly
It bounces a moment in the waves of the splash, then begins to sink
As it drops, the air in the chest slowly flips the body around
Looking up at them with open eyes, Whale sinks backward into the thickening light
His arms trail upward and the hands lightly flutter as if waving good-bye
The melancholy sound of a solo violin pierces the silence as we  : /
'  - black-and-white scene from "Bride of Frankenstein
"  The old   plays a mournful lullaby on his violin while the  listens outside, moved by the music
He smashes open the door of the hut in an effort to get closer to the soul-soothing sound
The blind man stops playing, looks up
Who is it
You're welcome, my friend, whoever you are
The Monster attempts to communicate, manages only a plaintive moan
The blind man stands
cannot see you
cannot see anything
You must please excuse me
But  am blind
The Monster holds out his burned hands
Come in, my poor friend
No one will hurt you here
If you're in trouble, perhaps  can help you
The old man touches the Monster, who recoils with a defensive growl
Can you not speak
It's strange
Perhaps you're afflicted too cannot see and you cannot speak
-  (1972) , 10, lies on the living room carpet, staring raptly at the movie playing on the large Zenith console
The house is small but tidy and comfortable
(
) It's been a long time since any human being came into this hut shall look after you
And you will comfort me
On the tv screen, the old man starts to cry, then collapses onto the Monster's chest
thick tear rolls down the Monster's cheek
Clay Boone sits on the sofa, a baby on his lap
He's 40 now, his hair starting to thin but still closely cropped at the top and sides
On the tv, daylight fills the hut
The blind man and the Monster share a meal
We are friends, you and
Friends
Friends
Before you came,  was all alone
It is bad to be alone
Alone, bad
Friend, good
He takes the old man's hand
Friend, good
The blind man nods
On the sofa, Clay watches his son watch the movie
-  () color promo for "Chiller Theater" fills the screen
Clay turns off the set
Time for bed, sport
Michael groans, slowly stands
What'd you think of the movie
Pretty cool
Better than most monster movies
knew the guy who made it
Michael glances skeptically at his father
Come on, Dad
Is this another one of your stories
Here
Clay unfolds Whale's sketch of the Monster, hands it to his son
It's his original sketch of the Monster
Michael turns over the sketch
On the back, scrawled in block letters: "   --
" This is for real
Clay nods
At the same time, his wife  appears in the doorway
pretty, cheerful woman in her mid-30s
The trash, Clay
Before it rains
Okay
Clay kisses the top of his son's head
Off to bed
'  - Clay carries a large metal bin down the tidy lawn
The sky momentarily brightens with a silent flash of lightning
Clay gazes up at the electrical storm
He glances back at his house, sees Dana cradling the baby in an upstairs window
The skies open with a shattering crash of thunder
Clay tilts up his face, drinks in the cool rain
Then he extends his arms and staggers along the sidewalk, imitating the Monster's famous lurch
We  , revealing a sleepy neighborhood of small houses and neat lawns, until Clay is only a small dot in the landscape
