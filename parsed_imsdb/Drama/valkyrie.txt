Written by Christopher McQuarrie & Nathan Alexander January 8, 2007 swear by God this sacred oath: That  shall render unconditional obedience to Adolf Hitler, the Fuhrer of the German Reich, and that  shall at all times be prepared, as a brave soldier, to give my life for this oath
1                                                      1 And from out of the blackness a voice
man speaking in German - faint at first, crackling over the radio
Subtitles translate the voice of Adolf Hitler
(
) My comrades
Once again -  don't know how many times it has been now - an attempt has been made on my life
speak to you tonight for two reasons
First, so that you can hear my voice and know that  am unhurt
And second, so that you may know the details of a crime without parallel in German history

lonely airfield
and his  stand rigid by a gleaming limousine
The officer's uniform denotes a man of high rank - a man of weight
: -    - Tresckow smokes a cigarette, his arm the only movement in the frame
the airstrip is surrounded by Army Group vehicles and personnel -  and escorts, photographers, aides, Nazi party dignitaries, etc
- all frozen like statues
Eerie
Whatever is going on, it's big
The faint sound of distant airplanes brings tension, subtle but sharp
Approaching the field are three Focke-Wulf 200 Condors escorted by a formation of Messerschmitt-109 fighters
Silence gives way to an escalating roar that seems to have no maximum
One by one, the massive four-engine Condors land while the fighters roar overhead and circle the airfield
The Condors come to rest and, needing no introduction: alights from the lead plane, obscured by the surrounding platoon of heavily armed
(Note: Hitler is obscured throughout the entire sequence proving how inaccessible he truly was
) 2
Tresckow and his Aide step forward to greet Hitler, but they are pushed back by  guards
The Fuhrer marches past without so much a glance at his hosts or their waiting limo
To Tresckow's surprise, a second limousine roars onto the airfield from out of nowhere
It is dirty, the windscreen spotted with bugs from a long drive
Hitler gets in the dirty car and speeds off
(
) It's not so much your car he doesn't trust
It's your driver
Tresckow and his Aide turn
Standing behind them is: :    - The consummate Nazi, he is always scribbling notes in a small datebook
Without looking up, Brandt hops into the limo they brought for Hitler
Tresckow and his Aide share a glance and get in beat later they are speeding after Hitler's car
3
-                               3 Est
Hitler's headquarters for the Eastern Front is bustling
Security is tight, everyone is on edge

-   -                   4 Long tables packed with  straining their necks to get a glimpse of their leader at the head table, but he is obscured by his detail of  guards
dares to approach
The room falls silent
'   places a tray before the Fuhrer, producing a knife and fork, cutting a bite
We think he is going to hand feed Hitler until he places the food in his own mouth, chewing slowly, deliberately
He swallows
We wait for him to die
When he doesn't, Hitler begins to eat
The rest of the room relaxes slightly and digs in
: Seated further down the table are Tresckow and his Aide
Between them, once again, is Brandt, eating like a pig, still making notes in his book
Tresckow stares
3
Managing the Fuhrer's security must be quite an undertaking
(in between mouthfuls) Irregularity is the Fuhrer's precaution of choice
can assure you he's safe here
Relax, Brandt
Enjoy your meal
Brandt's look says, "Don't be ridiculous
" He cleans his plate in seconds
Then he gently dabs his mouth, takes out his datebook and starts writing - once again the precise man we saw on the airfield
(') understand you're returning to Berlin this afternoon
Brandt nods
(') Could  trouble you to deliver a package to Colonel Stieff
Brandt nods again, too busy writing to notice the knowing glance Tresckow shares with his Aide
5
-   -           5 Tense silence
Tresckow and his Aide are hunched over two bottles of Cointreau on a large desk next to: `' - a small black plastic casing held together by magnets and adhesive tape
Tresckow inserts a short, pencil-shaped fuse through the narrow opening
All that remains exposed is a small glass capsule
The trigger
Tresckow turns his attention to the bottles of Cointreau
6
-                                       6 The Condors' engines roar, ready for take off
Soldiers stand at attention as Hitler boards
Brandt is with him, scribbling in his ever-present datebook
4
Tresckow and his Aide approach
Tresckow gently handles a carefully wrapped package
: Tresckow presses a key against the side of the package, crushing the glass capsule inside
The explosive armed now, he hands it to Brandt
With my regards to Colonel Stieff
Brandt accepts the gift, looking up from his book
He studies the familiar shape
Cointreau
You better hope  don't get thirsty on the flight
Tresckow politely smiles, hiding his nerves, having just handed a bomb to Hitler's Head of Security
Brandt unknowingly carries it onto the plane with Hitler
The door to the Condor is sealed behind him along with, we hope, the Fuhrer's fate
Tresckow looks at his watch and we  : 7
-   -              7 clock shows us that thirty minutes have passed
Tresckow and his Aide are seated on either side of a desk staring at the telephone
Smoking
Waiting
: 8
-   -              8 Three hours later
The ashtray is overflowing but Tresckow and his Aide have not moved
Finally
The phone barely rings before Tresckow answers
He doesn't say a word, he only nods and hangs up
He's
landed
It takes a moment for the gravity of this to set in
What about the
Tresckow is already dialing the telephone
5
Get me Colonel Brandt
(staying cool) Colonel
Tresckow
trust you landed safely
hate to trouble you but there's been a bit of a mix up
It seems you have the wrong bottles for Colonel Stieff
You
do still have the package
Long pause
Torture
Then: (') can be at your office first thing tomorrow morning to pick it up
Terribly sorry for the inconvenience
Thank you
Tresckow slowly hangs up the phone
Do you think he knows
Tresckow shrugs, opening a bottle of Cointreau and pouring two glasses with a shaking hand
There's only one way to be sure
9
-                                9 Est
An early morning fog blankets the ground, obscuring our view
Eerie
10
-  -                      10 Footsteps echo through the cavernous hallways
Tresckow marches with purpose through the numerous security checkpoints
It is a long, suspenseful walk
He is aware of someone walking up behind him, getting closer
We think he's done for, but a , -  overtakes him and whispers: What happened
:    - 6
can only guess the altitude caused the fuse to malfunction
First the beer hall, Memorial Day - now this
Someone is watching over that sonofabitch,  swear it
We've been discovered
Tresckow halts and faces Olbricht, expressionless
What makes you think- Oster's been arrested
The Gestapo came for him last night
Tresckow thinks for a beat and resumes walking
Olbricht hurries after him
(') Did you hear what  said
The Gestapo could have arrested him for anything
Find a replacement
There's no one we can trust
Not in Berlin
Then stop looking in Berlin
Just then, they approach the final threshold, a guards an office marked: Olbricht stops, regarding the door with dread
But Tresckow presses on, reaching the door, about to enter when: Your pistol please
Oh shit
Tresckow plays it cool, removing his pistol from its holster and handing it over
And with a nod to Olbricht, Tresckow squares his shoulders and enters Brandt's office
7
11
- '  -     11 Brandt is at his desk, writing as always
Tresckow notices Brandt's pistol sitting within arm's reach clock ticks loudly
Imagine it
Then wait
Finally: Brandt puts his pen down, stands and salutes, but the gesture is almost casual
Pure formality
You'll forgive me, General
This little round-up has had me writing reports all day
Round-up
Dissenters
plot against the Fuhrer
Tresckow makes a good show of laughing that off
Who would even have the balls
You'd be surprised, the number of cowards in this army that would be willing to stand against the Reich
Only if the Fuhrer were dead, of course
Of course
It's one thing to think you know what's right
What matters is having the strength to do it
Clunk
Brandt produces the package, putting it on the desk in front of him
(') Is this what you've come for
Pause
Staying cool, Tresckow reaches for it: (') Perhaps we should open it
Tresckow freezes, studies Brandt's cold smile
8
beg your pardon
Brandt sits back, smiles
Does he know
You've come a long way
You must be thirsty
wonder how the Fuhrer, who does not partake, would feel about an officer who did so on duty
Colonel Brandt
Brandt's smile fades
We can't decide why
He picks up the package carelessly
Tresckow stays cool despite the armed explosive just a few feet away
took you for another sort, General
And we realize he really did just want a drink
He knows nothing about what the package hides
And  you
Tresckow reaches out, grabbing the package and: The sound of an

Moving rapidly through an olive grove in the otherwise wasted desert
column of tanks, trucks and heavy equipment flow by with a sense of barely contained chaos
Men dismantle tents from around others dumping documents into burning oil drums
In the middle of it we find a tall, handsome young officer (age 35)
He wears an Afrika Korps uniform complete with Colonel's badges, staying cooler than the other side of your pillow
He directs men this way and that, holding back panic
:     - , 10TH

jeep speeds up to him from the distance, driven by a
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir
new headquarters has been established at Mezzouna
'm to take you there
Stauffenberg looks over the scene, expressionless
Now they tell us to disengage - a day late
No matter how many times we tell Command the reality, they always manage to leave us- But he stops himself, containing his rage
Colonel, the enemy is less than five kilometers from here
You've done all you can
Stauffenberg glances at his right hand, contemplating a ring on his finger
After a beat: wonder
Was there even a point in our coming to Tunis
To get taken prisoner, it seems
Stauffenberg smiles bitterly and gets in the jeep as: The first bomb explodes before we even see the tight formation of  - overhead
Fighter planes strafe with machine-guns
Artillery blasts strike in front and behind the retreating column
The 10th Panzer Division is trapped
Panic hits the column like a tidal wave
Stauffenberg taps the Young Lieutenant who drives into the melee
Soldiers abandon their vehicles but cover is in short supply and many are left in the open
So they run
Dozens are gunned down by the assailing fighters
The survivors watch in horror as the fighters slowly turn to make another run
In a panic, the soldiers run the other direction, halted by a jeep blocking the way
Stauffenberg stands in the passenger seat
10
The men calm when they see the Colonel, trusting him
They turn and watch the formation of planes complete their turn and bear down, gaining speed
Knees tense, some jerking from the natural inclination to flee
(') ,
They do, despite the menace of the planes' engines growing louder, meaner

His finger tenses on the trigger and
14
-                                         14 The mob of soldiers breaks - some right, some left - as the fighters open fire on what had been the center of their mass
Unable to change course quickly enough, they spray their lead into the sand
In that same instant, Stauffenberg drops into his seat, the Young Lieutenant jams the jeep in drive and a wave of hot lead misses them by mere feet
Stauffenberg watches his men regroup, waiting out the turning squadron
They've got the idea now
He turns to his Lieutenant who smiles admiringly
But Stauffenberg's eyes widen
He grabs his Lieutenant's head and jams it down, revealing a coming up from behind
Stauffenberg ducks out of frame, shielding the Young Lieutenant with his body
Blood sprays across the jeep's windshield before bullets rip it to pieces, leaving only clear blue African sky
And then the

fast clicking
Heels on linoleum
beautiful, dignified woman keeps herself from running
She is: (30), Stauffenberg's wife and mother of his four children
Beside her is (38), Stauffenberg's older brother
They reach the door of a private hospital room just as   comes out
Awkward pause
Mrs
Stauffenberg
(nodding, gesturing to Berthold) The Colonel's brother, Berthold
Perhaps before you see the Colonel we should go to my office and- will see my husband now
The Doctor wants to argue but Nina's eyes shut him down
He opens the door and they enter to find: 16
-                          16 mass of mummy-like bandages with only small openings around the mouth and one eye
The arms and hands are also wrapped in heavy dressing
No movement but for the rise and fall of the patient's chest
Berthold cannot look
Holding back her anguish, Nina bravely turns to the Doctor
"Well
" He's been constant with fever but he refuses any pain killers
The right hand has been amputated above the wrist
He's lost the fourth and fifth fingers on the left
We
couldn't save the left eye
Berthold covers his face
Nina is a rock
His ring
don't- 12
He had a ring on his right hand
Where is it
'm sorry
His hand was amputated in the field
'm afraid- Thank you
As in: "That will be all
" The Doctor leaves
Nina sits beside her husband
She shows him a photo of - three boys and a girl
Stauffenberg tries to speak but can't
His eye begins to tear
Nina removes a ring from her finger, placing it on a chain with a cross she takes from around her neck
It is identical to the ring Stauffenberg wore in Africa
: The engraving inside the band - finis- initium [end-beginning]
Nina places the ring and chain on her husband's chest, her hand lingering
She cannot hold the tears back any longer
She stands and turns away, not wanting her husband to see
Berthold takes her place
Stauffenberg struggles to speak
Berthold puts an ear to the hole where Stauffenberg's mouth is - making out his question, even if we can't
Berthold debates answering, then: We've lost North Africa
: That one eye staring at us closes
17
-                            17 Stauffenberg's bandages are gone - a black patch covering what had been his left eye
The chain with the cross and ring from Nina hangs around his neck
lies motionless in the next bed
man's belongings tell you more about him than he ever could
Stauffenberg's side of the room is neatly arranged, books of poetry and philosophy are well worn
Beside them are his own writings - the print meticulous and flowing
Up to a certain date
After that a new, child-like hand has taken over
13
family photograph shows the Stauffenberg's of another generation - wealthy aristocrats from a bygone era
He is a teenager in this photo and smiling broadly
smile he left in Africa
Stauffenberg's three fingers push a cotton ball under his eyepatch to dab the empty socket
Then he goes to button his shirt
Holding his collar in his teeth, he tries to do the buttons with the use of only three fingers on his left hand
It is heartbreaking to watch
He is about to give up when he notices a figure looming in the doorway
General Olbricht
He winces at the sight of Stauffenberg's deformities
don't know what  ever did with ten
Olbricht manages a smile, he moves to speak, but Stauffenberg beats him to it
(') 'm wanted in Berlin
Olbricht nods
(') Are you asking as a member of the High Command
Olbricht contemplates his answer
He carefully closes the door behind him, nervously glancing at the patient in the next bed
(') You can speak openly, General
He died just before you came in
Awkward moment
Finally: We could use your help
'm a field officer
Olbricht steps closer, speaking openly now
This war can't be won in the field
14
That's unfortunate for me
You can't honestly believe you'll make a difference on the front- 'm a soldier, General
serve my country
It makes no sense
You opposed Hitler, you opposed the war
The people chose otherwise and here we are
Now we have to win
You know what will happen if we don't
If we win, it will still be Hitler's Germany
We all took an oath, General
Olbricht nods, resigning
He realizes it is no use
Finally, he produces a blue velvet box, opening it to reveal a brilliant gold medal
On behalf of the Fuhrer
Stauffenberg takes the medal and studies it
'm a twin, you know
Olbricht is as confused as we are
didn't
My brother died the day after we were born
'm sorry
What the hell is he talking about
15
was lying in the desert, covered in blood, sure  was going to die
tried to think about my wife, my children
But my mind kept drifting to my dead brother
How would finally be with him
How would finally be whole again
He snaps out of his thoughts, holding up his arm
(') This is my reward for what happened to my men
It's all  deserve
Stauffenberg nonchalantly tosses the medal into a nearby bedpan

three fingered hand enters the frame, gently placing a medal identical to the one just saw
: Stauffenberg, done up in his finest dress uniform, placing said medal on an unconscious
stands behind him, carrying a silver tray stacked with   containing such medals
: Stauffenberg stands between two long rows of beds, each with Those that can respond to Stauffenberg do so with reverence
The ward is eerily silent
With only three fingers, Stauffenberg cannot pin the medals to his men
He has to settle for simply laying them on a each soldier's chest or a pillow
With each medal he presents, the task becomes harder to watch
Suddenly, Stauffenberg freezes, finding himself looking at    - his driver in Africa
The young man is a mass of bandages, his legs gone, his face smashed
: Stauffenberg's face - the reality of Africa taking the wind out of him
Over this we hear a familiar clicking of heels and: 16

-  -                          19 Stauffenberg's boots pound the floor as he rushes for the door, desperate to get out, barely able to breathe
At first he does not hear: (
) Colonel

Stauffenberg turns, ready to strike
He stops when he sees the Doctor holding a small, square box
Another sort medal perhaps
don't want the damn th- The Doctor opens the box to reveal: sitting atop a layer of satin, staring blankly back at Stauffenberg
Creepy
When will you be going back to the front
Beat
Stauffenberg just stares back at the eyeball
'm not going to the front
'm needed in Berlin
20
-                                      20 The city sleeps
An unsettling image knowing that, in war, quiet can turn to chaos in the blink of an eye

-                                  22 Chaos
The air is thick with cigar smoke and harsh words
- some officers, some civilians - are fighting bitterly, everyone talking at once
Stauffenberg enters unnoticed, escorted in by the who immediately ducks out again
Stauffenberg scans the faces in the room
We recognize Olbricht and Tresckow
With them we find
distinguished gentleman in his early sixties: :    - , 1938
Beside him is a rough-hewn, charismatic man despite his 59 years
face millions might follow
He is: :
-
, 1937
And finally, a grandfatherly sort with surprisingly kind eyes, sitting outside the fight - tired and saddened by it
:   - , 1938
He is not a man, he's a lunatic
He doesn't drink, he doesn't fuck
He has no weakness to exploit, no vice to manipulate
His only passion is complete control
How can you expect to reason with him
After this most recent failure 'd say we've no other choice
Confront Hitler now and you'll end up with piano wire for a neck-tie
Our only option is the central solution
He's a man like any other
Flesh and blood
Take him head on and- 18
'll say this for you, Doctor
You're certainly delusional enough to take Hitler's place
(eyes narrowing) When that day comes, 'll be sure to remember you
doubt you'll remember much of anything
Dammit, Tresckow- And the shouting resumes
It is Beck who finally sees Stauffenberg
He touches Tresckow's arm
He, in turn, nudges Olbricht and so on
moment later, the room is silent, all eyes on the Colonel
Everyone is a little embarrassed
Olbricht clears his throat: Gentlemen, may  present Colonel Stauffenberg
He's been reassigned to my office at the War Ministry
(to Stauffenberg) Colonel, may  introduce- These men need no introduction
Beck stands, shaking Stauffenberg's hand
apologize for this unfortunate
spectacle
On behalf of everyone, welc- But before he can finish, Beck is seized with a gravelly cough that sends an uncomfortable chill through the room
He is very ill
(to the others) haven't welcomed him
Not yet
Where does he stand
For God's sake- 19
(re: Stauffenberg) He's a field officer
He knows the army better than any of us
want to hear his opinion
(to Stauffenberg) All right
What do you think, Colonel
Confront Hitler, force him to resign
Or the central solution
But before Stauffenberg can answer: "Central Solution
" You soldiers are all the same
Say what you mean
That's a laugh coming from a politician
The army will follow diplomats before they follow assassins
They follow a butcher now
What difference does it- What makes you think the army will follow you at all
The room quiets down
Beck hides a slight smile
He likes Stauffenberg already
(') Oust him, kill him
That isn't what matters
How do you plan to take control of the government when Hitler is gone
Silence
Then a wave of laughter
"The balls on this guy
" beg your pardon, Colonel, but you are in the presence of men who would have been Hitler's inner circle
Instead we resigned
We put our principles above personal gain
20
We have the have the respect of the people
And the army
With all respect, sir, you put too much faith in your popularity
(to Goerdeler, pointed) All of you do
Now see here, Colonel- You said yourself, 'm a field officer
You all may understand government, but  know the men great many of them may hate Hitler, but they all fear him - they fear Himmler, Goebbels, the whole of the Reich
That kind of fear won't just die with Hitler
And as for respect: the army, and the people, respect only one thing
Authority
And if just one man questions that authority, you can lose them all
(to Beck, pointed) They were fooled into following Hitler
How will you fool them - force them - into following you
Pause
The conspirators look at one another again, unsure of how to answer
For Stauffenberg it is a dreadful revelation
23
-  -                              23 depressed Stauffenberg walks down the deserted night streets
Silent but for the echo of his footsteps
Eerie
Across the street, an   peers nervously out her window
The instant Stauffenberg makes eye contact she steps back, drawing the curtains
Afraid
He approaches a cozy brick cottage - the Berlin home he shares with his brother, Berthold
He is surprised when he looks through the window to find laughing and playing - the sound of music on a phonograph
Bittersweet
21
In the next house over, he catches sight of a , the picture of Aryan youth, watching him suspiciously from the upstairs window
It seems everyone is watching everyone in Hitler's German
24
-                             24 Stauffenberg comes through the front door, the sound of the phonograph blaring now
Meet the children: (9),  (7),  (5),  (2)
They chase one another around the house in their pajamas making such a racket that the phonograph skips
(It will do so throughout the scene
) The children see Stauffenberg and charge, screaming: He scoops them up, one by one, and kisses them, instantly putting the day's events behind him
Berthold follows them into the room, smiling
(to children) What are you doing here
thought left you in Bamberg
(to Berthold) It's a wonderful surprise
Thank you, brother
, (Etc
) 25
-  -                   25 Nina nervously fixes her hair in the mirror a small datebook with a smaller monthly calendar in the corner of the page
red dot marks one date in particular, followed by black dots for each day that has passed since
She turns sideways, smoothing her dress over her belly
In every way she indicates to us that she is pregnant
She tucks the datebook under some sundries in her luggage and rushes down to greet her husband
We stay in the room, hearing her greet Stauffenberg Laughter at children's antics we cannot see
The phonograph skips
More laughter
22
We want to go see them in their happiness
Instead we linger on Stauffenberg's dresser - neat and orderly
We focus on a photograph of the family from happier times
Beside it is a small box containing a glass eye
26
-   -              26 Stauffenberg and Nina dance with one another to the delight of the children
We gradually   tight on their faces, watching an entire conversation take place without dialogue
Each has a secret the other can guess
Stauffenberg looks at Nina, then her belly, first realizing and then questioning
Nina smiles and nods
Stauffenberg hugs her, delighted, but his delight is tainted with worry
Then the tables turn
Nina looks at Stauffenberg, as if divining his secret
His face never changes - a statue with that same tainted smile
In her face we see slow, grim realization
She may not know exactly what is going on, but she knows it is something
She does her best to keep smiling for the children
After the longest of moments, she nods
"All right
" Then she puts her head on his shoulder, hiding her fears
It is an important moment
Read it again, taking the time to picture it in your mind
Then leave it alone
Done right it's a beautiful scene about a man, his family and the fate of the world
27
-   -              27 Nina reads a story to the children in the adjoining room - an idyllic scene
The sound of the phonograph is soft and constant
Stauffenberg picks at a late dinner, now adept at the use of only three fingers
Berthold sits across from him, deeply troubled by whatever conversation we have just missed
They speak in hushed tones
What do you mean you quit
came to join the Resistance, not some sewing circle of discarded generals and politicians
23
Beck is a just and capable man
As for Goerdeler, well, he's popular
He'll make a good Chancellor
Like Hitler before him, yes
Lately have to wonder if Germany is even fit to choose her own destiny
You can't blame the people for this
You have to see the beginning of something to know how it'll end
It's no different than a farmer watching the corn grow
One day it's over his head
Plenty of people thought- The greatest offenders are not the ones who thought better but the ones who sensed better
What are you trying to say
seem to remember you telling me about reports from the Ukraine - the  forcing Jews to dig their own graves
You said then that Hitler should be removed
An officer's duty, you said
What's changed
said senior officers
The only men that can get to him
Perhaps it doesn't matter that you succeed
Stauffenberg looks at Berthold like he is crazy, but: (') Perhaps it only matters that you try
Don't you see
Someone has to stand up and show the world that not all of us were like him
24
Even if they could remove Hitler, they can't hope to seize power
For God's sake, they have no plan
Then give them one
Find a way
He puts a hand on Stauffenberg's arm
(') Evil happens when good men do nothing
Before Stauffenberg can answer, new music comes blasting from the phonograph
The unmistakable sound of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries
Children, that is far too- He is cut off by the appearance of his four children, all wearing cloaks made of bed sheets, pots for helmets and brandishing makeshift swords
They charge into the room, singing loudly and attacking their father
He does his best to defend himself with one hand
Their commotion causes the phonograph to skip
And you'd think that's where it ends
We even pull back, creating that effect
It takes a moment to notice the wailing sound we're suddenly hearing is not on the phonograph
Nina hears it first, then Stauffenberg and Berthold
Finally the children freeze and the phonograph skips without their help
The glasses on the table rattle
Now we hear the wailing quite clearly
siren
(') Air-raid
The adults herd the children out of the room
Muffled concussions cause the phonograph to skip frequently, turning Wagner's masterpiece into a stutter
28
-  -                28 The family rushes down the stairs, huddling in a corner - adults holding shivering children
The bombs are closer, louder
The Wagner, the siren, the explosions fray the nerves
25
Stauffenberg reaches for Nina in the darkness, finding her belly
Her hand clamps around his - around their unborn child
So close the children scream
Dust and debris fall from the ceiling
The needle rakes the phonograph upstairs going back to the beginning
- on his eye
His thoughts as the bombs fall all around his home - a moment of profound realization
29
-   -             29 Move across the room to the phonograph, looking down at the 78 spinning on the turntable
The camera begins to turn until all the world around us is spinning and only the record is still
We read one word of the title of the 78 quite clearly: (
) Valkyrie
30
-                                  30 Stauffenberg faces the top members of the Resistance
We've already considered Valkyrie
It isn't suitable
Not as it's currently written
Excuse me
What is Valkyrie
Operation Valkyrie
Tresckow explains even as he studies Stauffenberg, curious
What does he have in mind
(') The Reserve Army has thousands of men all over the city - most of them not even in uniform
Valkyrie is top secret plan to mobilize those men in a national emergency
26
Hitler designed it himself to crush any internal unrest if he's cut off or killed
And what use is that to us
The orders could be rewritten few subtle changes would put those reserve units completely under our command
Yes, of course, but- Now what would the High Command do if they thought, say, the  was staging a coup
They would declare a military state of emergency
And initiate Operation Valkyrie
Hitler's   own Reserve Army, using Hitler's   own plan and under our command,   would automatically seize power in   Berlin
(catching on) While we put a new government in place
Precisely
It will seem as though we're fighting for Hitler Government, not against it
But only if Hitler's dead
All eyes turn to Goerdeler
Here we go
(') That is what you're saying, isn't it
The central solution
27
(') How else will you make people believe the  is trying to seize power
'm afraid it's the only way
'm disappointed in you, Colonel thought a man of your background would appreciate a more- 'm a soldier first, an aristocrat second
Yes, but- And you're neither, Doctor
Now if you want to be Chancellor, you'll do as you're told
moment of tension
Humiliated, Goerdeler nods
But he won't ever forget this
(to Tresckow) Can this plan be made to work
Rewriting the order is one thing - distributing it is another
bomb can be disarmed, recovered if it fails
In this case we'd be willfully circulating written evidence of high treason
(thinks) It's the best idea we've heard yet
There is one
small problem
(realizing) Fromm
Who is Fromm
28
Commander of the Home Army
Olbricht can put the reserve troops on alert, but only Fromm can actually initiate Valkyrie
Can we get to him
He's a careerist pig
But one who's gone as high as he can go in Hitler's Army
It's no secret he's not happy about it
Perhaps if we offered him a key position in the new regime he could be made to see the light
We don't seem to have a choice
Without Fromm there is no Valkyrie
(to Olbricht and Stauffenberg) Get him
We end on Goerdeler, a look of concern on his face
31
-   -                     31 :    - from
Someone is getting reamed
Fromm's adjutant,    - a young, dedicated soldier - sits at his desk, trying to ignore the screaming from the other room in between stolen glances at
: Stauffenberg and Olbricht waiting patiently, sitting across from: , a dutiful Nazi whose face we immediately don't like
He smiles coldly, taking pleasure in the shouting
He stares at Stauffenberg, studying him, making us nervous
Fromm's door finally opens and storms out
29
:     - ' Freyend stands, holding Keitel's hat and coat for him
perfect toady
You're a woman, Fromm
And a fat one at that
'd have you sent to the front if  didn't think you'd surrender just to be Montgomery's whore
Keitel storms out, leaving a pall
Freyend gives Stauffenberg a last once-over and follows
Beat: The
General will see you now
32
- '  -            32 Stauffenberg and Olbricht step inside to find: :    - The haggard Fromm sits at his desk, rubbing his temples
Stauffenberg and Olbricht share a confident look
Surely this guy hates the High Command
Without looking up to see them: What is it you want
Olbricht hesitates
Fromm looks up
(') Well, Olbricht
Speak up
wanted to introduce you to our new man - Colonel Stauffenberg
Ah yes - the hero from Africa
'd offer my hand but you might not give it back
'd say the General's lost more important things this morning
30
Freeze
But after a tense beat, Fromm relaxes and laughs, taking a cigarette from a box on his desk and nudging it toward them
About time they put a man with balls in this office
Have a seat
(to Olbricht) You too, if you must
They sit
Fromm lights a cigarette, leans back and exhales a cloud of smoke
We let things sit for awhile
The game of recruitment is about to begin and no one is sure where to start
The longer the quiet, the more awkward things seem
Finally: (') They tell me you're critical of the war, Colonel
Not that you don't seem to have good reason
am critical of losing the war, General
All wars - as in Africa - are lost through indecision
In the field, you mean
He's baiting Stauffenberg to talk shit about Hitler
In Berlin
take it that's why you're here
To make decisions
've made my decision, General
`m here to help others make theirs
Stauffenberg makes no attempt to shade his delivery
He is quite clearly indicating that he means more
Fromm knows it, but he's being coy
They say when there's no clear option, one should do nothing
We're at war
We must act
Sometimes
rashly
31
Just what sort of rash action did you have in mind, Colonel
That would be a decision for the Supreme Military Commander
Fromm is getting the message
He takes a deep drag
Supreme Commander, you say
Second only to the Chancellor
If only  were that man
This war would be going quite differently
We were thinking the very same thing
Fromm frowns at Olbricht
This was a bit too obvious
Stauffenberg shoots Olbricht a look
"What the hell are you doing
" Fromm casually stamps out his cigarette in the ashtray and picks up the telephone
Olbricht and Stauffenberg steel their nerves - certain they are going to be reported
But Fromm doesn't dial
Instead, to our relief, he disconnects the line
When he is certain that it is dead: don't need to remind you that we've all sworn an oath
That said, 'm going to forget we had this conversation with the understanding that such speak will never occur under this roof again
Am  clear
/ Yes, sir
Tell   your friends that  always come   down on the right side
And as long   as the Fuhrer is alive, you know   what side that is
32
(') (raising his hand) Heil Hitler
33
- -                   33 (trying to be upbeat) think that went rather well
Yes
Quite
34
-                               34 car loaded with luggage
Stauffenberg hugs his children, one by one, before placing them inside
Then he turns to face Nina
As always, there is much to be said that they cannot say
She gently touches the silver chain around his neck, the ring and the cross she gave him
They embrace tightly and kiss
She gets in the car, looking at him through the back window as she is driven away
35
-                                        35 Darkness
As our eyes adjust we realize we are in the middle of the woods
Is this a dream
nightmare
We are drawn toward a flickering light in the distance
36
-  -                             36 From out of the darkness comes a candle held by a nervous, almost mousy young woman,
Walking just behind her is Tresckow
He carries a small but heavy case in one hand
They come to a clearing in the woods and find a strange sight
In the center is a tree stump surrounded by papers, including the original orders for  , next to a leather valise marked with the seal of the Reich
The orders have been meticulously annotated
(
) Were you followed
33
Fraulein Oven gasps
Tresckow turns, pistol drawn
The tip of his barrel comes up just inches from Stauffenberg's eyepatch
Stauffenberg smiles, emerging from the shadows
Dammit, Stauffenberg
You scared me half to death
We'll be closer than that before we're finished
37
-                                        37 Wearing white gloves, Fraulein Oven opens the case Tresckow brought, revealing a portable typewriter
She carefully feeds a sheet of crisp parchment into the machine and sets the margins carefully
Pause
Then she starts typing with remarkable speed
(Note: The sound of typing runs throughout the scene, punctuated by the crack of the carriage return - each time a little louder
) Stauffenberg and Tresckow carefully pore over the Valkyrie orders, scribbling copious notes
Looking this over, 'm not satisfied that the Reserve Army is enough to shut down Berlin completely
(handing over papers) Yes, 've been giving that some thought
We should include any field units that are home on leave
Before Tresckow can respond, more papers: (') 've also drawn up an outline for orders to streamline combat groups in order to quietly concentrate forces at vital points - state and government buildings, of course, but also the radio and newspapers
More papers
Tresckow can barely keep up
34
(') Combat groups will be reorganized as reinforced grenadier regiments
One or two of them can be quickly mobilized, eliminating the usual six hour lag
We blitz the government quarter, arrest all Ministers and Party leaders, surround all  and police barracks
Any officers who resist will be arrested
or shot
carriage return as loud as a rifle-shot
38
-  -                               38 truck full of soldiers roars past
Stauffenberg, Tresckow and Fraulein Oven walk across a dimly lit bridge on a foggy night in Berlin, stopping in the middle
Stauffenberg carries a leather valise with the Valkyrie orders, Tresckow carries the typewriter case
They stop at the center of the bridge, looking around carefully
No one is in sight, but anyone could be watching from the shadows
Eerie
(to the Fraulein) If anyone comes to you, play ignorant
Just tell them- 'll tell that  was serving the German people
Then 'll tell them to go to hell
Both men smile, a bit taken aback
Von Oven shakes each man's hand and walks away, swallowed up by the darkness
When she is gone: To Operation Valkyrie
Stauffenberg nods
Tresckow heaves the typewriter case over the railing and into the water below
They watch in silence as the water settles, then: 35
(') 've been transferred to the front
(shocked) Why didn't you tell me
Would you have stayed
Obviously not
Then it occurs to Stauffenberg
Do you think Fromm reported us
It's more likely just
an unfortunate coincidence
Anyway it doesn't matter
You wrote the orders
You know them better than anyone
You don't mean to say- 'm appointing you military leader of the Resistance
Beck agrees
But Olbricht- We both know Olbricht hasn't the wit or the spine
No
It's you
million thoughts are running through Stauffenberg's mind
Fear
Anxiety
But he knows what he must do
(') One more thing
You were right what you said that first night
It's not enough to kill Hitler
We need to isolate his chain of command
The slightest confusion could crush us
We need to be certain that no conflicting orders get out after the flash
Stauffenberg considers this for a moment
36
That greatly limits our options of where and when to make our move, but it's the only way
How will you do it
Perhaps it's better  don't say
Pause
sad smile and nod from Tresckow, a moment ago he was in charge
Now he has no clearance
God promised Abraham that he would not destroy Sodom if he could find just ten righteous men
He puts a hand on Stauffenberg's shoulder
(') have a feeling that for Germany it may come down to one
39
'  -  -                     39 wild party - a small band, German officers, plenty of women
In stark contrast, two   sip coffee at a corner table, keeping a watchful eye on the crowd
carries a tray of drinks to a rowdy group in the corner who are immersed in the denial common to Berlin these days
The Waiter serves carefully, making sure one particular drink goes to: :    - The group toasts and downs their booze
: Fellgiebel's smile suddenly fades
He looks into his glass, his good mood vanishing
He politely excuses himself over the noise of the rowdy mob and heads for the bathroom
He looks ill
37
40
-                                      40 Fellgiebel walks to the sink and dumps what is left of his drink in the basin
: Mingling among the melting chunks of ice is a   staring back at him
He scowls in the mirror at Stauffenberg, waiting
You realize how close  am to Hitler
With one word  could have the Gestapo make you disappear
Why haven't you then
Fellgiebel checks the stalls to make sure they are empty
Stauffenberg collects his glass eye from the sink, dabbing it dry on a hand towel
(') None of my associates know we've been talking if that's what you're afraid of
But you know
And when the  catch you, they'll pull you apart like warm bread
It'll be a crime just to have known you then
warn you
If it means protecting myself, will expose you
Do not try to contact me again
Fellgiebel heads for the door but stops on: You can't report me
Maybe if you had when  first approached you, you'd have been keeping your oath
But now you're just as guilty as- So you think that makes me a sympathizer, eh
You give a man the choice of betraying a fellow officer or his Fuhrer and assume his actions will show you his heart
It's not that simple
38
It is to me
For the last time, don't push me to make a decision
have no choice
It's clear now that without you we have no hope of success
Pause
Fellgiebel's silence speaks volumes
(') You want us to succeed
Don't you
And what if you do, eh
What then
Will you be any different from Hitler
What of his Reich, his people, the very momentum of history
Will all of that let you be something he isn't
No
There it is
But my pregnant wife, our four children, the Germany  first swore to defend
They demand that  be something different
They demand that  fight for their future even if it means
And for a moment his voice breaks and he chokes back what may be tears
(') Even if it means that  never see them again
In that moment we see a side of Stauffenberg we were starting to doubt existed
We see his humanity
This puts Fellgiebel in his place
He adjusts his tie and we see the wedding ring on his finger
39
(') Action is inevitable
As are the consequences
When they come for me 'll do what  can to hide what you knew and when you knew it
(stepping closer now) But don't delude yourself
You were involved in a crime against your country long before you met me
There's still time to redeem yourself
Only God can judge you now
The door bursts open, startling them both
But it is only a   and a looking for some privacy
Are you two finished or just getting started
The woman laughs
Stauffenberg walks out past them, leaving Fellgiebel with Hitler's finest
41
- '  -            41 What first catches our eye is the enormous portrait of Hitler looming over Stauffenberg's desk
Stauffenberg sits before a mountain of paperwork, surrounded on all sides by a flurry of and
He looks up to find: Olbricht hovering in the doorway with that look that says, "We need to talk
" Stauffenberg clearly doesn't have the time
He sighs
Leave us, please
The staff instantly exits - a well-oiled machine
Stauffenberg unplugs the phone
You play the part of bureaucrat beautifully
It's the only time  can relax
40
There's a man here to interview as your adjutant
Adjut- What for
No one told you
(obviously not) You've been promoted Chief of Staff for the Reserve Army
Some men might find a promotion to be good news
Not Stauffenberg
For Christ's sake
Don't  have enough to do
Unfortunately, your nocturnal activities don't count as service to the Reich
'll refuse the promotion
You'll do no such thing
Dammit,  can't handle the work already- This is an opportunity we could never have dreamed of
You're in the inner circle now - with genuine access to Hitler, his advisors, his schedule
We need this
We're not ready
We're moving too fast
Not half as fast as the Allies
An invasion is coming, Colonel
Any day now
We must act and we must act soon
41
(') Tresckow may have left you in charge of the "central solution," but in this world  still outrank you
You will accept the appointment
Is that understood
Stauffenberg nods, grudgingly
(') Now
The new man is waiting outside
He comes highly recommended
He might even be an ideal candidate
For what
(smiling) We still need an assassin
Olbricht leaves
Stauffenberg lets this sink in
He takes a seat and goes back to work
After a moment: (36) quietly enters
:     -
Haeften clicks his heels and offers the Nazi salute, but before he can say the words: Be seated
Thrown, Haeften sits
Stauffenberg continues writing, ignoring him
Haeften looks up at the portrait of Hitler, startled when Stauffenberg finally speaks: (') Do you know how this war will end, Haeften
The portrait will be un- hung
And the man will be hung
Stauffenberg looks up - looking for a reaction to such frank and treasonous talk
He gets none
He sighs, too tired to play games
(') Bottom line
'm engaged in high treason with all means available to me
Can  count you in
42
And the strangest thing - a reaction no one would suspect - Haeften relaxes, almost sighs, like someone who has at long last found a home
For anything, sir
Anything at all
Anything is a very dangerous word
42

Allied forces invade Normandy
The liberation of Europe has begun
But this is not the -Day you learned about in history class
This is a German newsreel
Nazi spin
In it, Hitler's forces have nothing to fear
(
) (subtitles) The Allied Forces have blundered into the trap awaiting them on the beaches of Normandy - heroically repelled by the combined might of the German Army
It is a glorious day for the Reich
At long last the craven enemy has come to Europe to face their inevitable defeat at the hands of- 43
-                              43 Five thousand ships, one-hundred thousand men from the combined Allied forces
Haeften and Stauffenberg ride in a sedan
Stauffenberg is in profile the entire time
What about the Panzer divisions in- They were never dispatched
Word is Hitler took a sleeping pill
His staff was afraid to wake him
43
First Africa, now France
The Russians bearing down from the East
Sometimes  wonder if Hitler's real aim is to leave nothing but scorched earth for all of Europe
Stauffenberg rubs his forehead
The car stops
are waiting outside
Stauffenberg gets out of the car wearing an ornate dress uniform and carrying a leather valise
He has arrived at a meeting of great importance
He turns to face Haeften directly and we are surprised to see both of his eyes - for an instant the young lion he once was
But a closer look is unsettling - we see the faint scarring, one eye glowing and alive, the other cloudy and dead
His glass eye
Stauffenberg only wore it on special occasions
This is one
Maybe this is a blessing in disguise
Maybe he'll finally listen to reason - consider a truce while he still can
We'll see if  can't convince him
44
-                                  44 Est
Hitler's forboding southern headquarters
:
7  1944
Stauffenberg walks up a flight of wide marble stairs - at the top he sees a group of quietly smoking cigarettes - a clique of devoted Nazis
In the group is Major Freyend, the wormy officer we saw outside Fromm's office
He watches Stauffenberg pass, aloof
We hate him
44
Just then Stauffenberg is greeted by who move to physically search him - one his body, the other his valise
(
) You don't need to search him
: Fromm's adjutant, Lt
Herber approaches, waving off the
Colonel Stauffenberg is an honored guest
The hero of Africa
The  officers stand down
Herber and Stauffenberg share a friendly smile, about to speak when Fromm walks up on them: For God's sake, Stauffenberg, you're- He pauses, clearly caught off guard when he sees Stauffenberg with two eyes
(') they're waiting for you
45
-   -                 45 Stauffenberg and Fromm enter to the last thing we would expect
Laughter
Drunken laughter
:
Hitler and five men - some of them almost caricatures, their features so distinct
The first man we recognize as Keitel - the general who reamed Fromm
The others we know from history and : -
- - - , '
45
We have arrived in the sanctum sanatorium of Nazi Germany on the day after the Normandy invasion
But you would never know the tide of the war had just turned against Germany
series of situation maps are scattered before them, ignored
Only Speer seems to be reserved, smiling politely but clearly tuned into the present reality
Looking closer at Goering we see he is wearing heavy make-up - adding to the already surreal nature of the scene
It is also the first time we are allowed a clear, unobstructed view of Hitler
Mein Fuhrer
wish to present Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg - our new Chief of General Staff for the Replacement Army
The laughter stops
Hitler and his cronies turn toward Stauffenberg, looking him over
Hitler stands and crosses to him
Fromm meets him first, whispering in the Fuhrer's ear - perhaps reminding him who Stauffenberg is
Hitler nods: "Ah yes
" He takes Stauffenberg's left hand with both of his
We are surprised by his charm
May  say,  am honored to meet a hero who has sacrificed so much for Germany
If only more of my officers were like you
Hitler's cronies smile despite the subtle insult to themselves
To make it worse, Hitler turns to them
(') Let this man stand as an example to all of you
He is the ideal German officer
Fromm nervously clears his throat
Mein Fuhrer, we have asked Stauffenberg here today so that he might brief us on mobilizing troops from the Home Army to support those in Normandy
46
Hmmm
Oh yes, Normandy
That will no longer be necessary
General Goering has assured me that Normandy is under control
Stauffenberg's good eye flickers
"Are you insane
Normandy is a catastrophe
" Another glance at the situation map shows Allied forces over-running
But the painted-on smiles of Hitler's nodding cronies promote the lie
No one has the courage to tell Hitler anything close to the truth
Somewhere in their eyes is the fear that someone will
Mein Fuhrer, if  may
The situation in Normandy is- You're dismissed, Stauffenberg
But- Send your man home, Fromm
Then bring us some brandy
Fromm is stung - a man of his rank being treated like a waiter
Stauffenberg steps back, clicks his heels and salutes, just managing to say: Heil Hitler
Hitler half waves, walking slowly back to his seat
Fromm and Stauffenberg leave
46
-                                 46 Fromm escorts a visibly shaken Stauffenberg to his waiting vehicle
Haeften opens the car door for Stauffenberg to get in
Fromm leans in
don't know what you've got brewing and  don't want to know
But when the music stops, 'd be much obliged if Keitel should find himself without a chair
47
Is Fromm saying he's in
Is Keitel's death a condition
Hard to say and meant to be
Before Stauffenberg can inquire, Fromm slams the door shut and returns to the madness inside the Berghof
47
-                         47 Stauffenberg leans back in his seat, mentally calculating his next step
They're all insane
Every one of them except for Speer, and he's nothing but an architect
Stauffenberg puts on his eyepatch before removing his glass eye
He polishes it with a cloth and now it stares at him from his gloved hand
conscience
(') Tell Beck we've found our assassin
(off Haeften's confused look) 'll do it myself
48
-                                      48 We find ourselves in an empty church
Beck is seated in a pew staring straight ahead
Stauffenberg sits directly behind him
They can't risk being seen together
They speak in hushed tones
The first thing we notice is how weak and ill Beck looks
He struggles to hide a persistent cough
Out of the question
It won't work
We need you here in Berlin
Who else, then
Who can even get as close
Beck knows there is no other choice
(') Valkyrie is very clear
Once the order is given, the Reserve Army will automatically seize control of the government with or without me
48
Orders are not enough
They need a man to follow
The right man
Pause
Stauffenberg knows he's right
The fucking pressure
He thinks for a moment, then with a sigh: Olbricht will oversee operations in my absence
can be back in Berlin three hours after Hitler is- Stauffenberg shuts up, lowering his head in prayer as a  passes
Once they are again alone: Three very crucial hours
We both know there's no other way
Beck nods, resigned
'll tell the others- As if on cue, Beck loses control of his cough
Stauffenberg leans forward, handing him a handkerchief and putting a reassuring hand on his shoulder until the old man's hacking subsides
(') 'm afraid whatever the outcome, won't be there to see it
Nonsense
You're stronger than you think
You might just be the strongest one of all

The sound of children at play takes us to: 50
-   -            50 Once again, the scene idyllic
The Stauffenberg children play football in the distance
Stauffenberg himself is out of uniform for the first time since the hospital, but he does not seem relaxed
49
Nina sits across from him, half-reading a book, half talking to her husband
Stauffenberg cannot hear a word she is saying - he is miles away
He looks over at his children
One would never suspect that Germany has waged a calamitous war and that the country is facing total devastation
After that  thought 'd take the children to the country for a few days to see my- Claus
He snaps out of his thoughts
"Hmmm
" (') Have you heard a word  said
The country
(thinking) Nina
Listen
want you to delay your trip
Just for a while
She wants to ask, he wants to tell her
Finally: Does this have something to do with
your work
would just be more comfortable knowing where you are - until 'm back from Berlin
Things will be different then
promise
Long pause
Once again, a couple who know each other well enough to not have to say things plainly
Nina is worried but strong
How long until
until we see you
few days
If all goes well
Then we can travel as a family
And if things
don't go well
He hesitates
50
love you, Nina
And  love you
What- ,
(Etc
) The children kick the ball toward Stauffenberg - the one sport he can play
He is about to say something to Nina, but she cuts him off
Go be with your children
Stauffenberg stands, touching Nina's cheek and kissing her forehead
We stay on her as he joins the children
She watches them play together, seeing her husband laughing for the first time in a long while
Her eyes well with tears - a mixture of happiness and anguish
Too good to last, too much to bear
51
-                                      51 Haeften, Olbricht and Stauffenberg stand around a table giving their undivided attention to: :     - ' He empties the contents of two tawny leather briefcases onto the table: Along with a crude drawing covered with calculations he produces two brick-like lumps wrapped in butcher paper, two small caps and two thin metal cylinders
Two 975 gram packs of plastic-
Enough explosive to cripple a panzer
(pointing to caps) Your detonators
(pointing to cylinders) Your fuses
British time pencils
This acid capsule is your trigger
Stauffenberg carefully studies the items before him
51
(') When you're ready to arm, attach the detonator to the bottom of the time pencil, like so
(demonstrating) Insert the entire device into either end of the plastic-, crush the acid capsule and you're live
When the acid eats through the wire holding back the trigger spring
Well
You'll want to be very far away
What if they search your bag
'm one of the inner circle now
They'll make sure  am who  am
Beyond that, they won't touch me
(to Mertz) How much time do  have
Theoretically there's a 30-minute delay
But with the kind of heat you can expect at the Wolf's Lair, 'd give you 10, 15 minutes tops
That's
hardly precise
This is state of the art
You can have small or precise
Not both
Might this be just a little too small
The explosion won't do the killing
The air in the room will
He points to the drawing - an overhead sketch of: (') Hitler's bunker is constructed of reenforced concrete
steel door, no windows
Just one of these explosives in a space like that will cause tremendous air pressure
52
(') Enough to instantly kill everyone present
The second charge will be entirely redundant
Of course, 'm all for redundancy
However
If, by some miracle, Hitler does survive, what then
We have an inside man at the Wolf's Lair in communications
He'll notify you immediately following the flash and then sever all contact with the outside world
The others are stunned
Just how did you manage that
It's my job, isn't it
While Hitler's inner circle is still regrouping, you will initiate Valkyrie and seize control in Paris and Berlin
Even if Hitler survives, we'll have momentum
(to Olbricht) But as   you said yourself it would take a   miracle
Anyone in that bunker   when just one of these goes off is   not coming out alive
Haeften places the items back in the briefcases
Himmler is expected to be at the meeting as well
Don't proceed unless you can get them both
That could be difficult
Why kill a madman just to have a lunatic take his place
This is Goerdeler's idea, isn't it
53
The members are in total agreement on this
Stauffenberg chews on this, pissed
Then: Fucking politicians
'll hold off if the decision is unanimous
And want another man on the committee
soldier
soldier himself, Olbricht is insulted
And just who this soldier be
Stauffenberg glances at Mertz, sizing him, up
(pointing to Mertz) Him
Him
Mertz's eyes widen
"Me
" But Stauffenberg and Haeften pick up their briefcases and leave without another word
Assassins
Olbricht reaches for the phone and dials
(') This is General Olbricht
Order the Guard Battalion and all Army Schools near Berlin to take up march readiness
Stand by for Operation Valkyrie

The walls are lined with chattering teletype machines and their
: One teletype in particular
The words are clicking by quickly but we clearly make out: 54
One   leans in, reading it, curious
He tears the sheet out of the teletype and takes it to: The officious   - officer in charge
He likes his job and how well he does it
(handing over the order) Lieutenant
What about it
This order is calling the Reserve Army for some sort of stand-by action
in Berlin
(shrugs) Looks like a drill of some kind
Valkyrie
've never heard of that
Send the order through, Sergeant
and a   take us to

Stauffenberg and Haeften board a waiting courier plane, preparing for departure
Both are clutching their briefcases, faces like stone
Stauffenberg is dressed once again in his ornate, formal attire - his patch gone, glass eye in place
55
-  - wail
loom over a large pillared stronghold
From out of the surrounding barracks, scramble to march readiness, assembling on the center parade grounds, awaiting orders
Vehicles move into place along the perimeter
All in all, a well-oiled machine

wail
scramble into readiness
Vehicles move into place - a well-oiled machine
We focus on two officers in particular: , Commander of the Deutschland Guard Battalion, and
Loyal Nazis both
What do you suppose this is all about
Probably just a drill
But Remer doesn't seem convinced
Remember him

check identity papers and confiscate pistols from Haeften and The Driver
Stauffenberg boldly extends his valise to one of the Guards, but rather than reach for it, the young soldier snaps to attention and raises his hand in a Nazi salute, eyes straight ahead, stone-like
drone
After an awkward pause: (to the Driver) Drive on
'  -  - '
series of follow the bag through the extensive security layers one must endure before getting to the meeting
is checked frequently
The bags, not once
The men here are Hitler's inner circle, after all

'  -  -                        59 Finally, Stauffenberg and Haeften are escorted toward the bunker where the meeting will be held
Pausing, Stauffenberg looks back over his shoulder to find: - through the open door of the small shack we see a mass of radios and telegraphs stands outside, smoking a cigarette
(whispering to Haeften) Your man
Yes
And it is none other than , the man Stauffenberg confronted in the bathroom at the Officers' Club so long ago
He and Stauffenberg share a long, intense stare
Finally, Fellgiebel nods, dropping his cigarette and crushing it with his boot
He's in
Stauffenberg and Haeften head inside the impervious bunker through the heavy steel door
57
60
'  -  -   -            60 Stauffenberg and Haeften find themselves in a cramped, hot, windowless room filled with waiting around a large conference table
Silence
moment later, Hitler enters - Keitel and Fromm follow close behind
Heels click in unison
Keitel starts the meeting, but Stauffenberg isn't listening
While all eyes follow Hitler, Stauffenberg watches the door, scanning the faces in the room
(whispering) Himmler
Where is Himmler
Haeften doesn't see him either
Shit
Now for the first order of business
Fromm,  believe you will brief us on blocking divisions for the Eastern Front
Stauffenberg silently excuses himself from the room
We hold on his briefcase
Remember where he left it
61
- '  -                61 The phone rings
waiting Mertz grabs it
General Olbricht's Office
(suddenly nervous) Hold the line
(to Olbricht) Stauffenberg says Himmler's not at the briefing
He wants to proceed
All color drains from Olbricht's face
Call Beck
He leaves
Mertz rolls his eyes and dials a second phone
58
62
-                                      62 Beck and Goerdeler sit impatiently by the telephone, waiting for any word on the assassination and impending coup
When the telephone : Beck
He presses the receiver tightly to his ear, a look of concern washing over his face
He turns to Goerdeler
(') Himmler is not in the briefing
Goerdeler's reaction is vintage politician
Blank
63
'  -  -  -                  63 We watch as Stauffenberg smokes, waits, looks at his watch - the sounds of the meeting going on behind him
He drops his cigarette and we see a pile of three more
He has been waiting while the others deliberate
Finally: ( ) They say no
Wait
(Note: Intercut between Mertz and Stauffenberg
) Stauffenberg is furious
He calms himself
What do you say
Pause
Mertz looks around, makes sure he is alone
say do it
Stauffenberg hangs up the phone
The moment of truth
64
'  -  -   -            64 Stauffenberg quietly slips back into the briefing unnoticed
He freezes: : The spot where Stauffenberg left his briefcase
Remember
Well it's gone
59
He looks around frantically
Some officers notice him
Tension mounts
He gets Haeften's attention
(mouthing) My briefcase
Before Haeften can answer, Fromm shoots them both a glare
"What the hell are you doing
" Gentleman
You are dismissed
And like that, the briefing has ended
Stauffenberg is sickened - the opportunity lost
Hitler exits, walking right past him
Keitel and the rest file out
The last to leave is Fromm
That call better have been important
Stauffenberg turns, coming face-to-face with Freyend, Keitel's hateful toady
He holds the missing briefcase
For a moment we're sure the jig is up
Your bag
Colonel
He hands it over and leaves

Olbricht jumps from the car, racing to get General Hase's attention
of soldiers stand at attention in the hot sun, awaiting orders
(whispering) What the hell is going on
My men have been standing here for an hour
don't know what to tell them
(the officer we told you to remember) standing before the ranks
He eyes Hase and Olbricht suspiciously, trying to hear what they are saying
After a moment, Hase addresses the men
60
(') At ease, gentlemen
Olbricht addresses the men, trying unsuccessfully to hide his nerves
This has been a drill
You're all to be commended for your quick response
Dismissed
Pause
The men linger, confused until: (') And the men fall out, nowhere to go so they just light up and shoot the shit
Hagen approaches Remer
What did  tell you
drill
But Remer is not so sure
The way he stares at Olbricht makes us nervous
: Olbricht sees Remer looking at him, making note of the esteemed '  pinned to Remer's uniform
Olbricht leans toward Hase
That man there
Who is he
Major Remer
He commands the Deutschland Guard Battalion
What about him
Get rid of him
Remer
Don't worry about him
He's an order taker
To the bone
Ah yes
But whose orders
61
66
-  '  -            66 As usual, Lt
Herber sits at his desk and, as usual, he tries to ignore: through Fromm's office door Stauffenberg and Olbricht waiting
They sit across from, Freyend
beat later, Keitel storms out of Fromm's office, his face red with anger
Deja vu
When Keitel and Freyend are gone: Herber looks up from his desk with a nervous smile
The General will see you now
Stauffenberg and Olbricht stand, hats in hand
67
- '  -           67 How dare you put the Reserve Army on standby without my knowledge
You damn near cost me my commission
What in God's name made you think you even had the authority
It was only a drill
An exercise
' ,
Not to me
We both know it was no fucking drill
General, if  may- You may not, Colonel
You may not do anything
Because now you've not only shown me you can't deliver, you've painted a target on my back
If  so much as sense you trying to move the Reserve Army again, 'll personally have you both arrested
Do  make myself abundantly clear
/ Yes, sir
62
Heil Hitler
Heil Hitler
But Stauffenberg turns to leave without answering
'll hear you say it, Colonel
Stauffenberg stops, glaring at Fromm with his one eye
He squares his shoulders, clicks his heels loudly and delivers a downright Nazi-like: Still managing to make it sound spiteful
He leaves without being dismissed, slamming the door
68
-                                    68 It has been a long day, the Resistance leaders are all exhausted
Beck, Olbricht, Witzleben, Haeften and Mertz watch Goerdeler circling a rigid Stauffenberg
The point of your central solution is to replace Hitler so that we can negotiate a truce with the Allies
The Allies,  suspect, would be more amenable to a truce Today was a matter of indecision - nothing more
military operation in the hands of a politician
Stauffenberg's lack of respect infuriates Goerdeler
don't think  am alone when  say your judgement is in question
(to the others) would like to take a vote
Carl
63
Carl, if  may have a word with you in private
If you have something to say, Ludwig, say it here
Say it now
Very well
There's no need to vote
Beck turns to the bar, pours two drinks
Stauffenberg stiffens, ready for the axe
(') consider you a friend
And  look forward to the day when we can once again live as free men
But you've become a liability
Goerdeler smiles smugly
But the smile fades when Beck turns, offering a drink to him
(') 'm sorry it has to be this way
Wha
What are you saying
Fellgiebel informed me this evening
Himmler's issued an order for your arrest
You'll have to leave Germany
Tonight
When we've succeeded with the central solution you'll return as Chancellor
Until then- Goerdeler stands, confronting Stauffenberg
This is your doing, isn't it
' You can't just get rid of me like this
am the man Germany will follow
'm
Stauffenberg says nothing
He's too cool
Goerdeler looks at the other conspirators, but no one is going to speak for him
Finally, almost in tears: 64
(') Ludwig, - Beck offers him an envelope
Disappear, Carl
Avoid contact with anyone
Ugly pause
Goerdeler snatches the envelope and sulks out
We could not be happier to see him go
Beck coughs, turns to Stauffenberg
(') No more indecision
From now on, Stauffenberg has discretion
can't issue Valkyrie again unless we follow through
If he fails to- 'll do my job
You just take Berlin
'   - :  telephone
Stauffenberg's three fingered hand picks up the receiver and lifts it out of frame
(
) 'd like to place a call to Bamberg, please
-  - Nina and her children eat supper around a single candle, Bamberg is experiencing a blackout
Though Nina manages a tranquil facade she is anything but
: The silent telephone in the foreground
We wait for it to ring, but it never does
- Beck enters to find Stauffenberg in the front pew, staring at Christ on the cross
65
Have you made your peace with God, then
As best  can
Then you have nothing to fear
Stauffenberg manages a smile as Beck sits
know the soldier inside me is a traitor
wonder how 'll be judged as a man
By history
By God
In the end, we answer only to ourselves
Stauffenberg fingers the cross and ring hanging from the chain around his neck
(') Did you reach your wife
Bombing in Ebingen
can't get through
Ebingen is a long way from Bamberg
They're safe
You've seen to that
(realizing
) To think
You came to us a wounded soldier from Africa
Now
Now you are both the architect and the assassin
'm still trying to understand how this came to be
(more to himself) Like a farmer watching the corn grow
One day it's over his head
66
What's that
Nothing
And the two men look up at the cross in silence
71
-                          71 In these waking hours Berlin appears quite peaceful
Only the distant sound of shelling reminds us that the city is surrounded by war
72
-  -              72 tawny leather briefcase sits on a neatly made bed
Stauffenberg, freshly bathed and wrapped in a towel, shaves in front of the mirror
For the first time we see his scars and deformities in full
He looks himself over, finally focusing on the chain around his neck, contemplating the small cross and the ring - its engraving: finis-initium [end-beginning]
Though his face is clean-shaven now, he continues, slowly running the razor down his throat
Then he stops, pressing the blade a little too hard and bringing blood
It almost seems intentional
: The box that holds his glass eye, staring
73
-  -                   73 Stauffenberg has since mastered the process of dressing himself
take us from a wounded soldier to an officer of the General Staff
: His crisp white collar, picking up a trace of blood from the cut on his throat
74
-                               74 : 20  1944

Haeften holds the door for Stauffenberg, stepping into a military sedan
67
75
-  -                                75 For the first time we see Berlin in broad daylight - the city in ruins
The drive through the rubbled, smoky streets is particularly eerie today
78
-  -                            78 : 7:00
Haeften and Stauffenberg board a three-engine courier plane - each carrying a leather briefcase
moment later the plane is taking off
79
-                                      79 group of 30   talk quietly, smoking cigarettes and waiting anxiously
Many of the faces we recognize, some we see for the first time
We notice Witzleben has donned his old military uniform, looking a little too proud
Beck looks over the faces of these men, trying to contain his own fear
His eye catches the door opening and a entering the room
We tense
One by one, the men in the room stop talking, staring at the police officer
Just as we think it's over: Gentlemen, may  introduce Chief Helldorf
He's guaranteed the full support of the Berlin Police
Helldorf nods
The men breathe a collective sigh of relief
Some laugh
Many shake Helldorf's hand
(') We can begin
Beck moves to a table covered with maps of Berlin, Paris and the Wolf's Lair
(') Hitler has scheduled a military briefing for today at one o'clock
Stauffenberg will strike regardless of who else is present
68
As Beck speaks, we see how things should play out
80
'  -                                     80 Stauffenberg and Haeften are driven in a topless sedan
Each carries his leather briefcase
(
) Once in position, he will signal us once to alert the troops and again after the flash
81
'  -  -                            81 Stauffenberg and Haeften quickly get in the sedan - the concrete bunker just behind him - its steel door closed
They speed out of frame a beat before a muffled explosion rocks the bunker - the steel door bulges but holds fast
Only a wisp of smoke escapes
82
- '  -                    82 burst into Fromm's office and arrest the bewildered General without incident
(
) Assuming Fromm refuses to join us, Olbricht will take Command of the Reserve Army and initiate Operation Valkyrie
Olbricht takes Fromm's place and starts making calls
At least this is how it should happen
83
/
-  -                           83 Establishing shots of the idle troops and equipment as they are once again called into action
(
) Then he'll notify all district commanders between Paris and Berlin that the  is attempting to seize power
The Reserve Army will arrest all , Gestapo and Nazi officials
The same soldiers are now storming government buildings and seizing personnel
69
84
-                                    84 Witzleben and Beck march in with
(
) When the time is right, Witzleben and  will arrive at the War Ministry and assume the roles of Commander of the Armed Forces and Head of State, respectively
85
-                                   85 Goerdeler stands at a radio microphone, reading passionately from a prepared script with dramatic gestures painfully reminiscent of Hitler
(
) With Berlin secured, Goerdeler will return and address the nation as our new Chancellor
Then, God willing, we can negotiate a truce with the Allies and spare Europe from total destruction
86
-                                      86 Gentlemen, this is the most important day of your lives
Long live sacred Germany
The conspirators salute and leave
Beck places both hands on the table to support himself, coughing and exhausted
Then he looks nervously at his watch
87
- '  -                87 Olbricht paces before his desk
Mertz watches him, anxiously waiting for: Put the Reserve Army on standby alert
Not until  hear from Stauffenberg
Not until 'm sure
70
But that's not what he- Noted, Colonel
Thank you
88
-  -                           88 The plane touches down and taxis to a stop
Stauffenberg and Haeften deplane and immediately step into a waiting courier car driven by a young, dutiful Nazi
Remember him
89
'  -                                     89 Even this early, the heat is oppressive
We watch from a distance as the courier car is stopped at the outer checkpoint
Once again, the carefully examines Stauffenberg and Haeften's identification and takes their pistols before allowing the car to pass
We follow
90
'  - '  -                   90 Est
Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel's office as the courier car arrives
Stauffenberg and Haeften are greeted by Freyend who shows them to: 91
'  -   -           91 are already waiting
They stand
Gentlemen, may  present Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg - Chief Officer of the Reserve Army
#1 Colonel Stauffenberg
This is an honor
They say you're the man that will defend Berlin from the Red Army single-hand- The officer realizes what a faux pas he has made as soon as he says it
Unfazed, Stauffenberg smiles, raising his briefcase with his single hand
71
Indeed
've got the whole bag of tricks right here
The officers laugh nervously, relieved he was not insulted
Idiots
Meanwhile, Freyend steps toward Haeften, reaching for the handle of his briefcase
Let me take that for you
But Haeften snaps the case back
Freyend raises a suspicious eye
Before he can press: (
) Colonel Stauffenberg
Everyone turns to find General Fellgiebel standing at the door
Everyone stands at attention
At east, Gentlemen
(to Stauffenberg) General Fellgiebel, communications
just wanted to meet the hero of Africa
And see if there's anything you need
Yes, sir, there is
'm expecting a call of the utmost importance
Even if it comes when  am in conference with the Fuhrer 'd appreciate it if you had a man come and get me
Beat
Fellgiebel and Stauffenberg share an instant look of understanding
Of course, Colonel
Fellgiebel salutes
Stauffenberg and the others return it as Fellgiebel departs
Just then, Keitel bursts from his office, fixing his tie
Gentlemen
The meeting has been pushed forward to 12:30
Mussolini is arriving on the afternoon train and Hitler wants to have lunch with him
Stauffenberg is excited by a potential bonus
72
Will Mussolini be in the briefing
only wish he were
Then some ambitious officer might take the opportunity to shoot the dago bastard
Keitel makes a beeline for the door and the others follow like good sheep
Stauffenberg holds back, however, attracting Freyend's attention
'll need a place to wash up - change my shirt
Stauffenberg points to the shaving cut on his throat and the tiny blood stain on his shirt
The cut was intentional after all
Annoyed, Freyend motions to the adjoining anteroom
Please, do be quick
You heard the General
Stauffenberg nods in appreciation
He motions for Haeften to follow him
Freyend watches, curious
92
'  -   -                 92 Fast on Stauffenberg's heels, Haeften closes the door
large portrait of Hitler looms, watching
Stauffenberg positions himself at a small desk with his back to the door
He removes a brick of plastic explosive from his briefcase
(whispering) You're arming them
now
Stauffenberg quickly unbuttons his shirt, taking a clean one out of his bag and putting it on as: Haeften assembles a fuse
No room for error this time
Assume have ten minutes in this heat
73
(') Two minutes for the walk, one for the security check and one to the bunker
Three minutes for the walk back
That's seven
Leaving just three minutes to place the bomb
Plenty of time
If the bomb goes off in ten
He carefully inserts the fuse into the explosive
The     startles us
93
'  -   -                  93 Freyend answers
Major Freyend speaking
(beat) Stauffenberg
Yes, he's arrived
They are on their way now
Freyend hangs up, glancing impatiently at his watch
94
'  -   -                 94 Neatly dressed again, Stauffenberg carefully places the primed explosive back in his briefcase
He and Haeften turn their attention to the second explosive - assembling the fuse, about to insert it when: The door swings suddenly open - stopped short by Stauffenberg's backside
He nearly drops the fuse
Dammit man, what is it
It's Freyend, of course, trying to peer through the partially opened door
Stauffenberg hides the bombs with his body
General Keitel insists that the Colonel please hurry
74
Haeften scoops the unarmed explosive into his briefcase
Stauffenberg motions for Haeften to leave
95
'  -  -                       95 Haeften comes out, moving Freyend back with his body and shutting the door behind him - a charged moment
The Colonel is changing, Major
You understand this can be difficult
Freyend backs down
little
96
'  -   -                 96 Stauffenberg produces a pair of pliers (one handle specially bent for easier use by a man with only three fingers)
With some effort, he manages to secure the pliers around the fuse
The jaws of the pliers gently squeeze, crushing it
The bomb is live
There is no turning back now
Stauffenberg closes his briefcase and opens the door, greeted by Freyend and Haeften
97
'  -  '  -           97 Freyend scurries, trying to catch up with Keitel
Stauffenberg and Haeften lag behind
(to Haeften) See that the car is ready
Haeften looks down at the briefcase in his hand - the second, unarmed explosive inside
But sir- have everything  need, Lieutenant
Thank you
Haeften reluctantly takes his leave just as Freyend turns back, eager for Stauffenberg to pick up the pace
He reaches for the briefcase
75
Please
Let me help you with that
(pulling it away) can manage, thank you
Freyend seems more than just a little peeved
But Stauffenberg doesn't notice
He is focused straight ahead, mentally calculating what time he has left
The bunker suddenly seems miles away
98
'  -   -                    98 Security Perimeter
Keitel and his men file through the heavily guarded entrance
Each man holds up his pass for the  to inspect
Stauffenberg is last
Keitel heads toward a wooden structure up ahead - Stauffenberg is confused
Where are they going
It's too hot
The briefing has been moved to the conference hut
: The conference hut
The door and many windows of the flimsy wooden structure are all open
Not ideal for generating the deadly air pressure vital to Stauffenberg's plan
But this obstacle only seems to strengthen his resolve
He is a soldier after all
And no military operation goes according to plan
Making matters worse: (') Sir, your briefcase
insist
Annoyed but not wanting to arouse suspicion, Stauffenberg finally acquiesces, handing it over
He watches Freyend carry the bomb into the hut
Pause
Stauffenberg looks back over his shoulder to: Fellgiebel - standing by the communications building
The man who will get Stauffenberg out of the room before the bomb goes off
They share a nod
Then Stauffenberg steps into the hut
76
99
-  -                99 In the room beyond we see Hitler at the end of a long table surrounded by
One by one, they present their individual briefings to the nodding Fuhrer
Stauffenberg whispers to Freyend
My injuries left me a bit hard of hearing
See that you place me as near the Fuhrer as possible
Freyend nods, but for now his concerns are elsewhere - wrangling everyone into the meeting
Like the other officers, Stauffenberg hangs up his belt and hat on hooks at the entrance to the briefing room
He catches sight of - , the conference hut's young telephone operator
(') Sergeant
'm expecting an urgent call from Berlin
100
-   -                 100 small room measuring 15 by 32 feet
Stifling heat
We notice again that the windows are open to let in some air
Hitler and his officers hunch over a long, heavy table covered in detailed maps of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union
and  continually tiptoe in and out of the room
stands beside Hitler in the middle of his briefing: The Eastern Front forces are assured a victory
but they need reinforcements
In other words, they are getting pounded but he can't say that
The General is relived to be interrupted by Keitel's arrival
The briefing stops momentary as: Please pardon our tardiness
You remember Colonel Stauffenberg
77
Hitler makes a deliberate effort to shake Stauffenberg's hand, their eyes lock - an unnerving moment
Stauffenberg has come to kill this man greeting him
The moment is broken when the General clears his throat, continuing his presentation
As you can see, Mein Fuhrer, the situation in the East Prussian sector is increasingly critical
(and on and on
) Freyend startles Stauffenberg slightly when he takes him by the arm, moving him to his place at the table - less than half a step from Hitler
He is squeezed in between two other officers
We suck in wind when we see who one of them is
- the same Brandt who carried the bottles of Cointreau onto Hitler's plane so long ago
He still scribbles in his damn datebook
Freyend sets the briefcase beside Stauffenberg - bumping Brandt's leg
Brandt looks down at the briefcase - long enough to make us nervous
He watches as Stauffenberg nonchalantly bends down, sliding the briefcase as close to Hitler as possible, leaning it against the heavy wooden table support immediately to the right of Hitler's foot
Stauffenberg looks back at the open door, glances at his watch
He can clearly see Sergeant Adam, the telephone operator
Where is his God-damn phone call
Around him generals talk, Hitler nods, but we hear nothing
Only the pulse of Stauffenberg's heartbeat in his own ears - the only thing betraying his otherwise outward calm
He looks down at the briefcase - the bomb just under his feet
He looks at Hitler nodding
The longer we stay, the more excruciating it is
So we milk it
Stauffenberg is startled when a hand touches his arm
The annoying Freyend is there, whispering in his ear
Keitel sees this, irritated by the interruption
Stauffenberg makes a gesture to Keitel with his hand, indicating a phone call
Keitel is not pleased
78
101
-  -                        101 Freyend leads Stauffenberg to Adam who offers the telephone receiver
General Fellgiebel, sir
He says it's urgent
Stauffenberg takes the phone and stares at Freyend and Adam - they get the idea that this is a private call and leave
When they are gone, Stauffenberg simply lays the receiver down and walks out
Fast
moment later, Adam returns to the room
He sees the receiver laying there
Odd
Looking down the hallway he sees Stauffenberg quickly exiting the building
Then he notices Stauffenberg's hat and belt still hanging outside the briefing room
(') Colonel
Colonel, you forgot your- 102
-   -                  102 Hitler leans on his elbows carefully studying the map before him as the General's presentation drags on
Brandt moves in closer, filling the void left by Stauffenberg
His foot hits something
He looks at: Stauffenberg's briefcase as it falls over
Slowly, Brandt reaches down, picking up the briefcase, looking around for Stauffenberg
He considers the bag for a moment and we are sure he is going to open it
But then he puts it back under the table
But now the heavy wooden support is  Hitler and the bomb
And now  believe Colonel Stauffenberg will present us with his deployment for the Replacement Army should the unthinkable occur and the Russians reach- Where is Stauffenberg
Keitel shoots Freyend a look
79
103
-  -                        103 Freyend steps into the hall
No sign of Stauffenberg
Sergeant Adam approaches, looking confused
Where the hell is Stauffenberg
But Adam shrugs, holding out Stauffenberg's hat
104
'  -   -           104 Fellgiebel and Haeften watch anxiously as Stauffenberg clears the security checkpoint and walks toward them, slow and deliberate - eerily calm
-   - Hitler at the far end of the room, bent over the conference table, leaning on his elbows
, -  lifts the table up, throwing Hitler back and simultaneously vaporizing the men standing on either side of him
'  -   - The hut explodes outward like a house of cards
Bodies are thrown clear
Everyone hits the deck except Stauffenberg
He just keeps walking
great cloud of smoke billows from the ruins
The sky is alive with a swirl of burnt paper scraps and ash
are running about
Shouting
Screaming
Absolute chaos
Even knowing it was coming, Haeften is stunned
Stauffenberg walks up to the communications building and takes him by the arm, turning to Fellgiebel
Contact General Olbricht in Berlin
Tell him Hitler is dead
Proceed with Operation Valkyrie
Then sever all communications
Fellgiebel nods and rushes to make the call
Stauffenberg leads Haeften to their waiting car - still driven by young Lt
Kretz
80
He too is stunned by the explosion - so much so that he does not think to get out and open the door for his passengers
Stauffenberg climbs in next to Kretz, pushing Haeften in the back
(') (to Kretz) Drive
(Kretz lingers) Kretz snaps out of it and jams the car in gear, speeding off down the forested trail
Stauffenberg and Haeften look back for a clear view of the total destruction
Bodies are carried out of the demolished hut - the grounds littered with the wounded
Surly there is no way the Fuhrer could have survived
105
-                            105 Fellgiebel holds a phone to his ear
( ) said Olbricht
General Olbricht at the War Ministry
The call is urgent
breathless   enters, pointing in mute shock to the ruin outside
What the hell just happened
What does it look like
The Fuhrer is- Fellgiebel freezes, something catching his eye
Share his horror
Through the window, Fellgiebel has a clear view of the conference hut, or rather what's left
- limping, dazed, his clothes in tatters - is being led from the smoldering ruins
He is very much: (') Alive
81
106
'  -    -          106 Kretz brings the car to a sudden stop at the first checkpoint
barricade is in place approaches
Stauffenberg and Haeften hold up passes
We have to get to the airfield at once
Orders form the Fuhrer
The guard signals his men to remove the barricade
107
-                      107 Fellgiebel waits to be connected to the War Ministry in Berlin
His Communications Officer awaits orders
This makes it hard for Fellgiebel to speak plainly
He plays up his distress for his audience
( ) am calling from The Wolf's Lair with urgent news for the General
Something terrible has happened
Then he turns his back, lowers his voice
(') (whispering) The Fuhrer is still alive
( ) 'm sorry
Please come again
But Fellgiebel's officer is watching him, trying to hear
Fellgiebel has no choice but to hang up
Sever all communications
Sir
'   , 108
- '  -                 108 Olbricht anxiously hovers over Mertz who shouts into the phone
82
didn't hear you
Come again
Fellgiebel
But it's no use
Mertz slowly hangs up the phone
Well, what did he say
couldn't be sure
It sounded as though he said
Hitler is still alive
Olbricht clinches his teeth and starts sweating
Get him back on the line
Sir
The bomb did go off
That much was clear
Fellgiebel's next step will be to sever all communications
Olbricht is confused
Frozen
(') Colonel Stauffenberg was explicit
We initiate Valkyrie regardless
Only Fromm can initiate
You know that
Then lie
Tell him Hitler's dead
Or arrest him
But do it now
But Olbricht is frozen
(') Sir
Did you hear me
You have to give the order to initiate Valkyrie
This is our only- 'm not doing anything until  talk to Fellgiebel
Get him back on the phone
Mertz shakes his head bitterly and dials, but he'll never get through
83
109
'  -    -          109 Stauffenberg's car presses on through the woods toward the last security checkpoint, but numerous new road barriers are in place
This is not good
One   and    step from the guardhouse, signalling Kretz to stop
No one gets in or out
We're on orders from the Fuhrer
We have to get to the airfield immediately
You will step aside
'm sorry, sir, but my orders are- Stauffenberg steps out of the vehicle and makes a beeline for the guardroom
Kolbe races after him
110
-                                 110 Stauffenberg snatches up the telephone before Kolbe and his men can stop him
Get me General Keitel
Stauffenberg wipes a single bead of sweat from his brow
With the guards hovering over him, he turns and casually sits on the desk, blocking the phone with his body
He surreptitiously rests his hand on the telephone cradle, hanging up
He talks to no one
(') Yes
General Keitel
Stauffenberg here
can't get past the outer gate
Sergeant
He looks at Kolbe
Kolbe swallows
Kolbe
Sergeant Kolbe says no one is getting out
Yes
Yes
Maybe you can explain it to him
84
Stauffenberg holds out the phone - staring hard, bluffing harder
Kolbe considers the phone
Finally: That won't be necessary, Colonel
111
'  -    -     111 humiliated Kolbe watches Stauffenberg's car speed away from the open barriers
Free
112
-                                           112 Silence but for the chattering engine
Kretz is distracted by movement in the rearview mirror
Haeften rummages through his briefcase, removing objects Kretz can't make out - tossing them, one by one, into the woods
Haeften realizes he is being watched by Kretz in the mirror and shoots him a look
"Mind your own business
" Kretz returns his attention to the road
But something just isn't sitting right with him
113
-  -                         113 : 1:15
Stauffenberg and Haeften climb aboard a waiting plane
beat later it is rolling down the runway
(
) Every second we stand here arguing is a second lost
114
- '  -              114 Olbricht is calm - in full denial
He straightens his tie in the mirror as Mertz paces the room, flustered
can't initiate Valkyrie without confirmation that Hitler's dead
It's too great a risk
85
What about Stauffenberg
What about his risk
He did his part and now you're abandoning him
Watch yourself, Colonel
Shouldn't you be consulting Beck
know just what Beck will say
He's a dying man
What does he have to lose
He puts on his hat and coat now, turning to leave
At least put the Reserve Army on alert
can't cover up another false alarm
When Stauffenberg returns, when he gives me confirmation
Then we'll proceed
Mertz is speechless
As Olbricht walks out: And where are you going
The same place you are
Lunch
115
'  -                              115 Keitel sits at his desk, listening intently to someone
Although his wounds are superficial, he certainly took a beating in the blast
: The one-eyed Colonel
Stauffenberg
86
He left the building very abruptly - just before the explosion
Several men left the building before the explosion
Yes, sir
Of course
But
But what
Spit it out, man
Well
The Colonel left his hat
Keitel's expression sours
"Is that all you've got for me
" He is about to say so when that prick Freyend barges in, also banged up
With him is Kretz - Stauffenberg's driver
Pardon the intrusion, sir, but think you will be most interested to hear what this man has to say
116
- '  -                116 : 2:00
Forty-five precious minutes have slipped away
Mertz sits alone at Olbricht's desk, lighting a fresh cigarette with the remains of another
The ashtray says he's been at this for quite a while
He stares at the clock, as if attempting to will time forward
His eyes sweep across Olbricht's desk, past his files, his stationery, framed photographs of his family
Then he looks up at a portrait of Hitler
Mertz is struck suddenly with a notion
He looks again at Olbricht's desk
His stationery
"Fuck it
" He grabs the stationery and feeds it into a typewriter
87
117
-   -          117 Mertz approaches a
Awkward pause
struggle with the soul
Then he hands over a sheet of paper
Orders from General Olbricht
----
118
-  -               118 Again we are inside the nerve center of Nazi communications
Again the teletypes busily chatter away
And again, Sgt
Helm is curious, watching: The   looks up at Helm
"What do do
" Helm glances over his shoulder to the uptight Lt
Haan - oblivious
Helm shrugs
Send it through
But keep me informed

119
-                   119 The siren, the sculpted eagle and swastika, the pillared stronghold
Tanks and heavy equipment are once again made ready
General Hase issues the alert signal just as he did before, watching the men of the Reserve Army scramble
In the melee we find Lieutenant Hagen
Here we go again
He says this to: 88
Major Remer, the man who was so suspicious last time is even more suspicious now
121
'  -   -                   121 light drizzle
man jabbering in Italian
We get our first good look at the demolished briefing hut
That anyone survived is a miracle
Officers crowd around the smoldering ruins, the Fuhrer himself heading this procession
He wears new clothes, nodding, smiling politely to the jabbering Italian slight wince is the only indication that he was damn near blown to bits just hours ago
none other than speaking an incessant stream of Italian
'
Blissful silence
Mussolini's blathering falls literally on deaf ears
122
-  -                           122 : 3:15
Three hours have passed since the explosion
Stauffenberg and Haeften alight from the plane
The airfield is surprisingly calm
No car to meet them
Quiet, isn't it
Too quiet
'll see where our driver is
Haeften walks over to the office
Stauffenberg looks around the airfield
The silence slowly becomes unnerving
He goes after Haeften
123
-                                123 Stauffenberg enters just in time to hear: ( ) You mean to tell me that the alert is only just going out- Stauffenberg swipes the phone from Haeften
89
( ) This is Stauffenberg
Get me General Olbricht
124
- '  -             124 Olbricht storms in, furious
He stands over Mertz, waving a document in his face - the very same document Mertz typed on Olbricht's stationery
Explain this
Someone had to do something while you were playing dead
We don't know that the Fuhrer is not alive
We don't know any- ,  ' Before a fuming Olbricht can respond, the phone rings
Both men look at it - Olbricht is afraid to answer
Mertz shakes his head and picks up
(') General Olbricht's office
He looks at Olbricht grimly, holding out the phone
(') Stauffenberg for you, sir
Olbricht would rather take a live cobra than handle the phone right now
But take it he does
125
-                       125 (Note: Intercut between Olbricht and Stauffenberg
) It's been three hours, Olbricht
What the hell have you been doing
We've had no confirmation that- 90
Dammit man,  saw the explosion myself
Nothing else matters now
We are committed
Olbricht sits, color draining from his face
real "what have  done" moment
Dear God
Now where is Fromm
Is he with us or did you- - No one has spoken to him yet
Stauffenberg pounds his fist on the wall, furious - for the first and only time showing us a crack in his ultra-cool exterior
He collects himself and looks at his watch
Listen to me, Olbricht
Never mind Germany
Never mind Europe
Your life is at stake now, do you understand
If you want to live through the night you'll do exactly as  say
understand
The second you hang up the phone, initiate Operation Valkyrie in Fromm's name
Then go over to his office in force, give him the choice to join us or place him under immediate arrest
Do  make myself perfectly clear
understand
am at the airfield now
will be in Fromm's office in fifteen minutes
Be there when  arrive
He slams the phone down, taking us to: 91
126
- '  -              126 Silence
With shaking hands, Olbricht moves the portrait of Hitler, exposing a hidden wall safe from which he removes, at last, a thick folder marked: He looks at Mertz
Get Beck and the others
Tell them it's time
Relieved, Mertz nods and rushes out
Olbricht picks up the phone and dials
After a beat, he reads from the first page of the Valkyrie order
(') This is General Olbricht calling on behalf of General Fromm - Commander of the Home Army
Adolf Hitler, is dead

Operation Valkyrie is in effect
All military districts, training schools and replacement troops are to take control of essential government offices at once

Haans sits at his desk, sensing someone over his shoulder
He turns to find Sgt
Helm, a sheet of paper in his trembling hands
The Fuhrer is dead
Skeptical, Haans snatches the paper from Helm
When he looks up, the entire staff is looking at him, some with tears in their eyes - others perhaps hiding a sense of relief
phone rings
Then another
The chattering teletypes seem to surge into another gear as news of Hitler's death starts to spread
92
Long pause
Haans struggles with the sheer size of the moment
You all know your jobs
Get to work
Zombie-like, the Operators go back to their teletypes, passing orders along
But one Operator - the one Helm asked to keep him informed - notices something strange about one order in a stack of many he is sifting through
Sergeant
This order is signed by Witzleben
(taking the paper) That's ridiculous
He`s not even in the army anymore
But sure enough, there is Witzleben's name
Strange
Helm looks over at the devastated Haans, wondering how to handle this
Then, like a good little Nazi: (') Pass the order along
128
-                   128 are marched into readiness
Vehicles moved into place
As they await further orders
(
) Who told you the Fuhrer was dead
129
- '  -                 129 Mertz and a sheepish Olbricht stand before Fromm stunned Lt
Herber hovers by the door
General Fellgiebel
At the Wolf's Lair
Fromm is at a loss for words
This just can't be so
He picks up the phone
93
( ) This is Fromm
Put me through to The Wolf's Lair
There's no use calling, all communication lines are- ( ) Yes
General Fromm for Field Marshal Keitel
Urgent
Mertz and Olbricht are shocked that he got through
130
'  - '  -                  130 Keitel is still nursing a few wounds
( ) What's going on up there
The most incredible rumors are circulating in Berlin
Immediately suspicious, Keitel plays dumb, leading
don't know what you mean
Everything's in order here
Keitel looks out the window at the still smoldering ruins of the conference hut in the distance
There's talk the Fuhrer's been assassinated
Another failed attempt
The Fuhrer was never in danger
(beat) By the way, where is your man Colonel Stauffenberg
131
- '  -                  131 Stauffenberg
On his way back to Berlin,  should think
At the very mention of his name, Olbricht starts squirming
94
( ) Let me know when he arrives
'd like a word with him
Certainly
Click
After a beat, Fromm hangs up, smug
(') false alarm
The Fuhrer is fine
Herber's outward relief stands in sharp contrast to Olbricht's barely contained dread
Then: (
) That's a lie
All eyes turn to see Stauffenberg and Haeften appear in the doorway
Mertz lets out a sigh of relief as they push their way past Herber and march into the room
Hitler is dead
Operation Valkyrie is in effect
Fromm stands, pounding his fist on the desk
-
You did
Be that as it may, the Reserve Army is assuming control here in Berlin
We trust you'll join us
Dammit, man
Do you realize what you've done
The Fuhrer is a- delivered the bomb myself
saw the blast
He is dead
Fromm is stunned on several levels
He slowly sits back in his chair
95
: Lt
Herber, who sees Stauffenberg as the model Nazi, is more shocked by this than the news of Hitler's death
This can't be happening
It's some kind of joke
Are you with us or not
Colonel, if what you say is true you should shoot yourself at once
(to the others) The rest of you are under arrest
No, General
You are
And with those words, Haeften and Mertz draw their pistols, training them on the confused Fromm
Herber is paralyzed - unsure of what to do
don't know where you think this is going, but  suggest you men change into civilian clothes and find a place to hide
(to Haeften) Lock him upstairs in his private quarters
Make sure his phone lines are cut
132
-  -                        132 Stauffenberg, Mertz and Olbricht march with great purpose
They are joined by Beck, coming the other way, wearing a plain dark suit
It is moving to see the old man manage the long walk
You're not in uniform
This has to be seen as a movement of the people
Then he takes Stauffenberg's arm, letting Mertz and Olbricht walk on, lowering his voice
96
(') You're certain he's dead
Certain
Stauffenberg can see the private fear in beck's eyes
But before he can answer, he is interrupted by a gasp
as Olbricht opens the door to his office, stepping back in shock
The others turn to see what it is
133
- '  -              133 Looking out at the shocked faces of Olbricht, Mertz, Beck and Stauffenberg
: Olbricht's office is packed to the four walls with - all of them standing in silence, looking at the leaders of the Resistance with great respect
Stauffenberg walks in and the crowd parts, solemn and silent, nodding and whispering thanks
steps forward
He looks hauntingly like the Lieutenant who drove Stauffenberg in Africa
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir
We're reporting for duty
Stauffenberg is moved beyond words
Suddenly, what was once a small clutch of discarded generals and politicians is now a movement of motivated men
Stauffenberg nods, collects himself
In the crowd he finds Helldorf, the head of the Berlin Police, whom we met earlier
At first he speaks quietly, humbled
(shaking hands) Helldorf, 'm
glad to see you
We're getting a late start and we need all of the manpower we can muster
Can we count on the police
There's a lot of talk that Hitler isn't really dead
Is this true
Awkward pause
Good question
The men in the room share nervous glances
Then all eyes on Stauffenberg
can't offer you any guarantees
The decision is yours and yours alone
Can we count on you
97
Long pause
the uneasy faces of the men in the room, perhaps all of them waiting to see what Helldorf does before making their decisions
Finally: 'm with you
Stauffenberg can barely hide his relief
There is a palpable shift in the room
One by one, the officers in the room reaffirm their commitment to the coup
Have your men surround the building
No one gets in or out of here without my permission
(to the others) want every available soldier on task - we need simultaneous control of every government building in the city
Dismissed
The soldiers move, but Beck's voice stops them - surprisingly loud and clear for a sick old man
Acts of vengeance will not be tolerated
We represent a different form of government
We represent what is good and just in Germany

He is frantically speaking into the phone and to those present

Of most importance are communication centers - newspapers, radio stations, telephone and telegraph offices
All Nazi officials and government leaders are to be arrested at once

Again, we focus on Major Remer, Commander of the Deutschland Guard Battalion and always suspicious
(') Is there a problem, Major
It just all seems very
vague, sir
Protocol dictates we should receive orders in writing- These are the orders as they were presented to me, Major
Now move
Pause
Just before the pause becomes insolent, Remer clicks his heels and salutes, leaving
But the look on his face tells us he's hatching a plan of his own
You are right to be nervous
137

come out of various government buildings with    in custody, hands bound
They push them into waiting trucks
Meanwhile,   walk quickly by, trying to pretend they don't see anything
Years of Nazi rule have told them to mind their own business

Lt
Hagen emerges from the chaos on the streets
Major Remer
We've just had orders from the War Ministry
The battalion is to blockade the government quarter and place Minister Goebbels under arrest
Remer does not move
He just thinks
(') What is it, Major
Something just doesn't feel right about this
would hate to find out 'm being taken advantage of

Of that  am certain
What  can't say is which side we're on

Be quick about it

Each man shouts orders into the phone, all the while signing dispatches sent by a steady flow of
(the secretary who worked with Stauffenberg and Tresckow to compile the Valkyrie orders) rushes in, whispering to Stauffenberg
Send him in
(Oven hesitates) It's all right
Send him in

She opens the door and motions to someone outside
After a beat, the door is filled with an almost classic looking Nazi -    bristling with medals
He enters the room, confused when he sees Olbricht at Fromm's desk
Begging your pardon, but  have orders to report to General Fromm
General Fromm is no longer in command
am
(seeing Beck) Beck
What are you- What is going on here
The Fuhrer is dead
The  is staging a coup
We've initiated Operation Valkyrie to crush the uprising and save Hitler's Germany
The Fat General assesses the scene with suspicion

Olbricht offers a sheet of paper
You will present these orders to your troops
will do no such thing without speaking to General Fromm

Join us or face the consequences
Stauffenberg and Olbricht take an imposing step in the Fat General's direction
He carefully backs away
101
This is treason
won't take part
The Fuhrer is not dead The Fat General makes a break for it
The conspirators chase him out into

But they just watch the commotion, stunned
ranking general being chased like a common criminal
Surreal
Haeften and Mertz appear at the other end of the hall - pistols raised, blocking the General's path
With Stauffenberg and Olbricht they overpower the Fat General who screams wildly to the amazement of the gawking officers
' When they have him under control, Stauffenberg turns to the onlookers
He finds a familiar face in the crowd
face he can trust
He finds: Lt
Herber
Come here

Herber
"Who, me

(') Lock him up with Fromm
Herber hesitantly takes hold of the General, but the act of taking a General into custody is a strange one
Herber is clearly conflicted
142
-                                  142 Est
Remer arrives, followed by a wave of trucks
Soldiers deploy, surrounding the building
102
143
- '  -              143 Propaganda Minister Goebbels - the most ghoulish of Hitler's Big Six
His spooky, deep-set eyes watch the action on the street below
Already he can hear troops coming down the hallway
He takes a pistol from his desk drawer and leaves it within reach
Then he picks up the phone and dials
After a beat
am ready to be connected
The sound of footsteps outside his door
It bursts open
Remer enters, followed by
(') What can  do for you, Major
Minister Goebbels, my battalion has an order to blockade the government quarter and place you under arrest
Remer sees the pistol on Goebbels desk
But Goebbels makes no attempt to grab for it
Instead: Are you a dedicated Nazi, Major
Remer is caught off guard
Yes, sir
With that Goebbels turns his attention to the phone in his hand
We hear a faint voice: "Hello
" With an eerie smile, Goebbels simply extends his arm, offering the phone to a confused Remer
Silence as the Major takes it, holding it to his ear
(') Hello
( ) Do you recognize my voice
Remer is in awe, for a moment unable to speak
Then: Of course, Mein Fuhrer
103
( ) Then listen to me very carefully
144
-  -               144 The communications staff busily connects calls and transmits orders
Sgt
Helm gingerly approaches Lt
Haans with two sheets of paper
What is it now, Sergeant
It's just that now we're getting conflicting orders, sir
The Wolf's Lair says one thing, Stauffenberg another
Haans sighs, genuinely irritated now
Our job is not to interpret the orders
Our job is to pass them along
Regardless
Yes, but sir- Is that perfectly clear, Sergeant
Haans thrusts the orders back at Helm who sheepishly walks back to his pool of radio operators
145
-                                145 As day turns to night, the soldiers surrounding the government quarters wait for further orders
Major Remer comes out a new man - invigorated and focused
He walks over to a truck loaded with , turning to the soldiers guarding them
(re: prisoners) Release these men at once
But these men are part of a coup
104
've just been on the phone with Hitler himself
We are the coup, you idiot
We've been duped
146
- '  -             146 Fromm is a prisoner in his own quarters - staring at a portrait of Hitler with equal parts disdain and reverence
The door suddenly opens
Herber enters, leading the handcuffed Fat General
Avoiding Fromm's gaze, he removes the restraints and turns to leave
But the wily Fromm can see the look in Herber's eyes
Well, Lieutenant
What do you make of all of this
Herber freezes
Beat
don't know
won't ask you to make a choice
That's for you and you alone
All ask is that you observe and think for yourself
In time you'll see things for what they truly are
You know where to find me when you do
Herber nods hesitantly, then turns to leave, but: (') Lieutenant
(as Herber turns back) Heil Hitler
Herber raises his right arm, just managing: Heil Hitler
147
- '  -            147 Goebbels' office is now the scene of great activity
Soldiers rush in and out carrying orders
Goebbels is on two phones at the same time
105
Through the melee comes none other than Heinrich Himmler - the bespectacled villain whose appearance is unmatched in fiction
His arrival cannot be good
Have you seen the Fuhrer
Is he- It seems the conference table shielded him from the blast
He's lucky to be alive
(looking around) Do you want to tell me what's going on
Everything is under control
've taken charge of the Guard Battalion and given them new orders
We're turning the tables on these cowards
've been sent here personally by the Fuhrer to collect the conspirators
He insists they be taken alive
Goebbels and Himmler, two of the most evil men who ever lived, smile coldly
Being taken alive by this mob is obviously a fate worse than death
Goebbels turns to a nearby
Take this down
By order of Adolf Hitler
----
148
-  -            148 Once again the operators are frozen, looking at Lt
Haans
He in turn looks at two orders in his hands
He is deeply confused
Sgt
Helm is not
It's a coup all right
And when it's over, we'd better wind up on the right side
Now we can't afford to remain neutral any longer
We have to make a decision
106
: Haans
All eyes watch him weigh the decision of his life, of many lives
Millions in fact
Finally he relents, handing one paper to Helm
Very well
Send all communications from the Wolf's Lair
Stop all communications from Stauffenberg
The operators spring into action
----
(
) Today an attempt was made on the Fuhrer's life
149
- '  -              149 Stauffenberg works frantically in a room full of officers - the energy here being the antithesis of Goebbels' office - the morale quickly waning
He ignores the radio, writing orders, making phone calls, fighting to keep the coup alive
But we know now his orders are hitting a dead end
The Fuhrer himself suffered no major injuries and resumed his work immediately
Stauffenberg turns off the radio, grabbing Haeften just as he is coming in
Send the following teleprint to all Army Commanders
`Broadcast communique not correct
The Fuhrer is dead
Orders to be carried out with utmost dispatch
' Haeften nods and leaves
Stauffenberg turns back to his work, coming face to face with a deeply troubled Beck
Stauffenberg whispers, frustrated
(') saw the blast
(
) What the hell kind of coup is this
107
All eyes turn to find Witzleben
Hours ago he was a civilian, now he is a pompous, know-it-all General
The military districts are receiving contradictory reports
've got men sitting around joking about whose turn it is to arrest whom
Neither the capital nor the radio network are under our control
And where are the troops
You'd think there would be some activity going on in this city
(to Stauffenberg) The word is all over the street that Hitler is still alive
We trusted you and you failed us
You should have stayed
To be sure
(
) And who would have led the men here in Berlin
You
Finding his balls, Olbricht confronts Witzleben
(') The Colonel did more than any man could have hoped
If anyone is to blame it's- Field Marshal Witzleben is right am the officer in charge
am the man responsible
No one else
Olbricht is moved and rightly so
Meanwhile: 'm going home to await my inevitable arrest
Witzleben turns, marching out
The room remains ill at ease, everyone having just witnessed a serious blow to the Resistance
Those anonymous soldiers present exchange glances of concern
'm sorry, Colonel
After a beat, Olbricht turns and leaves
, tucked away in a corner of the office
108
He looks at Stauffenberg in a new light now, something darker - no longer the admirer
He shares a look with
wordless understanding
He leaves and they follow
150
-  -                        150 Herber and company march down the hallway in silence
They stop for Herber to unlock the door to
151
-    -         151 The officers file in, making a beeline for a locker in the corner of the room
Inside are all manner of sub-machine guns, pistols, grenades
Arm yourselves
152
-                                  152 Under Remer's direction the Deutschland Guard Battalion quickly surrounds the War Ministry
We see a figure moving behind the windows up above
153
- '  -              153 Olbricht helplessly watches troops surround the building below
It is only a matter of time now
He sits at his desk
With a long trembling sigh, he puts pen to paper and writes: "My dearest wife
" commotion from the anteroom startles Olbricht and he drops the pen
loud, shrill scream follows
The door bursts open to reveal Herber and his They are supported by , all training their weapons on Olbricht
In the anteroom behind the soldiers we see Fraulein Oven quietly slipping out into the hallway
109
154
- '  -                 154 Beck, Stauffenberg and Haeften are still making calls and writing orders - doing all they can to keep the coup alive
They are startled when Fraulein Oven bursts in
It is written on her face
155
-  -                        155 Stauffenberg and Haeften rush toward Olbricht's office, stopping when they see a surrounding the doorway
chill runs down our spines when we see Herber talking to none other than Major Remer
Just then, he spots Stauffenberg and Haeften
Stauffenberg and Haeften turn and run
(') shot is fired
Stauffenberg and Haeften take cover in a nearby doorway
Haeften returns fire
Stauffenberg clamps his pistol under the stump of his right arm, managing to cock it with the three fingers of his left hand
Awkward
Then he aims and fires
Stauffenberg takes a bullet in the shoulder of his good arm
He drops his gun, bleeding badly
But   appear at the opposite end of the corridor
The loyal Haeften covers Stauffenberg with his body, aiming to fire
But Stauffenberg stops him, shaking his head
It's over
They toss down their guns
Boot-steps approach loudly
As Stauffenberg looks down at the cross and ring around his neck: Thank you, Colonel
Stauffenberg is genuinely confused
"For what
" (') Better  die for Germany than for Hitler
110
(
) Colonel Stauffenberg
Stauffenberg turns to find Remer standing there
You're under arrest
160
- '  -                 160 Stauffenberg, Olbricht, Beck, Mertz and Haeften, the last of the conspiracy, are held at gunpoint
smug Fromm enters, followed by Herber, the Fat General, Remer and numerous -
If you have any last messages, you'd better write them now
My actions speak for me
(to his men) 'd rather my wife and children remember our last time together
The others bravely nod in agreement
But then: 'd like a pistol, please
Stauffenberg looks at Beck with surprise
(') For personal reasons
Fromm thinks about it, then matter-of-factly hands Beck a pistol
Remer quickly steps forward
General, my orders are to deliver the prisoners alive
Noted, Major
(to Beck) Get on with it then
But, sir- ,
111
Fromm glares at Remer who angrily backs down
Then he turns to Beck and with a casual wave of the hand: (') Continue
The moment is surreal
Beck, seated at the desk, looks at each of his fellow conspirators
look of thanks, goodbye
With a badly trembling hand he places the gun to his temple
'm thinking of earlier times
: The conspirators turn away, unable to watch
Except Stauffenberg
And as if none of the last minute has even occurred, Fromm turns to the other conspirators
Very well then
court martial, convened by me in the Fuhrer's absence, has pronounced sentence: Colonel Mertz von Quernheim, General Olbricht, Lieutenant Haeften
(glaring at Stauffenberg) And the Colonel, whose name  will not mention, are condemned to death
(to his men) Take them outside
Remer is clearly upset by this
Herber, on the other hand, seems clearer than ever
He nods to his men who drag the conspirators out
Herber personally takes Stauffenberg by the arm
The two men share a look
Nothing needs to be said
Each has found his place
Stauffenberg turns to confront Fromm
He is weak, white from fatigue and loss of blood
The Fuhrer will want to put us on trial, make an example of us
This won't win you any favor
And it won't hide you're involvement
Involvement
don't know what you- 112
You knew and you did nothing
You're just as guilty as we are
Even more so
Spare me, Stauffenberg
And those words bring a genuine smile to Stauffenberg's face
He almost pities Fromm now
No one will be spared
And as Fromm motions for Herber to take Stauffenberg away, we hear music, faintly at first - accompanied by the subtle hiss and crackles of a phonograph
It is the piece Stauffenberg and Nina were dancing to one night long ago
Over this: voice
man speaking in German - faint at first, crackling over the radio
(
) My comrades
Once again -  don't know how many times it has been now - an attempt has been made on my life
/
-  - series of images of the coup being reversed as the Nazis take back power, made all the more poignant by the lonely sound of the phonograph, the music slowly rising, growing clearer and eventually becoming score over the silent images of: Conspirators being rounded up and arrested
Among them are faces we recognize
Goerdeler, dragged from a hotel bed by   as his informing  watches from the doorway
:

Witzleben is led in handcuffs from his home where he has been awaiting his fate

-                                  161 Military vehicles are hastily arranged in a semi- circle - headlamps marking the scene in stark white light and long black shadows
Stauffenberg, Haeften, Olbricht and Mertz are marched into the courtyard, squinting in the harsh light as they are placed against the wall of the War Ministry
(
) speak to you tonight for two reasons
First, so that you can hear my voice and know that  am unhurt
And second, so that you may know the details of a crime without parallel in German history
/
-  - Fellgiebel is swarmed by  in his office at the Wolf's Lair and summarily beaten
:    - , 10 1944

- of the Deutschland Guard Battalion scramble to form a line opposite Stauffenberg and his conspirators
We can clearly read Fromm's lips, shouting: "
" Stauffenberg and Haeften share a reassuring smile
Remer watches bitterly from the shadows, focusing his hatred not on the conspirators
but on Fromm
/
-  - Berthold, Stauffenberg's brother, is taken from his flat in Berlin
114
:    - , 10 1944
, 10  1944
- Fromm smiles to himself, satisfied
(
) small clique of ambitious, dishonorable, stupid officers have conspired to eliminate me
Except for a few bruises and burns,  was completely untouched
Fromm raises his arm, his lips reading: "
" :    - , 7 1945
, 12  1945
Stauffenberg takes a breath and shouts defiantly, his lips reading: "Long live sacred German-" Fromm drops his hand
Ten rifles open fire
and away as the music swells, as what is left of Berlin comes into view, as the few lights that remain suddenly go out as if a dark shadow were passing over the land
(
) (') see in this the hand of Providence
directing me to complete my work
And the last strains   of music resolve in a single, sustained note as we     , looking at last to the overcast   darkness of the night sky
The last note goes on as   if it might play forever
Until suddenly it dips and we realize we are no longer hearing music at all, but the urgent wailing of an air-raid siren - the warning of allied bombers coming to deliver their nightly assault on Berlin
Hitler's gift to Germany
