Written by Paddy Chayefsky 1971 , of The Hospital -- a vast medical complex, a sprawling pastiche of architecture extending ten blocks north and south on First Avenue and east to the river
The Hospital was founded in the late 19th century, and there are still a few begrimed Victorian Bedlams and Bastilles among the buildings
Mostly though, it is Medical Modern 1971, white and chrome and lots of glass and concrete shafts and rotundas
spanking new Community Mental Health Clinic towers among the tenements at the northern end of the complex
On the far side of First Avenue, a twenty-story apartment house with recessed balconies and picture windows to house the resident staff has just recently been completed, and next to it, eight ghetto buildings are being demolished to make way -- according to the construction company's sign -- for a new Drug Rehabilitation Center, to be completed in 1973, we should all live so long
This is where the shattering are coming from
block length of generators and cement and demolition machines are , ,
Traffic  and  up First Avenue
It is a cold spring morning -- 10:00
1966 station wagon pulls up to the Holly Pavilion
tiny, fragile, white-bearded  , almost lost in his overcoat, is helped from the rear of a station wagon and slowly led to the entrance doors by a middle-aged nurse
On Monday morning, a patient named Guernsey, male, middle-seventies was admitted to the hospital complaining of chest pains
The old man is now in a wheelchair pushed by a hospital orderly down the corridor
He had been referred by a nursing home where the doctor had diagnosed his condition as angina pectoris
Now it is axiomatic that nursing home doctors are always wrong
806 The old man, shirtless, is propped on the edge of the bed, wheezing
, a young intern in white-uniform, perches beside him with the old man's chart in his lap, taking down his history
The other patient in the two-bedded room, a - , is comatose and all rigged up with
's and catheters
The intern who admitted Mr
Guernsey, however, accepted the diagnosis and prescribed morphine, a drug suitable for angina but not at all suitable for emphysema, which is, unfortunately, what the old man actually had
Within an hour
Two orderlies rush the old man's bed with, of course, the old man in it, past the Nurses' Station and into a waiting elevator
the patient became unresponsive and diaphoretic and was raced up to Intensive Care with an irregular pulse of 150, blood pressure 90 over 60, respiration rapid and shallow
An oxygen mask is applied to the old man's face by the resident
The resident on duty now compounded the blunder by treating the old man for pulmonary edema
He gave him digitalis, diuretics and oxygen
This restored the old man's color
The elevator door opens
Two orderlies wheel the sleeping man on his bed back around the Nurses' Station and down the corridor to his room
and he was sent back to his room in the Holly Pavilion, ruddy complected and peacefully asleep
806 The old man is back in his room sleeping serenely, his tiny body making barely a ripple in the white sheet that covers him
The room is in hushed shadows
yellowish light diffuses into the room from the half-opened bathroom door
The other patient in the room remains as before, comatose and silent
In point of fact, the patient was in CO2 narcosis
806 All the lights are on now
and an orderly are wrapping the old man in a post-mortem shroud
, the senior resident, is giving hell to Schaefer, the intern
and died at seven-thirty that evening
The shrouded body of the old man is wheeled out of the room
on the vacated bed
mention all this, only to explain how the bed in Room 806 became available
from bed to Schaefer, now alone in the room and regarding the empty bed with frowning interest
Schaefer is a scraggly young fellow, bespectacled, with a contemporary mess of hair and a swinging unkempt moustachio
on Schaefer
The intern involved was a prickly young buck named Schaefer who had a good thing going for him with a technician in the hematology lab
In the haphazard fashion of hospital romances, Dr
Schaefer had been zapping this girl on wheelchairs, stretchers, pantry shelves
Dr
Schaefer moves for the phone on the table between the two beds
in the kitchen, in the morgue, in the dark corners of corridors
Schaefer speaks softly into the phone
standing up, sitting down -- so you can imagine what an available bed meant to him
(on phone) Hey, Sheila, this is Howard, Sheila
Hey listen
got us a bed for tonight
real, honest-to-god bed
on - of the beaming, lubricious Schaefer on phone as -- , the following scenes: 806 Dark
Just a bit of moonlight streaking through the not quite closed bathroom
The hallway door opens, and a young woman, carrying a top coat, slips quickly in giggling like hell, followed by Schaefer, who is likewise giggling and admonishing her to be quiet
Her name is
Sheila notices the other patient in the room sleeping away and looks questioningly at Schaefer, who reassures her as he removes her coat
After which he strips off his own white jacket and trousers and hangs them in the armoire
The girl asks in a hoarse whisper if they're going to get totally nude and wonders if that's such a good idea
For an answer, Schaefer fondles her crotch
They both giggle, they both shush each other, they giggle again; they're both stoned
The girl unzippers her dress
The dark room is filled for the moment with the flurry of undressing, flung garments, elbows, legs and arms, bumpings into each other, and Sheila saying between giggles, "Boy, sure hope nobody walks in
" They eventually wind up on the unoccupied bed, and the scene ends looking  the sleeping profile of   in the other bed as Schaefer and his girl thump away at each other with much creaking of springs, moans, groans, giggles and the white-limbed patterns of fornication
806 Dark, silent, hushed
The fun and games are over
Sheila is in front of the armoire
She slips back into her dress, after which she tiptoes back to the bed where Schaefer is deeply asleep, smiling in postcoital peace
Sheila bends, shakes his shoulder
(whispers) 'll see you
Schaefer smiles, grunts, sleeps on
: 6:30
, cold newly-dawned sun shines down on the vast sprawling complex of the hospital
Desultory early morning traffic on First Avenue
, The night shift of nurses is closing out another night's work, which has been on the whole uneventful
The head nurse, , hunches over her paperwork sits at the desk beside her, resting her head on the palm of one hand
'
crosses with an armful of linens
She disappears into the pharmacy and supply areas behind the Nurses' Station
In the west corridor, glances at her watch, then pads down to Room 806
She enters
806 cold gray light cheerlessly illuminates the room
Nurse Perez checks the
on the comatose patient who is in the bed nearest the door
Then she turns to regard the other bed -- which gives her pause
'
: Intern Dr
Schaefer is lying on this bed, rigid, eyes dilated, pupils staring unseeing
An
tube sticks out of his naked right arm
Nurse Perez doesn't quite know what to make of the fact that Dr
Schaefer is lying on that bed with an
tube sticking out of him looking dead
Frowning, she reaches out a tentative hand to shake his naked shoulder
Doctor Schaefer
There is, of course, no response
terrible suspicion enters Nurse Perez's mind, and she closes her eyes and sighs a long shuddering sigh
Then she opens her eyes and, with a second and briefer sigh, reaches for Schaefer's neck to take his pulse
Clearly, the result is not encouraging
She sighs another short sigh and regards Schaefer's unblinking, dilated pupils
It's all a bit too much for her; she shuffles to the window and stares out into the gray morning where things are a little more comprehensible
Once again, she returns to the bed, regards Schaefer's death mask
She raises the bedsheet and, for one short but appreciative moment, considers Schaefer's naked body
She lets the bedsheet carefully down
She sighs again
(trying again, with little hope) Doctor Schaefer
She sighs, turns and leaves the room
Nurse Perez, frowning and pursing her lips, moves slowly back to
, ' Head Nurse Reardon is still bent over her paperwork
Listen, did you know Doctor Schaefer was in Eight--Six, because he's dead
(late forties, continues her painstaking paperwork, grunts) What
'm just telling you, Dr
Schaefer is dead
(works on; after a moment, looks up) What do you want, Perez
Look,  don't know what the hell this is all about, but Dr
Schaefer is in Room 806 with an
running and he's dead
didn't even know he was sick
(regards Perez a moment) Perez, what the hell are you talking about
(appeals to Nurse Rivers coming out of the floor pharmacy) Do you know what the hell she's talking about
Well, maybe 'm going crazy
don't know
Isn't Room 806 the patient Guernsey
mean, did something happen don't know about
Perez,  don't know what you're talking about
This is the nuttiest thing  ever saw
Dr
Schaefer's in Room 806 dead
What Dr
Schaefer
Our Dr
Schaefer
Our Dr
Schaefer
The one who's always grabbing everybody's ass
(to Nurse Rivers) Do you know what she's talking about
don't know what she's talking about
(to Perez) What do you mean Doctor Schaefer's in Room 806 dead
mean, he's lying on the far bed, stone dead, and with an
tube sticking out of him
And if you don't believe me, maybe you just ought to get up and look for yourself
With a short, irritable sigh, Mrs
Reardon abandons her paperwork and heads down the west corridor, followed by Nurses Perez and Rivers
as Mrs
Reardon turns to Nurse Rivers
All right, maybe you'd better call Mrs
Christie
Phone
' Dark
Venetian blinds drawn
set on, a gray coarse-grained square
, 53 years old, a large man, bulky, disheveled, apparently fell asleep in a chair while watching television the night before
The bed still has its spread on but is rumpled
Bock is in trousers and shirt, collar opened, barefooted
The reading lamp is the only light in the room except for the sheen of gray hissing from the television
Newspapers litter the floor
Books, two-day-old plates of food, yesterday's mugs of coffee, cigar-stuffed ashtrays, a shirt, a pair of pants, a winter overcoat, a battered gray fedora have been slung about
on the bedtable  again, begins to penetrate the sotted sleep of the man
Two bottles of booze, one empty, and a clump of glasses are on the coffee table in front of Bock
He grunts, opens an eye
Bock suddenly exsufflates in a snorting grunt
He stands, shuffles to the bed, a big, sodden fellow, picks up the receiver, interrupting its next
He sinks, sitting on the bed
This is Dr
Bock
Yes, Mrs
Christie, what is it
It's all right, 'd be getting up in a few minutes anyway
'm sorry  missed that
Would you say it again
Yes,  know him, Schaefer, the stud with the glasses, who fancies the nurses
'm afraid  don't understand that, what do you mean
Was he sick mean, was he
uh, what was the cause of death
Was he being treated
don't understand
What was he doing in the bed
You did say he
Look, Mrs
Christie, did you call the office
Good, well, 'll
No, no, it's all right
'll be getting my wake-up call any minute anyway
He returns the receiver to its cradle, sits disoriented, unbuttoning his shirt
8:00
of the hospital, now alive and jumping
Taxis pull up and out of the large -shaped drive
noisy picket line of about twenty chanting protesters parade with signs in an uneven ellipse
(chanting) Two-four
Help the poor
Most of the placards are slogan-y: "
" -- "
" Two protesters move toward the street, waving and yelling at an approaching car
One, a young white fellow wears a sandwich board that goes into the matter at some length: "     386 " In the back seat of the car sits  , handsomely graying, tanned, early fifties, the Director of the Hospital
He looks up
That young demonstrator,
, a sandy-haired bespectacled man of 30 in a white doctor's coat, sidles to the car's open rear window angrily shouting
What do you say, Sundstrom
How much longer do you think our monopolistic, exclusionary, racist policies will work
We're the hope
Sundstrom lowers his window and gives his driver directions
He exits in the  parking area, where he notices Bock emerging from his car
Sundstrom waits for him
So how's it going, Herb
Bock's sour glance says it all
He locks his car, joins Sundstrom, and the two men start down the concrete ramp
(after a moment) One of my interns dropped dead this morning
Really
'm sorry to hear that understand you've moved out to a hotel
Yes
It got that bad with Phyllis
It's been that bad for twenty-four years
Are you going to be solicitous
Yes
Oh, God
They trudge across the -shaped entrance drive, pausing to let a car pass
Listen, Herb, 'm the guy who brought you into this hospital, so  think can skip the diplomatic overtures
Marty stopped me in the hall yesterday, very upset
He had just had lunch with you and said you sounded suicidal
Marty tends to be extravagant, but he's not the only one
Jack Singer mentioned the other day you've been boozing it up a lot
And let's face it, you've been sloughing off
understand you haven't even been doing rounds
'm going to do rounds today
They pick their way around the shuffling line of protesters -- many with Afro haircuts and tinted glasses, including a black minister and four young white activists
,  , Early-arriving secretaries chat in the doorways
The corridor itself connects to the Bryce Pavilion (pediatrics, gynecology and obstetrics), so a steady stream of traffic moves back and forth
Bock and Sundstrom enter the corridor and slow to a halt to continue their chat by a wall
Herb, want a couple of days off
No
Go down to Montego Bay, get drunk, get laid, get a little sun
For God's sake, John, 'm fifty-three years old with all the attendant fears
just left my wife after twenty-four years
Standard case of menopausal melancholy
Maybe you ought to have a talk with Joe Einhorn
don't want to see a psychiatrist
Stop worrying about me
All  have to do is get my ass back to work, and 'll be fine
'm sorry 've caused you concern
He sets off down the long corridor to the elevators , the Administrator of the Hospital, comes out of one of the offices, waves a good morning to Bock, who acknowledges him and plods on
Mead comes up to Sundstrom, now moving toward his own office
Sid just called from St
Luke's, and he's heard that the demonstrators up there are planning a march to join the bunch down here
Oh, God
(he wraps his arm around Mead's shoulders, ushering him into his office area) Did you call the cops
Yes
,
8:15
The elevator door opens
Out comes Bock, overcoat unbuttoned now
He clumps to the Nurses' Station
An unusual number of nurses seems to be there
Through the doorway of the floor pharmacy, we can see Nurse Rivers of the night shift being comforted by Nurse Perez of the night shift and Nurse Edwards of the morning shift
The head morning nurse,
, is at the desk hunched over her paperwork
(Nurses are always hunched over their paperwork
)    is also seated at the desk doing some paperwork
Head Nurse Donovan looks up briefly as Dr
Bock approaches
(back to her paperwork) They're all in Eight--Six, Doctor
What happened
think 'll just let Mrs
Christie tell you about it
Bock lumbers off for the west corridor through a press of activity
Kitchen workers trundle creaking portable carts, nurse's aids and attendants pop in and out of doorways bearing trays and used dishes
robed patient or two ambulates along the hall
Morning rounds have just started, which means a clump of white-jacketed, white-trousered young doctors are gathered in a gaggle at the far end
The group includes senior resident  , junior resident  , interns   and   and another medical student, all lounging outside a door discussing the condition of the patient within
Chandler is presenting the case from a handful of notecards in his hand
The others lean against the walls, listening
They wear shirts and ties with the exception of Ambler, who is new to the floor and still in the canonical white tunic under his jacket
They are all in their twenties and have swinger sideburns and occasional mustaches
When he spots Dr
Bock, senior resident Brubaker turns the rounds over to Biegelman and joins Bock just outside 806
(as he approaches, rolls his eyes) Oh boy
What happened
've seen some pretty good snafus, but this one
mean, there's a certain splendor to this one
One of the night nurses, a float, thought Schaefer was a patient and plugged an
into him
He was a diabetic, you know
What do you mean, a nurse plugged an into him
Oh, it's really a screwed-up story, Doctor
You see, what happened was we had an old man in that bed who died last night, so the bed was available
And you know Schaefer
He's Sammy Stud
And he talked a nurse into zapping him on that bed
think it was a girl from hematology he's been running with
My God, it's a Roman farce
The door to Room 806 opens, and an Assistant Administrator named  pokes his head out
thought  heard you out here, Doctor
(he too rolls his eyes heavenward in an expression of incredulity) Bock makes a noise and goes into
806 Aside from Hitchcock, the room includes
, the Director of Nurses, a fusty forty-six, in streetclothes; Head Night Nurse, Mrs
Reardon, in uniform; Head Evening Nurse,
, mid-fifties, who had apparently been called in from home because she's in mufti and wearing a winter coat; and, of course, the comatose patient and the dead Dr
Schaefer
Mrs
Christie is instructing the two nurses
'll need one from both of you, three copies, and  suggest you do that right now
The forms are in my office
Mrs
Dunne, on the verge of tears, head bobbing, looks up to Bock
'm really so terribly sorry about this, Dr
Bock
(regarding Schaefer's rigid death mask) As  understand it, one of the nurses inadvertently administered an
to Schaefer here
How the hell could that happen
Listen,  think we ought to straighten this out somewhere else
Yes, very good idea
Oh God, what a mess
They all file out now, Bock in the rear into
, ' They all go along to the Nurses' Station where Mrs
Reardon and Mrs
Dunne disappear into the rooms behind
Mrs
Christie leads Hitchcock and the trailing Bock to the -solarium; but Dr
Brubaker is now holding his rounds there
He stands, quietly expounding on the uses of heparin, a decoagulant
One of the patients last night had hemorrhaged consequent to injudicious use of that drug
Listening, the other young doctors make notes
Mrs
Christie leans against the wall
Apparently, the conference is to take place in the corridor
Background activity continues normally
(with a sigh) Well, these things happen, of course
suppose 'd better call the Medical Examiner
still don't know what happened
Well, it took an hour to get it sorted out
It seems a patient named Guernsey died last night in Eight--Six, but that information wasn't given to the night nurses
These things happen
Bock has begun to get the drift
curious state of apathy settles over him
(rattling on) At any rate, according to the cardex, the patient Guernsey was down for twenty-five milligrams of Sparine - 6-, so Mrs
Reardon sent Nurse Perez to give him his twelve o'clock shot
Meanwhile, it seems Dr
Schaefer had usurped that particular bed for his own purposes
Dr
Brubaker suggests it was for a love tryst, and some weight is given that hypothesis by the fact that Dr
Schaefer was naked
(trying to give his attention to this) get the drift, Mrs
Christie
In other words, Nurse Perez went in and sedated Dr
Schaefer thinking it was the patient Guernsey
My God
What don't understand
If  may finish, Doctor
Well, after Perez gave him his shot, she noticed the
on the bed had been pinched off, and she reported that back to Mrs
Reardon, who then assigned Nurse Rivers to restart the
(Bock sighs) Now Rivers was a float
She didn't even know the staff people on the floor, and nobody knew what the patient Guernsey looked like anyway, since he'd only been admitted that morning
So she plugged an
into him
Yes
How much
liter
(The doctor in him intrudes into his lassitude) five percent glucose solution won't kill anybody
Did he have any other ancillary conditions
He wasn't dehydrated, was he
Didn't anybody bother to go in to check him during the night, even under the impression he was merely a patient
Was he hyperasthmolic
Did he have a bad heart
He must have had some kind of thrombosis
want the post done here, Mr
Hitchcock
And you and better have a little chat, Mrs
Christie, about your excessive use of float nurses
've got nearly a thousand nurses in this hospital
(gathering rage) And every time one of them has her period, she disappears for three days
My doctors complain regularly they can't find the same nurse on the same floor two days in a row
What the hell am  supposed to tell that boy Schaefer's parents
That a substitute nurse assassinated him, because she couldn't tell the doctors from the patients on the floor
My God, the incompetence here is absolutely radiant
mean, two separate nurses walk into a room, stick needles into a man -- and one of those was a number eighteen jelco
-- tourniquet the poor sonofabitch, anchor the poor sonofabitch's arm with adhesive tape, and it's the wrong poor sonofabitch
mean, my God
Where do you train your nurses, Mrs
Christie
Dachau
(he is aware his voice has risen and is attracting attention
He lowers his voice) All right, wrap him up and get him down to Pathology
'm especially interested in his blood sugar liter of glucose never killed anybody
Your ladies must've done something else to him
Will there be anything else, Doctor
No
Before you call the family, Doctor, wish you'd talk to Mr
Mead about this
We'd like, naturally, to avoid litigation
Bock heads abruptly down the corridor to the elevators
,  , corridor of offices
This is the Department of Medicine, where Bock and all the senior staff members of the department have their offices
It's quiet, since most of the staff are away at their various specialties about the hospital
Bock comes up the corridor still wearing the overcoat he arrived in some hours ago
He has only managed to unbutton it in all the time it has taken him to reach the corner office
Gilt lettering on the door reads: and below that
' , Small office with two desks
As Department Chief, Bock gets two secretaries
Both are at their desks, one on the phone, , and the other rattling away on the , McGUIRE
(mouthing) Coffee
It would seem not
Bock waves a listless hand, exits into
' The modestly imposing office is lined with medical tomes
Bock slips out of his coat and jacket and hangs them in the closet
In shirtsleeves with his tie a bit askew -- fastidiousness in dress is not Bock's strong point -- he crosses to his desk and sits, breathing more heavily than his small exertions would seem to warrant
He seems exhausted
There is a  on the door
Miss Lebow enters, holding a filing envelope stuffed with papers
few things have been piling up
Would you like to go into them
guttural noise indicates yes
Miss Lebow pulls up a chair, opens her folder
quickie
Dr
Esterhazy wants to start hiring temporary people to cover the summer vacations
He says last year some of the replacement people didn't receive their checks until they waited six months
He wonders if you could do something about getting these people paid more promptly
She places a sheet of paper on the desk in front of Bock
He tries to give his attention to it
(drones on) Miss Aronovici complains the lab reports are coming in slow into the called Dr
Immelman about that, and she said three microscopes have been stolen out of her lab in the last two months
Charley Waters also complains about pilferage
've clumped all those together for you
(she lays a sheaf of memos in front of Bock, who stares at them blankly) Now, as you know, Doctor, we've agreed to take over the local ambulance cases as part of the hospital's commitment to the community, and it's created a serious overload in the
don't know why this was dumped in our lap, but
Bock obviously isn't up to all this
He waves a limp hand to stop Miss Lebow's morning report
(staring at his desktop) Find out if Dr
Einhorn is in his office yet
Which Dr
Einhorn
Ophthalmology or Psychiatry
Psychiatry
(suddenly stands) Never mind
'll look in myself
He lumbers across the room and out into
' and down past Miss McGuire, rattling away on her , and out into
,  , down past several closed doors, stopping at a door marked ,
He enters
' , ' secretary at her desk, sips coffee and reads a paperback novel
Is he in
The doctor is obviously in
He can be seen through the open door sitting at his desk writing in a notebook
Bock leans in
Can you give me a few minutes, Joe
(short, chunky, bespectacled, late fifties) Of course
Bock goes in, closes the door behind himself
' Bock looks only at the floor
(ill at ease) 've been having periods of acute depression recently
Apparently, it's becoming noticeable
number of people have remarked on it
Anyway, John Sundstrom thought it might be a good idea if  spoke to you about it
Do you want to sit down, Herb
No
'm not good at confessional
(he ambles around) Well, what can  tell you
The last year, two, three
it goes way back, suppose
can remember entertaining suicidal thoughts as a college student
At any rate, 've always found life demanding
'm an only child of lower-middle-class people
was the glory of my parents
My son the doctor
Well, you know was always top of my class
Scholarship to Harvard
The boy genius, the brilliant eccentric
Terrified of women, clumsy at sports
God, Joe, how the hell do  go about this
understand you just separated from your wife
left her a dozen times
She left me a dozen times
We stayed together through a process of attrition
Obviously sado-masochistic dependency
My home is hell
We've got a twenty- three-year-old boy  threw out of the house last year
shaggy-haired Maoist
don't know where he is, presumably building bombs in basements as an expression of his universal brotherhood
've got a seventeen- year-old daughter who's had two abortions in two years and got arrested last week at a rock festival for pushing drugs
They let her off
The typical affluent American family
don't mean to be facile about this
Indeed, he does not
He is horrified by the fact his eyes are wet and he is verging on tears
He turns away quickly
blame myself for those two useless young people
never exercised parental authority
'm no good at that
Oh, God, 'm no good at this either
Joe, let's just forget the whole thing
'm sorry  bothered you
He starts for the door
How serious are your suicidal speculations, Herb
(at the door) amuse myself with different ways of killing myself that don't look like suicide
wouldn't want to do my family out of the insurance
Digitalis will give you an arrhythmia
good toxologist would find traces
Potassium's much better
Sixty milli equivalent
Instantaneous
Of course, then you're stuck with how to get rid of the hypodermic
Forty milli equivalent
Gives you plenty of time to dispose of the evidence
You seem to have given considerable thought to the matter
You ought to know a man who talks about it all the time never does it
don't know
see a man who's exhausted, emotionally drained, riddled with guilt, and has been systematically stripping himself of his wife, children, friends, isolating himself from the world
Are you impotent
Intermittently
What does that mean
It means  haven't tried in so long, don't know
Let's just drop the whole thing, Joe
feel humiliated and stupid
All  have to do is pull myself together and get back into my work
'm sorry  troubled you
Take care of yourself
'll see you
Before Einhorn can say a word, he slips away and disappears into his own office
8:30
The score of protesters outside the pavilion still move in an uneven ellipse and shout: "Two -- Four
Help the Poor
" Ives, the bespectacled demonstrator who shouted at Sundstrom earlier, is removing his sandwich boards and giving them to his replacement
He hurries across the walk and into
, Ives cuts through the congestion of people and moves swiftly up the long corridor leading to the Farkis Building, unbuttoning his overcoat as he goes into
, and comes out, as the elevator opens
This is a laboratory floor, and the corridors are empty except for a white- uniformed orderly leaning against a wall and for one young woman in a white smock in the background, who waves to the young man before disappearing into one of the rooms
Ives fishes out a ring of keys and unlocks the door to his own lab
He enters into
, Dingy and cheerless place, as labs go
Ives hangs his coat in the cupboard, loosens his tie, unbuttons his suit jacket, squats on a stool, reaches over for a loose file on the work table, opens the file and begins to read the papers inside
door  open behind him, and without looking up, he waves briefly to whoever has entered
to of Ives frowning over his notes
We are suddenly conscious of a white-uniformed presence behind him
We know it's medical personnel, but we can't see the face
Ives starts to turn to the presence behind him, when suddenly a small hospital sandbag is whipped down on his head, and he slumps forward, his forehead thumping against the black surface of the lab table
: establishing the passing of hours
Sun high overhead, traffic on First Avenue an impenetrable river of and
At a crosswalk, a loose procession of fifty or so shouting demonstrators, bearing placards, flows toward the main gates
Their posters read: "  --
" "
" and " " which is what they now chant: "Save our kids
From the Skids
" The demonstration moves through a handful of city cops where our original group of twenty still ramble around, chanting: "Two -- Four
Help the Poor
" , The staff elevator doors open and Bock comes out, wearing his long white doctor's coat unbuttoned
Hanging about the Nurses' Station are Dr
Brubaker and a few young men in white
They come quickly to respectful attention at Bock's entrance
dominate the lunchtime atmosphere
All set
Yes, sir
The doctors move off toward the solarium on the east corridor overlooking the river
They pass a curious quartet of people consisting of a very handsome   in her late twenties in an out-of-fashion miniskirt (She has great legs, long and tanned
); an  , uncomfortable in city clothes and unmistakably an ; a tall overcoated man in his forties wearing a 's white collar; and a dressed in fashionable gray who is trying to persuade the young woman of something
The young woman and the Indian stand absolutely still, silent, impassive
The minister is more fidgety
(to Brubaker en passant) Who's that exotic group
(murmurs) You got me
They've been here about an hour
think they're with the old man in Eight--Six
Bock and Brubaker, trailed by young doctors, move into the room
Dr
Perry said he picked the tuberculosis and the liver nodes for today, right
Yes, sir
Good
Because that's the one  studied up
hell of a case
, Some twenty-five or thirty young doctors, two or three of them black, three or four of them women, fill the room
At Bock's entrance, they find places around the walls, sofas, soft chairs and benches
The  set has been pushed into a corner, and a large portable blackboard has been set up
This is the Chief of Service Round, attended by every available intern and resident
Somebody closes the door, just as two young doctors come hurrying in
All right, who's presenting
, People of all ages sit around on aluminum chairs arranged around the walls of the room
All are in streetclothes
Some speak to each other
line of people, extending into the hallway and holding their charts, waits for a lady from the accounting department taking Blue Cross numbers
This lady from accounting is
, late forties, bespectacled and testy
She calls out at large
Is there anybody seated who hasn't been to see me first
Is there anyone here who hasn't given me their health insurance number
Her phone
She picks it up
Emergency Room
Well,  don't know, Sybil
What's his name
To a man on line at her desk, thrusting his chart out to her
Would you wait a moment, please
'm on the phone, can't you see 'm on the phone
(rummaging through a stack of charts, large paper forms in quadruplicate) Of course not, do they ever
(hangs up, takes two charts from the desk, pushes through the waiting line) Would you mind, please
have to get through, do you mind
She makes her way to the door and goes out into
, which is congested
Mrs
Cushing enters
, (on phone) Give me that one again
thirty- two
Facing the desk are six curtained treatment rooms, mostly open to view
Behind the desk are a supply room and another treatment room
Both are occupied, the former by a wringing her hands in a paranoid rush and listened to by a very patient young intern
They follow me everywhere
Three big black men
Naked, completely exposed
Right in the street
Hanging down to their knees
Disgusting
They're waiting out there for me now
and in the other room, a man in his thirties is being treated for some sort of head lacerations
In one treatment room, the Chief of Emergency Service,
, a man in his late thirties, along with an intern, an anesthesiologist and a nurse, is bent over a naked and comatose young black woman of eighteen, covered somewhat with a sheet
She's a junkie, being intubated, i
e
a small endotracheal tube has been inserted into her mouth
This is the most melodramatic of the varied activity here
middle-aged man complaining of chest pains is lying clothed in another treatment room; a nurse attends him
An asthmatic middle-aged woman sits in still another room being administered her 500 mg
of amenophylene subcutaneously
The curtains on another room are drawn for privacy
On chairs in the corner sit a teenage boy with a badly sprained ankle and an elderly man bathing his hand in an enamel basin held in his lap
young mother with a five-year-old daughter with a badly cut arm is being attended to by the back wall
The Emergency Room Nursing Supervisor,  , a pretty woman in her mid-twenties, is sterilizing the little girl's wound
Mrs
Cushing makes her way to Miss Aronovici
They detest each other
Did you call upstairs and tell them to admit a patient named Mitgang
(continuing to treat the little girl) The concussion
don't know
They just called me
They said you didn't fill out the chart
And where do you come off sending anyone up to Admitting without my okay
Miss Aronovici turns to Mrs
Cushing, regarding her sweetly
Sally, would you get the fuck out of here
The patient's in the Holding Room
You want his Blue Cross number, you go in and you get his Blue Cross number
Mrs
Cushing elbows back through the line of patients waiting at the Admitting desk
Do you mind, please
There are now three nurses behind the desk, all of them on phones
One nurse calls to Dr
Spezio
wants to know how that asthmatic they sent down is
(just leaving the group around the junkie) She's fine
We'd like to keep her here a little while
Spezio heads for the door where he is intercepted by Mrs
Cushing
May  see you a moment, Doctor, if you don't mind
(sighs, calls back to the triage nurse) 'll be right back
He goes out, followed by Mrs
Cushing, into
, Spezio and Mrs
Cushing move between laundry and supply carts
(thrusting some papers at the doctor) If you don't mind, Doctor, is this your handwriting
Spezio stops, sighs, examines the paper
Am  supposed to read that
Was it a sprain
Was it a broken wrist can't read that scribbling
mean, have to bill these people
know you doctors are the ministering angels, and 'm just the bitch from the Accounting Department, but have my job to do too
mean, if you don't mind, Doctor
(studies the paper) The kid had a collar fracture
We had him in the
We reduced it and we gave him a small cast
He strides off
(calls after him) But did you give him a sling
You must have taken -rays
How am supposed to make up the charges
She turns into
, Designed to hold patients who've been examined and wait to be admitted to a room upstairs, it's in fact used for examination, treatment, storage
The room is quiet
Two male patients lie on comfortable stretchers, apparently sedated and resting
Mrs
Cushing turns to the patient immediately to her right as she enters
To the still figure she poses her questions
Are you Mitgang
She gets no answer from that bed
From another direction, a voice
'm Mitgang
She turns to Mitgang
Something bothers her about the first patient
She finds Mitgang's chart tucked in under his pillow, takes out her pencil
Do you carry Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Mr
Mitgang, if you don't mind
Mitgang, eyes closed, emits a sound
Do you have your card with you
(no answer) Do you know your number
Negative grunt from Mitgang
Mr
Mitgang, you're not leaving this room until  have this information
(enters for some chore) Will you leave that man alone
In a fit of temper, Mrs
Cushing throws the chart and her pencil down on the floor
(indicating the other patient) Do you mind if  at least ask this gentleman to fill out his chart
She pulls his chart from under his pillow, bends and retrieves her pencil from the floor, straightens
She speaks to the silent patient
May  have your
policy number, sir
No answer
on the patient
We now recognize him as the bespectacled young activist Dr
Ives, so recently coshed over the head with a sandbag
(looming) Do you carry Blue Cross
Blue Shield
Mrs
Cushing stares at the patient
He is not breathing
Behind her, the nurse exits carrying whatever she came for
Mrs
Cushing turns to her, but she is gone
Frowning, Mrs
Cushing backs out
as Dr
Spezio and others come down the corridor
(as Spezio approaches, with spiteful relish) think one of your patients in here is dead, Dr
Spezio
(enters the Holding Room) Why do you say that, Mrs
Cushing
Because he wouldn't give me his Blue Cross number, Dr
Spezio
Spezio regards the death mask of a face
Oh, Christ
He moves quickly forward to raise the dead man's eyelid
Behind him, a nurse enters
He wheels on her angrily
How the hell long has this man been lying here
Isn't this that doctor who came in around nine o'clock
'
2:00
, late thirties, lean, efficient but under constant strain, is having his daily staff luncheon conference, which consists of a  , the , three residents in administration, including Hitchcock, sandwiches and coffee
mean, they gave me a hard time, Con Ed
"For Pete's Sake,"  said, "this is a hospital
One of our feedlines just blew
" Mead's phone  and he picks it up
Yeah
(it's another annoyance; he sighs with irritation) mean, it's lucky we traced it in time
(on phone) No, 'll be right up
(hangs up, stands) Have we covered about everything
Dr
Kish has been driving me nuts with the
schedule
He's supposed to see me about that
He moves across his office into
' ' Actually a communal office with desks for three secretaries
' (looks up to Mead from talking on the phone) This is the Emergency Room
One of the doctors just died of a heart attack
(pauses) One of our staff
' think so
Mead frowns, leans back into his own office
(to Hitchcock) Tom, you want to go down to the Emergency Room
One of our doctors just died
What
Another one
Yeah, see what that's about
(en passant to secretary) 'll be on Holly Eight
'll be right back
, The staff elevator door opens, and Milton Mead comes out
He has apparently been buttonholed in the elevator by a woman in a doctor's coat,
, Pathology, who follows him out
It's no longer pilferage, Milton
It's reached the point of piracy
That's the third microscope this month
Why don't we get together on this sometime this afternoon, Fran
One o'clock
One o'clock will be fine
He turns left and heads for
,  , ' where Head Nurse Donovan is bent over her paperwork
In the background, we see normal morning hospital activity
Nurse's Aid,  , takes towels into a room
Felicia Chile comes out of another, bearing her enamel tray of instruments
Also in the background, the curious quartet from before -- the beautiful woman, the elderly Indian, the minister, Dr
Sutcliffe
Mead hardly notices them as he makes for the desk
(without pausing or looking up) Your brother's in the room, Mr
Mead
What room is it
Eight--Six
Mead bobs his head thank you and heads for the west corridor
, As Milton Mead enters, his elder brother,  , mid- forties, a smaller and manifestly nervous man, is seated sullenly puffing a cigar, fidgeting, still wearing his coat and hat
He looks up briefly when Milton enters and avoids his brother's eye
His wife, , late thirties, is standing in suppressed exasperation, staring out the window
Out of respect for the  , the ensuing agitated scene is held in whispers
For heaven's sake, Willie, you're going to be in the hospital for two lousy days
What're you making such a fuss about
You're supposed to be such a big wheel here
There are no private rooms available
If they brought in Jesus Christ fresh off the cross,  couldn't get Him a private room
'm not going to stay in a room with a dying man
He's not dying
They'll screen him off
You won't even know he's here
If you want a private room, go on home, and 'll call you the first one that comes up
But you're the one who phoned me in a panic, you're going on a vacation
For heaven's sake, Willie, they'll cut this polyp out tomorrow morning
You'll be home Thursday, you'll be in Miami Friday
Marilyn, will you talk some sense into this lunatic
Well, you said it, he's a lunatic
Big wheel, can't even get me a private room
'll get you a tranquilizer
He exits
, Bock -- excited, vivid, alive -- is in full flush with his lecture
He moves around in front of the blackboard, chalk in hand
The blackboard itself is scrawled with formulae and diagrams
He is writing the words "full abdomen," as the fifth in a list reading "(1) parexia, (2) hepatomegaly, (3) splenomegaly, (4) episodes of arthralgia
" The audience is forty young doctors rapt with attention
There is a good deal of note-taking
five, a full abdomen contrasted to wasting elsewhere; six, ascites with a protein content above four grams; unexplained anemia, leukopenia, unexplained elevation of the serum gamma globulin level, especially abnormal flocculation tests, and of course, a positive
All these findings assume special significance among Negroes
This has been a very commendable workup, as commendable a workup of an
as  can remember
The staff of this floor is to be applauded
(spots Brubaker among the others) It's a reportable case, Brubaker
Write it up
(a brief, rare smile) Well, let's go have a look at the girl
He rumbles toward the door
The class of doctors dissolves into hospital murmurs and mutters and a general dispersal
They follow Bock out to
, where Dr
Sutfcliffe, the beautiful young woman, the elderly Indian and the minister are engaged in agitated discussion
The girl and the Indian retain their stoic impassivity
Dr
Sutcliffe leaves them and moves down the corridor to the counter of
' Nurse
Nurse, who's the Senior Resident on this floor
That would be Dr
Brubaker
But 'm afraid he's at Chief of Service rounds right now
Sutcliffe points off right
That's
this way
The nurse nods indifferently
to Bock coming out of the  room, followed by some dozen young doctors
Bock is in very good spirits indeed
He quizzes his young doctors en route: wonder if there might not be some correlation between hepatic tuberculosis and drug addiction
Presumably, there was an early consideration of
(off-screen) Yes, sir
We discounted it after repeated blood cultures were negative
You, Ambler
Is that right, Ambler
Yes, sir
What else do you look for in bacterial endocarditis
(nervous) Some sort of embolic phenomena, sir
Good
(flagging Brubaker) Dr
Brubaker,  wonder if  could see you for a moment
Brubaker detaches himself from his group to join Sutcliffe
with Bock and his entourage, following them down the east corridor, Bock still happily conducting class
Bock strides into
819 Past two beds, they group around the foot of a third bed on the right side of the room
Bock checks the patient lying in the bed
Still a little icteric
Who's got an opthalmoscope
One of the young men hands his to Bock, who leans over the patient to look through it
Did anyone note Roth spots
The doctors exchange a look as Bock rises, moves toward them, laughing
Well, don't worry about it
There aren't any
Ambler, you're our big man on
What was the latex- fixation
It wasn't done, sir
Don't you think that's an important test to differentiate
from miliary
(off-screen) No, s
Not you, Biegelman
Ambler
Well, there's about a seventy percent incidence of false-positive latex in Bock hands the opthalmoscope to Ambler
You have been reading up
If the diagnosis were
, would a positive latex indicate anything in the therapy
We'd expect the latex to become negative
If
If the antibiotic therapy were successful
Are you applying for your internship here
'm not sure
Come and see me
(to the patient, helping her up) Would you sit up for a minute
Bock turns to the off-screen patient, helping her sit up and forward, percussing her back as the students look on
, Brubaker and Sutcliffe are now both involved in discussion with the woman, the Indian and the minister, as Bock drifts through the background, followed by the band of young doctors now dispersing
Bock crosses past the foreground group to the staff elevator
He pushes the button
Brubaker approaches Bock
They confer quietly in the hallway
We've got a little thing over here, Doctor
The girl over there is the daughter of the patient in Eight-- Six
He is at the moment comatose and requires intravenous feeding and meds
The elevator comes and goes, disgorging some, taking on others
Bock, who greeted Brubaker with a rare, benign smile, has begun to look a bit sodden
Poor Brubaker, aware of the gathering storm in Bock's demeanor, sighs and continues regardless
The thing is, the daughter wants to take the father out of the hospital and back to Mexico where they live
The patient's name is Drummond
He's apparently a Methodist missionary, and he and his daughter run some kind of religious mission among the Apache Indians
The daughter claims to be a licensed nurse, so she can give the necessary
treatment certainly don't think he should be let out of this hospital
The Attending -- he's the guy in gray over there -- concurs
Bock squints at Brubaker
All right, wait a minute
Let me have all that again
As a matter of fact, Doctor, this is Dr
Biegelman's case
Never mind the professional ethics, what happened
(sighs) don't know why 'm covering for that sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion anyway
(sighs and begins) The patient, a man of fifty-six, was admitted to the hospital ten days ago for a check-up, in good health, no visible distress
We did the mandatory work-up on him
Blood cultures, stool,
preps, chest, , all negative
But there was apparently some evidence of protein in his urine
don't know how that sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion ever found out about it
Maybe he had some kind of deal with one of the girls in the lab
Anyway, he turned up the next day, conned the patient into signing an authorization for a biopsy
What sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion
Some post-grad fellow named Ives
Elroy Ives
never met him
He's on one of the immunology research programs
Are you trying to tell me some post- grad fellow came up here and did a biopsy on the patient
Yes, sir
He conned Biegelman with that old story about
protein in the urine
Yes, sir
And he biopsied the man
And he nicked a vessel, and at two o'clock in the morning, they woke up Biegelman because the nurse found the patient in shock
Biegelman called the kidney people for a consult right away
What was there to see
The man was sour and bleeding
We spoke to this fellow Sutcliffe, and he referred us to a surgeon named Welbeck
Welbeck
That barber
You ain't heard nothing yet
So we finally got Welbeck around four in the morning
He said, go ahead
So they laid on the surgery for eight
Welbeck turns up, half-stoned, orders an
, clears him for allergies
without actually testing
Right
And the patient went into shock
and tubular necrosis
They lopped out the bleeding kidney, ran him back to the room, and we sat around waiting for three days to see how obstructed he was
Fever began spiking like hell, euremia, vomiting, so we arranged hemodialysis
He's putting out good water now
But some nurse goofed on his last treatment
leak in the tube, something
His blood pressure plunged
They ran him right up to
, checked out vital signs, all normal except he's comatose
That was two days ago
In short, a man came into this hospital in perfectly good health, and, in the space of one week, we chopped out one kidney, damaged the other, reduced him to coma and damn near killed him
Yes, sir
great sad serenity has settled over Bock
You know, Brubaker, last night  sat in my hotel room, reviewing the shambles of my life and contemplating suicide
Then  said "No, Bock, don't do it
You're a doctor, a healer
You're the Chief of Medicine at one of the great hospitals of the world
You're a necessary person
Your life is meaningful
" Then  came in this morning and find out one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses who mistook him for a patient because he screwed a technician from the nephrology lab
Hematology, sir
And now you come to me with this gothic horror story in which the entire machinery of modern medicine has apparently conspired to destroy one lousy patient
How am  to sustain my feeling of meaningfulness in the face of this
You know, Brubaker, if there was an oven around, 'd stick my head in it
What was the name of that sonofabitch from Farkis Pavilion again
Ives, sir
Elroy Ives
Somebody ought to ream his ass
The gathering storm erupts
Rage suffuses Bock's face
Out of respect for the hospital corridor and the people working around him and Brubaker, he keeps it glacial
But there is no mistaking the volcanic fury he feels
(barely containing himself) 'm going to ream his ass
And 'm going to break that barber Welbeck's back
'm going to defrock those two cannibals
They won't practice in my hospital, 'll tell you that
What'll  tell the girl, sir
She says we have no legal right to stop her from taking her father out
She's willing to sign an
form
Let him go
Before we kill him
The elevator door opens
couple of nurses come out
Bock strides in
, Bock advances in a cold fury down to his office
He wrenches the door open
' , Miss Lebow and Miss McGuire clatter away at typewriters
Sitting on a chair in the crowded office is a senior staff doctor, a man in his late forties, wearing a coat similar to Bock's
He is
He looks up from the magazine he's been leafing through as Bock storms in
Hi, Herb
Bock acknowledges him with a brusque nod, storms over to Miss Lebow
Get me Dr
Gilley
Put him on page if you have to
want to talk to him right now
don't care if he's operating
(wheels around to Miss McGuire) And you get me some monkey named Ives
Ives
---, first name Elroy
He's in the Farkis Pavilion
Herb
want to talk to you, Joe
Would you mind coming into my office
He strides, followed by Dr
Lagerman, into
' and slams the door shut behind him
Have you got some punk named Ives rotating in your department
Listen, Herb
(sits at his desk) also want to know what the hell kind of a dialysis room you're running
just came from
The phone
Bock seizes it
Yeah
Gilley
Put him on
Bock
Didn't you tell me a couple of months ago you were going to cut off all privileges for that assassin, Welbeck
Yeah
Wellbeck
He just butchered another one of my patients
Oh, come on, Harry
The man's a buccaneer
want him brought before the Medical Executive Committee
He's in your department, Harry, not mine
He's putatively a surgeon
'll be here
(slams receiver down, stares at Lagerman) Listen, Joe,  think you should know that you've got a research guy in your department named Ives who's been doing some very dubious biopsies
We're having enough trouble squeezing grants out of the Nixon administration
Ives is dead, Herb
That's why 'm here
This gives Bock pause
He blinks at Lagerman
What do you mean, Ives is dead
mean he's dead
He had a heart attack in the Emergency Room
He had a heart attack in the Emergency Room
Yeah
(blinking) What the hell is this
Some kind of plague
(stands) Where is he now
They were just taking him down to Pathology
,  , Bock, Lagerman and Hitchcock have gathered across the shrouded figure of Dr
Ives on a stretcher
We are in the lab section of Pathology; in the background, through the glass part of the door separating the lab from the surgery room, we can see the autopsy on Dr
Schaefer being performed
Schaefer's naked white cadaver is stretched out on an operating table
He has been opened up and all his vital organs are being excised
It's bloody
The autopsy is being performed by
, the Resident in Pathology, dressed in surgical scrub
and the next thing anybody knew, about three hours later, Mrs
Cushing from Accounting came in and said there was a dead man in the Holding Room
You don't find anything grotesque about all this
What do you mean
mean, at half past eight this morning, we meet over a doctor who's been killed intravenously, and here we are again, four hours later, with another doctor who had a heart attack in the Emergency Room
Well, what're you suggesting Doctor
Do you think we have a mad killer stalking the halls of the hospital
Presumably, Dr
Ives died of a heart attack and Schaefer in a diabetic coma
People do die of these things
It's all perhaps coincidental, but don't think 'd call it grotesque
How long are they going to be on Schaefer's post
He knocks on the glass window of the door separating the laboratory from the operating room
Dr
Brewster turns from his gory chore
Bock makes a gesture saying, "How much longer
" Brewster raises ten blood-drenched rubber-gloved fingers
Bock turns and shuffles across the lab for the door out
(pauses at door, to Lagerman) don't suppose you'd like to call next of kin
No thanks
(deeply depressed) Oh God,  need a drink
He goes down
and is soon lost in the normal traffic of the area
of
of
horror-film rainstorm lashes the vast dark complex of buildings
, Dark, empty, silent
One lonely light at the lobby end of the long, closed corridor of offices
The door to Bock's office stands ajar and issues a trace of light
' the silent, dark, typewriter-covered desks of the two secretaries through the doorway to Bock's private office, we can see Bock at his desk, lit by the desk lamp
He has a bottle of booze on his desk
He gets up from his desk
He has made a decision
, The corridors are silent; the night lights are on, subdued
Head Evening Nurse Mrs
Dunne is back at her desk, hunched over paperwork
Resident Brubaker passes by
, Nurse  , a black woman in her mid-twenties, has a porcelain tray on the shelf onto which she puts a small jar of alcohol, cotton swabs, a wrapped hypodermic needle and syringe
She moves out into
' where Mrs
Dunne looks up as she passes
Mead
Mrs
Dunne nods
Nurse Devine makes her way silently down the sleeping doors to
806 Dark, sleeping
The bathroom light is on, but only a thin stream of yellow light trickles through the door William Mead sleeps fitfully
The other patient is entirely curtained off
Nurse Devine sets her tray on Mead's bedtable, turns on the goose-neck lamp, keeping it from his eyes
She unwraps the hypodermic syringe, sets in the needle, draws the required dosage, reaches over and gently shakes Mead by the shoulder
(softly) Mr
Mead
Mr
Mead,  have an injection for you
Mead sleeps on
Expressionlessly, Nurse Devine extracts Mead's right arm from under the sheets, wets a swab with alcohol and rubs down the vein
The needle slides into Mead's vein
, we begin to hear a distant sibilant , indistinct like the leakage of a bad heart
There is also an occasional distinctly human but not quite civilized sound
to Nurse Devine withdrawing the needle, looking up, for she too has heard the soft, strange sounds
They emanate from behind the curtains of the other bed
Nurse Devine returns the syringe to the tray, gathers her things and pads silently around Mead's bed to Drummond's bed
With her free hand, she opens the curtains a little and stares in
What the hell is going on in there
'
: '
(   - ,         , ) The old Indian has stripped to the waist and marked his body with smears of dye and tule pollen
He wears a ceremonial hat, a sort of beaded beanie
He holds a small buckskin bag of pollen in his cupped palms and is facing north, east, south and west, offering the bag and prayers under his breath as he does
beaded amulet lies stretched across the white sheet covering the comatose Drummond
When Nurse Devine draws the curtains, Barbara frowns at Nurse Devine, holds a cautioning finger to her lips and draws the curtains closed again
Nurse Devine, carrying her porcelain tray, exits
, ' Bock comes out of the elevator, jacketed now, fairly drunk but holding it well
He heads for the Nurses' Station as Nurse Devine comes down the west corridor
Bock grunts at Mrs
Dunne and goes into
where he quickly runs his finger along the second shelf until he comes to the bottle of potassium which he filches off the shelf and slips into his pocket
He rummages through the drawers for a hypodermic syringe
Through the open doorway, we see Nurse Devine making her way swiftly up to Mrs
Dunne at the desk
Well, honey, we got a witch-doctor in Eight--Six, and you better go in there
You know that Indian that was sitting in Eight--Six all night
He's still there, and the girl's there, and they're doing some voodoo in there, and  ain't kidding
Behind Mrs
Dunne, Bock appears in the doorway to the pharmacy where he stands listening
(looking up) What are you talking about
mean that Indian's in there, half- naked and going pis-pis-pis with a little bag
You just better get in there, Mrs
Dunne
Mrs
Dunne, annoyed, gets up and heads for the west corridor, followed by Nurse Devine and by an intrigued Dr
Bock at a few paces behind
(to  , coming out of another room) You want to see somethin', baby
You jus' come here
As the small procession bears down, Barbara Drummond slips out of that room to intercept them
(keeping her voice low) Look, it's a perfectly harmless ceremony, nothing to get excited about
It'll be over in a few minutes anyway
Mr
Blacktree is a shaman who gets his power from the thunder, and it's imperative he conclude his rituals while the storm is still going on
Visiting hours were over at nine o'clock, Miss
Bock reaches for the door to the room
All that's going on in there, Doctor, is a simple Apache prayer for my father's recovery
Bock makes a vague noise, neither contradicting her nor assenting, and continues around her into
806 As Bock slides in, a bit of the corridor light comes in with him
The curtains have been left sufficiently open to reveal Mr
Blacktree
He is still stripped to the waist and marked with crosses of pollen
He extends two twigs to the four directions after which he places the twigs carefully on the white sheet covering Drummond in a pattern around the amulet already there
Behind Bock, Mrs
Dunne can be seen peeking in
The Indian is oblivious to both of them
Bock watches it all with interest for a moment and then backs out into
closing the door after him
The markings he's made on my father's arms are from the pollen of the tule plant
The twigs have no significance other than they've been struck by lightning and are consequently appeals to the spirit of lightning
It's all entirely harmless, a religious ceremony, not a medical one
You don't seriously believe all that mumbo-jumbo will cure him
On the other hand, it won't kill him, Doctor
They regard each other levelly
(grunts) Okay
Go ahead
He wheels and clumps off for the stairway exit
Thank you
Nurse Weitzenbaum opens the door of the room and peeks in
At the stairway exit, Bock pauses to look back at all the women in front of Room 806
Miss Drummond, are you still taking your father out
Yes
still have to arrange an ambulance service
Is there a phone around  could use
Use my office
Thank you
Bock exits
Barbara edges past Weitzenbaum, who is still peeking into the room
806 Barbara comes in, gathers her coat and purse from a chair and moves to the Indian, now occupied with what seems to be the rolling of a cigarette
The two exchange a brief dialogue in Apache
The old Indian nods
Barbara turns and exits, taking Nurse Weitzenbaum out with her and closing the door
The room is dark and hushed again
Blacktree lights his cigarette and "sends the smoke up," a ritual which consists of puffing smoke to each of the four directions, muttering in Apache "May all be well" after each puff
to the other bed where William Mead sleeps fitfully
The Apache words and pis-pis-pis penetrate Mead's drugged sleep
He opens one eyelid and stares glazedly at the dark air
The  persist
Blacktree chooses this moment to sidle out from behind the curtains and continue his ritual in the less-confined space at the head of Drummond's bed
It's quite a sight for a nervous, sedated man to wake to
Thunder  and the rain  and a sudden, savage  of lightning illuminates it all
Mead figures it's all a bad dream and, after a moment of dully regarding the odd spectacle, closes his one eye and goes back to sleep
' , Barbara Drummond comes in
Bock has apparently turned the lights on for her, but Bock himself is not immediately visible
She looks through the half-open door to Bock's private office, and there he is, staring blankly at the bottle
Barbara starts to say something, thinks better of it, lays down her coat, and looking around, spots a Manhattan classified directory which she hauls up from its shelf and sets on Miss Lebow's desk
She sits, quickly flips through the pages
Barbara flips through the directory
Bock is partially visible in the background at his desk
He sits soddenly
Barbara finds what she wants, opens her purse and takes out two airplane tickets
She dials
The  of the dial catches Bock's ear
He looks up for a moment
(on phone) Hello
'd like to arrange an ambulance for one-thirty tomorrow afternoon
Thank you
Bock at his desk with Barbara partially visible at Miss Lebow's desk
All he can see are her great long tanned legs
(in background on phone) Drummond, first name, Barbara
'll pay cash
Bock stands a little unsteadily and moves around his desk to get a better look at those legs
(on phone) No, you're to pick up my father, Drummond, Edward, at the Manhattan Medical Center, Holly Pavilion, Room Eight--Six
It's a stretcher case
presume you provide the stretcher
She senses Bock watching her, turns, smiles
She's a very beautiful girl
She returns to the phone
He's to be taken to American Airlines, Yes
No
Kennedy Airport, Flight Seven-Two-Nine to Yuma, Arizona
'll accompany the patient
Yes, thank you
She returns the receiver to its cradle
When she looks up again, Bock is no longer there
She returns the flight tickets to her purse, snaps it shut, stands and moves to the doorway, enters a step into
' Bock, back at his desk, looks up
You believe in witchcraft, Miss Drummond
believe in everything, Doctor
Like a drink
Yes
Bock drains his glass and pours her a hefty shot of bourbon
(from the door suddenly) My father, you should know, was a very successful doctor in Boston, a member of the Harvard Medical Faculty
He was a widower, and  was his only child
He was not an especially religious man, a sober Methodist
One evening, seven years ago, he attended a Pentecostal meeting in the commons rooms at Harvard and suddenly found himself speaking in tongues
(she takes her drink and crosses to the sofa) That is to say, he suddenly sank to his knees at the back of the room and began to talk fluently in a language which no one had ever heard before
This sort of thing happens frequently at Pentecostal meetings, and they began to happen regularly to my father
(she sits) It was not unusual to walk into our home and find my father sitting in his office, utterly serene and happily speaking to the air in this strange foreign tongue
was, at that time twenty years old and having my obligatory affair with a minority group, in my case a Hopi Indian, a post-graduate fellow at Harvard doing his doctorate in the aboriginal languages of the Southwest
One day, brought the Indian boy home just as my father was sinking to his knees in the entrance foyer in one of his trances
The Indian wheeled in his tracks and said, "Well, 'll be a sonofabitch
" You see, my father was speaking an Apache dialect, an obscure dialect at that, spoken only by a ragged band of unreconstructed Indians who had rejected the reservation and were living in total isolation in the Sierra Madre Mountains of northern Mexico
Well
What do you say to that, Dr
Bock
(who has been staring at her as if she were insane) What the hell am  supposed to say to that, Miss Drummond
Barbara throws back her head and roars with laughter
'm sitting here boozing and, all of a sudden, you start telling me some demented story about your father's religious conversion
No, no, you miss the point, Doctor
Not my father's conversion -- mine
You see,  had been hitting the acid pretty regularly at that time
had achieved a few minor sensory deformities, some suicidal despairs, but nothing as wild as fluency in an obscure Apache dialect
mean, like wow, man
mean, here was living afflatus right before my eyes
Within a week, my father had closed his Beacon Hill practice and set out to start a mission in the Mexican mountains
And  turned in my
card and my crash helmet and followed him
It was a disaster, at least for me
My father had received the revelation, not
He stood gaunt on a mountain slope and preached the apocalypse to solemnly amused Indians
masturbated a great deal
We lived in a grass wickiup and ate raw rabbit and crushed pinon nuts
It was hideous
Within two months,  was back in Boston, a hollow shell and dizzy with dengue, disenchanted with everything
turned to austerity, combed my hair tight and entered nursing school
became haggard, driven and had shamelessly incestuous dreams about my father
took up with some of the senior staff at the hospital
One of them, a portly psychiatrist, explained  was generated by an unresolved lust for my father
apparently cracked up
One day, they found me walking to work naked and screaming obscenities
There was talk of institutionalizing me, so  packed a bag and went back to my father in the Sierra Madre Mountains
've been there ever since
That's three years
My father is, of course, mad as a hatter
watch over him and have been curiously content
You see, Doctor,  believe in everything
She pauses, her story over
Throughout, Bock has been trying to keep his glowering eye on the desktop
During her long narrative, he once seized the bottle and took a swig
Mostly he is finding the experience murkily sensual
His glance keeps darting out from under his brows to surreptitiously look at the beautiful long tanned legs; or, when she bends for the drink she set on the floor, to peer down the flapping open scalloped neck of her dress; she is bra-less
She, on the other hand, has been crossing and uncrossing her legs, bending, stretching, so that her short dress has ridden up almost to her waist and is saved from utter exhibitionism only by the darkness of the shadows
She seems unaffected by Bock's voyeuristic interest in her, but she is surely not unaware of it
It is hard to believe she is not courting his attention
Now what was that all about, Miss Drummond
thought  was obvious as hell
'm trying to tell you  have a thing for middle-aged men
admire your candor
You've been admiring a lot more than that
Bock looks up, and they suddenly find their eyes locked
The dark, dense air in the room fairly steams with incipient sexuality
(looks down again) You're wasting your time
've been impotent for years
Rubbish
With a crash of his fist on the desktop, Bock stands; he is in a drunken rage
(lurches about) What the hell's wrong with being impotent
My God, you kids are more hung up on sex than the Victorians
've got a son, twenty-three
threw him out of the house last year
Pietistic little humbug
He preached universal love and despised everyone
He had a blanket contempt for the middle class, even its decencies
He detested my mother because she had petit bourgeois pride in her son the doctor
cannot tell you how brutishly he ignored that rather good old lady
When she died, he didn't even come to the funeral
He thought the chapel service an hypocrisy
His generation didn't live with lies, he told me
"Everybody lives with lies,"  said
grabbed him by his poncho, dragged him the full length of our seven-room despicably affluent middle-class apartment and flung him out
haven't seen him since
But do you know what he said to me as he stood there on that landing on the verge of tears
He shrieked at me: "You old fink
You can't even get it up anymore
" That was it, you see
That was his real revolution
It wasn't racism and the oppressed poor and the war in Vietnam
The ultimate American societal sickness was a limp dingus
Hah
(he lurches about, laughing rustily) My God, if there is a despised and misunderstood minority in this country, it's us poor impotent bastards
Well, 'm impotent and proud of it
Impotence is beautiful, baby
(he raises a militant fist) Power to the Impotent
Right on, baby
(smiling) Right on
(stares drunkenly at her) When  say impotent,  don't mean merely limp
Disagreeable as it may be for a woman, a man may sometimes lust for other things, something less transient than an erection, some sense of permanent worth
That's what medicine was for me, my reason for being
When  was thirty-four, Miss Drummond,  presented a paper before the annual convention of the Society of Clinical Investigation that pioneered the whole goddam field of immunology
breakthrough
'm in all the textbooks
happen to be an eminent man, Miss Drummond
And you want to know something, Miss Drummond
don't give a goddam
When  say 'm impotent,  mean 've lost even my desire for work, which is a hell of a lot more primal a passion than sex
've lost my raison d'etre, my purpose, the only thing ever truly loved
It's all rubbish anyway
Transplants, antibodies, we manufacture genes, we can produce birth ectogenetically, we can practically clone people like carrots, and half the kids in this ghetto haven't even been inoculated for polio
We have assembled the most enormous medical establishment ever conceived, and people are sicker than ever
We cure nothing
We heal nothing
The whole goddam wretched world is strangulating in front of our eyes
That's what  mean when say impotent
You don't know what the hell 'm talking about, do you
Of course,  do
'm tired, 'm terribly tired, Miss Drummond
And  hurt, and 've got nothing going for me anymore
Can you understand that
Yes, of course
Then can you understand that the only admissable matter left is death
He suspects he is going to cry and turns quickly away
He sits heavily and fights his tears
Sounds to me like a familiar case of morbid menopause
Oh Christ
Well, it's hard for me to take your despair very seriously, Doctor
You obviously enjoy it so much
Oh, bugger off
That's all  need now, clinical insights
Some cockamamie twenty-five-year-old
Twenty-seven
acidhead's going to reassure me about menopause now
Look, 'd like to be alone, so why don't you beat it
Close the door and turn off the lights on your way out
They are both suddenly conscious of a third presence in the room
They look to the door where Mr
Blacktree, fully clothed again and carrying his coat, is standing in the doorway
Barbara uncrosses her long legs and stands
(crossing to the door) Mr
Blacktree disapproves of my miniskirt, but it was the only thing had to come to the city with
Back at the tribe,  wear ankle-length buckskin
Swell
Just close the door and turn off the lights
Barbara regards his hunched form and, murmuring in Apache, she exits, closing the door
In the subsequent hush, thunder and
Wind sweeps the rain against the window panes
The sounds go unheeded by Bock, still as marble
Slowly, he raises his head and sighs and then fishes about in his jacket pockets to bring out the bottle of potassium and syringe
He takes off his jacket, rolling up his shirtsleeve, poking about for the vein
He removes his trouser belt, which he ties tightly about his upper arm for a tourniquet
Now, he tears the wrapping of the syringe and fits the needle to it
Fiddling about in the pockets of his jacket, he finally finds a crumpled pack of cigarettes
He lights one and returns to the business of killing himself, puffing expressionlessly as he does
Thunder  and rain
He carefully draws just the right amount of potassium from the bottle to the syringe, peering at the procedure against the light of his desk lamp
He sets the cigarette on the ashtray, switches the hypodermic to his right hand, holds his left arm rigidly out under the light of the lamp
' (off-screen) What're you shooting, Doc
He turns slowly to the doorway, his bare left arm still rigidly extended, the belt dangling, the hypodermic clenched in his other hand
Barbara is perfectly framed in the doorway
He stares at her, slowly suffusing with the numb, blind, total rage of the aborted suicide
The thunder
(barely gets the words out) Leave me alone
She approaches the desk affably, turns the potassium around to read the label
Potassium
You take enough of this stuff, it'll kill you, Doc
(moves toward the couch) It occurred to me that  might have read you wrong, that you really were suicidal
So  came back
Bock's rage erupts
He crashes the hypodermic syringe down, shattering it
The potassium puddles on the wood
(hysterical rage) Who the hell asked you
He moves around the desk, a shambling bear of a man, a leather belt dangling dementedly from his arm, tears coursing down his cheeks
He advances on her in a stuperous shuffle
Who the hell asked you
She regards his lumbering approach with a faint, grotesquely sensual smile
He reaches with his naked left arm to the neck of her dress and, with one savage wrench, rips her stark naked, sobbing through hysterical tears
Leave me alone
Why the hell don't you leave me alone
He is on her, crushing her down into the shadows of the couch, ravenous at her neck and shoulders in a brutish assault, sobbing
Why didn't you let me do it
Who the hell asked you
Throughout the scene,     through the flesh and fury to an  - of this terrified act of love
Then slowly over Bock's plunging shoulder to the woman's face
She gasps at the moment of penetration, then her lovely face slowly shapes into smiling serenity
Bock sobs; even in the shadows we can see the path of the tears on his cheek
,
4:00
The quiet, black streets glisten wetly in the puddles of lamplight
, The night shift is finishing up
,
, a high-strung girl in her early twenties, stands at a water tap holding a glass and popping some pills in her mouth
To the room: Well, 'll see you
Campanella comes out of the Dialysis room, puts on her coat and walks to
Campanella moves down the empty corridor
All the doors are closed now; only the overhead light in the background of the corridor glows weakly
Campanella puts a cigarette in her mouth, pauses to look for matches; she hasn't any
Scowling with annoyance, she continues to the lobby and stops by a partially visible white-jacketed figure reading a newspaper
Do you have a match, Doctor
She takes the matches, lights her cigarette, inhaling deeply, when he suddenly sandbags her from behind
She goes down
'
, Covered by Bock's overcoat, Barbara tosses and turns on the couch in a small nightmare
Through the windows comes the first gray wash of dawn
of Barbara, awake and up on one elbow on the verge of a scream
She looks around the room
It is dark, empty, silent
Barbara looking through the door to the secretarial office
It is likewise dark, but suddenly the lights go on and, a moment later, Bock enters
He holds a container of coffee in each hand and has something white draped over his forearm
From under Bock's bulky coat, Barbara watches him lumber to his desk, where he sets the containers of coffee down
He drops the whitish garment over the back of a chair and then sits
He hoists a bulging folder of correspondence from his filing tray and hunches to work, reading
After a moment, he regards the silent figure on the couch across the room
You wouldn't be awake
What time is it
He rises, picks up the second container and white dress from the chair
She reaches out an arm for the coffee
Bock holds up -- a nurse's uniform
swiped this for you out of the nurses' locker room
'll make good on your dress
'm afraid it's torn beyond repair
Buy yourself a new one or, if you like, give me your size and 'll send it on to you
But want to talk to you about that
Talk to me about what
About your father
You really shouldn't move him in his condition
just had a look at his chart
There's no reason to presume brain damage
You know as well as  you can't predict anything in these instances
He could pull out of that coma at any time
think you should let him stay here
'll personally look after him
He has perched on the edge of the couch, and she rests her cheek against the long, bent curve of his back, smiling
Is this your way of saying you'd like me to stay in town a few more days
He turns to look at her, smiles back
Well, that would be nice, too
She sips her coffee
What do you say, Miss Drummond
expect you can call me Barbara, considering you ravished me three times last night
Three times
Oh, look at him, pretending he didn't count
You were as puffed up as a toad about it
Punched a couple of holes in your crusade for universal impotence, didn't it
think we're on a first name basis by now
'll call you Herb
Let's give your father a week, Barbara, what do you say
(a frown darkens her face) No,  don't want my father in this hospital
had a dream about this hospital
(some of the terror shows on her face) dreamt this enormous starched white tile building suddenly erupted like a volcano, and all the patients, doctors, nurses, attendants, orderlies, the whole line staff, the food service people, the aged, the lame -- and you right in the middle -- were stampeding in one hideous screaming suicidal mass into the sea
(she stares at him wide-eyed, reliving the dream) 'm taking my father out of here -- and as quickly as  can
They stare at each other, she in terror, he with affection
You're a real fruitcake, you know
She sets her coffee down on the couch and decides to wear Bock's overcoat rather than use it as a cover
She searches for the sleeves
Bock assists her
Well, let me put it this way
love you
fancied you from the first moment you came lumbering down that hallway upstairs
said to Mr
Blacktree, "Who's that hulking bear of a man
" The Apaches are reverential about bears
They won't eat bear meat; they never skin bears
Bear is thought of as both benign and evil, but very strong power
Men with bear power are highly respected and are frequently said to be great healers
By now she's standing, the overcoat reaching her toes
She looks down at Bock perched on the couch
said to Mr
Blacktree, "That man gets his power from the bear
" Swell
Now, look, do you have a hotel, some sort of accommodations where you can stay for a week or so
Barbara reaches for her coffee, sips, moves around in her tent of a coat
All right, let me put it this way, Herb
My father and  accept the implacability of death
If he dies, he dies, but 'm taking him out of here and back to Mexico about one o'clock this afternoon
want you to come with us, because  love you and want children
'm afraid Mexico sounds a little too remote for me
We could use you down there, you know
There's a curiously high incidence of
And you'd be a doctor again, Herb
You'd be necessary again
If you love me,  don't see what other choice you have
What do you mean, if  love you raped you in a suicidal rage
How did we get to love and children all of a sudden
Oh, for heaven's sake, Herb,  ought to know if a man loves me or not
You must have told me half a hundred times last night you loved me
You murmured it, shouted it; one time, you opened the window and bellowed it out into the street
think those were more expressions of gratitude than love
Gratitude for what
Well, my God, for resurrecting feelings of life in me  thought dead
Well, my God, what do you think love is
Okay,  love you, and you love me
'm not about to argue with so relentless a romantic
Well, then, since we have this great passion going for us,  don't see why you won't stay on here in New York for a week or ten days
It's up to ten days now
As long as it takes for your father's condition to improve
No
've had these prophetic dreams for seven nights
Seven is a sinister number
The meaning of these dreams is very clear, seven times as clear
am to get my father and you out of this hospital before we are all destroyed
(throws up his hands) You're certifiable
My God, half the time you're a perfectly intelligent young woman, and then suddenly you turn into a goddam cabalist who believes in dreams, witchcraft and bear power
And  don't like the way you dismiss my whole life as unnecessary
do a lot of healing right here in Manhattan
don't have to go to Mexico for it
also teach
send out eighty doctors a year into the world, sometimes inspirited, at least competent
've built up one of the best damned departments of medicine in the world
We've got a hell of a heart unit here and a hell of a kidney group lot of people come into this hospital in big trouble, Miss Drummond, and go out better for the experience
So don't tell me how unnecessary  am
(who's been slipping into the nurse's uniform) Yeah
Yeah
So how come, eight hours ago, you were trying to kill yourself with an overdose of potassium
Where are you going now
This last in reference to Barbara crossing to the secretaries' office, zippering her uniform
' ' (gathering her coat and purse) My hotel
have to check out
Mr
Blacktree doesn't speak any English
(from the connecting doorway) Well, you're coming back, of course
Of course
have to settle the bill here and pack my father
And  think you need a few hours alone to make your decisions
What decisions
You're a very tired and very damaged man
You've had a hideous marriage and  assume a few tacky affairs along the way
You're understandably reluctant to get involved again
And, on top of that, here  am with the preposterous idea you throw everything up and go off with me to some barren mountains of Mexico
It sounds utterly mad,  know
On the other hand, you obviously find this world as desolate as  do
You did try to kill yourself last night
So that's it, Herb
Either me and the mountains or the bottle of potassium
'll be back in an hour or so
'll be in my father's room
She slips into her coat and exits, as Bock looks after her thoughtfully, then turns back to his own office
' He shuffles around distractedly, not knowing how to articulate the exuberance he feels
Suddenly, he opens the window, leans out and bellows to the empty air
All right
love you
(softly) My God
, construction sign fills the screen
It reads , , 1973

Suddenly, the sign comes crashing down into
It has been wrenched off the wooden fence protecting the row of tenements and brownstones being demolished
About a dozen young and loud militants have torn it down
to show the row of houses behind the fence, two of which have already been reduced to rubble; the others have been boarded up
The demolition generators and cranes are parked silently along the curb
In the dark of 5:00

Strong sun overhead
The street has been roped off, and police are all over the place
sparse crowd of a hundred or so throng the sidestreets off First Avenue
Signs read, "People Si, Doctors No

These buildings are condemned and unfit for habitation

'm asking you to come out peacefully
, small press conference is going on in a corner of the lobby
Reporters cluster, and  cameras surround the Press Representative of the Hospital, a young woman in her thirties named  , who is trying to read a statement, squinting under her mod glasses at the blaze of lights set up by the camera crews
(reading) complete sympathy with the tenants
So the hospital has assumed the responsibility of finding 400 housing units in good buildings
The hospital wishes to point out that this particular row of buildings on First Avenue was condemned by the City before the hospital acquired ownership, and even then, only after responsible leaders in the community had approved the building of our new drug rehabilitation center

He's in his fifties, gray, distinguished and very tanned with terribly, terribly kindly old country doctor eyes
He wears a camel hair topcoat
He smiles benignly and twinkles at Sundstrom from one of the leather chairs across the desk from the Director
(hardly notices Welbeck) And 'm not going to throw all that down the drain because some cockamamie activist group is show-boating for the television cameras
You get those people out of those buildings before a wall collapses or a fire breaks out and we've got a riot on our hands
Okay
He hangs up, sighs, turns to the man across the desk
(smiles, twinkles) Having your troubles, eh
Well, won't take much of your time
My name's Welbeck
've been associated with this hospital for six years, and, yesterday afternoon, Dr
Gilley called me to say he was cutting off my privileges at the hospital
Do you know anything about it
(glances at his watch) It's news to me
He said he sent the report on
'll probably get it tomorrow
Report on what
Well, 'm not sure myself
did a nephrectomy on a man about seven days ago
Emergency, called in at four in the morning
The man was hemorrhaging, he'd gone sour
Welbeck, 'm terribly sorry, but do have this meeting
(crosses to the door) In any event, there's nothing  can do about it
If Gilley wants to cut your privileges, he's Chief of Surgery, it's within his province
You'll have to have the hearing
He exits, followed by Welbeck into the

Phones ringing

Of course

It seems to me 've had your name down here before for something
(to his secretary en passant) 'll be in the staff room
He and Welbeck pass out into the
Flowing with a normal stream of traffic, Sundstrom and Welbeck turn right and head down to the last room of the corridor
Something comes to him, and Sundstrom pauses
Wait a minute
You're the fellow with the Medicaid collecting business who incorporated and went public, right
mean, something like that
Milton Mead was telling me about you just the other day
You're a whole medical conglomerate
You've got a Factoring service, a computerized billing company, and a few proprietary hospitals, a few nursing homes
Good heavens, Welbeck, you shouldn't be brought up before a committee of mere doctors
You should be investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
You'll have to go through with the hearing, Welbeck
don't interfere in these things
He opens the door of the staff room and strides in
Even before he enters, we get a blast of angry voices, both male and female
For the moment the door is ajar, we see a harried Milton Mead being assailed by angry blacks and Puerto Ricans and young white activist doctors
(all overlapping) no goddam halfway house, no way, baby
We ain't gonna wait 'til 1973 to deal with this problem
We want to kill the drug thing right now
imperializing the Blackaporican community, and we reject the bourgie- ass middle-class black traitors and flunkies who are selling out the Blackaporican proletariat masses to the expansionist, racist policies of this shit hospital
Let's get back to the abortion issue
Sit down, Woman
What the hell does the male establishment know about abortions
There's an agitated reaction in the crowd
Who the hell raised the issue of birth control
The issue at hand is the control of drug addiction in this community and in the ghetto generally

We don't want no goddam abortion
white doctor jumps in from the left
Let's
let's get down to the core of this matter
More murmuring
Che Guevara -- styled revolutionary moves toward Mead and Sundstrom at the table
The point is that this hospital is the landlord for those buildings and they should've turned them down
Angrily, he leans over the table facing Sundstrom
Those buildings are imperialistic extensions of the medical establishment
This hospital ought to be rebuilding those tenements, give those people decent housing
Sundstrom raises his hands for quiet and starts to rise
The hostile din has gotten to him
Please, please, please
, William Mead is transferred from his bed to a rolling stretcher by an orderly in shirt and trousers and by Nurse Felicia Chile
Nurse Chile tucks Mead in
He opens his eyes to look at her drowsily

hallucinated there was an Indian doing a war dance in here
(affably) You weren't hallucinating, Mr
Mead
There was an Indian in here last night
(staring through his sedation at her) There was
They wheel him out into
, Mead is wheeled down the corridor by the orderly
At the far end, an anesthetized patient, blue in the harsh light, fresh from surgery, is being wheeled into a recovery room
Surgery is busy and efficient but not as clinically tidy as we'd like
Linens and equipment and surgical gear are piled into corners or on empty stretchers
Green-uniformed nurses, doctors and orderlies go in and out of the many doors flanking the corridor
This is the non-sterilized area, where doctors and nurses confer in the corridors; three black orderlies await an assignment, sit on stretchers, chuckle, mutter
Phones can be heard
The orderly wheeling Mead turns left into the
, a small, cluttered central area with the office of the Operating Room Nursing Supervisor on the right and the Holding (for Anesthesia) Room on the left
The
is like the Emergency Ward, desperately busy but staffed by people grown so accustomed to it that they display a calm, almost casual but febrile efficiency
large blackboard faces the Supervisor's Office with the day's schedule of operations neatly chalked in
It is full
middle-aged surgeon, still in his overcoat, is studying the schedule
green-uniformed  swings through the glass doors from the Operating Room area to lean into the Supervisor's Office
Dr
Norris says about half an hour
Tell Shirley it was just an ovarian cyst
The   leans back into the Supervisor's Office to relay this information
Shirley, it was just an ovarian cyst
This is apparently good news, for we hear someone saying (off-screen) Oh, thank God
An orderly rumbles by with an
machine
Nursing Supervisor  , a pleasant lady in her late thirties, leans out of her office to speak to one of the lounging orderlies
(handing the orderly a slip) All right, Jerry, go up to Holly Six
The orderly detaches himself from his cronies and exits
It is into this atmosphere of subdued febrility that William Mead is wheeled
(to Mrs
Kimball) William Mead from Holly Eight
Hold him there, Tom
We've got somebody coming out right now
Indeed, a stretcher is being wheeled out of the Holding Room
The patient is sedated and covered
As the orderly wheels her past , we may recognize the pale, sleeping profile of Miss Campanella, the nurse who had been coshed with a sandbag not many scenes ago
comes through the glass doors, examines the chart dangling from the stretcher
(to this nurse) Who's that
Mangafranni
(checking wristband) Yeah
(to orderly) Number three, Marty
The orderly wheels the silent Miss Campanella off to Operating Room Three, as Dr
Welbeck, in his natty blue suit, carrying his camel coat, turns in from the outer corridor and examines the blackboard
He goes back to
Welbeck crosses, opens a door and enters
' All four walls are lined with lockers
Shelves and cartons of green surgical clothes, caps, masks, trousers, shoe- coverings
Obviously, surgeons dress for their operations here
Two surgeons, one middle-aged and the other a young , are changing
The resident turns to Welbeck on his entrance and says: It's legal for a doctor to incorporate in New York, isn't it, Doctor
(en route to phone) Since last September
If they had that when  was your age, 'd have put away a couple of million by now
(dials) It gives you a variety of deferral devices, profit-sharing for example
Let's say you pick yourself an October 31-fiscal
You declare a bonus payable in '71
An accrued item payable to a principle share-holder must be paid within two and half months after the close of the year to get the deduction in the prior year
But your corporation doesn't pay that tax, because we've eliminated the taxable income with the bonus
With two taxable entities, you can bury a hell of a lot of expenses
(on phone) Hello, this is Welbeck, any messages
Well, 'm at the hospital
have to cut open some guy in a couple of minutes
'll try to make it as fast as  can
How urgent did he say it was
Well, Dr
Hogan made those arrangements with the underwriters
The Registration Statement was filed with the
well over a year ago
If he calls again, have me paged here
(hangs up, turns back to the attentive young doctors to conduct his class in medical finance while changing into surgical scrub) The really big money is in health leasing, of course
Dr
Hogan, the eminent orthopedic surgeon, and incorporated a leasing company and went public last year
hold a controlling interest in a number of proprietary hospitals, nursing homes and rest farms, and 've been leasing hospital equipment to my own hospitals at excessive rates
Why, you ask, am draining my own hospitals
Well, my hospitals are taxed at 48 percent, and 'm giving my leasing company a hell of a price-earnings ratio, which'll balloon the market value of the stock
hold three hundred thousand shares of that stock, lettered of course, but in a year, 'll dump those shares at a capital gain and walk off with a bundle
Just like on  -- well, almost
The surgeon,
, a bad-tempered man in his fifties, sits on a stool with his gloved hands wrapped in a towel, waiting for the two surgical to finish painting the operable area, which happens to be the abdomen
It's a hysterectomy
The patient is sheeted except for the small square of abdominal area
Mangafranni, right
Right
(grumbles to one of the residents) What do you say, huh
We're not going to hang it in the Louvre, you know
The anesthesiologist,
, injects pentathol in the
tube
Bring a mask over
The   trundles over the oxygen tank, takes the hypodermic syringe from Dr
Chu, who now applies the oxygen mask to the enmarbled profile of the patient
He studies the gauges and equipment around him at the head of the operating table
There's no pulse, Doctor
What's the pressure
There's no blood pressure, Doctor
No pulse
Get the tube and
What's the matter
can't feel a thing, sir
The room galvanizes into the swift, silent activity of a chest massage
Dr
Mallory, standing and stretching in the back of the room, turns and moves toward the off-screen patient
He begins a vigorous rhythmic massage of the patient's rib cage over the heart
What the hell happened
Dr
Mallory thumps the patient's chest hard with his fist, and the others, likewise, go to work
don't know
She must have thrown an embolus
She was doing fine up to now
(to Resident Anesthesiologist) Did you check the gasses
did, sir
The only time  ever saw anybody conk out like this, some jerk switched the nitrous oxide and the gas lines
The scrub nurse is applying electrode paste to the defibrillators
Dr
Mallory yanks the sheets and hospital shirt off the patient and begins very rigorous massage of the exposed ribs; we can hear one rib crack
Get the damn leads on
For Chrissakes, what the hell is this
She's just a young woman, sir
Do you think we should open the chest
(defibrillating) She's fifty-three, you buttonhead
(off-screen) Bicarb
Dr
Chu, who has been inserting some suprel and bicarbonate into the tube of the patient's
, is frowning at her rigid, white-capped face
He leans over to check the
readings
She's fibrillating, Doctor
Mallory straddles the patient
He's doing heavy heart massage
Jesus
Christ
Okay, stop for a minute
Doctor
Dr
Chu pushes back, the operating cap on the patient's head, revealing jet-black hair
Mallory starts to massage again
(barking at the scrub nurse) You got those paddles ready
Dr
Chu stares blankly at the patient's face, then looks up at the sweating surgeon, perched on the operating table, rhythmically crushing away at the patient's rib cage
may be crazy, Doctor, but  don't think this is your patient
Dr
Mallory, now pausing for a moment, looks up
He is beaded with sweat
What the hell are you talking about
He massages away
Another rib cracks
, ' The Supervisor of Nurses, Mrs
Christie, is sitting on a chair reading a report
Bock, now in his doctor's coat, is hunched over his desk, hands clasped
Now,  don't want to get into an institutional hassle with you, Mrs
Christie
The malpractice here is monumental
As you see, Dr
Schaefer's blood sugar was twenty-three
No glucose solution is going to do that
The only thing that will do that is at least fifty units of insulin, probably more
The only presumption is that one of those nurses on the Eighth Floor shot fifty units of insulin into Schaefer's blood stream, either by injection or through the , although how in God's name
Mrs
Christie's electric pocket-pager
'm very sorry, Doctor
(reaches for a phone) May
Miss McGuire leans in from the secretaries' office
(to Bock) Doctor, did you ask the head nurse on the eighth floor to let you know when a Miss Drummond got there
Yes
Well, she just got there
Thank you
(on phone) Oh, dear me, Dorothy
better get right down there directly
Have you called the
And you better call Dr
Gilley
And you better call Mr
Sloan
Yes, 'll be down directly
(hangs up; to Bock) 'm very sorry, Doctor, but there's a real nasty one in the
They've just operated on the wrong patient
' Crowded now
The administrative resident, Hitchcock, is here and a uniformed man in his fifties,
, the Chief of Safety and Traffic
Sloan represents the Hospital's security force
Mrs
Kimball is at her desk, on the phone
(on phone) well,  don't understand, is she back in her room
When did she get back to her room
Who brought her back
(she stares at Hitchcock) She's back in her room
Who
Mrs
Mangafranni, the woman who was supposed to have been operated on
(calls to a nurse passing) Are they still working on that woman in Three
Yeah
(back on phone) 'm sorry, Mrs
Fried, would you say that again
Well, nobody in this office sent her back up
Well, all right, Mrs
Fried, 'll have to call you back
She hangs up, stands, goes out into
, where three orderlies lounge about
Did any of you take a woman named Mangafranni out of the Holding Room back up to Holly Five around ten o'clock
Apparently, none of these three
Mrs
Christie turns in from the outer corridor
Normal Operating Room activity flows by: patients wheeled to and from their various surgeries, surgeons checking the blackboard, staff doctors, orderlies keeping the noise level low but steady
(to Hitchcock in the doorway) What happened
Hitchcock shrugs helplessly
(to Mrs
Christie) don't know what happened
patient named Mangafranni was scheduled for a hysterectomy at ten o'clock -- Dr
Mallory
talked to Sylvia in the Holding Room who admitted her, so she was here
And now  just spoke to Mrs
Fried on Holly Five, and she says an orderly brought Mrs
Mangafranni back to her room about twenty minutes ago
Now Mrs
Mangafranni is in her room sleeping
Well, who's the woman in the operating room
don't know
Mrs
Kimball, Mrs
Christie, Hitchcock and Sloan push through the glass doors to the crossroads of the operating rooms
Through each window, we see operating crews hacking away
Is she dead
Well, they had to open her up, and that's not good
They gather in anticipation outside
Three and peer over each other's shoulders into the room where the operating crew is hunched over the open-heart massage
The masked circulating nurse looks up, notices the audience at the door, and gives a hopeless shrug
better get Mr
Mead
, Milton Mead is sitting in a back seat of the Staff Room -- a lounge with couches, easy chairs and magazine racks -- gives half an ear to the several opinions being simultaneously expressed by: ' abortion
The clinic should be under the supervision and entirely staffed by women and administered by a member of the Women's Committee for Medical Liberation
and by let's get to the core of the matter which is the criminal and gangster collusion between the American medical establishment and the drug, insurance and tobacco companies who, through their combined racketeering efforts, have produced a dual system of health care
Everything for the rich and nothing for the poor
and by abortion clinic
That's genocide, baby
You're just killing off blacks
We consider proliferation elemental to the class struggle
and by (who has lost his cool altogether and is screaming right along with everyone else) for God's sake
We've got eleven people in these buildings, and we've got to get them out of there
We can rectify the injustices of the world tomorrow, but right now, for God's sake, can we get those people out of those buildings
Will you people please listen to me
Will you people please shut up and listen to me
Will you people please call a halt to this participatory democracy and address ourselves to the immediate problem
During this maelstrom, the phone at Mead's elbow
Mead answers it, listens, nods, returns the receiver, stand and slips out of the room into the delicious silence of the
, where Hitchcock emerges from the Administration offices
The two men move down the hall toward each other
How long ago did this happen
About half an hour
Have you called the Medical Examiner
Not yet
Well, you'd better do that now
And you better call the precinct station house as well
Dr
Mallory is wrenching off his blood-drenched rubber gloves and flinging them to the floor in a rage
The door to the room opens, and Mrs
Kimball, Mrs
Christie and Mr
Sloan enter
Dr
Mallory is stupefied with anger
Dr
Chu, blessed with Eastern containment, blandly gathers his equipment together, nods to Mrs
Christie
Good morning
Good morning, Doctor
This is really something, isn't it
thought she looked a little different when they brought her in
even said to one of the nurses, "She looks a little younger without her dentures
" 'd only talked to her half an hour before
Does anybody know who she is
Dr
Mallory can only stare at her numbly
He turns and stares numbly at Mr
Sloan
(to Mrs
Kimball, examining the chart dangling from the operating table) What's her chart say
Her chart says Mangafranni
Her bracelet says Mangafranni
The only thing that isn't Mangafranni is the woman
Dr
Mallory finally explodes
Jesus
Christ
've been chopping out three uteruses a day for twenty years, and is it too much to expect for you people to bring in the right goddam Jesus Christ uterus
had just been talking to her in the Holding Room
She was perfectly fine
little drowsy
thought it was funny that when they brought her in, she was out cold
(shuffling around in aimless circles) Jesus
Kee-rist
Mrs
Christie stares down at the face of the dead patient on the table, who has had her chest spread wide open so that the organs are exposed
Well, we'll just all have to stay here until Mr
Mead or someone from the
comes back
Well, 'm not taking the rap for this
've already got one malpractice suit pending, and 'm not taking the rap for this one
, William Mead's bed is empty
The Reverend Drummond's suit, still on its hanger, is lying on it
Drummond himself lies comatose and rigged out with
s and catheters
Barbara Drummond is packing her father's things into an open one- suiter valise
The door opens
She looks up
It's Bock
They look at each other -- two people in love
Look, you're not going
love you, and 'm not going to let you go
He picks up the suit lying on the bed
Come on, let's start putting your father's things back
He's staying here
(hangs the suit in the closet) 'll find an apartment somewhere
'm staying in a filthy little hotel room
We can't use that
His eyes are caught by a white doctor's uniform hanging in the armoire along with the suits and overcoats of the two patients in the room
He bends over to peer at the nameplate over the breast pocket
can't make it here, Herb
'll crack up
cracked up once already
One week here, and 'd be running naked through the streets screaming again
can retain my sanity only in a simple society
For God's sake, Barbara, you can't seriously see me living in a grass shack hunting jackrabbits for dinner
Be sensible for God's sake
am being sensible
What is it you're so afraid of leaving here
Your plastic home
Your conditioned air
Your synthetic clothes
Your instant food
'm offering you green silence and solitude, the natural order of things
Mostly, 'm offering me think we're beautiful, Herb
(utterly in love) You make it sound almost plausible
don't know why you even hesitate
What's holding you here
Is it your wife
No, that's all over
suppose if 'm married to anything, it's this hospital
It's been my whole life just can't walk out on it as if it never mattered
'm middle-class
Among us middle-class, love doesn't triumph over all
Responsibility does
Herb, don't ask me to stay here with you, because  love you, and  will
And we'll both be destroyed
He turns to her again
They both look away
've got the bill here to pay yet
'll come with you
She gathers her raincoat and goes
Bock follows her out into the
,  , where Dr
Joseph Lagerman, Head of Nephrology, perhaps remembered from an earlier scene, has been waiting for Bock
He joins them en route to the elevators
Herb, you asked me to find that dialysis nurse
What dialysis nurse
Barbara has continued walking
Bock starts to follow her
'll go pay the bill
The one who goofed on your patient, Drummond
Bock turns back to Lagerman
Well, her name is Theresa Campanella, but you are not going to believe this, Herb
She died on the operating table in
Three about an hour ago
Barbara is disappearing into an elevator
Bock starts after her, then turns back to Lagerman
What do you mean, she died on the operating table in
Three
They hurry down the corridor to the elevators
You mean she was the one
That's the one
just identified her
What the hell's going on around here
Every time  try to find somebody in this hospital, they either died of a heart attack in Emergency or of anesthesia shock in an operating room
Elevator doors open
nurse and visitor get out
Bock and Lagerman go into
Two or three people besides the elevator operator are there, as well as a patient on a stretcher and an orderly
Listen,  just came from the
They're trying to find a Dr
Schaefer
Don't you have a kid named Schaefer in your service
(scowls, mutters) had a Schaefer
He died yesterday of an overdose of insulin
What do they want Schaefer for
The Holding Room nurse says there was a Dr
Schaefer hanging around the Holding Room
It wouldn't have been your Schaefer anyway
The nurse says it was senior staff, a middle- aged man
There's no senior staff named Schaefer in this hospital
told them that
said,  don't know any senior staff around here named Schaefer
They've got detectives down there, everything
It's a whole big investigation
The elevator stops at the seventh floor
The doors open and Bock and Lagerman stroll into
,  , Bock lumbers down the west corridor, turns into
806 William Mead, sedated and apparently zonked out cold, is being transferred from a stretcher back into bed by an
orderly and nurse's aid
Bock rolls back the curtains around Drummond's bed revealing the comatose patient, his face sculptured against the white pillow, an
tube in his right arm, a catheter projecting from under the sheet
Bock lowers the protective railing, leans in, takes the man's pulse on his neck, raises one closed eyelid, then the other
The pupils stare vacuously back at him; the eyelids drop closed as soon as they are released
In the background, the orderly and aid finish tucking in William Mead and exit, wheeling their creaking stretcher out
The room is shockingly silent
Bock goes to the window and frowns in thought
the patient Drummond, on Bock in the background at the window with his back to us
Suddenly, Drummond's eyes open
He lies rigid, his eyes staring dementedly into the air above him
Slowly, his left hand reaches out and carefully withdraws the catheter from his bladder, lays it on the white sheet beside him, and silently reaches over to withdraw the
needle from his right arm
He lets the needle dangle, dripping onto the bed
Carefully, he twists out from under his sheet, swings his legs over the side of the bed and sits up
Bock at the window, pondering
With a swift lash of movement, the double tubes of a stethoscope are whipped over his head and tightened around his throat
(mad as a hatter) am the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete of Caborca
of Bock being strangled, Drummond's face frozen in bland dementia behind him
' (off-screen) For heaven's sake, Dad
What the hell's going on
Drummond pauses in his strangling and, releasing the poor man altogether, turns to his daughter in the doorway
to include all three -- Bock recuperating; Drummond staring madly; and Barbara infuriated with her father
(annoyed) We all thought you were at Death's Door
What're you doing out of bed
Drummond, abashed, stands there, a scolded schoolboy, a rawboned figure in a hospital shift, a stethoscope dangling from his right hand
(to Bock) What happened
Did he say anything to you
(sufficiently recovered) As a matter of fact, he said, " am the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete of Caborca
" And you'd better close the door, because if he's going to tell everyone who walks in here he's the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete of Caborca, they'll put us all away
He's already killed two doctors and one nurse
am the wrath of the lamb and the angel of the bottomless pit
What do you mean he killed two doctors and a nurse
mean, he's killed two doctors and a nurse
And he just tried to kill me
He has something against doctors
Somehow he got hold of a thousand units of insulin and put it in Dr
Schaefer's intravenous solution
And somehow he got Dr
Ives to die of a heart attack in the middle of the Emergency Room
And somehow he got a dialysis nurse named Campanella to die of anesthesia shock on an operating table
(opens the closet, points to the white doctor's uniform hanging there) He's been running around the hospital wearing Dr
Schaefer's uniform
Right now, they're looking all over the place for this mysterious Dr
Schaefer
know this all sounds as grotesque to you as it does to me, but you can see for yourself your father is not the helpless comatose patient we thought he was
Don't look at me like 'm the one who's crazy
Ask your crazy father
was merely an instrument of God killed no one
They all three died by their own hands, ritual victims of their own institutions, murdered by irony, an eye for an eye, biblical retribution
Schaefer was first, you see, because he killed God
God was admitted to this hospital last Monday under the name of Guernsey
806
() cheerless, gray sunlight fills the room as the fragile, white-haired and bearded old Guernsey (whose admittance to the hospital was the opening scene of the film) is being helped into the room by Nurse Felicia Chile
She solicitously helps the wispy old man off with his coat and jacket and hat which she puts in the armoire
With palsied fingers, the little old man unknots his stringy tie and unbuttons the collar, which is three sizes too large
In the other bed, Drummond's eyes slowly open
(off-screen) was instantly aware of a divine presence
The old man is slipping out of his clothes to expose a thin little body in a torn nightshirt
(off-screen) was convinced this porcelain old man was, in fact, an Angel of the Lord
The old man sits back, wheezing a little
Nurse Chile smiles nicely at him and takes her leave
For a moment, Drummond lies rigidly on his bed, staring dully into the air and the old man sits with his hunched back to us
The room is silent except for his rheumy wheeze
(off-screen) perhaps even Christ Himself
After a moment, the old man rises and goes to the washbasin and, with some wheezing, spits into it
He shuffles back to bed
Dr
Schaefer comes into the room with a professional smile and the patient Guernsey's chart
(off-screen) Our Savior was, it seems, suffering from emphysema
Schaefer perches on the bed beside Guernsey and begins to take his history
(off-screen) He was relentlessly subjected to the benefits of modern medicine
He was misdiagnosed, mismedicated, and put into shock by Dr
Schaefer; raced off to Intensive Care, where the resident compounded the blunder and induced a coma
can tell you with authority that God is indeed dead
He died last Monday under the name of Guernsey
- of Drummond in deep shadow shows him sleeping
(off-screen) few hours later, he appeared to me in a revelation
806
, 7:00
The room is lit only by the yellow light from the half-opened bathroom door
Guernsey walks out of the shadows, hands raised
He shuffles to Drummond's bedside and looks down on him from his frail height
(softly) Rise up, Drummond
You are dead, now you are restored
Drummond's eyes open and roll to the direction of the voice
'
: Guernsey, dressed only in his hospital shift, is shuffling up and down the aisle of the room, hands clasped behind his back like a Mittel-European intellectual, head hunched forward -- a little old man with a white beard talking to himself
Those who killed you and those who killed me will die in our place
You are the Paraclete of Caborca, the wrath of the lamb
The angel of the bottomless pit
Guernsey closes his eyes in religious ecstacy
In this fashion has it been revealed to you
Drummond starts to sob and slowly sits up in his bed, imbued with belief
He looks mutely up at the frail old man, who now raises his right hand and his face is transfigured into vast majesty
(thunders out) The age is closed
The end is at hand
The seal is broken
So saying, he reverts to the little old man he was, wheezing a bit, and with some effort, climbs back on his bed and lies there, eyes closed
His thin, high nose projects from the whiteness of his face
He sighs the rattling last sigh of life and dies
slowly to - of Drummond lying motionless on his bed
His eyes are wide, glinting in the shadows, a man imbued
His cheeks are wet with tears of exaltation
(off-screen) Well
Not quite the burning bush perhaps but prodigal enough for me
was to avenge the death of God and my own brutalization
was to kill Doctors Schaefer, Ives and Welbeck and the dialysis nurse Miss Campanella, whose negligence caused my coma
of Drummond
He raises his left hand, flexing his fingers
Then he moves his other arm, his head, his shoulders
Obviously, he is regaining his faculties
(off-screen) awaited a further sign from God, which was given to me later that evening
Dr
Schaefer, it seems, had arranged an assignation with a girl from the hematology lab named Sheila
Drummond to the now empty other bed
All the lights are on
on Nurse Penny Canduso and an orderly wheeling away the wrapped body of Guernsey
Intern Schaefer, at the door, considers the empty bed with interest
Moving to the bedtable, he picks up the receiver of the phone
(on phone) Hey Sheila, this is Howard, Sheila
Hey listen,  got us a bed for tonight
real, honest-to-god bed
806 the scene originally played   where Dr
Schaefer and his girlfriend Sheila sneak into the room and undress
Giggles and shushings, gooses and fondles
Boy,  sure hope nobody walks in
During the replay, however, an additional segment is added
At one point, the girl, hanging her dress in the armoire, turns and holds something up
What's this in your pocket
That's my insulin
Put it back
What do you take insulin for
Diabetes
didn't know you were a diabetic
It ain't contagious, don't worry about it
They head for the unoccupied bed
- on Drummond's profile
806 Dark, hushed
Schaefer's girl is leaving; she tiptoes to the door, peeks out
Apparently, the coast is clear
She quickly slips out
806 Drummond on his chair
Barbara perched on one side of her father's bed, Bock on the other
William Mead sleeps on
And you put Schaefer's insulin into the
jar
Yes
And then a second nurse came and plugged the
jar into Schaefer
God clearly intended a measure of irony here
The hospital was to do all the killing for me
All  need do was arrange for the doctors to become patients in their own hospital
Accordingly, the next morning,  set out for Dr
Ives put on Dr
Schaefer's uniform, pinched some digoxine from the pharmacy and a sandbag from a utility cart, and found my way to Dr
Ives' laboratory
coshed him with the sandbag, gave him a massive shot of the digoxine
This, you see, brought on an instant condition of cardiac arrhythmia
When he came to,  brought him down to the Emergency Room
, The usual
crush and motion goes on in the background
Drummond escorts an obviously ill Dr
Ives to the Admitting Room
Drummond's voice under the narration explains matters to Miss Aronovici at the desk
This is Dr
Ives
He's in the Nephrology Lab
was in there a little while ago, and he was suddenly taken ill, and  thought 'd better get him over here right away
(off-screen) He had at that time perhaps an hour to live
Prompt treatment would have saved his life
They go into the
Ives, seated on a table in evident distress, breathes heavily
(voice-off) As a staff doctor, he was seen without preliminaries
An attendant takes his pulse, pressure and respiration
Ives collapses
(voice-off) His vital signs were taken, an electrocardiogram
across the Emergency Room to catch its state of contained febrility
Every curtained treatment room is occupied, including the storage room in the back
The triage nurse and a second nurse behind the desk are busy on the phones
The triage nurse takes the history of the first in a line of five people seeking admission even as she answers her phone
We watch Miss Aronovici and the other nurse and Dr
Spezio and his two interns, the two attendants -- all busy with one patient or another
(voice-off) which revealed occasional ventricular premature contractions
An intern took his history
Drummond, white-uniformed, standing in the back against the filing cabinets and linens, watching the the new patients trickle and crowd in
(voice-off) and then he was promptly
At the Admitting Desk, a  in his forties is being signed in by a uniformed cop
(voice-off) simply
forgotten to death
Simply mislaid
at the pageant of pain
(voice-off) mislaid among the broken wrists, the chest pains, scalp lacerations, the man whose fingers were crushed in a taxi door, the infant with the skin rash, the child swiped by a car, the old lady mugged in the subway, the derelict beaten by sailors, the teenage suicide, the paranoids, drunks, asthmatics, the rapes, the septic abortions, the overdosed addicts
, Looking to the street doors as two ambulance attendants, bearing a seventeen-year-old black girl on a stretcher, burst in
(shouting) Not breathing
Not breathing
They hurry into the Admitting Room past a nurse and into the
which is already galvanized into action
Miss Aronovici is at the girl's pulse even as she is being transferred to the bed that has just been cleared of Mr
Mitgang and his concussion case
(instructing attendant with Mitgang) Better put him in the Holding Room
(with the seventeen- year-old girl) She's taking a little pulse
(to triage nurse) Get an anesthesiologist, one-five- one-five
On screen we continue watching the scene of the overdose case treatment, as the live-action sound in the room fades behind Drummond's tale
(off-screen) the fractures, infarcts, hemorrhages, concussions, boils, abrasions, the colonic cancers, the cardiac arrests -- the whole wounded madhouse of our times
of Drummond staring at this ceaseless panorama of pain, tears streaking down his cheeks
' (off-screen) wonder if  could have a minute of your time, Doctor
Drummond turns to the voice
to include the man who had been brought into the
by a uniformed cop
am the fool for Christ and the Paraclete of Caborca
Well, it's an honor and a privilege, Doctor
've been here ten minutes, can't seem to get anybody to help me
'm suffering from some sort of amnesia
can't remember my name
As a matter of fact, it's pretty screwy
got mugged
Two hours ago, walking out of a coffee shop on Fifty- Seventh Street and Second Avenue, eight o'clock in the morning, broad daylight,  got mugged
sixteen- year-old girl walks up to me, shows me a knife about a yard long and says, "Give me your wallet
"  thought she was kidding
mean there's hundreds of people walking right by
Well, she wasn't kidding
"Listen," said, "all  got's about twenty bucks
" So she takes the wallet anyway
So  said, "How about leaving me my identification
"  mean,  had my driver's license, my Diner's Club, my credit cards
But she took them all, the whole damn wallet, credit cards, everything
So  stopped some guy,  said, "Hey, you see that girl there, walking away
" He says, "Yeah
" said, "She just stole my wallet, credit cards and everything
" He says, "Well, that's what they want, the credit cards
" So  started looking for a cop
mean, go find a cop, right
Well,  finally find a cop
The girl's halfway to South America by now, probably bought the ticket with my credit cards
So the cop says, "What's your name
" And you want to know something
couldn't think of my name
The girl took all my identification, you know what mean
She took all my credit cards
So  said, "You know this is screwy
can't think of my name
" So he took me to the station house
The sergeant says, "What's your name
" said, " don't know
She took all my credit cards
" So they took me down here
So what do you think, Doctor
'm nuts, right
finally flipped
to Drummond who stares at the Nameless Man
In  the door opens and Mrs
Cushing, the lady from accounting, enters
She calls out in her annoying voice from a chart
Who's number 7-6-8-0-2-
Is there anybody here who is that number
(off-screen) In this way was it revealed to me the manner of Nurse Campanella's death
She was to die of the great American plague -- vestigial identity
: 806 Drummond in his hospital shift, gaunt and mad as a prophet, sits rigidly on his chair
Barbara perches on her father's bed
Bock wanders disorientedly about the room, staring incredulously first at Barbara and then at her father
So last night,  coshed Miss Campanella with a sandbag, sedated her with thorazine, shaved her, prepped her, and parked her in a corridor of the -Ray Department for five hours
Why -Ray
Well, at -Ray, a sedated body lying around unattended for five hours wouldn't seem unusual
Of course
Her operation -- that is to say, Mrs
Mangafranni's operation -- was not scheduled until nine-thirty
So at nine-fifteen this morning,  rang for my nurse
You rang for your nurse
To insure one full hour of uninterrupted privacy
Oh yes
got up, wheeled Miss Campanella off to the operating rooms, replaced her bed with Mrs
Mangafranni's, exchanged charts and identity bracelets
She died officially of anesthesia shock
But, in point of fact, she died because she was wearing another woman's identity
(to Bock) God, what do we do now
Let me take him back to Mexico
It's a simple world there
If you turn him in, they'll just cage him in the Rockland State Hospital for the Criminally Insane
Let me take him back, Herb
Are you kidding
We'll both take him
'm going with you
Get him dressed
We're getting out of here before the police put us all in Rockland State
haven't finished my work here have this Welbeck to dispose of am the angel of the bottomless pit and the wrath of the lamb
Oh dear, he's having another revelation
Bock holds Drummond's coat and hat and crosses to take his arm
He finds the entranced Drummond as rigid as a statue
Look, that ambulance must be here by now
You go down and get them
'll give him a shot of something to knock him out
We'll take him to the airport in the ambulance
They both hurry out of the room
Drummond remains enmarbled in his trance
to William Mead, whose eyes now open; he has heard it all
In background, Drummond, suddenly released from his catatonic trance, heads for the armoire and extracts the white trousers of Dr
Schaefer's uniform
He puts them on, tucking in the tails of his hospital shift
He notices William Mead staring at him
You're hallucinating again
William Mead just stares at Drummond
, ' Bock and Barbara come hurrying around the corner from the west corridor
Barbara heads for the elevators
Bock heads for the Nurses' Station
The Eighth Floor is going about its normal 1:15
activity
Mrs
Donovan is at her desk on the phone
Edwards never showed up
'm short- staffed as hell
It's just me and Felicia
It's like Sunday
Nobody's here
'll be at lunch
nurse's aid, a bathrobed patient and two of his visitors stroll by
It's the end of the lunch hour, when the kitchen workers bring used trays back
Yeah, you gotta send me somebody
Oh yeah
Bock moves past Mrs
Donovan and into the pharmacy where we see him scouring the shelves for thorazine and a syringe
An elevator arrives, disgorging Milton Mead and his resident assistant, Thomas Hitchcock and, of all people, Dr
Richard Welbeck himself
Barbara and Dr
Biegelman go into the elevator
The doors close
Milton Mead and Hitchcock head for the west corridor
Welbeck, in his natty double-breasted suit and carrying his cashmere coat, heads straight for the Nurses' Station
We'll be in Eight--Six
(chuckles into phone) then what did she say
(to Mrs
Donovan) 'm Dr
Welbeck
have a patient on this floor named Drummond, and 'd like to see his chart
'll call you back
Bock immediately emerges from the pharmacy holding a bottle of thorazine and a wrapped hypodermic syringe
He scowls at Welbeck, who scowls back
Oh, Dr
Bock
Can  have a few minutes of your time, sir
No
He starts to pass Mrs
Donovan and would continue, but Welbeck lays a restraining hand on his arm
Dr
Gilley tells me you're the one who initiated these proceedings against me
'm busy, Welbeck
'd like to know what you have against me
You turned up half-stoned for a simple nephrectomy eight days ago, botched it, put the patient into failure and damn near killed him
Then, pausing only to send in your bill, you flew off on the wings of man to an island of sun in Montego Bay
This is the third time in two years we've had to patch up your patients; the other two died
You're greedy, unfeeling, inept, indifferent, self-inflating and unconscionably profitable
Aside from that,  have nothing against you
'm sure you play a hell of a game of golf
What else do you want to know
Welbeck's pocket-beeper
Excuse me for a moment, Doctor
(he reaches over the nurses' desk for a phone) This is Dr
Welbeck
Were you paging me
(regarding Bock with cold scorn) How much do you make a year, Bock
For a guy who makes a lousy forty, fifty grand
(on phone) Hello, Arthur,  understand you've been trying to reach me all morning
Bock turns and heads back for
, and down that through the kitchen workers and strolling patients to
806 which he enters
He is startled to find Milton Mead and Hitchcock leaning over William Mead, who is up on one elbow and in a state
'm telling you, Milton, he pulls out all the wires and the tubes, and he gets up and puts on a doctor's uniform, and he goes out, and he murders doctors
He just went out ten seconds before you came in
Indeed, there is no Drummond to be seen
His bed is empty
Bock nods to Milton Mead and Hitchcock, who nod back, and crosses quickly to look into the bathroom which is likewise empty
And 'll tell you something else about this crazy place you got here
There was a naked Indian in here last night doing a war dance
That's the kind of crazy place you're running here, Milton
You got to get me out of here, Milton
This is a crazy place, Milton
Milton Mead's pocket-beeper
Milton Mead reaches for the phone
(appealing to Bock) wake up last night, there's a goddam Indian in here, a naked Indian
What kind of hospital is this
(on phone) This is Mr
Mead, are you paging me
couple of hours later  wake up again, and the guy in that bed there is getting out of the bed
(to Hitchcock) Are the police still in the building
Yes
You'd better get them up here
Yes
All day long, he lays there like a dead man
All of a sudden, in the middle of the night, he gets out of bed
thought  was going crazy
(on phone) Yes, this is Mead
Oh, dear
When
You know what he says to me
He says, you're hallucinating
Listen,  just saw a naked Indian
Now, 'm seeing a ghost
got to figure he's right, 'm hallucinating, right
'll be down directly
(hangs up) Never rains but it pours
fire just broke out in one of those condemned buildings
The squatters in the building came out
The police tried to arrest them and, apparently, the situation has erupted into a riot
(to Bock as he heads for the door) 'm sure you're wondering what this is all about, Herb
You're not going to leave me alone in this crazy place, Milton
(at the door with Bock) Mr
Hitchcock is staying with you
(to Hitchcock) You better call the cops, Tom
Milton
Milton
Milton
The door slams
' Bock and Milton Mead stride up the corridor through the linen wagons and kitchen carts
haven't the time now, and 'm not even going to try to tell you this curious story my brother just told me
'll fill you in on it at lunch some time
He waves his hand helplessly to indicate the utter incredulity of it all
(rushes not to miss the elevator) Hold it
They reach an open elevator
Mead goes in, the doors close
The doors of a second elevator then open, and Barbara comes out
She and Bock stare at each other
In background, Welbeck is on the phone at the Nurses' Station
The ambulance is here
Yeah, but your father isn't
He's disappeared
He put on Schaefer's uniform and has gone out to do God's work, presumably the murder of Dr
Welbeck
Except, that fellow on the phone over there is Dr
Welbeck
(in background on phone) Oh my God, Arthur
What are you talking about
Have you talked to Dr
Hogan about this
And, on top of everything else, the other patient in your father's room overheard his whole confession and just told the Chief Administrator of the hospital
They're sending for the cops
Welbeck on phone at Nurses' Station
In the background, Bock and Barbara stare at him
(almost apoplectic on phone) Oh, my God, Arthur
Well, who held title
Do the underwriters know about this yet
Oh my God
Arthur, what're you waiting for
Arrest the son of a bitch
Turn him in
Oh my God
When
Of course, Arthur, call me right back
'm at the Holly Pavilion, Eighth Floor
Please
Right away
He hangs up
Are you all right, Welbeck
All right
That son of a bitch is trying to wipe me out
My partner, the eminent orthopedic surgeon, Dr
Noel Hogan, is a miserable thief
And he's trying to wipe me out
(extending a chart) Mr
Drummond's chart, Doctor
(angrily seizes the chart) What room is it
Eight--Six
'm expecting a phone call
Put it straight through to me in that room
He strides off angrily, followed by an anxious Bock and Barbara, for the
, Bock and Barbara hurry along in Welbeck's wake
The son of a bitch has been draining the company with phony purchase orders on another company, of which, it now turns out, his wife is the principal stockholder
Transparent fraud
'll send him up for twenty years
He wrenches open the door of 806, marches in, followed by Bock and Barbara
, Welbeck advances on William Mead's bed, since he is the only patient in the room
(Hitchcock is on the phone
) Well, Drummond, you don't seem that much the worse for the wear
William Mead stares dully at Welbeck
Then he looks dully at Bock
(to Hitchcock) Would you mind using some other phone
'm expecting an important call
What is this
Who
who is this guy
(on phone) Yes, well, 'll be at the Nurses' Desk, Sergeant
It would be futile for me to try to explain this to you over the phone
(leafing through Drummond's chart) You've got a bit of fever, Drummond, but you're coming along very well
'm not Drummond, you monkey
Drummond's the other bed
The phone now
Welbeck and Hitchcock both head for it
That's mine
(on phone) It's Welbeck here
Yes, Arthur, go ahead
William Mead is painfully trying to get off his bed
'm getting out of this nuthouse
(pushing him gently back) All right, take it easy, Mr
Mead
Hitchcock, satisfied the call is not for him, exits
came in here just to get a lousy polyp cut out
(on phone) Oh, my God, what do you mean
How many transactions were there
Bu
but Arthur,
borrowed against that stock
'm in the hole for over three hundred thousand
(appealing to the gods) 'm a sick man
'm supposed to have peace and quiet
(on phone and apoplectic) What do you mean, Brazil
just spoke to Hogan's office yesterday, and they just told me
The phone slips from his fingers
He turns to stare at Bock and Barbara
'm wiped out
The
has suspended trading in my stock
He keels over like a felled tree, falling face-up on Drummond's bed, his legs dangling to the floor
William Mead promptly hides his head under his sheet
Bock moves quickly to the prostrate Welbeck, feels his throat for the carotid pulse, pulls out his stethoscope, rips Welbeck's shirt open, and listens for heartsounds
He picks up the dangling telephone receiver, gets a dial tone
(on phone) Cardiac arrest, Holly Eight
Barbara strips off her coat
She is still in nurse's uniform
She leans into the hall and calls a passing nurse
We have an emergency here
(rips off Welbeck's natty jacket) Breathe him
Barbara helps Bock get Welbeck's dead weight onto the floor
On his knees, Bock straddles Welbeck's prone form, balls his fist and belts Welbeck on his chest
He begins intensive heart massage
Barbara gets down on her knees, opens Welbeck's mouth and commences mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
In the background, the
system blandly echoes: (off-screen) Holly Eight
Please clear all corridors
Mrs
Donovan and aides move
into the room, immediately followed by Intern Chandler rushing past them
Where's Biegelman
He went to lunch
Natch
Get that other bed out of here
William Mead, of course, is still huddled under his sheet
He peers out from under his covers in wide-eyed disbelief and ducks under again
Bock massages Welbeck's heart
Barbara continues mouth-to-mouth
Nurse Felicia Chile hurries in, pushing the emergency cart before her
(to Nurse Chile as others begin moving William Mead's bed out of the room) Give him an ambu bag and an airway
(off-screen) What's been happening
Nurse Chile has shunted the emergency cart aside to let the bed out and is extracting an ambu bag and tube from the cart's lower shelf
(to Seventh Floor Nursing Supervisor just outside door) Watch it
(off-screen) Holly Eight
Please clear all corridors
Nurse Chile hands the Berman airway and ambu bag to Barbara, who inserts the airway and the ambu tube into Welbeck's mouth and pumps in air by hand
Bock massages away
, Mrs
Donovan and Intern Chandler finally get Mead and his bed out into the corridor where they park it
In background, emergency activity on all sides
The resident cardiologist, , and anesthesiologist,
, both thirty-three, come hurtling around the corner
In here
Yeah
She follows Morse in as, from the lobby corner, two technicians come racing a max cart and an
stand before them
Behind them, a bewildered Hitchcock moves into view, trying to determine what's going on
(to Intern Chandler) Who is it
(off-screen) Dr
Robert Jackson
One of the patients had a cardiac arrest
Hitchcock looks down at the sheeted figure hunched on the bed parked in the hallway and slowly pulls the sheet off his head
William Mead stares up at him like a hunted animal
Hitchcock covers Mead's head again
806 Bock still massages, sweating bullets by now
Barbara works the ambu bag
Dr
Morse is feeling Welbeck's groin for his femoral pulse
What do you have, Dr
Bock
Total cardiac arrest
(off-screen) Dr
Rigby
Dr
Rigby
Dr
Lilac
How long has he been like this
About a minute
No pulse, no heartbeat, no respiration
If we can see anything of Welbeck through other bodies, we notice almost all his clothes have been ripped off his body
Dr
Loomis replaces Barbara
All right, 'll take over
The two nursing supervisors have been getting the max cart ready, snapping up the gateleg-footrest and attaching the tube to the oxygen jar, and that to the ambu bag
Endotrachial tube
(rushing in background with others) 'm sorry, Doctor, but we have another emergency in 823
Endotrachial tube
Shall we get him up on the cart
Yeah
Drs
Loomis, Bock and Morse struggle to lift the the nearly naked dead weight of Dr
Welbeck up from the floor and onto the max cart
Dr
Morse has picked up Drummond's chart from the bed where Welbeck had left it
All right, who is this patient
What's the story on this patient
- of Bock trying to hoist Welbeck and looking up slowly
Is this his chart, Dr
Bock
Bock cocks his head to him
What's his name
Drummond
Bock looks across to Barbara, now helping out at the max cart
She looks back at Bock
She shrugs
He shrugs
They exchange a smile
Yes, his name's Drummond
That's his chart
Straining under the effort, the three doctors get Welbeck off the floor
(studying the chart) Oh Christ, the poor son of a bitch just had a nephrectomy a week ago
Mrs
Donovan exits into
, as Mrs
Donovan comes out, Hitchcock turns to her
Was it Drummond
Who else would it be
Hitchcock silently thanks God
806 (off-screen) Pick him up
Put him on it
Stop the massage
Welbeck's body is finally on the max cart
Nurses and doctors converge on him
Dr
Loomis sets about intubating Welbeck, and the Nursing Supervisor begins clamping the metal bands of the
machine on each of Welbeck's extremities
While all this goes on, Bock and Barbara have picked up the remnants of Welbeck's jacket, trousers, shirt and underwear
Dr
Morse is squatting by the max-cart reading the
script as it rolls slowly out of the cart
Ventricular fibrillation
Get me the paddles
Push another amp of bicarb
The Nursing Supervisor starts applying electrode paste to the defibrillating paddles
Another nurse measures off an ampule of bicarbonate of soda which Dr
Loomis injects into the
tube
Set it for two hundred
Barbara unsnaps her father's valise and stuffs Welbeck's garments in it
Bock takes Welbeck's coat and piles Drummond's things on top of that
The Nursing Supervisor hands Dr
Morse the defibrillating paddles to place on Welbeck's left breast
(off-screen) That's two hundred
Everybody bock away
All back away from the max-cart
Bock and Barbara are at the window, piled up with valise and coats; they look like they're off for Europe
(off-screen) One-two-three
He pushes the defibrillating button, sending an electric shock through Welbeck's body so as to bounce it into the air
Bock and Barbara remain at the window with heart-resuscitation team in background
Barbara slips into her own coat, in preparation for escape
(in background) Did he convert
(in background) No, he's still fibrillating
(in background) Let's go to four hundred
(sotto voce to Bock) What do we do now
Bock is staring out the window
Barbara stares out with him
: looking down onto the -shaped drive of the entrance plaza of the hospital and First Avenue full of traffic
band of some fifty black and Puerto Rican youths, including females and young white revolutionaries, most in Che Guevara garb, have broken past the security guards at the gates and spill across the drive
Some policemen and security guards move tentatively out of the hospital to intercept them
The shouting can't be heard from up here
Off-screen we hear the activities of the resuscitation team
(off-screen) It's four hundred
(off-screen) Everybody back One-two-three
of the shock
(off-screen) That didn't work either
Low crowd noises
Bock looks out the window at the protesting mob below
(off-screen) All right
Let me have a c
c
of Adrenaline and intercardiac needle
over the melee in the plaza to the fence
Barbara and Bock stare down at the crowd
(off-screen) Stop the massage
Ventricular fibrillation
Put another amp of bicarb
Two hundred
into the maelstrom to   of the Reverend Drummond dressed in Schaefer's white uniform, standing on the slim island separating the uptown traffic from the downtown traffic
Drummond is a private island of his own, hands stretched to the skies
He is prophesying
(barely audible above the traffic rumbling heedlessly around him) Let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, for the age is closed, the season of the seventh seal is at hand
806 Bock and Barbara slip through doctors and nurses, heading for the door
Hang isopril, two in five hundred
Let's take one more crack with the paddles
Everybody back off the cart
Bock, carrying two overcoats, and Barbara, wearing hers and carrying her father's valise, exit into
, as Bock and Barbara come out, the activity is normal, with the exception of William Mead's bed along the wall
Hitchcock and two overcoated men are in the hallway, and Hitchcock hurries to Bock
Is he dead
They can't get him out of fib don't think he'll make it
Thank God
(sighs, turns to the two detectives) This should close the case, Sergeant
Bock and Barbara hurry toward the elevators
,  , The small army of militants and activists has broken through the security into the lobby
Their entrance is greeted by one small scream from a woman in the lobby
of the invading troop calls out
Everybody take it easy
Nobody's going to be hurt
We just want the Director
Others in the troop shout reassurances, but it doesn't really reassure anybody
The lady in the gift shop closes her door and locks up
People crowd in a solid block in the doorway to the coffee shop to see what's going on
From the long tunnels of corridors, nurses, doctors, administrative personnel pause in their chores and errands and missions to watch the tide of events in the lobby
, The exit door is wrenched open, and Bock comes hurtling into the carpeted executive corridor toward the lobby, and at that moment the troop of militants come rumbling in from the other end
Every door of the corridor fills with secretaries and administrators unsure of what's happening
Then, Sundstrom elbows his way through the clutch of secretaries in his doorway and comes into the corridor
He regards the militants moving down the corridor toward him
We want Sundstrom
We want Sundstrom
Community control
Community control
Hip-hip-Hippocrates
Up with service
Down with fees
You people want to see me
Yeah, baby, we want to see you
We're taking over this hospital, man
've had it up to here
'm not dealing with this kind of cheap blackmail
Now look, man
Now wait a minute there
We're looking for a hostage
Fourteen people just got arrested for doing
In the background, one of their fellow revolutionaries speaks up
Lookit, man, where's the  camera
but he's shut up by the Leader
Would you be cool, man
(now yelling) Fourteen people got arrested for doing nothing but living in their homes, which you people threw them out of
Right on
So now we're going to arrest you
We're going to hold you hostage and we ain't letting you go un
Ambler, the medical student we met during Bock's teaching rounds, pushes in front of the Leader to face Sundstrom
We, the members of the Doctors Liberation Committee indict this hospital for the criminal neglect of the community in which it is situated
We demand an immediate dissolution of the governing and executive boards
What are you going to do about those fourteen ghetto people
As the shouts continue, Sundstrom raises a hand to quiet the crowd
am not going to do anything
about anything
Yes, you are
By God, if you want to take over this hospital, you take it over
We will
Right on
You run it
am finished
quit
You run it
You pay the bills
You fight the city
We will
You fight the state
You fight the unions
You fight the community
You
you think you can do a better job, you do it
Now  am finished quit
It's all yours
Eyes filled with tears of rage, Sundstrom lowers his head and moves into the mass of militants, which parts for him to leave
Quit
Quit
The mass engulfs Sundstrom, moving back out into the lobby with him, pushing him, shoving him, humiliating him
of Bock watching it all from the far end of the corridor
He closes his eyes and the pain of watching all this shows on his face
He opens his eyes
The corridor is now silent and empty
He hurries to
, Bock rushes in, as the milling throng dissolves into the bystanders, security police and city cops
Common sense has settled in and the general tenor is to avoid any further trouble
We can hear the rhythmic patter of cops
All right, come on
come on -- Let's clear the area
-- Come on, let's clear this place
Keep cool
Everybody keep cool
Bock elbows his way through the throng as it drifts toward the doors to
, and goes through the gathering police
mobile  camera crew and a few reporters are hurrying up through the gates from First Avenue
The Reverend Drummond stands, a solitary human island, among the shrill  of the city
The protesters protest endlessly, ,
Absolutely no one pays any attention to the gaunt, doctor-clad sixty-year-old man standing on an island
Except, of course, for Bock, who must pause to wait for a red light
Bock hustles through the traffic to where Drummond stands
Let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, for the age is closed, the season of the seventh seal is at hand
The age is closed
The season of the seventh se
Dr
Welbeck is dead
They thought he was you
Yes,  know
We must arrange to have his body shipped to my Apache village where we will bury him with full tribal rites
In a day or two, somebody'll ask, "Whatever happened to Dr
Welbeck
" And it will be assumed he absconded to Brazil to join his partner, the eminent orthopedic surgeon, Dr
Noel Hogan
Welbeck, too, was mislaid, overlooked, forgotten to death, you see
The ambulance pulls up and Barbara gets out of it
(taking her father around to the back) We have to hurry, Dad
The light turns green
The traffic starts flowing around them, disjoined by the ambulance blocking one lane on each side of the dividing island
An ambulance attendant has opened the back doors to get Drummond in
Barbara hurries toward the front, climbs in, holds the door open for Bock
He stands a few paces back
'm not going
(he moves to the ambulance, closes the door) The hospital's coming apart
can't walk out on it when it's coming apart
Somebody has to be responsible, Barbara
Everybody's hitting the road, running to the hills, running away
Somebody's got to be responsible
(across Barbara to the driver) Kennedy Airport
You've got a two- thirty flight to make
He turns, and the ambulance pulls away
Bock goes back to the sidewalk where he meets Sundstrom, now wearing his coat
You going back in
Yeah
They make their way back toward
, The two physicians trudge across the -drive
(matter-of-factly) It's like pissing in the wind, right, Herb
Right
