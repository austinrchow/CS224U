Written by Andrew Niccol on the face of
Late-thirties, maybe the wrong side of forty, cigarette dangling from his fingers, wearing a conservative suit and tie
Black smoke wafts in front of his face
He speaks matter-of-factly, directly into camera
There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation
That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet
The only question is
(taking a draft and stubbing out the cigarette) how do we arm the other eleven
The camera zooms away from his face, revealing: Yuri alone on a battlefield surrounded by the charred carcasses of armored military vehicles and other equipment, discarded weapons and ammunition, desert floor stained with what appears to be blood
The faint sound of gunfire, some distance away, carries to us on the wind
: - - - Gunpowder is poured into a metal casing, lead slug mounted on top

perfect 39mm
- The  travels along a conveyor belt with thousands of identical siblings in a Ukrainian factory so grey it's monochrome
- The , picked up by a ham-fisted   , is tossed into a crate
- The , lying in its open crate, rolls down a chute where it's inspected by a    holding a manifest
He seems to stare directly at our

- The 's crate rattles around in an open-bed truck along an industrial road, passes a decapitated statue of

container door closes, plunging the bullet into darkness
- The door re-opens
The , still in its crate, now basks in bright, tropical sunshine, surrounded by an azure sea
- The crate is removed by a pair of slim, dark hands, revealing a glimpse of the bustling, weathered port of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast
The crate is one of dozens unloaded from the ship
- 's  from another open-air truck, now slogging through a mud-clogged road in lush rainforest
- The  is unloaded from the truck in Freetown, Sierra Leone - immediately grabbed by the young  of a  soldier
- The  is loaded into a 30-round magazine which is inserted into an -47 machine gun
- The  waits - in the gloomy chamber
Suddenly, from outside, the sound of raised voices and gunfire
- The  and its neighbors start to rise quickly up the magazine towards the chamber as the Kalashnikov is fired
- Our hero  is next
Will it see action
- Smack
The gun's bolt strieks the explosive cap, gunpowder ignited, the  driven out of the barrel
- Shed of its casing - now only a slug - the  emerges into bright sunshine
It is flying down the main street in Freetown
- The  gives us a perfect point-of-view of the bullet ahead of it
They are both flying towards their intended target - a wild- eyed  , a boy no more than twelve, firing an -47 almost as tall as he is
- The leading bullet narrowly misses, whistles past the boy's ear, striking the whitewashed wall behind - one more pock-mark in a building riddled with pock-marks
- Our , following close behind, finds its mark, slamming into the boy's forehead just above his left eye - his expression, oddly relieved
- The  carves through the lobes of the boy's brain where it is enveloped in blood, finally plunged into darkness - the bullet's final resting place

) was born Yuri Orlovitch in the city of Odessa in a country that no longer exists
You might have heard of it - a little place called the Soviet Union
sits in the shadow of a statue of Trotsky in the Soviet-style plaza, jacket and neckerchief removed in the summer heat, poring over a Communist text
Yuri approaches, pretends to be interested in the statue, glances to the Young Communist's book
(in subtitled Ukrainian, looking over the idealist's shoulder) All property is theft
The Young Communist nods at this kindred spirit
Yuri pats his comrade on the back, taking the opportunity to steal the boy's red neckerchief and Lenin pin
Now wearing the pin in his own jacket along with the neckerchief and a stern expression,  strides to the front of the line in the store
(
) Where  grew up, everyone was equal
Some were just more equal than others
The female   is about to order Yuri to the back of the line when Yuri flashes the pin
Intimidated, the Clerk smiles and pulls a special tray from under the counter
In contrast to the meager offerings on the shelves, the tray contains bags of sugar, coffee, bananas, even Pepsi

joins them, careful not to interrupt the broadcoast
He goes to pour himself a glass of vodka
Without looking away from the radio, his father's hand grasps Yuri's in a vice-like grip, preventing him from lifting the bottle
(impossibly upper-crust British accent) --Finally, in response to human rights protests and in an effort to encourage the United States to sell grain to the Soviet Union after two successive crop failures, it is reported that the politburo has consented to permit a limited number of Jews to emigrate from the Soviet Union to Israel
(beat) And that concludes this edition of news from the  World Service
Anatoly, deep in thought, switches off the radio
enters, puts Yuri's "feast" on the table
They speak Ukrainian, subtitled
(incredulous) Trading Jews for grain
(reaching for a banana) It's good

(shrugs) Good for the Jews
And us
All eyes to Yuri, family confused

(
) It was my first meeting with the American- educated Andre Roosevelt Baptiste
While the warning signs were all there, no one had any idea what a monster he would eventually become
certainly didn't think he would become my friend
Baptiste has a
document in front of him, awaiting his signature, clearly enjoying his moment in the sun
(referring to the meager pile of weapons) --With all due respect, Mr
Baptiste, you don't seriously expect us to believe that this represents your entire arsenal
Baptiste shrugs
(cont'd) This is making a nonsense of the embargo ratified by all five permanent members of the Security Council
The escalation in the build up of arms jeopardizes not only order in the region but ultimately world order
Baptiste smiles
(playing to the gallery) --World order
You say we jeopardize world order
Baptiste's Third Wife wipes his brow
(cant'd) Your idea of world order is when you're giving the orders to the world
The Envoy has no response
Baptiste rises from the table, leaving the unsigned document sitting there
(cant'd) Excuse me
Baptiste is accompanied by two armed

Baptiste stares Yuri down for a moment, then suddenly bursts into laughter
The also start to laugh - cautiously
Baptiste washes his hands, stares at Yuri in the mirror, smiles
You know you are fighting a losing battle, my young friend
War is nature
If you take away the guns, we will kill each other with knives
Take away the knives, we will kill each other with sticks
Take away the sticks, we will kill each other with your peace treaties
(turning to face Yuri) You cannot stop this bath of blood
It's not "bath of blood"
It's, "blood bath"
Thank you

The 83rd West African Peacekeeping Corp is proud to present, all the way from El Salvador, the newly crowned Miss World, Ava Cordova

She is obscenely beautiful in the squalid setting
The peacekeepers roar and whistle their approval

Standing closer to Yuri than necessary, despite the crush, is (attractive in her own right but pales in comparison with the Goddess on stage)
She catches Yuri's reaction

Take it off
Ava steps up to the microphone

berets) Baby blue
My favorite color
roar of approval from the men
(cant'd) suppose  could give you the speech about "my hope for world peace" but  have a feeling you don't want to hear that today

They roar again

Ava unfurls a life-size poster of herself in a swimsuit, flirtatiously holding it up against her body
She tosses other posters to eager hands
(cant'd) You're all doing a great job - keep it up
Enjoy the show
On stage, a generic-looking   starts to play a cover from the 80's - Tears For Fears' "Shout"
Ava dances enthusiastically, provocatively

He's tempted
He knocks back his drink
He approaches the girl - presses a few bills into her hand
She picks up her purse, makes to leave with him but he motions her to stay
(referring to the money) What's this
(explaining the tip) For the smile
Yuri exits alone
The Liberian Man, across the street, follows

walks down a poorly-lit sidestreet
He feels something in his back - stops abruptly
His hand reflexively goes to his holster
Empty
He turns
The young   is holding him up with his own gun

Money
You want money

Don't shoot
Don't shoot me
Fuck

The Liberian puts his finger to his lips to hush Yuri
The Liberian appears more interested in the gun than the hold-up

The Liberian produces a crisp
twenty dollar bill of his own, offers it to Yuri

What
Yuri stares at the money, bewildered
President Jackson
He shakes his head
No
(misinterpreting him) You are driving a hard bargain
He hands Yuri a second twenty
(flabbergasted) No, keep it
Keep the money
Keep the gun
(offended) What do you take me for - a thief
The Liberian stuffs the money in the pocket of the bewildered Yuri
Demand and supply
(referring to the gun) There is more  am thinking where this comes from
(incredulous) You want more Glocks
And the Heckler & Koch -3 assault rifle
What makes you think 'll do that
(quizzical) will come back and shoot you with the Glock
(checking the magazine, referring to the bullets) By the way, do you have the hollow point cartridges
Yuri stares at the man
(facetious, nodding to the gun) You got any color preference for that
(missing the sarcasm, regarding the gun) Kelly green
(meeting Yuri's eye) will find you
The Liberian walks away, still admiring his new weapon
Yuri stares after him

(kissing her nipple) Whatever you want
You know what  mean
Here, in this country

Vitaly looks at him blankly

He takes in the contents
(regarding his brother) It's a hell of a fucking career move
That's the point
've seen how the world's coming apart
And you want to help with that
You can't stop it
(warming to his theme) It's a basic human need - we eat, sleep, sleep with each other and what else
Fight
The oldest human skeletons have spearheads in their rib cages
Vitaly is still skeptical
What do you know about guns
(joking darkly) know which end 'd rather be on
(adopting a serious tone) Every day there are people shooting at each other
think to myself, what guns are they using
Why not mine
(hesitant) don't know
(pressing his argument) Vitaly, 've tasted your borscht, you're no fucking chef
can eat here for free and still don't eat here
You're doing nothing with your life
Maybe doing nothing's better than doing this

Yuri puts his arm around his brother's shoulder
That's why  need you

and  walk back along the shelled street, Yuri recounting what's left of the money
(irritated by the meager amount) This is bullshit money, Vit - small fucking potatoes
What do we do, go more legitimate
No
More illegal
Vitaly nods thoughtfully
What 'd give right now for a plate of red cabbage and potatoes
The wall explodes with gunfire
Yuri and Vitaly drop to the ground, money flying
The machine gun fire subsides, a shower of dust, fragments of brick and hundred dollar bills still floating to the ground
Vitaly, first to recover, draws his own handgun, sneaks a look through a shell hole

Yuri gasps for breath in the thin air
An   gives Yuri a hit of oxygen as Vitaly supervises the unloading
How's it going
(admiring a new gun) We're making terrific progress - most casualties from avalanches and frostbite
(uncertain smile) Make sure you thaw out the guns before you fight
Yuri nods, takes another hit of oxygen

The town is deserted
and  are confused as they prepare to unload an arms consignment from a truck
(
) We had our set-backs
It's not called gunrunning for nothing
Up the street, a celebration is taking place - a band, balloons, confetti, dancing
Finally, a Congolese man,  "" , appears at the warehouse
The conversation is in French
(from the boat) Cannibal, what's going on
Cease fire, man
Cease fire
It's over
What
What do you mean it's over
Truce
We're friends, man
(looking to his unopened crates, more and more agitated) Friends
You can't be fucking friends
Last week  spoke to you on the phone
You said you would not rest until every last rebel was dead
You called them vermin
You said would piss in their mouths, you said you would exterminate them like cockroaches
Just last week, you said this
(shrug) That was last week, man
Cannibal starts to walk away
Cannibal, don't you fucking walk away from me
Cannibal flashes Yuri a peace sign
Peace, man
Fuck you, Cannibal
Yuri looks to Vitaly
(referring to the truck) Maybe we can offload it - the Balkans

and  stand at a checkpoint in the rugged mountains
Guns and ammunition are strapped to donkeys tended by

) even shipped cargo to Afghanistan when they were still fighting fellow Russians
But  never sold to Osama bin Laden
Not for any moral grounds
Back then he was always bouncing checks

Orlov

There's a hundred thousand bullets here

) The freighter  was standing on carried 113 tons of weapons and ammunition for delivery to one of the poorest nations in Latin America in direct contravention of half a dozen international arms embargoes
Yuri makes a call on his cell phone
(
) To keep authorities in the dark,  often spoke in code
Rocket launchers were "mothers", the rockets "children"
Assault rifles were "apples"
The -47 was "the Angel King"
(into phone) The Angel King will arrive tomorrow
Hallelujah to you too
Yuri hangs up
His phone rings with an incoming call
(cont'd) (into phone) Yes
Slow the fuck down--what do you mean, tipped off
They know where we are
Where are they
Yuri grabs a pair of binoculars
On the horizon, a fast-approaching speed boat -   visible on the racer's deck
(cont'd) (hanging up) Forget it
and the , also spying the Customs Boat, join Yuri at the railing
Do we run
We have to get out of here
No, no-one's going anywhere
(to the Captain) Slow--dead slow
Buy me time
Yuri swings into action, frantically dials another number on his satellite cell phone
(cont'd) (barking an order to a , referring to the Panamanian flag) Get that fucking rag down
The  hastily complies
Yuri's call is answered
(cont'd) (trying not to sound too desperate) It's Yuri
need another handle for this tub
something in our weight class
(to an elderly Latin , pointing to the stern) You, over the side
(the painter hesitates) Now
The terrified  makes for the stern where he's hurriedly winched over
Yuri returns to the phone call
(cont'd) Yes, it's got to check out
you got a shorter name
what
--Kono
How do you spell that
---
That's good
He hangs up
(cont'd) (to the , already blacking out the name, ) Kono

The , nods nervously from his precarious perch, starts to paint
Yuri sneaks another look through his binoculars
The Customs Boat is closing fast
(cont'd) (back into phone) What are we flying
Dutch
Later
(hanging up, to Vitaly) Vit, get me a Dutch flag
Yuri checks the Customs Boat again
(cont'd) Damn, they're hauling
He checks the Painter's progress
(cont'd) (agitated, grasping the line of the scaffold) Faster
Or  send you in
(checking the binoculars again) Faster
and better
The Painter's hand is shaking
(
) (panicked) Yuri
Vitaly is frantically rummaging through a trunk containing dozens of national flags
(cant' d) don't have Dutch
What
've got Belgium
What the fuck use is that
(panicked, gesturing to the stern) He's painting a name registered in the fucking Netherlands
Vitaly winces
(cont'd) (mind racing) You got France
(confused, finding the tricolor) Yes, why
Turn it on its side
Vitaly turns the flag sideways - now a makeshift Dutch flag
Vitaly nods, impressed
Yuri looks forward
The Customs Boat has almost reached the bow of the freighter
The flag is hoisted
The Painter, barely completing the last "" of "", is hauled back on deck
(cont'd) That's it
Everybody look innocent--now
The  resume their normal duties as the Customs Boat slows to a crawl itself, at close quarters with the freighter
The heavily-armed   eyeball the rusted vessel
focuses on the senior agent -
While the other agents wear sunglasses, long hair, tattoo or personalized uniform, Valentine is completely by the book
His Interpol windbreaker clean and zipped to the neck
(
) They say every man has his price - but not every man gets it
Interpol Agent, Jack Valentine, couldn't be bought, at least not with money
For Jack, glory was the prize
The Customs Boat ominously circles the freighter like a hungry shark
never averts his eyes from the ship
Not exactly "The Love Boat"
Another  hands him a phone
(cont'd) (into phone) It's clean
It doesn't look clean
'm boarding
/
From the railing,  watches the Interpol boat draw alongside the freighter
He surreptitiously makes another phone call
(anxious whisper into phone) It's Yuri
Phone in a sighting of the Kristol south of Aruba
The boat is secured to the ladder that runs down the side of the freighter
checks his sidearm, climbs the ladder
-
Yuri spies a life ring emblazoned with the word ""
He flips it around as Valentine and the other agents board
Valentine strides past Yuri to a container, nods to an agent to open it
The large metal door opens to reveal a large container full of grain - grain spilling onto the deck
Valentine is about to plunge his hand into the grain when a mobile phone rings
calls to Valentine from the bridge of the Interpol boat
(referring to the phone) Sir, sighting of the Kristol due north
Valentine hesitates, returns to the ladder
As the agents go, they fail to see the pile of grain shift in the container exposing a crate of assault rifles hidden there
-
Yuri and Vitaly watch the Interpol boat leap away
On the , we focus on the terrified  standing beside Yuri - a pool of urine appears from the trouser leg
Yuri pretends not to notice, slaps the Painter on the back
Nice job
the word, ""
From the "", a paint drop runs down the stern
,
and  supervise the unloading of the freighter from the dockside
They are alerted by the sound of a battle raging somewhere on the outskirts of the docks
Jeep, full to overflowing with heavily-armed - suddenly appears at the far end of the dock and speeds towards them
military vehicle full of   chases the Guerrillas several hundred yards behind
The Jeep full of Guerrillas screeches to a stop by the freighter
The   grabs a box of unloaded ammunition
(in Spanish) Hey, pay before you play
(in Spanish) You're late
The Leader smashes the box on the concrete - bullets spilling everywhere
Hey, fuck you
(jamming his handgun in Vitaly's eye socket) Fuck you
Yuri tries to play peacemaker
(reasoning with the Narc Leader) No, you don't fuck him-- The Narc Leader turns and shoots Yuri in the side
Yuri shudders with the impact
The enraged Vitaly lunges towards the Leader but Yuri, despite his wound, holds him back
(cont'd) No, Vit
No
(to the Leader, referring to the bullets) Help yourselves
Free sample
Vitaly nurses Yuri to the ground
The  ignore them, frantically re-load just in time, immediately start shooting at the approaching government vehicle
The government vehicle throws a vicious 180, almost toppling over
The Guerillas, now back in business, take off after the government troops
Yuri lies on the dock, genuinely surprised by the sight of his own blood
(
) The first and most important rule of gunrunning is never get shot with your own merchandise
- ,
, now heavily bandaged around the waist, and  keep a watchful eye as the   inspects crates of machine guns and other ammunition
(
) The second rule is always ensure you have a foolproof way to get paid
Credit card, check, cash
Preferably in advance, ideally to an off-shore account
It's why  choose my customers so carefully
Say what you like about warlords and dictators, they tend to have a highly developed sense of order
They always pay their bills on time
The Narc Leader nods his approval
(referring to Yuri's wound) apologize for earlier
(slight wince) understand
start loading the crates into a truck
The Narc Leader hands Yuri the suitcase
It's all there
Yuri snaps open the suitcase - inside six kilos of cocaine
What is this
Six keys of pure
(incredulous) can't hand this to my fucking bank teller at Chase Manhattan
(hair-trigger temper flaring again) You should be thanking me
(waving his cell phone) Have you checked the street price today
With the seizures at the border last week, it's jumped thirty percent
sell guns
don't sell drugs
(shrug) Diversify
The Narc Leader walks away
(calling after him) 've got standards
The Narc Leader ignores him, climbs in his Jeep and drives off
The truck, loaded with munitions, also exits
Yuri and Vitaly are left alone in their warehouse
(staring at their "remuneration") Now what
Yuri shrugs, slices open one of the packs of cocaine
He takes a bill from his pocket, rolls it into a tube
He goes to hand Vitaly the tube but his brother has already rolled his own
Vitaly dips his tube into the coke - snorts, keeps snorting - a longer inhale than should be possible for a human being
- ,
Six kilo-sized coffee cans
, still bandaged, is pouring the coffee down the toilet and replacing it with the bags of cocaine, mumbling Ukrainian profanities as he works
The last bag is missing
(sighs, exasperated) Vit
In the hotel corridor,  discovers the door to the adjacent room wide open
Inside, the room is vacant
, clearly fuming, is standing in a standing-roam-only Bolivian public bus along with an assortment of ,  and On the wall of the bus Yuri notices a cellphone ad featuring (
) found Vitaly twelve days, two thousand miles and 150 grams later in a Bolivian boarding house

,
The outline of Ukraine drawn with cocaine
, out of his mind, pupils the size of nickels, humming a Ukrainian folk tune, is putting the finishing touches to the map from his badly depleted bag of cocaine
with him, two  , who appear to have passed out or worse
pounding on the door
(
) Vitaly
Open this fucking door
Vitaly, absorbed with the task at hand, appears not to notice
Yuri breaks in the door
(happy - way too happy) Yuri
(to the comatose prostitutes) It's my brother, Yuri
He's my big brother
Yuri stares at the cocaine map
What the fuck is that
Ukraine
(indicating the direction he is going to snort) start in Odessa, work my way to the Crimea-- (staring at the map, appalled) --You'll be fucking dead before you reach Kiev
Yuri opens a window, the cocaine blows off the table
You fuck
Vitaly freaks out, slams the window so hard it shatters
(The Hookers still don't rouse
) (cant'd) You fucking fuck
Vitaly desperately tries to snort the cocaine out of the shag pile carpet - the straw constantly clogging with carpet fibers
Blood oozes from Vitaly's nostril
Yuri gazes down at his pathetic brother
'
An exclusive rehab center
title appears: Upstate New York - 1989 's car pulls up outside, Vitaly in the passenger seat
Get out of the car
Vitaly doesn't budge
(cont'd) promised our parents
(desperate eyes) Please
Vitaly, you're going to have a good time
This is a top place
Two Ford models checked in last week and that cute weather girl's been here since July
Please
Yuri relents, pours a gram onto the dashboard
Vitaly snorts it off the dash
(as he wipes his nose) You're a good brother
Vitaly kisses Yuri
Two  open the car door, escort Vitaly away
Yuri watches his brother in the rearview mirror - shepherded up the path
(
) never understood what separated the recreational drug user from the habitual, the functional addict from the dysfunctional
But for the grace of God, it could have been me snorting lines as long as the Belt Parkway
-
lights a candle in front of the Virgin Mary
(
) Vitaly never got completely clean despite the prayers of my mother
-
prays in front of the menorah

) and father
In fact, my younger brother was the only reason my father ever had to question his new religion
An  sits in his Business Class seat
On the tray table in front of him, calculator and spreadsheets

) After Colombia  became a one-man-operation
sole proprietor as you say on your tax return - that is if you're foolish enough to fill one out
He exchanges a collegial smile with  who has similar entrepreneurial paraphernalia in front of him
(
) By then 'd mastered my craft
Selling arms is not so different to selling vacuum cleaners
You advertise, pound the pavement, take orders
The businessman's smile dissolves when he catches a glance at the brochure lying next to Yuri's "Day-Runner" - glossy photos of -
It takes place in an unidentified country in North Africa
(
) Of course, a good arms dealer also has to be a political scientist
go by a seven-step approach
gets off a plane
(
) One: identity a government and an opposition where the opposition is ignored
immediately picks up a newspaper, eager for the latest news
(
) Two: Wait for a radical group to break away from the opposition
is buoyed by the front page news, over-tips the (
) Three: Immediately approach the radical group and offer them arms
meets a group of  in a backstreet bar, shows them an arms catalogue
(
) Four: Whether they buy or not, inform the government that the radical group approached you and offer the government arms
meets a   in the parliament buildings, shows him the same catalogue
(
) Five: Whether they buy or not, re-approach the radical group and offer them more arms but now at a higher price
Increasing tension is a means of generating demand and the ideal situation is to sell to both sides
meets the  a second time in the same bar - this time they are more enthusiastic and Yuri has his calculator out

) Six: If they start shooting at each other, the escalation is underway

Back at the bar,  is given an even fatter envelope

) They are consuming small arms and ammunition and the cash register is well and truly ringing
stands at his hotel window, sneaking a look through grimy venetian blinds
street battle is taking place
However, in Yuri's mind the sound of the gunshots is gradually replaced by the sound ot a cash register
Each time a gun is fired, the register rings
Yuri shuts the window
(
) Seven: Don't forget that the success of a radical group in one country can inspire a radical group in a neighboring country
Yuri boards a plane, taking off for a new conflict zone
leans back in his Business Class seat - eyes closed
They suddenly blink open
He feels someone watching him
Sure enough, he is face-to-face with   - staring at him from a magazine cover in the seat pocket next to him

(cont'd) However, since you are willing to double her rate and pay cash in advance
She loves working with Herb and you say the campaign will only be seen in Asia
(examining a first class plane ticket Destination: St
Barts) certainly can't see her objecting to the location

An idyllic beachfront hotel

At least, that was the plan
But the photographer's plane got stuck in Miami
Hurricane - though there was nothing in the news

The job's cancelled and there's no flight back to New York 'til Tuesday
Yuri pretends to ponder her predicament
You can hitch a ride with me if you like
Ava regards him cautiously - likes what she sees
(cont'd) (picking up his own camera) In the meantime, why don't  take your picture
Ava smiles, poses playfully for him

) In my experience some of the most successful relationships are founded on lies and deceit
Since that's where they usually end up anyway, it's a logical place to start

) Luckily, by the time we landed, Ava wasn't looking anywhere but in my eyes

You must think me very rude
Don't apologize

(shrug) But  can't complain

(meeting his gaze) What about you
Nothing so glamorous
'm in transport - international air freight mostly
What, like  or something
Something like that
(glance to her champagne flute) Business is good
Like you,  can't complain
They both drink
thought occurs to Ava
But if you did
Well
don't know
(reluctant admission) It's just that  travel all around the world but  can't help feeling sometimes that 'm going nowhere
Ava regards him closely
He's echoed her thoughts
Yuri pours Ava another drink
(cont'd) Here's to

They toast
(cont'd) Without it, 'd never have met you
She meets his eye
This is no accident, is it, Yuri
Yuri freezes - doesn't answer
(cont'd) It feels like fate
(never averting his eyes) don't believe in fate
What do you believe in
Yuri gazes at her a moment - he answers her question with a kiss
Ava does not pull away
-
rush by the faces of  and , heads close to the plane's oval windows
They make love in a wall-to-wall bed built into the rear of the jet
The camera moves past the couple through one of the plane's windows, and the clouds begin to rain

Confetti
and  run through the paper shower as they descend the steps of a synagogue in Brighton Beach
(
) We married in a synagogue to make my father happy
In the eyes of my Catholic mother, it was worse than living in sin
Yuri and Ava kiss his parents,  and
As the happy couple reaches the limousine,  - out of rehab and out of his mind - fires an -47 into the air as a salute
The  drop to the ground - the only ones left standing are Yuri and Vitaly
Yuri stares daggers at Vitaly, helps Ava to her feet
(explaining to the guests) It's traditional
(meekly echoing the remark -joke badly misfired) Traditional
The guests nod, uncertain
(cant'd) One more time, Vitaly
Vitaly lets go another burst

Anatoly forces a smile
Irina presses a gift into Yuri's hand
(cont'd) Mom, we don't need anything
You need this
Irina takes Anatoly's arm, they walk away
Yuri, alone for a moment, opens the package - a small Roman Catholic Bible, conveniently bookmarked at the Ten Commandments
: newborn baby boy, , plays in the wrapping paper of opened gifts beneath an extravagantly-decorated Christmas tree
New York - December 25, 1991 (
) was still living way beyond my means, mortgaged to the hilt, using one credit card to payoff another
Anything to keep Ava in the style to which she had, thanks largely to me, become accustomed
Then suddenly all my Christmases came at once
family Christmas - Anatoly, Irina and Ava open gifts
Baby Nicolai wriggles on a blanket, trying to reach a piece of tinsel
(to Irina, regarding a nativity scene on a Christmas card) Jesus was Jewish
You're worshipping a Jew
Irina ignores him
She regards a gift - a silver goblet set from Tiffany's
Ava, this is too much
Yuri likes to spoil you
Nicolai crawls an inch
beams proudly
Nicki
You did it
Good boy
That's my grandson
Ava looks around for Yuri
(calling out) Yuri
Don't you want to see what your son is doing
No reply
Ava wraps the piece of tinsel around the baby's head
loud shout from the other room
(
) Tak
Tak
Tak-fucking-tak
(subtitle: Yes
) Ava scoops up the baby
With Anatoly and Irina, they go to investigate
On the television,  , is making his famous speech, officially ending the Cold War
Yuri kneels in front of the  as if it is an altar
What the hell's the matter
It's over
It's over
What's over
The Cold War, the Soviet Union, the Evil Empire
Mikhail's saying "no mas"
He's throwing in the towel
It's over
Yuri kisses Ava, Nicolai, Anatoly, Irina, kisses the
That's nice
(referring to Nicolai) Your son is crawling
Yuri's too busy kissing Gorbachev's birthmark
He gazes at the , revelling in the plan taking shape in his head
In the living room,  and  play with
and drink Johnnie Walker Black label
(contemplating the day's events) At least there'll be religious freedom
think 'll go back for a visit
(trying to sound casual) Do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri
(face lighting up) Dmitri Volkoff
Now and then
How is he
The luckiest man alive
You know he was one of the first men at Chernobyl
Off-duty, at his daughter's wedding, he was roaring drunk
He was the only one who survived
Later they found that alcohol in your blood resists radiation
He's still a General in the army
Major General
He got promoted
Two of his rivals were also there that day
told you - he's the luckiest man alive
He may be luckier than you think
Yuri goes to pour himself a drink
Anatoly grabs his son's hand the way he did many years earlier
(lowering his voice) We're not fools, Yuri
What's between you and your wife is your own business but  don't think you're going to Odessa to open a McDonald's
(meeting his son's eye) Is this how you want to be remembered
(shrug) You're only remembered when you're dead
Yuri knocks back his vodka, tries to lighten the mood
(cont'd) 'll bring you back some caviar
It's not kosher
crash
and a call-girl, , dressed in a low-cut fairy dress, stumble through the front door - both the worse for drink and drugs
Merry fucking Christmas
Angel laughs
The family gazes at Vitaly and his friend, appalled
(paternal) Vitaly, who is this
Angel
Her name really is Angel
She's a fairy
(hoisting Angel) Let's stick her on top of the Christmas tree
Vitaly and Angel laugh
No one else does
Vitaly collapses on the floor
Nicolai cries
(cont' d) (at a loss for anything better) love you all
Yuri firmly escorts Angel to the door and pays her off
'    -
drops  back at the exclusive rehab center
By now Yuri knows the routine
He pours a gram onto the dashboard
'm going back to Ukraine
Vitaly snorts it off the dash
(maudlin) miss Odessa
miss you
miss you too
Vitaly kisses Yuri
(cont'd) (meeting his brother's eye) Be careful, Yuri
Those things you sell, kill
(tapping Yuri's chest where his heart should be) inside
Two  open the car door, escort Vitaly away
Yuri stares after Vitaly
and  kiss  goodbye

The arms bazaar was open

How many Kalashnikovs do you have
(referring to the inventory in his hand) 40,000
(looking over Dmitri's shoulder) Is that a "4"
It doesn't look like a "4" to me
It looks more like a "1"
(missing the point) No, it's a "4"
It's whatever we say it is because no one else knows the difference
Dmitri finally gets it
Yuri examines a Kalashnikov
(cont'd) 10,000 Kalashnikovs for a battalion
Your stocks are dangerously depleted, Dmitri
You should order more from the factory
This is too much for Dmitri
He stops, confronts Yuri - takes back the -47 Yuri is inspecting
Someone will work this out, Yuri
What happens then
(shrug) We'll cut them in
Anyway, what could happen - you're the luckiest man alive
The sun sets over a grassy field
sits alone - closely inspects a Kalashnikov
It is a strange moment between a man and his favorite gun
As we hear Yuri's thoughts, we are treated to lovingly shot close ups of the weapon and its features often seen in slow motion:  Sun glistening off the chromed barrel
Folding metal stock arcing elegantly into place
Precise docking of the 30-round curved magazine
(
) Avtomat Kalashnikova, model of 1947 - more commonly known as the -47 or Kalashnikov
It's the world's most popular assault ritle - a weapon all fighters love
An elegantly simple nine pound amalgamation of forged steel and molded plastic
It doesn't break, jam or over-heat
It will shoot whether its covered in mud or filled with sand
It's so easy, even a child can use it
And they do
The Russians put the gun on a coin
Mozambique put it on their flag
Since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has become the Russian peoples' greatest export - after that comes vodka and suicidal novelists
One thing's for sure, no one was lining up to buy their cars
We reveal where Yuri is sitting - on the roof of a rusting Russian sedan, the Vaz 4-door
goat is eating the upholstery
Yuri checks on the crates of -47's being loaded into a convoy of trucks
In the background, the armory, full a week ago, is now virtually empty
Yuri smiles a satisfied smile
His reverie is interrupted by the sound of a car horn
commotion at the gate
Another large, black Mercedes is parked there,  leaning on the horn
smiles as he sees the passenger emerge from the car - (
) Of course my idea was not entirely unique

Simeon angrily confronts the  at the gate

The Bodyguards make to follow but the Soldiers close ranks, barring their path
Simeon fumes
(
) You're late, Simeon
breezes past the Soldiers with an easy familiarity
He enters the guard station as if he owns it
From beside his car, Simeon watches as Yuri jovially discusses the situation with the Young Officer
After a moment Yuri slips the Officer money in exchange for Simeon's passport
Yuri emerges from the station and returns the passport to the veteran gunrunner

Perhaps now you will accept my invitation

Yuri flirts with the  delivering drinks and a shellfish appetizer

can't deny, it takes some getting used to
Last week we were trying to beat their brains in and now we're going into business together
There's no place in gunrunning for politics anymore, Simeon
sell to leftists, rightists
'd sell to pacifists but they're not the most regular of customers
Yuri leans forward
(cont'd) Of course, you're not a true internationalist until you've supplied weapons to kill your own countrymen
Simeon regards the young man with a mixture of fear and admiration pours himself another drink
understand you have Ukraine in your pocket but there are the other satellite states
Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Belarus
Instead of cutting each other's throats, it may be more profitable to work together
What do you think
Yuri smiles - the proposal is the victory he has been seeking
think you are the amateur now
think you suffer from a philosophical disadvantage - you have a philosophy
think you should go with your instincts - your first instinct
Simeon is confused
(cont'd) am the same man who was not good enough for you before
am not good enough for you now
Simeon blanches
Yuri gets up
Simeon holds his rival's arm
The problem with gunrunners going to war is there's no shortage of ammunition
Yuri departs
-
and the  never make it to the bed
Still clothed, they bang each other against the door of his hotel room
(
) Back then, it was all for sale
Row after row of tanks, armored personnel carriers and helicopter gunships in mothballs
(
) Helicopters, torpedo boats, armored personnel carriers, whole tank divisions
, flask in hand, and  are given a tour of the surplus hardware by one of Dmitri's brother officers
(haggling over the gunships) --'ll tell you what 'll do
Buy six, you get one free
What about tech support
No problem
Yuri and Dmitri come upon an oily-faced , perched on the cockpit of a helicopter gunship - he wears an ill-fitting uniform, several sizes too big
Son, get off there before you get hurt
(sheepish) He's the tech support
(incredulous) He's twelve
Thirteen
Almost fourteen
(shrug) Kids grow up fast around here
(nodding to the gunship) He can take it apart in his sleep
Yuri shrugs, shakes the Major's hand
- in the crosshairs, , at a surprise checkpoint, staring through binoculars of his own
(
) Who are you
, on his belly to avoid detection, slithers back to the roadway - hands the binoculars to a
stands beside the convoy of trucks parked barely out of view of the checkpoint, including Yuri's Mercedes and a huge open-bed tractor-trailer carrying a Russian Hind helicopter gunship
(cont'd) (angrily to Dmitri) thought we were supposed to be watching for these checkpoints
How can
You keep selling my helicopters
You're too greedy, Yuri
(anxious) We have to go back
Dmitri regards the trucks, each one longer than the road is wide
We'll be going in reverse
We can't turn around for a mile
The   on lookout calls to them
They're coming
Yuri grabs the binoculars
Sure enough, Valentine and his agents are climbing into their Interpol Jeeps and driving towards them
We shoot it out
(shaking his head) And start an international fucking incident - no, no, no
So we run
No
've got paperwork
(protesting) Not for the gunship
Yuri, you know the penalty for sanction-busting - selling a military helicopter
Yuri gazes at the Russian Mi-24V helicopter gunship, bristling with armaments
It's not a military helicopter
It's a rescue helicopter
Yuri turns to the Boy referred to as "tech support"
(cant' d) Get to work, Son
The boy pulls a wrench from his pocket
The Interpol Jeeps crest the rise and pull in front of the convoy - and his agents exit, guns drawn
and the   stiffen, their weapons also at the ready
An uneasy stand-off
gestures for calm
He greets Valentine warmly - offers his hand
Yuri Orlov
In reply, an Interpol Agent unceremoniously slams Yuri into the side of his truck
(flashing ) Papers
Again Yuri waves off Dmitri and his men, about to come to his aid
Yuri courteously hands over his passport and other documentation to the skeptical Valentine
(cont'd) (regarding the photo closely) Mr
Orlov, always in the wrong place at the right time
We've met before
Off the coast of Colombia
(feigning memory loss) What was the name of that freighter - can't remember
Was it the Kono or the Kristol
(hesitates, he's actually forgotten) The crew called that vessel a lot of names - none of them repeatable in polite company
Valentine turns his attention to the helicopter - now devoid of its weapons
An Interpol Agent escorts Yuri at gunpoint
(cont'd) (noting to the gun in his ribs) The new -5
Do you need a silencer for that
Valentine ignores the banter, inspects Yuri's documentation
The end-user certificate for this aircraft states Burkina Faso
Nice
Did you type it yourself
It's for humanitarian missions
You're a humanitarian
Yuri shrugs - why not
(cont'd) (not buying it for a second) This is a killing machine
Not any more
(in broken English) Listen to the nephew
It's true
Yuri has had the armaments detached
Didn't you get the memo
The war's over
What can they do with military hardware but convert to civilian use
What, yes
(trying to lighten the mood) The only way you could die from this baby is if a food drop hits you
Valentine's face hardens at the flippant remark
Still at gunpoint, Yuri is escorted to the smaller second truck in the convoy
Stacked inside the container are the helicopter's hurriedly removed missiles and the Boy
(referring to the missiles) Also going to Burkina Faso
(pointing to the document) But to a different client at a different address
Valentine, incensed, throws Yuri up against the truck himself
What do you take me for
complete fucking fool
(eyeing Valentine's gun pressed to his throat) Not complete, Sir
And while  hesitate to tell you your job,  must point out that when shipped separately the weapons and the aircraft both comply with the current Interpol trade standards and practices
(incredulous) You expect me to believe this is a coincidence
can see how certain people might interpret it as suspicious but thank God we live in a world where suspicion alone does not constitute a crime
Valentine regards Yuri closely - this foe is more formidable than he imagined
Valentine looks to the gun in his hand, contemplating crossing the line
He finally holsters his gun
(tosses the documents on the road) Yuri Orlov
You and  are going to be seeing a lot of each other
can hardly wait
(climbing into his Jeep) Watch out for the time you don't see me
Yuri, Dmitri and the Boy watch Valentine speed away
(perfect American accent) What an asshole
Yuri looks to the boy, askance - a Yuri in the making
supervises the loading of the cargo onto a freighter
Checking the empty trucks, he is just in time to see  and his climb into their car, parked beside his own car, some distance away
As he drives off, Simeon and Yuri make brief eye-contact
Yuri looks for , exiting a nearby restroom - carrying his hip flask as usual, the worse for drink
(referring to the departing Simeon) What was he doing here
(zipping his pants) Trying to beat your offer
sent him on his way
He doesn't understand the concept of loyalty
Dmitri glances at the  around the docks
(cont'd) Speaking of loyalty, too many people know
have to make pay-offs
Don't worry
There're more 's
left them in your new car
Dmitri's face lights up
Yuri hands him the keys to the
Even your enemy was admiring that car
am the luckiest man alive
Dmitri hands his hip flask to Yuri
Yuri watches Dmitri walk to the car and climb in for a test drive
look of realization on Yuri's face
(screaming to Dmitri) Dmit--
The car erupts as if it has been punched by a fist beneath the earth
Recovered from the blast, Yuri runs up to the burning car but is beaten back by the flames
: a bent Mercedes medallion, now worn around the 's neck
He regards it forlornly
, numb, still carrying Dmitri's hip flask, makes a call from a payphone
-
darkened bedroom
is fast asleep in her bed, curled up with The phone rings
Half-asleep, Ava reaches for it
(still groggy) Yes, 'll accept the charges
We cut between the two sides of the conversation
Ava-- Hey, baby
(glancing to a clock - 3am) You forgotten what time it is
Sorry
, er
(talking about anything other than what's on his mind) How was your audition
(resigned smile) They're going in another direction
The direction of someone who can act
Don't say that
You're good
And you're biased
Ava grabs her robe - goes to the balcony so as not to disturb Nicolai
(sensing something amiss) Where are you
Is everything okay
Rough day at the office
Come home
We miss you
Soon
(more desperate than he intended) How's Nicki
Asleep in our bed
It's lonely without you
From a bar down the street comes the sound of gunfire - firing at other  escaping in a car
Yuri tries to cover the phone but Ava overhears
(cont'd) Yuri, what's that
party
It's always a party where you are
More gunfire interrupts
'd better go
just wanted to call--hear your voice
Kiss Nicki for me
love you
But Yuri has gone
The freighter slips out of the harbor
(
) In Ukraine since 1992, $32 billion worth of arms have been stolen and re-sold
One of the greatest heists of the 20th Century
-
Crates of munitions are unloaded from the freighter onto waiting trucks under 's supervision
(
) The primary market was Africa
Eleven major conflicts involving 32 countries in the past decade - a gunrunner's wet dream
Yuri sizes up the  loading the arms
(
) My best customer was self-declared president of Liberia, Andre Baptiste
Even though we'd met before,  was in no hurry to meet him again
He'd gotten a reputation for routinely hacking off the limbs of those who opposed him
His seven-year civil war has been described as "a relentless campaign of sadistic, wanton violence unimaginable to those unfamiliar with the details of man's capacity to visit the abyss
"  That kind of sums up Andy for me
As the final truck door is secured, a customized Lincoln Continental convertible comes flying around a corner - stereo blaring, deliberately terrorizing the locals on the dock
The car slides to a stop beside Yuri
It contains , a handsome young man with sunglasses, a mirror for an earring and a facial tattoo
Also in the car, two  and a pair of    dressed in Dallas Cowboy cheerleader uniforms
Mr
Yuri,  am Andre Baptiste Junior
My father would like to meet you
Thank him but  have other business
busy schedule
It is not optional
My father is easily offended
Yuri ponders for a moment
The machete in the Bodyguard's hand makes up his mind
What do you know
My schedule just freed up
bodyguard takes Yuri's suitcase
Yuri is barely in the car before it screeches away
As the car roars along the highway on the edge of control, we hear Yuri's thoughts
(
) But if  thought  was scared of Andre Senior,  knew  was scared of Andre Junior
Like father, like son
The guava doesn't fall too far from the tree
He was a heavy- drinker, a womanizer with a penchant for cheerleaders and a lover of fast American automobiles which he drove recklessly and with total impunity around the streets of the capital
Oh yes, he was also a cannibal
They say Andre would eat a victim's heart while it was still beating to give him superhuman strength
could've told him he'd get the same effect from a pastrami sandwich at Carnegie's Deli
Andre announces his arrival in the main street of Monrovia with a burst of gunfire
The city, a violent clash of cultures
Goats and Gucci
(
) Monrovia itself was like being on another planet
Planet Monrovia
From the temperature it was obviously a planet close to the sun
rarely saw another white man even at my hotel that was soon dubbed the "Little Kremlin"
And  never left town alone
Outside town, was the edge of hell
didn't want to even gaze into it
The car pulls up to Monrovia's premier hotel
on the ground attracts no attention whatsoever
This is your hotel
(proudly) Two stars
, carrying Yuri's suitcase, steps over the dead body
(cont'd) (to Yuri) Can you bring me the gun of Rambo
Part One, Two or Three
(confused) have only seen Part One
(nodding) The M60
You want the attachable grenade launcher
Please
And the armor piercing bullets
(revving the car) will be back to get you in an hour
or two
It's Liberia
(mischievous smile) We left a welcoming present in your room
Yuri nods, uncertainly
-
enters the hotel
At the reception desk, two   watch a small, portable -  coverage of the
Simpson trial - gruesome evidence photos
#1 (never averting his eyes from the screen) My God, he nearly cut off her head
#2 When  get to America,  will not live in Brentwood
The  hands Yuri a key
/
goes to open his hotel room door - hears music from inside, enters
Two stunning   sit naked on the bed bopping to Madonna's lILike  Prayer"
(
) In the most  infested region of the globe, where one in four is infected, Andre's idea of a joke was to put a young Iman and a young Naomi naked in my bed and no condom within a hundred miles
Hello, Mr
Yuri
We'd be happy to make you happy
The two goddesses drape themselves around him
Don't worry, we don't have anything
How do you know
Do we look like it
(fending them off but with little commitment) What if  have
Don't you worry
Gloria's lips gently touch his
You worry too much
Faith begins to unbutton his shirt
(sultry) Why worry about something that can kill you in ten years when there are so many things that can kill you today
Gloria's hands go to his belt buckle, start to unfasten it
How can we make you happy
With great reluctance Yuri reaches behind him and opens the door
By leaving

and , still buck-naked, are tossed into the hallway, their clothes flung after them, door slammed shut
'   -
Glock
45, Heckler & Koch
40 and a Beretta 9mm sitm on the ostentatious mahogany desk in front of President of Liberia,   - a few pounds heavier, still wearing the same size uniform
watches over his shoulder
Andre Baptiste examines each handgun methodically
In front of him, a pensive , taking in his surroundings
Half a dozen gun-toting   keep an idle watch
Several  tend to a refreshments table
On a nearby sofa, a  flirts with one of the hostesses
Baptiste glances over to the Lieutenant, irritated
(providing a commentary) --that's the Beretta, comes with a 36 cartridge, easy-operating clip-- Baptiste tests the loading mechanism
The Lieutenant on the sofa is still not paying attention
Baptiste casually points the gun at the Lieutenant and shoots him in the head - a large portion of his brain splattering across the fleur-de-lis wallpaper
(cont'd) (shocked) Jesus, why did you do that
Baptiste, clearly not used to having his actions questioned, turns the gun on Yuri
He's next
What did you say
Yuri, staring down the barrel of the Beretta, recovers fast
(feigning anger, gesturing at the gun) Now you're going to have to buy it
(grabbing the gun from Baptiste) It's a used gun
can't sell a used gun
Baptiste is taken aback
He suddenly bursts into laughter
used gun
That's a good one
The other Officers laugh uncertainly
The Lieutenant's body is dragged out - leaving a smear of blood across the marble floor
Baptiste, seemingly oblivious to the carnage he's wreaked, resumes talking to Yuri, in a measured way as if he's discussing the sad state of punctuality in contemporary society
(cant'd) (confiding in Yuri) There's no discipline with the young boys
try to set an example but it's difficult
blame the
Yuri nods, disguising his terror
Baptiste, checking his Rolex Oyster, rises from his desk
(cont'd) Let me show you something
'
The camera tracks along the  - however only the very tops of their heads are visible
(
) had heard of the "Boy Brigades", "Small Boy Units", "Kalashnikov Kids"
The theory was that a bullet coming from a fourteen year old is just as effective as one trom a forty year old
haggles with  as he inspects his troops ranging from twelve to fourteen
Yuri, averts his eyes from the boys, uncomfortable reviewing soldiers a head shorter than he
fill the ranks behind
can't pay your asking price, Yuri
We are not a rich people and the market is already flooded with your Kalashnikovs
In some places you can buy one for the price of a chicken
You can't just look at the unit price
You forget the ancillary costs
End user certificates need to be forged and notarized, shell companies set up, insurance purchased, pilots and crews hired
Not to mention the bribes
You can't get a nut and bolt out of the Eastern bloc without a bribe
There's one bribe for the nut
Another for the bolt
This is an expensive proposition
Andre interrogates Yuri's eyes
pay in timber
or stones
Baptiste produces a handful of uncut diamonds from his pocket
Yuri's eyes widen at the sight of the very precious stones
(regarding the stones) 'll take the stones
It's hard to get a tree trunk in my hand luggage
Andre smiles
He turns to his new Lieutenant
(referring to the inspection) Very professional, Lieutenant
(dismissing the troops) Dismissed
Yuri and Andre watch the troops disperse
know you're planning a new offensive
If you delay a week  can get you the armored personnel carriers we talked about
They would give you a significant strategic advantage
Andre nods, grateful for the free tactical advice - regards Yuri in a new light
They say  am the lord of war
But perhaps it is you
(correcting him) It's not "lord of war"
It's "warlord"
like it my way
Andre smiles again
They are going to be fast friends
He leaves Yuri alone to examine his uncut diamonds in his hand
(
) Diamonds are far less bulky than hundred- dollar bills
You can get a million dollars into a cigarette box
-
- emerges from a gallery with a wrapped painting, hands it to , waiting in a limo
(
) By the mid-nineties, my wealth had caught up to my lies about my wealth - even surpassed the lies
Yuri pays the Go-Between in cash, places the painting in the trunk
-
enters the front door, drops his luggage at the door
, talking excitedly on the phone, hangs up, runs to greet him
, in the background, cocktail in hand, with another dubious- looking , is examining another of Ava's paintings
Yuri,  just got off the phone with the dealer
sold my first painting
Yuri and Vitaly greet each other with a nod
(feigning surprise) Fantastic
Who bought it
Someone important
They want to remain anonymous
(asking in a way that does not expect an answer) How was your trip
You know
Same old, same old
(quickly changing the subject) Where's Nicki, in bed
'm sorry
Poor darling
He tried to stay up
'll kiss him goodnight
(opening champagne) This calls for a drink
What doesn't
(still giddy at the news) My first painting
'm officially an artist
He watches Ava showing off more of her paintings to Vitaly and the latest girlfriend
(
) figured  was a patron of the arts and of everything else Ava had tried and failed at after modelling
Acting, her own cosmetics line
didn't sabotage her careers but can't deny it was convenient for me in maintaining a low profile
She was a beautiful bird in a gilded cage
-
kisses his sleeping son, , now three years old
He places a gift at the end of his bed - an expensive-looking microscope
At the same time he spies an object in Nicolai's toy box - a toy gun
/   -
tosses the toy gun in the trash
, still in the kitchen, catches him - pretends he didn't see
How are you, brother
(shrug) You know, still the resident family fuck-up
Someone has to do it
They watch Ava in the living room sharing a joke with Vitaly's girlfriend
She knows, right
We don't talk about it
Vitaly looks askance
(cont'd) (shrug) How many car salesmen talk about their work, how many executives at cigarette companies
And both of their products kill more people every year than mine
At least mine has a safety switch
If those guys can leave their work at the office, why can't
Shit, you're good
You almost had me convinced
(to his girlfriend, knocking back his drink) We're going, baby
Yuri and Ava are alone at the window, overlooking Central Park
He hands her a fresh glass of champagne
(raising his glass for a toast) To Manet, Monet
and Ava Cordova
Ava grins, goes to drink when she notices two huge diamond earrings laying at the bottom of the glass
(gasp) Yuri
(shrug) The trip went better than expected
(fishing out the damp baubles) Yuri, they're beautiful
(flirtacious grin) But what am  going to wear them with
(flirting back) know just the outfit
They kiss
-
on the diamonds dangling from 's ears
She wears the earrings and nothing else as she and  make love
(
) didn't know how much she knew and how much she ignored
was a good provider and as far as she was concerned - loyal
Despite the other women,  always made love to Ava as if she was the only one

From an unmarked helicopter,   and his shadow a Mercedes sedan as it weaves through midtown traffic
rides in the back seat of the sedan, scouring the world affairs sections of several newspapers
thought interrupts his homework
He opens the sunroof a crack, spies the helicopter tailing the car
He closes the roof
(to the ) Take Park
The sedan enters the underpass beneath the Helmsley building - for a moment the car hidden from aerial surveillance
(to the Driver) This is good
The Driver pulls over, never coming to a complete stop before Yuri bails
Horns blare at the illegal drop-off
(cont'd) (to the Driver from the sidewalk) Take them on a tour of the Tri-State
Yuri grabs Ava's painting from the trunk and the sedan pulls back out into daylight minus Yuri - the occupants of the helicopter none the wiser
Yuri hails a taxi
-
observes the sedan cruising through the heart of Yonkers
Where in God's name is he going
Is he lost
With some reverence,  props Ava's painting against the wall of his private sanctuary, then goes about his business - shuffling passports, deciding who he will be
, dressed in a robe, all smiles, pours herself a cup of coffee
She sips the coffee at the window, glances down
In the courtyard below,   are picking through the garbage cans under the supervision of
Valentine curiously examines the toy gun
The smile is wiped off Ava's face
She makes brief eye-contact with Valentine before stepping back from the window
Slightly shaken, she picks up the phone and dials
(into phone) Vitaly
it's Ava
- -76
The cargo hold of an Ilyushin-76 cargo plane
It's so overflowing with weapons, many are strapped into the passenger seats
Sierra Leone - 1999 (
) was now the best merchant of death alive didn't own my own plane
owned a fleet - running guns into Liberia, Sierra Leone or the Ivory Coast at least once a week
Unfortunately, my friends at Interpol were also starting to find West Africa on the map
Most trips  had phoney paperwork
If the deadline was tight,  had no paperwork at all
In the cockpit, an American  and - keep an idle watch on their instruments as they fly over the endless plains of Sierra Leone
sits in the jump-seat, reading the Wall Street Journal
(to his co-pilot) --Even taking into consideration the pay-off to the parents, a week with a girl in Burkina Faso is cheaper than a night with a girl in Jersey
- Plus, they're cleaner-- --and a lot of them speak better English
- (shrug) Personally,  prefer a language barrier-- An unmarked military jet appears through the starboard window
The voice on the radio is familiar
(
) --Charlie, Echo, India
Descend for landing on heading zero
two
nine
The Pilot picks up the radio, looks to Yuri
Yuri shakes his head, dialling his satellite phone
Yuri's call is answered
(into phone, trying not to sound too desperate) Colonel Southern, it's Yuri
Sorry to call you on this number but 've got an Interpol jet and-- The jet outside the window falls back
mid-rank office dominated by a computer terminal
We look over 's shoulder
He is admiring a new medal
Two other sit opposite
(into phone, measured voice) can't know you right now
It's not a good time
Southern hangs up
- -76
, hearing the response, explodes
(gaping at the phone in disbelief) Not a good time
Suddenly machine gun fire strafes the Ilyushin - bullets tearing through the fuselage, perilously close to Yurirs very combustible cargo
- Motherfucker
The jet appears again at the window
(radio) --Charlie, Echo, India
Comply immediately
That was your last warning
Where was the first fucking warning
(radio) Rock your wings if you intend to comply
(to Yuri, anxious) 'm putting us down
(incredulous) You land and we're all going away
don't have paperwork
(incredulous) We're in a flying fucking bomb
They're firing bullets at our bullets
Forget about going away
They shoot again, we're going away for good
'm putting us down
(knowing he's right) Okay
Okay
--Fuck
The pilot responds on the radio
(into radio) This is Charlie Echo India
Descending on heading zero two nine
The Interpol jet takes the lead towards a small airport
Yuri surveys the terrain below, getting his head back in the game
(pointing out a narrow highway) Not the airport
There
The highway
It's our only fucking hope
(concerned) pothole could set us off
Don't underestimate yourself
You're the best, Tony
The pilot doesn't buy it but reluctantly changes course anyway
From his own wingseat,  observes the Ilyushin's detour, landing on the highway
can't land there
(to the pilot) He can't get far
want a truck waiting on the tarmac
heavily-trafficked highway
carrying water jars on their heads, a thin  pulling the carcass of a car,  selling dry meat,  playing war games
The pedestrians look up to see the lumbering Ilyushin making its final approach - they scatter
The Ilyushin weaves on landing, hits a bone-jarring pothole
- boxes of grenades, bullets and other munitions jump dangerously up and down
Finally, the Ilyushin pulls up safely on the highway, engines shutting down
's head appears out of the cockpit window
Curious , recovered from the shock, are gathering at the side of the road
(to the pilots, sizing up the locals) We're going to be okay
The  are already halfway out of the plane door, grabbing supplies as they go
(cont'd) (calling out from the window) Where are you going
As far from the evidence as  can
The pilots start running down the highway
Wait, you idiots
There's not going to be any evidence
Stay with the plane
The pilots ignore him - run for their lives
is left alone
He turns a lever marked, " "
The rear cargo bay opens
stands beside his incriminating merchandise
(to the gathering locals) Help yourselves
Be my guest
No charge
One   tentatively approaches the cargo bay
Yuri hands him an -47 and a box of shells
More    emerge from the side of the road, seemingly out of thin air
Yuri hands out more guns
(cont'd) (to other locals) Take the whole crate
Two men oblige, ferrying the crate away
The other locals become bolder, then brazen
Soon it's a free-far-all
Men, women and children swarm all over the plane pilfering the arms and anything else that isn't bolted down - also a lot that is
Yuri has to exit the plane to avoid being trampled in the rush
buys a Fanta from a vendor - exchanging it for a box of grenades
He sits on a soda crate for a front row seat at the chaos
Yuri has a calculator out - totalling his losses
(muttering under his breath, shutting off the calculator in disgust) What a fucking disaster
Yuri sees the pilot seats being stolen
Hey, not those
You don't touch the plane
(plaintive moan) Not the fucking seats
Glancing up the highway, Yuri sees an approaching cloud of dust - and two truckfuls of heavily-armed Interpol Agents
Too late
The last of the guns and ammunition are being carted away on the back of a thin cow
Valentine's truck fishtails to a halt beside the stripped plane
Valentine is first off the trucks and into the plane's cargo bay - empty
Other   fan out - futilely questioning locals
Miraculously the weapons have vanished into the bush
Valentine calls out to the last fleeing local - a  with a lifevest
Hey, you
The boy stares back, defiantly inflates the life preserver
(cont'd) (exasperated) Forget it
The entire cargo has gone
An errant bullet falls off a shelf in the plane and rolls down the floor - Valentine picks it up
sits innocently on his soda crate
frustrated African Interpol Agent, , wound-up by the chase, rushes Yuri - slams him to the ground
You run from us
(flashing a machete in Yuri's face) Can you run with no legs
Valentine rushes over, pulls Mbizi off Yuri
No, Mbizi
No, no, no
Valentine drags Mbizi out of Yuri's earshot
Mbizi still wants a piece of Yuri - Valentine preventing him getting to the gunrunner
Let me disappear him, Mr
Valentine
He is a devil
Let me disappear him
can't do that
Look where we are
Who will know
We will
Mbizi stops struggling against Valentine
Turn your back, Mr
Valentine
will go to hell to stop him
(gently) No
(to his Agents) Find the pilots
Mbizi and another Agent reluctantly head off in a truck
Valentine returns to Yuri who is dusting himself off
Valentine handcuffs Yuri himself, picks up the soda crate and sits Yuri back on it
(cont'd) 've spent my whole career on the right side of the line
You're the first man 've encountered who makes me seriously consider crossing it
What's the charge
What are you doing in Sierra Leone
'm on safari
(referring to the bullet) Shooting wildebeests with submachine guns
Are you with the park service
Hunting without a license - is that the charge
You're trafficking arms
Trading
But without evidence who can say
Trade or traffic, you make a fortune by keeping the poorest people on the planet killing each other
(hesitates, unsure whether to waste his breath - wastes it anyway) Do you know why  do what  do
Yuri remains handcuffed, sitting on the soda crate - dwarfed by the cargo plane
Valentine paces beside him
(cont'd) (ignoring him) There are more prestigious assignments, you know
Keeping track of the nuclear arsenals
You would think it more critical to world security
It's not
Nine out of ten war victims today are killed by assault rifles and other small arms - like yours
Those missiles just sit in their silos
Your -47 - it's the real weapon of mass destruction
Yuri regards his interrogator curiously
Despite the sun beating down, he feels obliged to give him his version of the facts of life
don't want people dead, Agent Valentine
admit, a shooting war is better for business
But 'd prefer people to fire my guns and miss
Just as long as they're firing
He regards Valentine with something approaching pity
(cont'd) realize the unspeakable things that are done with my weapons
also understand the unspeakable things that are done with Williams Sonoma carving knives and Wilson baseball bats and they aren't taking those off the market any time soon
People will always buy guns
Why not mine
Valentine appears to have no answer
(cont'd) Can  go
You've got nothing on me-- (unable to resist) --but cuffs
Now Valentine smiles
am legally permitted to hold you for twenty-four hours without charging you
Yuri looks away, knows where this is going
(cont'd) You may ask, why do  bother to do that can assure you, it is not because  enjoy your company
And you may be surprised to learn that it is not for any vindictive motive
No
The reason  delay you for every second of the permissible twenty-four hours, is that  am delaying your deadly trade and the deaths of your victims
don't think of it as taking a day from you but giving a day to them
Some innocent man, woman or child somewhere has one more day on this earth because you are not free
Valentine looks to his watch
(cont'd) See you in twenty-three hours and fifty five minutes
Valentine walks away
Yuri is left to ponder the notion
We see time lapse photography of Yuri waiting out his twenty-four hours, under armed guard on the highway - stretching his legs, eating a suspicious-looking sandwich, going to the bathroom, the sun arcing across the sky - all the while his plane is being cannibalized by the locals
Finally the time lapse slows back into real time
Valentine returns in a Jeep with Mbizi and other Agents
You'll be pleased to know your colleagues were no more co-operative than you
Valentine opens the back of the Jeep
Lying in the back, the bodies of the two  shot and stripped
(cont'd) The locals got to them before we could
Yuri turns away from the sight
His handcuffs are removed
Returning Yuri's documents, Valentine notices a photo of  and in the wallet
(cont'd) Handsome family
Valentine and the Agents get back in the truck and drive away
starts to walk down the deserted highway alone - his cargo plane is now just another carcass in the jungle
of armored personnel carriers barrels past him - the color: white
The lead car slams on its brakes, bringing the train to a stop
woman pokes her head out of the window - (pleasantly surprised) Yuri
Yuri Orlov
(giving her an embarrassed hug) Vivian
What are you doing here
(approaching the window) You know
Fighting the good fight
An aid program
Uh, yes
In fact, 've just had some transport problems
You couldn't give me a ride to Monrovia, could you
Sure
Climb in
Yuri steps back into a vehicle with which he is very familiar
(cant' d) We're pulling out
It's too dangerous
It's a shame
We were really doing some good things
Yuri nods in understanding
- '
weary  enters his room
Sitting on the green sofa - bound and gagged, face reduced to pulp, silver hair matted with blood - Jesus
Simeon
, a  and his  appear from behind the door, laughing at his shocked reaction
(cont'd) Andre
What in heaven is he doing here
gift for you
Yuri stares into the old gunrunner's terrified eyes
(cont'd) You got here just in time
was afraid he would die before you got a chance to kill him
He offers Yuri a Beretta
Me
Who do you think informed on you - cost you your plane
He came to meet my father, hoping to take your place
Yuri spits on Simeon
You stupid old fuck
(knowing smile) He killed your man when he tried to kill you
Andre again offers Yuri the Beretta
No
(confused) You want us to let him go
No
No
Andre offers him the gun a third time
Yuri refuses it
So you do want him dead
You just don't want to kill him yourself
understand
Andre grabs Yuri and presses the gun into Yuri's palm, clasping his own hand over Yuri's
We'll do it together
bonding experience
Andre forces Yuri's finger onto the trigger as he aims at the terrified Simeon - eyes pleading
Yuri attempts to pull his hand away but Andre is too strong
You can stop if you want - but you do
Just say the word
Andre stares at Yuri not Simeon
(cont'd) Say, "stop"
Yuri opens his mouth but no word comes
Andre presses Yuri's finger onto the trigger
The gun goes off
splash of blood across the sofa's green upholstery
The gunshot echoes around the room
Simeon is very dead
(quietly) Stop
Andre smiles
(surveying the blood-spattered room) 'll get you another room with a nicer view
-
collapses on the bar - gestures to the  who immediately pours a line of cocaine in full view
hoovers it up
(
) started doing a lot of cocaine in West Africa
wasn't medicating myself
was simply playing catch-up
was constantly dealing with people who are chemically imbalanced without the aid of chemicals
It's just a matter of etiquette
It's rude to act sane in a room full of lunatics
The Barman nods to a patron at a corner table - a - no more than eighteen years old
He bought you "brown-brown", Mr
Yuri
(wiping his nose) What
"Brown-brown"
What is it
(laughs) mixture - cocaine and gunpowder
What does the gunpowder do
It's magic
They give it to the small boys before battle - they do anything
Some other time
You have to try it at least once, Mr
Yuri
The Barman starts chopping another line
Why
(laughing) Because it's your gunpowder
Sure enough the Barman pours the gunpowder from one of Yuri's 39mm shells into the cocaine
The  , assault rifle slung over his shoulder, intimidating air, sidles up to Yuri - stares him down
Yuri has no option, does a line
He washes it down with a swig from a vodka bottle, raises his glass to the fighter
The Barman puts on a Ukrainian folk song
Yuri picks out one of the in the bar, starts dancing
He drunkenly dances with one  after another - the dance almost violent, the prostitutes flung aside, none lasting more than a few seconds - caught in the arms of the other
To Yuri, the bar swims before his eyes
The music stops
Yuri, wild-eyed, looks at the stunned bar room
(to no one in particular, whipping his vodka bottle off the bar) 'm going for a walk
'
[ -8 & , , - ,  &    -- ] staggers towards the edge of town - still swigging from his bottle
, eyes unable to focus, stares at a '  in front of him, moving back and forth
The gyrating stops
Yuri realizes he is lying in the mouth of an enormous cement pipe on his back, a prostitute on top of him
She gets to her feet, adjusting her dress
Yuri panics, hurriedly zipping himself
(a mixture of French and English) didn't fuck you, did
Did  fuck you
(in French, as she counts Yuri's money) It's not what  would call a fuck
The prostitute tosses a couple of bills back to him
Yuri ignores the money, staggers after her
Are you sick
She ignores him
(cont'd) (screaming) Are you sick
Yuri staggers to his feet - wanders aimlessly across a field
Two dozen pairs of feet chase each other on a dirt field to cheers from a crowd
The dust clears, revealing a bundle of cloth and string doubling as a soccer ball
The game is between two indistinguishable teams of   on a makeshift dirt field, goalposts constructed from tree branches lashed together
wanders onto the field, joins the game without asking
The players humor him by letting him have the ball
Yuri dribbles up field, takes an enormous swipe at the ball, misses completely, clattering to the ground
The crowd and players laugh
The game goes on
Yuri, also laughing but in a far more desperate manner, picks himself up and wanders away
"-" throws up at the back of a saloon flimsily constructed from rusted corrugated iron
Rinsing out his mouth with vodka, he is distracted by the sound of two little  arguing
#1 (
) They will
#2 (
) They won't
#1 (
) They will
#2 (
) They won't
#1 They will
#2 Ask the foreigner
The foreigner will know
The  approach Yuri - no older than seven, formal white dresses, hands politely behind their backs
Hello
#1 Sir, will my fingers grow back
One of the girls shows Yuri a healed stump where her hand should be
Yuri runs away
passes in front of an abstract arrangement of holes that turns out to be a building pock-marked with gunshells
Suddenly a  appears in one of the holes -
The gunshot wound in his forehead still evident
Yuri gasps
Simeon
Simeon turns and walks away - revealing a large exit wound in the back of his head
(cont'd) Simeon
Yuri pokes his head through the hole but Simeon has vanished
Yuri turns back to find himself trapped by   in flip-flops, shorts, Gap -shirts and -47's
Through Yuri's eyes the two men look like four
The two/four men go through Yuri's pockets, take his watch, shoes
Yuri is oddly compliant - clumsily helping one of the thieves fasten the watch
One of the men, tired of Yuri's antics, aims his gun at Yuri's head
His colleague stops him
#1 Don't
He's Andre's
#2 (keeping his gun raised) Fuck Andre
(seemingly beyond caring) Yeah, fuck Andre
The man fires at Yuri
The gun jams
Yuri looks almost disappointed
The man tries again
Again the gun jams
(referring to the gun) 'm sorry
They don't usually do that
Let me have a look
Maybe  can fix it
#1 (disgusted) Fuck off
The man whips the gun across Yuri's face
, face streaked with blood and dirt, wanders aimlessly through the brush outside Monrovia
appears on the dirt path in front of him - teeth bared, frenzied eyes
Yuri stares at the wild dog - starts to quietly cry
Tears roll down his cheeks
The hyena runs away
Yuri is alone
: vacant-eyed  sits in the shadow of an enormous stack of arms, unloaded from a freighter
presidential motorcade appears on the dock emerges out of his Mercedes Jeep, gun in his hand
He strides up to Yuri
Yuri, you fucked up
am going to shoot your face off with your own gun
Yuri doesn't flinch
(unfazed, regarding the man) Not bad
Andre's latest double
The man's face falls
The real   emerges from the car with (to Yuri, standing beside his uncanny double) How did you know
He's too eloquent
You have no heart
Baptiste brandishes a copy of the New York Times
Have you seen the news
They accuse me of rigging elections, but after this in your Florida with your Supreme Court of kangaroos-- the headline, "
"
(cont'd) --now the
must shut up forever
Yuri just smiles
More good news
That's the last aid shipment
The war is so bad, the
is pulling out
Andre shrugs
He regards the inactivity at the dock
Why is nothing happening
,
(reluctant to give his father bad news) No trucks
They are trapped on the front lines
There are trucks
You just have to get all that food out of them
Yuri gestures down the dock where food is being loaded into trucks marked, " " Andre Baptiste and Andre Jnr
are clearly taken with the idea
Killing certain humans can be considered humanitarian
(thinly disguised reference to the previous night) Isn't that right, Mr
Yuri
Andre Baptiste hands Yuri his payment - a slim briefcase containing a pouch of uncut diamonds
(
) After surviving the last few days 'd started to feel like  was invincible
But there was a weapon that could hurt me
From behind the cover of a sofa  shoots at an unseen foe, his finger as the gun
The camera pans around the room to find  in an armchair opposite Hush, Nicki
(to Valentine) don't believe you
Valentine is unfazed
(cont'd) Can you prove any of it
Where is your evidence
was hoping you could help us with that
(opens an old file containing a copy of a newspaper clipping, headlined, "Cordova Disappearance" ) understand your parents died tragically in Salvador
(meeting Avars gaze) That regime has startling similarities to several of the regimes supplied by your husband
Get out
Valentine rises to leave
Ava holds Nicolai, her mind reeling
-
Impossibly thin  strut along a transparent lightbox of a runway, flanked by  and
Projected on the wall behind them, the words, " - Dress Not To Kill" and various images from the world's warzones
Each outfit is enthusiastically applauded
And now, one of the sponsors of tonight's evening, former Miss World, Ava Cordova
appears from behind the wings in a designer gown
She modestly accepts the applause - gradually becomes aware of a projection on her face
She turns to see the projected image of a  holding an -47
When she turns back, tears are rolling down her face
Back to us,  naked, sits on the end of her bed, clothes laid out beside her
(
) Ava
, still carrying his suitcase, appears in the doorway
He drops the case
Ava, what's wrong
Where's Nicki
(still with her back to us) He's with your parents
Yuri senses something very wrong
Why aren't you dressed
thought we were going out
He finds a robe from the closet - gently places it around her
She pulls it off her shoulders
(turning back to look at him) can't wear the clothes
can't wear the jewelry
can't drive the car
can't live in this house
Everything1s got blood on it
Yuri pulls the robe back onto her shoulders, walks to the window
Don't be so melodramatic
Ava pulls the robe to her, follows Yuri to the window
Of course 'm melodramatic
'm a failed actress, remember
We need to talk about it
Why
We never have before
Now we do
Yuri notices the Interpol business card on the bedside table
These people - you can't trust them-- --'ve talked to your parents
Why do you think they don't want your money
They know where it comes from
We all know
Yuri sighs, resigned
sell people a means to defend themselves, Ava
That's all
don't hold a gun to any one's head and make them shoot-- --Yuri,  see the news
Sierra Leone-- -- don't sell machetes
--What do you think is pointing at the victims when they use those machetes
see the pictures
Yuri, the guns are bigger than the boys
(angered) There's nothing illegal about what  do
don't care if it's legal, it's wrong
Ava meets his eye
(cont' d) can accept the drugs
can even accept the other women
can't accept this
Yuri looks away
Please stop
(looks back) It makes no difference if  stop
Someone will take my place the next day
Let them
We have enough
You're not that little boy in Odessa anymore, lining up for a loaf of bread-- --It's not about the money
What is it
He doesn't answer - perhaps he doesn't have one
Ava looks out of the window at their expensive view
(cont'd) feel like all 've done my whole life is be pretty
All 've done is be born
'm not just a failed actress
'm also a failed writer, failed artist, failed businesswoman
'm not much good as a mother
Come to think of it, 'm not even that pretty any more
've failed at everything, Yuri
(turning back to him) But  won't fail as a human being
'm leaving
The words finally register with Yuri
You can't leave
'll stop
(as if trying to convince himself) 'll stop
Ava is skeptical
He holds her, reassures her
(cont'd) 've been thinking about it for a while lot, lately
(as if trying to convince himself) 'm making more from the oil and timber anyhow
(further reassurance) 'll stop
She interrogates his eyes for the truth
(pleading eyes) You will
You promise
(deadly serious) Yes
(changing the subject a millisecond too fast) Now get dressed
We'll go out
Ava picks up the dress off the bed
Yuri gazes at her
(cont'd) By the way, you're wrong about not being pretty any more
She turns back and smiles
, carrying a tray of coffee, approaches a plain panel van parked outside Yuri's apartment building
(
) For the next month  stopped running guns
went legitimate
The van door opens to reveal  and other  , wearing headsets, monitoring a scanner device
The agents read porn to keep themselves amused - except Valentine
(
) No wonder Valentine was confused
toys with his old  pendant as he talks on the phone
For once the spreadsheets in front of him deal with oil and timber
(
) Thank God there are still legal ways to exploit developing countries
With the cordless phone to his ear, Yuri wanders to the kitchen
He tosses the pendant down a trash chute
Back in the den, Yuri punches a calculator as he continues his phone call
(
) But the only problem with an honest buck is they're so hard to make
The margins are too low
Too many people are doing it
Finally we are privy to the conversation
(into phone) --Impossible
Two and a quarter
can't make a profit at two and a quarter
Why don't you take my oil and 'll fucking pay you
Yuri hangs up, stares down from his apartment window
Valentine's panel truck drives away
Night has fallen over Central Park - criss-crossed by a necklace of lights
Yuri continues to stare out of the window
He is perplexed by the sight of a diplomatic motorcade parked in front of his building
Before he can make sense of it, the house phone rings
enters
(confused) Yuri, the President of Liberia is in the lobby
Yuri, stunned for a millisecond, recovers with a smile
(glance to his watch) He's early
-
is admiring his new uniform in a gilt edged mirror
is flirting with two   - residents of the building
The perplexed  stares at the motorcade outside his door - flashing lights on the police escort
(to the girls) --You should come to Liberia with me tomorrow
It is beautiful this time of year
Liberia
Is that on Long Island
, ashen-faced, hurriedly exits the elevator into the ornate lobby - strides up to Andre Snr
Yuri
(nervous as hell) What the fuck are you doing here, Andre
(hugging Yuri) We're here for the peace talks at the
(pulling him out of earshot of the curious Doorman, anxious whisper) So at the same time you thought you'd drop in on your arms dealer
Is that what you still are
You're a hard man to get hold of all of a sudden
-- --But now you mention it, we are doing a little shopping while we're here - that is if you open for business
(anxious look past Andre to the motorcade on the street) They've got to be watching
(disdainful shrug) Of course they blame me
They always blame me
They are on a-- (unable to resist) --hunt for a witch
(a smile, for once correcting Yuri) "Witch-hunt"
But  have been granted diplomatic immunity due to the escalation in hostilities
(conspiratorial) That is why  need you
They are making life difficult to re-supply
It will require a man of your unusual ingenuity
can't help you
'm sorry
(nods) understand
He shakes Yuri's hand firmly
(cont'd) But you should know that our present difficulties compel us to be unusually generous
Yuri realizes that Andre has placed a huge uncut diamond in his hand
(cont'd) (hugging Yuri) Farewell, Lord of War
You still haven't brought me the gun of Rambo
Andre Baptiste and his son breeze out of the lobby
-
enters, sits in an armchair
and  are cuddled on the sofa - Ava reading him a fairytale
(looking up from the book) Was that about the oil or the timber
Both
Everything
Ava smiles, carries on reading
Yuri looks to his hand - we rack focus to the uncut diamond
Yuri gets up
-
, still in his suit, stands in a dumpster, searching
(
) At four and a half months a human fetus has a reptile's tail - a remnant of our evolution
Amongst a pile of rotten food he finds his necklace containing the (
) You can fight a lot of enemies and survive but if you fight your biology you always lose
Yuri places the bullet around his neck
is fastening eight-year-old 's coat, readying to go out
, half-dressed, appears in the hallway
Hey, not even waiting to say goodbye
'm leaving in ten minutes
Sorry, Nicki has swim practice
Nicolai kisses his father
Bye, Papa
(hugging him) See you, big guy
Ava kisses Yuri
(teasing him) Personally, 'm glad you're going
You've been here so long you're starting to get on my nerves
(taking the teasing good- naturedly) This oil concession should be wrapped up by Thursday
'll be back for the weekend
We'll go somewhere - the sea
That would be fun
thought occurs to Yuri
You trust me, right
Yuri's turn to interrogate her eyes
Ava smiles
(
) She looked me directly in the eye the way 've looked in the eyes of a thousand customs officials, government bureaucrats and footsoldiers from every law enforcement agency in the world - and she lied without flinching
Yes,  trust you
(
) She'd learned from the best
Ava gives Yuri a final kiss, hurries Nicolai out the door
From the rear seat of a Mercedes sedan we observe  exiting the apartment building and entering a waiting Mercedes sedan of his own
(
) (to the ) That's him
We reveal  and  in the car
Yuri's car pulls away and Ava's car follows
(confused) Where are we going, Mama
It's a game
Like hide and seek
Yes
locks his storage locker, observable from the street, and exits the facility carrying a passport and briefcase
(
) can always sense when 'm being tailed know what to look for
But then 'd never been tailed by the woman  love
Returning to his car, Yuri fails to notice that  has witnessed his routine from her own car
Instead of following the car, Ava exits with Nicolai
,  in tow, approaches Yuri's locker
She tries a combination - fails
Tries another - fails
third - same result
(
) can put myself in Ava's place
She might have understood if the combination was the last four digits of my social, my birthdate, even her birthdate but not Nicolai's
Ava looks to Nicolai, tries one more combination, reluctantly
the numerals on the lock - "10
6
" (
) My son's birthday unlocked what the government would later describe as, "a catalogue of carnage"
"90"
The lock opens
(whisper, to herself) Not that
Not that, Yuri
Ava opens the storage room door - at first struck by the exhibition of her paintings inside the locker
Shaking the image from her head, she turns her attention to the briefcases and other documents
She shuffles through the passports in horror - different photos of Yuri, different names: "George Eagleman", "Georges 'Aigle", etc
Who is her husband
Is he any of them
" "  -
is back at work in the kitchen of the family restaurant
approaches - Vitaly senses something amiss
Come to see how the other half lives
miss your borscht
Mom and Dad say you're clean
You too
They said you went legitimate - hard to believe
That's because it's not true
Vitaly is hardly surprised
Yuri glances to his parents,  and , at the restaurant counter, folding napkins - observing their two sons
They avert their eyes
Only you know
'm leaving tonight - on a job
want you to come
can't
'm thinking of opening my own place
Maybe this trip will help
It's good money
(looking to his parents) 've given my word
They don't have to know
We'll tell them we're going for a little "r" and "r"
Why do you need me all of a sudden
West Africa's fucked-up
(off Vitaly's look) More than usual
can't trust anybody need someone to watch my back
The notion touches Vitaly
Yuri closes the deal
(cant'd) "Brothers in arms"
Vitaly looks to his
They stare at him until he averts his eyes
Vitaly can't refuse his brother
-
fork in the road
Two large trucks slog through the bush - take the left fork
Sierra Leone - 2000 ,  and
are in the cab of the truck, beside the Andre is admiring his new M60 machine gun with attachable grenade launcher - the gun of Rambo
(concerned by the route) Where are we going
- "freedom fighters"
Yuri stares out of the window
(
) Every faction in Africa calls themselves by these noble names - "liberation-this", "patriotic-that", "democratic-republic-of- something or other"
guess they can't own up to what they usually are - "federation- of-worse-oppressors-than-the last-bunch-of- oppressors"
Often the most barbaric atrocities occur when both combatants proclaim themselves "freedom fighters"
The truck passes a checkpoint marked by two skulls
-
tent city
Jeep packed with young, machete-wielding circles the refugee camp, taunting and terrorizing the inhabitants
The mostly  and  are trapped by the circling Jeep
Whenever a refugee attempts to escape, they are driven back by the increasingly manic, shrieking rebels
Yuri's two trucks are parked on the roadway above the camp where the rest of the  are massed - a rag-tag mob wearing over-sized sneakers, carrying machetes and the occasional -47
At a small folding table a   negotiates with  and The Leader places a pile of uncut diamonds on the table
is more interested in the camp - observing the circling Jeep full of Rebels and their smirking comrades on the highway
From a distance, he spies a  and   make a desperate bid for escape from the camp
Two , on foot, give chase
The woman appears to be pregnant
Vitaly watches in horror
The Woman is quickly overtaken and hacked to death
Then the Boy
Vitaly can't look, turns away
Jesus
Vitaly comes to a horrific realization
He hurries to Yuri, still negotiating with the Rebel Leader
Yuri,  need to talk to you
Not now
(insistent) Now
(to the Rebel Leader) Excuse me
Vitaly draws Yuri out of earshot
(irritated by the interruption) What
(anxious whisper) We can't do this deal
(incredulous) The fuck we can't
(referring to the camp) Look over there
As soon as we leave, they're going to die
(averting his eyes from the camp) It's not our business
(protesting) They killed a boy just now - as young as Nicki
Yuri flinches
The suspicious Rebel Leader and Andre Jnr
approach the two brothers
What's the hold up
(trying to keep his poise) There is no hold up
'll be right there
Yuri draws Vitaly further away
(cont'd) Vitaly, it's what we always know - we can't control what they do
Today we can
They're right there - close enough to touch
(angry, impatient) What do you think they'll do if we back out - they'll kill us
And if we go ahead - they'll kill them
The Rebel Leader approaches again - this time he's not leaving
What is he saying
Nothing
Vitaly realizes the futility of the discussion, backs down
(resigned) Nothing
You're right, Yuri
You're right
(getting his head back in the game) Did  hear you say 300 's, 500 assault rifles and 800 grenades
thought it was 1,200 grenades
'd better check
Yuri pats his brother on the back, returns to the negotiating table
Vitaly heads for the trucks
For once we follow Vitaly
Andre Jnr
regards Vitaly warily
The prongs of a hammer on a box of grenades
is prying open the lid
Andre Jnr
appears behind him - M60 poised ominously on his hip
What are you doing
Something for Yuri
Step away - slowly
Vitaly closes the lid - a ruse
He picks up the hammer and in one sudden, violent motion swings it across Andre's face, smashing his jaw, teeth flying, Andre's body flopping like a rag doll
Vitaly grabs two grenades from the box, pulls the pin from one and bowls it into the truck
He runs
The truck explodes in a fireball - instantly incinerating Andre Jnr
Yuri's head whips around
The Rebel Leader's head whips around
Vit
Vitaly dashes for the second truck
The   opens fire, raking Vitaly with machine-gun fire - still trying to run with legs torn to shreds
(cont'd) No
second hail of gunfire - all  firing
Vitaly's legs betray him
He collapses to the ground in a pile of blood and dust
We focus on Vitaly's still  - he has taken enough bullets to kill him three times over
But he is not quite dead
Agonizingly slow, he raises the grenade hand to his mouth - pulls the pin with his teeth
on Vitaly's , trying to summon the strength to throw the grenade
hand appears, grasps Vitaly's hand - gently but firmly removing the grenade
The Rebels keep their guns trained on Yuri, unsure where his loyalties lie
Yuri holds the fate of the camp in his hands - he could still toss the grenade, destroy the second truck, sacrifice his life
Yuri stares to his brother and then to the grenade in his hand
He reaches down and delicately takes the pin from between Vitaly's lips
The eyes of the brothers meet for the last time
Yuri inserts the pin into the grenade, disarming it - the life goes from Vitaly's eyes forever
Yuri removes any last doubt by tossing the disarmed grenade to the Rebel Leader
Yuri walks away from Vitaly's dead body and returns to the negotiating table - Yuri now the living dead
The Rebel Leader looks to the two trucks - one burning, one not
He removes half of the diamonds from the table
sits in the cab, staring out of the window as the truck drives away
(
) Vitaly broke the cardinal rule of gunrunning
Never pick up a gun and join the customers
The truck turns the bend
In the background, true to Vitaly's prediction, the rebels descend on the tent village, firing indiscriminately with their new weapons
Yuri hears the sound - we detect a barely perceptible flinch
lone gun crate, emptied of its contents has been put to use as 's makeshift coffin
(
) Coffins are hard to come by in Sierra Leone
Demand is so high
Fortunately, we had a lot of boxes just the right size
"America's Funniest Home Videos" plays on a  set
The canned laughter appears to be almost directed at  who is making a long- distance call on a geriatric telephone
We aren't privy to the conversation
(
) don't know which is worse, Jewish guilt or Catholic guilt
My parents were like God's tag-team
We pull back to reveal the makeshift coffin sitting at Yuri's feet
(
) But  could not deny them the chance to say goodbye to their eldest son
-
the screen of an - machine
Innocuous oversize cargo passes in front of the screen - a surfboard, a double bass, then the crate containing 's body
(
) For twenty Monrovian dollars a doctor removed the lead from Vitaly's body and wrote a bogus death certificate
should have paid more
The  of the machine, stops the conveyor belt
(
) 've smuggled millions of rounds of ammunition and the bullet that lands me in jail is found under my dead brother's rib
In Vitaly's chest, a bullet
-
The other oversize items move down the conveyor belt for collection -  waits with two burly
No other items are appearing - finally the coffin containing
Two   appear behind Yuri
(flashing some ) Yuri Orlov, we're with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
(resigned smile, regarding the insignia on their jackets) Believe it or not,  only use the first two
The agents are not amused - handcuff Yuri
You have the right to remain silent
Use it
They march him away
phone rings
, out in the hallway, surrounded by suitcases, looks to the phone, senses the identity of the caller
She hustles  out of the door, closes it behind her
The phone continues to ring
, on a payphone, in the jailhouse corridor, reluctantly hangs up
He makes another call

, lighting a candle, picks up the phone
"Crimean Restaurant"

) Papa
Anatoly looks at the telephone receiver in his hand - without another word he passes the phone to
walks away
(into phone) Both my sons are dead
a  in an evidence bag tossed onto a table - by
The Agent can scarcely contain his excitement
sits at the small table, stares at the slug
One of yours
Yuri doesn't take the bait
Two other  sit at the back of the room observe the interrogation
(cont'd) (referring to a document) Curiously, the death certificate says he died of heart failure
(shrug) Maybe he did
(referring to the slug) If  saw one of those coming at me, l'd have heart failure
The flippant comment gets under Valentine's skin but he keeps his temper in check
We performed the autopsy and released your brother's body to your family
You tried to do something decent, Yuri
You went against your nature
And now it's cost you
(unable to resist) Your brother's funeral is looking a lot like your funeral
Falsifying a death certificate
That's not going to hold me
You're right, as usual
Yuri not so cocky now - waits to see where this is going
(cont'd) (putting a copy of the New York Times in front of Yuri) Have you seen today's paper
front photograph of  posing beside Yuri's documents including his five
The headline reads, "    "
Caption - "Catalogue of carnage
" (cont'd) (pacing, lauding it over Yuri) Fake end-user certificates, cut-out companies, all meticulously catalogued
There's hardly a dictator, warlord or despot anywhere in the world you aren't on first name terms with
(producing another evidence bag containing Ava's diamond earrings and an engagement ring) Your trophy wife gave us the prize
She also provided us with these - which we suspect are conflict diamonds
Yuri takes all this in
(cont'd) She has agreed to testify against you
Yuri nods - picks up the newspaper
But instead of reading about his own front page news, he opens the paper, turns to World Affairs - various items on the warzones at the end of the millennium
Yuri reads, takes his time
Valentine cannot believe his audacity
Finally Yuri reacts
broad smile - his killer smile
Enjoy it
(confused) What
This
Tell me that  am everything you despise, that  am the personification of evil, that 'm responsible for the breakdown of the social fabric of society and world order, that  am a one man genocide
Say everything you want to say to me now - because you don't have long
Valentine is infuriated by Yuri's casual demeanor
Are you not paying attention or are you delusional
You've broken every arms embargo written
There's enough in those briefcases to buy you consecutive life sentences
You'll spend ten years going from a cell to a courtroom before you even start doing your time
Yuri is looking away, apparently completely unconcerned
His attitude further angers Valentine
(cont'd) You don't seem to fully appreciate the seriousness of your situation
(snapping back - his emotion finally showing) My family has disowned me
My wife and son have left me
My brother is dead
Trust me,  fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation
But  promise you  won't spend a single second in a courtroom
Valentine laughs derisively
You are delusional
Yuri is still unfazed
He leans forward to close the deal
like you, Jack
Well, maybe not
But understand you
You feel your loyalty to your badge has finally been rewarded
But you haven't counted on the people who gave you that badge
Valentine's turn to hesitate
(cont'd) (meeting Valentine's gaze) Let me tell you what's going to happen so you can prepare yourself
Yuri nods to the interview room door
(cont'd) Soon there's going to be a knock on that door and you're going to be called outside
montage of scenes - Yuri's prediction plays out accompanied by his commentary
knock at the door and an  nods to
(
) In the hall there will be a man who outranks you
-
Sure enough, a decorated military  talks to  in the hallway as Yuri describes
(
) First, he will compliment you on the fine job you've done, how you're making the world a safer place and then he is going to tell you that  am to be released
We observe valentine's reaction - vigorously arguing with his superior
(
) You are going to protest, you will probably threaten to resign
The Officer, still turned away from us, tries to calm Valentine
-
The door to the interview room opens
(
) But in the end  will be released
Yuri exits the cell to freedom
We return to the present
's eyes burn into
(glancing to the open newspaper) The reason 'll be released is the same reason you think  will be convicted
do rub shoulders with the most vile, sadistic men calling themselves leaders today
(referring to the newspaper) But some of those men are the enemies of your enemies
Valentine is starting to get a sick feeling
(cont'd) And while the biggest arms dealer in the world is your boss, the President of the United States - who ships more merchandise in a day than  do in a year - sometimes it's embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the guns
Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me to supply opposition forces he can't be seen supplying
You call me evil, but, unfortunately for you,  am a necessary evil
There is a long silence
Then, Valentine and Yuri exchange a look
Valentine rises from the desk
would tell you to go to hell
But  think you're already there
Valentine turns on his heel
He is at the door when Yuri finally replies
What if 'm not
What if  sleep fine at night
What if  sleep better than you think that's what truly scares you
Valentine doesn't look back, exits
Sure enough, the Officer is in the hall as Yuri predicted -
-
car trunk closes on Yuri's five briefcases and other documents
is escorted out the rear entrance of the city jail to the nondescript sedan by
As he's ushered into the car, Southern hands Yuri yet another briefcase
ushers Yuri into the car, hands him yet another briefcase as the car door closes
rides alone with the briefcase on his lap
(
) Most people are happy just to get out of jail
expect to be paid to leave
Yuri opens the case -
(
) 'm not a fool
know that just because they need me one day doesn't mean they won't make me a scapegoat the next
But  was back doing what  do best
The nondescript sedan melts into rush-hour traffic
-
checkpoint in the desert - the fence a literal line in the sand
accompanies a convoy of trucks
He is joking with a - back to doing what he loves
The Border Officer inspects the crates in a truck, reads the manifest marked, " - : 4,040 units"
(skeptical) Umbrellas - to Saudi Arabia
Sun umbrellas
Yuri hands the Officer a plain, brown paper bag
The Officer looks inside - a wad of cash
Have a safe trip
The Officer waves the convoy through
-
The desert where we first found , the aftermath of a battle
He speaks directly to camera once again
For someone who's never fired a gun or been in a battle,  have suffered many casualties in my life
guess that's how survived
never went to war
His thought is interrupted by a burst of gunfire
(cont'd) especially with myself
Yuri walks away through the charred munitions and black smoke
In the distance the sound of sporadic gunfire
