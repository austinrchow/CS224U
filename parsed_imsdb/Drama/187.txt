-   -     1 a pair of black Dexter penny loafers diligently pedaling an old Schwinn mountain bike
now to meet the bicyclist
He's African-American
Anywhere from 33 to 40
Wears wire-rim glasses, a fresh white oxford shirt, creased slacks and a solid green tie
An unobtrusive figure, at once familiar and yet undiscerning
The type you'd pass on a sidewalk and never even notice
He's
now to reveal the upper promenade bike path and a dramatic view of Lower Manhattan behind him
Morning sun glimmers off the Trade Center towers
Trevor's shadow skitters along the wooden path, 160 ft
above the East River
fat briefcase, strapped to the back of his bike, rocks back and forth as he pumps the pedals
now a sweeping view of Trevor, alone on the bike path, a speck, suspended above a sea of rush hour traffic on the bridge below

( ) -          2 wrought-iron train trestle covered with graffiti shakes as an ""   overhead
Trevor races parallel with it along Atlantic Avenue
Every city block becomes more and more rundown

(                 3 ) - cyclone fence frames the stalwart face of the old three-story administration building
Ubiquitous gray patches of paint fail to cover where taggers have most recently left their marks
The  , a black man with a booming voice, barks at late-comers who are about to be tardy
(clapping his hands) Let's go, people
Tardy lock- out starts in one minute
Get your butts in gear
One minute, people
Move it

Yuh late, Garfield
(catching his breath) No, bell hasn't rung yet
Okay, let's get inside
'mon
(as they file into the room) Morning, morning
Rise and shine
make passing comments
(shaking his head) You one crazy-ass nigga,
(a quarter stuck in one ear) Damn skippy
Thank you for sharing, Auggie
(provoking Auggie) Auggie doggie
(
) Fuck you, Tywan
Yer mama's a gangsta-rapper
Trevor offers a pleasant greeting to the two lovers
'Scuse me, you two
this isn't the Playboy Channel
Trevor enters the room, but ducks his head back into the hall
'Morning, Juanita

Styrofoam nuclei dangle from the ceiling
Trevor unstraps the fat briefcase from his bicycle and sets it on a metal stool next to his desk

August and Tywan, you pass out the books
Thank you, gentlemen
Auggie and Tywan don't budge
Whas up wit' your car,
Yer Pinto blow up
The majority of students aren't even paying attention group in the back is already starting a card game
(good-natured smile) No,  don't own a Pinto, Tywan
(addressing the class) Okay, can  have everyone's attention
No response, but it doesn't phase Trevor
He removes the front wheels from his bike
The purpose of the bicycle is to demonstrate the principle of centripetal force
That's the opposite of the force we studied yesterday, which was
Magnum force
Hoots and laughter
Centrifugal force
Centripetal force is where the acceleration of a body moving in circular motion is directed toward its center by an opposing force, thus creating momentum that constrains the body to its circular path
Like a gyroscope
(sees nothing but yawns) It's better if  show you
Here, Tywan, you be my helper
Tywan and Auggie are busy talking in the corner
They still haven't passed out the books

Come on
Tywan, solidly built like a Rodin bronze, saunters over
Whad-up,
(to rest of class) Hey, shut up
'all too damn loud, man
Class quiets but only marginally
need you to demonstrate centripetal force
(removes briefcase from stool) Here, have a seat
Tywan sits and Trevor hands him the upside-down bicycle
Okay, hold the bike steady with your knees
That's it
Seat positioned against your chest
Tywan glances over at Auggie and starts to laugh
(to Auggie) Shut up, foo
Okay, now crank the pedals and get that back wheel spinning about 180
Whas up wit' dat
(coaxing him along) You'll see
Be patient
skeptical Tywan starts to crank the pedals, but he's not pedaling hard enough
Put some muscle into it
Tywan cranks the pedals harder now
Trevor back-pedals over to the textbook shelf and randomly selects a physical science book (but doesn't open it)

paper airplane sails past an oblivious Tywan
He cranks harder and harder until he's sweating ham juice
Now, he impales Trevor with a befuddled squint
(incredulous) Whas up
tol' you you was crazy, man
thin smile of confidence from Trevor now
Now tilt the wheel to your right
Tywan does and immediately the wheel pulls him to the right, causing the stool to slowly spin on its axis
(eyes wide like a little kid) Aw, damn
'm spinnin'
Lookit me, Auggie
Trevor flickers a smile as Tywan's spinning starts to draw the attention of the rest of the class
Now Trevor refers to the physical science book in his hand
Smile on his face immediately fades
: Physical science textbook
In magic marker
The large number 187 has been scrawled across every page
Trevor flips through the book
He checks the front page to see who it belongs to
Juxtaposed to Trevor's distracted state, the class is now focused on Tywan's achievement
(attempting unison) Tywan, Tywan, Tywan

The place is deserted except for a custodian who pushes a cresting wave of trash ahead of his broom

He clutches the desecrated physical science book
student slides down the banister past him

Okay, fellas, off the table
Put the Walkman away
said put it away
10th grade counselor's office opens and a student emerges
Trevor walks directly in
Walter,  need to speak with you
(Anglo; 52) is a disheveled middle-aged counselor
lifer
He chews on an empty smoking pipe as he glances through a student "cum" (cue-mm)
(preoccupied) 'm pretty busy right now, Garfield
What is it
Trevor sets the book down on Walter's desk and nervously adjusts his glasses
Could you open it, please
Walter opens the book
(a weary look of disgust) Don't suppose this kid cares about our budget crisis
(shuts the book) Have the textbook room charge him for the book
Walter snaps the book shut and looks up at Trevor
That's all
One-Eight-Seven is a penal code number for murder, Walter
Means the same thing as --
'Terminate On the Spot

Look, kid probably heard it in a rap song
Doesn't mean anything
The book belongs to Dennis Broadway
He's a known gangster, Walter -- a 'Five Percenter
' Garfield, if  had a dollar for every time a student threatened faculty
Don't you think you're overreacting a little
(suppressing trepidation) Did you tell Dennis Broadway he was getting a fail from me
(stymied) have legal access to those files
He's a transfer from Nixon High School, isn't he
(becoming defensive) Look, 'm not obligated to track you down every time a transfer student comes through here
You want confidential information like that, come look it up in his cum (cue-mm)
Trevor exhales a sigh of resignation
Do you have him on a contract
If he gets through the semester without a fail then he gets to go back to Nixon, so what
and be with his homeboys

11   :    (2)                                             11 Walter's caught between a rock and a hard place
His instincts lean toward self-preservation
So he blew his opportunity
Now he has to learn to live with the consequences
don't think this kid's ready to deal with the consequences think he wants me dead
Relax, has nothin' to do with you
should have been told, Walter
Hey, 'm on your side, Garfield, but my hands are tied
Kid has a right to his privacy
Know what your problem is
You're an idealist
What's wrong with that
You only see what you wanna see, that's what's wrong
On one hand you think someone's trying to kill you
On the other hand you actually believe kids are paying attention in your classes
Trevor resigns himself to the fact that he's come to the wrong person for support
(collecting himself) Never mind
It's not a problem
(an empty promise) Tell you what, as soon as  get a chance 'll summons the kid
Promise
Trevor's bemusement holds us

Within seconds the corridor is teeming with teenagers
Into   now

About ten paces behind
His Snoop-Dogg Afro frames a gold earring and a pair of deep-set eyes filled with vitriol
Oblivious of Dennis, Trevor presses on toward the north stairwell
and  crowd as the gap between Dennis and Trevor narrows
Every facial expression, every blink of an eye, all magnified a hundred times
Broadway's right hand is wrapped in a dirty white handkerchief as he reaches into the front pocket of his baggie Solos and pulls out a block of wood with a ten-penny nail imbedded in it

silent, paroxysmal terror registers on his face
In a parabolic mirror, the blurred image of Dennis Broadway, pushing hard toward a conclusion now
as Dennis explodes forward, body blocking Trevor from behind, pinning him against a wall and sending the "187" textbook flying
He rams his weapon into Trevor's back
In a   - , filtered sunlight shimmers off the sharpened nail as it slashes downward
barrage of stabbing motions, tearing at cloth and flesh
Trevor's backward flailing arms are ineffective in blocking the frenzied stabfest
Downward slashing, again and again
10 times
Aftermath
As quickly as it began it's over
Dennis Broadway slams open an exit door and is gone
Students scatter like cockroaches
An eerie stillness lingers
Trevor Garfield is lying on his back now in a pool of blood; black plastic framed glasses in pieces on the floor; lifeless arms spread out at his sides
His rheumy, unblinking eyes stare upward into infinite space
Breathing is the major focus of his concentration now as we     his face

Trevor now approaches  , a young plain- clothes narc, who intermittently wands students with a metal detector at the front doors

The kid grudgingly reciprocates, handing over his cap

Along with his briefcase he now carries a sub folder that contains a homeroom roster, lesson plans and seating charts

She's thirty, Anglo, and non-tenured
At the front of the class ten students stand linked together, arm-in- arm, in a human chain

(playfully) You're not thinking
(a major clue) How 'bout Binary search
William remains puzzled
The chain of students delight in chiding him
"'mon, Beavis

(the answer) You split them
Ellen attempts to bisect the impulsive chain of students with a double-handed karate chop
Fickle chain that they are, they resist
(amused) Very funny
Now a   fleeting moment as she catches Trevor's passing gaze and openly smiles at him

, like Algernon and his maze, Trevor negotiates his own path deeper and deeper into the configuration of bungalows
And Trevor's trepidation
Eyes discerning every passerby
His   , senses heightened
And the reverberating of a    as Trevor rounds a corner and comes face to face with three tag-bangers concealing spray paint cans inside their oversized jackets
One of the taggers locks eyes with Trevor as he passes, a slow premonitory burn
The tagger has a "skin tight" (pelon) hair cut and a string of black rosary beads around his neck
barcode tattoo on the back of his neck identi- fies

Meet  , a forty-something ditto-head
The residual effects of a hangover linger as he sneaks a cigarette before first period
He wears a faded Hawaiian shirt and Huarache sandals
An old military tattoo emblazons his left forearm
As he crushes out his cigarette, something catches his eye

Childress investigates
As he approaches the fence
Hey, ese(s)
Homeboys scatter in all directions, some hop the chain- link fence, others scurry out a narrow gate behind the shed
Childress weighs an amused smirk
Now out of nowhere a gangbanger lurches from the shed, buttoning his sagging Dickies and tripping over his own feet
He scrambles out the back gate and is gone
Childress, curiosity piqued, now enters the compound through a tear in the fence

She pulls a dark blue sweat shirt on over her head

"84" -                                    30 Trevor flicks on the lights, exposing bare, colorless walls and closed venetian blinds
His breathing's slightly labored as he sets down his briefcase
His back faces the mob of students that trickle in now as he takes a surreptitious hit off an inhaler
Almost instantly his breathing returns to normal
Now he shuts his eyes and prepares to conjure up the dormant enthusiasm he used to have
Takes a deep cathartic breath
Now he digs a file folder out of his briefcase, opens it, selects a dispatch and approaches the blackboard
as he picks up a piece of chalk
and begins
First he writes his name in the corner of the blackboard
Now he moves to the center of the blackboard and begins to write per the file folder in his hand
"
' " No one pays much attention
Back still facing the class
Before taking roll, 'd like to prove a point

Trevor mentally blocks out the salvo of grunts, groans and expletives
With each subsequent stroke of the chalk he is exorcising his demons
It's not important what
or who
'Farfie' is
Turning to face the class now
Yuh wanna play, yuh gotta stay
Have a seat, please
handful of students take their seats
(pacing now) The point 'd like to make is this
Anyone here can be a scientist
a grudging buzz of confusion
(sotto; puzzled) What's he talking about
scientist is like a detective
He investigates data
He scratches the surface of things he doesn't understand to see what's underneath
(pointing to blackboard) Things like this
Okay, who wants to read
Barsek (the class clown) breaks in
(standing up) 'll do it
Trevor quiets a harmless barrage of, "Bart," "sit down" and "Armenian Power sucks"

Let 'im do it
(to Barsek) What's your name
Barsek
wisp of gratification flickers at the corner of Trevor's mouth
Okay, Barsek
Read
(The following is read in fits and starts and accompanied by diminishing laughter and ridicule
) Glis was very frapper
She had denarpen Farfie's Mardsen
She couldn't galp a giberter for Farfie
Instead she wharked to plimp a mardsen binky for him
Okay, anyone know what Barsek just said
unanimous "No
" Trevor can see the light at the end of the tunnel now
He's back in the zone
That's alright
You don't need to understand something to answer a few simple questions about it
Every one of you is capable of decoding data
Watch
Trevor writes question #1 on the board

Why was Glis Frapper
Can anyone tell me
The Asian Girl, into it now, tentatively raises her hand
(pointing at Asian Girl) Okay

(slowly; cautiously) Glis was frapper
because
she had denarpen Farfie's mardsen
(understated) That's right
You got it

Trevor reads and writes question #2 on the board

What did Glis plimp
Before Trevor can finish writing the question, an unidentified voice blurts out, "He plimped a Ho
" Scattered laughter
Trevor grimaces, shakes his head
Now attempts to add the question mark at the end of the sentence but the chalk breaks, causing dissension
(searching blackboard ledge) Hold on, hold on
Where's your teacher keep the chalk
In the desk
Trevor hastily rifles through the teacher's drawers startling discovery abruptly halts his search
now  a brown paper bag Trevor has opened
Inside the bag is a
357 Magnum
Trevor's narrowing gaze, an offstage voice interrupts
(
) Can  help you
Trevor lifts his head to see Dave Childress standing in the doorway of the bungalow
Trevor shuts the desk drawer

Ms

Childress weighs a shit-eating grin as he glances at Trevor's name on the board
No
This is Dave Childress, American History
Some students brave a laugh at Trevor's expense
Don't know how to break it to you
(glancing at Trevor's name again) Garfield
but this is bungalow 84
Childress now places a patronizing hand on Trevor's shoulder and steers him toward the window blinds
See, you zigged when you shoulda zagged
Course it's not your fault someone jacked the number off my door
Keep askin' Garcia to fix it but all  get is 'nada

Students crowd the opened windows on the far side of the room
The chaotic atmosphere centers around one student
Benny Chacon (18), the tagger we met earlier
Trevor's back to square one
He struggles with trepidation as he steps into the doorway of the bungalow and hesitates
young black girl,   (16), stands near the doorway
She cradles a realistic looking
baby (Education Now And Babies Later)

wad of paper sails past Trevor and out the window
You speak Spanish, Mister

Dat means gangster, homes

No, 'm not a gangster

Benny now finds a seat
Trevor follows him
What's your name
Cesar Chavez
Don't you recognize me
Class laughs
Trevor refers to the seating chart (inside the sub folder) in his hand but Benny's not sitting in his proper seat
Benny indicates a 2" by 3" monitoring device strapped to his ankle

All are 17
Cesar has a buzz-cut, Stevie's an Anglo speed freak with a runny nose and a bleached one-clip haircut (roots showing) and Paco, a Latino
Sit down, please
Cesar, Stevie and Paco ignore Trevor and walk out of the bungalow
Their departure is accompanied by a tumultuous outburst of catcalls and whistles
(peeking Benny's hold card) Mr
, those guys that jus' walked out aren't even in here this period
(pointing to Benny) And this fool's name is Benny Chacon
(whirls in his seat) Shut yer mouth, hood rat
School girl bitch
Okay, Benny
That's enough
Benny turns his wrath on Trevor now
Hey, you ain't no real teacher
Fool, you're nothin' but a sub
'ink yer so cool
You mus' be 'Mr

Trevor closes the sub folder and just looks at Benny
(a cool curiosity) Why do you wear a rosary

To put God on me, okay
Why don't you jus' go sit down and read yer newspaper

palpable beat
Are you done
There is dead silence as Benny stares Trevor straight in the eye
Trevor stares right back
Jus' gimme a referral
Shit
Trevor turns and calmly walks back to the island counter, searches and finds a referral slip in one of the drawers, fills it out
(cool deliberation) For future reference, anyone who disrupts a class, or in any way infringes on the rights of others to get an education, is subject to disciplinary action
(beat) When 'm here, ladies and gentlemen,  expect to be treated decently
(walks back to Benny) hopefully in an atmosphere of mutual respect
This classroom is our sanctuary, yours and mine
Respect it
(handing Benny the referral) For your information,  am a real teacher
Whatever you say, Opie
Benny has a smirk on his face as he sashays past Trevor with the referral slip
Okay, who would like to help me pick up the books
Benny, a self-aggrandized exit, crumbles the referral slip and tosses it at Trevor, hitting him square in the back
Like a reflex, Trevor whirls and ducks
Students laugh at his heightened reaction

Now Dave Childress sits down, disrupting Trevor's solitude
How goes the battle, Garfield
Dave bites into a messy sandwich as he skims the front page of a newspaper that someone left behind

They put 'im upstate in a facility until his twenty-first birthday
That all
They shoulda caned the bastard
Like they did that kid in Singapore
Remember
(recollecting) President of Singapore had a few choice words
Use to have it memorized
He said something like, 'When a state of increasing disorder and defiance cannot be checked by the rules
then new and sometimes drastic rules have to be forged to maintain order

You seem to be an expert on anatomy, Miss -- (checks roster) -- Nartinez
Central nervous system and lymphatic system

Trevor doesn't expect anything remotely close to the right answer
It's like the central nervous system, that's your brain and spinal cord, and the lymphatic system, that's the stuff in your blood that fights diseases

Ellen suppresses a gleeful snicker
Now, Trevor attempts to cut loose
He spins Ellen once, into a tango step, one-two-three

Trevor and Ellen are greeted by Ellen's golden retriever Jack, who's chained to the front porch
, ready to bark
Don't start barking, Jack

You're a good dog
Yes, you are
Jack nuzzles up to Trevor, tail wagging furiously, no barking
Now Trevor stands and faces Ellen
Sorry for reacting the way  did back there
Don't apologize
That's how most people react
Didn't scare me
It just surprised me
Thanks for dinner

You're welcome
Awkward silence
Trevor struggles with the urge to kiss her good night
They look at each other timidly for a moment
Now he moves to kiss her and she inadvertently adjusts her stance
The result is a kiss that doesn't quite hit her mouth
It's an awkward moment
Ellen feels horrible for him, desperately picks up a strange little plant by her feet

He and Stevie are high
Trevor eyes them, finds what he was looking for in the book

No, but  fucked a sheep

His eyes are bloodshot and vapid

Disregarding Cesar, Trevor opens a drawer and removes two latex surgical gloves from a cardboard box
He puts on the gloves and selects a petri dish from another drawer

She does
Trevor now removes a small amber bottle (with an eye-dropper top) from his briefcase

Trevor indicates the amber bottle
In the brown bottle  have a prescription for liquid Demeral
Where'd that come from, sir

Cesar grudgingly watches as Trevor places a measured drop of the liquid demeral into the petri dish and stirs the solution
Demeral is a morphine sulphate
and is soluble in water
Using the pipette, Trevor administers two drops of the demeral and water solution to the sugar cube, which he has placed inside Snowball's cage

We can still be friends

(back to lighter note) Now, can  ask you a favor
After you're done with Hyland, can you give me a ride to my car

Cesar glares at the watch, looks up at the video camera
You broke into my locker
Dat's a serious felony, prof-eh

The normal length of the arrow's been shortened by half and the tip has been fitted with a modified hypodermic needle

Maybe we should think about that 'fore we shed any tears

Like Cesar

Garage door open
Childress chain smokes and drinks beer as he leans against the dented fender of his '66 Lincoln Continental
Trevor nurses a Diet Coke
had the same situation 'round the time of that 'Night Stalker' thing
Remember that
Whole city was scared shitless
My wife was convinced the frickin' mailman was the 'Stalker' for about a week there

Childress is the 'Night Stalker

Even after they caught that Ramirez jerk, 'd still hear those fucks '
They got the wrong guy
Childress is the Stalker, ese

Crumples it
Trevor studies him, without expression
Now he notices something stapled to the tar paper wall
Trevor's  of the "Certificate of Excellence in Teaching," yellowed and dogeared, hanging obliquely by one staple
as Childress opens another beer

Thanks for the soda
Wait, wait

Cabinet door swings wide now, revealing a mini arsenal of handguns

Childress rhapsodizes as he removes and handles some of the guns

Trevor takes it, reluctantly weighs it in the palm of his hand
Sets it down

'Course you can never be too prepared

Lost in a stupid, recalcitrant grin
Haven't you ever just wanted to blow one of these little bastards away
Childress glances up into Trevor's unflinching gaze

That was generous, only taking his finger

All traces of a smile fade from Dave's face
Trevor just stands there
Doesn't say a damn word
Childress makes his own momentous conclusion

You son of a bitch
Awkward glint of admiration in Childress's eye
Leans forward, hangs a hand on Trevor's shoulder

her clenched essay
Now to reveal Rita Nartinez
She wears lipstick
and only a moderate amount of eye shadow
She wears a slightly nervous, preoccupied look
Now
Rita at the podium, as she adjusts the microphone, a nervous reflex
Places her essay on the podium
Stares down at it
The title of my essay is, 'Mi Vida Loca'
'My Crazy Life'
Rita hesitates
Now she gazes out at the graduating class

Garfield done those things they been writin' about in the newspaper
He once tol' me you can't blame everything on yer environment

He was a king back 'round 300
Rita refers to a piece of scratch paper she has tucked inside her essay

as she now empties one last drawer, she dis- covers her teaching credential
Reluctantly picks it up
Holds it for a moment
Now read across the face of the credential
issues this document to 175A                                                   175A (
) (verbatim now) Pyrrhus defeated the Romans on two occasions
But those two victories lost him a large part of his army
Now whenever people say something's a Pyrrhic victory they mean it's a victory gained at too great a cost
Childress stares off into space, flickers a pathetic smirk
And now Stevie seated amongst the graduates
Glancing up from under his mortar board cap
He adjusts a gaze into the bleachers

Ellen standing obliquely in the doorway
Brief- case in hand, files and papers tucked under one arm
Her face, a solemn vacuous gaze
Now she drops something into the trash can, shuts off the lights, and leaves
As the door slowly closes
the trash can
and Ellen's crumpled teaching credential
