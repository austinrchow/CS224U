"'  " Screenplay by James
Brooks 1994 : - The  briskly retreats as ,  , ,   march towards it
Each side of the frame is black as this troupe of young actors moves up the middle, everyone talking, grinning, squealing,
everyone having the "high" of their lives
- As the troupe, with geometric precision, spills into a large room (containing a raised dance floor); the  begins to move past dancing couples as a legend appears: 'This is 1975 and Matt Hobbs is singled out for the first time
' And now the  reveals
His open, friendly, American face slips between some of the many cracks in his profession
The face at 26, and forever more, not arresting enough for a leading man; not quirky enough for a "character
" Matt must briefly walk on the dance floor to make his way past a knot of people
He dances furiously for two seconds, then steps down as      "", but just as the song breaks out musically, we hear the ; the singers falter and then stop as the party-goers gather, in choreographed movement, at a ceiling mounted set
We can barely discern the words
"with his review is Leonard Graff
" yelps a command: can't hear over this shhing
Silence, then: a play about guess what
That's right, young people
He stands next to a ruggedly handsome and extremely nauseous can't look
Good idea, let's not
He begins to walk, the Handsome Contemporary falling into step
Everyone they pass is straining, upwards, at the
How can we not listen to this
We'll know all we need to from the reaction
At that moment, the rest of the party-goers turn from the as one, looking mugged

The mixture of tears and rage are, of course, the chemical components of incredible sexiness
Her name is )     offers an incantation
He should be shot, he should be dead, he should rot in hell, then come back as the soap cake in a urinal
(to dancer) He didn't like it
The  moves through the group, bucking up spirits
Don't worry
He doesn't count
We'll just wait for the papers
- As they morosely watch the Director approach
Hey, no matter what this review says, the play was a great experience for me
Beth looks at him, puzzled
(again) mean, it is about process, right
Matt's right
Good Lord, it is what we're alive for
Beth turns from the conversation, finding it preposterous, then rivets her attention on the Director, walking towards them, holding a ridiculously thick sheaf of papers
Beth begins to sob in anticipation
You've just got to be tougher than this
(incredulous) Tougher than this
The Director reaches them
took it all down over the phone
It's quite bad
And, unfortunately, it's very, very long
've got a broken heart and writers' cramp
He
He's nuts
He savages everyone
don't want to hear anymore
Let's dance
Except you, Matt
They all look at him
(fiercely to Matt) You filthy bastard
(drawing closer to Matt) What did he say
The Director hunts for the paragraph
Don't read it
Oh, please
You can't wait to run out of here, buy a flashlight, and then go into some dark alley and drool over every word
(truthfully) You're wrong
'm maybe relieved and curious
That's it
(wildly exasperated) What did they say about him
(reading) 'in the midst of this delirium of pretension
' Don't
This divisive crap won't
(again) '
one actor, rather miraculously, manages to provide passion and, yes, truth
Matt Hobbs, in the supporting role of Jesus, manages to touch the heart long after you thought it numbed by boredom
' The table of actors look at a sober Matt
long beat and then, against his will, he grins
then a short, involuntary barking laugh of joy
then: (to his colleagues with sincerity) Sorry

She screams out
Will you get in here--for God's sake
Matt, 30, is on the phone

Look,  have to hang up
(
) (screaming voice) It's on right now
right now
right this second
You will miss it

Matt hangs up and tear-asses into the living room
Beth screams as his name is read

And the winner is Powers Boothe for 'Jonestown--Story of a Massacre

Fuck
Shit
He was good
(again) Shit
Shit
Shit
Fuck
Shit
Look, he even showed up
- That took courage
wonder if they send you something for just being nominated
Of all the pathetic questions
(sharply) Why are you being so damn foul
Beth glares at him, on the verge of taking him on--but he is looking at her very directly
the lack of any other agenda giving him a temporary edge
Beth decides to state the unadorned truth
We've been going back and forth on our status for so long
was hoping that if you won, it might mean something for us
Look, Beth
the only
She is waving her hand in a circle
he is puzzled
Please go fast
can't take you dragging it out
(a bit faster) The only reason  haven't
promised myself  wouldn't be so bossy
Take your time
Was that bossy too
(persisting) The only thing  have against getting married is that it might not be fair because 'm going to stay with acting forever and you know how erratic the money's been and there's no resolve
Do  get to vote
'm going to tell you something  never told you before
Your feeling towards your work is one of the things  love most about you
Really
Maybe the most
Hey, then we have no problem here
Marry me
They kiss, then break, murmuring to each other
Stinker,  almost gave up on you
was just worried whether  could make you happy

showing several clusters of waiting people man rushes to one of these clusters, cueing this group to sing the next phrase of ""
As an extremely hyper Matt enters, the   and a legend appears: '1986' (extremely hyper) Everything's okay
Great
She's six or eight pounds even
Oh, God
Nothing like it
'll tell you something amazing
They really reach right into her stomach and pull out this baby
It's not just a rumor
God
understand the expression 'mind blowing' for the first time
It means something so wonderful happens that the top of your head comes off and your brain pops out
Part of it was terrifying, the baby was turned and they couldn't budge her
kept looking at this one woman doctor's eyes
And when Jeannie finally came out, this doctor and each wiped away a tear at the exact same time, caught ourselves doing it, and then laughed together at the same time
Nothing can prepare you for it
You know why you're alive

On Matt's expression

We hear a baby crying over a cheap walky-talky near their bed
Could you get her, honey
have that big reading tomorrow
No,  have a lot to do tomorrow, too
have to borrow on our Christmas Club,  have to
Don't worry about money anymore

But 'm going to get 'Spider Woman'

It's weird, but  just know it

(broadly) Boy, am  reassured
What good news
Isn't that a load off

can't stand this anymore
: '  - It's an awful place

, then: Bleaching his teeth
finishing
smiling in the mirror
This is the bleached smile of fear--true fear--the awful state of having lost your way
The phone rings
Matt clears his voice before answering
(into phone) Hello
Hi, Beth
'm glad you finally returned my call
What are you so mad about
(again, into phone) , ' ,   ,
Matt was so suddenly, emotionally extended that the anger leaves him that quickly
just a strange atypical lightning bolt of rage toward life and women
(again, into phone) You know what
'm being a sort of gutless wonder here
'm yelling back at you because 'm embarrassed
won't be able to take the kid when said
Why don't you listen for a second
He rubs his head with both hands, including the one holding the phone
This allows us to hear his ex-wife repeat the same sentence over and over again
(
) (from phone) You're taking her
You're taking her
You're taking her
Beth,  know exactly how long it's been and  feel strange as hell not seeing her but this isn't a choice
'm broke
It's the driest spell of my life
'm not saying it's your problem, but it's no place for a six- year-old
What can  do
The only full-time job  seem to have is not showing how scared  am
What
No, that's not something  said before
(accepting compliment) Well, thanks
Beth turns angry again
Matt finds, unfortunately, that he's got one more act of bravado left
(again, into phone) Beth, Hey
hey
Never mind, 'll do it
He hangs up
(again, to himself) must get work
will take anything
must get work
must not be embarrassed by these pep talks to myself
- As Matt walks from the outdoor parking lot, past inexpensive homes
In the lot, on private lawns and every public bench, at each street corner, are various actors doing the relaxation exercises which will form the basis of  , as they go over their "sides"
- feathers 'm blowing
What am , a duck
We pass various actors going over alternate sentences for the same speech so that we get a sense of the speech as a whole from the sum of its parts
1) 'm not thinking about whether 'm going to shoot you
'm
2)
trying to decide where
3)
the little spot behind the ear where you die before you hear the shot

The  " " enters fully now and builds in intensity, reaching a repeated phrase, as we move to Matt and he enters the building, thereby cutting off the song
As the  continues in intensity, Matt enters the building at the end of a repeated phrase cutting off the song as we move to: Where  , age 30, waits
Hollywood is a bit of an uphill struggle for Cathy
She is bright where others are brilliant, pretty where others are gorgeous, enormously hard working where others are obsessive-compulsive
She is clearly waiting for someone while reading an enormously thick book galley
Matt almost scoots by her, then stops
Hi
See,  did recognize you
You didn't have to wait for me
Well,  wanted to introduce you
As if knowing me would help
- Staircase packed with actors, an uphill slalom almost impossible to navigate
It's a ridiculously awful movie
Well, challenge
wasn't sure you'd remember me
let alone help
Stop
You're good
'm doing them a favor by getting you in
Well, that's a fresh slant
They reach the casting assistant,
Claire, this is Matt Hobbs
As Matt is handed a set of sides, we   Matt as he watches Cathy move back down the stairs before he can say another word
She moves with wit
He is struck by her
He looks back at Claire, who has an intricate hairdo and a ready smile
Hi
Sorry
We're running behind
Please forgive us
: - Her hairdo wilted, her blouse soiled, her smile gone, the tendons of her neck prominent
(fiercely) Matt Hobbs
Matt Hobbs
Going over his lines
Hearing his name, he rises
Claire gestures him in
'  - The walls are pockmarked with movie posters
sit in an area some distance from the desk
The casting director, , makes the introduction: This is Matt Hobbs
This is John Earl McAlpine, the director
Good to see you
He speaks with an Australian accent, gets half-up and extends his hand
and Burke Adler, the producer
So, what have you been doing with yourself
(checking resume) the last few years
(to Burke) 'm real bad at interviews, so, if you don't mind, 'd really prefer to just read first
That's the way you want to do it
Yes
Maybe we shouldn't even read
'll just take your word that you're good
Matt smiles
No
'm serious
There's all different ways
Did you know Woody Allen never reads actors
He just looks at them, feels around a little and then decides who he wants
That's his way
Doesn't hear them do a line
also have a way
What  do is interview first-- then read--maybe do it all over again the next day
call up people the actor has worked with--check him out
If he's famous,  do an opinion survey to test how much people like him
If he's not famous,  put him on tape and show it to everyone can grab
believe in screen tests; believe in replacing if the dailies are bad, in cutting people out if the previews aren't there
Because 'm not doing movies for theaters where they serve cappucino in the lobby
'm doing popcorn movies
You want to know what  like
Come to my house, look at my lamps
you won't find it in my movies
In my movies, you'll find out what  know
know how to do detail
What  don't know, discover
Yesterday we finished mixing a movie--the last scene is in a field of windmills which blows up and all the blades of these windmills slice through the air, one of which hits a four-story tank of propane gas
humongous explosion scene kept on saying 'louder', and they finally said to me they couldn't go louder without distortion
We went louder
We had to discover a thing, a filter, but we went louder
don't question doing these things
do them
So if you want to know if it's okay to do it differently--not to talk--to just read first
say
(pointing to John Earl) Ask him--he's the director
Whatever
Okay, let's do it
Do you have any questions
They only gave me these two pages
'd like to give this my best shot
So if  could read the script and come back
This part works tomorrow
Oh
Who will  be reading with
Burke indicates Martin
(from his chair) Can  read from here
want you to do it wherever you're comfortable, but 'd prefer it if you were comfortable standing up
Matt rises uncomfortably
enters and hands a note to the director
Time for my buns to have visitors
Matt looks astonished as the director leaves the room
(to Matt) Go ahead
Go ahead
The director left
That's okay, he trusts me, uh
And we're just doing the first page
(cueing him badly) 'Okay, darling Harry, here it is
If someone were breaking up with me, 'd like it short and sweet
What about you
' (reading--showing pain) 'Incredibly drawn out
' ' can't take care of you right now
What am , your mother
' (intense) 'Well, what am
Your duck
' As he gets into the scene he begins to experience some release of the desperate feelings he's been harboring
(again) 'We've been together two years and you act like all you're doing is blowing away some feathers
So what 'm asking
' You didn't do the quack
Huh
The stage direction says for him to quack
know, but why would he quack when someone's breaking up with him
Hopefully because it's funny
This isn't a comedy
Then we're in trouble, because they're already fall down laughing at the teaser-trailer in fifty-two hundred and thirty theaters
comedy
(rubbing his face) think  have to make an adjustment here
'  - We  the strains of the theme of a past hit movie coming from Cathy's cassette player

Cathy is frowning as she reads the last of the galley pages
She overhears some conversation in the adjoining room which begins to disturb her concentration
(
) 'm not supposed to read  pilots
Don't call us -Girls
We're Development Persons
Cathy closes the door, shutting her off
She now begins to fill out a form with a felt-tipped pen
As she does so, the pad is supered on the screen--action seen through it
As she writes, we see the notations on the super
It is marked -- :
: : (the pen writes out) " " / (the pen writes out -)
Then there are columns to check , , ,  for the story
,
The pen checks  for story,  for all else, , , etc
The form then states--     : ' ' The phone rings
As she picks it up and reaches to turn down the volume of the motion picture soundtrack she's listening to
(into phone) Hi
just finished
'll have my coverage right over
It's past derivative
it's photocopying
What a hoot
You're kidding, right
There is truly active bidding for this book
Really
2

Okay, see you
She hangs up and begins to alter the form changing the / to /, and all the other  to and now the Recommend section
The pen is poised
Her soul is poised
beat and she allows "   " to stand, the source music theme--"  "-- coincidentally celebrates this considerable act of heroism
Cathy takes the sheet and walks to the door
- As she approaches her secretary's desk, she overhears two other members of Burke's Development Staff (a 27-year-old well-dressed man and a woman younger than Cathy) as they enthuse
Even the title "Little Dick"--it means so many things
Story, story, story, story, story
(seeing Cathy) You loved it, right
had some problems
Like what
Well, you know, it's a little garbagey
So it has to be cast right
If Cathy doesn't like it, we know it's a smash
(stung) Hey
It's not like  didn't recommend it
She surreptitiously changes her "recommend" as Matt enters
She looks up
How'd it go
didn't get it
He did say something about wanting me back
Good
His saver is he means what he says
Yeah,  just wanted to say thanks
She nods and starts to turn back towards her office
and  wanted to ask you out
The other people in the office stare at Matt
(turns) For when
Any time
never know when 'm free
(Matt nods) It sounds like 'm just
but it's true
Okay
Thanks again
felt funny asking
Well, don't please
meant asking you to get me the audition
Oh
well, don't please
He nods and starts to go
She looks at him
Don't be sad
Matt smiles in astonishment and exits
Who is he
Oh,  was auditing this acting course and he filled in teaching one night
He did a scene himself and he was awesome
For some reason, he can't get arrested
Yeah
He does seem to have a layer of loser dust on him
- Matt drives his faded, seven-year-old car into view
/
'  - He looks off
sees something that arrests his interest and pulls to the curb
It's a curious sight
' Burke Adler, standing at a street corner, palpably in pain
He's trying to rein in his emotions, sucking in huge gulps of air
and, then, a wave of emotion gets the better of him as he looks at his watch
sob escapes him--shocked that he's so close to tears on a public street corner, he battles for control
another sob as he looks to the heavens
split second to consider, then he's out of his car
- flow of --in the foreground, the tortured figure of Burke Adler--in the background, Matt Hobbs, pauses before intruding
But Burke's spectacle is growing more public, sounds of anguish escape him
- Oh, God
why
Why
(louder) What am  going to do
And now he begins to dissassemble, openly crying--on the verge of a complete breakdown
Matt moves into frame, grabbing Burke, trying to provide him with an anchor
His face--his eyes providing a beacon of strength
Hey
Hey
Totally fucked-up, wild-eyed
As he witnesses his own state
Look at me
You'd think  was a writer
(his story of travail pours from him) hired this kid as a production assistant
His father's a business manager
a few good clients
What happened
He's been driving for me two weeks
all he has to do is pick me up on time
he's twenty minutes late and have a test screening in the valley
Everybody's gone from the office
Burke flails at himself as Matt looks at him
Is that it
You need a lift
Yeah
'm right over here
Matt starts to lead him back, then realizes he's alone, Burke having seen his car finally arrive
' Burke, berating the
Matt pauses, awed by the wild gesticulating--the few screamed words
(
) Not just today
believe me, there's no way you'll ever make it
You are going to fail
Listen, listen-- know about this; you are going to be a failure
As he joins Burke and the young man, Burke turns to Matt
(to Matt) Let's get moving; you said you'd give me a lift
What the hell are you talking about
Not in your car
've got my own
'll give you a hundred and twenty dollars to take me
and it will still be a favor
(to Young Man) Get out
Come on
(to Matt) Please
This is very important
The driver gets out
(final plea) guy got shot on the freeway
Traffic's tied up
You should leave time for that kind of thing
: ' What do you need me for
Don't you drive
(a mumble) Yeah,  drive
don't like to look for parking
- The sun setting on a nondescript slab of California
'  - The two men
Matt feeling very peculiar in this line of work
Burke's tension renders him arresting, handsome even
The look of generals who go forth against long odds
He takes an enormous cleansing breath
It startles Matt
(explaining) Yoga shit
feel like barbed wire
don't know if you keep track, but 'm the sixth independent producer ever to have two big pictures scheduled for Christmas, and tonight we're testing the first one for the first time
You get it
Yeah
It's important to you
(laughing at the understatement) Yes
don't think  would have put it that way
but, yes
- Burke's car moves toward the movie complex
' Our first view of  ; middle-aged and pragmatic, yet extraordinarily naive
She's a scientist of sorts-- monitoring the tastes and feelings of Americans, first in Washington and now here
Though she just had a very rough hour or so, she bends down to smile at Burke
' Keep driving
She runs the test screenings
Very smart
Very
She has a real case on me, but so far 've been keeping it in the bank
He stops talking, stops breathing, as he sees
'  - The line consists of disparate, disinterested people who are focused on their own small, personal dramas--not at all cognizant of the fact that they hold a life in their hands
They are clearly growing impatient
Go very slow
Burke steels himself and exits the car
- We're 34 minutes late
The studio is appropriately wild
people are beginning to leave
but  knew how upset you'd be if we started without you
(distantly) Yeah
Thanks
But he pays her no mind as   and he moves towards the line
Nan approaches the car
How is he tonight
don't know him, so  have nothing to compare it to
Well, how would you say he is, anyway
Not quite himself
As he approaches the line, he    his love to them, "'ll Do Anything
" As he pours out his misdirected heart to individuals on the line who
Their impatience gives rise to a    , each couple or cluster doing it differently--barely exaggerating the normal shifting of a line
As
the song builds as does the dance
Burke sings even more passionately, his - perhaps joining in as At a key point, the disparate groups turn and form a
They begin the rhythmic clapping of impatience--having become a line, they now threaten to become a mob
Burke sings one more Joe Cocker-like passionate plea before turning to camera to shout over the mayhem: Let them in
As they enter
- Nan is addressing the audience from down front
The name of the picture you'll be seeing is 'Ground Zero'
There may be some scratches
some of the colors may be off, there are no final titles, and it has not been finally mixed for sound, and the music is temp, that means temporary
As she says this: Where Burke spies the   and leaves Matt's side
As  enters the frame behind him
He is right behind his boss' ear
He leans in and offers an intimacy
'm glad you came yourself instead of sending your staff
The boss is startled--jumps
eyes him
there must be some way to profit from these stolen moments with a powerful man
wouldn't be surprised if tonight's screening is a monster
(emphatically) Could happen, right
Sure
Okay
He moves back to Matt and Nan at the rear of the audience
(to Matt) Eisner just said he thinks the screening will be a monster
Strangely, Burke seems truly buoyed by the words of encouragement he himself manufactured
He moves down three rows and sits in an aisle seat just as the film opens with a series of violent explosions
Please, God, let tonight give him peace
Incredibly, Burke turns and gestures to her that the sound of her small voice is interfering with the cacophony of his movie
Nan is clearly stricken by her lapse as she whispers to Matt
We're short two card-counters, can you two help out
- 1:47:20 We are seeing one of the final moments of the film
' ( ) - As the muscular hero moves with stealth through the giant refrigerated meat door
He passes cows and dead men hanging from alternate hooks
Suddenly, he is attacked by the villain brandishing an electric meat dismembering tool
The hero ducks, the machine ripping apart hanging cow flesh
The hero grabs the only weapon he can find: a large piece of meat on a large bone, which he uses as a mace
He clubs the other man--then again--and again
Part of the audience is whooping and applauding
Standing with Matt and Cathy
At the sound of the applause, Nan grins and mumbles with a connoisseur's knowledge
Males, fifteen and under
Where the hero stands over the man whose face he has shattered, holding a club from which hang strings of meat
He is breathing heavily, and between breaths, states: Sorry to bust your chops
General audience laughter
- If you'll just stay in your seats a few moments and fill out these cards for us
Matt and others handing out cards with pencils attached
Folks filling them out
As an   fills it out; as we view ' An office meant for two, containing twenty counters
The counting is done with erasers rifling stacks, creating a sound, a  , as the   calls out with gospel cadence
Who has young males
Young women
Older males
Older males
Matt, his tally finished, squats on the floor, waiting
The Group Captain approaches
Older males
older males
Matt looks blank
(again) Older males
over 25
Matt now realizes that it is his category and hands over the older male cards and exits
- Burke, prowling the lobby as audience stragglers leave and Studio Execs and Popcorn Development Staff wait
He looks off to see Matt and Nan chatting in another part of the lobby
As they arrive
Nan looks off to see the Group Captain approach
How long since you've seen your daughter
little over two years
(on her look) My wife insisted on moving back to the Midwest--then  was in the Philippines on the mini-series and
(suddenly and loudly) Oh, please
It's one thing being a son-of-a-bitch, but you don't have to be a stupid son-of-a-bitch
People move heaven and earth to see their kids
don't care if she moved to Pluto, it's abandonment
(a pause, then) Hey, we just met
(realizing) Oh
Sorry
Make a guess how we did
It wouldn't mean anything
Nothing good that happens can make it worth feeling the way  do now
Nothing
An   approaches them
Excuse me
Who the hell are you
This is private
'm Mr
Eisner's mother
Oh
Can  get you some water
No, thank you
The Group Captain approaches and hands Nan a sheet
Everyone, all the studio and Popcorn staff, is drawn to Nan
As she glances at the figures
' As she secretly reaches for and holds Burke's hand
Is it in sympathy or congratulations
As we see in ever-so- , tense lips turning gloriously upward to reveal gums--then a smile
More smiles as we pan across teeth
bonded executives and bonded teeth
The shot widens
The studio head mumbles to himself as he carefully goes over the tally in every category
Then: don't need the numbers
loved it
His smiling face takes us: Burke, ninety in the top two boxes
tear in his eye--a smile shyer than others
He turns to the old lady, instinctively using this victory to settle his most recent score as he says mockingly: Now can  get you some water
- Cathy and Matt are leaning against Burke's car
Cathy is distraught--temporarily, but horribly, unsure of herself
Matt is looking at her
If he had a little more confidence going for him right now, he would make his move
But, for now, they are two self-doubters on different trips
never thought it would do this well
There were so many holes; told everybody it wasn't going to do business
Why am  so public with my opinions
You might be right
Not with that score
You know, maybe tonight's the night 'm losing my entire mind, but weren't you in 'Platoon
' Incredible
was only there for a minute in the rape scene, moving past Charlie Sheen when  left the hut
had a great scene cut out

But there was that one long close up-- where you seemed ashamed of yourself but still arrogant
That's exactly what  was going for
It reminded me of my last boyfriend
(indicating book bag) Got to go
She hefts the bag--puts it back down--crosses her eyes, burlesquing the weight of the bag
He helps her put it on her shoulder
You have to read all that
Beast of burden
(sincerely) So what are you, totally wonderful or what
She smiles and is gone, staggering a bit under the weight of her scripts
Matt looks after her
Burke and Nan approach
How come you haven't said anything
This is great, right
No
What no
The definite recommends are way off for a score this high and, even for action-adventure, it's just too low for women
(Burke looks anguished) 'm sorry
He leans against the car for support
It was such a good score
(extraordinarily sympathetic) know
And, unfortunately, yesterday's tracking wasn't
(he reacts) 'm sorry
They just don't seem in the mood for action-adventure right
(he reacts) Sorry
May  tell you one more thing
(he looks up in anticipatory fear) think it's so wonderful that you don't worry about even trying to act strong
Thanks
You want to eat something sometime
'm, uh
'm blushing from head to foot
Good
'll call you
As Burke moves to his car
He  the Group Captain paying Matt
Thirty-two, thirty-three
Burke is looking at Matt with some surprise
You want to do this regularly for me
was gonna offer, but  thought it would humiliate you
(straight at him) don't mind an occasional odd job
But  can't work tomorrow
have to get my kid
As they get in the car, Burke has the front door open, about to get in--reconsiders, and gets in the rear door
Okay,  got the cards to look at-- think 'll ride back here
(to Nan) Maybe 'll drop by your place tomorrow
Matt gets behind the wheel, thereby ending the day as a full- fledged chauffeur
They drive off
- Burke and Nan returning from lunch
So, thanks for lunch
hope this leads to an evening date
Though have to stay home with my daughter, Leslie, on Saturdays
(sincerely) Yeah, okay
You were very interesting to talk to
swear to God
Honest
No kidding
You really were
believe you
(sincerely) And  was very surprised what you were like when you weren't working
There was absolutely no difference
You want to see where we do the tracking
(excited) Is it okay
- The enter the room containing a maze of telephone cubbies with workers manning the phones
Nobody ever wants to see how we do the polling, but they're like little starved puppies when the data comes in--running at you, scrambling to
Burke hardly hears
He is awed as if by a cathedral
1) How often do you go to the movies
2) 'm going to describe a movie in one sentence and then ask you to rate it on a scale of
(as the workers continue) love this
This is what counts and this is where you count it
(soft and true) That's the same way  feel
You phone all over--you know what movies they're waiting to see, whether your  spots are working
You know what the country thinks
what feelings do you have about Cher as a singer, an actress, or potential date
(again) and it's accurate
Within six-point-eight percent
And you can't fix it
right
No
no
Sometimes just for myself, can't resist asking America a personal question
Like
(simply) When do you feel more worthless-- mornings or afternoons
gotta get back
They pause by a workers to say goodbye
Assume Michelle Pfeiffer is the woman-- which of these 67 actors would you most like to see her with
Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves, Dustin Hoffman, Johnny Dep, the guy from 'Major Dad'
There's something  meant to tell you
You may have noticed something unusual about me
gotta get back
could never find the right time to
Is this urgent
Well, maybe not urgent, but immediately significant and necessary to tell
(a deep breath) You see, there's these pills
'Cause  gotta go
'm listening with an eighth of an ear now
So long
He exits as the telephone pollster continues with the list of prospective Michelle Pfeiffer male co-stars
Matt, wearing earphones, is in the middle of a row of five, intent on what he is watching
' recent example of a great actor in a regular movie
something like Brando in "The Freshman
" No sound
Watching intently
Not watching--studying
not studying-- fully appreciating
Now he sees a particularly good moment-- looks around joyously for half a beat--a reflex to share what he saw
His neighbors, not quite knowing what he's smiling at; he returns his attention to the screen
-  - As Matt's cab pulls up
He opens the front gate and walks up to the porch, noting a tricycle, stirred by old guilts
He knocks on the door
answers
Are you Matt
Uh-huh
didn't know if we could wait much longer
Come on in
He lights a cigarette, takes three quick drags, then flicks it away before walking inside behind Matt
(again) She's a real nut on smoking anywhere near the kid
- They enter
bedroom down a narrow hallway from where they stand
Remember "The Best Years of Our Lives"
Frederic March coming home from the wars and seeing his wife just a beat before she sees him
Here we have a wretched mutant of that moment
Beth, still fierce and attractive, is packing her daughter's suitcase when she senses him and looks up
Shaking her head with a disapproval which will never die, she walks to him
Hello--did you two meet
Not really
Is she ready
have the taxi waiting
just have to say goodbye
You have no idea how difficult that is
It's three weeks
It's not three weeks
Yes, it is
No, it's not
Several beats--Beth and the man staring at Matt
It is
He doesn't know
You are not taking her for a visit
You are taking her for a while
Just because you want to go off with him doesn't mean
You're getting the wrong idea
don't think so
No matter how you put this
Hey, look, 'm a United States Marshal
'm here because she didn't show up yesterday to start serving her time
don't have a choice
You don't have a choice
She turns and starts for the other room
What did she do
(turning) loved, helped and supported in every possible way a business man who committed the terrible crime of being financially imaginative with a pension fund
She exits
He sits down, stunned in the headlights of his fate
- Matt and the Marshal in the foreground as Beth talks to Jeannie in the background
We see only glimpses of them
Beth's face as she leans towards Jeannie from one side of the doorway--just Jeannie's legs dangling on the other side
' Okay, listen carefully, Jeannie
Be still
Now, what's the most important thing in life to know
No one will ever love me as much as you do
Matt and the Marshal exchange a look of mutual horror
Good
Now, concentrate with all your muscles and remember everything 'm about to say to you
The Marshal and Matt shift uncomfortably
Don't talk to strangers
They may be killers
Take your vitamins so the poison in the food can't hurt you
What else now
' Teeth
' Right
Thank you
Brush right after you eat or your gums will start to bleed in your sleep and choke you
The Marshal and Matt can stand no more--they each call to her
"Beth
Beth
Mrs
Hobbs
Beth
" She looks out and then walks to them
What
'm giving Jeannie her reminders
Reminders
You can't say things like that to a little
No
Don't
No
Don't dare
Don't criticize the way  mother or  think 'll start to scream and never st
Mrs
Hobbs
(suddenly cheery) Yes
You know, 've been involved with this sort of thing for a long time
You're not going to criticize me, are you
Not in front of him--because all he's done is send Jeannie these long, stupid letters
He doesn't even realize she can't read
He sends letters to someone who can't read
(laughs) It's almost funny
thought you'd read them to her
(realizing) Oh
'm not faulting you
You love your daughter and this is a very tough thing to go through
You feel guilty and caring and it all gets mixed up so that there's so much important stuff going down that there's no sure way of dealing with it, but the best thing you can do is just make sure you love her
Typical cop talk
(on his look) But  understand what you're trying to say
Thank you
Can  have another minute with her
She returns to the doorway which still only provides us with glimpses as she , "'
" The down the hallway to  , trying to puzzle things out as she sits amongst a ridiculous number of suitcases
- As the two females who bear his name approach
Matt doesn't want a pregnant first moment with Jeannie, so he wards off silence with chatter
Unfortunately, he can only think of one word
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi
(laughing mirthlessly) Hello, monster-poop
(to
Marshal) She has her mother's sense of humor
Beth stops him with a look, then bends down
Okay, love, Mommy's going to help others who need her for a few years, and you're going with Daddy as explained
(to Marshal and Matt) We'll all have to help with the luggage
'  -  - All three adults and Jeannie sharing the burden of the luggage as they move towards the cab
Mother and child hug
Matt struck by his child's plight, him
(turning to Matt) Beginning now, you must give less value to your own happiness and well- being, then hopefully, you will reach the point where you give that no value whatsoever
Give her everything
There's no such thing as spoiling a child
Even if you have to steal to do it
You don't really want to mess with me, do you
(simple honesty) No
(to Jeannie) Okay, sweetie
We have to go
(to Beth) want to go with you
Can't, pretty-heart
'm sorry
Tears fall from Jeannie's eyes
Not even a compromise
(thinking) The compromise will be that you don't have to ride in back; you can ride up front with the driver
okay
What
Okay
As Beth buckles Jeannie into the front seat, Matt gets in the back, alone, feeling preposterous
Beth nods to the Marshal, who surreptitiously handcuffs her
(to driver) Can we please go
- The cab pulls away
Matt leans towards her as she looks back at the receding figure of her mother and grows still
As she sings him one last line of "'
" - Matt checks Jeannie's luggage, then takes her hand
She lets him
He is grateful
It's going to be okay
'm you're dad, you know
So it will be okay
You and  will make it okay
You ever ridden in a plane before
(a sudden gust of anger) Yesssss
- Jeannie and Matt in the center two seats of a five seat row
Jeannie is coloring in a book which Matt bought her; he is holding some extra crayons
Don't stare at me
Sorry
want to put on my yellow dress now
It's underneath the plane
We can't get it
And just that quick, Jeannie screams
want to put on my dress
want to put on my dress
Other passengers turn around
This is pretty raw stuff we're into
Temper in all its wildness,
electric guitar beginning to match the energy and naked emotion of the child
There's no way we can get the dress-- it's impossible
Jeannie's feet start kicking in front of her--the person in that seat turning sharply around
Don't kick the seat
want the yellow dress
(a shriek) Give me a compromise
She is crying now
As soon as we land
That's the compromise
Without warning, Jeannie slaps herself in the face
All five people in the row ahead turn and say in unison: Don't hit her
God,  didn't hit her--she hit her
As everyone starts pushing the cabin attendant call button
These dings magnify until they're part of the music--as it drives and drives
Matt takes Jeannie's hand and tries to restrain her
Noooooo
Let go of me
Noooo
The yellow dress
let go
let go
She breaks away from him
He moves after her
At breakneck speed, Jeannie dashes through the plane with her father in pursuit
flashes of disapproving faces
The seat belt sign goes on
blocks his path
You'll have to sit down
Jeannie takes advantage of Matt's being stopped and moves into the toilet, locking the door behind her
(yelling) Jeannie, we have to sit down
Please
' We'll be having some turbulence for the next twenty minutes or so
Will the cabin attendants please take their seats
Sir
(simply and utterly) have no idea what to do
sudden bump and Matt falls
He yells to the locked door
Jeannie, you okay
Go back to your seat
'll get her
As Matt makes his way back, the Flight Attendant uses a hidden latch to open the door
Music building--then calming, the worst is over
Matt makes his way back to his seat, shell- shocked
The Attendant leans over him
She wants to be alone
So we're upgrading her
He just nods
Down the aisle--Jeannie lets an Attendant lead her as she peers back at her dad
- Matt carrying the sleeping child like a sack over his shoulder, also managing to hold onto all her luggage
'  - He has propped her on the sofa, a cotton nightgown out
He is unbuttoning her dress
She opens her eyes, the window's protective bars
She attempts to cover her fear
These are the wrong jammies
Okay
so what do we do
Jeannie mimics him perfectly under her breath
She goes to an open suitcase and throws things on the floor until she finds the right jammies
Where do  sleep
have a sleeping bag and bed
Which one do you want
She surveys her pitiful choice; then points to the sleeping bag
That
She gets into it
He zips her up--then she says something remarkably unexpected
Hug
Amazed, Matt hugs her
half-beat, then: (sharply) Let go
He does--then stands and looks down at her
She looks back, mocking his stare with one of her own
- Nan uncertainly enters this decidedly masculine bathroom
She is wearing an evening gown
The sun streams through the lush foliage outside a wall-sized window
as she opens her purse and removes a pillbox; at one point lightly singing a snatch of lyric concerning the conflicts of being a single woman and a single mother--this while totally focused on the pills
- major movie shot of this compartmentalized box
Each burrowed nest clearly labeled for the pill it contains: ,  , , , , , , ,
She dials a phone number while arching her neck and swallowing one pill after another with little swigs of water
This process continuing, even as she speaks into the phone
Monica--is Leslie up yet
Good didn't want you to get worried when you realized  wasn't there
'm still with that man
'll tell you about it later
But it's sure nice to have wobbly legs again
Look, today's recycling day for Leslie at school, so give her some empty cans
well, then dump some out for her
Tell her  had to leave real early for work and 'll pick her up at school myself to make up for it and we'll rent any cassette she wants for tonight
Thank you
Take good care
She hangs up
Another snatch of lyric as she bends to brush her teeth with her finger; prepares herself and opens the door to greet her new lover
'   - Burke sits on the edge of the bed, fearful
He sees her
Oh,  thought you took off in the middle of the night
She moves quickly to him
No
just had to call home
Is that why you're sad
No
It's Everett
This kid who used to work for me
He was always crazy to do his own movie
(fearing worst) What happened
(very down) His movie not only opened to a three million dollar Friday--it's gotten great reviews
Nan is dumbfounded; still she puts a hand on him, actually consoling him for his hideous thought--Hollywood lovers: he, wrapped up with ill thoughts of others; she, feeling intimate, yet severely compromised
Cupid's work is done
(again) Listen
'm tremendously worried about 'Ground Zero' because of the bad 'want to sees' you sent over
But that's just me being nervous over nothing, isn't it
No
That's just you correctly assessing the situation
So stop being so hard on yourself
He eyes her, then: '  - We hear a muffled argument between Matt and Jeannie coming from inside their apartment
Then the door opens and Matt, holding Jeannie by the hand, moves down the hall to the next door and knocks
(: Jeannie is dressed in layers of varied clothing--some of the layers play clothes, some fit for a coronation
She is a pocket contemporary Annie Hall
her style so much her own it transcends judgement
Her hair is unkempt
The door opens revealing Lucy, an Hispanic woman in her mid-30s
How're you doing
'm from next door
see you with your kids in the laundry room
Hello
(seeing Jeannie, turns warmer) Who are you
Jeannie is a bit shy
Say, 'Hello, 'm your new neighbor now too
' Jeannie says nothing
'm Lucy Crisala
What's your name
Jeannie says nothing
Say, 'Jeannie
' The form of the conversation is forged
Jeannie not answering anything
Matt bending over to Jeannie while he forms her answers to Lucy
have a little girl too
Say, 'Isn't that nice
How old is she
' She's four and a half and  have a little boy who is not yet one year
Say, 'That's nice
'd like to play with them
My Daddy didn't know your phone number, so we just decided to
' (interrupting) What can  do for you
Say 'Daddy has to go to work tonight and
' (catching himself and looks directly at Lucy) need someone to help me and her on short notice
've seen your around with your kids and hoped you knew someone in the building or close by
've got this new job that starts now
Do you know anyone
Well, 'm always here
could maybe do it myself
(there is a God and a good one at that) Oh, this is so great
Let's work out a full-time schedule and
Wait
Jeannie, why don't you come in for a minute and meet Ricky and Essa
Come on, we're making fruit bars
Jeannie walks into the apartment past her father
(again, to Matt) Why don't you leave her for a while and then we talk
Sort of a test
We'll just see how it works
'  - Play-pen in the middle of the floor
Jeannie stands there staring at Essa who is playing with her little brother
Matt moves to embrace Jeannie who cranes away from him
He stays with it, whispering in her ear
Please behave, understand
don't know what we'll do if this doesn't work, so behave, sweetheart
Behave, behave
As he exits towards his own apartment
: '
- 20 Matt is extraordinarily anxious
Then he  loud crying and screaming from next door
There is a stab of despair
Matt deflates, then resigned, exits
- The sound of screaming now louder
He walks to Lucy's door, takes a breath and knocks
The door opens and Lucy stands there looking rattled
'm sorry  bothered you
(calling inside) Jeannie
Could  have her a little bit longer
My little boy just fell and Jeannie is the only one he let hold him
devil's weight lifted from his shoulders
The slap-happy smile of the just saved plastered on his face
Your little boy fell, so he's screaming
And you want her to stay
Lucy, confused by his buoyant reaction, nods
Okay
Seven dollars an hour
Great
Thank you
See you later, Jeannie
He tries to kiss her, but she shuns him
Lucy, now having an official status, turns to admonish her
No, that's okay
'm fine with it feel fine
- Burke walks tight little circles near Cathy and the rest of his staff while a few feet away Studio Executives stand in a cluster
There is a ,
Burke walks past Cathy
Nothing good that happens tonight can make it worth feeling the way do right now
Nothing
(turning to Cathy) What do you think
(nervously taking the plunge) To be honest,  had problems with 'Ground Zero
' But this 'People Get Hurt' one, while it might not be my exact, exact thing,  think will really work for an audience
It's so over the top, you have a great time
So you think it'll score big
Yes
- Where we discover the
Some twenty card- counters on the floor riffling through stacks of cards with erasers
Matt and Nan stand in the doorway
Don't worry
My daughter used to throw fits in supermarkets when we first moved here
It's all so perfectly normal
Plus  know a great psychiatric children's group
That's what breaks your heart
Jeannie's problem is that she's so down on herself
Well, she's lucky to have a daddy who cares, believe me
don't know if lucky's the word
'm hoping she's asleep when  get home so  won't have to deal with her
'm actually afraid of my own kid
Oh, my
've had exactly that feeling and never said it out loud
See, there are men who talk my language and 'm just cursed that 'm not attracted to them because they are so nice they remind me of myself
Matt laughs
In the b
g
, the counting is completed
Excellents
Seven
Very goods
14
Fairs
30
Poors
Just a second
(finishes counting) 666
The Group Captain notes the figure on a sheet, walks to the doorway and hands it to Nan, who is still deep into conversation with Matt
She begins walking back to the theater without looking at the sheet in her hand
felt terrible about the way  blew up at you when  first met you
(before he can object) Please
-   - Burke and others waiting as Matt and Nan come to a stop some distance away
What are they doing
began taking anti-depressants when we moved here from Washington
had some small reactions--sleeping 14 hours, no libido,  gained 17 pounds in nine days--that sort of thing
So they gave me pills to deal with the side effects
And then pills to deal with the side effects  was getting from those pills
All this besides the stuff the nutritionist was giving me
The combination formed some sort of potion so that  keep telling the truth
don't have a choice
That's why  was so rude to you
Your doctor says this
Oh, yes
He's excited, but only because he sees glory for himself in it
See, ordinarily  wouldn't say that about my doctor, but  can't help it, it's the truth
He's monitoring me for a while longer before writing it up for this medical journal
Cathy has joined them
Burke's going crazy waiting for the score
Coming
(to Matt) How are you, anyway
Matt shifts, figuring out his answer
(a small laugh) It's a tough one, huh
Me too
Nan looks down at the score
Oh, my
Matt, 'd better drive him myself
She starts for Burke
As Nan arrives and hands the Studio Executives the score, Burke looking over their shoulders
can fix this
Get some narration written
(turning to Director) You'll cut 30 minutes
It will come out like butter
We're only 77 minutes now
(mumbling to himself) a 47-minute movie
no, that won't work
have to go
have a nanny problem
Priorities, right
Thanks for the support
She kisses his cheek and leaves
beat of silence
Burke turns to Nan
(again) Can you help
Exactly the moment Nan has been waiting for
she does have a valuable observation to offer at this dark moment
Yes,  can
(hopeful) Go ahead
It's only a movie
As Burke looks at her from the depths of his pain and sees her confidently believing that she has imparted something of value, the movie's marquee lights go off giving us a: : '  - As he carries an enormously resistant Jeannie, wearing a borrowed -shirt nightie, back towards his apartment
Matt has Jeannie under one arm--her clothes and shoes in another
Jeannie's arms are extended towards Lucy, who stands in the open doorway of her apartment
She begins thrashing
Giant tears come--the moment is operatic
Let go
Please, Lucy, don't make me go
Everyone's tired
You can come back tomorr
Listen to me, Jeannie
want to live here with these people
God, let me live here
Maybe if she stayed tonight she
love it here so much that
Now her father's last words have registered on her--she immediately stops crying, though tears still roll down her cheeks
Daddy says  can stay
Jeannie wriggles away towards Lucy's doorway
Lucy takes several steps toward Matt, who obviously fears the looming exchange
no think you can give her what pleases when she act like this
Because then she think
Matt is very much like a fighter taking a great deal of punishment, knowing he is beaten, but being told by his corner he must make a fight of it
He nods his head repeatedly in agreement
know
know
Now he sniffs the air in quick rhythm, hoping to draw in some courage and resolve
He moves to Jeannie
You'll see Lucy in the morning
We're going home
No
'm not
'  - As they enter and Matt pushes her into the other room and closes the door, placing her in there alone
- Jeannie, behind the double glass-paneled doors of the bedroom
Matt, upset in a way he has never imagined, as he pops a beer--puts on some headphones for calming music and begins to read a book on child behavior modification
Feeling the restrictions of her punishment, pacing and now she begins to wail "  "
Few adult women have sung with such appropriate passion out of need and loss, aloneness and confusion
The song finishes
Jeannie sits huddled
: - This rooftop serves as an outdoor commissary for Popcorn Pictures
There are a few tables, snack machines and umbrellas
The whole "" staff is there, including Cathy, having lunch, along with Claire, the casting assistant
In the b
g
, we see Matt, huddled, sitting on the roof's awful green outdoor carpeting, feeling much the same as Jeannie in the previous scene
Off in the distance, the Popcorn execs contentedly ply their trade
As he overhears their conversation and the words begin to register in all their horror
Will somebody take a minute to look over my casting list before Burke gets here
(scanning list) This isn't so great, Millie
Well,  wanted to put in people we had a shot at getting
(reading from list) Murray Abraham, Jeff Daniels, Ed Harris, John Lithgow, Rip Torn, Willem Dafoe, John Malkovich
For an action lead
Could you at least take it one person at a time instead of
Okay
Let's play 'State the Obvious'
Murray Abraham has a nose as long as an Aspen ski line, Ed Harris is losing his hair, Joe Mantegna has never played the lead in a big movie
Willem Dafoe's teeth
Bob Hoskins looks fur bearing when he takes off his shirt
Malkovich
Matt can take it no more
He hears a loud voice coming from his own throat
He wigs out
can't stand it anymore
can't
What's wrong
What happened
What, in God's name, are you doing in this job you have
As they all start to answer at once
mean him
What, in God's name, do you know about casting
Me
Matt rises and walks towards the Male  Person
Yes
What do you know
About anything
You don't even know you have a habit of touching your tongue with a finger like you want to lick yourself
(note: this is his little habit) Yet, you talk like you actually know something
So  want you to tell me
(louder) what you know
'm not going to be drawn into this
've been an actor most of my life and this is the first time 've ever heard what the people calling the shots sound like when they're casting
So  really want to find out what, if anything, you know because what if nothing you know
don't think the yelling is necessary
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong
And 'm not talking to you
And  don't like you
How about you just mind your own business
Matt is very close to him--he shakes his chair
You're minding my business
That's the problem
so, just tell me, what do you know
Matt's manner is threatening
The Male  Person looks around for some support and finds little
then Matt's tone changes
it's reasonable, almost seductive
Just tell me and 'll shut up
(taking the bait) First of all, 've been going to movies since  was six, for God's sake
What you know is the size of a schnozz
What you don't know is that these guys
(indicates list) are for real
She is a ricochet victim of every word Matt says, as he continues to indict the Male  Person and unknowingly reach her instead
His fury grows and becomes more complicated, containing an element of mourning
(again) that they can make something happen, and even they don't know what that is till they get in there and play a little
they can make something happen that you can't even imagine
and it's not your fault, this stupidity
'cause you're just this scared little prick who gets to say he's making movies, and the only thing they ever taught you is that what you like doesn't matter
(frightened) Thanks for understanding
The anger leaves Matt
He is depleted
But isn't it almost good manners for you to feel a little shame
Cathy rises and begins to exit
(again) didn't mean you
If you didn't, you sure should have
She exits
The  Person's Colleagues have taken advantage of the beat to egg him on
You talk about manners--are you actually so bitter you don't realize how you acted just now
You're gone, pal
But at least know that we can't help that we're making it
Oh, shit
You win
You got lucky with 'bitter
' That word just scares me to death
- distraught Cathy is walking down as Burke bounds up
You look down
am
Thank you
appreciate the support
'm not down for you
'm down about myself
(not hearing) Oh
What if 'Ground Zero' doesn't do well this weekend
Please listen to me
He nods, but she pauses, disconcerted
What
just got this feeling of seeing myself talking to you and how this is the most important moment of
ever
(brusquely) Okay
Good
What is it
've been watching this company make movies that cost tens of millions of dollars and all the while 've known about this wonderful script which we can somehow own and we could make for about $14,000,000
$3,000,000 if you can live without stars or a name director
Is that it
Okay, send me
've sent you coverage on it nine times
swear to you, Burke, it will work
You've never heard me say that
How about last night
(an unexpectedly fierce outburst) don't know anything about action- adventure
(on his look, she gains control) have no idea where that came from
Hey,  know everyone thinks  don't have any commercial sense because of what  said at the 'Gremlins' preview and all
And you think  can't put myself on the line
Well, if this picture doesn't work, fire me
Have me killed if it doesn't get good reviews
If this doesn't get a 70 percent definite recommend from women 49 and under,  promise to be your sex slave until they drop ticket prices back to five bucks and start enforcing the  rating
You're selling very excellent
Very excellent presentation
You've got to do this
think this movie can save me
(disgusted) Oh, please
What's the script
'Mr
Deeds Goes to Town
' '  - As Matt exits his car with beaten down body language
- As he leads Jeannie briskly down the hall from Lucy's apartment and into his own
Why couldn't you even look at the way  dressed Ricky
Look,  don't want to talk about it
just had a real rough day
so just let it sit there, okay
But what was it
Tellll me
Compromise
You sad
Yes
(through gritted neck cords) Now,  really need to be quiet
(eyes him, then) You
know what will cheer you up
Moving very quickly and with great purpose, she slaps a tape into a pink child's cassette player and
Jeannie sings along with the child's chorus on the tape, "   ", making, with little hand motions, the last thing Matt needs, but, in due course, he starts to actually make a bit of transitional progress out of his own troubles and into the fact that his daughter is beguiling
But, before the mood can fully sweeten, Jeannie forgets the lyrics and begins to verbally assault herself as the tape continues to play
can't even remember the words am stupid
No, you're not
You're not stupid and 'm not bitter
and you know why
Because there's no cure for either one and we've got to believe in some cure for each of us
am stupid
can't even remember the words to some baby song
Oh, Jeannie
just can't do this now
The phone rings
As he goes to answer it
(into phone) Hello
Yes
Cathy
Hey
Just a second
His mood has changed
It's a fine sign that Cathy has called him at home
He needs only for his child to take pity and listen to him
Jeannie, please
be quiet for one second
this is very important for me
She decides, with some difficulty, to let him continue
(into phone) So
Wow
Good for you
Congratulations
Jeannie mouths the words, "Who is it
" Matt holds up a finger asking her to wait
Me
This is great
'll come right over and pick up the script
Okay
If you want to
Bring it over
Goodbye
(to Jeannie) We might make it yet, kid
'  - As Cathy drives past some rough examples of street life, and finally finds Matt's building with its grim iron gate security system
Cathy, uncomfortable in these surroundings, parks her car, brushes her hair, while, at the same time, putting in place a phony cheap-car-radio-sticker over her own expensive system, and gets out
'
- She buzzes his apartment and waits
' Cathy
Yes
' 'll buzz you in
You've got to be quick and push hard
In the b
g
Jeannie loudly imploring her father to make the person wait till she's finished dressing
There is the   the buzzer
Cathy hurls herself at the door a good four times before finally timing it right and gathering the necessary strength to spill through
'  - Cathy stands there overhearing the voices from inside
' But why can't  stay just a little while
' Because this is a very special friend of Daddy's and  need privacy
Be fair
let you wear that dress
Cathy knocks
Matt opens the door
Hi
He steps aside so Cathy may enter
The place is tidied up
He has changed his clothes and Jeannie is wearing a lace dress, fit for a young princess, complete with flowered tiara and ballet slippers, with trailing blue ribbons at the heels and a velvet cape
This is my daughter, Queen Elizabeth
Jeannie, this is Cathy
Hi
What a pretty dress
Thank you
That's nice
Happy that Jeannie is behaving so well
Are you going to a party
(wildly hopeful) Am  going to a party, Dad
(quickly) No
You're going next door
Jeannie is crest-fallen; for a horrible second, it looks as if she may start to wail
Matt moves into action with a pep talk
Remember our compromise
You're going next door to Lucy's to play and you'll show the kids your dress and 'll come get you later and we'll go out someplace and 'll buy you anything you want for under seventeen dollars
remember
She starts for the door, doubles back, and kisses a surprised Cathy full on the lips
The gesture is beautifully, even movingly carried off
It is totally false
(again to Cathy) Goodbye
love you
(totally thrown) Well,
thank you
Jeannie is on the run
as she passes her father
(sotto) Thanks
Jeannie nods acknowledgment as she flies past
Favoring Cathy, Matt leans out the doorway until Jeannie is safely next door, then re-enters
What a little winner, huh
(modestly) Oh
(waving script) This is my favorite project
And it looks like we're going ahead with it
(overlap) 'Mr
Deeds Goes to Town
' Oh, it's a remake
Well, come on, what's original
And this is a wonderful rewrite
It's funnier
And there's a part in it for
Yes
Burke says  can test whoever want
He wasn't even surprised when  mentioned you
So, if you could read this rewrite now and if you like it, we can make a test deal
(catching herself) they can make a test deal
we can tell them that they can make a test deal
(in explanation) think it's important for me to steer clear of the business end
Okay
which part
Longfellow Deeds
Mr
Deeds
Who goes to town, yes
Matt takes this in
takes this miracle in
Who are we kidding
'm even having trouble getting short parts--'m going to say  love it no matter what you've done to it
Stop being so creepy honest
really have an instinct about you for this
'm going home--call me when you finish reading it
(how quickly status changes things) Or
come on over
'  - post-coital moment though only the man is visible; Burke, who lies on the bed wearing a shirt and tie and nothing else
Nan lies out of sight on the floor where she is recovering from the deepest orgasm of her life
Why not
If you can test movies and premises and want-to-sees, why can't you test screen tests
Nan hauls herself into view, climbing back onto the bed
can't deal with your self-centered dribble right now
have just had the biggest orgasm of my life and 'm trying to figure out if 'm in love with you
What
Whoops
Tell me what made you rush over and pick me up and bring me here at six o'clock
mean we seem to have
She closes her eyes in a characteristic and touching gesture, as the scientist in her struggles to be precise
(again) this unspoken agreement not to talk about why we're together when we're together and  don't think it's good to let that become a pattern for us
She focuses again on Burke
Prepared for, at last, some verbal intimacy
Why did  rush to you
Because felt like  had to
be with someone and you were closest
(on Nan's reaction) What's wrong
You're not at all aware that you've just said something
(her eyes close) unattractive
Look, 'm sorry if that came out
'm not looking for an apology
'm just trying to say that one of the things 'm not great at is
Let's not make this about your shortcomings
'm sure you've had enough of those conversations to last you a lifetime
What 'm
No,  haven't
No, you haven't what
Had a conversation about shortcomings
(aghast) No woman has ever told you that you have an almost barbaric insensitivity
That you seem to have lapsed into some final cynicism, where you actually believe that, not only does everyone think the way you do, but only you have the courage to express it
That you seem horribly certain everyone else is sort of pretending when they talk about love or seem to care for anything outside their own anus
No one's ever said that sort of thing to you
Oh, yeah
But  didn't get what you meant by 'shortcomings
' Hey, if you think things like that, what are you doing here
(indignantly) 'm here for the same reason 86 percent of older women loved 'Beauty and the Beast
'  would like to believe that underneath the creature, there is a sweet, caring guy
sure hope you're wrong
Nan breaks up, shaking her head ruefully
have to pick up Leslie
Burke, not having intended humor, is also lighthearted, having somehow avoided a tight spot
'  - Matt, holding the script, walks the small lane through the tidy lawn to the perfect Silver Lake cottage
We from inside
( soundtrack
) There is a note on the door, which is slightly ajar, reading: "Come right in if you loved it--ring if you have reservations
" Matt enters
'  - White walls, thick rugs, great, great, fantasy garret; sparse, but cozy
He walks a step, then there is a girlish squeal and a naked Cathy streaks the rest of the way to her bedroom from the bathroom
(calling) mistimed it
(sticking her head out the door) wanted you to catch me fully frontal
She smiles broadly; hurriedly putting on something quick and loose to match her buzz
As she walks to him, the phone rings
She ignores it
So you loved it
lot
little
Give me a second--all of a sudden, there's a lot to deal with
She sits on the sofa--looking at him
(again) It's terrific
(pointedly) Do you see why  think you're right
Because you're nice and you know need work
(lower) You know this is really happening, so  wish you wouldn't kid around about it
Sorry, but  think the audition rule is that  have to be serious unless the person in charge is wearing a bathrobe and her nipples are sticking out
(holds fingers apart) this much
Cathy peeks down her bathrobe
Then broadly
There are some mixed signals coming out of here, aren't there
(phone rings; she answers) Hi
Working
can't write down a number now
Call me back
(to Matt) The script
It's really good
get a little nervous thinking about the opportunity
want to hear everything
You want to go page by page
If it's okay
kind of work on these things in a private
it's just
it's a little better for me if don't
(hurt) Okay
Okay, let's do it
It won't kill me
Please
understand
An uncertain beat and then she leans over and kisses him sound escapes him
They get up and begin walking to the bedroom
swear to God,  don't know which thing  want more, the sex or the conversation afterwards
(a smile) What do you mean
'  - As they enter and move to the bed where Matt starts undressing
mean  haven't been to bed with anyone since Jeannie got here haven't talked to anyone the way need to
(cradling her breast) haven't seen anything this beautiful
haven't felt this good about life
mean, 've been lonely, Cathy
(as he enters her) 'll tell you the truth, Matt
've never felt more like turning my phone off
She twists her body gracefully, sexily towards the phone
You can't shut the phone off
left this number with Jeannie's sitter
don't understand what you're worried about
'm not worried
But if the phone was off,  would worry
But  get a lot of calls
Oh
could put the machine on 'monitor,' but it's going to be
don't know
It will be okay
think the most important thing is to stop talking about the phone
Turn it off, monitor, whatever
Okay
She twists toward the phone again--not quite so beautifully
As she hits the "monitor" button, then turns back to him
You look so serious
am so serious
' Matt totally there
this is major for him, then he does something sensitive
reads her concern over the depth of his need and interest and shrugs, indicating he can't help it
She likes him
As they make love
their union thrown off kilter by the phone messages which roll in periodically as they thrust and sweat towards intimacy
(broadly) Hi, Cathy
All my magazines came today
Read the new Vanity Fair, they take apart three people we hate
Spy is bad this month
Scorsese didn't get the Time cover, the plane crash did
ha, ha, ha
Why aren't you at the office
You know, 'm getting to the point where prefer to reach people's machines
Bye
The love making continues as the calls continue
Cathy
Are you there
Hello
Are you there
'm going to count to ten
One, two, three
(then to someone passing his office) Did you go to the screening last night
What did you think
That makes two bombs in a row for her
(into phone) four, five, six
Pick up if you're there
've got major gossip
major screwup
It could be good for us
Cathy, in the throes of sexual union, feeling a bit divided by the offer on the phone
she shakes it off
Is this the kind of crap you listen to all day
Please, we're making love here
' (incredibly depressed) If the  show bombs, there's going to be a dance party on my grave don't give a crap
Nothing seems to have a point anymore
'm really questioning everything
including action-adventure
Don't tell anyone 'm down
Even destroy the message tape
Don't tell anyone  said to destroy the message tape
Don't even give hints that there's something you can't tell them, but you wish you could
'm losing it
'm losing it
'm losing it
Don't tell nobody
Don't tell nobody
Don't tell nobody
The sound of a hang up
the couple having more difficulty making love
As they look to the phone and react--still joined, then: ' (sobbing) Daddy
(berating someone who is with her) You dialed bad
Where is he
' (with Jeannie coaching b
g
) Matt, Jeannie is very upset because you are not here when you said
And now the big hand is on the eight
The sound of a hangup
As Matt springs from the bed
'm sorry
It's all right
(as he leaves) Is there a name for what we just had
'  - Matt driving
Burke in back as his anxieties gnaw away
This is awkward, my driving you around and testing for you tomorrow
Not really
Well,  hope you understand  can't drive you to work tomorrow and then go in and test
It's just
Burke reluctantly considers, then: Okay
was going to come in late anyway
'll get one of the kids to drive me
Thanks
And, look, if  get the lead in this movie, you'll have to go back to sitting up front with me
Burke laughs--surprised at being genuinely amused
'  - Matt, wildly dialing a phone--orange juice in hand, Jeannie standing nearby
He shrieks one phrase
(into phone) No sitter
Thanks
We're leaving now
-  - Matt is in the final process of being made up, going over his lines
Cathy enters
Jeannie's fine
There's a whole bunch of kids in the building
She's fascinated
And they're all ready for you
How many men are they testing today
You're the only one
Matt is surprised
But he is a pro and so immediately makes use of this sudden blip in status
Then tell them  need a little more time
- No, it's okay, we're done
mean for me
want to focus a little
Sure
(she hugs Matt) Good luck, Matt
(whispered advice) The thing they're looking for most is sexy
And then they're gone
With that bit of advice, Matt is totally fucked up
beat after Cathy leaves: You know who she was involved with for a minute or so
- Who
(quickly) Hey
On their look
(again) You guys have to leave
This is important and  need to be alone right now
They exit
Matt thumbs through the script
does a relaxation exercise
takes a breath and thinks
a beat and he is reasonably confident
he walks one half-circle of the room making sure he's fully pumped, then exits
- As crowded as it was for the previous audition scene, but this time they are reading children of varied ages, and the kids and their parents are all over the stairs, etc
Jeannie is filled with wonder and is arrestingly and atypically shy, as she makes her way through this world of the young, clinging to Cathy's hand, as the kids sing their version of " "--the stage parents taking one verse
At one point, Cathy's begins talking to someone, blocking Jeannie's view
Get out of my way
Don't say it like that
Which way should
(polite little girl) Get out of my way
(almost weeping) Get out of my way
(furious) Get out of my way
All this noticed by a casting person with a clipboard
Wow
- Matt making his way past the last of the kid stragglers
Cathy and Jeannie come running up to him
It felt great
Everybody
Let me tell him, let me tell him, let me tell him
(highly annoyed) Let him finish
God
want to tell him
If you wait one minute, 'll let you
Jeannie turns down her volume, but keeps repeating--incanting actually
" can't wait to tell him
can't wait to tell him
can't wait to tell him
" Anyway, the girl  did it with, by the way, she's really good; the director, the crew
they all thought we nailed it
(loving, sexy) Hey
(to Cathy) Now
Cathy nods and Jeannie begins to push Matt into Cathy's office for privacy
Wait till you hear this one
' Jeannie sits her father down
This is the first time we've seen her joyful
Pure glee
Some lady asked me to go in a room and, you know, make believe and say stuff like we were playing a game
The words coming so fast that Jeannie lets loose with a bolt of , as if taking a moment to catch her breath
Just a few sung lines proclaiming happiness
(again) And everybody went 'yea' and they said they wanted me to be on television
And the
And give me money and have a teacher there and a person to braid my hair and color my face and give me clothes
The sung phrase again
Stricken
You wait here, Jeannie
'   - Several people milling about
Matt eyes Cathy
We still hear Jeannie's muffled singing from the other side of the door
(furious) have to talk to you
- As Matt and Cathy come into frame
Matt forcefully placing her with her back to the wall
She is not one to be pushed around
Don't
What in hell is wrong with you
You actually think
'm trying to hang in here but everything in me cuts off when somebody acts this way
(continuing right along) that you can have my kid audition for a show without asking me
didn't
She went for water and by the time she got back, they had offered her the part
Blame Burke, he was there
Matt takes this in
Just a millimeter underneath his fury is professional curiosity
What's the part, anyway
The white kid in a multi-racial foster home with all these kids of varying ages
It's not a bad show
sure can't wait to see the test
How were they able to test her so fast
No
They offered it to her off the reading
meant your test
Oh
child actor
Just what any kid with problems needs to straighten out--a series of her own
Cathy has nothing to offer
Matt begins leading her back
We and see the chink in Matt's confidence, hear the tightness in his voice as he asks: You'll let me know as soon as they see my test
Right away
You've got my vote
They hold hands
'
- Jeannie, a script in her lap, caressing it, avoiding her father's gaze
He sits nearby sizing her up, pissed
'm doing it
Not if  don't let you
That's the law, the police law
She takes this shot hard, but tries to pretend otherwise, continuing to stare hard at her script to avoid him
Do  have to learn to read to be on television
(with a real edge) You're going to have to learn to look at me and listen to me and the longer  have to wait '
(looks up suddenly) 'm so mad
Me too
Just listen
don't
why
Because  know about this
have worked with kid actors
They don't have that much fun
They're inside all day
they don't get to go to regular schools or play with their regular friends like Ricky and Essa
(progressively losing it) And their parents
You think 'm going to be one of those parents, sitting in one of those rooms, where we all go crazy trying to jump start our egos with our kids' sweat, all the time smiling at each other like our lives are working while we root against everyone else's little girl
(Jeannie is totally confused, until) No
No way
can't
Okay
So, no, you're cuckoo anyway
won't do it
And  don't care because 'm be stupid at it anyway
She throws the script down
Tears in her eyes
Pick it up, Jeannie
She's so down, she complies--picking it up and walking it to the trash can
Matt stops her and takes the script
Let's work on it
'  - The staff of Popcorn Pictures is gathered in the boss' office watching Matt's screentest on projection
Burke sits next to Nan on a sofa--Cathy sits in front of him--others in chairs or on the floor
One  is attempting to "fine tune" the color--the    is on screen sliding between + and - as the color changes
Burke talks sotto to Nan
So how do you think 'Ground Zero' will do tonight
She ignores him, continuing to watch the screen
He leans into her
How do you think my movie will do tonight
(testy) 'm not going to talk to you during Matt's screentest
Cathy turns in her chair and mouths "thank you" to Nan
(to himself) How bad can it be
We've got to have at least a two million dollar Friday
There's nothing else out there
(turning to him) Please
'm watching
is crying
Matt very close to her
' Stop playing with that thing
The    does a quick slide and disappears from the screen leaving the actors' faces green
(crying) 'mon, Deeds, tell me about the meeting
What's wrong
Don't worry about my crying
As a matter of fact, crying turns me on
Well, in that case, your dog died
There is laughter in the room
The actress smiles through her tears--pats Matt for being wonderful
What happened at the meeting
can't remember
You're too pretty
(on her look) Oh,  told them 'd keep on being Chairman
(then explaining) 'm Chairman, you know
(smiling) know
Told them 'd keep on being Chairman if they hired everybody back
What did they say
Oh, that  was crazy
You always wear your hair back like that
She kisses him
We  the director say, "Cut
Terrific, guys
" The girl and Matt hug, no longer in character, as others come in to congratulate them
- Ad-libbed enthusiasm
mostly about the girl
As the conversation about the girl grows more pointed
Cathy, impassive outwardly, recoiling inwardly
Okay, come on
let's have our creative meeting right here
Well, 'd sure go to bed with her
(professionally concurring) Very fuckable
'd sure fuck her
Okay
that's her
What about him
think he's a very good to excellent actor-- do
(puzzled) But there's something
You wouldn't want to fuck him
Well, six years ago, maybe
think he's talented and attractive
So you'd want to fuck him
He might be light in that area
The man is talented
If you get one of those directors who like actors, think
director can't make you hot if you're not hot
You'll end up with warm which is death
(defending Matt slightly) We laughed
Let me ask you something
Would you fuck him
(wearily) Everything doesn't boil down to
Let me stop you before you embarrass yourself
Burke rises and addresses his staff
the camera has his back in the foreground as it    , Burke moving too as he continues
(again) We all can do our little lectures on what things boil down to
Everybody else here was professional enough to come out and say
'd fuck her
wouldn't fuck him
and you're ducking it
want you to forget the acting stuff and totally focus on the issue
And now Burke and  meet up--the effect being that he is talking directly to us as he continues
(again) We do have some kind of responsibility to the audience
You just saw his screentest
so, if this is the first time you saw the guy, do you come out thinking to yourself and your girl friends, ''d sure go to bed with him; oh God, would he be something
' Would you, Cathy
'm being real here
No
Okay, so let's keep looking
They file out
Cathy gets up several beats later than the others
and follows them out, avoiding Nan's look
'  - She's been sitting here for quite a while
she can postpone no longer; she dials as one of her in the background
(into phone) Hello
Matt
Hi
Okay, sure
She listens, waiting for him to quiet Jeannie
(again) Matt
(louder) Matt
Matt
Maybe it would be easier if  just said 'hi' to her
Hi, Jeannie
Yes, it's exciting
No, no
He's right, honey, they get somebody to read it to you
Now, put your dad on--it's important
No, first put your dad on
(she waits a beat) Matt
Uh-huh, a few hours ago
They all
everyone liked your work, but  think they'll go for a name or something
She listens to him
He is hurt
Cathy, though, is also wrestling with her own internal struggles
She has betrayed him and is ashamed; in a strange way--terrified
She is, therefore, just a little irritable
(again) It's not a matter of doing it differently
they liked what you did, a lot
they laughed and
it's not you
it's them
(suddenly her breath comes weird) No, please
Don't thank me
If you feel like getting together later or anytime, call me, okay
You sound like you have your hands full right now
Goodbye
'
- As he hangs up
wanted to talk to her again
She stops in mid-sentence, looking at her father
He is overcome
his energy failing to get him past this most awful moment in his life
She moves to his side
He starts to cry and, urgently seeking privacy, he moves quickly towards the bathroom, rubbing Jeannie in an instinctive gesture of reassurance
He closes the door
Devoid of anger
Sympathy so pure that it wrenches
She starts to move towards the bathroom
Her voice sweet
Dad
Daddy
Matt opens the door quickly
Everything's okay
'm sorry forgot to put you back on with Cathy
He walks across the room, Jeannie tracking him
You didn't cried because of that
don't even want to talk to her
Matt sits down, still suffering a bit of dysfunction, unable to keep up appearances other than a few minor half-hearted tweaks at his daughter who stands solemn and silent at his side
She pets him some
this goes on for several beats as the   "   " accompany the moment
Then: (a whisper) Dad
Can  say just one thing
With some effort, Matt lifts his head and nods permission
You've got to make me supper
Matt nods, rises and leads her into the small kitchen
'  - Burke is wearing a -shirt and shorts as he walks to his four-stops-past-state-of-the-art Stairmaster and turns it on while looking over his shoulder at the telephone
now sucking in some courage, he goes to the phone and speed dials
He begins to climb the stairs
You have reached the Warner's Hotline
Estimated Box Office Grosses for Friday, December 3rd, Weekend Number 49, are as follows in millions of dollars
He braces himself
there is a tone, then: Due to the high volume of calls, we must ask you to wait till a line is clear
At first from the speaker phone
Burke moving in time to "
" And now singing
As the lyric concludes and the instrumental comes in
(again) Thanks for waiting
Weekend 49 grosses follow in millions of dollars
'Belligerence,' 714 theaters
Two- point-one-eight million, down 46 percent
Burke smiles with pleasure
his steps becoming lighter, more fanciful
(again) 'Best Girl,' 1,820 theaters, six- point-four million, up 24 percent
(contemptuously) Cappuccino movies
Opening this weekend, 'Double Dare Two,' 1,870 theaters, fourteen-point- three million
and now his film, "Ground Zero," is coming up to bat
as succor to the gods, he tries to make his dance gleeful in anticipation
(again) 'Ground Zero,' 2,110 theaters, no million, point four thousand dollars
Burke falls off his Stairmaster and, from his new position, finishes his song
'  - Matt is driving
Burke is seated alongside him, talking without looking at him
'm going to pieces
(whispering) The picture was budgeted at 21 million and  spent 49 so they were a little mad at me to begin with
Now it doesn't open even with an Arby's Roast Beef tie-in
mean, we only averaged 300 dollars a theater
they're going to think 'm Woody Allen
don't think you have to worry about that
Thanks
But this is private
What about the exit survey
Did we do good with any group at all
Now we  Nan's voice on the speakerphone which Burke has been addressing all along
' can't hear you, but--hi, Matt-- that was funny
Hi
' ' don't think you have to worry about that
' She laughs delightedly
Burke leans across Matt's lap to get closer to the microphone
Did we do well with any group at all
' Eleven-year-old boys in the South
He sits stupified
' (again) Burke
Burke
Matt, is he
'll see you later
Goodbye
' But, hon
He hits the "end" button
He slumps for a second, then: 'm all alone
(pause) At least there's that
- As the car arrives outside Popcorn Pictures, we can  some child actors and their parents arriving at the sound stage next door
Are you going to need me
The kids are rehearsing and 'd like to take a look
Yeah, sure
have to stay inside during lunch hours now anyway--that's when everybody returns my calls because they're trying to miss me
(amazed) Is that true
(misinterpreting) Yeah
Thanks for the support
- row of parents standing near their child actors, adjusting them--not unlike handlers of racing Greyhounds
Seen from a distance--her father behind her
In the foreground, the mass of workers on the stage, It is, in effect, her , even though she is in the extreme background of the shot
We   to Jeannie and her father--even a bit behind them
Jeannie is scared
bet  know what it looks like to you
What
giant "find Waldo
" Despite herself, she smiles at the reference, though her tone is a bit sarcastic
Very funny
Five minutes, children, then we need you for work on the set
Set
That pretend living room, right over there
Okay
Set
Bye
(holding her arm) Wait a second, Jeannie
Let Daddy give you a few tips here
(twisting away) Nooo
've got to get to work
She breaks free, depriving Matt of the sweet and simple moment he wanted with her
She's one of the first ones on the set, other kids still hugging their parents
As Cathy comes up behind Matt, we can  Jeannie who, having so small a trust for her father, needs to confirm what he just told her
(faintly) Is this the set
Matt reacts
Parents to Room Two, please
(as he goes by Matt) Parents to Room Two, please
Jeannie is watching
(again) We have to clear the set
Matt looks him off fiercely
The Passing Voice addresses the friendlier parents
(again) This way, parents
'm glad  found you
Hi
- As they walk
You holding up
What did you do last night after  called
(as if teasing) What do you think  did
cried like a baby
Okay
Okay
So you don't want to tell me
Be a tough guy
Now you got it
feel relieved just seeing you after all that stuff
whew
Okay
(preparing to go) Burke wants to
You ever go out with him
Cathy is as simple and direct as she is embarrassed
Yes
You slept with him
Yes
Did you hate it
Eventually
(reeling a bit) Good Lord
This is the thing that makes me nervous about you
You keep on assuming 'm nicer than  am
He kisses her
She kisses back
Then there is an extraordinarily loud and piercing voice
He turns to see Jeannie beckoning to him from the stage--the director, standing at her side, joins in
He walks to them
- The Director is talking to Jeannie who seems, even from a distance, distraught and lost
She sees Matt
There's such trouble
She's very worried about being able to pretend cry when she has to and she doesn't get it about memorizing
That's all
(aghast) That's all
The Director beckons Matt to lead her away
He does
This isn't going to be good
Not with that attitude
She seems stung by this, unusually vulnerable
He changes tactics, softening
(again) It's just that they
Well, did they tell you what an audience is
(insulted) know what an audience is
Good
Now, because there's an audience, they want you to know all the words you have to say really well
And since you can't read yet
(off her fierce look) you're going to have to be patient and try hard
can help you
She grasps at this unlikely straw
Can you help me to cry
Yes
(on her broad disbelief) can
can help make it okay
Trust me
Jeannie pauses half a beat, then: miss my mother bigger than you know
'
- Matt on phone, Jeannie standing next to him reaching for the phone
(to Jeannie) Not yet
Don't grab
(into phone) Thank you
We really appreciate this
Hi, Beth
Jeannie grabs the phone in a flash
(softly into phone) Mom
No
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Would you talk
'd just like to listen to you
Wait
Let me sit down
Jeannie sits herself by the window, protected by an iron grill, and sits listening to her mother
There is about this pose something prescient; unmistakably, Jeannie will look this way again as a young woman cloaked in the love of some guy
but for now it's her mother, her crazy mother, who blots out dread
Matt is struck by how quiet and adoring Jeannie looks even as he moves to give his daughter some privacy
Several beats, Jeannie noticing her Dad looking at her--switching positions, body language indicating that she wants to put him out of her mind
then a thought
Dad says he's going to make me to really cry
Jeannie, your mom's not going to understand what you mean
Jeannie shushes him, resisting with surprising will and strength when he tries to get the phone
(to Matt) She understands
(into phone) He's being terrible right now
(faster; avoiding Matt) love, loved, the coloring book you sent me
Goodbye
Wait
love you
Let me hang up first
Love you
Send me a letter
Bye
And a beaded - shirt
Bye
She hangs up
Matt pissed
Why don't you let me be on your side for a second
can't even understand what you're saying now
Do you know what trust means
Not very
It means that even if something is hard to believe, you believe someone you trust because you know he wouldn't say it unless it were true
understand
So  don't trust anybody, right
Yeah,  think you get the concept
You don't make sense
don't understand you
think you do
Jeannie reacts broadly
indicating what a difficult man she's stuck with
Just know that
Okayyyy
(giving up) You want to help me make a phone call
She goes quickly to the phone and picks it up
Seven
two
(hitting numbers) Who are we calling
Cathy
She's very nice
One
six
(hard to read) "Very nice
" One
'  - As she answers phone
' Hi
(to Matt) What now
' Tell her, 'How are you' and then let me
' How are you
Jeannie
can't talk now because
Wait, my dad wants to
Tell him  can't talk 'cause 'm on the phone with a director
He wants to talk to you very much and
(sharply) can't
have to hang up
She does
'
- Jeannie, truly stung by the hang-up
She takes this act of Cathy's as an insult to herself and her father
Matt doesn't feel too wonderful about it himself
You have to understand that sometimes people are too busy
So she's too busy for you
- Burke and Nan eating together on an elevated balcony overlooking the main eating area
We look like jerks eating here this early
Everybody's going to think we couldn't get a reservation for the hot hours
Why do you do this to yourself
Why do you insist on eating dinner in a restaurant where you're bound to see all the people you're afraid of
'm not afraid of them
What do you call it when you think that what a group of people think of you can confirm or destroy any decent idea you have of yourself
Normal
How did little Jeannie do today
Isn't it something that they have you testing the  show
What  asked was, how did Jeannie do
What are you talking about
Somebody else
Jeannie
How did she do
Don't talk to me like this
(really pissed) want to be treated as if 'm really saying words to you which you engage and respond to
like Matt; 'd like to know how his daughter did
So before you take your dance of desperation across the restaurant and  end up feeling so sorry for you that  could die,  would like you to answer my question
She did okay
and don't worry about Matt
If the pilot sells, his kid will be making five thousand a week
So what do you know about 'People Get Hurt
' 'm told that they're not going to release it
knew
knew
What the hell are you smiling for
Forgive me
But telling you about this latest failure of yours--it pleases me
have no idea why
can't be with someone who's not rooting for me
think  am
It's just that rooting for you is a good deal more complicated than you realize
(as he rises) Don't go
Don't worry
'm not that mad gotta do this
as Burke leaves the table
This "Dance of Desperation" is classical
Burke himself lifting one of the women in greeting, then, as he puts her down
(again) Sorry
thought you were someone else
As he continues to go from table to table
As she looks down on him, dying for him, we  her sing the song "Poor Bastards"
Finally, not only about Burke--but the other damaged souls he seeks to dance with
Now, Nan can take no more
She exits
- As he sees her go past in the background, he goes after her, finally grabbing her near the Maitre ' station
This, just as    arrive
Burke frantically tries to cover
Nan, you know Victor and his wife
(he mumbles, unable to remember any wife's name) and Jay and his wife
(he mumbles) Yes
'm sorry  can't talk now
'm very upset about what's happening to Burke, so  just made up my mind can't be witness to it anymore if love him and  certainly shouldn't be here if  don't
so  was just in the process of leaving when he stopped me and you folks walked in
'm sure you've had something like this happen to you some time
some horrible thing in your personal life happening in public
They all nod and ad-lib agreements with her premise to Burke's amazement
(again) Thank you for understanding
(to Burke) Goodbye
wish only good things for you even though  feel 've been really damaged by this relationship
She exits, enormously upset
Burke, torn between following her and repairing the social damage
But the couples are paying him no mind; rather they are impressed with Nan
As they comment, i
e
Wasn't that spectacular
've never seen anybody that secure
Burke accepts the compliments as if meant for him
Thank you
Thank you
We're very close
- The strains of "Poor Bastards" underscoring the moment as Burke rushes into the parking area and grabs Nan's hand just as a valet brings her car
You don't understand that 'm exhausted from hurting
'm through with you
She begins to cry
Ordinarily this would be a scene which would be unendurable for Burke
However, the lesson of a moment ago is not lost on him
As people get out of cars and witness the sobbing Nan
(to restaurant patrons) Excuse me, we're working our shit out
'm sure it happened to you
you know, private stuff in public
The reaction to his openness is disdain and passing contempt
She drives off, leaving Burke hurt and alone
"Poor Bastards" up and out
'
- The lighting soft and sweet
Jeannie's words are tentative as she talks to her father who sits watching intently
don't know if 've been bad know somebody's been bad
(hopefully) maybe it's you
Matt laughs
Jeannie looks at him shyly
he looks at her with encouragement
Suddenly she is in his arms, hugging him hard, an emotional dam seems to have broken
Oh,  love you so much,  love you so much
love you so much
Matt holds on--clearly, deeply moved
Then he exercises the effort to control his emotions and speaks, surprisingly, as a Black woman
(as Black woman) hope that makes you feel a whole lot better, Chile
'Cause it sure goes a long way to cure what ails me
can't believe
(as himself, coaching) got in this much
got in this much trouble
Right
Over a
(guessing) Word
Yes
' can't believe  got in this much trouble over a word
' Now do you know what she means when she says that
don't want to talk about it--just say her stuff so  know mine
No
She starts to flail a bit
It's your choice
But 'm not helping unless you try to understand as well as memorize
It will be fun
Come on
know it's hard
Okay
Okay
Anything to shut me up, huh
Okay, this little girl you're pretending to be
she can't be with her Mommy either, just like you, or her father
she has to stay in Rainbow House which is called that because
(Jeannie starts fidgeting) Jeannie
(she stops) because everyone's a different color
so when this little girl calls the black lady who takes care of all the children this terrible word
it's like the worst thing anybody can do
Come here
(approaching him) don't want to do the ' love you' again
Yeah,  might have been working you too hard on that one
She is unable to resist muttering one sarcastic shot
Yeah
Why don't you do that with poopie Cathy
(ignoring her) Now, did the director tell you how he wanted you to do it
He said to smile all the time almost and to talk
uh
Faster
Yes
Okay
We don't always get good directors, so it's important for us
Me
You're not in the show
'm referring to the family of actors, you little shithead
Jeannie doesn't know quite how to take the name calling
we're heading for a rendezvous with a dance as it     : - Matt and Jeannie walking from the catering truck
They are eating ravenously
This is so good
It's a breakfast burrito
It's what actors eat when they're working
(excited) Really
- Now, let's work a little more
The most important acting you do is when you listen
You're worried about being able to cry when you're supposed to, right
Yes
So much
Well, there are really only two ways to do it
Think of something that makes you really sad
or forget you're you and really forget you're pretending
How do  do that one
Matt reads from script
(as a furious Black woman) 'Don't test me, child
could eat you for lunch when  was your age and 'm a hell of a lot bigger now
' Jeannie looks afraid
That's it
You just looked at me and acted right without even thinking
And there are games you can play to help you with this
Get up
(she does) Now, be my mirror
do exactly what do
that's it
now, at a certain point, 'm going to become your mirror, but 'm not going to tell you when
you tell me
(hesitantly) Now
Matt nods
(enthusiastically) Okay
We're going to make up words
The words aren't what matter now
'm on a roof
You're a great dad
You're a
(then stops; then smiles at him) This acting exercise of Chicago's Story Theater leads into the song, "
" As the song finishes, Matt and Jeannie are in the best spirits we've seen as an
approaches
They need you
Okay
She takes the
's hand as Matt calls
You're welcome
Don't mention it
'  - Cathy is in mid conversation with Millie
Matt enters and boldly says his piece
'm a free man
Let's go to your house and break the answering machine
You know,  could get away now
But 've got a big meeting later
We'd better take two cars
Millie, having been at the screen test viewing, is taken aback, looking from one to the other
Cathy knows what she's thinking and is unnerved, feeling silently accused, as she leads Matt out
See you later
Thanks again
- Cathy's car followed by Matt in Burke's car
The frame holds both cars close as if this were one long car
'  - She seems troubled
Then a decision
She dials a number on her mobile phone and picks up the receiver
/'  - The phone rings
He punches the speaker button
hope it's you
' Hi
Matt waves
(delighted) So this is how the big ones make out
- Almost bumper to bumper
snuggling
- She takes a breath and then plunges
/'  - As he hears one of the more ominous phrases of the motion picture community
' Matt, will you take me off the speaker
He picks up the phone
We intercut between the cars
What's the matter
(hyper) don't know whether 'm being a coward for telling you this way or brave for telling you period
Can you hear me
Yes
But  better talk fast because this is where my phone always kicks out
When we did your screentest
Can you hear me
Yes
Well,  sort of folded on you at the end
She pauses, silence, then: Matt
You didn't like what  did
did
Truly
But the discussion got sort of dumb
It was a question of sexiness
That's what it came down to
Well, sort of, yes
You folded on whether or not 'm sexy
You don't think 'm sexy
and you expressed that to
Well, 'll tell you
certainly must think so pretty much because feel great about where we're going now
- There is a longish line of cars behind Matt and Cathy
'  - Are you very mad at me
No
You were just
Aw, damn it, am
Very
Yes
Matt manages to pull to the side
the other cars gobbling the places behind Cathy, who sees this
and now she watches Matt's car recede from her view
' Cathy going out of sight
As he lets her go
'  - He is in bed, wearing a bathrobe, watching projection
number seven at the box office this week-end is
He switches channels
the two words are Tom Cruise
He switches channels
becoming the first lawyer to be awarded his own star on Hollywood Boule
He turns off the  and crosses to the phone, allowing us to read the back of his bathrobe "
" He looks at the clock which reads "four a
m
" and dials
Hello, Nan
hope it's not too late to call
'  - She has been crying
'd like another chance
You only think you feel that way because you're on the verge of failure and you're without a core
See
Nobody else gets me
(a beat then) You wanna have a little sex, honey
(a beat then) You know 've never hung up on anybody in my life
because what if the next thing they said solved everything
but  must end this conversation
Nan hangs up
Burke picks up a pocket electronic notepad from the bedstand and hits the scroll button
Names and phone numbers
He scrolls past numbers, considering, finding them wanting, so that, finally, he is scrolling the emptiness of his relationships
Now he considers one number and dials
'  - The phone rings
He picks it up
Hello
Hi, Matt, this is Burke
'm sorry to bother you at home, but you know Nan
We were going out a little and  could use another guy's slant on what's just happened
don't think  can get into this
Why
Did  catch you at a bad time
Worse
You caught me at a bad time you caused
Oh, you mean about the screentest
The whole room thought you did good work
(reinventing irony) Thanks
Yeah, look, 'm not going to bother you about my thing
Yeah
Okay, good night
'  - As he hangs up
Looks down and turns off his phone number pocket computer
Prince's "There is Lonely
" - to recall "'  ," as he drives past the line waiting to see
(:    , ) -  - We see Jeannie's face in the mirror, but it is seen through something resembling fleece, which we now recognize as the strands of Jeannie's hair being combed out to the side by an expert hair-dresser
Jeannie is shifting nervously in the large room where each chair is filled with a child of a different age and color
In the b
g
, we can  the voice of the -
- pilot for a new show called 'Rainbow House'
Just listen to our band and 'll be back to tell you more and make you love me
The audience laughs thinly
The   as someone closes the door to the make-up room muffling the offstage sound
There is a good deal of tension in the brightly lit room
Jeannie sits between a --   and a --
The room is abuzz
kids running lines and loudly talking
this builds to a musical life as in our first audition scene
there is a briefly sung phrase (Jeannie not taking part)
- The parents, in the same variety of skin colors as the child actors, are stuffed into a small room being patronized by the
Matt is grimly seated in the middle of a long sofa containing stage mothers
Another sofa is two feet away; the parents strain at each other
The
is talking grandly but we cannot hear his words because the Rainbow Parents are  a phrase from the same song we heard in the make-up room
Matt does not take part in the singing
The music goes under allowing us to now hear the 's words
and when you're in the audience, make sure you laugh and applaud even when it's somebody else's kid
There is appreciative laughter from everyone save Matt, who rises in disgust and crosses out of the room
(again) You're not allowed near the stage
We only have a few minutes
Matt ignores him and exits
- -
Matt, moving about the area, looking for Jeannie, spots a cluster of other cast members excitedly awaiting their introduction
Jeannie not among them
An
talks with concern to a
Let me know if you see the little white girl
Matt, growing concerned, walks on, then: ' Across the stage to the distant make-up room
Jeannie, alone in the room, which is so brightly lit it creates a bizarre effect, as if she were under a surreal spotlight reprises Jeannie's Sinead 'Connor song, "Lonely Life of Mine
" Stopping his impulse to go to her--he continues to observe
' Jeannie is nervous and uncertain
She plays with the handle of the make-up chair
turns herself back and forth
Then a very attractive --  enters the scene--obviously telling her to hustle
He offers his hand and she takes it, instinctively masking all clues that this hand holding is a "first" of great moment in her life
As they move toward the main stage area, Jeannie looks around, needing something
her dad
Jeannie
She turns--sees her father and gives a small, cursory nod
He moves quickly, drawing even with her but still giving her a bit of space and a low-key pep talk
Just remember
You're not even here tonight
There's only this other little girl that you're pretending to be who lives at Rainbow House
and who just vomited
Matt breaks up
Even Jeannie smiles briefly, then she takes him aside for privacy
just found out that we bow before we even do anything
Great
And everybody claps
Great
made up a great bow
You going to look
Wouldn't miss it
'm not going to be able to cry
It's too hard for me
Hey, then they'll just give you more chances after everyone leaves
This does not satisfy her
She rolls her eyes as she is pulled away towards the front of the stage
Matt watches as the 10- year-old veteran actor leads his little daughter towards her debut
-   -   - , a tension-filled version of "Poor Bastard
" Burke's stride was never stronger, his posture never worse; head hunched down into his neck
Suddenly, he reacts as he sees: the staff of Popcorn Pictures grouped together backstage
Cathy walking towards the group hurriedly from one direction as Burke approaches from the other
Seeing his staff has clearly moved Burke
Look at you
You're all here because of what's on the line for me tonight
Having this many people in your corner helps more than  would have ever guessed
'm just very grateful that made you come
He starts off, but a jubilant Cathy stops him, whispers something
He reacts with excitement
She sees Matt deep in the wings watching the stage
She calls to him with some urgency
Matt
Matt
Matt
He turns and she beckons him towards her
With some hesitance, he joins her
don't want to miss her introduction
'll talk fast
It's amazing news
Oliver Stone's been looking for a comedy and
(distracted) 've got to see my kid
(her voice breaking) he's doing my picture
Hey
Good
He starts off
Part of this involves you
He remembers you from 'Platoon' and wants to use you in this one
(he stops) Got your attention, huh
Matt is terminally disappointed in her last cynical sentence
Oh, Cathy
Look, 'm going to watch this
Let me talk to you later or tomorrow
Thanks for your help
It's good news
Gotta go
From the stage, we  the  of the -
- ' First, in her first appearance ever, Jeannie Hobbs
There is applause
Matt's missed her intro
Shit
'm sorry
Why couldn't you wait till later
Shit
(broadly) guess it's because 'm just incredibly insensitive to all human needs
'd ask you to save me, but 'm so far gone,  wouldn't want you to waste your time
(after a moment) Huh
She reacts, but he walks off, not wanting to get into it
Cathy, however, has had a tricky nerve struck
She continues, biting off each word
You know,  don't have a kid or a mate or a talent
(holding up book bag) got this
(she's quite upset) And shoot me if  think it's important
' Cathy, who looks alone and adorable as we   of " " He puts a comforting hand on her
She speaks nakedly from deep within herself; her eyes downcast
You think 'm a superficial jerk
(and then a whispered afterthought) You can't be right
think you're the best of the bunch
(broadly) Oh, great
And now she raises her eyes--big, blue and vulnerable
If this look were returned, " love yous" could flow--they could sink to the floor in a joint epiphany; but there is no romance or kindling in Matt's eyes
He is in a hurry
Pridefully, Cathy turns and walks off in the opposite direction, her flight so instinctive, she forgets her book bag
We hold on this--her exit, then: -    - 20 Standing just behind the four television cameras, immediately behind them, the "rail" where the Show's Staff and Crew Members and Network Bosses stand crowded, choreographed in the way in which they "clear" for a moving camera
Behind these people is the studio audience
There is a loud laugh
Burke turns around to study the audience
' Happy faces accompanied by the strains of Burke's love song to the crowd
(to Matt) What do you think
But Matt doesn't hear him
a few feet away, Jeannie is making ready for her big moment
Three cameras swing in front of them,  monitors showing a  and - of the three characters in the scene: a short comic  , the Black Female Lead, and Jeannie, dressed as a poor child
(wide-eyed) Wait
This is it
- It's like everyone is pi
ticked off at me because 'm not colored
The White Man jumps on the phrase
(correcting her pompously) The word is black
(correcting him with booming voice) The word is African American
burst of laughter, whooping and applause from the audience
Burke brags in a whisper to Matt
had them bring in two busloads of people from black churches
- As they play out the scene
(scolding Jeannie) Now you use it in a sentence
Look at me,
And Jeannie begins to falter
she must somehow cry at this moment
She looks outward for help
' She looks at the Lead Actress giving Jeannie all she can
Jeannie still can't cry
She looks past the cameras
' Her father nervously pulling for her
That didn't do it either
She looks into herself
she blinks-- there are tears running down her cheek
Awwwww
Matt, very much as he was when he watched Brando on the plane
and then some
Burke, craning to make sure the network bosses are suitably transported
' Go ahead
Use it in a sentence
(crying fully) Look at me
love an African American
Look at me
love a little redneck
The Black Lead Actress holds out her arms to Jeannie, who, tears streaming down her face, runs towards the arms
His lips pursed tightly in pleasure, then agape in shock
' Jeannie has run past the Lead Actress and off the set, going into her father's arms instead
She jumps on him, her legs and arms wrapped around him
(pridefully) You little stinker
You big stinker
My little stinker
My big stinker
The background to this intimacy is enormously alive
The Lead Actress and the Character Actor laughing out loud
In the b
g
, we see the audience filling out preview cards as the   leans in to say: It's okay, Jeannie
Take a minute
We just need to get that hug at the end
(to Floor Manager) Amazing, right
(to Jeannie) You were great
Thank you
That's nice
You look happy
loved it, Daddy
Matt starts to walk her back to the set
You want me to put you down
Her answer surprises him
No
This is okay
Okay
Now, you're not finished until you hug the lady just like you did me
He puts her down
She turns from him to go back to work but, on impulse, he restrains her
He is kneeling down, holding her lightly by the arms, her back to him as he states an ultimate truth: 'm very proud of you
love you more than anybody
Jeannie, shocked by her father's unprecedented sentiment, turns to face him and clamp a hand over his mouth so he will add no more lush and primal affection
Having silenced him though, she finds that she has something of her own to say
She'd never tell it to her father, but she can't resist telling it to her acting coach
When  had to cry,  thought of you buried in the ground
(a beat, then) Give me a kiss
She does
- The cast of Rainbow House taking off their make-up, changing clothes, etc
This is more than high energy and excitement-- what's the opposite of trauma
All are off the wall with pleasure--the   of the earlier dressing room scene returning--peaks of glee resulting in sung phrases as before
Jeannie enters and is immediately surrounded with love, attention and ad-libbed compliments about her work
In this glare of good will, Jeannie turns gloriously shy
Do you have any idea how special you were
(on Jeannie's goony reaction) That looks like a 'yes
' You've got to get dressed for the party
(overwhelmed) There's more
(then) What will  wear
Go to wardrobe; they'll give you anything you want
She moves to her dressing table--sits, looks in the mirror and giggles uncontrollably
- Matt stands waiting for Jeannie
Nan approaches
It didn't sell
This show didn't sell
How do you know so fast
It's the first time they had me do cards for a pilot and the demographics are all wrong for after nine o'clock
That's their only opening
Jeannie exits the make-up room aglow
She is wearing an incredibly stylish outfit and her hair is in an expertly done intricate braid
Hi
'm Nan
'm a good friend of your Dad's
Hello, Nan
'm Jeannie
Did you see it
(to Jeannie) Yes, and you were wonderful
(aside to Matt) 89 percent likeability
(to Jeannie) And knowing that you were that good means so much more than the show not going
What
Oh, no
(to Matt) couldn't help it
What does she mean
(to Nan) What do you mean
(to Matt) What does she mean
(to Nan) What do you mean
That they're not going to be doing any more of these shows right now-- but
(struck) Oh, my God
Honey
And that means they're not going to have a party
No
They're still having the party
(totally relieved) Oh
really
good
can we stay late
To which Matt answers: Honey, we're going to close the place
- The door to the roof garden opens and Jeannie enters--her dad behind her as she sees the party
the sparkling lights, the decorations, the other kids and
our opening song
""
As her father urges her into the flow
She passes Millie, who is dancing with the boy who held Jeannie's hand
cast him so he has to dance with me, but 'm sure he'd prefer dancing with you
(to Jeannie) Come on
You know how
(angrily, with disdain) Yesssssss
They begin to dance with the others
as we indicate   and: Perched on a ledge eyeing the party
'm not comfortable with television anyway
it's too small
'm much better at something with size don't do itzy
Even this movie of Cathy's--it's small
medium small
But with Stone it takes on a certain volume where  start to feel comfortable
(out of nowhere) hate my life
(backtracking) in a way
had a drink in my office
'm confused
You're not saying anything
Is it because you're not listening or because  haven't stopped talking
This Oliver Stone thing
does he really want me
Yeah
Oh, yeah
forgot to say congratu
Which part
Which one you want
One of the two leads wouldn't be bad
No
It's the crippled factory owner
Best part in the movie
He gets off the ledge and starts to move away
Burke moves quickly to cut him off
Wait a second
want to see my kid
second--look, they're taking the cast picture now anyway
Jeannie, working her way to the absolute middle of the cast picture, where she plops on someone's lap
She doesn't look anything like the women  usually go with
And you know what they say, "beauty fades
" What they don't say is that it fades very slowly
You don't think  can tell you what to do
No
Only  can do that
want you to tell me what to feel
(he begins to use his fingers to run down Nan's qualities) Look
trust her
More important, everyone does
You have no idea how impressed people are with her
She's smart
She's interesting
You never know what she'll say next
Her work is amazing
like talking to her
You have no idea what to expect next
respect what she does more than any writer or director--sincerely-- much more unusual--much more important
So
