He walks jauntily to a desk, refers to his paper, points his finger to a woman, emits a short whistle through his teeth, runs a finger across his throat and jerks his thumb toward managing editor's office
The woman stares starkly at him while her immediate neighbors look on with sympathy
The office boy now goes through the same procedure with several other people
All watch him, terror written in their eyes
Med

The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world
Two shot:  and
Despite himself, he's interested in her recital
Now, then comes the drama
He meets discouragement
He finds the world has feet of clay
His ideals crumble
So what does he do
He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization
He thinks of the river
But no, no, he has a better idea
The City Hall
Why
Because he wants to attract attention
He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard
So
Full shot: Of the whole group grins in admiration
has leaned back in his chair, his eyes glued on So
So he writes me a letter and  dig him up
He pours out his soul to me, and from now on we quote: " protest, by John Doe
" He protests against all the evils in the world; the greed, the lust, the hate, the fear, all of man's inhumanity to man
Arguments will start
Should he commit suicide or should he not
People will write in pleading with him
But no
No, sir
John Doe will remain adamant
On Christmas Eve, hot or cold, he goes

When the door is shut, the name of "Connell" which he has been printing is all smudged over
The painter stares at it, helplessly for a second, and thenunable to stand it any more, rises, throws his brush violently to the floorafter completely smearing the sign himself
Full shot: (sighing) Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you
Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babiesbut stay out o' newspaper business
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late

Close-up: Of
She takes the plunge
She is a little frightened at her own nerve, but she is going to brazen it out

You'll find it says, er: ", Ann Mitchell, hereby certify that the John Doe letter was created by me" Med

Kept me up half the night saying "That man's right, honey
The trouble with the world isnobody gives a hoot about his neighbor
That's why everybody in town's sore and cranky at each other
" And  kept saying, "Well, that's fine, but how's a guy gonna go around loving the kind of neighbors we got
Old Sourpuss for instance
" (laughing) You see, Sourpuss Smithers is a guy who lives all alone next door to us
He's a cranky old man and runs a second-hand furniture store
We haven't spoken to him for years
always figured he was an ornery old gent that hated the world cause he was always slamming his garage door and playing the radio so loud he kept half the neighbors up

Speak to him, Bert
" And  figured, well, heck,  can't lose anythingso yelled over to him "Good morning, Mr
Smithers
" He went right on pounding his fender, and was  burned
So  turned around to give my wife a dirty look and she said, "Louder, louder

"Good morning, Hansen
've been wanting to talk to you for years, only  thought you didn't like me
" And then he started chatting away like a happy little kid, and he got so excited his eyes begin waterin' up

They smile sympathetically
' Well, Mr

Wider shot: To include ,  and others
And he says it's a shame how little we know about our neighbors, and then he got an idea, and he said, "How's about inviting everybody some place where we can all get together and know each other a little better
" Well, 'm feeling so good by this time, 'm ripe for anything
Close shot: Of  and

So Smithers goes around the neighborhood inviting everybody to a meeting at the school house and  tell everybody that comes in the store, including Mr

Er, excuse me
Er, Mr
Smithers, Mr

Ththat's all right
If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural
(laughing) There are snickers from the background
Well, anyway,  guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys
The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him
Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong
" And then he tells 641
us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty
"If you ask me," he says, "they're starving
" Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it

What a reception they got
Why, everybody shook hands with them and made a fuss over them, and, well, finally, Mr

Delaney just sat right down and cried
He smiles, embarrassed, and , as well as the others, clear their throats
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people
Yeah, sure
Er, you know Grubbel, for instance
' Grubbel's here
See
(pointing) Yeah
That'sthat's him
Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him
Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth
"Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity
Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says
' Just like you said on the radio, Mr
Doe
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns
Isn't that wonderful
And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief
Yeh
Er, and my boss, Mr
Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney 642

You see,  was your father then
Well, laid you across my knee and  said: "Annie,  won't allow you to marry a man that's, that's just rich, or that has his secretary send you flowers
The man you marry has got to swim rivers for you
He's got to climb high mountains for you
He's got to slay dragons for you

Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek

She watches him, helplessly
(continuing) You know,  never thought much about people before
They were always just somebody to fill up the bleachers
The only time  worried about them was if theyis when they didn't come in to see me pitch
You know, lately 've been watching them while  talked to them
could see something in their faces
could feel that they were hungry for something
Do you know what  mean

Maybe that's why they came

And in these days of wars and bombings, it's a hopeful sign that a simple idea like this can sweep the country, an idea based on friendliness, on giving and not taking, on helping your neighbor and asking nothing in return

So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses
What would you say about that
Huh

Nobody's gonna do that, Mr

They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics
That's the main idea
Is that so

You're the one that was paid the thirty pieces of silver
Have you forgotten that
Well,  haven't
You're a fake, John Doe, and  can prove it
You're the big hero that's supposed to jump off tall buildings and things
Do you remember
What do you suppose your precious John Does will say when they find out that you never had any intention of doing it
That you were being paid to say so
You're lucky if they don't run you out of the country
Why, with the newspapers and the radio stations that these gentlemen control, we can kill the John Doe movement deader than a doornail, and we'll do it, too, the moment you step out of line

The John Doe idea may be the answer, though
It may be the one thing capable of saving this cockeyed world
Yet you sit back there on your fat hulks and tell me you'll kill it if you can't use it

Well, you go ahead and try
