(mechanically sweet voice) Good morning
Union National Bank Just a minute : 6
-
Of the inside of a massive vault door, made impressive by the shining, finely cut steel bolts and the many other intricate-looking instruments which adorn it
to a clock overhead which registers 9:03
group of young men, paying tellers, are impatiently watching a teller struggle with the lock that will admit them to the vault
Come on, come on, Oscar, what are we waiting for
2ND What's the matter
Can't you find it
3RD Sneak up on it, boy
4TH Oscar, come on
Say, if it had lipstick on it, he'd find it
They all laugh, as Oscar finds the combination
104
Almonds to you
[1] Almonds
Now, now, Oscar - not almonds
The     as they pass through the first portal
Nine o'clock and all is lousy
1ST Yes,  spend half of my life waiting for these time clocks to open
Say, where's Matt
Probably upstairs thinking up that daily joke
2ND That guy kills me with his wisecracks
3RD Say, when he comes in, let's put on a frozen face
Let's not smile
They ad-lib agreement
1ST Shhh
Nix
Here he comes 7 Matt Brown, the chief teller, as he strides briskly in and begins turning the combination dial to the main vault
He is about twenty-six, a clean-looking, personable youngster
Several of the tellers are standing close to him, looking on
How are you doing slaves
Hello, Matt
How're you Matt
Matt begins to work the combination of the main lock
(with his back to them) Say, did you boys ever hear the story of the pawnbroker with the glass eye
1ST No Matt, what is the story about the pawnbroker with the glass eye
(as he continues to fiddle with the lock) Well, 'll tell you
fellow went into this shop to pawn his watch
The pawnbroker said, "'ll give you $50 for it, if you can tell me which is my glass eye
" The fellow said, "All right, 'll do that
It's the right one
" The pawnbroker said, "That's correct
But how did you know it was the right one
" The fellow 105
said, "well, it's got more sympathy than the other one
" He turns, expecting their laugh, but is confronted by stone faces
Sympathy
You know, the right one had more sympathy than the other one
1ST What's the matter
Can't you get this thing open
Matt stares in disbelief, then gets the joke
(contemptuously) Six reasons why banks fail
This cracks them all up, as a uniformed officer, who has been standing by, works a lever attached to the floor, which lowers a section of the floor, directly in front of the vault
This permits the vault door, which is sunk below the floor level, to swing open
(ad-libbing) love your jokes, Matt
They're so entertaining
very funny man
8 Matt opens the inside door, made up of perpendicular steel bars
The tellers scurry into the cavernous-looking interior
Someone snaps on a light The back walls of the vault are lined with steel cabinets divided into many small compartments
On one side is a wall safe which is also opened by a combination and which contains the surplus cash carried by the bank
Matt is in charge of this
All around the room are numerous hand trucks - one for every teller
These trucks contain the cash in the charge of the individual tellers
While the tellers in the b
g
obtain their keys and open the drawers of their trucks, Matt examines the time clock which is attached to the inside of the vault door
9
- At the door, as Matt enters and goes directly to the burglar alarm box to the left of the doorway
He leans over to throw off the burglar alarm switch
: 10
- The handle of the switch points in the direction of a sign reading
Matt's hand comes into the scene and throws the switch up toward a sign reading This is done with no comment, it being a routine matter with Matt
Come on, white collars
The day's started
11 As the tellers file out with their trucks
Before they do, however, each one signs the cashbook
One or two exit silently
106
12
- As one of the tellers comes into scene
Matt examines the cashbook
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank
You better turn some in tonight
(as he goes) Okay, Matt
He exits out of scene
How are you fixed
'm okay, Matt
(to another teller) You've got enough
2ND 'll be all right
Charlie, the last man, comes up
Say Matt, 'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls
How much
About twenty-four thousand
(counting out money) It was more than that last week
Yeah
Here's twenty-five thousand
He hands Charlie four stacks of bills
As Charlie is signing the cash book, Matt speaks: Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie
Yeah
Let me have ten bucks
(aghast) Ten bucks
Say, if  had ten bucks, 'd quit
Charlie
107
Yeah
Charlie starts out
Matt follows him
13
- As Charlie comes out, followed by Matt
as they walk
(as they walk) 'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level  will
Give a guy a break, will you
've got to get it back in my account
If Helen ever finds out that (unsympathetically) Baby,  can't give you anything but love
[2] : 14
- with them as Charlie pushes his truck forward and Matt walks alongside of him
En route, of the general activity backstage of the bank
Male and female clerks stand around at various angles, checking away at adding machines
Several are assisted by someone who calls off figures to them as they record it on machines
We hear these figures read in a monotone as we pass them
Matt is still trying to pry the ten dollars loose from Charlie
Now listen Charlie
'll give you an 'll give you a note, 'll pay your mortgage, it's a matter of life and death Ad-lib conversations from the other clerks distract his attention
Whose death
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression
Aw, nerts
Charlie arrives at his cage with them
Come over and see us sometime
Matt as he continues on to his cage, muttering half to himself
'm not asking you to pay off the Depression
'm only asking you for ten bucks
108
Another teller is busy in the cage next to him
Matt addresses him, referring to Charlie
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar
Yeah, what did he do with his first one
Bought himself a pocketbook
The teller laughs heartily
15 Helen as she crosses the main floor of the bank, reaches Matt's teller window and pushes it open
Hello, Helen
(conspiratorially) Matt, come here
Why
Come here, honey
He leans over, and she gives him a quick kiss
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us
(already walking away) Oh, is that so
She quickly kisses him again, crosses back, and takes the grand stairs up to the outer office of the bank president as Matt watches with a grin
16
- Just then, a group of five or six important-looking men enter scene on the way to the conference room
One of the men looks towards Helen's desk
17 On Helen and a secretary standing next to her
(to Helen) Oh, oh
Look who's here
18 The other clerks and tellers, noticing the newcomers as they file past
Hey, psst
109
Oh, oh
Five ill winds
(standing next to Oscar) And blowing no good for the old man, either
19
' Shooting toward Helen
(acidly) The four-and-a-half horsemen
[3] What are they doing here
There's no board meeting today
Search me
By this time, the important group of men have reached Helen, and are passing her by, with perfunctory nods
(the most important of the important-looking men; to Helen) Mr
Dickson in yet
Not yet, Mr
Clark
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room
Yes, sir
And tell him not to delay
Yes, sir
The group of men file through the board room door, and out of sight
(to Helen) Looks like trouble for your boss
Takes more than two tons of directors to make trouble for my boss
(as she turns to go) Sez you
20
- Taking in all of room
The directors are all here, and some sit around a long, narrow mahogany table
Clark, the sour-faced old 110
bird we saw previously talking to Helen, paces back and forth agitatedly
've sent for the cashier, gentlemen
He has a list of the loans that Dickson made last month
21
- As he stops in his pacing a moment and addresses the directors further: And as  told you at breakfast, it is time we did something about it
22
- In thorough accord with Clark's violent attitude is Schultz, a German, whose instinctive conservatism rebels against Dickson's liberal banking methods
Mr
Clark's right
Dickson will ruin this bank if we don't stop him
(another conservative stalwart) Looks to me as if we're in hot water already
very dignified but meek little old man, Jonathan Ives, tries horning in: (feeble-voiced) Gentlemen,  was just wondering 23 As another of the directors, 'Brien, a large, bull-faced, thunderous-voiced contractor, rises to Dickson's defense
('Brien is always filing his nails, even while he talks
) ' Personally,  think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing
Dickson's all right
(interrupting) Oh, is he
We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city
We're fools to tolerate it
That's what  say
And the only way to end it is to get Dickson out
24
- ' He looks toward Schultz
' Don't make me laugh, Schultz
25
- Dickson doesn't have to go
But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust 111
' What good will that do
What good will that do
Why, it will take control away from him
We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again
That's what good it will do
26 Including Ives in scene with Clark and 'Brien
Ives is seated, 'Brien and Clark standing by table
Ives tries to speak again
It has just occurred to me ' (interrupting) You're wasting your time,  tell you
Dickson won't stand for it
He'll stand for it, if  have anything to say about it
Just then they hear door open, and they all look towards door leading thru to main floor
27
- As he shuts the door behind him
He is immaculately groomed, obviously cuts quite a dash with the women
He looks off toward the men as Clark's voice comes in: ' Ah - come in, Cluett
as he comes forward and puts a paper on the table before Clark
Here's the list
Yes, thank you
Anything else
No
Nothing
Cluett exits toward door again
Clark picks up the list and looks at it
Then he addresses the other men: Look at this
Just look at this
It's outrageous
Henry Moore - thirty-six thousand
Manny Goldberg - eighty-five hundred
Tony Consero - fifty-six thousand dollars
Joseph McDonald - eighteen thousand
Alvin Jones - sixty-six thousand dollars to a hotel that's on its last legs
tell you, people get loans in this bank that couldn't borrow five cents anywhere else
112
28 As the other men group around the loan list, which Clark has put back down on the table
They all scrutinize it carefully
(to the men at large) And on what
"Hunches," he calls it
Some day he'll get a "hunch" about a man and give the bank away
He's almost done that already
Our chief teller, Matt Brown, is an example of that
He breaks into Dickson's house, holds him up, and the next day gets a job in the bank
Well, as far as 'm concerned boy who should be in jail, handling a bank's cash
: 29
- Shooting toward Matt, inside the teller's cage, busily counting the money he is getting ready for Charlie
Helen is outside the cage
30 Shooting toward Helen
(skeptically) What did you do with it
With what
The ten dollars
(quickly) Oh, ten dollars Yes
(catches himself in time) friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it
31 Shooting toward Matt
As she interrupts him: 113
No
Oh, you think 'm lying
Yes
All right, 'm lying
Don't forget you called me a liar
Oh, Matt
He reaches forward and takes her hands
Oh honey, why don't we get married
Then you can handle it all
Just then Oscar enters the scene, en route somewhere
He stops beside Matt, notices he and Helen are holding hands
32 As Helen and Matt separate guiltily
Say, Matt
Matt
Did you hear the news
No, what
Pardon me
All the big shots are in a huddle, and it looks like Dickson's out on his ear
Helen and Matt react to this piece of news
They look at one another
Apparently, it will have a definite effect on their lives
(to Oscar) Oh, you're kidding me, aren't you
No, 'm not kidding
Everybody's talking about it
Ask her
haven't heard about it
Sure, everybody's talking about it
33
- As he speaks sadly
If that's on the level, there goes my assistant cashier's job
34 Taking the three in
114
Well,  just thought 'd drop by and cheer you up a bit
As he turns to go out of scene, he looks at Matt
'll be seeing you, Matt - in the breadline
: 35
- The men are all gathered around the table now
Apparently, they have been discussing ways and means of ousting Dickson
As we cut to this scene, Ives is pouring himself a glass of water
That ham  had this morning was very salty 36 Gentlemen, let's get organized before Dickson gets here
Schultz, can  count on you
37 On Schultz, who is seated next to Clark
Absolutely
What about you, Ames
38 On Ames, who is seated next to Schultz
That's the way  feel about it
Ives, how about you
39 Well, the way  look at it, it seems that (interrupting) All right
'Brien
40 At other end of table, where 'Brien is
' Well, you've got an awful fight on your hands
That's all 've got to say
41 On Clark, determined
115
Gentlemen,  think it's time that we do fight
: 42
- The outer offices of the bank are in this shot
spacious stretch of desks occupied by clerks and junior officers, all busily at work
wizened old doorman is greeting clerks as they arrive
(passing by) Hello, Gardiner
Good morning
You're on time this morning
It's about time
We see Dickson, looming in the doorway, for the first time
43 As Dickson stops to speak to the doorman
Dickson is a man of about fifty, whose looks belie his years
There is a robustness and virility about him that is compelling
His very walk radiates power
He now puts his hand on the old man's shoulder
Good morning, Mr
Dickson
John, how's your wife this morning
(looking up, worship in his eyes) Much better this morning, thank you
Got a handkerchief
Gardiner hurriedly produces a handkerchief, and starts to blow his nose
Excuse me Wait a minute
(he takes the handkerchief, and polishes the brass on Gardiner's uniform) How do you feel this morning
'm feeling fine this morning
That makes it unanimous
feel all right too
Thank you
As Dickson exits from scene: 116
: 44 The smile on his face disappears as he sees something which annoys him
(sternly) Oh, Carter
young man looks up quickly
He is smoking a cigarette
Yes sir
You know the rules about smoking
Carter quickly crushes out the cigarette
Even as he does so, Dickson reaches into his pocket and flips Carter a fresh one, which Carter pockets for later
Thank you, sir
Now Dickson passes Matt's cage
(catching Matt's attention) Oh, Matt
Matt looks up
Dickson tosses him a wink, and Matt winks back
Dickson walks on towards his office
On the way he is greeted by his employees
- Good morning, Mr
Dickson
Etc
, etc
(pleasantly) Morning
Good morning He is joined by Bill Saunders, a friend of his
Bill walks along with Dickson
Hello, Tom
(firmly, but pleasantly) You here again
What do you want
He does not stop
Continues his walk toward his office
Bill along-side of him
(smiling) What do you suppose anybody wants
Money, money, money
Listen,  told you  wasn't interested in that deal, didn't
117
want to know why
Dickson notices a man, a janitor without a uniform, passing by
(to the man) Wait a minute
Where's your uniform
haven't any
You haven't got a uniform
No, sir
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform
How much does one cost
Why,  don't know
You see Sampson
Tell him  sent you
You've got to have a uniform
The man exits scene
Bill picks up the conversation where he left off
Tom,  never had trouble getting credit from you before
When  was flat broke you gave me all the money  wanted
Now  come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest (interrupting) 'll tell you why
don't like the crowd you're mixed up with
(softening) Personally, you can have all the credit you want
But for that deal - not a cent
But listen, Tom, They have now reached the anteroom of Dickson's private chamber, where Helen sits at her desk
45
'   -
As Dickson comes up to Helen at her desk
lady sits nearby
Dickson notices her
Good morning, Mrs
Pembroke
Good morning, Mr
Dickson
Got my letter
118
Yes, thank you
Hello, Helen
Good morning
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day
What are we going to do about it
don't know
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank
When are you and Matt going to get married
(awkwardly) Why - well, Ummm
Stalling, eh
(changing tone, professionally) Anything new
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room
Directors, eh
Long faces
He gestures accordingly
(she trumps his gesture) Longer
(half-under his breath) haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either
Mrs
Pembroke has been standing by, waiting to get a word in edgewise with him to take in the lady: Mr
Dickson
Ah, Mrs
Pembroke
spoke to Mr
Schaffer at the Guaranty
He's going to take care of that mortgage for you
During this speech the phone bell rings
46 As Helen picks up the phone and quietly answers it
Bill Saunders is standing nearby, still waiting to talk to Dickson again
119
(into phone) Hello
(she turns to Dickson) Mrs
Dickson on the phone
Dickson comes over to the desk and as he picks up the receiver, he looks toward Mrs
Pembroke
(to Mrs
Pembroke) You'd better hurry over there
He's waiting for you
(then into phone) Hello, dear
47
- As he continues, into phone: Where are you
Sure, well, come on down right away
Huh
Yes, of course  remember
It's tonight
(smiles) See what a social hound 'm becoming
All right, goodbye, dear
He hangs up
Mrs
Pembroke is waiting for him to finish
She has apparently been disappointed in the news he has for her
But, Mr
Dickson,  thought you were going to take care of the mortgage
only want ten thousand
The property is worth sixty
(ill-at-ease) Mr
Schaffer will take good care of you
He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty
48 He continues talking to the lady, trying to get rid of her
Better hurry now
Goodbye
Good luck to you
Mrs
Pembroke, bewildered, starts to leave
(muttering) Thank you
as Mrs
Pembroke leaves
(to Helen) Oh, if Mrs
Dickson comes in, will you tell her to see Cluett if she needs any money
Bill Saunders is still waiting
He corners Dickson
What's the idea of turning her down
It sounds like a perfectly safe investment
120
She's a widow
don't like taking mortgages from widows
(puzzled) Why not
49 Shooting toward Dickson
If she can't pay, 'll have to foreclose, won't
(dumbly) Yes - sure (mimicking him) Yeah - sure
He turns to address a man below - the janitor without a uniform
Oh, make that uniform blue
Yes, sir
Abruptly, he heads for the board room
Bill is still baffled by Dickson's queer reasoning
Suddenly, it dawns on him
He shakes his head admiringly
: 50
- Dickson enters
(blithely; as he counts the board members present) One - two - three - four - five
Seven more and you'd have a jury
He grabs a walking cane and wields it like a golf putter
Well, it's a nice morning, gentlemen
How about two foursomes of golf
(eagerly) Oh,  say, that would be
Ives's voice trails off as he realizes Clark is scowling at him
(undeterred; still practicing his golf swing) Say, you know,  found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball
You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything 121
(huffy) think, Mr
Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind
Oh, you would, eh
All right
If it's more important than golf, go ahead
What's on your mind
: 51
- Shooting from one end of the lobby toward the front door
Depositors are scattered all over the place
Some at the windows
Some at the writing tables
Others sitting inside the railing, talking to junior executives
The scene is peaceful, though very active
, passing en route, the different types of individuals who frequent the bank
People from all walks of life
, picking up following little scenes
(at window) The check is no good
(  ) What
The check is no good
The man has no account here
Holy mackerel
've been robbed
'm sorry, madam
So am
And don't call me madam
an elderly lady talking to a bank guard
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here
Is it safe
Absolutely
It's his life insurance money, you know
That's all right
You come with me, and 'll show you where to deposit your money
and now singles out three men who are coming forward
One glance and we know they are here for no kosher reason
122
They are typical gangster types
One of them, the leader, is dressed in everything but the kitchen sink
Light fedora, stiff shirt and collar with stripes running perpendicularly
Flashy gray suit - spats - and walking stick
The other two are just tough hombres, but dressed to kill
As they walk toward camera, they glance around the bank with a professional casualness, but obviously very much impressed
Their eyes rove around the place and finally land on some object where they stop
: 52
- As he quickly counts out several thousand dollars in bills
: 53
- Their eyes glisten
Their mouths water, as they watch Charlie off scene
: 54 Inside the railing
Cluett emerges from his office and starts forward, business-like, when he suddenly stops in his tracks
55
- He stares off at the racketeers
look of fright comes into his eyes
His impulse is to turn back
56 The three gangsters
quick flash
Their eyes light on Cluett off scene, and they glare menacingly at him
There he is
Good morning
57
- He changes his mind about avoiding them
His face breaks into a feeble smile of affability as he walks toward them
as he approaches the three men, his hand outstretched in forced amiability
(shaking) Good morning
Who do you want to see
The gangsters shake hands with him, their expressions remaining unchanged, which adds immeasurably to Cluett's discomfort
(flatly) You
1ST (drawling) Yeah
We wanna talk to you about a big deal
There is a sinister significance in the manner in which he emphasizes "a big deal
" Cluett is perceptibly ill-at-ease
123
(uncertainly - sickly smile) Oh, yes
Well, come right this way
He opens the swinging gate in front of him, permitting the three racketeers to enter
They start for Cluett's office
58
' - Helen sits at her typewriter near a railing, overlooking the bank below
Another girl stands by her, both are staring off scene
: 59
- From Helen's angle
Cluett and the three gangsters going into Cluett's office
60
' - Helen and other secretary
Hey Pat, come here
Look
(to Helen) That's Dude Finlay, all right - 've seen his picture in the papers hundreds of times
wonder what he's doing with Mr
Cluett
(still staring - thrilled - shuddering) Gee, 'm scared
He's one of the toughest gangsters in town
: 61
- Shooting down the length of the table
The men are all sitting around the large table
Dickson is on his feet
(firmly) Gentlemen, you're only wasting your time
There'll be no merger
62 As Dickson continues
(the injustice kills him) Why should  turn this bank over to anybody else
've worked twenty-five years night and day to build it up, and now you're asking me to dump it into somebody's lap (with finality) Nothing doing
Schultz, who is seated near Dickson, looks up at him: You can make a handsome profit on your stock
124
'm not interested in profits
'm interested in the bank
In the depositors
They're my friends
They're looking to me for protection, and 'm not walking out on them
Clark and 'Brien, also seated around close to Dickson
How are you protecting your depositors
By making a lot of idiotic loans
' (admonishing him) Take it easy, Clark
Ives, seated next to Schultz, becomes alarmed
(still trying) My dear friends
(unruffled, paying no attention to Ives) It's all right
Let him go ahead
Let him speak his piece
like it
Go on
All right
'll speak my piece
Dickson, you've got to change your policy
63 As Dickson retorts: What's the matter with my policy
How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years
(he looks around - silence) 'll tell you
Not a single one
(defiantly) What's wrong with that kind of banking
(mumbles disdainfully) Just pure luck
64 Ames, seated beyond Ives, now speaks up: Conditions have changed
These are precarious times
Banks today have got to be careful
And you've been more liberal than ever
Dickson's voice comes in over scene: ' Yes, and 'm going to continue to be liberal
65
- As he continues: 125
The trouble with this country today is there's too much hoarded cash
Idle money is no good to industry
Where is all the money today
In the banks, vaults, socks, old tin cans, buried in the ground
tell you, we've got to get the money in circulation before you'll get this country back to prosperity
66
- Who are we going to give it to
Men like Jones
Last week you made him an extra loan of fifty thousand dollars
Do you call that intelligent banking
67
- He can't pay his bills
How do you expect him to pay us
That's a fair question, Schultz
Now let's see how bad a risk Jones is
What's his history
He's been a successful business man for thirty-five years
Two years ago business started falling off
Today Jones needs money, and if he doesn't get it, he goes into bankruptcy and throws nine hundred men out of work
Answer - unemployment
68
- ' As he listens intently, Dickson's voice coming in: ' It also means his creditors aren't paid
They're in trouble
They go to banks and are turned down
more bankruptcies 69
- As he continues: It's a vicious circle, my friends, and the only place to cure it is right here at the source
Help Jones and you help the whole circle
Now, when Jones comes to me,  ask myself two questions
First - is he honest
Yes
Second - is he as good a business man as he was before
And the answer is - he's better
70
- Showing his reaction, as part of Dickson's speech comes over scene: ' He is not only older and wiser, but his present trouble has taught him precaution
In my estimation, gentlemen, Jones is no risk
Neither are the thousands of other Joneses throughout the country 126
71
- To intercut with Dickson's speech
72
- To intercut with Dickson's speech
73
- To intercut with Dickson's speech
74 The group, as Dickson concludes his speech
It's they who built this nation up to the richest in the world, and it's up to the banks to give them a break
Disraeli said security is the prosperity of the nation[4] (cutting him off) Why, Disraeli didn't say anything of the kind
Well, he should have said it
It's as true now as it was then
And let us get the right kind of security
Not stocks and bonds that zig-zag up and down, not collateral on paper, but character
(indignantly) Character, hmmpf
That's your idea
Not at all
That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known
Those are his exact words, gentlemen
Character
It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums
: 75
'   -
Cluett sits at his desk, his face drawn, panic-stricken
He is like an animal at bay
The leader of the trio, Dude Finlay, sits in a chair directly in front of Cluett
The other two men stand on either side of the desk
(menacingly) You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you
(trembling) know,  know, Dude
Oh,  must have been crazy
lost my head completely
That's your funeral
We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us
127
(helplessly) haven't got it
76
- Shooting past Cluett
(barking) Then what did you want to gamble for
If you'd have beat us out of fifty 's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you
Well, we want our dough
'm sorry, Dude, butI That don't do us any good
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone
(threateningly - quietly) We can take blood from anything (pauses) If it's comin' to us
77 Shooting toward Cluett
Dude on opposite side of desk, the other two men still standing by the desk
look of alarm spreads over Cluett's face
There is nothing hidden in this threat
(wants time to think) Perhaps if you'll wait a little while, might be able (snappily) We waited long enough
(shrewdly - to the men) Nix
Lay off
(to Cluett) Now - what's the use of getting excited, Cluett
It oughta be easy for you to lay your mitts on that kind of dough 78
- Shooting past Dude, as Dude continues, slowly, deliberately: There's plenty of it in this bank - laying around loose
Cluett looks up - horror-stricken
128
(pop-eyed, choked voice) Good heavens, man
You're not suggesting that Why not
(perspiring freely) Why,  couldn't do that
(flatly) You don't have to do nothing
Cluett looks up toward the men - then at Dude
(slowly) What do you mean
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see
There is a pause while Cluett stares at them, horrified, his confused mind trying to assimilate the ghastliness of their proposal
Suddenly he starts to rise
79 As Cluett gets to his feet and faces Dude across the desk
No, no,  couldn't -  couldn't do anything like that Smack
The rest of his speech dies in his throat
The man to his right has slapped him across the face with his open palm
Taken unaware, Cluett's hand goes to his cheek
He stares at them, bewildered and frightened
Cluett, feeling himself trapped and helpless, slowly sinks into his chair
: 80
'  - Helen sits at her typewriter
very dignified, beautiful woman of thirty approaches her
She is Phyllis Dickson, Dickson's wife
She radiates refinement and culture
(pleasantly) Good morning, Helen
81 At Helen's desk, as Helen looks up at Mrs
Dickson
How-do-you-do, Mrs
Dickson
Is that busy husband of mine busy
129
(indicating conference room) He's at a board meeting
(not unexpected) Board meeting
Oh, that means hours, suppose
'm afraid so
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank
No
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it
It's useless
If it were some other woman,  could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you
Hardly
82
- Shooting past Helen
Oh, well
guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite
When he comes out, you tell him 'll be back
He hasn't gotten rid of me
All right
83 Helen laughs as Mrs
Dickson leaves in the direction of Cluett's office
: 84
'  -
The three racketeers are preparing to leave
Dude has his hand on the doorknob
(nervously) Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there
You
No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight
know, but Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked
Understand
130
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time
(positively) Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy
Quit squawking
Cluett looks at Dude, then at the others, and realizes he is helpless
He opens the door and the men file out, silently
Cluett shuts the door and as he crosses back to his desk, shaking perceptibly
He reaches into a desk drawer and extracts a bottle of liquor
As he takes a drink, Mrs
Dickson enters unannounced
: 85 As Mrs
Dickson stands watching Cluett
(playful reproach) Oh, oh
Cluett turns quickly
Upon seeing her, he makes an attempt to conceal the terror he feels
(smiling feebly) Oh, hello, Phyllis
She advances toward him as he rises
(shaking her head) This won't do
Not during business hours Why,  needed a (offering her drink) Want one
(screwing up her face) Heavens, no
Do you mind putting up with me until the financial genius gets thru genius-ing
No, no, of course not
Not at all
Oh, here
As she takes out a cigarette, he offers her a light
Mrs
Dickson notices that he is rather nervous
What is the matter with you
You're trembling
86
- (trying to be light) Am
Why,  -  don't know any reason why  should be, unless of course it's you
131
87 Me
Being alone with you has always done this to me
You know that
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission
Besides,  never knew that any female could do this to you Well, you can
You always could
(smiling) Liar
You're just suffering from lack of sleep
He takes this as premature defeat, and heads back toward his desk
(good-natured admonishment) Here, here, here, now
Don't you go back to work on me, too
'm getting tired of this
Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks (not understanding) What is
(finishing her little joke) running around
Not your work
(Cluett laughs in relief) You'd better start reforming, Cyril
If  thought you were the slightest bit interested,  would
Not bad, not bad at all
Do you know something
've always been curious about your line
Line
Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women
He shrugs off the compliment
(continuing) Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me
haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day was married
132
(trying hard) But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned
(laughs) Now let me see, what comes next
(a mocking tone) Oh yes,  know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis
88
- He is suddenly reminded of his pact with Dude Finlay
Terror returns to his face
Tonight
He suddenly gets an idea
He was told to be with someone around midnight
Someone who would be an alibi for him
He stares off at Phyllis Dickson
Why not
(continuing) Doesn't that come next
89 Yes, yes, it does
What are you doing tonight, Phyllis
See, we're getting along famously
: 90
- Clark is in a state of agitation
The other directors seem worn by the ordeal
Dickson remains adamant
Most of the creditors  know personally
've seen them grow up in the community
knew their fathers and mothers before them
know, Dickson
That's all very well
But you're taking too many chances
In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble
In case of emergency
91 All the men in the scene
know what you mean by that
You want me to hang on to our cash
Well,  don't believe in it
The law demands that carry a certain legal reserve, and 'm doing it
The rest of our money is out working
working to help industry
to help build up business 133
92
- As he almost shouts at Dickson
In the meantime, you're jeopardizing the safety of the bank
Well, we won't stand for it
93 Of the group, as Dickson turns to Clark
You have to stand for it
Meek little Ives once again tries to say something: (exhausted) But my dear friends
(interrupting) You're forcing us to take action against you, Dickson
Dickson looks at him: Go ahead - take all the action you want
He looks about at the others as he continues: 'm running this bank my way
Get that clear
Gentlemen, you notice Mr
Dickson refuses to consider our wishes
He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground
He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as
as faith
Yes
You said it, Clark
That's the only thing that means anything to me
94
- As Dickson's voice continues
Clark reacts appropriately
' Before  take a man into this bank, and before  extend credit to anyone, satisfy myself on one thing - do believe in him
95 On the other men -   from one to the other as Dickson's voice comes over the shot - finally on Dickson
So far, my judgement has been right one hundred per cent
One hundred per cent
When  start going wrong, you won't have to take any action
'll turn the bank over to you
Then you can 134
merge all you want to
won't be the fellow to run it then
Good day, gentlemen
He exits scene
as Dickson passes briskly through his outer office, stopping only to speak to Helen at her desk: (cheerfully) Helen, tell Matt  want to see him
Yes, sir
: 96
'   - - (mid-stream) and after dinner, we could go (not at all angry) Oh
Oh, no
think 've done enough experimenting for one day
Congratulations, Cyril
You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order
shall recommend you highly
(simply) Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis
must see you tonight
97 Favoring Mrs
Dickson
Tonight, Oh, never
Tonight  have reserved for a very special occasion
Believe it or not, it's our wedding anniversary
Tom doesn't probably even remember it
But then, they never do, do they
' No, they don't She shakes her head
But 'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party
Caps, bells, whistles, and everything
'm really terribly excited about it
've been planning it for months
(after a pause) Well (smiling) Well, what
135
(he won't give up) Well, aren't you going to invite me
(surprised) You
No can do
It's all set
Just a few of Tom's closest friends
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, 'm coming anyway
Don't be silly, Cyril
These are respectable people
They'd probably bore you to death
(desperate-sounding) No, they won't
Not when you are there
Oh, please, be a sport
Please ask me
(flattered, but a little suspicious) Why are you so anxious
(intense sincerity) Don't you know
No
want to be near you
He steps closer to her
What
Don't you know 've been crazy about you for years
(still flattered, lightly) Now wait a minute, wait a minute
've loved you ever since  can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson
(still only half-believing) Why, Cyril, you're insane No
No, 'm not
deliberately avoided you
was afraid of making a fool of myself
But  won't stand it any longer Cyril
136
Before she realizes what has happened, he has swept her into his arms and crushes her to him
from them to the door to the outer office
The door opens and Matt steps in
He stops, suddenly, transfixed by what he sees off scene
98 Phyllis Dickson in Cluett's arms (from Matt's angle)
They suddenly become conscious of someone in the room and Phyllis struggles free, looking off scene toward Matt: : 99
- From Cluett and Mrs
Dickson's angle
He stares unbelievingly for a moment, and then collecting himself, turns and leaves the room, closing the door after him
to Cluett and Mrs
Dickson
For a moment she is terribly upset
Please forgive me, Phyllis
lost my head for a minute
But  couldn't help it, Phyllis
As she starts for the door, Cluett walks with her
Please stop apologizing so much
You're making it far too important
As they reach the door
: 100
' - Matt stands there, in a daze
Cluett's secretary is not there
He starts slowly forward, hardly knowing where he is going - - there is a far-away look in his eyes
His hand clutches the list of payrolls but as far as he is concerned, it is entirely forgotten
Several people talk to him, but Matt walks on heedlessly
He can't get over the shock of what he just saw
He always had been under the impression that Dickson's home life was a happy one
He never dreamed that Phyllis Dickson represented anything but the height of circumspection
And now - Cyril Cluett, of all people
Helen comes running into scene, all excited
(happily) Matt, where have you been
Mr
Dickson wants to see you right away
Hurry up
He turns around mechanically and continues to walk in the direction of Dickson's office -
Helen falls into step with him
Say,  just heard the merger isn't going thru
Isn't that grand
137
(tonelessly) Yeah, swell
They reach Dickson's outer office
Matt crosses it and exits into the private office
Helen looks after him - her face falls in disappointment
Matt is acting very strangely
She thought he'd be elated
She stares unhappily at his forlorn figure as it disappears thru the door
: 101
'   - Dickson sits at his desk when Matt enters
When he sees Matt, his face breaks into a broad, pleasant smile
(grandly) Well, Matt, get ready for the big moment
Starting tomorrow you become assistant cashier
How's that
Matt crosses to the desk as Dickson is speaking
102 As Matt stops in front of Dickson
Matt cannot share Dickson's enthusiasm
The scene he just witnessed has taken the joy out of everything
It's all right
Thanks
And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk
(the idea pleases him) Not a bad thought, eh
He suddenly notices Matt's lack of enthusiasm
103 Shooting toward Dickson
He leans forward to look at Matt closely: What's the matter
You don't seem very excited about it
(feebly) Sure,  think it's swell
(scrutinizing him closely, very much hurt) Say, come on
Show a little enthusiasm
What's the matter
Are you sick or something
Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real
104
- Shooting past Dickson
Matt makes an attempt to snap out of it - and answers quickly
138
Aw, 'm sorry, Mr
Dickson
It's just kind of sudden, that's all
(working up a little enthusiasm) Sure, 'm excited
think it's great
Only, well, you've done so much for me already
'll never be able to thank you enough
105 Aw, go on, forget it
You came through, didn't you
That's all  wanted
lot of them didn't think you would
You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me
It's been swell
Well, when are you and Helen going to get married
Well, suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh
They are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Phyllis Dickson
Both men look up as she appears in the door
106
- As she stops in doorway
She glances fearfully, first at Matt and then at her husband, trying to sense whether Matt has said anything
She is quickly assured by Dickson's affable greeting
107 As Dickson comes toward her, arms extended: Well, look who's here
Hello, dear
Hello, darling
He kisses her
Then throws his arms around her for an exaggerated "teddybear" hug
Over Dickson's shoulder, Phyllis looks gratefully at Matt
108
- He returns her glance
His eyes are unable to disguise his contempt
109 Dickson and Phyllis
He releases her
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson
First  trample on the Board of Directors, then  promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day  have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife
What a man, what a man
(with a half-smile) It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you
139
Oooh
That has the earmarks
He notices Matt, still standing there, uncomfortably
(good-naturedly) Are you still here
Go on - go to work
What do you think  pay you for
Matt exits
: 110
' - As Matt comes out and moves quickly forward as if anxious to get away from the embarrassing situation he found himself in
Helen, upon seeing him, jumps up
(excitedly) What happened
What did he say
Did you get the job
(dolefully) Yeah
111 She is perplexed by his unenthusiastic attitude
What's the matter, Matt
Gee,  thought you'd be thrilled to death
Come here
(he takes her aside) You know, a few minutes ago  was in Cluett's office and Mrs
Dickson was there
Well
Well, he was making love to her
Helen, although she had a vague suspicion, is shocked
(after a pause) Oh Matt, you must be mistaken
tell you,  saw them
Helen stares at him, horrified
In Cluett's office
Yes, right in his office, the rat
'd like to take a crack at that guy
140
telephone rings
(as she goes to answer the phone) Wait a minute
Now don't go away
: 112
'   - Dickson is seated with Mrs
Dickson on the arm of the chair
(talking on the phone, as Mrs Dickson waits patiently) Yes George
yes, sure
Oh, that's for tonight, eh
Yes, certainly, 'll be there
Yes, we'll go down together and have dinner in Philadelphia Mrs
Dickson gets so upset
That's right
Yeah
Just as soon as the bank closes
Right
Goodbye
He punches the intercom, speaks to Helen in the outer office
' Yes
Helen, 'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes
Make all the arrangements, will you
' Yes, sir
Mrs
Dickson looks visibly upset
Dickson can't help but notice
What's the matter dear
What have done now
Nothing
Tom,  thought you were going out with me tonight
Oh,  did have a date with you tonight, didn't
Yes
'm terribly sorry
'd forgotten all about you
'm so sorry, dear
113 Favoring Phyllis Dickson
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight
That's all there is to it
But  have to go, dear
It's a very important banker's meeting
141
(interrupting) don't care whether it's important or not
You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully,  wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing
Listen, it isn't so terribly important
We can go to the theatre any time
The theatre
114 That's what it was you planned, wasn't it
(after a slight hesitation) Yes, of course
You can take some of the girls
You can take Mildred - or Gwynn The girls
don't suppose it ever occurred to you that  might go out and find myself an attractive young man
115 Shooting toward Dickson, as he laughs boisterously
Ho
Ho
Ho
Ho, ho, ho, yourself
wouldn't laugh if  were you
You may not suspect it, but 'm still attractive - to some
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me
Well
Don't you forget that 'm still the head man around here too
Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night
You and  are going out together
How's that
Tomorrow night
buzzer sounds, and a visitor is announced on the intercom
Yes
142
Mr
Gardner's here
(answering the intercom) Oh, yes
That's that lawyer
All right, let him have nine thousand
(returning attention to his wife) Yes sir, 'll step you around this town like you've never stepped before
We will have dinner at the St
Regis - then we'll go to a nice, snappy show - then a nightclub - we'll listen to soft music, and who knows
Ha
-  might break down and dance with you
(still skeptical) All right
'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night
(assuringly) Happy now
(mock-pouting) No
116 He takes her in his arms and kisses her
(tenderly) Poor kid, you know,  have been neglecting you
Oh,  don't care, darling
love you, anyway
buzzer sounds again, and Dickson answers the intercom
Yes
' Mr
Sampson
All right
Send him in
There is a knock on the door
Dickson moves away from his wife
He looks toward the door
117 Sampson, an executive in the bank, enters
Sampson goes to Dickson with some papers in his hand
He lays the papers on the desk before Dickson
Well, Sampson, what is it
Here's the data on the Clyde deal
143
118 Dickson is all absorbed
Good
'll take this along with me
Tell Clyde 'll see him tomorrow
'm sick and tired of the delay
'm afraid he's been stalling
That's just exactly what he has been doing
This deal should have been closed weeks ago
Tell him to keep tomorrow open
He says he can't get away in the daytime
How about his nights
He's too busy running around
Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or 'll call this whole deal off
Yes, sir
120
- She stands by a window, listening
There is despair in her look as she hears him making arrangements for tomorrow night
Dickson's voice comes over this shot: ' 'm sick and tired of these people dilly-dallying
People who can't make up their minds Mrs
Dickson's eyes close hopelessly, and she feels defeated
Again shut out from his scheme of things, she realizes he is incurable
On this picture of resignation: : :    , reading 5:07 to open vault
121
- Inside, several of the tellers are putting their cash away
One of them is just entering with his truck
Everybody in
guess so
Where's Charlie
144
(amused) Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup
He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it
- Good night
Good night, Matt
: 122
- Cyril Cluett is standing at the bottom of a spiral staircase from which he has just descended
He stops a second and watches Matt, off scene
Cluett has gloves on, his hat in his hand, preparatory to going home
Matt does not see Charlie
: 123
- Matt and Helen standing near the vault door
What's keeping you
Oh, Charlie again
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you
(still upset) Who
Cluett
No, not yet
But 'd like to take a crack at that stiff-necked, horse dollar
[6] Oh now, don't be silly
(disgusted) Can you imagine that guy
He was kissing her
Now you've got me worried, dear
(she kisses him) Promise me you won't butt in
Okay, honey - but just the same 'd like to take a crack at that She puts her hand over her mouth: Shh
(whispering) 'll wait for you upstairs
All right, dear
She leaves
Matt remains standing, a far-away look in his eyes
It is obvious he is thinking about the thing seriously
145
124 The boys who were inside the vault now file out, having properly locked away their cash
At the same time, Charlie wheels in his truck
(kidding him) Where you been
(annoyed) Where do you think 've been
(pointing to truck) took the baby for a stroll in the park
The men hurry out of sight, laughing
Charlie disappears into the vault
Matt enters the vault, his mind still preoccupied
125 As Matt goes directly to the burglar alarm
: As Matt's hand comes into scene and throws the switch down toward sign reading : Matt starts to the vault door: What's the matter, Charlie
'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake
And me with a date, too
remember once when your account checked
Yeah
Matt goes to the time clock to check it up
He tinkers with it a moment
: 126
- Matt has just finished adjusting the time clock as Charlie comes out of the vault
(pointing to time clock) And listen, wise guy - 'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning
(as he exits) Say, don't annoy me
got troubles of my own
Matt smiles
He starts to shut the vault
He has it swinging half-way around when Cluett enters
When Matt sees Cluett, the smile dies on his lips
146
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow
Yes, sir
(peremptorily) Let me see your cash book, will you
Now
Yes, now
Matt looks at him a moment antagonistically
He has half a mind to talk to him right now, but he recalls Helen's admonitions and thinks better of it
All right, sir
He exits into vault
The moment he is gone, Cluett crosses quickly to the time clock
: As Cluett's gloved hand comes in and turns the indicator back to 12 o'clock
127
- Matt has opened a compartment and has brought out several sheets of paper
He goes thru them to find the one he wants
: Cluett's hand is seen throwing the switch up to indicator reading
: As Matt comes up to Cluett with a cash report
Cluett glances over it
(returning sheet) That's all right
But it seems to me you're carrying too much cash
He exits
Matt glares belligerently at him
with him as he returns the paper to compartment
He locks the compartment door, switches off the light in vault and     as he starts out of the vault
As he swings the large vault door closed, : 128
-  - As a cab drives up to curb in the middle of a downpour, and stops
129
-   - They are in evening clothes, apparently they had some drinks, as phyllis is in a gay, frivolous mood
147
(to driver) Driver
' Yes
Have you the correct time
' 12:05
12:05
Fine
(looking out) What's this
My apartment
(mock-melodramatic) knew  couldn't trust you
You told me you were taking me home
Come on up for just a few minutes
We'll have just one drink, then we'll go
(definitely) No
know the answer to that one
(shaking her head) think you'd better take me home
What's the matter
Afraid papa will spank
130 No
No, 'm afraid papa isn't that much interested
He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings
Too busy closing big, important deals (on second thought) think  will have a drink
Good for you
Come on
: 131
' - Cluett and Mrs
Dickson emerge from the elevator and cross to his apartment, Cluett fumbles in his pocket for the key
148
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you
America's comfort to misunderstood wives
never thought would find myself in that class
Oh, you're not so badly off
There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife
What is that, Mr
Bones
[7] misunderstood bachelor
Cluett smiles
He has the door open by now and stands aside to permit her to enter
: 132
'  -
At door
Phyllis Dickson has just stepped in, and Cluett follows
He closes the door and locks it
(mock-melodramatic) And now fair woman,  have you in my power
(playing along) 'm not afraid of you
You haven't got a moustache
'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here
as he chases her into the next room
She alights on a piano bench, and runs her fingers up and down the scales
Suddenly Cluett stops
He stares off, a look of amazement in his face
Mrs
Dickson turns and follows his gaze and she, too, is startled
over to the other side of the room
Matt sits on the edge of a chair waiting for them
He rises, looks off toward Cluett and Mrs
Dickson
As he starts forward, to Cluett and Phyllis
Why, Matt
(when he recovers from his surprise) What are you doing here
Matt enters the scene
The butler said  could stay
told him it was important
Oh, yeah
149
Cluett steps over to a bell cord and pulls it
He's not here
He left at nine o'clock
He said you gave him the night off
Cluett wheels around, infuriated
What do you want
133 Favoring Matt
(uncomfortably) Well,  thought 'd like to have a little talk with you
(sharply) 'm listening
(hesitatingly) It's funny - now that 'm here,  don't know just how to go about it
(a glance toward Mrs
Dickson) You see,  kind of expected to find you here alone
As Cluett starts away: Do you mind stepping outside
We could talk 134 Cluett crosses to the door, where he stands, ready to open it
Mrs
Dickson stands by helplessly
(a tone of dismissal) Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning
Oh no, Mr
Cluett, if it's all the same to you, 'd rather not wait
It's about you and Mrs
Dickson
Cluett releases his hold on the doorknob
Mrs
Dickson looks at Matt uneasily - she is quickly sobering
(aghast) About me and
He crosses slowly toward Matt
Why Matt, what are you talking about
150
135 (quickly) know 've got a lot of nerve butting in like this, but  just couldn't help it
thought  could stop two people from doing something they'd be sorry for
(livid) 'm not interested in what you think
You've no right to do this to her, Mr
Cluett
Why don't you think it over
It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble
tell you, 'm not interested in your opinion
(turns to Phyllis) No
Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs
Dickson
Oh, gee, he's crazy about you
Nobody knows it better than you
If he ever finds out, it'll kill him
But Matt, you're mistaken about the whole thing
There isn't anything wrong
Mr
Cluett and  simply came here 136
-  & Shooting toward Matt
(to Phyllis) Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything
(snappily, to Matt) You'd do well to mind your own business
(wheeling on him) This is my business
Mr
Dickson's been like a father to me
(his voice rising) What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this
(livid) That will be just about enough
Now get out of here
guess  have said enough (bitterly) 'm just wasting my breath talking to you
137 Taking in Mrs
Dickson, who stands slightly apart from the two men
151
You're right for the first time
Now get out
Matt ignores Cluett and looks toward phyllis Dickson
'm appealing to you, Mrs
Dickson
Think what you're doing to him
You're passing up the whitest man on earth (flaring up) for a dirty, no-good
Before he finishes the sentence, Cluett punches him
Matt, caught unawares, is thrown off balance and sent reeling
He drops between two chairs
Now, livid with rage, he pulls himself up, murder in his eyes
Cluett crosses quickly to a desk near the door, opens a drawer and extracts a revolver
(frightened - cries out) Cyril
Matt, who was started toward Cluett, stops in his tracks upon seeing the gun
138 Shooting toward Cluett
(under his breath) Now get out of here
to the door
' Wait a minute, Matt
Matt turns as she enters the scene
'll go with you
' But phyllis
Mrs
Dickson steps closer to Matt's side
Cluett comes up to them
You needn't go on account of this idiot
Matt has opened the door
(quietly) You better carry that around with you all the time - you're going to need it
Matt follows Mrs
Dickson out, leaving Cluett glaring after them
139
- series of quick vignettes: Cluett's watch, showing 12:07
152
wall clock, showing 12:07
night watchman, alerted by suspicious noise, creeping up to the vault
The night watchman, shot by figures in the shadows
small number of men rush out of the vault, clutching money bags and toting guns
The night watchman, getting off a shot, before he crumples to the floor
: 140
- The vault door, partly opened
Over the shot we hear excited murmurs
, until it takes in the full room
fingerprint expert is working on the time clock for finger-print impressions
The medical examiner bends over the body of the watchman, whose face is covered with a cloth
detective in charge of the proceedings stands around, looking very officious
What do you say, Doc
Oh, 'd say about eight or nine hours
Well, you'd better call the coroner
, until it passes a group of tellers and clerks in a huddle
They listen breathlessly as Oscar, the youngest of the tellers, relates his story
For the moment he is the center of attraction, and he revels in it
(breathlessly) was the first one to see it
was coming down the stairs, and there was the dead watchman at my feet
You coulda knocked me over with a pin
- (murmuring) Gee
Can you imagine
Do you see that clock
Right there
That's where the bullet hit
When saw that, you coulda knocked me over with a pin
Was there much blood
Blood
(gesturing toward body) Come on over fellas
'll show you
The clerks head toward the dead body, but are intercepted by the officious detective
153
(officiously) Get back there
don't want anything touched until the Inspector gets here
The clerks, awe-stricken, retreat
(running up) Oscar, what's the matter
was the first one to see it
was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet
No kidding
No kidding
When  saw it, you coulda knocked me over with a pin
Where's Matt
Matt
Yeah
He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office
He has
Yeah
Say, did Matt do it
Don't look at me
don't know
Say, he did look kinda funny yesterday, didn't you notice it
Yeah, he did
noticed it too
You coulda knocked me over with a pin
: 141
'  - - ' He sits in a chair
The side of his face is swollen from Cyril Cluett's punch of the night before
154
' (like a tri-hammer) Come on, come on
You might as well tell me the truth
What did you do with the money
didn't do it
told you all  know, Inspector
revealing the other occupants of the room
The Inspector leans over Matt, firing questions at him
Two detectives are also there, one at the door, the other near Matt
Helen stands in a corner, pale and fearful, looking on
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you
(rises in indignation) wasn't anywhere near this place (shoving him back down) Sit down
When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun
(desperately) didn't do it
haven't got a gun
You used to carry a gun, didn't you
142 Sampson enters hesitantly
Pardon me, but 'd like to use my office for awhile
(bellowing) You use some other office
Sampson exits scene hurriedly
: 143 - The doorman, Gardiner, stands at the door, blocking a milling crowd, as Dickson, who apparently has already heard the news, enters
Come on, open up
Good morning, everybody
What's the matter here
Open up the door
Come on, open this door
Shall we let the people come in
155
(snappily) Of course, let them in
You're late now
as he proceeds toward interior of bank
Helen rushes into the scene and up to him Oh, Mr
Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt
They think he did it
Where is he now
In Mr
Sampson's office
Now don't you worry about it
He crosses in that direction, followed by Helen
: 143
' - Cluett comes out of his office, looks around cautiously and satisfied he is unobserved, walks toward front door of bank
over to a corner of the ante room
Detective #3 is watching Cluett
As Cluett leaves, the detective follows
144
'  - Matt is still seated, with the detectives grilling him
Then you did it and you did it alone Dickson enters
(to Matt) What's the matter
What's going on here
(to the Inspector) This is ridiculous
You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion
145 'm afraid  must, Mr
Dickson
Why pick on him
It's an inside job
That's a cinch
Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout
Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he
Yes
156
146
- Over which comes Inspector's voice as he continues: ' The burglar alarm was turned off
The time clock was set for 12 o'clock
What more do you want
' Somebody else could have done it, couldn't they
' He admits that he set the clock himself
Matt looks up toward inspector
did
set it for nine o'clock this morning
147
- As the Inspector turns to Matt: Then who changed it
(helplessly) don't know
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
The Inspector turns back to Dickson
What time did this thing happen
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09
All right
If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he
If he can do it, yes
Why, certainly he can
(to Matt) Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right
(averting Dickson's gaze) already told him  was home
(to Inspector) There you are
157
That's what he says
got a man from headquarters checking up on it now
(confidently) Good
(to Matt, smiling) You've got nothing to worry about
Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released
(to Inspector) And listen, don't talk so loud
Take it easy
Coast a little
He exits scene
148
- Showing the normal activity of the bank in contrast to the turmoil going on inside
Just a few people scattered about
towards the other end of the lobby, establishing the calm and peace of the place along the way
on a   at the bank telephone operator at the switchboard
Oscar, the young teller, is relating his story for the hundredth time
Gee, what do you think
There was that watchman, that poor watchman, lying on the floor right in front of me
Oh, you coulda knocked me over with a pin
(wide-eyed) You don't say
Dead
Dead
He was lifeless
You know,  was the first one to see him
was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying on the floor, right in front of me
Dead
tell you, you coulda knocked (interrupting) Yeah,  coulda knocked you over with a pin
Yeah, you coulda (realizes he is getting the brush-off) Oh - almonds to you
Almonds
Oscar exits scene
The operator turns her attention to the switch-board, apparently Oscar has interrupted a conversation she has been having
Hello, Mame
This is Gert, again (pause) Say, listen -  just heard something that'll make your head swim
Listen to this
Yeah, the bank was robbed last night
Yeah, over a hundred thousand dollars
158
149
- (into phone) Who did it
don't know who did it, but the chief teller's in an awful jam
Call me up later
'm going to call up Lou now
She pulls the plug, plugs in another wire
Hello, Lou
Did you hear what happened over at the Union National Bank
(a light flashes) Wait a minute, Lou
(plugs in wire) Hello
Yes, sir
'm trying to get them
(pulls plug) Yes, Lou, listen
They was robbed over two hundred thousand dollars
Can you beat that
: 150
- Two men coming out of the building, engrossed in conversation
Stole over a quarter of a million
Can you beat that
The other man whistles in surprise
2ND (whistling) Whew
You can't laugh that off
Several people in the crowd, overhearing them, turn and stare
: 151
- Of an old lady, pitiful expression, begging alms
Two gentlemen are beside her
One of them reaches in his pocket for a coin
3RD thought the Union National was pretty solid
At the mention of the Union National, the old lady looks up, startled
4TH did too
3RD Half a million is a lot of money wouldn't be surprised if they had to close their doors
159
The first man drops a coin in the old lady's palm and they leave
The beggar woman, oblivious of the coin in her hand, stares unbelieving, at the departing men
Suddenly her face screws up in horror
Oh, good gracious
She dashes out of scene
: 152
- colored bootblack is brushing the coat of a customer
Sammy, are you sure about that
(emphatically) Yes, suh
That messenga boy just tol' me that Mr
Dickson took it all hisself
And it was more than a million dollars
More than a million dollars
(breathlessly) Cross my heart
And  sure hopes that man gets a long time in jail, too
Never mind my shoes, Sam
He hastily exits scene
: 153
- Taking in two chairs
The man on the right, being shaved, is in conversation with the barber
Well,  always said the Union National was a phony bank
The second customer sits straight up in his chair
Union National
You had money in that bank, too
Yes
Something wrong
(hysterical) Mon dieu, mon dieu
Run, run
Second customer dashes out of scene
160
: 154
- Two men are in conversation
Another man is alone
One of the two men holding the conversation is the man of the bootblack episode
(of bootblack episode) tell you,  got it from the best authority
Dickson got away with several million dollars
155
- 3RD He is just reaching for his glass, and starts to lift it to his lips when another man's voice comes into scene
2ND ' Boy, that's the end of the Union National Bank
That's the trouble nowadays
You don't know who you can trust
You said it
The third man drops the glass and turns toward the two, panic-stricken
156 3RD Say, is there something wrong with the Union National Bank
2ND Something wrong
Brother, that ain't the half of it
If you've got any money in there, you can just kiss it goodbye
3RD (throatily) Naw, you're kidding No, 'm not
3RD Holy smoke
He rushes out of the scene
The other two stare after him
2ND (over-his-shoulder, to third man) If you've got any friends, you'd better call them up too
That's a good idea
have friends of my own
He dashes out of scene
161
2ND (turning to bartender, who has been eavesdropping with interest) Imagine that
What bank did you say that was
2ND Union National Bank
They're broke
Haven't got a dime
: 157 Quick cuts of excited phone conversations
(into phone) Listen, Jack, go down to the Union National and take your money out of there
Don't ask me how  know
told you it's on the rocks
If you've got any friends, you'd better tell them too
(into phone) Better give all the men in your plant a couple of hours off to get their money out (into phone) Tell Mrs
Hardy to tell everybody in the apartment house (into phone) All right
'll get it or bust a few noses
(into phone) Holy smoke
'll get right down there if  have to fly
(into phone) Run down there and get your money at once
- (quick cuts - a rising tide - different languages) Hello, dear
Hurry
Union National is sunk
told you to put it in the vault
don't know what's wrong with the bank
wouldn't trust anybody
everybody's taking their money out
Union National's broken
Why take any chances
Hurry
Call the others
etc
: 158
- Showing in comparison to previous shot, the effect of the rumors
The lobby is buzzing with activity
Lines form in front of all the windows
Depositors crowd around the writing tables
There are not 162
enough pens to go around
Frantic hands reach over shoulders for withdrawal blanks
Over the shot is heard the seething blend of many voices
a Teller and a Man
Closing your account
Yes, sir
'm closing my account wouldn't leave a nickel in this bank
a 2nd Man talking to a Woman
2ND It's getting so a man's money ain't safe unless it's in his sock
They're all a bunch of crooks
2nd You said it
Jewish Man talking to a 4th Man standing next to him
Say, did  know the bank was going to go caflooey
What am  - a fortune teller or something
on a
of Molly (the Zasu Pitts type)
She is reaching over a man's shoulder to capture a withdrawal blank
(fluttering) Oh, my goodness
Oh, my goodness
Oh, my goodness
What's the matter, lady
Oh, mister,  gotta
gotta
Well, they only sign slips here
Gimme your pen, please
She grabs pen away from him
He turns to someone next to him
Will you loan me that pen of yours
'm in an awful hurry
to a   of a teller frantically beckoning Sampson
163
need some more money
All of the depositors are withdrawing
know,  know
'll get you some
He hurriedly exits scene
: 159
'  - Inspector is still holding his ground
Matt sits dejectedly in the same place as before
(to Dickson) All  know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed
The way see it, Brown here looks guilty
160 What are you talking about
He had no more to do with it than you did
Maybe
But 'm taking no chances
(emphatically) Why, this kid's got a record
So have you
So have
So's everybody got a record
What difference does that make
You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they He is interrupted by the sound of the door opening
He looks off toward door
161 Sampson stands there, looking off toward the group
Mr
Dickson
Can  see you for a minute
' No, 'm busy
See me later
But this is important, Mr
Dickson
Looks like there's a run on the bank
162 Dickson and the others
Dickson looks off at Sampson, unbelievingly: What
run on the bank
as he rushes over to the door to Sampson
164
The lobby's half filled now
What are you talking about
Dickson goes out the door, followed by Sampson
163
- As Sampson and Dickson come into the scene
(pointing in front of him) Look
Dickson looks in the direction in which Sampson points
: 164
- From Dickson's angle
This shot takes in the length of the bank
Clerks, bookkeepers, stenographers in the f
g
, the lobby in the b
g
It seems a little more crowded than in previous shot
: 164
- Sampson and Dickson
Dickson's face clouds
They've been coming in steady all morning
have called for some extra police
(his eyes glued on the crowd) All right
Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away
We haven't much on hand, you know
If it gets any worse,  hope we don't have to close the doors
165 Favoring Dickson
He turns to Sampson
(flaring up) The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that
This is just a flurry, that's all
They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken
Listen, get ahold of our available securities and have them turned into cash
Wait a minute
Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too
Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot
Yes, sir
165
166 As Sampson leaves
Dickson starts out in the direction of Sampson's office
He is stopped by his name being called: Mr
Dickson
Dickson turns
Clark and several directors appear
(grimly) We want to talk to you
What about
We'll discuss that in the board room
He turns to follow, then is stopped by another voice
Oh, Mr
Dickson
We got a check on Brown's alibi
Do you want to hear it
(only a slight hesitation) All right
(to Clark) 'll be with you in a minute, Clark
: 167
'  - Dickson is by Matt's side
The Inspector is also in scene
Dickson puts a hand on Matt's shoulder
Now don't worry, son
All you got to do is answer the questions they ask you, that's all
as it opens and a detective enters, beckons to the Inspector off scene
168 As the Inspector crosses to the new arrival, who whispers something in his ear
The others in the room watch them, interested
The Inspector whispers instructions to the detective, who leaves
The Inspector then crosses slowly to Matt
169 As the Inspector comes up to the group around Matt
(carelessly) So you were home last night
(averting his gaze) Yes
What time did you get in
166
(haltingly) Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock
Eleven o'clock, eh
Are you sure it was that
Yes
The Inspector turns away and the Inspector as he crosses quickly to the door and beckons to the detective outside
All right, Kelley
Kelley returns to the room accompanied by a little old Irish woman
She looks around the room nervously
Inspector leads her toward Matt
170 As everyone stares at her curiously
(indicating Matt) Do you know this young man, Mrs
Halligan
Sure  do
He has the best room in me house
The one with the fancy wallpaper
171
- He feels himself cornered
The Inspector's voice comes over the shot
' Did you happen to be awake when he came in last night
Yes, sir
was having me hot mustard bath
What time was it
172
- As Mrs
Halligan continues
for the rheumatism, you know
What time was it, Mrs
Halligan
It was late,  know
The Dooley sisters was already in
They work at a show, you know
The Inspector is getting impatient
What time was it
167
Huh
What time did Matt Brown get in
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after (snappily) don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in
That's just what 'm trying to tell you, sir
It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters
Was it twelve o'clock
173 Dickson, Matt, and the rest of the group
Some show their amusement
Dickson and Matt, however, are serious
Mrs
Halligan's voice comes into scene
No, it wasn't twelve - 'cause the Dooley sisters
' (interrupting her quickly) Was it one o'clock
174 Inspector and Mrs
Halligan
Yes,  guess it was one, 'cause
(jumping her) It couldn't have been earlier
No
It wasn't earlier because
Yes,  know
Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet
(firmly) No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one
(exasperated) There you are
175 Matt speaks: 168
Aw, she doesn't know what she's talking about
Mrs
Halligan looks at him, offended
Who don't know
She comes toward him threateningly
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it (coming after her, takes her arm) That's all, Mrs
Halligan
Thanks
Inspector leads her to the door
On the way Mrs
Halligan continues to mumble her protest against Matt's insult
For two nickels 'd knock his block off
never told a lie in me life
She exits out of room
176 As Dickson steps closer to Matt
(heartsick) Is that true, Matt
Inspector comes up to them now
Of course it's true - and he knows it
(tenderly) Listen, Matt
If you don't tell the truth,  can't help you
Where were you last night
(after a pause) Aw, she was right
didn't get in till after one o'clock
Dickson is deeply disappointed
(quickly - appealingly) But  wasn't here, Mr
Dickson
Honest wasn't
The Inspector barks at Matt: Then where were you
177 Favoring Dickson as he leans closer to Matt
169
(to Inspector) Wait a minute
Wait a minute
(to Matt) Matt, do you realize you're up against something
You're being charged with murder
It's serious, son
Now come on,  know you didn't do it
(gestures toward Inspector) But we've got to make them believe it
Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night
(doggedly) can't tell you
Matt maintains a determined silence
(getting an idea) Listen, if  get them out of the room, will you tell me
Matt looks at him
Dickson is the only person he cannot tell his secret to
No
won't
You're protecting somebody
No, 'm not Mr
Dickson
Yes, you are
You're protecting somebody
Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is
It can't be as important as this
Now come on, tell me
Where were you last night
(a note of desperation) Come on, don't be a fool
Matt, you trust me, don't you
No reply from Matt
Dickson is heartsick
He turns, helplessly, away from Matt and walks out of Sampson's office
: 178
- Of Gert, the telephone operator
(all excited - into phone) What a day, Mame
Everybody's coming in and drawing their money out
(innocently) Gee, Mame -  wonder what started it
179
- Shouting from the offices
The lobby is now packed to the doors with frantic depositors
The low grumbling of before is now replaced by 170
vociferous condemnation of the bank and Dickson
Individual protestations are heard above the din of the crowd
Dickson enters scene, and as he quickly passes several tellers, giving them instructions to pay the depositors without delay
Sampson catches up with him
Look at them, Mr
Dickson
They're going crazy
Did you get the case for the securities
Yes, sir
Mine too
Yes, sir
But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place
Dickson looks off toward the crowd
The fools
If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves
Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads
What'll we do
'll talk to them
Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible
Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what  said
Tell 'em to verify every signature
He leaves the scene as we : 180
- Taking in a greater portion of the lobby
Dickson comes into the scene in the b
g
and stands on the stairs, looking down at the crowd
He suddenly holds up his hand and shouts: Take your time, folks
Don't get excited
Everybody stay in line
You'll all be taken care of
Don't worry about anything
Plenty of time for everything
He has to raise his voice even louder
Now listen, everybody
Listen to me
Gradually their attention is attracted to him
All eyes are turned in his direction
181 Shooting toward Dickson, past the crowd
171
Dickson standing on the stairs
The people looking up at him
want you to know that your money is safe
This bank is in excellent condition
If you've heard any reports to the contrary, it's based on malicious rumors
- Yeah
Maybe
It's a lotta hooey
We want our money
All right
You'll get your money - every penny
- We want it now
We don't want no speeches
182
- As he addresses the crowd: Listen to me now
It takes time
've got seven paying tellers working just as fast as they can
If you'll all calm down, 'm making arrangements to keep the doors open until four o'clock this afternoon and you can be paid today
183 As they cheer their approval and return to their buddies
184 As Dickson starts back toward the offices, Sampson comes to meet him
We can't keep open till four o'clock
We haven't cash enough to last an hour
Don't you think  know it
They both start walking toward Dickson's office -
As they pass the conference room, Schultz comes out and stops Dickson
We're still waiting for you, Dickson
Dickson looks up, studies Schultz a moment, as if trying to make up his mind whether to consult the Board of Directors or not
: 185
'  - The door opens and Dickson enters, followed by Schultz
They all look up
Dickson goes up to them
Well, gentlemen, we've got about one more hour to go
You know what that means
172
186 Dickson and the Directors
(continuing) We'll be forced to shut the doors
've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive
You've all made money out of it
Are you willing to help
(defiantly) What do you mean, help
know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city
Get that money over here and 'll stop this run within five minutes
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes
have everything  own in it
It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it
187 Clark and Schultz
(this is just what he's been waiting for) Oh, is it
Since when
Judging from the way you've ignored us, you wouldn't think so
We tried to reason with you, but you wouldn't listen to us
188 Shooting toward Dickson
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you
You thought they were your friends
Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them
Aw, they've gone crazy
You can't reason with a mob
189
- No
You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam
We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us
You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish
Now you want our help
You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've 173
wrecked
All right
There's one way you can get it
Give us an option on your stock and resign as president
190
- (quietly - tense) So, that's it, eh
You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you
(his voice rising) Well, 'm not going to resign now - or ever
191 Taking in the others at the table
You have no choice
haven't
'll shut the bank first
(terrified) Say, you can't do that can't
You just wait and see
If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, 'll shut the doors
You know what that means
The bank examiner will step in tomorrow
You'll be forced to liquidate
'll insist upon it
The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar
What's left you gentlemen can have
But 'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill
With which ultimatum, he crosses to the door and exits, : 192
- As Dickson barges out
He stops in front of the door, and looks off toward lobby
193
- Pandemonium has broken loose
Men and women are hysterical
The police battle with recalcitrant depositors in a desperate effort to maintain order
Strong men push weak ones out of the lines
Wild-eyed women jostle and scramble to get near the paying tellers
Sex and priority rights are totally disregarded
Above it all the din is deafening
Men and women are clamoring for their life's savings, ready to commit murder to retrieve their little stakes
: 194
- - His face clouds
As he stands there watching the chaos, slowly the deep concern vanishes from his face and his jaw sets in grim determination
He starts toward the stairs
174
: 195
- Cyril Cluett enters from outside, looking guiltily around
Then he starts forward and exits from scene
The moment he is gone, Detective #3, who followed him out, appears in the doorway and crosses in the direction taken by Cluett
: 196
- Dickson and Sampson
Mr
Dickson
Mr
Dickson
Get all the big bills in the place
Take them out and get them changed
Get nothing but ones and fives
Distribute them among the tellers
Tell them to take their time
Stall as much as possible
Count and recount the money
Yes, sir
hate to do this, but 've got to have time to dig up some help
think know where  can get some real cash
Snap into it, Sampson
We will lick this thing yet
He starts out of scene towards his office
, as he crosses past Helen, talking without breaking stride
Come on in here, Helen
Bring your book
want some numbers to try to get some action
Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange
Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage
Snap into it, Helen
Just as quick as you can
Yes, sir
: 197
- Pandemonium, din and increasingly hysterical, pushing crowds
: 198
- The directors apparently are having a battle of their own
Look at that mob
They're going crazy
You know, this run isn't doing the reputation of this bank any good
My dear friends 175
(interrupting) How much longer is Dickson going to hold out
' You know Dickson as well as we do
He'll shut the doors before he gives up control
All right, let him
'm sick and tired of hearing about him
If he wants to run the bank, let him do it
don't want any part of it
My dear friends Oh, shut up
: 199
' - Sampson frantically advising tellers
Stall
Stall
One teller faces an angry depositor
Er, is this your signature
Certainly it's my signature
You've seen it often enough
'm sorry, but 'll have to verify it
: 200
'   - - Seated at his desk, talking into the phone: Hello, Parker
Listen
Listen, 've got to have a million dollars in cash, and 've got to have it quick
(pause) What
(pause) No, no, no
Tomorrow is no good
need it now
(pause) Of course it's safe
Why, the bank's in excellent condition
You know that
: 201
'  - The Inspector is making preparations to take Matt down to headquarters
176
You'd better tell Mr
Dickson we're taking Matt Brown downtown
(to 2nd Detective) Is the chief's car outside
2ND Yes, sir
Okay
Come on son
Let's go
The detective takes Matt's arm and makes him get up from the chair
Helen rushes into the room and into Matt's arms
202 Helen clings to Matt
(sobbing) Oh, Matt
(consoling her) Don't cry, honey
Everything's gonna be all right
The detective touches her shoulder, tenderly
Sorry, sister
Helen does not move
She clings to Matt, sobbing violently
203 As Detective #3 enters the room as he crosses to the Inspector
What did you find out, Mike
've been trailing the cashier like you told me
You're right about that guy, chief
There's something screwy somewhere
Never mind all that
What did you find out
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint
Dude Finlay
Yes, sir
177
204
-  & Helen slowly lifts her head from Matt's shoulder
Her eyes widen as she hears the name of Dude Finlay
Mike's voice comes over this shot
' He stayed about half an hour, and then he came right back here
He's in his office now
(slowly dawning realization) That's where  must have seen that guy Helen starts out of scene
205 As Helen leaves Matt's side and crosses to the Inspector and Mike
Did you say Dude Finlay
Yes, why
He was in the bank yesterday
206 (suddenly alert) He was here
He came to see Mr
Cluett
Are you sure
Yes, sir
207
- As he listens intently to Helen and the Inspector
' Who was with him
' Two other men
They all went into Mr
Cluett's private office
' (pleased) Now we're beginning to get somewhere
208 Taking in all the people in the room
The Inspector turns to the detective and speaks quickly: Kelly
You stay here with Brown
178
(to Tim) Tim, you and Mike come with me
We're going down to Cluett's office
He crosses to the door, followed by Tim and Mike
209 As the Inspector turns back and calls: Oh, Kelly - call me up in Cluett's office in about five minutes
' What'll  say
don't care what you say
Sing "Mother Machree"[8] if you want to, but call me up
Inspector, Tim and Mike go out
: 210
- On the elderly lady depositor and bank guard, among the milling crowd
(above the din) Quiet down, please
Take it easy, folks
Everything will be all right
(to bank guard) But you said it would be safe
It's his life insurance money
Oh, please, 'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please
Please, lady
Please be quiet
Everything will be all right
(leading the old lady - pushing a path through the crowd) Open up here, folks
All right, folks, please
: 211
'   - Seated at his desk, talking into the phone: Good heavens, man, you're taking no chances
No, 'm perfectly willing to sign everything over to you
What more do you want
need action
've got to have it within the next half hour
(pause) Yeah, sure - the board of directors turned me down, but you know why
(pause) Listen
Listen, read it
It wouldn't be a drop in the bucket to you
179
(pause) see
Uh-huh
All right - ask me for a favor some time, will you
He slams the phone down angrily
: 212
'   - Cluett sits at his desk
The Inspector stands in front of him
(very suave) hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr
Cluett
Of course, yes
Just what would you like to know, Inspector
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night
(much relieved) That's very simple
was home
213
- Shooting toward Cluett
That is simple, isn't it
assume you can prove that if necessary
(feeling very sure of himself) Oh yes, of course
There was someone with me
lady
(smiling - affably) Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all
What was the lady's name, Mr
Cluett
If you don't mind, Inspector, 'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential
You see, she's married
(a big understanding grimace) Oh
(smiling) You understand
(assuringly) Why, of course
The telephone rings at this point
Cluett turns to answer it
180
Pardon me
He picks up the receiver
The Inspector watches him closely
214 As Cluett answers the phone
Hello
who
Yes, he's here
(to Inspector) It's for you, Inspector
Cluett gets up out of his chair to permit Inspector to get to the phone
Thanks
(trying to be light) Somebody must be in good humor
He was humming "Mother Machree
" (laughing) It's one of the boys from headquarters
He always sings "Mother Machree" whenever he's got good news
Looks like this case'll be settled in no time
215
- His face clouds at this
He listens while Inspector's voice comes over scene: ' Yeah, Kelly
Huh
Dude Finlay
Where do you got him
Inspector pauses, waiting for a reply
: 216
'  - Detective Kelly, speaking on the phone: (into phone) ain't got nobody here
'm with Brown
Didn't you tell me to call you up in five minutes
' Sure
: 217
'  - - Cluett is terrified
The Inspector's voice continues: ' Take him right down to headquarters
Cluett starts to edge out of scene
181
218 The Inspector is still holding receiver to his ear
Cluett has edged close to the door, his expression one of desperation
The Inspector watches Cluett out of the corner of his eye as he continues
(into phone) Yeah
What
You don't mean Cyril Cluett, the cashier
(long-drawn-out) Yeah-h-h-h-h
(pause) Well
Did Dude Finlay tell you that
: 219
'  - - (into phone) What
Dude Finlay
Sure,  got him here
You know, for a minute  didn't catch on
: 220
'  - On the Inspector
(into the phone) Yeah
We got him here right now
Yeah, yeah
Okay Kelly, good work
Looks like 221
- He feels himself trapped
He glances around the room quickly to determine his chances to escape
He keeps edging closer to the door with his back to it
His hands sneaks down and grabs hold of the doorknob
Suddenly, Cluett snaps open the door and like a flash is out of the room
222 As Cluett's figure disappears
The detectives are startled by the sudden move
(hanging up receiver) get him
The detectives dash out, Inspector following
: 223 - Cluett hurries through
224
'   -
At the door of the men's locker room
Cluett comes into scene and enters locker room
182
: 225 - Inspector and detectives enter
Look around quickly
(looking off, and spotting Cluett) There he goes
They rush out of scene, their hands on their guns, concealed
: 226
'   - Metal lockers line the entire room
Cluett comes to door on other side of the room
Just as he gets there, he hears the detectives entering off scene
Quickly he changes his mind and springs into a space between a row of lockers and the wall, at the same time drawing his gun
Inspector and detectives enter
The Inspector and one of the detectives advance into the room cautiously, holding their guns in front of them
Kelley, the other detective, shrewdly separates from them
He must be here
There's only one door
All right
Find him
Cluett slips into a locker and closes the door behind him
They hear the noise off scene
What was that noise
Sounded like a locker
locker, eh
Well, search every one of them
He must be in one of 'em
They search the lockers one by one, until the Inspector happens upon the one with Cluett inside
He leaps out, gun drawn
227
- From Inspector's angle
Stand back Inspector, or 'll shoot
Drop that gun
(calming tone) All right, Jack, all right
228 The detective and Inspector
The detective drops his gun, but the Inspector keeps his levelled, toward Cluett, off scene: Don't be a fool, Cluett
This is only going to make it worse for you
183
Stand back, Inspector
Let me out of here, or 'll shoot you
He starts slowly forward
The Inspector ignores the warning
He takes a few more steps forward
229
- From Inspector's angle
warn you, Inspector - 'll shoot
He levels his gun
230
- He lifts his gun and aims for Cluett, off scene
231
- He is frightened, but desperate
He has his finger on the trigger, ready to fire
(nervously) If you take another step, 'll shot is heard
The gun drops out of Cluett's hand
His arm goes limp
His face screws up in pain
(rushing forward to grab him - to the detectives) Let me see it
Let me see it
It's only his finger
Get me a towel
(to Cluett) Now take it easy, buddy
Take it easy
All we want to do is talk to you
: 232
'
- Shooting over the teller's shoulder
People standing in line, an atmosphere of pandemonium and hysteria
233
'   - - Still at phone
His coat is now off and flung across the desk
His face is worn
Perspiration rolls down his face
His appearance indicates he has been on the phone a long time
(into phone - defeated) You can't do a thing
You're up to your neck
All right
He listens
He is being turned down
He hangs up receiver
Over his face slowly comes a look of deep perturbation
He refers to a small notebook open on his desk
His finger runs down the list of names as he searches for another prospect
as Inspector and other detectives, with Cluett in custody, enter Dickson's office, all excited
184
You were right, Mr
Dickson
Brown didn't have anything to do with it
Here's your man
Why, you must be crazy
've known this man for years
He's just confessed
He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town
to Dickson, as he stares, unbelievingly, at the shrunken figure of Cluett, who is trembling with fear
234 Favoring Cluett and Dickson
Confessed
Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you
(his voice shaking) don't know
It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr
Dickson
What happened
You're not a thief
How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people
Gambling -  owed them a lot of money
Last week  lost over fifty thousand dollars
(shocked) Fifty thousand dollars
(hysterically) But  didn't kill that man last night
Honest  didn't, Mr
Dickson
235
- As he continues: (dully) Yesterday they came to collect it begged them to wait
wanted time to think, but they wouldn't listen to me
(his voice rises) They threatened to kill me if  didn't pay it
was desperate
didn't know what to do
236
- As he reacts to Cluett's confession
Cluett's voice continues over this shot
' (hoarsely - quickly) Then they suggested that  help them rob the bank
All  had to do was turn off the alarm and 185
fix the time clock
It all sounded so easy
It seemed like a way out
237
- As Cluett continues: (wildly) didn't know anybody was going to be killed
The Inspector addresses Cluett: What were you doing at Finlay's this morning
They took my keys yesterday
went there to get them back
(desperately) If you were in a jam, why didn't you come to me
would have helped you out
You know that
238 Favoring Cluett
was crazy,  tell you, Mr
Dickson
didn't know what  was doing
wandered around in a daze
All  could think of was that they were going to kill me
(pleading desperately) You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr
Dickson
You won't go back on me now, will you
'll die if they send me to prison
(practical) Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs
(wild-eyed) didn't kill him
had nothing to do with that,  tell you
was home in my apartment last night -  can prove it
239 (skeptically) Claims he was there with a married woman
Doesn't want to mention her name
(desperately - to Dickson) He won't believe it, Mr
Dickson
But it's the truth - honest it is
was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she He stops dead
Suddenly he realizes what he is saying
240
- As he reacts electrically to the mention of his wife
186
241
- He slaps a hand over his mouth, as if to crush out anything further he might say
He stares wide-eyed and frightened at Dickson
242
- Dickson glares at Cluett, penetratingly
His brain slowly absorbs the revelation that Phyllis was in Cluett's apartment the night before
(dully) My wife
What's she got to do with you
(out of the side of his mouth - to a detective standing next to him) No wonder he didn't want to mention her name
Dickson comes over to Cluett, grabs him by the arm
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night
(hysterically) Nothing, nothing, Mr
Dickson
Don't pay any attention to me
don't know what 'm saying
You just mentioned her name
What was she doing there
What was she doing in your apartment
She just came up for a drink
Just for a few minutes
Dickson grabs Cluett and shakes him
(a shriek) You're lying
243 Don't worry, Mr
Dickson
We'll find out whether he's telling the truth
'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away
(hard) You don't want to check up on anybody
'll do all the checking up
Wait a minute
as he crosses to his desk, and calls Helen on the intercom
Helen
' Yes
187
Get Mrs
Dickson on the phone
There is an awkward pause while Dickson waits
He is obviously agitated
Then the phone rings
(answering it) Listen, dear
want to ask you something
know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but
want you to tell me the truth
Where were you last night
: 244
-  -
(into phone - disconcerted) Last night
Er - why - uh, last night : 245
'  - - (very sombre) Listen, dear
Now tell me the truth about this
Were you in Cluett's apartment
: 246
-  -
(into phone) In Cluett's apartment
Well dear, you see,
: 247
'  - Favoring Dickson, but showing Cluett and the others
Dickson slowly puts the phone receiver down
His face is ashen
He is shaken to the core
(miserably) She wasn't to blame, Mr
Dickson
It wasn't her fault
Honest, it wasn't
begged her to come up
She didn't (an explosion) Get out, get out
All right
Let's go
The detectives get on either side of Cluett and silently they march him out of the room
Inspector and others follow, leaving Dickson alone
When they have gone out: 188
248
- Left alone, he is a tragic figure
An incessant parade of disturbing thoughts tumble over each other in a hectic march across his chaotic mind
He grips his throbbing temples in an effort to crush out the torturous thought that Phyllis was involved in an intrigue with Cyril Cluett
: 249
- Most of the directors seem to be weakening
'Brien is remaining staunch to Dickson
Clark alone, holds out
' Clark, you're insane to hold out any longer
Now let's get some money over here and stop this run
If we close our doors, our stock won't be worth a nickel
Meek little Ives once more tries to speak: My dear friends, ' (interrupting) 'll lay you ten to one, Dickson won't give in
250 Featuring Schultz and Clark, standing together
Maybe they're right, Clark
(weakening) All right, 'll go and have a talk with him
As he starts to walk toward the door: : 251
'   - Dickson sits at his desk, his head cupped in his hands
Clark enters thru door of outer office, quietly
He looks at Dickson a moment, then crosses to the desk
Oh, Dickson
252 Shooting toward Dickson
Dickson slowly looks up at Clark
(softly) Dickson, 'd like to talk to you about the bank
189
(heartsick) The bank
All right
Do anything you want with it
253
- His face lights up
This is a turn he never expected
He really came in to capitulate
(smoothly) Now you're talking sense
(alert) We'll draw up the option on your stock - say, eighty dollars a share
How's that
254
- He is not even interested, speaks vaguely: Eighty dollars
That's fine - anything you say
He waves Clark away
Good, good
'll draw it up at once
255 As Clark starts out of Dickson's office, elated, Helen comes in
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr
Dickson
(toneless) Numbers
No, never mind
She stares at him, surprised, backs out of the room
: 256
' - Immediately following: What's he doing, honey
Is he getting any help
Something's happened
He isn't trying anymore
They must have turned him down
Yes
He called some of the biggest people in town
Sure, they'd turn him down
He ought to know that
'm going in there and talk to him
As he enters Dickson's office: : 190
257
' as Matt enters: We haven't got much time left, Mr
Dickson
We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late
(softly) Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night
(ignoring the question) You're not giving up, are you, Mr
Dickson
Were you in Cluett's apartment
(dismissively) Oh,  can explain about that later
You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means
(gravely) Was Mrs
Dickson there
Listen, Mr
Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down
You've got more friends than anybody in this town
Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you
All you've got to do is (undeterred) Wait a minute
Answer my question
Was Mrs
Dickson there
(fumbling for words) Well
uh
Dickson She was, wasn't she
How long has this been going on
Do you know
Aw,  don't know what you're talking about
All  know is that you're losing your bank and (firmly) All right
That's all
(poignantly) Please, Matt
Head bowed, Matt exits scene
191
: 258
'   - Immediately following: Did you talk to him
(downcast) Yeah
(he has a sudden inspiration) got an idea
Come on, let's get to a telephone
They exit scene hurriedly
: 259
'   - All of his beliefs are shaken by this seeming betrayal
Dickson takes a framed photograph of Phyllis from his desk, gingerly sets it face down in the center drawer of his desk
Also in the desk drawer is - he cannot help but notice - a gun
: 260
- - As he dictates to someone off screen: a thirty-day option on ten thousand shares of stock of this company, now registered in the name of Thomas
Dickson
Now make that in triplicate and get it to me just as fast as you can
Hurry
: 261
- Shooting past cashier in f
g
towards line of laborers waiting to be paid
Cashier stands in front of a tall counter upon which is a small metal box filled with currency
He is speaking into the phone by his side as scene opens
He hangs up receiver and turns to the men on the other side of the window
(speaking thru small window) Sorry ladies and gentlemen, there's no more money
You'll have to go on to the next window
He snaps the window shut, slams down cover of little metal box
Angry ad-lib from line of laborers waiting to be paid
- What do you mean there's no more money
etc
192
Panicked shouting and pushing
In the center of the crowd, a woman faints
: Another cashier, another window, another angry line of depositors
That's all there is
More pushing, shouting, angry ad-lib
: 262
'   - Phyllis Dickson, serious-faced, comes up steps and thru ante room on the way to Dickson's private office
She pounds on door of office
There is no reply from within
Standing next to her is a bank guard, uncertain about what to do
Throughout scene, there are b
g
sounds of melee in the bank
(to bank guard) Are you sure he's in there
Yes, ma'am
He must be in there
He hasn't come out
She pounds on the door again
(shouting) Tom
Tom
Tom
(to guard) 've got to get in there
Can't you find me a key
(reaching into Helen's desk) Yes,  think there's one right here in the drawer
: 263
'   - As Mrs
Dickson rushes in
Dickson is standing by a window
264
- She walks over to him - - and stands in back of him
(softly - seriously) Tom
Oh Tom, darling -  came to explain about last night
Dickson remains silent
Mrs
Dickson continues: 193
Cyril Cluett doesn't mean anything to me, Tom
went out with him last night simply because
well,  had begun to feel that  didn't have any part in your life
That  was an outsider
Tom, all we did was to go to the theatre, and then we went back to his apartment afterward for a drink
That's all it was
didn't do anything wrong, Tom
couldn't do anything wrong
love you too much
You know that
265
- As he stares dully out the window
Mrs
Dickson's voice coming over shot: (breaking down - sobbing) Oh, Tom
Tom
: 266
- - Favoring Matt
They are furiously working two phones, going down a list of people who owe Dickson and the bank a favor
Although Matt has focus in the scene, Helen's voice is always in b
g
, as she handles calls, making the same pitch
(into phone - rat-a-tat) Dickson's in a jam  tell you
The run's getting worse
(simultaneously) Mr
Williams
(continuing) The big guys have got the screws on him
You've got to come through for him, Mr
Conway
He came through for you a hundred times
If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him
(looking up from her own phone pitch) Matt, look
There's Mr
Jones
: 267
- As a man elbows his way thru the crowd to a receiving teller's window
He is accompanied by a bank guard, who sweeps the disbelieving crowd aside
He speaks loudly for everyone's benefit: Any bank that Tom Dickson has anything to do with is all right
'm putting my money in here
Why should you be afraid
Give him a chance
Tom Dickson is all right
He's perfectly square
'm putting my money in this bank know what 'm doing
He reaches a teller's window, which is closed
He pounds on it
194
Open up
want to put some money in here
don't want to take any out
teller's face appears, somewhat astonished
(recovering composure) Certainly, Mr
Jones
Certainly
Charlie
: 268
- - (into the phone - rat-a-tat) They're starting to come in already
Yeah
Yeah
Well, listen
Don't waste any time
Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away
Step on it
He hangs up, dials another
Helen has dialed another prospect also, and hands the phone to Matt
(to Helen) Who's this
(into one phone) Mr
Williams
(into the other phone) Mr
Gunther
(to Helen) 'll talk to both of them at once
(holding both phones up to his mouth) Listen, both you fellows
Dickson's in a jam
The run's getting worse
Those big guys got the screws on him
Yeah, both you fellows got to come thru for him
Listen, if his friends don't help him, who is going to help him
Now he came through for you a hundred times
Yeah, listen
They're starting to come in already
Yeah, listen
Both of you fellas - get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away
Both of you - step on it
All right
: 269
- As several more people elbow their way thru the crowd on their way to teller's windows, speaking aloud
(loudly) Get out of my way
got money  want to put into the bank
and second man until they reach the receiving teller's window, where they fall into a line already containing ten or twelve people
The second man shoves his way to the front, and addresses the teller: 195
2ND want to make a deposit
Four thousand, six hundred dollars
He's the best man in the world
believe in him
: 270
'   - Dickson and Phyllis Dickson
She is still explaining to him
It doesn't matter what you think about me, there's something far more important
Those people down there
The bank, Tom
You can't give that up
She is interrupted by sound of door opening
They look off
271 As Sampson steps in
He looks off toward Dickson
Mr
Dickson
Come here a minute
Look at this
Something wonderful has happened
People are bringing deposits
You won't believe it until you see it
You have to come out
272 Dickson and Mrs
Dickson
He shambles over towards the door
273
' - As Sampson and Dickson come out from private office
(pointing off) Look
Dickson gazes in the direction he points
: 274
'  - From Dickson's angle
The line has grown in size
Those trying to deposit their money are just as excited as those who want to draw it out
(shouting) Tom Dickson is a friend of mine
'll put money in his bank any time
(shouting) Anybody who takes money out of this bank is crazy
'm going to put a lot of money in
Here it is
3RD haven't got much, but here it is
Tom Dickson can have all my money any time
196
: 275
' - On Dickson, looking toward Receiving Teller's window
He stares at the miraculous spectacle, deeply moved
He can scarcely believe his own eyes
smile grows on his face
The sight of his friends coming to his rescue has an electrical effect on Dickson
It revives his fighting spirit
He sticks his jaw out determinedly
Without a word he turns and crosses to door of conference room
: 276
- Dickson flings the door open
Clark and the other directors are startled out of their business
Clark holds the necessary transfer papers in his hand
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this
We've been waiting fifteen minutes (waving papers away) You know what you can do with that
Come on, take a look at this
You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world
While he has been speaking, several of the directors have edged over to the door
They are perceptibly impressed
277
- He has remained unmoved, staring at Dickson, as if trying to determine what kind of ruse is this
' Come on boys
Come on Clark
It'll do your heart good
, as he crosses slowly to the door and looks out
Look at that
They're shoving their hard-earned money across the counter with a ten to one chance against them
278 As they edge out onto balcony overlooking scene
If you fellas want to save this bank, get some real money over here right away
' (decisively) That's enough for me, Dickson
'm ashamed of myself
'll have a hundred thousand dollars over here in five minutes
197
'Brien starts away and crosses to a phone
Dickson turns to the others
Now you're talking
Ames
'm sold
He goes off
All right
Schultz
(only a moment's hesitation) This is your bank, Dickson, and 'm with you
Ives
279
- At last he can say something
(shaky voice) My dear friends, that's what 've been trying to say all afternoon
Go ahead and say it
(turning to Clark) Clark, you can do twice as much as any of them
How about you
280
- Oh,  don't agree with you, but if everybody's gone crazy, 'll go crazy too
: 281
- As Clark and the other directors make their urgent phone calls
(into phone) This is Ben Schultz talking
Send a hundred thousand cash over here to the Union National right away
(into phone) Send all your available cash to Union National
(into phone) Currency - small denominations (into phone) in tens and twenties 198
(into phone) Say,  want one hundred and fifty thousand dollars over here right away
(listens) am in my right mind
No, no, no
Not one hundred and fifty dollars
Say, listen you guys, one hundred and fifty thousand dollars
Yes
: 282
- string of armored cars speed toward camera, accompanied by an escort of eight motorcycle cops
The procession heralds its approach by the piercing wail of sirens
Open up
: 283
- dozen policemen precede the entrance of a parade of uniformed guards, who carry in one hand sacks of money, their other hands clasped firmly on their guns
The crowd in the lobby stands aside, awe-stricken
- Heads up Make way, there Hey, you, look out
Murmurs of approval are heard from the crowd
: 284
-
As the crowd is leaving the bank
Everyone is smiling and happy
(to nearby man) That's the trouble with people nowadays
They hear a crazy rumor, and right away they lose their heads
Not me
You didn't see me drawing my money out, did you
: 285
-  - As she works the switchboard - the next day
Good morning
Union National Bank
Just a minute
: 286
-   - As they gather for their morning ritual, waiting for Matt
Nine o'clock and all is lousy
199
Where's Matt
Ten to one he'll have a crack about the run yesterday
It's a cinch bet
wouldn't take it
2ND If he pulls a gag about the run, we'll murder the guy
Murder him
They hear Matt approaching, and gesture silence
Matt strides purposefully in
He works the mechanism on the vault
There is a long silence, during which nobody says anything, most surprisingly of all, not even Matt
Finally: (after having opened the lock - turning to the group of expectant tellers) Well,  suppose you guys had a good run for your money yesterday
They tackle him to the ground
: 287
- As Dickson enters, and playfully pushes the hat down over Gardiner, the old bank guard's face
The bank guard adjusts his hat, annoyed, then sees it is the president of the bank
(merrily) Good morning, Mr
Dickson
My wife is much better this morning
Well, that's too bad
Mine's all right too
Guard puzzles over his non-sequitur for a moment, then smiles
, as he strides through the lobby, passing various individuals from opening scenes
He spots the teller with a habit of smoking on the job
Carter
The teller, from Dickson's angle, holds up his empty hands
No cigarettes
Then, he opens his mouth and chews elaborately, showing that he has switched to gum
Hellos and Good Mornings greet Dickson as he continues on his way
He passes the janitor in a new uniform, and stops him
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh
Yes, sir
200
Looks good
How much did it cost
(proudly) don't know
Mr
Sampson bought it for me
Dickson opens his jacket, affects an unenthusiastic perusal of his own well-worn suit of clothing
(cheerfully) Oh-oh
guess 'll have to see Sampson myself
as he approaches Helen's desk outside his own private office
Helen looks up
Good morning, Helen
Good morning
Say,  know what's the matter with you
Matt
Matt, hearing his name, dashes up to stand next to Dickson
288 want you both to take the day off
Go downtown and get a license and get married right away
(weakly) But  haven't
don't want to hear any more about it
If you don't get married, 'll fire both of you
By now they are beaming
Dickson starts off, then has a second thought
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria[9] sailing next week
Gee, thanks, Mr
Dickson Oh
(cutting him off) Oh, no
It's not for you
You're only going to get married
Mrs
Dickson and are going to go on the honeymoon
With just the barest suggestion of a wink, he exits
201
Matt looks at Helen: Come, on slave
They exit arm in arm
