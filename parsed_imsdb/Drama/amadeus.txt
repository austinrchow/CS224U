We hear an old man's voice, distinct and in distress
It is
He uses a mixture of English and occasionally Italian
Mozart
Mozart
Mozart
Forgive me
Forgive your assassin
Mozart
faint light illuminates the screen
Flickeringly, we see an eighteenth century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs
We are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the point of view of the landing
Up the stair is coming a branched candlestick held by Salieri's
By his side is Salieri's , bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and biscuits
Both men are desperately worried: the Valet is thin and middle-aged; the Cook, plump and Italian
It is very cold
They wear shawls over their night-dresses and clogs on their feet
They wheeze as they climb
The candles throw their shadows up onto the peeling walls of the house, which is evidently an old one and in bad decay
cat scuttles swiftly between their bare legs, as they reach the salon door
The Valet tries the handle
It is locked
Behind it the voice goes on, rising in volume
Show some mercy
beg you
beg you
Show mercy to a guilty man
The Valet knocks gently on the door
The voice stops
Open the door, Signore
Please
Be good now
We've brought you something special
Something you're going to love
Silence
Signore Salieri
Open the door
Come now
Be good
The voice of Old Salieri continues again, further off now, and louder
We hear a noise as if a window is being opened
Mozart
Mozart
confess it
Listen
confess
The two servants look at each other in alarm
Then the Valet hands the candlestick to the Cook and takes a sugared cake from the dish, scrambling as quickly as he can back down the stairs
'  -  - The street is filled with people: ten cabs with drivers, five children, fifteen adults, two doormen, fifteen dancing couples and a sled and three dogs
It is a windy night
Snow is falling and whirling about
People are passing on foot, holding their cloaks tightly around them
Some of them are revelers in fancy dress: they wear masks on their faces or hanging around their necks, as if returning from parties
Now they are glancing up at the facade of the old house
The window above the street is open and Old Salieri stands there calling to the sky: a sharp-featured, white-haired Italian over seventy years old, wearing a stained dressing gown
Mozart
Mozart
cannot bear it any longer
confess
confess what did
'm guilty
killed you
Sir confess
killed you
The door of the house bursts open
The Valet hobbles out, holding the sugared cake
The wind catches at his shawl
Mozart, perdonami
Forgive your assassin
Piet
Piet
Forgive your assassin
Forgive me
Forgive
Forgive
(looking up to the window) That's all right, Signore
He heard you
He forgave you
He wants you to go inside now and shut the window
Old Salieri stares down at him
Some of the passersby have now stopped and are watching this spectacle
Come on, Signore
Look what  have for you
can't give it to you from down here, can
Old Salieri looks at him in contempt
Then he turns away back into the room, shutting the window with a bang
Through the glass, the old man stares down at the group of onlookers in the street
They stare back at him in confusion
Who is that
No one, sir
He'll be all right
Poor man
He's a little unhappy, you know
He makes a sign indicating 'crazy,' and goes back inside the house
The onlookers keep staring
: '  - The Cook is standing holding the candlestick in one hand, the dish of cakes in the other
The Valet arrives, panting
Did he open
The Cook, scared, shakes his head: no
The Valet again knocks on the door
Here  am, Signore
Now open the door
He eats the sugared cake in his hand, elaborately and noisily
Mmmm - this is good
This is the most delicious thing  ever ate, believe me
Signore, you don't know what you're missing
Mmmm
We hear a thump from inside the bedroom
Now that's enough, Signore
Open
We hear a terrible, throaty groaning
If you don't open this door, we're going to eat everything
There'll be nothing left for you
And 'm not going to bring you anything more
He looks down
From under the door we see a trickle of blood flowing
In horror, the two men stare at it
The dish of cakes falls from the Cook's hand and shatters
He sets the candlestick down on the floor
Both servants run at the door frantically - once, twice, three times - and the frail lock gives
The door flies open
Immediately, the stormy, frenzied opening of Mozart's Symphony No
25 (the Little  Minor) begins
We see what the servants see
'  - Old Salieri lies on the floor in a pool of blood, an open razor in his hand
He has cut his throat but is still alive
He gestures at them
They run to him
Barely, we glimpse the room - an old chair, old tables piled with books, a forte- piano, a chamber-pot on the floor - as the Valet and the Cook struggle to lift their old Master, and bind his bleeding throat with a napkin
- Twenty-five dancing couples, fifty guests, ten servants, full orchestra
As the music slows a little, we see a Masquerade Ball in progress
crowded room of dancers is executing the slow portion of a dance fashionable in the early 1820's
'  - As the fast music returns, we see Old Salieri being carried out of his house on a stretcher by two attendants, and placed in a horse-drawn wagon under the supervision of a middle- aged doctor in a tall hat
This is
He gets in beside his patient
The driver whips up the horse, and the wagon dashes off through the still-falling snow
: - The wagon is galloping through the snowy streets of the city
Inside the conveyance we see Old Salieri wrapped in blankets, half-conscious, being held by the hospital attendants
Doctor Gulden stares at him grimly
The wagon arrives outside the General Hospital of Vienna
: - wide, white-washed corridor
Doctor Gulden is walking down it with a priest, a man of about forty, concerned, but somewhat self-important
This is Father , Chaplain at the hospital
In the corridor as they walk, we note several patients -- some of them visibly disturbed mentally
All patients wear white linen smocks
Doctor Gulden wears a dark frock-coat; Vogler, a cassock
He's going to live
It's much harder to cut your throat than most people imagine
They stop outside a door
Here we are
Do you wish me to come in with you
No, Doctor
Thank you
Vogler nods and opens the door
'   - bare room - one of the best available in the General Hospital
It contains a bed, a table with candles, chairs, a small forte-piano of the early nineteenth century
As Vogler enters, Old Salieri is sitting in a wheel-chair, looking out the window
His back is to us
The priest closes the door quietly behind him
Herr Salieri
Old Salieri turns around to look at him
We see that his throat is bandaged expertly
He wears hospital garb, and over it the Civilian Medal and Chain with which we will later see the  invest him
What do you want
am Father Vogler
am a Chaplain here
thought you might like to talk to someone
About what
You tried to take your life
You do remember that, don't you
So
In the sight of God that is a sin
What do you want
Do you understand that you have sinned
Gravely
Leave me alone
cannot leave alone a soul in pain
Do you know who  am
You never heard of me, did you
That makes no difference
All men are equal in God's eyes
Are they
Offer me your confession
can offer you God's forgiveness
do not seek forgiveness
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul
Unburden it to me
'm here only for you
Please talk to me
How well are you trained in music
know a little
studied it in my youth
Where
Here in Vienna
Then you must know this
He propels his wheelchair to the forte-piano, and plays an unrecognizable melody
can't say  do
What is it
'm surprised you don't know
It was a very popular tune in its day wrote it
How about this
He plays another tune
This one brought down the house when we played it first
He plays it with growing enthusiasm
: -  - 1780' We see the pretty soprano  , now about twenty-four, dressed in an elaborate mythological Persian costume, singing on stage
She's near the end of a very florid aria by Salieri
The audience applauds wildly
'   -   - 1823 (taking his hands off the keys) Well
regret it is not too familiar
Can you recall no melody of mine was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy
wrote forty operas alone
What about this little thing
Slyly he plays the opening measure of Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik
The priest nods, smiling suddenly, and hums a little with the music
Oh,  know that
That's charming didn't know you wrote that
didn't
That was Mozart
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
You know who that is
Of course
The man you accuse yourself of killing
Ah - you've heard that
All Vienna has heard that
( eagerly) And do they believe it
Is it true
Do you believe it
Should
very long pause
Salieri stares above the priest, seemingly lost in his own private world
For God's sake, my son, if you have anything to confess, do it now
Give yourself some peace
further pause
Do you hear me
He was murdered, Father
Mozart
Cruelly murdered
Pause
(almost whispering) Yes
Did you do it
Suddenly Old Salieri turns to him, a look of extreme innocence
He was my idol
can't remember a time when  didn't know his name
When  was only fourteen he was already famous
Even in Legnago - the tiniest town in Italy -  knew of him
: ,  -  - 1780' There are twelve children and twenty adults in the square
We see the fourteen-year-old Salieri blindfolded, playing a game of Blindman's Bluff with other Italian children, running about in the bright sunshine and laughing
(
) was still playing childish games when he was playing music for kings and emperors
Even the Pope in Rome
: -  - 1780' We see the six-year-old , also blindfolded, seated in a gilded chair on a pile of books, playing the harpsichord for the  and a suite of  and other churchmen
Beside the little boy stands , his father, smirking with pride
(
) admit  was jealous when  heard the tales they told about him
Not of the brilliant little prodigy himself, but of his father, who had taught him everything
The piece finishes
Leopold lowers the lid of the harpsichord and lifts up his little son to stand on it
Mozart removes the blindfold to show a pale little face with staring eyes
Both father and son bow
Papal Chamberlain presents Leopold with a gold snuff box whilst the cardinals decorously applaud
Over this scene Old Salieri speaks
(
) My father did not care for music
He wanted me only to be a merchant, like himself
As anonymous as he was
When  told how  wished  could be like Mozart, he would say, Why
Do you want to be a trained monkey
Would you like me to drag you around Europe doing tricks like a circus freak
How could  tell him what music meant to me
: -  - 1780' Serene music of the Italian Baroque - Pergolesi's Stabat Mater - sung by a choir of boys with organ accompaniment
We see the outside of the 17th-century church sitting in the wide landscape of Lombardy: sunlit fields, a dusty, white road, poplar trees
-  - 1780' The music continues and swells
We see the twelve-year-old Salieri seated between his plump and placid parents in the congregation, listening in rapture
His father is a heavy- looking, self-approving man, obviously indifferent to the music
large and austere Christ on the cross hangs over the altar
Candles burn below his image
(
) Even then a spray of sounded notes could make me dizzy, almost to falling
The boy falls forward on his knees
So do his parents and the other members of the congregation
He stares up at Christ who stares back at him
(
) Whilst my father prayed earnestly to God to protect commerce,  would offer up secretly the proudest prayer a boy could think of
Lord, make me a great composer
Let me celebrate your glory through music - and be celebrated myself
Make me famous through the world, dear God
Make me immortal
After  die let people speak my name forever with love for what  wrote
In return  vow  will give you my chastity - my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life
And  will help my fellow man all  can
Amen and amen
The music swells to a crescendo
The candles flare
We see the Christ through the flames looking at the boy benignly
(
) And do you know what happened miracle
-  - 1780' , a large cooked fish on a thick china plate
Camera pulls back to show the Salieri family at dinner
Father Salieri sits at the head of the table, a napkin tucked into his chin
Mother Salieri is serving the fish into portions and handing them round
Two maiden aunts are in attendance, wearing black, and of course the young boy
Father Salieri receives his plate of fish and starts to eat greedily
Suddenly there is a gasp - he starts to choke violently on a fish bone
All the women get up and crowd around him, thumping and pummeling him, but it is in vain
Father Salieri collapses
'   -   - 1823 Suddenly he was dead
Just like that
And my life changed forever
My mother said, Go
Study music if you really want to
Off with you
And off went as quick as  could and never saw Italy again
Of course,  knew God had arranged it all; that was obvious
One moment  was a frustrated boy in an obscure little town
The next  was here, in Vienna, city of musicians, sixteen years old and studying under Gluck
Gluck, Father
Do you know who he was
The greatest composer of his time
And he loved me
That was the wonder
He taught me everything he knew
And when was ready, introduced me personally to the Emperor
Emperor Joseph - the musical king
Within a few years was his court composer
Wasn't that incredible
Imperial Composer to His Majesty
Actually the man had no ear at all, but what did it matter
He adored my music, that was enough
Night after night  sat right next to the Emperor of Austria, playing duets with him, correcting the royal sight-reading
Tell me, if you had been me, wouldn't you have thought God had accepted your vow
And believe me,  honoured it
was a model of virtue
kept my hands off women, worked hours every day teaching students, many of them for free, sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians - work and work and work, that was all my life
And it was wonderful
Everybody liked me
liked myself
was the most successful musician in Vienna
And the happiest
Till he came
Mozart
: '  -  -  - 1780' grand room crowded with guests
small group of Gypsy musicians is playing in the background
Thirteen members of the Archbishop's orchestra - all wind players, complete with 18th-century wind instruments: elaborate-looking bassoons, basset horns, etc
and wearing their employer's livery - are laying out music on stands at one end of the room
At the other end is a large gilded chair, bearing the arms of the throng of people is standing, talking, and preparing to sit upon the rows of waiting chairs to hear a concert
(
) One day he came to Vienna to play some of his music at the residence of his employer, the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg
Eagerly  went there to seek him out
That night changed my life
We see Salieri, age thirty-one, a neat, carefully turned-cut man in decent black clothes and clean white linen, walking through the crowd of guests
We follow him
(
) As  went through the salon,  played a game with myself
This man had written his first concerto at the age of four; his first symphony at seven; a full-scale opera at twelve
Did it show
Is talent like that written on the face
We see shots of assorted young men staring back at Salieri as he moves through the crowd
(
) Which one of them could he be
Some of the men recognize Salieri and bow respectfully
Then suddenly a servant bearing a large tray of cakes and pastries stalks past
Instantly riveted by the sight of such delights, Salieri follows him out of the Grand Salon
-  - 1780' The servant marches along bearing his tray of pastries aloft
Salieri follows him
The servant turns into: -  - 1780' Salieri's : several tables, dressed to the floor with cloths are loaded with many plates of confectionery
It is, in fact, Salieri's idea of paradise
The servant puts his tray down on one of the tables and withdraws from the room
-  - 1780' Salieri turns away so as not to be noticed by the servant
As soon as the man disappears, Salieri sneaks into the buffet room
-  - 1780' Salieri enters the room and looks about him cautiously
He is salivating with anticipation as he stares at the feast of sweet things
His attention is attracted in particular by a huge pile of dark chocolate balls arranged in the shape of a pineapple
He reaches out a hand to steal one of the balls, but at the same moment he hears giggling coming toward him
He ducks down behind the pastry table
girl -  - rushes into the room
She runs straight across it and hides herself behind one of the tables
After a beat of total silence,  runs into the room, stops, and looks around
He is age twenty-six, wearing a fine wig and a brilliant coat with the insignia of the Archbishop of Salzburg upon it
He is puzzled; Constanze has disappeared
Baffled, he turns and is about to leave the room, when Constanze suddenly squeaks from under the cloth like a tiny mouse
Instantly Mozart drops to all fours and starts crawling across the floor, meowing and hissing like a naughty cat
Watched by an astonished Salieri, Mozart disappears under the cloth and obviously pounces upon Constanze
We hear a high-pitched giggle, which is going to characterize Mozart throughout the film
: -  - 1780' The throng is mostly seated
The musicians are in their places, holding their various exotic-looking wind instruments; the candles are all lit
Majordomo appears and bangs his staff on the floor for attention
Immediately , Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg enters
He is a small self- important figure of fifty in a wig, surmounted by a scarlet skullcap
He is followed by his Chamberlain, the Count
Everyone stands
The Archbishop goes to his throne and sits
His guests sit also
Arco gives the signal to start the music
Nothing happens
Instead, a wind musician gets up, approaches the Chamberlain and whispers in his ear
Arco in turn whispers to the Archbishop
Mozart is not here
Where is he
They're looking for him, Your Grace
-  - 1780' Three servants are opening doors and looking into rooms going off the corridor
: -  - 1780' The guests are turning around and looking at the Archbishop
The musicians are watching
There is puzzlement and a murmur of comment
The Archbishop tightens his lip
(to Arco) We'll start without him
-  - 1780' Mozart is on his knees before the tablecloth, which reaches to the floor
Under it is Constanze
We hear her giggling as he talks
Miaouw
Miaouw
Mouse-wouse
It's Puss-wuss, fangs-wangs
Paws-claws
Pounce-bounce
He grabs her ankle
She screams
He pulls her out by her leg
Stop it
Stop it
They roll on the floor
He tickles her
Stop it
am
am
'm stopping it - slowly
You see
Look, 've stopped
Now we are going back
He tries to drag her back under the table
No
No
No
Yes
Back
Back
Listen - don't you know where you are
Where
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg
Fartsbishop
She laughs delightedly, then addresses an imaginary Archbishop
Your Grace, 've got something to tell you
want to complain about this man
Go ahead, tell him
Tell them all
They won't understand you anyway
Why not
Because here everything goes backwards
People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards
That's stupid
Why
People fart backwards
Do you think that's funny
Yes,  think it's brilliant
You've been doing it for years
He gives a high pitched giggle
Oh, ha, ha, ha
Sra-'m-sick
Sra-'m sick
Yes, you are
You're very sick
No, no
Say it backwards, shit-wit
Sra-'m-sick Say it backwards
(working it out) Sra-'m-sick
Sick - kiss 'm - my Kiss my
Sra-'m-sick - Kiss my arse
Em iram
Em iram
No, 'm not playing this game
No, this is serious
Say it backwards
No
Just say it - you'll see
It's very serious
Em iram
Em iram
Iram - marry Em - marry me
No, no
You're a fiend
'm not going to marry a fiend
dirty fiend at that
Ui-vol-i-tub
Tub - but i-tub - but  vol - love but  love ui - You
love you
The mood becomes suddenly softer
She kisses him
They embrace
Then he spoils it
Tish-'m tee
What's that
What
Tish-'m-tee
Eat Yes
Eat my - ah
Shocked, she strikes at him
At the same moment the music starts in the salon next door
We hear the opening of the Serenade for Thirteen Wind Instruments,
My music
They've started
They've started without me
He leaps up, disheveled and rumpled and runs out of the room
Salieri watches in amazement and disgust
: -  - 1780' The music is louder
Mozart hastens towards the Grand Salon away from the buffet room, adjusting his dress as he goes
-  - 1780' The opening of the Serenade is being tentatively conducted by the leader of the wind-musicians
Guests turn around as Mozart appears - bowing to the Archbishop - and walks with an attempt at dignity to the dais where the wind band is playing
The leader yields his place to the composer and Mozart smoothly takes over conducting
Constanze, deeply embarrassed, sneaks into the room and seats herself at the back
-  - 1780' The music fades down
Salieri stands shocked from his inadvertent eavesdropping
After a second he moves almost in a trance toward the door; the music dissolves
-  - 1780' Mozart is conducting the Adagio from his Serenade (
361), guiding the thirteen wind instrumentalists
The squeezebox opening of the movement begins
Salieri appears at the door at the back of the salon
He stares in disbelief at Mozart
(
) So that was he
That giggling, dirty- minded creature 'd just seen crawling on the floor
Mozart
The phenomenon whose legend had haunted my youth
Impossible
The music swells up and Salieri listens to it with eyes closed - amazed, transported - suddenly engulfed by the sound
Finally it fades down and away and changes into applause
Salieri opens his eyes
The audience is clearly delighted
Mozart bows to them, also delighted
Colloredo rises abruptly, and without looking at Mozart or applauding and leaves the Salon
Count Arco approaches the composer
Mozart turns to him, radiant
Follow me, please
The Archbishop would like a word
Certainly
He follows Arco out of the room, through a throng of admirers
-  - 1780' Mozart and Arco walk side by side
They pass Salieri who is staring at Mozart in fascination
As they disappear, he steals toward the music stands, unable to help himself
Well,  think that went off remarkably well, don't you
Indeed
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it
His Grace is very angry with you
What do you mean
They arrive at the door of Colloredo's private apartment
You are to come in here and ask his pardon
Arco opens the door
'   -  - 1780' The Archbishop is sitting, chatting to quests
Among them are several ladies
Arco approaches him obsequiously
Your Grace
Ah, Mozart
Why
Why what, sir
Why do  have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants
Humiliated
How much provocation am  to endure from you
The more license  allow you, the more you take
The company watches this scene, deeply interested
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me
wish you to return immediately to Salzburg
Your father is waiting for you there patiently
will speak to you further when  come
No, Your Grace
mean with all humility, no
would rather you dismissed me
It's obvious  don't satisfy
Then try harder, Mozart
have no intention of dismissing you
You will remain in my service and learn your place
Go now
He extends his hand to be kissed
Mozart does it with a furious grace, then leaves the room
As he opens the door we see: -  - 1780' group of people who have attended the concert, among them Constanze, are standing outside the private apartment
At sight of the composer they break into sustained applause
Mozart is suddenly delighted
He throws the door wide open so that the guests can see into the private apartment where the Archbishop sits - and he can see them
Colloredo is clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee
He smiles and bows uneasily, as they include him in the small ovation
Mozart stands in the corridor, out of the Archbishop's line of sight, bowing and giggling, and encouraging the applause for the Archbishop with conducting gestures
Suddenly irritated, Colloredo signs to Arco, who steps forward and shuts the door, ending the applause
-  - 1780' Salieri, in this vast room, is standing and looking at the full score of the Serenade
He turns the pages back to the slow movement
Instantly, we again hear its lyrical strains
, Salieri, reading the score of the Adagio in helpless fascination
The music is played against his description of it
(
) Extraordinary
On the page it looked nothing
The beginning simple, almost comic
Just a pulse - bassoons and basset horns - like a rusty squeezebox
Then suddenly - high above it - an oboe, a single note, hanging there unwavering, till a clarinet took over and sweetened it into a phrase of such delight
This was no composition by a performing monkey
This was a music 'd never heard
Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it had me trembling
It seemed to me that was hearing a voice of God
Suddenly the music snaps off
Mozart stands before him as he lays down the score
Excuse me
He takes the score, bows, and struts briskly out of the room
Salieri stares uncomprehendingly after the jaunty little figure
(
) But why
'   -  - 1823 Why
Would God choose an obscene child to be His instrument
It was not to be believed
This piece had to be an accident
It had to be
-  - 1780' At the table sits the   , eating his frugal dinner and sipping goat's milk
He is an intelligent, dapper man of forty, wearing a military uniform
Around him but standing, are his Chamberlain,   : stiff and highly correct
-: a corpulent man of sixty, highly conscious of his position as Director of the Opera
, the Imperial Librarian: a grave but kindly and educated man in his mid-fifties : very Italian, cringing and time-serving, aged about seventy
And Salieri, wearing decorous black, as usual
At a side-table, two Imperial secretaries, using quill pens and inkstands, write down everything of importance that is said
How good is he, this Mozart
He's remarkable, Majesty
heard an extraordinary serious opera of his last month
Idomeneo, King of Crete
- That
most tiresome piece
heard it, too
Tiresome
- young man trying to impress beyond his abilities
Too much spice
Too many notes
Majesty,  thought it the most promising work 've heard in years
Ah-ha
Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him
We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely
agree, Majesty, but 'm afraid it's not possible
The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop
Very small pay,  imagine
'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer
Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre
Excellent, sire
- But not German,  beg your Majesty
Italian is the proper language for opera
All educated people agree on that
Ah-ha
What do you say, Chamberlain
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir
Plain German
For plain people
He looks defiantly at Orsini-Rosenberg
Ah-ha
Kapellmeister
(Italian accent) Majesty,  must agree with Herr Dirretore
Opera is an Italian art, solamente
German is - scusate - too bruta for singing, too rough
Ah-ha
Court Composer, what do you say
think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty
It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention
You are cattivo, Court Composer
(briskly, to Von Strack) want to meet this young man
Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him
Yes, sir
Well
There it is
'  -  - 1780' somber room which serves both as a bedroom and a study
We see a four-poster bed
Also, a marble mantelpiece above which hangs a handsome cross in olivewood, bearing the figure of a severe Christ
Opposite this image sits Salieri at his desk, on which stands a pile of music paper, quill pens and ink
On one side of him is an open forte-piano on which he occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing, with some difficulty
He scratches notes out with his quill, and ruffles his hair - which we see without a powdered wig
There is a knock at the door
Si
servant admits , a young lower-class girl, who appears carrying a basket in which is a box covered with a napkin
She has just come from the baker's shop
Ah
Here she comes
Fraulein Lorl, good morning
Good morning, sir
What have you got for me today
Let me see
Greedily he unwraps the napkin and lifts the lid on the box
Ah-ha
Siena macaroons - my favourites
Give my best thanks to the baker
will, sir
He takes a biscuit and eats
Thank you
Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl
Yes, thank you, sir
Bene
Bene
She gives a little curtsey, flattered and giggling and is shown out
Salieri turns back to his work, chewing
He plays through a complete line of the march
He smiles, pleased with the result
Grazie, Signore
He inclines his head to the Christ above the  fireplace, and starts to play the whole march, including the phrase which pleased him
'  -  -  - 1780' The march continues on the forte-piano as we see Mozart, seated in front of a mirror, wearing an extravagant wig
On either side of him stands a , one of them holding another wig, equally extravagant
Mozart takes off the first wig, to reveal his own blonde hair, of which he is extremely proud, and hands it back
And the other one
The Salesman puts the second wig on his head
Mozart pulls a face of doubt in the mirror
And the other one
He takes it off and the other Salesman replaces it with the first wig on his head
Oh, they're both so beautiful, can't decide
Why don't  have two heads
He giggles
The music stops
-    -  - 1780' door opens
We glimpse in the next room the Emperor Joseph bidding goodbye to a group of military officers standing around a table
Good, good, good
He turns and comes into the salon, where another group awaits him
It consists of Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, Von Swieten and Salieri
The room contains several gilded chairs dotted about, and a forte-piano
Good morning, gentlemen
All bow and say, Good morning, Your Majesty
(to Von Strack) Well, what do you have for me today
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart - Yes, what about him
He's here
Ah-ha
Well
There it is
Good
Majesty,  hope you won't think it improper, but  have written a little March of Welcome in his honour
He produces a paper
What a charming idea
May  see
(handing it over) It's just a trifle, of course
May  try it
Majesty
The Emperor goes to the instrument, sits and plays the first bars of it
Quite well
Delightful, Court Composer
Would you permit me to play it as he comes in
You do me too much honour, Sire
Let's have some fun
(to the waiting Majordomo) Bring in Herr Mozart, please
But slowly, slowly
need a minute to practice
The Majordomo bows and goes
The Emperor addresses himself to the march
He plays a wrong note
-flat, Majesty
Ah-ha
-  -  - 1780' Taking his instructions literally, the Majordomo is marching very slowly toward the salon door
He is followed by a bewildered Mozart, dressed very stylishly and wearing one of the wigs from the perruqier
-  - 1780' Joseph finishes the march
The door opens
Herr Mozart
Mozart comes in eagerly
Immediately the march begins, played by His Majesty
All the courtiers stand, listening with admiration
Joseph plays well, but applies himself fiercely to the manuscript
Mozart, still bewildered, regards the scene, but does not seem to pay attention to the music itself
It finishes and all clap obsequiously
- Bravo, Your Majesty
Well done, Sire
The Emperor rises, pleased with himself
He snatches the manuscript off the stand and holds it in his hand for the rest of the scene
Gentlemen, gentlemen, a little less enthusiasm,  beg you
Ah, Mozart
He extends his hand
Mozart throws himself to his knees, and to Joseph's discomfort kisses the royal hand with fervour
Your Majesty
No, no, please
It is not a holy relic
(raising Mozart up) You know we have met already
In this very room
Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old
(to the others) He was giving the most brilliant little concert here
As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell
My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did
Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no
Embarrassed, Mozart bursts into a wild giggle
Joseph helps him out
You know all these gentlemen, 'm sure
Von Strack and Bonno nod
The Baron Von Swieten
'm a great admirer of yours, young man
Welcome
Oh, thank you
The Director of our Opera
Count Orsini-Rosenberg
(bowing excitedly) Oh sir, yes
The honour is mine
Absolutely
Orsini-Rosenberg nods without enthusiasm
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri
(taking his hand) Finally
Such an immense joy
Diletto straordinario
know your work well, Signore
Do you know  actually composed some variations on a melody of yours
Really
Mio caro Adone
Ah
funny little tune, but it yielded some good things
And now he has returned the compliment
Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you
(speaking expertly) Really
Oh, grazie, Signore
Sono commosso
un onore per mo eccezionale
Compositore brilliante e famossissimo
He bows elaborately
Salieri inclines himself, dryly
My pleasure
Well, there it is
Now to business
Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you
What do you say
Majesty
(to the courtiers) Did we vote in the end for German or Italian
- Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian
Did we
don't think it was really decided, Director
Oh, German
German
Please let it be German
Why so
Because 've already found the most wonderful libretto
- Oh
Have  seen it
-  don't think you have, Herr Director
Not yet
mean, it's quite n - Of course, 'll show it to you immediately
- think you'd better
Well, what is it about
Tell us the story
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty
It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a - He stops short with a little giggle
Yes, where
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty Seraglio
Ah-ha
- You mean in Turkey
Exactly
- Then why especially does it have to be in German
Well not especially
It can be in Turkish, if you really want
don't care
He giggles again
Orsini-Rosenberg looks at him sourly
(kindly) My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point
Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre
Why not
It's charming
mean, don't actually show concubines exposing their
their
It's not indecent
(to Joseph) It's highly moral, Majesty
It's full of proper German virtues swear it
Absolutely
Well, 'm glad to hear that
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be
Being a foreigner,  would love to learn
Cattivo again, Court Composer
Well, tell him, Mozart
Name us a German virtue
Love, Sire
Ah, love
Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that
The Italian faction - Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno - laugh discreetly
No,  don't think you do
mean watching Italian opera, all those male sopranos screeching
Stupid fat couples rolling their eyes about
That's not love - it's just rubbish
An embarrassed pause
Bonno giggles in nervous amusement
Majesty, you choose the language
It will be my task to set it to the finest music ever offered a monarch
Pause
Joseph is clearly pleased
Well, there it is
Let it be German
He nods - he has wanted this result all the time
He turns and makes for the door
All bow
Then he becomes aware of the manuscript in his hand
Ah, this is yours
Mozart does not take it
Keep it, Sire, if you want to
It is already here in my head
What
On one hearing only
think so, Sire, yes
Pause
Show me
Mozart bows and hands the manuscript back to the Emperor
Then he goes to the forte-piano and seats himself
The others, except for Salieri, gather around the manuscript held by the King
Mozart plays the first half of the march with deadly accuracy
(to Salieri) The rest is just the same, isn't it
He plays the first half again but stops in the middle of a phrase, which he repeats dubiously
That really doesn't work, does it
All the courtiers look at Salieri
Did you try this
Wouldn't it be just a little more -
He plays another phrase
Or this - yes, this
Better
He plays another phrase
Gradually, he alters the music so that it turns into the celebrated march to be used later in The Marriage of Figaro, Non Piu Andrai
He plays it with increasing abandon and virtuosity
Salieri watches with a fixed smile on his face
The court watches, astonished
He finishes in great glory, takes his hands off the keys with a gesture of triumph - and grins
'  -  - 1780' We see the olivewood cross
Salieri is sitting at his desk, staring at it
Grazie, Signore
There is a knock at the door
He does not hear it, but sits on
Another knock, louder
Yes
Lorl comes in
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir
Bene
He gets up and enters: '  -  - 1780' , a young, high-spirited soprano of twenty is waiting for him, dressed in a fashionable dress and wearing on her head an exotic turban of satin, with a feather
Lorl exits
(curtseying to him) Maestro
Good morning
(posing, in her turban) Well
How do you like it
It's Turkish
My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year
Really
What else did he tell you today
Give me some gossip
Well,  heard you met Herr Mozart
Oh
News travels fast in Vienna
And he's been commissioned to write an opera
Is it true
Yes
Is there a part for me
No
How do you know
Well even if there is,  don't think you want to get involved with this one
Why not
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear
Where
In a harem
What's that
brothel
Oh
Turkish brothel
Turkish
Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different
want to be in it
My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk
He seats himself at the forte-piano
Oh
Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway
Perhaps
He plays a chord
She sings a scale, expertly
He strikes another chord
She starts another scale, then breaks off
What does he look like
You might be disappointed
Why
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina
(airily) Looks don't concern me, Maestro
Only talent interests a woman of taste
He strikes the chord again, firmly
Cavalieri sings her next scale, then another one, and another one, doing her exercises in earnest
As she hits a sustained high note the orchestral accompaniment in the middle of Martern Aller Arten from Il Seraglio comes in underneath and the music changes from exercises to the exceedingly florid aria
We  on the singer's face, and she is suddenly not merely turbaned, but painted and dressed totally in a Turkish manner, and we are on: -  - 1780' The heroine of the opera (Cavalieri) is in full cry addressing the Pasha with scorn and defiance
The house is full
Watching the performance - which is conducted by Mozart from the clavier in the midst of the orchestra - we note Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno and Von Swieten, all grouped around the Emperor, in a box
In another box we see an overdressed, middle-aged woman and three girls, one of whom is Constanze
This is the formidable and her three daughters, Constanze,  and All are enraptured by the spectacle and Madame Weber is especially enraptured by being there at all
Not so, Salieri, who sits in another box, coldly watching the stage
Cavalieri is singing Martern aller Arten from the line Doch du bist entschlossen
Since you are determined, Since you are determined, Calmly, with no ferment, Welcome - every pain and woe
Bind me then - compel me
Bind me then - compel me
Hurt me
Break me
Kill me
At last  shall be freed by death
After a few moments of this showy aria, with the composer and the singer staring at each other - he conducting elaborately for her benefit, and she following his beat with rapturous eyes - the music fades, and Salieri speaks over it
(
) There she was
had no idea where they met - or how - yet there she stood on stage for all to see
Showing off like the greedy songbird she was
Ten minutes of ghastly scales and arpeggios, whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground
Music up again for the last 30 bars of the aria
(singing) Be freed at last by death
Be freed at last by death
At last  shall be freed By
Death
Before the orchestral coda ends, cut to: '   -  - 1823 Through the window we see that night has fallen
Understand,  was in love with the girl
Or at least in lust
wasn't a saint
It took me the most tremendous effort to be faithful to my vow
swear to you  never laid a finger on her
All the same, couldn't bear to think of anyone else touching her - least of all the Creature
: -  -  - 1780' The brilliant Turkish finale of Seraglio bursts over us
All the cast is lined up on stage
Mozart is conducting with happy excitement
(singing) Pasha Selim May he Live forever
Ever, ever, ever, ever
Honour to his regal name
Honour to his regal name
May his noble brow emblazon Glory, fortune, joy and fame
Honour be to Pasha Selim Honour to his regal name
Honour to his regal name
The curtains fall
Much applause
The Emperor claps vigorously and - following his lead - so do the courtiers
The curtains part
Mozart applauds the singers who applaud him back
He skips up onto the stage amongst them
The curtains fall again as they all bow
In the auditorium, the chandeliers descend, filling it with light
-   -  - 1780' The curtains are down, and an excited hubbub of singers in costume surround Mozart and Cavalieri, all excited and chattering
Suddenly a hush
The Emperor is seen approaching from the wings, lit by flunkies holding candles
Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg and Von Swieten, amongst others, follow him
Also Salieri
The singers line up
Joseph stops at Cavalieri who makes a deep curtsey
Bravo, Madame
You are an ornament to our stage
Majesty
(to Salieri) And to you, Court Composer
Your pupil has done you great credit
-   -  - 1780' Let us pass, please
Let us pass at once
We're with the Emperor
am sorry, Madame
It is not permitted
Do you know who  am
(pointing to Constanze) This is my daughter
am Frau Weber
We are favoured guests
am sorry, Madame, but  have my orders
Call Herr Mozart
You call Herr Mozart immediately
This is insupportable
Mother, please
Go ahead, Constanze
Just ignore this fellow
(pushing her) Go ahead, dear
(barring the way) am sorry, Madame, but no
cannot let anyone pass
Young man,  am no stranger to theatres
'm no stranger to insolence
: -   -  - 1780' All are applauding Cavalieri
The Emperor turns to Mozart
Well, Herr Mozart
good effort
Decidedly that
An excellent effort
You've shown us something quite new today
Mozart bows frantically: he is over-excited
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire
Yes, indeed
And German
Oh, yes
Absolutely
German
Unquestionably
So then you like it
You really like it, Your Majesty
Of course  do
It's very good
Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate
What do you mean, Sire
Well,  mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say
(he stops in difficulty; to Orsini- Rosenberg) How shall one say, Director
- Too many notes, Your Majesty
Exactly
Very well put
Too many notes
don't understand
There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required
Neither more nor less
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening
think 'm right in saying that, aren't , Court Composer
Yes
yes
er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty
(to Salieri) But this is absurd
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard
Your work is ingenious
It's quality work
And there are simply too many notes, that's all
Cut a few and it will be perfect
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty
Pause
General embarrassment
Well
There it is
Into this uncomfortable scene bursts a sudden eruption of noise and Madame Weber floods onto the stage, followed by her daughters
All turn to look at this amazing spectacle
Wolfi
Wolfi, my dear
She moves toward Mozart with arms outstretched in an absurd theatrical gesture, then sees the Emperor
She stares at him, mesmerized, her mouth open, unable even to curtsey
Oh
Mozart moves forward quickly
Majesty, this is Madame Weber
She is my landlady
Enchanted, Madame
Oh, Sire
such an honour
And, and, and these are my dear daughters
This is Constanze
She is the fiancee of Herr Mozart
Constanze curtsies
, of Cavalieri, astonished at the news
, of Salieri, watching her receive it
Really
How delightful
May  ask when you marry
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty
Not entirely
Not altogether
He giggles uncomfortably
Excuse me, but how old are you
Twenty-six
Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna
You see
You see
've told him that, Your Majesty, but he won't listen to me
Cavalieri is glaring at Mozart
Mozart looks hastily away from her
Oh, Your Majesty, you give such wonderful - such impeccable - such royal advice
-  - May
She attempts to kiss the royal hand, but faints instead
The Emperor contemplates her prone body and steps back a pace
Well
There it is
Strack
He nods pleasantly to all and leaves the stage, with his Chamberlain
All bow
Cavalieri turns with a savage look at Mozart and leaves the stage the opposite way, to her dressing room, tossing her plumed head
Salieri watches
Mozart stays for a second, indecisive whether to follow the soprano or help Madame Weber
(to Mozart) Get some water
He hurries away
The daughters gather around Madame Weber
'   -  - 1780' Katherina sits fuming at her mirror
dresser is taking the pins out of her wig as she stares straight ahead of her
Mozart sticks his head round the door
Katherina
'll tell you what 'm going to do
'm going to write another aria for you
Something even more amazing for the second act have to get some water
Her mother is lying on the stage
Don't bother
What
Don't bother
'll be right back
He dashes off
-  -  - 1780' Constanze and Mozart make their way quickly through a crowd of actors in turbans and caftans, and stagehands carrying bits of the dismantled set of Seraglio
We see all the turmoil of backstage after a performance
fireman passes Mozart carrying a small bucket of water
Mozart snatches it from him and pushes his way through the crowd to Madame Weber, who still lies prone on the stage
Mozart pushes through the crowd surrounding her and throws water on her face
She is instantly revived by the shock
Constanze assists her to rise
Are you all right
Instead of being furious, Madame Weber smiles at them rapturously
Ah, what an evening
What a wise man we have for an Emperor
Oh, my children
(with sudden, hard briskness) Now  want you to write your father exactly what His Majesty said
The activity continues to swirl around them
You should really go home now, Frau Weber
Your carriage must be waiting
But aren't you taking us
have to talk to the singers
That's all right; we'll wait for you
Just don't take all night
'   -  - 1780' Cavalieri, still in costume, is marching up and down, very agitated
Did you know
Had you heard
What
The marriage
Well, what does it matter to you
Nothing
He can marry who he pleases
don't give a damn
She catches him looking at her and tries to compose herself
How was
Tell me honestly
You were sublime
What did you think of the music
Extremely clever
Meaning you didn't like it
Mozart comes in unexpectedly
Oh - excuse me
Is her mother still lying on the floor
No, she's fine
'm so relieved
She seats herself at her mirror and removes her wig
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations
Did you like it, then
How could  not
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today
Don't you agree
Is she a good fuck
What
assume she's the virtuoso in that department
There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that
Salieri looks astonished
There is a knock on the door
Come in
The door opens
Constanze enters
Excuse me, Wolfi
Mama is not feeling very well
Can we leave now
Of course
No, no, no, no
You can't take him away now
This is his night
Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang
Excuse us, Fraulein
Good night, Signore
Mozart hurries Constanze out of the door
Cavalieri looks after them as they go, her voice breaking and rising out of control
You really are full of surprises, aren't you
You are quite extraordinary, you little shit
She turns and collapses, crying with rage, into Salieri's arms
We focus on him
(
) At that moment  knew beyond any doubt
He'd had her
The Creature had had my darling girl
'   -  - 1820' The old man speaks passionately to the priest
It was incomprehensible
What was God up to
Here  was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married
- and no rebuke at all
Was it possible was being tested
Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful
That was very possible
All the same, why him
Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility
My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man
For the first time in my life  began to know really violent thoughts
couldn't stop them
Did you try
Every day
Sometimes for hours would pray
'  -  -  - 1780' The young Salieri is kneeling in desperation before the Cross
Please
Please
Send him away, back to Salzburg
For his sake as well as mine
, Christ staring from the Cross
: - '  -  -  - 1780' We see Leopold kneeling now not to the Cross but to Archbishop Colloredo, sitting impassively on his throne
Count Arco stands beside him
Leopold is a desperate, once-handsome man of sixty, now far too much the subservient courtier
No
won't have him back
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace
He needs me and he needs you
Your protection, your understanding
Hardly
Oh sir, yes
He's about to make the worst mistake of his life
Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage
know my son
He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him
'm not surprised
Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship
He has sold himself to Vienna
Let Vienna look out for him
Sir - Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat
Yes, sir, that's the truth
But don't blame him
The fault is mine
was too indulgent with him
But not again
Never again,  promise
implore you - let me bring him back here
'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully
And how will you make him keep it
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything
Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance
You have leave to try
Oh, Your Grace -  thank Your Grace
thank you
In deepest gratitude he kisses the Archbishop's hand
He motions Leopold to rise
We hear the first dark fortissimo chord which begins the Overture to Don Giovanni: the theme associated with the character of the Commendatore
(
) My dear son
The second fortissimo chord sounds
-  - 1780' We see a huge , of Mozart's head, looking front and down, as if reading his father's letter
We hear Leopold's voice over this image, no longer whining and anxious, but impressive
(
) write to you with urgent news am coming to Vienna
Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet
You are too gullible to see your own danger
As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as  bid, and await my coming
will
The camera pulls back to see that he is in fact kneeling beside Constanze
faces them
Behind them are Madame Weber, Josefa and Sophie Weber, and a very few others
Among them, a merry looking lady in bright clothes: the And will you, Constanze Weber, take this man, Wolfgang to be your lawful husband
will
now pronounce you man and wife
The opening kyrie of the great Mass in  Minor is heard
Mozart and Constanze kiss
They are in tears
Madame Weber and her daughters look on approvingly
The music swells and continues under the following: '  -  -  - 1780' There is a view of a castle in background
Leopold sits alone in his room
He is reading a letter from Wolfgang
At his feet are his trunks, half-packed for the journey he will not now take
We hear Mozart's voice reading the following letter and we see, as the camera roves around the room, mementos of the young prodigy's early life: the little forte-piano made for him; the little violin made for him; an Order presented to him
We see a little starling in a wicker cage
And we see portraits of the boy on the walls, concluding with the familiar family portrait of Wolfgang and his sister Nannerl seated at the keyboard with Leopold standing, and the picture of their mother on the wall behind them
(
) Most beloved father, it is done
Do not blame me that  did not wait to see your dear face
knew you would have tried to dissuade me from my truest happiness and  could not have borne it
Your every word is precious to me
Remember how you have always told me Vienna is the City of Musicians
To conquer here is to conquer Europe
With my wife can do it
vow  will become regular in my habits and productive as never before
She is wonderful, Papa, and  know that you will love her
And one day soon when  am a wealthy man, you will come and live with us, and we will be so happy long for that day, best of Papas, and kiss your hand a hundred thousand times
The music of the Mass fades as Leopold crumples the letter in his hand
-  -  - 1780' Salieri stands waiting, hat in hand
Beside him stands a royal servant
Behind him, gardeners are glimpsed tending the shrubs and bushes along a grassy ride
Down this ride are seen cantering two people on horseback: the Emperor Joseph and his niece, the
They are mounted on glossy horses
The Princess rides side-saddle
Running beside her is a panting groom
The Emperor rides elegantly; his niece, a dumpy little Hapsburg girl of sixteen, like a sack of potatoes
As they draw level with Salieri they stop, and the groom holds the head of the Princess' horse
Salieri bows respectfully
Good morning, Court Composer
This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth
Your Highness
Out of breath, the Princess nods nervously
She has asked me to advise her on a suitable musical instructor
think 've come up with an excellent idea
He smiles at Salieri
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour
'm thinking about Herr Mozart
What is your view
Salieri's face falls, almost imperceptibly
An interesting idea, Majesty
But - Yes
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart
And the result satisfies
Yes, of course
My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism
Ah-ha
Favouritism
But  so want Mozart
'm sure there is a way, Majesty
Some kind of a little contest could perhaps put together a small Committee, and  could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes
You please me, Court Composer very clever idea
(bowing) Sire
Well
There it is
He rides on
The groom releases her horse's head, and runs on after the Princess
: '  -  - 1780' Von Strack sits stiffly behind his gilded desk
Mozart stands before him, trembling with anger
What is this, Herr Chamberlain
What is what
Why do  have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee
Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl
Because His Majesty wishes it
Is the Emperor angry with me
On the contrary
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna
No, but 'm the best
little modesty would suit you better
Who is on this committee
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri
Naturally, the Italians
Of course
Always the Italians
Mozart - They hate my music
It terrifies them
The only sound Italians understand is banality
Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection
(singing angrily) Ba-ba
Ba-ba
Ba-ba
Ba-ba
Anything else is morbid
Mozart - Show them one interesting modulation and they faint
Ohime
Morbidezza
Morbidezza
Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music
Look, young man, the issue is simple
If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues
Must
Well,  won't
tell you straight:  will not
: '  -  -  -  - 1780' The room is very small and untidy
Constanze is marching up and down it, upset
Mozart is lying on the bed
think you're mad
You're really mad
Oh, leave me alone
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking
We'd be set up for life
They'll come anyway
They love me here
No, they will not
know how things work in this city
Oh yes
You always know everything
Well, 'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that
You borrowed money from your mother
Yes
Well, don't do that again
How are we going to live, Wolfi
Do you want me to go into the streets and beg
Don't be stupid
All they want to see is your work
What's wrong with that
Shut up
Just shut up
don't need them
This isn't pride
It's sheer stupidity
She glares at him, almost in tears
: '   -   - 1780' Salieri is giving a lesson to a girl student, who is singing the Italian art song, Caro Mio Ben
There is a knock on the door
Yes
enters
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you
Who is she
She didn't say
But she says it's urgent
(to the pupil) Excuse me, my dear
Salieri goes into the salon
: -   - 1780' Constanze stands, closely veiled, holding a portfolio stuffed with manuscripts
The singing lesson ends, with two chords on the instrument
Salieri enters the salon
Constanze drops him a shy curtsey
Excellency
Madame
How can  help you
Shyly, she unveils
Frau Mozart
That's right, Your Excellency
've come on behalf of my hus band
'm - 'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment
How charming
But why did he not come himself
He's terribly busy, sir
understand
He takes the portfolio and puts it on a table
will look at them, of course, the moment  can
It will be an honour
Please give him my warmest
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now
While  wait
'm afraid 'm not at leisure this very moment
Just leave them with me
assure you they will be quite safe
-  really cannot do that, Your Excellency
You see, he doesn't know 'm here
Really
My husband is a proud man, sir
He would be furious if he knew 'd come
Then he didn't send you
No, sir
This is my own idea
see
Sir, we really need this job
We're desperate
My husband spends far more than he can ever earn
don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long
It's just
he's not practical
Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency
know you help musicians
You're famous for it
Give him just this one post
We'd be forever indebted
short pause
Let me offer you some refreshment
Do you know what these are
He indicates a dish piled high with glazed chestnuts
Cappezzoli di Venere
Nipples of Venus
Roman chestnuts in brandied sugar
Won't you try one
They're quite surprising
He offers her the dish
She takes one and puts it in her mouth
He watches carefully
Oh
They're wonderful
He takes one himself
We notice on his finger a heavy gold signet-ring
Thank you very much, Your Excellency
Don't keep calling me that
It puts me at such a distance
was not born a Court Composer, you know
'm from a small town, just like your husband
He smiles at her
She takes another chestnut
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again
have other things you might like
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, 'm afraid
Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing
You see, they're all originals
Originals
Yes
pause
He puts out his hand and takes up the portfolio from the table
He opens it
He looks at the music
He is puzzled
These are originals
Yes, sir
He doesn't make copies
: '   -  - 1823 The old man faces the Priest
Astounding
It was actually beyond belief
These were first and only drafts of music yet they showed no corrections of any kind
Not one
Do you realize what that meant
Vogler stares at him
He'd simply put down music already finished in his head
Page after page of it, as if he was just taking dictation
And music finished as no music is ever finished
'  -   - 1780' , The manuscript in Mozart's handwriting
The music begins to sound under the following: (
) Displace one note and there would be diminishment
Displace one phrase, and the structure would fall
It was clear to me
That sound  had heard in the Archbishop's palace had been no accident
Here again was the very voice of God
was staring through the cage of those meticulous ink- strokes at an absolute, inimitable beauty
The music swells
What we now hear is an amazing collage of great passages from Mozart's music, ravishing to Salieri and to us
The Court Composer, oblivious to Constanze, who sits happily chewing chestnuts, her mouth covered in sugar, walks around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping them on the floor when he is done with them
We see his agonized and wondering face: he shudders as if in a rough and tumbling sea; he experiences the point where beauty and great pain coalesce
More pages fall than he can read, scattering across the floor in a white cascade, as he circles the room
Finally, we hear the tremendous Qui Tollis from the Mass in Minor
It seems to break over him like a wave and, unable to bear any more of it, he slams the portfolio shut
Instantly, the music breaks off, reverberating in his head
He stands shaking, staring wildly
Constanze gets up, perplexed
Is it no good
pause
It is miraculous
Oh yes
He's really proud of his work
Another pause
So, will you help him
Salieri tries to recover himself
Tomorrow night  dine with the Emperor
One word from me and the post is his
Oh, thank you, sir
Overjoyed, she stops and kisses his hand
He raises her - and then clasps her to him clumsily
She pushes herself away
Come back tonight
Tonight
Alone
What for
Some service deserves service in return
No
What do you mean
Isn't it obvious
They stare at one another: Constanze in total disbelief
It's a post all Vienna seeks
If you want it for your husband, come tonight
But
'm a married woman
Then don't
It's up to you
Not to be vague, that is the price
He glares at her
Yes
He rings a silver bell for a servant and abruptly leaves the roam
Constanze stares after him, horrified
The servant enters
Shocked and stunned, Constanze goes down an her knees and starts picking up the music from the floor
: '   -  - 1823 , Father Vogler, horrified
Yes, Father
Yes
So much for my vow of chastity
What did it matter
Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter
Had goodness made me a good composer
realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art
And  was nothing to God
(crying out) You cannot say that
No
Was Mozart a good man
God's ways are not yours
And you are not here to question Him
Offer him the salt of penitence
He will give you back the bread of eternal life
He is all merciful
That is all you need to know
All  ever wanted was to sing to Him
That's His doing, isn't it
He gave me that longing - then made me mute
Why
Tell me that
If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent
Go on, tell me
Speak for Him
My son, no one can speak for God
Oh
thought you did so every day
So speak now
Answer me
do not claim to unravel the mysteries
treasure them
As you should
(impatiently) Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Always the same stale answers
(intimately to the priest) There is no God of Mercy, Father
Just a God of torture
: '  -  -  - 1780' Salieri sits at his desk, staring up at the cross
(
) Evening came to that room
sat there not knowing whether the girl would return or not
prayed as 'd never prayed before
Dear God, enter me now
Fill me with one piece of true music
One piece with your breath in it, so  know that you love me
Please
Just one
Show me one sign of your favour, and will show mine to Mozart and his wife
will get him the royal position, and if she comes, 'll receive her with all respect and send her home in joy
Enter me
Enter me
Please
Te imploro
Long, long silence
Salieri stares at the cross
Christ stares back at him impassively
Finally in this silence we hear a faint knocking at the door
Salieri stirs himself
servant appears
That lady is back, sir
Show her in
Then go to bed
The Servant bows and leaves
We follow him through: '  -  - 1780' The Servant crosses it and enters: '  -  - 1780' Constanze is sitting on an upright chair, veiled as before, the portfolio of music on her lap
Through the far door leading from the hall, another servant is peering at her
The first servant joins him and shuts the door on the girl, leaving her alone
We stay with her
The clock ticks on the mantelpiece
We hear an old carriage pass in the street below
Nervously she lifts her veil and looks about her
Suddenly Salieri appears from the music room
He is pale and very tight
They regard each other
She smiles and rises to greet him, affecting a relaxed and warm manner, as if to put him at his ease
Well, 'm here
My husband has gone to a concert
He didn't think  would enjoy it
pause
do apologize for this afternoon
behaved like a silly girl
Where shall we go
What
Should we stay here
It's a charming room
love these candlesticks
Were they here earlier
didn't notice them  suppose  was too nervous
As she talks, she extinguishes the candles in a pair of Venetian candelabra and subsequently other candles around the room
Wolfgang was given some candlesticks by King George in England, but they were only wood
Oh, excuse me
Let's not talk about him
What do you think of this
It's real lace
Brussels
She turns and takes off her shawl
Well, it's much too good for every day
keep saying to Wolfi, don't be so extravagant
Presents are lovely, but we can't afford them
It doesn't do any good
The more tell him, the more he spends
Oh, excuse me
There  go again
She picks up the portfolio
Do you still want to look at this
Or don't we need to bother anymore
imagine we don't, really
She looks at him inquiringly, and drops the portfolio on the floor; pages of music pour out of it
Instantly we hear a massive chord, and the great Qui Tollis from the Mass in Minor fills the room
To its grand and weighty sound, Constanze starts to undress, watched by the horrified Salieri
Between him and her, music is an active presence, hurting and baffling him
He opens his mouth in distress
The music pounds in his head
The candle flickers over her as she removes her clothes and prepares for his embrace
Suddenly he cries out
Go
Go
Go
He snatches up the bell and shakes it frantically, not stopping until the two servants we saw earlier appear at the door
The music stops abruptly
They stare at the appalled and frightened Constanze, who is desperately trying to cover her nakedness
Show this woman out
Constanze hurls herself at him
You shit
You shit
You rotten shit
He seizes her wrists and thrusts her back
Then he leaves the room quickly, slamming the door behind him
Constanze turns and sees the two servants goggling at her in the room
What are you staring at
Wildly, she picks up the candelabrum and throws it at them
It shatters on the floor
'  -  -  - 1780' , Salieri standing, his eyes shut, shaking in distress
He opens them and sees Christ across the room, staring at him from the wall
(
) From now on, we are enemies, You and : '   -  - 1823 The old man is reliving the experience
Vogler looks at him, horrified
Because You will not enter me, with all my need for you; because You scorn my attempts at virtue; because You choose for Your instrument a boastful, lustful, smutty infantile boy and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the Incarnation; because You are unjust, unfair, unkind,  will block You
swear it
will hinder and harm Your creature on earth as far as  am able
will ruin Your Incarnation
: '  -  -  - 1780' , the fireplace
In it lies the olivewood Christ on the cross, burning
(
) What use after all is Man, if not to teach God His lessons
The cross flames up and disintegrates
Salieri stares at it
: '  -   -  - 1780' The front door bursts open
Mozart stumbles in, followed by , three young actresses, and another man, all fairly drunk
Schikaneder (who appears everywhere accompanied by young girls) is a large, fleshy, extravagant man of about thirty-five
Stanzi
Stanzi
Stanzi-Manzi
The others laugh
Sssh
(imitating Mozart) Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi
Sssh
Stay here
He walks unsteadily to the bedroom door and opens it
(to the girls, very tipsy) Sssh
You're dishgrashful
'  -  -  - 1780' Constanze lies in bed, her back turned to her husband, who comes into the room and shuts the door
(playfully) Stanzi
How's my mouse
Mouse-wouse
'm back - puss-wuss is back
She turns around abruptly
She looks dreadful; her eyes red with weeping
Mozart is shocked
Stanzi
He approaches the bed and sits on it
Immediately she starts crying again, desperately
What's the matter
What is it
Stanzi
He holds her and she clings to him in a fierce embrace, crying a flood of tears
Stop it now
Stop it
've brought some friends to meet you
They're next door waiting
Do we have anything to eat
They're all starving
Tell them to go away
don't want to see anybody
What's the matter with you
Tell them to go
Sssh
What is it
Tell me
No
Yes
love you
love you
She starts crying again, throwing her arms around his neck
love you
Please stay with me
'm frightened
-   -  - 1780' Joseph sits eating
butler serves him goat's milk to drink
Joseph is holding a memorandum from Salieri in his hand
Salieri stands before him
don't think you understand me, Court Composer
Majesty,  did
Believe me, it was a most agonizing
decision
But finally, simply could not recommend Herr Mozart
Why not
Well, Sire,  made some inquiries in a routine way
was curious to know why he had so few pupils
It is rather alarming
Oh
With a gesture Joseph dismisses the butler, who bows and leaves the room
Majesty,  don't like to talk against a fellow musician
Of course not
have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies
Really
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well
Yes
Molested, Majesty
Twice, in the course of the same lesson
pause
Ah-ha
Well
There it is
'  -  -  -  - 1780' Salieri has just returned from the palace and is coming up the staircase
He is met by his servant
Sir, there is a Herr Mozart waiting for you in the salon
Salieri is plainly alarmed
What does he want
He didn't say, sir
told him didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting
Come with me
And stay in the room
He mounts the stairs
'  -  -  - 1780' Mozart is waiting for Salieri, holding a portfolio
Salieri approaches him nervously
Mozart stands not belligerently, but humbly
Herr Mozart, what brings you here
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work
Here they are
don't have to tell you how much need your help
truly appreciate your looking at these
have pressures on me - financial pressures
As you know, 'm a married man now
So you are
How is your pretty wife
She is well
She is - well, actually, 'm about to become a father
She only told me last night
You are the first to know
'm flattered
And congratulations to you, of course
So you see, this post is very important to me right now
Salieri looks at him in distress
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart
This is a most painful situation
Yesterday  could have helped you
Today,  can't
Why
Here is the music
It's here
am submitting it humbly
Isn't that what you wanted
have just come from the palace
The post has been filled
Filled
That's impossible
They haven't even seen my work
need this post
Please, can't you help me
Please
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world  would rather help, but now it is too late
Whom did they choose
Herr Sommer
Sommer
Herr Sommer
But the man's a fool
He's a total mediocrity
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity
But  can't lose this post,  simply can't
Excellency, please
Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice
He could actually do musical harm to the Princess
An implausible idea
Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth
Mozart chuckles delightedly
Salieri offers him a glass of white dessert and a spoon
Mozart takes it absently and goes on talking
Look,  must have pupils
Without pupils  can't manage
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty
No, but 'm broke
'm always broke
don't know why
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means
How can anyone say that
We have no cook, no maid
We have no footman
Nothing at all
How is that possible
You give concerts, don't you
hear they are quite successful
They're stupendously successful
You can't get a seat
The only problem is none will hire me
They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters
As if was some kind of fiend
'm not a fiend
Of course not
Do you have a daughter
'm afraid not
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one
Then 'll teach her for free
That's a promise
Oh, 'm sorry
'm being silly
Papa's right -  should put a padlock on my mouth
Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan
Only for six months, eight at most
After that 'll be the richest man in Vienna
'll pay you back double
Anything
Name your terms
'm not joking
'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe
Ah, how exciting
Tell me more
'd better not
It's a bit of a secret
Come, come, Mozart; 'm interested
Truly
Actually, it's a big secret
Oh, this is delicious
What is it
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum
Crema al Mascarpone
Ah
Italian
Forgive me
We all have patriotic feelings of some kind
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all  need  hundred
Fifty
What exactly are you working on
can't say
Really don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart
However,  know a very distinguished gentleman  could recommend to you
And he has a daughter
Will that do
'  -  - 1780' Hysterical barking and howling
The hall is full of dogs, at least five, all jumping up and dashing about and making a terrific racket
Mozart, dandified in a new coat and a plumed hat for the occasion, has arrived to teach at the house of a prosperous merchant,
Bluff, friendly and coarse-looking, he stands in his hall amidst the leaping and barking animals, greeting Mozart
Quiet
Quiet
Quiet
Down there, damn you
(to Mozart) Welcome to you
Pay no attention, they're impossible
Stop it, you willful things
Come this way
Just ignore them
They're perfectly harmless, just willful
treat them just like my own children
And which one of them do you want me to teach
What
Ha-ha
That's funny -  like it
Which one, eh
You're a funny fellow
(shouting) Hannah
Come this way
He leads Mozart through the throng of dogs into a salon furnished with comfortable middle-class taste
Hannah
appears: an anxious woman in middle life
(to Mozart) You won't be teaching this one either
She's my wife
(bowing) Madame
This is Herr Mozart, my dear
The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude
Where is she
Upstairs
Gertrude
You can't be Herr Mozart
'm afraid  am
Of course, it's him
Who do you think it is
've heard about you for ages thought you must be an old man
Gertrude
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart
And for Gertrude
People who know say the girl's got talent
You must judge for yourself
If you think she stinks, say so
Michael, please
'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart
She's really very excited
She's been preparing all morning
Really
Ah, now
Here she comes
appears in the doorway: an awkward girl of fifteen in her best dress, her hair primped and curled
She is exceedingly nervous
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart
Say good morning
Gertrude giggles instead
(to Mozart) Perhaps a little refreshment first
little coffee, or a little chocolate
'd like a little wine, if you have it
Wine
Quite right
He's going to need it
(calling and clapping his hands) Klaus
bottle of wine
Prestissimo
Now let's go to it
've been waiting all day for this
He leads the way into: -  - 1780' forte-piano is open and waiting
All the dogs follow him
After them come Mozart Frau and Fraulein Schlumberg
To Mozart's dismay, husband and wife seat themselves quite formally on a little narrow sofa, side by side
(To the dogs) Now sit down all of you and behave
Zeman, Mandi, absolutely quiet
(to a young beagle) Especially you, Dudelsachs - not one sound from you
The dogs settle at their feet
Husband and wife smile encouragingly at each other
Come on, then
Up and at it
Mozart gestures to the music bench
Reluctantly, the girl sits at the instrument
Mozart sits beside her
Now, please play me something
Just to give me an idea
Anything will do
(to parents) don't want you to stay
That's all right, dear
Just go ahead, as if we weren't here
But you are here
Never mind, Strudel
It's part of music, getting used to an audience
Aren't  right, Herr Mozart
Well, yes
on the whole
suppose
(to Gertrude) How long have you been playing, Fraulein
Just one year
Who was your teacher
was
But she quite outgrew the little  could show her
Thank you, Madame
(to Gertrude) Come on now - courage
Play me something you know
In response the wretched girl just stares down at the keyboard without playing a note
An awkward pause
Perhaps it would be better if we were left alone
think we're both a little shy
Husband and wife look at each other
Nonsense
Strudel's not shy
She's just willful
You give into her now, you'll be sorry later
Strudel - play
Silence
The girl sits unmoving
Schlumberg bellows: said play
Michael
Perhaps if  were to play a little first, it might encourage the Fraulein
(to the girl) Why don't you let me try the instrument
All right
Suddenly the girl rises
Mozart smiles at the parents
They smile nervously back
Mozart slides along the bench, raises his hands and preludes over the keys
Instantly a dog howls loudly
Startled, Mozart stops
Schlumberg leaps to his feet and goes over to the beagle
Stop that, Dudelsachs
Stop it at once
(to Mozart) Don't let him disturb you
He'll be all right
He's just a little willful too
Please, please - play
beg you
Mozart resumes playing
This time it is a lively piece, perhaps the Presto Finale from the
450
The dog howls immediately
Stop it
Mozart stops
No, not you
was talking to the dog
You keep playing
It's most important
He always howls when he hears music
We've got to break them of the habit
Play, please
Please
Amazed, Mozart starts to play the Rondo again
The dog howls louder
That's it
Now keep going, just keep going
(to the beagle) Now you stop that noise, Dudelsachs, you stop it this instant
This instant, do you hear me
Keep going, Herr Mozart, that's it
Go on, go on
Mozart plays on
Suddenly the dog falls silent
Schlumberg smiles broadly
Good, good, good
Very good dog
Very, very good Dudelsachs
(to his wife, snapping his fingers) Quick, quick, dear, bring his biscuit
The wife scurries to get a jar of biscuits
servant brings in an open bottle of wine and a full glass on a tray
He puts it down beside Mozart as Schlumberg addresses the silent dog with deepest affection
Now guess who's going to get a nice reward
Clever, clever Dudi
He gives the biscuit to the dog who swallows it greedily
Mozart stops playing and stands up
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart
(barely controlling himself) Well, 'm a good teacher
The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know
Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame
goodbye, Sir
He bows to them and leaves the room
They look after him in puzzled astonishment
What a strange young man
Yes
He is a little strange
-  - 1780' cheerful scene
We see Mozart strutting and beaming, making his way through the crowd of porters, carriers and hawkers, sellers of sausages and pastries, vendors of hats and ribbons
Horses and carriage clatter past him
His mood is best expressed by a bubbling version of Non piu Andrai played on the forte-piano
Still in the same mood, he enters the door of his own house
'  -  -   - 1780' Suddenly, he stops
He looks up the stairs
The grim opening chords from the Overture to Don Giovanni cut across the march from Figaro
What he sees, looking up the stairs, is a menacing figure in a long, grey cape and dark grey hat, standing on the landing
The light comes from behind the figure so that we see only its silhouette as it unfolds its arms towards Mozart in an alarming gesture of possession
It takes a beat in which the air of sinister mystery is held before Mozart realizes who it is
Then, as the music continues, he hastily sets down the bottle of wine and rushes joyfully up the stairs and hurls himself into the figure's arms
Papa
Both men embrace
The music slowly fades
'   -  - 1780' cramped, low-ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied for ages
We see music lying everywhere
Also there are many empty wine bottles; musical instruments - among them a mandolin, a viola, a forte-piano with the black and white keys reversed - books and abandoned plates of food
Mozart clasps his father's arms
Leopold is now seen as an aging, travel-stained man in clothes that need repair
His face is lined, and he is obviously not in perfect health
Why are you here
Am  not welcome
Of course, welcome
Welcome ten thousand times
Papa
my Papa
He kisses his hands
You're very thin
Does she not feed you, this wife of yours
Mozart ducks away and fetches his father's bags from the landing
Feed
Well, of course she feeds me
She stuffs me like a goose all day long
She's the best cook in the world
mean, since Mama
Just wait, you'll see
Is she not here
don't know
Stanzi
Stanzi
Leopold looks about him at the mess in the room
Do you always live like this
Oh, yes
Oh,  mean no - not exactly like this
mean today - just today, Stanzi -  remember now
She had to go - yes
She had to help her mother
Yes, she's like that
Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see
He carries the bag across the room and opens the door of the bedroom
Constanze lies in bed
She sits up, startled
Oh
didn't know you were home
Stanzi, this is my father
Constanze, who looks ill and tired, stares at Leopold
Leopold stares back from the doorway
We'll wait, we'll wait
Why don't you get up now, darling
He closes the door again
She's very tired, poor creature
You know me: 'm a real pig
It's not so easy cleaning up after me
Don't you have a maid
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it
She wants to do everything herself
How is your financial situation
It couldn't be better
That's not what  hear
What do you mean
It's wonderful
Really, it's - it's marvelous
People love me here
They say you're in debt
Who
Who says that
Now that's a malicious lie
How many pupils do you have
Pupils
Yes
Yes
How many
don't know
It's not important mean,  don't want pupils
They get in the way
've got to have time for composition
Composition doesn't pay
You know that
This one will
He picks up some pages of manuscript
What's that
Oh, let's not talk about it
Why not
It's a secret
You don't have secrets from me
It's too dangerous, Papa
But they're going to love it
Ah, there she is
Constanze comes into the room
She is wearing a dressing gown and has made a perfunctory attempt to tidy her hair
We see that she is clearly pregnant
My Stanzi - look at her
Isn't she beautiful
Come on now, confess, Papa
Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter
Stop it, Wolfi
look dreadful
Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart
He's not Herr Mozart
Call him Papa
see that you're expecting
Oh, yes
When, may  ask
In three months
Papa
Isn't that marvelous
We're delighted
Why didn't you mention it in your letters
Didn't
thought  did
'm sure did
He gives a little giggle of embarrassment
May  offer you some tea, Herr Mozart
Tea
Who wants tea
Let's go out
This calls for a feast
You don't want tea, Papa
Let's go dancing
Papa loves parties, don't you
Wolfi
What
How can you be so boring
Tea
Wolfi,  think your father's tired
'll cook us something here
Thank you
That'll be fine
Don't spend any money on me
Why not
Oh, come, Papa
What better way could  spend it than on you
My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa
The jaunty tune of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein (
539) sounds through all the following
This is an alternate song from Il Seraglio: a very extroverted tune for baritone and orchestra and a prominent part for bass drum
The vocal part should be arranged for trumpet
-  - 1780' Mozart and Constanze with Leopold between them
We see couples shopping
-  -  - 1780' This is a shop where one can buy costumes for masquerades
It is filled with extravagant costumes of various kinds
Wolfgang is wearing a costume, a mask pushed up on his forehead; Constanze is wearing a little white velvet mask
Amidst the merriment, Leopold is helped by two assistants to put on a dark grey cloak and a dark grey tricorne hat, to which is attached a full mask of dark grey
Its mouth is cut into a fixed upward smile
He turns and looks at his son through this mask
: -  -  - 1780' We are in the full whirl of a Masquerade Ball
Couples are dancing around dressed in fantastic costumes
The music of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein increases in volume and persists
We see the musicians thumping it out on a balustrade above the dancers
steer is being roasted
Through the bobbing crowd we see a group, headed by the figure of Bacchus: this is Schikaneder in a Greek costume, wearing vine leaves in his hair
He is accompanied by his usual trio of actresses and three other men
Constanze as Columbine and Mozart as Harlequin are pulling Leopold by the hand of his dark cloak and smiling mask
This whole group threads its way across the crowded room and disappears through a door
As they go, they are watched by Salieri, standing alone in a corner, wearing ordinary evening clothes
He turns away hastily to avoid being seen by them
As soon as they disappear into the far room, Salieri goes quickly to a lady in the corner who is giving guests domino masks off a tray
He quickly takes a small black mask and puts it on
: -  - 1780' fantastic room designed as a rocky grotto, lit by candles
forte-piano to one side is being played by Schikaneder: the music of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein cross-fades to another tune
This is Vivat Bacchus from Il Seraglio which Schikaneder, dressed as Bacchus, is humming as he plays
The music is actually accompanying a game of Forfeits, which has begun
Five couples (the group we have just seen) are dancing in the middle of a ring made by nine chairs
When the music stops they will each have to find a chair, and the one who fails must pay a forfeit
Constanze is dancing with Leopold; Mozart is dancing with one of the actresses; the two other actresses are dancing with two other gentlemen; and two children dance together - a little boy and a little girl
The scene is watched by a circle of bystanders; among them - from the doorway - is Salieri
Schikaneder stops playing
Immediately the couples scramble for the chairs
Leopold and Constanze meet on the same chair, bumping and pushing at each other to get sole possession of it
To the amusement of the people around, the chair over- balances and they both end up on the floor
Constanze immediately gets up again, sets the chair on its feet, and tries to pretend she was sitting in it all the time
But Schikaneder calls out from the forte-piano
No, no
You both lost
You both lost
You both have to forfeit
And the penalty is you must exchange your wigs
People are delighted by the idea of this penalty
The children jump up and down with excitement
The three actresses immediately surround Leopold, reaching for his hat and mask and wig, whilst he tries to hold on to them
Mozart takes off Constanze's wig - an absurd affair with side-curls
Constanze laughingly surrenders it
No, please
This is ridiculous
No, please
Despite his protests an actress takes off his hat, to which the smiling mask is attached, to reveal his outraged face showing a very different expression underneath
Another actress snatches off his wig to reveal very sparse hair on the old man's head
The third actress takes Constanze's wig from Mozart and attempts to put it on his father's head
No, really
(calling to him) This is just a game, Papa
Constanze echoes him with a touch of malice in her voice
This is just a game, Papa
Laughingly, the bystanders take it up, especially the children
This is just a game, Papa
As Leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds in getting Constanze's wig firmly onto his head
Everybody bursts into applause
Delightedly, Constanze puts on Leopold's wig, hat and mask: from the waist up she now looks like a weird parody of Leopold in the smiling grey mask, and he looks like a weird parody of her in the silly feminine wig
Schikaneder starts to play again, and the couples start to dance
Leopold angrily takes off Constanze's wig and leaves the circle; his partner, Constanze, is left alone
Seeing this, Mozart leaves his partner and catches his father entreatingly by the arm
Oh no, Papa, please
Don't spoil the fun
Come on
Here, take mine
He takes off his own wig and puts it on Leopold's uncovered head
The effect, if not as ridiculous, is still somewhat bizarre, since Wolfgang favours fairly elaborate wigs
He takes Constanze's wig from his father
As this happens, the music stops again
Mozart gently pushes his father down onto a nearby chair; the others scramble for the other chairs; and he is left as the Odd Man Out
He giggles
Schikaneder calls out to Leopold from the keyboard
Herr Mozart, why don't you name your son's penalty
Applause
Yes, Papa, name it
Name it
'll do anything you say
want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son
What did he say
What did he say
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room
'm tired of this game
Please play without me
But my penalty
've got to have a penalty
All the bystanders are watching
've got a good one
've got the perfect one for you
Come over here
Mozart runs over to the forte-piano, and Schikaneder surrenders his place at it
Now,  want you to play our tune - sitting backwards
Applause
Oh, that's really too easy
Any child can do that
Amused sounds of disbelief
And a fugue in the manner of Sebastian Bach
Renewed applause at this wicked extra penalty
Mozart smiles at Schikaneder - it is the sort of challenge he loves
He defiantly puts on Constanze's wig and seats himself with his back to the keyboard
Before the astonished eyes of the company he proceeds to execute this absurdly difficult task
His right hand plays the bass part, his left hand the treble, and with this added difficulty he improvises a brilliant fugue on the subject of the tune to which they have been dancing
Attracted by this astonishing feat, the players draw nearer to the instrument
So does Salieri, cautiously, with some of the bystanders
Constanze watches him approach
Only Leopold sits by himself, sulking
The fugue ends amidst terrific clapping
The guests call out to Mozart
Another
Do another
Someone else
Give me a name
Who shall  do
Give me a name
Gluck
Haydn
Frederic Handel
Salieri
Do Salieri
: Salieri's masked face whips around and looks at her
Now that's hard
That's very hard
For Salieri one has to face the right way around
Giggling, he turns around and sits at the keyboard
Then, watched by a highly amused group, he begins a wicked parody
He furrows his brow in mock concentration and closes his eyes
Then he begins to play the tune to which they danced, in the most obvious way imaginable, relying heavily on a totally and offensively unimaginative bass of tonic and dominant, endlessly repeated
The music is the very essence of banality
The bystanders rock with laughter
Mozart starts to giggle wildly
Through this excruciating scene, Salieri stares at Constanze, who suddenly turns her head and looks challengingly back at him
Mozart's parody reaches its coarse climax with him adding a fart noise instead of notes to end cadences
He builds this up, urged on in his clowning by everyone else, until suddenly he stops and cries out
The laughter cuts off
Mozart stands up, clutching his behind as if he has made a mess in his breeches
The momentary hush of alarm is followed by a howl of laughter
, Salieri staring in pain
'   -  - 1823 , The old man is shaking at the very recollection of his humiliation
Go on
Mock me
Laugh, laugh
: -  - 1780' repetition of the shot of Mozart at the forte-piano, wearing Constanze's wig and emitting a shrill giggle
: '  -  -  - 1780' Salieri sits at his desk
He holds in his hand the small black party mask and stares in hatred at the place on the wall where the crucifix used to hang
Faintly we see the mark of the cross
(
) That was not Mozart laughing, Father
That was God
That was God
God laughing at me through that obscene giggle
Go on, Signore
Laugh
Rub my nose in it
Show my mediocrity for all to see
You wait
will laugh at You
Before  leave this earth,  will laugh at You
Amen
'  -  - 1780' It is littered with manuscripts
In the middle stands a billiard table
The beautiful closing ensemble from Act of Figaro: Ah, Tutti contenti
Saremo cosi plays in the background
Standing at the billiard table, Mozart is dreamily hearing the music and playing shots on the table
From time to time he drifts over to a piece of manuscript paper and jots down notes
He is very much in his own world of composition and the billiard balls are an aid to creation
Presently, however, we hear a knocking at the door
(outside the door) Wolfi
Wolfgang
The music breaks off
What is it
He opens the door
There's a young girl to see you
What does she want
don't know
Well, ask her
She won't talk to me
She says she has to speak to you
Oh, damn
'  -   -   - 1780' Mozart comes out
Framed in the doorway from outside stands Lorl, the maid we noticed in Salieri's house
From his bedroom Leopold peeps out to watch
Mozart goes to the girl
Constanze follows
Yes
Are you Herr Mozart
That's right
My name is Lorl, sir
'm a maidservant
was asked to come here and offer my services to you
What
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous
What do you mean
What admirer
can't tell you that, ma'am
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is
Yes
can live in or out just as you wish
Mozart turns to his father
Papa, is this your idea
Mine
The old man emerges from his bedroom
His son looks at him delightedly
Are you playing a trick on me
never saw this girl in my life
(to Lorl) Is this a kind of joke
Not at all, sir
And  was told to wait for an answer
Young woman, this won't do at all
My son can't possibly accept such an offer, no matter how generous, unless he knows who is behind it
But  really can't tell you, sir
Oh, this is ridiculous
What is ridiculous
Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna
They love him here
People send us gifts all the time
But you can't take her without reference
It's unheard of
Well, this is none of your business
(to Lorl) Whoever sent you is going to pay, no
That's right, ma'am
So now we are going to let a perfect stranger into the house
Constanze looks furiously at him, then at Lorl
Who is we
Who is letting who
(to Lorl) Could you please wait outside
Yes, ma'am
Lorl goes outside and closes the door
Constanze turns on Leopold
Look, old man, you stay out of this
We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night
And then you think you can - Stanzi
No, it's right he should hear
'm sick to death of it
We can't do anything right for you, can we
Never mind
You won't have to do anything for me ever again
'm leaving
Papa
Don't worry, 'm not staying here to be a burden
No one calls you that
She does
She says  sleep all day
And so you do
The only time you come out is to eat
And what do you expect
Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day
Oh, now 'm a bad housekeeper
So you are
The place is a pigsty all the time
(to Mozart) Do you hear him
Do you
Explosively she opens the door
(to Lorl) When can you start
Right away, ma'am
Good
Come in
You'll start with that room there
(indicating Leopold's room) It's filthy
She leads the maid into Leopold's room
Mozart steals back into his workroom and gently closes the door
Leopold is left alone
Sorry, sorry
'm sorry  spoke
'm just a provincial from Salzburg
What do  know about smart Vienna
Parties all night, every night
Dancing and drinking like idiot children
'  -  - 1780' Mozart stands trying to blot out the noise of his father's shouting from the next room
(
) Dinner at eight
Dinner at ten
Dinner when anyone feels like it
If anyone feels like it
The ensemble of Ah, Tutti contenti
Saremo cosi from Act of Figaro resumes, coming to his aid and rising to greet the listener with its serene harmonies
Relieved, Mozart languidly picks up his cue and plays a shot on the billiard table: he is sucked back into his own world of sound
'  -  - 1780' The music fades
We see Lorl, dressed in a walking cloak, sitting before a desk, talking to someone confidentially
They're out every night, sir
Till all hours
hand comes into frame offering a plate of sugared biscuits
On its finger we see the gold signet ring belonging to Salieri
(taking one) Oh, thank you, sir
Do any pupils come to the house
Not that 've seen
Then how does he pay for all this
Does he work at all
Oh, yes, sir, all day long
He never leaves the house until evening
He just sits there, writing and writing
He doesn't even eat
Really
What is it he's writing
Oh,  wouldn't know that, sir
Of course not
You're a good girl
You're very kind to do this
Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you
Confused, the girl hesitates
He hands her a pile of coins
Oh, thank you, sir
She accepts them, delighted
'  -   -  - 1780' The final movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto in -flat (
482) begins
To its lively music, the door of the house bursts open and a grand forte-piano augmented with a pedal is carried out of it by six men, who run off with it down the street
Following them immediately appear Wolfgang, Constanze and Leopold, all three dressed for an occasion
They climb into a waiting carriage which drives off after the forte-piano
As soon as it goes, Lorl appears in the doorway, peering slyly around to see that they are out of sight
Then she shuts the door and hurries off in the opposite direction
: -  -  - 1780' An outdoor concert is being given
Mozart is actually playing the final movement of his -flat concerto with an orchestra
Listening to him is a sizable audience, including the Emperor, flanked by Strack and Von Swieten
The crowd is in a happy and appreciative mood: it is a delightful open-air scene
We hear the gayest and most complex passage
Leopold and Constanze listen to Mozart, who plays his own work brilliantly
We stay with this scene for a little while and then : -  - 1780' carriage clopping through the streets
Lorl is sitting up on the box beside the driver
Inside the vehicle, we glimpse the figure of Salieri
-  - 1780' We hear more of the concerto
Perhaps the slow interlude in the last movement of
482
Mozart is conducting and playing in a reflective mood
Abruptly we : '   -  - 1780' Lorl is opening the door admitting Salieri
They go in
The door shuts
'   -  - 1780' The room is considerably tidier as a result of Lorl's ministrations
Salieri stands looking about him with tremendous curiosity
think 've found out about the money, sir
Yes what
She opens a drawer in a sideboard
Inside we see one gold snuff box: it is the one we saw Mozart being presented with as a child in the Vatican
He kept seven snuff boxes in here
could swear they were all gold
And now look there's only one left
And inside, sir, look -  counted them - tickets from the pawnshop
Six of them
Salieri turns to look around him
Where does he work
In there, sir
She points across the room to the workroom
Salieri crosses and goes in alone
'  -  - 1780' Salieri enters the private quarters of Amadeus
He is immensely excited
He moves slowly into the 'holy of holies' picking up objects with great reverence - a billiard ball; a discarded wig; a sock; a buckle - then objects more important to him
Standing at Mozart's desk, strewn with manuscripts, he picks up Mozart's pen and strokes the feather
He touches the inkstand
He lays a finger on the candlestick with its half-expired candle
He touches each object as if it were the memento of a beloved
He is in awe
Finally his eye falls on the sheets of music themselves
Stealthily he picks them up
, The pages
We see words set to music
Against each line of notes is the name of a character: Contessa, Susanna, Cherubino
Then another page - the title page - written in Mozart's hand
Le Nozze di Figaro Comedia per musica tratta dal Francese in quattro atti
, The word Figaro
, Salieri
He stares amazed
: -  -  - 1780' Mozart is playing the cadenza and coda of Piano Concerto (
482)
He completes the work with a flourish
There is loud applause
The Emperor rises and all follow suit
Mozart comes down to be greeted by him
Bravo, Mozart
Most charming
Yes, indeed
Clever man
Thank you, Sire
Well done, Mozart
Really quite fine
Baron
He sees his wife and father standing by in the crowd
Leopold is signaling insistently
Majesty, may  ask you to do me the greatest favour
What is it
May  introduce my father
He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg
He would so much like to kiss your hand
It would make his whole stay so memorable for him
Ah
By all means
Leopold comes forward eagerly and fawningly kisses the royal hand
Your Majesty
Constanze curtsies
Good evening
(to Leopold) We have met before, Herr Mozart
That's right, Your Majesty
Twenty years ago
No, twenty-two
twenty- three
And  remember word for word what you said to me
You said - you said -- He searches his memory
Bravo
No
Yes, 'bravo,' of course 'bravo'
Everybody always says 'bravo' when Wolfi plays
Like the King of England
When we played for the King of England, he got up at the end and said, 'Bravo
Bravo
Bravo
' three times
Three bravo's
And the Pope four
Four bravo's from the Holy Father, and one 'bellissimo
' All the courtiers around are looking at him
Father - Hush
'm talking to His Majesty
Your Majesty,  wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers
It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth
' Ah-ha
Well
There it is
: -'  -  - 1780' The Director sits at his table with Salieri and Bonno
've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director
- Yes
Mozart is writing a new opera
An Italian opera
- Italian
Aie
And that's not all
He has chosen for his subject, Figaro
The Marriage of Figaro
- You mean that play
Exactly
- He's setting that play to music
Yes
- You must be mad
What is this Marriage of Figaro
- It's a French play, Kapellmeister
It has been banned by the Emperor
Hah
He crosses himself, wide-eyed with alarm
- Are you absolutely sure
've seen the manuscript
- Where
Never mind
: '  -  - 1780' know we banned this play, but frankly  can't remember why
Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director
- For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France
Oh yes, yes
And that was
- Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet
He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher
Do you see the implications
This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor
Ah
: '  -  - 1780' The Emperor stands in the middle of the room in close conversation with Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Von Swieten, and Bonno
Salieri is not present
door opens and a lackey announces: Herr Mozart
They all turn
Mozart approaches, rather apprehensively, and kisses Joseph's hand
Sit down, gentlemen, please
They all sit, save Mozart
The room suddenly looks like a tribunal
Joseph is in a serious mood
Mozart, are you aware  have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre
Yes, Sire
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it
Is this true
Who told you this, Majesty
It is not your place to ask questions
Is it true
Well, yes,  admit it is
Would you tell me why
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy
- What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point
It is what His Majesty thinks that counts
But, Your Majesty - (motioning him to be silent) Mozart,  am a tolerant man
do not censor things lightly
When do,  have good reason
Figaro is a bad play
It stirs up hatred between the classes
In France it has caused nothing but bitterness
My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people
do not wish to see the same fears starting here
Sire,  swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story have taken out everything that could give offense
hate politics
think you are rather innocent, my friend
In these dangerous times cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece
The others look at their king solemnly, all save Mozart
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic
It's a piece about love
Ah, love again
But it's new, it's entirely new
It's so new, people will go mad for it
For example,  have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling
Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation
Duet turns into trio
Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in
Trio turns into quartet
Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on
On and on, sextet, septet, octet
How long do you think  can sustain that
have no idea
Guess
Guess, Majesty
Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it
Well, six or seven minutes
maybe eight
Twenty, sire
How about twenty
Twenty minutes of continuous music
No recitatives
Mozart - (ignoring him) Sire, only opera can do this
In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise
No one can understand a word
But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony
Isn't that marvelous
Mozart, music is not the issue here
No one doubts your talent
It is your judgment of literature that's in question
Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish
Surely you can choose more elevated themes
Elevated
What does that mean
Elevated
The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me
'm sorry
'm stupid
But  am fed up to the teeth with elevated things
Old dead legends
How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends
(aroused) Because they do
They go on forever - at least what they represent
The eternal in us, not the ephemeral
Opera is here to ennoble us
You and me, just as much as His Majesty
Bello
Bello, Barone
Veramente
Oh, bello, bello, bello
Come on now, be honest
Wouldn't you all rather listen to your hairdressers than Hercules
Or Horatius
Or Orpheus
All those old bores
people so lofty they sound as if they shit marble
What
Govern your tongue, sir
How dare you
Beat
All look at the Emperor
Forgive me, Majesty
'm a vulgar man
But  assure you, my music is not
You are passionate, Mozart
But you do not persuade
Sire, the whole opera is finished
Do you know how much work went into it
His Majesty has been more than patient, Signore
How can  persuade you if you won't let me show it
- That will do, Herr Mozart
Just let me tell you how it begins
Herr Mozart - May  just do that, Majesty
Show you how it begins
Just that
slight pause
Then Joseph nods
Please
Mozart falls on his knees
Look
There's a servant, down on his knees
Do you know why
Not from any oppression
No, he's simply measuring a space
Do you know what for
His bed
His wedding bed to see if it will fit
He giggles
: -  - 1780' Mozart sits on stage at a harpsichord rehearsing the singers taking the parts of Figaro and Susanna in the opening bars of the first act of The Marriage of Figaro
We watch Figaro measuring the space for his bed on the floor, singing and Susanna looking on, trying on the Countess' hat
: '  -  - 1780' Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno are sitting with Salieri
- Well, Mozart is already rehearsing
Incredible
- The Emperor has given him permission
Si, si
Veramente
Well, gentlemen, so be it
In that case  think we should help Mozart all we can and do our best to protect him against the Emperor's anger
- What anger
About the ballet
- Ballet
What ballet
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera
- Yes, absolutely
Is there a ballet in Figaro
Yes, in the third act
: -  - 1780' It is a full orchestral rehearsal
Mozart is conducting from the harpsichord with his hands; he does not use a baton
The singers are all in practice clothes, not costumes
We are in the Act  and we hear the recitativo exchange just before the march begins
Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno sit watching chairs
Suddenly the march starts
Peasants and friends start to dance in and at the same moment, Orsini-Rosenberg gets up and comes down to Mozart
He is accompanied by an anxious Bonno
- Mozart
Herr Mozart, may  have a word with you please
Right away
Certainly, Herr Director
He signals to the cast to break off
Five minutes, please
The company disperses, curious
The musicians look at Orsini- Rosenberg
- Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas
Yes, but this is not a ballet
This is a dance at Figaro's wedding
- Exactly
dance
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story
- It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts
Give me your score, please
Mozart hands him the score from which he is conducting
- Thank you
He rips out a page
Bonno watches in terror
What are you doing
He rips out three more
What are you doing, Herr Director
- Taking out what you should never have put in
He goes on tearing the pages determinedly
: '  -  - 1780' servant opens the door to announce
Herr Mozart
Mozart brushes past him straight towards Salieri, who rises to greet him
The little man is near hysterics
Please
Please
've no one else to turn to
Please
He grabs Salieri
Wolfgang, what is it
Sta calmo, per favore
What's the matter
It's unbelievable
The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music
Pages of it
Really
Why
don't know
They say 've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is
can't rewrite what's perfect
Can't you talk to him
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg
He's obviously no friend of yours
Oh,  could kill him
mean really kill him
actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry
You burned the score
Oh no
My wife took it out in time
How fortunate
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work
But there are those who have power over him
think 'll take this up with the Emperor
Oh, Excellency, would you
With all my heart, Mozart
Thank you
Oh, thank you
He kisses Salieri's hand
(withdrawing it; imitating the Emperor) No, no, no, Herr Mozart, please
It's not a holy relic
Mozart giggles with relief and gratitude
'   -  - 1823 'm sure  don't need to tell you said nothing whatever to the Emperor
went to the theatre ready to tell Mozart that His Majesty had flown into a rage when  mentioned the ballet, when suddenly, to my astonishment, in the middle of the third act, the Emperor - who never attended rehearsals - suddenly appeared
-  - 1780' In the background the same recitativo before the March
The Emperor steals in surreptitiously with Von Strack, his finger to his lips
He motions everyone not to rise, and slips into a chair behind Salieri, Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno
The three conspirators look at each other wide-eyed
The recitativo summons up the march, but instead there is silence
Mozart lays down his baton
The musicians lay down their instruments
The celebrants of Figaro's wedding come in with a few pitiful dance steps, in procession, only to come presently to a halt, lacking their music
The singers try to go on singing, but they have no cues from their conductor or from the accompaniment
Everyone on stage looks lost, though they attempt to go on with the story for a while
Consternation grows on the faces of the conspirators
Mozart glances back at the group seated in the theatre
Finally, the Emperor speaks, in a whisper
What is this
don't understand
Is it modern
Majesty, the Herr Director, he has removed a balleto that would have occurred at this place
Why
- It is your regulation, Sire
No ballet in your opera
Mozart strains to hear what they are saying but cannot
Do you like this, Salieri
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty
Your own law decrees it, 'm afraid
Well, look at them
We do look at them
The spectacle on stage has now ground to a complete halt
No, no, no
This is nonsense
Let me hear the scene with the music
- But, Sire - Oblige me
Orsini-Rosenberg acknowledges his defeat
- Yes, Majesty
Orsini-Rosenberg rises and goes down to where Mozart sits anxiously with the musicians, watching his approach
- Can we see the scene with the music back, please
Oh yes, certainly
Certainly, Herr Director
He looks back deliriously at Salieri, trying to indicate his gratitude
Salieri acknowledges with a slight and subtle nod
Orsini-Rosenberg returns to his king
Ladies and gentlemen, we're going from where we stopped
The Count: Anches so
Right away, please
The singers scatter offstage to begin the scene again
(to Orsini-Rosenberg) What  hoped by that edict, Director, was simply to prevent hours of dancing like in French opera
There it is endless, as you know
- Quite so, Majesty
Mozart at the forte-piano, raising his hands
The musicians raise their bows
With a flourish the happy composer begins a reprise of the scene which had been cut out
The music of the march begins faintly; the celebrants of Figaro's wedding start to enter as the Count and the Countess sit in their chairs
In the theatre we see increasing pleasure on the Emperor's face, sullenness and defeat on the courtiers'
Then, suddenly, without interruption, on a crescendo repeat of the march, we : -  - 1780' The theatre is brilliantly lit for the first public performance of Figaro
Everybody is there: the Emperor, Von Strack, Bonno Orsini-Rosenberg, Von Swieten, even Madame Weber and her daughters in a box
The musicians all wear imperial livery; the actors on stage are now in costume
Mozart, conducting, wears his Order of the Golden Spur
The company wheels in and around to the music of the restored march, which reaches a triumphant climax
: '   -  - 1823 (to Vogler) So Figaro was produced in spite of me
And in spite of me, a wonder was revealed
One of the true wonders of art
The restored third act was bold and brilliant
The fourth was a miracle
The descending scale of strings in the final ensemble (Ah, Tutti contenti
Saremo cosi) fades in
-  - 1780' We see the tableau on stage with the Count kneeling to the Countess
All are singing
(
) saw a woman disguised in her maid's clothes hear her husband speak the first tender words he has offered her in years, only because he thinks she is someone else
heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theatre, conferring on all who sat there a perfect absolution
God was singing through this little man to all the world - unstoppable - making my defeat more bitter with each passing bar
, Salieri in his box, tears on his cheeks
He watches the ensemble and we listen to it for a long moment
Finally it fades, but continues underneath the following: '   -  - 1823 And then suddenly - a miracle
: -  - 1780' The ensemble reaches its climax, and fades away to the very quiet, slow chords immediately preceding the boisterous final chord
Salieri becomes aware that some of the audience are asleep and many mare are apathetic
In the near silence we see the Emperor yawn behind his hand
Those nearby look at him
Orsini-Rosenberg smiles
: '   -  - 1823 Father, did you know what that meant
With that yawn  saw my defeat turn into a victory
And Mozart was lucky the Emperor only yawned once
Three yawns and the opera would fail the same night; two yawns, within a week at most
With one yawn the composer could still get - : '  -  - 1780' Mozart is pacing up and down
Salieri is listening sympathetically
Nine performances
Nine
That's all it's had - and withdrawn
know; it's outrageous
Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully
But what is it they don't like
Well,  can speak for the Emperor
You made too many demands on the royal ear
The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four
What did you think of it yourself
Did you like it at all
think it's marvelous
Truly
It's the best opera yet written know it
Why didn't they come
think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend
Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap
know,  know
Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that
(fuming) wouldn't presume
All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing,  would like you to see my new piece
It would be a tremendous honour for me
Oh no, the honour would be all mine
(bowing) Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang
Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio
He bows too, giggling
: -  - 1780' performance of Salieri's grand opera, Axur: King of Ormus
Deafening applause from a crowded house
We see the reception of the aria which we saw Cavalieri singing on the stage near the start of the film
Cavalieri, in a mythological Persian costume, is bowing to the rapturous throng; below her is Salieri
We see the Emperor, Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno and Von Swieten, all applauding
We hear great cries of 'Salieri
Salieri
' and 'Bravo
' and 'Brava
' , Salieri looking at the crowd with immense pleasure
Then suddenly at: , Mozart standing in a box and clapping wildly
Behind him, seated, are Schikaneder and the three girls we saw before in Mozart's apartment
, Salieri staring fixedly at Mozart, then Mozart still clapping, apparently with tremendous enthusiasm
(
) What was this
never saw him excited before by any music but his own
Could he mean it
'   -  - 1823 (to Vogler) Would he actually tell me my music had moved him
Was  really going to hear that from his own lips
found myself actually hurrying the tempo of the finale
: -  - 1780' Salieri conducting the last scene from Axur: King of Ormus
On stage we see a big scene of acclamation: the hero and heroine of the opera accepting the crown amidst the rejoicing of the people
The decor and costumes are mythological Persian
The music is utterly conventional and totally uninventive
, Mozart watching this in his box, with Schikaneder and the three actresses
He passes an open bottle of wine to them
He is evidently a little drunk, but keeps a poker face
The act comes to an end
Great applause in which Mozart joins in, standing and shouting 'Bravo
Bravo
' Then he leaves the box with Schikaneder and the girls
-  - 1780' (to Schikaneder) Well
(mock moved) Sublime
Utterly sublime
That kind of music should be punishable by death
Schikaneder laughs
: -  - 1780' crowd of people rings Salieri at a respectful distance
The Emperor is holding out the Civilian Medal and Chain
believe that is the best opera yet written, my friends
Salieri, you are the brightest star in the musical firmament
You do honour to Vienna and to me
Salieri bows his head
Joseph places the chain around his neck
The crowd claps
Salieri makes to kiss his hand, but Joseph restrains him, and passes on
Cavalieri, smiling adoringly, gives him a deep curtsey, and he raises her up
The crowd all flock to Salieri with cries and words of approval
All want to shake his hand
They tug and pat him
But he has eyes for only one man - he looks about him, searching for him and then finds him
Mozart stands there
Eagerly Salieri moves to him
Mozart
It was good of you to come
How could  not
Did my work please you
How could it not, Excellency
Yes
never knew that music like that was possible
You flatter me
Oh no
One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri
Salieri smiles
: '  -   -  - 1780' Explosive laughter as Mozart and Schikaneder enter the apartment, very pleased with themselves and accompanied by the three actresses
The front door opens, very gingerly
Mozart, still rather drunk, sticks his head into the room, anxious not to make a noise
He sees the strangers and breaks into a smile
Oh
Everybody's here
We've got guests
Good
've brought some more
He opens the door wide to admit Schikaneder and the girls
We'll have a little party
Come in
Come in
You know Herr Schikaneder
(to a girl) This is
a very nice girl
(standing up) Wolfi
Yes, my love
These gentlemen are from Salzburg
Salzburg
We were just talking about Salzburg
(to the two men, jubilantly) If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment
Because 've got good news for him
'm done with Vienna
It's over, finished, done with
Done with
Done with
Wolfi
Your father is dead
What
Your father is dead
The first loud chord of the Statue scene from Don Giovanni sounds
Mozart stares
-  - 1780' The second chord sounds
On stage we see the huge figure of the Commendatore in robes and helmet, extending his arms and pointing in accusation
-  - 1780' The second chord sounds
On stage we see a huge nailed fist crash through the wall of a painted dining room set
The giant armoured statue of the enters pointing his finger in accusation at Don Giovanni who sits at the supper table, staring - his servant Leporello quaking with fear under the table
(singing) Don Giovanni
The figure advances on the libertine
We see Mozart conducting, pale and deeply involved
Music fades down a little
(
) So rose the dreadful ghost in his next and blackest opera
There on the stage stood the figure of a dead commander calling out 'Repent
Repent
' The music swells
We see Salieri standing alone in the back of a box, unseen, in semi-darkness
We also see that the theatre is only half full
Music fades down
(
) And  knew - only  understood - that the horrifying apparition was Leopold, raised from the dead
Wolfgang had actually summoned up his own father to accuse his son before all the world
It was terrifying and wonderful to watch
Music swells up again
We watch the scene on stage as the Commendatore addresses Giovanni
Then back to Salieri in the box
Music down again
'   -  - 1823 Now a madness began in me
The madness of a man splitting in half
Through my influence  saw to it Don Giovanni was played only five times in Vienna
But in secret  went to every one of those five - all alone - unable to help myself, worshipping sound alone seemed to hear
-  - 1780' (
) And hour after hour, as  stood there, understanding even more clearly how that bitter old man was still possessing his poor son from beyond the grave,  began to see a way - a terrible way -  could finally triumph over God, my torturer
Music swells
On stage Don Giovanni is seized and gripped by the Statue's icy hand
Flames burst from obviously artificial rocks
Demons appear and drag the libertine down to Hell
The scene ends
, Salieri, staring wide-eyed
: '  -  -  - 1780' We see huge and attractive posters and billboards advertising Schikaneder's troupe
The camera concentrates on the one which reads as follows: Impresario de luxe The Celebrated An Evening of Music
Mirth
Magic
who personally will appear in every scene
: '  -  - 1780' Noise; smoke; the audience is sitting at tables for an evening of vaudeville
Mozart, Constanze and their son Karl, now about two years old, and sitting on his mother's lap, are watching a parody scene by Schikaneder's troupe
They are rowdy, bawdy and silly, incorporating motifs, situations and tunes from Mozart's operas which we have seen and heard
Before them on the table are bottles of wine and beer, plates of sausages, etc
On stage we see a set which parodies the dining room in Don Giovanni's palace, shown before
Schikaneder as Don Giovanni is dancing with the three actresses to the minuet from Don Giovanni (end of Act ), played by a quartet of tipsy musicians
Leporello is handing around wine on a tray
Suddenly there is a tremendous knocking from outside
The music slithers to a stop
All look at each other in panic
Leporello drops his tray with a crash
All go quiet
One more knock is heard
Then all musicians, actresses, Don Giovanni and Leporello make a dash to hide under the table which is far too small to accommodate them all
The table rocks
Schikaneder is pushed out
He is terrified
He shakes elaborately
Three more knocks are heard; louder
Who is it
One more knock
-c-c-come in
In the pit a chromatic scale from the Overture to Don Giovanni turns into a anticipatory vamp
This grows more and more menacing until the whole flat representing the wall at the back falls down
An absurd pantomime horse gallops in
It has a ridiculous expression, and is manned by four men inside
Standing precariously on its back is a dwarf, wearing a miniature version of the armour and helmet worn by the Commendatore
He sings in a high, nasal voice: (singing) Don Giovannnnnnnnnni
He tries to keep his balance as he trots in, but fails
He falls off onto the stage
He beats at the horse, trying to get back on
Down
Down
Bewildered, the horse looks about him, but cannot see his small rider who is below his level of sight
'm here
'm here
The horse, amidst laughter from the audience, fails to locate him
Exasperated, the dwarf signals to someone in the wings
tall man strides out carrying a see-saw; on his shoulders stands another man
The dwarf stands on the lowered end of the see-saw
There is a drum roll and the man above jumps down onto the raised end and the Commendatore is abruptly catapulted back onto the horse, only backwards so that he is facing away from Don Giovanni
The two men bow to the applauding audience, and retire off-stage
The Commendatore tries to extend his arms in the proper menacing attitude, and at the same time turn around to face Don Giovanni
This he finds difficult
(singing) Don Giovannnnnnnni
Who the devil are you
What do you want
(singing) 've come to dinnnnnner
Dinner
How dare you
am a nobleman
only dine with people of my own height
Are you drunk
You invited me
And my horse
Here he is
Ottavio
The horse takes a bow
The dwarf almost falls off again
Whoa
Whoa
Stop it
The three girls rush to his aid and reach him just in time
They sing in the manner of the Tree Ladies later to be put into The Magic Flute
(running and singing) Be careful
(running and singing) Be careful
(running and singing) Be careful
(close harmony) Hold tight now
They grab him
(angry) Leave me alone
Stop it
'm a famous horseman
And 'm a famous horse
He gives the ladies a radiant smile
The three ladies sing, as before, in close harmony
(singing) He's adorable
(singing) Adorable
(singing) Adorable
An orchestral chord
The three ladies turn to Ottavio and sing to him
(singing together) Give me your hoof, my darling, And 'll give you my heart
Take me to your stable, And never more we'll part
(singing: four male voices) 'm shy and very bashful
don't know what to say
(singing together) Don't hesitate a second
Just answer yes and neigh
Ottavio neighs loudly, and runs at the girls
(speaking) Stop it
What are you doing
Remember who you are
You're a horse and they are whores
Boos from the audience
(speaking) This is ridiculous
won't have any of it
You're turning my house into a circus
trapeze sails in from above
On it stands a grand soprano wearing an elaborate Turkish costume, like a parody of Cavalieri's in Il Seraglio
She comes in singing a mad coloratura scale in the manner of Martern aller Arten
(speaking) Shut up
Women, women, women
'm sick to death of them
He marches off stage
(singing dramatically) Dash me
Bash me
Lash me
Flay me
Slay me
At last  will be freed by death
Shut up
(swinging and singing) Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
Kill me
At last  shall be freed by death
At last  shall be freed by dea - The Commendatore pulls out his sword, reaches up and thrusts her through with it
The soprano collapses on the bar of the trapeze
The audience applauds
At the same moment eight dwarves march in bearing a huge cauldron of steaming water
They sing as they march to the sound of the march that was cut from Act  of Figaro
They are dressed as miniature copies of the chorus in that scene except that they are wearing cooks' hats
(singing) We're going to make a soprano stew
We're going to make a soprano stew
And when you make a soprano stew
Any stupid soprano will do
Any stew- stew-stew-stew-stew
Any stewpid soprano will do
They set the giant pot down in the middle of the stage
The trapeze with the dead soprano is still swinging above the stage
We hear the chromatic scale from the Don Giovanni overture again, repeated and repeated, only now fast and tremolando
To this exciting vamp Schikaneder suddenly rides in on a real horse, waving a real sword
With this he cuts the string of the trapeze, and the soprano falls into the pot tremendous splash of water
Schikaneder rides out
More applause
All the dwarves produce long wooden cooking spoons and climb up the sides of the pot
The three girls produce labeled bottles from under their skirts
The first is
(singing) Behold
(singing) Behold
She sneezes
(singing) Behold
She hiccups
They throw them into the pot
(speaking to the dwarves) How long does it take to cook a soprano
(all together) Five hours, five minutes, five seconds
(speaking) can't wait that long
'm starving
(speaking; four voices) So am
Schikaneder marches in as Figaro
(singing to the tune of Non piu ante) In the pot,  have got a good dinner
Not a sausage or stew, but a singer
Not a sausage or stew but a singer
Is the treat that 'll eat for my meat
Oh shut up
'm sick to death of that tune
,  Mozart laughing delightedly with the audience
(singing again to the horse) Give me your hoof, my darling, and 'll give you my heart
Shut up
'm sick of that one too
All the dwarves climb up the rim of the pot
As they climb, they all hum together the opening of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik
And that one, too
The soprano rises, dripping with water in the middle of the pot
(singing) Oil me
Broil me
Boil me
All the dwarves beat her back down into the pot with their long wooden spoons
(from inside the pot) Soil me
Foil me
Spoil me
can't eat her
Sopranos give me hiccups
want some hay
(singing to Schikaneder) Hey
(singing to Schikaneder) Hey
(singing to Schikaneder) Hey
Hey what
(singing to La oi daram) Give him some hay, my darling, and 'll give you my heart
Shut up
Leporello
We want some hay - prestissimo
Leporello - where are you
The table is raised in the air by Leporello sitting under it on a bale of hay
(singing to horse) Behold
(singing to horse) Behold
(singing to horse) Behold
Ottavio the horse gives a piercing neigh and runs down to the hay
(holding on) Hey
Hey
Watch out
The vamp starts again vigorously
The horse's rear-end swings around on a hinge to turn his hind-quarters straight on to the audience
The rest of him stays sideways
His tail springs up in the air to reveal a lace handkerchief modestly hiding his arsehole
Schikaneder offers him a handful of hay
The horse eats it, and out the other end comes a long Viennese sausage
The audience roars with laughter
Another handful of hay and out of the other end falls a string of sausages
Then a large pie, crust and all
Then a shower of iced cakes
Suddenly - silence
Schikaneder produces an egg from his pocket
Ottavio the horse rears up in disgust
Whoa
Whoa, Ottavio
Whoa
Leporello pries open the horse's mouth
Schikaneder pops the egg into it
breathless pause as a drum roll builds the tension, up and up and up, and then suddenly out of the horse's rear-end flies a single white dove
Wild applause
It flies into the audience
Immediately all the cast start humming the lyrical finale from Figaro: Tutti Contenti
More and more doves fly out from the wings and fill the theatre
Everybody picks up the sausages and cakes and begins to eat
The end of the sketch is unexpectedly lyrical and magical, and then, suddenly, the tempo changes and the coarse strains of Ich Mochte wohl Der Kaiser take over and the whole company is dancing, frantically
general dance as the curtain falls
It rises immediately
The audience - including Mozart - is delighted
They applaud vigorously
Schikaneder takes a bow amongst his troupe
Among much whistling and clapping, he finally jumps off the stage and strides through the audience toward the table where Mozart sits with his family
On stage, a troupe of bag pipers immediately appears to play an old German tune
Some of the audience joins in singing it
Well, how do you like that
Mozart is smiling; he has been amused
Constanze has been less amused and is looking apprehensive
Wonderful
(indicating his baby son) He liked the monkey, didn't you
Yes, well, it's all good fun
liked the horse
Schikaneder sits at the table, and drinks from a bottle of wine
Isn't he marvelous
He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it
tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success
'm not joking
These people aren't fools
You could do something marvelous for them
'd like to try them someday
'm not sure 'd be much good at it
'Course you would
You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court
You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better
That's what people want, you know: fantasy
You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want
Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because 've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood -  can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life
Oh, and a few trick animals
You'd have to use those
Animals
tell you  picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan
It's a miracle
Mozart laughs
'm serious
You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, 'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe
Mind you, it'll have to be in German
German
Of course
What else do you think they speak here
No, no,  love that
'd want it to be in German
haven't done anything in German since Seraglio
So there you are
What do you say
How much will you pay him
Ah
Well
Ah, (to Mozart) see you've got your manager with you
Well, Madame, how about half the receipts
Half the receipts
Stanzi
'm talking about now
How much will you give him now
Down payment
Down payment
Who do you think  am
The Emperor
Whoops,  have to go
He rises in haste for his next number
Stay where you are
You're going to like this next one
We'll speak again
Triumph-de-luxe, my boy
He winks at Mozart and disappears toward the stage
Mozart looks after him, enchanted
You're not going to do this
Why not
Half the house
When
We need money now
Either he pays now, or you don't do it
Oh, Stanzi
don't trust this man
And  didn't like what he did with your opera
It was common
(to Karl) Well, you liked it, didn't you
Monkey-flunki-punki
Half the house
You'll never see a penny
want it here, in my hand
(dirty) Stanzi-manzi, 'll put it in your hand
Shut up
'll not let you put anything in my hand until  see some money
He giggles like a child
: -  -  1780' Dogs are barking wickedly
Michael Schlumberg comes in from his salon
Mozart stands there looking very unwell and bewildered
He is also drunk, but making a careful attempt to keep his composure
Herr Mozart
What a surprise
What can  do for you
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man
Really
Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction
What is this, Mozart
What's the matter with you
Well
Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead
What for
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it
No doubt, sir
But  am endowed with talent, and you with money
If offer mine, you should offer yours
Pause
'm sorry
No
Please
'll give it back,  promise
Please, sir
My answer is no, Mozart
, Mozart
His voice becomes mechanical
Please
Please
Please
Please
Please
Please
: -  - 1790' Von Swieten and Salieri stand close together
Several scholars and students are examining scrolls and manuscripts at the other end of the room
(keeping his voice down) This is embarrassing, you know
You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them
It has to stop
agree, Baron
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him
've done my best
got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts
He got a fee - what  could afford
Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him
No, Baron, no
'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause
He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna
He is constantly drunk
He never pays his debts
can't think of one person to whom  dare recommend him
How sad
It's tragic, isn't it
Such a talent
Indeed
Just a moment - as a matter of fact  think  do know someone who could commission a work from him
very appropriate person to do so
Yes
The opening measures of the Piano Concerto in  Minor steal in
: -  -  - 1790' This is exactly the same shop which Mozart and Constanze visited with Leopold
Now Salieri's servant stands in it, waiting
We see a few other customers being served by the staff: renting masks, costumes, etc
One of the staff emerges from the back of the shop carrying a large box, which he hands to Salieri's servant
The servant leaves the shop
Through the window we see him hurrying away through the snowy street full of passers-by, carriages, etc
'  -  - 1790' The  Minor Concerto continues
Salieri, alone, eagerly opens the box from the costume shop and takes out the same dark cloak and hat that Leopold wore to the masquerade, only now attached to the hat is a dark mask whose mouth is cut into a frown, not a laugh
It presents a bitter and menacing expression
He puts on the cloak, the hat and the mask and turns his back
Suddenly we see the assembled and alarming image reflected in a full-length mirror
The music swells darkly
: -  - 1790' As the tutti of the  Minor Concerto continues, we see Salieri, dressed in this menacing costume, dark against the snow, stalking through a street which is otherwise lively with people going to various festivities
Some of them wear frivolous carnival clothes
'   -  - 1790' Mozart sits writing at a table
He appears now to be really quite sick
His face expresses pain from his stomach cramps
There is a gentle knock at the door
He rises, goes to he door and opens it
Immediately there is a  : The dark, frowning mask stares at him and at us
The violent Minor chord which opens Don Giovanni is heard
Salieri in costume stands in the doorway
Herr Mozart
The second chord sounds and fades
Mozart stares in panic
have come to commission work from you
What work
Mass for the dead
What dead
Who is dead
man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one
Who are you
am only a messenger
Do you accept
You will be paid well
How much
Salieri extends his hand
In it is a bag of money
Fifty ducats
Another fifty when have the Mass
Do you accept
Almost against his will, Mozart takes the money
How long will you give me
Work fast
And be sure to tell no one what you do
You will see me again soon
He turns away
Mozart closes the front door
Instantly we hear the opening of the Requiem Mass (also in  Minor)
Mozart turns and looks up at the portrait of his father on the wall
The portrait stares back
Constanze opens the door from the bedroom
She sees him staring up
Wolfi
Wolfi
He looks at her with startled eyes
The music breaks off
Who was that
No one
heard voices
He gives a strange little giggle
What's the matter
She sees the bag of money
What's that
Oh
(pouncing on it) Who gave you this
How much is it
Wolfi, who gave you this
'm not telling you
Why not
You'd think  was mad
He stares at her
She stares at him
'   -  - 1823 Old Salieri is now wildly animated, totally driven by his confession to Vogler
My plan was so simple, it terrified me
First  must get the Death Mass and then achieve the death
Vogler stares at him in horror
What
His funeral - imagine it
The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there
His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle
And suddenly in that silence, music
divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri
What sublimity
What depth
What passion in the music
Salieri has been touched by God at last
And God, forced to listen
Powerless - powerless to stop it at the end, for once, laughing at Him
Do you understand
Do you
Yes
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing
How does one do that
How does one kill a man
It's one thing to dream about it
It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands
He raises his own hands and stares at them
The raging Dies Irae from Mozart's Requiem Mass bursts upon us
: '  -   -  - 1790' Mozart sits working frantically at this demonic music
His whole expression is one of wildness and engulfing fever
He pours wine down his throat, spilling it, and grimaces as it hits his stomach
All around him are manuscripts
There is a banging at the front door
Mozart does not hear it; the music raves on
Another knocking comes, louder
Constanze appears from the bedroom and stares at her distracted husband
The knocking is repeated again, even more violently and insistently
Wolfi
Wolfi
He looks at her
The music breaks off
Silence
An enormous bang at the door startles him
Constanze moves to open it
No
Don't answer it
Why
Mozart springs up
He is clearly terrified
Tell him 'm not here
Tell him 'm working on it
Come back later
He runs out of he room, into his workroom, and shuts he door
Now a little scared herself, Constanze goes to he front door and opens it cautiously
Schikaneder stands there, floridly dressed as usual
Lorl is seen peeking out from the kitchen
Am  interrupting something
Not at all
(peering into he room) Where's our friend
He's not in
But he's working on it
He said to tell you
hope so
need it immediately
He pushes her into the room
Is he happy with it
He sees he manuscript on the table, and goes to it eagerly
Is this it
He picks up a page without waiting for a reply
What the devil is this
Requiem Mass
Does he think 'm in the funeral business
Mozart opens he workroom door
We see him as Schikaneder sees him: wild-eyed, extremely pale and strange
Leave that alone
Wolfi
Put it down
What is this
Put it down,  said
It's nothing for you
Oh
'm sorry
'm sorry
What have you got for me
Is it finished
What
What
The vaudeville, what'd you think
Yes
Can  see it
No
Why not
Because there's nothing to see
He giggles triumphantly
Schikaneder stares at him
Look,  asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes
Well, we can
So let me see it
Where is it
Mozart, with a bright, rather demented smile presents his head to Schikaneder
Here
It's all right here, in my noodle
The rest is just scribbling
Scribbling and bibbling
Bibbling and scribbling
Would you like a drink
He giggles
Schikaneder suddenly grabs his lapels
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people 've hired for you
Do you know how many people are waiting
Leave him alone
'm paying these people
Do you realize that
He's doing his best
'm paying people just to wait for you
It's ridiculous
You know what's ridiculous
Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous
Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff
Oh yes
And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem
Money
Money
You're mad
She's mad, Wolfi
Oh yes, and who are you
He's worked for Kings
For the Emperor
(shouting) Who are you
Schikaneder suddenly takes Mozart by the arms, and speaks to him with intense appeal
Listen, Wolfi
Write it
Please
Just write it down
On paper
It's no good to anyone in your head
And fuck the Death Mass
'  -  - 1790' frightened and tearful Lorl sits before Salieri
Now calm yourself
Calm
What's the matter with you
'm leaving
'm not working there anymore
'm scared
Why
What has happened
You don't know what it's like
Herr Mozart frightens me
He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse
What medicine
don't know
He has pains
Where
Here, in his stomach
They bend him right over
Is he working
'm frightened, sir
Really
When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense
You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father
And his father's dead
Is he working
suppose so
He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera
(startled) Opera
Opera
Please don't ask me to go back again
'm frightened
'm very, very frightened
(insistently) Are you sure it's an opera
The Overture to The Magic Flute begins grandly
To the music of the slow introduction, we see: '  -   -  - 1790' The room, lit by a few candles, appears dirty
The camera shows us again Leopold's portrait on the wall, looking down upon a scene of disorder
Papers litter the table; dirty dishes are piled in the fireplace; on the forte-piano lies Mozart's Masonic apron, woven with symbols
To the more lyrical passage of the introduction, we see Mozart take up a candle and enter: '  -  -  - 1790' We watch him stand beside Constanze, who lies asleep
Mozart now looks very ill; his wife appears worn out
Tenderly he touches her hair
Then he moves to the cot where his son Karl lies asleep and kneels, pulls up the child's little blanket and for a moment lays his own head down beside the boy's
Constanze opens her eyes and stares at him
Mozart rises and returns to: '  -   -  - 1790' The Introduction ends and suddenly the brilliant fast fugue begins
Instantly Mozart starts to dance to it, all alone: gleefully, like a child
He looks up at his father's portrait, and makes a silly, rude gesture at it
He is, briefly, an irresponsible and happy boy again
Then suddenly there is a gentle knocking at the door
The music fades down
Warily, Mozart crosses and opens he door
The familiar dark chords from Don Giovanni cut across the happy music
It ends
Before him stands the masked stranger
don't have it yet
It's not finished
'm sorry, but  need more time
Are you neglecting my request
No, no
promise you, 'll give you a wonderful piece - the best  ever can
He turns and looks
Constanze has come into the living room
Nervously, Mozart indicates her
This is my wife, Stanzi
've been sick, but 'm all right now
Aren't Oh yes, sir
He's all right
And he's working on it very hard
Give me two more weeks
Please
Salieri contemplates them both
The sooner you finish, the better your reward
Work
He turns and goes down the stairs
Mozart shuts the door; he closes his eyes in fear
Wolfi,  think you really are going mad
You work like a slave for that idiot actor who won't give you a penny and here
This is not a ghost
This is a real man who puts down real money
Why on earth don't you finish it
He will not look at her or reply
Give me one reason  can understand
can't write it
Why not
It's killing me
He looks at her suddenly
No, this is really awful
You're drunk, aren't you
Be honest - tell me - you've been drinking
And 'm so stupid  stay here and listen to you
Suddenly she starts to cry
It's not fair
worry about you all the time
try to help you all can and you just drink and talk nonsense and - and frighten me
It's not fair
Her tears flow
Mozart looks at her helplessly
Go back to bed
Please
Let me sit here
Let me stay here with you
promise  won't say all word
'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you
Please, please
She sits down tearfully, staring at him
We hear the Rex Tremendai Majestatis from the Requiem and see on the wall the portrait of Leopold Mozart looking down
The camera pans slowly downward from it back to the table
Mozart is writing the music
He looks up and sees that Constanze is fast asleep in her chair
Mozart gets up quietly
He puts on his hat and cloak, takes a bottle of wine and tiptoes from the house
Without stopping, the music changes from the heavy Requiem to the light-hearted patter of the Papa-Papa duet from The Magic Flute
: '   -  - 1790' This little wooden structure stands in a courtyard in the tenement by the Weiden
Inside, we see a table, chairs, a forte-piano, bottles and a chaos of papers
Strewn about in the chairs are the three actresses, giggling
Schikaneder and Mozart, both drunk, are singing the duet of the two bird- people
The actor sings Papageno and the composer, in a soprano voice, sings Papagena at the keyboard
Absurdly, they end up rubbing noses and fall on each other's necks
-  - 1790' Mozart, drunk and happy, staggers back through the snow
There are a few people about
He goes into his apartment building
'  -  - 1790' He comes through he door and stares across the living room at an open bedroom door
Puzzled, he crosses
The bedroom is also empty
We see Constanze's empty bed; Karl's empty bed; empty closets
Stanzi
Stanzi-marini-bini
He looks about him, puzzled
'  -   -  - 1790' Frau Weber sits grimly talking
Mozart sits also, completely exhausted and passive under the rain of her constant speech
She's not coming back, you know
She's gone for good
did it and 'm proud of it
'Leave,'  said
'Right away
Take he child and go, just go
Here's the money
Go to the Spa and get your health back - that's if you can
'  was shocked
Shocked to my foundation
Is that my girl
Can that be my Stanzi
The happy little moppet  brought up, that poor trembling thing
Oh, you monster
No one exists but you, do they
You and your music
Do you know how often she's sat in that very chair, weeping her eyes out of her head because of you
warned her
'Choose a man, not a baby,'  said
But would she listen
Who listens
'He's just a silly boy,' she says
Silly, my arse
Selfish - that's all you are
Selfish
Selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish
And with a scream Madame Weber's voice turns into the shrill packing coloratura of the second act aria of the Queen of the Night, in The Magic Flute
: '  -  - 1790' On stage we see the     fantastically costumed, furiously urging her daughter to kill Sarastro
As she sings, we see the interior of the theatre, now re-arranged from when we last visited it to watch the Cabaret
An audience of ordinary German citizens stands in the pit area, or sits: they are rapt and excited
The theatre also possesses boxes; some of these show closed curtains - their inhabitants presumably engaged in private intimacies
In one of them sits Salieri
(singing furiously) hellish wrath within my heart is seething
Death and destruction Flame around my throne
If not by thee Sarastro's light be extinguished
Then be thou mine own daughter never more
Rejected be forever
So sundered be forever All the bonds of kin and blood
Hear
Hear
Hear God of Vengeance
Hear thy Mother's vow
Thunder and lightning
She disappears amidst tremendous applause from the audience
: -  - 1790' On the poster for The Magic Flute, the name Emmanuel Schikaneder should appear very, very large and the name of Mozart quite small: &
priv
Weiden Theatre The Actors of the Imperial and Royal Privileged Theatre of the Weiden Have the honour to perform Grand Opera in Two Acts By Emmanuel Schikaneder (The Cast List) The music is by Herr Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
Herr Mozart out of respect for a gracious and honourable Public, and from friendship for the author of this piece, will today direct the orchestra in person
The book of the opera, furnished with two copperplates, of which is engraved Herr Schikaneder in the costume he wears for the role of Papageno, may be had at the box office for 30 kr
Prices of admission are as usual To begin at 7 o'clock ,     '  - -1790' We   the scene immediately before Papageno's song, Ein Madchen oder Weibchen
Papageno, played by Schikaneder, dressed in his costume of feathers, is trying to get through a mysterious door
voice calls from within
Go back
Papageno recoils
Merciful Gods
If only  knew by which door  came in
(to audience) Which was it
Was it this one
Come on, tell me
Go back
Papageno recoils
Now,  can't go forward and  can't go back
Oh, this is awful
He weeps extravagantly
In the pit, Mozart indicates to the first violinist to take over as conductor
He slips from his place and goes stealthily backstage
We follow him
Over the scene we hear Papageno being addressed by the First Priest in stern tones
(on stage) Man, thou hast deserved to wander forever in the darkest chasms of the earth
The gentle Gods have remitted thy punishment, but yet thou shalt never feel the Divine Content of the consecrated ones
Oh well, 'm not alone in that
Just give me a decent glass of wine - that's divine content enough for me
Laughter
An enormous goblet of wine appears out of the earth
We follow Mozart into the wings
Actors and actresses stand around in fantastic costumes
We see a flying chariot and parts of a huge snake lying about
Also the scenery door of a temple with the word 'Wisdom' inscribed on the pediment
Mozart walks to where there stands a keyboard glockenspiel with several manuals, and a musician waiting to play it
Silently Mozart indicates that he wishes to play the instrument himself
On stage Schikaneder is being addressed haughtily by the First Priest
Man, hast thou no other desire on earth, but just to eat and drink
(Schikaneder) Well
Laughter from the audience
Well, actually  do have a rather weird feeling in my heart
Perhaps it's just indigestion
But you know, really would like -  really do want - something even nicer than food and drink
Now what on earth could that be
He stares at the audience and winks at them
They laugh
Now Papageno's aria (Ein Madchen oder Weibchen) begins
It is interpolated, as he pretends to play his magic bells, with the glockenspiel actually being played off-stage by Mozart
Schikaneder looks into the pit and does not see Mozart conducting
He looks into the wings and realizes the situation with amusement
He sings joyfully and the audience watches entranced
sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish
willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish
Be my most tasty little dish
Be my most tasty little dish
Then that would be eating and drinking 'd live like a Prince without thinking
The wisdom of old would be mine -  woman's much better than wine
Then that would be eating and drinking
The wisdom of old would be mine -  woman's much better than wine
She's much better than wine
She's much better than wine
(encore, lightly, as before) sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish
willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish
need to net one birdie only And will stop feeling so lonely
But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost  must fade
need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost  must fade
To a ghost  must fade
To a ghost  must fade
(encore) sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish
willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish
At present the girls only peck me
Their cruelty surely will wreck me
But one little beak in my own, And 'll up to heaven be flown
At present the girls only peck me
But one little beak in my own, And 'll up to heaven be flown
Up to heaven be flown
Up to heaven be flown
At certain moments we see the stage from Salieri's point of view: Schikaneder singing, then pretending to play; and then we see Mozart playing the glockenspiel with great flourishes in the wings
Then, suddenly, the actor mimes playing, and no sound comes
He mimes again, but still nothing comes
He looks offstage in anxiety; there is evidently some commotion
People are looking down on the floor
The song comes to a near-halt
Schikaneder stares
Then the comedian signals to the deputy conductor to pick up the song and finish it
At this moment Salieri gets up and hastily leaves his box
: '  -  - 1790' We see the actress playing Papagena, wearing an old tattered cloak and about to tie a little painted cloth representing a hideous old woman over her face
She is looking worriedly down at Mozart, who is lying unconscious on the floor
few people around him are trying to revive him
One has put a wet handkerchief around his temples
Another is holding a small bottle of smelling salts
There are voices saying, 'Doctor
Take him to a dressing room
Someone call a carriage
Take him home
' Etc
Papagena is urged to go on stage by a distracted stage manager
Suddenly we hear the voice of Salieri
'll take care of him
He steps forward
have a carriage
Excuse me
The actors step back respectfully
He stoops and picks up the frail composer in his arms
Mozart is quite limp and Salieri has to fling his arms around his own neck
All this is watched nervously by Schikaneder on stage whilst performing his scene with Papagena as an ugly old woman
Here  am, my angel
(appalled) What
Who the devil are you
've taken pity on you, my angel heard your wish
Oh
Well, thank you
How wonderful
Some people get all the luck
Audience laughter
The actress raises the little painted cloth with the ugly old face on it to show her own pretty young one to the audience
More laughter
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever
Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you
(nervous) can't wait
Well, promise then
What do you mean - now
Of course now
Right away, before get any older
Laughter
Well,  don't know
mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough
(amorously) Oh, 'm tender enough for you, my boy
'm tender enough for you
Laughter
'  -  - 1790' waiting sedan chair
Mozart has recovered consciousness, but looks exceedingly ill
Salieri has set him down in the winter's night
Snow is falling
What happened
Is it over
'm taking you home
You're not well
No, no
have to get back
have - He starts to collapse again
Salieri helps him into the sedan
The door is shut
The chair sets off and Salieri strides beside it, through the mean street
lantern with a candle swings from the chair
'  -   -  - 1790' The door opens
Salieri enters carrying the lantern from the sedan chair
He is followed by Mozart, carried in the arms of one of the porters
The room is now really in complete disarray
The table is piled high with music: the pages of the Requiem lie amongst many empty wine bottles
The porter carries Mozart into '  -  -  - 1790' This room is miserably neglected
The bed is unmade, clothes lie about on the floor
sock has been stuck into the broken pane of one window
The porter lays Mozart down on the bed as Salieri lights candles from the lantern to reveal plates of half-eaten food and other signs left by a man whose wife has departed
It is obviously very cold
Another very small bed nearby belongs to the child, Karl
(handing the porter the lantern) Thank you
Go
The porter leaves the room
Mozart stirs
(vaguely singing) Papa
Papa
He opens his eyes and sees Salieri staring down at him
He smiles
Come now
He helps him to sit up and takes off his coat and his shoes and puts a coverlet around him
Where is your wife
Not here
She's not well, either
She went to the Spa
You mean she's not coming back
You're so good to me
Truly
Thank you
No, please
mean to come to my opera
You are the only colleague who did
He struggles to loosen his cravat
Salieri does it for him
would never miss anything that you had written
You must know that
This is only a vaudeville
Oh no
It is a sublime piece
The grandest operone
tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me
Do you mean that
do
have bad fancies
don't sleep well anymore
Then  drink too much, and think stupid things
Are you ill
The doctor thinks  am
But - What
'm too young to be so sick
There is a violent knocking at the front door
Mozart starts and looks around wildly
Shall  answer it
No
No, it's him
Who
The man
He's here
What man
The knocking increases in loudness, terrifying Mozart
Tell him to go away
Tell him 'm still working on it
Don't let him in
Salieri moves to the door
Wait
Ask him if he'd give me some money now
Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it
Finish what
He knows
He knows
Salieri leaves the room
'  -   -  - 1790' Salieri goes to the front door and opens it to reveal Schikaneder, who has obviously come straight from the theatre
He still wears his bird make-up and under his street cloak, his feathered costume is clearly seen
He has with him the three actresses, also looking anxious and also in make-up as the three attendants in The Magic Flute
Herr Salieri
Yes,  am looking after him
Can we come in
Well, he's sleeping now
Better not
But he's all right
Oh, yes
He's just exhausted
He became dizzy, that's all
We should let him rest
Well, tell him we were here, won't you
Of course
And say everything went wonderfully
triumph-de-luxe - say that
Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times
Bene
'll call tomorrow
Yes
(to the actresses) And congratulations to all of you
It was superb
Thank you
Thank you, Excellency
Schikaneder produces a bag of money
Oh, by the way, give him this
This is his share
That should cheer him up, eh
Yes, indeed
Goodnight to you all now
It was perfection - truly
(delighted) Goodnight, Your Excellency
Goodnight
They bob and curtsey
Schikaneder stares at Salieri, uneasily, vaguely suspicious
Salieri smiles back at him and shuts the door
He stays for a moment, thinking
He contemplates the money
'  -  -  - 1790' Mozart is sitting up in bed, staring at the door
It opens
Salieri returns
He holds in his hand the bag of money
What happened
Salieri pours the coins out of the bag onto the coverlet
He said to give you this
And if you finish the work by tomorrow night, he will pay you another hundred ducats
Mozart looks at the coins astonished
Another
But that's too soon
Tomorrow night
It's impossible
Did he say a hundred
Yes
Can  - could  help you, in any way
Would you
Actually, you could
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul
'm not allowed
Of course
You know, it's all here in my head
It's just ready to be set down
But when 'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus
can't write
Then, let us try together
'd regard it as such an honour
Tell me, what is this work
Mass
Mass for the Dead
: -  -  - 1790' Trivial dance music is playing
Constanze is doing a waltz with a young  in military uniform
At the moment we see her, she stops abruptly, as if in panic
What is it
want to go
Where
want to go back to Vienna
Now
Yes
Why
feel wrong
feel wrong being here
(laying a hand on her arm) What are you talking about
: '  -  -  - 1790' Mozart is sitting up in bed, propped against pillows
The coins lie on the coverlet; many candles burn in the necks of bottles
Salieri, without coat or wig, is seated at an improvised worktable
On it are blank sheets of music paper, quills, and ink
Also the score of the Requiem Mass as so far composed
Mozart is bright-eyed with a kind of fever
Salieri is also possessed with an obviously feverish desire to put down the notes as quickly as Mozart can dictate them
Where did  stop
(consulting the manuscript) The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra
So now the Confutatis
Confutatis Maledictis
When the wicked are confounded
Flammis acribus addictis
How would you translate that
Consigned to flames of woe
Do you believe in it
What
fire which never dies
Burning one forever
Oh, yes
Strange
Come
Let's begin
He takes his pen
Confutatis Maledictis
We ended in  Major
Yes
So now -  minor
Suddenly
Salieri writes the key signature
The Fire
What time
Common time
Salieri writes this, and continues now to write as swiftly and urgently as he can, at Mozart's dictation
He is obviously highly expert at doing this and hardly hesitates
His speed, however, can never be too fast for Mozart's impatient mind
Start with the voices
Basses first
Second beat of the first measure - (singing the note) Con-fu-ta-tis
(speaking) Second measure, second beat
(singing) Ma-le-dic-tis
(speaking) -sharp, of course
Yes
Third measure, second beat starting on
(singing) Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis
(speaking) And fourth measure, fourth beat -
(singing) Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis
(speaking) Do you have that
think so
Sing it back
Salieri sings back the first six measures of the bass line
After the first two measures a chorus of basses fades in on the soundtrack and engulfs his voice
They stop
Good
Now the tenors
Fourth beat of the first measure -
(singing) Con-fu-ta-tis
(speaking) Second measure, fourth beat on
(singing) Ma-le-dic-tis
(speaking) All right
Yes
Fourth measure, second beat -
(singing) Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis
His voice is lost on the last words, as tenors engulf it and take over the soundtrack, singing their whole line from the beginning, right to the end of the sixth measure where the basses stopped, but he goes on mouthing the sounds with them
Salieri writes feverishly
We see his pen jotting down the notes as quickly as possible: the ink flicks onto the page
The music stops again
Now the orchestra
Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses
Identical notes and rhythm
(He hurriedly hums the opening notes of the bass vocal line) The first bassoon and tenor trombone - (labouring to keep up) Please
Just one moment
Mozart glares at him, irritated
His hands move impatiently
Salieri scribbles frantically
It couldn't be simpler
(finishing) First bassoon and tenor trombone - what
With the tenors
Also identical
Exactly
The instruments to go with the voices
Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant
He again hums the bass vocal line from the beginning, conducting
On the soundtrack, we hear the second bassoon and bass trombone play it with him and the first bassoon and tenor trombone come in on top, playing the tenor vocal line
We also hear the trumpets and timpani
The sound is bare and grim
It stops at the end of the sixth measure
Salieri stops writing
And that's all
Oh no
Now for the Fire
(he smiles) Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this
He sings the urgent first measure of the ostinato
(speaking) Second measure on
He sings the second measure of the ostinato
(speaking) Do you have me
think so
Show me
Salieri sings the first two measures of the string ostinato
(excitedly) Good, good - yes
Put it down
And the next measures exactly the same, rising and rising -  to  to , up to the dominant chord
Do you see
As Salieri writes, Mozart sings the ostinato from the beginning, but the unaccompanied strings overwhelm his voice on the soundtrack, playing the first six bars of their agitated accompaniment
They stop
That's wonderful
Yes, yes - go on
The Voca Me
Suddenly sotto voce
Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo
Voca me cum benedictis
Call me among the blessed
He is now sitting bolt upright, hushed and inspired
Major
Sopranos and altos in thirds
Altos on
Sopranos above
(singing the alto part) Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis
Sopranos up to  on the second 'Voca'
Yes, and on 'dictis'
Yes
He writes feverishly
And underneath, just violins - arpeggio
He sings the violin figure under the Voca Me (Bars 7,8,9)
(speaking) The descending scale in eighth notes, and then back suddenly to the fire again
He sings the ostinato phrase twice
(speaking) And that's it
Do you have it
You go fast
(urgently) Do you have it
Yes
Then let me hear it
All of it
The whole thing from the beginning - now
The entire Confutatis bursts over the room, as Mozart snatches the manuscript pages from Salieri and reads from it, singing
Salieri sits looking on in wondering astonishment
The music continues right through the following scenes, to the end of the movement
-   - 1790' carriage is driving fast through the night
Snow lies on the countryside
- 1790' The carriage is filled with passengers
Among them Constanze and Karl, her young son
They are sleepless and sway to the motion of the vehicle
'  -  -  - 1790' Mozart lying in bed exhausted, but still dictating urgently
We do not hear what he is saying to Salieri, who still sits writing assiduously
Mozart is looking very sick: sweat is pouring from his forehead
-   - 1790' The carriage, moving through the night, to the sound of the music
'  -  -  - 1790' Mozart still dictating; Salieri still writing without stop
-  - 1790'
The carriage has arrived
Constanze and her son alight with other passengers
Postillions attend to the horses
She takes her boy's hand
It is a cold wintry dawn
The music stutters to a close
End of the Confutatis
'  -  -  - 1790' Do you want to rest a bit
Oh no
'm not tired at all
We'll stop for just a moment
Then we'll do the Lacrimosa
can keep going,  assure you
Shall we try
Would you stay with me while  sleep a little
'm not leaving you
am so ashamed
What for
was foolish
thought you did not care for my work - or me
Forgive me
Forgive me
Mozart closes his eyes
Salieri stares at him
-   - 1790' Constanze and Karl approach along the cobbled street, hand in hand toward their house
Snow lies in the street
'  -  -  - 1790' Mozart lies asleep in the bed, holding the last pages of the manuscript
Salieri lies across from him on Karl's small bed in his shirt sleeves and waistcoat
The child's bed is obviously too small for him and he is forced in to a cramped position
'   -  - 1790' Constanze and Karl arrive at the door
They enter
'  -   -  - 1790' It is as disordered as before, save that the table, previously littered with pages, is now completely bare
Constanze looks at it with surprise and enters the bedroom
'  -  -  - 1790' Mozart is asleep in the bed
Salieri is dozing on the nearby child's bed
The room is full of the trailing smoke from guttering and guttered candles
Startled by Constanze's entrance and her young son, Salieri scrambles up
As he does so, he attempts to button his waistcoat, but does it ineptly, so that the vestment becomes bunched up, making him look absurd
What are you doing here
Your husband is ill, ma'am
He took sick
brought him home
Why you
was at hand
Well, thank you very much
You can go now
He needs me, ma'am
No, he doesn't
And  don't want you here
Just go, please
He asked me to stay
And 'm asking you - She notices a movement from the bed
Mozart wakes
He sees Constanze and smiles with real joy
Forgetting Salieri, she goes to her husband
Wolfi, 'm back
'm still very angry with you, but  missed you so much
She throws herself on the bed
'll never leave you again
If you'll just try a little harder to be nice to me
And 'll try to do better, too
We must
We must
This was just silly and stupid
She hugs her husband desperately
He stares at her with obvious relief, not able to speak
Suddenly she sees the manuscript in his hand
What is this
She looks at it and recognizes it
Oh no, not this
Not this, Wolfi
You're not to work on this ever again
've decided
She takes it from his weak hand
At the same moment Salieri reaches out his hand to take it and add it to the pile on the table
She stares at him, trying to understand - suspicious and frightened and at the same time unable to make a sound
Mozart makes a convulsive gesture to reclaim the pages
The coins brought by Salieri fall on the floor
Karl runs after them, laughing
(to Salieri) This is not his handwriting
No
was assisting him
He asked me
He's not going to work on this anymore
It is making him ill
Please
She extends her hand for the Requiem, as she stands up
Salieri hesitates
(hard) Please
With extreme reluctance - it costs him agony to do it - Salieri hands over the score of the Requiem to her
Thank you
She marches with the manuscript over to a large chest in the room, opens it, throws the manuscript inside, shuts the lid, locks it and pockets the key
Involuntarily Salieri stretches out his arms for the lost manuscript
But - but - but - She turns and faces him
Good night
He stares at her, stunned
regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri
Respect my wish and go
Madame,  will respect his
He asked me to stay here
They look at each other in mutual hatred
She turns to the bed
Mozart appears to have gone to sleep again
Wolfi
(louder) Wolfi
She moves to the bed
The child is playing with the coins on the floor
Faintly we hear the start of the Lacrimosa from the Requiem
Salieri watches as she touches her husband's hand
As the music grows, we realize that Mozart is dead
, Constanze staring wide-eyed in dawning apprehension
, Salieri also comprehending hat he has been cheated
The music rises
, The child on the floor, playing with the money
: '  -  -    - 1790' The Lacrimosa continues through all of the following: a small group of people emerges from the side door into the raw, wet day, accompanying a cheap wooden coffin
The coffin is borne by a gravedigger and Schikaneder in mourning clothes
They load it onto a cart, drawn by a poor black horse
All the rest are in black, also: Salieri, Von Swieten, Constanze and her son, Karl, Madame Weber and her youngest daughter Sophie, and even Lorl, the maid
It is drizzling
The cart sets off
The group follows
: -   - 1790' The group has already passed beyond the city limits following the miserable cart
The Lacrimosa accompanies them with its measured thread
The drizzle of rain has now become heavy
One by one, the group breaks up and shelters under the trees
The cart moves on toward the cemetery, alone, followed by nobody, growing more and more distant
They watch it go
Salieri and Von Swieten shake hands mournfully, the water soaking their black tall hats
Schikaneder is in tears
Constanze is near collapse
Salieri moves to assist her, but she turns away from him, seeking the arm of Cavalieri
Madame Weber takes Karl's hand
The music builds to its climax on Dona Eis Pacem
We back to: '   -  - 1823 Morning light fills the room
Old Salieri sits weeping convulsively, as the music stops
Tears stream down his face
Vogler watches him, amazed
Why
Why
Why
Why add to your misery by confessing to murder
You didn't kill him
did
No, you didn't
poisoned his life
But not his body
What difference does that make
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer
Is that your penance
Is it
No, Father
From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me
Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing
And that's my immortality - at last
Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy
At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God
Oh my son, my poor son
Don't pity me
Pity yourself
You serve a wicked God
He killed Mozart, not
Took him, snatched him away, without pity
He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory
He doesn't care
Understand that
God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses
He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away
Like an old, worn out flute
-   - 1790' The rain has eased off
with two boy acolytes is standing beside an open communal grave
Mozart's body is lifted out of the cheap pine box in a sack
We see that the grave contains twenty other such sacks
The gravedigger throws the one containing Mozart amongst the others
An assistant pours quicklime over the whole pile of them
The acolytes swing their censers
The Lord giveth
The Lord taketh away
Blessed be the name of the Lord
: '   -  - 1823 Why did He do it
Why didn't He kill me
had no value
What was the use, keeping me alive for thirty-two years of torture
Thirty-two years of honours and awards
He tears off the Civilian Medal and Chain with which the Emperor invested him and has been wearing the whole time and throws it across the room
Being bowed to and saluted, called 'distinguished - distinguished Salieri' - by men incapable of distinguishing
Thirty-two years of meaningless fame to end up alone in my room, watching myself become extinct
My music growing fainter, all the time fainter, until no one plays it at all
And his growing louder, filling the world with wonder
And everyone who loves my sacred art crying, Mozart
Bless you, Mozart
The door opens
An attendant comes in, cheerful and hearty
Good morning, Professor
Time for the water closet
And then we've got your favourite breakfast for you - sugar-rolls
(to Vogler) He loves those
Fresh sugar-rolls
Salieri ignores him and stares only at the priest, who stares back
Goodbye, Father
'll speak for you
speak for all mediocrities in the world
am their champion
am their patron saint
On their behalf deny Him, your God of no mercy
Your God who tortures men with longings they can never fulfill
He may forgive me:  shall never forgive Him
He signs to the attendant, who wheels him in his chair out of the room
The priest stares after him
- The corridor is filled with patients in white linen smocks, all taking their morning exercise walk in the care of nurses and nuns
They form a long, wretched, strange procession - some of them are clearly very disturbed
As Old Salieri is pushed through them in his wheelchair, he lifts his hands to them in benediction
Mediocrities everywhere, now and to come:  absolve you all
Amen
Amen
Amen
Finally, he turns full-face to the camera and blesses us the audience, making the Sign of the Cross
Underneath we hear, stealing in and growing louder, the tremendous Masonic Funeral Music of Mozart
