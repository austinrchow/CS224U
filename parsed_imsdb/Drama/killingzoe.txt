Written by Roger Avary : -  - Rain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi zone of the Charles de Gualle Airport
Aside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the cab  we hear the sounds of the airport:  the almost monotonic loudspeaker declaring in French that loitering is not permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from other automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they get their bearings
Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is Angelique Kidjo's funky song "Batonga"
Then, the rear door to the cab opens and in an we see , a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing eyes shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy red hair
His face has drops on it from the flurry outside
He settles himself, then looks to the  , an easy going Senegalese/Frenchman, in the front seat
Hotel Mondial
Le Mondial
Tres bien
He starts driving
Avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un moment
'autoroute est ferme
cause du 14 Juillet
He drives for a while
[Do you mind the radio
] Zed looks at the meter, francs are clicking away
He also looks at the cab driver's license, his name is Moises Du Bois
[Do you want me to turn the radio off
] (realizing he's being asked a question) don't speak French
The driver turns around
(in broken English) Ah
American
That's right
That's good because  speak a little English
Zed nods
asked if you mind the radio
Music
You know
Zed shakes his head "no"
(with a smile) Super cool
Zed adjusts his watch
What time is it
Time, time, time
don't know
Daytime
Zed forgets the adjustment for now
Are you in town for business
Yes
It's a nice hotel
Your hotel
Very big rooms
He looks at Zed in the rear view mirror
Do you know Paris
've been here once before
When  was younger
The cab driver smiles
Those were the days
They drive for a while
Married
beg your pardon
Do you have a wife
No
(then after thinking about it for a while) Why
Well, if you need a wife for the night
(searching for the right words in French) Une escorte
Pour vous faire visiter
(then back to his broken English) For business
give you my number
Very nice girl
French
Like when you were young
He lifts his hand and shows his index and middle finger tightly extended together, then he crosses them
Know what  mean
Zed smiles at this and nods
Speaks the language of love
Take you to heaven and back
You just tell me and set it up
Zed shakes his head and laughs
What you laughing at
You let Moises set it up
She treat you right
She treat you fine
Zed can do nothing but smile at the thought of it
: -  - long, empty hallway of a moderately priced hotel
From around a corner comes a  carrying Zed's one bag
Zed is right behind him
They come up to room 6A and the bellboy unlocks the door
- The door to the room opens and the bellboy, followed by Zed, walks into the room
He puts Zed's bag onto one of those luggage holders and proceeds to show him the room
Sitting on the bed is a large air freight package
(in broken English) Your package
It arrived in the last night of before last night
He points to the telephone
Ah
telephone, for the room service
He motions toward the bathroom
The toilet
He opens the closet door
To hang the clothes
He points to a control console next to the bed
From here you can operate the television
Then he pauses at the door before he goes out
Zed reaches into his pocket and takes out some French money, he starts fingering through it
Then, the bellboy takes the liberty of showing Zed which bills to give him
(after getting what he wanted) Merci
He starts to leave
Oh, wait
The bellboy turns around
What time is it
(confused) What time is it
(pointing at his watch) Time
Ah
Yes
Il est presque huit heures moins dix
The bellboy clicks his heels and walks out the door
Zed looks around the room, still wondering what time it is, and takes a seat on the bed
Obviously tired from the flight Zed unbuttons his shirt a bit and lays back on the bed next to the package
Before he dozes off to sleep he takes his watch off and places it on the bedside table
He is asleep
: -  - Zed's bed, while still made, looks like it's been slept in
Sitting on it is the ripped open air freight package
Inside of it is a black steel briefcase
The shower is on and from the look of things Zed is in it
On the bedside table we see Zed's watch
It reads 12:10
Next to it is the phone
Next to the phone is a piece of folded paper with Moises' name and a phone number that reads: 45
63
53
37
-  -  - Zed is in the shower letting the water run directly into his face and cascade down his body
He opens his mouth and freely drinks the water, then he spits some out with a spurt
Then he stops, attentive, listening for something
He turns the shower off
Then he hears it again, the knocking on the door
-  - Zed grabs a towel and climbs out of the shower
He makes his way toward the knocking
- Zed walks to the door to his room with the towel wrapped around his waist
He opens it
In the hall is , a cute French girl of not more than twenty
She's chewing on gum the way a schoolgirl might, but she looks like no girl Zed ever went to school with
Bonjour
(a little awkwardly) Bonjour
Zed opens up the door and lets her in
She checks out the room and places her bag on the bed
Then she makes her way to the window for a view of the city
Wow
Vous avez une belle chambre
Je ne suis jamais venue dans cet hotel
She turns to him, but in the process takes the time to examine every detail of the room
Ca sera 150 francs de l'heure
Toute la nuit pour 700
'avance
Et faudra porter un-- don't speak French
She blows a bubble
It's okay
She takes a seat on the bed
It will be one thousand francs for all night
In advance
Zed takes the money out of his wallet and gives it to her
We can do it now if you want
Well, let me just dry up
Okay, but it's not necessary
He goes into the bathroom and starts drying himself
She puts the money in her bag and then turns on the television from the remote console
French talk show comes on
She changes the channel until she comes to a station playing
Murnau's silent classic, "Nosferatu"
She smiles and sits back to watch
(
) (from the bathroom) What's your name
Zoe or Zoey
Which ever you like
(
) My name's Zed
(smiling at this) That's funny
We both have  names
Zed comes walking out of the bathroom drying his hair
His pants are on
What was that
She notices his pants
You can take those off
The pants
'd rather watch you get undressed first
(matter-of-factly) Alright
She stands up and starts to lift her top off
He stops her
Slower
He lays down on the bed
She stands there looking at him and then smiles
Alright Mister America
Zed
Then, with Zed laying on the bed and watching her, she slowly, seductively strips in front of him, never taking her eyes from his eyes, until she is totally naked
Slow enough for you
Then, like a cat prowling for it's prey, she crawls over the bed to him and begins to unbuckle his pants
She removes the pants and climbs on top of him
They begin to make love
On the television, "Nosferatu" silently plays
Zoey and Zed quicken their pace with an urgency one can't resist during a moment of passion
She cries out and lowers herself to his grasp
An overcomes her mind
They quicken to an almost violent speed and then expire, both satisfied
She begins to kiss him multiple times over the face
'etait formidable
She rolls over, still hugging him, purring like a kitten
They rest there for a while
holding each other
'm cold
She takes the covers and crawls under them, so does Zed
Zed
Yes
Moises told me you were in town for business
Yes
What kind of business
Why
don't know
'm just curious
Do you ask all your clients questions
No
Just the ones  like
So you like me
Yes
Why
Because you're
a good person
run into some real creeps
You know
How do you know 'm a good person
Body language
We fit together
All men and women fit together
Hell, even some men fit together
No, but you know, we clicked
You made me orgasm
Do you know how often orgasm with a man Moises sets me up with
No  don't
Usually never
They're almost always fat like pigs
Zed laughs at this
And you make me feel safe
That's something more important than the orgasm
An integral part maybe of the orgasm
never really thought of it like that
Well, it's true
Zed nods at this
Turn off the television
Zed reaches over and turns it off from the console
So  mean it when  tell you Zed,  like you very much
Well,  like you too Zoe
Honest
He nods
Why
For the same reason
Any man can orgasm
Even with his own hand
Zed stares ahead as he thinks of an answer
Well,  like your honesty
You're open
Unlike most prostitutes 've been with
She doesn't like the sound of this
She slaps him
am not a prostitute
Zed is a little surprised at this
Really
Can  have my francs back then
'm a student
And to pay for the classes  became an escort
It's my choice to sleep with you
see
What
You don't understand
No,  do
Hey, it's not easy
didn't say it was
'm here because  want to
Okay, okay relax
What school do you go to
The Centre du Art, Paris
That's really interesting
What kind of art do you study
Not any of the old shit
Oh
have a day job too
Three times a week
She rolls onto her back and stares into an imaginary world as she talks to Zed
But someday there will be only my art
What kind of things do you paint
don't paint
make things
Objects
Not like sculpture
Like life
but with no narrative
want when someone looks at one of my objects for there to be no reference to the world
Void of feeling, emotion
void of destiny
Those are left for me
They belong only to me
If someone else can see into it
then it is no longer mine
have failed
And would destroy it
don't care how much cash they would offer me
It would be shit
can't tell you how many objects of mine have been destroyed
They told too much about me
And if someone wants to know something about me
'll tell them myself
The way 'm telling you
She looks back at him
What  do  do only for the objects
'd like to see one of these
What
So you could see the work of a whore
He decides to put a stop to this once and for all
Zoey
'm sorry for calling you a prostitute
didn't understand the difference
The difference is a prostitute would have lied to you about her orgasm
He gives her a kiss
If these things you make are as true as you are
'm sure they're as indescribable
Perhaps, someday, you'll make one
about me
If  do
you'll never know which one it is
Because 'll be the only one who understands
'll be the only one who can look into it and see where in my life it came from
Zed is unable to speak
They look into each others eyes for a long moment, hearing the sounds of the city drift in through the window
Then she leans forward and gives him a soft understanding kiss
: '  - Zed is asleep
Zoey is asleep in his arms
There is a knocking at the door
Zed opens his eyes
The knock becomes a pound
Zed gets up and puts on his pants
Zoey gets up and looks around
(groggily) What time is it
have no idea
Night time
There is more pounding on the door
'm going to take a shower
She trots off naked to the bathroom and starts the shower
Zed walks over to the door and opens it up
Standing in the hall is Eric, a Frenchman of Zed's age wearing baggy French-style clothes
(with a thick accent) Hey you madman
Zed's happy to see him
Eric
Come in
They hug
What happened to you
thought you were going to call
Eric walks in and starts to notice the traces of wild love making around the room
(smiling) Oh  see
You have been busy
Sorry,  asked the hotel to give me a wake up call
That's good, but now  am here
So let's go
We have a lot to talk about
What about the girl
Is she your girlfriend
No
Fuck her
He peeks into the bathroom
She's a dishrag whore
Kick her out
'll let her stay here tonight
Don't be silly
It's dangerous
Eric walks into the bathroom
-  - Eric walks up to the shower and knocks on the door
Zoey is obviously surprised to see him
(in French with English subtitles) [Okay
Get out of the shower
It's time for you to leave
] [Fuck you
] Eric opens up the door and yanks her out of the shower
[No
Come on you fucking slut
] She shrieks
[Let go of me you shit
] He drags her out into the room, she is dripping wet
- Zed can't believe this
Eric
(to Zed) Don't worry about her
(to Zoey in French) [Why don't you just go back to your pimp and suck his black dick
] She bites his hand
He yells in pain
God damn it
He kicks her in the butt and sends her toward the door
[Get the fuck out of here you fucking whore
] He opens the door and throws her into the hall
-  - Naked, Zoey falls into the hall
Eric slams the door shut
She is instantly back on her feet and screaming as she pounds on the door
[Give me my clothes you asshole
] - She is pounding on the door
(looking at his hand wound) God damn it
Look at my hand
(shocked at the whole incident) Jesus Eric
(
) Ouvres
Je veux mes habits
Eric listens
Oh shit
Her clothes
He picks up her clothes and her bag, opens the door, and throws it into the hall just long enough for her to yell at him
(almost too quick to understand) Tu te prends pour qui espece de connard
La ferme
He slams the door shut
Then he turns to Zed
So tell me, what have you been up to
Zed sits down on the bed
(
) Allez vous faire enculer tous le deux
Eric,  liked that girl
Oh
Well, then why didn't you stop me
Because you were on a rampage
Look, your whole life you've done nothing but fuck whores
girl like that will give you
Why don't you find a nice girl in the suburbs
Because when you need to get off you don't want to have to date for months to do it
Just use your hand like me
Sometimes you just need honesty
and security
don't understand
Anyway, it's too late
Get dressed, let's go out and meet the boys
Okay, let me take a shower
No, in Paris it's good to smell like you've been fucking
It will make them respect you
Oh
Just put on a shirt and a sport coat
Zed starts to get dressed - The McDonalds on the corner of Boulevard Saint Michel and Rue Soufflot is bustling
Eric's Citroen screeches around the corner on it's way past the Pantheon and into the heart of the fifth Arrondissment
'  -  - Eric and Zed are driving through the streets of Paris in Eric's car
The grooving Ryuichi Sakamoto song "Triste" is playing on the radio
'm glad you came
How long has it been
Years
It's amazing, you know
Here you are
One day in America
Now here
Well, to be honest there really wasn't much happening for me in the states
But in Paris your old friend Eric has a job for you, so you came
That's good
How could  resist your invitation
You would have been stupid to
So what have you been doing here
After school  spent some time in Algeria studying African philosophy
And then bummed around
You know
For fun
For a while  worked at Le Figaro
The newspaper
Really
Yes
With an assumed Masters degree
And lately we have just been bombing fascists here in Paris
You know, like terrorists
Zed looks over at him
It's fun
: '  -   - Eric and Zed walk up the stairs to the fifth floor where Eric's flat is
On the top landing there is a dead cat laying
Zed and Eric notice the cat as Eric is opening the door
There is also a telephone coming out of the neighbors door
The people next door are on holiday
We took their phone
If you want to make a long distance call, go ahead
Is that cat dead
don't know
think it's asleep but it's been there for days
Eric gives it a kick
No response
guess it is dead
They walk into the flat
'  -   - Eric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back
In the front of the living room there is a small balcony where the sounds of the city pour in
The room itself is a general mess
bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor
Hung up on the wall is a huge, French "Dressed To Kill" poster
Some Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing
Sitting at the table playing cards are three men:  , , and
Sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is and
They all turn as Zed and Eric walk in
Hello
They all return the greeting
(to Zed) Okay
This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Oliver, and Claude
Got it
will
They all know who you are
(to the rest of them) Ne soyez pa salauds
Offrez une biere au plus grand perceur de coffres
Oliver stands up and walks to the kitchen
(with an English accent) Zed, would you like a beer
Thanks
Don't think of it
(to Zed) Come
Sit down
'  -  - The kitchen is an absolute pig stye
Dishes are piled up in the sink and on the counter
Oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties it
He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer into the glass
'  -   - Zed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude
Suddenly, a   dressed in a little Uncle Sam costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes
Eric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles
(to Zed) Easy
Don't scare him
He just wants to claim you
Zed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto Claude's shoulder
Let me introduce you properly
This is Enrique
The monkey screeches
He likes to be called Chim Chim, but we don't always get what we like
do we
Again, the hideous creature screeches
(to Enrique) Tais-toi
(then to Zed) Do you like hash
Then Eric interrupts
(jokingly) Don't sit next to that junkie
Ahhhhhh
Claude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a mass of sparks
They laugh
(to Claude) That little shit monkey of yours pissed on my Billy Holiday albums
Next time he's out the door
(to Zed) Zed, come here
Zed gets up and goes with Eric to the bedroom
On the way Oliver hands him the glass of beer
Here you go mate
Thanks
Oliver sits down next to Claude
'  -  - Eric's bed has probably never been made
In fact, this room looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment
But, there is a certain order to all this chaos
Eric pulls out a blueprint and spreads it out over the bed
Don't ask me where we got this
Okay
On Bastille Day, all the banks are closed
He places his hand on the blueprint
But this one
The Banque Internationale de Paris
And for being greedy capitalists perhaps they will remain closed next Bastille day
Yes
Zed smiles
We will go in and shut the bank down
Now, look at this
Eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic
As you can see, only one person can start the alarm
(he hands it to Zed) The concierge, at this desk
(he points it out on the blueprint) We will take care of him
Then we can close the bank
No one will know the difference since every other bank will be closed
(turning the schematic around) Are you sure he won't push the alarm
Ahhh
He's right next to the door
We'd have to be totally incompetent not to stop him
Don't worry about that
He points to the main floor vault
Here
This is where they keep the days reserve cash
Okay fuck that
He flips the page to the lower level blueprint
There are many vaults downstairs, but this is the vault we must get into
This is where the real prize is
What kind of vault is that
He checks the blueprint
Ah
Swiss made
Caliber
Caliber
(he thinks about it) It'll take three hours
No, that's too long
That's how long it'll take
Well shit
It's too long
We have to be in and out
(he snaps his fingers) Like that
Or there will be suspicion
little time is okay
but too long and
He shrugs his shoulders in an " don't know gesture
" Well hold on a second
(pointing to the blueprint) What's this
Eric looks down at the blueprint
There is a small passage connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault
Another vault
No this
Eric looks closely at the blueprint
don't know
it connects the two vaults
Well, what kind of vault is this other one
(reading the blueprint) Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon
Why would those two vaults be connected
don't know
Because  can get into this vault in half an hour
Maybe less
But this entry way is too small to get the platen out
We have a lot of merchandise in there
No, don't you see
We get in through this secondary vault and take this passage to the other main vault
From the inside  could open the Caliber vault in five minutes
You could open it in five minutes
From the inside it's easy
(excited) Hot damn
That is our answer
Okay
When is Bastille day
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
We're doing this tomorrow
But of course
It's impossible
It's not impossible
Everyone knows what to do
don't know what to do
You don't need to know shit
Just get into the vault and we'll do the rest
haven't even seen the bank
Fuck the bank
Before we do a job we live life
It's better that way
Okay
(unsure) Okay
Good
Now we do heroin
: '  -  - :  Eric making heroin
The heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water
Huddled around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver
(so high he's wobbling) You have to look at the Starship Enterprise as a metaphor for the human brain
No one is really listening to Oliver
Eric takes out a lighter and cooks it to a boil
(continuing) Spock is the right hemisphere of the brain, all logic and intellect
Mc Coy is the left hemisphere, stricktly emotional
And Kirk is the unseen observer
He drifts between the two
Back and forth, as it might be, caught between the two thought processes
[Cotton
] Ricardo hands him a cotton ball
(continuing) It's really quite brilliant you know
That's why Star Trek is and always will be a hit show
Eric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture
(to Oliver) [Here, shut up and hold this
] He hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle
Using the cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe
Then, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it
[Don't want to get air bubbles in my veins
] They all laugh at this
'  -   - In the meantime, Zed is sitting on the couch with Claude and Jean
Claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette
Jean is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small picture
Do you want heroin
No,  want to be sharp for tomorrow
Jean and Claude laugh at this
No
little bit of heroin, some hash, a beer
and you're just right
Jean snorts a line
Claude offers Zed the spliff
Zed shakes his head "no"
Okay
(recovering from the snort) That's good
Eric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen laughing
Eric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite Zed
Francois sits on the floor
Eric rolls up his sleeve
(to Ricardo in French) [Hold my arm
] (then to Zed) My vein is like a rock
Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes
Eric inserts the needle into his vein and draws out a little blood
It mixes with the heroin, then he pumps it in
then back into the syringe, then all the way back in
He withdraws the needle
Ricardo lets go of his arm
Eric is in bliss
His eyes roll back into his head
He looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep
Then Jean takes another snort
Pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting up, and drinking more beer
Then Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some heroin in it
(to Zed) Try some
It's called chasing the dragon
The Chinese have been doing it for centuries
don't think so
Oh, but you must
It will make you feel as though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and that you're rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper
They stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to his face
They then light the bottom of the foil with a lighter
Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon of smoke
Suddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we
: '  -  - Ricardo is racing Eric's car through the streets of Paris weaving in and out of traffic
Next to him is Oliver, and in the back seat is Zed and Eric
They're giving the very stoned Zed a whirlwind tour of the sights
car speeds up next to them
In it is Francois, and Claude, with Jean driving
They are racing with Ricardo through the streets
The Patrick Hernandez song "Born To Be Alive" is blasting away on the radio
There
That's Notre Dame
But before Zed can even look it has past by
Do you like French cars
All Zed can notice is that the speedometer is at 160 kilometers per hour
He tries to calculate what that is in miles per hour
(answering Enrique's question) Yes
like the Cadillac
Fifty-two to seventy-five
Very nice
Up here you can see the Eiffel tower
Zed is in too much of a blur
He leans over to Eric
Is tomorrow really Bastille day
Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in French history
And spend the rest of our lives in Monte Carlo
The drunken Englishman, Oliver, belches and then cheers
- The two cars are franticly racing through traffic
'  -  - Jean is very intent on beating them to whatever location it is they're going to
Claude, in the seat next to him, gives him some advice
[Faster, faster
go faster
Let's beat them
] Francois laughs and coughs out a cloud of smoke
- Jean's car makes a dangerous lane change across traffic and cuts off Ricardo
'  -  - Ricardo swerves as he passes a joint to Eric
[Shit
That bastard
] (to Ricardo) Watch it
Don't crash my car
Eric takes a big hit
Over here is where the male prostitutes sell themselves
Do you see
No, Zed doesn't see
Suddenly, everyone in the car is shouting out the windows
(out the window) Fucking fags
(also out the window) Suce ma bite
Perverts d'homosexuels
Eric laughs
(into Zed's ear) This is good to have you here
We could not do this without you
Zed nods
Everyone has agreed to give you double shares
That's good
Zed nods, delirious
You know  have
From the needle
Zed can't believe this
He's not sure if what he heard was what he thought he heard
Really
Then Eric sees something
Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe
They take a sharp turn
: - Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver are all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar
Somewhere crazy Raymond Scott Toy Jazz music is playing
An old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club
Nothing fancy
dirt floors, chairs and small tables scattered about
but the arched brick ceilings make for great acoustics
a  is playing away
In the audience sit about , all enjoying the music
In the back of the club near the doors some tables have been set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it
Behind the tables are two rotund but happy French women  and Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver walk in and immediately start blabbing away in French to Mirelle and Josephine
Eric hands them some money
' Everyone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club
Oliver sits next to Zed
So, how long have you known Eric
Well, Eric's mother is American
Yeah, and his dad's French
They're divorced
And she and his father had some kind of six month split plan set up
So every six months he would come back to the states
We were best friends
Eventually he and his mother had a falling out and he stayed here
It's been
years
Well, it's good to have you here
Eric speaks fairly highly of you
Say, he says you're a big fan of Viking films
Well
suppose
used to be, when was young
Oh they're the best
Helmets with horns on them
Shit
That's fucking genius
He starts laughing
How 'bout Toy Jazz
You like it
Zed watches the players on stage and then nods
Yeah
guess
love it
It's really good, you know
Like real music
It has a heart and culture all it's own
It's, like, jazz for dwarves
or guys in Leiderhosen
Total purity of essence
Yeah
Hungry cannibals'd like it
Then Claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle of red wine
Here, you must drink some of this wine, it's good
He pours Zed a glass
Oliver passes on the wine
(to Claude) Non merci, c'est de la merde
(to Oliver) La ferme
'est du bon vin
(to Zed) The fucking English
Zed sips some
He's in no real shape to tell if the wine's good or not
Suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder
The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a delirium of music
The band stands up
The people watching start to dance, if not in their seats then right in front of everything
' Suddenly, Zed notices something
Eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the band
' Zed blinks but it's true
Oliver and Claude start laughing
Look at him
He's crazy
And surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up with the other musicians and sounding pretty good
Eric is all smile as he plays with them
Sweat is running down his face but he's caught up in the moment
, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the stage, caught up in Eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like James Brown
Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back to a musician
The set is over
Eric skips off the stage and walks over to where Oliver, Claude, and Zed are sitting
- The McDonalds on the corner of Boulevard Saint Michel and Rue Soufflot is bustling
Eric's Citroen screeches around the corner on it's way past the Pantheon and into the heart of the fifth Arrondissment
'  -  - Eric and Zed are driving through the streets of Paris in Eric's car
The grooving Ryuichi Sakamoto song "Triste" is playing on the radio
'm glad you came
How long has it been
Years
It's amazing, you know
Here you are
One day in America
Now here
Well, to be honest there really wasn't much happening for me in the states
But in Paris your old friend Eric has a job for you, so you came
That's good
How could  resist your invitation
You would have been stupid to
So what have you been doing here
After school  spent some time in Algeria studying African philosophy
And then bummed around
You know
For fun
For a while  worked at Le Figaro
The newspaper
Really
Yes
With an assumed Masters degree
And lately we have just been bombing fascists here in Paris
You know, like terrorists
Zed looks over at him
It's fun
: '  -   - Eric and Zed walk up the stairs to the fifth floor where Eric's flat is
On the top landing there is a dead cat laying
Zed and Eric notice the cat as Eric is opening the door
There is also a telephone coming out of the neighbors door
The people next door are on holiday
We took their phone
If you want to make a long distance call, go ahead
Is that cat dead
don't know
think it's asleep but it's been there for days
Eric gives it a kick
No response
guess it is dead
They walk into the flat
'  -   - Eric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back
In the front of the living room there is a small balcony where the sounds of the city pour in
The room itself is a general mess
bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor
Hung up on the wall is a huge, French "Dressed To Kill" poster
Some Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing
Sitting at the table playing cards are three men:  , , and
Sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is and
They all turn as Zed and Eric walk in
Hello
They all return the greeting
(to Zed) Okay
This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Oliver, and Claude
Got it
will
They all know who you are
(to the rest of them) Ne soyez pa salauds
Offrez une biere au plus grand perceur de coffres
Oliver stands up and walks to the kitchen
(with an English accent) Zed, would you like a beer
Thanks
Don't think of it
(to Zed) Come
Sit down
'  -  - The kitchen is an absolute pig stye
Dishes are piled up in the sink and on the counter
Oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties it
He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer into the glass
'  -   - Zed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude
Suddenly, a   dressed in a little Uncle Sam costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes
Eric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles
(to Zed) Easy
Don't scare him
He just wants to claim you
Zed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto Claude's shoulder
Let me introduce you properly
This is Enrique
The monkey screeches
He likes to be called Chim Chim, but we don't always get what we like
do we
Again, the hideous creature screeches
(to Enrique) Tais-toi
(then to Zed) Do you like hash
Then Eric interrupts
(jokingly) Don't sit next to that junkie
Ahhhhhh
Claude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a mass of sparks
They laugh
(to Claude) That little shit monkey of yours pissed on my Billy Holiday albums
Next time he's out the door
(to Zed) Zed, come here
Zed gets up and goes with Eric to the bedroom
On the way Oliver hands him the glass of beer
Here you go mate
Thanks
Oliver sits down next to Claude
'  -  - Eric's bed has probably never been made
In fact, this room looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment
But, there is a certain order to all this chaos
Eric pulls out a blueprint and spreads it out over the bed
Don't ask me where we got this
Okay
On Bastille Day, all the banks are closed
He places his hand on the blueprint
But this one
The Banque Internationale de Paris
And for being greedy capitalists perhaps they will remain closed next Bastille day
Yes
Zed smiles
We will go in and shut the bank down
Now, look at this
Eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic
As you can see, only one person can start the alarm
(he hands it to Zed) The concierge, at this desk
(he points it out on the blueprint) We will take care of him
Then we can close the bank
No one will know the difference since every other bank will be closed
(turning the schematic around) Are you sure he won't push the alarm
Ahhh
He's right next to the door
We'd have to be totally incompetent not to stop him
Don't worry about that
He points to the main floor vault
Here
This is where they keep the days reserve cash
Okay fuck that
He flips the page to the lower level blueprint
There are many vaults downstairs, but this is the vault we must get into
This is where the real prize is
What kind of vault is that
He checks the blueprint
Ah
Swiss made
Caliber
Caliber
(he thinks about it) It'll take three hours
No, that's too long
That's how long it'll take
Well shit
It's too long
We have to be in and out
(he snaps his fingers) Like that
Or there will be suspicion
little time is okay
but too long and
He shrugs his shoulders in an " don't know gesture
" Well hold on a second
(pointing to the blueprint) What's this
Eric looks down at the blueprint
There is a small passage connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault
Another vault
No this
Eric looks closely at the blueprint
don't know
it connects the two vaults
Well, what kind of vault is this other one
(reading the blueprint) Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon
Why would those two vaults be connected
don't know
Because  can get into this vault in half an hour
Maybe less
But this entry way is too small to get the platen out
We have a lot of merchandise in there
No, don't you see
We get in through this secondary vault and take this passage to the other main vault
From the inside  could open the Caliber vault in five minutes
You could open it in five minutes
From the inside it's easy
(excited) Hot damn
That is our answer
Okay
When is Bastille day
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
We're doing this tomorrow
But of course
It's impossible
It's not impossible
Everyone knows what to do
don't know what to do
You don't need to know shit
Just get into the vault and we'll do the rest
haven't even seen the bank
Fuck the bank
Before we do a job we live life
It's better that way
Okay
(unsure) Okay
Good
Now we do heroin
: '  -  - :  Eric making heroin
The heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water
Huddled around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver
(so high he's wobbling) You have to look at the Starship Enterprise as a metaphor for the human brain
No one is really listening to Oliver
Eric takes out a lighter and cooks it to a boil
(continuing) Spock is the right hemisphere of the brain, all logic and intellect
Mc Coy is the left hemisphere, stricktly emotional
And Kirk is the unseen observer
He drifts between the two
Back and forth, as it might be, caught between the two thought processes
[Cotton
] Ricardo hands him a cotton ball
(continuing) It's really quite brilliant you know
That's why Star Trek is and always will be a hit show
Eric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture
(to Oliver) [Here, shut up and hold this
] He hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle
Using the cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe
Then, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it
[Don't want to get air bubbles in my veins
] They all laugh at this
'  -   - In the meantime, Zed is sitting on the couch with Claude and Jean
Claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette
Jean is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small picture
Do you want heroin
No,  want to be sharp for tomorrow
Jean and Claude laugh at this
No
little bit of heroin, some hash, a beer
and you're just right
Jean snorts a line
Claude offers Zed the spliff
Zed shakes his head "no"
Okay
(recovering from the snort) That's good
Eric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen laughing
Eric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite Zed
Francois sits on the floor
Eric rolls up his sleeve
(to Ricardo in French) [Hold my arm
] (then to Zed) My vein is like a rock
Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes
Eric inserts the needle into his vein and draws out a little blood
It mixes with the heroin, then he pumps it in
then back into the syringe, then all the way back in
He withdraws the needle
Ricardo lets go of his arm
Eric is in bliss
His eyes roll back into his head
He looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep
Then Jean takes another snort
Pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting up, and drinking more beer
Then Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some heroin in it
(to Zed) Try some
It's called chasing the dragon
The Chinese have been doing it for centuries
don't think so
Oh, but you must
It will make you feel as though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and that you're rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper
They stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to his face
They then light the bottom of the foil with a lighter
Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon of smoke
Suddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we
: '  -  - Ricardo is racing Eric's car through the streets of Paris weaving in and out of traffic
Next to him is Oliver, and in the back seat is Zed and Eric
They're giving the very stoned Zed a whirlwind tour of the sights
car speeds up next to them
In it is Francois, and Claude, with Jean driving
They are racing with Ricardo through the streets
The Patrick Hernandez song "Born To Be Alive" is blasting away on the radio
There
That's Notre Dame
But before Zed can even look it has past by
Do you like French cars
All Zed can notice is that the speedometer is at 160 kilometers per hour
He tries to calculate what that is in miles per hour
(answering Enrique's question) Yes
like the Cadillac
Fifty-two to seventy-five
Very nice
Up here you can see the Eiffel tower
Zed is in too much of a blur
He leans over to Eric
Is tomorrow really Bastille day
Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in French history
And spend the rest of our lives in Monte Carlo
The drunken Englishman, Oliver, belches and then cheers
- The two cars are franticly racing through traffic
'  -  - Jean is very intent on beating them to whatever location it is they're going to
Claude, in the seat next to him, gives him some advice
[Faster, faster
go faster
Let's beat them
] Francois laughs and coughs out a cloud of smoke
- Jean's car makes a dangerous lane change across traffic and cuts off Ricardo
'  -  - Ricardo swerves as he passes a joint to Eric
[Shit
That bastard
] (to Ricardo) Watch it
Don't crash my car
Eric takes a big hit
Over here is where the male prostitutes sell themselves
Do you see
No, Zed doesn't see
Suddenly, everyone in the car is shouting out the windows
(out the window) Fucking fags
(also out the window) Suce ma bite
Perverts d'homosexuels
Eric laughs
(into Zed's ear) This is good to have you here
We could not do this without you
Zed nods
Everyone has agreed to give you double shares
That's good
Zed nods, delirious
You know  have
From the needle
Zed can't believe this
He's not sure if what he heard was what he thought he heard
Really
Then Eric sees something
Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe
They take a sharp turn
: - Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver are all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar
Somewhere crazy Raymond Scott Toy Jazz music is playing
An old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club
Nothing fancy
dirt floors, chairs and small tables scattered about
but the arched brick ceilings make for great acoustics
a  is playing away
In the audience sit about , all enjoying the music
In the back of the club near the doors some tables have been set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it
Behind the tables are two rotund but happy French women  and Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver walk in and immediately start blabbing away in French to Mirelle and Josephine
Eric hands them some money
' Everyone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club
Oliver sits next to Zed
So, how long have you known Eric
Well, Eric's mother is American
Yeah, and his dad's French
They're divorced
And she and his father had some kind of six month split plan set up
So every six months he would come back to the states
We were best friends
Eventually he and his mother had a falling out and he stayed here
It's been
years
Well, it's good to have you here
Eric speaks fairly highly of you
Say, he says you're a big fan of Viking films
Well
suppose
used to be, when was young
Oh they're the best
Helmets with horns on them
Shit
That's fucking genius
He starts laughing
How 'bout Toy Jazz
You like it
Zed watches the players on stage and then nods
Yeah
guess
love it
It's really good, you know
Like real music
It has a heart and culture all it's own
It's, like, jazz for dwarves
or guys in Leiderhosen
Total purity of essence
Yeah
Hungry cannibals'd like it
Then Claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle of red wine
Here, you must drink some of this wine, it's good
He pours Zed a glass
Oliver passes on the wine
(to Claude) Non merci, c'est de la merde
(to Oliver) La ferme
'est du bon vin
(to Zed) The fucking English
Zed sips some
He's in no real shape to tell if the wine's good or not
Suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder
The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a delirium of music
The band stands up
The people watching start to dance, if not in their seats then right in front of everything
' Suddenly, Zed notices something
Eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the band
' Zed blinks but it's true
Oliver and Claude start laughing
Look at him
He's crazy
And surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up with the other musicians and sounding pretty good
Eric is all smile as he plays with them
Sweat is running down his face but he's caught up in the moment
, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the stage, caught up in Eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like James Brown
Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back to a musician
The set is over
Eric skips off the stage and walks over to where Oliver, Claude, and Zed are sitting
- :  The door to the bank
Francois puts a sign on the door that reads:  [Closed for Bastille Day]
: -    - The sub lobby teller and the sub lobby guard #2 rendezvous with the sub lobby assistant
(to assistant) [Do the phones work
] [They went dead
] Merde
They walk out into the sub lobby
-   - The sub level teller and the sub lobby assistant walk into the sub lobby just as Eric, Zed, Oliver, and the bank manager start coming down the stairs
At the sight of Eric and his men the sub lobby guard #2 aims his weapon but does not fire because of the bank manager
Eric presses his Uzi against the bank manager's neck
(to the guard) [Drop the gun
] He doesn't
[Drop your gun now and nobody dies
] After a moments thought about this, and the fact that Oliver has a sawed-off aimed at him, he slowly puts his gun on the floor
[Good boy
] They descend down the stairs into the sub lobby
Oliver takes his gun
: -  - Francois, Ricardo, and Jean have finished herding everyone behind the teller windows
Claude is on his way downstairs
['m going to check things out downstairs
] (to the people) [Now
On the ground
Face down
] Then, for effect, he kicks a man
: -   - Claude comes downstairs with his gun raised
[All clear down here
] Everyone turns
[Take these two upstairs
And chain the gate to the sub lobby shut
] Oliver pushes the sub lobby guard #2 and the sub lobby assistant toward Claude
Then he hands him a chain
Claude can barely maintain his enthusiasm
[The phones and video are down
We're locked up tight
] (then in English) We fucking did it
He takes the two upstairs
Eric smiles through his teeth at the bank manager
[Any others  should worry about
] [No
] (to Oliver) [Well, just to be sure--] Then, from one of the safety deposit booths a sound is heard
All eyes turn to it
Oliver walks up to it and kicks the door in
The stodgy customer is kneeling in it
He instantly holds his hands high
[Freeze motherfucker
] Eric walks up, gun in hand
[Who the fuck are you
] [Please don't shoot me
] [On the ground
] He does
(to the bank manager) [Making a deposit  hope
] (he smiles to Oliver) [Bring him with us
] They all make their way down through the sub lobby hall
-    - They're herding the men through the hall
(to the sub lobby teller) [Vault locked
] [Yes
] [Shut your fucking mouths
] (to Eric) [The vault doors are shut and time locked
You won't be able to open them
] They walk through a doorway into the storage/elevator area
- /  - Eric pushes the manager and the others through the doorway
(to the bank manager) [You think we're fucking amateurs
You think we're stupid
've got news for you
we planned ahead my friend
] Eric pushes them infront of the Calibre vault door
[Now save us a lot of time and just open the vault
] [No
] [Okay
] He releases the bank manager and stuffs the barrel of his handgun into the sub level tellers mouth
[Open the vault
] The teller's eyes widen
[ cannot
] [Oh
] (to the teller) [Can you
] [No
Once closed only  can open it
] [Then open it
] [ cannot
] The sub lobby teller's eyes plead with the bank manager
Zed is watching the whole affair nervously
[Do you understand that 'll kill her if you don't open this fucking vault
] [Do you understand that this is an international reserve bank
Robbing it is punishable by life imprisonment
] Eric fires
The back of the sub lobby teller's head paints the wall red
Jesus fucking Christ
The bank manager, shocked as he is, looks at Zed
He knows he's an American
The sub lobby teller's body slumps to the ground
Eric grabs the stodgy customer and puts the gun to his temple
[Open the vault door or 'll kill this man next
] The bank manager is freaking out, but after what was probably the most horribly agonizing internal debate, he holds his ground
[ still cannot open the vault
] [Come on
It's only things in there
This man is flesh and blood
] [ will not open the vault
] Eric no
can open the vault
Shut the fuck up
(then to the stodgy customer) [You're a customer in this bank and this is how they treat you
Do you have a family
] He nods his head "yes"
[Would you like to see them again
] He nods his head again
(to the manager) [This man has a family he would like to have Bastille day dinner with tonight
So save us some time and open the vault
] After losing about a pound of sweat
[No
] Eric quickly removes the gun from the customers temple and fires two shots into the bank manager's face
The bank manager falls against the vault door and onto the floor
Fucking idiot
(then to the stodgy customer) [You seem like a nice man
Tonight at dinner think about how lucky you are and how much you love your family
] He starts nodding his head
Oui
(to Oliver) [Take him upstairs
] Oliver takes the customer upstairs to the rest of the people
Eric rips off his mask
Don't you ever conflict with me during work again
Do you hear
Zed off his clown mask
You didn't have to shoot any of them
(patronizing) Oh, 'm sorry
didn't realize you were in charge now
Nobody told me
(his temper flares) If he had opened the vault it would have saved us a fucking hour
He charges into the reserve vault area
-    - They enter and Eric walks up to a bathroom door
Eric
It's just that we've gone from being thieves to murderers
Oh fuck it doesn't matter
Here you get the death penalty just for robbing a federal bank
thought the death penalty was abolished in 1980
Ohhhh
That's what they tell you
But who cares
need to take a piss
Eric enters the bathroom
(on his way into the bathroom) Why don't you open the vault
Zed looks at the bathroom door close
After a fuming pause he turns and walks back toward the Poseidon vault door
: -  - Francois peeks through the venetian blinds of the windows to the outside
[Looks clear
] In the meantime, behind the teller windows guarding the people who are laying on the floor, Jean and Ricardo are in the middle of a conversation
Oliver is sitting on the counter, having just brought the stodgy customer upstairs
Also here now are the sub lobby assistant and the sub lobby guard #2
[What do you mean you're not sure if the alarm went off or not
] [ mean 'm not sure
] [Well, either it did or it didn't
] [And 'm not sure
] [Well, do you think it did
] [ just fucking told you,  don't know
] [Take a guess
] [It didn't
] [You're sure
] [No
It's just a guess
] [Well what kind of a fucking guess is that
You're saying it could have
] [Yes
] [Well that's fucking great
Why didn't you just kill that asshole to begin with
knew  should have been the one to kill him
You're always so damn slow
] [Shit these masks are really hot
] [ know, 've got fucking sweat stinging my eyes
] In the meantime Zoey is on the floor, unsure of what is going on
: -   - Zed opens up his steel briefcase
Inside of it are all sorts of electronic gear and tools
He takes out a tape measure and some callipers and measures out a point on the vault door
He marks the point with a piece of chalk
: - '  - In one of the stalls Eric is preparing a syringe
He has just cooked the heroin and is now tapping on it to get the bubbles out
: -   - Zed takes a power drill out from the briefcase and attaches a special diamond tipped bit
He measures the depth he wants to drill to and then marks the bit with a yellow pencil
He places his ear to the vault and taps the spot
: - '  - Eric readies the needle and slaps his vein
He is shaking but trying to remain as still as possible
He places the needle at the end of a track on his arm and inserts it
: -   - Zed starts drilling into the point he marked with the chalk on the vault door
: - '  - Eric's eyes roll back into his head as the heroin fills his vein
He drops the needle to the floor and sits back to enjoy the rush
: -  - Zoey is sitting on the floor next to the other bank hostages
: -   - :  Zed's drill bit
It burrows into the steel wall of the safe spewing out spiral shavings
: -  - Zoey looks at all the people sitting around her
They're all scared
Jean, Ricardo, and Francois are talking amongst themselves
(in French to Ricardo) [Do you know one
] [Let's see
Okay
An unfortunate fellow was locked up in prison doing five to ten for armed robbery
All he could think of the whole time was eating pussy
] Zoey looks up at them telling the joke
[The day finally came for his release
He walked out of the prison with a new suit and fifty francs the officials had given him, and made a bee-line for the whorehouse in the nearest town
Slamming his fifty francs on the front desk, he said, " wanna eat some pussy
"] Jean is already laughing
['m not done
Listen
"Where've you been," said the greasy fellow behind the desk, "fifty francs won't get you a close look these days
"] Zoey glances at all of the people
Then her eyes lock with the concierge security guard
["Listen buddy," said the ex-convict, pulling him out of his chair by the shirt collar, " wanna eat some pussy, and want it now
"] The concierge security guard lifts his pant leg slowly
["Okay, okay," gasped the proprietor, "'ll see what  can do
"  So the ex-con followed him through to the very back of the warehouse through some stained, tattered red curtains, and into a grimy little room where a bedraggled looking whore lay spreadeagled on a filthy bed
"She's yours for fifty francs," said the proprietor, and the fellow went at it
] Zoey notices that on the concierge security guard's leg is an ankle holster with a small
38 pistol on it
His fingers begin to unsnap the safety harness on it
Her eyes widen
[After a little while, he came across a piece of egg
"That's funny," he thought to himself, " don't think  had egg for breakfast
"  But he spat it out and kept eating away
Next he found a piece of chipped beef wedged between his front teeth
"'m sure  haven't eaten chipped beef this week," he thought, but kept on
Then he came across the corn
"What is this
" he said, " think 'm going to be sick
"] The concierge security guard unsnaps the safety
Zoey knows he's going to make his move
["Ya know," says the whore, "that's what the last guy said
"] Before they can even laugh the concierge security guard whips out the
38 and fires three shots
Two of them hit Ricardo in the chest
He falls to the ground
The other hits Francois in the arm
In an instant Jean is firing his machine gun into the group of people huddled on the floor
Everyone is screaming and trying to get away
Machine gun fire cuts through the concierge security guard killing him dead
Unfortunately, the wild spray of bullets also rips into three of the tellers, four of the customers, and the loan officer, killing them all
People are trying to flee but Claude fires his gun into the ceiling
[No one fucking moves
] Jean has jumped up on the table and is aiming at the people
[Shit
What happened
] : -   - Zed looks up hearing the commotion
Eric comes running out of the bathroom and into the storage/elevator area
What is it
What's going on
Zed gets up to go upstairs
don't know
No
You stay here
Eric runs upstairs
: -  - Francois is on the ground holding his arm
He keeps rolling back and forth in pain
Ricardo is dead
Jean, Claude, and Oliver are waving their guns around ready to kill someone any second
[Nobody fucking moves
Nobody fucking moves
] Claude motions to the dead security guard
[The gun
Somebody get it
] Oliver goes over to the dead security guard, the whole time waving his gun at people
[Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
] He grabs the gun from the dead security guards limp grip
Eric storms in
He isn't wearing his mask
[What the fuck is going on
] Zoey notices Eric, she remembers him
(pointing at the dead man) [This crazy fuck shot Ricardo
] Eric looks over at Ricardo and then at the carnage
Then everybody notices he isn't wearing a mask
(quietly) [Eric, your mask
] Oh shit
Then Oliver yanks his off
Who gives a damn if they see us or not anyway
can't see a fucking think in this
Everyone takes their masks off
[Is this what happens
Is this what happens when  walk away for five minutes
] [He had a hidden gun
] (mimicking a little child) [He had a hidden gun
] (then back to normal) [ don't care
] Then, one of the bank customers, a  , speaks up
(holding up his passport) This is insane
am a
citizen
You must let me go
Eric looks at him
'm an American
American
'm just here exchanging dollars
If it wasn't for my country you'd all be speaking German
Eric is tired of this outburst, he shoots him
Everyone screams
(to the people) [ have had enough of this nonsense
The next person that speaks will die
] Everyone is quiet
Francois is sitting on the floor bleeding from his arm
[Eric, 'm sorry
Things got out of hand
But we're in control now
] [Good
Let's try to keep it that way
God what a mess
] Eric [What the fuck is it now
You want me to hold your hand as you take a piss
] [ have a question
] [What
] [Do we know if the alarm went off or not
] [Yes
] [We do
] [Yes
It didn't go off
If it had the police would be here and our whole plan would be fucked
But they're not here, and our plan isn't fucked
So if there aren't any more fucking stupid questions 'll go downstairs and see if we're in yet
Is that okay with you
] Claude nods
Then, the phone rings
Everyone looks at it
[ thought the phones were dead
] It rings again
The phones are dead
Eric grabs a   who is crying hysterically and lifts her to her feet
He drags her to the ringing phone
[Answer it
] She is crying too hard
Eric puts his gun to her head
[Answer it or you will die
] She slowly picks up the phone
(answering phone through tears) Banque Internationale de Paris
She pauses, then hands the phone to Eric
[It's for you
] Eric takes the phone and pushes her to the floor
He puts the receiver to his ear
(into phone) [Hello
] (pause) [Who is this
] Eric motions to Oliver to check the windows
Oliver runs over and peeks out the blinds
Oh my God
The police
(into phone) [What do you want
] Eric looks around at the dead bodies
(into phone) [We're all fine in here
] Oliver is pacing back and forth wildly
He starts loading extra ammo into his weapon
(into phone) [No
'll tell you what, you go fuck yourself you fucking pig
You send anyone near this building and 'll kill the first person  lay my hands on
've got plenty hostages here to kill so don't even think of coming in
] (pause) [Just stay put
We'll call you when we're ready
In the mean time, have a nice day
] Eric hangs up the phone, and then leaves it off the hook
[The silent alarm must have gone off after all
] [Shut the fuck up
The alarm didn't do shit
For all we know your idiot shooting brought them here
Anyhow it doesn't matter
Nothing has changed
] [My God
The police
What are we going to do
] [Nothing
We don't have to do anything
The plan stays the same, just slightly different
] Then Eric catches sight of Zoey, their eyes lock
Eric smiles and winks
Then he turns to Jean with a whisper
[If the police decide to come in
kill them
And if you don't mind, stack those bodies somewhere else
This place is a fucking mess and it's bad for morale
] Then he takes off downstairs, smiling
Jean is a little stumped
-    - As Eric walks down the stairs and through the reserve vault area a look of intense concentration washes over his face
You can see that a trillion calculations are being made in his brain
the question is:  are there any answers
: -   - Zed is drilling now with a hand drill
He removes it and blows into the hole
Shavings come out
Eric comes trotting into the antechamber whistling
(turning to Eric) What's going on
Nothing
They were just scaring them
Well, did you tell them to stay quiet
Yes
They're assholes
Just having fun
Zed looks into the hole
He has drilled into the vault door, revealing some wiring
Fucked up my drill bit
It's okay
You can buy another one
Zed takes out a volt meter from his briefcase and inserts the two prongs into the hole
Cross your fingers
Eric does
The volt meter's needle jumps
Perfect
Excellent
What next
We find the fuse box
It'll probably be upstairs
Zed gets up
It's okay
'll find it for you
No
need to see it myself
Zed jumps up and into the storage/elevator area with Eric close behind him
think it would be better if  looked for you
could-- - /  - Instead of walking upstairs, Zed finds the fuse box right in the next room
Hold on
Here she is
Eric is a bit relieved
Zed opens it up
Let's see
He looks through the fuses and then finds the one he wants
Okay, you throw this fuse switch off and then back on when  call to you
Any other switch may set off the alarm
Eric smirks
Oh,  wouldn't want to do that
(serious) Got it
(nodding) Got it
Zed goes back to the vaults
-   - Zed trots back to the Poseidon vault door and quickly grabs a little gizmo from out of his briefcase
It is a little home- made black box with a series of 's on it and two wires coming out of one side with alligator clips on the end
Three other wires are also coming out of it
He slips the alligator clips into the hole and latches them
He then tapes one of the wires to the vault itself
The two remaining wires he hooks up to a large twelve volt battery
Come on sweetie don't fail me now
He looks toward the door leading to the reserve vault area
(calling to Eric) Ready
(
) (calling back) Ready
Zed turns on his little box, the 's start flickering
Now
The lights go out and then back on
There is a whirring sound from the vault door
The 's quickly go from red to green
There is a loud, heavy clicking as the vault door unlocks
Open seasame
Zed smiles and swings the door open revealing the interior of the Poseidon vault
Eric comes running in like a kid on Christmas morning
It worked
He and Zed hug
Oh my God it worked
Zed looks into the Poseidon vault at the passage connecting it to the main vault
It is covered by a small locked cage
can get through that lock in a minute
Then do it
We don't have all day
Zed enters the Poseidon vault
-   - Zed goes to the gated passage which isn't much more than a window in one upper side of the vault, but it's enough to get him into the main vault
Eric is right behind him
Zed takes a twirl at the combination lock
Dime store brand
Three minutes max
Good
Then, there's a gunshot
The bullet comes from the Calibre vault through the window and almost hits Zed
Zed falls backwards onto the floor
Fuck
Merde
Then there's another gunshot
The bullet ricochets through the vault
Jesus Christ
Scrambling on their hands and knees Zed and Eric crawl out of the Poseidon vault
-   - They take cover
Another shot is fired into the vault
Zed and Eric look into the vault
Another security guard
Must be
think  stained my pants
Me too
Oliver comes running in with his gun ready for action
What is it
came down to see how things were going and heard shots
Some asshole in the vault
Oliver takes cover and cocks his gun
We've got guns
Why don't we just storm in and blast his fucking ass
It's three against one
Let's give it the old-- Quiet
'm just trying to be helpful
Just let me think
You don't have to snap at me
Eric peeks into the vault
(calling into the vault) [Hey you
Nice shooting
Play time's over
Why don't you throw out your gun
] #1(
) (calling from main vault) No
Oliver and Eric look at each other and smile
[Come on
We don't want to kill you
] #1(
) [You'll have to
] (quietly to Zed) What is this guys problem
(then to the guard) [Come on
You're making me impatient don't have all day
] #1(
) [Look, don't take it personally
This is my job
] Oliver and Eric look at each other and shrug
Then Eric sees something in Zed's briefcase
It looks like grey clay
[Then take a paid vacation
We won't tell if you won't
] There is a pause
During this time Eric takes the clay and pushes a detonator into it
(quietly) What the Hell are you doing
Have you gone mad
#1(
) [Sorry
can't
] [Well, look, we're going to give you fifteen minutes to change your mind
Okay
] #1(
) [Okay
] Zed starts to grab the plastique away from Eric
Eric resists
(holding his voice down) That's too much
It's dangerous
like danger
(then to the guard) [Changed your mind yet
] Eric creeps into the room and activates the detonator
Zed and Oliver run for cover
#1(
) [No
And 'm not going to
Why don't you just take the money from the other vaults
--] Eric tosses the bar of plastique through the caged window and makes a break for it
There is a huge explosion in the adjoining main vault
The walls quake and a fireball bellows out of the caged window, blowing it open
The vault guard #1 screams and then goes silent
: -  - Francois, Claude, and Jean are forcing customers to drag dead bodies into a cube
The room shakes and everyone looks toward the hall that leads to the stairs
The hostages, whose nerves are already shot, start crying
[Should we see if they're okay
] [No
They're just blasting the vault open
] [What does it matter now
We're fucking surrounded by police
] : -   - Dust has blown out of the vault and is settling on Oliver, Zed, and Eric, who is laughing like a madman
Zed is looking at him like he's crazy
You asshole
You could have killed us all
But  didn't
Let's go check out the damage
Eric gets up and walks into the Poseidon vault
Before Zed follows him he looks at Oliver who doesn't know what to think
-   - Eric laughs
Zed look
He points to the caged window
It's been blown off it's hinges
beat you
opened it in under three minutes
He starts laughing and then crawls through the connecting passage into the Caliber vault
Zed, with his briefcase, follows
(to Oliver) Go around and wait at the main vault door
When  tell you, open it up
Right
When you tell me, 'll open it up
Right
Right
Zed crawls through the opening
'll be at the other vault waiting for you to call to me
- The main vault looks like what a vault would look like if it were blown up from the inside
On the floor is the still smoldering body of the security guard
The room is incredibly smokey
Zed squeezes through the opening
Then, Eric, grinning like a schoolboy, emerges from the smoke with a brick sized bar of pure gold
Look at it
We're all rich
The smoke clears and we see that on the far side of the vault there is a huge platen on wheels with bricks of gold stacked onto it
Eric starts laughing
We're rich
Zed looks at him like he's crazy
We're rich
We're not out of here yet
Yes but we're rich
Zed takes a seat at the vault door
The backside of a vault door looks like an incredibly intricate clock
Zed removes the Plexiglass shielding
'm going to show the others
He squirms out of the entry with the brick of gold
Zed shakes his head and goes to work setting dials and using his voltmeter to test electrical points
: -  - Claude is talking to Jean
[What
You think we may actually get out of this
You're fooling yourself
] [Why are you such a pessimist
] [Are you kidding me
Look at this mess
] Jean surveys the mess, the crying people
[This is nothing
Imagine the police outside
We're dead men
] Eric walks in from the rear stairs
In his hand is a brick of gold
[Jean, Francois, Claude
look at this
] They see the gold
[You did it
You got in
] [Zed is opening the vault now
This is a taste
] Eric holds the bar of gold up for all the people to see
[Look at this and tell me 'm not brilliant
] (crying) [You're a monster
And you'll never leave this place alive
] Eric shoots her with his Uzi
(to the hostages) [None of you are worth half of this single bar
Remember that
] Francois, Jean, and Claude look at each other
[Eric
can  speak with you
] [Of course
] [In private
] [There's no need
have nothing to hide
What is it Claude
] [Well
we're surrounded by the police and we have no way out
What are we going to do
] Eric slaps him across the face
[What are you doing Claude
Talking of all this false doubt
What do you think we're going to do
] Claude is hurt, not physically but emotionally
[ don't know
not the original plan
] [Obviously, since Ricardo fucked us up and didn't kill the concierge fast enough
And killing all these assholes-- (motioning to all the customers) [--isn't going to do us a damn bit of good now, is it
] No
[No
Because we'll need them as hostages when we get on the plane
] [We're going on a plane
] Eric pats his shoulder
[Claude, you are a mental giant
Leave the plans up to me and just kill people if they get out of line, okay
] [Okay
] Eric turns and starts to walk toward the downstairs
['m going to see how things are going
] -     - Eric is whistling while he walks, he pauses to perform a quick magic trick, then he continues
- Eric walks into the reserve vault area
He stops
He hears something
scratching sound
He looks at it's source,  , decked out in black flak jackets and gas masks are starting to come out of a sewer manhole
Eric's eyes widen
He takes his silencer out of his coat and fixes it to his handgun
Then, like a man with intent to kill, he rapidly approaches them
The one who came out of the manhole turns just in time to see Eric fire into his chest
Then, Eric aims the gun into the tight crawlspace and fires into the other man
For safe measure he empties his gun into the tiny causeway
He drops the gun into the hole and then shoves the other policeman into it
He then pushes a large utility wagon over the manhole cover to stop anyone else from coming in
-     - Eric comes running out from the reserve vault area and up the stairs to the lobby
-  - Eric rushes into the lobby
[They want to fuck with me
They want to fuck with me
] He puts the phone on the hook
It instantly rings
He answers the phone
[You want to fuck with me
'll show you what happens to people who fuck with me
] He throws the phone to the ground and looks at Zoey
[The moment of truth my love
You knew it would come
] He grabs Zoey and lifts her to her feet
(screeching) No
Then, the assistant manager stops him
[No
What ever it is you're going to do have mercy
] Eric suddenly calms down
[Have mercy
] [Yes
] [With her
] [Yes
] [That's sweet
] (to Zoey) [You have quite a reach my lovely
Is he one of your clients
] He pushes Zoey to the ground
[It's a deal
] [Thank you
] [Don't mention it
] He grabs the assistant manager and at gunpoint forces him to the main entrance
[Eric
What are you doing
] [Clearing up the "how full of shit am " question the cops are asking themselves right now
] The assistant manager is putting up a bit of a struggle but Eric simply forces him along
Everyone waits until suddenly they hear a burst of gunfire from outside
They all scream
Eric walks back into the bank, he picks up the phone
(into phone) [Hello
] (pause) [Yes
'll hold
] (then to Claude) ['m holding
] After a little bit of a wait someone comes on the other end of the line
(into phone) [Hello
] (pause) [You don't know the fucking half of it
So just shut the fuck up and listen
Try any more stunts and 'll fucking really go crazy
] (pause) [Well that's good because if you faggot cops even think of it 'll kill some more people
Hear
] (pause) [No
None of that
We won't trade
That never works
Not in the movies, not in real life
Understand
We're going to get into our van, with a couple of people, go to the airport, and fly out of this shit hole city
And you're not going to follow us
] (pause) [Who do you fucking think is going to supply the plane
Us
No, you fucking imbecile, the French taxpayers would be a good second guess for you
You're really pissing me off
You think 'm a fucking amature
] He covers the mouth piece
(to Claude) [ fucking hate cops
] : -   - Zed is sweating as he works away at the back of the door
He glances over what he's done and makes a calculation on a calculator
Then, there is a groaning sound
Zed, terrified, spins around
Another groaning sound
The vault security guard isn't dead
His body is charred and he's not moving but he's very much alive
#1 ['m going to die
] Zed can't believe what he's seeing
He moves over to the body, leaving his work behind
#1 ['m going to die
please hold my
hand
don't
want to die
alone
] Zed hovers over the body, afraid to touch it
He gives it a nudge with his foot
The body groans and then exhales the longest exhale ever
Zed kneels down next to the body
Are you still there
Nothing
Zed puts his hand to the neck of the vault guard #1 and checks for a pulse
Nothing
Zed sits there for a moment looking at the corpse, then, like he wants to get out of there as soon as possible, he scrambles to the door and starts adjusting several switches
He has wired a battery to two leads
He takes out a wire cutter and snips a wire
There is a sudden barrage of whirring and clicking sounds as the vault unlocks
Zed calls to Oliver from the passage
- /  - Oliver is staring at the dead bodies of the manager and sub lobby teller
(
) (distant, calling from the vault) Oliver, now
Open the vault
Oliver turns the large wheel and opens the Caliber vault door
With some amount of energy the door opens
Standing inside is Zed
Open seasame
He steps out of the vault
Do you want to give me a hand
Sure
Oliver puts his gun down and they go into the Calibre vault
-   - Oliver sees the huge platen of gold bricks
Zed puts his steel briefcase on top of it
Holy mother
Here, help me with this
: -  - Eric slams the phone down and then in a fit of rage tears the phone from the wall
Merde
He grabs his machine gun and aims it at the sub lobby guard #2
The sub lobby guard #2 braces himself for gunfire
Eric fires into him
He is dead instantly
Everybody screams
Eric fires into his dead corpse until his gun runs out of bullets
[That's what you get
] Claude puts his hand on Eric's shoulder
Eric
Eric looks at him
[The fucking police won't budge
kill a man and they don't care
They say they don't make deals with terrorists
It really fucks up my plan
] [And what if we gave up
] Eric can't believe this
(laughing) [Claude, look around you
We're not talking prison here
You know
The cops will give in
You start killing women
they give in
They're all so fucking much in love with women
] Then he looks at Zoey
[What are you looking at you fucking whore
] She doesn't want to say a thing that'll upset him
[Are you afraid 'll tell these people that this is only a day job for you
] She shakes her head "no"
[What
So they know that you're a--] The sub lobby assistant speaks up
[Leave her alone
] Eric cracks the butt of his gun into the man's face
[Shut up
] He clicks another clip into the Uzi and grabs Zoey by the collar and lifts her to her feet
[My only mistake was not to make an example of a woman to begin with
] : -   - Zed takes the dolly and starts wheeling the platen of gold out
Oliver helps him
This is unbelievable
Look at all of this
It's wonderful to touch
Just help me steer this out
They maneuver out of the Calibre vault
- /  - They come out of the Calibre vault with the huge platen
Do you think we should get some cash also
What for
Well, you never know
They start maneuvering the platen toward an elevator
Money is too easily traceable
You'd never be able to spend it
And forget about exchanging it
That's true
No sir
Your best bet is to get these bars melted down in Tunisia or Korea
Eric knows someone in Portugal
Or Portugal
They get into the banks private freight elevator
-   - Zed closes the door and pushes the button to go up to the ground floor
: -  - Eric is dragging Zoey by the hair toward the door when she grabs his groin and starts squeezing
Eric lets out a shrill scream and whacks the butt of the Uzi into her face
But she won't let go
Her years as a prostitute have taught her to ignore pain
She grabs hold of the gun hand
(groaning) [You fucking bitch
] few bursts of the Uzi go off and one shell stitches Eric's foot red
Eric lets go and falls to the ground
Claude, Jean, and Francois suddenly become attentive to what's going on
Zoey starts firing the Uzi but can't control it
She showers the room with bullets
She starts to run toward the back office blindly firing the gun in the direction of Claude, Eric, Francois, Jean, and the other hostages
Then, a tear gas cannister break through the top windows and start clouding the place up
Eric whips out his switch blade and hops on his bloody red foot
[Bitch
] : -   - Zed is waiting for the elevator to arrive
Do we have a covering of some kind
what
You know
Something to cover this with
It'll look kind of conspicuous leaving the bank with a platten of gold
Oh, it won't matter
The police know what we're up too
Police
What do you mean they know what we're up too
You don't know
We've been discovered
But Eric has them under control
Zed is frantic
No  didn't know
How many police
The building is surrounded
The elevator doors open onto the ground floor to the sound of automatic gunfire
Zed walks out into the back office
-   - Suddenly, from the back office, Zed sees Zoey blasting away an Uzi and running toward the rear stairwell
Eric is in the lobby limping around
The other gang members are ducking from her fire
Then, her clip runs out
She sees Zed, their eyes lock
An  overcomes Zed
She runs down the stairs to the back
Kill her
Kill her
Oliver aims his gun to fire and Zed pushes it up
Oliver's gun discharges into the ceiling
Oliver and Zed begin to struggle
-  - Zed and Oliver collapse out of the back office and into the lobby
They tumble onto the floor
Eric hobbles over to them, his gun aimed at Zed
What the fuck are you doing
: -    - Zoe is near tears
She drops the empty machine gun to the floor and starts walking toward the sub lobby
: -  - Eric leans down to talk to Zed
Oliver and Jean are watching
Francois and Claude are more worried about the tear gas
[They're trying to smoke us out Eric
] [What do we do
] Eric waves them off with a brush of his hand
He's concentrating on Zed
Do you really love your bitch whore girlfriend that much
She's really fucked with your mind
Eric
what are you talking about
Eric lifts him to his feet and holds him up against the knife
He turns him toward the smoke and whispers into his ear
Look at it
It's all for us
The smoke
The attention
They have no idea of who they're dealing with
They have no idea what kind of men we are
(thinking Eric is a madman) What kind of men are we
Eric looks at him and gives him a soft kiss on the cheek
You can no longer be in our club
You forfeit your cut of the pie
Zed laughs, there's not gonna be much of a pie to eat
What about our friendship
Shit Zed
haven't seen you in years
You hardly know me
He slashes Zed across the face with the switchblade
Zed falls backwards and tumbles down the stairs like a rag doll
Never let a girl come between two men
He walks down the hall toward the gold
Now let's try to get out of here
Eric walks into the back office
The others look at each other
Suddenly a black figure runs across the bank behind the shadows, Francois sees it and nervously fires
In the background the distinctive sound of European police sirens wail as more cars pull up to the outside of the bank
Also, an   is blaring orders over a bullhorn
[The police
They're entering the building
] Suddenly all of them start firing like blindly into the smoke
Francois runs back to Eric who has walked up to the elevator via the back office
-   - Eric caresses his hand across the bars of gold
(to himself) [Smoother and more giving than the most selfless human being
You're beautiful
] Francois runs in
[Eric
] [Jesus, what now
] [The police are coming in
We're doomed
] [Get a hostage
] (frantic) [They don't give a fuck about the hostages
] : -  - Jean becomes a berzerker and runs out into a cloud of smoke and throws the tear gas container into the thick cloud
Then he turns to the police and holds his own gun to his head
[Don't make me
] single bullet passes through his torso
As Jean falls to the ground he lets loose a round of gunfire into the ceiling
Oliver is still firing, his face is red like a crazed man
From behind the counter the sub lobby assistant grabs a hold of Claude and wrestles him to the ground
The other customers start to flee for cover
Oliver sees the fracas between the sub lobby assistant and Claude
It looks like the sub lobby assistant is getting the upper hand
Oliver swings his gun around and sprays machine gun fire at them
killing them both
: -   - Zoe walks up the stairs out, not only are they locked but a cloud of tear gas is pouring into the downstairs sub lobby
Suddenly, Zed stumbles in
Zed is like a zombie
Then he notices Zoe in the stairwell
They lock eyes
(almost delerious) Zoe
She steps down into the sub lobby, machine guns crackle in the background
She runs up to him just as he slumps to the ground
(holding him) My Zed
They've hurt you
She dabs a cloth to his cut face
He holds it on
(trying to comfort him) You're going to be okay
In many countries scars on the face are a symbol of heroism
To proudly display a flaw like a badge
is to wear a badge of truth
He takes her hand
Be serious Zoe
can stick my tongue through my cheek
: -  - The police are now laying it on heavy
Francois comes out of the office
Oliver
Let's get a hostage
This is the end
Francois is ripped into by machine gun fire
Oliver races past him
: -   - Tear gas is starting to fill the room
Zoe stands Zed up
Listen to me
We're going to lock ourselves into one of the air tight vaults
if any of them are still open
They start walking toward the reserve vault area
: -   - Eric hops into the elevator and closes the door, just as Oliver runs up, firing toward the police
Eric is laughing manically as he leaves them behind
Bastard
Oliver turns to where the police will surely be coming in
: -    - Zoey and Zed rush into the reserve vault area
Zoey notices that the downstairs reserve vault is closed
Merde
The vault has been closed
What about the others
The gunfire upstairs has subsided and has been replaced by unintelligible
Listen
there's no gunfire
Zoey quietly opens the door opposite the vault that leads to the rear stairs to the lobby level
-     - Zoey peeks up the stairs just in time to see Oliver bolt for the stairs
(to police) Motherfuckers
volly of gunfire rips into Oliver but he stands his ground and fires into the police
You wanna fuck with me
You wanna fuck with me
'll show you who you're fucking with
He starts blasting away
Terrified, Zoey leads Zed to the storage/elevator area
'mon, we'll be safer in here
: - /  - The elevator door opens, Eric steps out and looks around like a caged animal
[Think
] Then, Zed and Zoey appear from the hall to the reserve vault area
Eric turns to them with his gun raised, when he sees them he lowers it
Zed
They all stand there for a moment, the gunfire cracking away upstairs
Eric is more casual than he should be
(matter-of-factly) What's your girlfriends name
Zoe
Zoe
(to Zoey in French) [Zoe, come here to me
] Zoey spits at him
Eric laughs and aims the gun at her
[Killing you would just be gravy, so don't fuck with me
] [Go ahead you slob
Shave my ass
] Eric smashes the side of her face with the gun and then grabs a hold of her arm
Zed tries to stop Eric but Eric aims the gun at him
Zed no
'll kill you
It means nothing to me, our friendship
(starting out calm and then building to a scream) Eric
there's no fucking way out of here
Oh but you're wrong
This is my way out
This dime store couge with her motor driven ass
You find your own
Zed rushes Eric and Zoey starts scratching
Eric drops the gun but quickly whips out his knife
She tries to get away from Eric but he has a hold on her shirt
Eric swipes at her with the knife and grazes he back
Then Eric slashes toward Zed who jumps back
Zoey falls to the floor
Come Zed
'm going to cut you like a sausage
Zed is standing between Zoey and Eric
Zoey, get out of here
She scrambles away
He swipes at Zed
Zed jumps back down the hall toward the reserve vault area
-   - They rush out toward the stairs
Did you see how she ran
Did you see how she ran
She doesn't care about you
Fucking pussy only cares about pussy
Look out for number one
What do you say Zed
He swipes again
will kill you
And once  kill you Zed, 'll get out of here
'll fuck your bitch up the ass and give her if she doesn't already have it
What do you say to that Zed
He swipes and Zed grabs a hold of the knife by the blade
Eric pulls it free and the knife falls to the floor
Zed takes this opportunity and kicks Eric in the face
Eric reaches for the knife
Zed, his hand bloody, dives onto Eric
Zoey also jumps onto them and starts yanking on Eric's hair
She plunges her nails into his face
Fucking bitch
Zed is rabbit punching Eric from underneath
Then, Eric grabs a hold of Zed's balls and squeezes
Zed lets out a shrill scream
Eric starts elbowing Zoey in the face
The three of them lay there on the floor wriggling like worms, unable to move because each is putting the other through such agony
Then, Oliver, shot up and bloody haplessly stumbles into the room
His body is a mass of bullet wounds
Ox
Where is thy yoke
He clumsily falls dead to the ground, his shotgun slides near Zoey, Zed, and Eric
The sight of the gun gives Eric the strength only a madman could posses
He rolls over and throws Zoey off him
Then, he smashes his forehead into Zed's nose, bursting it
Eric, deftly, rolls over and grabs the gun
He gets to his feet and cocks the pump action
Fuck both of you
Then he notices the lack of gunfire upstairs
Eric turns back to them
Au revoir
He aims to kill Zed
No
Then, all of the French policemen, decked out in their assault gear and wearing gas masks, storm down the stairs
At the sight of Eric about to execute Zed they raise their guns
#1 [Stop
] Eric stops
It becomes quiet
Then, Eric looks back down at Zed and braces for the shotgun kick
give you little kiss
Ciao
He squeezes the trigger and
The police open fire with their French made assault machine guns and fill Eric with bullets
Instead of falling he does a scarecrow dance as his body is painted red
The wall behind them explodes as plaster sprays all over Zed
An  overcomes Eric
Eric's dead body slumps to it's knees and flops on top of Zed
Zed pushes the body off and tries to drag himself to Zoey
Zoey runs up to him and holds him
The police all charge into the secondary vault area and secure the downstairs
Zoey is crying as she holds Zed
The police have their guns aimed at the two of them
Zoey looks up
(to the policemen) [ work here
This man is a customer
he needs medical help
] They take their guns away and kneel next to him, seeing if he's okay
#2 [How bad do you think his wounds are
] The other policeman, unable to tell because of Eric's blood, simply shakes his head
#1 (to Zoey) [Are you alright
] Zoey starts to cry
: -  - Zoey and Zed, bandaged up, are being aided by all of the French policemen as they walk through the bank
Smoke is still clearing, but the bodies of customers and bank robbers alike litter the area
's, wearing all white, try to help the injured, they assist Zed and Zoey
#1 (to Zoey and Zed) [There's an ambulance outside
] (he looks around) [My God
What a Bastille Day
] Zed's attention is caught by two   carrying a body bag
#3 (to French policeman #1) [This one's the ringmaster
We need an ] No longer interested in Zoey or Zed, he goes to check out the body
The hospital
No
Come on
have a car
Zoey puts her arm around Zed and helps him out of the bank
never to return
: '  -  - Zoey is driving
Zed looks like he's been in a burning building
'm so tired
We'll go to my flat
You can rest there
Do you feel pain
No
it was mostly his blood
have a shower
You can clean up there
Thank you Zoe
He looks at her
My name is not Zoe
Not any more
He looks forward at the streets of Paris
You'll get well
Then 'll show you the real Paris
They drive away
