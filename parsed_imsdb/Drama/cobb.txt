( , ) -  (1960)          1 The room is California Spanish, thick walls, arches, and light spills in from a mission window
But we don't have any sense of place just yet
At first there are just details
of an old Underwood upright, well-worn and ancient woman's fingertips with red nail polish are placed on the keys
They wiggle
Smoke curls

Overflowing with crunched-up paper

He stands up suddenly and looks out the window

He's staring at something

She glances up toward Stump, then quickly turns away and disappears
He sighs, and turns
The muse has   not descended, Lucille

The muse has not descended
Yes
The muse has left me stranded here like a beached whale -- only one phrase, one word, from finishing the greatest essay 've ever written
One word, the right word -- Flaubert called it 'le mot juste' -- ever tell you that
Lucille is a longsuffering saint
'Le mot juste' -- the exact right word the writer needs to tell his story
Yessir, you've mentioned it
Hemingway, Faulkner, Joyce -- they all searched for 'le mot juste' until they cried, until they bled
Yessir
What is this essay about again
Fishing
mean what is it really about
You said it was about the quote unquote primal issues of survival, man against nature, etcetera -- that's what you said
Ohyeah
so
we end the essay with

Shimmering tarpon -- very good, Mr
Stump

The   -- Lucille answers it
Yes
Yes
Just a minute, 'll see if he's available
(covers phone) It's your wife -- are you and she speaking again
Stump's cavalier attitude stops cold
He starts to reach for the phone, then stops
dunno
How does she sound
Don't ask me to interpret
Stump is suddenly a nervous wreck
He hesitates
Tell her
tell her
'll talk
no
tell her 'm out -- 'll call her later

Stump -- 'll have him call you back
She hangs up
The mood has shifted
need a drink
What about 'le mot juste,' Mr
Stump
(snaps) Fuck 'le mot juste,' Lucille
Finish the damn thing yourself
'The primeval moment is frozen in' whatever the hell you want it to be
Did you know that James Joyce let his secretary -- none other than Samuel Beckett -- revise and edit Molly's solliloquy in Ulysses
You're my Beckett -- give you 'le mot juste
' Just get the damn thing in the mail so  can get paid

Problems with the Mrs

Our man hops off his pogo stick -- nobody even notices, and joins his cronies, five sportswriters full of dogmatic opinions on every subject known to man
, a sportswriter, is at the jukebox feeding quarters
He looks up routinely, they're all regulars here
Hey, Stumpy
Stump addresses the sportswriters at the table as if they were a small audience in a lounge
Awright, awright
how do you get five old ladies to say 'fuck
' (stumped) Jeez,  dunno, how
Etc
Yell 'bingo
' Stump laughs
The others groan
, 40's, black, speaks up
He's one of the regulars
Okay,  got one -- (beat) drunk is taking a piss in front of a bar, a bus drives by, real fast right along the curb, and knocks his thing off
Drunk picks up his thing, puts it in his pocket, goes into a bar, reaches into his pocket and puts his thing on the bar

'There,' he says, 'bus knocked my thing off
' Bartender says, 'you're drunk and that ain't your thing either
That's another cigar butt
' (beat) Drunk looks down at both cigar butts and back up at the bartender and says, 'God damn it, mushta smoked my dick
' Everyone roars, even Stump
But Frank, as usual, is hyper serious and never quite gets into the revelry
Amidst this levity, gentlemen, have some real concerns
Mark my words, people will look back on this year and say that 1960 was the year that Western Civilization began its downward trajectory
You need to get laid, Frank
Guys, guys, c'mon
do you really think things are as good as they used to be
You think Jack Kennedy is qualified to be President
Kennedy may not be qualified, but -- Jackie's a babe -- and that's good enough for me
They're a happily married couple and that oughta stand for something these days
Every man nods in solemn agreement
Speaking of being happily married, Al, are you and your old lady still having problems

Good to hear
awright
way to go, Stumpy
(Etc
) mean look at us -- we call ourselves writers but we just watch ballgames and get drunk a lot
You call that writing
Yes  do
In the department store of life, sports is the toy department -- so what
Yeah, besides, Alan here's writing a serious novel, aren't ya
Yeah, well  haven't started yet but 'm gonna
've been busy
You guys are pathetic
Ya write for one reason -- a paycheck
More art was created for money than for passion
Take your platitudes and shove 'em, Frank
'm gonna write a novel too, someday
(cynically) The Great American Novel, suppose
It could come from my pen
You're a barbershop writer, Al -- you write sugar-coated pieces for guys to skim when they're waiting for a haircut

Let's go
Settle this right here
Stump raises his fists as if to fight; Frank responds
Hey
scuffle breaks out, a lot of posturing, feinting, but they're all too chicken to do anything
Nobody wants to fight
at the bar
The bartender answers the phone, shouts at the obnoxious sportwriters
Stump
For you
Stump goes to the phone, interrupting his own "fight
" (to Frank) Phone call saved your ass
Stump grabs the phone, covering an ear to hear better
(on phone) Yeah
yeah
who
no
you're kidding
when
Stump hangs up the phone and turns
His face registers shock, or more precisely, bewilderment and wonder
Hey
(as they ignore him) Shut up
They do, and give Stump their ruffled attention
Cobb wants to see me
Cobb who
Ty Cobb
How many Cobbs are there
This news instantly sobers the room

thought he was dead
Not yet
He said he wants to tell me the real story of his life before he croaks
You were just talking to Ty Cobb
The Georgia Peach himself
This impresses the hell out of everyone in the room
Even Stump is still a little dazed
They say Cobb is crazy
The meanest sonofabitch who ever lived
heard he killed a man
Maybe so, but -- he was the greatest baseball player of them all
Yeah, the best, no one close, etc
Frank suddenly is cautionary, concerned, paternal
Listen, Al, be careful -- ain't gettin' my ass shot, don't worry
No, not that -- the story
(beat) This is like Ivan the Terrible inviting somebody into the Czar's palace before he died
Except Ivan was a nicer guy

This is your shot
This is all our shot
(as cronies agree) When does he want to see you
Immediately

(

Onscreen (&) -- Cobb in action -- His demon fury gives way to the fierce joy of his playing
He slashes a ball up the alley, turns first and never hesitates at second, and as the relay comes into third -- (

perhaps of any time

We begin hearing his voice, then see him inside the car driving

(
) Driving into the Sierras at night with winter coming on wasn't the smartest decision 'd ever made but it seemed better than being late for my first meeting with Cobb
First drops of rain begin hitting the windshield -- Stump hits the wiper button and the floppy blades begin ineffectively wiping the windshield
Stump struggles with his vision
Shit
dismal, wet and obscured view of the mountain road, climbing higher into the Sierras
small roadside gas station comes  , and -- Stump pulls his car into the station

It's cold, and a man comes out, the gas station owner, , 55
The man services the car throughout the conversation
Fill it up and replace the wiper blades
You got it
Colder than a witch's tit, eh
It's just starting
We got three- four feet of snow another thousand feet up

Cobb
He stopped here for gas once,  asked him for an autograph for my boy and he told me to shove it where the sun don't shine
hear he's got a way with kids
Stump heads to a pay phone as the attendant replaces the wiper blades
Stump's breath hangs heavy in the air
It's cold
Freezing
He drops a set of coins in the call box
He blows on his hands and pulls up his collar -- he wasn't prepared for the weather to be this cold
He comes to life when he hears a voice on the other end -- a voice we never hear
Hey, baby, it's me
(beat) Al
your husband
(beat) 'm up in the woods somewhere on assignment
(beat) Listen, sweetheart, listen -- nobody can love you the way love you and  want you to take me back

(
) confess  was looking forward to seeing Cobb and being near his brilliance
My own life seemed on hold, somehow
Everyday churning out the same old articles, drinking at 4 in the afternoon with the same old guys, the same old excuses for not writing a novel, the same old confused marriages that we all needed and were trying to get out of at the same time
Cobb was a god whose brilliance, however difficult, could rub off on me
His problems were different than mine

row of mailboxes catches Stump's attention, and he pulls over to review the names with a flashlight
He lights his way across the names of a dozen boxes -- nothing, until: The last box, enormously oversized, bears the name "
" He smiles
Perfect
His car heads up a mountain road a final hundred yards, comes around a bend in the trees and there it is -- 15

: 15
-                                  15 Stump parks and approaches somewhat warily
The sound of   and  voices
Stump hurries to the door to escape the rain and finds refuge under the eave
The noise is frightening from that close
He stands unsurely -- does he knock
When -- The door is thrown open -- a black man, , 40, with a suitcase stands wildly upset, screaming back into the house
Fuck you, Mr
Cobb,  have too much dignity to spend another moment with you
hope you die before the sun comes up and may you rot in hell
The man whirls and is shocked to see Stump standing there with his own suitcase
Who are you
'm a writer
You mean he actually found somebody to take the job
Willie bursts out into crazed laughter, as if the world of Cobb was finally too absurd
Cobb and a writer
In this weather
In any weather
And the man walks through the rain, laughing, heading on foot down off the mountain as Stump just stares
Stump turns and steps into the open doorway
: 16

-                                     16 Stump in the front door -- The place is enormous and barely lit
Taxidermied game hangs on the wall
Stump is terrified
is sitting in an overstuffed chair reading a news- paper
Dressed in a business suit and tie, he seems oblivious to the surrounding chaos
He also seems out of place
Mr
Cobb
The man looks at Stump and points upstairs without speaking
More  sounds from upstairs
Mr
Cobb
The silence is shattered by a , then from upstairs
suggests a record is playing

He hesitates
Hello
Mr
Cobb
-- Ripping through the door
Stump is terrified -- he gasps for air
Thank you very much, Mr
Cobb, but  don't need this job that bad
Stump turns and creeps back toward the stairs, but -- --  a hanging
Stump freeses one more time
Silence
Then the voice -- Yes, Mr
Stump -- you do need this job that bad

(calmly) won't hurt you
Stump breathes deeply and steps into the doorway -- He does it as if there's no choice, accepting his fate
And sees: 18     -                                                18 Lying in bed in a robe
Unshaven
Bottles of booze and food everywhere
And bottles of pills sit on every surface
Two hunting dogs sit on the bed with him
small record player sits next to he bed
record spins, filling the room with
He places the gun on      his night table, knocking pills and bottles to the floor      with a crash he barely notices
When he speaks it is      without a snarl, without threat -- simply, even sweetly,      he says: On the violin -- Fritz Kreisler
'm a great admirer of his
'm also a great admirer of yours
Thank you
But you are a hopeless romantic and only a moderate success
Sir,  am the most successful sportswriter in America and not merely a 'moderate success

Cobb washes down a handful of pills with a bottle of Scotch
Momentarily revitalized, Cobb hands Stump a folded letter which Stump opens to read
That's an invitation to a testimonial dinner at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York
You're taking me there -- when is it
(looking at the letter) few weeks
All the great ones will be there -- The great Mickey Cochrane will be there
Hornsby, Sisler, Ott, the Waner Brothers
we used to have some parties, Stump, 'll tell ya that right now
(beat) We can't forget
won't forget
Look at me closely, Al
(with utmost sincerity) Lie after lie has been written about me -- my whole life 've been misunderstood
(beat) You're gonna tell the real story of Ty Cobb
What's the 'real' story
Cobb climbs slowly out of bed
His words are reasoned and not without passion
That's why you're here
(beat) See, there's two kinds of writers
The kind that spin endless yarns about small subjects
that's you

there's the kind with one great subject that consumes them forever
(beat) That could be you
Because  am that subject
Cobb hobbles to a table in front of a window
The table is covered with pills, bottles, needles, and booze
(suddenly bellowing) Jameson
Get your ass up here
Cobb grabs another bottle of booze and swigs deeply, liquor spilling over him
Then, suddenly, he holds up his hand
calm comes over him as -- He stares out the window into the snowy woods
His rage has quickly turned into a quiet, intense, unsettling focus
You okay
Mmmmmm

And utter calm
Jameson, the man in the suit, arrives and stands in the back of the room
He takes notes when Cobb speaks

Cobb continues staring out the window at the buck

(beat) want you to buy all the stock you can
Honolulu Oil
Getty is expanding in the west, looking for companies like that
got a hunch
(beat) Stumpy, c'mere
Cobb picks up the revolver and holds it lovingly
Stump crosses and stands behind Cobb, sharing the view
can take that buck
What'ya think
With a pistol
No way
Cobb smiles and loads the revolver
He pushes the window which swings slowly open
21     -                                          21 searches for leaves to eat in the snow
Serene
Unaware
(to Jameson) There's a board meeting of Coca-Cola in Georgia next week
Call them up and tell them  can't make it for medical -- (correcting himself) -- personal -- reasons

The gun shakes
Then steadies
Stump stands over his shoulder watching the bizarre action

The   with a violent kick
The buck spins and runs back into the woods, kicking snow and disappearing in the brush

Like hell you did
Right behind the ear
You're full of shit
Jameson
If Mr
Cobb said he got him, then he got him
You have no vision, Stump writer without vision is a waste of my time
think  picked the wrong man
Cobb stumbles back into bed, somewhat exhausted by the ordeal
And  think  better get back to San Francisco before the storm hits
'll take care of these transactions, Mr
Cobb
And Jameson exits the room

24   :                                                    24 And 'll be leaving as well, sir, since you think 'm the wrong man for the job
Shut up, Stump -- we both know that 'm your meal ticket
(beat) We need each other
(smiles) And we start in the morning
No
(calmly) Yes
Cobb reaches over and defiantly turns  the  so that the room is overwhelmed with Kreisler's violin
Stump stares back at this decrepit, overpowering figure
Cobb gradually slips into sleep, buried in the music, the booze, the pills, the pain

Cobb mixes a bourbon with orange juice to wash down some more pills, which he takes randomly
teletype  sits on a table nearby -- Throughout the scene, a tape  endlessly out, piling on the floor
Cobb occasionally checks data on the tape

Cobb
Chapter one, Page one
'm ready
'Know ye that a prince and a great man has fallen this day
' Stump types it out, then stops
What the hell is that
That's what Robert
Lee said at the burial of my grandfather who was a Confederate General killed at Fredricksburg
So 'm taking notes
Hell no
That's the first line of my autobiography
ain't writing it
Why not
It's horseshit
It's a third person comment about someone who's already dead
An autobiography has to be in the first person -- plus it can't come from the other side of the God damn grave
My story can come from any damn place  want
Not to mention you can't call yourself 'a prince and great man' -- that's for the world to decide
() 24
26   :     (2)                                             26 What kind of a fucking writer you call yourself -- all tied up in rules and regulations
What's the point being a writer if you can't say what you want to
You're not treating me like a writer -- you're treating me like a stenographer
-- Stump types quickly, hunting and pecking with two fingers, reading aloud
Know ye that a prince and a great man has fallen this day
It has a certain ring to it
Yes it does
thought you might like it
It's yours, a gift from me
(beat) 'Cobb, a prince among men, misunderstood in his genius, as genius always is' - (demands from Stump) This is the second line from what will be the greatest biography of a great man ever written -- type it
Cobb checks the tape and suddenly is deep in thought over some information coming across
Stump types
Bethlehem Steel's about to dive
Cobb grabs a phone and dials -- Then barks into the phone
(on phone) Jameson
Bethlehem's going in the toilet

Yeah
buy Coca-Cola
We're about to go out in cans
Coke in cans
don't think so
Cobb just stares back in disdain
Then, suddenly -- Cobb starts coughing terribly
He clutches his torso as if it were about to fall into pieces
You know what's wrong with Ty Cobb
What
(proudly) Every disease known to man -- got 'em all
And they'll never get me in a hospital -- never
(beat) My heart leaks -- the doctors who are nothin' but a buncha hacksaw artists give me Digoxin to keep it pumping
Cobb grabs a bottle of Digoxin pills and flings it across the room in a rage
He flings bottles of pills as he recites his ailments
They give me Darvon for the cancer in my back, they give me Tace for something eatin' up my stomach, Fleets Compound for an infection in my bowels, Librium for my tension, insulin for my diabetes
Cobb grabs a hypodermic needle and awkwardly pours from a bottle into the chamber
Insulin spills as he does
Fuckin' insulin
He jams the needle wildly into his arm without hesitation

Ernie
Ernie who
(his face drops) My God
(to Cobb) It's Ernest Hemingway
for you
Tell him to go to hell
Stump covers the receiver nervously
Jesus  Christ, Ty, this is the great  American writer -- this is the  man who inspired me to become  a writer
Tell him to go to hell anyway
Why
Him and me used to be pals but we went on a hunting trip once and he hired a shitty guide

You didn't like a guide he hired
Cobb looks at Stump with a fierceness that is so over- whelming, so physical, that Stump melts
You tell him to go fuck himself or 'll kick your Yankee ass
Stump is terrified
He reluctantly uncovers the receiver
Mr
Hemingway
Mr
Cobb says
to go to hell
(awkwardly) By the way 'm a big fan of yours -- , a hang up
Cobb settles into a chair, letting the drugs and pills and booze work their way into his thick body
Hemingway isn't a bullfighter -- he wrote about bullfighting
What the hell is that
(beat) Bullshit
Damn painkillers
Cobb rubs his head -- The drugs are taking effect
Ty, you okay
It'll pass
(increasingly woozy) Stumpy, listen to me -- you know what  need
What do you need
need a woman

Stump stares at the sleeping volcano of a man, and when Cobb starts snoring heavily, he rises, pulls on a coat, scarf, and hat, and heads out the door
: 27
-                                             27 Snow flurries greet Stump as he heads outside, and darkness is falling
He takes a deep breath
(
) couldn't be around the man for long without needing a break, which his painkillers gracefully provided
(beat) My sanity would soon depend upon a frequent breath of fresh air, a walk in the woods -- any escape from what one sportswriter had called 'Cobb's brooding soul that bubbled with violence
' Stump lights a pipe as he walks up a trail, away from the lodge, toward a ridge, all covered with snow
The flurries of snow are getting thicker now
(
) knew most of the Cobb stories -- first man elected to the Hall of Fame, ahead of the incomparable Babe Ruth
Statistics that haven't been approached in three-quarters of a century
Stump stops at the ridge and looks down at the partially frozen Lake Tahoe in the lingering light
(
) But 'd known boxing champions and football players -- they were gentle souls outside the arena
(beat) How much of Cobb was an act, a lifetime of theatrical intimidation to preserve his own legend

Tough guys are tougher, women more beautiful, routine acts of self-preservation become heroic
Stump continues walking down a crest of snow, through a stand of snow-covered pines
The light is dark, purple, eerie, and Stump is lost in thought, until, suddenly, he sees: trail of blood in the snow
He follows it down a slope, past a tree, growing deeper, thicker
And there it is -- The buck lies dead in the snow in a pool of blood
Stump stops in fear, then approaches, leans down and examines -- My God
The buck's head has a hole blasted behind the ear
Stump rises quickly to his feet and looks around
The woods are silent
Snow falls from a branch
And
He hurries back through the woods up the ridge, momen- tarily lost as the snow swirls, he finally spots the lodge
: 28
-                                              28 Stump bursts into the lodge as the brewing storm blows in
Cobb is standing there in a hunting jacket, high laced boots, a hat, with a suitcase
He holds a paper bag wrapped in twine

He keeps checking his rearview mirror
Cobb at the wheel of a huge, black, Chrysler Imperial
He looks possessed

He keeps glancing at Cobb who continues screaming
Get off the road -- ya can't drive any faster
Move it
Stump is caught between fear and rage
Fuck you

'  -                                        34 Cobb's eyes flare -- The  roars, the blizzard beats against the windshield

Cobb steps on the gas -- His car pulls out into the oncoming lane and accelerates to pass
35
-                               35 Cobb's car passes Stump's car down the steep grade
Insane, impossible, suicidal -- not another car on the road, the highway closed, barely visible
and here comes Cobb
Stump stares in disbelief as he clings to the wheel

struggles to see through the windshield -- snow is swirling everywhere
' Cobb's car disappears into the blizzard, fishtailing as it goes
Jesus

39 Stump's car creeps along the edge of a deep ravine that plunges to a raging, icy river
The car fishtails, straightens, and continues on, slowly groping down the mountain
40                                                    40 Sheer terror
It takes his full powers of concentration to keep the car on the road

41 His car lights reveal tire tracks in the snowdrifts on the highway
The tracks skid wildly, clearly out of control, and head straight off the road
42                                                   42 Stump stops his car and gets out -- He hurries to the edge of the road where the bank drops away quickly
- ' lies nose down at the bottom of a snow-filled ravine, thirty feet away
The tail lights are still on
The car is totalled
Cobb
Stump plows his way on foot down the embankment, fighting bad footing and snowdrifts, until -- He arrives at the car -- Surely nobody could survive this
With difficulty, he makes his way to the back door of the huge car and wrestles it open
Stump sticks the top half of his body into the car
Cobb
Cobb lies upside down, ass in the air, his face buried under the dash of the car
There's blood on his face
It's about fucking time you got here
You've alive
Cobb struggles to right himself, twisting and turning free

Help me outta here
Stump helps Cobb back out of the car
It is an awkward, clumsy, difficult task
There's blood
Of course there's blood
just put my head through the windshield of a car, what the hell ya think, ya big fucking jerk
Shut up
Ty Cobb can't die like this
They'll bury me and nobody'll know who it is
said shut up
Stump drags Cobb awkwardly through the snowbank back up to the highway
When they get to the edge of the high- way, Cobb stops to stare at the tire tracks leaving the road
Look't that
No guard rail
'm suing the State Highway Commission, 'm suing the Governor, 'm suing every God damn body

God damn it, shut up and get in the car
The blizzard swirls around the two men, now at Stump's car on the highway

Hell, no
'm driving
Over my dead body
Cobb pulls a gun from his overcoat pocket and aims it right at Stump's head
Your call
You miserable son of a bitch
You coward, you pathetic, frightened, desperate old man -- you can't do anything without that gun and frankly it doesn't impress me to keep flashing it because  know you're not gonna shoot me 'cause you need me worse than  need you
What, you're gonna kill me
Cobb smiles
He loves it when someone stands up to him
He thrives on confrontation
've killed a man
Fine, then put me outta my fuckin' misery
'm freezing
Cobb hands the gun to Stump
Here ya go, Stumpy
like a man who stands up to me
Stump holds the gun awkwardly, not knowing what to do
Now give me the keys

Stump, in the passenger's seat, braces himself for certain death
It's only another hour -- plenty of time to tell you my story before we find us some women
Women
Plural
Some for you, some for me
We'll have a helluva time
The broads're probably lining up right now, waiting for ol' Ty and his buddy Stump
(muttering) Dear God
And Cobb launches in as he accelerates down the mountain, every curve risking death
He seems at peace with the world -- in the driver's seat, literally, on the edge of being utterly out of control
suppose you want to know about my childhood
Writers usually do
None of this 'know ye that a prince and great man has fallen' stuff -- My philosophy is simply this   -- Life is too short to be diplomatic
man's friends shouldn't mind what he does  or says, and those who are not  his friends, well, to hell with  'em
And Cobb drifts into a story of his youth
He's suddenly so relaxed that he pays little attention to the road

Shit, it that was my fastball 'd wear a dress
Then Cobb shouts at the shortstop, a large German-American athlete, the great
Hey, Wagner
'd shade me a little up the middle if  was you
Wagner doesn't budge, comfortable in his position, not drawn into Cobb's taunts
Stoic, implacable -- far from Cobb
(to catcher) You try to take my head off then you throw a sinker away, in and out, same old shit -- sinker away
His chatter stops, his focus is intense and sudden
He holds the bat strangely, with a split grip, a left- handed batter, he dangles the bat almost parallel to the ground
For all his fierceness, there's a delicacy in the way he holds the bat
baton, a paintbrush, a magic wand
Here comes the pitch -- sinker away -- and Cobb unleashes a swing that is at once quick and powerful
He drives the ball to left, the opposite way -- Wagner lunges to his right -- But the ball skips into left
Cobb streaks to first and rounds the base viciously, daring to stretch it into a double but slamming on the brakes and returning to first when the throw rifles into second

Hey, Krauthead, 'm coming down

The Catcher fires
Wagner takes the throw as Cobb arrives in a spikes-up slide
And Wagner swipes a brutal tag in Cobb's face -- his giant ham of a hand in the tiny glove clutching the ball lashes across Cobb's mouth

Both men seem satisfied

And as the pitch arrives in the Catcher's hands, the Catcher digs in to take on Cobb -- Cobb slides spikes high, flying above the earth, his back leg slashing his spikes like knives
It is a slide of utter defiance and violence, a slide intended to harm

#2 hate your guts, Cobb
Cobb tips his hat and speaks easily to the fan
good day to you, too, sir
The police escort Cobb to right field -- the roar of the vitriolic crowd increases
(
) Do you know what it's like to be booed like that
Cobb in right with the cops -- the crowd on its feet, booing so loudly that the air is all one giant, wailing moan of hatred
(
) It feels wonderful
They couldn't live without me
They came to the ballpark to see me

Cut-out letters read:    " - ' " Cobb puffs on a cigar defiantly as he reads his hate mail
(
) Fifty thousand fans trying to kill me everywhere  went

-        (&)                   58 Armed police patrol the stands looking for snipers as Cobb plays the game in right field surrounded by police
The booing increases -- fans truly hate him

Only great men are booed
Captains of industry and presidents
knew 'em all

Just another portrait
(
) And Calvin Coolidge wasn't any damn fun at all
' during the portrait
We can read his lips as he mouths "fuck you" silently

-                 62 Like an out of control bobsled -- Cobb races and Stump hangs on for his life
After World War Two, General Patton asked me for an autograph -- he said he patterned himself after me
(beat) Are you getting this
'll remember
Why aren't you writing
'Cause 'm trying to have a good grip on things when this car goes over the next cliff
ain't ready to die yet
Cobb's tone changes suddenly -- he questions Stump with- out guile or anger, as if his answer is obvious
But neither am
Cobb stares at Stump, waiting for an answer, and forgets about the road
Stump looks up in fear and points at the road
Ty
Cobb swerves wildly back onto the road, such as it exists in the blizzard
said 'm not ready to die
Then watch the fucking road
But you're not listening to me may have every God damn disease known to man but  am never going to check into a hospital because am alive and  am going to get laid in Reno

Maybe  don't wanta get laid
You queer
'm married
thought you were divorced
We're in the middle of a
problem
We're talking
Talking my ass
Quit hanging on -- get a divorce
Is that why you don't wanta get laid in Reno
'Cause you're feeling loyal to a woman you're divorcing
That's really stupid, Stumpy
'm not getting a divorce
'm being loyal
Is that why you used to wine and dine that little brunette who had an office across the courtyard from you in Santa Barbara
Stump is nailed
What do you know about her
do my homework, Stumpy
know where the bodies are buried
(defensively) It didn't last long

When   it comes to women 'm a total shit   -- the difference is, Stumpy, that    know 'm a shit
Nobody knows about the brunette
Our little secret, huh
(beat) And that part about me being a shit with women
That ain't gonna be in the book
gotta put your family in my book
Your book
My book
And nothing about my ex-wives or children are gonna be in it
My book is about baseball
My book is about Cobb
Cobb is baseball
: 63
63 Suddenly something appears ahead on the roadside
Cobb doesn't see it
Stump does
It looks like a figure, huddled, wrapped, immobile in the swirling snow
It can't be
Ty
Look
It's a man
- attempts to wave at the car
nearly-frozen, desperate attempt to flag down the car
Fuck him
() 53
63   :                                                      63 Stop the car
Cobb brakes -- the car spins to a stop some distance past the figure standing knee-deep in snow
Whoever it is he's gotta be pretty stupid to be out in this shit
We're out in this shit
And Stump climbs out of the car
: 64
() -                              64 Stump trudges back to the half-frozen figure who flails his arms stiffly at the apparition of a car in all this
The figure is wrapped in blankets, his head covered
We cannot see who it is until we are in his face
Help me
Please help me
My God
it's you
Are you okay
It is Willie, the black man who Cobb fired the day before
(  ) can't believe you found me
Let me help you to the car
told you that you'd only last one day with the bastard
Cobb's in the car
He's driving
Willie stops trudging toward the car
Mr
Cobb's in the car
Yeah
() 54
64   :                                                      64 Then 'm not getting in the car with that son of a bitch
'd rather take my chances out here
You're coming
And Stump drags Willie to the car, though the man is re- luctant the whole way, he is in no condition to resist
(muttering the whole way) He hates me
He hates black people
He fucking hates everybody
Don't give him the pleasure of dying out here
If dying out here gives him pleasure then  won't die out here
They get to the car -- Stump opens the back door to help the nearly-frozen man into the car
Cobb grumbles
Ty, it's Willie
We can give him a lift to town
Bullshit
ain't givin' no nigger a ride nowhere
: 65
'  -                                          65 And Stump loses it -- he grabs Cobb's pistol off the seat of the car and aims it right at Cobb's head
Shut the fuck up and give him a ride
Now who's the coward
You won't shoot me
You need me
Stump hands the gun to Willie
() 55
65   :                                                     65 No
But 'm sure Willie would take great pleasure in it
Willie climbs into the back seat with the gun
Cobb is livid
You'll pay for this, Stumpy
Say, Willie, you a baseball fan
Yessir
Who's the greatest ballplayer of all time, in your opinion
Willie Mays, no doubt about it
That nigger couldn't hold my jock
Excuse me, Mr
Cobb, the man is speaking
66                                                          66 And Cobb jumps on the gas -- the car races off, back down the mountain, fishtailing as it goes
And 'd say the second greatest player of all time is Jackie Robinson
or maybe Josh Gibson
Shut up
And of course, the greatest base runner of all time isn't riding in this car -- the fastest baseball player of all time was Cool Papa Bell -- Cool Papa would've easily broke all your stolen base records -- () 56
66   :                                                     66 Noooooo
Cool Papa   was so fast that when he entered a   hotel room and flipped the light   switch off, he'd be asleep in   bed before it got dark
And then there's Satchel Paige
Oh yeah, Satchel Paige could throw a porkchop past a wolf, Mr
Cobb, ol' Satchel woulda had you eatin' outta his hand, he woulda had you hittin'
220 and kissin' his black ass to boot
Shut this man up
The man with the gun does the talking, you wretched, old prick
67     -                                                 67 racing down the highway in the snow, and we go      out hearing Willie recount the greatest ballplayers      of all time -- all of them black -- as Cobb seethes, a      gun to his head
Stump feeds Willie, watching Cobb's       racism simmer
Into the storm the car disappears -- fishtailing down the mountain
The blizzard grows thicker, the flurries taking over the mountain, until all we see is -- The thick snow falling from the dark sky
Suddenly -- Ice
Slow down
Tyyyy
68    -                                            68 as slick as a bobsled run

He accelerates with vengeance

70                                                  70 The world spins around them as they cling for their lives
Until: -- the car slams into a bank of snow
Suddenly, silence
The three men sit without speaking for several beats, slowly acknowledging that they have survived
Finally: Fucked up roads
They don't build highways like they used to
71    -                                      71 glows a welcome sign in the night
It is no longer snowing
Well, Mr
Cobb, thank you for a lift into town
Willie hands the gun to Stump and climbs out of the car, bidding farewell to Stump as he does
() 58
71   :                                                   71 And you, sir, should leave this disgusting, wretched, sorry son of a bitch immediately
Good evening
Willie tips his hat and trudges to the neon glow in the distance
Cobb and Stump alone in the car
They both look out -- the car is buried, hood deep, in the bank of snow
: 72
-                                     72 Under the famous arch that reads: "The Biggest Little City in the World," a tow truck pulls Stump's car into town, and up to: - The truck stops -- Stump helps Cobb out and into the old style building adjacent to the gaudier casinos
: 73
-                                73 Stump helps Cobb to the registration desk in a clean, but very modest old hotel
, 30s, stands at the counter in the middle of some dispute with the clerk
She wears a long, cheap, plain- cloth overcoat and galoshes
Stump bursts in, oblivious to the conversation in progress
Two rooms, please
The woman turns to confront the two men
Now we see her
On a fabulous platinum-blonde wig is stuck    a yellow slicker-type rain hat
The ear flaps are     awry, the platinum-blonde wig curls up around it --    the effect is thrilling
() 59
73   :                                                    73 Stand back, you old farts
'm in the middle of something -- (back to clerk) The heat's on the blink and the mattress is lumpy -- want a discount
Aw, c'mon, you always want a discount, Mona
() Ra-mona
and the mattress is always lumpy -- Cobb pulls out a bottle of pills and washes a handful down with a deep swig from a pint bottle of whiskey
The Clerk looks on with alarm
Excuse me, 've gotta get him checked in
He's very sick
We're all sick in the eyes of God -- but some of us still have manners
She whirls and leaves the lobby, leaving the three men
Two rooms, next to each other
; 74
'  -                                       74 Stump helps Cobb shoot up with insulin -- The needle clumsily groping for a vein in the old man's arm
His face looks terrible, drawn, drained
Cobb reaches into his pouch and pulls out a bundle of cash and security notes, tied neatly with a string
(barely audible) My money
() 60
74   :                                                   74 Your money's okay, Ty, right here
My gun
Your gun's okay, too
right here
And Stump hands Cobb his beloved pistol, which Cobb takes with great affection and comfort
Stump helps Cobb into bed, covering him with a blanket
The gun and the money sit on the pillow next to his head
Cobb speaks with great pain just before he passes out from pain, drugs, and exhaustion
We haven't missed the testimonial dinner, have we
No we haven't missed the dinner
Good, good
Cobb manages a small, pained smile before drifting off into sleep
Stump turns off the light and exits
: 75
'    -                           75 Stump pours a glass of vodka, settles into a chair, and dials the phone
He swallows deeply of the drink, and waits
(on phone) Hello
Happy Birthday
It's your Daddy
Yeah
(beat) Your birthday was yesterday
No, it couldn't be
Stump quickly checks a calendar on the wall and realizes he's missed his son's birthday
() 61
75   :                                                   75 (on phone) Omigod, what can  say
feel terrible -- no, it's not okay, jeez
When  get off the road we'll do something special -- a late birthday, eh
Maybe you can go to spring training or something with me, eh
Yeah
(beat) Listen, is your mother there
(beat) know she doesn't want to speak to me, but  want to speak to her
(waits for answer) Okay, okay --  feel terrible about the birthday
'll call you real soon
And tell your mother 'm not drinking anymore
Okay
'bye, 'bye
Stump hangs up the phone -- Takes a deep breath, and
He pours another drink, and sits down to his typewriter
Fuck it
Stump is hunkered over his typewriter pounding away
His indicates what he is writing
(
) was a fool for thinking Cobb's brilliance might be what  needed at this moment of my life
Ty Cobb was the last thing  needed
(beat) He was not misunderstood -- he was understood perfectly well
He hated blacks, he hated Jews, he hated Catholics -- he hated everything except himself and his own view of the world

Noon
against the headboard jarring Stump to consciousness
He looks up to see: Cobb reading the pages in a rage
He tears them as he does
'Pathetic, paranoid, lost in the past
' What is this shit
Stump awakens slowly, disoriented, amidst a shattered bottle
Those are my notes
You can't look at my notes
You're notes -- my life
You're gonna betray me, you son of a bitch
You want the truth
'm gonna tell the truth

Mine, for crissakes, 'm the writer
But 'm the legend and legends are not pathetic
(slightly defensive) These are just notes
Don't you understand anything about 'greatness'
Maybe you should find another writer
There's not enough time left
This frank admission momentarily stops Stump
'm entitled to my opinions -- Now that's pathetic
Who gives a good God damn about the opinions of Al Stump
What people want to know about is Ty Cobb
And they don't want to know who he hates 'cause everybody hates somebody
They don't wanta know if he had two wives or ten
They don't wanta know if he hit women or if they hit him
You think they wanta know how to steal second base
Yes
Precisely
Well  don't

You wanta find the missing piece to finish the puzzle known as the Madman Cobb -- you think you're the next Hemingway but you're just a moderate success in a moderate-sized pond

That what you're looking for
The childhood incident that explans me

Well  was a prick before it happened and a bigger prick after it happened so stick that up your Sigmund Freud ass
Silence
Stump is shaken by this story
Your mother killed your father

have to
Not if  say so

Well, you were pretty stupid to give up approval, weren't ya
Fuck you, Cobb
Fuck me
Why me
(suddenly charming) Why you mad at me
Your agent made the deal, your lawyer, your publisher, you didn't even read the contract because you trusted them
Who the hell ever trusted a lawyer or an agent

Stump has been left out of the exchange, and mumbles
'Moonlit garden of the gods'
The audience stands to applaud Cobb -- Full and genuine
Cobb graciously waves to the crowd, bowing, basking

And this one's for the Georgia Peach
They break into "Sweet Georgia Brown

Cobb breaks into a little dance with Ramona at the table, much to Stump's (and Ramona's) amazement
For a moment, at least, there is great footwork and lightness in his movement -- we get a glimpse of the great athlete he once was
The great Ty Cobb
'mon up here
They want you, Ty -- Of course they want me
And Cobb heads for the stage, walking better but not without effort, a walk enhanced by drugs and booze
As he does, Ramona turns to Stump

My great pleasure, sir -- (shaking hands) 've always wanted to ask you something, Mr
Cobb, with all the great ballplayers playing right now -- how well do you think you'd do against today's players
Well,  figure against today's pitchers 'd only hit about
275, 280
That's amazing, Mr
Cobb, considering your lifetime average is nearly a hundred points higher
Why do you think you'd only hit 275 against today's pitchers
() 72
84   :     (4)                                            84 Because 'm 72 fucking years old, that's why, God damn it
Give me that thing
Cobb grabs the mike and takes over
First of all  wanta thank you for that song, 'Sweet Georgia Brown
it's a great song about my home state and  appreciate it
(beat) That song has become the theme song for the Harlem Globetrotters
(as Prima nods with a smile) It's too bad such a fine song had to be stole by a buncha niggers playing a faggot game in their underwear
Prima and his cohorts are aghast
They cling to the hope that this is some put-on, some joke
They force a small, unnatural laugh
Stump winces and leaves the room, heading for the bar
'Course the Globetrotters are owned by a Jew named Saperstein so whadda you expect
disaster
Prima tries gamely to seize the mike back
Thank you very much
Another round of applause for the Georgia Peach, Ty Cobb
got the mike, Dago -- gimme a God damn minute
Nobody's got respect for their elders any more
Cobb turns to the crowd which, even in it's drunken state, is appalled and in disbelief
() 73
84   :    (5)                                             84 Now let me explain to you how to hit a baseball
It's a lost art
Ever since that half-nigger Ruth started hitting home runs, the skill, the art, and the science have been lost
Cobb grabs a clarinet from a member of Prima's band
Now, say this is a bat
The   and   are quickly gathering to figure out what to do
Let's just haul him off -- That's Ty Cobb
He'll fucking kill me
You see, the bat is like a wand, a magic wand
it should be caressed, held like a woman
like a woman who's really in need of a man
The Casino Manager winces and consults
Oh God, here we go
Hitting a baseball is really very easy
you can't force it
you can't overpower it
you go with the pitch
you let the bat do the work
it's all rhythm and flow
And Cobb starts demonstrating hitting techniques to the bewildered audience and casino staff
He strikes that familiar, strange stance -- choked up on the bat, a split grip, the bat held parallel to the ground

-                                     85 Stump sees Ramona at the bar, her cigarette/cigar tray on the bar
She's smoking and working her way through a tall drink
He approaches her
Excuse me
You again
You could learn some manners from your friend
'll try harder
(motions for bartender) You're a beautiful woman
It's the wig
Ramona pulls the wig off her head revealing a sea of bobby pins and hair pins tying her natural brown hair to her head
She sets the wig on the counter and scratches her natural scalp
The damn thing itches but it's good for tips
Give me a scratch, will ya
Stump scratches the back of her scalp, somewhat embar- rassed and somewhat aroused
Turn you on
Hey, Harvey, another round
On him
Vodka and grapefruit juice
Ramona slaps the wig back on her head
Slightly akilter
She doesn't care
Harvey delivers another round
Your wig's crooked
Does it bother you
No, no

Stump is so taken aback that he doesn't know how to answer
Flustered, he looks around, then takes a deep hit on his drink
He is very unsure
You want money
'm not a whore
don't screw for money
Jesus
'm sorry
didn't know mean 'm not good at this
Just divorced, huh
Not yet
It's written all over ya
Giant letters right across the forehead

Ha
Plain as day
Ramona lets out a loud, hearty laugh without inhibition
It's obvious, huh
Obvious
(beat) So, if ya wanta pay me to screw, won't do it
Then  won't
Screw or pay
Whichever

85   :    (2)                                             85 So ya don't wanta screw
No,  do
All this ambiguity --  see why she's divorcing ya
Stump, completely befuddled, lets down completely
He doesn't care about getting laid or drunk or anything for the moment, except having someone to talk to -- the some- one is Ramona
don't know what 'm saying or doing anymore
'm trying to speak my heart
Oh God
told my wife  wanted a divorce
She said 'okay' -- then realized maybe  don't
Then go back to her
No
Then quit crying
You want a divorce, you don't want a divorce, you're asking marital advice from a woman you're trying to get in the sack -- Jeez Louise
'm not myself
Who is
sigh
Stump is lost
He motions to the bartender

85   :    (3)                                              85 Another round, Harvey
(back to Ramona) This assignment has me befuddled
'm supposed to tell the world that a monster is really a prince
'm supposed to lie
You being paid
Very well
Then it's not a lie
It's a job
Quit agonizing -- take the money, do what you gotta do, and get it over with
can't
Then quit
No
For godsakes why not
Stump has to think about this for a while
He knows greatness
'm in the presence of greatness
want to learn about greatness
She looks at him like he's crazy
Greatness is overrated
Maybe you're right, maybe you're right
So what do you want
Stump drinks deeply -- his heart needs alcoholic reinforcement
() 78

Why do men have such a hard time saying what they want
: 86
'   -                                  86 Stump and Ramona stagger in drunkenly -- they are awkward and passionate
She grabs his vodka and takes a swig from the bottle
Wait, wait
don't drink too much
Ya think  won't be able to screw if 'm too drunk
Well
yeah
Screwed, stewed, and tattooed
She laughs a hearty laugh, letting it all out
'mere
want to hold you
You're so thoughtful -- the others are trying to get me drunk and you're trying to keep me sober
You'd be good husband material
Not so fast -- didn't mean -- Come here

86   :                                                   86 They embrace -- and hold each other fully, doing nothing but holding on
Stump relaxes

Shh, shh

moment of quiet, simple bliss -- when: The door bursts open -- the   with a , and: Cobb bursts into the room -- Full of rage
You two-timing bastard
You God damn Judas Iscariot
You stealing my girl
'll kill you
She's not 'your' girl
And Cobb lashes out at Stump -- Stump tries to block the blow, but Cobb is relentless, and Cobb hits him again
Stump falls backwards -- His head hits a corner of the table
What're you doing
And Cobb backhands Ramona across the face, knocking her down
Stump lies on the floor only half conscious
He grabs his head
Blood
The room swirls in front of him as -- Cobb grabs Ramona, pulling his everpresent gun from his pocket as he does
You're coming with me
don't want to
Cobb jams the pistol into her jaw

Her wig falls off
Cobb picks it up and stares at it
What's this
My hair
Put it back on
She does -- The wig sits at a funny angle
That's better
Who are you again

You're right
You might
Take your clothes off
Ramona removes her top -- her breasts are jammed into a classic 50's push-up bra
You got big tits
like big tits
(terrified) They aren't so big
They're average, actually -- but these bras are great
Push 'em right up there
owe a lot to the bras and wigs
girl needs what she needs -- Shut up
Take it off
She does
And covers her breasts with her hands
Shy, huh
Get on the bed
Ramona gets on the bed -- Cobb circles the bed continuously
You're a beauty
Roll over
She rolls on her face, propping herself on her elbows
Terror and tears
Mr
Cobb,  -- Shut up

Blood on his hand
Stump feels his way past a couple doors, listening in, unsure which room is Cobb's until a booming voice -- (
) Ramona
Stump hurries to Cobb's door and listens in to be sure

thousand dollars
He holds out the money for her
Do what you gotta do and get it over with, Mr
Cobb
Silence
Cobb takes a big, sloppy hit from a bottle, throwing in a few pills for good measure
want you to tell everyone you meet that you fucked me and  was the best fuck you ever had
That's all
That's a lot
For a thousand bucks
Hell yes
He reaches out and straightens her wig which is pretty crooked by now
She lets him
Then he falls apart, vio- lently grabbing his crotch
'm looking at the most beautiful woman in the world, do you hear me
Cobb grabs his crotch with the violence he does everything
And 'm dead down here
Dead
Nothing
And it's been like that for over two years
Nothing
Now get outta here before  hit you
Cobb lashes out at Ramona -- a vicious right hand
She ducks as his fist slams through the headboard
Georgia Peach my ass -- Georgia trash is what you are

89   :    (2)                                               89 Ramona grabs her clothes and runs from the room, past Stump who has heard it all
He enters Cobb's room
Cobb sits at the foot of the bed, thoroughly flustered
Stump helps him into his bed where he curls up with his money and his gun, barely conscious
She was a great piece of ass, Stumpy, best  ever had
Good, good
Have we missed the Testimonial Dinner
No we haven't, Ty
now get some sleep
Stump tucks Cobb in his bed as the old man drifts into sleep, turns off the light, and heads back to his own room
asleep
Even in sleep, dying, he is twitching and full of fragments of unspent energy
(
) He slept for days
thought he was gone for sure
But even in sleep he was restless and in motion, a fire always burning in his belly

(
) It was a baseball book and  kept it in the typewriter for him to discover and amend
(beat) It was a book  never planned to publish
Stump sits on his bed smoking his pipe and writing in longhand on pieces of paper of all sizes
(
) The second version, my version, was written on legal pads and hotel stationery and cocktail napkins and anything  could scrape together without drawing his attention
(beat) kept my version in a box at the bottom of my suitcase -- () 86

(
) The whole thing had become an agonizing death watch, and most days  couldn't believe the son of a bitch wouldn't die
The door flies open and Cobb bursts in -- full of vim and vigor, a fresh set of clothes on, fire in his eyes
Nothing like a cigarette girl and thirty hours of sleep to invigorate a man, Stumpy
You look like shit
Been writing, Ty
Cobb goes straight for the typewriter and yanks out a page, grabbing the stack of typed pages as well
Well let's see how we're doing
Cobb reads the pages with utter seriousness
Stump watches
Yes, God damn it, Stumpy, yes
Now you're getting it
None of this Sigmund Freud bullshit
Baseball, Stumpy, baseball
Yes
Cobb rushes to Stump and embraces him, almost like a child
His eyes are wet with tears
You understand
People are no damn good but you're different
You're okay, Stumpy, you get it
(beat) And  can trust you
Stump stares back
And nods
Now let's go roll us some dice, Alimony,  feel a hot hand coming on

He signs as he walks, suddenly gracious in this moment
'see how it    works, Stumpy
they boo ya your    whole career, then when you're    about to kiss off, they put ya    on a pedestal
That's what being a    legend's all about
Arriving at a craps table, Cobb barges right in
Send the dice to the Peach, boys, and belly up to the bar
The croupier pushes the dice to Cobb who places a bet, as do the others
Cobb rolls the dice -- but he sees something
Somebody
Stumpy, what is that
- are rolling dice at a nearby table
They appear friendly, not intimate, two among twelve
My girl went for the nigger
think they're just next to each other by accident

The intention is strictly to get back at Cobb
This is my man, Mr
Cobb, and he's all man
My girl with my nigger
She's not your girl and he's not your -- Cobb pulls his gun and tries to climb across the table
He's got a gun
Mr
Cobb
Get down
Cobb on the table with a gun as Stump and police officers scramble to grab his gun hand
Customers hit the deck
What is the world coming to

Cobb is wrestled to the table by several men, including Stump
And it takes all of them to escort the struggling Cobb out of the casino into the lobby

Where we going, Stumpy,  wanta find us some more women
Stump hesitates, chaos swirls around them
Cobb is out of control, we hear threats of arrest -- when
Ty, Ty, Ty, calm down
It's time for the testimonial dinner
This stops Cobb cold
He's immediately sober

) Actually the testimonial dinner at the Hall of Fame was still weeks away, but it was the only thing that got him calmed down enough to get us out of town without getting thrown in jail -- or getting somebody killed

(
) And as we headed across country, Cobb as usual was oblivious to the chaos he'd left in his wake
In fact he was buoyed with new enthusiasm at the prospects of seeing his cronies once again

Cobb talks into a tape recorder sitting on his lap, enjoying the hand microphone

We all thought he was gonna eat and fuck his way outta the league but he hung around for a few years -- 'Hung around'
He was -- (quickly revising) -- next to you -- the greatest player of all time

You drank it, you mean
You can't go to the Hall of Fame like that
won't allow it
Things have been rough, Ty
There's two things a man should never do -- complain or explain
(beat) Now go buy a God damn tux
Cobb peels some cash from his roll of dough and throws it at Cochrane
The stores are closed
(exploding) How could you be so good behind the plate and so bad everywhere else
Cobb grabs the phone and dials impatiently
Operator
What's the best men's shop in town
Who owns it
Jack who
Gimme his home number
Better yet, ring him up for me
(beat) Jack
This is Ty Cobb
Go down to your shop and open it up and sell a tux to the great Mickey Cochrane
And sell him a cumberbund and a shirt and a bow tie and some God damn cologne
He smells like shit
What's the address
(makes a note) He'll be there in twenty minutes
Cobb thrusts the card into Cochrane's hand
God damn it, Mickey, ya gotta give a better effort

And Cochrane exits, leaving Cobb with Stump once again
He's lost, Stumpy, the poor man's been lost ever since he took a fastball in the ear
You take care of him
For years -- but that ain't goin' in the book
Jesus, Ty, why not
Because it would embarrass him
Cobb winces as he tries to rise, almost falling
don't wanta take the cane tonight
You've got to have your cane
don't have to have anything -- if you stay near me
in case wobble or something
just a firm hand right here
(touches his own lower back) That'll keep me upright
'd appreciate it
Now how do look
Cobb poses in his tux -- proudly, unsurely
You look like the greatest ballplayer of all time
You going to be okay
'll be okay when  hear the crowd

The great left-handed pitcher from the New York Giants, who struck out five men in a row in the 19-- All-Star game -- Carl Hubbell
Lanky Carl Hubbell, 50's, waves to the crowd and cameras as he enters to applause from the locals gathered
The great third baseman from the Chicago Cubs, Harold Joseph 'Pie' Traynor

Fifty-eight home runs in a season -- Mr
Double- -- the great Jimmy Foxx
The barrel-chested Jimmy Foxx, 60, gets out and waves
And ladies and gentlemen, the highest lifetime batting average of all time, first man elected to the Hall of Fame, retired with over 90 batting records, the one and only Georgia Peach, Ty Cobb
Cobb gets out, followed by Stump
Cobb walks into the building, past the cameras, utterly erect and upright, stretching his full six feet one inch
The applause is the most enthusiastic yet

He makes it to the door
Your hand, Stumpy, your hand
Stump slips his hand to Cobb's lower back just as they arrive at the door, and the two men enter together

And Cobb is met by the Hall of Fame director, , 50, who shakes his hand and shows him in

Welcome to Cooperstown, ladies and gentlemen
We're here to acknowledge the greatest ballplayers of all time, those men still gracing our presence who were among the earliest inductees into the Hall of Fame
(beat) Waner, Hubbell, Foxx, Cochrane, Hornsby, Traynor -- these are the giants, the Old Masters of our craft
The spotlight moves around the room and each man waves, half rising from his chair
But the greatest of all is with us tonight -- simply put, the best ballplayer ever -- Tyrus Raymond Cobb
spotlight hits Cobb, who rises and waves to the crowd as the lights dim

Cobb

What did you see on that film tonight
saw Ty Cobb playing baseball
That's all
That's all
was raised in the Baptist Church but  know that Heaven is just the ol' oskefagus -- the change-up
You swing from your ass 'cause you think life is a fastball down the middle and after your bat has crossed the plate and you're all off balance and looking stupid, the ball just kinda flutters across home, slow and juicy and hittable, and as it crosses the plate, the ball looks at you and smiles a nasty smile and laughs its way into the catcher's mitt

she doesn't know where
You cocksucking liar
My sister doesn't want to see me and you're lying
And Stump, at last, goes off -- Liar
cocksucking liar
Of course 'm a liar
That's what 'm paid to do, isn't it
Lie about Ty Cobb

Some wind blows, and the threat of rain
wish you'd die

Cobb is out of the car on his cane -- following Stump
And go to hell
line of lightning signals a storm in the distance
Oh, 'll do that, too

They look up -- The entrance to the Royston Cemetery casually-maintained slope of several acres up a hill

Stump laughs at Cobb's comment

That's rich
(following along) Forgiveness is crucial to human maturity and religious growth
Religious growth
We all need to forgive more, Al

You're too angry
You're all pent up
'm angry
Through the cemetery they keep walking, up a long hill full of tombstones and shrines and sprays of dead and dying flowers and gaudy plastic bouquets
Cobb following steadily along with his cane, several paces behind Stump
shakes the ground
And more lightning
Are you angry because  discovered you were a whore
Is that it, Alimony
'm angry
Is it the divorce
You gotta let go of it
love her
don't want a divorce
Sure ya do
You're just so used to accommodating people that you don't know what you want anymore

But you have no friends

How about the brunette in the courtyard
Is she your friend
heard she fucks everybody -- she must be everybody's friend
mausoleum looms behind Stump, bigger than anything in the cemetery, classical, outsized, monumental, even elegant
One simple word is above the door, carved in granite:
'm glad we're here --  was gonna bring you here anyway sooner or later -- Stump turns to see the mausoleum, and the word
Which Cobb of Georgia is that
Several beats as the men take it all in
Finally: (with pride) That is me
And rain suddenly falls from the skies, threatening to soak the two men
Cobb heads for the mausoleum -- Stump follows
: 144
-                                         144 Just enough room for the two men to stand
On either side of them are two crypts, enough for four burial vaults
Cobb is very calm now, and lucid
Rain falls heavily outside

(beat) The family will be together again
Stump is still fuming, angry and cynical
Under one roof
That's romantic
You want that in the book
Ty Cobb brings the family together at last to enter the gates of Heaven whole
You mock my family -- you mock me
Cobb grabs Stump by the throat and stares him in the eye
My father was a great man
Then why are you such a bastard
Being a bastard is a small price to pay for greatness
, too, am a great man
Let me go
My mother didn't kill my father
What're you talking about
Cobb's fist clinches Stump's throat, forcing him to hear
Outside the mausoleum,  pours down now, a Southern spring thunderstorm unleashing torrents
My father told my mother he was leaving town for the weekend but he came back to the edge of the woods where he tied up his horse

She ducks down
She reaches under the bed and pulls out a shotgun

(
) Because my mother did not kill my father
His mother hands the shotgun to a naked man climbing from bed
(

Cobb's father raises the winow --
The lover into his stomach
Cobb's father lurches onto his back
'  (&) on his back staring up at his mother's lover
(
) The last thing my father saw was the face of the man fucking his wife
The lover unloads the second shell -- blowing his head off
: 147
-                                           147 The rain pours down on the cemetery
Lightning
Cobb still holds Stump by the throat
Well
Is that what you want
'Cause that's all  know and the only other people who know about it are dead
But it ain't going in the book, either, 'cause you're the only friend  got left, and you're the only man  can trust
Cobb lets Stump go, relaxing his grip and -- Stump rages back outside into the rain
Cobb stays dry in the doorway of the mausoleum
() 122
147   :                                                     147 don't want to be your friend
don't want to feel sorry for you
So your mother's lover blew your father's head off
don't care
You were a prick before it happened, you were a prick after it happened, you've been a prick ever since, and you're a prick now
Cobb quietly takes a hit on his flask from the doorway of the mausoleum, watching Stump rant and rave in the rain
Public relations are overrated
What the hell're you talking about
Cobb holds out his flask for Stump
You need a drink
Fuck the drink
Cobb motions for the limo to pull up the slope towards them
You're too angry, Al, you just gotta learn to let it out
Stump stands in the rain screaming at Cobb who stands out of the rain, calm, centered, drinking, dying
'm gonna tell the truth about you, Cobb
'm gonna tell the world you hate women, Jews, and niggers
(calmly) You shouldn't use the word 'nigger', Stumpy, it's racist and demeaning
And  don't hate women -- 'm just not very good with 'em, which puts me in the same boat with you and every other man  know
() 123
147   :    (2)                                             147 You treat people like dirt
Cobb comes out into the rain toward Stump
The children of America need heroes, Al, you know that
Cobb takes him by the arm and tries to lead him to the limo
Get your hands off me
'mon, Al
(taking by the arm) You're making a fool of yourself out here
It's not dignified
(helpfully) Come in out of the rain
And Cobb helps Stump into the limo, which pulls out of the cemetery still being drenched by rain
: 148
-                                148 The rain is thick -- Yet another motel, another neon sign, and the limo parked in front of one of the cabins
149
-                                             149 Both men are sitting in rocking chairs in front of a fireplace
Stump is in a bathrobe, his feet in a big pan of warm water, a bottle of booze in his hand
He looks a mess
Cobb is idly playing with his pistol
He's calm, introspective
You're an educated man
tell me what you think
Stump just sits there, drinking
() 124
149   :                                                      149 Either my father was
inadequate for my mother
he was not the man  thought he was
not a great man
not even a good man
(beat) or my mother was
trash
a common whore
(beat) It's that simple, isn't it
Stump just shrugs and takes another hit
As a boy  stood in court next to her because suddenly  was the man of the house but as  stood there steadfastly by her side and heard the jury say 'not guilty'  knew she'd been with another man the night of the killing
Stump drinks deeply once again
man must defend his mother at all times, isn't that right, Al
Or am  a fool
man must defend his mother at all times
That's what  thought
And the two men sit there silently, rocking slightly, trying to stay warm, when there is -- Suddenly a  at the door -- They stare at each other
Cobb puts down the gun, struggles to the door and answers it
stands in the rain, carrying a briefcase, trying vainly to keep dry
Al Stump
In here

Mr
Al Stump
Stump nods as he swigs on the bottle
've been chasing you all over the country -- (opens his briefcase) -- 'm here to serve you papers
Papers
'm afraid it's divorce, Stumpy
know this routine
You're being sued for divorce
But my wife and  are still talking
Yeah, and what she's saying is 'fuck you
' Fuck me
Well fuck her
No, fuck him
Stump reaches for the gun and aims it at the man
You ain't serving me no papers
The Man is frozen with terror as Stump rises from the chair -- drunk and crazed, aiming the shaky gun
'm just doing a job
love my wife
We all loved our wives, Al, that's got nothing to do with it

There's a million broads out there, Stumpy -- put down the gun
Stump  at the man but the shot goes wild
He's drunk, he's not experienced with guns, he's shaking
am not going to accommodate this man, Tyrus
You're all mixed up
Give me the gun
You're absolutely right, Tyrus, 've been accommodating people my whole life and it stops right here
(beat) You've killed a man
'll kill a man
He misses again
The Man drops to his knees, begging for his life
No
Please, dear God
have a family, too
Don't give me that sob-sister stuff
Stump tries to hold the gun with two hands, approaching the man, to nearly point-blank range
Al
no
Al
Al
Stump looks crazed, a bathrobe falling open, his feet bare and wet, his hair awry from the rainstorm
He aims the gun at the man's head, looks at Cobb with wild glee
() 127
149   :    (4)                                             149 Life is too short to be diplomatic
man's friends don't care what he says or does
You're my friend, Ty, right
You're my friend
No
Stump pulls the  --
Empty
As the Man looks up, realizing he's alive, Stump strikes him across the face with the gun, drawing blood
The Man scrambles to his feet and races from the room, grabbing his briefcase, and running to the door
You're crazy
No wonder she wants to divorce you
You're crazy
And the Man runs into the rainy night, leaving Cobb and Stump
Stump's head collapses in his hands -- Bewildered, exhausted
The two men sit alone for several beats before Stump speaks
He is completely lost
almost killed a man
little drunken excess
No
put a gun to a man's head and pulled the trigger
wanted to kill him
It's forgotten already
saw nothing
Nothing happened
Yes it did
Al, listen to me

Attorneys are pigs -- divorce attorneys are lower than pigs
What happened tonight was private
An intimacy
Your own business
Our own business
Nobody else's
It wouldn't belong in a book about greatness
Nobody's gonna write my biography
And when the brunette in the courtyard brushed against you, know what happened, Al
warm summer breeze, the smell of jasmine, her black hair against a white blouse -- you came to life again, you got hard -- and when you saw her naked it was more than you could bear
it's okay, Al, it's okay
(beat) The brunette ain't gonna be in the book either
Stump looks up at Cobb but says nothing
He picks up a nearly-empty bottle off the floor and takes a hit
And the drinking
Well, they used to say ol' Ty had a drinking problem but you can booze me right under the table right now
no problem
and nobody's God damn business, either
Stump raises his hand, motioning Cobb to stop
get it

Then get some sleep
You look pathetic

Cobb helps Stump lie down, pulling a blanket over him
Stump rolls over to go to sleep, Cobb tucks the blanket around him, and picks up the bottle from the pillow
Cobb takes a last hit of the bottle -- Finishing it off
He throws it to the ground, and looks around the room for another
'  - ' lies open on a chair
nearly-full bottle of Scotch is visible
He makes it to the bottle -- Steadies himself -- he's ex- hausted
He takes a deep swig from the Scotch
Several deep gulps, enough to kill a horse, but it only helps him steady himself
And he sees something in the suitcase -- He looks down at -- '  - which Stump has been filling with his secret manuscript
Cobb opens the box and pulls out a paper
He reads it
He looks at Stump, and -- Cobb takes the box and the bottle to the chair by the fireplace, where he sits down, puts on his reading glasses, and starts reading "the real story
" He reads page one slowly and carefully, then starts mov- ing through the box full of odd sizes of paper, hotel stationery, cocktail napkins, legal pads, all handwritten in secret
He keeps glancing up at the bed where Stump is in the deep stupor of sleep

Cobb picks up the pistol and reloads it
Cobb marches resolutely to the bed
Cobb aims the loaded gun at Stump's sleeping head
Oblivious in a drunken sleep
Rage is in his eyes
He cocks the gun
He's crying
He shakes his head
You don't have a point of view, Stumpy, you ain't worth killing
Cobb puts the gun into his own mouth -- He clears his throat, as if to make room for the gun barrel
He gags slightly and closes his eyes, he thinks for the last time
Something's not right
Cobb removes the gun momentarily and looks at it
He sees that the gun barrel is covered with blood
Dear God

Cobb coughs again -- More blood covers his chin
He touches his chin, touches the blood, smears it around a little, looks at his hands now covered with blood

No
Cobb moves around the tiny bathroom like a caged animal
He falls to his knees in prayer in front of the sink
Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed by Thy name
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive -- (beat) Aw, fuck it
little late for that sob sister stuff
Cobb rises to his feet and looks in the mirror again
He grabs a hand towel and daubs his face with it
bit more blood trickles from his mouth
And gradually a deep calm seems to settle over him
so this is what it feels like

(couple beats) Hello, Ma'am
This is Ty Cobb

Where's my money

Cobb grabs Stump's hand for one last word
Stumpy, there's nothing wrong with wanting glory
