More and more blocks of cut stone appear

You don't work

The quarries are felt even more now
Walls of stone rise up around the guys

All the Italians do it
That's some country

Shuts the door
He wanted to know if the house was sold
They could use the money
You can come and live with me when it's sold
In Italy everybody lives together
All three of them are getting concerned about Mike
Ever since you won that Italian bike you've been acting weird
You really think you are Italian

High above him are the College Kids
Three guys and three girls
One of the guys is standing on the ledge above the water
Our guys are looking at the College Kid on the ledge
He seems intent on diving into the water
It's a distance of at least eighty feet
He pushes off and dives in executing a beautiful somersault into a swan dive

He looks from the diver toward the guys and seems to feel his position undermined
've never seen anyone dive off from there

Neat lawns line the area

Girls in bikinis sunbathing
Guys washing their cars
Some other guys passing the football around
Transistor radios playing

Ahead of Mike's car we see two Guys and two Girls playing Frisbee
They are standing on the lawns and throwing the Frisbee to each other across the street
Mike's car is moving slowly forward when an ill-thrown Frisbee lands on the street
Mike sees it and speeds up
Girl is running to get it but Mike gets there first and runs over it
Dave gets a quick look at the Girl as she stops"suddenly to keep from getting hit
The two college Guys run out and give' Mike the finger
He sees them in the rearview mirror
Hey, those bastards are giving us the finger
He slams on the brakes
Hey, c'mon, Mike
We're on their turf
Dave is looking back at the Girl
The two Guys are challenging Mike, motioning to him to come back
The two Girls are trying to talk them out of it
Mike-is gunning the car
They think they own the place
They do
Besides, you've humiliated them enough
In ancient Japan when you ran over a samurai's Frisbee he had to commit suicide
Just as he laughs Mike shifts the car in reverse
The two Guys and Girls are standing in the middle of the road
The Guys are coming forward thinking Mike's going to stop, but Mike has no intention of stopping
The Girls and the Guys split as Mike's car roars between them
Once again Dave catches a fleeting glimpse of the Girl
Having scattered them, Mike makes a -turn and drives away in the direction he came from
