Written by Wes Anderson & Roman Coppola May 1, 2011 ' landing at the top of a crooked, wooden staircase
There is a threadbare, braided rug on the floor
There is a long, wide corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and battleships
The wallpapers are sun-bleached and peeling at the corners except for a few newly-hung strips which are clean and bright
small easel sits stored in the corner
Outside, a hard rain falls, drumming the roof and rattling the gutters
ten-year-old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully eating a bowl of cereal as he walks
He is Lionel
Lionel slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window
He takes out a portable record player, puts a disc on the turntable, and sets the needle into the spinning groove
child's voice says over the speaker: (
) In order to show you how a big symphony orchestra is put together, Benjamin Britten has written a big piece of music, which is made up of smaller pieces that show you all the separate parts of the orchestra
As Lionel listens, three other children wander out of their bedrooms and down to the landing
The first is an eight-year-old boy in a bathrobe
He is Murray
The second is a nine-year-old boy in white boxer shorts and a white undershirt
He is Rudy
The third is a twelve-year-old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee-high socks and brightly polished, patent-leather shoes
She is Suzy
She carries a one-month-old striped kitten
The boys drop down to the floor next to their brother
They lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their fists, listening
Suzy sits in the windowsill
She opens a book called Shelly and the Secret Universe
There is an illustration on the cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her neck
Suzy starts to read -- then pauses
She lowers her book
She raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes
She looks out into the rain

' rickety, three-story, stone-and-shingle house on a hillside with turrets and a widow's walk
weather vane swings creaking on the roof
Tree tops sway in a cluster below
The sea is almost invisible in the misting rain, and the mainland is a shadow across the sound
Suzy sits in the high window, watching
: The family stuck indoors all day out of the rain
In bedrooms, bathrooms, and corridors, we see the boys
They shoot marbles
They throw jacks
They play cards
They eat grilled cheese sandwiches together in the kitchen
In half-open doorways, we see the parents
Mr
Bishop is a tall, fifty-year-old man in Madras trousers and horn-rimmed glasses
He reads the newspaper and drinks coffee
Mrs
Bishop is a tan, forty-five-year-old woman in a Lilly Pulitzer-type wrap-around skirt
She washes her hair, topless, in the kitchen sink
In windows, we see Suzy with her binoculars
She watches wet branches shaking in the woods
She watches a man in a slicker fishing from a row-boat
She watches a white colt in a field
She eats a bowl of tomato soup alone in the pantry
In the distance, a seaplane flies by below the clouds
: The edge of a cliff above a white beach
rocky peninsula curls into the background
Brisk wind rustles the tall grass
fifty-year-old man, bald on top with long hair on the sides, stands next to a surveyor's levelling instrument on a tripod
He wears rubber boots and a parka
He is the narrator
He speaks to the camera: This is the island of New Penzance
Sixteen miles long
Forested with old- growth pine and maple
Criss-crossed by shallow tidal creeks
An important seabird habitat
There are no paved roads but instead many miles of intersecting foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry that runs twice daily from Stone Cove
The year is 1965
We are on the far edge of Black Beacon Sound, famous for the ferocious and well-documented storm which will strike from the east on the fifth of September -- in three day's time

clearing in the woods with ten small, khaki tents pitched in a row
banner on a flag-pole ripples in the wind
It reads Camp Ivanhoe
bugler in a khaki uniform with a yellow neckerchief plays a staccato tattoo
He has a gauze patch over one eye
He is Lazy-Eye
thirty-five-year-old man in the same uniform emerges through the flaps of a larger tent
He is Scout Master Ward
He puts on a wide-brimmed felt hat
badge on the crown reads Khaki Scouts, Troop 55
He lights a cigarette
thin scout with curly hair and sunglasses joins him at his side
He is Gadge
Morning, Gadge
Morning, sir
Gadge flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book
Scout Master Ward goes over to a latrine made from thick sticks and rope
tall, stooped scout digs a trench next to it with an army-shovel
He is Deluca
Deluca
Latrine inspection
Deluca stops digging
He pulls on a rope and water runs down a chute
It bursts through a valve, spins a little door, and a small, red flag flips up
Scout Master Ward nods
Good
Gadge makes a note
Scout Master Ward strides away
He stops in front of a scout with long hair over his eyes sitting on a stump twisting something in his fingers
He is Roosevelt
Roosevelt
How's that lanyard coming
() don't know
think  skipped a stitch
: small, woven, multi-colored cord with a rabbit's foot attached to the end of it
It has been braided exceedingly badly and is brutally twisted and misshapen
4
Scout Master Ward studies the lanyard briefly
He looks perplexed
He pats Roosevelt on the back gently and does a secret handshake with him
Gadge makes a note
Scout Master Ward strides away
An off-road motorcycle races by in the background behind the tents
It jumps a mound of dirt, kicks sideways in the air, and revs away riding a wheelie
Scout Master Ward frowns
Scout Master Ward stops in front of a pile of boards and logs stacked six feet high
thick-set scout with black hair and a crooked tooth approaches with more logs in his arms
He is Skotak
Skotak
What's all this lumber for
() We're building a tree house
Skotak points up
Scout Master Ward squints
There is a small platform under construction about sixty feet above them
Two scouts are sawing something in half on it
Scout Master Ward looks astonished
That's not a safe altitude
Scout Master Ward circles around the trunk while looking up at the tree house
He stammers: Why's it up so high
If somebody falls -- it's a guaranteed death
Well, where would you've built it
() Lower
Gadge makes a note
Skotak looks sheepish
Scout Master Ward strides away
He stops in front of a very small scout with tiny eyes poking at an anthill with a stick
He appears to be contemplating pouring lighter fluid on it
He is Nickleby
Nickleby
Spot check
Nickleby stands up
He looks extremely disheveled
5
Your socks are down
Your shirt-tails are untucked
Your trousers are not properly pressed
You are reported for uniform violation
Gadge makes a note
Nickleby slouches
Scout Master Ward strides away
He stops in front of a work-bench covered with newspaper where one scout sifts green powder through a funnel into cardboard tubes and another makes wax stoppers with a metal press
They are Panagle and Izod
sign on the side of the table reads No Smoking
Scout Master Ward hands his cigarette to Gadge, who holds it away at arm's length
How many rockets you up to, Panagle
Sixteen and a half
( ) That enough for the Jubilee
Gadge shakes his head
Scout Master Ward turns to Izod
Izod, go fetch another pint of gun-powder from the armory shed
Izod dashes around the corner
Scout Master Ward strides away
He shouts: Redford
Halt
The motorcycle skids to a stop in front of Scout Master Ward, engulfing him in a thick cloud of dust
He coughs and waves his arms in the air
As the smoke clears, we see that the rider is a bronze, all-American-looking boy with blond hair
He is Redford
His motorcycle has flames painted on the gas tank
He tries to cover for himself: Safety-test, sir
() Come again
The vehicle appears to be in good working order
'm just checking if -- 6
() Reckless cycling
Second warning
Next time,  take away the keys
Gadge makes a note
Redford scowls
Scout Master Ward strides away
He walks past a scout in a white apron cooking bacon over a charcoal grill
He is Chef
Morning, Chef
Chef rings a bell hanging on a post
Scout Master Ward arrives at a long picnic table
He sits down and opens a magazine called Indian Corn
There is a picture on the cover of a scout troop crossing a bridge in Indonesia
: The first page
caption across the top reads Scout Master- in-Chief
There is a drawing of a seventy-year-old man on horseback
He has silver hair and a moustache
signature below reads Commander Pierce
There is a quotation in large text: "An eagle was never hatched from a goose's egg
" As Scout Master Ward reads, all the scouts begin to join him one-by-one
They range in age from twelve to fifteen
They unscrew the tops of tin mess-kits and assemble folding utensils
The chef brings a tray of scrambled eggs to the table
The scouts serve themselves noisily
Scout Master Ward starts to take a sip of coffee from a metal cup -- then stops
He looks up from his magazine
Who's missing
Scout Master Ward silently reels off a list of names, scanning the troop
He turns and shouts across the camp: Shakusky
Breakfast
Silence
Scout Master Ward calls to Lazy-Eye: Lazy-Eye
Lazy-Eye plays another tattoo
Silence
Scout Master Ward closes his magazine
He flicks his cigarette into a red bucket labelled Fire
He picks up a strip of bacon and chews on it as he rises to his feet and walks down the row of smaller tents
The last one is sealed 7
at the front
Scout Master Ward stands with his hands on his hips and says: Shakusky
You in there
Scout Master Ward tugs on the tent's flaps
He frowns
He says to Gadge: It's zipped from the inside
The other scouts begin to gather with their tin breakfast plates in their hands, watching curiously while they eat
Scout Master Ward's voice softens: Sam
Scout Master Ward looks concerned
He produces a wooden- handled scout pocket-knife
He unfolds a few blades and gadgets and decides quickly on a thin tool with a hook on the end
He crouches down and slips the hook through a small gap at the base of the flap, twists left and right, then pulls up briskly, unzipping the tent
The lining of the tent is printed with images of trees and pine cones, and a plaid rug covers the floor
There is a foot locker, a gas lamp, a chair with a folded blanket over it, and an empty cot
Scout Master Ward steps inside slowly, bent over, examining the space
He lifts the lid of the foot locker
He looks under the corner of the mattress
He picks up a piece of folded yellow notebook paper sticking out from under a pillow
He opens it and stares at it
He turns suddenly to the chair against the wall of the tent and slides it aside
There is neat but slightly jagged hole the size of a basketball cut through the fabric in the back corner
Scout Master Ward looks to his staring troop
Jiminy Cricket
He flew the coop
one-room bungalow with a sign on the door that reads Island Police
There is a wood-panelled station wagon parked alongside it with roller-lights on the roof and a sheriff's office insignia on the door
(This is the only car on the island
)  dock stretches from the cottage into a small 8
harbor
There is a launch moored at the end of it which bobs in the rough tide
silver Airstream trailer is parked under a tree nearby
six-foot tall, forty-five-year-old man sits on a stool fishing from the side of the dock
He wears a short-sleeved police uniform with a black necktie and a baseball cap
His glasses have clear, plastic frames and a strap
He is Captain Sharp
Two grouchy, leathery, very old men in plaid flannel and hunting caps fish alongside Captain Sharp
speaker on a post emits an electric buzz
Captain Sharp turns
He stands up briskly and says to one of the old men: Watch my line, Edgar
small office with a desk, a file cabinet, and a two-way radio
Captain Sharp comes inside, sits down, grabs a microphone, and presses a red button on the side of it with his thumb
Hello
This is Captain Sharp
Over
Scout Master Ward's voice comes over a crackly speaker: (
) Captain Sharp, this is Randall Ward over at Camp Ivanhoe
Over
Captain Sharp pours himself a cup of coffee from a pot on a hot-plate as he answers distractedly: Morning, Randy
What can  do for you
Over
(
) 'm not sure, exactly
've got an escaped Khaki Scout
Over
Silence
Captain Sharp frowns slightly
What does that mean
Over
(
) One of my boys seems to have stolen a dug- out and some fishing tackle, ten pounds () 9
(
) (cont'd) of sundries, two bedrolls, plus an air rifle -- and disappeared
Over
Captain Sharp slowly stirs sugar into his coffee as he contemplates this
He says finally: Any idea why
Over
(
) No
He left me a letter of resignation
Over
: sheet of wide-ruled yellow paper which reads in a boy's : Dear Scout Master Ward,  am very sad to inform you  can no longer be involved with the Khaki Scouts of North America
The rest of the troop will probably be glad to hear this
It is not your fault
Best wishes, Sam Shakusky
Captain Sharp scratches his head
He checks his watch
Pause
guess we better notify his folks
Over
(
) Over and out
clapboard cottage surrounded by a white, picket fence sign on the door reads
Mail
Captain's Sharp station wagon is parked in the background
young woman with her hair in a bun sits at an operator's switchboard eating a sandwich wrapped in wax-paper
She is Becky
She wears bulky head-phones with a microphone attached
Captain Sharp paces behind her
Scout Master Ward flips through a stack of letters and post cards
bell rings on the switchboard
Becky plugs cords into sockets
Hello, Diane
10
(
) Becky,  have your person-to-person from Chesterfield
Hold the line, please
Becky signals to Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward
They sit down quickly and put on their own sets of operator head- phones
Go ahead, Chesterfield
: Split-screen
On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Becky
On the other side, we see a seventy-five-year-old man with a grizzled face sitting at a kitchen table drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette while a white-haired woman ices a cake in the background
They are Mr
and Mrs
Billingsley
Mr
Billingsley says into his : Hello
Hello, sir
This is Captain Sharp
Yes, sir
received your message
Thank you very much
In fact, we've come to a decision, as a family, because this is only the most recent incident involving Sam's troubles, and it's just not fair to the others, so, unfortunately -- we can't invite him back, at this time
Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Becky all look puzzled
Captain Sharp says evenly: There's no cause for alarm, sir
We'll find him
We're just notifying you as a matter of protocol and so on
understand that
'm notifying you of the situation on my end
'm confused by that statement
You can't invite him back
11
'm afraid not
He's a good boy, he's got a good heart, but it's just not fair to the others, you see
He's emotionally disturbed
Long pause
No one moves except Mrs
Billingsley icing her cake
Captain Sharp says finally: Am  speaking to Sam's father
Mr
Billingsley frowns
He says, surprised: No, sir
Sam's parents passed away a number of years ago
We're Mr
and Mrs
Billingsley
We're foster parents
Sam's been with us since last June
Mrs
Billingsley has stopped icing her cake
She watches Mr
Billingsley
Scout Master Ward interjects: Excuse me, sir
This is Scout Master Ward speaking
Are you implying Sam's an orphan
Well, it's a known fact
Of course, he is
Why the hell doesn't it say that in the register
Excuse my language
Scout Master Ward holds up a manila file-card
Mr
Billingsley shrugs
don't know
What register
: The manila file-card
It is labelled Khaki Scout Register
Sam Shakusky is typed across the top line
There is an address, health information, and a small, faded snap-shot stapled to the corner of it of a twelve-year-old boy standing in a sunny tobacco field
He wears his scout uniform with a Davy Crockett-style coon-skin cap
We sent him a letter
It should reach you presently
12
Scout Master Ward looks quickly through his stack of letters
He stops and pulls out an air-mail envelope
He stares at it
Captain Sharp says forcefully but highly agitated: Mr
Billingsley, 've got an escaped Khaki Scout
We're notifying you as a matter of protocol
You say you can't invite him back
You say he's an orphan
Well,  don't understand how that works
( ) What am  supposed to do with him
That's up to Social Services
They'll be in touch with you
They'll look after Sam
Good luck to you
Mr
Billingsley hangs up the telephone
Becky pulls the cords out of their sockets
Captain Sharp looks to Scout Master Ward
Silence
Becky opens a tin of home-made chocolate chip cookies
Captain Sharp declines one
Scout Master Ward tries one
He looks very impressed
Scout Master Ward stands on a bench addressing his assembled troop
The scouts are equipped for hiking with back-packs and walking-sticks
You have your orders
Use the orienteering and path-finding skills you've been practicing all summer
Let's find our man and bring him safely back to camp
Remember: this isn't just a search party, it's a chance to do some first- class scouting
Any questions
Lazy-Eye raises his hand
Scout Master Ward points to him
Lazy-Eye
- What's your real job, sir
( -) 'm a math teacher
13
- What grade
() Eighth
Why
Lazy-Eye shrugs
Scout Master Ward frowns
You know, we're, actually, kind of, in the middle of something, if you didn't notice
This is a crisis
Anybody else
Redford raises his hand
Scout Master Ward points to him
Redford
What if he resists
() Who
Shakusky
Are we allowed to use force on him
() No, you're not
This is a non-violent rescue effort
Your instructions are to find him, not to hurt him
Under any circumstances
Do  make myself understood
The scouts murmur their understanding
Scout Master Ward nods
Good
Pause
Scout Master Ward wheels back to Lazy-Eye: 'm going to change my answer, in fact
This is my real job
Scout Master, Troop 55
That's us
'm proud of that
The scouts look impressed but slightly lost
Scout Master Ward says finally: 14
Be leery out there
, let's get started
Where's Snoopy
Right here
Skotak holds up a leash attached to a wire-haired terrier
Scout Master Ward takes a sock with a fleur-de-lis on it out of a paper sack
Give him the scent
Scout Master Ward hands the sock to Skotak
: Redford, Deluca, Nickleby, Lazy-Eye, and Gadge at the back of the group talking under their breath while Skotak waves the sock under the dog's nose: - heard he ran away because his family died
heard he never had any family in the first place
That's probably why he's crazy
'll tell you one thing: if we find him, 'm not going to be the one who forgot to bring a weapon
Me, neither
: The troop moves in a wide line searching through a thicket of skinny trees
Redford carries a net and a giant tomahawk in a sling
Deluca has a large hunting knife tucked under his belt
Panagle holds a walking stick with a cluster of nails sticking out on the end of it
Nickleby, Izod, and Lazy-Eye all wear bows and quivers of arrows strapped to their backs
The wire-haired terrier strains at the end of a leash, sniffing down a foot-path
15
Scout Master Ward speeds up the river in a small boat with an out-board motor
He gives orders over a walkie-talkie
Gadge steers
Captain Sharp stands on the doorsteps of various big houses showing the snap-shot of the missing scout to: an elderly woman, a house-keeper, a group of children, a priest
They all shake their heads
Captain Sharp drives his station wagon down a beach, through a field, and over a bridge
' Captain Sharp stands at the front door talking with Mr
and Mrs
Bishop
Mr
Bishop holds a glass of red wine in one hand and an open bottle in the other
Mrs
Bishop looks slightly uneasy
They both study the snap-shot
Camp Ivanhoe
That's all the way across the other side of the island
You really think a twelve-year-old boy could row this far in a canoe
Most likely not
(with a shrug) It's possible, Counsellor
( ) disagree, Counsellor
It'd take him three days, at least
don't think so
Two days, maximum
Well, 'm not going to argue about it
Be that as it may, will you let me know if you see anything unusual
: binocular shot of Captain Sharp from overhead as he walks away down the front steps
He passes Lionel, Murray, and Rudy on their way up the path
They wear wet bathing suits and towels around their shoulders
Captain Sharp pats Rudy on the top of his head
He dries his hand on the leg of his 16
trousers
He gets into his station wagon, backs out of the driveway, circles through the woods, and drives around to a small dirt road a hundred yards behind the house
He stops the car
He gets out, sits on the hood, and lights a cigarette
Suzy watches from the widow's walk with her binoculars
She lowers them
She looks curious
She raises them back to her eyes and sees: Mrs
Bishop from overhead as she comes out the back door of the house carrying a basket of damp laundry
She pauses at a clothesline, looks left and right, then walks quickly into the trees
She crosses a foot-bridge and arrives at the dirt road
Captain Sharp stands up
They talk briefly but intensely
Mrs
Bishop leans against the car and stares into space
Captain Sharp touches her hair
Mrs
Bishop makes a gesture with her fingers
Captain Sharp hands her his cigarette
Mrs
Bishop takes a puff, hands it back, and strides away again through the woods
Captain Sharp gets into his station wagon and drives off
: portable night stand
There is a reel-to-reel tape recorder recording on it
framed photograph next to it shows the Scout-Master-in-Chief posing with a troop in front of the Matterhorn
' The front flaps are tied-open, and a mosquito net is drawn hanging lantern flickers on a hook
bugle plays a variation of taps in the distance
Scout Master Ward sits on a cot dressed in pajamas
He smokes a cigarette and drinks a glass of brandy while he speaks tensely into a microphone: Scout Master's log
September second
First day of search party for Sam Shakusky
Morale is extremely low, in part,  suppose, because Sam is, unfortunately, the least popular scout in the troop, by a significant margin
'm worried, and 'm confused
Please, let us find him tomorrow
Please, don't let him fall off a cliff or drown in the goddamn lake or something
terrible day at Camp Ivanhoe
Let's hope tomorrow's better
In fact, 'm going to say a prayer
Scout Master Ward presses stop
He kneels down on the floor, closes his eyes, presses his palms together, and whispers
17
Scout Master Ward zips up his tent and turns off the light
Crickets chirp
Bats circle
The wire-haired terrier digs carefully through a pile of trash
The next morning
fast current runs along a shallow ravine deep in the forest
The boy from the snap-shot rows a mini- canoe painted with Native American tribal symbols and severely over-loaded with boxes, bags, and blankets
He wears a pellet gun slung on a strap over his shoulder and his coon- skin cap
He smokes a pipe
sash across his chest is decorated with numerous small, embroidered patches
There is a woman's enamelled brooch pinned to his shirt
It is a jeweled, black scorpion
He whistles to himself quietly as he steers under a fallen tree-trunk and winds through gentle rapids
He is Sam
An eddy under a willow tree
The end of the canoe is tied to a branch, and the cargo is stacked on the shore
Sam covers the boat with a camouflage net and dresses the top with pine- needles
Sam hikes through a pass wearing an extremely large back-pack with stakes, metal poles, and two bed-rolls strapped to the bottom
He wears a compass on a string around his neck
: binocular shot of Sam emerging from the woods into a wide meadow
The grass comes up to his chest and flows in waves
He pauses to check his compass
He spins slowly one direction and then back the other while he stares at the dial
He looks up again
He walks onward
He stops
Suzy lowers her binoculars
She stands at the end of a path cut through the high grass
She has a leather folder in one hand, the portable record player in the other, plus a small suitcase and her kitten in a basket at her side
Sam takes his coon-skin hat slowly off his head
He strides across the meadow
Suzy watches him approach
She swallows
Her lips part
Sam comes onto the path
He stops ten feet away from Suzy
Sam and Suzy stare at each other

Jack's Church across the top

It reads: ' "' " Performed by the Choristers of St
Jack Wood and New Penzance : Dusk
brick church at the top of a bluff overlooking the bay
It is overgrown with ivy and wisteria
There is a cemetery with a low wrought-iron fence
An organ plays inside
: One Year Earlier play is in progress
The set includes a long ark with a sail built on a platform behind the altar
Two teenagers crouched in the wings ripple a narrow, blue sheet across the foot of the stage
(This is meant to be water
) The rest of the room is dim, with tall candles flickering along the center aisle
The beams are draped with garlands
large congregation fills every pew plus folding chairs against the walls
More people sit and stand on the steps to the choir loft at the back and in nooks and corners
The members of a brass ensemble seated beside the organist wait for their next cue, following their sheet music with instruments poised
Khaki Scouts and scout masters occupy the rear section of the church
very young troop in a slightly different version of the uniform fills a row near the exit
Sam sits on the aisle
He looks bored
baritone built like a linebacker in robes and a fake beard sings ominously on the stage
Cymbals crash
Sam stands up and discreetly wanders toward the side door with his hands in his pockets
slight, forty-year-old man in the same uniform watches him from the end of the pew, frowning
: Sam quietly entering the lobby
The sound of the music deadens as he gently shuts the door behind him
He turns around and puts on a yellow scout cap with Junior Khaki stitched on the bill
The room is jammed with children dressed as animals, waiting nervously in a long line that 19
winds all around the space
They whisper and shuffle
large woman stares through a small window into the church with her hand on a doorknob
She is Mrs
Lynn
She snaps her fingers suddenly without looking to the children
They fall silent
Pause
Mrs
Lynn swings open the center doors
Music fills the room again
The first twenty of the children begin to sing
They march out of the lobby, two by two
The woman closes the doors behind them, and the next group takes their place to wait
Sam walks slowly among otters, monkeys, squirrels, and skunks, examining their costumes, periodically touching horns, tusks, and teeth
No one pays attention to him
He drinks a sip from a water fountain
He picks up a mint from a bowl and sucks on it
He slips out through a swinging door
Sam moves down a dark corridor
Voices murmur
He pokes his head around a corner
rack of choir robes and cassocks blocks his path
He slides two of them apart and looks : Five eleven-year-old girls in black leotards sitting on a bench in front of a mirror framed with light bulbs
They talk quietly and fix their make-up
They all wear wings on their arms and beaks on their heads
Suzy sits among them in black feathers
Sam stares at her
He steps into the light silently
Suzy sees him in the reflection
The other girls turn around quickly, covering themselves
Sam removes his cap and takes another step forward
His eyes dart briefly among the other girls
He says to Suzy: What kind of bird are you
Suzy hesitates
She looks to the girl next to her, who says in a bossy voice: 'm a sparrow, she's a dove, and -- Sam does not look away from Suzy as he interrupts, pointing: No,  said, "What kind of bird are you
" The other girls all look to Suzy
Pause
'm a raven
20
Suzy lifts her beak slightly higher on her forehead
The other girls look annoyed but transfixed
The bossy girl frowns
Boy's aren't allowed in here
Sam does not look away from Suzy as he answers quietly: 'll be leaving soon
Sam points down at Suzy's lap
One of her hands is wrapped in a bandage
What happened to your hand
() got hit in the mirror
( ) Really
How'd that happen
() lost my temper at myself
Sam is deeply intrigued by this
The other girls look puzzled
Suzy presses her hair back off her face
She watches Sam nervously
What's your name
Sam
What's yours
'm Suzy
Sam nods with his eyes still glued to Suzy's
Suzy bites her fingernails
The bossy girl rolls her eyes
It's not polite to stare
Sam holds up his hand for the bossy girl to stop talking
Mrs
Lynn steps into the doorway
Birds
Ready
21
Mrs
Lynn does a double-take
She snaps at Sam: Who are you
Where'd you come from
Go back to your seat
Sam hesitates
He spits the mint into a trash can, ducks out through the clothing rack, and is gone
skinny girl dressed as an owl watches Suzy while the other girls hurry to their feet
She says quietly: He likes you
Troops flood out from one side of the church while children in animal costumes flood out from the other
They criss-cross among grave-markers and head-stones
Sam stops abruptly, face to face with the skinny owl
She whispers something, points behind her, and thrusts a folded scrap of paper into Sam's hand
vehicle crowded with scouts
Sam sits alone in the back row
He stares into space, entranced
: Suzy on-stage at the top of a pedestal with her arms in the air, spreading her wings
She is surrounded by the entire cast of singing animals
The music soars
: Sam as he looks down at the piece of paper in his hand
: sheet of pink stationary with an address in a girl's red felt-tip cursive and the words: Write to me
: The present
Sam and Suzy face each other in the wide meadow
Sam says carefully: Were you followed

( ) doubt it
Good
Sam frowns and squints
He points
Did you bring a cat
Suzy nods
Sam smiles
Suzy smiles
Sam takes a folded map out of his pocket
He signals for Suzy to come closer
Can you read a map
Uh-huh
do cartography
Sam points to one of the patches on his sash
It has a protractor embroidered on it
He unfolds the map
feel we should go halfway today and halfway tomorrow, since you're a less experienced hiker, and you're wearing Sunday-school shoes
(pointing on the map) Here's where we are right now
'd like to pitch camp here by sixteen-hundred (which means four o'clock)
How does that sound
Fine
You want some beef jerky
Sam tears a strip of dried meat in two and gives half to Suzy
She tries to chew on it
Sam nods: 23
Let's go
: Sam and Suzy walk together down a hill, across a field, and through a wooded path eating beef jerky
They both smile continuously
Are you thirsty
No
Well, if your throat gets parched, stick a pebble in your mouth and suck on it
You can quench your thirst with the spit, supposedly
Sam shows Suzy some bits of green and yellow sticking out from under his coonskin cap
Sometimes  stick leaves under my hat
It cools your head down
That's a good idea
It might help also if you didn't wear fur
() True, but this adds camouflage
Sam stands in a clearing and pulls a handful of dry grass
He holds it in his fist
Here's a trick
Throw grass in the air, and you can see which direction the wind's blowing
Sam throws up the grass
It swirls and drifts vaguely
Suzy squints
Which way
Unknown
guess it doesn't really matter, as long as we cover our tracks
24
Sam and Suzy stop to investigate and discuss: a patch of mushrooms, moss on a stump, ferns, poison ivy, and a low bush with purple fruit
Sam looks skeptical
These might be poisonous
( ) No, they're huckleberries, in fact
Try one
Suzy brushes off some dirt and eats a berry
Sam puts one into his mouth and nods
Not bad
Anyway, they're good for survival
Sam and Suzy look through Suzy's binoculars at a deer drinking from a stream
Suzy whispers: He knows someone's watching him
agree
Why do you say that
() don't know
just think he can feel us
Sam and Suzy walk across a fallen tree over a stream
snake swims on the surface below them
Sam assists Suzy onto the far bank
You smell like perfume
It's my mother's
Sam picks up two pebbles
He and Suzy both put them in their mouths
They click against their teeth
brought water, too
Sam and Suzy watch a small, green worm wriggling in the air, swaying from a silk thread
They stare, wide-eyed
Suzy cups her hand a few inches below it and moves it around in a circle
Sam shrugs
25
Should we catch him
() What for
Trout bait
We need worms
() No
Pause
The worm curls and uncurls itself gently
Sam nods
You're right
We'll let him live
Maybe 've got a licorice whip
The banks of a large pond
All of Sam's and Suzy's bags, boxes, and suitcases are arranged around a small tent decorated with more tribal symbols
The kitten is asleep
Sam and Suzy stand at the water's edge as he removes the camouflage net from the canoe and says gravely: How strong of a swimmer are you
Pretty good
broke our school record for the back-stroke
( ) Well, 'm not that strong of a swimmer, so  wear a life-preserver think it's a good policy to get in the habit, anyway
Sam and Suzy both strap on vests belted with cork blocks
: strip of bright red licorice on a hook under water
: 26
Sam and Suzy in the middle of the lake
Suzy sits at one end of the canoe fishing with a bamboo pole
Sam drapes his fingers off the side and stirs the water
Watch out for turtles
They'll bite you, if you put your fingers in their mouths
Let me see if  can catch this one
Sam dips a net into the lake and brings it up with a small turtle in it
He lifts it out of the net
It has red and yellow markings and a slightly damaged shell
Sam flips it over
The word Albert is written on the underside of the turtle in magic marker
Sam says blankly: Somebody wrote on him
The fishing pole jerks in Suzy's hands
She yells: The stick's moving
() You got one
Sam jumps to his feet and heaves the turtle with two hands
It sails through the air across the pond and splashes down with a whack
Sam yells an announcement: Fish on hook
( ) Reel him in
Slowly
The canoe rocks violently
Suzy snaps: Sit down
Sam sits back down
Suzy winds the reel carefully
Sam says, : You're doing good
Sam points to one of the patches on his sash
It has a rod and reel embroidered on it
This is for fishing
27
Sam twists a stick with a shoelace in kindling and builds a small camp-fire circled with rocks
He cooks two fish with bologna in a frying pan over a camp-fire
He throws in a dash of salt, grinds some pepper, and flips the fish in the air
He holds out a bite on a spatula to Suzy sitting on a log next to him
She tastes it
She looks surprised and nods : Very good
You know a lot about camping, don't you
() 'm a Khaki Scout
It's what 'm trained for
Sam points to one of the patches on his sash
It has fried eggs and bacon on it
Anyway,  used to be
Sam serves the fish onto two tin plates
He says as they eat with folding forks: We can feed your cat the guts and eyeballs
Sam points to a pile of bloody organs and bones on a page of newspaper
Suzy frowns
That's
He only eats cat food
Suzy points to a cardboard box
Sam looks inside
It is filled with ten cans of cat food
Sam raises an eyebrow
What else did you bring
We should make an inventory
Sam flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book
Go ahead
28
Suzy opens the top of her portable record player
She displays it like a salesman
This is my record player
It works with batteries
Actually, it belongs to my little brother Lionel
left him a note
Do you like music
Sam nods and makes a note
Suzy opens her leather folder
There are three
records in it
She takes out one by a French singer
This is my favorite record album
My godmother gave it to me for my birthday
She lives in France
Sam nods and makes another note
Suzy opens her suitcase
It is filled to the brim with hard-back copies of fantasy books
It contains no other items of any kind (including clothing)
These are my books
like stories with magic powers in them
Either in kingdoms on earth or on foreign planets
Also, time-travel, if they make it realistic
Usually,  prefer a girl hero, but not always
couldn't bring all of them because it got too heavy
You can borrow any you want
Sam nods and makes another note
Suzy produces a few more : also brought my lefty scissors because 'm left-handed, my toothbrush, some rubber bands, extra batteries, and my binoculars, as you know
forgot my comb
Sam surveys the entire collection of articles
He scratches his head
That's it
No mess-kit
No flashlight
No canteen
No waterproof matches
Didn't you get the packing list  sent you in my last letter
29
() thought that's what you're supposed to bring
don't own a canteen
Pause
Sam shrugs
He smiles
That's
We can share
Sam picks up one of the books
It is called The Girl from Jupiter
There is an illustration on the cover of a young, alien princess with glittering tears on her cheeks
Sam examines the other books in the suitcase
He looks slightly puzzled
These are all library books
In my school you're only allowed to check-out one at a time
Some of these are going to be overdue
Sam hesitates
He suddenly realizes something
He asks : Do you steal
Silence
Suzy nods reluctantly
Sam looks confused
Why
You're not poor
Suzy stares at the books
She absently brushes some dust off them
She rearranges them slightly
She says finally: might turn some of them back in one day
haven't decided yet
know it's bad
think  just took them to have a secret to keep
Anyway, for some reason, it makes me feel in a better mood sometimes
Sam thinks about this
He leans his chin against his fist
He : Are you depressed
Suzy bites her fingernails
She shrugs
How come
30
Pause
Suzy says philosophically: Well,  can show you an example, if you want -- but it doesn't make me feel very good
found this on top of our refrigerator
Suzy looks into her leather folder and shuffles through some pages
She withdraws a small pamphlet
: The cover of the pamphlet
There is a drawing of a broken tea- cup and the title "Coping with the Very Troubled Child"
Sam frowns
His eyes widen
Does that mean you
Suzy nods
Sam explodes with laughter
It's not funny
To me, it is
Sam slaps his knee and shakes his head
Pause
Suzy dumps her fish into the campfire and throws her metal plate like a frisbee into a tree trunk
It bounces off with a ding
She stands up and says coolly: You really know how to make friends
Suzy walks away
She goes behind a bush and sits down on a rock
She starts to cry
Sam looks stricken and confused
He is very still
He gets up slowly
He tentatively approaches the bush
He looks behind it
He takes two steps closer
He stands above Suzy
He unties his neckerchief, crouches down, and holds it out
'm sorry
Suzy looks to Sam
She hesitates
She takes the neckerchief
That's
'm on your side
31
know
Suzy dries her eyes
She unfolds the neckerchief and studies its design
It is a brave shooting an arrow while leaning off the side of a galloping horse
Sam motions to the books: Which one's the best
: Dusk
Sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe while Suzy sits Indian-style next to him
She reads aloud from a book called The Francine Odyssies
There is an illustration on the cover of an enormous panther with a bloody sword walking behind a small girl in a nightgown
His eyes downcast, his kingdom in ruins, Mynar pressed his heavy paw through the rippling surface of the cool shallows and down to its stone floor
"My people once were lead by a great and noble beast -- and  no longer see his face in this reflection
" Suzy looks to Sam
He is asleep
She takes the pipe out of his mouth and tips the ashes into the camp-fire
She draws a blanket over his chest
She continues: Meanwhile, on the Plains of Tabitha, Francine rested
There would be another time for war
' The dining room
There is a long, wide, empty table with sixteen chairs around it
Tucked in the corner, Lionel, Murray, and Rudy sit at a folding card table
They have plates on place-mats and forks and knives
There is one extra seat
Mrs
Bishop's voice booms, amplified, from the next : (
) Suzy
Dinner
'm not going to say it again
Pause
Mrs
Bishop charges into the room with a steaming casserole
She wears an oven mitt on one hand and carries an electric megaphone in the other
She sets the casserole on the card table and looks out the window
Through the thicket 32
of trees behind the house, a pair of headlights blinks
Mrs
Bishop checks her watch
She says sharply: Where's your sister
don't know, but she borrowed my record player for ten days without asking
() What does that mean
Lionel holds up a small, folded-up piece of pink stationary
Mrs
Bishop snaps it out of his hand and opens it
: short note on pink stationary in a girl's red felt-tip cursive
It reads: Dear Lionel,  need to use your record player
will give it back in ten days or less
Do not tell Mom
(Or Dad
)  will replace the batteries when  return
Signed, Suzy Bishop Mrs
Bishop frowns
She bolts back out of the room
Her voice : (
) Walt
Where the hell are you
There is a loud thump upstairs
Mr
Bishop shouts from : (
) Right here
Why are you cursing at me
: Exterior
Mr
Bishop leans out of an upstairs window
Mrs
Bishop appears in one below
She yells up through the : Does it concern you that your daughter's just run away from home
() That's a loaded question
33
Mrs
Bishop brandishes the note with her free hand
Come down and read this
radio squawks in the woods behind the house
Mr
and Mrs
Bishop turn quickly toward the sound
Mrs
Bishop looks tense
Becky's garbled voice says over a tinny speaker: (
) Scout Master Ward confirms they've had no luck
They're going home for the -- There is a rustling and the sound of a car door opening -- then the radio cuts off
Mr
Bishop frowns
He shouts: Who's there
Captain Sharp emerges slowly from the dark, tangled in a bramble, hopping slowly on one foot as he unwinds a root from around his ankle
He smiles awkwardly and says: Good evening
Sorry to startle you
was -- () What are you doing here
Nobody called the police
know, that's what 'm saying
The search party's not over yet
In other -- Suzy's missing, too
Go find her
() Where'd she -- Wait for me
Mr
Bishop disappears into the house
Captain Sharp and Mrs
Bishop exchange an uncertain look
Captain Sharp pans a spot-light back and forth in the darkness while he steers the car
The lamp has a short in it 34
and flickers with each bump
Mr
Bishop rides in the passenger seat
He stares ahead down the road and says to : How can we help her
She's got so many problems
It's getting worse
Mr
Bishop looks strangely to Captain Sharp
He asks: Whose fault is it
() don't know, but just for the record: ninety-five percent of all runaways return home within six hours
That doesn't do you any good right now
It's just a statistic -- but in all likelihood Suzy's probably hiding in the closet at her best friend's house playing Chinese Checkers at this very moment, as we speak
She doesn't have any friends
( ) How's Laura
() How's Laura
Mrs
Bishop,  mean
don't understand
Is she upset
Mr
Bishop looks baffled and disgusted
He throws his hands into the air
He looks away and shakes his head
Silence
Captain Sharp wiggles some wires
got to get this spot-light fixed
35
' Captain Sharp and Mr
Bishop come to a stop and get out of the station wagon
They look dejected
The screen door bangs open, and Mrs
Bishop quickly descends the front steps with a open shoebox full of letters in her hands
She says breathlessly, shouting: She has a pen pal
It's very intimate
They planned this together
Captain Sharp takes one of the letters and studies it
He says to himself: Sam Shakusky
That's my escaped Khaki Scout
His family died
Mr
Bishop takes a handful of the letters and flips through them
He stops suddenly
He looks horrified
Holy Christ
What am  looking at
: small painting on construction paper of a naked girl stepping into a bathtub
She wears a flower in her hair
Mrs
Bishop continues to shout as she explains: He does watercolors
Mostly landscapes, but a few nudes
Lionel, Murray, and Rudy watch from a downstairs window
Lionel takes a bite from a bowl of melting ice cream
Mr
Bishop stares at the painting
He squints at it and asks : She sit for this
Captain Sharp and Mrs
Bishop look over Mr
Bishop's shoulder
Captain Sharp says calmly: What does he say
: The history of Sam and Suzy's correspondence
36
Sam, dressed in a greasy jump-suit, writes at a work bench in a garage while six teenagers take apart carburetors behind him
They are his foster brothers
Sam reads in voice-over: (
) Dear Suzy, You have a superb voice
You were my favorite animal in the program, by far
Please, find enclosed -- Suzy writes at a small desk on the upstairs landing while Lionel and Murray play a loud duet on a red piano behind her
(Rudy turns the pages of the sheet music
) Suzy reads in -: (
) Dear Sam, Thank you very much
got replaced as the raven because  yelled at Mrs
Lynn
After that  was only a blue jay, but -- Sam works in an alley emptying garbage from several small trash cans into a larger one
Mr
Billingsley watches television in a window, smoking a cigarette
He points to a crumpled wrapper on the ground
Sam picks it up
(
) Dear Suzy,  am sorry your brothers are so selfish
Maybe they will grow out of it
Sometimes people do things without knowing the reasons for -- Suzy reads a book called Disappearance of the 6th Grade
There is an illustration on the cover of a school-teacher levitating at the front of her classroom
There are several watercolor pictures taped to the wall behind her
Most are landscapes of small-town vacant lots
One is a swimming girl in a bikini
(
) Dear Sam, You are an excellent painter, especially trees and telephone poles
Is the girl in the water supposed to be me
My favorite color is -- Sam stands in pajamas staring blankly, eyes wide, at a dog house in flames next to a rusty swing-set
dachsund sits next to him, also watching
Mrs
Billingsley comes running out of the house with a fire extinguisher
(
) Dear Suzy,  accidentally built a fire while  was sleep-walking
have no memory of this, but my foster parents think  am lying
Unfortunately, it is -- 37
Suzy stands in the kitchen looking out through a pane of glass with a hole smashed in the middle of it
Mrs
Bishop is next to her with her hair hanging over the sink while the two of them carefully pick bits of glass out of it
(
) Dear Sam,  am in trouble again because threw a rock through the window
My mother still has glass in her hair
Also -- Five of Sam's foster brothers watch calmly as the sixth throws Sam against the wall then jumps on top of him, pinning his arms to the floor while Sam struggles crazily
(
) Dear Suzy,  have been trying very hard to make friends, but  feel people do not like my personality
In fact,  can understand why they might -- classroom of sixth graders watches in a panic as Suzy throttles one of her classmates
The classmate flails and grimaces as she is strangled
(
) Dear Sam, Now  am getting suspended because  got in a fight with Molly
She says  go berserk
Our principal is against me
Why do -- Sam does sit-ups on a hard mattress in a basement room lined with bunks
He counts out the repetitions under his breath
There is a small, black and white photograph of a man and woman at their wedding tacked to the wall above him
(
) Dear Suzy,  know your parents hurt your feelings, but they still love you
That is more important
If they -- Suzy stands in a doorway screaming at her family while they watch wearily from the dinner table with forks and knives in their hands
(
) Dear Sam,  do think you should think of their faces every day, even if it makes you sad
It is too bad they did not leave you more pictures of themselves
Can you -- Sam writes in his bunk crouched beneath a blanket with a Khaki Scout flashlight pointed at his paper
38
(
) Dear Suzy, Here is my plan
Suzy writes in her bed crouched beneath a quilt with a plastic lantern glowing beside her
(
) Dear Sam, My answer is yes
: sheet of wide-ruled yellow paper which reads in a boy's : (
) Dear Suzy, When
: sheet of pink stationary which reads in a girl's red felt- : (
) Dear Sam, Where
: Suzy kneeling in the dark, crouched in front of an upper window with the shoebox of letters beside her
Outside, the woods are black beyond a moonlit field
(
) Dear Suzy, Walk four hundred yards due north from your house to the dirt path which has not got any name on it
Turn right and follow to the end
Suzy raises her binoculars to her eyes
(
) will meet you in the meadow
The next morning
The end of the path cut through the high grass where Sam and Suzy met the day before
Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, Mrs
Bishop, and Becky stand in two groups talking
Gadge and Skotak stretch a string with ribbons tied to it from stake to stake marking a perimeter
Lazy-Eye walks with the wire-haired terrier pulling at its leash
Other scouts search the field and scan the horizon
Captain Sharp's station wagon and Redford's motorcycle are parked in the dirt
39
Mr
Bishop stands off to the side by himself poking at the ground with a stick
He has two black eyes, and half his face is swollen and purple
Scout Master Ward asks Becky quietly: What happened to him
'm not sure
think he went searching in the dark
Mr
Bishop says loudly without looking up from the ground: She stole the batteries out of my flashlight
Scout Master Ward looks at Becky and grimaces
Becky raises an eyebrow
Mrs
Bishop stands next to Captain Sharp
They move slightly away from the others
Captain Sharp whispers quickly, almost inaudibly: think he's onto us
() Of course, he is
Captain Sharp looks surprised and defensive
He whispers : Of course, he is
Of course, he is
() Why aren't we worried about that, then
am
() Well,  didn't know
Or, anyway, thought  was wrong
Did you hit him
No
He fell in a ditch
40
Nickleby pops up from below the tall grass and thrusts an empty can of cat food into the air
He shouts excitedly: Cat food
think it's a clue
The group quickly gathers around Nickleby
Mr
Bishop snatches the can out of his hand and examines it
He says : That's her
Mr
Bishop throws the can away over his shoulder and walks off with his hands in his pockets
Nickleby runs after the can and picks it up again
Mr
Bishop continues down the hill
Scout Master Ward watches him
He asks Mrs
Bishop, : Where's he going
don't know
Mrs
Bishop follows Mr
Bishop
Captain Sharp turns to the rest of the group and says briskly: All right
We know they're together
We know they're within a certain radius of this spot
'm declaring the case with the county right now
Until help arrives: Captain Sharp looks to Scout Master Ward as he points to various scouts and divides the group into teams: 'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny one, and the kid with the curly hair to come with me in the station wagon
Randy, you drop-in and head up-river with the rest of your troop, then split-up on foot
Becky, call Jed and tell him to circle over this end of the island and fly low
: binocular shot of the seaplane flying in a pattern
It banks sharply
The binocular shot tilts down
Far below, in the distance, Captain Sharp's station wagon rumbles along a dirt road through the woods
The binocular shot pans wide
On the side of the river, Scout Master Ward's motorboat stops
41
Two scouts, tiny figures, pull the camouflage net off the hidden canoe
Suzy watches through her binoculars while Sam crouches beside her
They are hidden behind a pile of rocks
Suzy says : They found the canoe
(angry at himself) Rats
should've put more pine needles on it
Let's go
We're almost there
Sam lifts his backpack onto his back and slings his air-rifle over his arm
Suzy picks up her suitcases and puts the kitten on her shoulder
They walk down a narrow path through a thicket
They emerge into a small clearing
Sam and Suzy stop in their tracks
Deluca, Nickleby, Panagle, Izod, and Lazy-Eye stand in a row along the edge of the woods ahead of them
Deluca brandishes his hunting knife
Nickleby, Izod, and Lazy-Eye point their bows and arrows
Panagle holds his walking stick weapon
The wire-haired terrier strains growling at the end of his leash
Deluca jerks him back
The kitten cowers
The sound of a motorcycle guns, and Redford bursts through the trees, pops a wheelie, and skids to a stop
He lifts his goggles
The motor idles
Sam says finally: What do you creeps want
Redford shrugs and answers with a callous smile: We're looking for you
Why
Because you're a fugitive
No, 'm not
Didn't you get my letter of resignation
quit the Khaki Scouts
42
You're still in uniform
Pause
Sam quickly takes off his shirt and throws it aside
Well, it doesn't matter, anyway
You don't have that authority
We've been deputized
Now are you going to come along peacefully or not
Sam takes a deep breath
He pleads: Listen to some reason:  don't like you
You don't like me
Why don't you stupid idiots just let us disappear
() It's tempting, but  can't allow it
Deluca spits on the ground
He says to Suzy: You shouldn't be friends with him
() Why not
Because he's crazy
() Maybe you just don't know him
We know him a lot better than you
He's emotionally disturbed because his family died
Nickleby, tie him up
Nickleby takes a step forward with his bow and arrow pointed and ready
Suzy looks furious
Sam flips his air-rifle off his shoulder with a twirl
He points it at Redford and Nickleby
Nickleby hesitates
Sam says darkly: Do not cross this stick
Sam motions to a twig on the ground in front of him
Silence
43
You're doomed, Shakusky
Redford revs the motor, pops the clutch, and races across the clearing toward Sam and Suzy
The rest of the troop converges, yelling crazily
: The wide canyon echoing with shouts, screams, and a small explosion
One by one, Deluca, Nickleby, Panagle, Izod, and Lazy-Eye come running out of the trees and down the hill
Finally, Redford hobbles after them, limping and groaning and clutching his side
: Redford's charred, partially demolished motorcycle smoldering in the branches of a tree
Suzy stands on the edge of the ravine staring at the pair of bloody scissors in her hand
She looks shaken
Sam takes the scissors, cleans them with his fingers, and hands them back to Suzy
He says gently: It was him or us
Suzy nods
She turns slowly away
Her eyes widen
Oh, no
Suzy points
The wire-haired terrier lies on his back on the ground with an arrow sticking out between his shoulder blades
The kitten licks at the wound
Sam and Suzy run over to the wounded dog
Sam crouches down, gently presses the kitten away, and says bleakly: They got Snoopy through the neck
Suzy has tears in her eyes
She slides her hands under the wire-haired terrier's body
She begins to hyperventilate as : He needs a doctor
Sam puts his finger to the wire-haired terrier's neck
He : No, he doesn't
He needs a morgue
44
(trying to catch her breath) He's losing blood
Hurry
Where do we go
Suzy lifts the bleeding dog into her arms
Sam grabs her by the shoulders
He locks eyes with her and says with grit and : Suzy
Look at me
Snoopy's not going to make it
(starting to cry) Don't say that
They're after us
We got to move
(raising her voice) He's dying
We can't just leave him
() It's too late
He's already gone
() Stop yelling at me
Sam slaps Suzy in the face
She falls silent
He says slowly: 'm sorry  had to do that, but you're panicking
The first rule in any emergency is you never -- Suzy drops the wire-haired terrier which hits the ground with a thud
She slaps Sam back with a huge, roundhouse smack
Sam falls over sideways
Suzy stands over him
Don't ever do that again
No one's allowed to slap me
Sam stands up and dusts himself off
He and Suzy stare down at the lifeless animal
Suzy says quietly: You're right
He's dead
Sam reaches into a side-picket of his back-pack and takes out an army-shovel
He assembles it
Suzy says hopefully: 45
Was he a good dog
Pause
Sam shrugs
He says distantly, even cosmically: Who's to say -- but he didn't deserve to die
Suzy slowly wraps her arm around Sam's shoulder
They squeeze each other tightly
Sam sighs
He begins to dig
Captain Sharp speeds bouncing down a winding dirt road
Lazy- Eye, Deluca, and Gadge sit next to him crowded into the passenger seat
Lazy-Eye yells into the hand-set of the : - She stabbed Redford in the back with lefty scissors
voice responds over the speaker: (
) Repeat that, please
Over
Captain Sharp grabs the hand-set out of Lazy-Eye's hand
He shouts into it: Puncture wound
Lower lumbar
Make room for a stretcher in the cockpit
Redford is lying on his stomach on a towel in the rear of the vehicle
Scout Master Ward kneels next to him pressing his hand firmly into the middle of his back
There is significant blood
Redford moans loudly
Scout Master Ward reassures him: You're going to be
Thank goodness, she missed the artery
Bite on this
Scout Master Ward puts a pencil in Redford's teeth
Redford grimaces, crunching it
In the back seat, the rest of the troop excitedly re-cap: tried to chop him, but he dodged my tomahawk
Who else got hit
46
Not me
ran away when the girl went berserk
He's got great marksmanship
He shot Deluca in both arms
Skotak points to the front seat
Deluca sits glumly in silence
He has numerous small welts all over his arms
Gadge : Where's Snoopy
Captain Sharp's station wagon skids to a stop next to his office while the seaplane pulls up to the dock as Mr
and Mrs
Bishop approach pedalling furiously on bicycles
Mr
Bishop wears boating shoes
Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward jump out of the car
Skotak and Gadge help them remove Redford on a stretcher from the back of the station wagon
Mr
Bishop struggles with his kick-stand
He shouts: What happened
Who's that
Why's he bleeding
Clear the dock, Edgar
Captain Sharp motions for the two old fishermen to get out of the way
He and Scout Master Ward run with the stretcher onto the dock
Mrs
Bishop is frantic: Is Suzy with you
No, she's in the woods with Shakusky
Gadge points toward the hills
man wearing a jumpsuit and aviator sunglasses stands next to the seaplane
He is Jed
He shouts as the stretcher approaches: Where'm  going
The infirmary at Fort Lebanon
We'll be right behind you
47
Captain Sharp motions for Skotak, Gadge, and Lazy-eye to help Jed load the stretcher into the small cockpit
He tosses a set of keys to Scout Master Ward and says: Warm up the motor
'll be right back
Scout Master Ward takes the keys and starts untying the police launch
Captain Sharp heads toward his office
Mr
Bishop says firmly: Hold it right there
You're not leaving this island
Our daughter's been abducted by one these beige lunatics
Walt, it's very clear: the two of them conspired in this together
Don't worry, Mr
Bishop
She'll be safe
Sam's got excellent wilderness skills
Mr
Bishop wheels on Scout Master Ward
He explodes: Why can't you control your scouts
Scout Master Ward recoils
He says quietly, troubled: 'm trying
Mr
Bishop takes off his shoe and throws it at Scout Master Ward
Scout Master Ward ducks, and the shoe bounces off his back
Captain Sharp blocks Mr
Bishop
Stop
Mr
Bishop scuffles with Captain Sharp
Mrs
Bishop jerks him backwards and shouts: Stop it, Walt
Mr
Bishop faces Mrs
Bishop and Captain Sharp, breathing heavily
Scout Master Ward looks depressed
Jed, Gadge, Skotak, and Redford watch frozen from a gangplank alongside the seaplane
48
do blame him -- (pointing to Scout Master Ward) -- but  also blame myself and both of you
With all due respect: you can't let your children stab people
() What are you talking about
She's violent, Mrs
Bishop
Look
Scout Master Ward shows Mrs
Bishop the blood all over his hands and uniform
Mrs
Bishop looks confused
don't get it
Were there witnesses
Of course
It's assault
beg your pardon
Are you a lawyer
No, ma'am, but -- () Well,  am
Captain Sharp gently draws Mrs
Bishop away by the shoulder
He links arms with her as he tries to placate the group: Easy does it
Calm down, Laura
Stay away from my wife
Mr
Bishop pushes Captain Sharp away from Mrs
Bishop into Scout Master Ward
Scout Master Ward lunges at Mr
Bishop but is intercepted by Captain Sharp and Mrs
Bishop
They shout : /
/ Dammit
Christ
Shit
Jesus
At this moment, a voice interjects from the shore: 49
(
) Excuse me
Excuse me
Excuse me, Captain Sharp
Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Mr
and Mrs
Bishop stop fighting and turn around at once
They see: the narrator
He stands at the foot of the dock holding a journal with rubber bands wrapped around it
They all stare at him blankly
He continues: As some of you know,  taught Sam for the cartography Accomplishment Patch
He's a smart boy, and he expressed a keen interest in the history of the island's indigenous peoples
In particular, recall his fascination with the idea of retracing the original path of the old Chickchaw harvest migration
Long pause
Everyone looks utterly perplexed
The propeller of the seaplane starts up, and they all shield their eyes from the blast of wind and dust
The narrator hesitates
He yells over the noise: What 'm getting at is this:  think know where they're going
The narrator removes the rubber bands from his journal
: carefully hand-drafted nautical chart
cove is marked with a red arrow and the caption Mile 3
25 Tidal Inlet
: The portable record player
Suzy's fingers place the needle onto a spinning disc
small cove enclosed by a low, rocky cliff
It forms an almost complete circle and is overgrown with vines, flowers, and branches
thin channel leads out to the ocean
The sand on the shore is white, and the water is perfectly clear and crowded with shells at the bottom
Birds echo and fly from tree to tree
Sam's and Suzy's luggage is piled on the beach
The kitten wanders, exploring
The lid of the portable record player is open
The voice of Leonard Bernstein says over the speaker: 50
(
) Onto the bird-house, where every kind of bird imaginable is whirling and wheeling around
This is a real acrobatic act for our gifted young flute player, Paula Robeson
As they listen, Sam and Suzy take off their shoes and socks and run in opposite directions around the edge of the cove
They each climb up a rock over the water
They look at each other across the lagoon
They both laugh
Suzy shouts, : This is weird
know
Sam takes off his coon-skin cap and throws it aside
Suzy removes her cardigan and drops it on the ground
Sam strips off his uniform down to his white briefs
Suzy take off everything except her underwear and a training bra
They throw their clothes into the water
Sam yells: On three
Suzy immediately counts very quickly
They both scream as they leap into the water
They swim toward each other, laughing and shouting
: clothesline hung with Sam's and Suzy's wet clothes swaying like flags and snapping in the wind
The tent has been pitched on a low, sandy plateau close to the water
Two lines of shells mark a path to the entrance
long stick is jammed into the ground with a flickering safety-candle stuck into the  at the top
The kitten is asleep
Sam sits on a folding stool in front of a portable easel
He dips his brush into a tin cup and paints
Suzy poses stretched out and propped up on one arm
She adjusts herself slightly
like it here, but  don't like the name
Me, neither
51
Mile 3
25 Tidal Inlet
It's got no ring to it
Let's change it
What should it be
Let me think for a minute
Sam continues to paint while Suzy thinks
: binocular shot of a deep blue, star-filled sky
Suzy lies on her back on a flat rock in the middle of the cove looking up into the night
Sam wades out to her and climbs up beside her
made you some jewelry
Sam holds up two dead, shimmering, opalescent beetles with fish-hooks threaded into their shells
Suzy looks enchanted
Are your ears pierced
: Inside the tent, lit by a lantern
Sam clenches his teeth as he forces one of the fish-hooks through Suzy's earlobe
Suzy screams murderously
Sam releases her
The beetle dangles neatly
line of blood runs down the side of Suzy's neck
Sam holds up a little mirror
Suzy nods
It's pretty
Do the other one
Sam switches to Suzy's other earlobe
She resumes her screaming
: Sam and Suzy standing on the beach listening to the French singer's record
They face each other, bobbing their heads and tilting awkwardly to the music
Suzy eventually begins to dance
Sam does something vaguely like the Twist
They press against each other and kiss
Suzy says quietly: It feels hard
52
() Do you mind
like it
() Tilt your head sideways
Sam and Suzy kiss again
Sam pushes his hands through Suzy's hair and draws it back behind her ears
Suzy whispers: You can touch my chest
Sam slides his hand up under the training bra and presses it onto Suzy's breast
They're going to grow more
Sam nods
He looks to be in a trance
: Sam and Suzy sitting on a tree branch over the water eating raisins from Sam's hand
Suzy has flowers in her hair
She looks down into the water with her binoculars
Why do you always use binoculars
Suzy thinks for minute
She says finally: It helps me see things closer
Even if they're not very far away
pretend it's my magic power
() That sounds like poetry
Poems don't always have to rhyme, you know
They're just supposed to be creative
Suzy gives Sam the binoculars
He points them at her and stares
What do you want to be
When you grow up
53
don't know
want to go on adventures, think
Not get stuck in one place
How about you
() Go on adventures, too
Not get stuck, too
guess that sounds almost like 'm just repeating what you just said, but couldn't think of anything as good as it
On the other hand, maybe we'll get blown up by an atom bomb
You can't predict the exact future
That's true
It's possible  may wet the bed, by the way
Later,  mean
() () wish  didn't have to mention it, but just in case
don't want to make you be offended
() Of course,  won't
Some people frown on these problems
Suzy nods
She holds Sam's hand
She points to the scorpion brooch pinned to Sam's shirt
What's that one for
Sam looks at the brooch
He shakes his head
It's not an accomplishment
inherited it from my mother
It's actually not meant for a male to wear -- but  don't give a damn
Suzy nods thoughtfully
Pause
54
Are your foster parents still mad at you
For getting in trouble so much
don't think so
We're getting to know each other better
feel like 'm in a family now
Not like yours, but similar to one
always wished  was an orphan
Most of my favorite characters are
think your lives are more special
Sam frowns
Tears suddenly well-up in his eyes
He shakes his head
love you, but you don't know what you're talking about
Long pause
Suzy says genuinely: love you, too
: campfire burns in front of the tent
Sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe while Suzy sits Indian-style next to him
She reads aloud from a book called The Light of Seven Matchsticks
There is an illustration on the cover of a child's hand extinguishing a little flame ribbon of smoke curls between its fingers
The flashlight's beam drew a moon through the black across the attic and settled on a gap in the base-board
mouse-hole, no bigger than a pocket-watch
Eric crouched on his flat feet and placed his hand in front of the tiny opening
"It's windy," he said
"Like someone in there's blowing on my fingers
" Christy rolled her eyes and sighed a sigh
He's right again, she thought
Little brothers drive people crazy
Suzy looks to Sam to see if he is still awake
Sam nods and signals for Suzy to continue
Suzy turns the page and reads : 55
Part Two
: The next morning
Sam and Suzy are asleep with their arms wrapped around each other inside the tent
They wear only their underwear
The sound of an airplane approaches
Sam's eyes open
The noise buzzes by loudly overhead
Suzy sits up
Sam scrambles to his feet, unzips the flaps of the tent, and looks out
Suzy crouches beside him, holding onto his leg
: Captain Sharp standing on the beach fifteen feet away
Scout Master Ward waits behind him with Gadge, Skotak, and Lazy- Eye
Mr
and Mrs
Bishop stride up out of the water
Mr
Bishop looks incensed
They are wet to the waist
The police launch is moored in the lagoon
Two larger boats with St
Jack Wood Fire Brigade printed on their hulls float further away
Men in red caps stand on their decks
Suzy pulls Sam back inside
She zips up the tent again
She kisses Sam
Mr
Bishop hollers: Suzy
Get out here
Mr
Bishop grabs hold of the entire tent by the top and rips it up out of the ground, uprooting the stakes which go flying
This reveals: Sam and Suzy, half-naked, entwined, kissing
Mr
and Mrs
Bishop both freeze
Sam and Suzy look up to them
Mr
Bishop growls and roars at them ferociously like a monster
Sam and Suzy look horrified
Mr
Bishop's face suddenly drains of all emotion
Pause
Mrs
Bishop commands Sam and Suzy: Put your clothes on
Both of you
Sam and Suzy remain perfectly still
Mrs
Bishop grabs Suzy by the arm and jerks her to her feet
Sam and Suzy hang onto each other
Mrs
Bishop slaps Suzy with a whack
Sam lets go, and Suzy is gone
Scout Master Ward comes over to Sam sadly and hands him his uniform
Sam takes it
Scout Master Ward turns to the other scouts, claps his hands twice, and says: 56
Strike this camp
Sam starts putting on his socks
Captain Sharp watches him
Captain Sharp drives his boat along the coast with a grim look on his face
Suzy rides in the back with Mr
and Mrs
Bishop
Sam rides in the front with the other scouts
An interrogation is in progress: How long were you planning to stay there
don't know
You said ten days or less
That was a lie
Didn't you ever think about what would happen next
Not to my recollection
You're a traitor to our family
Good
want to be
Scout Master Ward sits next to Captain Sharp
He shows him the air-mail envelope
What do  do about this
Captain Sharp shrugs
He says, resigned: Give him his mail
Scout Master Ward turns to Sam
He holds out the envelope
Sam takes it
He opens it
He reads
Suzy watches him from across the boat
She calls out anxiously: What does it say
57
() They can't invite me back
() Why not
() gave them too much aggravation
Suzy stands up
She says as she starts across the boat: Let me read it
Sam holds out the note
Mr
Bishop pulls Suzy back down to her seat
He stands up, himself, and walks over to Sam
He takes him by the wrist and leads him to a small cabin
He opens the door and presses him forward
Sam stumbles down the steps and looks back
Mr
Bishop shuts the door
Captain Sharp glares at him
Suzy says icily: That's child abuse
Mr
Bishop returns to the back of the boat and sits down again
He gives Suzy a direct order: Be advised: the two of you will never see each other again
Those were your last words
Do you understand
() 'd be careful if  were you
One of these days somebody's going to be pushed too far, and who knows what they're capable of
() Is that a threat
() It's a warning
Suzy looks from Captain Sharp to Mrs
Bishop and back to Mr
Bishop
Mr
Bishop falls silent
58
wish  knew what makes you tick
() beg your pardon
Please, terminate this conversation
( ) She's saying that to me
Lionel shakes his head bitterly
Suzy stares out to sea
Scout Master Ward walks over to the cabin, opens the door, and goes inside
small room with two bunks, two portholes, and a pile of ropes
Sam sits hunched over with his hands in his lap
He stares at the envelope
Scout Master Ward sits down across from him
He motions to the envelope and says quietly, pausing between each sentence: 'm sorry about this
didn't know your situation
It's not on the register
How'd you lose your parents
shouldn't ask that
Never mind
wish we had time for an inspection back there
On the beach
would've given you a "commendable"
That was one of the best- pitched camp-sites 've ever seen
Honestly
Sam does not respond
Scout Master Ward asks in a wounded : You don't want to be a Khaki Scout anymore
Sam shakes his head
Becky sits at the switchboard with her head-phones on
Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward sit behind her wearing their own sets of head-phones
There is a click on the other end of the line
59
(
) Hello, Becky
Judy,  have your person-to-person from New Penzance
(
) Go ahead, New Penzance
: Split-screen
On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Becky
On the other side, we see a fifty-year-old woman in a blue and white uniform pants-suit with a Salvation Army officer-style hat and a red ribbon tied in a bow around her neck
She is Social Services
She sits at a desk in a cinder block office
Guards and orderlies criss- cross in a bullet-proof window to a long, grey corridor behind her
Hello
This is Captain Sharp
Social Services flips open a file-folder and picks up a ball- point pen
(She takes notes throughout the conversation
) She says into her telephone: Hello, Captain Sharp
This is Social Services
'm calling in reference to Sam Shakusky, Ward of the State
understand he's in your custody
That's correct
What's his condition
Has he suffered any injury or trauma of any kind
He's
Very good
How do  get to you
The fastest way is by seaplane
Jed can bring you in with the mail
'll come tomorrow morning, if that's acceptable to you
Is someone able to () 60
(cont'd) provide reasonable care and nourishment for the boy until that time
Uh-huh
Is that a yes
Uh-huh
Very good
'll contact you again before the end of the day
Social Services starts to hang up the telephone
Captain Sharp says abruptly: Wait a second
() Yes
Social Services
() Captain Sharp
() What's going to happen to him
Pause
Social Services puts down her pen
She clasps her hands together in front of her
She says finally: Well, normally, we'd try to place him in another foster home, but that option is no longer available to us, in my opinion, with his case history -- which means he'll go to Juvenile Refuge
Captain Sharp exchanges a look with Scout Master Ward
Scout Master Ward interjects: What's that
An orphanage
Social Services frowns
She asks calmly: 61
Who's speaking
This is Scout Master Ward
Social Services refers to a document in her file-folder
She nods
Right
An orphanage -- but the first step is the admissions panel requires a psychological evaluation to determine whether or not the boy's a candidate for institutional treatment or electroshock therapy
Beyond that -- () Excuse me
Shock therapy
Why would that be necessary
He's not violent
Social Services picks up the document
She points to it
The report describes an assault with scissors
() That was the girl
Who did that
() Well, maybe she needs help, too -- but that's not our job
( ) Social Service hangs up the telephone
Becky pulls the cords out of their sockets
Scout Master Ward looks to Captain Sharp
Silence
Becky opens a tin of home-made lemon bars
Captain Sharp declines one
Scout Master Ward tries one
He looks completely enchanted
' The living room
There is a wicker rocking chair, a vase filled with wilted wildflowers, and a portrait of some 62
Pilgrims hanging over a stone fireplace
Lionel, Murray, and Rudy sit together on the floor playing Parchesi
Mr
Bishop lurches into the doorway, shirtless
He carries an open bottle of red wine with a glass in one hand and a long- handled woodsman's axe in the other
'll be out back
Lionel, Murray, and Lionel look up from their game
Mr
Bishop hesitates
He seems slightly disoriented
'm going to find a tree to chop down
Mr
Bishop exits
Pause
Lionel rolls a pair of dice
' Old linoleum floor
Dark curtainless window
One bare light bulb
Suzy sits erect in the bathtub staring blankly into space
Mrs
Bishop washes her with a soapy sponge
Suzy's clothes and leather folder are in the corner with the kitten scratching at them
do know what you're feeling, Suzy-bean
've had moments myself where  say: what am  doing here
Who made this decision
How could  allow myself to do something so stupid -- ( ) -- and why is it still happening
We women are more emotional
You have to -- Suzy turns to Mrs
Bishop and interrupts: hate you
() Don't say "hate"
Why not
mean it
You think you mean it
In this moment
You're trying to hurt me
63
Exactly
() know what you do with that sad, dumb police man
You go to bed with him
Mrs
Bishop looks stunned
She says quietly: He's not dumb, but  guess he is kind of sad
Anyway, we shouldn't discuss that
It's not appropriate for me to even acknowledge what  already just said
Mrs
Bishop sees something sticking out of the leather folder
She pulls it out and stares at it
It is the "Coping with the Very Troubled Child" pamphlet
She looks to Suzy
Suzy looks away
Mrs
Bishop sighs deeply and says, on the verge of tears: Poor Suzy
Why is everything so hard for you
Suzy starts to cry
She covers her face
Her voice breaks as : We're in love
We just want to be together
What's wrong with that
Mrs
Bishop puts her arms around Suzy
Suzy shakes, silently sobbing
Mrs
Bishop pulls some twigs and stems out of Suzy's hair
She studies the beetle earrings
She says wearily: Oh, my God
How are we going to get these fish-hooks out
Captain Sharp cooks sausages on a skillet in a kitchenette
He has a bottle of beer in his hand
Sam sits waiting at a fold-out table with a glass of milk in front of him
He says without looking up: admit we knew we'd get in trouble
That part's true
We knew people would be worried, and we still ran away, anyway -- but something also happened which we didn't do on purpose
When we first met each other
Something happened to us
64
Captain Sharp stirs the sausages in the pan
He nods
He says : agree with you
That's eloquent can't argue against anything you're saying -- but  don't have to, because you're twelve years old
Captain Sharp brings the skillet to the table and serves three links onto one plate and three onto another
He sits down
Look, let's face it, you're probably a much more intelligent person than  am
In fact,  guarantee it -- but even smart kids sometimes stick their fingers in electrical sockets, if you see what mean
It takes time to figure things out
It's been proven by history: all mankind makes mistakes
It's our job to try to protect you from the dangerous ones
If we can
Captain Sharp pours an inch of beer into a glass and slides it over to Sam
You want a slug
Sam nods
He and Captain Sharp both drink sips
Captain Sharp asks gently and sincerely: What's the rush
You've got your whole life in front of yourself
Ahead of you, mean
() Maybe so
Anyway, you're a bachelor
() What does that have to do with it
So are you
() That's true
Did you love someone ever
65
() Yes,  did
What happened
She didn't love me back
Ah
Sam considers this
Captain Sharp looks depressed
They start eating their sausages
Captain Sharp says quietly: 'm sorry for your loss
Anyway, that's what people say
Thanks
What happened
drunk truck driver smashed into them
() Good grief
Silence
Captain Sharp refills both their beer glasses
' Scout Master Ward sits on his cot in his pajamas again with a cigarette in his mouth
His tape recorder is recording
He says into the microphone: Scout Master's Log
September fourth
Scout Master Ward hesitates
He thinks for a minute
He takes a deep breath
He closes his eyes
He opens them again
He looks desperate
He looks up at the ceiling
He shakes his head
He presses stop
He kneels on the floor with his palms together and smokes
There is a slight commotion outside
Scout Master Ward : 66
Stow it, out there
want to hear some 's
The fort sixty feet above the camp
It is still under construction
The entire troop (with the exceptions of Redford and Sam) has gathered for a clandestine meeting
They all wear pajamas
Skotak stands on a balcony with his back to the group and his hands on a wooden railing
heard he's going to reform school
heard they're going to take out a piece of his brain and send him to an insane asylum
like his girl
She's too scruffy for me
Supposedly, they got to third base
- That's not true
He just felt her up
( ) Over-shirt or under-shirt
Skotak slams his fist on the railing
Everyone looks startled
Skotak turns around to face the group
He says : Damn us
The railing collapses behind Skotak, ripping part of a wall and a row of shingles off the structure as it falls away
There is a moment of silence before it hits the ground with a splintering thud
Skotak hesitates
He moves a half-step away from the edge
He continues: This troop has been very shabby to Field Mate Sam Shakusky
In fact, we've been a bunch of mean jerks
Why's he so unpopular
admit, supposedly, he's () 67
(') emotionally disturbed -- but he's also a disadvantaged orphan
How would you feel
Skotak moves among the group, looking from face to face, as : Nickleby
Deluca
Lazy-Eye
(from the heart) Gadge
Skotak circles around the edge of the tree house
He says : He's a fellow Khaki Scout, and he needs our help
Are we man enough to give that
So part of his brain doesn't get removed out of him
Skotak stands still
He says mysteriously: They were prepared to die for each other out there
Silence
The other scouts begin to murmur to each other, shaking their heads, shrugging, whispering, and gesturing
Finally, Deluca looks up to Skotak
What do you need
() For starters
Three yards of chicken wire, some ripped-up newspapers, and a bucket of wheatpaste
' thick tree has been chopped almost completely through its trunk
For some reason, it remains standing
Mr
Bishop sits on the ground leaning against it
He breathes heavily
The axe rests across his lap
twig snaps
Mr
Bishop looks up, listening
Pause
He drinks a sip of wine
In the background, on the other side of the lawn, five small silhouettes run silently in a row away from the house into the trees on the left
moment later, one taller silhouette rides a bicycle silently away from the house into the trees on the right
68
Captain Sharp sits on the hood of his station wagon
Mrs
Bishop leans against it with her bicycle in front of her
They smoke cigarettes
Captain Sharp says sadly: In other words, it's over
guess so
For the moment
Until further notice
That's right
understand
've got to do better
For everybody
Except me
Except you
() Well,  hope you can
think you will
You're doing the right thing
Pause
Captain Sharp suddenly slides his hand inside Mrs
Bishop's shirt onto her breast and simultaneously kisses her -- then just as suddenly gets into his car and starts the engine
Mrs
Bishop hesitates
She reaches inside the window and puts her hand on the top of Captain Sharp's head
She says, worried: Who know what's going to happen, Duffy
'll probably see you tomorrow
() No, you won't
Silence
The motor idles
Captain Sharp says distantly: 69
admire them, you know
There's a purity to it
only feel bad because they both seem like such unhappy, lonely, miserable people -- but maybe that's romantic
() don't see it that way
Captain Sharp puts the car into gear and drives off
Mrs
Bishop finishes her cigarette
She gets on her bicycle and rides away
burning match drops down into the fireplace near the foot of a bunk where Sam lies sleeping
He has the sheet pulled up to his chin, but his toes stick out
He opens one eye
Dust descends and settles
Something scrapes and scratches
The flame burns out
Sam slides slowly off the mattress and creeps across the floor
He crouches in front of the fireplace
He flicks on a scout flashlight and sees: The end of a hanging rope
Sam leans quickly into the fireplace and looks straight up, shining his flashlight
Skotak is looking down at him from the top of the chimney
He puts his finger to his lips
Sam : Get out of my chimney
Listen to me
We're here for friendship
We're going to get you off this island
( ) No, thanks
Yes, thanks
This is an emergency rescue
It's worthless to me
There's no point
Not without Suzy
Skotak gestures for Sam to wait
He disappears from view moment later, Suzy's face appears at the top of the chimney, smiling toothily
Sam looks ecstatic
70
How'd you get here
They snuck me down the laundry chute and left a paper-mache dummy in my bed
() Diversion tactics
Good thinking
: The next room
Captain Sharp sleeps in boxer shorts on the floor of the kitchenette in the dark
He snores quietly
Five mini-canoes race across a wide, choppy strait close to the open sea
Skotak, Deluca, Nickleby, Gadge, Lazy-Eye, Panagle, Roosevelt, Chef, and Izod paddle aggressively
We hear in voice-over: (
) Where we going
(
) Fort Lebanon
My cousin Ben runs the Supply and Resources outpost for the Jubilee
He's a Falcon Scout, Legionnaire
Cousin Ben'll know what to do
(
) Can we trust him
(
) Normally, 'd say no
Sam and Suzy ride in the back of the canoe that Skotak rows
Sam has his arms around Suzy's waist
The kitten is on her shoulder
Sam sees the portable record player among Suzy's things
Did you leave another note for Lionel
Not this time
He can't keep his trap shut
Besides, 'll probably never see him again
71
That's true
: pebble beach below high dunes
Large waves sweep into the shore
Spray blows through the air
There is a black lighthouse on a rocky point in the distance
The narrator stands at the water's edge holding a meteorologist's measuring stick
He braces himself against the gusting winds
He speaks to the camera: This is the island of St
Jack Wood, extending far north from Land's End along the deep-water channel that leads to Broken Rock
low flood-plain separates the beach from the town-ship above small but prosperous community
The narrator takes out a pocket barometer
He reads it
He : The barometer reads twenty-seven inches and dropping
Strong winds, as you can see, already at twenty-two knots
(checks his watch) The time is now four thirty-five
The narrator walks quickly out of the shot
The five canoes land on the beach with the tide
Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop quickly jump out and drag the boats up the shore
' The room is black
Mr
and Mrs
Bishop lie in separate single beds side-by-side

Henderson
It was sustained
Good

Bishop's voice breaks as she says quietly: 'm sorry, Walt
It's not your fault

Whichever ones still hurt
() Half of those were self-inflicted

Bishop shakes her head and smiles with tears on her face

Bishop has a lump in his throat as he says: hope the roof flies off, and  get sucked up into space

Bishop look across at each other in the dark
Mrs
Bishop says desperately: We're all they've got, Walt
Mr
Bishop takes a deep breath
He says finally, with a : 73
It's not enough
Flashlight and lantern flames flicker over the jagged walls
Skotak is curled in a blanket on a high rock
Gadge is tucked into a sleeping bag under a ledge
The troop nestle on rocks and ledges in bedrolls and sleeping bags all around the deep cavern
Sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe while Suzy sits Indian-style next to him
She reads aloud from a book called Annabelle's Midnight
There is an illustration on the cover of a blonde girl climbing out a window onto a trellis with fireflies circling around her
"-- but 'm not going," said Barnaby Jack
"'m running away tonight for good, and this time  won't get caught
" Annabelle whispered: "'m coming with you
" Her yellow hair, now brown at the roots, caught up in the wind and danced
Barnaby Jack took Annabelle's hand and pressed something into it the size of a jellybean
"Hide this in your socks, and be ready at midnight
" Suzy looks to Sam to see if he is still awake
Sam looks to the rest of the troop to see if they are still awake
They all nod and signal for Suzy to continue
Suzy turns the page and reads on: He leapt out the window and landed in the fresh-fallen snow
The next morning
Camp Ivanhoe
Scout Master Ward emerges from his tent
He puts on his hat
The wind whips it off his head
He chases it, catches it, and puts it back on with the chin-strap tight
He frowns
He shouts: No bugle
No reveille
Lazy-eye, Gadge, Deluca, Izod
Where's my troop
Let's go
You're late
Scout Master Ward tries to light a cigarette, but the match blows out
He walks past the latrine, the workbench, the row of smaller tents, and the charcoal grill
He throws his hands into the air

Chef
Breakfast
Scout Master Ward shakes his head
He arrives at the picnic table and rings his bell
He sits down
He opens a new issue of Indian Corn
There is a picture on the cover of a scout troop rappelling in Tasmania
He struggles to keep the rippling pages from turning by themselves
: The first page
There is another drawing of the Scout Master- in-Chief
This time he is behind the wheel of a ship
His signature below, once again, reads Commander Pierce
There is a quotation in large text: "Anyone can hold the helm when the sea is calm
" Pause
Scout Master Ward lowers his magazine
He looks around, confused
Something dawns on him
small entourage of teenage scouts studies maps, charts, and documents at folding tables
One of them sits at a telegraph machine
He wears headphones and taps Morse code on a paddle as he listens to a transmission
He looks puzzled
He swivels his chair to a steno-machine and begins typing rapidly
triple-sized tent with a canopy in front and a large totem pole looming over it
It stands on five-foot stilts
There is a school bus parked next to it with letters painted across its side which read Regional Jubilee
forty-five-year-old scout master with several medals on his chest is sharpening a straight razor
He is Secretary McIntire
He adjusts a hot towel on the face of a man in a barber's chair
The young telegraph operator hurries out of the tent carrying a strip of paper
He hands it to Secretary McIntire
Secretary McIntire stares at it
He says to the man under the : You're not going to believe this one, sir
That Scout Master on New Penzance
Has now lost his entire troop
The seated man whips the towel off his face and rises to his feet
He is Commander Pierce himself
He has silver hair, a moustache, and a much greater number of medals
He says in disbelief as he snatches the slip of paper: 75
Well, 'll be damned
Who is this bimbo
() couldn't say
Commander Pierce shakes his head
He continues to study the document as he sits back down
Secretary McIntire begins to lather his cheeks with a brush
: vast archway of wood, straw, and rope construction
Fort Lebanon is spelled out across the top with bound sticks large flag waving madly on a pole reads Khaki Scouts of North America
bugler on a platform plays the familiar staccato tattoo
It echoes for miles
Sam and Suzy wait inside the gates crouched behind a row of trash cans with the rest of the troop except Skotak
They shiver
Sam has on his back-pack
Suzy carries her suitcase
Gadge holds a tennis ball can
scout master in an Indian chief's headdress stops as he walks by
He looks curiously at Sam and especially Suzy
He says to Nickleby: Who's your unit leader
Pause
Nickleby points to a fat man in an apron cooking hamburgers on a grill
That guy
The scout master shrugs
Skotak comes over and says : There's a broken gum-ball machine behind the snack tent
Skotak distributes a handful of gum-balls among Sam, Suzy, and the rest of the troop
They all put them in their mouths
Skotak motions for everyone to follow him
footbridge across a stream leads to a Quonset hut with an awning in front labelled Supply Tent
crowd of very young scouts waits at a wide counter bartering over boxes of food, drink, and equipment
team of helpers collects money and packages goods
At the center, there is a twenty-year-old 76
scout with a pencil behind his ear
He is Cousin Ben
He says to a nine-year-old Junior Khaki: don't care how they do it where you come from
You want pop
You want candy
You want a snake-bite kit
Get some money
Skotak appears and whispers something to Cousin Ben
Cousin Ben nods
He says to his customers: Come back in five minutes
Cousin Ben pulls a curtain shut behind the counter
Sam, Suzy, Skotak and the rest of the troop follow Cousin Ben briskly out a door and onto a cat-walk that runs along the top of a wall made from tall, pointed logs
As they talk, they walk past dozens of rows and clusters of tents grouped by color in the fields below
They walk past towers, huts, ladders, latrines, and a catapult under construction
They walk past a white infirmary with a red cross on it and a doctor taking a boy's blood pressure
They walk past a fleet of small, antique sailboats flying assorted troop banners
Five hundred scouts and fifty scout masters work, eat, talk, cook, and play sports and games all around the compound in spite of the fierce winds
One group rides motorcycles, another fires model rockets, another flies by overhead on a cable-trolley
Cousin Ben points to Sam and asks Skotak over the sound of : Is this him
Field Mate Sam Shakusky, Troop 55, resigned
He's hot
Almost too hot
What's in the can
Seventy-six dollars -- but it's mostly in nickels
Give it to me
77
Skotak motions for Gadge to hand Cousin Ben the tennis ball can
It appears to be very heavy and jingles as it moves
Cousin Ben takes it
He says to Sam: You badge in seamanship
Yes, sir
Sam points to one of the patches on his sash
It has an anchor embroidered on it
Good
There's cold-water crabber moored off Broken Rock
The skipper owes me an We'll see if he can take you on as a claw cracker
It won't be an easy life, but it's better than shock therapy
Thank you, sir
By the way, where's the chapel tent
Cousin Ben hesitates
He points behind them with his thumb: Back there, but the padre's home with the mumps
Why do you ask
want to bring my wife
Cousin Ben stops walking
He looks Sam up and down
Suzy says : But we're not married yet
Cousin Ben turns to Suzy
He looks back to Sam and back to Suzy again
You his girl
Suzy nods
Cousin Ben looks intrigued
He says tentatively: Technically, 'm a civil-law scrivener
'm authorized to declare births, deaths, and marriages
You're kind of young
You got a license
78
Sam and Suzy shake their heads
Cousin Ben nods
He speaks more gently now: can't offer you a legally binding union
It won't hold up in the state, the county, or, frankly, any courtroom in the world due to your age, lack of a license, and failure to get parental consent -- but the ritual does carry a very important moral weight within yourselves
You can't enter into this lightly
Do you love each other
Sam and Suzy immediately nod
Cousin Ben continues: Are you sure you're ready for this
Sam and Suzy immediately nod
Cousin Ben looks perturbed
Let me rephrase it
() We're in a hurry
() Spit out the gum, sister
In fact, everybody
Cousin Ben puts out his hand
Suzy spits her gum into his palm
He throws it away over his shoulder
Sam and the rest of the troop spit their gum out on the ground
Cousin Ben : don't like the snappy attitude
This is the most important decision you've made in your lives
Now go over by that trampoline and talk it through before you give me another quick answer
Cousin Ben watches as Sam and Suzy walk away and stand next to a large trampoline
small scout jumps from a high ladder, bounces, and does a back-flip
: Sam and Suzy uncertain how to begin the conversation
Sam shrugs
79
guess we better try to pretend we're struggling over our decision for a minute before we go back over there and tell him -- Maybe he's right
It could be a mistake
Sam looks stunned
He is speechless
He stammers: What
Why
How
Being married
Sometimes it seems sad to me
It might be better to just go steady permanently
Sam shakes his head
He looks off into the distance
He says : don't know what to say
: Cousin Ben counting nickels in the tennis ball can
He jerks his thumb toward Sam and Suzy and says dismissively: guess they're probably just trying to pretend they're struggling over their decision, but at least -- Woah
Cousin Ben looks
Suzy has her hands around Sam's throat and is throttling him
Sam squirms loose and calms her down
The troop watches transfixed
Sam takes a snapshot out of his pocket and shows it to Suzy, explaining
Suzy nods
They come back over to the group
There are tears on Suzy's cheeks
She says to Cousin Ben: We're sure
Let's do a blood test
Cousin Ben stands at a collapsible altar
He wears a purple, silk stole around his neck with crosses stitched into it
Sam 80
and Suzy hold a Bible with their hands on it
Skotak and the rest of troop listen solemnly as Cousin Ben reads from a : -- which we hereby consecrate on this day, the fifth of September, 1965
( ) That's the end of the short-form
Do any of the witnesses have objections or remarks
Usually, they don't
Skotak raises his hand
Cousin Ben reluctantly calls on him: Skotak
Can we loan them the nickels
'm worried about their future
() That's my fee
Skotak and the rest of the troop look very concerned
They murmur to each other: What's going to happen to them
Nobody knows
Let's take a vote
All in favor -- () That's my fee
Skotak and the rest of the troop look to Cousin Ben
Cousin Ben glares at them
He sighs
He points to Skotak
You're just like your brothers
, give them the tennis ball can
Cousin Ben points to the tennis ball can on the floor next to his feet
Skotak takes it and zips it into a side-pocket of 81
Sam's back-pack
Cousin Ben hands Sam and Suzy a receipt on a clipboard
Sign here -- and initial here and here
Sam and Suzy sign and initial
Cousin Ben tears out a copy
Take the carbon
Leave the Bible
Let's go
Sam and Suzy turn and walk out of the chapel tent holding hands
They do not smile
Cousin Ben, Skotak, and the rest of the troop follow them with grave expressions on their faces
Sam touches Suzy's hair
Suzy kisses Sam's hand
They walk as a group through the camp
Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop wait at the end of a narrow dock
Cousin Ben stands below them in a small sailboat
He reaches up to Suzy and lifts her onboard
He reaches up to Sam and lifts him onboard, too
He rigs the sail
Sam smiles sadly
He and Skotak do the secret handshake
The others quickly join in
Suzy blows them a kiss
Everyone looks choked up
Cousin Ben unloops a line
The sails quickly catch the strong wind, and the boat sails away into the harbor
Skotak and the rest of troop wave and salute
They watch, bittersweet
Pause
Where they going again
He's going to work on a shrimper, if understand correctly
() wish them well
- Me, too
Me, too
Skotak sighs
He turns and starts up the dock
The others follow him
Roosevelt hesitates
He points
82
think they're coming back
Skotak and the rest of the troop stop and turn around
The sailboat glides back in
Sam leaps onto the dock with the tennis ball can
Suzy looks worried
Cousin Ben yells: Be quick, sailor
() What happened
() She left her binoculars on a hook in the chapel tent
() Just leave them
Sam sprints up the dock
He yells back over his shoulder: We can't
It's her magic power
: binocular shot of Sam running full-speed through the compound
He approaches quickly -- then skids to a stop
Redford blocks the entrance
He is dressed in white hospital pajamas with a red cross on the breast pocket
His side is heavily bandaged and his arm is attached to an / drip
He lowers Suzy's binoculars
Sam stands frozen in front of Redford
Redford stares at him icily
Sam starts to say something -- then pauses
He says, : You killed your dog, by the way
() Snoopy
() Well, it couldn't be helped
Sam nods
He asks quietly: 83
Why do you consider me your enemy
Redford frowns
He says in disbelief: Because your girlfriend stabbed me in the back with lefty scissors
She's my wife now
Congratulations
'm saying before that
Six weeks ago
From day one
What'd  do wrong
'm trying to understand
( ) Why don't you like me
( ) Why should
Nobody else does
Sam runs up to Redford and pokes him as hard as he can in the scissor cut with his finger
Redford screams
Scouts and scout masters everywhere stop what they are doing and look to the chapel tent
Across the compound, Commander Pierce comes out of his tent, alerted
Sam whips the binoculars out of Redford's hands, turns away, and sprints
No one moves anywhere except Sam dashing toward the marina
Redford shouts at the top of his lungs: He's here
The fugitive
Stop him
An emergency alarm sounds
The entire camp swings into action
Two teams of scouts playing capture-the-flag descend from both sides and cut Sam off from the dock
They wear red and yellow jerseys over their uniforms
Suzy jumps out of the boat onto the dock
Sam sees her beyond the blockade of scouts
She waves her arms
Sam throws up his hands
He sprints in a new direction, onto a wide field
There is a small, pink flag on a thin stick stuck in the ground at the center of a plastic ring
Sam grabs it as he runs past
He looks back and sees: 84
mob of fifty scouts chasing him
He circles in a giant figure eight trailed by the huge group
He races up a hill and stops at the top
Sam looks down at the approaching scouts and hundreds of others watching
dark cloud rolls in casting a giant shadow over the entire camp
Sam throws the little flag down at his pursuers like a javelin
It sails in an arc and pokes down into the grass
There is a thunderclap
Sam looks up into the sky
bolt of lightning strikes him
Sam is thrown ten feet through the air and lands on his back
The tennis ball can explodes nickels
The mob of scouts stops with a jolt
They look terrified
Sam sits up
He is covered in black soot
His shoes are on fire
He shakes them off his feet
Suzy runs through the crowd of scouts and drops down on her knees in front of Sam
She looks astonished
Sam says : 'm
Suzy helps Sam to his feet
Sam raises Suzy's smoldering binoculars to his eyes
Skotak and the rest of the troop join them
: binocular shot of a ladder leaning against a high fence
: Follow me
Sam leads Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop fly at a sprint to the fence, climb the ladder, and pull it up after them
bugle plays a cavalry charge
The mob bolts after them
: Split-screen
On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Becky wearing their operator head- phones
On the other side, we see Commander Pierce, Secretary McIntire, and the commander's entourage inside the command tent
Commander Pierce says into his field-telephone: Captain Sharp, we've located the missing troop
They just fled camp
We're in () 85
(cont'd) pursuit
They're accompanied by a twelve- year-old girl in knee-socks and Sunday- school shoes
Stand by, Commander Pierce
Captain Sharp spins around in his chair and flips a switch on a two-way radio
He says into a microphone: Jed, re-route to St
Jack Wood
Tell Social Services the boy's been spotted at Fort Lebanon
(
) Roger that
Will comply
Captain Sharp sets down the microphone
He turns to Becky
Becky, notify the Bishops: Suzy's there
Becky nods
Captain Sharp turns to Scout Master Ward
Randy
You monitoring
Scout Master Ward is already on his feet
He peels off his head-phones
Affirmative
'm on my way
Becky plugs a cord into a socket and says: Hello
Mr
Bishop
Captain Sharp looks out the window with a sense of dread
Mr
Bishop listens on the telephone with a strained look on his face
Mrs
Bishop watches him intently
Oh, dear God
Mr
Bishop grabs Mrs
Bishop by the wrist
He says grimly: Get the boys
86
Mrs
Bishop raises her megaphone to her mouth
She shouts: Let's go
Right now
deHavilland Beaver in heavy rain and turbulence
Jed speaks into his radio while piloting the aircraft
Social Services sits beside him in the passenger's seat
She looks queasy but determined
Tower control, this is Jed
Confirm co- ordinates for new destination: alpha-two- two-seven-one-fiver
Looking pretty soupy up here
Wouldn't mind setting down before the pot boils over
(to Social Services) Hang on, Social Services
Jed presses the yoke forward, and the plane dips hard
Social Services braces against the dash
Scout Master Ward steers his outboard through the open channel
The boat crests high over deep swells, flooding over in waves
Scout Master Ward is drenched
He does not flinch or even appear to notice
Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop scramble through the woods as fast as they can
There are flashes of lightning and pounding thunder
Suzy trips on a root, and Sam pulls her to her feet
Sam trips on a rock, and Suzy pulls him to his feet
The commander's entourage is frantically packing up their portable telephones,
system, folding tables, collapsible chairs, etc
One of them wraps a tarp around boxes labelled Fireworks
: transistor radio
The announcer says urgently: (
) Once again: storm waters have just breached the dam at Black Beacon () 87
(
) (cont'd) Reservoir
flash flood alert is in effect
Take immediate precautions
Commander Pierce and Secretary McIntire listen to the report
Secretary McIntire says gravely: That's coming our way
Captain Pierce nods, worried
The capture-the-flag scouts in soaking jerseys gather, winded, outside the tent
One of the team captains stands in the entrance breathing heavily
Commander Pierce points to him: You find them
No, sir
(to the entourage) Prepare to mobilize to higher ground
Secretary McIntire hands Commander Pierce an envelope with red-and-white stripes on it
Commander Pierce rips it open
: St
Jack Church is the designated storm shelter
(to Secretary McIntire) Notify all scouts to muster outside my tent on the double
: The St
Jack's Church poster box
Another mimeographed page is stapled to the bulletin board
The heading is now Summer Pageant, 1965
It reads: ' "' " Performed by the Choristers of St
Jack Wood and New Penzance 8PM The set for the ark stands on the platform behind the altar
There are candles and garlands in place, but also stacks of 88
cardboard boxes and gallons of distilled-water
Numerous animal costumes hang from a rolling garment rack
An old nun crosses the aisle carrying a large, metal coffee dispenser
Two young priests cross in the opposite direction carrying folding cots
Voices shout urgently off-screen: (
) More sandbags
We need dry blankets
Wake up the Deacon
Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop slowly poke their heads in from the side door and creep up the stairs to the choir loft
The entire brigade of scouts stands assembled in formation in the rain
The last two stragglers come running and hurry into their positions
They all wear rain slickers or canvas ponchos
Commander Pierce, Secretary McIntire, and the commander's entourage emerge quickly from the command tent
Commander Pierce shouts: Attention, company
Prepare for -- Commander Pierce hesitates
He points down to the marina and says to Secretary McIntire: Who's that
Secretary McIntire and the commander's entourage turn to see: Scout Master Ward speeding toward the dock in his motorboat
He leaps to shore, throws a line over a post, and sprints up to the assembly
He salutes Commander Pierce
Commander Pierce frowns and asks with quiet ferocity: You call yourself a Khaki Scout
() 'm sorry, sir
() Where's your goddamn troop
They could get killed out there
() You don't have them
89
() You're a liability to us
( ) The incident may affect our insurance premiums
Commander Pierce looks at Scout Master Ward's breast pocket
: name-tag that reads Scout Master Ward next to a patch with a picture of a snow-capped mountain
It says
Leadership underneath
Commander Pierce says bitterly: 'm field-stripping you of your command
Commander Pierce rips the patch off Scout Master Ward's uniform and throws it aside
He holds out his hand, palm up
Scout Master Ward looks stricken
He reaches into his pocket, takes out his scout pocket-knife, and hands it Commander Pierce
Commander Pierce puts it into his own pocket
He : Attention, company
Prepare for emergency evacuation
Secretary McIntire leans close to Commander Pierce
He : Sir, do you have your medicine
Commander Pierce hesitates
He holds up a finger
'll be right back
Commander Pierce strides back into the command tent
Secretary McIntire looks to Scout Master Ward, uneasy
Scout Master Ward stares down at the ground
The flash-flood explodes out from the woods
Gushing water pours down the hillside, cuts a swath through the center of the camp, and tears down everything in its narrow path
The command tent suddenly becomes a tiny island at the center of a rushing river
90
The company is taken aback
Scout Master Ward stiffens, watchful
The totem pole creaks and sways, then falls cleanly onto the command tent, splitting it down the middle
Inside, something sparks, pops, then blows up
The tent bursts into flames
Secretary McIntire does not react
He stands perfectly still, watching the fire
Scout Master Ward taps him, grabs him, and shakes him
Secretary McIntire looks at him blankly
Scout Master Ward makes a snap decision
He turns to the company : Hold your position
Scout Master Ward runs ahead, splashes into the raging flood, wades through it against the current, dodging branches and debris, then pulls himself up onto the fallen totem pole and walks balancing on it to the burning tent
He disappears inside
Secretary McIntire and the vast company watch, riveted
Scout Master Ward comes out the opposite side of the tent onto the other end of the fallen totem pole carrying Commander Pierce over his shoulders
He descends back into the water, trudges through it, and steps up onto the embankment
The company looks deeply, permanently impressed
Scout Master Ward hollers: Company Secretary
Status report, sir
Secretary McIntire hesitates
He stirs to attention and says : All accounted for, Scout Master
Supply and Resources
Call it out
Cousin Ben gives an - sign near the front of the assembly
: Affirmative, sir
Fall in
We're going to run for it, boys
Let's move
The entire company follows Scout Master Ward with Commander Pierce over his shoulders at a fast jog out of the camp
91
The room has now been converted into a full-fledged refugee center
Families from the town-ship huddle in pews with bags and piles of their wet belongings
Priests and nuns distribute towels and sandwiches to frightened children
Dogs and cats prowl nervously
Sandbags are stacked in low walls outside the doors and windows
The rain beats on the roof, and lightning continues to flash through the stained glass
side door opens
Captain Sharp comes in from the storm with Mr
and Mrs
Bishop
Lionel, Murray, Rudy, and the two old fishermen follow closely behind them
They slam the door
Captain Sharp looks around frantically
Who's in charge here
Another side door opens
Scout Master Ward jogs in with Commander Pierce still over his shoulders and the entire company behind him flooding into the room
Captain Sharp yells to him: Randy
What happened
Scout Master Ward goes over to Captain Sharp and turns his back to him, jogging in place
Take the commander off of me
Captain Sharp helps Commander Pierce down off Scout Master Ward's back and into a pew to rest
Secretary McIntire assists them
Mr
Bishop strides up the aisle yelling to the left and right: Suzy
Sam
(shaking his head) They ran away again
Mr
and Mrs
Bishop grimace, unbelievably frustrated
Scout Master Ward addresses the scouts: We're going back out
need volunteers
Hands raise
Scout Master Ward passes out walkie-talkies as he chooses his squad: 92
You, you, you, you -- Becky steps in front of Scout Master Ward with her hand raised
Scout Master Ward hesitates
-- and you
Becky takes a walkie-talkie
She looks at Scout Master Ward with admiration and asks, concerned: Are you all right
() Of course,  am
Come on
Scout Master Ward leads Becky by the arm through the crowded church as they begin to gather supplies: extra flashlights, a flare gun, coils of rope
Captain Sharp looks up to the choir loft
Eleven children dressed in animal masks sit quietly in a row
Captain Sharp does a double-take
One of the animals is an otter wearing Sunday-school shoes and binoculars around its neck
Next to her is the male of the species in a sash with numerous small, embroidered patches on it
The front doors open
There is lightning, thunder, wind, and rain
Social Services enters
She takes off a wet cape with a red lining and hands it to an acolyte in a robe
Jed presses the doors shut behind them
Social Services asks immediately: Where's the boy
Captain Sharp hesitates
He says reluctantly: We don't know yet
That's not acceptable
(pretending to be irritated) What do you want me to say, lady
(to no one in particular) Somebody get Jed a cup of coffee
The acolyte runs to the coffee dispenser with a cardboard cup
Social Services charges over to Captain Sharp
93
You're Captain Sharp
That's right
'm Social Services
remanded the boy to your personal custody
You're responsible for his safety
'm told he was just struck by lightning
Captain Sharp frowns
He looks to Scout Master Ward and says : That's the first  heard of it
() It's true
Captain Sharp tries to process this
Social Services now moves in on Scout Master Ward
She says aggressively: Scout Master Ward,  presume
Yes, ma'am
() Your reputation precedes you
Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward stand side-by-side in front of Social Services
She berates them: You two are the most appallingly incompetent custodial guardians Social Services has ever had the misfortune to -- () -- in a twenty-seven year career
Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward look sheepish
Social Services says bitterly: What do you have to say for yourselves
Captain Sharp hesitates
He says strangely: 94
You can't do this
They'll eat him alive in there
() Where
(aside, to Scout Master Ward) What's the name of the place again
() Juvenile refuge
() Juvenile refuge
That sounds like jail
Silence
In the background, the acolyte picks up Panagle's walking stick weapon off the floor
He stares at it, puzzled
Social Services says carefully: Just find the boy -- and deliver him -- (motioning to herself) -- to Social Services
Nothing else is in your power
() 'm sorry
Social Services, Captain Sharp, and Scout Master Ward turn to Mr
and Mrs
Bishop
Mr
Bishop looks tense
Can we get back to the rescue now
() Suzy's still out there
() Who are you
Walt and Laura Bishop
Their daughter's the missing girl
The parents of the stabber
95
object to that description
She was attacked
Commander Pierce appears with an oxygen mask over his face
He pulls it aside briefly and says to Secretary McIntire: want the details
Where's the scout she knifed
Right here
Secretary McIntire snaps his fingers and gives a signal
Redford appears
Field Mate Redford, sir
(through the oxygen mask) What's his condition
He may suffer some limited chronic kidney insufficiency
Here's the report
Secretary McIntire hands Commander Pierce a doctor's report
Mrs
Bishop snatches it and throws it over her shoulder
We don't have time for this
She's right
Let's go
Social Services turns and starts up the aisle
She stops suddenly
Captain Sharp is standing in their path brandishing Panagle's walking stick weapon
Nobody's going anywhere
Everyone stops
Captain Sharp locks eyes with Social Services
He says in a steely voice: He's not getting shock therapy
96
Social Services looks furious
Her jaw sets
She reaches inside her jacket and withdraws a small pad labelled Citation Book
That's it
'm citing you for gross misconduct
You are hereby summoned to appear before the board of -- Captain Sharp looks enraged
He grits his teeth
He reaches into his back pocket and withdraws a similar pad labelled Boating Violations
'm writing you up back
Be notified that you stand accused of the mistreatment and -- () What are you talking about
() won't let you do it
() Look
Everyone looks
Redford is standing on a pew with his arm stretched out pointing up at the choir loft in amazement
The troop is there, but Sam's and Suzy's seats are empty
There is a flash, a bang, and all the lights in the room go out at once
People gasp
Candles flicker alight on candlesticks
back-up generator kicks into gear, humming, and the room fills with a new, different light
Captain Sharp says to himself: They're gone
() Who
() Suzy
97
() Sam
() Gadge
Lazy-eye
Skotak
() They're here
Captain Sharp strides down the aisle
He shouts up to Skotak: Where'd they go
Answer me
Skotak hesitates
He and the rest of the troop all look up to a small, rickety, attic door
It is slightly ajar above a long, narrow ladder behind the pipes of the organ
Captain Sharp bolts up the steps
Everyone follows him, running
The storm rages
Captain Sharp opens a trap door onto the high eaves
Faces appear in numerous windows below, looking up
Mr
and Mrs
Bishop poke their heads out behind Captain Sharp
On the far end of the rooftop, Sam and Suzy huddle together at the base of the high steeple
Captain Sharp stares up at Sam and Suzy, dumbstruck
Sam and Suzy quickly start climbing a rusty gutter up the side of the steeple
Captain Sharp looks astonished
He : Halt
Stop
Sam and Suzy continue to climb
Captain Sharp shouts back to Mr
and Mrs
Bishop over the roaring wind: Stay there
Scout Master Ward appears and thrusts out the coil of rope
He yells to Captain Sharp: Take this
98
Captain Sharp throws the rope over his shoulder and advances
Mr
and Mrs
Bishop both crawl out after him, but Scout Master Ward pulls them back
Mr
Bishop looks to Mrs
Bishop
They are both terrified and helpless
They hold on to each other tightly
: Captain Sharp tight-rope-walking along the edge of the slippery roof with his arms stretched out sideways, balancing
He army-crawls up steep slate shingles and reaches the bottom of the steeple
He looks up
Sam and Suzy have arrived at the top
They inch away sideways around a ledge and disappear to the other side
Captain Sharp's voice : Where you going
What are you doing
Come down
Captain Sharp rubs his eyes
He knots one end of the rope around his waist and ties the other to a pipe at the foot of the gutter
He pulls the rope tight, presses his foot on the wall, and gets ready to start climbing -- then stops suddenly
He hesitates
He pulls the walkie-talkie off his belt and yells into it: Social Services
Do you read me
Over
: Sam and Suzy at the top of the steeple standing with their backs against a painted cross
They look out
The entire church has become an island
The cemetery is under water, and the circling streets are fast rivers
Suzy turns to Sam
They both appear relatively calm
We might have to swim for it
How deep is it
didn't bring my life jacket
don't know, but if it's too shallow, we'll break our necks, anyway
Hang onto me
99
Sam and Suzy link arms
: Captain Sharp climbing the steeple as Social Services yells at him over the speaker of his walkie-talkie: (
) Application denied
'm sorry
Over
() Counsellors
What's the legal perspective
Over
: Mr
and Mrs
Bishop watching from the trap door with Scout Master Ward
Mr
Bishop's eyes widen
He turns quickly to Mrs
Bishop
She nods, energized
Mr
Bishop grabs Scout Master Ward's walkie-talkie and shouts forcefully: In this state
would litigate with extreme confidence
() concur
() Open with article fifteen of the Codes of Civic Jurisdiction
( ) No party, under any circumstance, shall be denied due and proper consideration
: Social Services' face, inscrutable, as she listens
: Sam and Suzy preparing to jump
They each take a deep breath
On three again
() Wait
Just in case this is a suicide, or () 100
(') they capture us, and we never see each other again anymore -- thank you for marrying me
'm glad  got to know you, Suzy
Suzy looks deeply moved
She kisses Sam
little electric zap crackles at their lips
Suzy's eyes widen
think you've still got lightning in you
Let's jump
Sam and Suzy look down at the water again
Captain Sharp's voice screams from off-screen: (
) No
Sam and Suzy recoil
Captain Sharp appears, clinging to the corner of the ledge
He shouts: Goddammit
Sam and Suzy retreat slightly
Captain Sharps waves his hands in surrender
He yells into the walkie-talkie: Tell him
Over
Captain Sharp holds out the walkie-talkie
Social Services voice comes over the scratchy speaker once more
She shouts: (
) Captain Sharp is offering to assume the responsibility of foster parenthood
: Scout Master Ward watching from the trap door with Mr
and Mrs
Bishop
He says excitedly into his walkie-talkie: He wants you to live with him
: Social Services watching from an attic window
She says softly into her own walkie-talkie: 101
Is this acceptable to you, Mr
Shakusky
: Sam staring at Captain Sharp
Captain Sharp says hopefully: What do you think, pal
Tears stream down Sam's cheeks in the rain
He looks to Suzy
She nods
She holds Sam's hand, and Sam reaches out to take Captain Sharp's
Captain Sharp says into the walkie-talkie: We're coming down
Over and out
: Inside the church
The congregation listens on another walkie- talkie
They are all just about to burst into a cheer -- when there is a second, brighter flash followed by a much louder bang and then a terrible, thunderous, ripping explosion
The lights go out again
Everyone screams
Scout Master Ward, Mr
and Mrs
Bishop, and Social Services stare with their mouths open in frozen horror
The entire steeple has disappeared
Only a twisted stump remains
Off the edge of the roof, at the end of the rope, dangling in the rain, Captain Sharp hangs swinging with Sam's hand in his fist and Suzy's in Sam's
Voices shout in a panic above
Sam and Suzy look up at Captain Sharp
He says to them evenly, swaying above the rushing water: Don't let go
: Three days later
The detached steeple of the church lies on its side on the roof of a smashed Volkswagen
